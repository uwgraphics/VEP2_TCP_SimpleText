A VINDICATION OF BAPTIZING BELIEVERS INFANTS.

IN SOME ANIMADVERSIONS Upon Mr. TOMBS His EXERCITATIONS About Infant
Baptism; As also upon his EXAMEN, As touching the Antiquities and Authors by
him alleged or contradicted that concern the same.

Humbly submitted to the judgment of all Candid Christians,

By NATHANAEL HOMES.

And Jesus called a little child, and set him in the midst of them, and said,
Except men be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter
into the kingdom of heaven, whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this
little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven. And whosoever shall
receive one such little child in my name, receives me. But whosoever shall offend
one of these little ones, which believe in me, it were better for him that a
millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of
the sea,

TO THE READER.
DEdications of Books are to me a scruple. The truth of God is less mine, then
a day, or a place, to dedicate to creatures, and more able to defend it self
then any thing on earth. And Delarations in Epistles are in my opinion so
curious a thing rightly to manage, as that there is more hazard of their
miscarrying, then hope of doing good. Yet seeing importunity will not be
satisfied without an Epistle, therefore thus:

Hearing of Mr. Tombs his book against Infants-Baptisme, coming forth with
such a mighty shout of acclamation, though of some fitter to admire then to
judge; this made me in haste to see it, if it might prove convincing upon my
spirit. But finding upon a conscientions weighing, that it was not of strength
to bereave the faithful sons of Abraham of their right, and hope to give the
little ones of their tender bowels to the pledge of God, the first seal,
annexed to the promise, I am the God of thee and thy seed, Acts 2. Genesis 17.
The promise is to you and your children; But like a violent motion to be
forced at first, and languid toward the end, I further considered it. And
having upon occasion of the question among my brethren, then in order to be
discussed, found that I could fairly answer Mr. T. his arguments with abundant
satisfaction to my self and some others; but all that doubted could not at
first hearing, feel the weight of every passage; I was partly occasioned hereby
to give them my thoughts in print. And the rather that I might hear the
judgments of the Saints, whether I had thought aright of the question? And if
not, by friendly conference to clear up to me the mind of God in it. Mean
while I could not but lament the untimely birth of Mr T. his Exercitation, and
his unnecessary falling in travel with it, after at least six able brethren,
and about so many days, by nervous disput ation, had given him so much cause
to doubt of his Tenet, or at least, a while to suspend it.

For the question about Infants-baptisme is yet rather a controversy of private
persons, then of Churches; these being most prudentially careful now rather
about the right form of a particular Church; to which the administration of the
first seal does nothing contribute, at least in the first instant of its
generation. Matthew. 3. Acts 8. Acts 10. Acts 16.
For many were baptized in the New Testament, whose baptism neither found them
in, nor formed them into any particular New Testament Church. The Scripture is
either contrary to, or utterly silent concerning it. Josh. 5.4, etc.
Even as the Israelites, while they were forty years in the wilderness,
without the administration of Circumcision (all the circumcised saving a very
few being dead) are called a Church, Acts 7.38. So that the supposed want of
the due administration of the first Sign, does not unchurch a Church, or
prejudice the proper form thereof. But the insatisfactory calling of the
Anabaptists-Administrators of their pretended better baptism, upon a former
worseconceited-baptisme; being either not extraordinarily called; or not having
the first Seal themselves; or being Sebaptists, that is, self-baptizers; or
baptized with the old sort of Infant Baptism: (in either of which they are
most unlike to John THE BAPTIST) has justly caused many to hold off from them,
and many to fall away from them. And many that are with them, to be at a loss
where to rest. One Congregation at first adding to their Infani-baptisme, the
adult baptism of sprinkling: then not resting therein, endeavored to add to
that, a dipping, even to the breaking to pieces of their Congregation. Since
that, the Minister first dipped himself. Not contented therewith, was after
baptized by one, that had only his Infant Baptism. Thus does Gods justice
leave us to find nothing in an or dinance, when we put too much upon an
ordinance; and from too much, to fall to nothing, but a crying out, All
Ordinances, Ministeries, etc. are all polluted. So that as before they could
not tell where to end, so now not where to begin to reform, and so out of that
pretense turn As they were, in order, Nothing. Contrary to that unanswerable
place, Ephesians. 4. That Christ ascending, left a Ministry, or Ministeries;
Ephesians. 4.8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
all or some; by succession, or new election, or extraordinary mission; still a
constant supply of a Ministry; for the work of the Ministry, the perfecting
of the Saints, for the edifying of the body of Christ, till we all come in the
unity of the faith of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto
the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.

I was thus forward, to put forth before others of my abler brethren, not out
of self-confidence (the Lord knows,) but, beside mine own private interest in
my doubting friends, partly from advantage of time in knowing some of Mr. T.
his arguments, and partly from the assault of them that gave me the first
Alarm, I sent forth this scattered forlorn hope, scarce well rallied and
arraied to my mind, through haste, to set the moveable popularity at a stand
(if it might be;) keep the pass, and maintain the fight, till better help
should come in. This (though less then I hoped, by reason of pressures of mine
own business, and slownesse of Presses) I have attained. And so I expect those
worihy brethren, that have perhaps more time, and more parts, and reading, I am
confident, then my self, to carry on the main Battalio, and to maintain their
ground with those Brigades, wherein they are by name engaged. For it would have
been disorder, if not presumption, and prejudice to the cause for me to have
anticipated them.

In that I have done, as I was hopeless to please all, so unwilling justly to
displease any, saving in the very opinio in question. And therefore let no
ingenuous reader take offense, either at the word Anabaptist (used only as the
known term of distinction;) or at the much quotation of Fathers, and
Antiquities in an historical way, being necessarily drawn thereunto by Mr. T.
or at any quickness of expression, it being, if I know my self, rather the
complexion of my style, then any intention of sharpness. The Lord, I trust,
has now made me better to know and to make known a Gospel spirit, especially
in print and preaching.

If any notwithstanding that have read Mr. T. will not patiently read over
those on the other part, they cannot be excused of partial injustice, and of
unfaithfulness to themselves, and to the truth, in that they will not hear
with both ears. Qui part altera inaudita aliquid statuerit licet aequum
statuerit, haud aequus est. It Is the law of England, he that without hearing
either party passes sentence, though he determine a just thing, yet he is not
a just Judge. The Lord settle thee and me in the truth of the Lord Jesus, is
the earnest prayer of thy faithful friend in the Lord,

ERRATA.
CAndid Reader, since the sheets came to my hands, as wrought off the Press,
casting mine eye here and there, I espied these faults, page 104. CHAP. I. for
CHAP. XII. Page 110. (...) for (...). P. 142. l. 31. Of Infants not in danger of
death, for of Infants in danger of death. P. 150. l. 23. Sin, merit, for sins

leave it to thy charity as a Christian to correct, or heartily interpret the
faults of human frailty, that can do nothing perfectly.

ANIMADVERSIONS UPON Mr. TOMBS HIS EXERCITATION ABOUT INF ANT-BAPTIS ME.
CHAP. I.
THe present Tenent (says Mr. Tombs) according to which Infant Baptism is
practiced, is, Exercitation. Section 1.
that the Infants born of Believers are universally to be baptized. This
Doctrine, and practice conformable, is doubtful to me, by these arguments.

1 That which has no testimony of Scripture for it, is doubtful; but this
Doctrine of Infant Baptism has no testimony of Scripture for it, ergo it is
doubtful.

1 We put in caution; that we say not Infants, but Infants of believers may be
baptized. 2 We retort, Animadvers.
that institution against which there is no prohibition, is doubtfully laid
aside. But there is no prohibition against the institution of giving the 1.
sign, or seal to believers children, whilst children; ergo it is doubtfully
laid aside; as the Anabaptists teach and do.
The minor (says he) is proved by examining the places that are brought for
it, which are these. Genesis 17.7. etc. Act. 2.38, 39. Exercitat. Sect. 1.
1. Cor. 7.14. Mar. 10.14.16. Act. 16.15.32.1 Cor. 1.16.

We answer, Animad.
that the confirmation of our minor is proved by examining the Exercitators
examinations of those Scriptures that are brought for the baptizing of
believers children, or infants.

The argument from Genesis 17.7, Exercitat. Sect. 1.
etc. has so many shapes, that I may take up here that speech, With what knot
shall I hold shape-changing-Proteus?

We are sorry that Mr. Tombs should compare an endeavor fully to draw forth
the marrow of a text of Scripture (which every where abounds with sense) to a
poetical fable touching Proteus. Animadvers.
If Mr. T. will justify that, we may with more boldship 1 say of Mr. T.
himself, that had he been an Ulysses he might have constrained Proteus, or a
Gordius, he might have knit a knot upon him (whosoever he be) that could not be
untyed. 2 That if the man for baptizing believers infants be a shape-changing-
Proteus, what then is the Anabaptist, touching the point in hand, and in his
answers to the text now in question, to wit, Genesis 17? For sometimes he says
that this Covenant with Abraham is a fleshly Covenant; So Mr. B. S. P. etc.
sometimes a temporal Covenant; sometimes a spiritual covenant; and if a
spiritual, sometimes he says it is a covenant of works: sometimes he
confesses it is a covenant of grace in part. But then one while he doubts
whether seed here does not only signify Christ? another while, if it does
signify more, whether it be not only a particular covenant to Abraham? To all
which (seeing Mr. T. has occasioned us to mention them) we desire to speak a
little, before we come to Mr. Tombs his answers.

The Apostle makes but two Covenants, works, and 2. of grace, and this of grace
twofold in the administration, viz. Old and New. Hebr. Chap. 8. Chap. 9. where
the Apostle makes it his business to set down all the main differences between
the old and new Testament-administration of the covenant of grace: but never
mentions this of the Anabaptists; that children of believers were to be signed
with the 1. sign of the old, in the old Testament, and not with that of the
New, in the new Testament.

But to answer. 2 more particularly to the several reasons.

Obj. 1. P. H.
Whether not fleshly, because its a sign in the flesh.

A. So is Baptism and holy Supper fleshly or carnal in the sign.

The outward shell of an ordinance may be carnal; when the substance is
spiritual. Hebr. 9.10. See v. 9. yea see in the Apostles exposition of the
whole Ceremonial Law throughout the Epistle to Hebr.

Ob. 2. Whether not a temporal covenant i. e. of temporal things.

As, 1 Whether not of giving Canaan only, so Genesis 17. W. S.
v. 8. Or, 2 Whether not of making Abraham a father of many nations. D. P.
So Genesis 17. where it is mentioned three times, v. 4. v. 5. v. 6. compare Romans
4.11. Heb. 6.14.


A. You see in the Gospel that the body of the Covenant of grace is, God is our
God in Christ. But the appendices of temporals if taken in the shell as, Seek
first the kingdom of God, and all other things shall be added to you. Matthew.
6.33. And all things shall work together for good to them that love him; to
them that are called according to his purpose. Romans 8.28. And I will not leave
you nor forsake you. Hebr. 13.5. do not make two covenants, nor does the latter
make void the former. And as considered in the kernel they relate to heaven:
blessed are ye that shall eat and drink in the kingdom of heaven. Luke 22.32.
Behold I and the children. Hebr. 2.13. If our earthly tabernacle: etc. 2 Cor.
5.1. and so fit to be joined as appendices to heaven. All our mammon made
friends to us toward heaven. Luke 16.9. So in the old Testament, Canaan and
children. Considered in the shell. But in the meaning, Canaan signifies the
Church militant, Jerusalem above, Gal. 4.26. And triumphant, If Jesus had given
them rest. Hebr. 4.8. And children signify that among them Christ should come,
Genesis 22. compare Gal. 3. And that many children signify he shall have many
believers to his children, Romans 4. And therefore has faith in uncircumcision
that he might be the father of the Gentiles that believe: Ibid. Romans 4. and
therefore these well suited with the Covenant of grace.

Therefore to that Genesis 17. touching Abraham's posterity, the Lord speaks in
that order.

1 To settle Abraham's faith and comfort with many privileges. 2 Descends from
temporals in the shell, to spirituals in substance. 3 In order of nature. 1
Abraham must have children, then Christ, then comes the great part or basis of
the Covenant, v. 3. In Christ I am thy God. Its usually in the Hebr. to name
last, the main thing to be spoken of.
2 To that Romans 4.11. its plain to have many children is made a part of the
covenant of grace; and the reason is showed, that he might be the father of all
that believe, which is a spiritual thing.

3 To that Hebr. 6. its clear of an additionall promise by oath made, Genesis 22.
not of the main Covenant.

3 Whether not a covenant of works. As a manuscript would have it. Ans. No, so
expressly, Romans 4.11.

Obj. He says that there, Genesis 17. it is said, if they did break his covenant
on their part, he would be no more their God, but curse them, v. 14.

Ans. 1. The covenant of works they brake long before in paradise, Romans 5.
Therefore was this covenant added. 2 He does not cut them off for breaking the
Covenant once taken, but if they did not enter into it, which was to break the
command of entering into covenant. Ibid. Genesis 17.14. So in the Gospel, He that
believes not shall be dammed. Joh. 3. And except a man be born again of water
and the spirit he shall not enter into the kingdom of God. ibid Joh. 3.

But grant, say some, it be a covenant of grace, yet, say they, the question
is, 1 whether by seed is not meant Christ. As the Apostle expounds, Gal. 3.16.

Answ. That in Gal. 3.16. relates to Genesis 22.11. of Gods oath to Abraham; not
of the form, or sign, or administration of the Covenant. Genesis 17. For in Genesis
17. is no such expression. But Genesis 22.18. it is expressed according to this of
the Apostle.

Obj. It is said, Genesis 17.19.21. My covenant will I stablish with Isaac, that
is, with Christ, for an everlalting covenant.

Ans. Where it is said, that with Isaac, that is, Christ, the covenant shall be
established; the holy Ghost speaks of the efficacy of the covenant, showing
wherein and whereby the covenant shall be effectual; namely, by faith in
Christ. But where it is said, Genesis 17.7.9. I am the God of thee and thy seed,
thou shall keep my covenant therefore, to circumcise all the males of thy
house, it is spoken of the outward administration of the sign of the covenant.
So that in the same chap. where the holy Ghost intimates the efficacy of the
covenant to be only with Isaac in Christ; yet does he command the outward
administration of the sign to all the males in Abraham's honse, yea to Isinael,
though to him the covenant should not be established, as it is expressed, v.
18, 19, 23, 21, 22.

The want of the observing this distinction between the efficacy of the
covenant, and the form and outward administration of the sign of the covenant
is that which has bred much of the dispute between the Anabaptists and us. I
wish therefore it may be weighed, for the Scripture is very clear in it to me
touching every ordinance. Concerning the word, the administration is, Go preach
to every creature, Mark 16. But of the efficacy it is said, Heb. 4.2. The word
profits not without faith. The form of baptism is, Baptize in the Name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Ghost. Matthew. 28.19. But of the
efficacy we have other expressions, Romans 6.3, 4, 5. viz. Baptized into Christ,
baptized into his death, buried with him, planted into his death. And Mat. 3.
baptized with the holy Ghost, and with fire. So the form of administration of
the Lords Supper is, Take, eat, this is my body which was given and broken for
you, do this in remembrance of me. Mat. 26.26. Luke 22.19.1. Cor. 11.14. But of
the efficacy it is said in other words, The bread that we break is the
communion of the body of Christ. 1 Cor. 10.16. And ye show the Lords death till
ye come. ibid. And ye are all one bread, 1 Cor. 10.17.

Sutably we have it in Scripture, that many partake of the outward
administration, that partake not of the efficacy. Judas partook of the
administration of the word, and the pass^over: Simon Magus and Ananias of
baptism, Ismael of circumcision, and some intimated to partake of the outward
administration of the Lords Supper, 1 Cor. 11. all which might not partake of
the efficacy.

So that for the inward efficacy, we must leave that as a secret to Goa, to
work it upon us, and in us, when, and how, and how much he pleases, whether we
are baptized whiles infants, or when ripe of years; whether we hear the word as
men, or children; and so in the rest of the ordinances; But for the outward
administration and participation, we must keep close to the express
institution, not straightning or widning it, but to take it up as God lays it
down. They Matthew. 3. come to John's baptism; and are baptized according to the
institution, v. 6. with water. But after they were baptized, he tells them that
Christ must baptize them with the holy Ghost, the spiritual fire. v. 11.

Obj. If a covenant of grace, whether it was not a particular covenant to
Abraham; and not to be extended further; because it is clothed with many
circumstances which will suit only with Abraham, and fit him only.

Answ. This covenant was made with Abraham as a father, and exprefly extended
to his seed. And as he believing, the covenant runs to him and his natural
seed, whiles infants, I am the God of thee and thy seed. Genesis 17: so other
Gentiles believing, being Abrabams seed, (as the Apostle expounds the intent
and meaning of the covenant, Romans 4. Gal. 3.) the Covenant runs, to them and
their natural seed while infants.

CHAP. II.
NOw we return to Mr. T. his Exercit. where we left. But in the issue (says
Mr. T.) the argument from Genesis 17. 7, etc. falls into one of these forms. The
first thus. To whom the Gospel covenant agrees, to them the sign of the Gospel
covenant agrees also. But to the infants of believers the Gospel covenant
agrees; therefore to them the sign of the Gospel covenant agrees, and
consequently Baptism.

2 Form of argument from Genesis Exercit. Sect. 2.
17.7 etc. is thus (says Mr. T.) to whom circumcision did agree, to them
baptism does agree; But to infants circumcision did agree; therefore also
baptism.

3 Form (says he) is thus. Exercit. Sect. 3.
If baptism be not granted to the infants of believers, then the grace of God
will be more restrained in the new Testament then in the old. But this is not
to be affirmed; therefore baptism is to be granted to infants of believers.

These are all the forms of argument from Genesis Animadvers.
17.7, etc. as Mr. T. reports: but he reports not all the forms; nor the all of
those forms he reports. For with great injury to these three arguments, some
material thing is left out of every one of them by Mr. T. as we shall plainly
declare when we come to animadvert upon his answers to them. Mean while let us
tell the Reader that there are other forms of argument drawn from Genesis 17.7,
etc. and long since in print; See Mr. Ainsworths Answer to the Anabaptists.
and those to our apprehension very considerable; and to be put in the first
place in this dispute, according, to order of method, if not of nature too.
Therefore let the Reader that ingenuously reads to know, and not to quarrel
that he may not know, patiently give us leave to set them down, and briefly
urge the vigor of them; and then we will lay aside all to give him those short
notes we have to Mr. T. his Exercitation.

Our first form of argument from Genesis 17.7. etc. is this; urged by Mr. Ainsw.
in his book against the Anabaptists.

Where there is a command for a thing, never remanded or contramanded, there
the thing is still in force. But there is a command for signeing the Infants of
a believer with the sign of the Covenant of grace, Genesis 17.7.9. never yet
remanded, or contramanded: therefore the signing Believers children with the
sign of the Covenant of grace, (namely Baptism now) is still in force. So he.

For the confirmation of the Minor. If any where there is any Institution of
baptizing, only men of ripe years then in Matthew. 28. But not there, as we
shall see more after: mean while the Argument hence against baptizing of
Believers Infants lies not

1 In the order of words, for the order is inverted and contrary, Mar. 1.4.

2 Not in the affirmativenesse, one affirmative without a determinating word
expressed does not take off another affirmative.

3 The universal term cannot note the subject of Baptism, viz. All Nations.
For then all are to be baptized. And (...) would answer in (...) as well as
(...) to answer to (...), observe that Nations here mentioned well answer to
Nations, Genesis 17. explained, Romans 4. Gal. 3. That as Infants of believing
Abraham were to be circumcised, so the Infants of believing Gentiles to be
baptized.

4 Not the Greek word (...) as if that must needs signify make Disciples. For,
1 Its unlikely that so great a controversy as the Anabap: make of the Subject
of Baptism, should have no clearer an Institution, then a Gr. criticisme, of
taking one sense of a word that is taken diverse ways. For Significat and
docere in Mat. 28. Legh. Crit. S. Novar. in Mat. 28.20, Aliquando est verbum
transit, pro docere, ut Mat. 28. Whitak. Descript. The great Arias renders it
only Docete, teach. So the renowned Vatablus, so the Syr^ (...) and the Arab.
(...). So many others which for brevity we omit. 2 As (...) is in v. 19. so
(...) v. 20. therefore most likely in v. 19. it signifies only a general
teaching. And so the great Critic and learned men in Gr. tongue. That (...) is
to teach them that are strangers to Doctrine, that they may become Disciples,
(...) to teach them that are Disciples. So that here in v. 19. is not meant an
exact complete platform of Christ's commission to the Apostles: For here is no
mention of the holy Supper, but only the naming of the two more usual things,
viz. teaching and baptizing, and not the matter of subject of the
administration of Baptism. 3 The holy Ghost renders this text, Mar. 16.15. by
plain (...), preach the Gospel. 4 If the Greek word should be taken in that
peculiar sense, then the sentence would run thus: therefore make all Nations
disciples, which for these 1600 years was never done in any nation. 5 Nor can
the gender in (...) answering to the neuter gender (...) signify that the
children of believers ought not to be baptized. For if we stick so precisely to
the gender, then women are not to be baptized. If we keep to the gender, as to
relate to (...), then the children of believers are called disciples, Act. 15.
10. They upon whose necks the false teachers would put the yoke of circumcision
are called disciples. But the yoke of circumcision was put upon children as
well as men; and according to their institution upon children of eight days
old. Genesis 17.12. and so to continue unless in some great impediment, as in the
wilderness. And therefore out of doubt those false teachers that urged here
that the grown disciples should be circumcised, urged that their children
should be circumcised also. Therefore children are called disciples.


For which two Reasons.

1 The children are reckned with the parents in all ordinances communicable to
both, by warrant of Scripture. As till the Jews were broken off, Romans 11. Till
the vineyard was let out, Luke 20. Circumcision went along with the parents to
children; when parents lost it, the children lost it. When Ishmael was cast out
of the Church, his posterity was not circumcised, that we read of. By the same
proportion baptism goes along from parents to children. 2 There is a double
preaching, and a double Sacrament. A preaching to the heart, and to the ear:
An innitiating and a corroborating Sacrament. God can preach to the heart when
not to the ear. He a Spirit can preach to a spirit without sentences, and so
to children. This preaching is most suitable to infants, because thus man is
altogether passive: so the innitiating Sacrament is fit for infants, because in
that they can be but passive.
The soul of an infant is out of the body all one with an Angel. And therefore
one defines a soul, An Angel in a body. If the body cannot act, yet God can act
without the body. As we see great revelations, visions, etc. were given when
the body was asleep and unusefull. See the Patriarchs, etc. And Paul saw a
most glorious vision, when he had no use of his body, 2 Cor. 12. To make the
inward work of grace to depend on the body, is like the Pelagians and
Arminians, yea worse to make a work depend not only on reason, but on sense.

2 Form of Argum. from Genesis 17. is this, to whom the Covenant in force, runs
in the same tenor in the New Testament as in the Old, to them the application
of the first sign, or Seal of the New Testament may be applied as well, as
the first of the Old Testament. But this Tenor of the Covenant of grace still
in force, is as true and does as truly run to a believing Gentile, I am thy
God, and the God of thy seed, as it did to Abraham the Father of believing
Gentiles, Romans 4. Gal. 3. Ergo, the first Seal of the Covenant may be applied
to Believers children, now in the New Testament, as well as in the Old
Testament to Abraham's. The Major is plain, because in Genesis 17. the tenor of
the Covenant, and the application of the first Seal, are knit into a
dependence one upon another. I am the God of thee and thy seed, see v. 7, 8.
Therefore thou shall circumcise every male, v. 9. etc. The Minor is
unquestioned of any that I know.

3 Form of Argum. from Genesis 17. Where there is the same reason of a Precept,
there may be the same practice. But the Promise which is the reason of the
Precept runs in the New Testament (as flowing from Genesis 17.) to Believers,
and their children. The Promise is to you and your children. Act. 2.39. Ergo.
That this of Act. 2. flows from Genesis 17. Observe these particulars.

1 A Promise recited musts needs relate to a former engagement, and to them to
whom he speaks, viz. Jews. 2 And the or that promise (...) musts needs relate
to some eminent Promise; as that to Abraham was. 3 Some passages have an
intimation of the Covenant with Abraham, viz. 1 It is in relation to the
Covenant of grace, now to be sealed with the first Seal; Ergo, to that with
Abraham, Genesis 17. 2 It answers in words. It is to you and your children, all
one with you and your seed. And mentions calling, as God calling Abraham,
accepted his seed, etc.

Ergo, Infer, that the same reason on which the administration of Circumcision
was grounded, the administration of Baptism was grounded. So that the Apostle
does not only show how Baptism comes in the room of Circumcision; but that it
comes in the room and is administered upon the same ground; Ergo to the same
matter or subject. For children now as well as Genesis 17. are alike capable of
that ground. So the children here are made free of Gods City, the universal
Church, by the Fathers Copy, whether the Father be present, as the Jew, to
whom the Apostle spoke, or far off, either Jewe, whether unregenerate, and
far off in time, or scattered, and so far off in place, or Gertile, that is
far off in both, if any of these are called, the Promise is to them, and
their children. If any Gentile believe, he is a child of Abraham, Romans 4. Gal.
3. and so the promise, and first Seal are to him, and his children; as the
Promise and Circumcision were to Isaac and his children. And therefore when
Zacheus is converted, presently it is said, Salvation is come to his house, for
as much as be also is the son of Abraham, Luke 19.9.

Quest. But is not the Promise here meant of the extraordinary gifts of the
Holy Ghost, as to speak with tongues, do Miracles, etc.

Ans. 1. How then does this suit with the Promise to Abraham, to which this
Text relates, as we proved before?

2 The Apostle applies the Promise here meant to his hearers now present, for
their salvation whiles they cried out in their unregenerate estate, what shall
we do?

3 All did not receive these extraordinary gifts. But all that are baptized
into Christ, must receive the saving gifts of the Holy Ghost, Matthew. 3.
Therefore this Promise is to be extended beyond the gifts of Miracles, or other
extraordinary gifts of the Spirit, etc. For as all agree that, these were but
the First-fruites of the effusion of the Spirit, in that visible manner; to
signify the abundant effusion of the saving gifts of the Spirit, in an
invisible manner, in future ages. So that this must be a a Promise to all
Believers, and so to their children or seed indefinitely, that they shall
receive the Holy Ghost.

Quest. But are not these words [as many as the Lord shall call] an explication
of Children; so that the Promise is to their children with this condition, if
they shall be called?

Ans. No. For first, If so; then the Apostle needed not to say to you and your
children; but only to have said the Promise is to you, and to all the Lord
shall call. But this Promise is applied to them the Parents before their
calling, that it is to them as they are children according to birth, of
Abraham, a Believer, to the end to call them; and so to be continued to them
when called, and their children; and then it follows; And to all that are a
far off, when they shall be called, and so to their children (so it must be
supplied) so that Calling is an explication of the sentence to them that are a
far off.

2 The Apostle speaks to the Jews to the end to better, rather then to worse
their condition. But their children by virtue of the outward privilege and
Tenor of the Covenant, to and with them the parents, had the sign of
Circumcision; therefore (by the Apostles intent) their children should also
have Baptism. If this had not been the Apostle meaning, he had left these
Jews children, and all their Infant-posterity in no better condition, then the
most barbarous Heathens then in the world; and this had spoiled these Jews
comfort, and crossed the Apostles design, to draw them to Conversion, and the
new Sacrament of Baptism, for confirmation of that Conversion.

Now we go on with the place in Genesis 17. Namely,

3 Observe that this Covenant is called everlasting, which cannot be truly, and
properly so said of this, and other Ceremonies, but as relating to Christ.
Therefore, if the Covenant be everlasting to them and their seed, indefinitely
(as Election is propounded in the Scripture to us) then the sealing of it
outwardly to both them and their seed, must be everlasting to the worlds end;
and to all eternity inwardly to whom it is effectual. And therefore as in the
Old Testament it was sealed by Circumcision, so in the New Testament by
Baptism.

Now we come to animadvert upon Mr. Tombs his forms of Argument from Genesis 17.
as reported by him.

1 Argument says Mr. Tombs, Exercitat. Sect. 1.
(or at least the 1. form of Argument.) To whom the Gospel Covenant agrees, to
them the sign of the Gospel Covenant agrees also. But to the Infants of
Believers the Gospel Covenant agrees; therefore to them the sign of the
Gospel Covenant agrees. And consequently Baptism. The minor is proved, Genesis
17.7. Thus Mr. Tombs lays down the Argument.

But we ourselves should more cautiously form it thus. Examinat.
To whom the Gospel Covenant agrees, to them the sign of conveighance of the
Gospel Covenant agrees, etc. For the Institution in this 17. of Genesis does not
extend to any sign as to the corroborating, or confirming sign or Sacrament,
viz. the Passover. Nor is it our intention to extend it so far, as if we
would wind in that Believers Infants might receive the confirming corroborating
sign of the Holy-Supper, as Mr. Tomles his forming the Argument would seem to
reach. The difference is too wide between some sign and all signs, for us to
conclude that if some sign is due to them to whom is the Covenant, that
therefore all signs in the New Testament are due; and so to depart from the
design of the Text in hand.

But Mr. T^mbes not satisfied with the argument as laid down by himself,
Exercitat. p. 3.
makes diverse exceptions against it, although he confesses, that the
Gospel Covenant was the same in all ages in respect of the thing promised, and
the condition of the covenant, which we may call (says he) the sul^stantiall,
and essential part of the covenant, to wit, Christ, faith, sanctification,
remission of sins, eternal life. Animadv.
So he. and consequently (say we) he confesses that this Covenant, Genesis 17. is
a Gospel-one in the substance, and essence.

The exceptions Mr. Tombs makes are four.

That it is not (says Mr. T.) apure Gospel Covenant, 1 Except. Exercitation.
Sect. 1. p. 2.
but mixed. For (says he) the covenant takes its denomination from the
promises: but the promises are mixed, some Evangelicall, belonging to those, to
whom the Gospel belongs, some are domestic, or civil promises, specially
respecting the house of Abraham, and polity of Israel ergo. So he.

Answ. Denomination is (as Mr. T. well knows) a part potiori from that which
is principal in a thing. And who will not yield that the promises that concern
grace and salvation are the principal. Where does the Scripture call it a mixed
covenant? yea does not the Scripture in the New Testament frequently hold it
forth as a pure covenant of grace, as pure as any we have. Romans 4. v. 2, 3.
called a covenant of justification, v. 4. A covenant of grace, v. 11. A
covenant of faith, v. 13. Of the righteousness of faith. And opposes it not
to temporal promises, of domestic, or politic, or civil things, but to
works, v. 2. v. 4. v. 6. To the law of works, v. 14, 15. Just so, Gal. 3. its
called a covenant of righteousness by faith, v. 6. of justification through
faith, v. 8. opposed not to civil promises, but to the law of works, ver. 10,
11, 12. And I say this covenant with Abraham, notwithstanding any civil
promises of temporal things, was as pure a covenant of grace as any we have in
the New Testament. For where God repeats that in Isaac all the earth should be
blessed, that is, in Christ, namely, Romans 8.32. is there not a conjunction of a
promise of temporal things? If he spared not his own Son, how shall be not
with him freely give us all things? So 1 Cor. 3.22, 23. Whether Paul, or
Apolle, or Cephas, or the world, etc. all are yours, because ye are Chrisis. So
Christ himself, Matthew. 19.29. Every one that has forsaken houses, etc. shall
receive an hundred fold, and inherit everlasting life. And for this cause,
Exercit. Sect. 1. p. 2.
when God repeats that which M. T. calls a domestic or civil promise, viz. the
multiplying Abraham's seed, this the Lord refers to the covenant of grace. Romans
4.11. compare v. 17. and makes it the appurtnance of the grand promise. Ibid.
v. 13.16, 17. For appurtenances do not alter the tenure or substance of the
hold of a Manor.

Amplification 1. Mr. T. to clear this his 1. exception, does thus amplify,
says he, that was Evangelicall, Genesis 17.5. Exercit. Sect. 1. p. 2.
I have made thee a father of many nations. And that Genesis 15.5. so shall thy
seed be, viz. as the stars. Compare (says he) Romans 4.17, 18. which places (say
we) express only this, That he should be the father of many nations through
the power of God, according to that promise, so shall thy seed be. And says
Mr. T. a little after, this is domestic and civil; namely, the multiplying of
the seed of Abraham.

Ans. Now where is expressed any plain substantial difference between these
two expressions, Animad.
and whereby are we guided as by a sure thread, to call this or that expression
civil, or evangelical, I am not satisfied.

2 He adds further, that the promises of deliverance out of Egypt, Exercit.
Sect. 1. p. 2. Animadvers.
Genesis 15. and the possession of Canaan, Genesis 17. were civil.

Ans. Seeing the holy Ghost makes these temporal things by divine institution
significative of spiritual things. Deliverance out of Egypt, Mat. 2. and in
the Preface to the first Commandment, Canaan, Hebr. 4. I see not how
(especially being mentioned in relation to the covenant of grace) these are
more civil then Sinai and Jerusalem, Gal. 4.24, 25, 26. or bread and wine in
the holy Supper.

3 Mr. T. doubt in this amplification upon the first exception, Exercit. Sect..
1. p. 2.
whether this covenant made with Abraham may be called simply Evangelicall, and
so pertain to believers as believers, seeing that those promises which were
evangelicall, according to the more inward sense of the holy Ghost, do point at
the privileges of Abraham's house, in the outward face of the word.

Answ. Animadvers.
We see the Apostle, mentioning those expressions of fatherhood of many
nations; of the land of Canaan, etc. does apply this covenant as purely
evangelicall to believers as believers. Romans 4. Gal. 3. Hebr. 4. Of which
before. And I see no more cause to doubt of this to belong to believers as such,
then of that promise, Genesis 3. to belong to believers, The seed of the woman
shall break the serpents head: that is, we shall conquer Satan through Christ;
though this were in the face of the words an advancement of the privilege of
Eves family, Josh. 1.5.
or generation. That promise in the outward face of words did point at the
privilege of Joshnahs house; that God would not leave him nor forsake him,
viz. in his war with the Canaanites, yet this the Apostle applies to
believers as believers, Hebr. 13.5.

4 Mr. T. annexeth this reason to his doubt. Exercit. Sect. 1. p. 3.
There were, says he, annexed to the covenant on mount Sinai sacrifices
pointing at the sacrifice of Christ, and yet we call not that Covenant simply
evangelicall; but in some respect.

Answ. Animadvers.
If any do not (if their fact weigh any thing in a dispute) sure it is not
because of the Gospel types, for so Gospel sacramental types would detract
from their absolute Gospel notion; but in regard of the legal terrible manner
of delivering the ten Commandments; which severed from the atonement of the
Ceremonial Law, were in a manner turned by the Jews into a covenant of works.
Therefore the Apostle says, as it were, Romans 9.32. Moses mosissimus (says
Luther) kills. But Moses Aaronicus saves. The ten Commandments looked truly
upon, under a right notion, as added to the Ceremonial Law, Moses joined with
Aaron are as absolutely evangelicall; as obedientiall love added to faith in
the New Testament. Cameron These. 66.67.
And therefore it is only in regard of some modall differences that Cameron
calls the covenant at Sinai the covenant subservient to the covenant of grace;
but not in the sulstance in which it agrees with the covenant of grace in as
many particulars, as Cameron brancheth them out; as in showing sin, leading to
Christ, restraining from sin; pledging in and by a Mediator, promising life,
etc. yea there are (as Diodat is one) that doubt not to call the covenant God
made with Israel at Sinai a covenant of mere grace.

Diodat. pref. to Exodus Exercit. p. 3.
2 Exception Mr. Tombs makes is; That the seed of Abraham is many ways so
called. 1 Christ is called the seed of Abraham, by way of excellency. Gal.
3.16.2 All the clect, Romans 9.7. All believers, Romans 5.11, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18.
that is, the spiritual seed. 3 There was a natural seed to whom the
inheritance did accrue, viz. Isaac, Genesis 21.12.4 A natural seed, whether
lawful, as the sons of Keturah; or base, as Ismael, to whom the inheritance
belonged not. Genesis 15.5. But no where do I find that the infants of believers
of the Gentiles are called Abraham's seed. Of the three former kinds of Abraham's
seed the promise recited, is meant; but in a different manner thus. That God
promises he will be a God to Christ, imparting in him blessing to all Nations
of the earth; to the spiritual seed of Abraham in evangelicall benefits; to
the natural seed inheriting in domestic and politic benefits.

Ans. Sure the holy Lord in a Covenant would not be thought to equivocate, and
be uncertain in his meaning. Animadvers.
Though God appoints the outward administration of the covenant to Abraham the
believer his seed indefinitely, Genesis 17. yet he gives the efficacy of the
covenant but to some; viz. that shall be the seed by faith, Romans 4. Yet we must
follow the administration according to express institution, Genesis 17. To whom
is derived the covenant effectually, to them are derived the promises of
blessing in every manner recited by the Exercitator (subordinate things are not
contrary) or in no manner per modum aut vim faederis, under the notion of a
covenant. Unregenerate men have a right to temporal things, by an humane
right, and higher, by a divine right of common providence, either as dwelling
with, or receiving them from those in real covenant with God; but not by
virtue of any covenant between them and God.

And for that great quaere made by Mr. T. whether the children of believing
Gentiles are called Abraham's seed? Exercitat. p. 3.
which is the main thing to the question in hand.

Ans. They are, Anius advers.
by the distinction and quotation of the Exercitator himself, by stronger
consequence then by which the Exercitator proceeds in most things he alleges.
For first, he says that the natural seed of Abraham, as Isaac, etc. are
called his seed. Secondly, that all believers are Abraham's seed, quoting Romans
4. We infer then, that the natural seed of believing Gentiles are as well the
seed of Abraham, as the natural seed of Isaac were; though Esau were Esau.

If a Gentile believer be the seed of Abraham, Romans 4.11. Gal. 3.8. then the
children of the Gentile believer must needs be reckoned for the seed of
Abraham; being the promise runs as truly in the New Testament, The promise is
to you and your children. Act. 2. or I am the God of thee Gentile believer and
of thy seed, as in the old Testament to Abraham, I am the God of thee Jewish
Abraham, and of thy seed.

3. Except. Exercit. p. 3.
That there is not (says Mr. T.) the same reason of circumcision of Baptism
in signing the Gospel Covenant. The promise of the Gospel (says he) or the
Gospel Covenant was the same in all ages in respect of the thing promised, and
condition of the covenant, 1. Mr. Tombs his concession.
which we may call the substantial and essential part of the covenant, to
wit, Christ, faith, sanctification, remission of sins, eternal life; yet this
evangelicall covenant had diverse forms in which these things were signified,
and various sanctions by which it was confirmed.

To Adam the promise was made under the name of the seed of the woman, 2. The
distinction of diverse forms.
bruising the serpents head; To Enoch and Noah in other forms; otherwise to
Abraham under the name of his seed, in whom all nations should be blessed.
Otherwise to Moses, under the obscure shadows of the Law; otherwise to David,
under the name of a successor in the kingdom; otherwise in the new Testament in
plain words, 2 Cor. 3.6. Hebr. 8.10.

It had likewise diverse sanctions. 3. The variety of sanctions.
The promise of the Gospel was confirmed to Abraham by the sign of
circumcision; and by the birth of Isaac. To Moses by the Paschal lamb, and
sprinkling of blood on the book, the rain of Mannah, and other signs; To David
by an oath. In the New Testament by Christ's blood. 1 Cor. 11.25.

Therefore circumcision signified, 4. The conclusion.
and confirmed the promise of the Gospel according to the form and sanction of
the covenant with Abraham. Baptism signifies and confirms the same promise
according to the form, sanction, and accomplishment of the New Testament.

Now these forms and sanctions differ many ways; 5. The illustration of the
conclusion.
as much as concerns our present purpose in these;

1 Circumcision confirmed not only Evangelicall promises, 1. Partic.
but also political. And if we may believe Mr. Cameron in his Theses of the
threefold covenant of God, These. 78.
Circumcision did primarily separate the seed of Abraham from other nations,
se^led unto them the earthly promise; Secondarily it did sa^nifie
sanctification. But Baptism (says Mr. T.) signifies only Evangelicall
benefits.

2 Circumcision did confir the promise concerning Christ, 2 Partic.
to come out of Isaac; Baptism assures Christ to be come already; to have
been dead, and to have risen again.

3 Circumcision belonged to the Church constituted in the house of Abraham; 3
Partic.
Baptism to the Church gathered out of all Nations.

Whence I gather (says Mr. T.) that there is not the same reason of
circumcision, and baptism, in signing the Evangelicall Covenant. Nor may there
be drawn an argument from the administration of the one, to the like manner of
administering the other.

Answ. 1. From the concession in the third exception; Animadv.
That the Gospel Covenant was the same in all ages, in respect of the thing
promised, to wit, Christ, remission of sins, sanctification, eternal life; And
the condition of the Covenant, namely, faith; We infer, that Mr. Tombs grants,
1. that Gods covenant with Abraham signed with circumcision was a
Gospel Covenant. 2 That faith was the condition. And yet it was administered to
children; and to some that had no faith, either seminall, habitual, or
actual, neither at the time, nor after the time of their circumcision, namely,
to Ishmael. Therefore infancy, or want of actual faith, or possibility of
never having any true grace, are not sufficient hindrances of administration of
the sign of the Gospel Covenant. But as God knowing all those things did yet
command the outward administration, and signing of the Gospel Covenant with the
first Sacrament in the old Testament, upon that ground that God was the God of
the father of those children; So thus far by Mr. T. his grant we may likewise
sign the Gospel Covenant in the New Testament.

2 To the distinction of the diverse forms in which the things of the Gospel
covenant were signified, etc. We answer. What essential difference of form is
there between the expression to Eve under the name of the seed of the woman;
and that to Abraham in the name of his seed; or that between bruising the
serpents head, and blessing men in their deliverance from the serpent? And
whether was not the covenant as well confirmed in shadows to David (who by
divine direction set up very many in Gods worship) as to Moses? And whether the
Covenant was not confirmed to Moses under the notion of a success^ur to him, to
wit, Christ in the government of directing and preseribing in the name of the
Lord. Deuteronomy. 18.18. Act. 3.21, 22. And of rule, namely, Joshua called Jesus the
type of our deliverance by the Lord Jesus. Hebr. 4. to succeed him. Deuteronomy. 31.
Or does the types of the covenant, and the plain meaning, Heb. 8.10. make
several considerable forms of a covenant? Then sacramental signs or seals,
and the meaning of them; should make several forms of the most Gospel Covenant
in the New Testament.

3 To the variety of sanctions we say, that they are not so distinct as that
they are not common to the persons mentioned. The covenant was as well
confirmed to Moses, as to Abraham by circumcision; to David by both
circumcision and the paschal lamb as to the other. And as well to us in the
New Testament by oath as to Abraham. Hebr. 6. Hebr. 7.

4 To the conclusion Mr. T. makes; Exercit. Sect. 1. p. 4.
that therefore circumcision signified and confirmed the covenant to Abraham,
etc. We answer. That we can by no means be satisfied by this inference from the
premises how any thing is inferred by way of determination of the subject of
Baptism; as to show why children of believers should be circumcised, yet not
now baptized. But you will say, it lies in the illustration. Therefore.

5 To the illustration of the conclusion, we answer.

To the 1. partic. thus. 1. That Baptism does as well confirm civil promises
and benefi^s as Evangelicall, as did circumcision. Romans 6. Baptism signs
o^scals Christ according to the promise, To us a Son is given. And God giving
Christ, with him (mark, with him) freely gives us all things. Romans 8.32. which
is further explained of deliverance from temporal dangers, so that they shall
not hurt us, if hit us, v. 35. to the end. And 1 Cor. 3. two last. We have all
outward things, the world, etc. because Christ is ours. 2 That circumcision did
confirm civil promises, under a spiritual notion, for a spiritual use, that
is, to signify spiritual things, as we showed before; even as baptized ones
are to look upon all temporal things, under spiritual confiderations. Make
you friends (that is, to further you toward heaven) of the unrighteous mammon.
And all outward things are the addition to seeking and obtaining the kingdom of
heaven, and the righteousness of him, that is Christ, the King of that
kingdom. And so this difference is of no bulk to carry any breadth with it. To
the instance of Cameron we answer; that when I seriously read the whole Thesis,
I can make no more then this; that by primarily he means immediately, and 1. in
order; and by secondarily mediately, and 2 in order, and cannot be understood
as chiefly, and not chiefly. For sure the more ultimate and spiritual an end
is, and so more like and near to God, the more chief it must be. So that
according to Camerons instances (for he gives three) circumcision did more
chiefly intend sanctification, circumcision of the heart, as the Scripture often
advances it, and so spiritual separation of the mind from earthly things,
them the separating their nation from other kingdoms, by a mark in their flesh.
So secondly, the passover signed rather, Christ our passover for the delivery
of our souls, 1 Cor. 5. then the Angels passing over the Israelites, and not
slaying them in Egypt. So the sacrifices, did more intend our spiritual
purification by Christ, then any carnal purification, as Cameron calls it. We
add that Baptism as well as circumcision does not only signify regeneration,
but puts a distinction between them, and Heathens at least; as all not
circumcised in the old Testament were counted Heathens.

To the 2 partic. of the illustration we thus answer. That it is not in the
formal analogy of circumcision between the sign and the thing signified, nor
set down in any express form essentially annexed, to set forth the nature of
circumcision, that circumcision as circumcision, does signify, sign or seal
Christ to come, as to come. For as Christ come himself, was circumcised, so
many were circumcised after jure divino, the ordinance being in full force till
Christ was sacrificed; if Paul did not by that rule, after Christ had been long
ascended, circumcise Timothy. Act. 16.
So that for three years and an half, circumcision from John Baptist
ministry, to Christ's death ran parallel and even together authoritively in
the Church of the Jews in the New Testament in several, if not the same
subjects; in some, if not in all that received the 1. seal. It is true,
circumcision and other ceremonies by the concurrence of the circumstance of
time of administration in the Old Testament did imply Christ to come, but could
not of themselves either signify, or consignifie Christ to come, for the
reasons abovesaid. Even as Baptism either by analogy in the sign, or
expression of any form annexed, as setting forth the essence of baptism, does
not signify Christ as come. For some were baptized (as the Scripture calls it)
before Christ came. As those in the Ark, 1 Pet. 3. 21. the Israelites, men,
women and children in the Red sea, and the cloud. 1 Cor. 10.1, 2, etc. And this
the Jews understood as Baptism; and therefore do not say to John wherefore
baptizest thou? but by what authority. Jeh. 1.23. And the Rabbis make mention,
that the Jews foresaw also the baptizing with fire, mentioned Matthew. 3.

To the third partic. our answer is this: That circumcision as circumcision
belonged to all of all Nations (and their children) that should come in as
proselites to the Jewish Church, whether constituted in a family, Genesis 17.12,
13. or in the Nation, Exodus 12. 47, 41, 49. as Baptism in the New Testament to
all, and only those that came into the Christian Church; and their children. I
say into the Christian Church; that is, the parents came in at least into the
universal visible Christian Church; by confessing Christ to be the Son of God;
and so this difference pretended by Mr. T. between baptism and circumcision
comes if not to a samenesse yet to a likeness; and so the reason thus far
apparently to me, is the same between both. And the like argument may be drawn
for the administration of the one, as of the other.

The fourth and last exception Mr. T. makes against this argument out of Genesis
17. is, Exercit. Sect. 1. p. 2.
that these terms federate, and to be signed are not convertible.

Answ. They are convertible jure in equity; For Mr. T. will not doubt but that
those signed with circumcision, Genesis 17. or, etc. (for of circumcision is the
question immediately now, according to Mr. T. his instances, p. 4. l. 16.) were
federate; were reckoned, and to be reckoned in the covenant at the time of
doing it, and after, till contrary cause appeared. And all federate, or counted
within the covenant were to be signed with circumcision. So this text, Genesis
17.7, 8, 9. I am a God to thee and to thy seed, thou shall keep my covenant
THEREFORE, that every man-child be circumcised.

But to this fourth exception, Exercit. Sect. 1. p. 4. 1 Partic.
Mr. T. argues. That some there were circumcised, to whom no promise in the
covenant made with Abraham did belong. Of Ismael God had said, that his
covenant was not to be established with him. Genesis 17.20, 21, 25. Romans 9.7, 8,
9. Gal. 4.29, 30. The same may be said of Esau. All that were in Abraham's
house, whether strangers, or born in the house were circumcised, Genesis 17.12,
13. of whom nevertheless, it may be doubted, whether any promises of the
covenant made with Abraham did belong to them. There were other persons, 2
Partic.
to whom all, or most of the promises in the covenant pertained, that were not
circumcised. This may be affirmed of the females coming from Abraham; the
infants dying before the eighth day; of just men living out of Abraham's house,
as Melchisedech, Lot, Job. If any say that the females were circumcised in the
circumcision of the males, he says it without proof. And by like, Mr. T. his
answer to an Ob.
perhaps greater reason may it be said, that the children of believers are
baptized in the persons of their parents, and therefore are not to be baptized
in their own persons. But its manifest, that the Jews comprehended in the
covenant made with Abraham, and circumcised, were nevertheless not admitted to
Baptism, by John Baptist, and Christ's disciples, till they professed
repentance, 1 Conclus
and faith in Christ. Hence I gather, that the right to Evangelicall promises,
"was not the adequate reason of circumcising these, or those, "but Gods
precept, as it is expressed, Genesis 17.23. Genesis 21.4.

2 That those terms are not convertible [ federate and to be signed]. 2
Conclus.


Answ. to 1 Particular. [That some there were circumcised to whom no promise in
the covenant made with Abraham did belong.] Mr. Tombs argues from the non-fact
to the non-equitie, Animad.
and from the non-efficacie to non-administration, and from an after discovery
to cross the present rule; which arguing he knows, carries not with it in
other things any consequence. What if de facto some were not circumcised
according to the directory of administration; therefore jure ought they not, if
opportunities and accommodations concurred? What if some appeared after when
men not to have the efficacy of circumcision; were they not therefore justly
circumcised, when the institution did enjoin, and cause it to be done, whiles
they were infants? I need not enlarge upon the inconvenient sequels in the use
of all ordinances, if that administrations may not be, though ineffectualnesse
appear not always after.

And howsoever it be apparent in some, and doubtful in others, (and therefore
infer nothing) that the promise was not established, that is, was not
effectual to them, yet it is most apparent that the institution and
administration of circumcision is grounded on the express promise. As I am the
God of thee, and of thy SEED, therefore thou shall keep my covenant to
circumcise every male. Genesis 17.7.9. The promulgation and preaching of the
promise belongs to many, to whom it is not after effectual. Mar. 16.15. and if
the institution must go along with the promise here in Genesis 17. though it might
be specially revealed to Abraham what a one Ishmael should prove; then sure
much more amongst men who have no such revelations. And though we grant the 1.
line in this 1. partic. of Mr. Tombs, "that no promise in the covenant
belonged to Ishmael; yet Mr. Tombs confesses that circumcision signed civil
Sect. 1. p. 3. l. 16. 17. p. 4. l. 1.2.
promises to some of Abraham's seed. And that promise, Genesis 17 20. made to
Ishmael of blessing and multiplying him, must at least be such; though
eminently, and as concerning the coming of Christ, it is emphatically said that
in Isaac shall the covenant be established. Genesis 17. However, Abraham looked so
much on the promise, I am the God of thee and of thy seed, and the commentary
upon it touching blessing Ishmael, and the institution grounded on that promise
(however the effect should prove) that he circumciseth Ishmael.

For others within the covenant, yet de facto not circumcised; we must needs
see that it is by reason of other causes, and not the want of connection between
those two foederati and signandi, that is, to belong to the covenant, and to be
signed with the covenant. If God exempt infants by death that died within the
seven days, being not fit in nature for so sharp a Sacrament, what can we
infer more against the institution of this Sacrament, then against any other.
As for Melchisedech which was Sem (as the most learned agree upon unanswerable
reasons) he was born 500 years before the institution of circumcision, whose
institution is not to look higher then to Abraham at the highest, and so to
descend downward. If we could be sure that Lot and Job were not circumcised; we
could as surely answer that Job was not in the Land, Lot not in the County
where the institution of circumcision was then made known. And for women, the
institution of circumcision reached not to them, because there was no fit
matter for that Sacrament. That alteration of nature to intimate they were a
peculiar seed set apart from the Heathens as well as the males were, was done
in their fathers; on whom was acted more then the water can act, namely, to
make a natural change, though no spiritual followed. So that these particular
instances did destroy the ground and nature of the institution of circumcision
being only accidentally and extraordinarily excepted, upon the aforesaid
reasons; no more then the Israelites forty years journey in the wilderness
hindering circumcision so long did detract from the ordinary institution and
ground thereof. And therefore we

Ans. To both the conclusions, that the claim to this promise (which Mr. Tombs
confesses Exercitat. Sect. 1. p. 2. 3.
to be Evangelical in the substance) I am the God of thee and of thy SEED was
the adequate reason in the ordinary prosecution of circumcising. For though the
institution then is to Abraham's family, and to the males, etc. yet the ground
is the promise; I am thy God, and the God of thy seed. And so federate, and to
be signed are convertible in regard of the ground; upon which it followed that
Abraham was to have a Gentile seed. Romans 4. Gal. 3. to which the same promise
should run, I am your God, therefore the God of your seed. However if federate
and to be signed were not convertible terms, but only this true, that all
federate are to be signed: as thus such as to whom the promise is given, I am
your God, and so of your seed, being circumcised, their children by nature, or
adoption (as it is Genesis 17.12, 13.) ought to be circumcised; thus much would
serve our turns out of Genesis 17. for the baptism of believers children. Though
we could not turn the proposition convertibly, that all circumcised or baptized
are truly and effectually federate, in covenant. But how it may be turned we
have showed before.

And thus I leave the ingenuous Reader to judge how great, or how little reason
Mr. T. has to deny the major, or minor proposition of the 1 Argument out of
Genesis 17.

And to his reason of denying the minor, Exercit. Sect. 1. p. 5.
because (says he) those children of believing Gentiles are Abraham's children,
who are his spiritual seed, according to the election of grace by faith, which
are not known to us, but by profession, or special revelation.

We answer. That we must beware of circumcising and cutting off the tenor of
the covenant, taking only thus much (as many do) I am thy God; or drawing it
out beyond its length (as others do) thus; I am the God of thee, and thy seeds
feed; but take it evenly up as God lays it down just thus, I am the God of
thee and thy seed: therefore give the 1. sign or seal; and then it is easily
resolved who are Abraham's seed, and to be signed among the Gentiles, namely, he
that believes that God is his God, and the God of his seed, may sign his seed
with baptism; the parent knowing his children belong to it by the revelation
of the Word, and his own confession of faith in his heart and mouth.

CHAP. III.
2 ARgument (says Mr. T.) is thus formed. Exercit. Sect. 2.
To whom circumcision did agree, to them baptism does agree. * [But to Infants
circumcision did agree] therefore also baptism. The major is thus proved; If
the baptism of Christ succeeds into the place of circumcision, then baptism
belongs to them that circumcision belonged to; But the antecedent is true;
there also the consequent. The minor is proved to be true, because Colos. 2.11,
12. it is said that the Colossians were circumcised, because they were buried
with Christ in baptism.

Here we must complain again, Animadvers.
that somewhat is most injuriously left out of the minor proposition of the
former syllogism, namely, of that proposition above noted with * [But to
Infants circumcision did agree] where the words OF BELIEVERS are left out,
which should necessarily have been put in thus, But to infants of believers
circumcision did agree. The leaving out of which words, how great an
inconvenience it would bring to the state of the question, etc. every ordinary
capacity will easily conceive.

For answer. Exercit. p. 5.
This Argument (says Mr. T.) supposes baptism to succeed in the place of
circumcision; which may be understood diverse ways.

1 So as that the sense be, that those persons be to be baptized which
heretofore by Gods command were to be circumcised. And in this sense the
argument must proceed, if it conclude to the purpose: But in this sense it is
false, for no females were to be circumcised, which yet are to be baptized.
Act. 16.14, 15. And believers out of Abraham's house, as Lot, Melchisedech, Job,
were not to be circumcised; but believing Gentiles are universally to be
baptized.

We answer. 1. Animadvers.
That collations of the old and new Testament must be adidem, to the very point
in hand, thus; that those persons that are capable of the material sign of
baptism are to be baptized, as those which were capable of circumcision in the
old Testament were to be circumcised by Gods command. But all male infants of
believers of Abraham's race being capable of circumcision were to be circumcised
according to Gods command (unless some extraordinary let stepped in for a time,
as in Moses child, and in the Israelites for forty years in the wilderness)
therefore all infants of believers both male and female, being capable of
baptism, are to be baptized; unless this rule be observed, we shall hardly
allow any deductions from the old Testament, for our use in the New.

2 In our illations and inferences from the old Testament, we must not throw
away all the command upon a promise there, because the New Testaments practice
extends it further upon the same promise. It is affirmative in Genesis 17. that
male infants of believers may have the 1. sign, to wit, circumcision; upon
this ground, that God will be the God of them and of their seed; it is extended
further in practice in the New Testament, that all infants male and female of
believing parents may be baptized; because the promise, I am the God of thy
seed believer, runs as well to females as to males. Act. 2. The promise is to
you and your children, whether male, or female. And there is no impediment in
nature to hinder their capacity of baptism, as there was of circumcision. But
as the mothers were not circumcised, because of natural impediment; so their
daughter infants were not: So in the New Testament, the mothers were baptized,
because there was no such impediment. Act. 16.14, 25. therefore by proportion
their infant-daughters. Chap. 2. in answer to Mr. T. his 4. Except. and 1.
partic.
Or we may say further of female infants circumcision (beside that we said
before) that they were circumcised in their fathers being begotten of them that
were circumcised in their flesh; they were generated of them that had the
filthy foreskin (as it was then accounted) cut off; and so descended of
parents, refined as it were by that natural alteration. Therefore female
infants also may be baptized according to their natural capacity, in person
as formerly they were circumcised according to their capacity, in their
lineage.

3 Always in the analogy between the old Testament and the new, we must in
our allegations keep to the substance; so the Apostles in alleging Scriptures
of the old Testament they kept to the substance, not regarding the
circumstance; as innumerable instances may be given. Take this one, Romans 10.15.
the Apostle proving that faith comes by hearing of a Preacher that is sent;
says out of Isa. 57. As it is written, how beautiful are the feet of them
that preach the Gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things! Now the
place whence it is quoted, Isa. 52.7. is thus: How beautiful upon the
MOVNTAINS are the feet of him that brings good tidings, etc. Because the Word
was to go forth out of the mountain of Zion, Moriah, and other mountains on
which the Temple and Jerusalem stood. Now this place is to be applied to
Ministers now, though they come not upon those, or other mountains; or else the
Apostles proof falls to the ground. So if the command of the seventh day, may
not be alleged for a seventh day, we have no command for the Lords day.

Chap 2. in our answer to Mr. T. his 4. Except. and 1. partic.
To that of Lot, Melchisedech, and Job, we add by way of answer beside that
spoken before: that if Lot, Job, Melchisedech were not, nor were to be
circumcised, there may be special reasons. First, not Melchisedech, alias
Shem, 1. because he was baptized in the Ark, 1 Pet. 3.20, 21. Secondly, he was
to be a special type of Christ, in that he came not of the tribe of Levi that
ceremonious Ministry; and so to be exempted from that ceremony (in the shell)
circumcision. For Lot and Job, God would show in them, that he was not so tied,
but that he could save without an outward ordinance when he will not extend it,
or if he please to take away the opportunity of having it. A fair item for
the Anabaptists that put so much in Baptism, that the want of it (say they)
does unchurch Churches, etc. Lot and Job had churches in their families. And
the Israelites in the wilderness forty years, is called a Church, Act. 7.38.
all which time there was no circumcising among them, nor but two Josuah and
Caleb circumcised, left among them. Josh. 5.

2 (Says Mr. T.) It may be so understood, Exercit. p. 5.
as if the right of baptism then began, when the right of circumcision did, or
was of ^ight to end; but this is not to be said; for John Baptist and the
disciples of Christ baptized, Joh. 4.1, 2. before circumcision of right ceased,
and they who were circumcised were after baptized, being converted to the
faith, as is manifest concerning Paul, Phil. 3.5. Act. 9.18.

Answ. Yet before Mr. T. says, p. 4. that circumcision did sigcifie Christ to
come. Animad.
If Mr. T. pincheth upon that of Christ to come of Isaac, we say we see no more
in the analogy of circumcision nor in the words of institution, for it to
signify Christ to come of Isaac then of Abraham or Jacob.

3 (Says he) It may be understood as if Baptism did succeed in the place of
circumcision in respect of signification; Exercit. p. 5.
which is true in some things. First, it is true that both signified the
righteousness of faith, Romans 4.11. Romans 6.3. Gal. 3.27. 1 Pet. 3.21. Secondly,
it is true, both signified sanctification; and this is all may be concluded out
of the place alleged, Col. 2.11, 12. To which I think it meet to add, that if
the text be looked into, that place speaks not of any circumcision, but of
Christ's circumcision, in whom we are complete, and by whose circumcision we are
said to put off the body of the sins of the flesh: Nor does the text say, we
are circumcised because we are baptized; but we are complete in Christ, because
we are circumcised in him, and buried with him in baptism; in which, or in
whom, ye are also risen together, through the faith of the operation of God
that raised him from the dead.

Answ. If they agree but in those two significations, Animad^.
they agree sufficiently in signification to favor the argument out of Col.
2.11, 12. that baptism comes in the room of circumcision, and fitly; that as
circumcision signified and signed those two to believers infants; so, baptism
now signifies and signs the same to believers infants.

But whether this be all that may be concluded out of the place alleged, Col.
2.12. (as Mr. T. affirms) I shall appeal to the ingenuous Reader of our
observations on this place of Scripture; which are from the analysis, scope,
argument, and method of prosecution: which if not exactly attended, we may
easily feign plausible interpretations for our own turns, but loose the drift
and argument of the Apostle. The Apostles design is to take off the Colossians
from false doctrines of false teachers, teaching with entising words,
Philosophy, vain deceit, traditions of men, rudiments of the world, among which
were the shells of Jewish ceremonies, as circumcision considered in the shell of
the outward sign, etc. And the argument the Apostle uses as the best means to
fetch them off, was to advance Christ's fullness, to the full worth, before the
eyes of their minds. This design, and this manner of pursuance of it are so
often mentioned and repeated combinedly; that they cannot be hid from an ordinary
eye looking upon the text. Once v. 3, 4. again v. 6, 7. a third time v. 8, 9.
Now the Apostle saying ye are complete in Christ, v. 10. (Greek (...) filled
up, or made complete) he intimates, what need the Colossians hearken after
Jewish ceremonies, as circumcision, etc?

Now because the Colossians might object, that Abraham and the Patriarchs had
Christ, and yet were circumcised too, he anticipates and prevents this
objection, v. 11. saying, they had inward circumcision, which is the chief. In
whom also ye (observe the also ye) are circumcised with the circumcision made
without hands, in putting off the body of sins, etc. Your persons are not only
circumcised in the circumcision of Christ (who is as our common nature) and so
imputed to you (as in Adam, the common nature of man, we finned, and so his sin
was imputed to us) but you are circumcised with the virtue of Christ's grace,
signified in circumcision, to make you put off the body of sins (even as Adams
sin was not only imputed to us, but his corruption of sin derived into us).
But because the Colossians might object again, that though Abraham had inward
circumcision before ( Romans 4.) yet he had outward circumcision too, and so
others; and therefore they were not so complete in Christ as believers in the
old Testament. The Apostle preoccupates and prevents this objection too, in v.
12, saying, that instead of outward circumcision, they had been baptized, and
baptized effectually into Christ. Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye
are risen, through the faith of the operation of the Son of God, etc. As if the
Apostle should say, in stead of the outward sign of circumcision, Christ has
instituted another sign, namely, baptism; that circumcision being to be done
away (at Christ's death at least) and this to be used instead thereof; more
significant then the other; for circumcision fitly signified spiritual death
to sin, which is mortification, but baptism is fitted to signify more;
namely, your rising from under the water lively represents your spiritual life
by Christ, your rising to newness of life; and both these have been
effectually signed or sealed to you by baptism; And therefore you are no
longer to call for circumcision, but to use and enjoy baptism in the stead
thereof, as formerly you and your children did circumcision (for the Apostle
hints not the least difference about the subject thereof.) Even as Christ
himself circumcised the eighth day, was after baptized to signify an end now
about to be put to circumcision. This I ingenuously think to be the naked
scope, and plain argumentation and method of the Apostle here in this 2 of
Colos. Which secondly, more appears to us by these two arguments. 1 From the
inconveniences against the Apostles dispute, if baptism does not so come in
the room of circumcision. For first if we have not baptism in the room of
circumcision, to us believers, and our infants, we are not so complete (as the
Apostle affirms) as the Jews, by Christ. Secondly, if baptism does not come in
the room of circumcision, how does the Apostle call off the Colossians from
circumcision, by the consideration of their baptism? How does he truly imply
that as the first Sacrament that believing Abraham and his children received
was circumcision, so the first, the believing Colossians and their children
received was baptism, (no other seal intervening)? How are the Colossians said
to be inwardly circumcised, and outwardly and inwardly baptized in the same
Christ, who in himself put down the one by taking up the other?

2 From the analogy and agreement between both, namely, circumcision and
baptism; which the Apostle hints in this 2. of Colos. First the Apostle
intimates that as putting off the body of sin (which is a phrase to signify
natural death, 2 Cor. 5. and so is here an allusion to signify spiritual
death to sin) is the signification of circumcision. Colos. 2.11. So spiritual
burying (which argues death) is the signification of baptism. Secondly, that
as neither of these are assured to any but as having Christ sealed to them; so
as circumcision sealed an implantation into the death of Christ, that he put
off the body naturally in the grave; so the circumcised put off the body of sin
spiritually; v. 11. Even so baptism signifies and seals our implantation into
the burial of Christ, v. 12. as is more fully expressed, Romans 6.3, 4, 5.

3 That as the way to kill sin, and so to live was by circumcision into Christ
in the old Testament. Colos. 2.11. insomuch that he that should wilfully
neglect outward circumcision for himself or his child that might have it,
should be cut off, Genesis 17. So baptizing into Christ is the way to bury sin,
and so to live. v. 12. of this 2 Colos. insomuch that he that shall wilfully
neglect baptism with water, the seal of regeneration who may have it: shall
not enter heaven. Joh. 3.5. A soul may be saved without the use of a seal in
some case, but in no case can be saved in the contempt of a seal. I am not
ignorant that some do understand this, Joh. 3.5. of the spirit only compared
to water, but who does not know that (as Bullinger says, Omnes pene de
baptismo interpretantur) all almost interpret it of the water of baptism,
Bullinger himself consenting with them, only he would not have the efficacy
of the Spirit, to be transferred to the sign. And sure whiles Christ was
instructing Nicodemus of regeneration, he would not be silent touching the seal
of it, baptism. Nor can we so well parallel this phrase with Matthew. 3.
Baptising with the holy Ghost and with fire; where only the Spirit must be
meant, because there is no other baptism of fire. But there is a baptism,
with water, beside baptism with the Spirit. And therefore water must signify
baptism. For it were harsh to run to a metaphor without need, and to
understand by water the Spirit, which in relation to the efficacy of baptism
is usually called fire.

Thus we have showed out of this Colos. 2. from the scope of the Apostle; the
analogy of the two Sacraments, and the inconveniences of the contrary; that
Baptism succeeds in the room, and to be used instead of circumcision; now let
the ingenuous Reader ponder, and see whether there be not more in this text,
then Mr. Tombs would acknowledge.

To that passage of Mr. T. that Col. 2.11. does not speak of any circumcision,
but of Christ's circumcision, meaning I suppose the circumcision of Christ in
his own person, (for else all circumcision, and baptism too is Christ's, both
in regard of institution; sign, and making effectual) we have answered
already, in the analyzing of the place. The sum whereof was, that not only
Christ's circumcision was imputed to them, but the virtue of circumcision was
inherent in their hearts, by express words of the Apostle, Colos. 2.11.
Circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body
of the sins of the flesh.

To that other passage, that the text, Colos. 2.11, 12. does not say, We are
circumcised, because we are baptized; We answer, and add to our former
intimations, that the Apostle clearly labors to satisfi^ the Colossians from
seeking to be circumcised, because they were inwardly eircumcised; and inwardly
circumcised, because inwardly baptized, according to the outward sealing of
baptism, or else he had not mentioned baptism upon any just ground or
pertinent cause to the point in hand that I can conceive. He tells them they had
no need of circumcision, which was abolished; and had the effect of it sealed
by, and conveyed through or with outward baptism which they had received
according to the order of calling men to be Saints in the New Testament.

In some things, says Mr. T. baptism does not succeed in the place of
circumcision in respect of signification. For first circumcision did signify
Christ to come of Isaac according to the flesh. Genesis 17.10, 21. But baptism
does not signify this, but points at the incarnation, death, and resurrection
of Christ.

Answ. Though we have answered to this before, Animadvers.
on Exercitat. p. 4. yet we add, First, as circumcision did no more signify
Christ to come of Isaac (for any thing that is in the analogy, or form of
institution or administration) then of Abraham: so baptism has in it as well
to signify the true Christ to come of Isaac as circumcision. Secondly, that
ver. 10. of Genesis 17. has nothing in it but what is spoken in common to Abraham
and his seed indefinitely. That v. 21. is not the institution or form of
administration, or any thing to express the analogy of circumcision to the
thing signified, but only a word added touching the making circumcision
effectual, and imports only that Christ is the effect of all Sacraments, he
is he that must establish the Covenant, in all its promises, and seals. In him
are all the promises yea and amen. 2 Cor. 1. He is the seed to whom and in whom
promises were made, and to be made firm. Galat. 3.16. It was not all Isaacs
seed that could establish the Covenant; but Christ. Nor did Christ more
establish as Isaacs seed, then as Abraham's seed spiritually. Genesis 12.3. Genesis
17.7. and Gal. 3.8. Thirdly, that whereas before Mr. T. said, p. 4. of his
Exercitat. that Baptism assures Christ to be already come (to which we
answered, that no such thing appeared in the analogy of water; nor in the form
of administration, to wit, I baptize thee in the Name of the Father, etc. nor
in the use; many being baptized before Christ came. 1 Pet. 3.21. 1 Cor. 10.1, 2,
etc. many before Christ came to act his mediatorship, of doctrine, passion,
resurrection (his incarnation only preparing him, Psalm. 40.6. mine ears have
thou opened, or bored, Hebr. 10.5. A body have thou prepared me.) Now Mr. T.
speaks more warily, Baptism points at the incarnation, death, etc. of Christ.
Well, and how does it point at the incarnation and death of Christ more then
circumcision? Did not circumcision signify Christ to be born according to the
flesh of one circumcised? Did not cutting off of the foreskin and drawing
blood as well point at death, as ordinary afflictions are said to kill all the
day long. Romans 8? Sure that bloody Sacrament did as much, if not more point at
Christ's passion, as a little being under the water and up again did in
baptism. But to signify time to come, or time past, that was only employed in
the time of administration; if either Sacrament administered before Christ's
coming, then it pointed at Christ to come. If after his coming, then Christ
come.

Secondly, Exercit. p. 6.
(says Mr. T.) circumcision was a sign that the Israelites were a people
separated from all nations. Romans 3.1. But baptism signifies that all are one
in Christ. Gal. 3.28.

Answ. And does not baptism as much separate all the spiritual seed of
Abraham and their children from all the Nations unbaptized, as circumcision did
Israel and the proselytes out of every Nation from the uncircumcised? For that
is the difference, Matthew. 28. Go teach all nations, baptizing them. If nations
do not receive this teaching and baptizing, there is the difference that men
can put. And it is as wide, as usually circumcision did put; the Israelites
generally being evil, and very often idolatrous. And it is a question to me,
wishly looking on that place, Romans 3.1, 2, whether their keeping the oracles of
God is not put if not as the special difference. Compare Psalm. 147. last, yet
as the equal difference with circumcision (the Turks, etc. circumcise, but
have not the oracles of God) and then what more is conferred on circumcision,
then on baptism? The Word must go before, and along with a Sacrament, or else
it will appear rather a mixture of heathenish superstition, then a distinction.
And for baptism, it does indeed signify that all we Gentiles with the Jews
that are baptized are all one in Christ, as before circumcision signified that
all Jews with the Gentiles, proselytes, that were circumcised, were one in
Christ. But me thinks the text Gal. 3.28. speaks of Christ as making us all
one. If of baptism, then of baptism as made an effectual means to put into
Christ; and then effectual preaching is as well a means, and so no special
thing is put to advance baptism above doctrine.

Thirdly (says he) circumcision signified that Moses law was to be observed.
Exercit. p. 6.
Gal. 5.3. But baptism does signify that Moses law is made void, and the
doctrine of Christ to be retained. Act. 10.37.

Answ. This seems to import some difference, at some time, and in the shell;
but not always, not any in the kernel. For was not the doctine of Christ, the
doctrine of Moses in substance John 5.46, 47? was not baptism (as we showed
before) instituted, and administered, Mat. 3. etc. whiles Circumcision was not of
right to end till Christ's death three years and a half after: So that though
in Acts. 10. (Christ being ascended) the administration of baptism by help of
that time, might imply, Moses law in the shell was to be done away, yet at
other times before Christ's death it could not signify that Moses law is made
void, signanter precisely (as Mr. T. speaks.) To that, Gal. 5.3. we say that
as Circumcision did signify that Moses his law was to be kept, so the
Passover, and any other ceremonies, a paribus from the like reason, that a
beleiving Galathian would observe one Ceremony out of conscience, ought
likewise observe the rest. So that the Apostle mentions Circumcision only as
being to the question then in hand. And for Acts 10.37. of baptism, we say
that whiles it might any way hint that Mose^ law in the shell was to be done
away, it tied to the observation of it in the substance of gospel meaning. So
in that Acts. 10.37. compare with John. 5. two last. Mat. 28. v. 20. when
teaching them to observe all that Christ commanded, followed baptism.

Fourthly, (says Mr. T.) Circumcision did sign Canaan; Exercit. p. 6.
Baptism eternal life.

This we have answered to before, Animadver.
That Circumcision did sign Canaan as it was a type of heaven, Heb. 4. As
baptism and the holy Supper under material elements signify and give us
things spiritual and eternal.

All this while I cannot see such a material difference between Circumcision
and Baptism in the least to deface the analogy and semblance between the
administration of the one and the other, to beleivers and their Infants, or to
interrupt that consequence from the one to the other. What ever may be urged
against the incapacity of children to be Baptized, may as well be argued
against Circumcision.

By this that has been answered candid men may see what reason Mr. T. has to
deny major, or consequence, or minor.

If this argument be not restrainedly understood an egg is laid, Exercit. p. 6.
out of which manifest Iudaisme may be hatched.

No fear, if we argue as the Apostle argues; Animadver.
who Collofians 2, 11. 12. (as we have cleared we hope) puts Baptism in the
room of Circumcision. If we do not put those things in the place one of
another, which God puts in (though but by practice and example) without looking
for a new institution or command, there being a difference only of
circumstances, I am bold to say, an egg is laid out of which may be hatched
Antisabbatarianisme a nulling of the Lords day, (as is frequent upon this very
consequence, among the Anabaptists) and Exemption of women from the holy Supper
with many the like inconveniences, which we stay not now to name.

But it this kind of Argument, Exercitat. P. 6.
out of Coloss. 2.11. be restrainedly taken, (says Mr. T.) no more follows
thence, but that Baptism and circumcision, in some things signify the same,
which is more plainly said of Noah's flood, 1 Pet. 3.21. Of the red sea, and the
cloud that guided, 1 Cor. 10.2. And yet we say not that Baptism succeeded into
their place; much less do we infer to be instituted in their place.

If Mr. T. restraines Cor. 2.11. whether he pleases, Animadver.
then must it signify but what he lists. But you have already seen the
dimensions of that place to be larger then Mr. T. his measure. As for his WE
say not that Baptism succeeded, I suppose he means Protestant Orthodox
Writers; and then he mistakes (if I mistake not:) For Calvin says that Noah
being ^aved by water, had quandam Baptismi speciem, a certain Image or
representation of Baptism; and this the Apostle minds us of, to the intent
that the likeness between him and us might be the more apparent: so he. Beza
says much more, of which only this: There are two types of the Churches
sanctification, and rising up out of the depth of sin and death; but the
deliverance from the flood was the precedent Type, shaddowing forth the
following Type of Baptism answering to it; in which respect Baptism may be
set over against the cloud, and the passing through the red Sea as the
Antitype to them; So Beza. Dispach bid us quote no more. And the text will
supply all, and clear it to me that Baptism does come by divine right in the
place of the Arc. For Peter calls Baptism the (...), etc.
Antitype to the Arc, that signing salvation, as this does. Now who does not
know that the Antitype comes by divine authority, in the place of the Type.
And for that of the 1 Cor. 10.2. let another speak and not my mouth. Mr Diodat
in his notes says, The meaning of that place is, That as the deliverance out
of Egypt was a figure of the redemption by Christ, and the pilgrimage through
the wilderness, an image of the elects life in the world, and the land of
Canaan a shadow of the kingdom of heaven; So the passing thorrow thered sea
was correspondent to Baptism, and Manna and the water coming out of the rock,
a sign which had some resemblance to the Lords supper: So Mr Diodat. And he
had said true, and if he had said more, for the text would have born^ him out.
For the Apostle being about to warn the Corinthians of sinning in idolatry
etc. like the Israelites, Pareus.
lest they perish as the Israelites, v. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. He prevents in the
2. and 3. verse an objection the Corinthians might make, that we have better
sacraments to keep us from sin then the Israelites had; I would not (says the
Apostle) have you ignorant (not reason so ignorantly) but know that your
fathers (the Israelites) went to heaven (as many as went) the same way, and by
the like means as you the children must go (if you go;) they had like
sacraments in the sign, Pareus.
and the same thing signified as you have. They had their passing under the
cloud, and through the red sea for their Baptism, and Manna and water out of
the rock for their holy supper, both signifying Christ; instead whereof you
you have the washing of water for your Baptism, and bread and wine for your
holy supper to represent Christ. Now seeing the holy ghost did by express
exposition of the Apostle, intend those two to fore shadow Baptism and the
Lords Supper; and tells the Corinthians they had these two Baptism and Holy
Supper instead of them, as of no more privilege in the outward sign; how can
I but conclude that Baptism and holy Supper comes by divine authority in the
place of them?

Mr. T. reckons up many inconveniences that will spring from deductions of
arguments from analogies, Exercitat.. 2.
without the Lords precepts, and the Apostles examples, as the maintenance of
Tithes jure divino; the asserting of Jewish Sacraments to be types of christian
Sacraments; the setting up of a Pope instead of the Jews High Priest; the
giving of the Lords Supper to children, because they ate the passover, etc.

We plead for no analogicall arguments, Animadver.
but such as are countenanced by New Testament scripture. And if the Scriptures
express any Jewish Sacrament, to be any how, or in any degree, types of the
christian Sacraments we must say so, what ever men say against Bellarmine, to
unty him and fasten themselves. We heard before what Calvin, Beza, Diodat, and
Pareus said on those texts of Scripture, whatever some others, to make a shift
may assert universally against Bellarmine, out of a supposed inconvenience in
some particular. And Mr Tombs himself alleged Cameron, that Circumcision
primarily sealed to the seed of Abraham the earthly promise (namely Canaan)
secondarily sanctification. And is not this to make one type to signify
another type? for Canaan was a type of Heaven, Heb. 4. And as we dare extend
analogies as far as the text of Scripture bears us out; so we dare not stretch
them beyond, where the Apostle puts a bar. And therefore we cannot argue from
the childrens eating of the Passover to their partaking of the Communion,
because the Apostles mark of a Communicant is, to be able to examine himself,
before he eats. 1 Cor. 11.

Lastly, Exercitat.
it is to be considered how by these Argumentations, consciences may be freed
from the danger of will worship, and polluting so remarkable an Ordinance of
Christ as Baptism is, specially this care lies on them, who by Prayers,
Sermons, Writings, Covenants and Oaths, do deter Christians from humane
inventions, in Gods worship diligently, and as is to be hoped sincerely.

We retort; Animadver.
Let it be likewise considered how we may be likewise freed from will worship,
in confining Sacramental administrations to such time, age, circumstances,
which Christ never enjoined; and so count the seed of believers all wholly
polluted, whom he never so accounted.

CHAP. IIII.
Exercitat.. 3. The third Argument from the parity of grace in the New
Testament to that in the old examined.
THe third Argument is thus framed.

If Baptism be not granted to the Infants of Believers, then the Grace of God
will be more restrained in the New Testament than in the Old: but this is not
to be affirmed; therefore Baptism is to be granted to Infants of Believers.

Answ. 1. If this Argument be of any weight, it will prove that the grace of
God is straightened, because we give not the Lords Supper to children, to whom the
Passover was given, as appears by that which was said before.

2. The grace of God is not tied to Sacraments, neither do Sacraments give
grace by the work done, and therefore grace is not restrained, though
Sacraments be never granted, grace is not denied to an excommunicated person,
who is inhibited the Lords Supper, the grace of God is free, whether we
understand it of the divine affection, or the effects of it; nor can be made
larger or narrower by our act.

3. Yet it is not absurd to say, that in respect of some privileges, the grace
of God is more contracted in the New Testament then in the Old: For instance,
no family has now the privilege that was granted to Abraham's family, that out
of it Christ should be born; no man besides Abraham is called The Father of the
Faithful; no woman besides one, The mother of Christ; nevertheless, simply
the grace of God is said to be larger in the New Testament, by reason of the
revelation of the Gospel imparted to all Nations, the more abundant
communication of the holy Spirit, and more plain manifestation of the mystery
of the Gospel: I would have it weighed, whether those phrases of the Apostle,
Romans 11.21. as the natural branches, verse. 24. The wild Olive by Nature, were
graffed contrary to Nature. These which be natural branches, do not
sufficiently imply, That the Jews children by their birth had a privilege
beyond the Gentiles children.

In the frame of this third Argument, from Genesis 17. First, Animadver.
these words are very prejudiciously left out in the major or 1 Proposition.
Then the grace of God [ The words unjustly left out.
in the administration of the first Seal] will be more restrained in the New
Testament then in the Old. 2. The word Grace is disadvantageously put for
Privilege.

To Master T. his Answer as he has laid the Argument; and first to his first
Answer: [That we give not the Lords Supper to children to whom the Passover
was given:] We Reply. 1. That he speaks not ad idem to the point in hand. For
this does not take off the straitning the New Testament above the old in the
first seal. 2ly. Our argument proceeds not of Gods limiting, but of men's
straitning; we dispute not against God, but against Anabaptists streitning
where God has not limited. 3ly. Mr T. in his 1 Section proclaims the Latitude
of the New Testament above the Old diverse times: but here he evens them again,
and tells us we have but Quid pro quo, if we have got in the first Sacrament,
we have lost it in the second.


To his 2. Answer, of Gods grace not tied to Sacraments. 1. Here seems to be
an eluding of the true intent of our Argument, by the equivocal acception of
the word Grace: for if any form it of Gods Grace being restrained, it is
rather meant of Grace signifying the favor of God manifested to us, then of
Grace signifying the Graces of Gods Spirit inherent in us. 2. Though Mr. T.
says here Grace is not tied to Sacraments; yet the whole design of his
Exercitation is so to tie them together, that Sacraments without manifestation
of grace are nothing with him. 3. Therefore we retort, That where the first
Sacrament is more inhibited, and restrained, there the favor of God, and the
gifts of grace are less to be expected. And therefore though we cannot
straighten Gods grace in it self; yet we do, unwarrantably, the comfortable
assurance thereof, when we refuse the sign that God has given us, of that he
has or will give.


To his 3. Answer. [That in some privileges the grace of God is more
contracted in the New Testament than in the Old, etc.] 1. We Reply: If we speak
of some particular privileges, it is a privilege of the New Testament, not to
have them; to wit, any of the Jewish Ceremonies. Or that there should be
another family besides Abraham's line of whom Christ should be born. 2. We Reply
that Mr T. has matched one great Old Testament privilege with alike in the
New, if he had but placed it right among the New, and not among the Old.
Namely, [that Mary the mother of Christ in the New Testament, answers to the
promise of him to come of Abraham in the Old.] But if we speak of the
privilege of the New Testament in general, it must be more large than that of
the Old, or else God would never have found such fault with the Old, as in
stead thereof to make a New, Heb. 8.6, 7, 8. Observe in the margent on the 6.
verse, Covenant is rendered Testament by our translation. 3. Upon Mr T. his
confession, That simply the grace of God is said to be larger in the New
Testament by reason; first, of the Revelation of the Gospel to all Nations:
secondly, of more abundant Communication of the holy Spirit: thirdly, of more
plain Manifestation of the Mystery of the Gospel: we retort then, sure
believers in the New Testament have less reason to have a meaner opinion of
their children to reject them farther off from the 1 Seal, then they of the
Old; there being no precept for that rejection.
The Parent knows more, receives more grace now generally, by Mr. T. his
intimation; why then must all this abundance of revelations, and effusion of
spirit fall besides our children, that none should be sanctified in their
tender years as Samuel, John Baptist, and the little ones, Mar. 10. To that
Romans 11.21, 24. We say we have considered it, and advised with learned Authors,
yet neither they nor I can see more then this, That the Jews of whom the
Apostle speaks were natural children (taken in its natural sense) of Abraham,
to whom immediately was the great privilege, Romans 3.2. Of the Oracle of God,
and his promise was immediately viva voce, by express words made and delivered
Genesis 17. and so they had the privilege also to hear sooner of it; and it
continued a long time in their line, in the former ages of the World; and so
had the 1. conveighance of the 1. Seal to them and their children. But
Firstnesse in order or time does not give any more spiritual right to an
Ordinance. Act. 13.46. Nor is it the naturalnesse (see Ismael and his
posterity) but the spiritualnesse of the father (that he be a Believer) that
gives privilege to the child. And therefore we conclude that faith being the
condition of this Covenant Genesis 17. to Abraham (as Mr Tombs confessed before..
1.) and so thereupon the 1. Seal was given to his natural borne infants; So
now a believing Parent by faith being of the seed of Abraham (Gal. 3. Romans 4.)
the 1. Seal by the same proportion is due to his natural borne infants. And
this is all the heft we can find in this place upon weighing of it.

For Mr Tombs his justice in denying the major, or consequence, or minor of
this argument, I leave to the candid Reader to judge from what we have said.

The sum of the Answer to the Arguments, Exercitat.. 3. Conclu.
drawn from Genesis 17.17. is this: The Sacraments are not to be administered
according to rules taken from our reasonings, but Gods appointment. Rightly
does Mr Ball forenamed, in the Book forenamed, Posit. 3. and 4. page 38. say*
But in whatsoever Circumcision and Baptism, do agree or differ, we must look
to the institution, and neither stretch it wider, nor draw it narrower then the
Lord has made it, for he is the institutor of the Sacraments according to his
own good pleasure; and it is our part to learn of him, both to whom, how, and
for what end the Sacraments are to be administered, how they agree, and wherein
they, differ, in all which we must affirm nothing, but what God has taught
us, and as he has taught us.

We close with you taking reasonings for such as are merely depending upon
humane wit, Animadver.
but if they be such as are clearly deduced (according to our best light) from
the Word of God; we can conceive no otherwise of them then as such as hold out
Gods appointment. And such we trust, have been our reasonings with you Mr. T.
on this 17. of Genesis where we find an affirmative precept for giving the 1. Seal
to Believers Infants; but we never found, nor you, nor the Anabaptists for us
yet (that we know off) any negative precept that it should be denied to them:
though we have seen and heard many of the Anabaptists own reasonings.

To that of Mr Ball, Mr Ball himself shall answer in the very same page before
quoted.

Circumcision and Baptism (says he) are both Sacraments of divine
institution, and so they argue in the substance of the things signified, the
PERSONS TO WHOM they are to be administered, and the order of administration, if
the right proportion be observed. As Circumcision sealed the entrance into the
Covenant, the righteousness of faith, and circumcision of the heart; so does
Baptism much more clearly. As Abraham and his household, and the Infants of
believing Jews were to be circumcised; so the faithful, their families, and
their seed are to be baptized. Circumcision was but once applied by Gods
appointment, and the same holds in Baptism according to the will and good
pleasure of God: So far he: Upon which by and by follows the conclusion which
Mr T. quoted. By which we may plainly perceive in what sense Mr Ball spoke
those words quoted by Mr T. (namely for us not against us) what his opinion is
in the Question; and what his sense is of the 17. of Genesis To wit that therein
is an institution and precept for baptizing believers Infants.

CHAP. V.
THe Argument from Act. 2.38, 39. may be thus formed: Exercitat.. 4. The
Argument from Act. 2.38, 39. for Infant Baptism examined.
To whom the promise is made, they may be baptized; but to the Infants of
Believers the promise is made; therefore they may be baptized.

The Minor is proved from the words of verse. 39. for the promise is made to you
and to your children.

That an answer may be fitted to this Argument: 1. It is to be observed, that
the promise made, is the sending of Jesus Christ, and blessing by him, as it is
expounded, Act. 3.25, 26. Act. 13.32, 33. Romans 15.8, 9. 2. That the Text says,
the promise was made to them he spoke to, and their children; then to them that
are afar off, who, whether they be Gentiles, who are said to be afar off,
Ephesians. 2.12. or Jews in future ages and generations, as Beza thinks, are
limited by the words closing the verse, as many as the Lord our God shall
call; which limitation plainly enough shows the promise to appertain to them
not simply as Jews, but as called of God, which is more expressly affirmed,
Act. 3.26. To you, God having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to bless you,
in turning away every one of you from his iniquity: or, as Beza, Every one of
you turning your selves from your iniquities: therefore the promise here is not
said to be made but with condition of calling, and faith, which may be
confirmed abundantly from Romans 4.13, 14.16. Gal. 3.9.14.22. 3. That Peter,
verse. 38. does exhort to repentance and Baptism together; and in the first
place persuades to Repentance, then Baptism; which shows Repentance to be in
order before Baptism. 4. That mention is made of the promise not as of it
self, yiedling right to Baptism, without Repentance, but as a motive inciting
together to Repentance and Baptism.


With the 1. Observation of Master T. in this Answer we close, Animadver.
that the promise meant here, is that which was made to Abraham, hinted Genesis
12. Enlarged and confirmed, Genesis 17. Illustrated, Genesis 22. According to Act. 3,
25.26. Act. 13.32, 33. Romans 15.8, 9. provided that Mr. T. take the 26. Verse of
Act. 33. duly according to the Exposition of the 25. Verse. The 26. v. is, Unto
you first God having raised up his Son Jesus Christ, sent him to bless you,
in turning away every one of you from his Iniquities. The due genuine sense of
which words according to Verse 25. is this: These to whom the Apostle speaks
were children of the Covenant which God made with their Fathers, saying unto
Abraham, And in thy seed shall all kinreds of the Earth be blessed. According
to Genesis 12.3. Genesis 17.7. Genesis 22.18. which Texts do write it as clearly as the
sun beams. 1. That the administration of the first seal of outward
confirmation of this Covenant was given to all the natural seed at least of
believing Abraham's family, and so downward, Act. 3.25. and Genesis 17.7, 9, etc.
keeping within the Church, and not cast out for misdemeanors. Therefore the
same administration of the 1 Seal in the New Testament to all the natural seed
of believing Gentile parents, is held forth by virtue of this text, Act. 3.25.
It comes down to all the kindred of the elect, which could not be in
Circumcision which is abolished in the New Testament but in some thing
analogicall; ergo in Baptism. 2. That the efficacy of this Covenant with
Abraham is to his seed in turning them away every one from their iniquities.
Act. 3.26. According to Genesis 12.3. Genesis 17.22. Genesis 22.18. That in Abraham,
that is in his seed, namely be blessed, even to them his Covenant should be
established. And so by a just analogy, Baptism administered to the seed of
believers should be effectual, where Christ should come in effectually to
turn them from their sins, whether before, or at, or after Baptism, as he
shall think fit.


To Mr T. his 2. particular of Act. 2.39. For the promise is unto you, and to
your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord your God
shall call: We say with learned Camerarius, Sunt (...) haec; this is a short
defective kind of expression, wherein by brevity of speech something is left
out, to be supplied by the reader; So that the whole verse is to be read thus.

For the Free] (...) promisiio vel pollicitatio. Neque enim desunt qui i^ter
polliceri and promittere hoc discrimen statuunt quafi illud de eo quod ultro

free promise of God. And the Article (...) and the composition with (...)

intimated.

near and present and your children you now have] and to them that are afar off
[ distant in Distant] far off in place or affection. It is not so likely that
far off should signify generations of Jews to come, as Mr T. intimates out
of Beza: And Camerarius has a considerable note to this: Afar off will be
understood not only of place, but in mind and judgment; viz. as others, so
Gentiles. And it is so said after v. 40. Save your selves from this untoward
generation: For the future generations of Gentiles must not be excluded. And
the word children does intimate succession of generations of Jews, that it
shall be to their childrens children, if their Parents believe; as it shall now
be to their children present, if they the present parents believe. Beza his
reason (says De Dieu) that a far off should signify future generations of
Jews, not Gentiles; afar off in place or affection, because Peter here
speaking, knew not the calling of the Gentiles till Act. 10. cannot hold good;
because an extraordinary inspired Apostle, and acquainted with the Prophets,
that are full of the calling of the Gentiles, could not be ignorant of the
thing; only he perceived not the time to be so near till Act. 10. Therefore
says De Dieu, I do not unwillingly assent to the great learned men, who
refer the words (...) (those a far off) to the Gentiles, remote from the
Covenant of grace, but in time to be brought near. Nor am I against it, that
(...), that is, to them that are UNTO afar off, and (...), that is, to those
afar off, should be all one. For its plain, that (...) the praeposition,

which you your selves may observe by the several different letters in your
Bibles.
and to their children.]

So that it is not plain, much less plain enough (as Mr T. affirms with much
confidence) that the words, as many as the Lord our God shall call are a
limitation showing the promise to appertain to them simply, not as Jews, but
as called of God. For the intent of the place is, that the promise runs to
believing Jews and their children, as it did to believing Abraham and his
children, in the outward promulgation, administration and signing. But made
effectual when (as in that Act. 3.26. Mr T. quotes) God so blesses the
children as to turn them from their iniquities. And so just to descend down to
beleiving Gentile parents (the seed of Abraham Romans 4. Gal. 3.) and their
natural borne children. But the maine thing expected (I suppose) is to prove
that to the sentence, unto them afar off whom the Lord shall call, must be
supplied this sentence, and to their children. For this, besides all that we
have said in the margent, we give these reasons. 1. The former part of the
verse runs so, the promise is to you and your children: therefore the latter
part must run so too, to wit to all that are afar off that shall be called and
to their children: For it were a strange thing if whiles the Lord is pressing
the same promise, as belonging to them that are near and a far off, Jews and
Gentiles, which God first made to believing Abraham and his natural seed under
the promise, Genesis 17. and pressing it so to be taken and applied here, Act. 2.
that the Lord should mean two different ways, as that it should belong
formerly to believing Abraham and his natural children under the promise; but
now to him, and only his children effectually called: Or that it now belongs
to Abraham's believing Jewish seed, and their natural seed or children under
the promise, and not to believing Gentiles (the seed of Abraham, Romans 4. Gal.
3.) and to their natural children under the promise, I am the God of thee and
of thy seed. 2. If the sentence as many as the Lord our God shall call, be a
limitation of the whole verse, and so to signify that the promise no ways
belongs to children of believing Jews or Gentiles, till those children be
effectually called, let any rational man give a sufficient reason why the
Apostle mentions children: the sentence being full and clearer without that
word, if that had been the Apostles meaning. 3. The Apostle names the promise
to the parents in relation to them before calling; as being the children of
believing Abraham afar off: why then may it not some how much more relate to
their children, when they the next parents are called? 4. The Apostle does
endeavor to comfort the parents that they and their children should be in as
good a condition, by Baptism, though they had crucified Christ, as they were
by Circumcision before they had crucified him. But by Circumcision, the promise
and the first outward sign ran to them and their children: ergo so should it
now, or else the Apostle had beaten them off with an offense, and not drawn
them on with an encouragement.


Those places Mr T. quotes out of Romans 4.13, 14, 16. Gal. 3.9. 14.22. and his
assertion upon them they concern the parents to be signed upon their believing,
with the first Seal, thereby instating their children, whiles children, to the
same; lying under the favor of one and the same promise with the parents: I am
the God of thee and of thy seed.

To the 3. particular of Mr T. his answer to Act. 2. we say that though order
of naming things in Scripture be a very uncertain argument to prove the order
of nature of things: yet we grant the thing it self to be true for parents,
not for their Infants which Mr. T. here does not prove.

To the 4, particular we say that the reason of that is because it is spoken to
them of ripe years, pricked at their hearts. But else the promise it self, I
am the God of thee and of thy seed, or the promise is to thee and thy children
(according to Genesis 17.) is sufficient to give right to them repenting and being
baptized, to conveigh Baptism to their children.

We conclude therefore, 1 That M. T. has not rightly limited the Minor, nor
justly denied it unlimited. 2. That he has not rightly answered to the Major.
To his first reason that the Text is not expressly of infants, but of children
indefinitely: We answer, it is meant according to the places where it is
quoted. Genesis 17. Genesis 22. But those places, by seed and children, understand as
well those but 8 days old, as others. To his 2 reason that the text speaks
not of the children of Gentiles at all, we have answered before in the full
reading of the text to be extended to the children of them that are called,
though formerly afar off.

CHAP. VI.
THe Argument from 1 Cor. 7.14. Exercitat. 5. The Argument from 1 Cor. 7.14.
may be thus formed They who are holy with Covenant holiness, may be baptized;
but so are believers infants holy: Ergo. The Major is not true, universally
understood, as is manifested from Romans 11.6. If the first fruits be holy, the
lump is holy, etc. That is, Abraham is the first fruit and holy root: the
elect Israelites are the branches and lump: so that it follows, that the elect
of the Israelites not yet called, are holy in respect of the Covenant, and are
not yet therefore to be baptized. For although they may be said to be holy in
regard of the Covenant of old entered into with Abraham, and the gracious
respect of God to them to be manifested in time, yet in their present state;
they denying Christ, neither infants nor men are to be baptized, unless we
would have the branches broken off to be grafted in. And therefore though the
sense of 1 Co. 7.14. were your children are holy with Covenant holiness; it
follows not they are to be baptized who yet manifest no shows of divine
grace. 2. The Minor is not proved hence. For it does not speak of federall
holiness, but of holiness, that I may so call it, matrimonial. So that the
sense is your children are holy, that is legitimate. So Master Tombs.

1. To the Major we say; That that proposition is universally true de jure in
equity, Animadver.
though not de facto, in act, when God and man concur to make an exception in
practice. It was de jure in right and equity an universal Proposition, That
every man-child of the circumcised parent shall be circumcised, Genesis 17. So
Ismael is circumcised being a son of circumcised Abraham; but if Ismael in
matter of fact turn scoffer and persecutor of Isaac (Gal. 4.29.) and so be
cast out by Gods command, Genesis 21.10. his children are not circumcised, but
suspended from the actual practice. So this Proposition they that are holy
with federall or Govenant holiness, may be baptized, is by divine right
universally true: but if in practice the generations of Abraham, alive at the
coming of Christ, will not own the SEED of Abraham, Christ, and so renounce
their own Seed-ship; God gives them up in fact to be broken off for certain
generations, Romans 11. Left without the Word and Sacraments of the New
Testament, Act. 13. And yet the jus the equity so holds universally true, that
when they shall turn to the Lord, and own Christ, the children of them the
parents signed with the first Sacrament of the New Testament; I say their
children shall be signed with the same too. Affirmative commands universally
bind semper, though not ad semper, always, though not at every circumstance
of time. To Mr T. his proof of his deny all of the Major out of Romans 1^. we
say: 1. That Mr Tombs cannot make election any footing or ground of the
argument of the holiness of the lump, in relation to the holy root Abraham.
For that were to put aside the Apostles visible argument, and fall upon another
thing secret to God. 2. That would infer, that those Jews broken off, were
broken off of the election (which is impossible). But if relation to beleiving
Abraham be the footing and ground of the Argument, then when the Parents come
in by faith to own Christ their brother, in Abraham, and so their sonship to
Abraham, signed with the first sign appointed at the time of their conversion,
namely Baptism, then the practice interrupted goes freely on again of giving
the same first Seal to the children of all believing baptized parents.


To Mr T. his answer to the Minor, That it is not proved, because the place
does not speak of federall, but matrimonial holiness; we reply, that so Mr T.
says; But in all his tedious Oratorious, not Logical discourse, urging men's
authorities, not his own arguments, or confirmed positions, he does not prove.
Mr T. can easily think that Aquinas a Papist (whom he quotes) and we can lend
him Stapleton too and other Popish authors (no doubt) that will stand stiffly
with him for the advancement of marriage to have in it a matrimonial
holiness; that it may be the fitter to be a Sacrament according to their
interest in the question. And Mr T. can as easily think that if the decision
of the question might be made according to plurality of Votes of Protestant
Authors, we should soon outvote him. Therefore we shall pass by his Protestant
authors and our own, only with this touch. His; That Camerarius does not speak
so punctually whiles he says, Sanctificatur in conjugij legitimo usu; not in
legitimi conjugij usu. The unbeliever is sanctified in the lawful use of
marriage, not in the use of lawful marriage; which latter expression would
have better advanced the pretended matrimonial holiness; and prevented that
the lawful use of marriage, be not taken for an using it according to the word
and prayer, the more likely meaning of this text, by far. Nor does the same
Camerarius hide, or refute another meaning of these Words; viz. a sanctifying
by faith; that is to the believers use, as Mr Tombs his Melancthon intimates
in his own quotations. For Melancthon and Musculus they come not to hand in my
study, nor is it of so much, or have I so much time as to go to them. For our
own authors, if Mr T. had but well weighed one only, Pareus, I wonder how he
should have so mistaken this Text. The meaning of which to me and others,
plainly and heartily is this. You Corinthians (in your Letter to me, 1 Cor.
7.1.) scruple about spiritual pollution, by a believers continuing in the use
of marriage and conjugal enjoyment, since conversion, with a yoake-fellow that
is not yet converted through his or her infidelity, v. 13. But you need not
fear it; for the unbelieving husband has been already sanctified (so in the
Greek) in the believing wife that is since converted since marriage, I say in
the believing wife (so is the meaning plain by the Antithesis, and so it is in
some Greek Copies). And on the contrary the unbelieving wife is sanctified in
the believing husband: so the Greek, and the Antithesis and the Explanation of
some Greek Copies. That is, the unbeliever is sanctified in the believer to the
believers use. That though marriage, as all things are spiritually impure and
unclean to them that are defiled (how?) by unbelief; yet unto the pure (that
is by faith, as the Antithesis guides it) all things are pure, marriage, meats,
all. Tit. 1.15. Being sanctified by the Word (allowing them and promising a
blessing to the believer) and by prayer (of faith) asking a blessing. 1 Timothy
4.4, 5. And this I prove (says St. Paul) by a greater argument: Because your
children (though but one of you Parents be a believer) are holy; I say (...),
are holy; not only as before of the unbelieving parent that he or she is
sanctified and ad hoc to a particular use of the other believing parent; but
are holy, which cannot possibly signify less then the Federall or Covenant
holiness; reckoned generally among the Churches of Corinth to be within the
Covenant with the believing parent (though but one of them be a believer). But
how does Saint Paul prove this last proposition upon which all depends? Answ.
He lays this, leaves this, on a common known practice of the Churches
everywhere, that if but one of the parents were a believer, the children of him
or her were brought to Baptism, as to the sealing, that the children were in
Covenant; of which more in the XIII CHAP. of our Animadversions.

Mean while observe that if the Apostle does not speak here of the holiness of
children, by being reckoned in Covenant, and signed with Baptism, being born
of one believing parent at least, as of a known opinion, custom and practice
in the Churches, the Apostle had gone about to resolve a lesser doubt, by
making a greater. Pretenses against this sense of the place shall be ventilated
and confuted by and by, after we have confirmed this to be the sense of this
place; thus.

This case of the Corinthians must needs be a case not of law, but of
conscience; not of civil polity, but of religion, grounded upon some such case
as Ezra 10.3. where the Israelites having taken wives not of the same religion
with them, make a Covenant with Humiliations, to put away those wives and their
children. For the religious Corinthians men of great parts, 1 Cor. 14. Of a
famous City and of a most ancient Commonwealth, could not be ignorant of the
Law of Nations, That two single persons Legally married, according to the
custom or rules of the State, could not be counted adulterers or fornicators,
or their children bastards, for any difference of Religion between them. And
therefore it being a case of Conscience, about spiritual pollution, satisfies
them by showing the privilege of faith under the New Testament, that all
wives, infants, etc. are sanctified, or sanctified to the believer,
notwithstanding different opinions: To which Beza speaks excellently, Some
(says he) refer this to civil polity, what marriages that makes and accounts
as ratified; so as the children are reckoned Legitimate: But surely Paul
disputes not of civil polity, but of matter of conscience. And what Argument
(I pray you) at last would it be to pacify conscience, that is taken from the
civil Laws of Nations. For in these Laws it is well known, how many things
are tolerated, which a Christians conscience cannot bear. For neither the Law
of divorce, permitted to the Jews by Moses for the hardness of their hearts,
could excuse a conscience from the fault of Adultery.

As for M. T. and his abettors (by him quoted) in reasoning for matrimonial
holiness; and against federall holiness they do not (to me) in any
considerable degree hit the nayl on the head; and therefore is easily plucked out
with ones fingers. Musc. his quotation of Deuteronomy. 23.2. does not show us a place
where a bastard is called unclean; or kept out from any Office in the
Congregation (as he expounds the place) for any Ceremonial uncleanness; but
rather for a kind of civil maimednesse; as those of natural maimednesse, ver.
1. Nor is Musculus his reason [that if conjugall holiness be not here, 1 Cor.
7. meant, it will bring forth a troublesome dispute, how an unbeleeving husband
is sanctified] of any weight. For it is not meant or said, That he is
sanctified in himself, but sanctified in the believing wife, to her use. As
according to Musculus his instance of meat; we say with the Apostle, Tit. 1.15.
They are unclean to the unbeleever, pure to the believer. So is an unbeleeving
yoak-fellow, unclean to the unbeleever, clean to the believer. For the
assertions of Hierom and Ambrose, quoted by Musculus, as Musculus is quoted by
Master T. [That the sanctification of the unbeleeving Parent, be not attributed
to the faith of the believing Parent, but to Gods appointment, that marriage
should be holy.] We say we well know, that the Fathers often too much smell of
the corruptions of the times in which they lived, in opinions of this nature.
Surely the holiness of marriage was never appointed to be holy to any, but to
the first and in the second innocent Adam. And therefore so to us only through
faith. Of the other opinion of things holy by mere appointment from God, are
diverse dangerous consequences: one instance is; Some affirm that faith as a
quality justifies, because it is holy for that use, by Gods appointment
thereunto. To Mr. T. his proof. That holy and legitimate are the same, Because
(says he) holiness is pu^ for chastity, 1 Thessalonians. 4.3, 4, 7. And 1 Timothy 4, 5.
is sanctified signifies is lawfully used. We Answer, That the Apostle calls
chastity holiness when it is wrought by the principle of holiness, namely the
Spirit and the graces thereof; for he speaks to Saints. But sure enough the
Apostle would never call a mere abstinence from fornication or adultery,
holiness. For he says, without faith All is impure, Tit. 1.15. And that 1 Timothy 4.5. signifies more then lawfully used, as a carnal man may use his meat
and drinksoberly and for a good end, to fit him for his calling: namely, it
signifies thus much; That meats, etc. not prohibited, are sanctified by the
Word, allowing them to us, and giving us believing in that Word a right to them
in Christ, and by the prayer of faith we sue out a blessing upon them.

But Mr. T. Objects, That it is not said, 1 Cor. 7.14. The unbeleeving husband
is sanctified in or by the believing wife, but in or by the wife. Nor is it
said that the unbeleeving wife is sanctified in or by the believing husband,
but in or by the husband; the Apostle purposely so speaking, that the reason of
sanctification may be intimated to be taken, not from the faith of the
yoak-fellow, but from conjugall relation.

Answ. The Sir. Text prevents all imagination of this conceit; reading the Text
according to the true meaning, thus: That husband which is not a believer, is
sanctified (...) by the wife (...) which is a believer. And that wife which is
not a believer is sanctified (...) by the husband (...) which is a believer. 2.
There are two Greek Coppies that Beza saw, have it, (...) In the believing
wife. And (...) (which Mr. Tombs not forgetting should not slight. 3. Hear
reason: The Apostles purpose sure enough is to comfort believers, married with
unbeleevers. And it is as sure; that the Apostle lays the ground of that
comfort of the believing husband in his condition of husband as oppositely
distinguished from his unbeleeving wife; and the comfort of the believing wife,
in her condition of wife, as oppositely distinguished from her unbeleeving
husband. For (says he) the unbeleeving husband is sanctified in the wife.
What wife? What can we answer, but the beleiving wife? And so of the husband.
Now seeing the Apostle lays it in a proper peculiar privilege, which is
sometimes in the husband, to wit, when he is a believer and the wife not. And
sometimes in the wife, when she is a believer and the husband not; It must
needs be, that the foundation of the comfort intended by the Apostle is laid in
faith, peculiar but to one of the couple, and not in marriage that was equally
common to both. And that faith does rather sanctify marriage, then marriage
sanctify the married persons. A harsh phrase for a Christian, That civil
marriage is a sanctifier; either to sanctify two unbeleevers (which by Mr. T.
his consequence it must) or to more-sanctifie a condition to one that is a
believer.

But Mr T. observes further, That 'E^ is not rightly rendered by in the old
Latin, and our new English Translation; as if the faith of the wife were the
cause of sanctifying the unbeleeving husband. For no man will say the faith of
the believing wife sanctifies the unbeleeving husband federally, so that the
unbeleeving husband should be capable of Baptism by his wives faith, (which
yet, by the good leave of such men be it said, does as well follow from this
place, as that the son is federally holy, and capable of Baptism for the faith
of the parent.) Neither can it be said, that the Parent is sanctified with
spiritual sanctification, by the faith of the wife.

We Answ. To render (...) by, is tolerable; seeing the Apostles do very often
Hebraize and make (...) to answer to (...) in Hebrew, which often signifies by
Sanctificat^^^ est vir qui infidelis est, in uxore fideli, i^^^ est, per.
Hebraismus. Sanctificataesi mulier quae estinfidelis in viro fideli, id est,
per. Hebraismus. So Tremelius in his Translation of and Notes upon the Sy^.
But we regard not whether it be rendered by or in, that is in or through the
beleiver his faith, the unbeleiver is sanctified to him; still it will stand
good that faith may as well be the isntrumental cause of a lesser thing;
namely, of sanctifying an unbeleeving husband to a believing wifes use, as it
is an isntrumental cause of a greater thing; namely, of justification, Romans
5.1. And every one may boldly say, that the faith of the beleiving wife
sanctifies the unbeleeving husband federally in this sense, to wit, as all
outward things that have no holiness in them, meat, drink, clothes, carnal
friends, etc. may be called federally holy to a believer; that is, that they
are and shall be for a believers good and comfortable use, by reason of the
Covenant she is in with God; though her faith cannot sanctify her unbeleeving
husband federally for the Sacrament of Baptism. 1. Because the line of the
Covenant runs not To thee believing Woman and thy husband; or, To thee
believing husband and to thy Wife. But to thee believing parent and thy seed.
2. Because whiles the woman is a beleiver; the husband is said here to be a
known unbeleever, And whiles the husband is a beleiver, the wife is said to be
a known unbeleiver, according to this, 1 Cor. 7.14. And all unbeleevers known
to be such, by apparent Scriptures are not to be accounted federally holy, so
as to belong to the Seal of the Covenant. 3. Mr Tombs affirms after that the
unbeleeving husband is sanctified TO the believing wife. The sanctification is
not to her (as the Covenant of the father is to the Infant) but to her the
believer.
Which three Reasons makes me look on Mr. Tombs his comparison as a very
strange one, as if not well weighed, before it was uttered, viz. That it does
as well follow, says Mr Tombs, from this place, that the unbeleeving husband
is federally holy so as to be capable of Baptism by the believing wives faith;
as that the son is federally holy, and capable of Baptism for the faith of the
Parent. But let the candid Reader look back on what we have said on this, 1
Cor. 7. or look forward to the Scriptures, and judge whether this be not a very
uneven comparison.

It is further objected by Mr T. that in this 1 Cor. 7. (...) IN THE WIFE) is
more rightly rendered in Latin in the Dative (as TO THE WIFE. But we ask Mr
Tombs in what latin is it so rendered? Not in the old lat. that is by. Not in
Vatabl, that is also By. Not in Beza, that is in. Not in the Sir. that is also
by. If you mean is to be rendered, or may or might be rendered better in the
Dative TO, for which you bring seven instances. 1 We answer that those
instances may be tolerably (at least) rendered in the ablative notion IN
according to the note there of (...) In. As Gal. 1.16. To reveal his son
(...) IN ME, that is not only by the sound of the word to me, but by his
spirit and the graces thereof, and the effectual illuminations and operations
of both experimentally IN ME. So 2 Pet. 1.5. Giving all diligence add (...) in
your faith, or through your faith virtue, that is that the rest of the graces
may come in into faith, or through faith, into the soul, or that virtue may be
in faith. As it is said Galathians 5, 6. faith (...) inwardly effectually
working by love; That is Faith is effectual faith when true heart warming love
is in it, breaking forth in act. Jam. 2. Mr Tombs does know, that virtutes
connectuntur moral virtues are connexed, much more when by a higher principle
of the spirit, they are made theological graces; and he does know that there
are general directive virtues (justice and prudence) as the eyes to all the
rest, as master veins to all the lesser; And therefore all virtues are said to
be knit together in prudence; So all graces in faith. If the understanding and
the will be (as some learned will) the same faculty really, and the soul
infused by the concreation of God at once, yet in order of working the act of
understanding is first in nature. So though all the graces be but one habit,
infused at first at the same time; yet faith in Christ is first (as the Apostle
setts it first in this 2 Pet. 1.5.) in order of acting, or of applying Christ
for additionall infusion and augmentation of graces, which is Peter's business
in hand. And so faith adds virtue: virtue comes into the soul, in and through
faith. So Act. 4.12. There is no other name under heaven given (...) in men,
into men (effectually) or extant in the midst of men, among men. So 1 Cor.
7.15. But God has called us (me and you Corinthiaens) (...) in peace, into
peace settled us in a state of inward peace. So Math. 17.12. Elijah is already
come (that is John Baptist) and you have done (...) in him whatsoever ye
would, you have have chopped the axe into his neck; you have exercised your
cruelty upon him. So lastly, Act. 7.44. The Tabernacle of witness was (...),
in the Congregation or Church of our fathers in the wilderness, As they then
are said to be a Church v. 38. 2 We answer to Mr Tombs his assertion (upon
these instances) that if (...) be rendered, or better rendered To the wife, in
(the dative case) it disadvantageth us nothing in the meaning of this text
which before we have asserted. But helps us to Mr Tombs his confession, to
agree with us now (contrary to his former struggle) in this, that the
unbeleeving husband is not any how sanctified in himself, or to himself by
the believing wife; but is sanctified only to her. And therefore is not
sanctified from any thing common to both: But sanctified to her qua believer as
she is a believer, and opposite to his condition of unbelief, and therefore
her faith has the only stroke under Christ and his Spirit to sanctify the
unbeleeving husband as sanctifying is here meant.

Thus we have wearyed our selves and perhaps the reader in a long answer to a
large argument. Yet in some sense, Non suns long a quibus nihil est quod demere
possis. The rest which Mr Tombs speaks to this argument, is built upon this
as to be granted (as he says) that matrimonial holiness must needs be here
meant; which we cannot grant, but can overthrow, and we hope have so done,
though we have not said all that may be said. Only one thing Mr T. adds which
is not founded upon his imagined supposition: Namely, whereas Beza (says Mr
T.) inferrs that if matrimonial holiness should be the sense of this place,
the Apostle should draw an argument from civil laws to pacify conscience: Mr
Tombs answers that the Apostle using his Apostolical authority resolves the
doubt in this chapter, and teaches that according to Gods law, and Christ's
precept, the marriage is not dissolved by the infidelity of either yoke fellow,
etc. To which we reply, that the Corinthians could not scruple about, not be
ignorant of that, which for many ages was notoriously divulged throughout the
Gentile World, by their civil laws. They knew well enough who were adulterers
and formicators, who not, by their politic laws. But their scruple is
whether conjugall companying with an unbeleever did not spiritually pollute the
believer. In this the civil or politic laws of men were silent and could not
resolve it: And the rules of civil marriage could not satisfy; it being
matter of faith.

CHAP. VII.
THe Argument from Mat. 19.15. Mar. 10.14.16. Luke 18.15, 16, 17. may be formed
in diverse manners: Exercitat.
First thus; S. 6. The Arguments from Mat. 19.15. for Infant Baptism, examined.
They are to be buptized, whom Christ commands to be brought to him, being
moved with indignation toward his disciples that repelled them.

But Christ commands Infants to be brought to him. Ergo. That this Argument may
be examined, it is to be considered: 1. Who they were that brought these
children. 2. What little children they were that were brought. 3. Upon what
motives. 4. To what end. 5. What time. 6. In what place they brought them. 7.
For what cause the Apostles did repel them. 8. For what cause Christ being
angry with the Apostles, commanded them to be brought.


In many of these we have scarce any thing beside conjectures which we may
follow, neither have I leisure or books to look into all things which
Commentators have discoursed concerning these heads.

As for the 1 it is supposed that the bringers were either parents, or other
believers, who at lest wished well to the little children; which is probable
from the end for which they brought them, to wit, that he might bless them,
and pray for them; for this shows faith and love.

As for the second, it is probable they were children of Jews, because this was
done in the coasts of Judea, Mat. 19.1. Mar. 10.1. But whether the parents of
the children believed in Christ or otherwise, is not manifest.

As for the third, concerning the motive, there is little certain, whether it
were upon the sight, or hearing of that which Christ did Mat. 18.2. or from a
custom among the Jews, of seeking the blessing of Prophets and holy men for
their little ones, as Rebekah for Jacob, Joseph for his sons; or from the fame
of things done upon the prayers of Christ; or an instinct from God, that
occasion might be given of teaching the things that Christ taught upon this
matter; or some other motive.

As for the fourth, the end is expressed by Matthew, that he might put on hands
and pray; by Mark and Luke that he might touch them, which tends to impart a
blessing.

As for the fifth, Matthew points at the time, by the particle [then] and both
Mark and Matthew, put it after the dissertation with the Pharisees concerning
divorce, and the answer to the Disciples exception, which Mark testifies was
made in the house; Luke puts it after the parable of the Publican and the
Pharisce, but he is wont to relate things out of their right place. But what
the holy Spirit does intimate, by noting the time precisely, I guess not,
unless perhaps he would have it noted that an occasion was opportunely
ministered of amplifying the argument concerning making a man's self an Eunuch
for the Kingdom of heaven, though this reason does not very much like me.

As for the sixth, the place is intimated, Mat. 19.1. Mar. 10.1. in the coasts
of Judea, beyond Jordan, in Mat. By the farther side of Jordan, in Mark; about
which it avails not to our present purpose to inquire.

As for the seventh, the reason of repelling, is not known, but by conjecture,
it is probable this bringing of little children, was troublesome to them,
either because it did interrupt Christ's Speech about marriage, and fitness to
the Kingdom of heaven, or because they sought rest in the house, or because
they did think this bringing would be in vain.

As for the eighth, Christ without doubt, was angry with the Disciples, because
they hindered the occasion of doing good to men, whereas Christ went about doing
good, Act. 10.38. And in this business the faith of the bringers was to be
cherished, and the power of blessing in Christ was to be manifested, and the
excellent doctrine to be delivered concerning little childrens being capable of
the Kingdom of heaven, of the quality of them who receive the Kingdom of
heaven; but whether Christ would that this fact should remain as a perpetual
rule for baptizing the Infants of believers, is yet a question. It seems
scarce probable it should be so.

1 Because Baptism of Infants, being merely positive, so obscure and doubtful
an institution, is without example and reason. 2 Because we find no practice or
hint in Scripture, which may expound this fact to this sense. 3 Because, if he
had given a command to the Apostles of baptizing Infants, he had rather said,
bring the little children to me, then suffer them to be brought to me. 4 He had
declared whose Infants he would have baptized, and not have spoken so
indefinitely, it is certain, before the command, Mat. 28.19, 20. There is no
precept extant, concerning baptizing Gentiles, much less concerning baptizing
the Infants of the Gentiles. 5 The words, suffer and forbid not, and (...) these
little children, as Beza reads, show that Christ's words are meant only of those
children. 6 If this fact pertain to Baptism, the^ we must say, that Christ
baptized; the contrary whereof is said, Ioh. 4.2. As for that which is
objected, that 3 Evangelists rehearse this fact, that thence a perpetual rule
may be drawn, of bringing Infants to Christ by an outward Ordinance, which is
not done but by Baptism, it is weak: For, 1. Three Evangelists rehearse the
bringing of the palsy man to Christ, the access of the leprous person to
Christ, and many other things, from which yet no perpetual rule is formed. 2.
If any rule be hence to be formed, that is to be perpetually observed, this
relation will serve more fitly to establish Episcopal confirmation, by laying
on hands, and praying, then Presbyteriall baptism.

Secondly, we must distinguish, concerning bringing to Christ; there is a
bringing to Christ, by local ad motion, there is another bringing to Christ by
spiritual instruction; this bringing to Christ, is the cause of Baptism, not
the other: for many were brought by the command of Christ, to Christ, as the
blind son of Timaeus, and others, of whose baptism, or conversion we read not;
for not all that were corporally healed by Christ, were also spiritually
healed, as we are to say of the nine Lepers, Malchus, and others.

3 The Argument supposes they may be baptized whom Christ commands to be
brought; but neither is this true of spiritual bringing, for not those whom he
commands to be brought spiritually are to be baptized, but those whom he has
brought. As for that which is said, that they are repelled from Christ, that
are repelled from baptism; It is a light thing, for baptism does not bring
men to Christ, unless the persons be first in Christ. Neither is therefore any
man repelled from Christ, because he is not baptized, but when he is kept back
being sit for baptism. The Argument therefore is answered by denying the
major, universally taken.

Mr. T. here reports diverse forms of Arguments out of these places of Scripture
quoted by him, Animadvers.
and some of them he represents to us very lamely formed, and therefore the
easilier put off by him; but among all, not one so formed, as was wont among
us, where I have been. I will urge therefore one form which perhaps will break
the edge of most that Mr. T. has answered here; and then I will consider what
more is considerable in his answers to the forms he has set down. Our Argument
is this.

To whom indefinitely as such, heaven, and the blessing of and for heaven
belongs, to them as such the seal of conveighance, or confirmation of heaven
and that blessing belongs. For if the land be mine, the deeds and seals of
conveighance are mine:

But heaven and the blessing of and for heaven belongs indefinitely to such
little children, more, whiles little children; so the texts here expressly. To
them belong, or (which is all one) of such is the kingdom of heaven, and he
took them in his arms and blessed them. Therefore to little children
indefinitely belongs the seal of conveighance, or confirmation of heaven, and
the blessing of heaven, which in the New Testament, according to the time
Christ spoke, is Baptism.

Obj. Say the Anabaptists, S.D.
though it be thus said of these little children, yet not of all.

Answ. Therefore we said to little children indefinitely, and so to be applied
to all such as these are; as it is said in these texts of such is the kingdom
of heaven, etc. even as election, and the promises of the Gospel were
indefinitely so and so propounded in the Primitive times but to those then; yet
by the same reason as propounded to them, just so to be applied to us. Now
doubtless THE, or THAT same seed of Abraham, to wit, Christ, means such little
children as agreed with the tenor of the Covenant to his father Abraham:
namely, little children whose parents were reputed believers. And therefore
these things spoken by our Savior belong indefinitely to the like little
children. As Mr. T. confesses after that Mr. Beza renders it of these and the
like infants.

Obj. But, S.D.
say the Anabaptists, here is no mention of Baptism.

Answ. But our argument infers Baptism. 2 Here is mention of, and doing of an
after-higher thing then baptism, namely, confirmation of them by prayer, and
imposition of hands This Mr. T. confesses in express words after in his
answer to the 2 form of argument from these texts, p. 19. of his Ex^rcit.
. Now, if Christ speaks of, and does such after higher things to such little
children whiles little children, how much more may that which in nature
antecedes and goes before these, namely, baptism be administered to them whiles
such little children?

For the clearing this of imposition of hands, learned Pareus has these words
on Hebr. 6.2. Some, says he, conjoyn the two heads of Baptismes, and
imposition of hands; because as there were two ranks of Catechumeni, catechized
persons, so there was a two fold innitiating ceremony. 1 Those of ripe years of
the heathen did before their baptism recite the Articles of the Creed,
touching the Christian faith. And this was the catechizing or doctrine of
Baptismes. 2. The Infants of Christians, who by the right of the promise were
baptized in their infancy, who being past their childhood, were received into
the Church by imposition of hands, where or at which time they first recited
the same heads or Articles of faith before the Church.
And this was the doctrine of imposition of hands. So Pareus.

So Calvin, Bullinger, August, Marlorat, Hofman, Theophylact, only they spoke
more home, if you precisely observe their words, which are [C] these, The
doctrine of Baptismes, imposition of hands, and of the resurrection of the
dead, and the last judgment ought to be read conjoynedly, with a certain
Apposition (as the Grammarians call it) in this sense; Not laying again the
foundation of repentance, of faith in God, of the resurrection of the dead,
which is the doctrine of Baptism, and Imposition of hands. Therefore if you
include in a parenthesis these two sentences, the doctrines of Baptismes and
Imposition of hands, the context will run more fluently. For unless you read
it appositively, this absurdity will follow, that the same thing will be twice
repeated. For what is the doctrine of Baptism but that which he here reckons,
to wit, Of faith toward God, of repentance, of the last judgment, and the
like. The solemnities and standing set days of baptizing he calls Baptismes in
the plural numer, [T] otherwise there is but one baptism in the Christian
Church. Ephesians. 4.5. [C] He joins together with baptism, the imposition of
hands, because as there were two orders of catechized persons, so there was a
double ceremony. For those that were foreigners without, did not come to
Baptism, before they had made a confession of their faith. In them therefore
catechizing was wont to go before Baptism. But as for the children of
believers, because they were adopted from the womb, and by the right of the
promise did appertain to the body of the Church, they were baptized when
Infants. But being past infantie, after they were instructed in the faith, they
offered themselves also to catechizing, which in these followed baptism. But
another symbol or sign was applied to these, namely, the imposition of hands.
[A. M.] of which there was a various use [H.] For by imposition of hands
sometimes Christ, sometimes the Apostles cured the sick. Luke 4.10. Mar. 16.18.
Sometimes by imposition of hands the holy Ghost was conferred. Act. 8.17. [B.]
Also the hands of the Pastors were imposed upon those to whom, and to whose
faithfulness was committed the care of the Church, or the Ministry of the
Word, 1 Timothy 5.21. [C] Imposition of hands also was a certain solemn right or
manner of praying, of which the Apostle here speaks. ( Hebr. 6.2.) For by this
symbol or sign (of laying on of hands) they would approve that profession of
faith which young youth coming out of childhood, did make. Therefore this place
alone abundantly testifies that the original of imposition of hands came down
from the Apostles. Thus far these learned men's words reasons and
Scripture Proof. See more in Marlo. on 1 Timothy 5.21. But we may not omit Mr.
Cotton, because he is in such credit with Mr. Tombs, that he often respectively
quotes him as for himself in his Exercit.

Mr. Cottons words on Hebr. 6.2. are these. Way of C^u: of N.E. Chap. 2. p. 27.
of 1 edit.
There be that conceive, and that not improbable, that in ancient time the
children baptized in the Church, were not received to the Lords Supper, nor
into the full fruition of all Church-liberties, until that they being grown up
to years, did publicly before the Church profess their faith, and ratify the
covenant made for them in baptism, and so were confirmed (as they call it) in
their Church estate; which was not done without imposition of hands; which some
judicious Divines have conceived to be one cause why imposition of hands is
reckoned as one of the six principles of the foundation of Christian Religion,
Hebr. 6.2. For it could not be a principle of the foundation of Christian
faith; it must therefore be a principle of the foundation of Church estate, and
order. Now then if all the members of the Church were anciently confirmed in
the full fruition of the Church estate by imposition of hands, then there were
none of the members of the Church, but had received imposition of hands, much
more the Ruling-elders, who over and above the former were ordained to their
public office, by imposition of hands; and so having received imposition of
hands themselves, they might more freely lay hands on others. So Mr. Cotton.

By all this it is clear, that this imposition of hands by Christ on these
little children in the texts before quoted, Matthew. 17. Mar. 10. Luke 18.
according to the order set down by the Apostle, Hebr. 6.2. did succeed and
follow after their baptism, as supposed and granted to be baptized before.

Obj. But say the Anabaptists, it is in the text, of such is the kingdom of
heaven; that is, of men like infants.

Answ. 1. We heard before how Mr. Beza renders it of these and the like, as
relating to little children. And his grave and learned pious judgment is as
much to be credited as any Anabaptist, in saying it is so or so. 2 The Greek
Authors do often take (...) such, for hoc, this. Bud. Constable. Plaet.
3 If rendered such, its far more natural, and not so far fetched to say of
such little children of whom the story is, then of such men. But fourthly, come
to reason. Christ, Mar. 10.16. speaks of them whom he took up in his arms,
Pass. Vessius.
( (...) of (...) and (...), an arm. Luke 2.28. of (...) ulna. per epenthesin
literarum (...).) But he took up not the men, but the little children into his
arms, and laid his hands upon them, and blessed them; therefore of them he
spoke, and showed that heaven and the blessing of heaven belonged to them. 5
That by discourse upon this, v. 15. Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of
God as a little child, shall not enter therein, is also for us. For the thing
and the comparison must agree in the main scope; but men must as little
children receive the kingdom of God. Therefore little children are in a
capacity of that kingdom. 6 If we argue but from Christ laying on of hands
upon the little ones, according to their intent that brought them, v. 13. and
blessing them; this is an argument sufficient that he meant that blessing, and
consequently (if but from blessing) heaven did belong to those little ones. For
(...) laying his hands in them, must needs agree to (...), little children, not
to (...), whosoever will not receive the kingdom as a child; by reason of the
gender, and number.


That objection of some Anabaptists, that Christ took them up in his arms of
mercy; not of his body; is too frivelous (turning the naked history into an
allegory) and not worthy of an answer.

Now let us see what is left considerable in Mr. T. his answer to the first
form of Argument out of Matthew. 19. Mar. 10. etc. as he reports the Argument.

To his position (after his long Analysis of these places) That it is a
question, scarce probable, whether Christ would have this fact remain as a
perpetual rule for baptizing the infants of believers. We answer. That the
argument, as Mr. T. presents it to us, does not say so: but only intends to
show all things to have been in them that were necessary to put them into a
capacity, to receive baptism. And that they are supposed here to have been
before baptized, before they were brought to this higher addition of imposition
of hands, and blessing.

To Mr. T. his 1, 2, 3, Reasons of that his conclusion, we likewise say, that
the argument does not drive at an institution of baptizing infants here that I
can perceive in the words.

To his fourth Reason our reply is: It is intimated here that Believers infants
should be baptized, as we showed but now, in our form of argument from these
texts. And Christ speaks very indefinitely in Matthew. 28. (quoted by Mr. Tombs)
the grand place of Antipaedo baptists. When Mr. T. says there is no precept
extant concerning baptizing Gentiles, I suppose he means not absolutely. For is
it not said, Matthew. 28. Go baptize (...), all the (Gentile) nations, and
therefore the Gentiles are not excluded. Or else the Apostles and Evangelists
must be condemned for baptising the Ennuch, the Centurion, etc. without a rule.
Or if Mr. T. means no rule extant here in Matthew. 19. Mar. 10. Luke 18. we have
touched already, that the words of the argument do not extend thither. For Mr.
Tombs his other expression in this fourth Reason, That there is no precept
extant concerning the baptising the infants of the Gentiles; If he means this
absolutely, we have showed the contrary already out of Genesis 17. Matthew. 28. Act.
15. and shall I trust speak more. If he means no precept here, Matthew. 19. Mar.
10. Luke 18. he speaks not to the argument.

To Mr. T. his fifth Reason, we say that (...) cannot be certainly rendered,
those little ones ( istos puerulos, as Beza once has it). For first the
article is innumerable times redundant, and supervacaneous. Secondly, that if
intended for an emphasis here, it would sound in my ear more harmoniously to
the scope of the text thus; suffer those little ones, that you despise, because
little ones; for I esteem them; for of such, etc. So that the emphasis relates
to their age, little ones, not to their number, just those and no more. It ayms
at their kind of condition, not individualitie of their persons. Thirdly, for.
Mr. T. his authority of Beza, though in Matthew. 19.14. he renders (...) (istos
puerulos) those little ones, of which our best English translation takes no
notice though the Translators much regarded him, yet the same Beza, in Mar.
10.16. Luke 18.15. twice renders the same Greek phrase (...) puerulos, little
children, without any those or the like term.

To Mr. T. his sixth Reason out of Job. 4.2. it is not to any thing in the
express of argument, as Mr. T. has given it us. For that which follows, that
some of us should object that three Evangelists rehearse this fact, that thence
a perpetual rule may be drawn, of bringing infants to Christ, by an outward
ordinance, which is not done but by baptism. To which Mr. T. says it is weak
for three causes he alleges. Our reply is, we could wish from our heart, Mr.
Tombs would have quoted where these arguments be, if in print. For we hardly
come by this little time (as dear bought) to give these few Animadversions; and
so have none super-abounding to look over all the books in Town of this
argument to find a clause. Or else that Mr. T^mles would present us with every
argument at first in full, that we might know whether it be the same man's
prosecutions, or whether Mr. T. picked it up elsewhere. I intend not to justify
extravagancies; or to make a substance of every circumstantiall expression,
that falls from any man's mouth, or pen. Or to say he fights with a bilbo-blade,
when it is but a bulrush. But this I may say to the particular now in hand,
that it is not nothing, that three Evangelists rehearse this fact of Christ's
blessing and promising heaven to little children. That still they were brought
to him for an outward ordinance, imposition of hands, that that ordinance given
to them, did suppose a former, namely, Baptism (as we have showed). And
therefore if a little child be brought for the first ordinance that he as such
is capable of (as children were of circumcision) it must be to baptism. And
this may be a rule.

To Mr. T. his first cause against the objection in his sixth Reason, we say
only this, that though 3. Evangelists rehearse the bringing of the palsy man
to Christ, yet Christ does not bid any to bring him, or further him to him; as
he did of these little ones when he saw them kept off; as knowing he had
imposition of hands and blessing for them, which he had not for many others.
Christ did not only cherish their faith that brought them (as Mr. T. affirms)
but also cherished that baptism the children had received, and as Mr. T.
confessed in the close of his Analysis, further manifested (out of his own
mouth) that these little ones were capable of heaven. And yet thus much is to
be said of the palsy man, that Christ seeing the bearers of him to uncover the
roof of the house, yet neither he, nor the owners for his sake reproving that
wrong done, which was a special intimation of invitation, it proved in the
event, that Christ had a great ministerial ordinance to be administered to him,
namely, to pronounce to him the forgiveness of his sins, Mar. 2.9. And from
such instances as these, if Christ were now upon earth this rule might be
drawn, that believers children, and poor sinners should be welcome to him. And
if they, or by the help of their friends, showed much desire of coming to him,
in their special endeavor thereunto, Christ encouraging, or conniving at
their crowding toward him; sure it would fairly forespeak that they should get
some spiritual good by one ordinance or another before they returned.

To Mr. T. his second cause upon the objection in the fourth Reason, we have
only this. First, that if these texts, Matthew. 19. Mar. 10. Luke 18. will form
a perpetual rule for confirmation of children by imposition of hands; then it
will suppose, that they are first baptized. Secondly, that confirmation as
confirmation You heard of the original and manner of Scripture imposition of
hands before, though after abused in later ages. See Marlo. on Hebr. 6.2.
, is not Episcopal, no more then Baptism of believers infants is
Presbyteriall; but both are Scripturiall (if I may so speak to echo to Mr. T.
his distinction.)

To the third cause in answer to the objection in this sixth Reason only this;
that this argument may well suppose that they had been baptized whom Christ
commanded to be brought to him, and so commends this to them, That theirs is
the kingdom of God, and blesses them. Yea can Mr. T. himself suppose less
then that they were fitter for baptism, then many of the Jewish children for
circumcision. And if fit matter (as is the Anabaptists own phrase) why not to
have that for which they are fit.

Obj. O but there was no manifestation of their fitness.

Answ. Christ manifests it of children indefinitely, that of such is the
kingdom of God; and to them is the blessing. And if Christ commands them to be
brought spiritually, then sure his command prevails to make them to be brought
spiritually. And if any be justly repelled from baptism (the first seal) sure
they can be no less then repelled from Christ for that, and for so long.
Matthew. 3. And if baptism (taken in its full latitude) as an ordinance of
Christ may not be said to bring any to Christ, to close with him; sure it
cannot be properly said to bring them to Christ, after they be in Christ; but
rather to confirm them in him.

To his denying the major; we say the major is universally true, if taken
according to the sense and circumstances of the Scripture upon which it is
grounded, namely, that Christ is most willing they should be brought to him,
and commands them to be brought, to the end to pronounce them blessed, and tells
us they are fit for it, heaven being theirs. But if the Proposition be taken as
in the express of the text, indefinitely, there is no universal proposition
to cross it, as that no infants may have the first seal.

Secondly, says Mr. Tombs, the argument from these texts, Exercit. p. 19
Matthew. 19. Mar. 10. Luke 18. for baptizing infants is this. Those whom Christ
embraced laid his hands on, blessed, may be baptized: But Christ embraced
infants, etc. therefore.

Answ. This argument (says Mr. T.) supposes these acts of Christ, to have
been all one as if he had baptized. But this is said without proof. In very
deed that act of blessing was more then Baptism, Note.
and yet it had not the same reason with baptism. Job. 4.2. Christ did not
baptize, but his disciples. But that blessing was an act by which he obtained
some singular gift from God, by prayers for those infants, upon whom he laid
his hands. Nor is this benefit said to be bestowed on them for the faith of
their parents, but of singular favor with Christ, as Lazarus with his sisters,
John the Apostle, etc. therefore the major proposition is to be denied. For
there is no connection between this fact, which is extraordinary, and the act of
ordinary ministry, which is to be fulfilled, according to the Lords
prescription.

We answer to Mr. T. his preamble before his answer. Animadvers.
1 That it does not appear by the argument, nor by report, nor by any thing
that I have read, that the Author of this argument or any else ever held, that
this fact of Christ in blessing the little ones, etc. was all one with
Baptism. 2 That this fact does suppose a fitness in infants for the lesser,
viz. Baptisine, that are fit for the greater, namely blessing, as here (which
Mr. T. now confessed to be greater then baptism.) 3 This does suppose that
these infants (as Mr. Tombs here calls them) had received baptism before they
were blessed thus by Christ. For we find many impositions of hands in the
Scripture; but conferred on none that I know, but on such as formerly had been
baptized, yea supposed to have grace. See before, in our form of argument on
these texts of Matt. 19. Mar. 10. Luke 18. and the learned on Hebr. 6.2. 4 That
their baptism was bestowed on them for the faith of their parents, their
parents being by all means to be supposed to be believers living in the Church
of the Jews and circumcised; and now they (for who more likely) bringing their
children to Christ after the Jewish custom, as to some great Prophet, these
children after their baptism have this blessing bestowed upon them. 5 I do not
find where or what that is Mr. T. means touching Lazarus and his sisters, and
John. But Mr. Tombs will not find us a place or particular where any were
blessed by Christ, with this solemn form of blessing, which was not only by
lifting up of hands in prayer; but with laying down of hands upon them; but by
all circumstances it presupposes baptism, if not a manifestation of grace
too. 6 Mr. T. will not find any imposition of hands for spiritual use upon any
in the New Testament but on such as by all means must be supposed to have been
baptized. As in the old Testament the Patriarks laid not their hands of
blessing, but on those that had been circumcised.


Secondly, to Mr. T. his deny all of the major Proposition, as if there were no
connection between this blessing and baptism. We say first, there is a
connection in the things, as between the foundation, and the edifice, as between
first and second, the second supposing the first. And there is a connection in
the argument a fortiori. If the greater be done, which is not done till after
the lesser; then the greater supposes the lesser as its introductorie.

To the touch, that this blessing by Christ by imposition of hands was
extraordinary: 1 It was not extraordinary, that is unusual, for it was
customary with the Patriarks and Prophets to lay on hands, and bless them that
had the 1 seal, circumcision. 2 If extraordinary signifies supernatural, so is
every ordinance, both in the institution, and efficacy supernatural. 3 If
extraordinary be put here to signify extraordinary gifts, above ordinary
saving grace, or the increase of it; there is nothing in these texts to make it
out. For here is nothing to represent the same but confirmation of saving
grace; other miracularie or supereminent gifts to act withal, were not given to
children, that we read. 4 That though imposition of hands did sometimes
signify and conveigh extraordinary miraculary gifts, and callings to offices
upon men; yet imposition did betoken usually, ordinary grace and things for men
and children as we showed before, and more might be showed out of Hebr. 6.2.


The third Argument which Mr. T. presents to us (as ours) out of these texts of
Matthew. 19. Mar. 10. Luke 18. is this. Exerci. p. 19.
They may be baptized, whose is the kingdom of heaven. But of infants is the
kingdom of heaven. Erge.

1. Mr. T. Answ. The Major (says he) is true, if it be understood of those
whose is the kingdom of heaven, when it appears the kingdom of heaven belongs
to them. Secondly, It is not said in the text [of infants is the kingdom of
heaven] but of such it the kingdom of heaven. And Christ expounds what he
means, Mar. 10.25. Euk. 18.17. to wit, of them who in humility of mind are
like little children, as it is Matt. 18.3, 4. but if [of such] be to be
expounded as Beza would annotat in Mat. 19.14. [of these and the like] as
above, Mat. 18. it is not proved from thence that the kingdom of heaven
perteins to all infants of believers, but to them whom he blessed, and to those
persons who either are so blessed, or are converted, and humble as little
children. Whence we deny, first, the major if taken universally. Secondly, the
minor as it is put indefinitely.

We answer. To what Mr. T. says in the first place. Animadverse
1 That Mr. T. his answer to the major is a mere repetition, if not a begging
of the question, that none whiles infants are to be baptized?

2 There was a contrary rule in the old Testament, and part of the New, that
infants of reputed believers should have the first seal of circumcision.

3 There is no such rule for limitation (as Mr. Tombs mentions) expressed in
all the New Testament, That none may be baptized till it appeared the kingdom
of heaven belonged to them, as Mr. Tombs means. For he must mean a certainty
of appearance, or else he says little to purpose. For federall right was an
appearance in the old Testament. I have no list now to dispute upon the faith,
or confession mentioned usually at the baptizing of men by John Baptist, and
some others: Their words short and general, that Christ was the Son of God; or
that they were sinners, and their affections cold, for any good fruits we can
find that followed from most toward Christ all his life time, or to his
disciples, but many times bad; some called Disciples falling off from Christ.
Job. 6.66. Others such, as though called believers, yet Christ would not commit
himself to them, knowing what was in them. Joh. 2.23, 24, 25. Ananias, Saphira,
and Simon Magus foully falling away anon after their baptism. But this I would
fain know of the Anabaptists, all things considered, first, whether there be a
rule in the New Testament, in so many words (as they require for infant
baptism) touching baptizing people of ripe years, and enjoined upon them before
their baptism; as may put it out of doubt, or at least make a close spiritual
discovery, that to them did belong the kingdom of heaven? Secondly, whether it
be not as good an appearance that the kingdom of God belongs to the infants of
a standing professor (manifesting his faith by many spiritual experiences)
because it is said by God, I am the God of thee, and thy seed (which I trust
Mr. T. will acknowledge to be true in the New Testament to believing parents to
apply it to themselves concerning their infants) as is that appearance that the
kingdom of God belongs to a sudden confessor of ripe years, that he is a
sinner, that Christ is the Son of God, that he desires to be baptized, heard
and seen by man's senses but since yesterday, or the day before, or a short time
since? I appeal to the general practice of the Anabaptists in their
re-baptizing, seriously to understand what I say. I know how some would
heighten that general confession that Christ was the Son of God; from the
opposition made against it in Christ's time. But let them not forget that if
this confession by their grant went along with baptism, that then it was
entertained as well as baptism. And the chief Priests and Elders of the people
durst not say John's baptism was from men, For they feared the people Matt.
21.25. Mar. 11.29.
, lest the people should stone them Luke 20.6.
. The people were got to such a head, as to hurl away fear of being baptized,
according to the concomitants thereof: multitudes coming from all parts to be
baptized, Matthew. 3. none controuling, that we read, yea the Sadduces and
Pharisees also offered themselves to baptism, ibid. Matthew. 3.7. And for
Christ, the Rulers durst not take him on the feast day for fear of an uprore
among the people. Matthew. 26.5. Add to all, that at John's baptizing the
multitudes, there is no mention of any thing, but of confessing their sins; and
that they might do without any show of danger of persecution; and many wretched
men may do, and have little right to the kingdom of God.

Again we answer to that Mr. T. speaks, Secondly, thus. 1 That Mr. T. does not
stand to his exposition of that sentence, Of such is the kingdom of heaven, not
to signify infants but humble men. For Mr. T. speaks after, with an [if] if of
such be otherwise to be expounded, then so and so he answers. Atque iter
explorat. Mr. T. does but try, which way he may go; which nay I will be driven.
2 Though we have said much already See before on our form of argument, on these
texts, Matthew. 19. Mar 10. Luke 18.
for proof that of such must relate to the infants, yet we now add this: 1
That of such is the kingdom of God, is given as a reason why the disciples
should suffer little children to come unto him; For (says he) of such is the
kingdom of God. Now this would have been but a strange piece of sense from
Christ's mouth; suffer little children to come, etc. For heaven belongs to
humble men of ripe years. 2 That therefore the reason may hold good, children
must at least be included in such as a part. 3 That little children must be
mainly included; because these are propounded as the original as it were; the
humble men but the copy. These men do but write after those infants as their
sample or pattern.



Obj. But Mr. T. says, Christ expounds the word such, Mar. 10.15. Luke 18.17.
of men who in humility of mind are little children.

Ans. Mr. T. must not call Christ's occasional discourses, and allusions,
expositions. See Luke 14.15. For at a civil feast he takes occasion to speak
of a spiritual eating in the kingdom of heaven; yet this is not the exposition
of that. A multitude of like instances might be given. So when Christ says
here, Mar. 10.15. Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little
child, shall not enter therein. It is spoken occasional, as in a parenthesis,
which may be left out, and the sense of the story of blessing the little
children, as to whom heaven did belong, stand full and perfect. Or as that
which may be put last, as done last after Christ's whole speech and action to
the little ones, and so it is put last, Luke 18.17. spoken by Christ to quip
those that kept off the little ones from Christ (as esteeming them, or the
motion of bringing them to Christ, contemptible) as if Christ said to them, you
had need look to your selves that ye be so happy as little children, etc. By
all which it appears that this speech about men is not of the body, or
substance of the solemnity of blessing the little ones, or of the doctrine why
they should be permitted to be brought to Christ, but is only a circumstance,
and cause made to the standers by. As for Mat. 18.3, 4. there is not a tittle
of Christ's blessing little ones; but the pride of the disciples occasioning
Christ to set a child before them for a text, out of which to preach humility
to them.

Obj. But lest this exposition of such, that is, humble men, should not stand
firm, but fall before some such reasons as we have given, Mr. T. provides
another exposition: That of such must not signify all infants of believers,
but only them whom he blessed, and those persons who either are so blessed, or
are converted and humble as little children.

Answ. 1. Christ does not say, (...) of these, but (...), of such. 2 Christ
speaks indefinitely; who shall presume to restrain him with Ifs and Ands? The
Apostle says, Act. 2. more precisely to you are the promises; yet may not we
apply that to us, when we are pincht in heart for sin? being whatsoever things
were written before, (as the Apostle speaks, Romans 15.4.) were written for our
instruction, or learning, that we through patience and COMFORT of the
Scriptures might have HOPE, for us and ours. 3 What ever persons else this may
be extended to, by Mr. Tombs, that does not exclude other believers infants.
Posita una affiematione, etc. one affirmative does not take away another.


For Mr. Tombs his denying major or minor, we leave the Reader to judge by
that which has been said. Those on whom Christ laid his hands, must be
supposed to have been baptized before. Or if Mr. Tombs could evince they were
not, contrary to the custom of the Scriptures; yet they must be as fit or more
fit for baptism then imposition.

CHAP. VIII.
THe Argument from the place, E^cercit. Sect. 7. The argument from Act. 15.16.
etc. for Infant Baptism examined.
Act. 16.15.32.33. Act. 18.8. 1 Cor. 1.16. is thus formed: If the Apostle
baptized whole households, then Infants; but the Apostle baptized whole
households, Ergo,

Answer. This Argument rests on a slight conjecture, that there were Infants
in those houses, and that those Infants were baptized, whereas the words of the
Text evince not these things, yea, those things which are said, Act. 16.32. He
spoke the Word of the Lord to him, and to all in his house; and verse. 33. He
rejoiced, believing God with all his house. Act. 18.8. Crispus believed the
Lord with his whole house, do plainly prove, that under the name of the whole
house, are understood those only that heard the Word of God and believed.
Whence it is answered by denying the consequence of the major Proposition.

We reply. Animad.
If this be but a slight conjecture whether there were Infants in these
houses, why do the Anabaptists proclaim with such confidence, that for certain
there was none; and that there is for certain no instance in the New Testament
of any baptized? Me thinks they should leave it at least uncertain, when they
say it is uncertain. 2 It is not so slight a conjecture to all, as to Mr.
Tombs, whether there were children. For the Sir. in the story, Act. 16. has
it (...) He, the Jailer, (...) and the children (...) of his house, Vid.
Schindl. de voce, (...). and Buxt. Sure enough a son of eight days old, is a
son. And if sons of the house, then some sons of the father of the house, what
ever notes may be put on the text different from the words in the text. 3 It is
not so plainly proved, that under the name of the whole house, children or
infants are not understood: First, because when the holy Ghost mentions house,
it means children too, if there be no express exception. Genesis 50.22. (for they
abounded with children, Exodus 1.) So 1 Timothy 3.5. for there is mention of the
children, v. 4. I omit many other instances for brevities sake. Secondly, where
by house, children are not included, they are expressly excluded. Genesis 50.7, 8.
And Joseph went to bury his father, and all the house of Joseph went, only
their little ones they left in Goshen. Numb. 16.32, 33. And the earth opened
her mouth, and swallowed them up and all their houses, and all the men that
appertained to Korah. Numb. 26.11. notwithstanding the children of Korah dyed
not. Thirdly, it is distinctly said, Act. 16.32. that Peter spoke the word to
the jailer, and to all, (...), IN his house, which is more then to all OF his
house. The holy Ghost makes some such distinction, Romans 9.6. They are not all
[Israe that are [of] Israel. So that all IN the Goalers house seems to be put
to include those prisoners at large, and others that were not of his family,
but only in his house at that time; by reason of the hurry and noise of the
prison open, etc. running together to see what was the matter. Fourthly, He
spoke the Word to all in his house, is a speech that may not absurdly in some
proportion be extended to children, when something by it redounds to children,
(as it is said John leaped in the womb of his mother Elizabeth, And Elizabeth
was filled with the holy Ghost at the salutation of Mary. And Act. 2. The
promise is to you and your children; for they should be the better for this.)
The Word was spoken, was extended to the goalers children, in that by his faith
they were nearer to and in a readier capacity of salvation, then before, when
the father was an enemy. What means else that v. 31. Believe THOU and thou
shall be saved, and THINE HOUSE. Can we possibly exclude here some that were
not able to hear the Word distinctly? Fifthly, it is said signanter, acuratcly,
and by way of distinction for him and his, (...), And HE was baptized, and all
THOSE that were HIS. How can this be true; if those children he had were not
baptized? And therefore Mr. Tombs was too bold to speak that latter clause,
That it was a slight conjecture if any infants were here, that they were
baptized. If they were in this house, as sure they were baptized, as that they
were the Goalers. Sixthly, to that ver. 34. He rejoiced, believing God ^^^h all
his household (which is one of Mr. Tombs his evincing arguments) we say, that
the Greek must be accuratly heeded, that we may speak just so as the Spirit
spoke. For first, that which diverse render confidently with all his house, is
but (...), an Adverbe; which signifies neither with, nor his, nor house, but
throughout, or over all the house or family 2 That the pointing, and placing of
the words in the English does not answer so well to the best Greek copies as it
may. For the Greek copies that Arius, Pagn, old lat (which follows an ancient
Greek, and therefore very considerable in its various readings of words and
points, says learned Usher) put away the point at rejoiced, so that no more
can be evinced but that which is in the words, which is this. HE joyed with
exultation or triumph over toward or throughout all his house or family, HE
having believed God. So just according to the true idiom, and propriety, and
order of words, in all Greek copies, and according to the pointing in the best;
reason assenting, for why did he exult, or skip (as in a dance of a Galliar as
the Greek imports) with triumph: but because he believed. He believing rejoiced
triumphantly; He rejoicing with triumph, his families joys were raised and
lightened; even children smile, when the parents rejoice. Let them therefore
look to this, that mash the Text, and un pronounce, unperson, and unnumber the
words, and dispoint the sentences, as if it were to be read, the Jailer
rejoiced because all his family actually believed. 7 That though Mr. T. answers
to Crispus, yet nothing to Gaius Co^sult. 3. ep. of Joh. v. 1. And the new
Notes on the Bible upon it.
(for sure he had a family as well as Crispus) nor to the family of Stephanas.
Is any Anabaptist sure there were no infants in these families? Or that they
were not baptized? why then do they put it upon us, as an infallibility, that
no infants were baptized in these families, or any else? For that of Crispus,
Mr. T. and I must leave it as we find it. It appears not evidently in the
Grammar of the words that Crispus was baptized.

CHAP. IX.
SOme other Arguments occur, Exercitat.
which make a number without strength.

Why then does Mr Tombs reckon upon ciphers? Animadver.
(...), Exercitat. 5. The Argument from general promises for Infant Baptism
examined.
it is argued from general promises made to the godly and their seed, Exodus
20.6. Psalm. 112.2. etc. Whence it is gathered, That God makes a difference
between the children of the godly and the wicked; that he promises blessing to
those, not to these; therefore the children of the godly are to be baptized,
not the other.

Answ. The promises recited, are first general and indefinite: secondly, for
the most part concerning corporal good things; thirdly, with the exception of
free Election; fourthly, to be understood with the employed condition of faith
and repentance, and so they serve not to this purpose.

We Reply, to the first: If general and indefinite from God, Animadver.
therefore not to be restrained by men from all those God mentions.

To the second, If for the most-part concerning corporalls, yet Mr T. dares not
say altogether: If some spirituals meant, it is to the purpose: secondly, In
Exodus 20.6. The judgments there on sin must needs signsfie those that are
spiritual; therefore, by the Antithesis, spiritual mercies must be
understood. Thirdly, In that 112. Psalm. v. 2. To expound that, The seed of the
upright shall be blessed, that is, with outward things, were to say they should
have no more then what multitudes, if not most of wicked men's children have;
which in Gospell-English were to say, they are cursed. Their table may be made
a snare, Psalm. 69.22. And these are the ungodly that prosper in the world,
Psalm. 73.12.

To the third: That the promises to men of ripe years also are with the
exception of Free Election. So Romans 9.18. Speaking of them that stood in
opposition over against rebellious Pharaoh.

To the fourth, we say: first, That promises must be considerable in the eyes
of men, so as to come and wait under the pressing them, or else they will not
be comfortable means to work actual faith and repentance in them. Secondly,
That Mr T. cannot say that Infants are incapable of faith: For if John Baptist,
whiles a child, was full of the holy Ghost; sure he had that fruit of it,
faith, in the habit. And those little ones Ghrist blessed, could not be blessed
without union with Christ, which is by the spirit of faith.

Secondly, Exercistat. 9. The Argument from Isa. 49.22. for Infant Baptism
examined.
from Isai. 49.22. it is foretold that Gentiles should therefore the Prophet
foresaw in Spirit the baptism of the little ones of the Gentiles.

Answ. First, little ones might be brought for other ends then baptism, as
Mat. 19.15.

Secondly, I will use the words of Francis Iunius in his Annotations on the
place, All these things are said Allegorically, of the spiritual amplification
of the Kingdom of Christ, as the Prophets are wont; they are fulfilled in the
persuasions in which the Gentiles exhorted their children to embrace Christ.

We Reply. Animadver.
To the first: That Infants in that place, Mat. 19.15. were brought for an
higher thing then Baptism (as we showed, and Mr T. confessed before on that
Text) therefore might be brought to a lower. viz. Baptism. Secondly, sure they
should bring their children to the congregations of the Churches, to which
Kings and Princes shall submit spiritually (as Constantine, etc. did) and this
the Gentile parents should do, for their children in bringing them, upon the
lifting up of Gods hand and Standard; that is, the preaching of the Gospel,
(as Mr T. his Iunius note son that place:) And therefore must bring their
children whom they were fain to carry in their Arms, and on their shoulders,
for somewhat these children might have from the Gospel, (or else as good they
had been left at home in the cradle or bed:) And there is no former or lower
Ordinance for children then the first Seal, as in the Old Testament, so in the
New.

To the second: The words of Iunius: We Reply, first, So the Gentiles might
exhort their children; but it must be long after they ceased to carry them in
their arms, and on their shoulders; when they could more then go of themselves.
2. Take Calvin's words into the balance with Iunius. The Prophet pronounces,
That the children of the Gentiles should be given to the Church. But how, if
not in and by the first Ordinance (if not the least) Baptism? Exercitat. 20.
The Argument from 1 Cor. 10.2. ^isme examined.


Thirdly, from 1 Cor. 10.2. All our Fathers were baptized, therefore also
Infants.

I answer, first, if this verse prove that Infants were baptized, the verses
following will prove that they received the Lords Supper.

2. The sense is not they were formerly Baptized with the right of Baptism
begun by John, and Ordained by Christ; but that by a like representation, the
sea and the cloud signify Salvation to them by Christ, as Baptism does to us;
and that they were in like condition, as if baptized.

We have said a little to this Text before in Chap. 3. In reply to Mr T. his
Answer to Coloss. 2.11. we add, Animadver.
In reply to Mr. T. his first Answer. First, That it was not so necessary, nor
so probable that the sucking children, that lived on their mothers milk, and
the milk of the Herds driven along with them, should eat Manna and drink
water; as it is infallible that they were baptized in the red Sea and in the
Cloud.

Secondly, It is said expressly, They were all baptized in the cloud and in the
sea, but not that they all ate the Lords Supper, either because the Infants did
not eat the Manna, and drink the water of the rock; or that there might be no
hint for us to carry children to the Lords Supper; but hearken to the rule, Let
him that will eat of that worthily, examine himself, 1. Cor. 11.

Thirdly, If Mr Tombs could prove that the Jews Infants did eat the Lords
Supper in the wilderness; it being then not against the rule for children that
could eat flesh and bitter herbs (and therefore were of some age) to eat the
second Sacrament, the Passover; yet this makes nothing for Mr Tombs, that we
should be afraid to say They were baptized: For we can say boldly That there is
no express command to forbid the Baptizing of children; and yet it will not
follow that Infants must receive the Supper too under the New Testament,
because there is an express rule to forbid it.

To the second Answer of Mr T. We Reply, first, That they were really baptized
in the cloud and red sea; and with a Baptism instituted by one greater then
John; namely, by that Rock that followed them, or went along with them, CHRIST,
1 Cor. 10.4. And this Baptism had the precedence in seniority, and of bringing
the first tidings of the New-Testament-Baptisme. Yea the cloud had a capacity
to resemble as well the baptism of the fire of the Spirit (of which the Jews
were aware, as appears in the Rabbis Commentary) as of water; and the Sea
called the red Sea, being so by weeds or other wise had an aptness to sound
of, and resemble blood; and therefore no less fit to be the Symbols or
Elements of Baptism, then river water now.

For the two last lines of Mr Tombs his answer. Namely, [But by a like
representation, the sea and the clould signified salvation to them by Christ as
Baptism does to us, and that they were IN A LIKE CONDITION, as if they had
been baptized] We need say no more but to thank him for them. For if the Sea
and the cloud signified the same salvation by Christ, and that according to the
mind of Christ, whose Text the 1 Cor. 20. is; and that they were in the like
condition as if baptized with New Testament Baptism, and called baptism by
divine authority; and the Jews are said in regard of it, to be baptized; and
that it did represent the State of the New Testament: I know not what material
thing can be alleged to enervate and weaken the Argument, that as the Jews
children and Infants were baptized in the cloud and the red sea; so may the
children of converted Gentiles be baptized with water under the New Testament.
Mr B. his objection, that it was extraordinary Baptism, makes for us. For if
the Jews Infants were capable, and did in the Old Testament partake of
extraordinary Baptism; then sure it cannot be denied to Believers Infants in
the New.

Fourthly, Exercitat. 11. The Argument from Ephesians. 5.26. Examined.
from, Ephesians. 5.26. Mr T. represents to us our Argument, thus. It is said there
that Christ cleansed the Church, with the washing of water, through the word.
Therefore Infants either belong not to the Church, and so are excluded from the
benefit of Christ's death; or they are to be baptized.

Mr T. his Answer is: If this Argument be of force, the thief crucified with
Christ, and repenting on the cross, Infants, Catechumeni, Martyrs, etc. dying
before Baptism, are excluded out of the Church, and from the benefit of
Christ's death. We are therefore to say, That either the Church is taken for the
more famous part of the Church, or that purification is to be understood of
that which is for the most part.

Our Reply is: First, That the process of the Argument is not of an
impossibility preventing Baptism; As in the Thief, the Infants of Believers,
Catechumeni, (that is, heathens or unbeleevers children catechized for
Baptism) Martyrs, newly converted, that were prevented by death, before
possibly baptism could be duly administered to them. For in such cases, where an
Ordinance cannot be had, God does save without an Ordinance, by his Royal
Prerogative: But the Argument proceeds of a voluntary exclusion, upon man's
judgment, judging infants of believers unfit to be admitted to baptism; and
so these absurdities will follow against such excluders. That Infants of
believers belong not to the Church, and so nor Christ to them. For these go
together, Ephesians. 2.12. Where (...) must be understood of the Church-policy,
Church Priviledges, not the Commonwealths policy, or else Commonwealth must
be understood as including, or twisted with the Church.

To Mr T. his distinction of the more famous part of the Church, we Reply.
First, it is a venterous speech to say that any part of the Church is infamous;
or to say that Christ has no Ordinance, as alove expression, and care for his
Lambs, his less famous ones, which is manifested in his charge to Poter, John
21. And Mat. 19. Mar. 10. Luke 18. expressed in his welcoming, and blessing
little ones; and in that, this speech, Ephesians. 5.26. The relative, IT REFERRS to
the Church in the former verse, Christ gave himself for the Church. Now did
not (I pray you) Christ give himself for the Infants of believers indefinitely?

To Mr T. his distinction [for the most part] we say: first, That if Mr T. can
so easily coin that distinction here, why might he not before, when he said
that all the households, or the whole households heard the word, or rejoiced.
Secondly, whether or no the many children, that most believers have, may not be
taken in within the most part. For sure Mr T. does not mean purified for the
most part, for then he grants a supposition, That Believers and their children
are purified in some part.

Fifthly, (says Mr T.) They argue from 1 Pet. 2.9. Believers are called a
chosen generation, a holy nation, Exercitat.. 12. The Arguments from 1 Pet.
2.9. Examined.
which things are said of the Israelites, Exodus 19. (...), 6. Therefore
believers of the Nations obtain the same birth privileges, which the
Israelites had, and therefore the children are within the Covenant, and to be
baptized, as the children of the Israelites were to be circumcised.

Mr T. his Answer is, first, If this Argument proceed, it will follow that
there is some National Church among the Gentiles, as of old among the Jews,
which is not to be granted, which I would have understood in this sense, There
is now no such Nationall-Church, as amongst the Israeliets, so as that a person
should be accounted a member of a Church, in that he is an Englishman, Sco^,
Dutchman, etc. In this speech JOPPOSE NOT THEM WHICH AFFIRM, Note.
THE OUTWARD GOVERNMENT OF THE CHURCH SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO NATIONAL SYNODS.
Secondly, Exodus 19.5, 6. God speaks not of a privilege flowing from birth,
but Obedience. Thirdly, The Epistle was written to the dispersed Jews, and
therefore the Argument lies liable to exception, when it is drawn from that
which is said of the Jews, as if it were said of the Gentiles. Fourthly, The
sense is, ye which believe, ver. 7. whom God has called out of darkness, are
a holy Nation, whether Jews or Gentiles, by spiritual regeneration, as
believers are called a family, or kindred, Ephess. 3.15. The household of faith,
Gal. 6.10. The house of God, 1 Timothy 3.15. A people, 1 Pet. 2.10. Wherefore in
this family, kindred, house, people, are only believers, whom not carnal
birth, but spiritual, causes to be reckoned in that number.

We Reply, Animadver.
to Mr T. his first particular, thus: The Argument in my eye does not proceed
to suppose some National Church among the Gentiles. For it does not say [The
Nations of beleevers] but [The Believers of Nations] obtain the same birth
privileges. Besides, it recites a text written to the Jews who were scattered
(from being a formal Nation) throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and
Bithynia, Chap. 1. v. 1. And when they were a formal Nation, a person was not
counted a member of that Church quatenus ipsum precisely as he was a Jew, but
as he was circumcised, or the Infant of one circumcised, and so to be
circumcised also. A Jew was cut off, if not circumcised according to the
institution to Abrabraham, Genesis 17. And a Gentile though a Gentile was a member
of that Church, if circumcised, Ibid. Genesis 17. Just as an Englishman, as an
Englishman, was not reckoned a member of the Church, or Churches in England, if
unfit to be Baptized, but kept out; or a damnable Heretic after Baptism, but
was cast out; or if one be not the Infant of one baptized. Though Mr Tombs
seems to oppose National Churches, yet he sets them up thus far (wherein
those of his judgment in the Question in hand, I mean the ANABAPTISTS WILL NOT
APPROVE Mr TOMBS) That the outward government of the Church should be SVBIECT
to NATIONAL SYNODS. Nor will Mr Tombs please himself with the direct
inference that will follow from his express words, which inference is this;
That if a National Synod in England, shall determine that Infants of Believers
shall be baptized, whiles Infants; Mr. T. must SVBIECT to it, and lay down all
his Exercitat. Examination, and Appendix against the baptizing of believers
Infants, as labor in vain, cancelled writings, an old Almanac. For Mr Tombs
has not, in a matter of so great consequence, reserved to himself (by any
express here) so much as this exception, That he will not SVBMIT, in case they
determine contrary to the Scriptures in his judgment; but that he will have
his liberty to stand out against the determination. If any can at the first
sight of this, suddenly divine, and Edict by Proclamation, that this exception
was supposed, it may be as suddenly and rationally argued back again, that this
would have been sooner understood of the vulgar, and readier been believed of
the wiser, if it had been here expressed. But if they will have it supposed,
then the Question will be, first: Whether Mr T. according to his design, has
prevented all offense to any of whom he would be rightly understood touching
National Synods? Secondly, What greater thing has he said than diverse others,
with whom yet he does not (for ought I know) close in point of
Church Government?

To Mr T. his second reply, touching Exodus 19.6. That the place being spoken to
the parents (suppose upon condition of obedience) does no way infringe, that
the children of those obedient parents, should be counted of that holy Nation,
that is, among the reputed holy of that Nation, witness their Circumcision,
and their no-capacity of disobedience.

To the third particular we reply, That this Epistle being written to the
dispersed Jews, leanes pronly for application to the Gentile-beleevers, that
though they are as a dispersed people among the unchristian. Christian
called-nations, yet their Infants with them are to be accounted (indefinitely)
holy, as the children of circumcised Jews were counted holy.

To Mr T. his fourth particular, we reply, That there is nothing in it that
does evince, that the children of the regenerate should not be accounted
federally among the believing Gentiles of the more more glorious New Testament,
as among the Jews under the shadowed Old Testament.

Sixthly it will be answered (says M. T.) that the Church of God Exercitat.
fails not; 13. The Argument from the Churches sailing, if Infant-baptsme be
not lawful, Examined.
But we must say the Church of God has failed, if Baptism of Infants be not
lawful: Ergo.

Mr T. Answ. 1. The Church of God may consist without baptism, as in the
crucified converted thief, etc. Secondly, neither perhaps, is it necessary to
be said, that the baptism of Infants because not lawful, is therefore null.
Thirdly, there was in the Church Baptism of persons grown, in all ages:
Ludov.Vives in his Comment. upon Aug. de Civit. Dei. lib. 1. cap. 27. has
these words; No man of old was brought unto the place of holy baptism, unless
he were of grown age already, and when the same person knew what that mystical
water meant, and desired to be washed in it, and that more then once; an image
of which thing we see yet, in our baptism of Infants; for as yet the Infant,
though born the same day, or the day before, is asked, whether he would be
baptized, and that thries; for whom the sureties answer, that he would. I bear
in some Cities in Italy, that the old custom, for a great part, is yet
preserved.

We reply; To the first particular. First does one converted thees continue the
church? Animadver.
2 Or if an accident that many by divine providentiall necessity are bolted and
debarred from an ordinance for a certain time, does not interrupt the Churches
succession, when God by his prerogative will continue it; Can at another time
wilful neglect of an Ordinance in a right manner, yea the applying of it
grossly to the wrong parties (as the Anabaptists pretend both and proclaim
thereupon a nullity of Baptism of such persons) justify that then and there
is a due succession of the Church? Yet thus has the Baptism of believers
infants ten thousands for one of ripe years, continued in Holland, Scotland,
England, and other Churches in France and Germany (and where other-wise) beyond
the memory of the oldest man alive: Where then has been the succession of the
Church all that while, according to the principles of the Anabaptists, touching
childrens Baptism? Sure they will not hold the preaching of the Word an
infallible essential note of a Church so long as whiles Infants grow up to be
men. For true preaching of the word of God on the preachers part may be to
heathens. Doubtless (as M. P. and Vossius distinguish;) Wide is the difference
of a Church in the constitution when men of ripe years must receive the first
Seal, from a Church constituted, wherein the first Seal descends from the
believer to his child for any precept that appears in the Old or New Testament
to the contrary.

But Mr T. faith in his second particular (which will nothing please the
Anabaptists) perhaps it is not necessary to be said, that the Baptism of
Infants, because not lawful is not therefore null. Note.
We reply, Mr T. speaks but perhaps, and it is not necessary, and to say so.
But what perhaps will M. T. say, and how necessarily say Baptism of Infants is
all null, by that time he has fully concocted this principle of the
unlawfullnesse of the Baptizing of any Infants; as thousands of others have
done and some honest men and scholars who upon the said principle of
Antipaedaptists have turned Anabaptists, though they drew their original of
Re-baptisme from most scripturelesse Se-baptisme? I may well put the question;
For by that time M. Tombs is gone six leaves further: Viz. in the 34, and last
page of his Exercitation he begins to be beyond perhaps, and speaks as if it
were necessary to say that [The assuming of Baptism in ripe years, by those
who were washed in infancy, is not a renouncing of Baptism as some in their
gross ignorance conceit, but indeed a firmer avouching of Baptism, according
to Christ's mind.] If the Reader will but mark these lines well, and especially
those words we have put in another character, he will easily be a Commentator
to himself upon Mr Tombs his warping judgment.

To Mr T. his third particular wherein he aesserts [That there was in the
Church, Baptism of persons grown in all ages] and quotes LVDOVICVS VIVES to
prove it. We reply first to his assertion; First that is very general for an
answer to an argument; There were persons: How many? In all ages: What means
that? In every hundred years, or ordinary age of man: Suppose sixty years or
less? What is all this to clear a continued succession of the Church in point
of baptizing persons of ripe years? Secondly, let us deal plainly one with
another in things of this nature. Can M. T. or any else produce proof that in
England, Scotland, Ireland, etc. there has been baptized in either of these at
least one of ripe years every year, for these 80 or an 100 years last past:
If not, or if so, where is a sufficient number to continue the succession of
Churches we talk of in point of adult-Baptisme, Baptism of persons of ripe
years.

2 To his quotation of LVD. VIVES, we say; First he is but of yesterday to say
without proof what has been in former ages. For in all his Notes on August.
he cites not one Scripture, not one Antiquity, not one Author, nor any thing
that may go for a Reason; but only tells us of a fashion of questions put to
humane-devised Godfathers and Godmothers as they call them; and of an hearsay
out of Italy; a likely place to preserve any pure truth.

2. Though Lud. Vives were a good Scholar in Arts; yet we must not give credit
to him in divine things, when his phrase departs from purity, and his assertion
from verity. He says, Nems olins sacro admovebatur baptisterio, that is, No
man of old was brought unto the holy Baptistery, Font, or Vessel to wash in.
He puts holiness in or upon the Vessel in which these persons of ripe years
were baptized (for it should seem by him they were not baptized in a River)
which phrase of Lud. Vives, Mr Tombs covers with a double garment, first
Translating Baptisterio by the word [place] that being wide enough in
signification to include rivers. Secondly, Translating sacro Baptisterio [the
holy place] by [the place of holy Baptisme]. LVD. VIVES goes on; Nisi adulta
jam aetate, that is unless he were of ripe age already. Now this is a gross
mistake, and opposite to the best approved antiquity, that tells us it was a
known custom in the Churches, to baptize infants within few years after the
death of the Apostle John: And therefore this custom could not totally invade
the Churches on such a sudden, without any mention in Antiquity, but flowed
doubtless down from the Apostles. So Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, Origin,
Cyprian, Gregory Natianzen, Ambrose, Augustine, and others. For the pretenses
made by Mr T. against some Quotations of those fathers I doubt not but to take
them off and to justify these antiquities; when we come in our XIII CHAPTER to
Mr Tombs his fourth Argument against the baptizing of Believers Infants. In
his Exercitation. 17. For the present we have no more to say to VIVES or Mr
TOMBS upon this argument but only to admire that Mr Tombs would translate
VIVES as if he had said [that the person of ripe years desired to be washed
more then once in the water of Baptisme]; for so it lies fairer in Mr Tombs
his Translation to please an Anabaptist; namely [The person of ripe years
defired to be washed in the water of Baptism, and that more then once] whereas
Mr Tombs following the Latin closer which is, So ablui ill^ aqua pe^eres, nec
semel peteres he might have translated clearer that he desired and desired more
then once, (what?) to be washed with that water.

CHAP. X.
SEventhly, Heb. 6.2. Exercitat. 14. The Argument from Heb. 6.2. for
Infant Baptism examined.
The Apostle speaks of the doctrine of baptismes, and laying on of hands; now
this is not likely to be understood of laying on of hands in healing sick
persons, or bestowing the Holy Ghost, for these were extraordinary or
miraculous, and therefore not to be put in the number of the principles of the
oracles of God, the foundation, milk for babes; nor of imposition of hands for
ordination to special function in the Church, for that, though ordinary, yet
not likely to be put among the principles, the foundation, milk for babes,
therefore it remains, that it was the laying on of hands on children formerly
baptized in infancy, which though corruptly made a Sacrament by Papists, and
superstitiously abused, yet being freed from the abuse were very useful, as
being an Apostolical ordinance, from this Text, and manifests that there was
Infant Baptism in the Apostles days, which is confirmed, because it is
coupled with baptism, and therefore seems to be a consequent upon it.

Answ. 1. There is great incertainty, what this imposition of hands mentioned,
Heb. 6.2. served for; the reason ^prove that it could not be either for
healing, or giving the Holy Ghost, because they were miraculous or
extraordinary, is not cogent; for though they were by more then ordinary power,
yet were they frequent in those times, and might well be put among the elements
to be in those days first learned: nor is the reason cogent to prove it could
not be the imposition of hands in ordination, for special function in the
Church; for it is more likely that it should be meant, which it is certain was
still in use, and to continue to be used, and therefore it was needful to be
taught younglings, as well as the doctrine of baptismes: then laying on of
hands for confirmation of baptism, of which there is no certainty, though
pretended examples in scripture, be brought to give some color to it; nor is
imposition of hands in ordination unfitly coupled to baptism, both being
ordinances for initiation, the one into the profession of Christ, the other
into sacred function.

2. But if it were supposed, that this imposition of hands meant Hebr. 6.2.
were on the the Baptized; yet this proves not the baptism of Infants in the
Apostles days; unless it could be proved, that it was used after the Baptism
of Infants only, for a confir, mation either of the Baptism, or baptized. On
the contrary, it is apparent out of Tertul. de Corona militis. C. 3. That in
the primitive times the baptized did make his confession at Baptism, sub manu
antistitis, that is, the Minister laying hands on him. And to save labor in
reciting testimonies, Chamier may be seen, who in his Pans. Catholica, tom. 4.
l. 1. c. 11. Sect. 14. at large proves out of the Ancients that the imposition
of hands which after was made a distinct Sacrament, called Confirmation, was
either a part or appendix of Baptism; and many passages he cites to show, that
it was when the Baptized was to confess the faith, and to renounce Satan. And
if HIERONIMVS Tom. 2. in his Dialogue against the Luciferians do assert that
use of imposition of hands from Scripture, that he alleges not Hebr. 6.2.
for it, but the examples of giving the Holy Ghost by laying on of hands, in the
Acts of the Apostles.

To Mr T. his first Answer, Animadver.
That our reason to prove imposition of hands for Healing, or giving the Holy
Ghost cannot be meant, Hebr. 6.2. [Because those were extraordinary] is not
says Mr T. a cogent reason: We reply, First that Mr T. does by and by as good
as confess it is a cogent reason: For whiles Mr T. goes about to prove that
imposition of hands here mentioned is for ordination, because it was still in
use, and to continue to be used, he justifies our reason that Healing and
giving the Holy Ghost were not to continue because extraordinary, and so not
put here among the principles of the foundation. 2 Will any ingenuous man
weighing and pondering things, say that Mr T. his answer is cogent; namely,
That those miraculary things of imposition of hands for healing, and that kind
of giving the Holy Ghost because usual only in that little time of the
Apostles, should be joined with and put among the first principles of Christian
religion, to be taught young ones to fit them for baptism, or to give an
account of their faith after Baptism? Or whether that reason of Mr T. be
cogent that little children should be taught as one of the first elements of
the christian faith the imposition of hands to ordain Ministers? This rather
should belong to the going on unto perfection, as the Apostle speaks v. 1. Nor
is Mr T. his reason cogent that Imposition of hands for Ordination should be
joined with Baptism, both being ordinances for Initiation (which likes the
Papists well that make imposition a Sacrament and see it so well coped and
coupled with a Sacrament by Mr T.) For first and first, or Initiation in its
great latitude does not so assimilate. Baptism is the Initiation for all at
their first solemn entrance into the Church; that imposition for Ordination
does initiate but few, that is ministers and that into an office, and long
after they are members. We may as well couple marriage with the first
principles of religion which being to be done by invocation upon God, and
instruction out of the word, does first initiate most single people into the
honor and authority to govern children, and families to serve God. Clearly
enough to Mr T. his imposition of hands and admission to the Lords supper would
better cope together, both appertaining to mature grown Christians. 2 We answer
to this first answer of Mr Tombs, that a naked honest explanation of the text
blows all Mr T. his mists away and clears the text, and discovers that these
answers of his are but shifts. In laying open which meaning I hope learned and
pious Mr Pareus, Calvin, Bullinger, Marlorat, Hofman, which were no
Independents, will weigh as much as Mr Tombs, who all tell us the sum of all
approved antiquity, to save our labor of pestering the vulgar reader with the
gibberish of quotations. Pareus upon Hebr. 6.2. Some (says he) conjoyne the
two heads of Baptism and Imposition of hands, because as there were two ranks
of Catechumeni, that is chatechised persons, so there was a two fold initiating
Ceremony. 1 Those of ripe years of the Heathen, who did before their Baptism
recite the Articles of the Creed, of the Christian faith. And this is that the
Apostle calls the catechizing or Doctrine of Baptismes. 2 The Infants of
Christians who by the right of the promise being baptized in their Infancy,
after they were past their childhood, were received into the Church by
imposition of hands, at which time they rehearsed the same articles of faith
before the Church.
And this was the doctrine of Imposition of hands. So Pareus. Calvin speaks to
the very same effect; whose words we set down at large in our 7. chapter of
this controversy. Mr Hofman, Marlorat, Bullinger, Calvin, speak further that
as Imposition of hands was of a manifold use, so among the rest it was a
solemn right of praying; by which Symbol also they did approve the profession
of faith young youth made. So that the original of Imposition of hands came
down from the Apostles; Thus far these learned men,

Ye have also before in the same 7. Chap. of this Controversy, the words of Mr
Cotton, and his reading out of Antiquity and his Reasons, That though young
children were baptized, yet were not received to the Lords Supper, and the full
fruition of all Church-liberties, till being grown up they made their
profession of faith, and ratified their Covenant made in Baptism, and so were
confirmed in their Church estate, by imposition of hands: which imposition of
hands is therefore reckoned one of the six principles of the foundation of
Christian faith, Heb. 6.2. For it could not be a principle of faith; it must be
therefore a principle of the foundation of Church Estate and Order. So Mr
Cotton, with much more before recited, Chap. 7. Now let the world judge whether
these men's readings and reasons, or Mr Tombs his strained glosses give us
rightlyer the meaning of Heb. 6.2.

To Mr T. his second Answ. We reply, first: That the learned men before quoted,
gave us the sum of Antiquity Tertul, de Baptismo. Dehinc manus imponitur per
benedictionem, etc. Cyprian, Ep. 3. and 70. Nunc quoque apud nos geritur ut qui
in ecclesia baptizantur, per praepositos ecclesiae offerantur, and per nostram
orationem and manus impositionem spiritum sanctum consequantur. August. Tract.
6. in Joan. Epist. Nuac quidem um loqui linguis quibus imponuntur manus post
baptisnum, tamenrevera accipere spiritum sanctum and latenter alque
invisibiliter infundi charitatem.
That there was an imposition of hands upon believers children, to confirm that
Baptism they had received being Infants, upon the confession of faith, when
grown up, and to testify the Churches receiving them now unto full membership,
and complete fruition of all Church privileges, as to partake of the Lords
Supper, etc. And that this the Text here calls The Doctrine of imposition of
hands: whereas the recital of the Articles of faith, by those that were past
Infancy (being children of Heathens) fitting them for Baptism, is by the
Apostle precisely and distinctly (from the other) called The Doctrine of
Baptismes. And is not this a proof sufficient, that the common and ordinary
imposition of hands was used after the Baptism of Infants only? 2. If Mr T.
could prove out of Antiquity (for this Text of Heb. 6.2. has it not for him)
that a ceremony of imposing hands upon the riper aged children of unbeleeving
parents when the said children made confession of their faith, for Baptisine,
crept into the Church; this does not overthrow other Antiquity, much less the
Text of Scripture; That the Doctrine of imposition of hands, that is, that
imposing of hands, belonged to believers children after they had been baptized.

But thirdly to answer Mr Tombs his Quotation of Tertullian about this De
corona Militis, c. 3. By the leave of Mr Tombs that does, if not scorn, so
score with the nail in his examen those Antiquities of the Fathers we usually
allege, we must tell the world, first, what a piece and place of Tertullian
Mr T. has here alleged, viz. such a one as wherein Tertullian disputes for
receiving unwritten Traditions, Quaeramus an traditio non scripta debeat
recipi, etc. says he, Let us enquire Whether unwritten tradition be not to be
received? We shall deny it to be received, if it were not prejudged, or fore
determined by the examples of other observations, which without the instrument
of any Scripture, or Writing, by the title of tradition only, we from thence
defend under the patronage of custom. Moreover to begin with Baptism, when we
are about to enter into the water, even there, but also too a little before in
the Church, under the hand of a Bishop or Prelate we bear witness, or make
serious protestation, that we renounce the Devil, Pomp, and his Angels. After
this we are plunged or drencht, or dipped three times, answering something more
then the Lord has determined in the Gospel. Then being [ Suscepti, which
alludes to Godfathers Office, Jun. Note on the place.
undertaken for] we take a taste of the compound of milk, and honey. And from
that day we abstain from washing in the common laver, or place of washing for a
whole week. Thus far Mr Tombs his place of Tertullian. Now let the Reader
weigh all the circumstances of the place, and judge whether Turtullian here
alludes to any Scripture Authority, or to any approved Antiquity.

2. Such a place of Tertullian, that does not prove the thing Mr Tombs
intends. For he well knows that sub manu, is a phrase that has so many senses,
as it is no ways certain that here sub manu [under the hand] signifies
imposition of hands. Happily it may rather signify the Ministers lifting up of
his hand in prayer. As Pacianus has it; we obtain, says he, in prayer,
pardon; and the holy Spirit in Baptism, by the mouth and hand of the Antistes.

Touching Mr T. his quotation of Chamier Pans. Cathol. tom. 4. l. 4. c. 11.
Sect. 14. We give the world this account, that we have run over, and that
twice, that 14th Section, with as many more following to the end of the
Chapter, as make up that 14th to be 59. And we find but four Quotations
touching imposition of hands. All which serve little to Mr T. his purpose. The
first is in Sect. 23. quoted out of Areopag. and is this [After questioning,
and profession he puts his hand upon his head and commands him being consigned
to be enrolled or numbered among the Priests, and after other ceremonies, puts
him into a certain garment and annoints him with oyl] were this suppositions
Areopagite Mitto Arcopagiram, Hier. Eccles. Clementem Romans Constitut. Apostol.
Nee libri isti little sunt quibus tribuuntur vulgo, Jo. Voss. These. Theol. and
Hist. See also Perkins prepar. to them. of the problem.
an author of credit, and free from the ceremonious fooleries here mentioned:
yet the Baptism here mentioned is of one of ripe years (at which time
unbeleevers children had the first seal) to whom this imposition of hands was
applied rather to make him a Priest, as we conceive by the words, then to
accompany Baptism.

The second is of the same hogge-sty, Leo the first, and rather against Mr
Tombs. [If any, says he, shall be baptized by an Heretic he is not to
iterate that Sacrament, but only that to be conferred which was wanting, that
by Episcopal imposition of hands, he may obtain the virtue of the holy Ghost]
Here imposition of hands follows baptism at distance; which is for us.

The third is out of Cyprian, viz. [It were to small purpose to impose hands on
Heretics to receive the holy Spirit, unless they receive the Churches
Baptism.] Here imposition of hands presupposes precedent Baptism, though in
men of ripe years.

The fourth is out of a false-named (...).
, or a forged Eusebius (as Chamier calls him) in his first Decretall [Know ye
that those that have been baptized in the faith of the sacred Trinity, we
receive or undertake for by imposition of hands]. If this fellow be of any
credit, he is for us not against us. Thus few does Chamier quote touching
imposition of hands, because his design was chiefly to pursue the dispute of
the other part of confirmation (as he calls it) namely Unction, and to prove
that neither Unction or imposition of hands were Sacraments, which though he
proves by this argument, that they were only appendices of Sacraments; yet he
does not assert as from himself, or from Antiquity, that imposition of hands
was to be conjoined with Baptism, but rather tells us the contrary partly from
himself, partly from those authors he quotes. As [that the rule of the Roman
Church was that they gave in command that men should be reconciled by
imposition of hands.] Sect. 53. That reciliation is proper to repentance. Sect.
54. That though confirmation belongs to the solemnities of Baptism, yet after
a while after Baptism.

To Mr T. his Quotation of HIERONIMVS Tom. 2. In his Diolog. Adv. Lucif. 1. We
reply that if Hieronimus does confess imposition of hands on them that had
been baptized, though he does not allege all Scriptures for it, and so not
that Heb. 6.2. the antiquity holds good, that Imposition of hands was used to
be after applied to them that have been baptized. 2. That Hieronimus in that
place quotes other places then the Acts of the Apostles, and speaks to our
purpose thus [Orth.] Neither can it be that he that is holy in Baptism, can be
a sinner, etc. [Luc.] I receive a Lay penitent person by Imposition of hands,
and invocation of the Holy Spirit, Knowing that the Holy Spirit is not
conferred by Heretics. [Orth.] Seeing that he that is baptized in the name of
the father, son and holy spirit is made the Temple of God, etc. it appears
that Baptism is not without the holy spirit. And to prove that that place,
Acts 19.2. did suppose they had received the saving gifts of the Spirit in
Baptism, he brings Math. 3. That John's Baptism was a Baptism of Repentance
into remission of sins: And a little after, if John did not baptize in the
Spirit; then not into remission of sins.
For no man's sins are remitted without the spirit. So Hieronimus. Wherefore
he supposes Imposition of hands may be on them that had the spirit in Baptism
before. So Hieronimus with much more which we omit to avoyde tediousness. Thus
far of Mr Tombs his first Argument against Infant Baptism.

CHAP. XI.
THe second Argument follows: Exercitat.


That which agrees not with the Lords institution of Baptism, 15. The
Argument from the institution of Christ, Mat. 28.19. against Infant Baptism,
confirmed.
that is deservedly doubtful.

But the rite of Infant Baptism agrees not with the Lords institution of
Baptism, Ergo.

The Major is proved, because Institution is the rule of exhibiting worship to
God.

The Minor is proved from the words of Institution, Mat. 28.19. Going
therefore, disciple ye all nations, baptizing them.

Whence I gather thus:

That rite agrees not with the Lords Institution of Baptism, according to
which they are baptized, whom the Lord appointed not to be baptized.

But after the rite of Infant Baptism, they are baptized whom the Lord
appointed not to be baptized, Ergo.

The Major is manifest of it self.

The Minor is proved: The Lord appointed not Infants to be baptized, Ergo. The
Antecedent is proved;

Those, and no other, the Lord appointed to be baptized, who have been made
Disciples.

But this cannot be said of Infants. Ergo.

The Argument is confirmed from John 4.2. where it is said that Jesus made more
disciples; then that he baptized: first it is said that be made disciples, then
baptized.

Some one perhaps will say that Baptism of Infants is elsewhere instituted,
although not here.

To which is answered, Let he that can, bring forth that institution, and the
doubt will be loosed.

But Infants may be disciples, for they may be sanctified by the Spirit?

Answ. It is true, Infants may be sanctified by the Spirit of God, purged by
the blood of Christ, saved by the grace of God; my mind abhors from the
doctrine of them that assert, That Infants not baptized, necessarily perish, or
are deprived of the Kingdom of God; nor do I doubt, but that the Elect Infants
dying in Infancy are sanctified; yea, if it should be made known to us that
they are sanctified, I should not doubt that they are to be baptized,
remembering the saying of Peter, Act. 10.47. Can any man forbid water, that
these should not be baptized, who have receined the holy Ghost as we?

Then you will say [make disciples] in that place, may be so expounded, as that
it may include Infants?

Answ. It follows not; but this only follows, that in case extraordinary, we
may depart from the ordinary rule: But the ordinary rule is, make disciples,
that is, by preaching the Gospel, make disciples, as appears from Mark 16.15.
and baptize them, to wit, whom you have made disciples; and in the ordinary
course of Ministry, we must follow the ordinary rule.

Perhaps some one will except, that Christ teaches that such disciples should
be baptized, but that the speech is not exclusive.

Refut. But it is meet he remember, who shall thus except; if institution be
the rule of worship, it is necessary that he that shall administer the worship,
bind himself to the rule; otherwise he will devise will worship, and arrogate
the Lords authority to himself: Surely the Apostle in the business of the
Lords Supper, insinuates this, when being about to correct the aberrations of
the Corinthians, concerning the Lords Supper he brings forth these words, 1
Cor. 11.23. For I have received of the Lord, that which I also have delivered
unto you.

Besides as Christ Mat. 19.4.8. argues from the institution of Marriage,
against Divorce for a light cause, and Polygamy, because it is said, Two, not
more then two shall be one flesh; so in like manner it may be here argued,
Christ said Baptizing them, and not others, therefore these and not others are
to be baptized.

But as for him who gathers from this place, Infants are to be baptized,
because Christ Commands all Nations to be baptized, verily he is faulty, 1. In
casting away that restriction that Christ has put. 2. By determining that all
men whatsoever are to be baptized; so that this is not a privilege of
believers and their children, but common with them, to all Infidels and their
children.


And in very deed, however assertors of Infant Baptism, crack of a privilege
of believers and their offspring; not only the usual practice of baptising
any little children offered, but also Sayings prove that men have gone far, not
only from Christ's institution, but also from the principles upon which, men at
this day are busy to establish Infant Baptism. I shall prove this by some
instances. In the 59 Epistle of Cyprian to Fidus, from which Augustine is wont
in his disputations-against the Pelagians, to take his proof for
Infant Baptism, and to which Writers attribute much, although that I may say
no worse, without cause, this reason is put why it was not assented to Biship
Fidus, who thought that an Infant was not to be baptized, before the eighth day,
according to the Law of ancient Circumcision, We all rather judged, that the
mercy and grace of God is to be denied to none that is born of men.

By the answer of Augustine to Bonifacius, Tom. 2. Epist. 23. Enquiring
concerning the truth of Sureties, in affirming the unknown faith of little
ones, and promising for them, it will appear to the Reader, that the Baptism
of any little ones offered to baptism, is defended by him, Although they were
not brought, that they might be regenerated to eternal Life, by Spiritual
grace; but because they think by this remedy (I use the words of Augustine) to
retain or receive temporal health; John Gerhard, Loc. Theolog. Tom. 4. de
Baptis. Cap. 7. Sect. 4. defends the practice of the Ancients baptizing the
Children of unbeleevers: And the words of Mr Samuel Rutherford, Scot, in his
Book lately put forth in the English tongue, entitled A peaceable and
temperate plea, c. 12. arg. 7. seems to me to propend too much to this
opinion, The words are these, If then the Jews in Paul's time were holy by
Covenant, howbeit for the present the Sons were branches broken off, for
unbelief; much more seeing God has chosen the race and nation of the
Gentiles, and is become a God to us and to our seed, the seed must be holy,
with holiness of the chosen nation, and holiness external of the Covenant,
notwithstanding the Father and Mother were as wicked as the Jews who slew the
Lord of glory.

And the grave confutation of Brownists, by Rathband, Part. 3. Page 50.
Fourthly, Children may be lawfully admitted to Baptism, though both their
Parents be profane, if those who are instead of Parents to them do require
Baptism for them, and give their promise to the Church for their religious
Education, seeing they may lawfully be accounted within Gods Covenant, if any
of their Ancestors in any Generation were faithful, Exodus 20.5.

Lastly, if this Argument be not of force, Christ commands first to Disciple,
and then to baptize those that are Discipuled; to exclude Infants from Baptime;
neither will the argument be of force, from 1 Cor. 11.28. Let a man examine
himself, and so let him eat, to exclude Infants from the Lords Supper; for by
the like clusion this argument may be rejected by saying, that the speech of
the Apostle is not exclusive, and is to be understood of receiving the Lords
Supper by Persons grown only; yea, verily, neither will the argument be of
force from the institution of the Supper, Mat. 26.26, 27. therefore only
believers are to be admitted to the Lords Supper. If any reply. But the Apostle
1 Cor. 10. and 11. has declared, that the institution is exclusive, the fame
may be said of the institution of Baptism, from the following Argument.

To this second Argument of Mr T. out of Mat. 28.19. for the Affirmative,
Animadver.
That men of ripe years only are to be baptized (the other being only
negative, to put off Arguments for childrens baptism) I say, that I verily
expected Mr T. would not have urged it so curtedly, carelessly, or so
scatteringly.

Curtedly] For he speaks so abruptly touching the business of Bishop Fidus p.
25. That I can hardly divine what his meaning is. I conjecture this answer will
serve. 1. That God himself puts the cause, and makes the premises wider than
the effect or conclusion, 2 Pet. 3.9. 1 Timothy 2.4. Yet he does not warrant us to
apply comforts or seals to all. 2. That Cyprian in all likelihood speaks to
the point in hand: That as circumcision was not denied to any children of
Jewish parents that were members of that Church; so Baptism is not to be
denied to any so born of men, that is are the children of Parents reputed true
members of the Church.


Carelesly] for first he says, p. 24. [ John 4.2. Where it is said That Jesus
made more disciples, then, that he baptized; first, it is said, that he made
disciples, then baptize.] So Mr T.) Now we must needs say that here is a gross
falsehood. For that text, John 4.2. says expressly, Jesus baptized none at all.
Secondly, Mr. T. says p. 24. [The ordinary rule is, make disciples, that is by
preaching the Gospel make disciples, as appears Mark 16.15. and baptize them:
to wit, whom you have made disciples] So Mr T. here. Yet in another place of
his Exercitation, Mr. T. does not forget, but confesses that Mar. 16.15. is
not make disciples, but only preach the Gospel. And so Mark makes not more of
(...) make Disciples (as the Anabaptists would have it) but only (...) preach
the Gospel.

Scatteringly] Not only floteing so much paper with the Ink of Syllogism
under Syllogism, and Argument under Syllogism; as if Mat. 28.19. did not
indeed in any show serve his turn, without much lifting: but also in scattering
such speeches to the great disgrace of Anabaptisme. For Mr T. says, p. 25.
That Augustine was wont to take out his proof for. In-infant-Baptisme in his
disputations against the Pelagians, from Cyprians 59 Epistle to Fidus. So that
by this Mr T. confesses that the Pelagians of old were the men that denied
Infant Baptism; which brought to mind that great James Arminius was an
Anabaptist, who had that and other dangerous principles from that unsound
Castalio; Mr G. Philips, his Reply and to T. Lamb. p. 137
and that of Master George Philips of Water Town in New England: That the first
that denied Infants Baptism, and opposed the practice of the Churches in this
case was one Auxentius an Arrian with his adherents (that denied the Godhead of
Christ) who dyed about 380 years after Christ, as Mr Philpot the Martyr of
Jesus, notes in an Epistle of his, written out of prison, to a fellow prisoner
of his, about the point. So Mr Fox relates in his book of Martyrs, ad Ann.
1555. Bullinger affirms the same. Tom. 3. Sermon. 8. Decad. quint. After him
the Pelagians and Donatists opposed it, against whom, Augustine beside others,
wrote and defended it. The Pelagians denied it upon this ground, That Infants
had no Original sin. And in Bernards time, one Peter Abilaird, among many
other gross opinions, wherein he says, he was Magis Arrius, quam Arrius
(rather more then Arrius, then bare Arrius) held this also, that Infants were
not to be baptized, Ep. 190. So Mr Philips.

But to come to Mr T. his Argument out of Mat. 28.19. The sum of it is this,
Exercitat.. 15.
That Christ's institution is That those only should be baptized that are made
disciples, Mat. 28.19. But believers Infants are not disciples. Ergo.

To the place of Mat. 28.19. That is, Animadver.
the proof of the Major, We have answered somewhat before, Chap. 1. of our
Animadvers. p. 7. which we entreat the patient reader to ponder over again;
more we have answered but now; by comparing, Mark 16.15. who renders it barely
preach the Gospel; which the reader cannot but esteem of more weight then all
the interpretations, not only of all Anabaptists, but of all men. We add now.
1. That this place can argue no more but that the administration of Baptism
began first on the parents, that received the word, and so descended to their
children: they being baptized, their children presently were baptized also. For
the Jews generally carried their children with them after Ordinances; whereof
we have not only some special instances, that Hanna carried Samuel up to
Shilo. 1 Samuel 24. and Mary and Joseph carried Jesus to Jerusalem, Luke 2.22.
and thus they carried him yearly at the time of the Passover, Luke 2.41, 42,
43. but we have ordinary instances.

As that when the Jews came to the Passover and followed Christ to hear him
preach, and do miracles, they brought their children with them who partook of
that they were capable not only of the Passover, but of the dispensations of
Christ: The children partook of the miracle, Math. 14.21. compare Joh. 6.4, 5.
The children are offered by their parents and friends that came to hear Christ,
to have Christ's hands laid upon them and to be blessed of him, and were blessed
Mar. 10. And by the same proportion, children are understood when it is said
Math. 3.5, 6. Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all the region
round about Jordan, and were baptized of him (the parents) confessing their
sins, and the children accepted under their confession, being put under the
same promise, I am the God of thee and of thy seed; even as when Abraham
expressed his belief in God Genesis 15.6. from that time forward God proclaimed
he was his God, and the God of his seed, and gave them Circumcision for a Seal
thereof. Nor is all this to be blown away with the blast of the word
[uncertain] unless Mr T. could make out hence an express exclusion of
children from Baptism, more certain. 2. It cannot be more then bare
presumption to say that children that are ordinarily three parts of All
Nations, should be here reckoned as no part of All nations here meant, first
seeing All Nations are here put as an opposite member of distinction, to that
one Nation of the Jews; compare Mat. 21.41. Romans 11.17. The Gentiles have the
Vineyard and were ingrasted as the Jews: But the Jews and their children had
the benefit of the Vineyard, and both partook of the stock according to their
capacity and method of Gods dispensation. Ergo, so the Gentiles. So that
whereas before, the Word and Sacraments were couched within the confines of the
Jewish nation, and them that came into them, now Christ gives a commission to
pull down that partition wall; and to send the Word and Sacraments likewise to
All Nations of the Gentiles, But to the Jews, the Word and first Seal coming
to the parents; that Seal came likewise to their children: Therefore the same
proportion is to be kept in the New Testament. 2. It is not nothing that it is
said Go teach all Nations, baptizing them, and not Go teach and baptize all
Nations. And therefore the method and order of the phrase is not so closely
framed to make teaching and baptizing of an exact equal latitude, that only
taught disciples should be baptized; as it might have been if that had been the
Intent of the Text. For Christ's institutions are wont to be wonderful plain in
all the things it mainly intends.

2 We answer to the Minor; namely [But Infants of Believers are not Disciples.]
To which we say that it being taken, as here pronounced, that Infants of
believers without exception are no Disciples we easily prove it is most false;
by two Texts of Scripture: The first we have mentioned before Chap. 1. of our
Animadv. p. 8.
Namely Acts 15.10. Now why tempt ye God to put a yoke upon the necks of the
Disciples? This yoke was Circumcision; which was at first by Institution put
upon children, at eight days old. Genesis 17. According to which the false
teachers out of doubt as the only seeming strength of their Imposition of it
did ground it. And therefore pursued it that as the Fathers like Abraham, so
the children as Isaac etc. should be circumcised. The second Text is John 9.28.
We are Moses his disciples say the Jews. But the only thing that entered them
into the school of Moses, that first nominated them to be Moses his Disciples
was Circumcision in their Infancy which after tied them to Moses his
observations, Gal. 5.3. Therefore the infants of believers are Disciples.

Some will say (says Mr T.) that Baptism of Infants is elsewhere instituted.
Exercitat.
Let him that can (says he) bring forth that Institution.

We have out of diverse texts (as clearly and clearlyer then Mr. T. has
brought forth a prohibition) as out of 1 Cor. 7.14. Animadver.
Mar. 10. Heb. 6. Genesis 17. which last text is not so much esteemed of
professors of the Gospel, as their profession injoynes them. For though it be
not a text in the New Testament; yet it is the grand Charter of the Gospel, I
am the God of thee and of thy seed, to bless you through THE SEED Christ; to
which as to the original, all the tenor of the New Testament runs, Romans 4.
Gal. 3. Acts 2.39. etc.

Infants may be sanctified by the spirit of God, Exercitat.
etc.

I answer all Anabaptists are not of this mind, Animadver.
partly by word of mouth; partly by writings in print. Some say children are
not capable of grace, having no faith, etc. others when they are put to it upon
this argument; if children may not have grace, and be within the Covenant; then
(say we) either all Infants dying are damned, or else they are saved without a
Covenant, and so without Christ and grace, or else they have no original
sin; they embrace the last member of the argument that Infants have no
original sin".

Yea if it should be known to us that Infants are sanctified, Exercitat.
I should not doubt that they are to be baptized.

We Reply, Animadver.
first where is that clause in Scripture they must be known to be sanctified? 2
Is not the believing parent as well known to believe as a new Convert, is known
to be converted? If so, then Gods promise to me concerning my child, I am the
God of thee, and of thy seed, is as sure to me, as man's judgment of the
Convert that he is converted.


Obj. But some children of believers prove wicked.

Ans. So do some seeming Converts. 2 Pet. 2.1. therefore as we must judge
indefinitely charitably of Converts, so of believers children; for we have not
an infallibility of either.

Perhaps (says Mr. T.) some one will except, Exercit.
that Christ teaches that taught-disciples should be baptized, but the speech
is not exclusive. Refut. It is will worship (says he) that follows not the
rule. And the Apostle in rectifying the business of the Lords Supper, brings
out only these words, 1 Cor. 11.23. For I have received of the Lord that which
I also have delivered unto you. Besides as Christ Matthew. 19.4.8. argues from
the institution of marriage against Divorce for a light cause and polygamie,
because it is said, two, not more shall be one flesh. So in like manner it may
be here argued, Christ said, Baptizing them, and not others therefore these,
and not others, are to be baptized.

We answer. The cases of the Lords Supper, Animadvers.
and marriage were far different from this of Baptism.

1. That as there were clear precedent foregoing institutions of marriage and
the Lords Supper: So to those institutions the words of Christ and Paul
expressly relate.

2. That therefore those repetitions Mr. T. quotes were not the first
institutions of those two, but an application of the first institutions unto
exact practice accordingly to them.

3. That the occasion of this repetition of the institution of those two were
gross abuses in both, expressed by the Apostle and Christ, for which there was
no fair pretense; but an apparent offending against the first institution As
that a man should for every light cause put away his wife; which was not only
against the first institution, Genesis 2.24. Matthew. 5.32.-19.4, 5, 8. but against
Moses his dispensation. Deuteronomy. 24.1. which was not to put her away, unless he
found some uncleanness, that hindered cohabitation according to the intent of
marriage. Matthew. 19.8. So likewise these were gross abuses, first, that men at
the communion should not tarry one for another; but every faction, they of Paul
by themselves, they of Peter or Cephas by themselves, and (first come first
served, as we say) should partake of the Lords Supper. Secondly, that after
their holy Supper, some that were rich made such large feasts of charity
(which Christ instituted not) of the collections, that they were drunk; whiles
the poorer coming after were hunger-bit, had nothing lest for them.

Now for the business of Baptism in this 28. of Matt. it is quite otherwise
in all the said three particulars.

For as for the first particular: either as we say, in circumcision was a full
and sufficient foregoing institution of the administration of Baptism: and
then Christ needed not say more here but go teach and baptize, as referring us
to the institution of the first seal circumcision in the old Testament. Where
after believing Abraham was taught, Genesis 12. Genesis 15. and after circumcised,
Genesis 17. he accordingly circumcised his children: and therefore so it should be
in the New Testament. The parents being taught and baptized, their children
were to be baptized also. Or else (as the Anabaptists say) there was no
preceding or foregoing institution of baptism before Christ's time; and that
Baptism differs much from Circumcision. But if this be true, how does this
place of Matthew. 28.19. agree with those quoted places of marriage and the Lords
Suppers there being nothing foregoing this, as there is before them, to make us
punctually understand the meaning of it, at least in every main particular;
especially in matters of main difference from the administration of the first
seal of the old Testament. And therefore,

To the second particular we say, that if this 28. of Matthew. be the institution
of baptism; First, as it does not agree with the places of marriage, and the
Lords Supper, to be an application of a former institution of Baptism to an
exact practice; so our faithful Christ must needs have spoken plainer and
fuller in an institution, to have prevented so gross an abuse (if it had been
abuse) that men should apply this Sacrament to any infants if to them it should
not belong. For how should it be prevented but from the institution at least?
And how from the institution, if Christ will not there speak it?

So for the third and last particular; as Baptism of believers infants has,
you will yield, at least a fair religious pretense for it out of Genesis 17. so
the Lord Christ, or John Baptist, or the Apostles do not in the least intimate
any where, that the baptizing of believers children was an abuse, as is
intimated about that of marriage, and the Lords Supper: and therefore we cannot
attend to any such intention of Christ in the least in this of Matthew. 28. to
prevent the baptism of believers infants.

Bat Mr. T. in his Argument before out of Matthew. 28. objecteth, that if any
gather thence that Infants are to be baptized because Christ commands all
Nations to be baptized, that, first, he is faulty in casting away that
restriction that Christ has put. Secondly, in making the privilege of
believers and their children common to all Infidels and their children.

We answer to the first. That first, that is the question whether Christ has
here put a restriction against believers children? Secondly, that we extend not
this place further then to the children of taught-or-made disciples;
understanding it to refer to Genesis 17. where instructed Abraham was to
circumcise his children; as we said before. Yet it is said, I will make thee a
Father of many Nations; and in thy seed all the Nations shall be blessed. So
here though it be said, Go teach and baptize all Nations, yet we extend it not
beyond the children of parents taught and baptized.

But says Mr. T. However assertors of baptism of Infants crack of a
privilege of believers, and their offspring; yet by their sayings, and
doings, touching baptizing all Infants, they go far from Christ's institution,
and their own principles at this day, upon which they are now busy to
establish Infant Baptism. For their doings: first, Mr. T. urges their
baptizing all Infants offered to them. For their sayings he urges, Augustine,
and his quotation out of Cyprian. Also Mr. S. Rutherford, Scot; and Mr.
Rathband.

Answ. As we did not appoint Cyprian, August. John Gerard, Mr. Rutherford, or
Mr. Rathband to speak for us all: So nor do they undertake it. We know as these
men have and do confess, they are men, and humanum est errare, man may
mistake. Mr. T. assumes not to himself infallibility. If August. and Cyprian,
etc. did err on the right hand in saying all Infants may be baptized; yet this
does not infer, that that is no error in others that say no Infants are to
be baptized; which erres on the left hand. And though we might excuse Cyprian
and Augustine, etc. thus far, (and yet be excused of candid men for so doing)
that there is not no difference between saying, Grace is not to be denied to
any man; and saying, All Infants whatsoever are to be baptized (let them that
can, consult the places of Cyprian, and Augustine) yet we say rather that the
Fathers had their severell naevos, their blemishes in diverse things; as Danaeus
on Augustine, and Tossanus upon all the Fathers, note them. Augustine was so
sensible of this; that he wrote his Confessions to acknowledge the errors of
his life, and his Retractations of his errors in opinion. Who knows but that
Mr. Tombs, and that other H.D. (that is sharp with Mr. Marshall, for stating
the question of baptizing believers children, his practice and others, as he
says, having been formerly larger.) I say who knows but Mr. T. and Mr. D.
formerly have so thought, and so done themselves, or at least have not
professed against it; which now they dislike in others. Therefore let me offer
to Mr. T. and Mr. D. and others of their judgment, these three considerations.

First, who that has eyes (as they Revel. 4.) as well within as without, may
not arreign himself guilty of this encroachment, of extending his practice,
beyond the rule? In many practices he throws open all fences, and turns them
into common. But if he be questioned by the weakest disputant, he cannot, he
dares not justify himself in his sins: but confesses his way is butted there,
and bounded here; and all the rest trespass against the line he ought to walk
by.

Secondly, who is that professor, especially a Minister living in this Summer
of the Gospel, at this time of the assent of Reformation to our Pole, that
forgets how in the dark and stormy Winter, he saw less, and stumbled more?
Even many of the Antipaedobaptists (whom we own as brethren) if they count
Non-baptizing of believers children a piece of further Reformation, a spark of
clearer light, must of necessity confess, that not long since they thought
not, they did not so, why then should we insult over our brethrens failing? or
taunt them for setting nearer their meridian, closer to the rule? that instead
of baptizing all children, they now state the question, that only believers
children ought to be baptized, unless in some special cases, of which after.

Thirdly, though merely that second nature custom, and that whirlwinde of
persecution, did precipitate many of later times to baptize all Protestant
professors children, confessing Christ to be come in the flesh, and
justification to be rooted in his righteousness alone, yet all Ministers did
not the same upon the same principles; But,

1. They knew that very anciently (as appears by Tertullian, living ann. Dom.
195. which was not long after St. John. Helvic.
This Tertullian being alleged in this question by H.D.) the Churches did not
baptize the children of unbeleevers out of the Church, without Sponsores or
Susceptores, undertakers (which we call Witnesses) who engaged themselves as
parents to look to the Christian education of such children, called Godfathers,
as if fathers under God, or for godliness, to see them trained up in sound
Religion. Tertullians words in his Treatise de Baptismo, cap. 18. are these.
Itaque pro cujusque personae condition, ac dispositione, etiam aetate,
cunctatio baptismi utilior, praecipue tamen circa parvulos. Quid enim necesse
est, si non tamnecesse, sponsores etiam periculo ingeri. On which words, Junius
his note is this. Tria hic distincti proponit Auctor, quae si recte
intelligantur locus est sanctissimus. Conditio personarum baptizandarum est
quod sint in faedere, sive grandiores, sive parvuli. Dispositio est quod
credant and obsequantur Evangelio, profiteanturque. Aetate, non qui sunt in
faedere (nam and parvuli piorum liberi in faedere sunt) sed qui profitentur
fidem recognosci solent. Quum itaque dicit praecipue tamen circa parvulos, id
de extraneorum, non de faederatorum, domesticorumque liberis opus est
intelligi: ut aetiologia sequente confirmatur. Illud autem sr non tam necesse,
etiam sine injuria auctoris abesse potest.

Not to spend time in construing all this, we now only give you the sum of
both, in the point now in hand; for we shall more largely speak to every
particular afterward. That which they both say concerning witnesses to
children, that in these ancient times, they were used for children whose
parents were without, and not of the faith, not of the Church. We speak not for
the using of witnesses or godfathers, etc. in baptizing children as the wont
was among us. But,

Secondly, that this ancient custom (as ancient at least as Tertullian) might
possibly have some respect to the Scripture Genesis 17. according to Mr. Cottons
observation. His book of the way of the Church, in N. England. page 115.
Baptism (says he) may orderly be administered to the children of such
parents, as have professed their faith and repentance before the Church. Or
where either of the parents have made such profession. Or it may be considered
also whether the children may not be baptized, where either the grandfather, or
grandmother have made such profession, and are still living to undertake for
the Christian education of the child. For it may be conceived, where there is
a stipulation of the covenant on Gods part, and a restipulation on man's part,
So M. Grcenham also. See his works, where he says the children of unbeleeving
parents are within the covenant by virtue of their believing grandfathers. Or
else how is God the God of their seed to show mercy to thousands of generations
of them that love him?
there may be an obligation of the covenant on both parts. Genesis 17.7. Or if
these fail, what hinders but that if the parents will resign their Infant to
be educated in the house of any godly member of the Church, the child may be
lawfully baptized in the right of its household governor, according to the
proportion of the Law, Genesis 17, 12, 13. So far Mr. Cotton, both his judgment,
and his grounds. Now in imitation of this last clause, in all likelihood were
Witnesses used (though abusively) in baptizing the children of some
unbelievers, and strangers from the Church; yet therefore we have not such
cause to trample upon any of our brethren about their error in baptizing too
many Infants; seeing they erred with some antiquity, and some pretense of
Scripture before they saw this light, for which God must be glorified, and not
man prided.

The last thing Mr. T. objects in this Argument on Matthew. 28.19. is, that if
this place does not exclude all Infants from Baptism, then nor does 1 Cor.
11.28, [Let a man examine himself; and so let him eat] exclude Infants from the
Lords Supper, saying by the like elusion, that the speech of the Apostle is not
exclusive. Yea verily (says Mr. T.) neither will the Argument be of force from
the institution of the Supper, Matthew. 26.26, 27. that believers only are to be
admitted to the Lords Supper.

We answer. And first to that comparison of 1 Cor. 11.28. with Matthew. 28.19. we
reply two things. First, that there is expressed in 1 Cor. 11. an universal
determinating term, singling out all communicants, man by man, that they must
be able to examine themselves, before they eat. But there is no such
determinating word about Baptisine, in Matthew. 28.19. For first, we have already
in several places of our Animadversions showed, that there is no certainty at
all that the Greek word here must signify to-disciple, or make-disciples. For
first, most learned men render it no more but teach. And so the Syriack, and
Arabic Translations. In the best Translations of the French Churches it is
Endoctrinez teach ye. Of the High Dutch, Lebret teach ye, of the Low Dutch,
Leert teach. And likewise in Hutter his N. Testament set forth in 12.
Languages, in so many of them as I can guess at, it is rendered only [teach
ye] His Sir. (...) teach ye. Hebr. (...) teach ye. Lat. De^^te teach ye. Ital.
Insegnate teach ye. Of German, Dutch, French, we heard before.
Mark the Evangelist also renders it, Mark 16.15. only by preach. Secondly, it
is evident the word in the Greek is taken diverse ways; and here is no note of
circumstance in Matthew. 28.19. to prove that it must signify to make-disciples.
Thirdly, the command is for the Apostle to preach to all Nations, though they
should not disciple or discipulate all. If its objected, that if the word in
Matthew. 28.19. according to Mar. 16.15. signifies but to teach or preach; yet
mention of baptizing immediately follows teaching or preaching: We answer. So
is baptizing expressed to follow believing, saying, He that believes and is
haptized shall be saved. But in converting the Proposition, that is in turning
it, negatively, it is not said, He that is not baptized shall be damned;
because Infants (as Mr. T. confessed before) though of a day old unbaptized may
have the sanctifying Spirit. Therefore may be baptized, Act. 10.47. Our Answer
then is, that Teaching and baptizing does not run evenly together.

Secondly, we now observe that the Lord having said, go preach to all Nations,
he adds, baptizing them, indefinitely; not expressing all, or some (for them
does not in the Greek agree Grammatically with Nations) and so must needs leave
us to compare this Text with other Texts afore-written. As with Genesis 17. where
though Noah, 1 Pet. 3.19.2.2 Pet. 2.5. and Enoch, Jude v. 14. had preached to
all the old world; yet so contrary to teaching were they, that but eight
persons were left alive by the Flood: and of these that remained alive, even
to, or quite to the time of Abraham, but few were taught-men; as Noah, that
dyed the year before Abraham's birth; Shem, alias Melchisedech, and Abraham's
father Terah; and Lot, few more about this time ( Job was long after about
Moses his time) were taught persons. Now among the these taught men, God would
to Abraham communicate the first sign or seal; and he being signed, he should
sign his children also.

Or with John Baptists practice; who (as it is said expressly) baptized the
parents, confessing their sins, but does not exclude (by any expression) their
children.

So then we must needs conclude that here is no determinating word in Matthew.
28.19. to exclude believers Infants. And that this Text does but give in the
two main parts of the Apostles commission, but not expressly all the parts, as
the Administration of the Communion, nor all the main circumstances of those
two as touching childrens baptism.

Secondly, we answer to the comparison of that place of 1 Cor. 11.28. with
Matt. 28.19. Let a man examine himself, that the 1 Cor. 11.28. relates (as the
Apostle there expresses, v. 23. I have received of the Lord that which I
delivered) I say relates to an express institution, wherein Christ gave the
communion to his Disciples that were of ripe years, and not to children. But
that place of Matthew. 28.19. relates to no such express institution of the
first seal, excluding Infants, but rather refers to such places as do include
them, as we showed before.

Secondly, to that collation or parallel comparing Matthew. 26.26, 27. with
Matthew. 28.19. first we reply, that 1 Cor. 11.28. declares that Matthew. 26.26,
27. is intended for an exclusion of unbelievers from the Communion; but there
is no place to declare to us that the meaning of Matthew. 28.19. is to exclude
believers children from the first seal, Baptism.

Obj. But Mr. T. says he will make it appear in the next Argument, that there
are places to declare that Matthew. 28.19. did intend the exclusion of believers
Infants from Baptism.

Ans. We shall by Gods leave show that there are none to make any such
declaration, when by and by we come to answer that Argument. Mean while we say
secondly, that there is no other place to show that apparent unbeleevers,
whiles such, were admitted to the 2. Sacrament; and therefore that institution,
Matt. 26.26, 27. is sufficient to exclude from the Lords Supper. But we have
largely showed that there are no places of Scripture to exclude Infants of
believers from the first seal, but many for including them as belonging to it;
and therefore we cannot take that general expression, go teach and baptize,
Matthew. 28.19. to intend to exclude them from Baptism.

CHAP. I.
MR. Tombs his third Argument against Infant Baptism, Exercit. Argum. 3.
Sect. 16. From John Baptist and the Apostles practice.
is from the Apostles, and John Baptist, which (says he) is the best
interpreter of our Lords institution, from whence this Argument is formed.

That tenet and practice which being put, Baptism cannot be administered as
John Baptist and the Apostles did administer it, agrees not with the practice
of John Baptist, and the Apostles. But the tenet and practice of
Infant Baptism being put, baptism cannot be administered as John Baptist and
the Apostles administered it. Ergo.

1. We answer. Animadvers
This Argument does not in terms conclude the thing in question. For make the
supposition that John Baptist and the Apostles, the best interpreters of our
Lords institution, had never any opportunity, or occasion offered to baptize
any believers Infants; would it therefore follow that the institution did not
allow it when it does not forbid it, but leaves it to be referred to the
institution of the first seal in the old Testament? Moses the best interpreter
of the Ceremonial Law, and so of the institution of Circumcision given by God,
had not any occasion (that we read of to our remembrance) of circumcising any
Jews of ripe years; would it follow therefore that he might not have done it
according to the institution?

2. We answer. That when Mr. T. is to answer our Argument, that the Apostles
baptizing whole families, likely baptized some Infants, he makes it doubtful
whether they baptized any Infants; and now Mr. T. puts it out of doubt that
they baptized none. Or else he would prove one doubt by another.

But let us come particularly to the Argument. The minor, namely, [the tenet
and practice of Infant Baptism being put; Baptism cannot be administered as
John Baptist and the Apostles administered is denied. For it does not appear
that they baptized no children. But Mr. T. will prove the minor thus. Before
the baptism of John even the Jews did confess their sins; the Apostles before
baptism did require shows of faith and repentance. Matthew. 3.6. Luke 3.10. Act.
2.38. Act. 8.12, 13, 37. Act. 9.18. Act. 20.47. Act. 11. 17, 18. Act. 16.15.31,
32, 33. Act. 18.8. Act. 19.5. Act. 22.16. But this cannot be done in the
baptism of Infants. Ergo.

We answer by limiting the major. That in baptizing people of ripe years, de
facto in fact confession of sin, etc. did precede and forego; But neither John
Baptist nor the Apostles make any such express rule, that de jure of equity
none should be baptized by them, but those that could make confession of sin,
or profession of faith. Nor does all the Scriptures brought by Mr. T. prove any
such rule. Mr. T. himself intimatedly confesses, that John the Baptist did not
make a rule for confession; but only in practice those Jews of ripe years that
John Baptist did baptize, did first confess their sins. And that Act. 2.39.
Act. 16. etc. have been already discussed that they showed children were
baptized; who could not make confession or profession.

But Mr. T. objects, Act. 8.37. If thou believe with thy whole heart thou
may be baptized. Where the Apostle implies in his speech to the Eunuch that
defect of faith was an impediment of baptism.

We answer. Mr. T. before confesses, p. 24. Infants may be sanctified. If
therefore he means the defect of manifestation of faith, we answer. It is true
in men of ripe years. For there it is known that they are worse then Infants.
So was it in circumcision. If Ishmael be a known scoffer, he is cast out, and
so his children are not circumcised, unless perhaps after at years they gave
good testimony of their due subjection to the Law.

So that to the whole argumentation we say, that here is mention of the manner
of the practice of that first administration of baptism to the parents, with
confession and profession by many examples, and intimations, but not a rule set
down that thus it must be in the succession of believers children.

We list not to speak any thing more of this major Proposition, and the proofs;
only wonder that among the crowd of Scriptures Mr. T. quotes, he would thrust
in that of Act. 19.5. for baptism of water, which was only a conferring of
the miraculary gifts of the holy Ghost, by imposition of hands; as many
arguments from the place can evince.

But Mr. T. objects this for a confirmation of his Argument. That if it be
rightly argued from 1 Cor. 11.28. that the Lords Supper is not to be granted to
Infants, because self-examination is pre-required; by like reason we may say,
Baptism is not yielded to Infants, because repentance and faith are
pre-required. Act. 2.38. Act. 8.37. and that of those that descended from
Abraham, and to whom the promise was.

Besides what we said before, we answer to this Argument (great in show) that
there is not the like reason between those places for Baptism, and that for
the Lords Supper. For, 1. That of the Lords Supper speaks of every Communicant
viritim, as counting one after another; Let the party whosoever it be enter
into self-examination before eating. But that Act. 2.38. speaks in the gub, or
general to the parents. And that Act. 8.37. is spoken to one only man, and in
that phrase that cannot be found elsewhere on that occasion. 2. There is no
intimation in the New Testament of children admitted to the Lords Supper. But
in that Act. 2. presently in the next verse, v. 39. there is an intimation of
their Infants admitted to Baptism; as before we have evinced.


That clause of descending from Abraham, and the belonging of the promise, is
of no weight in this Argument. For, 1 The parents by putting to death Christ,
had made themselves in wickedness worse then Gentiles. 2 That confession and
profession is expressly called for, only from them that were so apparently
wicked. 3 That if they did come in by repentance, the promise (says the
Apostle) presently runs to their children.


CHAP. XIII.
THe fourth Argument (says Mr. T.) is taken from the next Age after the
Apostles. Exercit. Sect. 17. The 4. Argument against Infant Baptism from the
practice in the next age after the Apostles.
That tenet and practice is doubtful, of which it cannot be proved, that it
was in force or use, in the next age after the Apostles: But it cannot be
proved, that the tenet or practice of Infant Baptism was in force, or use, in
the Age next after the Apostles. Ergo.

The major is of it self manifest. The minor is proved by the testimony of
Lodovicus Vives above-recited, to which Vossius in the sibus
Historico-Theologicis of Infant Baptism joins the testimony of Walafridus
Strabo, and by the examining of places brought to that purpose, and by the
continuation of questions propounded to the baptized in Ages following, and
others tokens from Councils and Ecclesiastical Writers, which in historical
business are wont to beget credit.

The words of Walafridus Strabo, who lived about the year, 840. in his book
Derebus Ecclesiasticis, Chap. 26. are these; We are also to note, that in the
first times the grace of Baptism was wont only to be given to them, who by
integrity both of body, and mind, were already come to this, that they could
know, and understand what profit is to be obtained in Baptism, what is to be
confessed, and believed, what lastly is to be observed of them that are born
again in Christ. Thus far Mr. T. and his quotation of Walafridus.

1. To Mr. T. his major we say, Animadvers.
that it is not of it self manifest. For what if we cannot produce any Records
of Antiquity for the use and practice of many things in the Age next to the
Apostles; are they therefore doubtful, when as we have the Word of God for
them? Therefore the mere failing of the Votes of humane Writers do not make a
thing doubtful: though the Papists urge us with the like Argument, that the
Protestant Churches are not true, because we cannot produce Histories, etc. to
show their succession in all Ages. If we fail in Records of Antiquity, we may
thank the Papists chiefly, who, as we may say, martyred by fire, and otherwise,
as well good books, as godly men: and yet the Truth according to Scripture
stands where it did.

To Mr. T. his minor we say, In general.

1. That Mr. T. tells us beside of Lodovicus Vives, and Wall. Strabo, of places
brought to that purpose, of the continuation of questions propounded to the
baptized in ages following, of other tokens from Councils, and of
Ecclesiastical Writers, but quotes them not; which is not the way to beget
credit in the judicious Reader. It were too much to believe every Author upon
his bare word, without other circumstances; and therefore by much more too much
to believe Authors not produced but only intimated by Mr. T.

2. Mr. Tombs gives us in, two late-men in comparison of the stream of ancient
Antiquity, which is contrary to those two.

3. If those two had been a considerable number, or had produced to us any
considerable Reasons, or quotations of Antiquity higher then themselves, or
any fair probabilities, or circumstances how they gather it, they would sooner
have begot credit, then as they are now proposed.

In particular, first, to Ludovicus Vives, we answered before in our Reply to
Mr. T. his 13. Sect. touching the Argument of the failing of the Churches
succession; in the 9. Chap. of our Animadversions. And we add now, that both
he and Walaf. Strabo speak as if they had not been acquainted with Antiquity
in this point, as will appear by and by from that we shall be able to quote.

2 To Walafridus Strabo, who is but of yesterday in comparison (by Mr. T. his
confession) to barely assert against higher approved Antiquity, We answer;
that if Mr. T. would but have gone on in the place he quoted out of the 26.
Chap. of that Wall. Strabo, de Rebus Ecclesiasticis, and translated a line or
two further, the world might have better seen what an acurat Antiquarie that
Strabo was. We will therefore translate onward immediately where Mr. T. left.

For the venerable Father Augustine (says W. Strabo) reports of himself in his
books of his Confessions, that he continued Catechumenus, a catechized person
almost to the twenty fifth year of his age, namely, to that intent, that by this
delay of time, he being well learned in every particular, he might be led by
his own free accord to choose that which he liked. Thus Walaf. Strabo.

Upon which, Ger. Joh. Vossius his observation is this. Thus far Walafridus
(says Vossius) in whose words, instead of the twenty fifth year (as he is in
printed copies. Bibl. p. p. T. 6. Ed. 2. and cited of learned men, Joseph vice
com. observe. Eccles. lib. 2. cap. 1. etc.) we ought to read the thirty fifth
year. For Augustine as appears by his books of his Confessions was converted in
the thirty first year of his age. For the two years following he continued
under catechizing, in which time he wrote against the Academici, and wrote his
Soliloquies. At thirty four years old he was baptized by Ambrose at Midain;
which declare with how weak an argument Walafridus does contend. Thus far Ger.
J. Vossius.

3 To Mr. T. his manner of quoting Vossius, as if Vossius added another
testimony to that of L. Vives, out of Walaf. Strabo against Infant Baptism.
We answer, Mr. T. does but hereby neatly occasion, if not cause the unlearned
to fall into a mistake; as if Vossius were against Infant Baptism, when as he
is altogether for it, with many Arguments, wherein is showed much divine
learning. He that has but Latin may read them at large. Ger. Joh. Voss. These.
Theolog. and Histor. Disput. de Paedobapt. These. 3. etc.

4 Mr. T. intimating a referring himself in this cause of the ancientnesse of
Infant Baptism, to Antiquity, Councils, Ecclesiastical Writers, etc. does
but reach down a rod for his own opinion, and a confutation of his minor
Proposition he pretended to prove by Antiquity. For the best antiquity of the
Fathers, etc. are for us against Mr. T. that Infant Baptism was in the next
Age to the Apostles, and so downwards: which (to follow Mr. T. in his own we
are forced to produce, and to refell Mr. T. and Mr. D. exceptions against some
of them (as alleged by some of us) that we may leave things clear as we go.

1 Justin Martyr Justin Maryr, says Bucholcerus, apologized for the
Christians, in the year 141 after Christ's birth. And was converted to
Christianity before that, in the year after Christ's birth, 130. says Helvious.
He was a professor of Philosophy, before his conversion, and therefore in all
likelihood was at least 20. years old, if not 30, at his conversion, and so
lived very near the time of John the Apostle, who dyed not till about Ann. 200
after the birth of Christ. And therefore Justin Martyr mu^^ needs know the
customs in the Apostles days.
in his books unquestionably his, in some things we cast our eye upon (for we
had not time now to read over Pamphlets of this question, much less volumnes)
seems to hint something toward Infant Baptism, in his Dialogue, Cum Tryph.
Jud: Have ye not read that, that soul should be cut off from his genoration
which shall not be circumcised the eighth day. And this is equally established
concerning strangers, or those bought with money. This Covenant therefore or
Testament you despising, you neither have any regard of the Commandments
following; and then adjoynes. There is now need of another circumcision, etc.
And in his 2 Apol. (...), After washing in that manner, we bring him that has
believed, and is joined to us, unto the biethren as they are called, where they
are gathered together, and make prayers and supplications in common, both for
them selves, and for him that has been eluminated (that is baptized) etc.

Again in his Dialog. cum Tryphone, he opposes baptism with water to
baptizing with sin; but we are baptized with sin when children. (...).

Again one in a Treatise which goes under the name of Justin Martyr, namely, in
the Questions to the orthodox. Question and Answer 56. disputes the different
condition of children dying baptized, EXAMEN. Perk. prepara. to the Demonstrat.
of the Problem. Rivet. Crit. Sacer. R. Cook of Leeds, Censur. patrum. Exercit.
and unbaptized. Therefore children were baptized in his time.

Mr. T. in his Examen. objecteth, that it is proved by Mr. Perkins, by Rivet,
and by Cook, that the Quest. ad orthodox were not Justin Martyrs, for as much
as they mention not only Irenaeus, but also Origin, and the Manichees.

We answer. Although we will not peremptorily pronounce that those Questions
and Answers ad Orthodoxos were Justin Martyrs, nevertheless it does not yet
appear to us as infallibly proved by Mr. T. his Arguments, that those Quest. ad
Orthodox. were none of his. 1. For the mention of the Manichees there is a
mistake. The place where the Manichees are mentioned; is not affirmed by diverse
learned men Cook. cens. patr. Rivet. Crit. Sacer. Possevin. App.
to be in the Questions to the orthodox, but in Quaestiouib. and Responsionib.
ad Graecos, there we find them often mentioned Resp. ad Qu. primam, etc. often.
Perk.
. For mention of the Manichees in the Questions ad Orthodoxos, once, in some
copies, in Quaest. 127. Mr. T. has it but out of one Author. And very likely
it was thrust in to the Quest. ad orthod. in latter times by the Scribes. For
the sense is perfect without it. And the inserting is but in manner of a
quotation, to explain how in those times Justin Martyr met with some opinions
then arising, which in aftertimes grew infamously famous, got an head, and a
Name of Manicheisme: which being known to the Scribes of latter times, they
might put in the name Maniche, as answerable to the thing disputed, and for the
information of the Reader. Who that is a Scholar does not know that Marginall
notes on books at last have crept into the Text? Many instances might be given
of books of many sorts. So then this reason is not a certain evincing Argument;
that the Qu. ad. orthod. are not Justin Martyrs.

2. To the mention of Irenaeus we say, Resp. ad Qu. 115. ad orthod.
that this Argument is weak also. For, first, Justin Martyr is put in Anno 130.
after Christ. And they say he was martyred not till Anno 165 Helvic.
. yea some say not till 169 Buchol.
. And Irenaeus was a Bishop Anno 170; and therefore must needs be famous many
years before Justin Martyrs death; and therefore well might they quote one
another in their books. But to allow more then Mr. T. objects, namely, as some
object, that Justin Martyr in the said place calls Irenaeus martyr, when as he
was martyred long after Justin Martyrs death. We answer, that if that word
Martyr were not put in by some late Scribe since, for the honor and
distinction of the man, however in the English the word martyr be taken, yet
usually in Latin, and more constantly in the Greek, it signifies only a
witness. And Irenaeus was a famous witness to the truth by pen and profession
in Justin Martyrs time, though not by blood. Again, if Martyr be taken for a
sufferer, yet not always for a sufferer by death: Isaac is said to be
persecuted by Ishmael only mocking him. Gal. 4.29. Genesis 21.9. Which kind of
oppositions, and worse, Irenaeus no doubt met with in those persecuting times
of his, and of Justins, as forerunners of the effusion of their blood.

3. To the mention of Origin, in his Qu. ad orthodox. Resp. ad qu. 82. and 86.
we say, that Chronologers and Historians (those few we could cast a look upon)
are so uncertain about the life and death of these two Fathers as is
wonderful. Bucholcer.
It is confessed by some, that Origin and Justin Martyr were within some 14 or
15 years one of another. And we heard before that some made Justin Martyr far
longer lived then others did; now if indeed (as who knows to the contrary)
either Origin was born sooner, or Justin Martyr lived longer, but a few years;
Justin Martyr might well hear of Origin; who was a great Scholar, very young,
even before he was 18 years old: and wrote soon, and much, in all 7000 books,
as Hieroni reports.

I confess for my part (I speak my conscience) if that be all the objection, I
should sooner believe men's writings quoting one another, as sufficient
testimonies that they lived some years at the same time when it is near confessed
by Authors, then to doubt of such because some Chronologers or Historians
cipher or say them to be 14 or 15 years after one another. But where does these
Questions ad orthodoxos quote Origin? we can find but two. One in the Answer to
the 82. Quest. on which let any ingenuous man look and observe how he is named
(if he,) in the last close of all, and the fullness of the Answer, without
mention of the supposed Origin, and he will say, verily this was but some
marginall Note since Justin Martyr, thrust into the Text. The other place is in
the beginning of the Answer to the 86. Question, and therefore very likely to
be thrusted too into the text. For let a man put out the first words, (...), It
is expounded by Origin, and yet the sense will be full thus: That to a man that
is skillful in the Hebrew tongue, there is an interpretation of all the Hebrew
names in the Scripture. Which is further strengthened, because in the close it
is said, (...) not (...) that is, if you consult that interpretation, not that
Origin (if he). Besides, a man that is critically skilled in the Greek, which I
profess not, he would happily examine, if Origin be here quoted, first, why
(...) man is needlessly put in. And whether it be so proper to construe the verb
passive (...) is interpreted by Origin, there being no praeposition, according
to the usual rule. And lastly, whether (...) be not some other word signifying
some other thing then a proper name to fignifie Origin. We could give instance
but for haste.

But to give Mr. T. an Objection which he does not make: to wit, that the Qu.
ad orthodox. are not thought to be Justin Martyrs, because in them there is
such contradictions contrary to what is said in Justin Martyrs works (as Mr. T.
his R. Cook observes) as that in the 52. Qu. ad orthodox. it is said the
Witch, 1 Samuel 28. did delude the eyes of all the beholders that they might
think it was Samuel. But in his Dialog-cum Tryphone, the contrary is affirmed.
Qu. 142. ad Orthodox. it is said, that it was a created Angel, that talked with
Jacob; but in his Dialogue cum Tryphone, he proves him to be an uncreated Angel.

To which we answer. That so learned Tossanus observes upon Augustine, that he
sometimes contradicts himself in those books which he accounts the very book of
Augustus. M. T. knew learned Mr. P. who would say, Can any mere man write much,
and not in any thing contradict himself? And for the instances they are not of
moment. As one Angel talked with Jacob, so he saw many more. There might be a
material body patcht up by the devil, according to the sphere of angelical
power, and yet he must delude the eyes of the beholders too, to make them think
it was Samuels real body.

Mr. T. goes on against those Qu. ad orthodox. Now (says he) what does this
Bastard Treatise say?

Answ. These are sesquipedalia verba, high words. For, first, by this we have
said; it may appear that it is not yet so out of doubt that the Qu. ad
Orthodoxos are not Justin Martyrs. Secondly, there are failings enough in the
other Treatises of Justin Martyrs, by which these Questions are judged.
Thirdly, that there are not wanting men of great learning that think the said
Questions may be accounted of like Authority with the rest of the Treatises,
though they were not truly Justin Martyrs. And Scultetus says, that though
this Treatise be not Justin Martyrs, yet not to be rejected, there being many
Gemmes, though mixed with some chafe. And H. Grotius on Matthew. 19.14. quotes
them with as great respect, as other Fathers, yea so quotes this 56. qu.

Well, and what does Mr. T. say to this Treatise which he so calls Bastard?
This: He translated all the whole 56t. Question and Answer, named Justin
Martyrs ad Orthodox. The Qu. and Answer, of the named Justin Martyr, in full as
Mr. T. translates it, is this. Qu. If Infants dying have neither praise nor
blame by works, what is the difference in the resurrection of those that have
been baptized by others, and have done nothing, and of those that have not been
baptized, and in like manner have done nothing? Answ. This is the difference of
the baptized from the not baptized, that the baptized obtien good things (
meaning at the resurrection) by baptism: but the unbaptized obtein not good
things. And they are accounted worthy of the good things they have by their
Baptism, by that faith of those that bring them to Baptism, So Mr. T. ^is
translat.
and then Mr. T. makes these observations upon it. 1 That In those times they
did not baptize Infants upon Mr. Marshals ground, namely, upon the Covenant of
Grace, made to them and their Infants. 2 But they baptized them, because they
thought the not-baptized should not obtein good things at the resurrection, but
the baptized should. 3 That those baptized Infants obtained those good things
by reason of the faith of the bringers, what ever the parents were. 4 That
therefore they baptized the children of unbeleevers, as well as of believers if
they were brought. Mr. T. hoping by this translation, and these Notes, to bring
the Author, and his words into disgrace, as he himself hints it to us.


But we answer in general, that Mr. T. has likewise quoted Authors, and among
them even his much esteemed Ludovicus Vives that have had their harsh
expressions and worse, as before we have noted. 2. The intent and manner of
quoting the Quest. to the orthodox, was only to testify that the baptism of
Infants was a known custom in those times.

In particular, we answer, first to his first observation, that the said 56.
Question, was not urged by my self, or Mr. T. to prove baptism of Infants upon
the ground of the Covenant. But the question being whether in point of Fact,
the Churches used anciently to baptize Infants? to that the quotation of those
Questions named. Justin Martyrs was alleged, and to that it serves fitly and
fully. For he was a very ancient Author, in the judgment of diverse learned
men. Sylburgius thinks that he was a Justin that might write about the time of
Theodoret. But Photius thinks that it might be Justin Martyr, interlined by
some other Justin or other after; as Ruffinus dealt by Origin, as Mr. T.
confesses.

To Mr. T. second observation we answer. That as we that are believers (as it
is in the Answer to that 56. Question) cannot applaud, nor comfort our selves
in a willing neglect of baptizing our children according to the Gospel
institution (as we now stand to maintain) so doubtless we are to expect good
things on Gods part to our children according to the intent of Baptism. We
find it so on earth in their comfortable application of baptism at ripe years;
and why not then to believe the fruit of it in heaven, if they dye in
childhood? Why may not Baptism as well comfort the supposed Justin Martyr, and
us, as Circumcision did the Patriarks concerning their childrens receiving the
first seal. This expression in this 56. Question and Answer is esteemed by
Grotius on Matthew. 19.14. (whom Mr. T. so often quotes) (...), etc.

To his third observation we answer. That there is no such clause or intimation
in the said place of the 56. Quest. ad orthodox. as Mr. T. here inserts,
namely, [ what ever the parents be]. The contrary is more probable; the Author
calling the bringers of the Infants [ beleevers]. And who so likely to bring
the children, as the parents. And therefore the parents here most probably are
those believers. And whereas Mr. T. renders (...) [ worthy] worthy of good
things, he might by warrant from the Gospel As Matthew. 10.11. enquire (...), who
is fit, or meet, that is to receive you, as it is expounded in v. 14.
have rendered it by a more orthodox and fit term, viz. [ meet] or [ fit]. And
lastly, it being more probable then any thing Mr. T. can bring to the contrary,
that the children were brought to baptism by their believing parents, and so
made meet for good things as the fruit of it, let the Reader judge whether all
this does not imply that respect here might be had to the Covenant of grace as
the ground of baptizing children; which Mr. T. but now so peremptorily denied,
as if it were infallibly contrary to the Text of the Author.

To his fourth observation we need say no more but that Mr. T. speaks it
without all warrant, or such probability from the text of the Author, as there
is in it to the contrary.

Now let the world judge whether the words of the Author, considering his time,
are so vain, or so impertinent, as Mr. T. would meke them, had they been
alleged in full, and beyond that the quotation extended to.

Thus for Justin Martyr. Next we come to Irenaeus, IRENAEVS.
who lived in the same century, namely, in the next age to the Apostles, and
not at the last end of that age neither. For Bucholcerus (one of the most
approved Chronologers by Usher) puts him in the year after Christ, 178. And
Helvicus puts him higher, namely, in the year, Testis. D. H. secum enutritus.
170. And both of them put him down as Bishop at that time (of Lions, says
Bucholcerus) and therefore was famous no doubt diverse years before, and an
observer of the customs of the Churches. Having this advantage for that
purpose, that he was the Scholar of Polycarp, as Polycarp was Scholar or
disciple to some of the Apostles, as diverse Chronologers tell us.

That which Irenaeus has to our purpose in the point in hand, is in his 2
Book, 39. Chap. about the middle. His words are these. Magister ergo existens,
etc. that is, Therefore being a teaching Master, he had also the age of such a
Master, not refusing, or going beyond a man, nor dissolving the law of humane
kind in himself, but sanctifying every age by that similitude that was in him
to it. For he came to save all men by himself; All I say, who by him are
BORN-AGAIN unto, or, into God, INFANTS and LITTLE-ONES, boys, and young men,
and elder men. Therefore he went through every age, and was made an Infant, to
Infants, sanctifying Infants. Among little ones, a little one, sanctifying them
that have this age: being also made an example to them of piety, and justice
or righteousness, and subjection. Among young men being made a young man, and
sanctifying them to the Lord; so also an elder, to the elder, that he might be
a perfect teaching master, not only according to the exposition of truth, but
also according to age, sanctifying the elder, being made also an example to
them. And then he went also unto death, that he might be the firstborn from
the dead, holding the primacy in all things, etc. So Irenaeus. Whom we have
translated above and beneath the place we are to use, that there might be the
less exception by any, that they could not see the coherence and scope of the
place. The words we stand upon in which Irenaeus intimates the baptism of
Infants in that his time, next after the Apostles, are, [ All I say, who by him
are BORN AGAIN unto, or into God, or according to God INFANTS, and LITTLE ONES,
etc.] The word Renascuntur, that is, regenerated, or newborn, or born again,
signifying, or implying Baptism. So the Scriptures, so Irenaeus, and the
Fathers mean by Born-again, new born, or regenerated, though Mr. T. denies it.

Scriptures. The first Scripture is in Joh. 3.5. Except a man be born again of
water and the Spirit. Where the Spirit signifies the inward work, accompanying
or following (where God converts) the outward sign, seal, and conveighance of
Baptism; as we have before discussed this place, where we have given you the
general consent of orthodox Authors, and some Reasons, that the water of
Baptism is here understood. We now add, first, the water of baptism must be
here meant, because of the order: water is put first, the Spirit next. Now
where a metaphorical epithet, or word is put to set forth the nature of the
Spirit, the Spirit is put first, and the metaphorical term or word after.
Matthew. 3. Baptized with the holy Ghost and fire, that is, with the holy Ghost
which is like fire. Secondly, Christ is speaking to Nicodemus one of the
Pharisees, who did put much in outward, legal, and ceremonious washings, Mark
7.1, 2, etc. Therefore doubtless Christ would apply his speech suitable to the
condition of Nicodemus, to take him off that washing, by propounding to him the
Gospel washing of Baptism, already begun by John Baptist, on which usually
followed an inward effectual work of washing by the Spirit. Both these Reasons
are hinted by Beza, who by all means would rather have an external washing
here meant, beside the inward of the Spirit. And prevents an objection; that
grace is not here tied to the Sacrament of Baptism, the peculiar Sacrament of
regeneration (says he) no more then it is to the Lords Supper. Ioh. 6.53.
Besides, says he, there is mention after of the Spirit without water. Thirdly,
regeneration is attributed to the outward and more common means of preaching
the Word, 1 Pet. 1.23. why not therefore to Baptism the peculiar Sacrament of
regeneration? And so Nicodemus has here for the business in hand which is his
conversion, all three means completely represented to him, Christ's word,
Baptism, and the holy Spirit.

We list not to abound in proof of a thing so plain, and commonly received. If
one or two think otherwise, it is not of weight to say so without proof. Nor do
I know any reason why any should dissent, unless for a dream of tying grace to
Sacraments which ( Beza and others excellently take off) or for fear of men's
private interests in an argument which is not considerable.

The second Scripture is, Tit. 3.5. According to his mercy he saved us, by the
washing of regeneration, and renewing of the holy Ghost. Where washing
(according to diverse learned orthodox Authors) signifies or implies Baptism.
The reasons that evince our consent is, 1. That the word (...) for washing,
signifies not so much the act of bare washing, as the place where the water is,
and the action is done. For it signifies a Bath or laver of water; and
therefore cannot be so fitly applied to the inward washing of the Spirit, as to
outward baptism. 2 The spiritual working of the Spirit follows in the next
clause, The making of us new by the Spirit. 3 It is usual with the holy Ghost
to call the whole work by the name of the outward sign of baptism. Gal. 3.27.
Col. 2.12. even as Circumcision is called the Covenant, Genesis 17. though but the
sign or seal of the Covenant.


Thus of the Scriptures, that by the words, born again, new born, or the like,
is signified or employed baptism: sutably to Scriptures.

Secondly, Irenaeus takes his own word Renascuntur, that is, born again, or new
born, to signify baptism. Compare that place of Irenaeus lib. 1. cap. 18.
where speaking of the corruptions by Heretics touching redemption, and
Baptism, etc. he has these words in the beginning of the Chapter. This kind
(that is of Sect) was sent by Satan for the denying of the Baptism of
regeneration, or new birth toward or according to God, and for the destruction
of the whole faith. This place clears the thing, and Mr. T. his exceptions;
which are, 1 possibly this might not be Irenaeus his words. 2 That Irenaeus is
corrupted by the Latin Translation (we wanting the Greek copy.) To which we
answer. That this quotation out of the first book and 18. Chap. of Irenaeus
takes away both objections. For Mr. T. his Rivet confesses, That the first 27.
Chapters of the first book of Irenaeus are inserted in Epiphanius his Panarium,
which we have in Greek. And so much of Irenaeus entirely is to be had in Greek
in Irenaeus his works. And accordingly Epiphanius says, that That circumcision
continued serving to the time, till the greater circumcision came, which is the
laver of regeneration. So Epiphan. lib. 2. cap. 28. We have not time to seek
more; though he speaks often of baptism; sometimes calling it the great
circumcision, sometimes only the laver, etc.

But Mr. T. objects, Mr. T. EXAMEN. Sect. 4.
that Voss. These. Theolog. de Paedobapt. intimates that the proper acception of
renascuntur, that is, born again, or newborn, is to signify sanctification.

We answer. Vossius does not speak so much for Mr. T. but against him in this
point, Animadvers.
as we conceive. Whether we conceive aright, let the Reader judge. Vossius his
words are these. We can prove by apparent testimonies of them that lived before
the Pelagian Heresy, that Infants were baptized. Such a testimony is Irenaeus.
lib. 2. cap. 39. Where he says Christ came to save all by himself, all I say,
who by him are born-again, or newborn by him, toward God, infants and little
ones, etc. where by the word born again, or new birth, is set forth Baptism
according to the common form of speech of the Ancients. Although if we take the
word born-again curiously, yet in as much as Irenaeus says, regeneration is in
Infants. It sufficiently refuteth the opinion of them, who endeavor by this
Argument to prove that because regeneration (as they think) may not be in
Infants, that therefore they may not be signed with the outward sign. So
Vossius.

But Mr. T. objects again, M. T. EXAM. Sect. 4.
that Irenaeus his scope is to confute the Gnostics that hold Christ did not
exceed 31. years of age, against whom Irenaeus alleges that Christ lived in
every age, that by his age and example he might sanctify every age.

We answer. Animadvers.
But Irenaeus lays the foundation of his sanctifying all sorts of ages in
this, that they are newborn by Christ to Godward both Infants and little ones;
and then follows, he was made an Infant to Infants to sanctify them: having
before regenerated them; whereof what sign is there to us, but Gods
institution and act that Infants should have the first seal?

But Mr. T. yet further objects, Mr T. EXAM. Sect. 4.
that Irenaeus speaks not of baptism, because he says, Born again by him,
that is by Christ.

We answer. Animadvers.
That Mr. T. well knows subordinate things are not contrary. Christ regenerates
therefore does he not do it by his Ordinances, Word, Baptism, etc? We have
heard before that though Christ be the Author of our salvation, yet it is said
we are born again by water and the Spirit. And that for the conjunction of the
sign and thing signified, the thing signified is called by the name of the
sign. We add, Ephesians. 5.26.1 Pet. 1.23. where it is said, that we are
sanctified by the washing of water by the Word; And we are born again by the
Word of God; and yet we know Christ by his Spirit, is the Author of these.

3 Others of the approved Ancients as Commentators on Irenaeus call baptism,
by the name of regeneration. Nazianzen calls Baptism (...), the laver of
regeneration, or of the new birth. Nazianz. Orat. 402. in Sanct. Bapt.
Augustine says, As by the first man, men are born in sin and death, so by
Christ [renascuntur] they are born again in or into righteousness and eternal
life, in or through baptism. Aug. lib. de Bapt. and hab. and Cons. Ambrose
says, God the omnipotent Father who has regenerated thee of water, and the
holy Spirit. Ambros. de Sacram. Hieronimus. The bloody bodies of Infants are
washed as soon as they are born; so the spiritual generation stands in need of
the saving laver. Hieron. lib. 4. Ezekiel. ca. 16. More might be alleged, but
these enough to clear the business in hand, that Irenaeus meant by being
born-again, or regenerated; Baptism.

But Mr. T. objects, Mr. T. EXAMEN. Sect. 4. p. 7.
that Irenaeus says, Christ was fifty years old, a^ he had received it from
those that conversed with John the Apostle; and thereby Mr. Tombs would
blemish Irenaeus his testimony.

We answer. Animad.
First, men have their mistakes, else they were not men but as Angels.
Secondly, Mr. T. referred us to far worse Authors, full of superstitions, in
Scham. before. And his Ludovicus Vives, and his Walafridus we and Vossius too
have noted before, for their gross expressions and mistakes. Thirdly, which is
mainly to the point, Irenaeus says, Infants may be born again, that is
baptized, as from himself; though he reports the whole age of Christ from
others, who if they wrote his age by ciphers, in aftertimes fifty might easily
be mistaken for thirty.

The third and last Author we will urge from this first age, TERTVLLIAN.
or first hundred years or century next following the Apostles time, is
Tertullian. Whom Helvicus puts in the latter end of the age before said, namely,
in the year after Christ 195. which was as about the 95 year after the death of
John the Evangelist. But the same Helvicus says this of him (put in that year)
out of Eusebius and Hieron. That he put forth his book of Praescriptions, and
that he was the third Latin Writer. And Bucholcerus mentions him as famous
about the year after Christ 208, that is 108. after St. John, that is but about
thirteen years after the time set down by Helvicus. For he says that about
that time, Hieron. in Catalogo.
Cyprian (as Hieron testifies) did ascribe so much to Tertullians writings,
that when he called for one of his Authors or Writers, he would say, Da
Magistrum, that is, Give me my Master, when he meant Tertullian. Therefore he
wrote diverse years before.

The words of Tertullian to the point in hand of Infant Baptism, Lib. de Anim.
cap. 39. and 40. are these; Hinc enim and Ap^st. etc. that is, For hence also
the Apostle affirms that of either sex sanctified are procreated those that
are holy, as by the prerogative of SEED, so by the discipline or rule of
institution. But they were born unclean, as if by this nevertheless he would
have it understood that the children of believers are [designatos] the designed
ones of holiness, and thereby also of salvation; that these pledges of hope
might patronage those marriages, which he had judged to be kept (undissolved.)
Otherwise he had minded the Lords determination, Unless one be born of water
and of the Spirit, he shall not enter into the Kingdom of God, that is, He
shall not be holy. So every soul is counted to be in Adam till he be recounted
to be in Christ; and so long to be impure, till he be recounted. Thus
Tertullian. Whence note first by the way, how the opinion of Antiquity touching
that place, 1 Cor. 7.14. is contrary to Mr. Tombs his opinion. Secondly,
directly to the point in hand of the Baptism of the children of believers, he
holds forth these Notions.

First the birthright of believers Infants, the parents and children being both
under that promise, I am the God of thee and thy seed. They are (says
Tertullian) by the Sanctification of one of the Parents, procreated holy,
partly by the praerogative of the SEED (I am the God of thee believing Abraham,
and of thy seed, Genesis 17.7.) partly by the discipline of Institution (THEREFORE
thou shall keep my Covenant to give the first seal to every male of thy seed,
Genesis 17.9. Or Act. 2. The promise is to you, and you being called, to your
children also.) So that Tertullian means that the children of believers are
reputatively and federally holy: Which is the more plain by that which follows,
of counted in Adam and recounted in Christ.

Secondly, The capacity of children, of grace and Salvation (and consequently
of the seal, for the deeds and their seals follow the right of the inheritance;
so all along the Scripture, as we have showed in part) I say Tertullian shows
childrens capacity of grace, 1. In mentioning their being holy. For its in vain
to talk of accounting holy, if none may be holy; yea therefore God will have
believers children indefinitly accounted holy, because he has made some holy
in their childhood, Isaac, Jacob, Samuel, John Baptist, those Mar. 10. etc. 2.
In mentioning that place, John 3.5. in relation to children; Except a man be
born again of water and the Spirit, etc. From all which we may perceive, that
Tertullian grounds Infant Baptism upon Scripture, not upon unwritten Tradition.

Nor is it my opinion only, that this place of Tertullian is for
Infant Baptism, but of learned Vossius too, (whom Mr. T. so often quotes with
respect:) For Vossius by this place proves that it was the mind of Tertullian
in that noted place of Chap. 18. H. D. Mr T. in his 10th Argument.
of his book De Baptismo, That Infants should be Baptized; which some allege
against Infant Baptism, but is indeed for it. Tertullians words are these.
Itaeque pro cujusque personae etc. Therefore according to every persons
condition, disposition, and age, the delay of baptism is more profitable; but
especially concerning little children. For what necessity is there [ Those
words between [] Junius says may be left out: Mr T. in his 10th Argument
leaves them out. But in the best Editions of Tertullian they are in. Vossius
takes them in and alleges them.
If it be not so much a necessity] as to have witnesses also in the danger? The
Lord says indeed, forbid them not to come unto me; let them come therefore,
when they grow up to youth, etc. So Tertullian in the aforesaid book concerning
baptism. Upon which place Vossius These. Theolog. and Hist. de Paedob.
says thus; We think that nothing is here denied but only the necessity of
baptism, when there is no danger of death; for that is the meaning of those
words [What necessity, if there be not so much necessity as, etc.] but in no
case did he deny that Infants might be baptized; yea and if there be danger
least afterward they be not baptized, its plain they ought to be baptized,
which we do not obscurely discern by that which Tertullian writes in his book
of the soul, and the 39. and 40. chapter, and then recited the words, which
before we quoted and translated to you. Thus Vossius.

Give us but leave to give you learned and pious Iunius his note too on this
place of Tertullian, and we shall have done with Tertullian. The words of
Iunius are these: Tria hic distinct proponit Auctor, Notae Franc. Junii, ad
Tertul. de Baptis.
etc. that is, The Author propunds here three things distinctly, which being
rightly understood, the place is most holy. 1. The CONDITION of persons to be
baptized is that they be in Covenant, whether they be of age, or little
children. 2. DISPOSITION is when they believe, and obey the Gospel, and make
profession. 3. They are not accounted to be OF AGE which are in covenant (for
the little children of Godly men are in Covenant) but who so profess the faith.
Therefore when he says ESPECIALLY CONCERNING LITTLE CHILDREN, that must needs
be understood of the children of strangers or Forraigners, not of the children
of those that are in Covenant, and so domestic or of the family of the Church;
as is confirmed by the following Aetiologie or GIVING THE CAUSE, namely what
necessity is there, if there be not so much necessity as for witnesses or
Godfathers and Godmothers etc. For we know that the first invention of
witnesses was for the children whose parents could not be accounted members of
the Church. Mr T. his objections after against Tertul are prevented here, and
further answered in the 14 chap. of our Animadversions at the word CYPRIAN in
the Margin.


That this was the mind of these Authors, Justin Martyr, Irenaeus and
Tertullian in this age next after the Apostles, will further appear by the
consent of the most approved Ancients that followed them in the next succeeding
ages, which we have thought most proper to defer to the next chapter of our
Animadversions upon Mr T. his fifth Argument.

CHAP. XIIII.
THE fifth Argument:

That which in succeeding Ages, in which it was in use, Exercitat. Argu. 4. 17.
The Argument from the wrong original of Infant Baptism, confirmed against it.
was in force, 1 as a Tradition not written; 2 Out of imitation of Jewish
Circumcision; 3 Without universal practice; 4 Together with the error of
giving Infants the Lords supper, and many other humane inventions, under the
name of Apostolical traditions;
That is deservedly doubtful.

But in some ages after the first from the Apostles, the tenet and practice of
Infant Baptism was in use, 1 as a tradition not written, as appears from
Origin, Hom. on Romans 6. Of which book nevertheless let me add the censure of
Erasmus on the Homilies of Origin upon Leviticus, But he that reads this work,
and the enarration of the Epistle to the Romans, is uncertain whether he read
Origin or Ruffinus. And the testimony fetched from these books for
Infant Baptism, is so much the more to be suspected, because Augustine,
Hierom, etc. rely (so far as yet is manifest to me) on no other testimony, then
of Cyprian and his fellow-Bishops in the Council, of which mention is made
Epist. 59. ad Fidum.

Secondly, out of imitation of Jewish Circumcision, as the doubt of Fidus, in
the 59. Epistle of Cyprian to Fidus, intimates, though there were also other
reasons of Infant Baptism; as the opinion of the necessity of Baptism to
salvation, and the greediness to increase the number of Christians, and
perhaps the imitation of heathenish lustration of little ones; and some other.

Thirdly, without universal practice: for it is manifest that Constantine,
although borne of Helena his mother, a Christian, was not baptized till aged,
as Eusebius in the life of Constantine written by him. The same is manifest
from the book of Confessions of Augustine, concerning Augustine himself,
whose mother Monica was a Christian. The things which may be drawn out of
Theodoret, Augustine, and others, concerning Theodosius, Alipius, Adeodatus,
and many others (although my books and notes out of them are wanting to me, by
reason of the injury of the times) unless I be deceived, will evince that
(though in the Churches of those times, little ones were baptized, yet) many
were not baptized, whose baptism its likely the Church would sooner have
dispatched, if the opinion of Baptism that now obtains, had then obtained.

Fourthly, together with the error of giving the Lords supper to Infants, as is
manifest out of the book of Cyprian de lapsis, and others. And that many other
Inventions of men, under the name of Apostolical tradition, out of a wrong
likeing of Judaism did then prevail, as the Paschall solemnity etc. is so
obvious to him that reads Fathers, and Ecclesiastical Writers, that no man
will need proof. Ergo.

And in very deed, as of old, because the right of Infant Baptism seemed to be
of so great moment against the Pelagian heresy, and for the authority of the
Council under Cyprian, the Council of Milevis, Augustine, Hierom, and others,
rather then for any solid argument out of Scripture in former ages,
Infant Baptism prevailed; so in this last age, some modern men seem to
embrace this tenet of Infant Baptism out of horror of mind, least they should
go headlong into the pernicious errors of former Anabaptists, and their mad
furies, or least they should seem to desert the leading-men of the reformed
Churches, or move troubles in the Church; rather then from perspicuous
foundation in the Scriptures; which they will think that I have not said as
one that dreams, who shall read what Robert Lord, Brook has in the end of
his Treatise concerning Episcopacy; Daniel Rogers in his Treatise of Baptism,
and others elsewhere.

We Answer. Animadver.
1. To the major; Take away the captain or leading particular to wit [A
tradition not written] and all the souldiary of the other particulars with the
great Rear [to wit, Many other humane inventions] are not strong enough to make
a true major proposition. For what if according to Mr T. his ad particular of
[Iewish] that Baptism be an imitation of the Jewish passing through the red
sea, 1 Cor. 10.1. etc. And the Lords Supper an imitation of the Jewish
passover, 1 Cor. 5. and of the Jewish Manna, and water out of the rock, 1 Cor.
10.1. etc is therefore all Baptism, and is therefore the Lords Supper
deservedly doubtful, whether they may be used? Yea, why does Mr T. without any
limitation call circumcision Jewish; as if it had been merely so, when the
Apostle calls it, Romans 4.11. The signs and seal of the righteousness of
faith. Note.
It had been too much for Mr T. to have called it mere Old Testament or
ceremonious circumcision, seeing it is the first seal of the covenant with
Abraham which was Gospel being the main hinge upon which the New Testament
moves, in the main point of salvation by faith in Christ. Act. 2. Romans 4. Gal.
3. where the Apostles in sending us to Christ by faith, urges Gods Covenant
with Abraham. Circumcision therefore annexed to the covenant, must be in
diverse respects of the same nature; as under the notion of the first seal; in
regard of the spiritual signification, inward sanctification; and too in
respect of application, to teach that still the first Seal, as now baptism, is
to be applied as to the believing parents, so to their Infant seed; unless Mr
T. could have all this while showed us an exception.

And what if, according to Mr T. his third particular of [Not universal
practise] Moses neglected the circumcision of his child at the due time, and
circumcision was not exercised upon the Jews born in the wilderness for 40
years; and many parts of worship could not be used in the times of the Churches
persecution; but Churches and their worship were hid in corners as Revel. 12.
And we have not records to tell us what they did for many hundred of years,
but intimations how they were abridged of their liberties. Now does this make
any of these things doubtful? See Vossius. These. Theolet Histor. De Paedobapt.
And our quotation after Ambros. following.
No more does the want of universal practice detract from the authority of
administering baptism to believers Infants; especially seeing the Pelagian
faction and other Heresies, before that so ancient, and so over spreading the
Christian world, being also opposite to the baptism of Infants, might be a
great cause that, it was not universally practiced. And it is no handsome
Argument in the mouth of an Anabaptist to urge the Non-universall practice of
Infant Baptism, when many of their fellows have been the cause of it. Nor is it
enough to wave that we have said to these two particulars, viz. the second and
third; by telling us there was an institution of Circumcision in scripture, an
institution of Baptism of men, and of the Lords Supper in the Scripture; for
so we have proved there is of Infant Baptism; and we may as well assert this,
in this our Answer, as for the Anabaptists to beg the Question in the
objection; as if Infant Baptism were not instituted in Scripture.

For the fourth particular with its great and caetera; namely, That together
with the baptism of Infants some error, and many humane traditions have gone
along in the company, as giving Infants the Lords Supper, etc. It needs no long
nor careful answer. For first we know that all the Ordinances of Christ have
been for many hundreds of years for the general, daubed with many traditions,
and darkened with many errors, by the Papists; doctrines mixed with Legends,
Note.
Baptism be-spitled, greased with oil, brined with salt, the wine of the Lords
Supper mixed with water, etc. yet this does not infer that therefore the
Ordinances themselves are doubtful. 2. That though you Mr T. Vltro nos
provocasti have voluntarily provoked us here to rip up all the abominable
opinions, and dangerous errors and practices that have in all ages accompanied
the opinion of Anabaptisme, and antipaedobaptisme out of Mr Bullinger; Sleidens
Commentaries in his 5. and 10. book: Lambertus Hortensius of the Anabaptiss of
the Low Countries, John Gastius of the Anabaptists of Zuitzerland, Melancthon,
Chapter de Nielles, Pontanus, Osiander, etc.
All which will more then furnish the Reader with a full answer to the 2 part
of Mr T. his EXAMEN, the title or sum whereof is set down by Mr T. That
Antipaedobaptisme has no ill influence on Church or Commonwealth, which
Authors aforesaid have too many sad instances of both; we forbear to name them
as having no delight in Catalogues of sins.
Yet if we should do so, you would not take that for a proof of the
doubtfulnesse of Anabaptisme, or Antipaedobaptisme; you would say we did rather
endeavor to disgrace it, then to confute it; as it is your complaint against
Mr M. in your first Section of the second part of your EXAMEN; why then do you
here labor to dazzle the eyes of men against the Lawfulness of baptizing
believers children, with an aspersion that some odd opinions and traditions
have attended it?

2. To Mr T. his minor, we answer according to the particulars he recites, But
in some ages (says he) after the first from the Apostles the tenet and
practice of Infant Baptism was in use, first as a tradition not written. But
why does Mr T. (we wonder) speak of some ages after the first (100 years) from
the Apostles? For unless he could prove Infant Baptism to be an unwritten
tradition, in the first age next after the Apostles, all is to no purpose. If
it were not an unwritten tradition in that age; it is not an unwritten one,
though all the ages following to the worlds end say so, and swear it. Nor do
the words [was in use] help him.

For if it be not proved it was an unwritten tradition in the first age after
the Apostles, though it was not then in use, this is nothing to make it then an
unwritten tradition.

Now to the first particular wherein Mr T. says Infant Baptism was in use as
an unwritten tradition in some ages after the first from the Apostles, witness
Origin.

First we will bring our proofs of antiquity to the contrary; and then
secondly answer to Mr T. his quotation of Origin.

1 For proof out of Antiquity, that Infant Baptism was not in use after the
first age from the Apostles upon mere unwritten tradition; we will take our
Authors according to order of time.

1 ORIGIN, ORIGIN.
Flourished about the very beginning of the second Century, or age after the
first from the Apostles times: For he was borne So Butholcer out of Hieron.
in the first Age or 100 years after that of the Apostles, about the year of
Christ 186. And he being the Disciple of Clement, in the 18 year of his age,
and about the year after Christ 204. opens his school Helvic. ou^ of Eusebius.
. Therefore he could not be ignorant of the customs of the Apostles about
Infant Baptism, etc. First his words in his fifth book upon the sixth chapter
of the Epistle to the Romans are: The Church has received a tradition from the
Apostles to give Baptism also to Infants: For they to whom the secrets of
divine mysteries were committed, did know that there was in all, the very filth
of sin, which ought to be washed away by water and the spirit, etc. In which
words we have no mention of an unwritten Tradition; But of a tradition from the
Apostles: that is the Doctrine of the Apostles in the Scriptures: Tradition
being taken in the Scriptures, and Fathers [not So our orthodox schools
distinguish.
passively for an unwritten doctrine of tradition, but actively for the act of
tradition, or delivering the holy Scriptures from hand to hand in succession of
ages, to our fathers and so down to us] in these instances: 2 Thessalonians. 2.15.
Therefore brethren stand fast, and hold the TRADITIONS which we have been
taught whether by word or our Epistle. So in Epiphanius Contra Haeres. l. 3. T.
2. Contra Haer^s ^0. cumpendiarver. doct.
. But (says he) other mysteries as concerning the laver (of baptism) and
internal mysteries are so performed as the TRADITION of the Gospel, and the
Acts has them. So Augustine, as we shall see after in the Quotations of him.
And that Origin takes Tradition in this sense, appears by the ground he lays
upon the Scriptures, which tell us a sinner must be born again of water and the
holy spirit. That sin is taken away by the blood and spirit of Christ, and
that this is sealed to us by Baptism in respect whereof we are said to be
baptized into Christ. Romans 6. Now that cannot be called an unwritten tradition
that has footing upon the Scripture, as baptism has; and baptism of
believers infants, as we have proved and are still upon the proof.

2 ORIGENS words on Levit. Hom. 8. are (speaking of the spiritual uncleanness
of man by sin) It may be asked what cause is there of giving Baptism also to
little children according to the observation of the Church, seeing if there
were nothing in little children the which remission did concern, and indulgence
(of pardon) did belong unto, the grace of Baptism would seem superfluous? Here
again Origin lays the ground work of the washing by Baptism upon the
spiritual pollution of children held forth to us in the Scriptures. Thus
Origin.

3 ORIGENS words in his 14. Hom. on Luke are; Little children were baptized
into remission of sins. Of what sins? Or when did they sin? Or how can any
Consideration of the Laver of washing be in little children, but as we said a
little before? no man is pure from uncleanness, though he lives but one day on
earth. And because by the Sacrament of Baptism the filth of birth is put away,
therefore little children are baptized. All this he speaks of Baptism as
putting it in the room of Mosaicall purifications; And first says, for
spiritual cleansing; Parvuli baptizabantur, that is Little children WERE
baptized, as relating to the practice of the Churches in former ages. And then
secondly says in the present tense Baptizantur parvuli, that is little
children ARE baptized, as noting the continuance of that practice, and that
upon Scripture grounds, viz. for remission and sanctification from sin
(Sacramentally and Instrumentally) instead of Ceremonial washings and
purifications, which had their Gospel meaning, as the Apostle expounds in the
Epistle to the Hebrews. Thus Origin.

But Mr T. has some objections against Origin in his EXAMEN of Mr M. Sermon
which we must answer to keep things clear as we go, Animadvers upon Mr T. his
EXAMEN. 7.
so much as concerns the Common cause.

Object. Perkins and Usher, EXAMEN.
says Mr T* put Origin in the year 230.

We answer indeed Origin then abouts succeeded at Alexandria his Master Clem.
Animadver.
Alexandrinus in the Chair of catechizing and composed his (...) Bucholc:
. But for his birth and first opening his school, we set the reckoning right
according to diverse learned Chronologers and Ecclesiastical Writers; to which
we now add the words of Bucholcerus, in Anno 186. About this year (says he)
was born Origin the Ecclesiastical Writer, at Alexandria; which depends on the
year after Christ 203. in which, Hieronymus writes Origin was about 17 years
old.

Object. The Works of Origin, EXAMEN.
says Mr T. as of old were counted full of errors, and dangerous to be read,
so, as now they are, we can hardly tell in some of them what is Origens, what
not. For the Original being lost, we have only the Latin Translation, which
being performed in many of his Works and particularly the Homilies on
Leviticus, and the Epistle to the Romans, by Ruffinus, it appears by his own
confession, that he added many things of his own, in so much that Erasmus in
his censure of the Homilies on Leviticus, says, That a man cannot be certain
whether he read Ruffinus or Origin: And Perkins puts among Origens counterfeit
works his Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans, as being not faithfully
translated by Ruffinus.

1 As we confess there are some Errors in Origin (and in whom not?) so there
are many learned, Animadver.
pious and most spiritual things, precious Gospel truths, such as I have
admired, when I read, them considering those dark times; in so much as many
now called Preachers of the Gospel, may go to Origin (if they have but the
spirit of discerning) to learn to be Gospel-preachers.

2 If Mr T. makes these exceptions against Origin, why, I say, why does Mr T.
urge Origin for himself in his fifth Argument, in his Exercitation, as we
heard before? Truly a man can hardly with patience enough, look upon Mr T. his
dealing in this: When we urge three places out of Origin (which you had before
quoted and translated, and formerly urged by Mr M.) for the ancient practice of
the Church in baptizing Infants, then M. T. bespatters Origin as you hear, and
Origin is not Origin with him. But if Mr T. urge but one only place of Origin,
to blast Infant Baptism with the scar of tradition, and to contradict all
approved Antiquity before: then Origin must be received. Or else to what purpose
did M. T. allege him, urging no other, by which to pretend Infant Baptism to
be a tradition?

3 Mr T. has nothing to say against Origin on Luke, and therefore he intimates
an acknowledgement of one place urged by us from Origin, to stand good.

4 We gave you all the places out of Origin as translated into Latin by
Hieronimus, as the best Editions promise us.

5 Perkins his noting Origens Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans as not
faithfully translated by Ruffinus, does not conclude it to be a counterfeit
work.

6. If Ruffinus did say, he added many things of his own in the translation of
Origin on the Romans and Leviticus (for there is nothing said of Luke) sure he
would not confess he had destroyed the sense of Origin, or made him speak
that he never meant. This were to suppose Ruffinus would disgrace himself
under his own hand.

But Mr T. objects that if we read the passages themselves we cite, EXAMEN
and consider how they are brought in, and how plain the expressions are
against the Pelagians, we would quickly conceive, that those passages were put
in after the Pelagian heresy was confuted by Hieronimus and Augustine, who
often tells us, that the fathers before that controversy arose, did not speak
plainly against the Pelagians. And of all others Origin is most taxed as
Pelagianizing.

We answer: Animadver.
First for our parts, we have read the places we quote out of Origin, with the
coherence of the preceding and succeeding words, as Mr T. may perceive by our
touches of observations on the places: Some hints there are (we confess)
against some piece of Pelagianisme, which might be conceived by some few in his
time; which others in after ages might confute plainly, when borne, named, and
grown up to a sturdy fellow. Secondly, for Origin to hint in some places
against Pelagianism, and in others to Pelagianize a little, is not such a
contradiction as is not found in diverse fathers that wrote much, and struggled
with contrary Errors, as Augustine etc. we think Mr T. himself clasheth
sometimes against himself. Thirdly, however Origin in all the places constat
sibi, is the same man for Baptism of Infants.

But Mr T. objects further that Vossius says; EXAMEN
For Origin we will the less contend, because what we cited out of him, is
not extant in Greek.

We answer, Animadver.
1 Then we were best cast away almost all worthy Irenaeus, because we have but
a little piece of him in Greek. 2 That Mr T. quoted out of Origin for his turn
is not extant in greek. 3 Vossius shall heal the wound Mr T. gives by the hand
of Vossius.
First says Vossius [Although some think Origens Commentaries on Levit. to be
Cyrills, yet they savor of Origens phrase, and mistakes.] Secondly, says
Voss. [You may read (gemina) this, and his 14. Homilies on Luke as Twinnes]
that is, they both speak alike to the same purpose of Infant Baptism: which
place on Luke Mr T. excepts not against.

Lastly, EXAMEN
Mr T, objects that if Origens testimony be accepted, yet he calls
Infant Baptism a Tradition, and an Observation of the Church.

To this we have sufficiently answered a little before in our quotations of
those three places out of Origin; Animadver.
that ORIGIN cannot mean unwritten Tradition or mere Custom. See more after at
our quotation of Augustine, in which you have a full answer to Mr T. his note
out of Aug. l. 10. c. 23. De Genesi.

The next witness is CYPRIAN, CYPRIAN.
who flourished about the 248. year after Christ Helvic.
, and so also was in the second century, 100 years or age after the first from
the Apostles (according to Mr T. his language) others Bucholc.
put him higher, to wit, about 222. after Christ. His testimony (as Vossius
notes) for Infant Baptism in his time, and higher, is beyond all exception.
His words in his Epistle to Fidus in his third book and eighth Epistle Alias,
Ep. 59.
are these. As concerning the cause of Infants, which thou saidest ought not to
be baptized being within the second or third day of their birth, and that the
law of ancient Circumcision ought to be regarded, so that thou should not
think that one born should be baptized and sanctified within the eighth day; it
seemed far otherwise to all in our council. We all of us ( that is, in a
Council of 66 Bishops) have judged that the mercy and grace of God is to be
denied to no son of man, or to none born of men. And by and by after he says;
There is among all, whether Infants or those that are elder, one equality of
the divine gift. And a little after that he adds. For as God is no excepter of
persons, so nor of Ages, seeing that he holds forth himself with an equal
poysed evennesse [ Parem as some read] a like, [ patrem as others read) a
father to all, for the attaining celestial grace. And a few lines after he
has these words: If remission of sins be given to them that have more
greivously sinned against God, when afterward they have believed, and so none
of them is kept back from Baptism, and grace; how much rather ought not an
Infant to be prohibited and kept from baptism, who being lately born has not
sinned at all, but as born of Adam according to the flesh, he contracted the
contagion of ancient death in his first nativity? And therefore, my dear
brother, this was our judgment in the Council, That from baptism and the
grace of God who is merciful, and bountiful, and pitiful to all, no man
ought to be debarred. So with much more, Cyprian (repeated by him again, tom.
2. l. de lapsis) This Epist. of Cypr. to Fidus is a Famous place (says
Goulartius) concerning the Baptism of Infants, against the Anabaptists. And so
we find it accounted among the pious and Learned Ancients, by their frequent
and respective quotation of it. Cyril or Johannes Hierosolymit. Catechis
Mystag. 1. Greg. Naz. Orat. 3. in sanctum lavacrum. Chrysostom. Hom. ad Ne^phyt.
Hom. in Genesis and in Ps. Ambros. in Luc. Hierom. sub ^inem l. 3. Dialog. contra
Pelagian. August Epist. 28 ad Hi^^^n. and lib. 3. de pec. merit. and remissic.
7, 8, 9. Ubi totam fere hane Epistol. citat. lib. 2. contra Julian, cap. 3. and
lib. 4 contra duas Epist. Pelag. c. 8.
And (says Vossius) the judgment here given in, about Infant Baptism, is so
much the more to be esteemed, in that it was the Decree of so famous a
Council, and that the adversaries durst not deny it, but only doubted,
whether Baptism should be given the eighth day?

And now give us leave to add our observation; namely, That the learned
Ancients did look to the Covenant made with Abraham (whose seal was
circumcision) as to a ground of Infant Baptime; as appears by Fidus his
Argument from Circumcision (only he looked then too much at the circumstance
of such a time of childhood, as the Anabaptists now do at such a time of ripe
years.) So that it appears by this, and the Argument of Cyprian, and of that
Council (according to their light) that, that age held not Infant Baptism from
unwritten tradition, as Mr T. asserts.

Now we must turn to Mr T. his EXAMEN, EXAMEM Sect. 7.
where he has somewhat to say against most of the Fathers usually alleged
for Infant Baptism, and so against Cyprian. 1. He Objects that though Cyprian
^e placed at 250 by Usher, or at 240 by Perkins, (and consequently though at
248 by us) yet Tertullian was before him, and counted his master. Now in
Tertullians time, It appears (says Grotius in Mat. 19.14.) there was nothing
defined concerning the age in which they were to be baptized, that were
consecrated by their Parents to Christian Discipline, because he disswader by
so many reasons (in his book of baptism chap. 18.) the baptizing of Infants.
And i^ he did allow it (as Mr T. adds) it was only in case of necessity, as
may appear by his words in his book De Anima. Chap. 39.

We Reply to this. 1. That both these places of Tertullian are before
alleged, translated, and disc^ssed, Animadver.
to be for Infant Baptism, chap. 13. of our Animadvers. at the word TERTUL. in
the Margin, which we desire the Reader to peruse over again: where you may see,
that Tertullian has nothing of allowance of Infant Baptism only in case of
Necessity; but (if the places be well weighed) he says, that which he says,
for Infant Baptism, without any such limitation: which Infant Baptism among
other passages is asserted by Tertullian, in those words, That the children of
either Parent-sex sanctified, are holy, partly by the prerogative of the SEED,
partly by the RVLE OF DISCIPLINE: Which, what can it be but Baptism? And in
those words, Those children are Designati sanctitatis, the designedones of
holiness, or, the marked ones of holiness. It is more like that Mr T. meant,
that Tertullian restrained Infant Baptism to necessity. lib. de Bapt. cap. 18.
But we have abundantly cleared this also before, in the 13. Chap. of our
Animadvers. at the word TERTUL in the Margin: and that not out of our own
thoughts only, but out of learned Ju^ius and Vossius. Let the Reader have
patience to peruse that we have there said. We add now, That the most of
Tertullians dispute against hastening baptism (chap. 18. of his book concerning
Baptism) is against sudden baptizing men of ripe years; For his words are,
Give not Baptism rashly, Give not holy things to dogs, (he counts not Infants
of believers such as you heard out of his book De anima, and here by and by
calls them, The INNOCENT age) If the Eunuch were suddenly Baptized, yet the
Spirit commanded Philip to go to his Chariot, If Paul were suddenly baptized,
yes he was soon known to Jude his Host, that he was a chosen ^essell: So Tertul
etc. It is true that after Tertullian speaks of Infants, but what says he?
Quid festina^ innocen^a^ a^ ad remissionem peccatorum? [Why does innocent age
hasten to forgiveness of sinnes] (meaning Baptism.) Is this a good reason, a
Scripture ground to defer the Baptism of Infants? He says himself in his
said book and 8 chap. De anima, That children are not holy, till they be
counted so in Christ. And how in Christ? When they be by means of one of the
holy Parents, under the promise, of being a holy seed, and by the rule of
Discipline, which for children, while such, was only Baptism. And whereas Mr
T. brings in learned Grotius as countenancing him, in relying upon Tertullian
against Infant Baptism, we have largely and plainly laid open, after, in our
Animadversions in this Chap. upon the sixth Section of Mr T. his EXAMEN (see
the margin there:) 1. That Grotius rejects Tertullians opinion, as nothing
swaying him, against Infant Baptism. 2. That Grotius by many Arguments is for
Infant Baptism. 3. We now add, that it is true Grotius does say, Tertullianus
de aetate qua baptizandi essent qui Christianae disciplinae a parentibus
cons^crabantur nihil definitum fuisse suis temporibus, hoc ipso docet, etc.
That Tertullian shows that in his time, The set time of Baptizing them that
were CONSECRATED BY THEIR PARENTS to Christian Discipline, was not determined.
But what is this to prove that in those times believers children must not be
baptized, till they are out of their Parents guardianship, and of ripe years?

2. Mr T. Objects against Cyprian, EXAMEN. Sect. 7.
that indeed he handles Infant Baptism at large in his 59 Epistle ad Fidum,
and says in that Epistle enough for it, and more then enough, unless he had
spoken to better purpose. The truth is, the very reading of the Epistle, upon
which Hierom and especially Augustine rely, for the proving of Infant Baptism,
is sufficient to discover how great darkness there was then upon the Spirits
of those that were counted the greatest Lights in the Church. You say, * upon
this occasion Fidus denied not the baptism of Infants, Mr T. speaks to Mr M.
but denied that they ought to be Baptized before the eighth day. But you might
have observed that Fidus alleged, That the Law of ancient circumcision was to
be considered. And That the footstep of an Infant being in the first days of
birth, is not clean. Whence it plainly appears, that there was a relic of
Judaisme in him, and that he did not well understand the abrogation of the
Ceremonial Law. And the truth is, the contentions about Easter, near that age,
do plainly show that Judaisme was not quite weeded out of the minds of the
chief teachers among Christians: Thus Mr T.

We answer. 1 That however Mr T. despises here Cyprians testimony: Animadver.
yet the renownedst, pious, learned, esteemed it; as Cyrill, or John of
Jerusalem, Gregory Nazianzen, Chrysostom, Ambrose, Hierom, Augustine. The
places where, in their works, we quoted a little before in the margin, over
against the end of the testimony of Cyprian. Nor do ancienter writers only
esteem it (on whose spirits Mr T. says there was such darkness, and on
whose spirit is there not some at this time of great light?) but also later
learned pious writers; even Mr T. his beloved Vossius and Grotius so often quoted
by him. Vossius says, Vossius These. Theolog. and Hist. de paedo bapt. These. 9.
Grotius in Mat. 19.14.
that this testimony of Cyprian is above or beyond all exceptions. Grotius
says, That the Epistle of Cyprian to Fidus makes the matter plain that there
was then no doubt of baptizing Infants etc. 2 When Mr T. urges the fathers in
the least, as one place out of one Origin, or etc. in a point of great doubt,
we must entertain it (by Mr T. his intendment,) but when we urge many places
out of many; then says he they are this and that. 3 Better men then these
fathers may have some darkness: John Baptist was greater then the prophets;
and he that is least in the Kingdom of the Church now, is greater than he. 4
Many men may in these days hold a solid truth, yet not upon the best grounds
of it, for want of knowledge of them. 5 That Fidus thus far expressly held the
ceremonial law to be abrogated, that Baptism was come in the room of
Circumcision, and might be administered at least as soon as Circumcision was to
children. Act. 21.20. Gal. 2.
6 We know that many Christian Jews in the time of the Apostles, and Peter
himself did too much Judaize; shall not we therefore receive that true light
that was in them? 7 For that of Ester, we know the controversy too far and
too long about that time invaded Christian England, shall not we therefore be
regarded in any truth? Mr Fox book of Martyrs.
Yea did not the observation of Ester reach down to Mr T. yet he would be
believed in his Exercitation. 8 What is all this that Mr T. has said, to the
point in hand? For we allege not Fidus his Epistle to Cyprian, but Cyprians
to Fidus, relating their judgment and reasons for Infant Baptism of which
before largely and fully. And now observe, that Cyprian says, in the name of
the rest, in that his Epistle to Fidus, that concerning that opinion That the
footstep of an Infant in the first days of his birth is unclean, and so not to
be then baptized. It seemed far otherwise to all of us in the Council; and
then reasons against it. 9 Hierom and Augustine did not so rely on Cyprian, but
that they had many reasons of their own out of scripture, to prove
Infant Baptism, of which after.


3. Mr T. objects against Cyprians Epistle to Fidus, EXAMEN. Sect. 7.
you (says Mr T. to Mr M.) say Cyprian assures Fidus that by the unanimous
consent of 66. BPP. in a Council, baptism was to be administered to Infants
etc. and not to be restrained to any time; (which is true says Mr T.) but you
add (says he to Mr M.) and proves it by such arguments as these; They are
under original sin; they need pardon, are capable of grace and mercy, God
regards not age. But (says Mr T.) the resolution of Cyprian with his
colleagues is not so lightly to be passed over, seeing the determination of
this Council, as far as I can find by search, is the very spring head of
Infant Baptism. To conceive it aright, it is to be considered that you are
mistaken about the proof of their opinion; the things you mention are not the
proof, but are produced in answer to objections. The proof is but one,
unless you will make a proof of that which is in the close of the Epistle,
which is; That whereas none is to be kept from Baptism and the grace of God,
much less newborn Infants who in this respect do deserve ^he words ^^erentur
de, ^ight have ^in translated ^ore favoura^ly by Mr T. ^or 1. Mercor ^^gnifies

Infants owe more to Gods mercy. 5. It is said Gods MERCY.

more of our aid, and of Gods mercy, because in the beginning of their birth
they presently crying and weeping do nothing but pray. The only proof is this,
the mercy and grace of God is to be denied to none that are borne of man, for
the Lord says in the Gospel, that the son of man came not to destroy men's
souls, but to save them, and therefore as much as in us lies, if it may be, no
soul is to be lost, and therefore all Infants at all times to be baptized.

Animad. We answ. That in much of all this, Mr T. rather seems to pursue a man
then the matter. I shall rather pursue the matter then Mr T. for so doing.
Therefore I animadvert; First, the Matter is not of consequence whether there
be one or two or three proofs. Doubtless the ingenuous reader may see in that
Epistle, that Infant Baptism is argued for, out of Scripture first and last,
and in the middle, and according to the light of the times. And let us bless
God for that of their records we have, to show us the practice of ancient
Churches, in many material points. Had we lived in their times, it is a
question whether we should have seen as much as they did. If we now see more
its because we dwarfes are set upon the shoulders of those Giants. Secondly,
that Cyprians Epistle is not the springhead of Infant Baptism. First, Because
that Council, of which Cyprian speaks in that Epistle, did not first coin
that opinion as merely their opinion, depending upon their Votes, but as
arguing it (according to their Light) out of the Scriptures. 1. That it is a
part of Gods favor that sent his Son to save; and that is by Ordinances. 2.
The equality of Gods divine gift to all Infants, and men, as in Elisha his
fetching the child to life. 3 God is no exceptor of persons, and so not of
ages. 4 That by that law which is now established spiritual circumcision is
not to be hindered by the carnal circumcision, (that is as he had said before in
that Epistle, by restraining baptism to the eighth day, and not under) but to
admit all (that is of all ages) and to count none unclean as Peter speaks, Act.
10. with other Reasons there urged.
Secondly, because that Fidus before the advice of this Council (as it seems
come) was for baptism of Infants no doubt, from the ground of circumcision,
only he stuck too much on the ceremony of the eighth day. Thirdly, before
Cyprian or that Council, were Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, Clem. Alexandrinus,
Tertullian, and Origin; all for Infant Baptism, in many passages; all which we
have before translated, alleged, and discussed, excepting Clem. Alexandrinus;
See in the margin after CLEM. ALEXAND.
whom we allege by and by after this. Therefore Mr. T. how ever it seem to
you, it cannot seem to us that the resolution of Cyprian with his Colleagues was
the springhead of Infant Baptism. To the last clause [therefore all Infants
at all times to be baptized] we shall speak to in our Answer to the next
objection.

Secondly, EXAMEN. Sect. 7.
Mr. T. objects against Cyprian out of that we have translated, that his
testimony conteins some gross things, as, first, that they thought baptizing,
giving Gods grace; and the denying it, the denying of grace. Secondly, they
thought that the souls were lost, that were not baptized. Thirdly, that
therefore not only Infants of believers, but all Infants were to be baptized.
Whence Tossanus in his Synopsis notes this for Cyprians error, that he taught,
that Infants were straight ways to be baptized, lest they perish, because that
the mercy of God is not to be denied them.

We answer. 1. In general. If we should grant all this to be true, Animadvers.
yet this does not overthrow, but that in Cyprians time the Churches held
Infant Baptism, and that is the main point in hand.

Secondly, in particular we answer. To the first particular we say, that what
error or hurt is it to say, that baptism gives grace instrumentally; and that
without warrant wittingly to deny baptism, is to deny Gods grace. Even as it
is said in the Scripture, The word of life, The washing of regeneration, The
bread we break is the communion of the body of Christ. So on the contrary,
Where there is no vision the people perish. Unless we are born again of water
and the Spirit, we cannot enter into the kingdom of God. All which are meant
instrumentally, and according to Gods o^^inary dispensation (allowing him his
prerogative roy all to save without means.) And therefore Cyprian and his
Colleagues cannot be justly blamed for speaking no more then that the Scripture
speaks, and in the like phrase.

To the second particular the same answer will serve; where also we have
somewhat out of Cyprian to justify that to be his meaning, viz. instrumentally
not absolutely. For he says [seeing Christ came not to destroy men's souls, but
to save them] therefore quantum in nobis est si fieri potest nulla anima
perdends est, and idcirco ^ baptismo, and gratia Dei, qui omnibus misericors,
and benignus, and pius est, neminem per nos debere prohiberi. That is, [As much
as in us lies if it may be] no soul is to be lost; and therefore from baptism,
and the grace of God who is merciful, bountiful, and pitiful to all, no man
is to be prohibited [by us.] So that as the Scripture says, 1 Pet. 3.21, 22.
that eight souls were saved in the Ark; by water; that is, instrumentally, the
like figure or antitype whereunto baptism now saves, meaning too
instrumentally, for otherwise there is no name under heaven whereby we must be
saved, but Jesus Christ; Act. 4.12. Just so Cyprian speaks.

To the third particular, [that not only Infants of believers, but all Infants
were to be baptized.] I find no such passage in all Cyprians Epistle, that All
Infants are put as the opposite member of the distinction, to believers
Infants. This only I find, first, that all Infants are put into opposition to
Infants above eight days old: that is, that not only Infants above eight
days old, but those under eight days old may as well be baptized. As we heard
before in the quotation of Cyprian in answer to Fidus, whilst Fidus thought
that before the eight day Infants might not be baptized. Secondly, that all
Infants are put in opposition to believers of ripe years (and therefore most
likely all believers Infants are meant) For says Cyprian [if greater sins
cannot hinder men of ripe years from baptism, after they believe, much less
may original sin only, hinder an Infant from baptism.] So Cyprian, which Mr.
T. after quotes in this his 7. Sect. of his Examen. God himself he would have
all men to be saved, yet commands not all ordinances, no nor baptism to be
given to all men. So Cyprian may speak generally in the premises, yet intend
only a particular conclusion, that only some Infants are to be baptized,
suitable to the case he had in hand.

Lastly, we answer to that of Tossanus, first, that there is no such sentence
in all that Mr. T. has translated, out of this Epistle of Cyprian. And
therefore Mr. T. needed not to annex Tossanus his words to that he had
translated with a WHENCE, saying, whence Tossanus notes this for Cyprians
error, that Infants must be presently baptized lest they perish, etc.
Secondly, that there is no such sentence in all Cyprians Epistle, as Tossanus
reports; nor to that effect; But only this, as we translated before upon
another occasion: That Cyprian speaking of baptizing Infants though they were
not eight days old, because the mercy and grace of God is not to be denied to
any born of men, argues thus. Seeing the Lord says in his Gospel, the Son of
man came not to destroy the souls of men, but to save them, as much as in us
is, if it may be, no soul is to be destroyed. See here candid Reader, Cyprian
does not say Infants perish if they be not baptized. But we should not by
wilful neglect of baptism, as much as in us is cause them to perish.

The rest that is in Mr. T. his Analysis of Cyprians Epistle, is only against
Mr. M. about querks, and nothing to the point in hand; and therefore needs no
answer from us.

Yet thus much we say; that whereas Mr. Tombs would not have it, that Cyprian
does at all put in original sin among his Arguments for the baptizing of
Infants; This is clearly intimated by Cyprian, That as men of ripe years
believing, are baptized to put away their many greater actual sins; so Infants
are baptized to put away their lesser, original sins.

And for Mr. T. his calling this Epistle of Cyprian, an absurd Epistle; it is
somewhat boldly spoken, and with too much disrespect of so famous a man and
Martyr in those times; we might have more justly have said so of diverse of the
Authors Mr. T. has quoted; but have forborne it, knowing that such words are
not confutations, but revilings. I am confident that the intelligent Reader
has seen that the allegation of Cyprian has not been absurd to the main point
now in question; to wit, whether Infant Baptism was in use and practice in the
Churches in Cyprians time; which so to have been, Cyprian has fully held out
unto us; and so Mr. T. his absurd is nothing to the purpose. GREG. NAZIAN.


The next witness for the same is Greg. Nazianzen, who lived about the year
after Christ, 375. Helvic.
His words are Orat. 40. quae est in sanctum baptisma.
Baptism is a seal for them that enter into the course of this life. (...),
etc. And therefore (says he, speaking of baptism) we must with all care and
diligence provide that we want not this common grace or favor. Some man may
say, let these things be so as concerning them which require baptism, but what
will you say concerning them which yet are of a tender age, and perceive not
^urt, or grace, shall we baptize them also? Yea by all means, if any danger
presses thereunto. For it is better to be sanctified without sense or feel,
then to depart this life without the seal and innitiation. And of this thing,
circumcision is a reason to us, which was wont to be done upon the eighth day,
which after a sort did represent a figure of baptism, and was offered or given
to them, which yet had not the use of reason. After the same manner also that
anointing or sprinkling given to the doore-posts Exodus 12.7.13.
, which were things void of sense, did bring salvation to the firstborn.
Concerning others, I thus judge, after expectation or waiting three years, or
somewhat less, or a longer space of time (for then they are able to hear some
mystical, or spiritual thing, and give answer, and if they understand not so
fully, and exactly, yet they are instructed, and informed) at length they may
sanctify their souls and bodies by means of the great Sacrament or mystery of
Baptism Gr. (...). But Vossius, Bill. Prun. Mich. in Erem. render it Baptism.
And they that are acquainted with the use of the words, (...), among
Ecclesiastical Writers, Fathers, and the Septuagints, do well know that
commonly by (...) is meant Baptism. And so here without all peradventure it
being the business in hand discussed by Nazian or else h^s conclusion had not
answered to the premises, who before expressly named baptism: and ioyns (...)
together.
Consecration, or sanctification. Thus, Greg. Naz. on whose words learned
Vossius speaks my sense. Non igitur, etc. Therefore (says Vossius) Nazianzen
does not deny the baptism of little children, whom, if there be any danger of
death, he commands also to be baptized; but only judges that otherwise, it
may not unprofitably be deferred to the third or fourth year. Which is only
one Doctors opinion, and not the common judgment of the ancient Church. Thus
Vossius. Take we in also the Note of Vincent. Lirinens. cap. 39. Quicquid unus
vel alter Patrum quam^is ille sanctus, etc. that is, Whatsoever one or other of
the Fathers, albeit he be holy, and learned, etc. shall think, besides or
contrary to all the rest, let that go among his own proper, hidden and private
opiniol's or conceits, as different and severed from the Authority of that
common judgment, etc.

And lastly, give us leave to add our observation. 1 That (according to the
design in hand) Nazianzen holds the baptism of little children that have not
yet the use of reason, not as an unwritten tradition, but according to his
judgment (as well as others) rightly grounded on the Scriptures in the
institution and administration of circumcision; and that of the sprinkling of
the Paschal blood on the doore-posts, Exodus 12. Had baptism of Infants been
held in his time only as a Tradition, he had not argued it from Scripture. 2
That for deferring of baptism of some till three years old, or less, (as he
says) what did this conduce more to that which some of the Anabaptists require
at Baptism, as manifestations of true grace; then to baptize them at eight or
ten days old, upon Gods Covenant with the believing parent.

Here to clear things as we go, we must answer some objections made against
what we allege out of Nazianzen.

First, Mr. D. in his Antichrist unmasked. Objections of H. D. against
Nazianzen cleared.
1. Obj. Nazianzen (says he) restrains baptism of Infants to danger; but
there is no danger if they be not baptized. Ergo, Nazianzens mind is not that
Infants should be baptized.

Answ. This Argument plays with an equivocation of the word danger. H. D.
means there is no spiritual danger, if an Infant dies before it be baptized:
But Nazianzen means danger of bodily death; and therefore gives it as a precept
or command, that in case there be danger that the Infant may dye before it be
sealed with baptism, let it be baptized; according to the figure thereof
circumcision, etc. See before.

Obj. 2. Nazianzen (says H. D.) was not baptized till he was 30. years old; as
it is said, In his life.

Answ. If that in Nazianzens life say this truly, yet this might be by reason
of the persecutions of those times, or indisposition of his parents, or other
pressing necessities; and therefore does infer no more, then that circumcision
ought not after the Israelites came into Canaan to be administered till men were
forty years old, because so long it was deferred in the wilderness. Christ
himself was not baptized till thirty years old, yet the Anabaptists will not
make a rule of this, that only those of just that age must be baptized. Sure
enough if Nazianzen his baptism was deferred past childhood, it was not
intended by him for a regulating example, but often in that Oration fore-quoted
in several places exhorts to hasten Baptism (...), etc. Have an Infant? lest
improbity snatch away the opportunity let him be sanctified from his infancy,
meaning baptism, having spoken in the very next preceding words against delay
of bap^isme. Naz. Orat. ^0. p. 648. See also p. 646 Think all time to be
certain and determined for baptism.
, and not to defer it after the example of Christ not baptized till thirty
years old Ibid. p. 658. Edit. Paris. Graec. and Lat.
. And you heard in the place quoted, that he mentions deferring in any case but
till 3 or 4 years old, or less sometimes; which is all one in effect with
baptizing believers Infants at three months or three weeks; unless the
mathematical consideration of words, spoken without knowledge (as Persius his
Parrat spoke Greek) One of the Anabaptists in a book called, The character of
the Beast, says, If one confess his sins, though there be no sign of grace,
he ought to be baptized.
prevails with some.

Secondly, Mr. Tombs objects in his EXAMEN against Nazianzen. EXAMEN. Sect. 6.

1. He objects, (with an interrogation) but does Greg. Nazianzen (says Mr. T.)
seem only to restrain it to the case of necessity? The words (says he) are
plain, that Nazianzen gives the reason why Infants in danger of death should be
baptized, (...), that they might not miss of the common grace. But (...), He
gives his opinion of others, that they should stay longer, that they might be
instructed, and so their minds and bodies might be sanctified. Thus Mr. T.

Animadvers.
We answer. First, if Greg. Nazianzen does give reason why Infants should be
baptized, in case they are not likely to live to be of riper years, it is so
much the better for us. Secondly, he does give another reason, beside that of
partaking of common grace, namely, 1 (...), For it is better they should be
sanctified, without a feeling of it, then to depart without the seal. So he
thinks they are sanctified too in infancy, as well as at riper years. 2 (...),
A reason also of this to us is circumsion, that was wont to be done on the
eight day, etc. Thirdly, we answer, that all three Reasons stand in force as
well for all believers Infants (God putting them under the promise, Genesis 17.)
as for those Infants that are in danger of death. Fourthly, that Nazianzen
urges diverse divine Reasons (to him evincing) for the baptism of Infants not
in danger of death: but for the delaying of others not in danger of death, he
says, (...), I give my opinion. He calls it his opinion. And what is it? that
(...), such children should stay till three or four years old, more, or less?
And what is to be expected from children of that age? more then from Infants,
toward baptism? For Nazianzen himself confesses, that though they may then
hear and answer some spiritual things, yet they understand imperfectly. But
does Nazianzen give us there any Scripture for this differing? None. Does he
give any Reason? Even in effect the same as for baptizing of Infants in danger
of death, to wit, that they may be sanctified in mind and body.

Secondly, EXAMEN. Sect. 6.
Mr. T. objects (upon our alleging Nazianzen) against all the Greek Fathers,
in effect that we have alleged, and the custom of the Greek Churches touching
Infant Baptism, first thus; It is wonder to me, (says Mr. T.) that if it were
so manifest as you speak, you should find nothing in Eusebius for
Infant Baptism, nor in Ignatius, nor in Clemen. Alexandrinus, nor in
Athanasius, nor in Epiphanius.

Animadvers.
We answer. 1. Mr. T. brings but one place out of one Origin, to prove (as he
pretends) that Infant Baptism is but a tradition. We bring four for the
contrary, Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, Origin, and Nazianzen, and yet these are not
sufficient with him, unless we hear Ignatius, Clemens Alexandrinus, etc. say
so too? 2 A non dicto and non factum, not valet consequentia. Many things have
been done in the Church, which those Authors may not mention. 3 They may speak
of Infant Baptism in some of their works which long since were lost. 4 Mr. T.
says, that YOU should find nothing in Eusebius, Ignatius, etc. for
Infant Baptism. And we say, it is wonder Mr. T. did find nothing in them to
the contrary, in his 7 or 8 months time to write his EXAMEN, which we not
having much above 8 weeks for our Answer, and so have not time to ransack every
book. But fifthly, CLEM. ALEXAN. li. 3. Str^m. p. 461. He flourished about the
year of Christ, 193. Buchol. Helvic.
this we cast our eye upon in Clem. Alexand: (which makes me think somewhat
might be found in him toward Infant Baptism if we had time) (...), etc.
Neither does Gods divine providence now likewise command, (...) of old, that he
that has risen from the conjugall bed should be washed. For the Lord does not
necessarily take off from procreation of children those that are believers,
whom he has by one Baptism washed in all respects according to his wont; who
by one baptism comprehends all the Baptismes of Moses. Therefore the Law of
God by carnal generation foretelling our regeneration, did for the seminall
faculty of generation hold forth baptism, Vide Graecum textum.
not loathing humane generation. Thus Clem. Alex. with much more, which for
haste we cannot stand to translate.


Give us leave to add a note or two. 1. Let me observe with Hervet.
Aurelianus, that this place relates to Levit. 15, 16, 17, 18. If any man's seed
of copulation shall go out from him, then he shall wash all his flesh in water,
and be unclean until the evening. And every garment, and every skin whereon is
the seed of copulation shall be washed with water, and be unclean until the
Even. The woman also with whom the man shall lie with seed of copulation, they
shall both bathe themselves in water, and be unclean until the even. This is
the LAW, and these are the BAPTISMES of MOSES, of which Clem. Alexandrinus
speaks here.

HESYCHIVS
2. Take the note of ancient and learned Hesychius He flourished about 402d.
year after Christ. Helvic.
on this place, which is this. The Lord himself (says he) shows that
mankind must have the necessary regeneration of baptism, saying, Unless a
man be born again, of water, and the holy Spirit, he shall not enter into the
kingdom of heaven (Joh. 3.) The untowardnasse of which filth in us, was
transfused from Adam. Whence David says he was born in iniquity, and conceived
in sin. (Psalm. 51.) not accusing his mother, but intimating his sinfulness,
which ran down from his progenitors. And now the Lawmaker commanded him, out of
whom proceeds the seed of copulation, that is, ^e that has effused his seed
for procreation of children, yea also the woman that has received it, to wash
the body, because she has received it; by which is described this whole temple
of ours, that is the whole man consisting of soul and body. In that Adam was
made filthy by disobedience, he made his seed to be filthy, and so necessarily
the body to be filthy which is of the seed, in which he is unclean until the
Even, that is the end of the time wherein Christ coming shows the water whereby
our generation should be cleansed; And that till then we remained unclean, is
proved from thence, that they also that had not yet sinned (actually), that is,
were in their tender age, have necessarily the seal of baptism, lest by death
preventing, they dye unclean, etc. Thus Hesychius with much more.

Thirdly, If it pleases Mr. T. he may read Gentinus Hervet^^ Aurelianus his
note on the place of Clem. Alexandrinus (who is careful to set forth the sense
of Clemens, though we heed not all his own excursions.) Therefore Clem.
Alexandrinus (says, Gent. Hervet. Anrel.) intimates that many were the
Baptismes of Moses anciently, which were figures of our regeneration by
Baptism, by which original sin is washed; which one only Baptism indeed is
necessary, for by it, it is that the seed is no more unclean, though after to
be further cleansed. So Gent. Herv. with much more.

Thus you have a touch out of one of Mr. T. his five Gr. Authors, which he
says have nothing of Infant Baptism. We will give you another touch out of
another of his silent Authors (as Mr. T. intimates) and so dismiss the rest,
as not having all the Authors, nor time to go look after them. EPIPHANIVS.
contra Haeres. 30. p. 52.
Epiphanius in his second Book 2. Tom. contr. Haeres. speaking before of the
Circumcision of Christ, that he was circumcised, to dissolve or abrogate that
Circumcision to bring in a greater. And that the Circumcision enjoined Abraham
was not perfect, but a sign of grace given, and for the instruction of them in
future times, and thence wishes Ebion not to imitate Christ in Circumcision of
himself or others, at last he speaks in these very words, For the Lord (says
Epiphanius) has removed the time of this (Circumcision.) For he came, and
fulfilled it having given the perfect Circumcision of his mysteries, and that
not in one member only, but in the whole body sealed and circumcised from
sins; and saving not one only part of the people, that is men only, but also
all the people of Christians indeed, signing or sealing men and women, and
liberally for the inheritance of the Kingdom of Heaven; and not in exhibiting
the seal defectively to one rank or state (virorum) of men, in the time of
their imbecility, but to all the people etc.

Thus far Epiphanius writes there of Infant Baptism, and I am confident more
might be found in other places touching it (had we time to seek,) though
Epiphanius says nothing of it (as Mr. T. weakly objects) in lib. 2. Haeres.
46. vel 47. in his disputation for Infants inheriting Heaven, against the
Hieracites. We are not to teach other learned men what to speak; nor when to
speak, nor to say they speak not at all of such a point, if they do not speak
where and when we expect.

2. Mr. T. objects against the Greek Fathers alleged by us, EXAMEN. Sect. 6.
and in them against the custom of the Greek Churches touching
Infant Baptism; thus. But besides, the continuance of the questions to
baptized persons, and answered by them, in many Authors mentioned, this is to
me and it seemed to Hugo Grotius Annot. in Matthew. 19.14. no small evidence,
that Baptism of Infants many hundred years was not ordinary in the Greek
Church. Grotius adds that the Canon of the Synod of Neo-Caesarea in the year
313. determines that a woman with child might be baptized, because the Baptism
reached not to the fruit of her womb, because in the confession made in
Baptism each ones free choice is showed.

We answer. First, that this seems no otherwise to me, but, as the
confessions of sin, Animadvers.
and profession of Faith in the New Testament by them, that at the first
Institution of Baptism were baptized at ripe years; does not imply but that
Baptism descended to their children whiles children; yea so much the rather
because the Parents were baptized, the Promise then being actually instated on
them, Acts 2.
the Promise to you, and to your children; even just so may we say of those
questions put to the baptized, and answered by them, in the Greek Church. For
though, being Gentiles the Parents at first were to make confession, as a token
of their conversion from Hethenisme, before their Baptism; yet this does not
in the least argue that their children must be able to make confession before
they were baptized. No more then the Circumcision of Abraham, and the strangers
are bought with money when they were believers of riper years, did infer
that all Christ's children from age to age should not be circumcised till they
were so too.

2. Touching Grotius, we answer four things.

1. That he in discussing the point (on Matthew. 19.14.) touching
Infant Baptism, alleges diverse things to show that some in the Greek
Church, in several ages did not baptize their Infants; but has no such
passage, as that Infant Baptism was not ordinary; in the Greek Church.

2. In all he alleges touching this, he says not to the contraty, but that
the Non-baptizing of some Infants might be, because their Greek Parents were
not converted from Gentilisme.

3. For that Neocaesarian Synod Of which there are many Editions varying one
from another.
the cause and intent of it, in part at least might be as was intimated before
out of Clem. Alexand. (a Greek, who flourished long before the Neocaesarian
Synod, and therefore likely this Synod would have respect to him, And to
Tertullian, of the same time with CLEM. who has to the same effect as CLEM.
Tertulli. Lib. de Anima. chap. 39. 40. of which before chap. 13. of Animad. vid.
in marg. TERTVL.
) to wit, that though by the Baptismall washing of the Parent (by virtue of the
Promise, I am the God of thee and thy seed, and the Promise is to you and to
your children) the seed of that Parent was accounted holy, yet so, as not to
anticipate and prevent the baptizing of that seed when it was borne.

4. Grotius himself intimatedly confesses, that Interpreters do take the
words of that Synod otherwise then to intend against Infant Baptism.

5. For Grotius his own opinion, it is clear and full for Infant Baptism
upon that 19. of Matthew. ver. 14. who alleges and asserts these particulars.

1. That it was grateful to Christ that little Children should be brought to
him, as the designed ones of holiness, and so of salvation, according to
Tertullians expression. 2. That (according to Irenaeus) Christ passed through
every age, he became an Infant to sanctify Infants, a little child to
sanctify them of that age, etc. 3. That upon this text of Christ receiving
little ones, etc. among other grounds, does (says Grotius,) lean the practice
of baptizing little one, and Infants. 4. That in Augustines time (says he) it
was a common neceived practice to baptize Infants as is clear by this, that
when the Pelagians (holding some how against Infant Baptism) were pressed with
this Argument of the practice of all Churches in baptizing Infants, they durst
not deny it to be true. 5. That by Hieroms and Augustines quotation of Cyprians
Epistle to Fidus it is clear, (says Grotius) that it was not doubted in
Cyprians time whether Infants might be baptized, but only some stuck at this,
whether they might be baptized before they were eight days old. And it was
determined in a Council then, whereof Cyprian was one, that Baptism should not
be denied to Infants newly borne, if they were offered thereunto. 6. Grotius
says; that in an ancient book entitled the Constitutions of Clement, it is
(...), etc. Baptize your Infants also, then train them up in the instruction
and nurture of the Lord. 7. Grotius having quoted somethings out of that Synod,
of Balsamo and Zonanas, Walafridus Strabo, etc. that in many ages, all Infants
had not been baptized; he concludes, but (says he) as those things hold forth
a liberty, antiquity, and difference of custom; so they bring nothing to prove
why Infant Baptism should be rejected, when their Parents etc. offer them to
be consecrated, with the prayers of the Saints, and vows of pious education of
them, which among other things, is not unfitly signified in Baptism. Neither
ought that to be any hindrance to the Baptism of Infants, that all things
which in like manner are signified by Baptism, cannot agree properly to that
age. For Repentance also, which we know is signified in Baptism, and indeed
had a greater place in them that having long lived a most impure life,
testified their purpose of changeing their whole conversation then in others,
had no place at all in Christ when John baptized him; who as Tertullian says
was not baptized as any debtor to repentance. 8. Grotius quotes the Author of
the Qu. ad Orthodox (whom Mr. T. has so be-bastarded before) I say Grotius
quotes him as a worthy Author; citing these words (...), etc. Infants are
counted meet for good things by Baptism, by means of the Faith of them that
brought them. 9. In that Christ says of Infants, Of such is the kingdom of
God, that Christ did in that say thus much (says Grotius), by so much the
less is that age to be despised as profane, by how much men of ripe years
that yield themselves up to my government must become children again. Lastly,
to Mr. T. his objecting that Constantine the great, and Greg. Nazianzen were
not baptized til they were of age. I answer 1. That Mr. T. has ill urged
Constantine a Latin, for an instance that baptism of Infants was not ordinary
in the Greek Church. 2. To Constantines and Greg. Nazianzens baptism we have
answered before.

The next testimony is of Ambrose, AMBROSE.
who flourished about the year 381 Helvic.
. He in his 2. book of Abraham, Chap. 11. says: Neither the old Proselyte, nor
the Infant Native is excepted, because every age is obnoxious to sin, and
therefore every age is meet for the Sacrament. For unless one be born again of
water and the holy Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God, for he
excepts none, nor Infant, nor, etc. So Basil long before. Ann. 372. In his
exhortat. to Baptism.
To Ambrose, Mr. T. answers nothing in his EXAMEN, but only takes notice that
Mr. M. quoted him. But makes no exception against him. All these Ancients that
we have translated, were before the rise of Pelagianisme Pelagius was about An.
104 Helvic. or 413. El. Reusner.
, whose abettors were for the general, great sticklers against the baptism of
Infants. And before them the Arrians opposed the same Arius was about the year
315. Helvic. or 319 El Reusner and Bucholc.
. Of these see somewhat before, in our Animadversions on Mr. T. his 2 Argument
in his 15. Sect.

Next let us touch those Ancients, who after the rise of
Anabaptisticall-Pelagianisme, or Peleganian-Anabaptisme wrote for
Infant Baptism, none of them urging it as only the custom of the Churches;
others of them arguing it from the Scriptures, and therefore took it not up as
an unwritten tradition.

Chrysostom (who flourished about the year after Christ, CHRYSOSTOM.
382. as Helvicus reckons, was Bishop of Constantinople about 389. as El.
Reusner computes) upon those words, 1 Timothy 3. Not a Novice, that is, a new
tender plant, says, the Apostle means not one so in regard of age, for many
such of the Gentiles or Nations came to the Church, and were baptized. There
are other passages in Chrysostom, but I promised but to touch these last
Authors.

Hierom who flourished about the year after Christ, HIERONIMVS.
384. (so Helvicus) about the year 392. wrote his Catalogue of famous writers
(so Bucholcerus) says thus of Infant Baptism in his Epistle to Lata: The good
or evil of a child is much to be imputed to the parents (meaning education)
unless (says he) thou think that the children of Christians in case they
have not received baptism, are only guilty of that sin, and that the sin is
not to be laid upon them that would not give it them, especially at that time,
when they that were to receive it, were not able to oppose. As on the other
side, the salvation of Infants is the gain of the parents or ancestors. So
likewise Hierom in his third book of Dialogues against the Pelagians. Thus.

CRITO. Tell me, I pray thee, and so deliver me from all questioning why
Infants may be baptized? ATTIC. That their sins may be done away in baptism.
CRITO. What sin have they committed? Is any man loosed, that is not first
bound? ATTIC. Do ask me? The Evangelicall Trumpet, etc. shall answer thee.
Romans 5. Death reigned from Adam to Moses even upon them that had not sinned
after the similitude of Adams transgression, etc. He that is a little one is
loosed in baptism from the bond (of sin) of the parent, etc. And lest thou
should think that I mean this in an heretical sense, the blessed Martyr
Cyprian, in his Epistle he wrote to Bishop Fidus concerning baptizing Infants
minds us of these things. And there Hierom transcribes a great part of that
Epistle of which you heard before. And then adds, Eloquent Augustine (says
Hierom) wrote long since to Marcellinus, etc. two books of baptizing Infants
against your (that is, the Pelagian) heresy, by which you will assert that [
NOTE how the Pelagians opposed Infant Baptism
Infants are baptized, not into remission of sins, but into the kingdom of God]
according to that, Joh. 3.5. Except a man be born again of water, and the
Spirit, be cannot enter into the Kingdom of God. He wrote also the third to the
same Marcellinus against those who say as you (Pelagians) do, that it is
possible for a man to be void of sin without the grace of God. He wrote also a
fourth to Hilarious, against thy doctrine (Pelagius.) Also he is said to have
written other books in special to thee by name, which are not come to our
hands, etc. I will only say this, that I may end my speech. That either thou
(Pelagius) must make a new form, that after ye have baptized them into the Name
of Father, Son, and holy Ghost, ye baptize them into the kingdom of God: or if
you have one and the same baptism in little ones, and men, then Infants must
be baptized into remission of sins, etc. Thus Hierom.

To all this of Hierom in this last quotation, Mr. T. answers in his EXAMEN,
that the same answer will serve as to Augustine. Well, therefore let us come to
Augustine.

Augustine flourished about 391, after Christ; AUGUST. Helvic.
and has abundance concerning Infant Baptism, in his 28. Epistle, in his book
of original sin, Chap. 40. In his second book of Marriage and Concupiscence,
Chap. 20. In his third book of sin, merit, and remission, Chap. 7, 8, 9. In his
second book against Jul. ca. 3. In his fourth book of Baptism against the
Donatists, Chap. 24 So has THEODORET. epit. divin. dogmat. ca. de Baptismo. He
flourished about the year 422. And so GENNADIVS de Ecclesiast. dogmat. c. 31.
He flourish about the year 458.
. In his fourth book against the two Epistles of Pelag. Chap. 8.

It were a tedious business to translate all these places, (for me that
intended more brevitie, having too much other business, and too little time
for this work, and for many Readers which delight no more in reading these,
then I in quoting of them, but that Mr. T. leads me to them) therefore (and
because I shall translate somewhat of Augustine by and by) I will only note
particularly of Augustine these two things.

First, that Augustine in that place of his 7, 8, 9. Chapters of his third book
of sin, merit, and remission quotes almost all Cyprians Epistle to Fidus.

Secondly, that Augustine does not build his judgment only upon Cyprian,
because in his fourth book of baptism against the Donatists, he proves
Infant Baptism by many Arguments from the Scriptures.

Now all these especially the last we only touch, that we may not toil our
selves, and the Reader. There are of the Anabaptists that can tell whether
those Authors be not for us, or no. We shall only add some observations upon
them, and so pass on.

1. That these five last Authors, Chrysostom. Hierom, August. Theod. Genn. wrote
for Infant Baptism after the rise of Pelagianisme See also Voss. These. Theol.
and hist.
: Though some of the men were before it, yet those things before quoted were
written after it. 2. That they wrote those things at least 300 years before Mr.
T. his Walafridus was a Writer to tell us that tale against Infant Baptism; of
which you heard before, and we gave our Answer to it. 3. That these did argue
out of Scripture, and no otherwise determine the question, that Infants ought
to be baptized, then as the pious learned Ancients had held in former ages long
before See before in the notes in the margin on Cyprinan.
.
Augustine shall here (for brevities sake) speak for them all; who being one of
the youngest, and learned, and most orthodox and pious, knew well the last
generation in which they lived. His words are very considerable in his tenth
book. De Genes. ad literarum, cap. 23. The custom (says he) of our Mother the
Church in baptizing little children is by no means to be despised, nor
altogether to be reputed superfluous, nor by all means to be believed, but that
it was an Apostolical tradition. Where he means by Apostolical tradition the
Apostles Doctrine delivered brought down to us in the book of the New
Testament, by tradition or handing of it from one generation to another. So to
be his meaning is plain.

1. Because Augustine in his dispute against the DONATISTS for Infant Baptism,
Li. 4. de Bap. cap. 21.
prove it from the Scriptures. 2. Because in his first book, De pecc. mer. and
remiss. cap. 26. says thus. Some of the PELAGIANS do grant under some notion
that little children are to be baptized: who cannot go against the Authority of
the universal Church, which without all doubt was delivered to them by the
Lord Christ and his Apostles. 3. In his tenth Sermon of the words of the
Apostle, speaking of the Baptism of little children, says; let no man whisper
unto you strange Doctrines. This the Church always had, always held. This it
received from the Faith, or Faithfulness of our Ancienters. And this it keeps
with perseverance to the end. 4. These things to be most truly spoken by
Augustine, we do know (says Vossius) by this that the Pelagians (some of
them) durst not deny them. For Augustine writes in his second Book against
Coelestius and Pelagius, that Coelestius himself in a book which he put forth
at Rome confessed in these words Infants are baptized into remission of sins,
according to the rule of the universal Church, and according to the SENTENCE
OF THE GOSPEL.
But observe his cunning, in what sense he meant that Infants were baptized
into remission of sins: to wit, into future remission, if they lived to
commit actual finnes, and thereby stood in need of pardon; not into present
remission of sins whiles Infants, as not standing in need of pardon, or else
they, that is Pelagius Coelestius and their Sect said only in words that
Infants were baptized into remission of sins, but thought otherwise in their
Principles they held.

This is plain out of the Affrican Council, held under Boniface and
Celestinus; in the 77. Canon whereof it is thus. Item placuit qui parvulos
recentes, ab uteris matrum baptizandos negat, etc. that is, It pleases the
Counsel that whosoever denies that little ones newly borne from the mothers
womb are to be baptized, or says that they are baptized into remission of
sins, but they contract or draw nothing of original sin from Adam, which
need to be expiated by the laver of Regeneration; whence it follows that by
them the form of Baptism into remission of sins, is not truly, but falsely
understood, let him be Anathema. Thus the said Counsel. By the plaster made
by this Counsel, you may perceive the disease of Pelagius, etc.

And in the Epistle of the Council of Carthage ( Anno 416. Bin.) to
Innocentius, which is word for word the 90. among Augustines Epistles, there is
this mentioned, that Pelagius, and Coelestius deny the Baptism of Infants,
because (say they) Infants perished not, neither is there in them that that
needs salvation, or to be redeemed with so great a price; for as much as in
them is nothing vitiated, nothing is held captive under the power of the
Devil, neither is it read that blood was powered out for them unto remission of
sins. Albeit Coelestius in his Book has already confessed in the Church of
Carthage that Infants also are redeemed by the Baptism of Christ.

And then to explain this, how many, and how or in what manner, confessed this
with Coelestius, the following words fitly serve.

But many who are represented to us, to be, or to have been their Disciples,
do not cease to affirm these evils, whereby they endeavor by all the craft
they can, to overthrow the Fundamentalls of the Christian Faith. So that if
Pelagius and Coelestius be corrected, or if they say they never thought those
things, and deny those writings to be theirs, what or how many-soever they be
that are brought against them, yet is there not whereby to convince them of a
lie. So the Epistle of the Council at Carthage.

Mr. T. EXAMEN. Sect. 8.
But Mr. T. has many things to say against Augustine in his EXAMEN.

That the Authority of Augustine was it which carried the baptism of Infants
in the following ages almost without control, as may appear out of Walafridus
Strabo, placed by Usher at the year 840. who in his book De rebus
Ecclesiasticis, chap. 26. having said, That in the first times, the grace of
Baptism was wont to be given to them only who were come to that integrity of
mind and body, that they could know, and understand and what profit was to be
gotten in baptism, what is to be confessed, and believed, what lastly is to be
observed by them that are new born in Christ; confirms it by Augustins own
confession of himself continuing a Catechumenus long before Baptized. But
afterward Christians understanding Original sin etc. Ne perirent parvulisi
sine remedio regenerationis gratiae defungerentur, statuerunt cos baptizari in
remissionem peccatorum quod et S. Augustinus in libro de bapismo parvulorum
ostendit, and Africana testantur Concilia, and aliorum Patrum documenta
quamplurima. And then adds how Godfathers and Godmothers were invented, and
adds one superstitious and impious consequent on it in these words; Non autem
debet Pater vel matter de font suam suscipere sobolem vt sit discretio inter
spiritalem generationem and carnalem; Quod si casu evenerit, non habebunt
carnalis copule deinceps adinvicem consortium, qui in communi filio
compaternitatis spiritale vinculum susceperant. To which I add that Petrus
Cluniacensis, placed by Usher, at the year 1150. writing to three Bishops of
France against Peter de Bruis, who denied Baptism of Infants, says of him,
that he did reject the Authority of the Latin Doctors, being himself a
Latin, ignorant of Greek, and after having said recurrit ergo ad scripturas,
therefore he runs to the Scriptures: he alleges the examples in the New
Testament, of Christ's curing of persons at the request of others, to prove
Infants Baptism by, and then adds, Quid vos ad ista? Ecce non de Augustino,
sed de Evangelio protuli, cui cum maxim vos credere dicatis, aut aliorum fide
alios tandem posse salvari concedite, aut de Evangelio esse quae posui si
potestis, negate. From these passages I gather that as Petrus Cluniacensis
urged for paedo-baptisme the authority of Augustine and the Latin Doctors, So
Peter de Bruis and Henricus appealed to the Scriptures, and the Greek Church:
Now the reason of Augustines authority was this, the Pelagian heresy being
generally condemned, and Augustines works being greatly esteemed, as being the
hammer of the Pelagians, the following refuters of Pelagianisme, Prosper,
Fulgentius, etc. the Counsels that did condemn it as those of Carthage,
Arles, Milevis, etc. did rest altogether on Augustines arguments, and often on
his words, and Augustine in time was accounted one of the four Doctors of the
Church, esteemed like the four Evangelists, so that his opinion was the rule of
the Churches Judgment, and the schools determination, as to the great hurt of
Gods Church Luther and others have been of late. Now Augustine did very much
insist on this Argument to prove original sin, because Infan^s were baptized
for remission of sins, and therefore in the Council of Milevis he was
adjudged accursed, that did deny it: But for my part I value Augustines
judgment just at so much, as his proofs and reasons weigh, which how light
they are you may conceive.

August. tom. 1. Confess. lib. 1. c. 11. and Signabar signo crucisejus and
condiebar ejus sale jam inde ab utero matris meae, quae multu^^ speravit in te.
And then follows, how being young and falling sick, he desired, and his mother
thought to have him baptized, but upon his recovery it was deferred.
First, In that whereas he makes it so Universal a tradition, his own
baptism not till above thirty, though educated as a Christian by his mother
Monica, the Baptism of his son Adeodatus at 15. of his friend Alipius, if
there were no more, were enough to prove that this custom of baptizing
infants, was not so received, as that the Church thought necessary that all
children of Christians by profession should be baptized in their infancy. And
though I conceive with Grotius annot. in Matthew. 19.14. that baptism of Infants
was much more frequented, and with greater opinion of necessity in Africa, then
in Asia, or other parts of the world, for (says he) in the Counsels you
cannot find ancienter mention of that custom, then the Council of Carthage.
Yet I do very much question whether they did in Africa, even in Augustines
time baptize children, except in danger of death, or for the health of body, or
such like reason: I do not find that they held that Infants must be baptized
out of such cases, for it is clear out of sundry of Augustines, Tracts, as
particularly tract. 11. in Johan. that the order held of distinguishing the
Catechumeni and baptized, and the use of Catechizing before baptism, still
continued, yea and a great while after, insomuch that when Petrus Cluniacensis
disputed against Peter de Bruis, he said only, that there had been none but
Infants baptized for 300 years, or almost 500 years in Gallia, Spain,
Germany, Italy, and all Europe, and it seems he denied not the baptizing of
grown persons in Asia still; whence I collect, that even in the Latin Church,
after Augustines days, in sundry ages the baptizing of persons of grown age
did continue as well as baptizing of infants, till the great darkness that
over-spred the Western Churches, spoiled by Barbarous Nations, destitute of
learned men, and ruled by ambitious and unlearned Popes, when there were none
to Catechize, and therefore they baptized whole Countries upon the baptism of
the King of that Country, though both Prince and people knew little or nothing
of Christianity, but were in respect of manners and knowledge Pagans still,
which has been the great cause of the upholding of Papacy, and corrupting of
Christian Churches, I mean this great corruption of baptizing, making
Christians, giving Christendom (as it is called) before ever persons were
taught what Christianity was, or if they were taught any thing, it was only
the ceremonies and rites of the Church, as they called them.

2. You may conceive how light Augustine's judgment was, Rivet. tract. de
Patrum auth^ritate, c. 9. Augustinus aeternis flammis adjudic at Infantes sine
badtismo morientes
by considering the ground upon which Augustine held, and urged the baptism of
Infants so vehemently; which was, as all know that read his works, the opinion
he had, That without baptism Infants must be damned, by reason of original
sin, which is not taken away but by baptism, yea, though he wanted baptism
out of necessity; urging those places, Joh. 3.5. Romans 5.12. continually in his
disputes against the Pelagians, particularly tom. 7. de natura and gratia, c.
8. And tom. 2. ep. 28. he says, Item quisquis dixerit, quod in Christo
vivificabuntur etiam parvuli, qui sine Sacramenti ejus participatione de vita
exeunt, hic profecto and contra Apostolicam praedicationem venit, and totam
condemnat ecclesiam. And in the close of the Epistle, calls it, robustissimam
and fundatissimam sidem qua Christi ecclesia, nec parvulos homines recentissime
natos a damnatione credit, nisi per gratiam domini Christi, quam in suis
Sacramentis commendavit, posse liberari. And this, Perkins in his Problem,
proves, was the opinion of Ambrose, and many more: And hence, as Aquinas, so
Bellarmine, proves baptism of Infants, from Joh. 3.5. And this has been still
the principal ground. The ground that you go on, that the covenant of grace
belongs to believers and their seed, I cannot find amongst the Ancients. Yea,
as you may perceive out of Perkins in the place alleged, although Ambrose and
Augustine in his 4. book de Baptismo contra Donatistas, c. 22 yielded, that
either Martyrdom, or the desire of Baptism, might supply the defect of
Baptism, and some of the Schoolmen, Biel, Cajetan, Gerson, do allow the
desire and prayer of parents for children in the womb, in stead of Baptism:
Yet we find no remedy allowed by them, but actual baptism for children borne
into the world: So strictly did Augustine and the Ancients urge the necessity
of Baptism for Infants born.

3. You may consider, that Augustine held a like necessity of Infants receiving
the Lords supper, from the words, John 6.53. as is plainly expressed by him,
lib. 1. de peccat. merit. and remis. c. 20. And accordingly, as in Cyprians
tim, the Communion was given to Infants, as appears by the story which he
relates of himself, giving the Communion to an Infant, in his book de lapsis,
mentioned by August. epist. 23. So it is confessed by Maldonat on Joh. 6. that
Innocentius the first, Bishop of Rome, held it necessary for Infants; and that
this opinion and practice continued about 600 years in the Church, though it be
now rejected by the Roman Church in the Council of Trent.

4. You may consider, that Augustine held such a certainty of obtaining
regeneration by Baptism, that not only he puts usually regeneration for
Baptism, but also he makes no question of the regeneration of Infants, though
they that brought them, did not bring them with that faith that they might be
regenerated by spiritual grace to eternal life; but because by Baptism they
thought to procure health to their bodies, as is plain by his words, epist. 23.
ad Bonifacium. Nec illud te moveat, quod quidam non ea fide ad Baptismum
percipiendum parvulos ferunt, vt gratia spiritali ad vitam regenerentur
aeternam, sed quod eos putant hoc remedio temporalem retinere aut recipere
sanitatem: non enim propterea illi non regenerantur, quia non ab illis hac
intention offeruntur; celebrantur enim per eos necessaria ministeria. By which
last words you may perceive how corrupt Augustine was in this matter, so as to
excuse, if not to justify their fact, who made use of Baptism in so profane
a manner, as to cure diseases by it: which is no marvel, if it be true which
is related, of the approbation that was given of the Baptism used by
Athanasius in play amongst boys.

5. You may consider, that in the same Epistle when Bonifacius pressed
Augustine to show how Sureties could be excused from lying, who being asked of
the Child's faith, answered, He does believe, (for even in Baptism of Infants
they thought in all ages it necessary that a profession of faith go before) He
defends that act in this absurd manner: Respondetur credere propter fidei
Sacramentum, and thence he is called a believer, because he has the Sacrament
of faith. Which as it is ridiculous playing with words, in so serious a matter
before God, so it is a sensl^sse answer, since the interrogation was of the
Child's faith before it was baptized, and the answer was given before, and
therefore it cannot be understood of believing by receiving the Sacrament of
faith, which came after.

6. It is apparent out of the same Epistle, that Infants were then admitted to
baptism, whether they were the children of believers, or not; it was no matter
with what intention they brought them, nor whose children were brought; yea it
was counted a work of charity to bring any children to baptism, and in this
case the faith of the whole Church, was counted a sufficient supplement of the
defect of the parents or bringers faith: So that whereas the present defenders
of Infant Baptism pretend Covenant-holynesse a privilege of believers, it was
no such matter in the time of the Ancients, but they baptized any Infants, even
of Infidels, upon this opinion, That Baptism did certainly give grace to them,
and if they dyed without Baptism, they did perish. And thus I grant, that it
is true, the Epistle of Cyprian is cited and approved by Augustine. But neither
is Augustine to be approved for approving it; nor does it advantage your tenet,
that you have cited his citation of it: Thus far Mr T. his long answer to Mr
M. short quotation of Augustine.

We answer, and, Animadver.
First to that [ That the Authority of Augustine was it, which carried the
baptism of Infants in the following ages, almost without controul] we answer
three things. First, that Augustine flourished not till long after the first
age from that that was next after the Apostles; which was the time Mr T. said
before wherein baptism of Infants began to be in use as an unwritten Tradition.
For Mr T. says, Augustine flourished not till 405 or 410 years after Christ.
So that his authority prevailed not but in his and the times following him. But
what was it that carried the Baptism of Infants the 300 or 400 years before
Augustine? For all that time it was frequent as we have abundantly showed out of
good Antiquity. Secondly, if any after were carried by Augustine to hold
Infant Baptism; sure they heard or read Augustine arguing the thing by
Scripture and divine reason As against the Donatists and Pelag. etc.
. And then doubtless they were carried by the Scriptures and Reasons he urged;
and so not by the authority of the man Mr T. himself confesses in a matter of
40 lines after, that Councels etc. that did depend on Augustine, depended on
his Arguments.
. Augustine himself had taught them better, who in his works professedly
rejects some of the Fathers when he thought they went not along with the
Scriptures. Thirdly, It cannot be said that Augustines authority did in his
time carry Infant Baptism in a manner without control; seeing he had so much
bickering with the Pelagians about it who under some notion did contend against
it, as we showed before.

2 To Mr T. his quoting of Walafridus Strabo, we answer first, That seeing that
author is in such credit with Mr T. in that he quotes him so often, we expect he
should be believed as well for as as against us. Now Walafridus is for us,
against Mr T. in these things.

1. About Imposition of hands, that it did suppose baptism, which Mr T. denied
upon the discussion of Heb. 6.2. in his 14. Sect. of his Exercitation. But
Walafridus affirms it, De rebus Ecclesiasticis, chap. 26. sub initium: Says
he Primis temporibus impositione manuum baptismum confirmari solere.
. In the first times Baptism was wont to be confirmed with Imposition of hands.

2. About Athanasius, that in Athanasius his time, to his knowledge there was
Baptism of little children. Mr. T. doubts of it in his Examen, Sect. 6. But
Walfride shows us that Legitur quoque in ultimo Ecclesiasticae historiae libro
Athanasius adhuc puer, etc.

That, says he, we read in the last book of Ecclesiastical history that
Athanasius being but a little child, did act the imitation of Baptism among
his childish companions, which being done with recital of the words that the
baptizer did ask, and the baptized answered, when those able to speak were
baptized: Alexander the chief Minister of Alexandria knowing the same, judged
they should not be rebaptized, but ratified with confirmation. Thus Walafridus.

3. About Infant Baptism; which Mr T. denies, but Walafridus Strabo quotes
many authorities and antiquities for it. As that it In concilio Gerundensi
unius diei infans si in discrimine sit baptizari jubetur. In that Council it
was commanded that an Infant one day old, if in danger of death, should be
baptized. Diverse passages he has to the like purpose.

2. We answer to the Quotation of Walafridus Strabo, that he faulters and is
much faulty in the thing he is quoted for. For first, He calls the times of
Augustine who is but of late in comparison of many Ancients we have quoted
Prima tempora, that is, the first times, for Walafridus quotes Augustins
practice, that was not baptized till of ripe years, to prove, that in the
first times (as Walfridus calls them) men were not baptized till able to know
well and make profession, when as Augustine himself, as we have showed, and Mr T.
has confessed, did refer himself to ancienter times a great deal, as to
Cyprian that was almost 200 years before him, for the practice of baptizing
Infants. 2. Walafrid says, illis solummodo, etc. that is, To them only the
grace of Baptism was wont to be given, who were of integrity or ripeness of
body and mind, etc. but gives not proofs or reasons, but only one single
instance of Augustine himself, for an universal proposition. 3. As we noted
before, that Walfrid grossly mistook in the alleging that one instance of
Augustine. For Walfrid says in his book De rebus Ecclesiasticis (which we have
under our eye) that Augustine reports in his confessions of himself that he
continued a Catechumenus a chatechised person, till he was 25 years old, before
he was baptized; when as Augustine says of himself in his books of
confessions, that he was not converted till about the thirtieth year of his
age, after which he continued a Catechized one about two years, in which time
he wrote against the Academians, and wrote his Soliloquies, and in his 34 year
of his age, he was baptized at Mellain of Ambrose. You see then how little
credit is to be given to dreaming Walafrid in this point of Augustine. 4.
Walafrid confesses that upon the increase of diligent search into divine
Religion, men of understanding in Christian doctrine finding that peccatum
originale Adae. etc.
the original sin of Eve did hold guilty, not only those that had committed
actual sin, but those that had not; according to the 51 Psalm, in sin did my
mother conceive me, and Romans 3. All have sinned and come short of the glory of
God, and that from Adam we had all sinned, etc. That upon these grounds of
Scripture they, that is, those religious men, baptized their Infants into
remission of sin. And this practice of Infant Baptism Walfrid judges a
token of the growth of Religion. And alleges Augustins book of baptism of
Infants, and the African Councills, and the Fathers in general for Infant
Baptism, against that of Augustines practice, baptized at ripe years; and
withal Walafrid says, That thus those wise Christians did Baptize their
Infants into remission of sins, and for regeneration; and not as some
Heretical persons contra-opposing against the grace of God, contend that
Infants are not necessarily to be baptized.

And now I hope I have given Mr T. enough of his Walafrid (upon his so often and
confident alleging him) and have satisfied the Reader touching him.

If Mr T. speaks of Walfridus his mention of the invention of Gossips (as they
call them) following upon Infant Baptism, and spiritual kin of Gossips
following upon that, as thereby to blemish Walafridus, then Mr T. breaks his
own shins. For Mr T. did go upon the legs of Walafridus to fetch us an
antiquity against Infant Baptism; If Mr T. does but use Walafridus his
antiquity of the invention of those two things: We Answ. 1. Gossips were long
before Augustines time, even in Tertullians time many hundred years before.
Superstitions of diverse sorts, crept into the Church soon after Constantines
time. And spiritual kin of Gossips, is but a novell late dream of yester night
(in comparison) of the Church of Rome, falsely so called.

3. That neither of these inventions necessarily depend on Infant baptism,
more then a rope of sand, or pebles in a With: for as much as if believers
practiced the baptism of their children, it was seldom, but one of the
Parents were alive in the Infancy of the child. Kneeling followed the
Communion, and adoration of the Elements followed that kneeling; yet these do
nothing disparage the Communion it self in the Institution and substance of
it, but only defiled the Communicants that so superstitiously used that sacred
thing.

Thus of Walafridus Strabo. Now of Peter de Bruis and of Peter Cluniacensis his
Epistles to two A. B B. and two B B. against him, which are called Epistolae
contra Petro-brusianorum and Heinricianorum haereses. And well may De Bruis and
Heinricus be taxed with Herefie if that be true Cluniacensis charge upon
them. And he professes twice that he would not accuse them upon uncertainties
and reports; but upon that writing taken from them, and brought to him, wherein
he charge them as from their own mouths, that they denied all the Scriptures,
especially in the New Testament excepting the four Evangelists. Evangelium at
supra dixi vos suscipere. Epistolas Pauli etc. cur non suscipitis? Respondetis
quia non adeo certa nobis earum authoritas est. And for this cause Cluniacensis
spends two long chapters in proving the Old Testament and the New to be the
true Word of God, by quotations out of the four Evangelists, which Evangelists
Bruis and Henricus did acknowledge, and Cluniacensis goes over all the Bible
so, book after book, to so approve them to Bruis and his colleague. But to come
to the point in hand of paedobaptisme.

1. Mr T. tells us that Peter de Bruis denied Baptism, but tells us not the
rest that Peter de Bruis denied in that very point. Mr T. showed us fairly the
green grass, but not the snake lurching in it. Truly I could not but with
fadnesse read Cluniacensis of Peter de Bruis, when I found how there as
formerly, Mr T. takes here and there a touch of Authors that is for his turn,
and conceals that which is most necessarily mixed and twisted with it; which if
Mr T. had but intimated, would have overthrown his quotations.

For Mr T. his Petrus Cluniacensis gives us the first Preposition (so he calls
it) of Petrus de Bruis thus: [Mar. 16.15. Qui crediderit and baptizatus fuerit
salvus erit, qui vera non crediderit damnabitur. Ex his aperte monstratur,
nullum nisi exediderit, and baptizatus fuerit, hoc est, nisi Christianam fidem
habuerit, and baptismuni perceperit, posse salvari. Nam non alterum horum, fed
utrumque pariter salvat And a little after this is made more plain, Nec
baptismus sine propria fide, nec propria fides sine baptism aliquid potuit,
Neutrum cuim sine altero salvat. That is,
unde infantes, licet a vobis baptizentur, quia tamen credere, obstante aetate,
non possunt, nequaquam salvantur. Non rebaptizamus, sed baptizamus, quia
nunquam baptizatus dicendus est qui baptismo, quo peeccata lavantur, lotus non
est: that is, Mark 16.15. He that believes and is baptized shall be saved, but
he that believes not shall be damned. Hence it is apparently demonstrated
(says Peter de Bruis) that none unless he believe and be baptized, that is,
has Christian faith, and receives and perceives Baptism, can be saved. For
not one of these alone does save, but both of them jointly, (see the Margin
Neither could baptism without ones own proper faith be ableto do any thing, nor
ones own proper faith without baptism. For neither of them without the other
saves. So does Peter de Bruis after explain himself.
) Therefore (faith De Bruis to Cluniacensis his partee) though Infants be
baptized by you, yet because through the hinderance of their age they cannot
believe, by no means are they saved. We (says De Bruis) do not rebaptize, but
baptize, because he is never to be said to be baptized, who is not washed in
the Baptism wherewith sins are washed away. Thus was the Tenet of De Bruis,
as it is in Mr T. his Cluniacensis. Whence observe, 1. That De Bruis did hold,
That no Infants, while Infants, can have any faith. Contrary to that, That John
the Baptist was filled with the holy Ghost, from his mothers womb; which
filling, or in being in a sanctifying manner, is by the fruits of the Spirit,
Love, joy, faith, Gal. 5. As it is said, Romans 5. The love of God (that is, as
part of the meaning, the apprehension of the love of God) is shed into our
hearts BY HIS SPIRIT. The little children Mar. 10. had grace, because Christ
confirms their grace. And all graces go together. 2. De Bruis did hold, That
all, whether believers Infants, or believers of ripe years, dying unbaptized,
are damned. And so condemns many of the Martyrs to hell. 3. By this opinion of
De Bruis, he falsifies the Text he quotes. For though it be said in the
affirmative jointly. He that believes and is baptized shall be saved; yet it
is not said jointly in the negative, that unless One de both believe, and also
be Baptized, he shall be damned; but only singlely, he that believes not
shall be damned. 4. De Bruis holds, that God the principal agent, cannot work
or does not work (he wants power or will to work) the work of man's Salvation
without the Instrument Baptism. So that God is stripped of his Prerogative, and
tied to means. 5. That if a man be baptized at ripe years, and that by De
Bruis or his companion Heinricus, they conceiving him to be a believer, yet if
it prove after he was not a believer, at that baptism he is not to be said to
have been baptized. So that if after indeed that he believes, he be baptized,
that is no re-baptizing, because his former baptism was nothing.


By this the Intelligent Reader may see: 1. That ill might Mr T. allege De
Bruis for the Antipaedobaptisme he contends for. 2. That well might De Bruis
refuse not only the Fathers but all Orthodox Writers; for this is such an
Opinion as he knew he must stand alone without company. And therefore his best
course was to profess it as a singularity.


2. M. T. tells us that Cluniacensis says of De Bruis that he did reject the
authority of the Latin Doctors, being himself a Latin, ignorant of the Greek.

To this I Answer, That I have run over with mine eye De Bruis his proposition
of Antipaedobaptisme, and Cluniacensis his answer, and proof; but find not
that sentence, nor sense, that De Bruis was a Latin ignorant of the Greek. This
I find that Cluniacensis confesses of himself he was a Latin, and not
skilled in Greek, as we shall show by and by. See in the Margin a little after,
in our translation of Cluniacensis, and at our third particular in our answer
to Mr T. his fourth particular, viz. his Observation.

3. Mr T. says, that Cluniacensis saying of De Bruis, that he did run to the
Scriptures, Cluniacensis alleges against De Bruis the examples in the New
Testament of Christ's curing of persons at the request of others to prove Infant
baptism by.

To this we Answer, that the naked truth is this:

1. That one of Cluniacensis his businesses was to prove, That children were
counted nearer to Salvation, by the faith of the Parents, and so a fortiori
urges as from the non parentall-kin, to the believing Parent, from the curing
of the body to the curing of the soul, that Christ cured the bodies of some
upon the faith of them, (that were no Parents) that brought them. 2. Another of
Cluniacensis his businesses was to prove, That infants might be saved while
Infants; and accordingly alleges. 1. That as in the first Adam children,
whiles children, dyed spiritually; so children, whiles childrend. might be made
alive spiritually in the second Adam Christ. 3. That there was not an absolute
necessity of a joint concurrence of baptism, with faith in all that should be
saved, or else no Salvation: (For if Cluniacensis had not spoken to this, he
had for saken the terms and state of the question:) And therefore urges some
of the Martyrs; and that saying of Christ, He that confesses me before men,
him will I confess before my Father in heaven, and many other things, that
some are saved without baptism, that Martyrdom goes for baptism. His fourth
business was to prove that children might be baptized, and for that urges
Mat. 19. Mar. 10. Suffer little children to come unto me and forbid them not,
etc.

4. Mr T. makes an observation upon the former passages, as he himself has
represented them. From these passages (faith Mr T.) I gather, that as Petrus
Cluniacensis urged for Paedobaptisme the authority of Augustine and the Latin
Doctors; so Peter de Bruis and Heinricus appealed to the Scriptures, and the
Greek Church.

We answer. Here Mr T. makes a great treble intimation. 1. That Cluniacensis
urged Latin Doctors. 2. That therefore Augustines Authority was then in the
great esteem to carry the question of Infant Baptism. 3. That De Bruis did
appeal to the Greek Church, as if that were for him against Infant Baptism:
But I can find neither of these in Cluniacensis. This only I find (which I
suppose is that Mr T. alludes to) that Cluniacensis speaks to De Bruis, and
Heinricus the Apostle (as he is called, and De Bruis too) thus. Ad Vestram, etc.
Ad vestram brutamhaeresin refellendam innumera mihi doctorum
Ecclesiasticorumtestimonia suffragantur. Sed vestra authoritas and sapientia
tanta est, ut cos coram producere non praesumam; maxim cum didicerim Hilarium,
Ambrosium, Augustinum, Hieronymum, Leonem, Gregorium, etc. judicio majestatis
vestrae esse damnatos. Cumque Latinos omnes and a regno caelorum excluscritis,
nescio si Gracis, vel alterius linguae hominibus peperceritis. Quod si forte
vel illi sobrietate vestri examinis, peremptoriam sententiam evadere potuerunt:
Mihi quid? quantum ad praesens negotium spectat, aut parum aut nihil prodest?
Cum homo tantum Latinus, peregrinae linguae quam ignoro, testimoniis, quibus
vos aut convertere possim, aut convincere, uti non valeam. Quia sanctis
Ecclesiae Doctoribus fidem praebere dedignamini, ad puritlimum rivulorum omnium
fontem mihi reverteudum est, and de Evangelicis Apostolicis seu propheticis
dictis testimonia, si tamen vel illa suscipitis, sunt proferenda.
That is to refell your brutish heresy, innumerable testimonies of the
Ecclesiastical learned Drs give me their Votes. But your Authority and wisdom
is so great, that I may not presume to produce them; especially seeing I have
understood that you have cast off or excluded Hilary, Ambrose, Augustine,
Hierom, Leo, Gregory, etc. from the chair of the learned Doctors, and from the
kingdom of heaven. I know not whether you will spare the Greeks, or men of any
other language. But if perhaps they at least, by means of your sober
examination, have escaped your peremptory sentence, what is that to me? So far
forth as concerns the business in hand it little or nothing advantageth;
seeing I am only a Latin, I cannot use those testimonies of a strange tongue
which I understand not, whereby I may convert or convince you. Because ye
disdain to give credit to the holy learned Doctors of the Church, I must return
to the most pure fountain of all rivulets; and witnesses are to be brought out
of the sayings of the Evangelists, Apostles, and Prophets, if nevertheless you
receive so much as them.

This is the only likely place that I find in all Cluniacensis his chapters
and Treatises against De Bruis touching the point of paedobaptisme, which I can
imagine Mr T. should mean. And in all this let the reader judge whether Mr T.
his 3 suppositions in his Observation can be found; but rather the contrary: As

1. That Cluniacensis did not urge the Latin Doctors, but expressly waved them.
And of Augustine particularly he says in another place, in arguing against De
Bruis out of the Scriptures, Ee^^ hoc non de Augustino sed de Evangelio
protuli. I have produced this not out of Augustine, but out of the Gospel.

2. That therefore Augustines authority is not advanced in this point by
Cluniacensis against De Bruis.

3. That De Bruis did not appeal to the Greek Church; nor does Cluniacensis
charge it upon De Bruis, that he the said Bruis being ignorant of the Greek,
did appeal to the Greek Church; But as you heard in the translation of
Cluniacensis, That he the said Cluniacensis, professed himself a mere Latin
ignorant of the Greek. For Cluniacensis makes a supposition, that perhaps De
Bruis and Heinricus might despise the Greek Church and other Churches as well
as the Latin. Or if perhaps they did not despise the Greeks, yet Cluniacensis
being a Latin could not urge them. So also in the Translation before. And there
is the less probability that Cluniacensis should charge De Bruis with
appealing from the Latin Church to the Greek, as if it sided with De Bruis in
the point of Anabaptisme; For Cluniacensis urges on his own part the Greek
Church for Paedobaptisme against De Bruis in a general historical way; thus:
Tota Gallia, Hispania, Germania, Italia, ac universa Europa a trecentis, vel
quingentis fere annis, nullum nisi in infantia baptizatum habuerit. That is,
All France, Spain, Germany, Italy, and all Europe has not had any baptized
for the 300. or 500. years, but Infants. All Europe contains Greece, Continent
and Islands, And Cluniacensis wrote (as Mr T. quotes out of Usher) about the
year after Christ, 1150.) and so his 500. years reaches up to 650 after
Christ. This passage of Cluniacensis coming to my eye as I read him, I
observed after that Mr T. should think that Cluniacensis charged De Bruis with
appealing to the Greek Church as with him, against Infant Baptism; When as
Cluniacensis at most does but intimate that perhaps De Bruis and Heinricus may
not so peremptorily censure the Greek Doctors, as they had the Latin. However
if they didor did not, Cluniacensis was not skilled in Greek Doctors to quote
and urge them to convert or convince De Bruis and his colleague; which to me is
an intimation that Cluniacensis had understood some how, by Latin history or
report, that the Greek Doctors also were for Infant Bapiisme; or else he would
not have spoken by way of excuse, that he was only a Latin and not skilled in
the Greek, thereby to convert or convince De Bruis, in case he had appealed to
them.

After the allegations aforesaid of Walafridus and Cluniacensis Mr T. goes on
in the same Section of his EXAMEN to tell us a story, EXAMEN sect;. 8.
That the reason of Augustines authority was this; The Pelagian heresy being
generally condemned, and Augustines works being greatly esteemed, as being the
hammer of the Pelagians, the following refuters of Pelagianisme, namely,
Prosper, Fulgentius etc. the Councils that did condemn it, as those of
Carthage, Arles, Milevis etc. did rest altogether on Augustines ARGUMENTS and
often on his Words.

We answer, that here Mr T. asserts much without any proof; Animadver.
and to what great purpose I know not. But I must follow Mr T. Therefore we
say; It Augustines works were greatly esteemed, as the hammer of that
detestable Heresy of the Pelagians then generally condemned (as Mr T.
confesses); I hope Mr T. dislikes not this, that men should be famous for
opposing an infamous heresy, especially seeing by Mr T. his words, Wicked
Pelagianisme was as well generally condemned as hammered by Augustine, who
could do no less in faithfulness to the place and time he lived in, against
an heresy bolted forth just in his time when he began to be famous. And they
that condemned the total of Pelagianisme [That men by their own free will can
repel sin and keep the Commandements] (so apparent against Scripture, as
was no need for any to pin their faith on Augustines sleeve) they could not but
condemn that shredd of Pelagianisme; See before in our Quotat. of Hierom and
the Council of Carthage and the 90. Ep. among Aug. Epistles.
That [Infants need not be baptized into remission of sins as having none;
but if they must needs be baptized, then they are only baptized into the
Kingdom of heaven] An apparent lie against the truth of Scripture; That says
in Adam we all dyed, who sinned not after th similitude of his transgression.
Romans 5. And in sin did my mother conceive me. Psalm. 51. with many more
Scriptures which would have informed the Churches if Augustine had held his
peace, that Infants have sin in them and are baptized into remission of
sins or into nothing: Or if the Churches had wanted prompting from learned
men, Cyprian, Clem. Alexandrinus, Hierom, with many other ancient orthodox
learned, yea Mr T. his Walafridus would have held out so much, if Augustine had
been mute.

For Prosper its true he has some verses on the Acts of the Council of
Carthage, wherein being inflamed with an incomparable zeal against the Pelagian
heresy, he describes the convention of the Africans Vide Notas in Council.
Capthag. Et Baron. an. 416. nu. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
. But what is this to Prospers resting upon Augustine? or if Prosper writes De
Gratia and libero arbitrio in defense of Augustine, this shows that he was
rather an Advocate for, then a Client to Augustine. Therein Augustines works
depended on him, not he on them. And if he writes to Augustine, in that not
as from Augustine.

For Fulgentius, I find not that he does quote Augustine, in the main dispute
touching Pelagianisme in his responsory book to Peter Deacon; but often and
aptly quotes the Scriptures. In his books to Monimus touching piae
destination, he recites Monimus quoting Augustine. And at the end of Fulgentius
his works are printed at Basil together with them, Augustines or rather
Prospers book of answers to articles imposed upon him; and some bodies 6
books Hypognosticon in answer to the Calumnies of the Pelagians; Now whether
all this may argue Fulgentius his relyance on Augustines arguments, let the
reader judge.

For Mr T. to say, Prosper, Fulgentius, and those three Councels rested on
Augustines words, and to bring us no instances, or to say they rested on his
arguments, and to bring us no parallel of both their arguments, is to dictate,
not to prove: Or to say they relied on his arguments, and after to say they
relied on his words, is an expression of inconsistencies: Or to say they
relied on his arguments, is improbable: Likely they might rely upon arguments
by him used, but not as his, but as divine out of the Scriptures, where
Augustine urged them. But for Mr T. to say they relied altogether on Augustines
arguments, is impossible for Mr T. to make good to us; or for us to believe of
those worthyes.

For the Counsels Mr T. does not intimate, much less Cipher to us which (for
there are many of those names) he means. If he mean those Coetanian convented
in the same 416 year after Christ, Reus. Bucholc. Perk.
when about (by consent of Chronologers) Pelagianisme began to be condemned in
Councils, and Augustine had now a while been famous; We answer, it is true
that in this Council of Carthage, Pelagius and Coelestius the Heretics are
condemned; but by notable Scripture-arguments, without the least mention of
Augustine. And it is true that that Councels Epistle to P. Innocent the first,
and that P. Innocents Epistle back to that Council, are by some body put
among the Epistles of Augustine; and are there the 90. and 91. Ep. But neither
does P. Innocent in his Epistle take the least particular notice of Augustine;
nor do the Council in their Epistle. Nor do I know whether Mr T. does confide
that Augustine was at this Council, by the names subscribed thus; To the most
blessed, and most honored brother, Innocent the Pope, Aurelius, Numidius,
Rustic^anus etc. who were present in the Council of Carthage? Therein being
then Aurelius Bishop of Carthage, as appears in the Epistle of the aforesaid
Council of Milevis to the Emperors, Archad. and Honor. But when Augustine Bpp
of Hippon is named at a Council, he is called Augustinus. And if there be two
of the same name at a Council, they are both named with alius. As at this
Council of Carthage, Restitutus, alius Restitutus, and Victor, alius Victor.
But here is but once Aurelius, and no Augustinus.

As for the said Council of Milevis, it is true that in their Epistle to P.
Innocent there is among the rest expressed Silvanus, Valentinus, Aurelius,
Donatus, Restitutus, Lucianus, Alypius, Augustinus, Placentius etc, And that
that Council also was convented against Pelagius and Coelestius. But we find
not either in the Acts of that Council, or in the Epistle or etc. that there is
any more particular notice of Augustine then of any of the rest; much less of
any of his arguments against the Pelagians, or of his urging any one argument.
Yea Bucholcerus says that after these two Councils, viz. in Anno 417.
Augustine began to refute the Errors of Pelagius. By this Augustine should
rather learn at these Councills to dispute against Pelagianisme, then they to
rely on him.

In the next Council of Carthage in order of the printed Councils though
Augustine be there, yet any Dispute of Pelagianisme is not there.

In the seventh Council of Carthage, Bin.
alias a part or 2 Session of the sixth, we find but five titles of chapters or
canons: But they say there were recited 105 whereof a great part were those at
the third Council of Carthage and in the Council of Milevis as they say in the
title of this seventh or sixth Council. But that which they call the third
Council of Carthage, they date in the title to be in Anno 438, which was says
Bucholcerus, 8 years after Augustines death. If they mean that Council of
Carthage and Milevis of the same 416 year after Christ, to them we have
answered already. If the residue of the Canons of this seventh Council of
Carthage are (as the notes on it tell us and I rather believe) recited in the
following African Council convented in the time of Boniface and Celestin; there
indeed that Council is in diverse Canons against Pelagius, and Coelestius too,
and that about baptism of Infants which we mentioned before at large. But
there is no mention at all of Augustines persons or rrguments there: and is
after that which Mr T. Quotes.

For the Council of Arles, if Mr T. means the second. It was too ancient,
being under Siricius who was Anno 385. I say too ancient to be swayed by
Augustine (who was not famous according to Mr T. till Anno 405. or 410.)
against Pelagianisme, if there had been in it any debate about it, as there was
none. If Mr T. mean the third Council of Arles this was too young and of too
later times (being Anno 461 or as others 514 under P. John 1.) for Augustine to
be there. Nor was there need of his arguments, for there are but few Canons,
and none about Pelagianisme. It is true one Faustus writes an Epistle to one
Lucidus a Pelagian against his Errors which he had vented in a book which
Caesarinus, Avitus, and Johannes Antiochenus, confuted in writing; and this
Council approves Faustus his Epistle; in neither of all which is there the
least mention (that I can find) of Augustines name or arguments.

If Mr T. think I have not said enough or not punctually to his 3 Councils, and
two Fathers, let him blame his non-quotations, and general and confused
intimations. Thus of Fulgentius, Prosper, and the three Councils.

Next Mr T. objects that Augustine being counted as one of the four Doctors of
the Church, like the four Evangelists, EXAMEN. 8.
his opinion was the rule of the Churches judgment, and the Schools
determination; as to the great hurt of Gods Church, Luther and others have been
of late.

Answer. Animadver.
To that of Augustines respect and authority in matters of dispute we have
spoken once and again: that it has not been so high, as Mr T. his elevation.
There were sundry Antagonists and some honestly minded as Acrius etc. did
pretty well keep Augustine, Hierom etc. from too much hight and extravagancy,
as the Calvanists did the Lutherans; and like instances might begiven of later
times.

But Augustine, EXAMEN Ibid.
says Mr T. proved original sin from the baptism of Infants, and so did
the Council of Milevis anathematizing them that did deny it. Ergo, great was
the sway of Augustines authority.

We answer, Animadver.
(having spoken of the Councills before and of their Scripture arguments) that
Augustine proved Infant Baptism from the Scriptures, as we have often quoted;
and then the result of Mr T. his argument will be only this. Augustine read the
Scriptures for original sin in Infants, and Infant Baptism, and so did the
Council of Milevis. Ergo, the Counc^ll ^f Milevis depended on the authority of
Augustine: A non-sequitur that every man will perceive. Two Councillors urge
the same clause of a statute, or the same deduction thence, clear to both their
reasons, will it follow therefore that the ones judgment depended on the other?

But says Mr T. I value Augustines judgment, EXAMEN
just so much as his proofs and reason weigh.

We answer, Animadver.
That Is well: But as we may not extol good men too much, so nor depresse an
Augustine, a Luther, as if we would by a back blow strike out their eyes, and
then say they saw nothing. Augustines retractations, and Luthers voluntary
suffering of so many losses, and crosses for the truth, are incomparable signs
they aspired not to be high in authority over men's consciences. Augustine
argued out of the Scriptures plentifully according to his light for that he
held; so does Mr T. so do others. Therefore let us not too rashly despise one
another arguments. The Council of Milevis did Anathematize them that did deny
original sin, and perhaps them that said Infants were not baptized into
remission of sins; but they do not curse them that will not make Infants
original sin an argument for Infant Baptism. Sure Augustine did not so
Anathema, and therefore the C. of Milevis took no such thing from him, and
therefore no wonder they do not practice it.

But Mr T. again urges the baptism of Augustine at above 30 years old,
EXAMEN. 8.
of Alipius his friend, at ripe years, of Ad^odatus his son at 15, to prove
that the custom of baptizing Infants was not so received, as that the Church
thought it necessary that all children of Christians by profession should be
baptized in their Infancy.

We answer first in general: Animadver.
That they were persuaded that of Equity they ought to baptize all Christians
children as the stream of Antiquity has carried it, of which before abundantly.
And Mr T. himself charge Augustine and Cyprian, that they thought too many
Infants were to be baptized, namely all that had Christian parents or
undertakers. If therefore in fact some few were not baptized in infancy, it
must needs be that there was some outward forcible stop, no inward let in the
judgment. As the Israelites in fact gave not their children the first Seal or
sign of Circumcision for 40 years in the wilderness by reason of their
pilgrimage there so long; and God bare with it; though by equity they should
have done it upon the eighth day after birth upon pain of cutting off, Genesis 17.

2 In particular: Touching Augustine's baptism, that it was not done till he
was about 34 or 35 years of age we have before acknowledged and we shall give
a full account why, anon after, when we have done with this 8. Sect. of Mr T.
his EXAMEN, and return to his EXERCITATION. Section 17. where Mr T. urges the
same thing touching Augustine. But mean while for Adeodatus Augustines son,
if Mr T. be sure he was baptized at 15, the cause might be this: Seeing
Augustine when he was at man's estate about 32 years old ran into most
blasphemous errors, and after that became Catechumenus A Catechized, about two
years, and so not baptized till about 34, or 35, he might possibly have a son
of about 15 years old unbaptized till the father were owned in the Church for a
Christian, and then he and his son Adeodatus and his friend Alipius might be
baptized the same Day; Augustine and his friend being men; Adeodatus his son
being a youth of 15 years of age. But there is no mention or probality that
either Alipius had believing parents; or that Alipius had been long a
Christian, but rather the contrary See August. Confess. lib. 6. c. 7.
. And it is uncertain to me (and not to me only; looking more wishly on the
words of Augustine, whether Adeodatus were baptized the same time his father
was or no? Inde ubi tempus advenit, quo me nomen dare oporteret, relicto rure,
Mediolanum remeavimus. Placuit and Alipio renasci in te mecum, Jam indato
humilita esacramentis tuis congrua, and fortisumo domitore corporis, ulque ad
Italicum solum glaci^^e ^udo pede obterendum insolito ^^su. Adjunximus etiam
nobis puerum Adeodatum, ex^^e ^^tum carnaliter de peccato meo. Tu been feceras
eum. Annorum erat fe^me qui decim, and ingeni^ praeveniebat multos graves and
doctos viros. Munera tua tibi co^f^eor, do nine deus meus, creator omn^um, and
mul^um potens reformare nostra deformia. Nam ego in illo puero praeter delictum
nihil habebam. Quod enim enutriabatur a nobis in disciplina tua, tu
inspiraveras nobis, nullus alius. Aug. Confess. lib. 9. cap. 6.
Nor is it of moment whether he was or was not. For Mr T. his conclusion from
these premises of Augustine, Adeodatus, and Alipius, I say his conclusion,
that the Church thought it not NECESSARY That all children of Christians by
profession should be baptized in their Infancy, does not necessarily follow.

But Mr T. in his EXAMEN. Sect. 8. asserts further, that though he conceived
with Grotius on Mat. 19.14. That Baptism of Infants was much more frequented
and with greater opinion of necessity in Africa, then in Asia, or other parts
of the world; for (says he) in the Councilis you cannot find ancienter
mention of that custom then the Council of Carthage; yet Mr T. does very much
question whether they did in Africa even in Augustines time baptize children,
except in danger of death, or for the health of body, or for such like reason.
I do not find (says Mr T.) that they held that Infants must be baptized out
of such cases; for it is clear out of sundry of Augustines Tracts, as
particularly Tract. 11. in Johan. that the order held of distinguishing the
Catechumeni and baptized, and the use of catechizing before baptism; still
continued.

ANIMADVERS. We Answer. 1. For the judgment of Grotius as it appears there, we
have abundantly spoken of it before, as for us. 2. For this particular quotation
as applied by Mr. T. we say, besides that it is a naked thing, not backed to a
sufficiency of a clear and manifest assertion from negatives; especially in the
point of necessity;
we may justly Quare. 1. How much more frequencie and necessity does Mr T.
mean? How much more can he make appear? For sure he cannot dispute from
punctilio's. And what use will Mr T. make of it, if for a time there appeared a
grain more in Africa then in Asia?

An Argument is not managed by countenance, or gravity of asserting. Men in
diverse countries may more frequently, and with more ^^al practice a truth, and
yet the truth be still the same. Yea different complexions and conditions of
Countries in receiving, or opposing a truth, may make it to be more or less
practiced, and yet the minds of true Christians in both, may be alike one with
the rule. Yea if the more frequency of Infant Baptism were never so ancient in
Africa, according to the Councils there, whereof that in Cyprians time was one,
Cyprian was within 148 years after the Apostles.
yet we know that it came first from Asia, This Asia the great consisted of
Anatolia, Sy^ia, Palestina, Armenia, Arabia, Media, Assyria, Mesopotamia,
Persia, Chaldea, Parthia, Hircania, Tartaria, China, India, the Islands of the
Indian and Mediterranean seas.
where man was created, Christ born, wrought mirocles, suffered; All the
penmen of both Testaments acted; were the Monarchies and captivities over the
Church. Great Asia included Asia the less, since called Anatolia This Anatolia
or Asia the less comprehends Cilicia, Pamphylia, Lycia, Bythinia, Pontus,
Paphlagonia, Galatia, Cappadociae, Lycaonia, Pissdia, Armenia the lisse, and
Asia propria.
(that is, the Estern Country) where were the seven Churches Revel. 1. this
included Asia Propria Which comprehends Caria, Jonia, Lydiaa, Aeulis, and both
the phyrigiae's.
of which at least is meant that Act. 19.10. and 27. All Asia heard the Word of
the Lord Jesus; And certain which were the chief of Asia sent unto Paul.
Sutably we quoted Justin Martyr for one of our witnesses since the Apostles
time, of Infant Baptism. He was a Samaritan (which is part of Palestine in
Asia the Great) Genere Samaritanus, atque e Samaritanis ad Christi fidem
transiit, Epiphan. Some of Samaria were converted by Christ, John 4. v. 5. v.
29. v. 30. v. 39. After in the Apostles time the Word was preached to many
Villages of the Samaritans Act. 8.25. Justin Martyr was converted to the faith
about 28 years after the Apostles.

To that of not baptizing children in Africa but in danger of death, or etc. we
have showed the contrary out of several antiquities, and particularly out of
Cyprian whither we refer the reader. And sure enough, from the life of Augustine
(of which anon after) it is clear that Augustines sickness whiles young, was
some occasion of deferring his baptism for that time. For he says in his first
book of Confessions, and c. 11. That having been sick, they deferred their
thoughts of baptizing him, that they might the more freely give him his will to
do what he would for the furtherance of his recovery, which they might not
allow him if once he were under the bonds of Baptism.

Those words Mr T. adds, Children were baptized for the health of body, or
such like reason, seem to clash against that he so often presses in his book,
that Augustine and the Ancients did too much put salvation, and the taking away
Original sin, in Baptism, which presently Mr T. repea^es within 25 lines
following. You may conceive (says Mr T.) how light Augustines judgment was,
by considering the ground upon which Augustine held, and urged the baptism of
Infants so vehemently; which was (says Mr T.) as all know that read his works,
the opinion he had, that without baptism Infants must be damned by reason of
Original sin, which is not taken away but by baptism; and for this quotes
several places out of Augustine, T. 7. de Not. and Gra. c. 8. T. 2. Ep. 28.

For the distinction of the Chatechised and the Baptized, and that the use of
catechizing before baptism still continued, and a great while after (he means
Augustines time:) All this does not overthrow the common tenet and practice of
that antiquity, and upward, as well as downward, in baptizing Christians
children. The chatechising being for the children of those whose parents were
not supposed Christians, as before we abundantly showed out of Tertullian, and
Iunius upon him: and out of Pareus, Calvin, Bullinger, Marlorat, etc. on Heb.
6.2. And this is practiced in all Protestant Kingdoms to this day,
notwithstanding the constancy of baptizing Infants. If there be not used a
right judgment to determine who are Christian-parents, that is the fault of
men, not of the Ordinance, or its institution. If I should go about to answer
that quotation of Augustine, with others out of Augustine, I might abound with
his sentences for Infant Baptism. As his collation of Baptism and
Circumcision, in many places of his works. His Collation of baptism, with the
Flood, the Cloud, and Red Sea, diverse times. His sayings, That Baptism is not
to be deferred. That repentance is not absolutely universally necessary before
baptism; His several tracts of the Baptism of little ones, etc. Which we need
not quote to them that are acquainted with Augustine. All which show in what
sense Augustine spoke of catechizing before baptism; viz. of those whose
Parents were not Christians. If with Nazianzen he had held that little children
of three years old, being Chatechised, to answer that they understood not,
might be baptized; what is that more to the purpose then to baptize them whiles
Infants? We must understand that in most of the Fathers times there were no
whole Kingdoms, or for the most part converted, or Religious worship set up by
allowance of the state, but the general of them were heathens. Therefore of
necessity, there must have been some catechizing before the baptizing of some.
And for baptizing Infants for bodily health, etc. named but not quoted out of
Augustine, as his opinion, we can answer it out of Augustine who says; T. 7.
Col. 84. c. Edit Basil. Ibid. Col. 55.
That Baptism does not profit all. That Baptism profits not without charity.
That one baptism by faith purges. And that the Virtue of Baptism is not in
the water but in the word; which we forbear to quote and translate at large, as
having too much (if it might have been prevented troubled the read^r with
quotations already. They are obvious to him that reads Augustine.

But Mr T. EXAMEN. 8.
objects that catechizing before baptism continued in Augustines time, and
after a great while, in Asia, because Peter Cluniacensis says that there had
been none but Infants baptized in all Europe for 300 or 500 years before his
time: but does not deny the baptism of men of ripe years in Asia.

We answer, First touching Cluniacensis we have said abundance before. Secondly,
Animadver.
that this Argument does no more determine any thing about Asia, then about
Africa (which is Mr T. his Qu. in hand). And for Africa we have heard
abundantly out of all sorts of antiquity of the baptizing of Infants. Thirdly,
Cluniacensis professes himself a Latin, ignorant of Greek and other tongues,
and therefore does not determine here any thing concerning places out of
Europe, but is silent, concerning them. Fourthly, Touching baptism of Infants
in Asia we heard before.

To that Mr T. objects Augustine and Ambrose his judgment for Infant Baptism,
as putting too much in the ordinance, as conducing to salvation;

We answer; First, we have but now in that answered for Augustine by Augustine.
2 That the Papists put too much of justification in faith, as it is absolutely
considered as a quality; may not we therefore hold justification by faith
relatively considered as taking in the object Christ? So the over zeal of
those fathers touching the necessity of Infant Baptism, must not beat us off
from the mediocrity of truth touching it. 3 For Augustine let us go no further
then Mr T. his quotation of him, to clear him. Tom. 2. Ep. 28.
That Infants cannot be saved but BY THE GRACE OF THE LORD CHRIST, which he
has commended to us in his Sacraments. He says there they are saved by the
Grace of the Lord Christ. And says only Christ commends his grace to us in
the Sacraments. And for my part when Augustine and others of the Fathers do
speak so confidently of the salvation of Unbaptized Martyrs, yea of the
Unbaptized Thief; I cannot imagine that it was their constant absolute opinion
that salvation lay in the very bare ordinance; Or that all unbaptized Infants
were certainly damned.

We gave you touches before, that the fathers writing infinite much, speaking
sometimes in one extreme against the opposites on the one hand, did after in
their polemicall dealing with the opposites on the other hand, or in a
doctrinall way moderate the same. So we must take their sayings altogether, or
we shall wrong them and our selves too. And therefore Mr T. might have done
well, not to have charged up so fiercely upon Augustine and Ambrose in this
point, seeing Mr T. confesses presently following, That Ambrose and Augustine
in his 4 book de Baptism contra Donatistas. c. 22. yielded, That either
Martyrdom, or the desire of baptism might supply the defect of baptism. We
could add several other expressions of Augustine to the same purpose: Tom.
5.713. Edit Bas. contra Donat. l. 5. To. 7.452. Edit Bas. Ibid. 101. Ibid. 663.
As that death sometimes supplies the place of baptism. That suffering, faith,
conversion of the heart, supply the room of Baptism. That the Baptism of
blood, is greater then the Baptism of the river. That little ones not baptized
have a most easy condemnation. Lastly, whatever the rigidnesse of Augustine and
Ambrose was in some passages touching Infant Baptism; the grand point in hand
is whether Baptism in these men's, and other fathers times were in practice as
an unwritten tradition, or as grounded on the Scriptures? And for the latter,
those and the rest of the ancients are full, and to purpose, as we have heard.

For Mr T. endeavoring to detract from Augustine touching his inferring the
necessarynesse of Infant Baptism from John 3.5. Because Aquinas and Bellarmine
urge the same place for the same point; See Marlorat on the place and
Bullingers words.
to me is a poor argument. Do the Papists and we agree in no truth? Do not
generally all our most famous godly and learned Protestants within this last
hundred years understand that very place of baptism? And dare any of us in our
Pulpits say there is not (necessitas praecepti and medy) a mandatory and
isntrumental necessity of ordinances, that at our peril we may not wilfully
neglect them? So that with Cyprian before quoted we conclude, we must not as
far as in us lies debarr our posterity from salvation.

Likewise the next objection of M. T. is not so considerable, EXAMEN. 8.
where he says that he cannot find among the Ancients for Baptism, that
ground of ours that the Covenant of grace belongs to believers and their Seed.

For first we demand; Animadver.
must not the worthy Ancients be said to hold a tenet upon scripture-arguments
(for that is the point at present) unless they hold it upon all arguments? 2
We find few of our arguments against Episcopacy in the Fathers; yet in this we
side with Aerius against them; though they condemned him for Heretical. 3
Antiquity has somewhat of the Covenant of grace in relation to
Infant Baptism, in the things we have before quoted. Tertullian sets recounting
in Christ, over against counting in Adam. Cyprians Epistle tells us in those
times they looked to circumcision for Infant baptism. Gre. Nazianzen once and
Augustine often makes parallels and comparisons between Circumcision and
Baptism. Tertullian again says that the children of either parental-sexe
sanctified, are holy by the prerogative of the seed, and the rule of
discipline. See also before Clem. Alexandrinus, and Hesichius; yea some of the
Ancients were so far transported in the consideration of the descent of the
line of the Covenant of grace, from the parent to the child, that they did
transcend to this opinion, that the child conceived and being in the mother at
her baptism, was some how baptized in the mother. This appears partly from
Augustine disputing the contrary August. lib. 6 contra Julian. Col. 11 19.
edit Basil.
(and it is not my note only, but the note of some others also); and partly
from one clause in a decree of the Neo^asarien Synod, held Anno. 313. after
Christ, (as some interpret it Balsam. et Zanar.
) wherein they decree (...), (...), etc. That is, the woman great with child
may be baptized when she please; for in this she that is about to bring forth,
imparteth nothing to the child that is to be borne. Now if this be so (Ex malis
moribus bonae procreantur leges) that a law supposes a fault; then there is
some how, some what too much inspection in some of the ancients, upon the
Covenant of grace in relation to the Baptism of Infants.

EXAMEN Animadver.
As for the Popish Schoolmen, Biel, Cajetan, and Gerson touching the necessity
of the Baptism of Infants which Mr. T. alleges; we are not careful to give
any answer to them, as we are not to care for their opinions. Protestants are
not tied to make good the dreams of Papists. Or if this will not go for an
answer, let one of their own tribe answer them; namely Peter Lumbard in his
sense of the text, 3 of Ioh. ver. 5. upon which Aquinas and Ballarmine and the
rest of that route towred up on high their too sublime and absolute necessity
of the baptism of Infants upon pain of salvation. Peter Lumbards words are,
The place of Ioh. 3.5. unless a man be borne again of Water and the Spirit,
he cannot enter into the kingdom of God, is to be understood (says he) of
those which may be, yet contemn to be baptized.

To that Mr. T. objects about Augustines opinion of giving the holy Supper to
Infants; we will answer to (God permitting) anon when we return to Mr. T. his
Exercitation Sect. 17. Where he has the same charge against Augustine, though
it be quite beside the point in hand of Infant Baptism, and without all
coherence of argumentation in the dispute.

Mr. T. Yet again urges (even to a surfeit upon it) Augustines opinion of the
necessity of Infant Baptism, EXAMEN.
in that he held such a certainty of obtaining reg^n^ration thereby.

We reply. 1 This is no good argument, Animadver.
Augustine held Infant baptism too rigidly; therefore he held it not at all.
This must be the argument or else it is to little purpose. For Mr. M. quotation
(to which Mr T. gives the present objection as part of his answer) is that also
in Augustines time, as formerly, Infants-Baptisme was the Tenent and practice
of the Christian Churches. 2. Mr. T. might have excused Augustine, and answered
himself touching this out of Grotius whom he has so often quoted for his own
turn, which Grotius tells him The words of Grotius on Matt. 19.14. are;
caeterum illa sententia, infantes non baptizatos certo suppl^ciis aeternis
quanquam levioribus addici, tam rigide defensa ab Augustino, ne ipsi quidem
Augustino placuera^, ante quam cum Pelagio collideretur. Voss. de necess. bap.
These. 21.
that Augustines, rigidnesse about the necessity of Infant baptism, Ne ipsi
placuerat Augustino, was not pleasing to Augustine himself before that he
disputed with Pelagius. Likely he might Confess, or Retract somewhere in his
works somewhat of that rigidnesse; but we have not leisure as that Emperor to
hunt after every fly. 3. Let Vossius answer. They object (says he) that
Augustine, Fulgentius, Gregory, and the Author of Hypognosticon, adjudged
those Infants to Hell torments that dyed without Baptism. And this was Socinus
his objection as well as Mr T. his, here in the margin of his 8 Section of his
EXAMEN. p. 15. But says Vossius, 1 The later ancients (that also held infant
baptism) did justly disapprove of their judgment as Bernard disputes against
it in his 77. Ep. And of the same judgment was his fellow Petrus Blesensis of
the same time with Bernard. Sermon. 22. de S. Trinitate saying Sufficit etc. The
spirit and water suffice, the spirit and blood suffice; if not the CONTEMPT OF
RELIGION, but the point of necessity excludes the water. The spirit if self
will suffice, because the testimony thereof has weight. So again the same man
Sermon. 24. In festo Iacobi. By this you may see how far Mr T. his former
assertion is true, that Augustines authority carried others without control,
in the point of Infant baptism. 2, Vossius answers we oppose (says he)
Augustine to Augustine; For nothing is more clear and manifest then those
words of Aug. lib. 5. de Baptismo contra Donatistas. I again and again
considering (says Aug. there) do find, that not only suffering for the name of
Christ, may supply that which was wanting of baptism, but also faith, and the
change of the heart, if perhaps by reason of the distresses of the time,
recourse cannot be had to baptism. By this you may perceive whether we gave a
just reason why Augustines, and his son Adeodatus his baptism was deferred (if
Adeodatus his was deferred).

But how does Mr T. prove his last allegation of Aug. rigid opinion of the
necessity of Infants baptism? EXAMEN. 8.


First thus. Augustine usually puts Regeneration for Baptism. Animadver.


We Retort. Yet before cap. 13. in our answ. to EXAMEN. 4. EXAMEN. 8.
Mr T. did much doubt whether Ireneus might mean baptism, by the word
Renascuntur, that is, are regenerated.

Secondly Mr T. proves it out of 23. Epistle of Augustine to Boniface. That
though people brought children to baptism out of their by-intention to procure
the childrens health, or etc. yet those children might be regenerated.

We demand in answer to this, Animadver.
What great thing is inferred hence; we say not to the qu. of Infant Baptism
in Augustines time (for it is nothing to that) but what is it to Mr T. his
design of disgracing Augustine upon the by (as Civilians do witnesses, that all
judgment may lie in their own breasts)? For what if Augustine went to hear
Ambrose merely to be tickled in the ear with his eloquence as he confesses,
and at that time God converted him by Ambrose his Ministry: And whiles another
went to a Sermon of purpose for bodily sleep, was converted out of the
spiritual sleep in sin; Does this advance the Ministry of the word too high,
to say hereupon and in the like instances, that the word converts men to the
true end, whiles they come to it for a false end? The same may be said of
Baptism; and in charity (that hops all things) of Augustines meaning. For it
is clear out of several places of Augustine so common that we need not quote
more then those quoted before, that Augustine did think that baptism did not
profit all that received it.

But Augustine (says Mr T.) was so corrupt in this matter, EXAMEN
so as to excuse it, if not to justify this fact of so bringing Infants with a
sinister end to baptism.

The bare r^citall (say we) of Augustines words will be a sufficient
confutation of this objection. Animadver.
Nec illud te move at and let not that move thee (says Augustine to Boniface.
Epistle 23.) that some bring their little ones to receive baptism, not with
that faith that they may by spiritual grace be regenerated to eternal life;
but because they think by this remedy they may retain, or receive temporal
health. For not therefore, are those children not regenerated, because they are
not offered by them with this intention. For by them the necessary ministry or
service is Celebrated. By all which words I should think that Augustine does
no way justify or excuse their bad intention; but magnifieth Gods powerful
operation, that he can bestow the right end of an ordinance, whiles by men the
wrong is intended. Let us interpret others with that candor we our selves would
be interpreted, as far as words and Grammar will permit.

Upon this quotation of Aug. 23. Ep. Mr T. Concludes his period thus; EXAMEN
No marvile then if it be true, which is related of the approbation that was
given of the baptism used by Athanasius in play among boys.

And upon this Objection we make these animadversions. Animadver.
1. That it was not Augustine that approved it, but Alexander the chief
Minister of Alexandria 60. years before Augustine. 2. That this story is in Mr
T. his esteemed Walafridus. Chap. 26. de reb. eccles, by him before quoted; yet
here he mistrusts him. 3. By this it seems Athanasius (upon whom Mr T. before
called to speak in the point of childrens baptism) knew that in his time
little children, at least as soon as they could well speak, EXAMEN
were baptized.

But Mr T. objects that Augustine absurdly answers to Boniface about excusing
Gossips from a lie when they say the child to be baptized does believe.

We answer Seeing Mr T. does not here question but a child may have faith,
Animadver.
the rest is so light a thing he speaks of and so impertinent to the Qu. Of
the Tenet and practice of Infant baptism in Augustines time, as that it
deserves no answer. Only we desire but this equitable favor of Mr T. and his
friends, that upon just occasion we may have but the same freedom to plainly
lay down to the world the strange fantasies of several ages of Anabaptists
or Antipaedobaptists, as he has wrung even to blood as we say a few unwary
expressions, and petty mistakes of the most Godly and learned Martyrs and
Saints of God.

EXAMEN
Whereas Mr T. does paraphrase upon Boniface his question to Augustine about
Sureties at baptism [That even in Baptism of Infants they thought in all
ages, it necessary, that a profession of faith go before.

We anser. Animadver.
1 We wonder Mr T. will assert confession of faith in all ages before all
baptism, from witnesses or Sureties; when as we know that the first intimation
of touching them was not till about 195 years after Christ. And how novel the
invention of their confessions is, who can justly tell? 2 I propose it to grave
consideration; Whether confessions of Sureties were not at first in imimation
of Christian parents (in whose stead they stood)? So that as children were
baptized, when their parents had formerly made confession; So Sureties
confessed in relation to themselves, that they might be reputed fit to stand as
a kind of parents to a child of an unbeleeving parent to be baptized; even as
Abraham; profession of his belief in God Genesis 15. Genesis 17. made him stand as a
parent to all his household.


The last thing Mr T. objects against Augustine, EEAMEN
and through him against Antiquity, is, that in those times they baptized all
Infants: whether of believing parents or not; or whether with this or that
intention they brought them.

We answer; 1 Too much, Animadver.
does not overthrow enough in antiquity to prove. Infant Baptism in those
times; which is the dispute now in hand. 2 That this argues against Mr T. that
Infant Baptism has been anciently more universally practiced, then adult
baptism. 3 That in Augustine's time, Boniface scrupled whether the sins of
parents might not praejudice the baptism of their Infants, seeing the faith of
believing parents did advance the baptism of their Infants. Augustine Epist. 23.
And Augustine himself there answers that Infants are regenerated (he means
baptized) by the spiritual will of them (parents, or in place of parents) that
bring them. And in effect has this further in his first book de anima, and
ejus origin chap. 11. That those children that are born of wicked parents, and
are not committed into the hands of any godly persons that may stand instead of
parents As Abraham did to all his family of strangers etc.
, and so dye unbaptized, are damned by the traduction of original sin from
their parents. 4 You heard before how Antiquity looked upon the descent of the
Covenant of grace, from parents to children.


Thus by many instances and vindication of ancient Writers you have seen that
that particular of Mr T. his Minor in his fifth argum. of his Exercitation
[That, in some ages after the first from the Apostles, the Tenet, and practice
of Baptism was in use, as a Tradition not written] I say you have seen it
proved to be most false: and have vindicated the Ancients from Mr T. his
objections in his EXAMEN. Exercitat.. 17.
Now let us return to his Exercitation. 17.

Where Mr T. will undertake to prove it, that at one time, at least in one
place (where Origin lived) by one author, to wit Origin, that Infant Baptism
went for an unwritten tradition. And for this he quotes only one place, and
only quotes it, not giving us the words he intends, in any language.

But we have given you the place before in the beginning of this 14 chap. of our
Animadversions, Animadver.
in our quotation of Origin. And that place out of him, in his fifth book on
the sixth chapter of the Epistle to the Romans Mr T. quotes here, by the name of
Hom. on Romans 6. where we have cleared it, that Origin cannot understand by
Tradition, an unwritten Tradition. To which we add now that which is very
considerable to clear the mind of Origin, from holding any baptism to be a
mere tradition, namely, in that he speaks so often in his 6 Hom. super Iesum
Nave, that Baptism (without limitation) is the second Circumcision. And once
has there these words [Sed ex quo venit Christus, and dedit nobis secundam
circumcisionem, per baptismum regenerationis etc. that is; But since Christ
came, and has given us the second Circumcision, by baptism of regeneration he
has purged our souls]. So Origin. So that now Mr T. may take his choice: Would
Mr T. accept of Origin on Romans 6. for his witness for an unwritten tradition of
Infant baptism? We have heard his witness, examined him by circumstances; he
speaks no such thing. Or would Mr T. impeach, and disgrace his own witness as
not competent, saying, that he is uncertain whether he reads Origin or
Ruffinus, that reads that enarration on the Ep. to the Romans; Why then does Mr
T. quote that one place, thereby before the ignorant to assay to blast all the
best antiquity, almost since the Apostles, that constantly say Baptism of
Infants came from Christ and the Apostles, and ground it upon several
Scriptures, and divine reason? Why did Mr T. hang so huge a weight on so small
a wire? He has produced but one pretended place on Romans 6. for himself, and
that he weakens too with a glance at Origens works on Leviticus, to prevent our
quotation of any thing thence. But as we have given him one place out of Origin
on Levit, and another out of him on Romans 6. both as they are translated out of
the Greek by Hierom, as the best Editions promise us; so we have given him a
place out of Origin on Luke, against which Mr T. has made no exception. And we
say further if Mr T. be not sure whether he reads Origin on Romans Then he is not
sure whether he reads Ruffinus, for his doubt lies between them two.

To that of Mr T. concerning Augustine and Hieromes relyance (as he supposes)
only on Cyprians 59. Epist, Exercitat.. 17.
to Fidus for Infant Baptism, we say only this, Let the Reader turn back to
what we have translated out of those Authors, or turn to our Quotations of
them, and read their Scripture Arguments, and then judge whether Mr T. does not
much mistake. I confess since I took th^s work in hand to Animadvert a little
upon Mr T. his Exercitation, I have often wondered that he speaks sometimes so
unwarily, (that had such long time to consider) sometimes gives forth great
things with small hints, and glanceth intimations for positions and probations.
But I answered my self with this, likely he remembered he was propogating a
now-taking-opinion. He therefore that will not consider; but will be mistaken,
let him be mistaken, if he will be mistaken.

Thus of Mr T. his first particular in his minor, That Infant Baptism was an
unwritten tradition in some ages after the first of the Apostles: but he cannot
tell when as we have proved.

To his second particular of Jewish imitation. Exercitat.


We have spoken already in answer to the Major. Animadver.
And we have showed that the pious learned ancients had other Scripture reasons,
then only Circumcision, or their greediness to increase the number of
Christians (who so often gave warning to take heed to whom they gave that sacred
thing baptism Caeterum Baptismum non temere credendumesse sciunt quorum
officium est. Nolite dare sanctum canibus; ne participes a liena delicta etc.
Textul. lib. de baptis. cap. 18.
) or Mr T. his perhaps (a fine word for an argument and in divine things)
heathenish lustration of little ones; When Justin Martyr, Tertullian etc.
apologized against heathenisme for Christianity; and many of our quoted authors
sealed their opposition against Heathenisme with their blood. And if there were
any true Jewish imitation of Circumcision in Infant Baptism, it was in Fidus
that thought children might not be baptized till the eight day, and not in
Cyprians Epistle that confuted him. Nor do they more intimate the necessity of
baptism to salvation then Christ himself John 3.5. Except a man he borne again
of water and the spirit etc. (which is a place they often quote) or the Apostles
that say we are baptized into remission of sins, and for receivall of the
holy spirit, which they, Hierom and others also allege. And it is most sure
there is such a necessity in regard of Gods precept and means as to us in the
use of ordinances, as let them venture their salvation on the willing neglect of
them that dare; I dare not. As it is a sin to put more in an ordinance then
God ever put in it (as the Anabaptists talk of wonderful strange
manifestations at and in the act of dipping, I know what I speak) or to think
one is damned without an ordinance when God prevents the having it, by death or
otherwise; so greater is the sin to contemn an ordinance enjoined when it
may be had: As Tertullian speaks in his book de Baptismo chap. 13. Hic ergo
scelestissimi illi etc.
Here those most graceless follows provoke questions: So that they say baptism
is not necessary, to whom faith is sufficient etc.

To Mr T. Exercitat.. 17.
his third particular in his Minor, that Infant Baptism was not universally
practiced; for Constantine was not baptized whiles an Infant, though his mother
Helena were a Christian: Nor Augustine, though his mother Monica was a
Christian etc. We answer.

1 No wonder if baptism of Infants be not universally practiced in all ages,
Animadver.
when so many Sects under one notion or another, more or less stuck at it;
First Arrians in one age; after that the Pelagians in another; after them
Arminius; then the Anabaptists in Luthers time; then the Anabaptists in
Ainsworths time; and now the Anabaptists in our times. Shall these men make a
practice, and then make of it an argument for themselves? who will be swayed
with such an argument as that? They should make out their practice from an
argument, and not make an argument of their practice.

2 Mr T. does not here so much as say that Helena was a Christian at
Constantines birth, or that Monica was a Christian at Augustines birth, which
to have cleared was necessary to the argument.

3 Who does not know, that histories make mention of Helena as of a very weak
and wonderful (I had almost said) superstitious Christian, Socrat. schol.
Ecles. hist. lib. 1. chap. 13. according to the English trans.
in digging for the cross of Christ at Jerusalem, and finding three, to wit
those two also on which the thieves were crucified on: and being perplexed
which was Christ's, a miracle of curing a dying woman with that which was
Christ's, resolved which was his; and so she locked up some of it in a silver
chest, and the rest was set up upon a pillar in the market place at
Constantinople so called of Constantine for the preservation of that City. As
also that she finding the nails that fastened Christ to the Cross, she sent
them to her son Constantine the Emperor, whereof he caused bittes for
bridles, helmets, and headpeece to be made, which he wore in battle. So
Socrate Eccles. You see how vain a story here is. And that all the
Christianity by this appearing in Helena, relates to the time of her son
Constantines being Emperor. And therefore what Mr T. can make of it to his
purpose I know not.

4. At this time of Constantines birth were great persecutions risen now almost
toward the highest; it cost after that Constantine many a battle before he
could quiet things, and therefore Helena the Emperesse, the wife of Constantius
the Emperor (Religion then daring little to peep forth; more then in
notorious suffering for it) might well be afraid (if she were then a
Christian) to do such an act as to carry her son to Baptism, as Ministers
might be afraid to do it, Constantius the father not being a Christian, though
politically moderate.

5. For Augustine. 1. It is clear out of Aug. Confessions The first Book, and
11. Chap. that his father was not a believer at his birth, nor when he was
grown up to be a little boy of some understanding. For he says there in the
description of himself while he was Puer a little boy, or lad. Ita jam
credebam, et illa et omnis domus, nisi pater solus etc. So I and my mother and
all the family did now believe, except my father only, who notwithstanding did
not control my mothers power over me, whereby I should not believe in Christ.
For she rather endeavored, that thou O my God should be my father, rather
then he; so Augustine. Now the want of the fathers concurrence in carrying a
child to baptism in those difficult times, might be some delay of that
Sacrament. For secondly, We say persecution was walking among Christians about
that time, for Augustine in his third Book chap. 25. Contra literas Petiliani
says that after the death of the great Tyrant he went into Africa. Intimating
also that his mother lived a very private life, his father being then dead.
Thirdly, Augustine tell us in his first book of confessions and 11. chap. That
Cum puer One is said to begin to be a Puer from (...) 4 year old and so upward
to 14.
essem, et quodam die pressus stomachi dolor etc. When I was a little boy, or
lad, being a certain day oppressed in my stomach, and sick even to death,
thou O God saw, because thou art my keeper, with what motion of mind, and
with what faith I earnestly desired from the piety of my mother and of thy
Church the mother of us all, the Baptism of thy Christ, and of God my Lord.
And the mother of my flesh was much troubled, etc. and earnestly hasty that I
should be initiated and washed with the saving Sacrament etc. But being now
refreshed that my purifying was delayed. And Augustine tells us the reason in
many words; the effect in short was this. That his friends thought that more
indulgence was to be allowed to let him have his will to do what he listed,
being yet weak, and not fully recovered; then was fi^ to be permitted in case
h^ had bin Baptized. Which thing Augustine there bewa^^es in these words, my
Baptism was delayed, as if it had been necessary I should be more defiled, it
I would live. It founded in my ears from these and those, let him alone to do
what he will, for he is not yet Baptized. And yet of the health of the body we
say not, let him be wounded more, for he is not yet healed. Fourthly, when he
was Post pueritiam, past the age of childhood or of a little boy, or lad, many
and great waves of temptation hung over him. So in the same book and chap* of
his Confessions.
And though in his childhood or lad-ship, he loved not his learning, and hated
to be urged to it, yet there was less fear of him then then when he was a
youth In adolescentia.
So in the 12. chap. of that first book of his Confessions, Fifthly, After
this, before his Baptism (which was about the 34. year of his age as we
showed before) he ran into blasphemous errors, in so much as his mother would
not admit him to her table, so he confesses in his third book of Confessions
Chap. 11. And thus you see the life of Augustine, and the causes of the delay
of his Baptism, sure enough the delay of his and Constantines baptism was not
from the custom of the Churches as we have before prooved. From a non-fact, to
a non-equity is no consequence, though they were not Baptized young, yet they
ought.

But Mr. T. Exercitat.. 17.
gives other instances for his particulars in his minor, of Theodosius,
Alipius, Adeodatus that were not baptized in their childhood; and so Infants
baptism was not Universally practiced in those times.

1. Touching Alipius and Adeodatus we have answered before. Animadver.
That of Alipius is very doubtful whether he were of Religious Parents; the
contrary being more probable, by some passages out of Augustine we have there
quoted. And it is doubtful of Adeodatus whether he were baptized at 15. years
old as was alleged. 2. Touching Theodosius the Great (for that is the man I
suppose Mr T. means) it is true that both Pezelius, and Socrates Scholasticus
do tell us that he was baptized at man's estate, but they do not make out that
which is deficient in Mr T. his assertion, namely whether his Parents, or
either of them were Christians when he was an infant. It is true that they say
he was formerly trained up in Christianity. But by the story it seems to me,
that Religion did not so cease upon his spirit, or that he did so declare
himself against Arrianisme and for the Orthodox Religion and faith till he
fell sick a little before his baptism. For the naked story in short is this.
His Colleagues Valentinian the second, his assistant in many batles, and Gratian
(who was Partner with Theodosius in a victory against the Barbarians) being
dead, Theodosius succeeded them in the Empire. By stock a Spaniard, his descent
from Trajan; he had been formerly trained up in Christianity. After the
aforesaid battles, he fell ill, and lay sore sick at Thessalonica, in which
time he desired to be baptized. Sent for Anatolius alias Ascholius the Bishop
of that Church; asked him whether it was lawful for him to be baptized of an
Heretical Bishop? The Bishop answering that for his part he detested the
opinion of Arius, that he embraced the faith delivered by the Apostles, and set
forth in the Nicen Creed by the Council of Nice, he was presently baptized by
him. Then wrote Theodosius to the people of Constantinople, that he was
addicted to the Orthodox Religion and exhorted them to constantly embrace the
Orthodox faith. Thus the story. Now what inferences Mr T. can justly make hence
for a consult delay of Theodosius his baptism, by his Christian friends I know
not. This hence only appears to me, that seeing we cannot learn neither how
good his Parents were at his baptism, though great, in his infancy (and who
shall meddle with great men's children in point of Sacraments without their
consent?); nor how long or how much his education in Christianity had been in
his youth (it being unlikely that forwardness in Religion would forward them
to be elected Emperors in those generally troublesome and Hethenish times) nor
what leisure he had seriously to think of Religion and worship in his young
manhood, the Empire then being full of wars against the Goths, Hunnes, and
Alanes etc. That that was the only fit time to baptize him when he was
baptized. Now his sickness made his soul well. Now he had leisure to think
of Religion for his own soul; now he is hungry for baptism, now he regarded
of what faith Ministers were; now being Emperor and baptized, he declares
himself in writing what he was in Religion, and in opinion.

Therefore for Mr T. to infer from the Contingency of Theodosius his baptism
at ripe year, to a Necessity that the Churches then thought, so baptism ought
to be administered, is a consequence which I never found in my Logic. And if
This Theodosius was about the year 401. after Christ as the Eccles. Chrono. at
the end of Eusebius. tells us Others put him higher.
then all those Godly learned Ancients before alleged for infant baptism,
from Justin Martyr to Augustine had declared their judgments to the world for
the same, as the Tenet and Practice of the Churches in all age of the New
Testament. And therefore Theodosius, and the other few instances Mr T. has
given of adult baptism at ripe years, were rather beside, then according to
the general Tenet or Practice of the Churches anciently and downward: which
do no more infringe the generalily of the Tenet and Practice of Infant
baptism, then the hills and vallyes do the roundnesse of the world's which by
the Moon we can see keeps its exact rotundity. The Moon light of antiquity
can show us that the generality of Infant baptism has been all along so
uniuersally held and practiced, that it swallows up a small handful of
instances of the other practice.

Mr T. his fourth particular of his Minor, Exercitat. Sect. 17.
of his fifth argument against infant Baptism, is That together with it, went
along the error of giving the Lords supper to Infants, as is manifest out of
the book of Cyprian de lapsis, and others.

In our answer to this: 1. Let us consider the proof. 2. What connection and
inference it has to make an Argument
1. For the proof, And first for that Mr T. does but intimate in the words,
[and others.] It is true that in the eighth Sermon upon the Words of the
Apostle [This a true saying and worthy of all acceptance, etc.] put among
Augustines works in the tenth Tome, are these Expressions, Infantes sunt, etc.
That is, They are Infants, but they are Christ's Members: they are Infants, but
they receive his Sacraments: they are Infants, but they are made partakers of
his table that they may have life in themselves. But Censura patrum.
Rob. Cook, Cens. tom. 10.
Erasmus, and they that put forth the Lovaine Edition, In that Edition
Augustine name is not praefixed.
do doubt whether the 2.4. 6.8. Sermon with many more of them there on the said
words of the Apostles be Augustines or no. Secondly for that proof, Mr T,
expresses the first part of it is here, out of Cyprian de lapsis, quoted by
August. in Epist. 33. the second part is in his Examen, out of Augustine in his
1 book of merit, and remission of sin, chap. 20. on the words, John 6.53. and
Maldonat on John 6. who confesses that Innocentius the first, Bishop of Rome
held it necessary for Infants; and that this opinion and practice continued
about 600 years in the Church, though it be now rejected by the R. Church in
the Council of Trent. Thus Mr T. Now we answer to these things in the General
thus: 1. That here is produced only matter of fact, but no rule, so much as
pretended out of any Scripture, Council, or any Father for it, by those that
used it. 2. That this fact was for about 150 years, From Cyprian till
Augustine, very rare; As before Cyprian, Helvie.
from whom up to the last of the Apostles are near 140 years, I find no
mention of it at all in the best antiquity.


And for this reason it was rarely used, because the Ancients upon Scriptures
swaying them, were all along so confident as we have heard that baptism alone,
was as Ordinance fully sufficient to assure them of the salvation of Infants,
which caused the universality of practice of Infant Baptism, all along in
those times. In particular. 1. To Cyprian we say, if this place be not
interlined and corrupted, with patches by others inserted, as those books that
are altogether accounted Cyprians are So Revet. Perkins, Cook. Possevin.
and if in this silly story of a phantisied miracle, unworthy of learned pious
Cyprian, The story in a word is; That a maiden Infant being made by the Idol
worshippers to suck in a little of a bit of bread sopped in wine, left by them
that had there sacrificed; she being after brought by her mother to the
communion, the Deacon forcing into the Infant some of the Sacramental wine,
she presently vomitted, etc. which is taken as a miracle to discover the sin,
before unknown, of her partaking of the Idol-sop. Popish Pamelius indeed huggs
this story to prove miracles since the Apostles, and transubstantaition. But
for Protestants, they maybe rather ashamed of it, then own it.
this wine were given to the child not as aliment, but as a Sacrament, why was
not the Sacramental bread given to it too? And if it could not suck down a
crumme of that bread, as it is said, they gave it the idol-sop, because it
could not suck upon the flesh; how is it said to receive the Lords Supper? For
it is said by the Apostle, The bread that we break is the Communion of the body
of Christ. We leave this uncertain, and simple Testimony of Infant Commuuion,
in Cyprians time. Let us come secondly to Augustine: letting pass his
weakness in too credulous quoting that weak passage in Cyprian, his rash
asserting that the child received the Lords Supper, and his in considerate
application of it to warn persons of ripe years of unworthy communicating;
whereas more fitly he might have inferred, that it showed what a sinful
human invention it was to force the wine of the Sacrament into an Infant: I
say, letting pass these things in his 23. Ep. Let us consider what is
alleged out of him, In his book of the merit and remission of sins, Chap.
20. upon occasion of his alleging John 6. To which we say. 1. That Augustiue
does not speak of Infants receiving the Communion as the common Tenet of those
times. 2. He brings in some disputing against him, that that place of John
6.53. does not belong to Infants. 3. When Augustne weakly endeavors to pull
that text to reach to Infants, from the verb plural, unless yes shall eat; and
that it must belong to children too, or else to those only whom Christ there
speaks, and not to us also in following ages etc. In the conclusion he says
only this; That flesh which was given or the life of the world, was given for
the life of, LITTLE ONES, and if they SHALL not eat the flesh of the son of
man, nor SHALL they have life, speaking in the future tence, or time. As for
Maldonat that Popish Calumniator, I think it nor worth while to turn to him,
if I had him; or to believe him if I read him. If Innocentius the 1. Bishop of
Rome so thought and said, its wonder there were no letters, or Epistles between
him and his Coeve friend Augustine, concerning this point too; And that
Boniface succeeding Innocent, and was also in Augustines time, did not mind
Augustine of it, nor Augustine allege Innocent to Boniface in his 23. Ep. to
Boniface; Augustine touching upon this very point and alleging Cyprian for
it, in that Epistle. Howsoever if the 600. years of that opinion and practice
were those next before the Council of Trent, th^n the opinion and practice was
rare and private in Cyprian and Augustines time, if the 600. years must begin
at Cyprian, ye a or at Augustine, and his Coeve Innocentius; how is it averred
that the Council of Trent first rejected it? Sure it was a gross thing in the
opinion of all Orthodox Churches, that the Council of Trent must reform. Thus
of Mr T. his proof that the error of Infant cummunicating, went along with
Infant Baptism. Now according to promise, a word of the connection and
inference to make it an argument, 1. We have proved Infant baptism to be no
error, therefore it cannot beget an error in the Administration of the Holy
Supper. 2. The adjunct or companion cannot necessarily argue the badnesse of
the subject or thing. The Sun shineing, many men commit evil yet this does
not prove the badnesse of the Sunshine. 3. The Sacraments are two things
specifically different, distanced by express rules, that only self examiners
may Communicate; its not said so of baptism; therefore they that give the
Communion to Infants err for want of eyes, not for want of light,
distinguishing between Sacraments. 4. Many errors for many hundreds of years
clave to most ordinances, as to Preaching, Praying, Sacraments, Fasting,
Thanksgivings, yet we leaving the error, doubt not of the Institutions, and
Administrations of those ordinances according thereunto. 5. Mr T. thinks that
Adult-baptisme might be severed from (to use his own words Exercitat.. 17. p.
29. l. 13.
The pernicious errors, and madd furies of FORMER Anabaptists: Therefore might
infant baptism be severed from some errors that have accompanied it. 6. If the
errors accompanying Infant Baptism have made it doubtful to Mr T. So have the
pernicious errors and madd furies of the Anabaptists in former ages which Mr T.
has confessed made their baptism doubtful to us.


Mr T. adds in his 17. Exercitat.. 17.
Sect of his Exercitation toward the close of his 5. argument, That of old 1.
Other inventions of men under the name of Apostolical Tradition. Caused or
attended Infant Baptism, rather then any solid argument from Scripture. 2. A
wrong likeing of Judaisme. Caused or attended Infant Baptism, rather then any
solid argument from Scripture. 3. The using of it as a main Argument against
the Pelagian Heresy. Caused or attended Infant Baptism, rather then any solid
argument from Scripture. 4. The mere authority of the Councills under Cyprian,
the Council of Milevis, Augustine, and Jerome. Caused or attended
Infant Baptism, rather then any solid argument from Scripture.


To the 1. We shall answer in Mr T. his next Argument (in number the 6.) which
is touching humane inventions. 2. We have answered already, indiscussing of the
aforesaid antiquities. 3. We say now; that we have produced sufficient proof
before out of approved antiquity; that the Tenet and practice of Infant
baptism, was common in the Churches since the Apostles times, hundreds of
years before Pelagianisme was known in the world. See before all our 13. Chap.
and Chap. 14. from the beginning thereof, to the end of the quotation of
Ambrose, p. 148. 4. We have answered before. chap. 14.


Lastly, Mr T. adds these words as the close of his fifth Argument, and
Section of his Exercit. Exercita^.. 17.
So in this last age (says he) some modern men seem to embrace this tenet of
Infant baptism out of horror of mind, least they should go headlong into the
PERNICIOVS ERRORS of former Anabaptists, and their MADD FVRIES, or 2 least they
should seem to desert the leading men of the Reformed Churches, or 3 move
troubles in the Churches; rather then from perspicuous foundation in the
Scriptures. Which they will think that I have not said as one that dreams, who
shall read what Robert Lord Brook has in the end of his Treatise concerning
Episcopacie, Daniel Rogers in his treatise of Baptism and others elsewhere.

We answer: to the 1 particular thus. That the modern men cannot be justly
abhorred, Animadver.
for their horror of mind, least they should by any Tenet fall headlong into
pernicious errors and madd furies. And if Mr T. does but approve his own
seventh Argument for a right rule viz. That which has occasioned many errors,
that is deservedly doubtful whether it be right etc.] then it will follow
uncontradicted by Mr T. That as he doubts of Infant Baptism, because of errors
that have followed it; so we doubt of adult baptism according to the Tenet and
Practice of the Anabaptists, because of the pernicious errors, and madd furies
that have followed it. We shall give instances anon in the due place, in answer
to Mr. T. his 6 7.8.9. Argument in our 13. chap.
To the second particular we answer thus. That it is not so convenient suddenly
to desert the leading men of reformation, then in their debates before they
have declared themselves, and we mean while not engaged necessarily to
practice against our consciences; and in such points, as will no ways stand in
the line of any concord so much as negatively. The Church way or Independency
(as they nick name it) differs from the intended Presbytery (as we guess)
^n^ainly in point of Appeal, especially in the manner of it; which may breed
no distraction in case particular Churches walk so wisely as not to need
appeals; as some discreet parishes did in the worset times of Episcopal
Courts. Rests in a song whereby to sing only when the concords will bear it,
and rest where not, till they Symphonise again do not mar, but grace the
harmony. But whether Anabaptisme, or Catapaedobaptisme, denying Baptism to
believers infants, wherein the great part of a sad distracted kingdom is
interested, will for the present so well fagge, I leave to Mr T. to make out,
which if he can, it shall not be a sorrow to me. We are unwilling indeed, to
admit those beleivers to the Communion of the Lords Supper, that will not some
how intimate to us that they yield to a relation of Pastor and Flock,
between them and that Minister of whom they require that Ordinance, and to
walk with us submissively to all the Ordinances of Christ (till God provide
better for them) that we may know how they live, as well as when they receive,
and be willing also to receive Christian admonition, where they live amiss.
But for baptizing of beleivers Infants, several Churches of us do hold, that
we may Baptize them, though neither of those Parents be of our particular
Churches. Baptism, as we Conceive, being but an admission into the universal
visible Church; As those Baptized, Matthew the 3. The Centurion Act. 10. The
Jailer Act. 16; were Baptized, neither in a particular Christian Church, nor
into such a particular Church. To the third particular we answer. That it
cannot but be a considerable thing to godly and wise men how they move troubles
in the Church. And therefore in capi^ulating as I may say with point of
Argument for reformation they think it not seasonable to indeavoure for the
inward Hold, till they can take the out-workes. Reformation from Adams fall, to
the highest pitch in the old Testament, came on by degrees; so from John
Baptists time to the end of the Apostles, in the New Testament. And so in
every Kingdom since from the first sitting down of Religion there, to its
grouth; or from the Lapse thereof, to its Restitution. We cannot come to the
end but by means. And it cannot but be dangerous in an unwildy Kingdom to
jumpe from the lesser to the greatest things of that we count Reformation at
one leap. For my part, I should desire rather to suspend mine own interest
then to be a co^djutor to further a general dangerous distraction.

For that clause [that infant baptism has been held rather upon the said
three particulars, then upon any Perspicuous ground of Scripture] we anser; we
have held it upon sufficient grounds of Scripture (if our Animadversions may be
counted worthy to be one witness). But if Mr T. mean by Perspicuous any thing
more then sufficient, we answer we conceive we have as Perspicuous Scriptures
for Infant Baptism as Mr T. has for The Lords day, and for women's partaking
of the Lords Supper.

To Master T. his allegation of the Lord Brooks, and Daniel Rogers, that Mr T.
did not dream. We say that it is possible two more, may dream as well as Mr.
T. we say two more; for to his [etc.] And others elsewhere, we can distinctly
answer nothing, where nothing is alleged. But for the two particularly
named, giving their books all due respect. Robert Lord Brooks of Episcopacy.
Sect. 2. chap. 7 p. 96. of 2. edit.
1. The bare recital of the Lord Brooks words are a full answer, which are
these.

I will not, I cannot, take on me to defend That men usually call Anabaptisme:
Yet I conceive that Sect is Twofold: Some of them hold Free Will; Community of
all things; deny Magistracy; and refuse to Baptize their Children. These truly
are such Heretics (or Atheists,) that I question whether any Divine should
honor them so much as to dispute with them; much rather sure should Alexanders
sword determine here, as of old at the Gordian knot, where it acquired this
Motto, Q^ae soivere non possum, dissecabo, What I cannot unty, I will cut
asunder.

There is another fort of them, who only deny Baptism to their Children, till
they come to years of discretion, and then they baptize them; but in other
things they agree with the Church of England.

Truly, These men are much to be pitied; And I could heartily wish, That before
they be stigmatized with that opprobrious brand of Schismatic, the Truth might
be cleared to them. For I conceive, to those that hold we may go no farther
than Scripture, for Doctrine or Discipline, it may be very easy to err in
this Point now in hand; since the Scripture seems not to have clearly
determined This particular.

The Anaglogy which Baptism now has with Circumcision in the old Law, is a
fine Rhetorical Argument, to illustrate a Point well proved before; but I
somewhat doubt, whether it be proof enough, for that which some would prove by
it: since (beside the vast difference in the Ordinances,) the persons to be
Circumcised are stated by a positive Law, so express, that it leaves no place
for scruple: but it is far otherwise in Baptism; Where all the designation
of Persons fit to be partakers, for ought I know, is only, Such as believe. For
this is the qualification that, with exactest search, I find the Scripture
requires in persons to be baptized: And This it seems to require in All such
persons. Now, how Infants can be properly said to believe, I am not yet fully
resolved.

Yet many things prevail very much with me in this point.

First, For ought I could ever learn, It was the constant custom of the
purest and most Primitive Church, to baptize Infants of believing Parents; For
I could never find the beginning and first Rise of this practice: Whereas it is
very easy to tracke Heresies to their first Rising up, and setting foot in the
Church.

Again, I find all Churches (even the most strict) have generally been of
this judgment and practice: yea though there have been in all ages some, that
much affected novelty, and had parts enough to discuss and clear what they
thought good to preach; yet was this scarce ever questioned by men of Note,
till within these Last Ages. And sure, the constant judgment of the Churches
of Christ, is much to be honored, and heard in all things that contradict not
Scripture.

Nor can I well clear that of Saint Paul (1 Cor. 7.14.) Else were your
Children Unclean, but now are they Holy. I know some interpret it thus, If it
be unlawful for a believer to live in wedlock with one that believes not;
Then have many of you lived a long time in unlawful marriage; and so your very
Children must be Illegitimate, and These also must be cast off (as Base borne:)
But it is not so; for, Your Children are Holy; that is, Legitimate.

I confess, This seems a very fair Interpretation; yet I much question,
Whether This be all the Apostle means by that phrase Holy; especially when I
reflect on the preceding words, The Unbeliever is Sanctified by the believer.
Nor yet can I believe any Inherent Holiness is here meant; but rather That
Relative Church-Holinesse, which makes a man capable of admission to Holy
Ordinances, and so to Baptism.

Thus far the Lord Brooks, where he is against Master Tombs touching the
meaning of 1 Cor. 7.14. And touching Infant Baptism. But the question is
whether Master Tombs be not more then a Catapaedobaptist, namely an
Anabaptist, for Rebaptizing; who so reads the last page of his exercitation,
will not think that I merely dream. For there he says [Nor is the assuming
of Baptism in ripe years, by those who were washed in Infancy, a renoucing of
Baptism, as some in their gross ignorance conc^it.]

2. For Master Rogers (not daring to play the Astrologer, to tell what
influence Episcopal wandering Stars might have upon his Book Printed in the
year 1635. having been once Printed before; but esteeming the man) I dare set
down his words also as a full answer to Master Tombs; his words are these.

The fourth and chief person, yea equal object of Baptism, is the party
baptized. The fourth person, the infant.
For not only the Church may and does baptize her Infants: but also (adultos)
grown ones also, if any such being bred Pagans, and brought within the pale of
the Church, shall testify their competent understanding of the new covenant;
and profess their desire to be sealed with Baptism, for the strengthening of
their soul in the faith thereof: profess it I say, not basely and slightly,
but with earnestness and entirenesse; cutting off their hair and nails, and
abhorring their Paganism. But the truth is, the exercise of the Churches
baptism is upon infants: Here the Anabaptists rise up, A short touch of the
baptism of infants.
pleading the corruption of such baptism, and urging the first baptism of
catechized ones and confessors of sin, and cravers of the seal, upon the
work of the Ministry foregoing in knowledge and faith, which can be incident
only to adulti, or grown ones. They allege that we seal to a blank, to no
covenant, and therefore it is a nullity. Sundry learned men have undertaken to
stop their schismatical mouths and to answer their peevish Arguments: my scope
tends another way in this Treatise, so far as my digression may be venial. I
say this, for the settling of such as are not wilful, that I take the baptism
of Infants to be one of the most reverend, general, and uncontrouled
traditions which the Church has, and which I would no less doubt of than the
Creed to be Apostolical. And although I confess my self yet unconvinced by
demonstration of Scripture for it, yet. Reasons for it.


First, Sithence Circumcision was applied to the infant the

Secondly, there is no word in the New Testament to infringe

Thirdly, sundry Scriptures afford some friendly proofs by consequence

Fourthly, the holiness of the child, (external and visible)

Howbeit here a further quaerie arises. And because the Sacrament of Baptism
is here handled by us, Question. How it is capable. 1 Pet. 3.21.
not a half a Sacrament, (only including a washing of the flesh) but an
entire Sacrament, holding out and giving an invisible grace by out-ward means:
By what authority shall we say, an Infant may be presented to that, whereof it
is not capable?

To that I answer:

Secondly, although the child be not capable of the grace of the Sacrament by
that way, whereby the grown are, by hearing, conceiving, and believing: yet
this follows not, that Infants are not capable of Sacramental grace in and by
another way. Pitiful are the shifts of them that have no other way to stop
an Anabaptists mouth, save by an error, that an Infant may have faith. It Is
easy to distinguish between the gift conveyed, and the manner of conveying it.
For if the former be, the latter in such case will prove needless. But if the
infant be truly susceptive of the substance of Christ, none can deny it the
Sacrament.

Now to understand this, mark, that Infants borne of believing parents, are of
the number of those that shall be saved (though dying in their Infancy) none of
our reformed Churches will deny. It is enough therefore that such before death
do partake the benefit of Election in Christ, together with the benefits of
Christ in regeneration, adoption, redemption and glory; Now that the Spirit can
apply these unto such Infants, is not doubted of: Though the manner thereof to
us be as a hidden and mystical thing: yet so it is, the Spirit of Christ can
as really unite the soul of an Infant to God, imprint upon it the true title of
a son and daughter by adoption, and the image of God by sanctification
without faith, as with it. Now, if the grace it self of Bap^^sme be thus given
it, why not Baptism? Nay, I add further, I see no cause to deny, that even in,
and at, and by the act of Baptism, (as the necessity of the weak infant may
admit) the Spirit may imprint these upon the soul of the Infant.

Thus Master Rogers. Where, by his quotation of Scriptures and discuss^ of
arguments you may see what he meant by Apost^licall tradition.

CHAP. XV.
Exercitat. Argu. 6.. 19. The argument against Infant Baptism, from humane
inventions occasioned by it confirmed.
THe sixth Argument follows:

That which has occasioned many humane inventions, partly by which
Infant Baptism it self may be under-propped, partly the defect in the policy
of the Church, which in very deed is to be supplied by the lawful use of
Baptism, Of that it is deservedly doubtful whether it be not in it self
weak and insufficient for its proper work.

But the matter is so in the business of Infant Baptism,

Ergo.

The Minor is proved by instances: they are,

1. The use of suerties in Baptism, which is an humane invention, for a
shadowy supplement, and I had almost said sporting, of that prof^ssion of faith
which at first was made by the baptized in his own person.

2. Episcopal confirmation, in which the Bishop lays hands or anoints the
Catechized, that Baptism, or the Baptized may be confirmed, and they made
capable of the Lords Supper.

3. The reformed union, by ex^mination, confession, subscriptition, of the
received doctrine in the Church, before the communion of the Eucharist, of
which Parker of Eccles. policy. l. 3. c. 16.

4. The Church Covenant, as they call it, before the admission of members into
Church Fellowship, of which the New England Elders in the little book in
English, called Church Covenant, which in very deed are devised to supply the
place of Baptism; for by Baptism, according to Christ's institution, a person
is exhibited a member of Christ and the Church, 1 Cor. 12.13. Gal. 3.27. Ephesians.
4.5.

THe seventh Argument: 20. The argument against Infant Baptism, from the
Errors occasioned by it, confirmed.


That which has occasioned many errors, that is deservedly doubtful, whether
it be right.

But the practice of Infant Baptism has occasioned either the birth or
fostering of many errors.

Ergo.

It is proved by instances: 1. That Baptism conferres grace by the work done.
2. That Baptism is Regeneration. 3. That Infants dying, are saved by the faith
of their Parents, faith of Sureties, of the Church receiving into her lap:
which is to be ascribed alone to the grace of God by Christ. 4. That some
regenerate persons may utterly fall from grace.


THe eight Argument.

That which has caused many abuses and faults in Discipline,. 22. The argument
against Infant Baptism, from many abuses caused by it confirmed.
and Divine worship, and Conversation of men, that is deservedly doubtful.

But Infant Baptism is such.

Ergo.

It is proved by enumeration.

1. Private baptism. 2. Baptism by women. 3. Baptism of Infants not yet
brought into light. 4. Baptism of Infants of uncertain progeny, whom we call
children of the earth and world. 5. They are baptized in the name of the Lord,
who know not the Lord, nor have ever consented, or perhaps will consent to the
confession of the name of our Lord. 6. It has brought in the admission of
ignorance and profane men into the communion of the Church, and to the Lords
Supper: for who can deny rightly, the right of the Church to the baptized? 7 It
perverts the order of discipline, that first a man be baptized, and after among
the catechized. 8 The Sacrament of baptism is turned into a mere Ceremony, yea
into a profane meeting to feast together. 9 Men forget Baptism, as if they
were never baptized so that it has the force of a carnal rite, not of a
spiritual Institution. 10 It takes away, or at least diminishes zeal, and
industry in knowing the Gospel.
THe ninth Argument.

That is deservedly doubtful, 22. The argument from unnecessary disputes
caused by it against Infant Baptism, confirmed.
that yields occasion to many unnecessary disputes, fostering only
contention, and which cannot be determined by any certain rule.

But the tenet or rite of Infant Baptism is such,

Ergo.

It is proved by instances.

1 Of baptizing the Infants of Excommunicated persons, 2 Of baptizing the
Infants of Apostates, 3 Of baptizing the Infants of such Parents as are not
members in a gathered Church. 4 Of baptizing the Infants of those, whose
Ancestors were believers, the next Parents remaining in unbelief; These things
show that men have departed from the Rule, when they know not where to stay.
THese four Arguments of M. T. to wit, the 6, 7, 8, 9. I have put together,
being much alike for notion and validity, Animad.
and so apt to receive one and the same general Answer by way of retorsion,
thereby to discover their weakness. The sum of them is this.

That which has occasioned many human-inventions, Errors, faults in
Discipline, and unnecessary disputes, is doubtful.

But the tenet and practice of Infant Baptism has occasioned all these.

Therefore the tenet and practice of Infant Baptism is uncertain.

We retor^. That which has occasioned many human-inventions, Errors, faults
in Discipl^ne, and unnecessary disputes is doubtful.

But the tenet and practice of adult Baptism, as held and used among the
Anabaptists has occasioned all these.

Therefore the tenet and practice of adult Baptism as among them, is doubtful.

The particulars to be made good in the minor, are four:

That 1 Humane Inventions, 2 Error, 3 Faith in Discipline, 4 Unnecessary
disputes,
Have been occasion by the adult baptism of the Anabaptists.

These four I shall make good, not by bare asserting or torturing of Authors
(of one of which M. T. is somewhat guilty, in most of the particulars he has
produced in the said four Arguments) but by plain allegation of approved
Authors. And this I shall do as forced thereunto now at last by M. T. in these
his strange kinds of arguments, which I have forborne all this while, though
often incited thereunto by M. T. before in his Exercitation and that of his
Examen. But now we must by this course, take off that aspersion laid peculiarly
on us for baptising believers infants in a conscientious way. So that we
intend in this our answer, rather to be defensive then offensive.

1 Humane inventions have been oc^asioned by the adult baptisime of the
Anabaptists.

1 We are informed from the third Council of Carthage, Bin. Ca. 34.
and and by M. T. his Walafridus, De rebus Eccles. cap. 26.
That sick men lying speechless might be baptized upon the witness of men
touching their former condition. By this is intimated that dipping was not in
this case used.

2 The fourth Council of Carthage Bin. Ca. 85.
tells us thus this, That those of ripe years to be baptized, must be dyetted
and kept from flesh and wine along time, and after that, having been examined
several times, they are to be baptized.

3 Epiphanius Epiphan. Anacephal. page 408. Edi^. Lat. Ba^il.
declares that the Eunomians (called in the margin Anabaptists) dore-baptise
all that come to them, yea, they re-baptise the Arians also (who deny Christ to
be God) and they rebaptise them (says Epiphanius) turning their heads
downward, and their heels upward.

4 Vossius Gerard. Ioh. Vossius de Anabaptismo These. 17.
take notice out of Epiphanius of this: We are not ignorant (says Vossius)
that the Hem^robaptists thought, that none could be saved unless they were
daily baptized (whence they were called (...) Daily-baptists) and so were
cleansed from their sins. But they were a sect of Jews, as we know out of
Epiphanius, the 17 Sect of the Jews.

5 The same Vossius Ge^. John Vossius de Anabap. These. 18.
assetts that the Marcionites did say (for which they had no reason) that
Baptism might be iterated, and Tertiated. That is repeated and done three
times.) I will bring you (says Vossius) a place out of Epiphanius against the
Marcionists Haeres. 42. When Marcion had in his own City defiled a virgin, and
fled, and was found in that great sin, the juggler invented to himself a
second laver, asserting that it is lawful to give remission of sins, unto the
number of three lavers, that is three baptismes, whereby if any one has
back-sliden after his first, having acted repentance, he might receive the
second, and likewise the third, if he be taken in a sin after the second. How
he proves this opinion, Epiphanius (says Vossius) subjoynes, viz. The first
baptism he collects, in that Christ was baptized by John. The second and
third, because Christ says, I have a BAPTISM to be baptized with, and what
will I if I have already finished it. Again, I have a cup to drink, and what
will I, if I shall now fulfill it. Both places (says Vossius) are taken out of
Marcion his Pseudo-Gospell (that is False Gospel.) To the first, there is
somewhat like Luke 12.50. To the second somewhat, Mat. 20 22, 23. But Christ
speaks there not of the baptism of water, but of the baptism of blood, that
is, of his passion, and death.

Suitable to this often baptising M. T. has two passages. The first In his
Exercit at. page the last. Nor is (says he) the assuming of baptism in ripe
years by those who were washed in infancy a renouncing of baptism, as some in
their gross ignorance conceit, but indeed a firmer avouching of baptism,
according to Christ's mind. The second is in his Examen Part 2, Sect. 4. M. T.
his note in the margin is OF REBATING. His words in his answer to Master
Marshall there, are these.

YOu go on, 4. Of re-baptizing.
Since that time multitudes in Germany have embraced his opinion, who because
they opposed paedobaptisme, were forced to reiterate their own baptism, and
thence were called Anaebaptists. Before I proceed, because it goes so current,
that rebaptization is not only an error, but also an heresy, let me beg of
you one good argument to prove it unlawful inse, or intrinsecally, I mean
without respect to scandal, or the like cause by accident, for a man that has
been baptized rightly, to be baptized again: One baptism Ephesians. 45. is not to
me all one as once baptizing, no more then one faith once beleiving. We are
regenerated by baptism, and a man is borne but once. But are we not borne a
gain by the Word, and must that be but once preached? Is not sin mortified,
the Church sanctified by baptism, and are not these often? And for example, if
there were as good for paedobaptisme, as that Act. 19.5, 6. for rebaptizing,
the controversy were at an end with me. But if heresy must be determined by
the votes of men, Smectymnuus may be judged an Arian, and the opposers of
Pasche Heretics: this by the way, though not besides the matter. So M. T.

6 Sch^mer Scham. Panstr. Tom 4. lib. 4. cap. 11. 24.
quotes out of several Authors with him in credit for that purpose; the wont
of some in old time to dip the party baptized, at ripe years, three times
immediately on after another at his baptism. He quotes out of some ancient
author, now known only by the false name of Areopagita, Chap. 2. These words.
Then he (the Minister) bids him (the baptized) renounce the Devil and cleave
to Christ, Anoint all thy body with Oil, (...) Then the chief Minister
baptizeth him (he means dippeth him) three times, and at every dipping of him
down, and pulling him up again, he calls upon the essence of the Godhead.
Likewise he quotes diverse other. Scham. Panstr. Tom. 4. lib. 5. cap. 3. 7. etc.
As the Apostolic Canons (as they are called) If the Bishop or Presbyter does
not make (...) three Baptismes (he means dippings) of one innitiating, etc. let
him be deposed. Zonaras (...): that is, Three immersions or dippings in our
innitiation, that is, in our Baptism. Gregory the first, Ep. 41. lib. 1.
Nosautem, etc. That is, That we dip three times, we signify the mystery of
Christ's burial three days.

I have given you a touch, being necessitated by M. T. but have no mind of my
self, therefore I rake no further into this dunghill, though I might find
abundance more of invention, Oil, Salt, etc.

Thus of human-inventions. Secondly, of Errors occasioned by, or waiting upon
Anabaptists adult baptism.

1 Let me tell you mine own experience, that some of them, and particularly M.
Ta. formerly a Preacher, and a considerable Scholar, having, as this week laid
down this position, that nothing may be admitted into the New Testament
worship, but upon an express command in the New Testament, the next week or
thereabout came to me, and told me, Now Sir, said he, I doubt of the Lords day.
And M. Tombs himself says he will suspend his judgment about the quot a
pars temporis, how often there should be a Sabbath day, etc, Examen. Sect. 8.
p. 28. l. 32. which in my opinion enervates all M. T. seems to speak for the
Lords day.

2 Epiphanius Epiphan. l. 6. Anaceph. p. 408 Edit. Lat. Basil.
relates that from Aetius a Deacon under George the Bishop of the Arians at
Alexandria, were the Actians, called also Anomaeans, that is unequal, of some
they are called Ennomians, from one Eunomius (the Disciple of Aetius) who is
yet alive. With these were Eudoxius Arianissans, that is, Eudoxius Arianizing,
but through fear of Constantine, he severed himself and only Aetius was
cast out or banished. But Eudoxius notwithstanding continued Arianizing, that
is to be, and act as an Arian (that denies Christ to be God) but not with
Aetius. These Anomaeans, and Aetians, poenitus ab alienant, do utterly alienate
or separate Christ and the holy Spirit from God, affirming him to be created.
And say there is no similitude between them. For they affirm God the Father by
Aristotelian and Geometrical syllogismes, and by this means Christ cannot be
of God. But the Eunomians so called from him, rebaptize all that come to them.
So Epiphanius. There are other most abominable things there mentioned by
Epiphamus, which I have no delight to once name.

3. Tertullian Tertul. contra Marcion.
tells us of the Marcionites that were so curious in baptizing those of ripe
years, that they would not baptize married persons, but single persons,
virgins, widows, and divorced persons.

4 Pontanus, Osiander, Bullinger, and M. Aynsworth, give us this list of the
errors of the Anabaptists.

1. That Christ did not assume his slesh and blood from the Virgin Mary. 2 That
Christ is not God, but endued with more gifts then other men. 3 That our
righteousness depends not on faith in Christ, but upon the works of charity
and affliction. 4 That there is no original sin. 5 That man has free will in
spiritual things.
5 John Cloppenburge In his Gangren of Anabaptisticall Theology, Professor of
Divity, at Franequer, Printed 1645.
gives us a great Catalogue of the Errors of the Anabaptists, to the number of
about 48.

1 That the true God is not called in Scripture, by names that signify his
eternal increated essence, and so are proper to him, but by names that
signify only Gods dominion or power, which names are common to Moses and
other Governors.

2 That there is not an immediate omnipresence of the divine essence, wherein
they hold, says J. Cloppenburge, with Socinus and Vorstius. And consequently
they deny one of the Attributes of God, namely his immensitie.

3 God did not in the Old Testament command any thing of the Jews, but
external acts, not reaching with his word, to the purification of the heart.
Nor did he make any promise of spiritual things in the Covenant in the Old
Testament. Nor ought we to interpret any of them but of temporal things. That
the old ministry of the Ceremonial Law was not instituted to convince
consciences of their spiritual uncleanness, and typically to seal the true
atonement or expiation.

4 That the Scripture does no where clearly testify, neither does it seem to
be according to such reason as is consentaneous to truth, that the souls of
believers going out of the body, are presently taken up to Christ their head to
partake of celestial joy. And Christians may state the Question, without any
damage to piety, that likewise the souls of the wicked after death, do not
immediately taste of the infernal torments in hell.

5 That John the baptist was not in the least, the Minister of the New
Testament, or Doctor and teacher of Evangelicall righteousness, but of legal.
Note then how fit John's Baptism is in the opinion of the Anabaptists, to be
the ground of their form and rule of baptism, which they so often allege.

6 That the one only per son of the Father was understood and acknowledged in
the Old Testament.

And thus John Cloppenburge D.D. and Professor at the University of Franequer,
goes through the body of Divinity, in public disputations, and quotes out of
the Anabaptists own writings the several dangerous errors they hold, against
the main heads of Religion, to the sum of about 48. But I delight to name no
more. But that M. T. by his impertinent, yet importunate way of disputation in
his later arguments, forced me to clear our selves, that we are not the only
originalists of by-opinions, and to discover the weakness of this way of
argument used by M. T. I had not mentioned any at all. Thus for error.

3 Some faults in Discipline have been occasioned by the way of baptism, among
the Anabaptists.

1 That a particular Church is constituted by Baptism, and formally united, So
Mr. K. In his Answer to Dr. B.
and M. T. in the close of his sixth argument Exercit. 19. By baptism (says
M. T.) a person is exhibited a member of Christ, and the Church. But what
Church does M. T. mean? If he means of the universal Church, I yield. That he
is exhibited a visible Christian. But if he means a member of any particular
rightly constituted Church, according to the platform of those in the New
Testament, and ancient antiquity, I altogether deny it for these reasons.

1 Those baptized Mat. 3. were in no particular Christian Church, there being
none gathered till a good while after that Christ had given the holy Supper to
the Disciples. 2 Cornelius his, and the Gaolers families, after the gathering
of Churches, were not by that numbered to any particular Churches or thereby
made particular Churches, that we read. Now that which exists before or after a
thing without that thing, cannot be the form of that thing. 3 That which is
common, cannot be proper and peculiar. But baptism is common to make men only
visible Christians in general. Therefore it is not proper and peculiar to make
them of this or that particular Church. And therefore though godly men, or
their infants have been baptized, yet the Churches think according to
Scripture, that there must be somewhat more expressed to make such to own this
or that preaching officer to be their pastor or teacher, whom they must obey in
the Lord, and have in singular respect for the works sake. Heb. 13. And to
cause that Minister to own them as his flock, Act. 20. if he mean not to take
upon him a power Apostolical for latitude to extend to all baptized ones. Nor
can it be pretended that this Minister baptizing them, does make them of his
congregation, because the Confession of the Anabaptists Their confession of
faith Artic. 41.
set forth by the seven brethren of their fraternities, say That any preaching
Disciples, that are no particular Church Officers, or persons extraordinarily
sent, but as considered Disciples, are designed by Christ to dispense this
Ordinance.

Which we look upon us as a second fault in discipline following upon the
Anabaptists Baptism. For we find not that any baptized others, but either they
were extraordinary Officer, as the Apostles, or Evangelists. Or else particular
Churches Pastors, or Teachers. Nor is there any thing in the Scriptures
alleged in their Confession but to the same purpose we speak. Divine reason
also concurs with us. For a Disciple, as a Disciple, is only a member of the
universal visible Church. And so he can confer nothing but what he has.
And so bring his brother no further in subjection to Church Ordinances, than
are administered by the universal visible Church; and so can never be censured,
^in case of lapse, unless the universal visible Church concur, which can
never be. And so Church discipline falls to the ground.

3 Anabaptists have in many ages admitted generally all that will take up their
baptism, Epiphan. Anaceph. p. 408. E dit. Lat. Basil.
Epiphanius shows us in the fore quoted place, That they affirm that for a man
to stray in some great sin is nothing. God required nothing but that he should
be of their faith. Augustine in his fourth book against the Donatists
complains, and quotes Cyprian as condoling the same. That many Cord in melius
non mutato etc. That many being not changed in heart, that renounce the world
in words, not in deeds, were baptized. And in another place speaks of it as an
error of some in those times. Errant qui p^aeter delectum omnes ad baptismum
admittunt. They err (says Augustine) that admit all to baptism, without any
choice, or difference. And one of the late Anabaptists in a book called the
mark or character of the Beast, says, that any man upon confession of sin,
though he manifest no signs of grace, ought to be baptized. Thus of faults in
discipline.

4 By Anabaptisme have been occasioned many unnecessary disputes.

1 Whether the word (...) to baptize signifies to dip, to rantize, or to
sprinkle? whereas they baptized in old time, some in their beds, See before.
or couches, Clinidia.
therefore dipped not them. The baptismes of Tables, Mar. 7.4. here the word
cannot signify dipping. The Israelites are said to be baptized in the Cloud,
and the red Sea. But they were but sprinkled in the Cloud; and not dipped in
the Sea. 2 Whether those baptized by men erroneous in judgment, ought to be
rebaptized. Aug. against the Donatists? 3 Whether there be original sin in
infants? 4 Whether they have faith? 5 How long they must stay ere they be
baptized, Of these 3 last we heard before severally, upon other occasions.
whether till three years old or under, or till four years old or over? or how
long? whether till as old as Adeoda^us who was 15 at his baptism (as some
will) or till they be 30 years old, which was the age of Christ? As some
thought in Nazianzens time.
Thus I have given you a taste of the manner of M. T. his disputing in those
four Arguments, by an easier retorting them, If M. T. condemn these our
arguments retorted, of impertinencie or invalidity he must of necessity also
condemn his own. And for my part if he will do so, I am contented that these
four arguments on both sides should go for blank, and so to leave the dispute
where we found it, as no great matter being done on either side, to argue for
or against, by producing the errors and mistakes of men, which may be laid
aside on either side, and yet a truth be held by either. Though I do not
hereby mean to give away the Question of the lawfulness of baptizing believers
infants. And therefore we go on to give particular answers to M. T. his four
Arguments aforesaid.

CHAP. XVI.
TO M. T. his first particular, Exercitat. 19.
of Sureties in baptism, urged in the minor of his sixth Argument touching,
humane inventions occasioned by Infant Baptism.

We answer, Animad.
1 That sureties are known to have been in Tertullians time, and two hundred
years after in Augustines time; as we have touched in diverse quotations before.
Whence I infer only this, that the tenet and practice of Infant Baptism were
held in ancient times. 2 That by virtue of Abraham's power, and Guardianship
over his household all his male family had the first sign or seal.
As the family of Cornelius and the Jailer had, the Governors believing, and
being baptized. And usually those sureties that brought children to Baptism,
promised to see them brought up in the fear of God, or to that effect. Whence I
infer (though I am not in the least for sureties, only I would have M. T.
speak justly of things as they are) That the sporting of profession of faith
(which M. T. here abjects) was rather in the sureties that performed not that
they promised, then in thing it self.

To M. T. his second particular thence, Exercitat.
of Episcopal confirmation.

We answer: Animad.
that we have already declared much, of the Patriarchs imposition of hands; of
Christ's imposition of hands, of the Apostles imposition of hands, of Churches
imposition of hands since the Apostles, upon little ones, and usually after the
first seal. So that there is not so much human-invention in imposition of hands
on baptized persons, as there was arrogance in the Bishops, to assume this
peculiarly to themselves.

To M. T. his third particular there That the reformed union, Exercitat.
by examination, confession, and subscription of the received doctrine in the
Church, before the communion of the Eucharist, is an human-invention, following
upon Infant baptism.

We answer. Animad.
1 That M. T. all this while has contended that Examination and confession
before Baptism (and consequently before the Communion) is an ordinance of
Christ. How then says M. T. now, that they are human-inventions? 2 If
subscription be added. It is but a visible or legible profession, and not so
dangerous as Ministers subscriptions have been in the Prelates time, though some
have had the mercy, out of the University, to subscribe with their own
conditions. 3 That there is mention in Isay 44.5. That one shall call himself
by the name of Jacob, and another shall subscribe with his hand unto the Lord,
and surname himself by the name of Israel.
So that to subscribe to the truth of God, professed in a Church, to be called
a member of the same, is no such Scripture-lesse human invention as M. T. would
make of it.

To M. T. his fourth-particular. That the Church Covenant; Exercitat.
yea as set forth in the book of the Churches of New England, called CHURCH
COVENANT is an human-invention, devised to supply the place of baptism.

We answer. We will not say that this is Cynically, but we will say it is
boldly spoken by one man, Animad.
so to censure so many brave men for Learning, Godliness, Conscience, and
Sufferings.

For 1 we quaere whether M. T. does think the late National Covenant to be a
mere human-invention? If not, let him be moderate in his opinion of Church
Covenant. 2 We assert, that whatsoever ingenuous and understanding Reader
shall peruse the Book called the Church Covenant, will find it stronger for a
Church Covenant then M. T. his Treatise for the Anabaptists way of baptizing. 3
We put M. T. in mind, that all relations (except natural) are founded upon
mutual covenant, and agreement, as between husband and wife, Master and
servant, amp;c. Therefore that between Pastor and flock. 4 That Baptism
exhibiting one to be a member of the universal visible Church now on earth,
does not make him to belong peculiarly to my flock See before in the former
Chapter touching faults in Discipline.
that are bound in Scripture duties to me, or me to be a Pastor, and bound
in conscience of Pastoral duty to him. 5 In that, seeing some particular
express intimation there must be (seeing we have not the intellectual
communication of Angels) that he or she is of my flock, and I their Pastor,
What can M. T. find out to effect this, if he lay aside all Covenantall
expressions. 6 If the Church Covenant were composed by men, as those of
marriage, servantship, etc. are; yet all divine, duties may follow upon this, as
upon them, by divine imposition.


CHAP. XVII.
TO the 1 and 2 particulars in the minor of M. T. his seventh Argument of
Errors occasioned by Infant Baptism, Exercit. 20.
as that Baptism confers grace by the work done, that Baptism is regeneration.

We answer. Animad.
1 M.T. in all his allegations of Antiquities, or others that are orthodox in
the main, has not to our knowledge produced any such expression as that
Popish one, that Baptism confers grace by the work done. 2 That we have
produced places of best antiquity that expressly tell us that their meaning was
that we should not in denying Baptism to Infants, as much as in us lies hinder
their salvation. See before out of Cyprian.
Thirdly, that ancients do call Baptism regeneration is no more than to speak
Scripture phrase, Which place the Ancients often quote in that point.
John 3.5. Titus 3.5. Fourthly, that the ancients did not think Baptism did
profit all baptized persons.
Lib. 4. contra Donatistas.
Augustine says, What profits the Sacrament to them that receive it, unless
they be inwardly changed? And blaming some in his time, says, What profits the
Sacrament to them that receive it, unless they be inwardly changed? And
blaming some in his time says, Spem baptiz andorum auferunt a Domino Deo, and
in homine ponendam esse persuadent. That is, They take off the baptized from
their hope in God, and persuade them to, place it in men.

To M.T. his third particular thence, Exercit.
that Infants dying are saved by the faith of their parents.

We reply. Animad.
1 How does this agree with the former assertion, that we hold baptism,
confers grace ex^pere ^perato, by the work done? 2 Where in approved antiquity,
or late Protestant Writers is any such expression? We say upon very good
Scriptures, urged before, that a child of a believing parent is to be reckoned
within the Covenant, by virtue of that parents faith; but to pronounce him to
be saved thereby, is a doctrine unknown to us.


For those expressions of M.T. annexed to his third particular; put upon us,
as, that Infants are saved by the faith of sureties, of the Church receiving
into her lap: we desire they may be carried back to Rome, whence they were
brought; the dispute now is not between. Papists and Protestants.

To M T. his fourth particular in that argument: Exercitat.
that some regenerate persons may fall from grace.

We answer. Animad.
That neither is the dispute between Prelaticall-erring-time-serving-vassals,
and us: Have therefore these things away to the Prelaticall Arminians, and
their State-serving-Complyants.

CHAP. XVIII.
TO M.T. his first particular of his minor in his eighth argument, Exercitat.
that Infant Baptism has occasioned private Baptism.

We answer: Animad.
If M.T. means private in regard of place (for we never knew of difference of
forms) as that which is done in a dwelling house, we demand what danger or
derogation is there, in that, more then in that which is commonly called a
Church. Or 2 that Baptism which is not done in a River, we demand, whether
Baptism in a dwelling house or in a meeting place, in the company of 40 or 50
be not as public, as when two or three steal to a Rivers side, in some uncouth
and unfrequented place; yea and as well done in the said houses, as there, as
to the question now in hand, of private or not private?

To M.T. his second particular, of Baptism by women, Exercitat.
occasioned by Infant Baptism.

We answer. Animad.
1 we know no such thing to have been allowed in the Protestant Churches since
Luthers time. 2 For ancienter time, before the invasion of gross Popery into
the World* Bin.
The fourth Council of Carthage, Ca. 10. commands, Mulier baptizare non
pr^sumat, that is, Let not woman presume to baptize. So that if an over-forward
Midwife, or Matron presumed to baptize upon the example of that bold woman
Zippora circumcising her son she had by Moses; yet this was not allowed by
the orthodox Churches.


To the third particular, Exercitat.
of baptizing children before they are brought into light.

We answer, Animad.
we cannot see what M. T. means in that darkness. If he means baptizing of
the mother, having the child in her womb; we have showed before that Councils
have enacted against it. Or what ever M. T. means, we know no allowance given
to it, by orthodox Churches.

To his fourth particular of baptizing Infants of unce^ta^n progeny. Exercitat.


We answer, Animad.
that this cannot follow upon our Tenet of baptizing believers Infants. If
others practices extended further: it was the darkness and corruption of the
times, without our line, and the line of Scripture.

To his fifth particular. Exercitat.
That they are baptized in the name of the Lord, who know not the Lord, nor
ever perhaps will consent to the confession of his name.

We answer: Animad.
Supposing that M. Tombs means saving knowledge, (or else he speaks to little
puepose) 1 The same inconvenience might Abraham have objected against
Circumcision of little ones at eight days old. But he did not; yea, he
circumcised Ismael, though the Lord told him the blessing should be upon Isaak,
Genesis 17. Secondly, The same objection we can justly make against the
Anabaptists baptism; by too much experience; and testimony too from some of
their writings: wherein as we have before quoted; that upon confession of sins,
or profession of the faith of the Anabaptists, See before Epiphan. And the book
called the mark or character of the Beast.
such are to be baptized, though things otherwise are much wanting, or amiss.
Thirdly, If Infants may have saving grace as John Baptist had, and those, Mark
10. And M. T. before confessed they might; And the mere acts of the reasonable
soul do not depend upon the organs of the body, much less does grace depend
on them; and the grace of God may act as conveniently in a well waking child,
as in a man a sleep or in a swound, then we cannot boldly say with M. T. that
all Infants that are baptized, know not the Lord; or do not consent to the
Lord. What they will prove after, the promise of God, I am the God of thee and
they seed, is as sure an evidence, as the judgment of the Anabaptists touching
them they bapti^e.


To the sixth particular. Exercitat.
That Infant Baptime has admitted into the communion of the Church, and to the
Lords Supper, many ignorant and profane. For who says M. T. can deny rightly,
the right of the Church to the baptized.

We answer. To that that of admission of them to the Lords Supper, because
baptized, Animad.
is a mere Scripturelesse and an alog^call, irrational non s^quitur. The
Scriptures that bids give a child of eight days the first seal; and does
tell us Christ laid his hands on little ones, and no where forbids to baptize
believers Infants; do tell us Christ gave the Communion only to persons of ripe
years; and forbids us to give it but to them that duly examine themselves. It
is unreasonable to infer that if one has committed a fault in not right using
the first Sacrament, proving ignorant or profane, that he should be admitted
to the second till he amend. Yea, if M. T. holds Excommunication out, and
Baptism an admission into particular Church Communion (how I leave him to make
out) if I say he holds these, then I suppose if he were in a particular Church,
he would give his vote to Excommunicate one that walks profanely after Baptism.
Then by the same proportion, we may keep back from the Communion, one baptized
in infancy, and after proving profane; and by a better pretense, seeing by
Baptism we did not admit him into a particular Church, where peculiarly is
administered the Communion of the Lords Supper.

To M. T. his seventh particular in the minor of his eighth Argument. Exercitat.
That Infant Baptism does prevent the order of Discipline, that first a man be
baptized, and after is among the catechized.

We answer. Animad.
1 That God commanded Abraham to give the first sign or seal to all his male
Family, Genesis 17. After Genesis 18.19. it is said he would instruct his children. 2
Instruction may follow receiving the Lords Supper (else farewell Preaching)
therefore it may follow Baptism. 3 We have showed plentifully out of good
antiquity, and famous modern Authors upon Heb. 6.2. That the Doctrine on
Catechizings of Baptismes belonged to unbelievers children before Baptism, and
the Doctrine of imposition of hands belonged to believers Infants after
Baptism. 4 That to acknowledge one a member of a particular Church by a
general confession, and the common act of Baptism is a greater overthrow to
dicipline, by leaving this man in that condition, that you cannot call him to
an account, nor is he engaged to come at your call to give you an account,
however he walks.


Exercitat.
To M. T. his 8, 9, 10 particulars.

That the Sacrament of Baptism is turned into a mere Ceremony, yea, profane
meeting, and feasting, by Infant Baptism.

Men forget Baptism, as if never administered.

It takes away zeal, or at least diminishes it.

Animad.
I say to these; that I were as good give no answer to these empty things, as
to give such an answer as is most suitable, for then that answer must be as
trivial as the argument. M. Tombs can answer himself, that the same thing
might be objected against the institution of Circumcision. That there was a
Feast at the weaning of Isaac, yet no profaneness; and the Feast of Charity
accompanied the Lords Supper a good while, ere it degenerated. That we can
well enough mind at ripe years what was bequethed by Testament to us in our
nonage. That a sealed Covenant preceding, when it comes into consideration by
due education, cannot cool our zeal toward a natural worship to own God.

CHAP. XIX.
Exercitat.
TO M.T. his 1, 2, and fourth particulars of the minor, of his ninth argument;
That Infant baptism has occasioned the needless disputes; about the baptism
of Excommunicates-Infants. about the baptism of Apostates-Infants. about the
baptism of Next-unbelieving Parents Infants, the Grand Parents. about the
baptism of being believers.


Animad.
We answer, that in our Churches, there are no such disputes about these
things. We can easily by the tenor of the Scripture, resolve on the negative,
that the children are not to be baptized, whiles the next Parents are such as
M. T. has mentioned.

Exercitat.
To the third particular that Infant baptism has occasioned an unnecessary
dispute about the baptizing of the Infants of believing parents, that are not
members of gathered Churches.

Animad.
We answer. I never perceived the world troubled with this dispute. Diverse
Churches without dispute can practice the baptizing of such. And other Churches
without dispute practice it not, and so as much as in them is are kept back the
more Infants, to be baptized at ripe years, according to M. T. his define; who
has moved more dispute then any twenty of our Churches formerly have made,
about Baptism.

Thus of M. T. his 6, 7, 8, 9 Arguments, with a general and particular answers
thereunto.

CHAP. XX.
NExt we come to M. T. his tenth Argument which is this. Exercitat. 23.
That in the midst of the darkness under the papacy, the same men opposed
Infant Baptism, who opposed inv^cation of Saints, prayer for the dead,
adoration of the cross, etc. This is manifest.

1 Out of the 66 Sermon of Bernard on the Canticles, whereof the Heretics (as
he calls them) who he said boasted themselves to be successors of the Apostles;
and named themselves Apostolic, He has these words, They deride us because we
baptize infants. because we pray for the dead, etc. And in his 140 Epistle to
Hildefonsus he complains of Henricus the Heritick that he took away Holi-days,
etc. and denied the grace of baptism to infants.

2 From the Epistle of P- Abbat-Cluniacensis, to three Bishops of France
against Peter de Bruis, and Henricus holding errors digested into five heads. 1
That little ones are not to be baptized. 2 That Churches or Altars ought not to
be made. 3 That the Cross of our Lord is not to be adored, etc.


3 From Lucas Osiander his Epitom of the Ecclesiastical History, Cent. 13. l.
1. c. 4. at the year, 1207 where he accuses the Albigensis, as consenting with
the Anabaptists.

4 To which I add, That in the ages near the Apostles, Tertulian in his book
of Baprisme cap. 18. Greg. Nazianzen in his 40 Oration of holy baptism,
dissuade the baptism of infants, unless the danger of death happen. Thus far
M. T.

Animad.
Note as an introduction to our Answer, That Bernard, and Cluniacensis lived
about the same time. That the very same Henricus, alias Heinricus, mentioned by
Bernard for an Heretic, is the same man (in all probability) that Clunia^ensis
mentions. And in both Authors he is called, as by himself pretended to be,
an Apostle. Now for Answer, we say to M. T. his particular, 1 That the same man
that opposed Infant baptism, opposed the authority of the Old Testament. So
did Henricus at this time. So says Cluniacensis of Henricus alias Heinricus,
in the place M.T. quotes out of See more before of Cluniacensis touching
Henricus and de Bruis abundantly, Chap. 14 of our Animad. page 160, 161, etc.
Cluniacensis. So have the opposers of Infant Baptism since. See
Cloppenburgius in his book called, The Gang^en of Anabaptisticall Divinity.
Some particulars we have translated before in the Catalogues of the errors of
the Anabaptists. Yea, the said Henricus and De Bruis, doubted of the authority
of Paul's Epistles in the New Testament. So M.T. his Cluniacensis. 2 That
formerly those same men that opposed Infant baptism, held all those dreadful
errors we numbered up a little before. Cap. 15. 3 That many of the same men that
opposed Infant baptism, were either Arians or Pelagians, or Socinians, or
Arminiaus, as we have formerly showed out of Epiphanius, Augustine, M. Phillips,
and M. Ainsworth. And experience at this day shows us in them that together
with Anabaptisme, hold universal redemption and free will, 4 That Bernard did
justly call Henricus Heretic, he holding that the Old Testament and Paul's
Epistles were of doubtful authority, as Cluniacensis tells us out of their own
writings. 5 On the contrary part, the same men, that have held Infant Baptism
were 1 Great lights to the Church, As Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, Cyprian, Gregory
Nazianzen, Tertullian, Hierom, Augustine, etc. 2 Glorious Instruments in
Reformation, Luther, Melancthon, Bullinger, Calvin. 3 Were renowned Martyrs
dying for Christ. Some ancient, as Peter Martyr, Irenaeus, etc. Some later, as
Master Philpot, see his Letter in the Book of Martyrs, against Anabaptisme.



A most pious, Note.
learned and brave letter, which may suffice for a Treatise upon the point,
penned by such a gracious spirit, that soon after poured out his blood for
Christ. See his Letter at the year 1555 in the book of Martyrs, Volume 3. page
606. colum. 2. of the last Edition, in the reign of Queen Mary, among M.
Philpots Letters.

Animad.
To M. T. his second particular, in this argument, we answer that M. T. reckons
out of Cluniacensis, five errors that Henricus and De Bruis held against, but
leaves out the great error they held for, which was that the Authority of the
Old Testament, and of the Epistles of Paul in the New were of doubtful
authority, as we touched before.

To M.T. his fourth particular touching the ALBIGENSES, as they are called in
his book.

We answer. That it is true, that in M. T. his forequoted place, Exercit.
there is mention of the ALBINGENSES (for I suppose he means them) but not a
word there of their consenting with the Anab^ptists. For the naked words are
these: Ablegabat Innocentius papa cum Petro quod am suo legato, duod^cim
Cisterciencis Sectae Abbates in Albingensium terram ut. in. viam ^osdem sua
praedicatione redu^ment, etc. That is, Pope Innocent with One Peter his Legate,
sent away twelve Abb^ts of the Cistercian Sect or Order, into the land of the
Albingenses, to the intent they might by their preaching, bring them back into
the way. And then tells how they called a Council of the Archbishops,
Bishops, and others to consult which would be the best way to enter upon that
design, which the Bishop of Oxford advised to be, not by external pomp as they
were honorable Bishops, but by the preaching of the word, and integrity of
life. And to give them an example, he himself sent home his glorious retinnue,
with all the horses, coaches, and sumpters, and went with a few Clergy men on
foot, and performed the business of preaching strenuously. And so the story
goes off from the Albingenses.

But being not willing to shift off the business, we looked before in that
Osiander his Epitome in the year before, namely Anno 1206, but in the same
Chapter M.T. quotes, and there we found the nest, which is little for M.T. his
advantage, or for the credit of the Anubaptists. The infer^ing here of the bare
story is answer enough. In english it is this (The Latin as a witness of our
faithfulness in translating you have in the margin.)

EXorta est, and progressu temporis vires acquisivit, haeresis Albingensium,
sive Albiensium, sive Albianorum, in Gallia: quos alii ab autore, allii a loco
Galliae, sic dictos putant: ea Romae primo coepisse, postea vero in comitatu
Tolosato (etiam intra viros illustres) long lateque sparsa dicitur: quin etiam
in Angliam penetrasse scribitur. Dogmata haec illis attribuuntur.

Duo esse Principia, Deum videlicet, bonum: and Deum malum, hoc est, Diabolum,
qui omnia corpora creet: Bonum autem Deum creare animas.

Christi corpus non aliter esse in pane, quam in aliis rebus.

Baptismum abjiciunt.

Ire in Ecclesias, vel in eis orare, nihil prodesse.

Episcopos Papales coetum sceleratorum, and Ecclesiam Pontificiam, coetum

Matrimonia damnabant: promiscuos concubitus, cosquenefarios, sanctos ducebant.
(Hic est furor Satanicus.)

Corporum resurrectionem negant.

Mortuos vivorum beneficiis non^ juvari. (Haec propositio non est haeretica.)

Animas defunctorum hominum transire per diversa corpora, etiam animalium and

personae corpus.

Carnem comedi prohibent.

Tribuitur illis a quibusdam, quod Evangelion urina conspersum, de muro in

Christum non esse Deum, nec assumpsisse carnem de Virgin, sed e Coelo carnem^

Quod Christus non fuerit verus homo, nec vere comederit: quod non vere passus

Mundum semper fuisse, semper futurum.

Quod Moses fuerit malus.

Quod Adam non fuerit a Deo.

Ecclesiam non posse aliquid possidere, nisi incommuni, nec debere persequi
malos,

Hae propositiones cu partim sint absurdae, impiae, and haereticae: partim
etiam in Politia tolerari non possent: praesertim promiscuae libidines, and
abolitio matrimonii, cum Albingenses admonitiones non admitterent, sed in
erroribus and sceleribus persisterent, adhortante Pontifice Romano, Magistratus
politicus, collecto exercitu, duabus vicibus aliquot millia Albin gensium
trucidarunt: multi etiam capitibus truncati, and cremati leguntur, qui hinc
inde sunt deprehensi: fuit enim Albingensis, furor Anabaptisticus, qualis Anno
1534. nostro seculo, Anabaptistarum Monasteriensium crat.

THere arose, and in progress of time gat strength the heresy of the
Albingenses, or Albienses, or Albians in France; whom some think to be so
called from their Author, others, from a place in France. That heresy is said
to take beginning first at Rome, then it was dispersed far and wide in the
county of Toulouse (and that among men of rank) and more over, they write, that
it entered England. The opinions attributed to them are these.

That there are two Principles, or beginnings, namely the good God; and the
Evil, that is the Devil who creates all bodies: The good God creates souls.

That the body of Christ is no otherwise in the bread then in other things.

They throw away Baptism.

That it profits nothing to go into Churches or to pray in them.

That the Papal Bishops were a company of infernal spirits. (In this
proposition they did not much err from the truth.)

They condemned all matrimony, or marriages. Promiscuous or mingled, and wicked
copulations, they accounted holy. (This is a Satanicall fury.)

They deny the Resurrection of the dead.

They say that the dead are not helped by any kindnesses from the living. (This
Proposition is not heretical.)

The souls of the dead if they lived wickedly pass through diverse bodies, even
of Animals, Serpents. If they lived well, then they pass into the body of some
Prince, or some such noble person.

They forbid the eating of slesh.

It is attributed to them by some, that they threw down the books of the
Gospel, sprinkled with piss from the wall, upon the enemies, with addition of
many reproaches.

That Christ is not God, neither took he flesh of the Virgin, but brought
down his flesh with him from heaven.

That Christ was not true man, nor did he truly eat: that he did not truly
suffer on the cross, nor ascend into heaven.

That the world has been, and shall be eternal.

That Moses was wicked.

That Adam was not from God.

That the Church can possess nothing but in common, Neither ought it to
persecute the wicked.

That usury is not forbidden, nor are things taken away to be restored, etc.

These propositions being partly absurd, wicked, and heretical; partly
intolerable in a Commonwealth, especially promiscuous lusts, and the abolishing
of matrimony, when the Albingenses would receive no admonition, but persisted
in their impieties, the civil Magistrate, the Bishop of Rome exhorting him
thereunto, having gathered an Army, two several times slew some thousands of
them; many also were beheaded, and many burnt (as we read) being taken here and
there. For Albingensis was an Anabaptisticall fury, such as was that in the
year 1534 in our age, Of the Monasterian. Anabaptists.

Thus far out of the Chapter M. Tombs quoted out of Osiander, alleging the
Albingenses against us, for an instance, that the same men that opposed
Infant Baptism, opposed Popish superstitions: How, you have heard out of
Master Tombs his quoted Author.

To M. T. his fourth particular of those places of Tertullian and Gregory
Nazianzen, Tertull. p. 120. Greg. Nazian. p. 139.
I have abundantly answered several times before, Chap. 13 and 14 of our
Animadversions, and elsewhere.

CHAP. XXI.
MAster Tombs his eleventh argument against Infant baptism is; Exercit. 22.
because the assertors of Infant baptism little agree among themselves, upon
what foundation they may build Infant Baptism. Cyprian and others of the
Ancients draw it from the universality of grace, and the necessity of baptism
to salvation. Augustine, Bernard, etc. bring the faith of the Church as the
reason of baptizing infants. The Catechism in the English Liturgy puts the
promise of the sureties. The Lutherans the faith of infants. Others, the
holiness of a believing Nation. Others, the faith of the next parent, and
others, the faith of the next parent in Covenant in a gathered Church.

We answer, 1 In general, Multaloqueris, pauc a dicis, Animad.
Here is much spoken, little proved. We have but one quotation, and that is out
of the English Masse-book the Episcopal Liturgy. 2 More particularly. 1 By
way of retort. 2 By way of reply.



1 We retort. The Anabaptists also much differ in their foundation of their
Anabaptisme, some build it on bare confession of sins, what ere the man be in
point of manifestation of grace. So some of the Arians, etc. See Epiphan. before
quoted in the 15 Chap. And of late, the Author of the book called the Mark, or
Character of the Beast. Some on profession of farth. So many of them at this
day. Some on signs of grace. So M.T. Some on making them Disciples. So M.D.
and others. Yet M.T. says in the next argument, that a man is showed to be a
Disciple by baptism, and we have proved before, believers children are
reckoned Disciples. Some build their Anabaptisme upon I know not what. Master
S.M. says that by baptizing in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, is
not meant, baptism with water. And those Anabaptists in Germany now,
mentioned in Cloppenburgius, and by Spanhemius at the end of Cl^ppenburgius
(where you have the history of them) say John Baptist was a Minister of the
Law, not of the Gospel. See before in our 15 Chap.

2 By way of reply. 1 To Cyprian, etc. They hold not universality of grace, but
the indefinit offer of grace. How they held in point of baptism, and upon
howmany Scripture grounds, we have before showed, cap. 13, 14. 2 To Augustine
we reply, that M. T. before fiercely charged Augustine for holding
Infant Baptism upon Cyprian grounds. Nor do I remember in all M. T. his
quotations out of Augustine, any such thing as he here mentions of him. 3 To
Bernard we reply, Thst M. T. tells us neither what nor where he says it. It he
did say so any where, we know he lived in late corrupted times, and far more
worthy to be slighted in this, then Cyprian, Augustine. etc. whom M.T. has so
slighted. 4 To the English Liturgy, Tolerabiles ineptiae, Calvin.
seeing M.T. aleadgeth that English-masse, those tolerable fooleries, as Calvin
calls them, Covenanted against by us all, put down by Parliament, and no more
to be urged against us, then against M. Tombs himself, and the Preachers of
his judgment, We reply, give the Devil his due, the English Liturgy urges
for infant baptism the 10 of Mar. And the Catechism therein says, Faith is
necessary to Baptism, what ever other unnecessary expressions be added. 5 To
the Lutherans opinion, seeing we must take it upon M. T. his bare word, we say
only this, That M.T. confessed, that infants may, when infants, have
regeneration, saving grace, etc. 6 To that of the faith of a holy Nation we
have answered before upon M.T. his reply to 1 Pet, 29. And add so far as a
Nation is holy and believing, so far all parents are such too, and so this
sixth particular is all one with the fifth of believing parents, which we have
maintained all along as a sufficient ground of giving their children the first
seal. 8 To that of parensa in Covenant in a gathered Church, we have answered a
little before See before in Chap. 13. Infaults in Disciplne.
we add that those that so practice, look in baptism to the says of parents,
more then to that their Covenant.


CHAP. XXII.
THe last, and that a weighty reason of doubting is, because Infant baptism
seems to take away one, Exercit.
perhaps the primary end of Baptism; 25.
for many things argue that it was one end of Baptism, that it should be a
sign that the baptized shows himself a disciple, and confesses the faith in
which he has been instructed. The Argument against Infant Baptism, from its
voyding the chief end of Baptism, confirmed.


1 The requiring of confession by John Baptist and the Apostles, was wont to be
before Baptism, Luke 3.10. Act. 8.35. Act. 16.31.

2 The frequent manner of speaking in the new Testament, which puts Baptism for
Doctrine, Act. 10.37. Act. 19.3. shows this. Beza in his A not. on Act. 19.3.
The answer is most apposite, in which they signify that they professed in
Baptism the Doctrine propounded by John and confirmed by use of Baptism, with
which they had been baptized, whereby they had acknowledged Christ but very
slenderly.

3 The form of Christ's institution, Mat 28.19, compared with the phrase as it
is used 1 Cor. 1.13. Or, were you baptized into the name of Paul? implies the
same. On which place Beza,

The third reason is taken from the form and end of Baptism, in which we give
our name to Christ, being called upon, with the Father and Holy Spirit.

4 That which is said John 4, 2. He made and baptized more disciples. And Mat.
28.19. Going, make Disciples in all nations, baptizing them; Intimate this. And
if, as some affirm, Baptism was in use with the Jews, in the initiating of
proselytes into the profession of Judaisme; this opinion is the more confirmed.
But in Infant Baptism the matter is so carried, that Baptism serves to confirm
a benefit, not to signify a profession made: and so one, perhaps the chief end
of Baptism is voyded. And here I think it is to be minded, that the usual
description of a Sacrament, and such as are like to it, That it is a visible
sign of invisible grace; has occasioned the misunderstanding of both
Sacraments, as if they signed a divine benefit, not our duty, to which in the
first place the Iustitution had respect.

In seems to some, that Infant Baptism should be good, because the devil
requires witches to renounce it: which reason, if ought worth, might as well
prove Baptism of any Infants, Baptism by a midwife, good; because these the
devil requires them to renounce, as well that which is of the Infants of
believers, by a lawful Minister. But the true reason why he requires the
Baptism of witches to be renounced by them, is not because the baptism is
good in respect of the administration of it; but because the Faith mentioned in
the form of baptism, is good; and they that renounce not their baptism do
show their adherence to that faith in some sort which cannot stand with an
explicit Covenant with the Devil. Nor is the assuming of baptism in ripe
years by those who were washed in infancy a renounceing of baptism, as some
in their gross ignorance conceit; but indeed a firmer avouching of baptism
according to Christ's mind.

This more likely might be inferred from the Devils practice in requiring
witches to renounce their baptism; That the profession of Faith is the main
business in Baptism, which should be before Baptism, if it were rightly
administered after the first pattern.

We answer, Animad.
1. In general. That as circumcising of infants, did not in se, in regard of
itself, intrinsecally considered, take away one end of it, to wit, that signing
of duty, and obligement unto profession; so nor does the baptism of infants. 2
That signing of profession is not the primary, that is either the first or
chief end of baptism, but the signing of Gods favor to us, and his giving
grace into us, whereby we should afterward walk dutifully toward him. For
the seal confirms the Covenant, and so runs the Covenant of Grace. 3 We before
proved by two Scriptures, John 9.28. Acts 15.10.
that the children of those parents, that are reputed members of the visible
Church, were accounted and called Disciples in both Testaments. 4 That children
signed with the 1 sign or seal, are engaged to be active Disciples, when they
come to be of years, as in the Old Testament, so in the New, as we have before
showed. For Circumcision see, Gal. 5.3. and for Baptism, see Mat. 28.19, 20.
ver. 19. Go teach and Baptize, etc. ver. 20. Teaching them effectually (so the
word signifies) to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded. 5 That the
Anabaptists generally affirm with M.T. that they must be first made Disciples,
and known to be made such, before they are baptized, and yet M. T. asserts a
little before that baptism exhibits him ^^member of the Church, and here, that
baptism is a sign that manifests him to be a Disciple. Now if they have not
manifestations of grace, if they be not manifestly Disciples, or discipled (as
M. T. formerly spoke) they will not baptize them. And so by this they are
manifestly Disciples, or discipled before, yet manifested to be disciples in
baptism. 6 Baptism of infants does not anticipate profession, but oblige unto
it in due time.


2 To answer particularly as to the reasons to prove that one end of baptism
is to be a sign that the baptized shows himself a Disciple, and of his
confession of faith. 1 We say that all those proofs reach but to those that
were baptized at ripe years, as has been before largely discussed. 2 M. T. his
inferring that profession may be the end of baptism, does not infer that it
must be made by the baptized at every time whatsoever. Affirmatives bind
always, but not to every point of time. 3 M. T. his inferring that profession
is one end of Baptism, does not conclude that it is all, or the chief end of
baptism.
For whereas M. T. would have that description, of such like of a Sacrament [An
outward sign of invisible grace] to be an occasion of misunderstanding of both
Sacraments, as if they signed a divine benifit, not our duty; we say that to
our knowledge no true Protestant ever so understood it. And the Papists
understand it for ought I can perceive, more of duty then they should, in that
they put so much in their act, or bare doing, as if thereby to please God, as
they put merit in their other actions.

To that M. T. speaks in the conclusion of all his arguments, concerning the
Devil, requiring witches to renounce their baptism, or rather their
profession in baptism.

We answer. 1 Sure enough the devil requires those to renounce their baptism
that were baptized in infanc^e, when they could not make profession. If they
made profession after upon that baptism, then it appears against M. T. that
Infant Baptism proves obligatorie to them grown up. 2 It is no way sure that
Satan does require those witches to renounce their nominall baptism, that they
received from midwives. 3 (As an answer to all) the most likely reason why
Satan requires witches to renounce their baptism, being the titular seal of
all their hypocritical profession is, that they might detest all wherein they
had seemed any ways to have any thing to do with God.


Now the God of truth, and love, make us one in every truth and mean while one
in love. Amen.
