A DECLARTION And Protest of the Lords, Knights and Gentlemen In the Counties
of CHESTER SALOP STAFFORD, etc.
Against all Assemblies which impose Taxes upon the People without their
consent by their Representatives in a Full, Free and Legal PARLIAMENT.
HAving, with great trouble, observed the grievances of the People in these
late Revolutions, and being encouraged by the common consent of this Nation
(secconding our late endeavors) in their frequent Addresses unto his
Excellency the Lord General Monck, We have consulted, and thereupon, with
them, do declare our Protest against all Powers or Assemblies whatsoever, who
impose Taxes upon the People, without their consent by their Representatives,
duly elected in a Full, Free and Legal Parliament; And that any should seem to
countenance that force put upon the Parliament (now called the secluded
Members) in the year 1648. by Cromwell and his Conspirators, seems
unreasonable unto us, in that they have publicly disowned the like force since
put upon themselves as unlawful: Therefore how the Minor part of National
Councils can exclude the Major (which was ever acknowledged the whole) we leave
to the consideration of all sober men, and say, That the People ought not to be
limited in their Elections, by unheard of Qualifications, contrary to the
known Laws of England: neither that the Members so Elected or forcibly
Secluded, should be debarred the discharge of their Trust, by any previous
Oaths or Engagements whatsoever; for that they were the first Assertors of our
Rights and Freedom of Parliaments, unto which they bound themselves (the
Nations complying) by Solemn Leagues and Covenants) not to destroy, but to
preserve) The breach of which by others we find has brought these Calamities
upon us, all which we hope will be called to remembrance, and repented of, as
becomes Christians, that at last the Nations may have peace and be settled.
