LONDON, Printed for THO. IACKSON, Ian. 23. Anno Dom. 1642.

A great wonder in HEAVEN: Showing the late Apparitions and Prodigious noyses
of War and Battails seen on Edgehill near Keynton in Northamptonshire.
THat there has been, and ever will be Laruae spectra, and such like
apparitions, namely, Ghosts and Goblins, have been the opinion of all the
famousest Divines of the Primitive Church, and is (though oppugned by some) the
received Doctrine of diverse learned men at this day, their opinion being indeed
ratified and confirmed by diverse Texts of Scripture, as the Devils possessing
the Swine, and the men possessed with Devils in the Acts of the Apostles, that
came out of them, and beat the Exorcists, by which it is evidently confirmed,
that those legions of erring angels that fell with their great Master, Lucifer,
are not all confined to the local Hell, but live scattered here and there,
dispersed in the empty regions of the air as thick as motes in the Sun, and
those are those things which our too superstitious ancestors called Elves and
Goblins, Furies, and the like, such as were those who appeared to Machbeth the
after King of Scotland, and foretold him of his fortunes both in life and
death. It is evident, besides, that the devil can condense the air into any
shape he pleases; as he is a subtle spirit, thin and open, and rank
himself into any form or likeness, as Saint Augustine, Prudentius, Hieronimus
Cyril, Saint Basil the Great; and none better then our late Sovereign King
James of ever-living menory, in his Treatise de Demonologia, has sufficiently
proved: but to omit circumstance and preamble, no man that thinks he has a
soul, but will verily and confidently believe that there are devils, and so
consequently such devils as appear either in premonstrance of Gods Judgments,
or as fatal Ambassadors to declare the message of mortality and destruction
to offending Nations; and has in Germany and other places afflicted afterward
with the horror of a civil and foreign wars notoriously manifested.

But to our purpose Edgehill in the very confines of Warwickeshire, near unto
Keynton in Nrrthamptonshire, a place, as appears by the sequel, destined for
civil wars and battles; as where King John fought a battle with his
Barons, and who in the defense of the Kingdoms laws and liberty was fought a
bloody conflict between his Majesty's and the Parliaments forces, who under
the conduct of his Excellence the Earl of Essex, obtained there a glorious
victory over the Cavaliers at this Edgehill, in the very place where the
battle was stricken, have since, and does appear, strange and portentuous
Apparitions of two jarring and contrary Armies, as I shall in order deliver, it
being certified by the men of most credit in those parts, as William Wood
Esquire, Samuel Marshall Minister, and others, on Saturday, which was in
Christmas time, as if the Savior of the world, who died to redeem mankind,
had been angry that so much Christian blood was there spilt, and so had
permitted these infernal Armies to appear, where the corporeal Armies had
shed so much blood; between twelve and one of the clock in the morning was
heard by some Sheepherds, and other contrymen and travelers, first the
found of Drums a far off, and the noise of Soulders, as it were, giving out
their last groans; at which they were much amazed, and amazed stood still,
till it seemed by the neernesse of the noise to approach them, at which too
much affrighted, they sought to withdraw as fast as possibly they could, but
then on the sudden, whilst they were in these cogitations, appeared in the
air the same incorporeall soldiers that made those clamours, and immediately
with Ensigns displayed Drums beating, Muskets going off, Cannons discharged,
Horses neyghing, which also to these men were visible, the alarm or entrance
to this game of death was struck up, one Army which gave the first charge,
having the Kings colors, and the other the Parliaments in their head or front
of the battles, and so pell mell to it they went; the battle that appeared to
the Kings forces seeming at first to have the best, but afterward to be put
into apparent rout; but till two or three in the morning in equal scale
continued this dreadful fight, the clattering of Arms, noise of Cannons,
cries of soldiers so amazing and terrifying the poor men, that they could not
believe they were mortal, or give credit to their ears and eyes, run away
they durst not, for fear of being made a prey to these infernal soldiers,
and so they with much fear and affright, stayed to behold the success of the
business, which at last suited to this effect: after some three hours fight,
that Army which carried the King colors withdrew, or rather appeared to fly;
the other remaining, as it were, Masters of the field, stayed a good space
triumphing, and expressing all the signs of joy and conquest, and then with
all their Drums, Trumpets, Ordnance and Soldiers vanished, the poor men
glad they were gone, that had so long staid them there against their wills, made
with all haste to Keinton, and there knocking up Mr. Wood, a Justice of Peace,
who called up his neighbor Mr. Marshall the Minister, they gave them an
account of the whole passage, and averred it upon their oaths to be true. At
which affirmation of theirs, being much amazed, they should hardly have given
credit to it, but would have conjectured the men to have been either mad or
drunk, had they not known some of them to have been of approved integrity;
and so suspending their judgments till the next night about the same hour,
they with the same men, and all the substantial Inhabitants of that and the
neighboring parishes, drew thither; where about half an hour after their
arrival on Sunday, being Christmas night, appeared in the same tumultuous
warlike manner, the same two adverse Armies, fighting with as much spite and
spleen as formerly: and so departed the Gentlemen and all the spectatours, much
terrified with these visions of horror, withdrew themselves to their houses,
beseeching God to defend them from those hellish and prodigious enemies. The
next night they appeared not, nor all that week, so that the dwellers
thereabout were in good hope they had been for ever departed; but on the
ensuing Saturday night, in the same place, and at the same hour, they were
again seen, with far greater tumult fighting in the manner before mentioned
for four hours, or very near, and then vanished, appearing again on Sunday
night, and performing the same actions of hostility and bloodshed; so that
both Mr, Wood and others, whose faith it should seem was not strong enough to
carry them out against these delusions, forsook their habitations thereabout,
and retired themselves to other more secure dwellings; but Mr, Marshall stayed,
and some other, and so successively the next Saturday and Sunday the same
tumults and prodigious sights and actions were put in the state and condition
they were formerly. The rumor whereof coming to his Majesty at Oxford, he
immediately dispatched thither Colonel Lewis Kirk, Captain Dudley, Captain
Wainman, and three other Gentlemen of credit, to take the full view and notice
of the said business, who first hearing the true atrestation and relation of
Mr. Marshall and others, staid there till Saturday night following, wherein
they heard and saw the forementioned prodigies, and so on Sunday distinctly
knowing diverse of the apparitions, or incorporeall substances by their faces,
as that of Sir Edmund Varney, and others that were there slain; of which upon
oath they made testimony to his Majesty. What this does portend, God only
knows, and time perhaps will discover; but doubtlesly it is a sign of his
wrath against this Land, for these civil wars, which He in his good time
finish, and send a sudden peace between his Majesty and Parliament.

FINIS.
