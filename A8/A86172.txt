THE COMPLAINT OF THE NORTH-WEST COUTREY-MAN.
YOu are well over-taken good Neighbor,
Whether agoo this way,
O how do you good John,
I am very much discontented
At these times, and at my losses,
It Is no matter which way ich go:
Why man, be contented?
A be on the strongest side,
And thou may do well enough:
How? do well enough say you neybour,
Why do you say so? whether ich am
Roundhead or Cavaleer, the soldiers
Will be shure to drink up all my Beer,
My Hens, Ducks and Geese,
They will be shure to have a fleece:
In my chimney ich was wont to have
Eight stitches of bacon fat and brave,
But now at night it may be well hung,
But in the morning it will be gone,
Such doings makes my heart to ache:
And I for fear do sometimes shake,
A-pies take them all.
My horses I in field have fed
In former time where they were bred,
And I road on them in peace,
But now my troubles do increase,
Although for them I paid full dear,
Yet I have left me the smallest share:
A-goodieer take them all.
My Butter, Cheese, Milk Curds, and whay,
They take my very spoon-meat away:
What a life is this?
Last week ich chad seven score sheep,
And ich made account them to keep,
Good profit for to make:
But now, alas, God wot:
They are all gone unto the pot,
Shuch havoc now adays they make,
My corn God Almighty blessed upon the ground,
Into my Barn I brought it sound,
Thinking thereby to increase my estate,
And to make me and my honshold fortunate:
But now I must think of another fate,
Alack, what shall I do:
My woollen, linen, and shuch stuff:
Ye my very Ruff in danger to be lost,
My brass and pewter and shuch things:
I and my wifes rings now must al-ago,
Money I had but little store:
But yet they say, they will have more:
But where do think ich should have it.
Ich have some religion as well as they,
Surely some men have gone astray,
That makes such a quille:
But our sins (alas) it was the way*
That brought upon us all this fray:
God knows when toull end,
Our pride, security, oppression it was great:
When the Christian World was in a fret:
And toild with bloody War:
But now our share is come in haste,
And daily make us for to waste,
The like was never known:
So many bloody battles in four Years,
The like story you did never hear
In any Christian age, our land,
Now full well is known to be in wars:
And jars, ish bloody ones in all the Christian World:
This is the land, say they,
That lived in wealth and store,
But nowtheir sorrows are grown more deny,
Then any Land besides:
This is Gods true Church we cannot
But Christ abundance there will justify,
God send them well to end.
God bless our King and Parliament,
And grant at last they may consent,
To have a godly peace:
Lord bless this people great and small,
And grant that we on him may call
In truth and righteousness,
That he may send us a godly peace,
That so our joys they may increase:
And we may praise Gods Name therefore: AMEN.
FINIS.
