AN EXHORTATION and ADMONITION OF THE Friends and Brethren OF LONDON CHIEFLY,
To all MAIDSERVANTS (who make Profession of the Pure Everlasting Gospel of
Peace and Salvation) as are, or may be Servants in the Families of Friends or
Others, in and about this CITY.
FRIENDS,
WE are come to the Morning of that Day which shall never have an End; and the
Bright and Morning Star is Risen in our Hearts, which shall never Set again;
the True Everlasting Light now Shines; the Grace which brings Salvation is
now Appeared; and the Kindness and Love of God is shed abroad in our Hearts,
and we are made Partakers of it, whereby we are Constrained to Love Him again,
and to Walk Worthy of all his Mercies, and to Watch over one another for Good;
that all things may be done to the Praise and Glory of him, who is God Blessed
forever and ever.

And whereas it has Pleased God, after a Long Night of Apostasy, to Cause his
Everlasting Gospel to be Preached again, and to spread the Knowledge thereof,
and that now many are the Professors of it; There is a Desire in us, and a Care
upon us, That all that Profess it, might Live the Life it requires, in all
Holiness of Conversation, as becomes the Church of God; and that nothing be
done, that may be of Evil Report to them that are without.

So Friends, You that are Maidservants, and make Profession of the Truth of
our Lord Jesus Christ; We desire you to receive the Word of Exhortation, which
we have in our Hearts for you, as follows.

Be Faithful in your Services and Places wherein you are called: And be not
Eye-Servants; but perform all things relating to you, as in the Sight of the
Lord (whose Eye is over you) without Murmuring or Discontent: And show forth a
Meek and Quiet Spirit, Ready and Obedient to those that have the Rule over you
in all that is Good; whether you dwell with those that are Partakers of the
same Faith with you, or with those that are Strangers to it: For we assuredly
know, That if you abide in that which gives you a Feeling and Enioyment of the
Love of God, and thereby are made Partakers of the Virtue of his Truth in your
Hearts, whether you dwell with Friends or Others, as Servants, you will be
Engaged by it, to use your Utmost Diligence, and to be Careful and Circumspect
in all things you take in hand; that you may Adorn the Holy Truth you profess:
And Excel those that are Ignorant of it; and so be good Patterns and Ensamples,
and a Good Savor, and Preachers of Righteousness in your Places to all that
behold you: So will the Blessing and Presence of the Lord be felt in your
Hearts, and make your Services Easy, and Minister a Reward of your
Faithfulness into your Bosoms.

And further, Friends; Our Exhortation is, That you Abide in your places, and
not Move from Place to Place upon Slight Occasions; nor to count it
Burthensom, and Inconsistent with Christian-Liberty, to be Servants; and so let
in a Desire after Ease, and Liberty to the Flesh; and then incline to leave
your Places, wherein is your Service for God, his Truth and People: and then
take Rooms or Chambers for your selves to dwell in at your Own Hands; from
whence many Inconveniences and Evils have ensued, to our Grief and Trouble:
Besides, It is not of a Good Report to them that are without, That
Maidservants, contrary to the Truth, should leave their Services, and take
Rooms to live by themselves.

Therefore our Exhortation is, That as you tender the Precious Truth, and Us
the Friends of it; Let none of you, for the time to come, (that have not served
Apprentiships to some Trade) Leave, or Depart from your Services, to Dwell by
your selves, under any Pretense whatsoever; until you have first obtained the
Consent and Approbation of the Monthly Meeting of Friends of that part where
you dwell (who will be tender toward those as are or may he Aged, or otherwise
incapable of going to Service) that things may be done in the Unity of the One
Everlasting Truth, in which our Fellowship stands, where we cannot lay heavy
Burdens upon one another, nor Grieve one another. But every one, in their
Places, serving one another in that Bond of Love which cannot be broken, which
brings all Relations into their Right Order; as, Masters and Mistresses to
their Servants (not Turning them away Hastily, but Patiently Instructing them)
and Servants to their Masters and Mistresses; Parents to their Children, and
Children to their Parents; the Elder and Strong to the Younger and Weak, and
the Younger and Weak to the Stronger and Elder. And as this Bond of Love and
Heavenly Wisdom is Felt and Enjoyed by you all, it makes you Tender, and Easy
to be Entreated to that which is Good.

So, hoping We need not multiply more Words, to persuade in this Matter, but
that you will Obey and Fulfill this our Exhortation and Admonition; which is
according to Sound Doctrine; We commend you to the Grace of our Lord Jesus
Christ, which has Appeared in your Hearts, and is Ready and Sufficient to
Enable you to every Good Word and Work: In which Grace we remain.

Your Friends, Brethren and Sisters of the Men and Women's Meetings in London,
this Eleaventh of the Ninth Month, 1672.
