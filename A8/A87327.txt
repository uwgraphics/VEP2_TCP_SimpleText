PROPOSITIONS SENT By the Jrish Parliament held at Kilkenny, to the
Commissioners at Dublin; concerning Peace in that Kingdom.
Right honorable,
ALthough it so fortuned by the chance of War, that our Forces under the
command of his Excellency Genesis Preston, at the last conflict in the field were
something over-powerd by yours, with the loss of some of our native Countrymen
of rank and quality, of which we being so sensible on, cannot but for a time
cloth our selves in mourning. Yet does it not any ways dismay us, or strike
us with fear or terror, nor causes us any ways to despair of the future
event of the War; but only a serious consideration and religious care which
we have of this our native Kingdom: to prevent the effusion of Christian
blood, of which there has been an overflowing torrent for a long time spread
over this distressed and languishing Kingdom which induces us to be the
first, and exemplary instruments to revert the gluttonous Sword from banqueting
in blood and destruction, on which for these seven years it has been feasted;
and to bring it back again to its former place, to wit, to the hand of the
Civil Magistrate, to execute temporal Justice; and that the ancient known
Laws of the Kingdom might return to their former place: His Majesty enjoy his
supreme power and dignity; the Natives to have their liberties as Subjects, and
not to be enthralled as slaves, that so they and the English might again live
together as friends and fellow Subjects.

For the accomplishing of which, we the confederate Estates of the Kingdom of
Ireland, assembled in Parliament at Kilkenny, do desire that there might be so
far a complacency between us and you; that the original and present
differences betwixt us might be so really understood: whereby we hope by the
clearnes of actions present, and our future endeavors may be apparent to all,
whereby we may make our selves quit of that scandalous and infamous brand of
bloody Rebels.

For the obtaining of which, we desire, that some convenient place might be
appointed, where a considerable number of Nobility and Gentry, both of your
Party and ours, might have some time perfixt to meet, with free commission on
both sides, to treat and consult together, that thereby (with Gods assistance
we may enjoy at length a happy peace and union) and this miserable and bleeding
Kingdom preserved from farther ruin and desolation, which has so long lain
weltring in its own gore, and the distressed inhabitants restored to their
former peace and plenty.

But this our real and sincere requests, some may conjecture may proceed from
our cowardly fear, or policy, that by this means of Treaty, the actions of
the Armies for this Summer might be retarded: but if any do look upon our
Forces at home in Garrison, and abroad in the field, they will find that we
stand not in need of cessation for want of Forces to keep the field: and we
are confident it is not unknown to most of you: for although that part of an
Army then at Lnishknock with General Preston received some damage; yet have we
an Army in the field, marching under General Owen Oneale, which were not
engaged there, nor elsewhere, since their last victory at Blackwater: which Army
(be it spoken without vain glory) is almost double the number the men which you
have in Arms in this Kingdom: and of their valor we presume that the Scots
and your other Forces in Ulster, can give a sufficient testimony of: yet put
the case we had not this Army, yet God be praised this Kingdom, or at least
this part of the Kingdom in our possession is not so ill stored with men nor
our Magazines with Arms and Ammunition, but we could have recruted General
Prestons Army with double the number he lost at Lnishknock: Wherefore ye may
clearly see, it is not the want of men or ammunition that induces us to
Parlee: but if you shall find your hearts so peaceably inclined as to admit of
it, there may be such care taken on both sides for the security of the
Commissioners: and yet no cessation of Arms for the Soldier, till the
Commissioners shall conclude and agree thereunto.

But for the Armies to proceed in any way of hostility to eithers best
advantage notwithstanding the Treaty and yet to be be no prejudice to the
Commissioners of either side.

We also desire that we might have the same privilege as other his Majesty's
Subjects have in the like nature, viz. to send a convenient number of
Commissioners, whom we shall think fit, to London or elsewhere in the Kingdom
of England; and they there to reside as Commissioners to communicate the
weighty affairs of this Kingdom, both to the Kings Majesty and to the
honorable Houses of Parliament there; by which our actions past, and our
future intentions, may be cleared before the face of the world; and that those
blemishes may be taken away from us and our posterities, which some are pleased
to brand us with; and that all men may see that our intentions are only for
peace and unity, that we and the English may again live lovingly together as
friends and fellow Subjects.

But if you think it prejudicial to you to have any number of Commissioners
to go for England; we shall then desire that only two whom we shall appoint,
may have a safe convoy over for England, and so back again, to address
themselves to his Majesty and to the Parliament, and there to endeavor the
procuring of his Majesty's Royal assent, and also the consent of both Houses
of Parliament to such Articles as shall be propounded toward the settlement of
a firm and well grounded Peace in the three Kingdoms; that so we may put a
period to these miserable and bloody distractions that has so long attended on
this deplorable Nation. And that his Majesty with his Royal Consort, and their
Posterity, may enjoy their just Rights and Royal Prerogatives; and the Subject
his just Liberties and Freedom.

Sir this is the desire of the Lords and Commons assembled in the supreme
council of this Kingdom, held at Kilkenny: And if your honor will be pleased
to send your answer, you will engage us to be,

Kilkenny, August 28. 1647. Your Servants, Lodwick O Bourk, Speaker.
