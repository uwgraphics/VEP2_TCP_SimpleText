LONDON, Printed for John Wright, at the Sign of the King's Head in the old
Baily, 1647.

TO The Right Honorable the Lords and Commons in Parliament Assembled.
Right Honorable,
I Have for many years together professed my self a Soldier, and have been
admitted by power flowing from your spring to act in command against the common
Enemy, during these distracted times, which nothing more; desire then so to
continue as far as shall stand good with Gods Divine providence, and this
causes continuance; therefore must crave leave to speak in such language as
affectionate duty can best express it self by tongue: I confess when I
meditate upon the height of your noble spirits, and withal the flatnesse of my
poor abilities; as I present this in love; so with much fear, as having
meddled with the publishing of such a Subject so unconcerning my own quality,
although imboldned by diverse friends to Publish this which I have kept secret
for many years together; but now at last reflecting upon the overture of
things in these distracted times, am imboldened under your Honors favor to
conceive the publishing of such a subject may conduce to the profitting of the
Commonwealth. I am confident the Ancient establishment of the Crown Revenue
Charge of this Kingdom of England, is not unknown to most of your Honors in
all the particulars; yet long time, and the face of war having ruined,
distracted and desolated many of those Ancient particular establishments; few
of them remaining within their bounds without some abuse; which by your great
wisdoms, and pious care is now like to be re-established in all the
particulars, as cannot in the first place but conduce to the good of the
republike, and secondly to the good of all those who are or may be intressed
herein; this then cannot hinder, but rather give light to so honorable a
work: I am for the Soldier, not for the Rhetorician, therefore left my
endeavors convert into a vapor, ere they can reach the height of your merits:
I humbly crave your Honors to cherish them, desiring Almighty God to give your
Honors a happy Issue in all your high concernments; so that you may attain to
that peace so much wished for by your Honors, and prayed for by him that is
your devoted Soldier, now bound for the service in Ireland, to the loss of
the uttermost drop of his blood to serve you,

Lazarus Haward.
