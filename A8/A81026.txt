His Late HIGHNES's LETTER To the PARLIAMENT of ENGLAND.
Showing his Willingness to Submit to this Present Government: Attested under
his Own Hand, and read in the House on Wednesday the 25th of May 1659.
I Have perused the Resolve and Declaration which you were pleased to deliver
to me the other night, and for your Information touching what is mentioned in
the said Resolve, I have caused a true State of my Debts to be transcribed, and
annexed to this Paper, which will show what they are, and how they were
contracted.

As to that part of the Resolve whereby the Committee are to inform themselves
how far I do acquiesce in the Government of this Commonwealth, as it is
declared by this Parliament; I trust my past Carriage hitherto has manifested
my acquiescence in the Will and disposition of God, and that I love and value
the Peace of this Commonwealth much above my own concernments; and I desire
that by this a measure of my future deportment may be taken, which through the
assistance of God shall be such as shall bear the same witness, having I hope in
some degree learned rather to reverence and submit to the hand of God, than to
be unquiet under it: And (as to the late Providence that have fallen out among
us) however in respect of the particular Engagements that lay upon me, I could
not be active in making a change in the Government of these Nations; yet
through the goodness of God I can freely acquiesce in it being made, and do
hold my self obliged, as (with other men) I expect Protection from the present
Government, so to demean my self, with all peaceableness under it, and to
procure to the uttermost of my Power, that all in whom I have any Interest do
the same.

RICHARD CROMWELL.
