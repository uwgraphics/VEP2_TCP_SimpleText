The Faithful FARMER, OR, The Downright VVooing betwixt ROBIN and NANCY.
When he had told her of his store,
she could not him deny;
Alas, what could she wish for more,
then Goods and Loyalty.
To the Tune of O Mother, Roger, etc.
This may be Printed,

R. P.





M^ ^ittle pretty youthful Nancy,
prithee sit down by my side,
There is none but thee I fancy,
for to make my Lawful Bride:
I will make it well appear,
There Is no Farmer far or near,
Has such dainty curious Geer,
Is I have for thee my Dear:
Then prithee Nancy be not Coy,
Then alone shall be my joy.
Give me thy Love, or else an Answer,
thou! art she whom I adore,
Did not you know my good old Grandsir,
he has left me all his store:
Love, I do protest and vow,
I have got a Cart and Plow,
Seven Pigs, besides a Sow,
Dearest, can you love me now?
Then prithee make no more ado,
If thou can love me tell me, true.
I have not told you half my treasure,
love, my portion is not small,
I have riches out of measure,
thou shall be the Dame of all:
There Is a Coffer crammed with Gold,
Besides Silver still untold,
Also Sheep and Lambs in fold,
Most delightful to behold;
If thou to love art now inclind,
I prithee let me know thy mind.
He loved me his darling Robin,
making me his only heir,
Likewise left me Roan and Dobbin,
with his little bob-tail Mare,
When my Graudsir died in peace,
Here he left me ten years lease,
With a flock of Ducks and Geese,
Which does daily still increase,
And therefore now before you go,
If thou can love me tell me so.
Besides, this is not all my Riches,
there is his good old Coat of Buff,
Mounteer Cap, and Buff-Skin Breeches
besides all his Household Stuff:
Pot and Pans, with Piggans too,
All I have i will give to you,
Let us make no more ado,
For I hau't much time to woo:
And therefore now before I go,
If thou can love me tell me so.
But Robin, wherefore should you settle,
love upon so mean a Bride?
Here you talk of Corn and Cattle,
and of twenty things beside:
Therefore when your friends shall know
That you do your self bestow,
On a fortune mean and low,
They will seek my overthrow,
Foe rather be a poor man's wife,
Then live a discontented life.
Sweet love, my Father and my Mother,
they to this will now agree,
For they say above all other,
thou will make a Wife for me:
Therefore dearest be not coy,

Let me now thy love enjoy,
As I am an honest Boy,
There is none shall thee annoy,
I Will tender thee both day and night,
And thou shall have thy hearts delight.
I prithee Nancy don't deny me,
why are you so mild and mute,
If you are resolved to try me,
let us make no more dispute;
Love though I have this Estate,
As I freely do relate,
If thou will but be my Mate,
I Will forsake both Jone and Kate;
though they have House and Land withal,
Yet thou art more to me then all.
The Damsel then that very hour,
her dear Robin did adore,
For she then had not the power,
to deny him any more:
Then his Nancy he did lead
To his Fathers house with speed,
Then their Parents all agreed,
That they should in Love proceed:
Now they no more disputing stand,
Resolve to Marry out of hand.
FINIS.
