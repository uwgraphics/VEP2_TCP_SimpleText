GOOD NEVVES For all true hearted Subjects: VIDELICET, The PARLIAMENT goes on.
Written by FRANCIS MUSSELL, Vintner.
THough Times be troublous, yet true peace I bring
To all who fear God, and obey the King.
This Emblem thus deciphers the intent,
What by the Ensign and the book are meant.
The Ensign clear above his head does flourish,
With joy to show that God his flock does nourish.
The Book presents to us the Truth, in which
We Are taught of God how to be truly rich:
So to exemplify and keep out harms,
Are barricado'd with the City Arms.
Blessed be our God above, whose preservation
Has bin to us, to all men's admiration.
Soli Deo Gloria

GOod news, true hearts, hear this,
And be no longer sad:
Though things have bin amiss,
Yet now we may be glad:
Some were abusive, and too blame,
Yet all shall well e're long
Reformed be, let us bless Gods name:
The Parliament goes on.
Those that have been ill members
In Church and Commonweal,
And proved themselves dissemblers,
Their Knaveries to heal,
Shall plainly be unmaskt, and then
Must suffer for the wrong,
Whereby they have oppressed poor men,
The Parliament goes on.
Some would have brought cursed Popery
Into this blessed Isle,
With Masses, Crosses, Foppery,
'Twas feared, within a while.
Their Beads and Holy Water
Were false, and smelt too strong:
But better news came after:
The Parliament, etc.
No tricks of man's inventions
Can cross our just desires,
Though base be the intentions
Of Jesuits and Friars,
That would obscure, if they knew how,
The truth of every tongue;
But they will be more discovered now:
The Parliament, etc.
Where sneake your lame Projectors
That did men's means devour,
The Commonwealths infectors,
Whilst they had any power.
Poor children often might want their bread,
By tricks they snatched it from
Them; but such Rascals names are spread.
The Parliament, etc.
The Judge unjust does tremble,
When Truth does come to light;
Nor dares stay to dissemble,
But run away by night.
The conscience will declare most clear,
What mischiefs men have done;
For now things plainly do appear,
The Parliament goes on.
Such men as have been faithful
To God, King, State, and Land,
Though vicious men be hateful,
Yet honest men will stand,
To venture coin and goods, nay this,
Their life, even all they can,
For truths sake, and true hearts that wish
The Parliament go on.
Alas we helpless Commons,
Our hearts began to bleed,
To swear to the new Cannons,
Et Caetera, indeed:
We might inthral'd our selves thereby
If such a thread we'ad spun:
But we had grace them to deny,
The Parliament goes on.
Thus were we pincht and streitned,
Nay almost stupify'de
In sense, yet now well wakened
By the true supreme Guide,
Who never any heart forsakes,
Which ever rests upon
God, and his cares to him betakes:
The Parliament goes on.
To take the Protestation, 2 Chr. 15. 2

Good subjects strive and choose;
No friends unto our Nation
I think them that refuse.
Religion must be perfect pure, Iam. 1. 2

Not wavering to turn, Iam. 1. ^

Then God will be with us, Matt* 28. 2
be sure,
The Parliament, etc.
The King, Queen, and royal Progeny,
God bless with many years.
Lord, to this Nation never deny
Good honest noble Peers;
That we reposing all our trust,
In thee may flourish still:
Then all our Foes shall be acurst,
In hatching any ill.
The Members of our Parliament,
Lord give them happy days,
With grace and truth, with one consent,
Direct in all their ways,
That all may for thy glory stand,
Unto Eternity,
Lord crown them in the Blessed Land,
Amen, Amen, say I.
