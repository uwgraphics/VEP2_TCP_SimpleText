AN Jmpartial Narration of the Management of the late Kentish Petition.
ALthough the late Kentish Petition failed in its main aim and intent which was
Peace, yet because it procured strange consequences in reference to the whole
Kingdom, and there has been raised many and several reports of the Management
of that affair in the carrying on of their just Petition (which way of
Address is undoubtedly the Birthright of the Subjects of England, and once
lost, must be succeeded with slavery and Tyranny, both hateful to the English
nation;) I shall faithfully and impartially relate the beginning, progress,
and conclusion of that affair as far as I know, or from credible persons could
learn the particulars thereof.

First, that it was the intent of the Country to carry up that Petition
without Arms, or the least warlike appearance, is Notoriously known to all
that know any thing in that business, and the peaceable entrance of the
Petitioners into that action: But that which caused them to appear in that
warlike posture, was the Printed Declaration with most of the
Deputy Lieutenants hands to them commanded to be read in Churches throughout
the whole County, calling the petitions Seditious Papers, which tended to the
raising seditions and tumults within the said County, and the endeavoring the
promoting thereof Seditious practices; the least of which was most contrary to
their thoughts, who aimed at nothing more then to preserve their and the whole
Kingdoms Birthright, in presenting their just desires in a most peaceable and
usual manner; had not the aforesaid Declarations with other scattered
expressions by some in Authority, of hanging some in every parish that durst
adventure to go up with the Petition; And the raisiing of several Troops of
Horse (which upon good grounds was conceived) to make good those declarations
and expressions (not again to be exampled by any Committee in the Kingdom)
caused the extremely and justly agrieved and incensed Petitioners to take up
Arms for their own defense and preservation of themselves from the sad and
bloody example of their next neighbors the Surrey-men; so freshly bleeding in
their memories: Thus far for their taking up Arms; Next for the progress of
the Petitioners in pursuance of their Petition; They met together upon
Boxley-Heath on Tuseday May the thirtieth, intending the same day for
Black Heath, and ten Gentlemen with ten Yeomen to have gone from thence with
the Petition to the Parliament, in the behalf of all the rest: But an Order
coming from both Houses at that instant to them, that the Houses would receive
none of their Petition, but had referred it and them to the Lord General
Fairfax, who was at that very instant (strange and unexpected to them) drawn up
at Black Heath in a Warlike posture with about four thousand Horse and Foot
with other forces on their March for his recruit; It was thought fit to apply
themselves to the General for his mediation to the Houses that their Petition
might be received; which he refused to do, and choosing the contrary to pursue
them as Rebels: And the Kentish Forces not being complete in their
Field-Officers and others, and some other accomodations necessary, which in so
short time could not be put into so fitting an equipage as was required for an
Army, forced presently to fight, concluded forthwith to retreat their unmembred
body within the River of Med-way; which accordingly they did, for its more safe
modelizing, and their standing on their just defense: But the General finding
them in green Council, and knowing his own advantage in timely pursuing them,
before they were regulated, neglects no time but follows them to Maidstone,
Alsford, Trasum, and Farley-bridge, the chief passes of those parts; which
being kept by too small Parties, for the encountering with the Generals old
Soldiers: On Thursday night following, he fell to storming of Maidstone, which
was so well maintained by part of a Regiment of Trained-bands (who made it good)
that diverse times they repulsed the Enemy out of the Town to their great
loss; and disputed it with them at least six hours, exspecting relief from
General Goring, who had newly received that Title from the Gentlemen then at
Rochester, where the main body of the Kentish Army then lay; but General Goring
either conceiving it too late, or having some other design which was conceived
of more moment (I know not) marching the next day the other way to Black Heath,
and from thence crossing the water into Essex, and sending no relief to those
poor men, (which by their enemies own confession did so gallantly considering
their number and condition) they were forced at last, being over-powr'd with
Horse and Foot all at one time, to submit themselves prisoners, and surrender
the Town to the mercy of the Enemy; which in all likelihood had been made good
and defended from all the power and strength of the Adverse party, had but one
fourth part of the body then at Rochester marched to their relief: And after
all this diaster, had but the whole body advanced down to the Town, they had in
all probability recovered it, redeemed their Prisoners, and made good that
place against any visible power of the enemies; by reason of which advancing of
their new General the contrary way, the Kentish Gentry and Soldiers were so
discontented that they might not March to the rescue of their friends, (and not
knowing the Generals design for such actions of his) as that diverse of them
on a sudden dispersed every way to shift for themselves, crying out they were
betrayed; so that the General carried not over into Essex above fifteen hundred
of all their forces; the rest scattered, except twelve hundred Horse and Foot,
who retreated to Canterbury to make good that place, the three Castles of
Sandown, Deal, and Weymor; and the Town of Sandwich, but for want of men,
Ammunition; and Provision to make good all, leaving the three Castles well
manned and provided, Sandwich besides the wanting of Fortfications and
provisions, being very averse to a concurrence with the County, in respect of a
great part of the Town within, by reason of the faction of the people, which
was much increased by the setting up of an impostor and counterfeit Prince; so
that many families must of necessity have been expulsed the Town, or secured;
and would have required longer time, and the greatest part of the Forces then
in Arms, before it could be made teneable; and Canterbury being then the seat
of the whole Action, which must have been left with all the Country thereabout
by this enterprise to the mercy and spoil of the Enemy) they were forced to
make one body of all their numbers within Canterbury, there resolving to try
their fortunes; to which place the General made with all his strength he had
in that County, which was about four thousand Horse and Foot viz. Colonel
Riches, and Colonel Hewsons Regiments of Horse and Foot sent to relieve
Dover-Castle, and after that, he had Command to make good the East side of the
Town; and then Comissary Ireton's Regiment of Horse, and some other broken
Regiments of Horse, with Colonel Baxsters Regiment of Foot, and part of other
broken Regiments of Foot, (which in all made up the aforesaid numbers of the
General's Forces) beside some Additionall Forces the Deputy Lieutenants of the
County had by this time got together and were in their daily increase; all
which were designed for the reducing of Canterbury, and were within two hours
March of the same on the West side: And therefore to speak a little in
Vindication of those Gentlemen who there Acted, because I have heard several
and some false reports of their proceedings; as that they surrendered the Town
to fifteen hundred, when three thousand were in it; which is very false; for
their Enemies numbers it is most certain, themselves confessing it; into their
numbers must be reckoned women and children to make up the sum of three
thousand, for they had not above thirteen hundred fighting men when the Enemy
came nigh, and they continually lessening by the running away of the Soldiers;
and many that stayed, began to grow discontented for want of pay, and the Town
neither teneable nor provided with victuals; for last Christmas-Gamboll had
burnt up their gates, and made diverse breaches in their walls which were not
yet re-edyfyed; and no hopes of relief from their General my Lord of Norwich,
(who was at that instant in Essex, and necessitated to provide for himself) nor
from any others that might timely do it. It is true indeed, fifteen hundred
only of the Enemies Forces entered the Town, the most of the Forces after the
Articles agreed on, being Commanded several ways, the greatest part into
Essex, the rest to Sandwich, and to make good their siege against
Weymor-Castle: So that all these things truly considered, that the Petition
being only for peace, and the raising of Arms only for their just defense in
the delivering thereof; and no thoughts then of a settled or continued war, till
all the Forces Raised by the Kentish Gentlemen were thus scattered and
dispersed, which was then certainly too late to think upon, in that their
Enemies Forces were then so near them, all relief so far from them, the Town,
by reason of its former defects so untenable, and by reason of its compass
requiring so many to guard it, and their own Forces so unproportionably few to
defend it, their money and provision spent, so that upon necessity they must
maintain the Soldiers upon plundring the provision of the Town; which, was too
so scant, as was not able to maintain so many persons but a very little while,
and the Country not ready to bring in any more; the rich booty in it beside,
which would have been an encouragement to their Soldiary, a discouragement to
the other, especially the Town Forces; whose whole estates were most in danger:
So that these things thus certainly standing, in my opinion you will find that
those Gentlemen who there acted, did as much as possibly in them lay for their
Countries and their own defense as long as there was any hope of life in that
action, and stayed it out to the last when others deserted it, and perhaps
hereby in a Condition rather to take then to make, Articles: To which (though
much prejudicial to themselves and their own benefit) yet out of the deep
sense and feeling of that Rapine and spoil which would inevitably have fallen
upon Rich and poor without exception by the Army, they were now willing to
agree that they might (though 'twere through their own loss) preserve the Town.

The Yeomanry, and poor Laborers from further plundring which must of
necessity have ensued, and yet the issue and conclusion of their best
advantages in that Condition they were in within a very short time in all
humane probability must have proved succeslesse and fruitless. And this I am
assured, by the strict enquiry I have made into that affair is the whole truth
of it, so as I much wonder to hear such Calumny raised by strangers, and
especially by some of their own members, tending to the disparagement of those
Gentlemen, and dis-uniting the Gentry of the County in affection not to be
cemented again, in all likelihood for any Future action of the like nature.

FINIS.
