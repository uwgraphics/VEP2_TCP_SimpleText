GOOD NEWS From the NETHERLANDS, OR A Congratulatory Panegyric, composed by a
true Lover of his King, and Country:
REjoice, brave Brittans now for Charles our King
Is coming home, into his Realms to bring
Peace, Piety, and Plenty, Law and Love,
Religion, Justice, and what else may move
Your hearts to exultations; Trade, and Arts
Shall flourish more then ever, in all parts
Of his Dominions, and we shall be free
As well in Conscience, as propriety;
So that enjoying this sweet liberty
Under his blessed Reign, we shall happier be,
After those Tempests of Intestine Wars,
Than if we never had felt, and worn their scars.
No former Age can boast, since Britain stood,
A Prince more Sweet, more Great in Heart, more Good,
More Wise, more Just, more Tried in all Events
Of various chance: Foreign experience
In State Affairs, in Wars, joined to his own
Rich natural Genius, and his Theory known,
Make him a complete Monarch. Oh! if I
Could tell you with what magnanimity
He bare the rude assaults of adverse fate
When lost in hope, and ruined in Estate,
Yet triumphed by Heroic Patience,
And strong Faith in the Divine Providence,
How like a firm Colossus, still the same,
He stood the Winds which from the North-side came,
You would conclude, that He who could command
Himself so well, can rightly rule the Land,
Yea govern the whole World: Prepare to sing
Poeans of joy then to our Gracious King,
Compose rich Panegyricks to his praise,
And Poets, crown your temples all with Bays,
Cut down your Woods and Forests to make Fires
May flame to Heaven, let Bells ring your desires,
And all your Canons loud proclaim the King,
Open your hands and hearts to bring him in:
Establish him in Power, in Dignity,
And in his lawful just Authority:
Give him his due Prerogative, let him be
No King upon conditions, but Free,
Not Limited, not only Titular,
But Absolute, Himself, and Singular,
For it is a Privilege the Law allows
Unto his Birth, to which it humbly bows:
Rather add to the Flowers of his Crown,
Then take from thence, and purchase a Renown
Shall never die: This glorious work thus done,
Thus perfected, with a Beam of the Sun
Shall be subscribed, shall make you great in fame,
And great in fortune, rich in a fair name
Of Loyal Subjects, which shall ever be
Entailed on you, and your posterity:
Give now your Votes to this, express your joy
Of heart, and cry with me, Vive le Roy.
W. L.
