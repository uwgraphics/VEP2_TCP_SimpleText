LONDON. Printed in the Year, 1649.

A DECLARATION Of the Noble Knights, Sir MARMADUKE LANGDALE, AND Sir LEWIS
DIVES, etc.
BY virtue of two Commissions dated at Hague, 5. June 1649. directed to us from
our dread Sovereign Lord, CHARLES, of that name the SECOND, by the grace of
GOD, KING of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland, Defendor of the Faith:
Whereby we were enjoined to make our speedy repair to the Isle of Man, and
there to give our best assistance both in Counsel and Personal Service, to the
Right Honorable, JAMES, Earl of Darby, the true and noble Lord thereof, in
keeping of that Island for His MAJESTY'S service, wherein was sweetly and
consequently involved, the defense of the true Protestant Religion, in
substance and form as it was professed in the days of Queen Elizabeth, King
James, and King Charles the First, Princes of blessed and glorious memory; the
establishing His Majesty in His Thrones, invested with His just Power and
Greatness, from which He is most injuriously and traitorously kept; the
restoring Parliaments to their ancient Privileges, which are most violently
broken; the maintenance of the fundamental Laws most strangely violated, and
redeeming the people, now most barbarously vassalaged, to their ancient
Freedom; and lastly, the bringing to justice the Murderers of the KING His
Father, which horrid and salvage act, we protest before God and the whole
world, we abhor from our souls, and tremble to hear of: In obedience to
which high Command, and at the serious persuasions of our judgments and
consciences, with all convenient speed, we made our repair to the Isle of Man.
Where we found the Right Honorable, the Earl of Darby (who gave us very
respective and cheerful entertainment) and whose fidelity, and loyalty, we
must ever acknowledge and admire; contesting and struggling with the tedious
temptations and importunate solicitations of one Henry Ireton, who pretends
himself to be Commissary General to that Army under the Command of Thomas,
Lord Fairfax, to whom, in the name of the Parliament of England, as he is
pleased to call that Juncto at Westminster, he required this Island to be
delivered; and for his Lordships encouragement therein, he was promised an Act
of Indemnity for what he had formerly acted, in relation to His late Majesty's
service, and to be repossessed of his whole Estate without Composition: In
assurance of his Lordships scorn and odium whereof, his Lordship was pleased
to show us the Copy of a Letter, which two days before our arrival, he had
returned by Ireton's Messenger for their final Answer: which Letter, (the
testimony of his honor and loyalty) we read over with very much alacrity: and
advised his Lordship to print it together with a Declaration, for satisfaction
of His Majesty and His three Kingdoms; and to clear his honor of that
blemish, with which some malecontented persons might possibly endeavor to
stain it.

In pursuit of which counsel, his Lordship was pleased forthwith to draw up a
Declaration, which, together with the forementioned Letter, was speedily
dispatched to London and committed to the Press, where, as appears by some of
them, that have since come to our hands, it was printed without the least
adulteration; and, whereas to our grief we have since heard, that there are
some that have not been wanting, with very much confidence to report, that it
was a mere fiction, contrived by some Mercury, to delude the people, and was no
whit the sense of the Earl of Darby: To which we here declare, that we verily
believe, that report to be framed in the Juncto, or by some of their Adherents,
to deceive the people, (whom his Lordship was pretended to delude) that so they
might encourage their Abettors, and discourage His Majesty's loyal Subjects
from repairing hither to our assistance: And though it is very probable, that
our Enemies will by the same device endeavor to darken the credit of this our
present Declaration, yet they shall assuredly find the contents of both
fulfilled in our faithful keeping this Island for His Majesty's best
advantage, and their worst offense; and we hope, that though our Enemies do
find encouragement in their misbeliefe hereof, yet our loyal-hearted Friends
will be no ways over-swayed by doubt or the credit of their report, but will
with speed and cheerfulness repair hither to an unanimous conjunction with us,
where they shall find such encouragement as his Lordship promised, and with
magnanimity and honor we will resolutely unite our daring Spirits to the
final overthrow of the Rebels interest, and their tyrannical power both by
Sea and Land.

And now we cannot but express, with how deep a sense of our Native Countries
miseries our souls are affected, nor can we but lament the condition of
posterity, whose Fathers have shamefully forfeited the ancient and glorious
Liberty which was purchased by their Forefathers; and left them bound in the
fetters of a most miserable bondage: nor can we believe but that many of those
men, who were, in the beginning of these unhappy Divisions between KING and
Parliament, carried away from their Loyalty by an overmuch credulity to their
fair and plausible pretenses, have been long since sensible that it was their
own ambitious ends they then prosecuted, and not the welfare of the now
miserable Kingdom; nor can we but admire, nor could we have believed, (had we
not been the fad Witnesses thereof) that any men could be so strangely
impudent, as to act so flat contrary to all their Oaths, Covenants, Vows,
Protestations and Declarations, to continue the Government of the Kingdom, and
the just Power and Prerogative of the KING and His Posterity, in the perfect
fullness of their due glory and splendor; and yet notwithstanding all this,
overthrow the very foundation of Government, decapitate the KING, and cashiere
His Posterity; and with salvage barbarity declare and proclaim [that it shall
be lawfuull for any Man to surprise and kill our present dread-Soveraigne the
KING, and His Princely Brother the DUKE of York, as Traitors and Spies,
wherever they shall meet them within the limits of these Kingdomes] such a
piece of Treason, as we are confident, the most horrid, monstrous, and
execrable Traitors that ever trod upon the face of the Earth would have
blushed to have owned; nor is this all, but even in the first year of Englands
Freedom, (according to their own style) after they have drained the Kingdom
of its treasure, by their strange and unheard of ways for the raising of
moneys, and notwithstanding the many and great Compositions which they have and
daily do receive, the sale of the Jewels and other ornaments of State, the
King, Queen, Dukes, Bishops, Deanes and Chapters Lands, besides His Majesty's
Customs, yet to continue the Excise, and beyond all that, to impose and
continue an illegal Tax; and so great as was never yet imposed in the time of
most urgent necessity since the Norman Conquest; and beyond all this, have
brought in a most arbytrary and tyrannical Government, in taking away the
Lives of their Sovereign and His Peers by new and illegal Courts; and have
drawn the Freeborne People of England in to a most miserable bondage and
slavery, far worse than the Turks, or any Nation under the Sun.

And as in State they have overthrown all good and wholesome Government, so
likewise in Church they have shut out all decent and uniforme order, and let in
a general and loathsome confusion; having imprisoned and sequestered all the
Reverend, learned, and orthodox Divines, and suffer in their places, none but a
peevish ignorant, and factious Clergy, who flatter them in their iniquities,
and delude the people in abusing the sense of holy Writ, and preaching nothing
but Rebellion and sedition; so that in stead of the ancient Rites of the
Church, the Divine Service, wholesome Doctrines and holy Sacraments, which they
have quite cast out as Popish, Superstitious, and Antichristian, they have
introduced nothing but factions, seditions, schisms, heresies, and
unparalleled blasphemies both against the Lord and his Anointed, and have
granted a general toleration of all Religions, and (as we hear) have not only
permitted, but ordered the Turkish Alchoran to be printed in English: and
notwithstanding the many scandals that they have often cast upon His late
Majesty's reputation for upholding the Irish Rebellion, they have entered into a
League and Confederacy with Owen Roe Oneale, that barbarous and bloody Rebel,
to destroy all the honest and loyal Protestants; so that the world may plainly
see that they have cheated them with their hypocritical pretenses to Religion,
Fastings and Thanksgivings, not regarding Oaths, Covenants, Protestations nor
Declarations, nor caring what damnable designs they pass to the support of
their rebellious interest: so that by Sacrilege, Rebellion, Murder, Perjury,
Theft, Oppression, Tyranny and Regicide, they have couzened the people of their
ancient Laws and Liberties, and subjected them to the miserable slavery of
their tyrannical wills.

And now we do declare, that in the beginning of unhappy differences being
fully satisfied of the justness of His late Majesty's cause, in our judgments
and conscience, according to our duty and allegiance we took up Arms on His
Majesty's Party, where we continued faithfully, acting to the utmost of our
power what ever might make for His Majesty's advantage, and have since
manifested our unstained Loyalty in our patient sufferings, not having
neglected any thing even in our most clouded condition, which might renew His
Majesty's interest in the Field: and we do protest in the presence of Almighty
God, that we shall always use the same fidelity and industry in the trust
reposed in us by our present dread Sovereign, holding our selves bound in the
same bonds of fealty to His Majesty that we were to the late King His Father,
of ever blessed yet bleeding memory; nor shall we lay down Arms, but by Gods
assistance faithfully and resolutely pursue His Majesty's Enemies, till we have
reduced all that are in Rebellion to their due obedience, brought the Murderers
of His late Majesty to speedy and impartial justice, and absolutely destroyed
their interest both by Land and Sea: nor can we imagine but that all honest men
who have any sense of His Majesty's sufferings, their own loyalty, and their
Countries misery, will cheerfully give their assistance both in purse and
person, in carrying on this pious and honorable Engagement, wherein is so
deeply concerned maintenance of the true Protestant Religion, the preservation
of His Majesty's Royal Person from murder, together with His just Rights and
Prerogatives, the Privileges of Parliaments, the Law of the Land, the Liberty
of the Subject, and the suppression of Rebellion; not questioning but that God
will at length own his own cause, and remove all those clouds which have
hitherto darkened the splendour thereof, that so its true luster may plainly and
fully appear to the eye of every man's judgment, to his own glory, His
Majesty's honor, and the good of the people.

From Douglas in the Isle of Man. August the 5. 1649.
