Son, Servant, and Supplicant for the CHVRCH of ENGLAND: In behalf of many
thousands his distressed Brethren (Ministers of the Gospel, and other good
Scholars) who were deprived of all public employment, (as Ministers, or
Scholars) by His DECLARATION, JAN. 1. 1655.

Milbourn for Andrew Crook, at the Green-Dragon in Pauls-Church-yard, 1659.

THE PUBLISHER TO THE READER.
FInding by better judgments than my own, that this following Petitionary
Remonstrance, to his late Highness O. P. (then in power) was not only a modest
and charitable Address, seasonable at that time, and safe at all times; but
also prudentially pious and politic; so as it may be of good use in these
times; I have presumed to make it public; Not but I know, that it was at
first written with an intent to conceal it from all eyes, but those to which
it was at first presented, (which are now buried, as all humane glory will be,
in dust and darkness) yet perceiving that, as a Jewel, it still retained its
native lusture; and might well fit the dark, and dubious condition, wherein
most Ministers in England, are thought to stand (or rather to fall) as to their
liberty and livelihood; beside their reputation, and respect; All which seem to
be at a very low ebb, but on a dangerous precipice, and downfall, If some men
may have their will; I supposed this piece, might in no less be acceptable,
than seasonable to all ingenious Christians, and worthy Readers; who still
preserve any love, and respect to the flock of God, and the glory of our
Israel: I mean the Reformed Religion, of the Church of England, and the faithul
Ministry of it, to whom I profess my self a most affectionate friend and
servant.

. Whose common dangers and disadvantages, ought with reason to invite them
prudently and speedily to compose their private differences, least while they
scramble, as boys, for the nuts of petty opinions, and some formal shadows of
Religion, they (and we) lose the main substance, and grand essentials of it,
not only as to holy discipline order and government, (which must first begin
among Ministers themselves) but also as to true worship, sound doctrine, and
sober reformation, which they cannot but see, and many of them confess, to be
much upon the decline and abatement, both as to sanctity and solemnity: That I
mention not Ministers own secular interests, as to honest subsistence, and
civil respects, which no ingenuous men can well want, and no wise man will
supinely neglect.

. This is most certain, that Ministers divisions do mainly advance, as the
peoples distractions, so their own diminution and destruction; for their
factions and fewds among themselves, serve only as rougher hones, or
whetstones, to set sharper edges on the swords and sythes of their enemies,
whose desolating and implacable spite, will never be stopped or resisted,
unless grave and godly Ministers, of all sides, be so far blessed of God, as
(first) to recover their reason and reputation, in point of piety and policy,
prudence and charity, by mutual correspondencies and closures, so as to
concenter in some uniform way of Church Government and Order: united, they
would be as venerable, as, scattered, they are contemptible, like figures or
ciphers, they would signify much in their conjunction, little or nothing in
their separation.

. From hence (in the second place) they would appear to the world, not only as
petty Presbyters, or Predicants, single and apart, but as a grave and Venerable
Society, and combination of learned and wise men, worthy to manage religious
concernments, and to enjoy public encouragements, from those that may have at
any time Supreme Power in their hands, who will always have so much, either
piety or policy in their hearts, as impartially to dispense Justice and rewards
to able, peaceable, and orderly Ministers, as well as to any other sort of
deserving men, that are in any Civil or Military employment.

. Considering, that the Nation of England never owed to any calling of men,
more, either of its happiness or misery, than to its Clergy or Ministry, under
whatever Laws or forms they may pass: Indeed they always have had, and ever
will have, great influence on the fate and fortunes of any people that are
Christian, whose consciences first, then their estates, at last their peace and
safety (public as well as private) are so far, either maintained or
undermined by their Ministers, as these find themselves either favored and
honored, or depressed and debased, being men, that commonly have not only a
good opinion of themselves, but very quick resentments of things, apt both for
their pragmatique, and speaking vein, to have a notable bias and stroke upon
men's minds, and so upon public affairs, by their tongues and pens, besides
their more solemn preachings and prayings, with a devout insinuation into men's
and women's consciences, among whom they have so much of civil and religious
converse.

. Hence it is, that poverty and despiciency cast upon the Ministry, makes them
either silly sots, and abject slaves, or else so far unquiet, as they are
sensible of, and dissatisfied with their condition: And how (indeed) can such
men, as think themselves fit to be public Pilots of Religion, and Conducters
of Souls to heaven, be much concerned in the civil peace or safety of that
Ship, (or Commonwealth) (how rich soever it be) where they see themselves so
pitifully imbarqued, and poorly entertained in it, that they may well hope for
better prize and pillage in the common shipwreck, than for pay or profit, by
any voyage that it makes, wherein they are employed indeed as Predicants, but
yet kept under as Mendicants, not permitted to have any joint stock, or
venture, either of honor, or estate considerable.

. Therefore wise men conclude it undoubtedly best, in point of State Policy,
either to have no able and learned Ministers at all, whose education makes them
men of parts and spirit; a project which will soon amount to no Religion at
all, at least no Christian, and to be sure, no Reformed Religion, justly so
called; for this (as times now are, full of Religious, as well as civil wars)
must ever be strongly guarded, and stoutly maintained by a Spiritual Militia of
well-paid, and well-fed, well-learned, and well-armed Ministers, else London
will soon run to Rome, and the Thames submit to Tyber, which is the (...) by
some men.

. On the other side, it will be Policy, no less than Piety, to entertain such
able Scholars, and worthy Ministers, so as becomes men of good learning,
useful parts, and exemplary lives, in order to maintain the Reformed Religion,
which is the interest of this Nation, both secular and spiritual, civil and
conscientious: To which I may justly add, that grateful respect which is due to
the Sanctity and Majesty of that God and Savior, whom able Ministers
powerfully preach, and people sincerely profess, carrying with them those
inestimable and eternal blessings, which are only to be had ordinarily by those
holy duties, which good Ministers worthily perform; and those Venerable
Mysteries which they duly celebrate and dispense.

. All which sacred and grave concernments of Gods Glory, and men's Souls, your
ignorant, mechanic, and hedgecreeping Teachers; your popular, poor, and
Parasitick Preachers; your under-bred and under-fed Orators; your (...)
Equally, illiterate, impudent, and ridiculous Praters, will infallibly
prostitute, not only to Jesuitick jeers, and Romish deision, but to all peoples
vilifyings. and contempts, who easily follow those inbred principles, and
impulses tending to licentiousness, profaneness, or superstition, which makes
all men (without Gods Grace) no less opposite to the true power of Preachers,
(as Authoritative Bishops, and Pastors of Souls) than to the Power of
Preaching; that is, to the Power of Godliness.

. The aim therefore of this Preface, (full of respect and love to that Holy
Calling by which my Soul has profited) is only to persuade all able Scholars,
and worthy Ministers, of all sides, to such wise and Brotherly Agreements among
themselves, as may by joint Counsels, most conduce to their own honor and
safety, as well as the public peace and satisfaction, least all of them in
their dispersions, and mutual depressions (one after another) come to drink of
that same bitter cup, which so many of their Brethren lately did, in great
measure, whose cause was so freely pleaded by the Author of this Work, while
many others with dumb and dry eyes looked on.

. I passionately deprecate the like distresses falling on any those Ministers,
who were either occasioners, or pittiless Spectators of their own Brethrens
sore afflictions. The ambition of my prayer is, that all worthy Ministers may
not only in their private places demean themselves, in all things, as become
learned, pious, and prudent men: But further, that they may be so much favored
of God and man, as to have the freedom of public Synods and Conventions, for
their better understanding of each other in truth and love: In such
conspicuities, no doubt, they will appear to all good Christians of the
Reformed Religion, every way worthy of all public countenance and
encouragement, that Christian Magistrates may own and entertain them as
Christian Ministers, subjects (indeed) as to Civil Power, in all things just
and honest, yet still as Christ's Agents, and Gods Ambassadors, sent as from
Heaven to treat with sinful mortals, in order to their eternal life and peace,
Under which names, (of public Agents and Ambassadors) all persons are
handsomely and honorably received, and used, by people not wholly barbarous,
although they come but from petty Princes, and mean Seigniories, and (possibly)
upon business of no great concernment, further than wonted forms and ceremonies
of State, which have usually more of the craft and policy of Spies, than of the
truth and reality of friends. But the design of Ministers is to promote that
one thing necessary, the great and eternal interest of saving souls.

. Till Christianity seems a fable, and Christ Jesus be thought an Impostor, his
sacred Ministry and true Ministers will be in request among good Christians,
especially if they would add to the certainty of their message and Commission,
the order, unity, and authority of their Ordination or Mission, which would be
much to their own Honor, and the peoples satisfaction, that we might know of
whom we have and receive the Mysteries of Christ's Kingdom. Indeed, by this
means, they would every way render, not only their pains and persons, but their
Profession and Calling, most considerable to the Public; redeeming themselves
by mutual advice and assistance, from plebeian softness, as well as servility:
Their solitude makes them so fearful, and so servile, if they had not been
scattered, they could not have been thus worried. And if some of them had not
stooped so much as Camels to vulgar compliances, mean people had not so much
got upon their backs, or loaded them (as they have) a long time with poverty,
reproach, and contempt, so far as in them lies: They will never be
considerable, till they are unanimous and uniform, in the main of their
Religion, Reformation, and Function, which I heartily pray for, as a principal
foundation of their own, and all the Nations welfare, which deserves not to be
happy, while their able Ministers are miserable: Nor can it indeed be other
than miserable, till worthy Ministers of the Gospel are happily settled, and
worhily treated. Farewell.

TO HIS HIGHNESS OLIVER, Lord Protector, etc.
SIR,
NExt to a just Zeal for Gods Glory, The Religious motives to this Address.
and a grateful recognition of my Saviors sufferings; the sense I have of
Gods undeserved indulgence to my self, and the Compassions I own for other men's
Calamities: These have put me upon this adventure, of presenting your Highness
with this Petitionary Remonstrance; In which, having no confidence of any
particular Interest in your Highnesses favor, proportionable to such an
Intercession, I have yet taken upon me so much Pious presumption, as to tender
it to your Highness in their Names, and for their sakes, who are the great
Preservers, and Redeemers of Men.

. Which service of Charity I may, and ought to perform with the more ingenuous
freedom, because I am not involved in the Distress, as to my particular
condition, which deserves to be miserable, if I had an Heart that could not be
moved, or durst not take the boldness to move your Highness, The sad occasion
of it. Ministers distresses.
in behalf of many my Fathers and Brethren; my Betters and Equals, learned,
peaceable, pious, and industrious Ministers, with other good Scholars, whom
your Highnesses late Thunderbolt has so stricken and astonished, as they are
filled with grief to an Horror, and with dejection to a Despair; (Passions
(like Hell torments) not conceiveable by any but those, who are involved in the
same gulf of Calamity!) while they not only fear, but evidently see themselves
(with their nearest and dearest Relations) suddenly condemned by your
Highness's late Edict of Jan. 1. (after so many years sufferings) to be for
ever either sadly indigent, or sordidly employed; or (which is worse to
ingenuous men) to be supinely idle, as having nothing left, or allowed them to
do, deserve or enjoy in any public way agreeable to their liberal Education,
and learned Abilities: Consequently, little or nothing can be left them to
feed, clothe, and comfortably maintain themselves, and their Families; most of
them being but poor men as to their temporal estates, (though many of their
Souls are rich Mines of knowledge, grace, and all Virtue) having chiefly lived
heretofore by Gods Blessing, and this Nations bounteous Reward upon their
Learned Industry; in which consists the whole stock, and patrimony of most
Ministers and Scholars; whose trading for wisdom commonly marrs their market
for all other gain, further than what the Churches Patrimony, and the States
Munificence may afford them.

. Compassion no Conspiracy.
Whose Tragique terrors, and impending miseries so imediately, and inevitably
menacing them, I cannot but Remonstrate with a charitable fervor, yet with all
due respect to your Highness: Not as hereby symbolishing with, or abetting any
of these my Brethren, in any ways mis-becoming Pious and Prudent men; but only
as sympathising with such deserving persons in their undeserved consternations,
which they conclude to be sad forerunners of such dreadful distresses, as must
needs drive them, and their whole Families upon the rocks and precipices of
utter ruin; unless the mercy of God, by your Highnesses Benignity, be pleased
so to interpose, as to preserve them, and theirs from these multi-forme
miseries, which are in the face of Famine, and those necessities which attend
that extreme poverty, with which they are threatened.

. Upon what account Ministers are thus afflicted anew.
All which cannot but be the more grievous to learned, grave, and ingenuous
Ministers, by how much they were now less expected, or upon any new account,
as they humbly conceive, deserved by them. As for the old score of Malignity
imputed to them, either (for their adherency to the Constitutions of the Church
of England, or their Loyalty to their Sovereign) they justly hoped; that the
many difficulties already sustained by them; the infinite diminutions, which
(not in the way of Law, but of Arms and force) have exhausted them. The
Iliaedes of miseries, which for many years have oppressed them upon that
account, or Cause, Their former great sufferings upon the old account of
Malignancy.
(in which they were not active, or militant, but only passive, and constant,
to the persuasions of their Consciences;) which yet exposed them to the
spoiling of their goods, to the sequestring of their Estates; to the loss of
their Libraries, which were their Mines and Treasuries; to the charge and
squalor of Imprisonments; to long Absentments from their nearest Relations; or
(upon their Releasemen) to the sad spectacles of their Families, and their own
innumerable Calamities, even to extremities of want. Horrors sufficient (God
knows) to cast ingenuous, and tender minds into such Agony's of dejection and
despair, as nothing but an Angel from Heaven, or some special measure of Grace,
was capable to preserve them from cursing the day of their Birth, and the way
of their Breeding; yea, from Blaspheming God, and dying; as Jobs wife most
unadvisedly advised her afflicted Husband, when she saw his Integrity was no
security from extreme, and undeserved miseries.

. Their former imputed faults may seem expiated by their past afflictions.
Those innumerable distresses which have formerly pressed upon most of these
Ministers (ever since they applied themselves to that cause, or cross rather,
on which they have for some years past been nailed, and crucified) those they
hoped might (even in the rigor, and extremity of justice) have sufficed to
have expiated any former Offenses, or Jealousies taken up against them, during
the heat of the late unhappy War; which made them criminals, or guilty rather
by prejudices, providence, and preventions, than by any depravednesse of
minds, or immorality of manners ever proved against them.

. What ever just blame, Their Plea as to the point of Malignancy imputed to
them.
or sinister censure they had thus incurred upon those former seores; yet they
presumed, since their punishment had been greater than their iniquity, all
would now in the cool of the day have been looked upon as many ways venial,
and excusable in them. Considering,

First, That the cause whereto they adhered, In their Consciences.
and for which they suffered, was adopted by them without any perverse
Principles, or sinister ends: only following (bona fide) that light of
Conscience, which seemed to them most clearly to shine from Gods Word, from the
practice of Primitive Christians, and the Laws of the Land: All which taught
them Loyalty, as a part of Christian Religion, and non-resistence of lawful
Sovereign Power, as an indispensable duty of Christian subjects; only they had
not been Catechized in such Salvoes, and State-distinctions as afterward were
found out by other men, who seemed no less tender, and solicitous for their
own Consciences.

Secondly, As to their patience, and silence.
Since God saw fit to confute their secular confidences of any cause; and to
teach them higher wisdom by afflictions, (which in the justest cause of men
can never be injust, as from the hand of God) they have only behaved
themselves, as humble, and silent sufferers; patiently enduring: and devoutly
undone: Not bitterly querulous; nor pragmatically perturbing the public
tranquillity; living in ways many of them, (though very able and ample men) as
little to be envyed, as much to be pitied; taking great pains for small gain,
contented with such poor pittances, as are the refuse of others, lately their
inferiors, but now possessed of their livings; out of which they hardly allow
to their sequestered Brethren their miserable Fifts. Only their humility and
content made every condition a competency; yea they rejoiced in their
obscurity, as hoping it was accompanied, with less envy and more safety.

. Their Plea for the benefit of the Act of Oblivion.
Yet after all these meritorius miseries, so modestly endured; after the noises
and tumult of war so much allayed: after an ACT of OBLIVION, happily passed
(which they say owed much to your Highness's equanimity and policy) after other
men of all sorts, have been permitted to enjoy the benefit of Composition and
restitution to their estates; except only Ministers to their Ecclesiastical
livings; (Their Sequestrations proving Deprivations for the most part: and
their Purgatory is become an Hell.) After the Storm was well over, and the
bitterness of death seemed past; after these poor Ministers had gained some
little planck or rafter, possiblely a little refuse living: or a Curateship, or
a School; or a Lecture, or some Chaplains place in a Gentleman's house, by which
to save themselves from utter shipwreck and sinking; yet still (beyond any
other rank of men, of the same persuasions) they are now alarumed a fresh;
exposed to new conflictings with that armed man; forced to undergo again, the
heat and burden of the day, as to man's wrath, and jealously; whose very mercys
may seem cruelty, and their sparing of their lives thus long, great severities;
Their Distresses. more bitter than Death.
while they are now brought, not to the Tarpeian Rock, whence by a sudden
principitation, an end might be put to all their miseries, with their lives;
But like Prometheus, they are bound alive with fatal Chains to the mountain
Caucasus: where condemned to be idle, the vulture of famine, and all worldly
calamities must be ever preying upon the bowels of themselves, their Wives and
Children, being only suffered to survive their miseries, as men hung alive in
Chains, and forced with their relations either to beg, steal, or starve.
Thus, thus, after the voice of peace, was again heard in the land, and every
man had begun to gather up his affairs, from the scattering of war: yet now
are these poor men, Sequestered Ministers, and other ejected Scholars, condemned
to be utterly cast out of all as unsavory salt, by a most severe abdication,
and as it were postliminious proscription, forbidding any man to receive them
by any hospitable or charitable reception, so as to officiate, and merit any
subsistence in their callings, either as Preachers, or Teachers, though it be
but of children in a Blefry, or private Family.

A Tragedy (my Lord) so Tragical in the first aspect of it, The dreadfulnesse
of the Tragedy, which threatens them.
and so killing in the letter, that in earnest if (as a desolating storm) it
should be rigorously executed, upon so many learned and Godly men, together
with the many modest Matrones their Wives, and their many hopeful, as well as
harmless children, it is not possible to express the bitter cries, and sad
lamentations, with which it will fill the land, and all men's Hearts, that have
any thing Christian or humane in them.

So that if your Highness should be inexorable, and unremissive, as one that
neither hears nor regards, the cries of so many poor Creatures: If their
tears flowing night and day, should only fall upon flints and nether-
milstones, as to other men's hearts, (where iniquity abounding, Their recourse
to the Divine Mercy.
charity must needs grow cold) there will be no way left but to fly to God;
Their just and bitter complaints, will certainly pierce the Heavens; and move
his compassion, who is a lover of Mankind, both in grace, and nature; whom
nothing more provoke to hear the Prayers of the Oppressed then the deafness of
men: Humane (or rather unhumane) cruelties by a kind of Antipathy or
repercussion excite the divine mercies, as things that meet with the hardest
repulse, and resistances downwards, do usually make the greatest rebounde and
ascent upwards, so do the cries of the desolate and greatly afflicted, when not
regarded by men in Power.

. Be pleased to know, Their trust in God for Grace.
that the Faith of these good men (who no doubt are dear and precious to God as
his Jewels) is yet so much above their fears, and sufferings as to believe
that the Lords Ear is not heavy, that he cannot hear, nor his hand shortened,
that he will not help those who trust in him, and cry unto him in the
bitterness of their souls: though the Vine, and Olive, and Fig Tree fail them,
yet God will not: though the arm of fleshly power, be either withered and
shrunck; or sireched out against them, and lie heavy upon them, yet God will
not utterly forsake those, whose hearts are not only upright before him: but
endued by him, with many excellent, and special gifts, useful for his glory,
and his Churches good; besides those many Christian graces, which are daily
increased, as well as excercised by such sore afflictions, and fiery trials;
wherein they know as the Lord can purify them, so he can protect them, either
from them, or in the midst of them, as he did the Three Children when they were
cast into the Furnance seven times hotter then ordinary; he can and will save
their precious Souls though the dunghill be their Death bed; as is now
threatened to many of these poor, but Pious men.

Yet we know the Lord can stir up some merciful Obediahs to feed these
distressed Prophets in their caves, For ways of Relief.
and Obscurities; and if such merciful men be perished from the earth, either
for want of ability, or heroic charity, yet there may be some merciful ravens
(men otherwise rapacious and tenacious enough) who shall feed these hungry
Elias's, to the just reproach of those men, who being great pretenders to
Godlyness, and reformation, (the truth of which is inseparable from charity,
relief of the poor, and releasing the oppressed) do (yet) deny bread to men of
understanding; and ingenuous employment to persons of such holy, and honest,
and useful industry; and this in a land of plenty, not only for bodily food,
but also for spiritual work, where the harvei of souls is great and able
laborers not too many; good Scholars being as necessary as Soldiers: and
faithful Ministers, no less deserving their Salaries than Military men; These
will have their wages though they do not much work; the other would be glad to
have leave to work, that they might deserve and enjoy their wages.

But because we must not tempt God by expectance of miraculous reliefes, Their
recourse to his Highnesses Clemency.
till we have tried all ways of ordinary providence, and find them obstructed;
I have thought it my duty, to use this most probable means to obtain your
Highnesses favor, toward these worthy men; that they may have leave to tread
out the corn, without having their mouths thus muzled; that they may, as well
Preach, as live Christ crucified, showing others the benefit of his Cross, as
well as bearing it themselves; That they and theirs may not be starved for want
of bodily Food, while they are able, and willing to dispense the Bread of
Heaven, and food of Souls, which is the glorious Gospel of Jesus Christ: being
Persons of no scandalous convictions, either for inabilities, or immoralities:
Having no other imputation on them, but only some State-jealousies, and
Political-Disputes. In which, although they may possibly be still less
satisfied in their Judgments and Consciences; yet they know how with prudence
to be silent, and with peaceablenesse to live in all Godliness and Honesty.

For such men, Plea for such worthy men, presumed not unacceptable to his
Highness.
and Ministers, why should I be afraid, by a Charitable, and in-offensive
importunity, to solicit either your Highnesses Clemency, (if they may have
seemed heretofore to deserve such multiplied and renewed severities) or your
Equanimity and Justice? if they never have, nor do deserve so hard measure as
this return both of their sin and punishment, after they once had public
Pardon, and never since Offended. This I do with the more courage, and
confidence, because I well consider how bold and welcome we poor sinful
wretches are to the Throne of Gods Grace, when we bring no other plea for
Mercy, (as from our selves) but only the sense of our miseries; the conscience
of our sins, and the confession of our unworthiness.

. Nor are the timorous reserves, or over cautious, The cautions silence of
many, in behalf of these Ministers.
and uncharitable costivenesse of other men, any damp or remora, but rather a
spurr, and impulse to me. I see how many of all sorts daily pass by the
distressed Ministers of England, as the Levite, Priest and Pharisee did by the
wounded man, unconcerned: afraid to have any regard to them, or any compassion
for them; what their charity dares only whisper to themselves; or, it may be,
with some hard speeches, and odious reflections, jealously suggest to your
Highness that have I undertaken, by Gods help, freely, and fully, to represent
to You, that so your Highness may not be ignorant, nor remorselesse as to
their calamitous condition; which is like to be such, that of all Men, they are
indeed condemned to be the most miserable in this world; if the want of all
things can make those miserable, who want not the continual feast of a good
Conscience, and the support of Gods Spirit to be patient.

. But, because I know that great Statists, and wise Politicians, Two Reasons of
State considered, as grounds of the Declaration against Ministers.
do not lightly apply so public, and sharp severities in the method of
Government, but either they aim at, First, exemplary punishing former
Offenses: Or, secondly, at preventing future Insolences, which may endanger
public safety: (For private Feuds, and personal despights, or revenges upon
any men, that are subject to their power, are impotencies, or passions, most
unworthy of great and valiant Spirits, and not incident to them, because much
below them.). Give me leave to Remonstrate to your Highness, That the exercise
of such Charity, Clemency, and Equanimity, as is desired by me, for such worthy
Ministers, and other Scholars, can no way either, First, abate that Prudent
Justice, which must punish Offenders, to preserve the Innocent in peace: Nor
secondly, can it encourage, for the future, such licentiousness, or
presumption, as may any way endanger that public tranquillity which your
Highness professed to me was your impartial, and highest design in
Government, in which all honest men of all Principles, and Persuasions might
enjoy themselves in peace.

. First, As to the first point of punitive State Policy; First, as to punitive
Justice for past Offenses.
I humbly conceive it was not so much an Act of Justice and Legality. as of
Military caution, and prevention, while the Interest of Parties were sadly
divided in War; which at first inflicted so great losses and restraints, as
upon others, so upon many Learned, Grave, and godly Ministers; not as
Penalties, but Securities. And certainly, those principles, or persuasions,
which first lead them to undergo so many Miseries, by the improsperity of that
Cause, to which they chose to adhere, (holding themselves obliged thereto in
Conscience by the Laws of God and Man;) these can in no Justice of God or Man,
deserve to be always so sorely punished. However (possibly) in reason of
State, it might for a time be rather necessary, than just, that they should be
restrained, or weakened, flagrante bello; during the hot fits, and Paroxysms of
war, not quia nocuerunt, but ne nocere possint.

. Past Offenses more than sufficiently punished.
Yet when this Rivalry, jealousy, and contest by Arms was once decided, and
public Oppositions were reduced to public Subjections, certainly such as
were at first sufferers only by way of caution, and prevention, do not want
very just Pleas now for their liberty, and present indemnitie, notwithstanding
their supposed Constancy to their former Principles: of which, as no wise man
is concerned to be curiously inquisitive, so they cannot be injurious to any
public Power, and Peace, so long as they are modestly smothered, and
in-offensively silenced in their own Breasts or Consciences, whose Dictates,
your Highness knows, are not under any man's Empire: Whether men's private
Persuasions are to be made public Offenses.
The ablest men cannot change their Opinions when they will, nor will honest
men pretend a Change where is none. Since then their former Sufferings were
made use of for the security of that side, which now prevails sufficiently
over them, as to the outward man. Since their present Constancy proceeds not
from Factious pertinacy, (which is soon either subdued, or softened by
sufferings) but only from Conscientious Integrity, which is, in Wise, and Good
men, as a Diamond, unmalleable and invincible. Lastly, since this is so
modestly carried, as no way either invades, or affronts the prevalent Power, or
public Peace and Safety. Surely such men may well appear rather the Objects
of just Indulgence and Remission, than of any further renewed rigours, and
endless coercions; especially since their Principles kept private, (as they
are) can do no hurt; and their Ministerial abilities being made public, may
do much good.

Add to this; His Highness declared tenderness, as to Liberty of Conscience.
what your Highness has highly pretended to, and much sought to gain belief
in from the World; That no man or Magistrate, is more indulgent to real
liberty of conscience; none more tender of making rude Scrutinies into men's
hearts, (which are Gods Prorogative and reserve) or of laying either rigid
impositions upon men's Consciences, or penaltys on their opinions; when their
Conversation is such, as becomes the Gospel and our Laws; neither impious
nor injurious, neither idle nor Pragmatick. All which being granted, I cannot
under favor see how it can confist with your Highnesses many other
Declarations, and Professions, to preserve rational and Religious liberty
unviolated. How then (I beseech you) should the constancy of these men's private
persuasions, joined with honesty, and innocence of life, in any equity, render
them so burdensome, and intolerable to the Commonwealth, as to exclude them
for ever, from all civil, and Sacred Industry, in such ways of honest
subsistence, as are suitable to their education, and abilityes?

Who doubts, but that in civil addictions, and adherences, His Highness
approving of men's constancy to their Principles in his own Interest.
even your Highness does passionately desire, and highly approve such
servants, subjects, friends, and followers, who are not upon sinister, but
sincere respects, so devoted to your Safety, Honor, Power, and Interest, that
they will not easily suffer themselves to be removed from them, whereto they
once have applied themselves, not more with prudence, (which will only hold in
the Summer, and prosperity of your affairs, and family) than with conscience,
love, and gratitude: which will last in Winter and adversity; as the life and
sap of Trees, does when their leaves are fallen; That virtue which is commendable
in your Highnesses case, cannot be blameable in another, though an enemy,
because it is a virtue. The Antiquated, or obsolete Causes of many Ministers
sufferings.


Nor is it to be forgotten, as to the examining, of the point of Justice in
many excellent Ministers, and other Scholars past sufferings; That long before
the scene of our civil affairs was thus altered, and settled, as now it is,
under your Highnesses Government, many of them were Silenced, Sequestered, and
Ejected, out of their Livings, preferments, and Fellowships, merely upon the
score, of I know not what, Occasional Covenants, new Vows, and State
Engagements; which were but temporary Stratagems; serving such various, and
Particular Interests, as in their times were sometimes on foot, and prevalent
in their parties and designs, All which having been long since justly
antiquated, and abolished, as to their secular virtue, and civil influence; it
were great pity, they should still continue their destructive power, upon any
good men's consciences, Estates or Libertyes: as Comets are thought to do their
malignancy, long after they are vanished, and dis-appear: What justice can
there be, that men should continue under penaltyes, when the partial causes,
or temporary occasions, of their sufferings, are quite ceased, and suppressed;
nor did they suffer at first upon any moral, but only politic
considerations, as they were then presented, by several Acters on the English
Stage.

Now the Laws, both of Tragedies, and Comedies do permit that those Actors,
which in one scene, may seem judged, beaten, bound and killed, may in another
act return to be free, and in favor, according as the vicissitudes of humane
affairs, do variously entertain this life of man.

If it be objected, Objection, as to some Ministers unquiet carriage Answered.
(to make all Ministers, of that unsuccesfull adherency, seem dangerous, and
odious,) that some of them enjoying common freedom, and protection under your
Highness Government; have yet behaved themselves other ways, then became
pious, peaceable, and prudent men, under power: yea, and contrary to that
wisdom, which affliction should have taught them, in reference to both
public, and private peace; Yet no justice will permit, that some men's
pragmatick petulancy, (who may possibly have more breath of passion in their
sails, then balast of discretion in the hold of their judgments,) should be
imputed to all men, of that learned Tribe; who may be of the same persuasion,
but of far more prudence, and moderation.

Nothing seems harder measure, No Justice will punish many innocents for a few
nocents.
and remoter from Christian Justice, than for a few men's sakes, (who may be
infected with the itch, or leprosy, of impatient, and turbulent spirits for
which they deserve to be confined, till they are healed) to shut up all others,
who were not at all infected with, or are cured of their diseases; It is great
pity, some men's inordinate activity, should condemn others, to utter
idleness; and exclude such able men even from those mean employments, (as to
the emolument) to which they have cheerfully condescended, (since the frowns,
and burden of the times, have greatly depressed them) in order to maintain
themselves, and their familyes: which must be undone, if these may do nothing,
for which they are apt, and proper.

And since all proportions of both divine, Why Ministers are punished more than
any men of the same Principles.
and humane justice do assure us, that those opinions or persuasions, by which
no private advantages are obtained, nor public dangers threatened, cannot be
such a plague, disease, or Gangrene, as are only to becured, by these
dispiritings, and exhaustings, which must needs follow extreme idleness, and
indigence; wise men cannot sufficiently admire, what Council or design, puts
your Highness upon executing those high severities, only upon men of
literature; Ministers; and other Scholars; denying them all such ingenious
libertyes to subsist, by their honest callings; which yet are granted fully and
freely to all other men; even the meanest tradesmen, and mechanics; who are of
the same principles, and prone to be much more active in asserting them; and
the wonder is the greater, because your Highness has in my hearing as well as
many others professed, an impartial value, of all able and good Ministers;
much commending some of the Episcopal way; yea, and almost preferring them,
for their Graces and Gifts.

Lastly, because your Highness is pleased to own your self, not only as
Protector in general; but as the special Patron of both the Universities,
and in them of all good Literature, and Scholars, by being Chancellor of one
of them, greater degree of favor may be hoped.

I profess to plead for no Ministers, or Scholars, Plea for Ministers, as to
their Innocence, and multitudes.
that are scandalously criminous, or morally noxious; such I believe and hope
few of these men are, who now fall under the millstone of your Highnesses late
Declaration, which must needs grind them to powder; If it excecute what it
threatens.

But if the most of them were persons, less commendable; or for some
misdemenors, justly blamable, yea, and by law punishable; yet still the very
multitude of them, is no small Plea; If not for total impunity, yet for such
clemency, as may not seem an outrage of severity, and extremity of justice:
what is more usual in civil and Christian States, than to suffer the edge of
Justice to be blunted, and the stroke of it defeated, rather then over-sharply
executed against the many Crowds: of offenders though they cannot oppose the
siroakes of justice by force, yet they do as it were smother, and oppress
them; pinioning the arms even of just power with the cords of a man; the
softer sense of humanity; and, which is more, of Christian pity; we find our
blessed Savior had more then once compassion on the multitude; not only as
necessitous, but as numerous.

Both which number, and necessity, multitude and misery, do here so meet
together, in the Objects of my Plea, and Petition, presented before your
Highness, that your eye could not but affect your heart, if you could at one
view, behold the great quantities, and deplorable companies, of venerable
Ministers, and other ingenious Scholars, together with their dependances, and
relations, (as wives, children, servants, and necessitous kindred) all which do
infinitely dread, and earnestly deprecate those miseryes, which hang over their
heads; if the Fathers or chief of their Families, be forbidden to work in their
callings; which is to forbid them all to eat or to live, at least honestly.

I am confident so rufull a spectacle, (even amidst the pomp, The sad spectacle
of Ministers, and their Families, who are many thousands ready to perish.
and splendour of your court) would more move your Highness, to compassionate
them, than the prospect of Xerxes his Army did that Great King, when he wept to
think how a few years would moulder to dust so vast a number of valiant men;
for these last must perish by the Common Law, and inevitable fate of mortality;
but those many and good men, for whom I am bold to intercede, must it seems be
undone, and die merely by their arbitrary necessityes, to which your
Highnesses Declaration only does drive, and condemn them.

And which way, I beseech your Highness, without a miracle can these men by
any unwonted industry, get livelihood for themselves, and their families! whose
number cannot amount to less then, Twenty or Thirty thousand Souls;
considering, that above half of the Ministers, and Scholars, of England, and
Wales, have been, upon one account or other, Sequestered from their livings,
(which are above Nine Thousand) besides Fellowships, or Free-Schooles; many
other also have been wholly deprived of their Prebendaryes, Denaryes,
Bishoprics, and Highest Dignityes. in the Church; who upon the first Figure,
or Head, cannot be less then Six, or Seven thousand persons; to each of which
if we add but four more, (which is but a small Family or retinue) they cannot
but exceed the proportion I have calculated.

And here, Plea from his Highnesses conjugal, and paternal sense.
my Lord, being your self reputed both a loving Husband, and a tender Father,
I cannot but believe, that you are (as well as I am) extremely sensible of
these conjugal, and peternal remorses, which gnaw the very bowels, and pierce
the Souls of all ingenuous men in behalf of their nearest, and dearest
Relations; when they shall see these involved in the same calamityes with
themselves; and for their sakes, to drink as deep of the bitter cup, as their
chiefes or principals; A Gracious Christian may with generous courage encounter
his own death, as conclusive of his own miseries, and his enemies malice: but
who can endure to be spectators of those lingering torments, wherewith famine
must kill, their Wives, and Children; Hagar went away, that she might not be a
sad spectatrix of her Son Ismaels death for want of Food.

As the Laws of humanity teach us to abhor such Dreadful Severityes, God abhors
dreadful severities on the innocent, and the nocent that are numerous.
falling upon our Relations; so the God of Mercy would have them avoided in the
justest executions; that not the Children, and so not the Wives, should bear
the iniquity of the Fathers, or Husbands; yea Gods compassion pleaded against
the passion, and peevishness of Jonah for his sparing Niniveh, (though he had
denounced his wrath, and limited a day for protracting the Execution) even from
the many Innocent Children, that were in that City; who the less they can
speak the louder they do cry, by a silent, yet potent eloquence to that God, of
whose mercyes we are assured by many Holy, and happy Tantologies, that they
endure for ever.

Such Pious, parentall, and pathetick motives here present themselves to your
Highness, as from others, so from those, whose Oratory is only in their
cries, and tears; who as tender Branches, must needs wither, both as to
feeding, and breeding, if the main root, or stem of their Fathers, be either
barked round, or stubbed up, having nothing to do, and nothing to enjoy; I
shall not need to add, that no argument will be more Odiously, Bitterly, The
triumph of Papists over the Married, Reformed, and Impoverished Clergy.
and unanswerably urged by the Papists, with their Priests, and Jesuits,
against the reformed married Clergy of England, then this; to see somany of them
with their Wives, and Children, thus exposed to most sordid, and shameful
necessities, and indeed to perfect beggary; (for many such spectacles, my own
eyes have seen, and my heart deplored) And this in a land of plenty, in a time
of peace, and after so many high protestations, to maintain the protestant,
reformed Religion, and encourage the Ministers of it.

Thus far (my Lord) I have led on my Petition for your Highness Clemency, by
the limits of punitive civil Justice; without making any unhansome breach, or
incroachment (I hope) upon its just power, and proportions, in regard to either
the just offenses, or present merits, of those learned Scholars, and worthy
Ministers, for whom I have taken this boldness to plead; and in them for their
Wives, and Children; whose numbers, and innocence, are capable to disarme the
rigors of justice; although those had been actually deserved by their Husbands
and Fathers, whose offenses for the most part have been and are more in their
persuasions, then their practices; in other men's jelousies, more then their own
activities; and so their punishments hitherto have been rather cautionary, then
expiatory.

Nor, (in the second place) will this my humble request, Second reason of State
urged, for the care of future fasety, and public peace, Answered.
any way (I trust,) seem less consistent with your Highness Vigilance, and
Frudence, for the future Peace, and Safety of the Public; both which in all
civil societies, where men have any sense or enjoyment of things beyond Beasts,
and Slaves, are best preserved as by justice, so by equanimity, and gentleness;
yea, and they are soonest blasted by two great sharpness, and severitys, which
drawing upon the very Lees or dregs of justice, (sowred with jealousies, and
revenges) must needs savor much, even of injustice; For punishments are not
more due to offenders, for their malicious Trespasses against the public
welfare, then some mercy and moderation, are due to those common mistakes,
frailties, and infirmities of life, which often overttake even worthy men, not so
much by their fault, as by a kind of fate, their misfortunes or afflictions
being rather tentative of their virtues, then Punitive of their Vices; whose
even finfull infirmities, Rigorous severities enemies to public tranquillity.
(many times complicated with their miseries God himself is pleased so far to
consider, as in the midest of judgment to remember Mercy; and even to punish
them more with the relentings of a Father, then the exactions of a Judge;
mercy, benignity, and compassion being no less beams of Divine Glory, and
Majesty, than are Justice, Power, and Sovereignty: These are as the Rubies;
those as the Diamonds of that Crown, which God wears, and indulgeth to Rulers
on earth, as their Royal Coronets, whose extremities and rigors of justice,
must never overlay, or exclude, their Christian charity, and moderation: The
want of which St. Paul tells us is not the diminution, but the annihilation of a
Christian; yea of a chief Apostle; For without Charity I am nothing.

I know the grand Interest of public peace, and safety, (which seem the
chief ground, and ends of that late Declaration) are not in reason, or policy,
to be neglected, by such as seek the reputation of prudent statists, and their
own preservation.

But (my Lord) what wise man will so far injure the opinion, No public
danger from a few unarmed Ministers.
generally had of your Highnesses Potency, and Vigilance in Government, as to
think, that neither your Highness, nor the Commonwealth, can be in a posture
of Peace, and Safety, unless so many learned and unarmed men; many of them
Aged, and every way as unapt for war, almost as their Wives, and Children,
unless (I say) these be quite undone, by being silenced, and ejected, from all
kind of Ministerial, and Scholasticall employments, which are only suitable to
their breeding, and ability, and competent to maintain them.

If any man shall suggest, that such methods of extremityes, and despaires, are
the proper Antidotes, if not to expel the poison (as they esteem it) of
opinions, already diffused in some Ministers spirits, and veins; yet to stop
at least the spreading, and contagions of them in other men; My answer is;
That, even in this point of State policy, (a depth through which few men can
well wade to Heaven) I doubt not, but your Highness with others, has
observed; That some either less seasonable, and discrete rigors, or more
immoderate severities, heretofore used against those Ministers, (whose pious,
and peaceful Labors were useful to the Church of God, though their judgments
in all things were not exactly conformable, to the then present constitution of
England) even those asperityes have been thought great disadvantages to the
peace, and safety of those Governors, and that government, which then prevailed.

Rigorous exactions, Whether rigorous depressions be the way of Safety.
and superfluous severities, are always weak Reformers of wilful men, much
more of wise men; especially as to their principles, and persuasions; and these
not only inbred, but inveterate; ingrafted by education; abetted by
conscience; and confuted only by the successes, and the prosperities of those,
from whom they have suffered many effects, of anger, and hostility; but few
impressions either of reason, or Religion, of equity, or charity; Truculent
methods of Government, (such as were sometimes not more excessively, then
unseasonably used in the low Countries, by the Duke of Alva, and others,) where
people are not more unsettled, then in many things unsatisfied, do but heighten
Animosities; by a kind of antiperistasis; (as Salt, and Snow, to water) fixing,
and congealing, the malice, and despite, as well as the opinions, and
persuasions, of men; all which would sooner disperse, and evaporate in milder
ways of humanity, and moderation; as the spirits of all things do soonest and
most exhale, in warmer seasons, than in cold.

Nor are such methods, of public rigors, Rigours do not exstinguish different
Principles.
any whit more probable to hinder, or suppress, the feared derivation, and
traducttion, of the like principles, and passion to others: For your Highness
well knows; That all public, and frequent sufferings, in persons in any
repute for Piety and Learning (If born with Christian, courage, and constancy)
do only move the greater pity, and compassion to them in the minds of the
spectaters, and hearers of their calamities; which are by many decryed, by most
suspected, for oppressions of power, rather than just punishments, or
convictions; Such sad and Tragic spectacles, solicit men's curiosities, more
seriously to search the grounds of so great constancy; which Justin Martyr
tells by his own experience, was a great occasion, of many Heathens conversion
to Christianity in primitive times; when nothing invited the world, to regard
Christians, but only their mutual love, together with their patience, and
perseverance in their way; not as sullen, and obstinate, (which Marcus
Aurelius, falsely imputes to them) but as deeply persuaded of the truth, and
merit of their cause or profession; of which others grew so inquisitive, when
they saw them so resolute.

From hence, by a native kind of softness; Yea, they advance them among the
Vulgar, by being persecuted.
men's hearts being as it were melted, they easily run into that mould, or
frame, which first they pity, then they enquire, afterward they commend, at
last they admire; both for the magnanimity of the sufferers, and supposed merit
of the cause; to which they are sooner engaged, then they well understand it,
by a pricipitancy of affections; which (like a quick tide, or current) carries
them down the stream before their sails are well spread, or trimmed: For they
presume; That Cause has something in it more than Humane, which bears up
wise, and good men, so much above humane frailty, worldly principles, and
secular pleasures; At last the insinuatings of man's affections, and passions,
(like the motion of Screwes) secretly, but powerfully rayseth their minds, not
only to approve the cause, but to emulate the heroic constancy of such men;
which by degrees, they grow so much to love, and applaud on one side, that they
easily arrive, to hating of the other, and to bitter reprochings of those, that
are the implacable Authors, of such men's sufferings; in whom they think virtue
it self, with Grace, and Truth, yea, Christ himself, and God does suffer;
Thus opinions, true or false, usually grow, and spread more; yea, and take
deeper rooting in men's hearts, not only by the reputation of their authors, and
abetters, but also by their being pruned, and cropped, with sharper, and
severer hands.

Your Highness cannot be Ignorant, The first means to allay different Parties,
and Principles in State.
that the best medicine to allay the humors, and inflammations of civil
dissentions in matters of Opinion, is of the same temper, and confection, with
that, (which Tacitus) and other wise men, prescribe against cancerous, rumors,
and scandalous libels, (which are frequently vented against persons in power,
by the eructations of envious and ambitious Spirits, as those mists and foggs,
which from valleys, and lowest bottoms, usually rise in the face of Heaven)
Agniti adolescunt rumores; spreti exolescunt; If they be too much owned, and
opposed, like torrents or land floods stopped in their courses, they gain force
and credit; If they be neglected, like Squibs, they spend their force and fury,
without any danger or blemish to Princes or States; who by a generous
indifferency discover, not only a just despiciency of such follies; but great
confidencies of their own Integrity; and such a magnanimity as not being easily
discomposed, cannot be wanting to the maine points of Safety, and Power.

Nothing, The Mutual cruelties of the Guelphes, and Gibelines.
we see, kept up those bloody, and bitter wars, (or assasinations, and
massacrings rather) between the Guelphs and Gibelines; the Imperial and Papal
factions; for more then one hundred years in Italy, and other places, but only
repeated, and exorbitant revenges upon those, who had no other way injured each
other, but by their different persuasions; one preferring the Popes
Ecclesiastical, the other the Emperors civil Power in the Empire; From this
principle each party was cruelly vigilant to improve the vicissitudes of Power,
and what ever advantages they could get at any time; which they used or abused
rather, not as lenitives to compose differences, and recover the public or
common tranquillity; but as corrasives or sarcasmes, to eat out and wholly
extirpate the remnant of the adverse party; to the ruing of many worthy men,
many noble Families, flourishing Cities, and opulent Countries.

Doubtless, Clemency, and Equanimity, the best calmers of public storms as
to men's minds.
not the blustrings of Boreas, but the calm Sunshine of general tranquillity
shining equally, and indifferently, on all honest, able, and peaceable men; in
any Nation or community, makes them soonest forget their past sufferings; to
lay down their fewdes, to compose their differences, and to conform to that
general quiet of which they see, they may upon fair terms, have their share;
Thus the Flints of civil Factions, are most easily and safely broken on softer
cushions; which put between the anvill and hammer of Power and Oppression, are
prone to strike fire, and fly in the faces of those who thus strive, not only
to dash them in pieces, but to beat them to powder.

But here (my Lord) I cannot be so stupidly indiscreet, The Authors Apology for
touching upon State Policy.
as not to confess my folly, besides my fault; and to crave your Highness
pardon, for this so great Impertinency; by which (as Phormio a Philosopher, who
read a Lecture of military Discipline, in the presence of Hanniball, the
greatest, and best Commander then in the world, to the no great commendation of
his Scholarly Skill, or discretion) I may seem thus weakly, and needlessly to
present before your Highness any methods or rules of Sat policy, in reference
to public Peace, and Safety, who are known both at home and abroad to be so
great a Master of all Arts, both civil and Military, both in the practique and
the Theorie.

This reflection upon my own fatuity and presumption, How necessityes and
oppressions Exasperate men.
in points of State policy, justly forbids me all further needless
importunity, of suggesting to your Highness what you cannot but know, how
sharp an edge necessities of life nut upon those men's Spirits and activityes,
who otherwise are soft and blunt enough; for having no honest employment to
busy their thoughts and time, in order to get some competent support for
themselves and their families; they cannot avoid to be tempted by discontent,
idleness, and indulgence to project, and act, those things (though to their
own utter ruin) which they hope may either put an end to their sufferings; or
at least make those men suffers with them, (as Sampson did the Philistines) who
show so little compassion to them, and exercise so needless, and undeserved
severities upon them; Paraxismes of anger, disdain, and revenge often transport
even calm and wise men, by oppression, (as Solomon tells us) beyond those
prudent bounds, which otherwise they had set to themselves; being impatient to
see themselves so afflicted, as to be despised; and so to be despised, as to be
denied convenient work, and lawful wages in honest industry: which all
humanity, as well as policy, allows; yea, and in some cases commands to those,
who are permitted to enjoy their liberty, beyond the confinement of a Prison.
We daily see fires that are too hot, do quench themselves, by making even
little pots over boil.

. Certainly, next Death and Hell, The Sharp Spur of poverty to men of Parts.
nothing is more dreadful and intolerable to humane nature, than for men of
skill to be denied employment, and men of understanding to be thereby forced to
want their bread, which is not to be gotten, but in those Callings that are
their proper spheres: in all other new ways they are driven to seek their
food, as wild beasts in desolate places; which exetick distresses I know have
forced very worthy Ministers to infinite despondencies, and almost despairs;
either having no home for themselves, and their Families; or not enduring their
own small and wretched Cotages; which are to them like howling wildernesses, or
hell it self; full of weeping, and wailing, and gnashing of Teeth, for wife,
and children's want of Food convenient and other necessaries of Life: The
Scripture tells us; Better are those that are slain with the Sword, than those
that perish by Famine; which is a lingering and multiplied death; Gods high
displeasure threatens the Sons of Eli in the same breath, not only with early
and immature Deaths; but with those sharper necessities, in case they live, by
which they shall be forced to croutch for a morsel of bread, and some mean
employment.

Our Henry the 8th. The Humanity of Henry the 8. for the Monasticks relief.
(whom Sir Walter Rawleigh so blackly and deeply brands for a perfect Idea of
Tyranny,) yet showed (as the Lord of Cherbery tells us in the life of that
King) so much Clemency, as a Prince, and charity as a Christian, to those of
the Monastic Orders, when he drove them out of their well built and well
honied hives, as to allow those, who tarried in England, some competent
Pensions during their lives; as knowing, that the way of their recluse breeding
in devout Idleness, had made them unfit, and so unable to get their living by
any ordinary way of bodily Labor, and usual callings; to which they were
indisposed, because unwonted.

Far be it then from your Highness (who pretend to an higher pitch of
Reformation and Religion) to take away the remaining fragments, How hard it is
to take away the cup of cold water, yet remaining to many Ministers.
and cups of cold water, from so many Prophets, and some of the Prophets; who
are not only men and Christians; but able Ministers, as well as Professors of
the Reformed Religion; Far be it from your Highness (of whose bounty I know
some men of as different persuasions to you as Jews are from Christians, have
tasted) to break the little cruses of oil, and barrels of meal, which have
hitherto supplied (as the small Reserves after great Shipwracks) the necessityes
of many excellent Scholars; who are good Preachers, and better lovers of the
Christian and Protestant Religion: O let not so many godly and grave Ministers,
have cause to impute it to your Highnesse's Declaration, that they, their
Wives, and Children, must during the remainder of their miserable days, mingle
their bread with ashes, and their drink with weeping; going down to their
Graves, oppressed with that Sorrow, which is the effect not more of unrelieved
than undeserved Oppression.

I know it will be replied by some; Their Charity that put Ministers in
Mechanic Employments.
That Hungar is a sharp Weapon as well as a Sauce; That Necessity will quicken
men's Invention and Industry; That the Belly is a great Master of art and wit:
Let these complaining Ministers (some say) dig, and plough, and thrash for
their Livings: or let them turn Gibeonities, and porters, hewers of wood, and
drawers of water.

Thus (indeed) the hard hearts, and withered hands of some men, (whose very
mercies are cruel) are prone to mock at poor Ministers calamities: True; It is
of Gods mercy, that any course of life, or honest labor will sustain the best
of us all; who are less than the least of Gods mercies; and meaner than the
meanest employment, if it be blessed with honesly, and competency.

But I beseech your Highness to consider; No other employments afford them
Competency.
That besides the hard labor, and sore travail, which must needs, in those
manual, and mechanic ways, lie upon ingenuous persons, especially in their
age and decline, who have spent most of their days in the shadow of their
studies, amidst unactive and sedentary retirements, as conversing only with
their Pens and Books; Befides (I say) this uncomlinesse and unaptnesse; There
must needs follow great incompetency, as to the necessary support of themselves
and their Families, in any such new way; which if it get them bread, will
hardly get them any drink, befides cold water.

But befides all these considerations, the greatest pity is, What pity it is to
bury Ministers excellent Tallents in Silence.
to bury the excellent gifts of those learned, pious, and Eloquent men under a
Bushel, or in the Earth, of silence, sordidnesse, and obscurity; who are fit
to be set in Golden Candlesticks, in the Temple of God, as burning and shining
Lights; among whom Christ has sometimes delighted to walk, and converse in the
excellent graces, and useful gifts of his Spirit.

How great a sin and shame must it be, Public Sin and Shame, to oppress
good Ministers.
as well as darkness to this Church and Nation (professing the Christian, and
Reformed Religion) not only to behold, but to cause the faces of so many
Nazarites (who have from their youth been separated, and sanctified to the
special service of Christ, and his Church, who were heretofore whiter than
snow) to cause them to contract, by sordidnesse of living, such blackness and
deformity, as if they had lain among the pots; among the ( lixae and calones)
black guard, which usually attend great men's Kitchins.

It is great pity, that such goodly Pillars of Gods House should be cast down
to the ground, and levelled to the dust, even to the beasts, or meanest of the
people: Can it be comely to see such ponderous and laborious oxen ploughing
with Asses, which God in the Law forbad? It was a shame and reproach to King
Jehojakim, that he buried the dead body of the Prophet Vriah in the graves of
the meanest of the people: How much more will it be, to bury Ministers, even
alive among them? That is, so to abuse and crush them, as to enforce them,
either to embrace the dunghils, or converse only with clods and clowns.

All which burdens of life must needs press the more sadly No way of
competency or comeliness for Ministers but their calling.
because they are now toward the evening of their days, well stricken in
years; their light growing dimmer, and their shadows (both of fears and
infirmities) larger: So that to dig they are not able, and to beg they are
ashamed: I have known many of them very grave and venerable men, rather want,
than ask; and contend with poverty, rather than conquer their ingenuity; Who
were wonted to more tender foreheads, and a more blessed, as well as honorable
way of giving, rather than receiving. If they be now driven into a desolate
wilderness, they may probably meet with Fiery Serpents to sting them by adding
contempt to their want. But what Manna or miraculous Food can they exspect?
What rock will follow them to relieve their thirsty and fainting Souls; if they
must be utterly turned out from any place as Stewards in Christ's Family, or
Dispensers of Heavenly Mysteries?

What commendable frauds, I boseech your Highness, can there be found for the
sustenance of so many men, and their Relations? Who never have been, nor now
are, men of any great secular dealings, or receipts, and accounts: Such as the
unjust (but wise) Stexard used for his preservation; when he saw he must be
cast out of all bufines, A provident practice which we see our Blessed Savior
commended; not as to the injustice and immorality of it, but as to that worldly

there is nothing more Brutish and Barbarous, more Vmnanly and Unchristian,
than to neglect providing for our selves, and our Familyes; which who so does

denyer of the Christian Faith; Sure, if voluntary negligence and improvidence

nothing commendable, in forcible imposing those exauctoratings, silencings, and
restraints upon honest and Industrious men, as must compel them to

I might further add to the hunger and thirst of such men's outward condition,

that scarcity and famine of the word, which must necessarily follow in many
places: and that leanness which is like to enter into many poor peoples Souls;
to whom such able men formerly dispensed the bread of eternal life, as the
faithful Stewards of Christ's family; whose absence is not so readily to be
supplied with Ministers, proportionable to their abilityes, industry and
gravity, as is evident in many sequestered places; where people are either
almost famished: or at the best much infected with the unwholesome food of
unsound doctrine; yea, what if such, as succeed these outed and able Ministers,
give people stones instead of bread; and scorpions instead of fishes! what if
they affect to feed men's Souls after the vaporing of some novices, in these
days, with empty mangers and high racks; giving them the chafe of Juvenile
Notions, and useless Speculations, instead of those saving and practical
Instructions, with which those veterane Teachers, were wont to furnish and feed
their Auditors both elder and younger: what account can be given to the great
Bishop and Pastor of Souls, if his Sheep be starved for want of their
Shepherds? If wast, and weakness, diseases, and death eternal fall upon men's
precious Souls, for want of saving knowledge?

Certainly nothing should be done in civil affairs with more deliberation and
circumspection, than the silencing of Christ's Minisiers; Of changing the

and the divorcing of them from their people, where God has placed and
prospered them; every one ought to take heed what they do to those that are the
servants of the most High God, and teach the way of Eternal Life. There should
be no less care, and caution in altering, disbanding or cashiering this
spiritual Militia, than in that of the secular; Nor should therein Reason of
State only be considered, but Reason of Religion, with Christ's Interests, and
the good of Souls; for these are of eternal concernment to poor mortals, the
other but momentary.

Since then the temporal welfare of so many worthy Ministers, The blessings
accruing to the Public by able Ministers.
by enjoying their liberty to officiate, is so agreeable to the Glory of God,
the Honor of Jesus Christ, and the Salvation of poor Sinners, I hope they will
not seem to your Highness inconsistent with the public Peace and and
security; yea, since there appears no probable means under God for the
covenient support of so many honest and useful Preachers, besides other
Scholars, but only your Highness Clemency and Benignity, in indulging them
their honest liberty: Since necessity drives the poor to the rich, the weak to
the strong, and the miserable to the merciful; yea, even to the God of Mercy;
(whom though we cannot move by any merit of our own, yet, we may by such humble
importunities, as only obtrude upon him our miseries;)

Let it not displease your Highness, that I have thus far presumed not only
by soft and suppliant words, but by potent and I hope prevalent reasons, to
persuade you to such equanimity and charity, as may in real effect obtain some
such merciful qualifications, remissions, or suspensions (as to the execution
of your Highness Declaration) That Pious and peaceable Ministers, and other
Scholars may serve God, without distraction, and terror, in their wonted
callings and employments; If any civil caution be necessary, beyond your
Highness inresistable power, and those men's both weakness and danger, no
doubt all sober men will give it, Of revoking or remitting the rigors of
Public Declarations.
as far as is confistent with the integrity of their consciences; and further
they hope your Highness will not require.

Nor shall (I hope) that Scruple lie in the way of your HighHighnesse clemency,
or my Brethens liberty, namely the lothnesse of States and Potentates to
revoke, remit or qualify any act or edict, which they have once made public,
least by the seeming inconstancy of their councels, they should lessen the
authority of their commands, and the reputations of their wisdoms.

But herein as your Highness has in the close of your Declaration opened some
little door of favor and indulgence: So I trust, no severe restrictions of any
Country Committees, or other Officers, shall be permitted to shut, or
streighten it so, as to exclude any able unblameable and peaceable Ministers,
from the service of Christ in his Church, by which they may enjoy some
competent subsistence, by ingenous Liberty and honest Industry in their
callings. Such pious, charitable and generous Laxations or connivances as your
Highness may please to permit, may amount to the favor by me desired in their
behalf, without any public alteration or formal revocation; of which (yet)
no men, never so wise, and consultive, have any cause to be ashamed, when such
alteration is for the better, either as to verity, and equity, or charity;
which are not the blemishes, but the beauties and blessings of variations,
private or public.

What gracious heart observes not with comfort, Of Divine retractions, or Gods

that even God himself the highest Pattern of Wisdom, Justice, Power, and
Constancy, yet, often and easily retracteth as to the event, and execution of his
Denounced Wrath; and will rather seem mutable by his repentings (which are man's
impunity, not Gods mutability) than want the opportunity of magnifying his
mercy to penitents; He said he would destroy them; but he did it not: yea, as
willingly spared them, as he had justly threatened them; being solicitous to
find a man to stand in the gap, and turn away his wrath; Nay the Divine
goodness was glad of Moses his Intercession, though it seemed to be made with
an holy kind of rudeness; and an humble disobedience; even then when God bad
him, Let me alone, that I may destroy them.

In like sort the Lord chose to let his passionate and peevish Jonah seem a
false prophet, than himself should not appear everlastingly true; not so much
in the letter of his declared threatenings, as in the tacit limitations and
exceptions, of his mercy and pardon; which are ever to be understood by
penitent sinners, though not expressed in the menaces of divine vengeance; Such
gracious Retractations are not the least part of a sinners comfort, and of Gods
Praises.

has emboldned me first to seek to the throne of his Grace, by my prayers;
Next to make this petitionary address to your Highness, not as asking any
great thing for my self; but only craving those honest freedoms for other
worthy men, which are their greatest temporal ambitions; The granting of which
as it cannot any way tend to the diminution of your Highness Honor, Profit or
Safety; so nor will my begging of it, any way I hope tend to your Displeasure;
But rather your Highness will please to imitate David; who incensed with
Nabals churlish ingratitude, David's anger well pleased to be disarmed.
and burning with military flames of reveng, yet, was neither unwillingly, nor
unthankfully taken off from executing his intended severityes by the discreet
intercession of a wise woman; for which he blesses God and her; Certainly,
none are more exorable, than generous spirits, nor any more generous than those
that have gracious hearts; whose wisdom is not earthly, sensual and devilish;
from their own passions, or the depths of Satan; but from above; pure,
peaceable and easy to be entreated.

Such favorable remissions do the fears, Public favors conquer enemies minds.
and dejections of many thousands of poor Ministers, and their Relations, now
crave of your Highness, the granting of which cannot but procure your
Highness many friends; and either soften or filence many enemies; leaving them
without excuse hereafter; who seeing your power able to crush them: shall abuse
your Clemency, which is willing to preserve them, in all ways of honest
industry, which becomes them.

But it is now (my Lord) high time for me to be ashamed; Apology for the
prolixity of this Plea.
not of my charity, (which makes not ashamed) but of tedious, and excessive
prolixity; considering the Sea and moles of business, which every moment
presses upon your Highness (yet, in some cases of great concern, as this is
for Gods Glory, and the good of so many thousands good men, (yea, worthy
Ministers) it would be not only a great solacifme, but almost a great sin to
be short) However this cause of shame I own; that I have been so long in
remonstrating or importuning that; wherein I not only understand other persons
of far more merit and acceptance have interceded (as the Lord Primate of
Armagh) but I have some cause to presume that your Highness own purposes have
prevented me, and all men's mediation; in that you are pleased with much candor
and gentleness to admit of any Intercessors.

Of which benignity I and all the world shall then have, not only confidence
but experimental assurance, when your Highness shall effectually remedy and
actually forbid, the further cryingout, and complaining of so many worthy
Ministers and their families in our Streets. A Jesuitick Jubilee, which I
should not more pity, The Jesuits Jubilee.
than repine to see those men enjoy, who are very sore and subtle adversaries
to the Reformed Religion and it is ablest Ministers: Nor do I doubt, that your
Highness will ever have either more cause to rejoice or less to repent in any
thing, that has or shall be either acted, or commanded by you, than in
reviving the spirits of so many men that are ready to fayl within them through
distress, next door to despair.

Which favorable Indulgence to them will not only turn to an act of charity and
humanity, Clemency the best sodering of New Soveranity.
but even of true State policy too; It being one maxim given by a great master
of it; Novum imperium inchoantibus utilis est clementiae fama; Though the power
of the Sword may here lay the first foundation of new government; yet, clemency
and moderation, are the chief cement and firmation of it: The ambition of the
Heathen Grandees, as Alexander, Julius and Augustus (first Caesar's) also of
Trajan, M. Aurelius, and others, sought to preserve to themselves the Honor,
and to others the happiness of their Clemency, that they might appear to
mankind, not only worshippers of warlike Deities, such as Mars and Bellona; but
also of Jupiter; who was esteemed, not only the King but the helping Father of
both Gods and men; whose defective name borrowed its supply from the Sacred
name Jehovah; whose glory passed by in that Proclamation, The Lord gracious and
merciful, etc.

Tertullian's generous council is good; Christian Charity must exceed Heathens
Humanity.
Plus debet Christi discipulus, quam mundi philosophus, gloriae animal, et
secularis aurae vile mancipium; Christians act much below their pattern, if they
do not exceed the best of Heathens in humanity and holiness too; as much as
their true God does others Idols; Since they have the Word of God for their
rule, the Servants of God for their copies; the Son of God for their Original,
and the Nature of God for the perfect and eternal Idaea of all charity, mercy
and benignity, who will also be at last their exceeding great reward.? We read
that Joseph easily secured his Brethrens fears of his reveng, by telling them
he feared God: intimating that he was resolved to follow God in his ways of
Mercy and Gentleness; David a man of War gives it, as one of the Characters
of a good man, he is ever merciful, Our blessed Savior enjoynes it to his
Disciples; Of Mercy and Benignity in Christians.
Be ye merciful as your Heavenly Father is merciful; and this not only to the
just and good; but also to the bad and unjust: yea, God himself capitulates
with such worms as we are; If we show mercy, we shall receive mercy, according
to the measure we mete to each other: The Syrians gave the Kings of Israel this
Honor; that they were merciful Kings; For such as know most of the true God,
will be ready most to imitate him, in this attribute of mercy, which is above
all his works.

As for my self (my Lord) I have more than my reward, If I have done or
endeavored, as becomes my duty to my God, and Savior; Next to my conscience
and calling; and lastly, to that charity which I ow my brethren, and fellow
laborers; whose distresses I am sure require, though their modesty did not
expect, this service from me, of which they are wholly ignorant; I know many of
them, I hear of many more; whose worth is not to be measured by the false
weights, and scanty measure of civil sidings and factions; These are many of
them reduced to their cottages, to their dry morsels, to their water and bread
of affliction; which (yet) they greatly fear to loose; So much does a little
seem to those moderate, and humble minds, who know how to be thankful, yea
content, with that which is next door to nothing.

I should suspect my self to be no living member of Christ's Body, Of Sympathy
among Ministers.
(whose very life consists in charity and compasson,) If I found in my self no
sympathy, with the afflictions of so many Joseph's: yea, I should not only be
ashamed, but much, and justly suspect my own plenty, and Gods undeserved bounty
to me, least my table should become my snare, and my very food be digested into
sin; If I had no sense, and sorrow, for others hungry, and afflicted souls; It
were far better for me to be levelled to the tenuity of the meanest of my
Brethren, (that I might be experience, learn to be compassionate) than with an
epicurean indifferency, and uncharitable stupidity to behold them, wanting
competency, and indeed necessaries: which they must do; If your Highness
decree that is gone forth, be rigidly executed; not against Magicians, and
Astrologers, but against grave Divines, and godly Ministers of the gospel; to
their utter undoing.

It will be favor enough, and a most ample return of my prayers, If by this
pious importunity, I have any way persuaded, Conclusion deprecating displeasure
I have any way persuaded, (If need be) or confirmed your Highness clemency to
them. Whose pardon I should now (of course) formally crave for my self, and
thereby add to your Highness troubles by some solemn apology; which I would
willingly add, if I were conscious to my self of the least fault in my design;
If there be any, it is only such as charity I hope may and will easily cover,
fince it is charity only that commits it; Nor sin or shame in charity.
Not but that I know some moreoser politicians are prone to censure even
compassion for a kind of conspiracy, and such charity for malignancy, (like
those scepticks, who not only disputed, but denied the snow to be white) but I
hope your Highness eye will not be less good because theirs are evil.

Only it is fit to beg your Highness pardon for this my intolerable
trespassing so much upon your much oppressed time, and little leisure, by so
tedious an address, in which (at the worst aspect) I shall yet appear as one
that pays your Highness (besides other taxes) the tribute of double honor;
First by owning power in your hand to destroy; New, by hoping for pity in your
heart to preserve these Ministers, and other Scholars, in whose behalf I
intercede: who, if any under Heaven, are objects fit for your Clemency, and
Compassion; both for their eminent merits, and their impendent miseries.

I humbly leave these papers in your Highness hand; and your heart in Gods;
who is higher than the highest: of whose mercy we all daily partake, and shall
while we live on earth stand in need; whose compassions are his good pleasures,
but his punishneed; Peroration.
whose compassions are his good pleasures, but his punishments, his strange
work, as not willingly afflicting the hildren of men: That your Highness may
in this case imitate so blessed a pattern, is the prayer of

FINIS.
A POSTSCRIPT to the READER.
Good Reader,
THou may further understand, that at the same time, when this Address was
made by the Author in behalf of those Ministers of the Church of England, over
whose heads this Black Cloud then hung, threatening a deluge of desolation, God
stirred up the spirit of the then Lord Primate of Armagh, Bishop Usher,
personally to intercede with the then Oliver Protector, for his clemency and
indulgence toward them; It was one of the last endeavors of piety and charity,
to which that great and most vengerable person, applied his most potent
Interessions; fortified not only by his pious oratory, full of exquisite
reason and religion, but with his prayers and tears; For that divine prelate,
who was in all things (as Nazianzen says of Athanasius ((...)) rather
admirable than commendable; It being bard to say whether be were doctior or
melior, ornation or humilior, thought himself in nothing more concerned, then
in showing those bowels of compassion, which became such a Father of the
Church, to the worthy sons and servants of it; whose afflictions he made his
own; nor was he satisfied to enjoy some degrees of tranquillity and respect
himself, while he saw (as Joseph) so many of his Brethren, in such great
streights and tribulations; He attended (mollissima tempora fandi) the softest
opportunities of mediating for them, five or six weeks in London, impatient not
to show such compassion, as became so tender an heart, and so fervent a Soul as
his was; At last he was fain to retreat with little success, and less hopes,
than he expected and deserved, to his great grief; using this expression, to
the Author of the foregoing piece, That he saw some men had only intestina,
not viscera, guts, but no bowels; Thus did this good man go with sorrow to his
country retirement, and so to the grave; presaging further sharp impressions of
Gods sore displeasure which would shortly and suddenly light upon this Nation;
to the great darkning, as he said, of the reformed Religion, and the depression
of faithful Ministers.

This grand example of Christian commiseration, (which that excellent Primate
made more illustrious by his eminent worth in all things worthy of a good Man,
a good Christian, a good Minister, and a good Bishop) is worthy to be added to
the Records of those many other ((...)) most memorable and imitable actions of
that Hero, that Saint, that Angel, of the British Reformed Churches.

So that the Author of the foregoing Petitionary Remonstrance did not alone
stand in the gap; But was, as in all things else many degrees inferior to that
incomparable Primate, so in this happy to be his second and assistant.

Which regards are sufficient to vindicate his endeavors from all sinister
reflections; prone to fall from such eyes, as are either more cautious or more
envious, and censorious than becomes good Christians; esteeming nothing
prudent, which is not successful; nor valiant, which is not victorious.

After ages (possibly) will be better pleased to see the afflicted state of the
Clergy and Church of England, thus not wholly for saken, but asserted and
compassionated; at least by one so worthy a person; who was as an Army, or
cloud of witnesses; who being so well acquainted with the mind of Christ, and
living in the life of his Spirit; It may be a good omen that in his good time
the Father of Mercy, and God of all Consolation will answer his fervent
prayer; and return to plead the cause, and effectually to intercede in the
behalf of this so afflicted Church, and his Servants the worthy Ministers of
it; who have a long time born the burden of his sore displeasure, and the
reproach of all unreasonable men: All which has not yet drivan them to such
despair, but that they pray and hope, in the midst of Judgment God will
Remember his Mercies, which endure for ever: To which Petition all Lovers of
Truth and Peace will say, Amen.
