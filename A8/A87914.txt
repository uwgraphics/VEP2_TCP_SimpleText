A LETTER Agreed unto and subscribed by the Gentlemen, Ministers, Freeholders
and Seamen of the County of SUFFOLK.
PRESENTED To the Right Honorable, the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, And Common
Council of the City of LONDON.
Assembled, January 30th 1659.
RIGHT HONORABLE,
PLEASE you to accept this Paper as a testimony, that we are highly and
gratefully sensible of those Breathings and Essaies toward Peace, which your
Renowned City has lately declared to the World: And we earnestly wish, that our
serious and unanimous Concurrence, may ripen them to a perfect Accomplishment.
We are willing to consider it as an Omen of Mercy, when we observe the Nation
in general, lifting up its Vows to Heaven for a Free and Full PARLIAMENT.
It Is that alone, in its Genuine Sense, which our Laws prescribe and present to
us, as the great Patron and Guardian of our Persons, Liberties, and
Proprietics, and whatsoever else is justly precious to us. And if God shall, by
your hand, lead us to such an obtainment, after-Ages shall bless your Memory.
It Is superfluous to spread before you, your Merchandise decayed, your Trade
declined, your Estates withered. Are there not many within your Walls, or near
them, that in your ears deplore such miseries as these? Your Lordship may
believe, that our Prayers and Persons shall gladly promote all lawful means
for our Recovery. And we entreat, that this cheerful suffrage of ours may be
annexed, as a Labell to your Honorable Intendments.

This Letter was delivered according to its Superscription, by Robert Broke,
Philip Parker, and Thomas Bacon, Esquires.

LONDON, Printed for Thomas Dring. 1659.
