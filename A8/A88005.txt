A LETTER Sent from a Gentleman of Beverley, to one Mr. Holby Gent' of London,
CONCERNING The Entertainment of my Lord of Holland By the King, At His
Majesty's Court at Beverley, The Fifteenth day of this present July, 1642.
SIR;
AL1 the News I can write unto you at this time, is that of my Lord of Hollands
coming to the Kings Court at Beverly, being a choice Messenger from the
Parliament to the King, my Lord delivering the Petition of Accommodation from
the Houses, the King did give him that Noble Entertainment, which was not a
little ^omfort unto my Lord, for His Majesty embraced him in His arms, and bad
him welcome to His Court at Beverly, and drank to him; The King looking upon
the Petition, for his present safeguard, committed him to the Protection of two
Harralds for some hours space: But the King promised him Answer upon Sunday
night last at six of the clock, being the Seventeenth day of this present Month
of July. His Majesty, upon perusal of the Petition, was graciously pleased to
release him, and take him to His own Protection, and promised him an Answer, at
farthest, on Tuesday night. In the mean time, my Lord of Holland desired of His
Majesty so much liberty, as to write some Letters to his Friends; which the
King granted, that he might write what he thought fitting (the effect being
Answer of the Petition, as is supposed) for the King gave gracious Acceptance,
and told him what in Honor he could yield unto; the Sequel being an
Expectation of Peace, as you shall further hear when we have the next
opportunity.

Beverley, 18 Julii, 1642.
