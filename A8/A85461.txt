SALTMARSH Returned from the Dead, In Amico Philalethe. OR, The RESURRECTION of
JAMES The Apostle, Out of the Grave of Carnal Glosses, for the Correction of
the universal Apostasy, which cruelly buried him who yet lives. Appearing in
the comely Ornaments of his Fifth Chapter, in an Exercise, June 4. 1654. Having
laid by his grave Clothes, in a despised Village remote from ENGLAND, but
wishing well, and heartily desiring the true prosperity thereof.

John 11. 25. I am the Resurrection and the Life, he that believes in me,
though he were dead, yet shall he live. LONDON, Printed for Giles Calvert, and
are to be sold at the black Spread-Eagle at the West End of Paul's, 1655.

To my honored and beloved friends in London, who in a solitary season in that
populous City, were so great refreshment unto me, by their undeserved society.
WHereas of late I received letters from some of you, wherein I read that name,
which is as an ointment poured out, causing the parties to whom it appears, to
fall in love therewith, carrying in it a spirit which can produce a real
presence, where there is an absence in bodily respects: and that not only in
respect of divine nature simply considered, but also in point of Christian
relations and respects, which is never destitute of humane, considered therein,
and conversant therewith; otherwise, the goings forth of the spirits of the
Saints could not be peculiar, and distinct from that of the wicked, which the
divine and omnipotent power reachethalso; Therefore the Saints communicate in
prayers, intercessions, supplication, and giving of thanks, so as a stranger
cannot intermeddle therewith, nor with their joy arising therefrom.

And whereas some of you requested me to write unto you concerning the opening
of a portion of the word of God, which some years ago urged my spirit, and put
me into travel to bring forth but Satan hindered: Your letters visited me
immediately upon the employment of my spirit in another portion of the word of
God, which was then the proper strength I walked by, which made me to think it
might be a refreshment unto you; which I could not lay aside, till God opened
another into which I might enter. Neither could we depart from that place till
the cloud removed, inso-much that I was forcibly constrained to employ my self
about the instruments and services of the Tabernacle, to bring the sight
thereof unto your selves in the first place.: And so made bold to set upon the
writing of it, yea when others slept, beeause of my daily occasions; and when
it was writ, I was much urged to endeavor the printing of it, that so it might
come to more view: and being it was written in have, and so would be tedious to
read, I consented thereto; although there is nothing which I have spoken in
public since I saw your faces, but I could as freely commend it unto you. The
occasion of the Ark pitching upon this place, which methinks looks like Elim
in this wilderness, where there are twelve fountains of water, and 70.
Palm Trees, Numb. 33. 9. For our Apostle writes to the twelve Tribes, out of
which we may draw plenty of the water of life: and there is perfection and
fullness of palm trees, from which you may gather plenty of branches, to carry
as signs of victory, not only of the abatement of that deluge of wrath, but
also of overcoming by faith this present world, for Faith is the victory
whereby we do it. I say the occasion of the Arc pitching on this place was
this;

We being met together to exercise our selves in the word of God and prayer,
there was one who occasionally named this Chap, and read some part of it, in
which action the scope of it seemed to open it self unto me; and to deal
plainly and faithfully with you, my thoughts had never been formerly upon any
part of it, so as intending to express my self from it, but only as I have
read it as other histories and writings of the word of God.

Whereupon my spirit was moved presently to speak from it what I did receive,
and immediately uttered to the same effect, which I have in the following lines
commended unto you, out of my love unto you, and engagements beyond my
expression, moved hereunto by your loving and christian-like letters, joining
themselves unto me like Philip to the Chariot of the Eunuch, upon the delivery
of it, encouraging my heart hereunto, which otherwise I had not takenupon me,
lest it should have been thought a work not worthy your acceptance.

But if you please to take the payns carefully to peruse it, I doubt not but it
may give occasion of further thoughts unto you, then can be expressed in so
small a volume; it may point (as with a finger) unto such things, as to write
them the world would not contayn the books, the matter being of an infinite and
an eternal nature, holding proportion with Melchisedech, who is without
beginning of days, or end of life. Therefore the world cannot contain it, unto
whom this Scripture, as under the motion of the cloud has brought us, where we
now abide, Heb. 7. For other place of our abode, I may not signify unto you;
for some of our Neighbors have professed before the state of England, that the
place of our bodily abode is a non ens, that it has no being: and others have
affirmed that we are no people, not affording us so much as God gives to the
Conies, which he calls a people, though a small people, yet they make their
abode in the Rocks; and it is that rock of Ages, in whom only we desire to be
found, and to take these courtesy a patiently, as we do other kindnesses under
which we yet abide, as in that point of banishment, only for such matters as in
the following speech we tender unto you.

Whereas you make mention of a Sermon preached from the Prophecy of Isaiah,
speaking of the new heavens and the new earth, in the restoration of the
Church; from which it was concluded, that such an excellent estate of Religion
was to come hereafter, as never yet appeared, which some could not be satisfied
in such Exposition or Conclusion: we see it to be not only the common
doctrine, but deceit also of the world, not to give Christ a present being,
but hold men in expectation, as in the ancient Jews, who when he appears, seek
his ruin, and that is the top of that spirit.

By new heavens and new earth in that place, we understand the state of Christ,
or of that holy unction or Christianity, that as the visible heavens and earth
(to which he alludes) make a complete and fruitful world, even so do God and
man in Christ make one durable and fruitful condition, wherein righteousness
dwells, as our Apostle witnesses, which according to that law of the spirit,
is adorned with infinitely more relations, operations, and virtues then all the
Creations in Heaven and Earth can set forth, which he calls new, not with
respect unto these visible, but with respect unto that oldnesse of the letter,
and administrations according to the carnal Command, which the Apostle calls
old, because it is weak, fading, and ready to vanish away, and so is called the
old heavens, and the old earth that pass away, and that Ministry which
exercises according to that, being ever conscientious of the present want of
the glory and power of God in it, is constrained to form a time to come, which
will attayn thereunto, or else it could gayn no acceptance in the world, but
through Conception of hopes which are like the spiders web.

But the Ministry of the spirit according to that word of life, gives present
being to the thing it expresses, or else it carries not in it that power of
God, the nature of whose word was ever so to do, and ever will be, and they are
said to be new.

First, because of the ground thereof, for they renew themselves only by means
of that which is antiquity it self; for in the unity of God and man in the
faith of Christ, the spirit of God being an infinite fountain, must ever give
out it self by new operations, and not as one in want, to gather up again the
same thing in all respects considered, in which he has been formerly
exercised, no more then a living fountain gathers up the same water already
vented to distribute it again: and by reason of this infinite and eternity of
spirit and life, the soul of a Christian, or this spiritual state and
condition in Christ, is in an eternal act of newness, like that new
commandment that the Apostle writes of, and that old commandment which is
from the beginning.

Secondly, they are new according their manner of being; for in what point of
the Gospel soever Christ is made, it stands of as firm grounds of abode, and as
impossible to remove as heaven and earth: and we know that the very nature of
the earth establishes it self in its repayring unto the Center, in such sort
has God established the state of his sons and daughters; and yet when another
point of the Gospel is made manifest, it is upon like ground, but to be taken
in as differing a respect, and variety of furniture and glory, as though it
were another world, and so in every appearance of Christ, it has his whole and
complete condition comprehended and comprised in the same, as the whole world
is in the heavens and the earth, for Christ, or christianity is never
piece-meal'd.

As for example; If he be revealed as Father, with respect to a Son, it has
the whole furniture of heaven and earth, the whole estate of Christ, as Husband
with respect to a Spouse, there is the furniture of the whole world; for it is
Christ who is all in all, if as King, with respect to subjects, there is whole
Christ, all christianity is to be found there imbodyed: and so in all points
whatsoever, else Christ is not preached as all in every thing; no office or
operation of Christ, but it has in it whole Christ, and so ought to be
revealed, else we preach a humane Christ, and not divine, a carnal Christ, and
not a spiritual.

And where it is said, the new heavens and the new earth which I will make; the
word may as truly be read, which I do make, or which I have made: For it is
Jesus Christ yesterday, and to day, and the same for ever.

So that as the state of Christ which is the eternal Son, must needs remayn,
so shall the fruitful condition of this estate, therefore their name and their
seed must remayn, like heaven in name or authority, for operation or power: and
as the earth, to conceive and bring forth the fruits of righteousness, as that
which is ever in motion, for the renewing of the glory and fame thereof,: but I
doubt not but something in the speech following will give farther light to this
point, then now we have time to manifest. Only note thus much; that such
Doctrine as sets forth a time to come, of more worth and glory then either is,
or has been; such Doctrine keeps the Manna till to morrow, to the breeding of
worms in it: Yea it has in it that worm that dies not for if Christ our
Passover be eaten according to the law of the spirit, there is nothing to be
left till the morning: And if it be the bread that comes down from heaven, it
must be completely eaten at present, and there will be no want to morrow, for it
falls anew, and afresh, otherwise the word of God, that food of heaven is
corrupted, by reserving that for to morrow, which belongs to this present day:
and in the six days labor, in the operations of God, we have plenty to feed
on; In the seventh, as a cessation from all our own works, keeping a perfect
Sabbath unto God, so that the kingdom of Christ is to be declared, and whole
possession and present enjoyment given, and yet it is a Kingdom to come: So
that we have it in expectation as to come, as well as we fetch it up from that
eternal estate of the Son, to give it a present being; for if we have it not
as from the first, and to the last, we give it not its present being, and then
uo Kingdom of Christ; for no man can make him the first and the last, that is,
eternize the Son, but he must give him a present being without intermission of
a moment of time.

Dear friends, let me entreat you to read and consider, and lend me your help
in the way of interpretation, for there is no less need of that in him that
hears, then in him that speaks; in him that reads, then in him that writes, for
the light must shine in him that hears, or reads, as well as in him that
speaks or writes, or else it is not fruitful unto him. For we see by that
light set up in our selves, which God has made our own, and not as the same
light is in another: Therefore if you gather any comfortable fruit from what is
said, let it be as your own work by the spirit of Christ, and not as mine. I
have only endeavored to put the Manna into the Arc, and there only you shall
find it, completely in the pot, like the oil in the cruse, and meal in the
barrel, lasting to preserve life, and incorrupted unto this day: Which if any
thing that is said may seem to direct you unto, then I have my reward, and so I
humbly take my leave, and ever remain yours in all services of love, in our
only beloved.

S. G

To my much respected and honored friends in and about Lynne in Norfolk, in
whom I have perceived grave and joyful Acclamations at the publication of the
Gospel.
Dear and loving friends,
YOur carriage toward me, or rather toward the truth of God, was such, when I
was for a short time among you, that it is a sufficient engagement to bind me
over for ever to be yours. Do not think, that my not writing unto you, being
at such a distance, is any abatement of my love and respect: No, it has rather
kindled my heart, and filled it with employments otherwise toward you, which
has not ceased continually to pass over the great Ocean to converse with you
in spirit, and with God Almighty on your behalf, whom I love in the truth, and
it would be the joy of my soul to hear of your prosperity therein, which I
may not doubt of, or call it into question.

And it would not a little revive me, if the Lord pleased to cut out a way
thereto, to see your faces before I fall asleep, and cease to converse with
these terrene things.

I cannot in the mean season but commend these few following lines unto your
Christian consideration; which if they were the last words I were to breath out
in this world, I could as a legacy freely commit and bequeath them unto you.

You may please to see in the former Epistle, what occasioned them to come so
far abroad, and not to seem to abide within the confines of a few despised
people, as the rest of our poor endeavors seem to take up, and make it their
abode. Vouchsafe your payns to read them I beseech you, as a token of my
unfeigned love, and listen unto God for interpretation, who will not fail to be
a light unto you, and in them: You shall see what manner of food my soul lives
by in this remote wilderness, which I doubt not but will be relished by you,
though in a populous Town or City.

Now the God of peace fill you with all peace and joy in believing,

Amen.
So prays he who is ever yours, S. G.

AN EXPOSITION UPON The Fifth CHAPTER of JAMES.
FIRST, Observe the Coherence and connection of this Chapter, with that which
goes immediately before, wherein our Apostle tells us what is the proper
spirit, and practice of the men of this world, who are described unto us by
their seeking after carnal and corruptible riches, in the neglect of the
durable and unfading treasury.

Therefore they resolve in the latter end of the former Chapter, to go out
into such a City, and to buy and sell, and get gain; that is, to cast
themselves into such a form and order, wherein through their exchange and
traffic in the things proper to a creeature, they may get an advantage to
advance themselves as such as are more excellent and eminent then others, and
yet in the mean time are ignorant of the event and success of things; for
they know not what will be to morrow, that is, what issue is inevitably annexed
to their works and endeavors:

For he declares unto them, that they are as uncertain of the issue as they are
of their life, which is but as a vapor, or as a breath (as the word signifies)
that vanishes in the air and comes to naught: So uncertayne is every carnal
man of his own spirit what it is, or what will become of it, though it grows
up with him, and is of him, and he cannot be separated from it; yet knows he
not what it is, nor the thing whereby he maintains it; being the very vanishing
of the life and spirit of the Son of God, through the insinuations and wiles of
that Serpent and evil one, of whose constitution, spirit and practice he
himself is, preferring things subject to carnal sense of greatest excellency
and most to be desired.

Whereas they ought to say, if the Lord will we shall live and do this or that;
that is, the thing to be sought after, is the will, or law of God, even that
law of the spirit of life which is in Christ Jesus our Lord, whereby we live
and receceive ability to do every good and acceptable thing.

But contrarily, they glory in their boastings; that is, they glory, rejoice,
and make it their only treasure to praise themselves, as the word boast
signifies; that is, they count the things proper to the creature to be their
chief treasure and excellency, and not the things of the Creator.

All such rejoicing or glorying (says he) is evil; that is to say, is of that
evil one, namely the Devil.

Whence he infers, That he that knows to do good, and does it not, to him it is
sin; that is, he that cannot but acknowledge that the things that are of God,
which fade not, nor vanish away, are the chief and principal good to be
desired and sought after, and preserved above the things of the Creature, and
accordingly to be rejoiced and gloryed in, in the possession of them, and yet
notwithstanding he chiefly prefers and glories in the things of the Creature
more then they; this is the sin of the world, that idolizing of the Creature,
and setting it in the place of the Creator, which is not to do, or not to be;
that goodness that is of God, but is properly the evil of that wicked one:
For who knows not that it is good to seek after, and to have erected the best
City order, to be possessed of the richest treasure; to be encamped in the
strongest Host, to be invested with the wisest Council, and to be honored
with the most Princely dignity.

And yet who is it, that prefers, and principally endeavors after in all his
travells and negotiations, that order composed of God in Christ Jesus, that
City of the living God, the chiefest and most eminent order that ever was, who
is it that trades for those treasures consisting of those divine and
supereminent excellencies compiled and topped up in that inexhaustible
Storehouse of the Son of God: and who is he that imbodyeth himself in that
Army consisting of that hundred forty and four thousand following the Lamb on
mount Zion, bearing the flagge of their Fathers power and authority written in
their foreheads, openly proclaiming their courage and magnanimity to be of
God, and not of man? and where is he that prefers, and is found in that
general Assembly of the first born of God, as the choicest counsel and most
grave advice extant, having an equal Royalty and interest in all things that
concern the government of the Kingdom, and of that City, having a foundation,
whose builder and maker is God.

In a word, put all these things together, and whatsoever is really and
eternally good, in that one Christ of God, who is the fountain and also the
Center to which all things tend and stand on tip-toe to stretch themselves unto
him, that are of God.

And who is he that knows not that Christ Jesus, who is God blessed for ever,
is the chief and most desirable good to be gloryed in, and yet do it not, such
are concluded under sin by the verdict of the spirit of God in our Apostle;
that is, such as know the best thing is to be preferred and sought for, though
with the neglect and loss of all other things (as he that found the pearl in
the field, and sold all that he had to purchase that field) even so he that
cannot but confess God to be best of all, and yet prefers his traffic in
some other things before his attaynment of that, yea causing the things of God
to stand aside and give way to his vain and lofty lusts (of what nature or
kind soever) to satisfy them: That man does not the good which he
acknowledges, or as the word will bear, he is it not; that is, he is not of
the faith of Jesus, he is not stated in the condition of the Son of God, who
seeks only to do the will of the Father, and prefers and glories in that above
all things; and he that does not that, he is of that evil one, and does the
things that are proper unto him, being under the state and power of sin,
which is as a transition into the fifth Chapter.

Wherein observe two things.

First, The general scope. Secondly, The particular parts of it.
1. For the scope or end to which the purpose of the Spirit is directed, and
that is the death or crucification of the Son of God, that Just one, as he is
entitled, verse. 6. And he that shall take the scope and drist to be otherwise,
he misseth of that mark which the Spirit of God directs unto, and shoots his
shafts in vain, and this death is laid down unto us, and for us in a double
respect.

2. For the parts of this Chapter, and they are properly four.

1. The first sets down unto us, the death of Christ as he is crucified in the
world, by wicked hands, or corrupt administrations through the lusts of men,
unto the decay and death of that law of the spirit of life (which is in Christ
Jesus our Lord) in, and by the men of the world, as once the body of Jesus was
crucified and killed doctrinally, by those wicked Jews and all sorts of people
then united in one, and this is contained from the first verse to the seventh.

2. It contains the depth of the Lord Jesus, as he is crucified to the world
in respect of the flesh; that is, to all carnal and corrupt things contained
in the law of the carnal commandment, and hand writing of humane Ordinancs
which is against us, and therefore nailed unto his Cross: And thus he is
slain in the Saints, even in all the Subjects that appertain and belong to
his Kingdom, which consists not of the matters and affairs of this present
world, and this is expressed from verse. 7. to the 12.

3. It gives out an eminent and universal Prohibition, backed with an
exhortation, together with the danger ensuing the not observing thereof, and
that is contained in verse 12.

4. It sets beforre us, or rather romidgeth our hearts to find out in us, and
to bring forth by us those excellent and admirable fruits which spring up in
the godly from the death of Christ, and observation of the prohibition
abovesaid. The Irradian beams whereof are shed forth from verse 12. to the end
of the Epistle.

And first of the death of Christ, as he is crucified in the world, in respect
of his proper spirit and virtue, and that by wicked hands and administrations
both of Jews and Gentiles, that is, such as are strict in Religion according
to the literal command and historical notion, being engaged thereto by that
spirit of bondage, and of fear, and others loose and licentious, not having the
bond of the spirit of God upon them. But using the liberty of the Gospel as an
occasion to the flesh, surreptitiously encouraging themselves thereby to all
excess of riot in the inordinate use of carnal and vanishing things that
perish in the use, and this is done by men of all ranks and qualities, that are
not become one in that chief and principal goodness; reckoning themselves as
nothing in account, but as themselves; their place, authority, and dignity
takes its being, and is summed up in that State, office, and dignity of the
Son of God, otherwise they are such as glory and boast in themselves, which
rejoicing is evil, namely of that wicked one; wherefore he says, verse. 1.

Verse. 1. Go too now ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall
come upon you.
OUr Apostle here expresses himself to the wealthy of the world as rich men,
or collectively (Rich man) as of all in one; that is, man of Sin, or men of
Belial, who greed and gripe after all manner of good (falsely so called) in the
neglect of that one and alone goodness in Christ, that one thing necessary,
that better or best part, which can never be taken from him, who chooses it as
his chief and only treasure.

But to make choice of, and to rejoice and glory in, as an only and rich trade
and treasure besides that, is to stiflle in themselves, and suffocate the life
and spirit of the Lord Jesus, which is thereby extinct, and in them breaths not.

He bids them therefore, Go too now, or come on, as if he would encourage them
in their course. A like phrase is used, Genesis 11. at the building of Babell, Go
too now, or come on; give a word of exhortation and encouragement one to
another for the furtherance of your work: As if he should say, Take your
liberty, use your accustomed trade and traffic to get and gather in abundance
of your corruptible riches, that moth and rust can seize upon; and spare no
pains, miss of no opportunity to make your selves excellent, and glory in it;
only with this proviso, namely that you will assure your selves of the income
and proper return, together with your adventure, and this your practice, upon
that condition, take your best advantage, and full swinge in your course, for
the just resists you not, as is expressed, verse 6. For the Gospel of God is
not a hinderer of wickedness in the men of Belial, no more then the sop which
Christ gave to Judas, together with his speech thereupon, What thou do do it
quickly, hindered him not in the execution of so traiterous an office; for it
is a savor of death unto death unto the unbelievers, and of no less power to
accomplish it, through that spirit which is in the world, then it is of virtue
to be a favor of life unto life in the Saints through that spirit which is in
them: And it is as unpossible that one member of that body of sin should come
to the knowledge of the truth, as it is that any one of the chosen of God should
be deceived with error and wiles of Satan, which Christ affirms it is
unpossible they should be deceived.

For as Christ keeps his family entire and complete, So that none of them is
lost but that son of perdition, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, in
point of wrath proportionable to grace and mercy, which son of perdition
(comprehending all the children of destruction) was lost once and for ever.

Even so does Antichrist mayntaine his interest in all the seed of the Serpent,
and parts with none, only that lost sheep of the house of Israel, as a brand
is plucked out of the fire, being found to be one of the flock of God once and
for ever.

No marvel then, though our Apostle says, Go too now, unto the wicked and
wealthy (in point of Pharisaical excellencies) for as the state of death and
darkness discovered by the Gospel, does sharpen and provoke the godly unto joy
and thankfulness for their deliverance and escape therefrom: Even so does the
state of life and peace discovered in the Saints by the same Gospel sharpen and
provoke the wicked to enmity and despair, which is the expelling of the spirit
of God, and quenching the same in themselves: Therefore he bids them weep and
howl for the misery that comes upon them; hereby, and by weeping he signifies
unto them the departure and loss of all good, even that life of the Lord Jesus,
whom they crucify afresh unto themselves, and make a mock of him, in whose
life all goodness is treasured up, and comprehended, which unto them is
vanished as a vapor; therefore he bids them weep, for the loss of good
causes tears: and by howling, he minds them of that present wrath and torture
which abides upon them, and possesses them; which however it may lie as
Dormant for a time, yet this sin of killing Chrst in the Spirit, is the same
with that of Caines killing his brother, and lies at the door, as the proper
and only inlet of the deluge of Gods wrath into the soul, and indeed into the
world.

For it cuts off the Son of God from being propagated and brought forth in
the world, according to the spirit and power proper to himself: as that wicked
act of Cain cut him off from being brought forth in his geneologie after the
flesh, in the way of Abel, and so makes a nullity of Schin, that makes all
things, and therefore must have all guilt in it, which is the door and inlet
for execution of vengeance: Therefore he adds, for the misery that shall come
upon you; or as the word may be read in the present tense, is come upon you;
For in these twain, that is to say, in the loss of all good, and the
possession of all evil, perfect misery and wretchedness does consist. The
word translated Howl in the Hebrew is Shadad, and signifies to destroy; of
which Zadai is derived, a title given unto God signifying power, or Almighty;
and here is an elegant allusion unto the etymology of the original phrase
used by the Prophets, signifying unto us, that no less then Gods Almighty power
is exercised and put forth to the utmost, in the scattering and destruction of
all such as stifle the Son of God in the breathings of his holy Spirit in
themselves, by preferring and glorying in other things before it; or as it is
in others, by vilifying, contemning, and persecuting it, whereupon the next
phrase is brought in, viz.

Verse. 2. Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are motheaten.
THat is, all the substance they enjoy, boast of, and glory in, is putrified
and changed from that which otherwise, and elsewhere it is, for they
adulterate the holy word of God unto themselves, by subjecting and prostrating
the same unto their own lusts, of pride, cruelty, and vainglory, as though
such things were the natural fruits of it; they bring them forth, and also
nourish and foster them by it, as a Harlot does a child in an adulterous way;
that is, after the way of the letter, that kills, and not in the way of the
Spirit, that gives out the life of the Lord Jesus.

Therefore it is that above he calls them adulterers and adulteresses, telling
them that the love of the world is enmity with God, that is, that which the
world counts love in the height and top of affection, is the proper malice and
enmity of Caine, whereby he kills and crucifies him who is not ashamed to call
his Saints brethren, being flesh of their flesh, and bone of their bone.

And we must know that there is a unity in the Harlot, as well as in the true
Espousall: For he that is joined unto an harlot is one flesh, for two (says
he) shall be one flesh.

By twain there, is not meant creature and creature joined together, but God
and the Creature are become one in that way of the harlot; that is, they are
become one carnal, corrupt, and sinful estate; for there is as near a unity
between God and man, in that man of Sin unto all unrighteousness, in
profaning all the holy things of God unto destruction, in which the holy one
is clear from being a proper actor or agent in any of them all, as there is in
Christ that man of God, unto all righteousness and holiness, by setting
sinful man apart to all honor in salvation, whereby being joined unto the
Lord, is made one spirit with him; that is, they twayn are but one holy, happy,
and righteous estate and condition, wherein man is excluded from being any
proper agent or actor, as in any thing proper and natural to the Creature: So
that man putrifies and corrupts the Son of God in himself through principles
and aptitudes of mind proper to a Creature, but not unto God, subjecting the
things of God to the law of the carnal Commandment, naturally ingraffed and
written in man's spirit, which is the law of sin and death.

And God sanctifies and makes holy man in himself through principles and
aptitudes proper to the Creator himself, and not unto the Creature, by
subjecting it to the will of God according to his wisdom, which is that state
of righteousness, and law of the spirit of life, which is in Christ Jesus our
Lord.

The proper riches and excellencies of the world then are corrupted, and are
become the proper mammon of iniquity; for however they may count upon truth to
come within the compass of their estates and reckonings, to advance their
excellencies thereby, yet it is corrupted unto them, for they have changed the
truth of God into a lie.

Indeed they lay claim to Jesus as a Savior, on whom they hang all their
vanishing, carnal, and Spider-web like hopes. But he is corrupted, and as a
moth in them, being become Shadad, or Shedim, a waster and destroyer.

They monopolize Churches and Congregations of God unto themselves, but they
are corrupted, and are become Synagogues of Satan, and an assembly of evil
doers.

For they are no true Church of Christ, or congregation of the first born of
God (whose names are recorded in heaven) that so expound the word of God, as
they can but apply some one part thereof as their present ornament and
furniture, for they may as well (as indeed they do) lay aside some part of
Christ for the present, and so divide him, and make a nullity of him, as to lay
aside some part of the word of God, as not in present use in their days, being
a garment not holding proportion with their composed body.

But the true Church knows that the end of the Law is Christ, and can tell how
to adorn it self in all ages, with those ancient orders extant in Abraham's
family, as also with all the ornaments exercised amongst those Princely Tribes,
or Scepters of Israel, as under the conduct of Moses and Aaron, Caleb and
Joshuah, Deborah and Barak, David and Samuel, Christ and the Disciples, the
Apostles and all Nations.

Yea, and as under the conduct and ministry of that Angelical constitution and
order set forth unto them in that book of the Revelations, that all shall
harmonize and agree as one joyful and triumphant song, and shout of
deliverance, righteousness, and salvation.

And when the Sun of righteousness lends his irradian beams through any of
these bright clouds of witness, commending it self unto us in any of those
particular ways of administration, wherein the Saints of God have been exhaled
and gathered up into unity and intimacy with the Lord: Yea, when any of the
Saints do Evangelize out of any of the forenamed Administrations, they can
effectually and assumptively express that significant word Selab; which in a
way of asseveration, as also of elevation of the same thing, affirms it to have
a present being, and real appearance, abiding without any end or cessation
thereof, of which nature the things proper to the Son of God exist.

And of such nature is the word of God in all its ways of administration,
being rightly interpreted; and such as manifest and declare it otherwise, they
may indeed assume the riches and glory of a Church, and boast of it as these
do, but it is a corrupted, a vanishing, and vaporous one.

Therefore he says, That their garments are motheaten, that is, all their
honorable Ornaments, wherein the Minister for the increase and deifying of
their corrupted treasure, are inervated, and void of virtue; for the very
substance, pith, and marrow of them is consumed and wasted: so that when she
put them on to appear glorious, then their nakedness appears to all men, so
as they glory in their shame through minding earthly things.

It is a gorgeous garment the world puts on in that point of its Ministry
consisting of an imputed Righteousness, resident in another, but not in him
that confesses it; this garment has lain so long in that Arc of Tradition,
that it is moth-eaten, the strength and virtue of it is taken away, and it was
brought out of the treasury of a carnal Christ, who is sometimes present with,
and sometimes remote from his Church. So that in his absence they are forced to
form unto themselves an imaginary righteousness; for it is a mere Emedullatus,
the pith and marrow of righteousness is taken away.

For that righteousness which is professed out of, or at a distance from the
spirit of Christianity, when or in whomsoever that spirit appears, is not the
rigteousnesse of him who is really present with, or in his Saints to the end of
the world, that is, to the ending and vanishing of all such worldly and carnal
conceptions in the publication of the Gospel.

For if we give another form to the righteousness of Christ, differing in the
nature, efficacy, or dignity in the professor, from that which it is in the
professed, it is not the righteousness which is by the faith of the son of
God.

For as faith is alike real and resident in all that come unto God, even so is
righteousness, and He that comes unto God, must believe that God is; that is,
that he is that to him, or in him, that he comes unto him; for what ever it is,
which is that glorious reward or end given, or accomplished in all the diligent
seekers of him; never did any come to God but by faith, for it is the
hypostasis, or being of God and man in one and the same condition; for it is
said of our spiritual David, He believed, and therefore he spoke; we also
believe, and we also speak.

Faith never differed in nature, form and virtue in any, for then it were not
of God, but of the Creature, no more does righteousness; for where the
righteousness of God admits of distinction in the same relation and respect,
as in point of justification, if the man Christ or Jesus stand righteous before
God, by a righteousness in himself; that is, in that individual, and the
Saints of God stand righteous by that which is in another, and not in that
individual justified; that is not the righteousness of Christ, it is not the
simplicity of him, but is made a compound; Christ is made void to such.

Christ differs not in any of his excellencies wherever they are in use, nor
did he ever come to deny the inheritance between brethren, but to state the
whole Kingdom entirely as upon one only son, in whom soever possesses any
part thereof, even as the firstborn of God: but if the world should not go
upon man's principles to make one man as a Monarch in heaven, it would harldly
maintain the Monarchies upon the earth.

But as it is in the kingdom of God, so it is in all the things of God, and
his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and so is his righteousness; but the
Doctors of the world have no use of their imputed righteousness; when once
their inherent sanctity is perfected, they may as well put an end to the
Kingdom of God, and become companions of the bruit beasts, as to put an end to
the use of any thing that appertayns and belongs to the Son of God in his
Saints.

We conclude therefore, that imputed righteousness in the worlds acceptance
is a moth-eaten garment, a mere phylosophicall distinction of Antichrist, to
delude the world.

Of like worth is the garment of their sanctification, wherein they so
confidently enwrap themselves, for they hold it to be a holiness subject to
increase and diminution; and then it must be a creature-like holiness, and not
a God-like, which is holiness of truth, or the truth of holiness, which is
not found but in the Son of God, which cannot admit of abatements, for that is
proper to a creature from whose strength proceeds all their power of
performances.

Again, the holiness professed by the world (that is by carnal men) may have
the virtue and office of Prayer in it, but not of prophecy also: and it may
have the virtue and office of prophecy in it, but not the virtue of healing
also; this is a moth-eaten holiness, the virtue and power of the Son of God is
eaten out of it, Christ is crucified in such according to the spirit.

For take away one of the virtues of Christ, and they all vanish, for he is
that bundle of life bound up without parting, or any separation: His vesture is
seamelesse, and goes all one way by lot and inheritance, whether it be the robe
of mercy in his, or the garment of vengeance in them that so crucify him, it
may not be divided.

So that he who denies a Christian to have power and authority from God to
publish and preach unto the world the mystery of salvation contained in the
Gospel, may as well deny him power to pray, or to believe, or the grace of
remission of his sins, expressed and declared in those glad tidings.

For the grace of Christ is as truly collective in the subsistence of it, as
distributive; whosoever therefore receives freely, that party has a like
virtue also freely to give.

Moreover the world (who by wisdom know not God) teach by that wisdom that a
Christian may be possessed with, and have the enjoyment of the spirit of
Christ, that holy spirit of the Son of God, and yet the humane nature of Christ
not present, but wholly absent and remote in another place; these men may as well
upon like ground profess themselves to be members of Christ, but not of his
body; for of his Saints he says, Ye are flesh, of my flesh, and bone of my
bone, not of another.

So that the two natures in Christ (according to the mystery of salvation in
the Gospel) are of the same extent that his mystical body is, and are
co-apparent to the wisdom of God in whomsoever it is.

For the spirit of Christ never uttered or manifested it self, but as the son
of sorry man utters and manifests himself in, and by such principles and
abtitudes as are proper and peculiar to the living and eternal God, taking
their being and form from the wisdom and power of God, and not from the
policy and power of a creature; for without the Coagulation of these twayn,
there is no spirit of Christ made manifest, nor is it in its operation.

Therefore to separate the spirit of Christ from the humane nature of Christ,
in any of its operations, is to make a nullity of Christ, the faith of such
persons is vain, their holy garments of the Ministry are moth-eaten, their
righteousness is the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, which enter
not into the kingdom, and their proper holiness is the purification of the
flesh, purging themselves of all the operations of the spirit of life, that no
ray or beam thereof be found upon them, which a wicked man is as careful of,
as the Saints of God are of being stained and spotted with the flesh.

For if we gather not up, and take in true man into all the operations proper
to the spirit of God, we dis-unite and separate that which the wisdom of God
has so curiously embroydered and wrought up together; for the spirit of Christ
and of God quickneth only to that blessed estate and condition of the Son of
God, and not to any other; even as a rational spirit filled with artificial
principles to find out the nature and cause of things, quickneth only unto that
state and condition of mankind, and not unto the condition of any other
creature upon the earth.

Verse. 3. Your gold and your silver is canckered, and the rust of them shall be
a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as fire; ye have heaped
treasure together for the last days.
AS Gold and Silver are the most precious and durable metals in the account
and use of man; so righteousness and holiness are the diadem and duration of
the Gospel of the Kingdom, the son of God, and they are reckoned here as their
Silver and Gold, who crucify the love of life and glory; no otherwise but as
sin is reckoned upon Christ, where it is said, that he was made sin for us
who knew no sin; even so these are made righteous that know no righteousness
of God in Christ.

For the just and unjust are made of like, yea of the very same matter, for God
and man are really to be considered both in the one and in the other, and
otherwise the true state of life and death cannot be rightly composed, neither
is the gospel and faith of the Son of God preached.

For in what tone, sense, or respect man may be said to be in that work of
salvation wrought by Christ, and participate in the power and glory thereof; In
like sense may the Son of God be said to be, and is in that work of
destruction, and participates in the defect and shame thereof.

For as the wisdom of God in that way of Christ, purifies and cleanses that
earthly and corruptible nature of man (in its taking of it into unity) from all
sin and uncleanesse unto a state and condition becoming the Son of the holy
and eternal God; even so does the wisdom of man, or of the flesh (in taking
hold of, and searching into the things of God) corrupt and defile unto, or in
it self, that holiness and purity which is in the word, or Son of God,
unto a state and condition proper and peculiar to that man of sin, and son of
perdition; for the world by widome knows not God; that is, through its proper
wisdom and Serpentine policy, is blinded and become ignorant of him: So that
there is a true and real proportion between the mystery of God in Christ, and
the mystery of iniquity in Antichrist, else the state of the wicked could not
have in it an Almighty power of wrath and displeasure, as the state of the
Saints has in it an allsufficiency of mercy and love, for the proper Original
and fountain of each is in themselves, and not in another, that is to say, the
proper fountain of love and mercy is in Christ, and not elsewhere to be
found; and the proper fountain of wrath and displeasure is in Antichrist, and
not founded elsewhere: So that righteousness and holiness of the word of
God, or Son of God; for it is not the word, but in its creating virtue, as it
frames it self in Christ, and this word is canckered in the world; for God and
man (in a mystery) are become a corrupt estate and condition in that way of
Antichrist, directly contrary unto that oriental Gold, and seven times purified
silver that is in Jesus Christ: and that party who is ignorant of the mystery
of iniquity in the corrupting and adultrating of the word of God, may talk of
the unity that is in Christ Jesus, purifying and making chaste man's nature in
that word of God; but it is only as he has received it by tradition, from
Libraries, Councels, and Accademical courses; but the revelation of the spirit
he knows not, the only means of the conveyance of the knowledge thereof.

The purest metal thus changed becoms rust; and that is, first, witness
against them; secondly, It eats their flesh as fire.

Rust we know is the putrefaction and filthiness of metals contracting it
self, and arising from the not using thereof; even so the not exercising and
putting into use the righteousness and holiness of the word of God, that
royal law of the spirit, is the contraction and raising up of the vision and
corrupt desires of the flesh, which is the very cancker, spot, and stain of
the soul, that it becoms reprobate Silver thereby, not to pass for current to
any in the kingdom of God.

First, and this rust by this means contracted, is a witness against them,
that they have put the just one to death, as it is expressed in Ver. 6.

For as the use and exercise of the law of the spirit in the declaration of the
virtue of Christ Jesus, the contraction and Emitto whereof, is the splendant
brightness of Christianity, testifying unto all men, that therein consists the
crucification of the flesh in all the affections and lusts of it.

Even so the exercise of the law of the flesh in the contraction and sending
forth of the desires and affections thereof, testifies unto all men that
therein consists the crucification and death of Christ Jesus according to the
spirit, testifying an eternal guilt upon an act of such nature as that is,
which is of no less concernment then the kissing of the Son of the eternal God.

Secondly, It eats their flesh as fire; now we know that as rust eats and
consumes the metals in which it breeds, so does fire consume and destroy the
fuel in which it fastneth it self, and takes hold, and without fuel the fire
cease; for take away fuel, and the fire goes out. Now the proper fuel
wherein the wrath of God kindles it self, is the wisdom of the flesh: so
that take away that, and the fire thereof goes out; it is not without that, no
more then fire is without fuel, and therefore no creature in the world is
capable of the eternal wrath of God, but only mankind, no more then any can
be in a capacity of the consolation of God, but such as are endued with his
wisdom.

For as the consolations of God kindle themselves, and become extant, through
that wisdom of God, which has given it self so glorious and an eternal form
in all the virtue, relations, and respects that are between God and man in
Christ, without which the consolations could not be, no more then the eye can
see without light, or a house stand without the pillars and joints of it; even
so the jealousy and wrath of Almighty God kindles it self, becomes extant,
and in exercise, through the wisdom of the flesh, setting such a form on the
operations, relations, and respects, as are conversant in the state of
Antichrist between God and man.

For the wisdom of the creature, or carnal law, is wrath unto execution
against such as use cruelty to the innocent, especially in the highest degree;
and when the proper operations of the word according to the carnal law are made
manifest, it shall appear that they have exercised cruelty against the innocent
Son of God, and that then in the highest degree, in putting him to death in all
that livelihood and operation of his holy spirit which is not permitted to
exercise it self, or breath in them, whereupon they must of necessity by that
their wisdom judge, condemn, and execute wrath upon themselves, which could
not hold proportion with this their fact; but as the power of God kindles it
self therein, yet so as the proper power and spirit of God is not any cause or
original thereof, that is, of their torment, but man himself is the proper
cause and fountain thereof, out of which it for ever flows.

For as the soul of man is kindled and inflamed through the wisdom of God
with the love and consolations of God, yet the soul of the creature is no
proper original or fountain thereof, for they are the love, and comforts of
the Creator, and not of a creature, yet is the creature conversant and active
in them, even so the power and spirit of God kindles it self, through the
wisdom of the flesh (the literal voice of the Scriptures written in all men's
hearts) in wrath and displeasure, and is conversant and infinitely active
therein; yet is the spirit and power of God no proper original or fountain of
wrath, but the wisdom and spirit of the creature is the proper cause and
fountain of it, therefore it is said of the Lord, fury is not in me.

We must remember then, that when the Scriptures ascribe unto man, love, joy,
peace, grace, mercy, glory, power, and virtue proper unto the Saints, they are
such as God is the fountain and cause of, and not the creature, yet are they
the excellency of the Son of God, who is not without the creature, though he
be God blessed for ever.

So likewise when we see the Scriptures ascribe unto God anger, wrath, fury,
displeasure, and vengence, which are proper unto the wicked; they are such as
the creature is the proper fountain and original of, and not God; yet are they
not without God, but are the proper exercise of that man of sin, and son of
perdition, yea of that Shadad, or Shedim, that destroyer of man kind, who is
the God of this world; the Prince that rules in darkness, which is accursed
for ever.

And as for such devils, as are composed through that conjuration of
academicall Nations, from literal expressions of the Scriptures, as connexions
of the dictates of their own hearts; we skill not, but give glory to God, both
in mercy, and severity, in the exercises of them, and so the rest is an
infallible testimony and witness of the nature and practice of Satan himself
the God of this wicked world, therefore the Apostle says, We know that we are
of God, and the world is of that wicked one (as the word is) that is, of the
Devil, the offspring and seed of the Serpent accursed from the beginning.

3. He adds therefore in the third place, Ye have he aped treasure together
for the last day. To heap treasure together, is to augment, increase, enlarge,
and so to fill up, as nothing more can be added, which is impossible, unless
it be an infinite Treasury; and then he who only is infinite, must be in the
store, so that almighty and eternal God, is in the wrath hoarded up against the
day of wrath, and revelation of the just judgment of God; for there is a
fullness of sin, without vacuity, either in respect of time, place or action,
for the sin of the Amorites must be full, when Abraham's seed possess the
land; or else the fullness of our deliverance in Christ appears not, for there
is a fullness in, or fulfillment of the letter of the Scripture in that way of
Judas, in his betraying of Christ unto death, as there is a fullness in that
law of the spirit, or fulfillment of the Scripture in bringing forth unto light,
and of that Emanuel, God with us;

For as Christ being true, man naturally mortal, is filled with eternal life
in the excellency and purity of the Son of God; so Antichrist being true God
(in the unity of his creation) immortal, becomes filled with eternal death,
through the lusts and corruption of man, for it is whole Christ that dies, and
not a part of him, he dies in the Saints unto sin, Satan, and all corruptable
things: So that when the Prince of this world comes, he finds not in him to
join himself with, or lay claym unto, and he dies in the unbeleife unto all
things of the spirit, acceptable unto God; and in this does that ransom
consist, wherein the Son of God has given himself unto an eternal death to
deliver his chosen ones, into that eternal life proper and peculiar to the lord
alone.

His dying unto the flesh in his Saints, is the life and resurrection of it in
the men of the world; and his dying unto the spirit in the wicked, is the life
and resurrection of it in the Saints of God, for neither of them must be
annihilated; but as man at the first was made in the Image of God, and the word
was made dust, that is, in that work of God both the wisdom proper to a
creature was to be found, and that wisdom also proper to the Creator, these
twain must remain extant for ever; that is, the wisdom of God extended to
the uttermost in that curious workmanship of the mystical and glorious body of
Christ.

And also the wisdom of the creature must be extended to the uttermost in that
composure of the body of sin and death, which is only the curiosity of that
confusion in the building of Babell, there is a heaping up then, and an
absolute fullness of corruptable treasures and riches in the wealth of the
world. But

For what is it heaped together? that is, for the last days: by days here is
to be understood times and seasons, and the word (last) signifies, the least or
basest days and times, as often it does in the Scriptures, so that this
treasure rightly reckoned, and justly summed and cast up, amounts to the worst
and basest of days, a time wherein the Son of God exists not, nor is he
therein found, a day not of salvation but of destruction, a season of death and
not of life; days of sorrow, and not of joy; base times of famine, and not of
plenty; of pestilence, and not of health; of war, and not of peace; times of
murder and cruelty, and not of love and freindship; days of enmity, pride, and
diabolical policy, and not days of that meekness of wisdom that is in the
Son of God.

In a word, the heaping together of the fruits of the flesh as our only
treasure, is to the bringing forth of such times and seasons wherein the policy
and power of Satan rules, and not the simplicity that is in the wisdom and
virtue of the Son of God, unto which season the oath of the Angel has
respect, that stands with one foot on the sea and the other upon the earth, and
swears by him that lives for ever that time shall be no more; that is, with
respect unto that foot that stands upon the troublesome and tumultuous estate
and condition of that sea of evils of the world, he swares that no jot, nor
tittle, time, nor moment of the life or day of Christ shall ever be found,
there he cease in them for ever, and a baser time can never be then to be
void of him, even as that time is most precious and glorious, and those only
are halcyon days wherein he appears, and Satan, or ought of him is not found
in them no not for a moment.

He shows in one particular wherein the baseness of these days consists, and
that is in the fraudulent detaining and keeping back the hire of the labourer.

Verse. 4. Behold the hire of the laborers which have reaped down your fields,
which is of you kept back by fraud, cries, and the cries of them which have
reaped, are entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabbath.
Wherein observe,
1. The note of aspect, and looking up, Behold. 2. Who the laborers are that
reap down the fields. 3. What the labor and reaping is. 4. What the hire of
the labourer is. 5. What the cries thereof is that cries. 6. Into what the
cries enter, that is, into the ears of the Lord. 7. The title or term of
honor given unto him, that is, the Lord of Sabbath.
ANd first of the note of aspect, Behold, which signifies to look up in the
observation of a sign or wonder which is now to appear, and it is of like
nature of that of the Prophet Jonah given unto the Jews that crucified Christ,
which was a sign of their destruction, in that the Son of man was to lie
buried three days and three nights in the heart of the earth; that is, to be
perfectly and perpetually dead and buried in their earthly and carnal hearts,
never to exercise his life and spirit in them, which is a sign and wonder that
the Son of the living God should be mortallized in them, it is a like sign and
wonder here, that the Son of God should become a hireling defrauded of his
hire.

For it is a like miraculous thing, that the Son of sorry man, who is said to
be a worm, an object, a vapor, a vanity, to be made Lord of Heaven and Earth,
Judge of quick and dead, as that he that is Lord, ruler, and possessor of all
things, to become a hireling: So that the mystery of iniquity is not without
sign and wonder, no more then the mystery of God is, and both real; though
the one be a lying wonder, and the other a true wonder, the one confirms the
faith of God, the other the faith of Devils.

The one promises salvation for the confirmation of Pharaoh in the hardening of
his heart unto destruction, which is a thing contrary, and therefore a lying
wonder, as it appears in Pharaoh and his host drowned in the sea; the other
promises salvation and deliverance unto Israel in Moses and Aaron, which
brings forth the thing promised, and therefore a true and not a lying wonder,
as appeared in Isreal's marching triumphantly out of Egypt.

Now there must be in a miracle, or wonder, that which goes beyond the power
of any nature, else it is not a wonder, and that is both in the one and the
other of these miraculous signs; for in point of salvation by Christ, no
simple nature can bring forth salvation, for there must be in salvation both a
Savior, and a saved, else it is not full and complete, which neither the
nature of man, no nor the nature of God simply and disjunctively considered,
can be or bring forth: Behold then a wonder in that, which transcends and
surpasses any nature to be or to bring forth, therefore it is said, that we
have a Mediator is made higher then the heavens; that is, the office of his
mediatorship is of that super-eminent dignity that no simple nature can be, or
attain unto, therefore of twain he makes one new man in himself and so
creates peace, which otherwise could not be.

2. Again there is a wonder in destruction, which goes beyond any simple and
single nature also.

For the nature of God simply considered cannot be involved with the confines
of destruction, who is almighty and supreme Lord over all, neither can man's
nature simply and disjunctively considered be in a capacity of an eternal
destruction, being a creature subject to the limits and precincts of time,
therefore God and man are to be jointly considered in that wonder and mystery
of iniquity also; which properly makes and gives being unto the God of this
world, which is no less then Satan himself, who attempts through his
arrogating and insatiable spirit to tender unto Christ all the kingdoms of the
Earth, and the glory of them: the one of these is a wonder, but a lying one,
because it brings not forth what it promises, as the righteousness of the
Scribes and Pharisees is a righteousness, but not that which enters into the
kingdom, and the other is a wonder, and a true miracle, because it brings to
pass the things it promises, even as the righteousness of Christ enters into
the kingdom, and sits in safety and honor at the right hand of God.

And they that preach not the Gospel as accompanied with these signs in the
ministry of it, according to the variety of the work proposed; the speaking and
creating word of his signs is not sent unto that people for their release and
deliverance out of the house of bondage, and yet it is true, that tongues are
for a sign not to them that believe, but to them that believe not, that is, an
unbeleiver, ever expects that a sign should speak in the same form which
formerly it has done, or else he takes it not for a wonder wrought by God, but
then there should need no interpretatiin the Church at all, without which
tongues are not of use, unto edefying.

The worlds expectation of signs to accompany the preaching of the Gospel for
the confirmation of it in the same form as formerly, is the expectation of
Infidels, such as follow Christ to be fed with carnal things, bread that
perishes in the use, like them that after they had been fed miraculously with
the loaves and the fishes they pursue and follow him to have a sign that he is
a man of God, and conclude that Moses was a man of God, that could give bread
from heaven, but this not coming in like for me, but from the Earth, though in
that wonderful multiplication and increase, is as nothing unto them.

But the signs, wonders, and mighty works accompanying the grace of the Gospel
never appear twice in the same form, so that a man may as well expect the
water that now bubleth up in a living and swift running fountain, to tarry and
abide for him, till his return to it again, as to fit down by a wonder wrought
by God till it appear in the very same form again; it coming out of that
inexhaustible fountain, and swift running current of that infinite variety of
his wisdom and power.

Moses miraculously fasted forty days and forty nights, and is in the mount
with God, and has in that fast the law the perfect pattern of all truth and
holiness presented and showed unto him, and again Christ fasted forty days
and forty nights, but was in the wilderness among wild beasts, and therein
had the temptations of Satan, the proper platform of the power of darkness
represented unto him, which differs much from the pattern of salvation and
kingdom of light. Eliah also fasted forty days and forty nights, but was
miraculously fed before; in the strength of which food he went into a cave by
the mount of God, and there had apparitions and voices manifested unto him,
wherein God made himself manifest, and also such wherein God appeared not at
all; one forty days fast, not but in variety of wonder; one death of Christ,
but a diverse sign in it, he is slain at Jerusalem, and our Lord is also
crucified in Sodom, and in Egypt, true in both, with respect to flesh and
spirit.

And so much for the word Behold, implying a wonder, wherein observe the
deceitful sleights and cunning devices of the Magissians, the Jannes and
Jambres of our days, who have erected (for the confirmation of Princes great
signs of honor and Godlike prosperity) Kings Chapels, and pulpits of State,
State-prayers, and state-like officers in the Church for forming of them, that
they may carry their virtue by whomsoever uttered, state-religion and
state-like pomp in the exercise of it, as though the Kings of the earth should
be thereby declared to be, not only the offspring of the almighty, but the
deputed Gods.

In what does the success and issue of these Doctors endeavors end in,
differing from those Magissians in Egypt, in the confirmation and
encouragement of their King, first born and his alies.

2. The second point is, who the Laborers are, or the Labourer, for the word
may be read either singular or plurally, as it usual in Scripture to use words
of active and passive signification, as also such as may be read either in the
masculine or feminine gender, without wrong to the Text: so also such as will
bear either the singular or plural number, and so it is in this place.

To take the word therefore in the singular acceptance, it is Christ
collectively considered, in that one entire and mystical body of his,
comprehending all the Saints in all ages of the world.

Again, take it plurally (Laborers) and it is Christ distinctly distributed,
and given out in all the parts and members of that body; for he is that
Labourer or Husbandman that sowes good seed in his field, though the evil one
sow tares in the time of his sleep, or when, and where he is dead to all things
of the spirit, which is in that evil one only upon whom they grow.

He sowes with his own hand, as he is that one fountain and giver out of the
seed in all ages, yesterday, and to day, and for ever the same. And his
seeds-men sow also, as he is a participator and the receiver thereof; for he
receives the spirit though not by measure, for it is immence.

3. The third point is, what the labor is in reaping down the fields: By
reaping here, is not meant cutting down, but in gathering also, as the
word-imports. Christ's reaping therefore is the cutting down of all those
riches, and ripened fruits of the flesh, those superfluous branches from the
true Vine, that they be not found in the field; or upon that hand of Emanuel,
which elsewhere is said to be the crueifying of the flesh in the affections
and lusts, and the slaying of the enmity in himself, which are the proper in
gatherings of the work; and that whereof their harvest and Vintage does
consist, whereby their regions become white unto the harvest; that is, it sets
them in a capacity to be cut down by an eternal destruction, and in these the
labourer is defrauded, who has spent his strength (in them) in vain, or unto
emptiness, and labored for naught, as he complains by his Prophet (or in the
Prophet) Isaiah: In them he has lost his time, as a labourer has who is
deprived of his hire, for his time and age is not extant in them; the time of
grace is expended, the day of salvation is not found in them, his generation is
ceased in them, and is no more: even as a labourer has lost his time, so spent
as no fruit nor profit arises; For he is cut off from the land of the living,
(in the world) and has made his grave in the wicked, and in the rich of this
world is his death.

For the Son of God has expended his life in Antichrist, unto no fruit or
profit of the Spirit, but unto corruption; as the Son of man has expended his
life in Christ, unto no utility or fruit of the flesh, but unto purity and
holiness.

4. Therefore in the fourth place, they are said to keep back his hyre; the
hyre of a labourer is to return unto him a reward proportionable to his work.
The word (hire) signifies to gather together, as a Master gathers to himself a
servant to be answerable one to another by contract, which the world in that
unity of the harlot denies unto Christ; for he that is holiness gives and
unites himself unto them, but they return no such thing unto him but only
corruption: He who is love in himself is united unto them, but they return
nothing but enmity: He who is truth gives himself to them, but they return a
lie unto him: He who is eternal life gives himself to them, but they return
eternal death unto him, and so hold no proportion with him unto whom they are
contracted, nor bring they forth any thing for his supply suitable (in the
least) to his nature and quality: Whereas the Saints make return to God with
things which are of God, holding proportion with him, with whom they are in
contract: For they are increased with the increasings of God; for of his
fullness we all receive, and grace for grace. It is the love of God shed abroad
in their hearts, which is the love by which they make over themselves in
contract unto him, and become Espousals together with him, and can say with
David (that beloved one) All things are thine, and of thine own we have given
thee. Which the world falls infinitely short of, yea is in direct Antithesis
unto the same, therefore they are said to keep back by fraud, deceit, or guile,
because they give that unto themselves and things of the creature, which
belongs unto the Lord, and things that are of him; they give unto themselves
wisdom, power, and glory, which is the prerogative Royal of the Son of God,
defrauding him of his right; for they give their sons unto Moloch, or unto the
King; that is, unto the Kingdom and glory of the world, wherein there is as
absolute a change of the word of God from its proper nature and operation to
become sinful and diabolical in them, in that way of Antichrist, as there is
of sinful man from his natural properties, to become that holy Son of God in
the way of Christ; therefore they that gave their sons unto Moloch, that is,
to the reign, dominion, and counsel of the flesh, they are said to sacrifice
unto Devils, and not unto God; no greater fraud then to give that to the
Devil, which is pretended to be given unto God: and it is the proper work of
Satan to bow the heart to the glory of the creature, whereby he keeps back,
and retains to himself that honor which is proper to the Creature.

These persons defraud the Son of God of his livelihood, who only lives by his
labor; for where there is no operation and work of Christ, there is no life of
Christ, no work of faith, no labor of love, no patience of hope, no breathings
of Christ, he is dead in that heart; for the Religion of God is not notionall,
but efficatious: The Lord Jesus lives by his labor, the world defrauds him of
it, detaining it in their own sinful and selfish operations, whereby they
withold the truth in unrighteousness; the titles given unto Christ, as of a
person, King, Lord, Prince, etc. As of an office, as Mediator, Advocate,
Intercessor: Or of relations, as Father, Husband, friend, or the like, are
carefully to be taken up and assumed by the Creature as they do concern the
honor, office, and relation of this life, yet they may be assumed in that
respect, as we may eat and drink, marry and give in marriage, which all
perish in the use, provided that they be assumed, as we are (to buy) or as we
are to marry; that is, as though we possessed them not, and as though we assumed
them not, for the fashion of this world passes away; that is, that which men
may form unto themselves to be excellent and praiseworthy, may at another
time, or in another place become odious and abominable, as we have seen in the
name King, Bishop, Priest, having many wives, and keeping only to one, have
been: But to assume them, or teach men so to do, as things appertaining to the
dignity, office, or relation of a creature, not considered in Christ, but as it
concerns creature and creature, to be the ultimate end, scope, and drift of the
Scripture in any Title, Office, or Relation whatsoever, is satanicall and
wicked, for the end of the law is Christ; therefore the scope of them all, and
every particular, is God and man in Jesus Christ, and thither it is to be
brought, and there centred, or else we defraud the labourer, by detayning his
due unto our selves, or rather giving it unto Satan himself. In which the cry
of the defrauded one does consist, which is the fifth point propounded in order.

5. And this cry is the cry of the blood of Abel for the exercise of wrath in
wrong done unto the innocent, whose life as it is taken away by force and
cruelty of Cain that manslayer from the beginning, so is it taken away by
guile and subtilty, defrauding (by the Serpent) him of the proper means of his
living, which is his own operations, the fruits of that tree of life, by
giving the glory and virtue to make wise, unto the tree of knowledge of good and
evil, which is a preferring the law of the flesh above the law of the spirit,
the wisdom of man above the wisdom of God.

For as the wisdom of God in that law of the spirit through its curious device
of the joynting of God and man to be one estate and condition, carries in it a
sufficient and prevalent argument to move the tender compassions and bowels of
mercy therein, as in an only beloved son; even so the wisdom of man in that
law of the flesh, craftily insinuating the glory and power of the arm of flesh,
to be the glory and power of God, giving unto it what is only proper to God,
has in it a sufficient acclamation and argument to move the exercise of Gods
wrath in the soul, as in one that is guilty of an infinite deceit of Serpents
subtilty.

Yea, as that lifeblood of sprinkling, of the Lamb slain according to the
flesh, in that house of the Israelite, struck upon the door-posts and Lintels
thereof (that is, upon all the ways of egresse and regress into, and out of
the same) has in it a sufficient testimony and cry of restraint in the
destroying Angel, to cause him to pass over, as not having any employment
there.

Even so the blood of Abel shed by the cruelty of Cain, as a Lamb slain from
the beginning according to the spirit; or by the subtilty of Judas betraying
him with a kiss, has in it a sufficient cry in the destroying Angel, to move
the exercise of wrath upon the first born of Egypt, the beginning and top of
all that strength wherein they trust, who cruelly and fraudulently keep back
Israel from his advance unto the land of Canaan.

The one has in it the voice and language of peace, reconciliation, and
agreement with God as his firstborn, and only beloved.

The other has in it breach of brotherhood, and fellowship, the voice of a
vagabond flying from Gods presence, and the glory of his power, as in Caine;
and wrath unto self-murder and destruction, as in Judas Iscariot, that
Confessor, or Preacher for hire, as his name signifies, in whom the word of God
(in it self Lord over all) is changed and transformed into an hireling.

6. This cry enters into the ears of the Lord; for as there is a certain
propencity in the ear of a man to take in any sound, that moves the air; and
to give it a true and proper form, his heart ecchoing the same thing, whether
it be matter of joy, or matter of terror. Even so there is nothing that moves
either in the proper sphere of Gods displeasure, or of his acceptance and
love: but there is a proper and immediate aptitude in his wisdom and power to
receive and give a true form thereunto according to the nature thereof,
ecchoing the same thing, in returning an answerable and proportionable measure
of wrath or mercy into that heart in which it moves, where he has place of a
boad, either in way of mercy, as man by unity is become the Son of God in
Christ, or else in wrath, as God is by unity also become the son of perdition
in that way of Antichrist.

7. And therefore that term and title of honor is given him, namely the Lord
of Sabbath, or Sabboths plurally; for that which the Prophet Isaiah writes, the
Lord of Hosts plurally, the Apostle to the Romans writes, the Lord of Sabbath,
that is, the Lord of Rest, or plurally Rests, and this declares unto us that
wonder of Gods rest or cessation from his work and labor in the beginning, and
and how he works also even until now.

For God rests, and there is an absolute cessation of all works and operations
proper to the Son of God, in that way of the fall, eating of the forbidden
fruit, or exercise of the carnal commandment, in which no virtue, motion, or
operation of the spirit is found, but an utter and absolute cessation from them
all; and so the earth is said to enjoy its Sabboths, by Gods laying of it wast
from its inhabitants, and in this condition the operations of the flesh and
power of Satan are found, and frequently in exercise.

Again, God rests and cease from labor; for we never understand the name
God in a good and proper sense, but with respect unto God in Christ, by whom
the worlds were made: and in him God rests, and there is an utter and total
cessation from all the works of sin and death, fruits of the flesh, and
operations of Satan, which man's nature is subject unto; there is a perpetual
rest, cessation, and sabbatizing in the Son of God from them all: but there is
a most glorious operation of the spirit, and powerful work of the Son of God
in that estate and condition of Jesus Christ, who is that rest that yet remayns
in the people of God, therefore it is said, hitherto the father works, and I
work; and therefore the word Saba, in the Hebrew tongue, signifies either
Sabbath, a Rest, or an Host or Army; and sometimes the Apostles in Greek
translates it, Lord God Almighty, to declare that there is an Almighty power of
conquest in whomsoever the rest is found, for there is an Almighty power of the
whole host of Satan's enmity, in conquering and subduing the spirit and virtues
of Christ in themselves, resting from them all.

And there is an Almighty power of the spirit of grace in that Army of Heaven,
and order of the Son of God, in vanquishing and subduing of all the power of
sin and Satan, unto that perfect rest which ever remayns in that only and
beloved Son of God.

And truly, the world may as well preach the temporal sword to be the Rescue,
Reformer, and Conservation of the Church, as the best and greatest Council,
Synods, Synodrians, and Assemblies that ever were, or can be gathered together
only in the strength and power of humane learning, wisdom, experience, and
policy; for in such the Lord is in array, as an host, and in rest and
cessation; but it is to do that work, that strong work of wrath not proper to
the Son of the blessed, whereby he rests from all his own operations as the
ensuing words do declare.

Verse. 5. Ye have lived in pleasures on the earth, and been wanton, ye have
nourished your hearts as in a day of slaughter.
YOu have lived in pleasure on the earth (as Dives, or that rich man did) that
is, you have taken delight, and made it your very living to exercise your
selves in earthly and temporary things, all your dealings and commerce is in
such things, as your selves cannot but confess must have an end, and cease to
be, and therefore earthly, as your bodily fasts and humiliations; your bodily
feasts, and verbal thanksgivings for vanishing things; your Sabboths only in
cessation from bodily labor; your earthly victories and honorable
achievements, these are the food you feed on, the things wherein your delight
and pleasure is set, and must they not have an end? If so, then are they
earthly, because they fade and vanish as the flower of grass.

Nay the order of your Churches and Elderships, the ordination and institutions
of your Oracles and Orators, will these stand with the Assembly and Church of
the firstborn of God, whose names are enrolled in heaven, where every one has
a like share, and equal right to all the offices, orders, and privileges of
the kingdom? if not, they are earthly, composed by the ministry of the letter
that kills, and not by the law of the spirit of life.

Add further; what is your faith, your prayers, and righteousness, are not
these earthly and carnal, as held and practiced by you? Can you tell what use
to put them unto in your professed world to come? I tro not; for, for any thing
that ever I could learn from the common Priesthood of these days, they have no
use of the imputed righteousness of the Son of God, when once their
sanctification is completed; nor of their faith, when they have attained the
end of it, which they say is at their coming to heaven; nor of prayer, when
they shall need no more to converse with, or have supply of the things of this
present life: and are not these carnal and vanishing then, as held and
practiced by the Doctors of our days, together with their followers and
Pupils; where then shall we find the men that take not their delight, and place
their pleasure in earthly and vanishing things, whose religion is not vaporous.

Whereas the truth is, there is nothing of Christ which has not the nature
divine in it, or else it is not an ordinance, act, exercise, or virtue becoming
the Son of God who in all things is holy and pure, and there is no holiness
without the spirit of God; therefore they may as well hold and teach that the
spirit of God vanishes, and comes to an end in the Saints, as that any
Ordinance, Office, Act, Exercise, or Virtue of Christ vanishes and comes to an
end in any of his mystical body.

For if the unity of the Spirit cease in them in any respect, then the wisdom
and power of the Spirit cease, and then that new Commandment, or law of the
Spirit is abrogated, and made void, which the Apostle says is true in him, and
in us, because the darkness is past, and the true light shines, which is the
substance of the Law in every point and particular of it: And where the light
of God once shines to expel darkness in us, it ever abides, yea in that
imputed righteousnssse, or righteousness reckoned together with us in faith,
prayer, or whatsoever, it abides firm and stable, as the Son of God is firm
and stable.

And as for eating, drinking, marrying, and giving in marriage, with all things
of like nature transient, having an end, they are no proper parts of the
Kingdom of God, nor any thing whereof it does consist, but are useful in their
time and season to the Saints of God, and may be exercised with a holy respect
unto the Kingdom, for the promoting of it; therefore it is said, Whether ye
eat or drink, or whatsoever ye do, let all be done to the glory of God.

Therefore when they asked Christ that question, whose wife she should be in
the resurrection, who had had seven husbands; his answer is, that they err,
not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God, for in the resurrection they
neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are like the Angels of God in
heaven; Therefore it follows,

And been wanton.
That is, they join with these earthly pleasures wantonness, they are become
effeminate, womanish, having estranged themselves from that heroical and
masculine spirit which the Apostle exhorts unto, Stand fast in the faith, quit
you like men, be strong; that is, behave your selves as men of God, going forth
in his strength, and not in the strength of the arm of flesh, which is true
weakness and womanish.

But these are become wanton and lascivious, doting upon transitory and
vanishing things, letting the substantial pass, being subdued and overcome
with pictures, shadows, and semblances of things that have no substance nor
validity in them, and not with the things themselves, being taken by the sight
of a wandering eye, and the hearing of a sensual ear, as the woman was by the
words of the Serpent, and show of the fruit in the beginning.

These Siberificall persons, being widows, in respect of any espousall with
Christ, for they are such as wax wanton against Christ, and will marry, in
making contracts with forms of earthly Governments, forms of Churches, forms of
ordinances, and exercises, wantonizing in their carnal copulations, with
bread, wine, and water, oil, spittle, and cream, so devoutly that none must
intermeddle with their minnions, but such as do it by contract, according to
their law, of Carnulentia, and if any conceive by any other seed then by their
pulse and lentiles, which only serves to make red, earthly, or Edoms broth,
that profane fornicatour, such persons are presently counted breakers of
covenant, pernicious persons, Heretics, Schismatics, and blasphemers of their
gods.

These have forgotten that ancient, and masculine spirit of wisdom and
gravity, so skilful in geneology and chronology, that it can reckon it self up
together with eternity, see Prove. 8. from v. 22. to 31.

Which takes its delight and solace only in the compass or circuit of his
earth, or of his land, which the Prophet styles the Lords land, therefore he
presently interprets it, and says his delight is with the children of men,
where he dwells and in whom he makes his proper abode.

This spirit threfore in whomsoever it is, takes delight in nothing as to place
its pleasure in it, but in eternal things which God in the Messiah only is,
and all other creatures, relations, and operations, are but as so many letters
or figures to lead unto, and point out, what man is in Christ, in whom the
delight and pleasure proper unto godliness is only set.

Because nothing else (as delightful) can be eternal, for eternal truth we know
none but only in Christ, for he is that way that truth and that life of
eternity, besides whom nothing can hold correspondency with God so, as to be
the object, or subject matter of his delight and pleasure.

And howsoever there is in the godly man, that which is a creature made within
the bounds and precincts of time, yet that unity is eternal, because in
whatsoever the unity does consist is properly of God who is eternity, and not
of the creature which is in time; if it be love, it is the love of God, and not
of a creature; if wisdom, it is of God and not of man; if it consist in power,
it is infinite and not finite, so that that state and condition of God and man
in one is eternal and not temporary, it lives the life of God, it walks and
works by the wisdom of God, and not of the creature.

We know the body of man has life and wisdom as well as the soul, while it is
in conjunction with it, not another, but the same that is in the soul, much
more has the soul of a christian life and wisdom, in and of God, and not
another, so long as it is in conjunction with God, which is for ever, or else
his Son, his proper offspring should not inherit and be posessed with the
nature of the father.

If the mortallists of our days knew the way of salvation by Christ, they
could never conclude like beasts, that the soul of man dies with the body like
a beast, for God is not only in unity with the soul as a worker and Creator,
but he is also one in the workmanship which is made, for the Son of God is as
truly said to be made of woman, and made under the law, as he is said to be the
Lord and maker of all things.

And it is the Image or wisdom of God that gives being and form unto that
glorious workmanship of God in man; so that if the soul dye, there is not a
nullity of the work, but also of the Creator the maker of it, who gives the
proper being and form to the work by that which is of himself and not of a
creature, for it is his Image or wisdom which is the being and form of it, as
the reason and understanding of a man gives being and form to a man, and unto
no other creature.

Without which wisdom and Image of God the workmanship of Christ never was,
nor can be, for it never was but in that Image, life and wisdom of God, and
without unity with God nothing can be eternal.

And however these men are ignorant of the state of the Son of God, yet they
shall know that their souls are eternized also, and that only by unity with
the Almighty and eternal God, but in the way of the harlot, in adulterating
and falsifying the word of God, and that in the way of the mystery of iniquity
as truly as Christ is in the mystery of God, or is that mystery of God, for the
mystery of the Gospel consist wholly in him.

Those therefore whose darling and dalliance is not but in and with temporary
and transitory things, which exercise and lay out their strength and substance,
in and about them, as their wisdom, policy, learning, time, study and all
their aquired abilities (for the Greek word translated wanton, sometimes
signifies A monstrous profusion, pouring out, and expending ones self without
measure in, and unto all lasciviousness) such are the persons the Apostle here
speaks of, whose proper strength is spent in things they cannot eternize, and
are the proper crucifiers of Christ as those were of old, who employed the
strength of their zeal in and about outward ceremonies and beggarly rudiments,
destitute of the true substance, and body, which is Christ, who are further
decribed and set forth in the next phrase.

Ye have nourished your hearts as in a day of slaughter.
The word translated Nourish, signifies to feed, sustain, or foster, as Joseph
is said to nourish his father and his brethren in Egypt with all manner of
necessaries, whereupon he is called the feeder and stone of Israel, as being
that corner stone that coupleth the building together, or the rock and
foundation whereon it stands, as our spiritual Joseph is, the Greek word
Citometrion, is used for a portion of meat, who then is that faithful and wise
Steward, whom the Lord shall make ruler over his house, that Nourishes (or
gives a portion of meat) in due season.

The word translated heart, signifies in this place, pleasure or delight; so
where one Prophet says, Solomon had finished the Lords house, and the house of
the King, he had done all that was in his heart; which another Prophet
expressing the same thing says, he had done all that pleased him; so where it
is said, speak comfortably or pleasingly to Jerusalem, the word is, speak to
the heart of Jerusalem, so where it is said, I will allure her and bring her
into the wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her; the word is, I will speak
in her heart, (meaning Israel the Church of God) and many the like.

And by a day of slaughter here, is meant a day or time of feasting as it is
said by the Prophet Isajah, that the Lord called unto weeping and morning, to
baldness and girding with sackcloth, and behold joy and gladness, slaying of
oxen and killing of sheep, eating of flesh and drinking wine, even as these are
called also to weep and houle for the misery that is upon them; for he that
beleives not, wrath abides upon him; that is, in being already; the sum is,
that they have fed their pleasures, and fostred themselves in their hearts
delights, as in a day of captivity, making their exercise in transient things,
their feastival season and time, delighting themselves therein unto the full,
in which the slaughter and killing of the just one does consist.

For nothing can feed unto fullness but by mortifying of that whereon it feeds,
because it must turn into the substance and nature of the thing fed and
nourished.

So that a wicked man takes not away his own proper life in his banqueting
and wantonizing in the corrupt desires of the flesh, and things which are
transitory and fading; but he takes away the life of another, he slayes not
himself who lives after the flesh; but he slayes that Fatling the Lamb of God,
by temporizing and earnallizing that word of God unto himself, and so it
becomes his proper nourishment, which is that portion of meat which the world
universally (in its wicked and unfaithful Stewards) gives unto its Pupils;
therefore it is that Christ makes that complaint in all his Saints, For thy
sake are we killed all the day long, and counted as sheep for the slaughter;
that is, the great day of feasting unto the world, without the mortification of
whom they cannot be fed; for the two witnesses are killed in Christ, which are
the two Candlesticks, which hold forth all light of truth, and the two olive
trees, which feed the light with oil that it never go out, but stand before
the god of the earth; that is, as David's seed is said to be before God as the
Sun, that is steadfast and firm for ever in glory, as God himself is.

Yea, they are those two Prophets which prophesied one thousand two hundred and
three score days, which is the same time of two and forty months; and of
Elias his three years and six months of drought, as also of the three days
and an half, wherein they lie unburyed, only in variety of glory, and truth of
witness and testimony which is in a two fold respect, and they that state the
witness in any other, carnallize the word of God, who can only witness by
prophecy or interpretation unto the eternal estate of the man of God, as also
of that man of sin, which are those two great Candlesticks whereon the light of
Gods mercy and severity shine for ever, which never wants oil for the trimming
and supply of it, signified by those two olive trees, which none can interpret
but the spirit of God it self; therefore it is not done by army, nor by power,
but by spirit says the Lord of hosts; for no man can give a true
interpretation or testimony of the eternal estate and condition of the just and
unjust for time to come: but he that can witness unto it as it is eternal, with
respect of time past also, which none can do save our Zerubbabel, that stranger
from Babels confutation (as his name signifies) therefore they who affirm an
eternal condition unto just and unjust for time to come, and cannot interpret
in point of looking back how it is really without beginning, they affirm they
know not what, and are false witnesses against Christ the Son of God: and where
this testimony fails, the witnesses are killed, and put to death, which is in
that Sodom and Egypt, where our Lord is crucified: And as they are dead in
the world for three days and an half, so are they alive the same term of time
in God, and never want oil to give the light and brightness thereof; in the
one we see from what we are eternally delivered, and in the other to what we
are eternally delivered, so that the three days and half is the same with
that time, times, and the division of time, in which the woman is said to be in
the wilderness, it is for a time; that is, one simple time or act of eternity,
it is times plurally; that is, there is a time of the Son of God, wherein
nothing of the son of perdition is contained; and there is a time of the son of
perdition, wherein nothing proper to the state of the Son of God is contained.

And there is the division of time, that is, in one simple individual act of
eternity, they are everlastingly separated and divided, infinitely remote from
each other in all things which appertain and belong unto them.

If this Candlestick were not removed (for it is but one by the testimony of
the Prophet Zachary, with seven bowls) and this oil and light extinct in the
world, and these Prophets, or this Prophet killed, the men of Belial could
never glut themselves with the things of the flesh, nor so send abroad and
communicate the gifts thereof one with another as now they do, holding only to
the word of the beginnig of Christ, and cease not therefrom, or the elements
and rudiments of Christ; or if you will, the letter of Christ, or literal
Christ, as the word imports, that historical Christ contained in such a time
of the word, and not else extant, confined to such a place, elsewhere not
really present, visible only in such a particular person, or else not
apparent, nor to be found: These men that are ever laying again the foundation
of repentance from dead works, faith toward God of the doctrine of baptism,
and laying on of hands of the resurrection from the dead, and of eternal
judgment, having them still to begin as in a subject out of Christ, not
placing them all in that one eternal act of God in forming of Christ, as in
that common faith once and for ever delivered unto the Saints, but have ever a
new fabric to set up which is not yet raised, and an old house to pull down,
not yet demolished; whereas the sum of the Gospel is only to proclayme what
is (Ad sum) these men never attain that perfection which the Apostle there
only exhorts and leads unto.

These men will never suffer the carcasses of the Prophets to be buried, for
their dead bodies must lie in the streets of that great City where our Lord is
crucified; that is, they must set up a livelesse form of an eternal estate, to
allure and terrify the world: but take away that proper spirit and life, that
is the only agitator and mover in each of them, giving a livelesse form to a
Church and Ordinances, as also the world and practices thereof, with no more
substance of the proper spirit of either, then there is the virtue of fire in a
shadow thereof painted upon a wall, which to see a company of men to stand by,
and diligently turning themselves to warm, in extremity of cold, would make a
wise man admire: Such is the care and zeal of most Churches (if not of of all)
erected in these days; they have taken away the life of the Prophets, but keep
a dead form, as the Pharisees built their Sepulchers: They have barked my Olive
tree (as the Prophet complayns) that no sapp nor oil can ascend: And they have
taken away the seven lamps and pipes from the top or head of the Candlestick,
that no light can shine in the Sauctuary.

And as it is the greatest shame and abomination for man not to bury his dead
(his own kind) out of sight, when his nakedness does appear, being disroabed
of all humane abilities, even so it is the abomination and shame that the
world glories in, to keep that great body politic of humane wisdom unburied
in the Churches, which it that which gives form and being to all their
temporary Institutions and Ordinances, which is as void of life proper to the
wisdom and spirit of God, as a dead body is when the soul is departed.

And therefore cannot move nor breath out the reality of the being of that
estate both of the just and unjust, to be as truly without beginning as without
end; for the world does not eternize the Son of God by that common of trinity
in unity, and unity in trinity in the divine essence, for he is not Christ that
anointed son of God, but as he is considered in both natures; nor is the
eternal wisdom, or work of God (beseeming himself, who is infinite and
eternal) extant, but in that workmanship of Christ; for it is true, that as the
seed of man propagates not his kind, but as considered in male and female, even
so the immortal seed of God produces not his offspring, but as considered in
God and man in Christ, therefore they have killed the faithful and true
witness, the head and top of the creation of God, by not giving him the
reality of being from eternity; therefore he is said to be one that was dead
and is alive; or as the word is, he is dead in the present tence, as in the
wicked, and (is) alive, that is, in the Saints; for the word translated (was)
is the same where the Apostle faith, I (am) an Apostle in the present tence.

And here let us adventure to insert a word of the nature of the unity between
God and man, which eternizeth the estate both of just and unjust, seeing there
is in both man's nature which is temporary made and brought forth in time, being
a real and proper creature,

For the unity that is in Christ which is a being joined unto the Lord and
becoming one spirit, or one mystical and spiritual estate and condition
together with himself.

Consider with me, that there is in the eternal an aptness to do, or to be,
and a proper principle or fountain from which he does, or is such a thing.

For doing, and being the thing done, are conjunctive, never separated, but
where the one is, there is the other; to do the law of God, is to be the law of
God, and so the Saints are a law unto themselves, as well as the profane
Gentiles, the one not having or doing the law of the flesh, no more then the
other has or is the law of the spirit.

God therefore is apt, and prompt to know, to be wise, prudent, to debate,
determine, and conclude, to love, to pity, to have compassion, to be at peace,
to be kind, joyous, and salvation; but he does, or is these from that
principle or fountain of goodness and bounty wherein he communicates himself
unto another in the being and exercise of them all, wherein is such infinite
fullness; that that which is proper unto the principles and practice of a
creature, is superfluous in every one of them.

So that in whatsoever a christian is united unto, or comunicates with God in,
it is properly and originally of God and not of the creature, as his Sonship is
of God, and not of the proper offspring of man, being begotten not of mortal,
but of immortal seed, so are all the lineaments of God and man in Christ, if
wisdom join; the Tabernacle that God builds, and not man, it is the wisdom
of God; if love make the contract, it is the love of God shed abroad in the
heart, and not the love of man which is enmity with God; if faith establish the
heart that it wavour not, it is the faith of God, which is the power of God to
salvation, wherein consists the great work of God which is in beleiving; as
Christ tells him that asked, what shall I do to work the work of God? believe
(says he) for therein it consists; for it was by the work of faith that
Abraham was justified, and not by that vain or empty faith without works; that
is, without the present power and operation of God, for such faith the Devil
may attain unto, who beleives there is one God, and trembles, but does not
consist in his power as made one of twain in Christ.

So that whatsoever is in this unity, is properly and originally of God, and
that from a principle or law of his bounty and goodness whereby he
communicates himself unto another in all things, which that law or goodness
of his nature is apt and prompt to be, and to do, whereby he forms himself in
his Son, without whom, or out of whom, he never had being, took form in any
will or law, nor put forth himself in any operation, therefore it is said
(speaking of Christ, God and man) all things were made by him, and without him
was nothing made.

For if ever God had had being, or motion, so much as of mind, and will out of
man, it had ever been so, and then salvation had not been, the Savior had
never appeared; for salvation cannot be complete, but in him that saves, and is
also saved; and the Almighty never was, but as he is a God of salvation, yea in
the plurality thereof as the expression of the Psalmist is, the beginning of
Christ therefore cannot be fathomed, nor spanned out no more then the beginning
of the Almighty and eternal can, though there be that in Christ which is in
time, yet he takes not his proper being from that, no more then man, takes his
proper being from his body, but from his rational soul and spirit, which
inliveneth, acts, and moves the same.

And in the one and the other does the glory of the Son of God exist; for God
working in and by the faculties, or aptitudes to do in the soul, or spirit of
the creature, thereby his virtues and operations come to be distinct, and so
full of variety of glory, being the spirit and life of the creature, consists
in change of motion, or operation, also here the works of God have their proper
times, seasons, and opportunities, which in the proper and simple eternal could
never be.

Furthermore, as man works not by the principles and properties of the
creature, but by those that are proper to God, denying himself, being resigned
over unto God, and so all his operations become of an eternal race and virtue,
and are in the true and real account and reckoning of eternity, of such nature
is the condition of the Son of God, therefore the Prophet says, who can
declare his age; he is the first and the last, if he never end in being last,
he never had beginning as he is the first, but is from eternity to eternity,
though that be in him which is temporary in it self, even as man's body lives
and understands, though of it self it has, nor does either, as appears when
the soul is departed.

Secondly, concerning the unity of Harlots, for he that is joined unto an
harlot is one flesh; that is, one carnal and corrupt estate, in which all the
ligaments thereof are such as properly the creature is the original and
fountain of, and not the Creator; how then can this unity be eternal, when
the proper bond is of that which is mortal and temporary.

To this we answer, that there are certain faculties or aptitudes to do, or to
be in the soul of a man; as also a law or principle by which it is, or does
such things, and for the aptitudes to do or to be: We may safely say, that
whatsoever the Almighty is prompt unto; that through the sublimity and
excellency that God has made the spirit of a man to be of, he is prompt unto
the variety of operations and excellencies that are in the Son of God, yea even
to compass the earth, and comprehend all things, and find out the causes,
relations, and operations of them; yea, even to eternize himself on the earth,
by calling his lands by his name, by living in his posterity; by some great
work wrought, or monument set up to memorize him unto posterity and ages to
come; yea doubtless some Statesmen and Politicians of the world are apt to
lay plots and platforms how to bring about, accomplish, and achieve things,
which they know can never be done in their days, that their wisdom and policy
may live and be in use when they are gone: and of such use, and from such
aptitudes come humane Chronicles, writing of books, or the like, to reach to
eternity, which God only wise is. So that man works in, and by the aptitudes of
God, but not from that law and principle proper to the Son of God.

For whereas God out of that law of bounty and goodness of his nature
communicates himself in whatsoever he is apt to do, and be, whereby he does
it, and is it in the creature.

The creature exercising it self in the way of man's wisdom in things which
God himself is prompt to be and to do, not by giving himself up unto God to
be his, and not his own, but by that principle of self-love, and law of
exalting the arm of flesh, he arrogates unto himself, and monopolizeth the
things proper to God unto himself, ascribing them unto the things of man to
beautify and to set up the things of the creature thereby, attributing and
giving unto the flesh that which is proper only unto the Son of God, which is a
turning of the truth of God into a lie; a changing the glory of God into the
image of a corruptible man; and a worshipping and serving of the creature
instead of the Creator, who is blessed for ever, Amen.

We conclude then, that as God by that law of grace exercises himself in all
his excellencies in the aptitudes of man's soul, filling them with himself so,
as the things of eternity come to be distinct, to have their proper season,
time, place, yea and person, so as the Saints are truly distinct, and the
operation of their faith, as the Apostle amply declares in that to the Hebrews,
Chap. 11.

So also that man of sin, through that carnal law exercises himself in the
aptitudes of God, filling them with the things of the creature, so as they
become unmeasurable, not bounded by any time or season, but take in the vast
space of eternity, and so the state of the wicked is also evelasting in that
son of perdition, as well as in that Son of God, and yet that which is born of
the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the spirit is spirit; but both
perpetuated, of like race, in respect of time in the sight of God, and all that
judge and discern according to the spirit of God; for as it is affirmed of that
eternal word, that it was in the beginning. In the beginning was the word, and
the word was with God, and the word was God.

So it is affirmed of the wicked one, that he is a manslayer from the
beginning, and not to abide in the truth, but is a liar, and the father of it.
There is therefore a change, and a real change in Satan, for the truth of God
is turned into a lie in him, but it is in the number and act of his being: so
that it is as true and real, that he was never otherwise, and therefore he is
said also to be the fountain and father of it, as he that is so originally,
even as Abraham that high Father, and ancient of days, is said to be the
father of the faithful, as the original and propagator of them all.

And without this unity of the harlot, prostrating and adulterating the word of
God unto the lusts of men, Satan is not known, but works in and by, and is
conversant with man, and man knows it not.

It is true also, that there is a change, and a real change in Christ the son
of the blessed, for man's nature is changed from its visiosity and vanity proper
to the wisdom of a creaeure, to become the undefiled of God in the blessing
and reality of sonship: but this change is from the manner, instant, and
eternal act of his being: so that it is as true that he was never other but
that undefiled and real son of God blessed for ever, with respect to time
past, and that which is to come.

So that the Son of God is never alive in the spirit, but Satan is dead in and
to him; nor is Satan alive in the flesh; but Christ is dead in, and to him, and
by his slaughter the world nourishes its heart, and feasts it self; so that
the mortification of the spirit of the Scripture, or word of life, is the
revivall of the letter, which becomes the proper nourishment of the carnal
mind, which is that state of death, for to be carnally minded is death.

So also it is true in Christ, that the mortification of the flesh in the
abrogating of that carnal law of sin and death, is the slaying of that
Leviathan Sea-Dragon, or man of Sin, who is given to be meat for Gods people
in the wilderness; that is, it is the revivall of the spirit which becomes the
proper nourishment of the sons of God, and is that bread from heaven that
perishes not, and food of eternal life which abides for ever: And as food
becomes one with that body that feeds upon it, in the nourishing of it, so does
the spirit and life of the living and eternal God, become one state and
condition in that man of God, and mystical body of Christ Jesus our alone
Lordship and salvation.

And so also does that spirit of death and destruction, in that the truth of
God is turned into a lie, become one state and condition in that man of sin,
that vile body and mystery of iniquity, wherein that eternal death only
consists, and remains for ever. In the next verse he declares who it is
they have killed, and the manner of it.

Verse. 6. Ye have condemned and have killed the just, and he does not resist
you.
Wherein observe,
1. The act of the wicked, Ye have condemned, and have killed the just. 2. The
demeanor of the Just, He does not resist them.
Their act is twofold.
1. They condemn him. 2. They kill him.
1. BY the just here (as has been declared) is meant, the Lord our
righteousness, or our justice, as the Prophet calls him, Whose path is as the
shining light which shines more and more unto the perfect day; that is, has
all manner and motions of glory in it, as from the rising of the Sun unto the
height thereof, it is he only in whom perfect justice resides, which consists
in a Justifier, and a justified, which is only found in Christ, out of whom no
perfect justice is found; for if the Justifier be one, and the justified
another individual, or substance, there is a fraction in the act, it admits of
default and imperfection, you cannot find it whole in either of them: Christ
therefore is only just; and hence it is, that seats of Judicature must either
condemn him in the world, or else they cannot justify themselves to have the
perfection of the Law, so they are said here to condemn the just, or that just
one.

To condemn implies the giving of sentence, as by law, for there must be a
discerning which is by a rule, or else sentence cannot pass; and every thing
has its proper and peculiar law, whereby it seeks to effect, the conservation
and safety of of it self in its proper condition: and where the wisdom of the
flesh and carnal mind gives the proper being unto the condition, it has a
certain law, bond, or engagement upon it, in way of argumentall and legal
reasoning for the safety and conservation of it self in its own principles and
achievements, and to condemn and sentence whatsoever makes for the bane and
overthrow of them, and unto that stands bound and engaged in it self, as to
its ruler or god.

Now the Cross of Christ in the crucification of the flesh, and order of that
law of the spirit, does confound humane wisdom in the way of its being, and
all its enterprises, making it the proper folly of the world, for it is
written; I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will cast away the
understanding of the prudent: Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is
the disputer of this world? has not God made the wisdom of this world
foolishness? Therefore the wisdom of the flesh or carnal law, does bind over,
under penalty of destruction of it self, to convent, arraign, convict,
condemn, and pass a final sentence upon the Son of God, that law of the
spirit of life, otherwise it cannot reteyn and conserve it self: So that we
may as soon (and with better acceptance) persuade a rational and ingenuous
spirit, to lie down and utterly forsake the nature and activity of his
wisdom, and to become a beast of the dullest capacity, as to persuade a
carnal mind where the son of peace is not, upon the true and proper conditions
of the Gospel, to become a son of God.

It is no marvel therefore though the world love their own, and hate such as
are taught of God, condemning such as justify the words of wisdom, which only
sets forth the folly of the world, or else it appears not: And they only love
the works of darkness, and dare not come to the light, least their deeds
should be discovered.

2. They do not only condemn, but they kill the Just one, and that in a
twofold respect.

First, consider, that a thing is said to be killed, when it is expelled the
proper place of its abode, so it is slain in way of negation and denying it its
right and due: Deny a fish the water, and it is killed; take a plant out of the
earth, and it withers; take water out of the Sea, and it moves not in ebbing
and flowing; and deny any thing the benefit of the air, and it cannot live, no
not the water, nor the fire it self.

Now mankind is the proper place of Gods residency and abode in the exercise
and manifestation of his wisdom; delighting himself in the habitable parts of
his earth, even in the sons of men.

But where the wisdom of the flesh bears sway, and makes its abode, there the
wisdom of God is denied any place of residency; therefore Christ who is the
wisdom of God, and the power of God, lives not there in any of his operations
and virtues; for as Jacob said of Joseph, he is not; that is, he is not living
in that heart.

2. He is killed actually, by laying violent hands, or administrations upon
him, to the quenching of his spirit, whereby he becomes life-lesse in the
world, haling him to the places of execution, for Christ never appeared, or was
known in the world, but by virtue of an office, and institution.

For how can a King appear, but by virtue of his inauguration; or a Prophet,
but by or in the spirit of a Prophet: Or what is a Priest, if he have not
somewhat to offer? for he cannot be a Priest without. Christ appears not, but
by virtue of institution and commission to execute, perform, and do the will of
the Father; therefore he says, I come not to do my own will, but the will of
him that sent me.

Now to institute temporary Ordinances, and offices vanishing and fading, not
holding correspondency with the nature and constitution of Christ, it is to
destroy and thrust out the proper spirit and authority of Christ, as it not
having a being in the world.

For to frame an Office or Ordinance of Christ, and not to have the spirit of
Christ, is to destroy and abolish unto themselves that mystical body of
Christ, even as a natural body deprived of the soul that gives it life, is
thereby abolished and turned to putrefaction.

Let us consider then how to form Ordinances, and establish offices and
Officers of Christ; for if they have not in them the spirit of Christ, they
will prove no better then those legal and Jewish services taken up from Moses,
as representing the letter of the Scripture, and accordingly practiced in the
days of Christ, by Herod, Pontius Pilate, Scribes, Pharisees, Lawyers, and
Soldiers, and the whole body of the people, who cried out, crucify him,
crucify him, away with him.

When water in the River or Pond has the spirit of life from God in it, then
we shall count it as an Ordinance of Christ; when bread and wine on the Table
have the spirit of mortification of the flesh, and quickening power of the
resurrection of Christ in them, then will they prove spiritual Ordinances of
Christ, beseeming the son of the living God.

For there is no office, exercise, or ordinance proper to the kingdom of God,
that is void and destitute of the holy spirit of the Son of God, who is that
great ordinance of God in whom every particular is wrapped up and infolded, and
not one of them barren, or destitute of the same spirit of life from God;
otherwise all Ordinances and offices taken up from Christ and his Apostles, are
of the same nature of those taken up from Moses in Christ's days, and shall
prove of the same effect when ever Christ appears, for the one stands upon the
proper letter of the Scripture as well as the other; and Satan can alledg the
Scripture to back his temptation, as well as Christ does, for the confounding
of him. Now if the spirit and life of such Ordinances depend upon the Priests
and Elders, the Instituters and Conservators of them; why should they then
contend with those which they call Papists, but join hand in hand as being one
with them.

Let us remember therefore, that If we bereave the body of the proper soul and
spirit of Christ, we abolish and destroy the Just one, and turn him to
corruption unto our selves.

3. The next point is the demeanor of the just: And he resists you not; that
is, he does not stay or hinder your project and violence from execution, he
does not detain nor keep back himself from you, but patiently suffers himself
to be dispoiled of all his virtues and excellencies in you, which are the
native and proper operations of the Son of God, ceasing from his own work in
you, that you may take your full swinge in that which is proper and natural
unto you, as to exercise your pride and policy; your principalities and powers
of darkness, your spiritual wickednesses in high places, according to the
Prince of the power of the air. That wheresoever any heart is empty and
destitute of she spirit of God, he insinuates himself to be the fullness of
it; that according to that plenty of wickedness, the wrath of God may find
fuel to kindle it self upon, and so he freely without resistance lays down
his life in the wicked as a ransom, that he may take it again in his Saints,
and in them live for ever: And so much for the death of Christ according to the
spirit in the men of the world, who crucify afresh unto themselves the son
of God, and make a mock of him.

And from this our Apostle infers an exhortation consisting of diverse
particulars, which do concern the death of Christ according to the flesh, as he
is considered in the Saints: and that is the second general head in the
Chapter, which is contained to the 12. verse.

And with respect unto death in both these respects, the Apostle Paul says,
God forbid that I should rejoice in any thing, save in the cross of our Lord
Jesus Christ, whereby the world is crucified in me, and I am crucified in the
world.

Verse. 7. Be patient therefore brethren unto the coming of the Lord: behold,
the husbandman waits for the precifruit of the earth, and has long patience
for it until he receive the early and latter rain.
Wherein observe,
1. The term or kind appellation, Brethren. 2. An exhortation, in these
words, Be patient. 3. How long, or to what end; To the coming of Christ. 4. An
allusion to a husbandman, with respect to his seed-time, and harvest.
1. ANd first, for the term given unto them, Brethren, which is with respect
unto that brotherhood which is in Christ, who is not ashamed to call us
brethren, whereby he declares their disjunction and separation from the men
formerly spoken of, as not being naturalized, or having any part or portion in
that manner of death formerly expressed, nor any alliance thereunto.

2. Whence he infers the exhortation, Be patient therefore; that is, as the Son
of God suffers himself to be deprived and laid wast of all spiritual glory,
virtue, and operations of his spirit in the world, to rescue you and deliver
you therefrom, even so do you suffer your selves without any resistance, to be
routed and dispoiled of all humane, transitory, and fading excellencies of the
world; that as he fully suffers in the wicked in point of the spirit, as
being laid waste of all the things thereof, for there is a fulfilling or
fullness of the Scripture in Judas and the Jews in putting Christ to death, in
regard of the letter of it.

So do you patiently endure to be dispoyled and laid waste of all that carnal
and temporal glory of the world, in whatsoever it may seem to consist; for
there is a fulfilling or fullness of the Scripture in the man of God also, even
in that Emanuel, God with us, or in us, in regard of the true spirit and life
of the word of God, therefore the flesh must be abolished, that so the fullness
of the spirit may appear, which otherwise it cannot do.

The word translated patience, is the same, where the Apostle John says, I
John even your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and
patience of Jesus Christ, or in the Kingdom and under-abiding of Jesus Christ,
as the word is truly rendered; that is, a suffering of the loss of all things
carnal and transitory, through that Princely power of the spirit that reigns
in the kingdom of God, that so Christ his suffering in the flesh may be as
full and complete as that in the spirit, that so the form of the Cherubims on
each end of the Mercy-seate may answer one to another, from between which the
Oracle of. God ever utteteth it self, and elsewhere expresses not it self
in the Sanctuary; and hence is Christ said to come, or spring up in this place,
and that is the third point unto what this suffering tends, and whereunto it
serves, and that is, to the coming of the Lord.

3. The word translated coming, signifies to spring, grow up, or ascend,
teaching us hereby, that this is the way of the resurrection of Christ, and his
ascension into all spiritual and heavenly glory; for he gives himself unto
death, in respect of any life of the spirit, being, or existing in the world,
or any glory of his presence in point of his divine grace, ever to appear
there, that is, in the wicked: and this is as a complete and unvaluable
ransom, whereby he purchases unto himself miserable and frail flesh in that
way of his Saints, to be possessed for ever in the power of his spirit in all
the fruits of righteousness, being clothed thereupon with the glory of the
sons of God, and heyrs of his Kingdom; this patience therefore is to the coming
of the Lord into unity and brotherhood with frail man.

The argument then stands thus: If Christ suffer death in the spirit in the men
of the world, freely giving up himself thereunto without resistance to an
eternal separation of his spirit, and glory of his power, from that which he
himself is (namely man.)

Do you in like manner suffer your selves to be deprived of all the excellency
and glory of this world, and freely lay down your life in respect of any living
thereunto, without resistance; for it is not unto separation or departure, but
to the springing up and coming of the Lord, that you may ascend into that which
he is in himself, namely into the state and condition of an only son.

Let the world take notice, that if the Son of God give it its full scope
without resistance, to set up and exalt it self in riches, power, policy, and
all wantonness and lasciviousness, what a shame is it to the world to deny
him liberty and freedom in his Saints, to exercise himself in all his
virtues, offices, and operations of his spirit in his house and kingdom, but
they must be judging him to be factious, seditious, pernicious, erroneous, and
blasphemous, and that by such as are most properly sealed up unto carnal and
humane principles in Schools of humane learning, so as they dare not give an
Exposition upon the word of God, but so as it may be consonant to the rules of
humane Art, unless they receive it at second hand by some approved Author,
that passes for current in the state where they live. While the world walks,
and works in this sphere, we shall see nothing among the sons of the mighty,
but merely Babels confusion. For the most curious Artist destitute of the
spirit of God, exercising in the word of God, brings forth the greatest
confusion; for he is bound to preserve and maintayn the flesh, which in all
points lusts against the spirit, and is contrary thereunto: So that it is the
division of language, for his tongue is divided from God in all expressions, if
he be understood according to his true intent.

4. The amplification follows by an elegant allusion to a Husbandman, with
respect to his seed-time and harvest.

We all know of what nature the patient waiting of a husbandman is, with
respect to his seed-time and harvest: Let us therefore take out the meaning of
the allusion, wherein is contained a mystery employed in this word Behold,
noting unto us the appearance of a sign or wonder, as was formerly said of the
same phrase.

Now the Husbandman is the Son of God, who sowes good seed in his field: But
the enemy in this his sleep of death, unto the spirit in the men of the world
(or man of sin) sowes tares, for it is the word of God that is sown in the
world; but being received and formed by the would, composed of the principle
and dictates of humane wisdom, which has in it the very characters of the
letter of the Scriptures, which is the complete form of the law of sin and
death (even as the wisdom of the spirit has in is the complete form of the
law of the spirit of life) and being received and formed in that mould, it
becomes a pernicious and unfruitful tare.

In like manner, as the spirit of the creature being cast into that mould of
wholesome Doctrine, does through that wisdom of God (become in it) the true seed
of immortality, to increase with the increasings of God.

In the allusion or metaphor, we have to consider,
1. A wonder noted in the word, Behold. 2. A patient waiting or abiding; The
husbandman waits. 3. For what? that is, for the precious fruits of the
earth. 4. The time is, with long patience. 5. The means of receiving them, and
that is, The former and latter rain.
FIrst, for the word Behold, implying a wonder, note thus much in the
distinction of it from the former expression, for the word of God in every
phrase has its peculiar and distinct luster. In the former, Christ is brought
in as an hireling in his death in the spirit here, as the Husbandman, or Lord
of the harvest, in his dying unto the flesh.

Whence we observe;

That it is a like wonder and miraculous act and deed, for the son of God to
be made an hireling in the world, or kingdom of men, as it is for the son of
man (Enoch, sorry and base man, made of the earth) to be made Lord of the
harvest, ruler of heaven and earth. Let this be the only use of it, to carry
news to all men, that he that knows not the mystery of the one, cannot unfold
the Chidah, that hidden matter or riddle of the other; for the spirit of Joseph
can interpret the dream of Pharaoh's Baker, as well as that of his Butlers.

2. The husbandman waits; The word implies a waiting, as an over-seer, to give
things their due, and to keep from harm; he tarries and abides by his field to
see that nothing be wanting, nor that any tare be plucked up to the hurt or
disadvantage of the corn, but will have them grow together till harvest.

Whence we observe,

That there can be no true and acceptable division made betwixt wheat and
tares, just and unjust, but by the perfect growth and ripeness of them both;
the man of God must be brought forth unto perfection, so also must the man of
sin. Yea, the seed of God sown in that great field of the world, not in one
age, but in all ages thereof; as also the seed of the Serpent, or tares sown by
that evil one, must be opened unto the full measure of sin, and righteousness
in the one, and in the other, or else no man can rightly divide between the
precious and the vile. He cannot pluck up a tare otherwise, but he hurts the
wheat; for no man can scant a wicked man of the fullness of sin, but he
besmears the Just one, that holy one of God, with what he keeps back from the
wicked; for if it be not brought unto the wicked, as to its proper seat in its
perfection, it is left unto the Son of God, as he yet abiding under it. This
Lord of the Harvest therefore waits as a careful and diligent over-seer, that
no such great inconvenience and evil befall his field, or hinder the right and
joyful in gathering of his harvest.

They therefore that go about to gather in the wheat, or bind up the tares,
before they be waiters and overseers unto fullness and perfection of both,
that they can truly say, the harvest is come, which is the end of the world
(namely of all worldly excellencies of the Saints) these are those unskilful
servants which know not the mind of the Lord, nor is their enterprise
acceptable unto him.

3. He waits for the precious fruits of the earth, and tarries and abides to
preserve all things in order and place, to the appearing of them, which are the
abundant and fruitful exercises of mercy and justice, which spring up in the
just and unjust.

These are they which the Psalmist speaks of, when he says; Mercy and truth
are met together, justice and peace have kissed each other. For these are both
alike innocent and guiltless, precious, and of like difficulty to be found
out, as they are gathered together, and exercised by the wisdom and power of
God, who thrusts in the sickle of his wrath and displeasure, as well as of his
love and good will, when the regions are white unto the harvest in the one
respect and in the other.

For it is alike precious thing in God to redeem and deliver the elect by man;
and yet to free man in point of his own proper nature and ability from being
any cause or furtherance in the work thereof, as it is to condemn and destroy
the wicked by the Son of God, and yet to free God in point of his own native
properties and operations from being any furtherance of the work thereof, and
without both the one and the other of these brought to light, the words of
wisdom are not justified.

In the one, he that glories (or as the word is) praises himself, it must be
in the Lord, for the boasting of all flesh is excluded.

In the other, he that is shamefully dishonored and blasphemed, it is only in
man, for the Son of God is most glorious and excellent for ever, and most
precious fruits of justice and mercy arises from each of them.

In the one, the Lord alone is our salvation and our strength; and in the
other, Oh Israel, thy destruction is of thy self.

The fourth point is, the time of waiting, and that is with long patience.
The length of this patience is answerable to the long suffering of God in the
days of Noah, who suffered himself to be mortified, in respect of all
spiritual and holy things in Cain, even as Abel was by him slain, and put to
death; for in Cain the life of righteousness never appeared, for he was
destroyed in his seed in the deluge, in that respect never to live; only none
is to put him to death, nor diminish him in his living unto the flesh, in which
respect he lives to this day, in those that wander in the way of Cain, as the
Apostle teaches, and so Abels blood speaks wrath in him until now.

And Abel is never to live after the flesh, nor bring forth an offspring in
that way, and yet speaks in that voice of faith and life of Christ in Seth,
that set one in his stead, of whom Christ came as an offering acceptable, and
of sweet smelling savor before God for ever.

This patience then has the length of eternity in it; for he that cannot
expect the reception, and rising up of these fruits at an eternal distance, as
fresh and new in exercise and execution, as though they had never taken being
before, both in mercy to the godly, and in terror to the wicked; he can never
perceive, nor rightfully enjoy the present being of the one nor the other.

For if we look upon them according to the dimentions which God gives unto
them, then are they to come unto eternity, both the destruction of the wicked
in our ransom, as the salvation of the just in their purchased possession, and
they are both of them really present in that act of expectation, even as the
Son of God is one that is, and is to come: So that in patient waiting, we
possess, and in present possession we patiently wait, else things are not
looked upon, as having God in unity, but only as Creature in relation to
Creature: but the Apostle testifies, that Abraham in waiting for the Promise,
had the present enjoyment of it, and that as the father of all the faithful,
who only inherit accordingly, and in no other way, and thence he brings in the
next point

Which is the fifth in order, and that is the means of receiving of them, and
that is the early and the latter rain.
This early and late rain, the Prophet Hosea calls it the first rain in the
second, implying that the reality of them both is in one act, as the Son of God
is said to be the first and the last, and yet but one Christ.

Now we know, that in point of husbandry the first rain gives properly the
seed to put forth root downward; and the second, or letter rain causes to put
forth into blade, ear, and full or ripe corn in the ear: Therefore the
Prophet Isaiah says, that the escaped of the house of Judah shall take root
down-ward, and bring forth fruit upward.

Now the rooting which the Saints give both unto just and unjust is from
eternity, otherwise we give them not the proper means of their growth; for the
Psalmist affirms that the birthdew of Christ is from the womb of the early
morning; and the ground hereof is (as has been said) because the eternal is
in the united, and therefore he is said to be a dew unto Israel, that he may
cast forth his roots and branches, and grow as a lilly: and as the root goes
down into eternity in point of time past, else no proper means of growth, so
the branch in the height of it, and full corn in the ear, to the ripeness of
it, is unto eternity for time to come, else has it not the perfection of its
growth.

And it is an act of like nature in faith, and of like necessity to salvation,
to give it self a being from eternity, as to give it self a being to
eternity; and he that misseth in the one, and sins in the other for his
eternity to come, is but from tradition. For without the fetching up of
himself from the one, and stretching out himself unto the other, he has not
the proper and essential being of a Christian, therefore Christ is described
in whomsoever he appears, to be he which was, and which is, and which is to
come.

Note here, that the mistake of this point is the ground of all that deceitful
doctrine at this day so acceptable in the world, namely that such excellent
times, and also miserable days and places have been, which are not now to be
found in the world, as Israel, considered both in Canaan, and in Egypt also;
and such excellent times are to come, as were never yet attained unto, as in
that new Jerusalem, calling of the Jews, or Christ coming to reign a certain
space on the earth, as the sole Monarch of the world, taking the letter of the
word in which death consists, to be their proper guide and directory, whereas
the proper scope and intent is, by an historical narration of things which
have been, to fetch up things of an eternal nature, to give them a present and
real being both in just and unjust, from a time so early, as none can ever
descend beneath, to present it otherwise: And also when the Scriptures speak
in way of Prophetical prediction of things that are to come, men take occasion
thereby to carry us up in a phanaticall conceit; to look after that which
never yet was, whereas the scope is to fetch down things that reach unto
eternity to give us the present enjoyment of them, which never any can get
beyond, or climb higher; this deceitful spirit of, was, or will be, but is
not in present existence, could never endure the present appearance of Christ.

But if he be truly made manifest, it is a torment unto them, and they say in
heart, he comes to torment them before their time. But to conclude this point,
we affirm that present precious fruit, together with patient waiting for, is
the proper inheritance of the promise, containing both sowing and in gathering
in the kingdom of God; and to separate them, is to divide Christ, who is ever
in unity, and never without the said respects, whereupon he brings in the next
words as an inference.

Verse. 8. Be ye also patient, stablish your hearts, for the coming of the Lord
draws nigh.
In which words observe,
1. The renewing of the exhortation; Be ye also patient. 2. An enlargement
thereof, drawn from the former metaphor or amplification, in these words,
Stablish your hearts. 3. The ground or reason of it; For the coming of the Lord
draws nigh.
BE ye also patient; that is, do every one of you state himself in ^he
condition of the Husbandman, and personate the Husbandman in himself, that so
in patient waiting for, you may enjoy the harvest of the promise in the
precious and rare things of God in Christ, and in the present enjoyment of
them, you may expect the coming of them in like glory, power, and virtue for
ever.

The earth brings forth sufficient for its inhabitants in one year, but it has
not spent its virtue, but has a new glory and store brought forth the next
also, continuing its virtue and ability therein from the beginning; and shall
we think that ever the Son of God shall be so comprehended and grasped up
together in his glory and virtue, that he has it not to bring forth a fresh,
both in mercy and justice, as though it had never before appeared; not so, for
in his presence is society, and fullness of joy; that is, perfection thereof at
present; and at his right hand are pleasures for evermore; that is, a
delightful and pleasant renewing of them for ever.

Note here, that those persons, that preach a defect and imperfection in
Christianity, they ever hold a time to come when there shall never be more
attained, though not at death, yet at the day of their carnallized judgment,
which is all one, as to hold that the Son of God may be exhausted and drawn
dry in respect of his virtues, as though he were not that living fountain that
runs afresh for ever, or as though the eternal were wrapped up in the bounds of
time, and that infinite were now become fioite, this is the glory and top of
such men's religion, that teach or hold an imperfection in the state of
Christianity; and it is only tradition that keeps them from preaching it in
Christ also, for otherwise they know not his perfection.

2. He ads further in the exhortation grounded upon the former doctrine,
Stablish your hearts; that is, settle, fix, and confirm your spirits upon this
foundation, or twofold pillar in the Son of God, namely the reality of his
immediate presence, completely and perfectly, and that he is no less
completely to come; therefore it is, that he comes in preaching peace to them
that are afarr off, and to them that are nigh, alluding to the history of the
Jews and Gentiles, but the body and truth is in Christ, for it is no parradox
to faith, to say Christ is the nearest, and also the farthest of; for faith is
the subsistence of things hoped for; that is, it is the present being of things
that yet are not, for hope which is seen is no hope.

And it is the evidence of things not seen; that is, it is a plain
demonstration of that which yet appears not; for he never appears but he has a
new manifestation of himself yet to come, otherwise the Son of God would
wax old; and that which waxes old, is ready to vanish and pass away: but he
abides for ever, without decay, like that old commandment that is from the
beginning, and that new commandment that is still to come, and spring up
afresh in all that are intrest therein.

Again, we are to be established in this in like manner, that there is the
presens being of wrath in the wicked, and likewise to come, as though it had
never yet been; for he that believes not, wrath abides upon him already; yea
and it is the wrath to come also, and therefore there is a fearful expectation
of wrath in the wicked, for there is a hoarding up of wrath, as having stored
up the perfection of it, and it is against a day of wrath and revelation of the
just judgment of God, which is likewise to come.

In these things we are to have our hearts confirmed, and to stand fast, as
that Angel that stands with one foot on the sea, and the oupon the land,
lifting up his hand to heaven, and swears by him that created all things, that
time shall be no more; and that with that courage and boldness, as in a lion
that roareth; for howsoever all things that God has made may be said to be
subject unto the circuit of time, yet is there no time of that man of sin,
that time of turbulent trouble of the sea, found in the man of God, in that
quiet rest in the land of Emanuel, Jesus Christ, the oath of confirmation has
passed that puts an end to all controversy; no time of Satan in the Son of
God: neither is there any time, or age of man found in that Antichrist and son
of perdition; an oath is past, to put it out of doubt, that in the one respect
and the other, time shall be no more; and he that is an Angel, or messenger
from heaven, can boldly and confidently proclaim the same.

Therefore when the seven thunders utter their voice, and John is about to
write, hearing them distinctly, yet is forbidden, for the same voice has a
prohibition in it, and commands also to seal them up as a secret.

For the mystery of iniquity is to be sealed up, as a sevenfold fullness and
perfection thereof in that man of sin, and state of the wicked, so that no
letter, nor character thereof, be once mentioned as recorded in that state and
condition of Christianity, that is by Jesus Christ.

So also that sevenfold mystery of God in as plain and apparent voice unto the
gracious Saint, is to be sealed up in that state and condition of the Son of
God, so as not one letter, or fillable thereof, no not a jot or tittle, be
mentioned, as recorded in the state of the man of sin, those Rolls of Babylon,
Statutes of Omry, and Chronologies of all wicked Ahabs and Jesabels whatsoever,
for the voice of the sevenfold perfection of the mystery of God, is silent and
speaks not in any of them all.

Note here hence, that such as write bitter things in the Saints of God, as
sin, and uncleanness, not yet purged and taken away, as also good things in
wicked men, as remenders of that good Image of God wherein man was created,
they know neither the prohibition, nor yet the command given unto that great
Angel that comes down from heaven; nor have they the oath of God upon them,
for the confirmation of time, to put it out of controversy in the souls of
men, how it is no more.

The ground of the settling of the heart through patience follows,

Because the coming of the Lord draws nigh.
By Lord here, is meant the Lord Jesus, and by coming is meant his grouth or
springing up in his perfection: The word draw, signifies the continuation and
extention of a thing to the uttermost, as in the Psalms, draw out thy loving
kindness to them that know thee, or extend and continue thy loving kindness
to them that know or acknowledge thee, to be what indeed thou art.

And again, will thou draw out or extend thy wrath unto all generations, or
will thou draw out thy wrath to generation and generation; as if he should say,
is not thy wrath extended unto that generation of the wicked one, that seed of
the serpent, in the fullness and perfection thereof, and therefore the
generation of the just are cleared and acquit from the same for ever, so that
it cannot be drawn out to generation and generation, in case that one possess
the fullness of it.

The word nigh, signifies unity, and that in the nearest bond of affinity,
therefore it is said, thou shall not come nigh thy kin; that is, to enter
into contract and copulation with them, which is of such nearness as two to
become one flesh, where there is a leaving of father and mother, to become one
in that mutual bond as not knowing or owning any other.

The argument then stand thus; that if the Son of God, who is before all time,
yea from eternity, and is that Lamb slain from the beginning, has
(notwithstanding) extended and drawn out himself to be kindred unto you, and
become one with you in the nearest affiance and unity that can be, raising up
himself in you as Lord and King, yea as Prince of peace, being your present
exaltation, lordship, and authory in your immediate condition, if no time has
intervened, no state swallowed him up, no Saint so engrossed him to himself
alone, no persecution prevented, nor Princes of this world crucified the Lord
of glory so; but that he has drawn out himself from eternity in respect of
time past, to become one with you in the nearest bond, as to be but one
condition together with you; one faith, one love, one wisdom, one joy, one
strrength, and authority, one rule and lordship, yea one exaltation, ascension,
and preferment; be ye then patient, and settle your hearts, wait and expect
without wavouring, that from this unity and present being of the happy and
blessed estate you stand in, he will extend and draw out himself in you,
without any obstruction, or interruption unto eternal aye, raising up himself
afresh in you, as lord and king without all interruption, intermission, decay
or control, but in all the variety of his glory shall ever appear like
himself the Son of eternity, and of the blessed God.

Whereupon he amplifies his exhortation, backing it with arguments in the next
verse.

Verse. 9. Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned:
behold, the Judge stands before the door.
Wherein we note,
1. The term he gives them; that is, brethern. 2. A duty, or dehortation,
Grudge not one against another; which he backs with a two fold argument.
1. From the danger, Least ye be condemned. 2. Readiness for execution, and
that in way of wonder, behold the Judge stands before the door.

THe word brother in this place, comprehends not only the brotherhood of the
Saints of God as in the next verse where he adds, my brethren; but also a
certain relation in brotherhood which is between the saints and men of the
world, set forth unto us in that between Jacob and Esau, which the Scripture so
often expresses, and alludeth unto, Was not Esau Jacobs brother, says the
Lord, yet I have loved Jacob, and hated Esau, and have laid his mountain wast,
and his heritage for the Dragons of the wilderness.

For Christ arises and is brought forth, out of as near a kinn with the men of
the world, as Jacob was unto Esau his brother, who had both one father, even
Isaac, and one mother, being both begotten at one going in of Isaac to Rebecca,
as the Apostle reports unto the Romans.

Even so Christ and Belial, God and the Devil, spring out of one act of union,
and conjunction of God and man, which must of necessity have in its divine
wisdom and humane, else God and man are not existing therein.

For the wisdom of God transcends all creatures, and it is the excellency of
mankind, that his wisdom transcends all creatures on the earth besides
himself: So that without the wisdom of God, and the wisdom of a creature,
the creation of man is not, for he is made in the Image of God.

Therefore in the propagation of the Son of God, there is the wisdom of God,
subjecting and prostrating man's wisdom unto it self, which is the bringing
forth of Christ the Son of God.

Also the wisdom humane subjecting and prostrating the wisdom of God unto it
self, as the Serpent did the wisdom of the woman, who was made in the Image
of God, is the bringing forth of Antichrist the seed of the Serpent the son
of perdition.

So that it is God and man conceived and brought forth by the wisdom of God,
which is Christ the Son of God, the Savior of mankind.

And it is man and God conceived and brought forth according to the principles
of humane wisdom; that is, Antichrist the son of perdition and that
destroyer of mankind.

So that they are one in conjunction, and unity of God and man in the root, as
near as Jacob and Esau were in that one act of generation, but in the springing
up, and perfecting of them, they are as different and at as great a distance as
Jacob and Esau were, in those two nations of Israel, and Edom.

And here note with me (my good friends) that man cannot be known (no not that
man of God) nor yet that man of sin, in a simple act of creation, without
respect unto generation, nor in one simple act of generation, without respect
to that act of creation.

For as it is in nature, that all the wisdom in the world, in the act of man's
creation, cannot express or set forth his multiplication and continuation, on
the earth, but with respect unto the act and virtue of generation; nor can it
in the act of generation, set forth and declare man's beginning and original
but with respect unto that act of creation; even so no man can truly preach
Christ in that work of creation as we are Gods work-manship created in Christ
unto good works, but with respect unto the act of generation, as he is the seed
of the woman begotten and borne of a virgin.

Nor can he be truly known in the act of generation, but with respect unto that
act of creation, as the spirit of God carries up his geneology, which was the
son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God.

For the wisdom of God, and the wisdom of a creature, are both in the unity;
which is as that unformed Chaos, in the beginning; but Christ is only
propagated according to the wisdom of God, and Antichrist is generated by the
wisdom of a creature, which is the giving of every thing a form and virtue
out of that confused and deformed Chaos.

So that without generation, creation has no offspring, and without creation,
generation has no beginning or original.

Therefore the Son of God is void, without the one, and the other, and so is
that Son of perdition.

Note therefore, that in that unity or act of creation of God and man to be one
workmanship, there is a kindred between Christ and Antichrist, as near in all
respects, as that of Jacob and Esau, considered in that lawful contract and
act of Isaac and Rebecca.

But in that act of conception and springing up, according to the wisdom of
God, and the wisdom proper to a creature, there is that infinite distance and
disproportion, as is between Israel and Edom, Christ and Antichrist, the son of
God, and the son of perdition: Our Apostle therefore does with good advice
exhort the Saints of God not to grudg against the men of the world, and that in
the relation of brethren, saying

Grudge not brethren one against another.
Grieve not, or groan not, as the word is, that is, let not the enmity that is
in the world be vexatious unto you: But behold in that way of sin and death,
Gods wonderful device for the inlet of wrath and execution of justice in the
world, and know that without that way of destruction, salvation had never been.

For if the Son of God had not been made sin in our nature, and yet so as not
to know sin, that is, never to approve thereof, or be stained therewith in the
least, for never was guile found in his mouth, being that Immaculate and
spotless Lamb of God, altogether pure, without superfluity or defect: So that
his nature in whatsoever is proper unto him, is free from all guilt and stain,
although he be found in a true sense in that condition which is sinful.

Otherwise our nature had never been made the righteousness of God in him; for
whatsoever is proper and natural unto man, knows no such righteousness, nor
can it approve of, or be satisfied therewith; therefore can we never receive
and accept thereof, but with the loss and denial of all things proper to the
nature of man, as considered in that offspring of the earth, which he is
changed and renewed from by the wisdom and spirit of God, being turned from
darkness into light, fram Satan unto God, a change which all the Saints
participate of; therefore can no flesh boast, for by this means boasting is
excluded, our own works are utterly renounced.

Even so, the Son of God is become darkness in the men of the world, as
absolutely as man is made light in the Lord, therefore it is said, that if the
light which is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness: For if that
which makes light be become darkness, there is nothing left to cure that
darkness: so also if man's nature which is in it self is darkness, be made
light it self in the Son of God, as he affirms of the Disciples, that they are
the light of the world (the same that is said of himself) what is it that can
impair or diminish that light.

So that as wicked men have changed the truth of God into a lie, and have
changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like corruptible
man, so they have changed the light of God into darkness in themselves.

And herein Christ has given himself as a ransom complete, and every way
proportionable for ever, unto that condition which mankind is brought back and
redeemed into, which is to be the son of the eternal and living God, to dwell
with him in that inexcessible light which no flesh can approach unto: and it is
alike holy and precious act in God to give his holy Son to be judged,
condemned, and executed in the world, and yet be no proper cause thereof, as it
is to save man by nature sinful, and God himself the plenary cause thereof;
for to justify the wicked, and condemn the just are alike abomination; yet
God has found a way wherein the Just one by nature (is and ever shall be so in
the Saints) is in the world condemned, and also that wicked one (who is and
ever shall be so in the wicked) is justified and saved in himself, that is, in
the Lord.

Grudge not therefore brethren (by unity and contract in creation) one against
another, though in act of conception, and springing up from that one Embryon,
or formlesse substance, you become thus un naturalized and divided into two
Nations in direct antithesis one to another, quarrel not against the work of
God herein, but admire his wisdom, who has hereby brought to pass our
salvation, by the stopping of the mouth of all flesh, that glory may for ever
redound to him, and not to the creature.

For it is as voluntary an act in the wisdom of man to choose the way of
death, in the preferring of the things proper to a creature, before the things
that are of God; as it is in the wisdom of God in Christ, to prefer and make
choice of things proper to the eternal, before those which are momentany and
mortal, so that the work shall never say to the workman, why have thou made
me on this fashion? For nature would not give in exchange its own nature and
disposition for another, because its life and being cleaves thereunto, which
the nature of another must of necessity be death unto it, which is declined by
all things. Do not murmr then, nor grieve, let not the works of God be any
way vexatious unto you, but behold with joy and admiration that wonderful
wisdom of God in that comely order of his justice, who has adorned himself
with as glorious ornaments of wrath in the execution thereof on the world, as
he has done in the distribution of his grace and mercy in that way of his
only Son; in the one is the thing given as a purchase, and in the other is the
thing purchased. Our father Abraham was well acquainted with this point, when
he bought that burying place of the sons of Heth, for him and his to be
buried out of sight: he would not take it as a gift, but gave out the just
proportionable worth thereof in money by weight; for he knew according to the
truth of Justice, that as there was a valuable consideration given for a place
wherein to be buried out of sight (as Abraham says of Sarah) a like riches and
dignity should be in the inheriting and possessing of the land by his seed, to
teach us this point, that according to the worth of that which is given to be
buried in the world, which is the Son of God; where none of his virtues nor
graces is declared, alike shall be the worth of that estate and condition of
such as are risen again in Christ (according to the rule of justice) which is
no less then Sonship unto the eternal and living God.

This was in the heart of David, moving him not to accept of that kind offer of
Araunah the Jebusite, concerning that threshing floor, oxen, and instruments,
but would pay a valuable price for them, because he would not worship the Lord
in offering of that which cost not a valuable price.

And this is written according to the letter (as all other Scripture is) in
every man's heart, and utters it self (if not stifled through desire of gain
in all merchandises of the world.

Such therefore as have critically brooded upon the Scriptures to hatch a
temporary and humane death only, to be the death of Christ Jesus, the Son of
God, telling us of an ayry virtue or efficacy thereof merely imaginary; for
they know not how any reality thereof should reach unto us through ages past;
for say they, his death was so long ago, and but of part of three days and
three nights continuation, for whole ones they cannot make them all: and it was
only the humane nature that dyed, which is only a separation of soul and body,
and neither separated from God. By which doctrine it follows, that man's
resurrection and life is only a rejoicing of soul and body, without any unity
or conjunction with God, which is the overthrow and destruction of the doctrine
of Christ, and so of the state of the Son of God, and of salvation.

For there is as real a departure from God in the day of the wicked, whose
state and condition consists of God and man (otherwise no eternal wrath) as
there is a coming to God in the way of the Saint of Israel, whose state and
condition consists of God and man, otherwise there were no eternal mercy and
favor; the doctrine of the world therefore teaching a monarchical Christ, and
a kingdom bounded by time (at least in point of time past) it is of proper use
to whet and sharpen the spirits of men, to hunt and seek after a State and
Kingdom of that nature and constitution which man exercises, and not the
Son of God.

These men have tied all sin originally to one man in the fall (as they by
tradition call it) but yet know not how, nor by whom the entrance of sin came:
But carry us to imaginary Angels suitable to the rest of their doctrine, neither
know they the way of the derivation of it, which is of so great concernment.

Even so they having tied all righteousness unto one particular and individual
man in his resurrection, compassed and surrounded by time, but are ignorant of
the way and manner of the derivation of it; for it is whole Christ derived, or
else salvation is imperfect and maimed: But the spirit of Christ (or as some
mince it) the influence of the spirit, without the body complete, is but a part
of Christ, the Son of God divided (as by this way of derivation he is) is as
sound a doctrine, as to say Paul was crucified for you.

To conclude this point therefore, the work of God in ordering of the state of
the wicked truly known and rightly judged of, is of no more disquiet, grief, or
vexation unto the Saints of God, then the work of God in our salvation is; no,
though our brother the Lord Christ be so given up unto death in them, as never
to live in them any more, for it is our ransom, the justice and equity of the
purchase paid for the eternal release of our souls; for the salvation of God
holds firm in all respects, wherein the heart of man, or subtilty of Satan can
put forth it self; that as there is complete salvation free without money, or
money-worth, as also in conquest by force and strength, so also in point of
strictness of justice, in giving a valuable and considerable price in way of
purchase.

The spirit then of grief, vexation and anguish, cleaves unto, as it is the
proper portion of the brotherhood considered in Edom, and not in Israel, found
in Mount Seir, or as the word signifies, the mount of the Devil, and not in
Horeb, the mount of God.

Therefore the argument against grief and vexation at this brotherhood is
added, viz. Lest ye be condemned; that is, fretting, grieving, and vexation at
the wonderful work of God, is condemnation, and properly is the practice of
that Fornicator, and profane person Esau, when he has so lustfully and
profanely parted with the birthright, to satisfy his corrupt and carnal
desires, bred and begotten in hunting after the things of this life, which is
to pursue that hind of the morning (as the Psalmist calls Christ) to put him
to death, for the glory of the flesh and of God cannot subsist and stand
together.

The word (Lest) in this phrase is not used as a supposition, but as a certain
affirmation, as where one Prophet says, lest Hezekiah deceive you: Another
expounds it, Hezekiah does deceive you. So also where one Evangelist reports
the words of Christ, Lest the people faint in the way: Another repeating it,
says, The people will faint in the way. So in this place, lest ye be
condemned, is, ye are under condemnation whosoever so does; for that is the
condemning spirit that frets and grieves at the works of God, which is ever
found in the world, who can never endure that way and manner of the translation
of the right of inheritance from him which is born after the flesh, unto him
which is born after the spirit: but vows the death of the Son, which ever puts
an end unto mourning for the death of the father also: now to be condemned, is
to be pronounced and held guilty, as to justify is to acquit and make
righteous, as the Apostle opposes them, It is God (says he) that justifies,
who then shall condemn? that is, it is God that acquits and makes righteous,
who then can make guilty and sinful?

To be grieved and vexed then at the wickedness of the world, is to be under
guilt and condemnation; that is, when men cannot justify and give excellency
unto that work of Gods justice in his execution of wrath on the world, and
rejoice therein through that ransom given to rescue out of that condition, as
well as he can be glad of that exercise of mercy in that inheritance and
possession which he is put into, for the glory of God in our salvation consists
in the one as well as in the other, and is alike glorious, and to be approved
of in them both, according to the nature and manner of Gods operations found,
and conversant in the one and in the other, and in them both complete salvation
is made manifest.

Nor is it the proper state and condition of the wicked, simply considered in
it self, that makes wretched, but as it has respect to the state of the just,
for with respect to both is condemnation completed.

Note here then, that he that cannot be freely willing that the spirit of grace
and of God should suffer loss in the men of the world, of all its proper life,
virtue, and operation, as it is that whereby the men of God live, move, and act
in all things.

That man can never give consent, that that wicked spirit of the world which by
nature is proper to all flesh, should ever be made in the excellencies of the
Son of God, or furnished with the strength and operations of God.

Hence it is, that men have carved out unto themselves a better thing then Ish,
the man of strength, vigor, and courage; and a worse then Enosh, the man of
baseness and sorrows; that is, they teach a better estate and condition then
that of man, which is only in God himself; and so they make Christ not to be
very God, which is to destroy Christ unto themselves; and they set up a worse
thing then Antichrist, which is the Devil, and in the one and the other the
form, the faith of Devils in themselves, which is to believe tremblingly, that
there is one God: but to believe, that of twain he is made one new man in
Christ, that wisdom and confidence they attain not.

So they conclude a Godhead out of Christianity, and then it is out of Christ
the wisdom of God, and so he is properly the tormentor of the world; and they
conclude a Devil out of man, and then he has not the wisdom and corrupt will
of the flesh, and that is none but the Son of God, the Savior of the world,
whom they account not only as one having a Devil, but as Beelzebub the prince
of Devils, which is no more then to preach Christ for Antichrist, and
Antichrist for Christ, and these are taken as men fit to make Preachers, and
able to correct all errors in the world; for as it has been in Councels and
Synods, even so it is now; but herein lies a great point of the deceit and
snare wherein the world catches it self.

And these are the men that groan, grumble, and grieve at the works of God,
both in just and unjust, for they can neither endure the work of God according
to the excellency and top of perfection, as it is in Christ; nor yet the work
of God, according as it is in that man of sin, Antichrist, who goes about as a
roaring Lion seeking whom he may devour: but they cannot abide to hear that
he that is men is that man slayer from the beginning, and so grieve that Cain
should have his proper due.

And when ever the Gospel appears in the truth and reality of it, they hold it
comes to torment them before its time. For either it vilifies that which they
exalt, or else it exalts that which they so vilify, and the time is never
seasonable to them neither for the one nor the other.

And such as hold a state and condition between the son of God, and the son
of perdition (which is a real condition proper to the sons of men) they have
it from the same principles from which the place of Purgatory does spring,
which the same men seem so zealously to condemn and approve, as Doctors of that
kingdom which cannot stand, being divided in it self, but is in the way of the
sall, and not of the resurrection; and so much for the argument drawn from the
danger, Lest ye be condemned.

The second follows, which is the readiness for execution, and that in way of
wonder, Behold the Judge stands before the door.

Behold, that is, admire and wonder at the appearing of this sign also, namely
that the righteous Judge of all the earth, that renders to every one according
to his work, has no other door to come in at, no other way of entrance,
whereby to pass sentence of absolution or condemnation; no way to quit the
just, or condemn the wicked; no way to exercise mercy or severity, but only
through this twofold estate and condition of mankind, namely the crucifiers
of Christ according to the flesh, and the crucifiers of Christ according to the
spirit.

Therefore he that finds a condition, way or act, wherein God is only as a bare
spectator or else exercises somewhat besides, or out of the way, either of
mercy or wrath, among the sons of men, let such conclude of another estate in
mankind besides these twayn.

But let such know that they are not of the spirit of Abraham, the friend of
God; for he acknowledged freely the Lord to be Judge of all the earth, in that
destruction of Sodom, and deliverance of just Lot, which these men deny, if
there be another way of the administration of the Creature, whereinto the Lord
enters not, for he has no way of entrance in the way of his administrations
among the sons of men, but only at this two fold door, either of mercy or wrath.

Let such look to this point who makes a good and commendable way of
administration in mere civil affayrs, wherein the grace and favor of God is
not properly exercised in that way of Christ, neither is the wrath of God in
exercise as in that way of Antichrist: But such will find that he who is not of
the faith and works of Abraham, he is of the law of the flesh and spirit of
the world; and he that has the spirit of the world, has not the spirit of
Christ; And whosoever has noth the spirit of Christ, the same is none of his:
and they that do not the works of Abraham, they are not the children of
Abraham, but of their father the Devil, whose works they do, and will do. For
this twofold door is the only way of entrance in all the ways of
administration belonging to him who is that righteous Judge of all the earth.

Therefore he is said to stand before the door, or as the word may be read,
with the door; that is, has settled and confirmed himself to be Judge of all,
with this way of entrance, for administration; for the word stand, in this
place signifies to minister, as in the administration of the Priests and
Levites in the house of the Lord; It is said, that Judah rejoiced that they
stood before the Lord: So the Prophets are said to stand before the Lord, when
they Minister with power and authority from him.

And the word translated (Before) may be read with, by the allowance of the
spirit of God; for where one Prophet says, I am a stranger (before) thee as my
fathers were: Another reports the same thus, I am a stranger (with) thee as all
my fathers were.

And where it is translated to be the speech of the King to Haman, he will
force the Queen (before) me in the room. Another translates, he will force the
Queen (with) me in the room, and many the like; for the Hebrew words, ethpenei,
and liphenei, are both one of the same signification, and put one for another
in the Scriptures.

To conclude this point, the wonderful and miraculous power of the Gospel, in
being a savor of life unto life, and a savor of death unto death, consists in
this two leaved gate, as the phrase of the Prophet is: and here it is a door of
a double or twofold entrance of one eternal act in the distribution of mercy
and justice: For behold, the Judge has no other entrance, but with respect of
opening this twofold work of the mystery of God, and the mystery of iniquity;
for the performance of all the works which have been, are, or shall be
exercised and done among the children of men, the truth whereof is ever repined
at by such as are under the power of condemnation, from whom he separates the
Saints, whereupon the next words are brought in as holding a consimilitude
among themselves.

Verse. 10. Take my brethren the Prophets, who have spoken in the name of the
Lord for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience.
In which words observe,
1. A reiteration, with an addition of the term Brethren, My brethren. 2.
Adoration, leading them to the Prophets for a pattern, who are described unto
us, 1. By their speaking of the word of the Lord. 2. By their suffering
affliction and patience therein.
1. HE gives the term brethren here as he did before, but in another respect,
for he excludes that brotherhood, as having respect to that of Esau, therefore
he speaks unto them conjunctively, and assumptively, my brethren.

So that it is not the phrase of Scripture that is only to be minded in the
understanding of the will of God, but what it is that God intends in that place
by using such a phrase, so accompanied with its coherence, otherwise we may
take Antichrist for the true Christ, and the true Christ for Antichrist, and
the God of this world for the true God.

For sometimes the word Gods in the plural number intends Idols, as the
Apostle teaches, there are Gods many, and Lords many; that is, Idols cut out
unto places, and offices in the world created and set up by men, but unto us
says he, there is but one God.

And sometimes the plural Gods, Elohim signifies the true God, the Creator and
maker of all, as it is said, In the beginning God created the heavens and the
earth, etc. And sometimes the same word is taken for the holy and godly Judges
in Israel, as when the servant after his seven years service would not depart
from his master, he was to be brought to the Gods, the word is Elohim; that is,
to the Judges, to have his ear bored through to serve him for ever.

So also the Scriptures makes report of false Christ's in the plural number, and
the true anointed is given in the plural phrase also, where the Psalmist
says, Touch not my Christ's, and do my Prophets no harm; and so Antichrist,
styles himself Christ in the singular phrase, as well as the true Christ is so
expressed, as the Evangelist reports, many shall come in my name, and shall
say, I am Christ, and shall deceive many; there is joy in the stony ground
where the corn withers, and never comes to good, as well as in that harvest
which is ripened in the kingdom of God, where they return with joy, bringing
their sheaves with them: there is a righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees
which enters not into the kingdom, as well as that of the Son of God, who is
the Lord our righteousness, the very kingdom it self, and the inlet
thereinto also.

Yea, there is a faith of Devils, as well as the faith of the Son of God, as
the Apostle declares, Thou beleives there is one God, thou do well, the Devil
also beleives and trembles.

The phrase of Scripture therefore without the scope and intent thereof, is the
common deceit of all the world where the Scriptures are read, and the rest
have the substance thereof written in their hearts.

So that no humane learning (which is but the Dilucidation, or Lucifer of those
principles) can possibly give light to lead to the true knowledge of the
Scriptures: The mis-apprehending of this point running away with the phrase, as
men by their Concordance heap up phrases of Scripture to confirm their
doctrine, whereas every one is of several interpretation, never minding the
intent, but only the sound of words, is the very cause of all the
principalities, powers, the rulers of the darkness of this world, and
spiritual wickedness (or wicked spirits as the word is) in high places, which
are so elevated, consecrated, and judged of such necessity in the world, for
from hence arises the unction of the King, as being set in that office and
room of that King of Salem, Prince of peace, and from this is the Bishop
consecrated, and installed, as bearing the office and place of that great
Bishop and feeder of our souls: and out of this mistake arises all those
offices and officers, respectively, standing in relation to the one, and to the
other, whereby the pure word of eternity, comes to be prostrated and
adulterated by bringing it into copulation with vanishing things, which perish
in the use.

Submitting it unto the glory of the creature, and not the creature to the
glory of him, who is God blessed for ever, Amen.

Note here, that the laws and orders of men in the world standing upon the
letter of the Scripture, in sound of word, and not in the sense, in the history
which alters in form, and not in the mystery that abides for ever; hence it is
that they are built upon the sands, as Christ reports.

And when any people comes to see into the defects of the foundation which
another people stand upon, they encourage themselves, to pull down the building
of another, to make their own more firm, so that which the world takes to be
the strength and safety of it self, comes in few years to be the depopulating
and ruin thereof.

For it is as possible to give as good ground and argument for one way and
order set up, upon the said principles, as for another, as for water in
baptism, and men of ripe years, as wine in the supper, and infants counted the
seed of the Church debarred, and for the cutting off the foreskin of the
flesh, as well as either of them both: and upon this ground comes in that
continued work, and great employment of reformation in the world, and shall
never be accomplished by the change of titles of officers, and forms of
institutions; so long as they are placed upon the same foundation, namely the
bare letter of the Scripture: but the best perfection it will be brought unto,
is to persecute Joseph for interpretting the dream.

In this point of the letter or phrase of the Scripture, and the true intent
and scope thereof, consists that threefold temptation brought in by Satan
against Christ, and Christ his effectual answer thereunto; in the one stands
the subtilty of the Devil, and in the other the wisdom and mind of the Son
of God.

2. And hence he brings in the direction leading us to the Prophets as to a
pattern how to come to the true knowledge of the mind of God; that is, to the
true interpreters of the Scriptures, for the Hebrew word Nabi, and the Greek
Prophets, signifies speaking, interpretting, and uttering words and Oracles
that come immediately from God.

So that we have no true example, copy, extract, draught, or pattern of the law
of God, the order and composure of the kingdom of God, but by having recourse
to the true interpretation of the word of God.

And there is no true Prophecy of any private interpretation, but holy men of
God speak as they are moved by the spirit of God; that is, there is no true
interpretation given of any part of the word of God, when it is bounded to any
particular time, or age, or confined to any particular time, or age, or
confined to one particular person alone; but as the spirit of God remains the
same in its motion, so does the word of God in its expression and creating
virtue accompanying the same in Christ, and it is a thing too sublime to be
congealed into ink, too secret and hidden to be printed upon paper, too
precious to be piled up in Libraries, and of too prince-like a spirit to enter
into contract with, or be subservant unto any school of humane learning.

For it is the spirit of the Son only, that knows the mind of the father,
and it is he and not another, that must reveal it unto us.

So that if ever we receive that fiery law of the spirit, we must ascend into
the mount of God, namely into the height of the condition of him who sits at
the right hand of God, being that whereby he manifests his wisdom and skill,
power and glory (even as a man manifests his art and skill by his right hand)
which no art, power, nor policy of man can ever reach or attain unto.

This pattern is set before us in the Prophets only, or in that one great
Prophet in the interpretation and unfolding of the word of God, or in the
translation of the original language; that is, in declaring how the things of
God are transformed through the carnal conceptions of men, into the principles
and rudiments of the creature, and so is in them become a profane Grecian,
which makes the Son of God so complain, that his vissage is marred more then
any man, and his form more then the sons of men.

And this is a language will speak in Cain and all his posterity, when ink and
paper shall vanish as smoke.

There is also a skill to translate the spirit of man into the principles and
excellencies of the Son of God, as being thereby become that holy Hebrew, of
Heber, yea the seed of Abraham, and Son of God, to speak according to that
voice of the blood of sprinkling which has in it power to pass over the
destroying Angel for ever; if these were as truly translated or interpretted
in the world as the letters and sillables of the Bible are into our native
tongue, we should see more eminent and excellent Scholars appear then now we
do.

1. And here the Prophets are described to be such as speak in the name of the
Lord; that is, in the power and authority of the Son of God; for to speak in
the name of God, is to speak in the authority and power of God, which
comprehends not only speech, but action also; that is, those signs and
wonders, and mighty works which accompany the preaching of the Gospel in the
confirmation of it, testifying the presence of God, accompanying the word,
making it good by act and deed, according to the expressions thereof.

For the word of God is never truly uttered without the appearance of a sign
and wonder, and a great work no less then such as holds proportion with God
for the confirmation of the same.

Now we know a wonder is a monster in nature, such as no nature in its proper
instinct brings forth, it goes beyond the bounds, abilities, and precincts of
any natural confines whatsoever, and without such works, signs, or wonders,
the Gospel is never truly preached; for if it should, Christ's promise would
fail, but heaven and earth shall fail, before that one jot or tittle of the
word of God come to corruption.

So that there is no speech or doctrine of the Gospel, but in its expression it
frames, constitutes, and brings forth, a work of such nature as no simple
nature whatsoever can bring forth, therefore a wonder and a sign, to be
admired, yea truly miraculous, for no nature can reach thereunto, in the utmost
extent thereof.

For as it is true, that there is no operation of the spirit of God, in the way
of Christ, but it is above and goes beyond the nature of the creature, having
the power and glory of the Creator in it, nor is it attainable by any, or by
all creatures.

So it is true also that there is not any work, or operation of the Gospel,
which the divine nature simply and abstractively considered can be said to be
in any capacity or possibility to attain thereunto, but the possibility of God
to do all things stands in his making himself to be such a one, otherwise it is
unattaniable in the nature divine simply and singly considered, because there
is no work of the Gospel without man considered in it, no more then there is a
Christ without man's nature who is the subject matter of the Gospel.

And as Christ is not without man's nature, no more is any work of the Gospel;
for as the divine nature cannot of it self simply and solely considered, dye,
nor ascend, neither descend, being incomprehensible.

No more can the humane nature considered simply in it self, have in it
eternal life, comprehend all things, or be omnipotent but in that unity of the
Gospel, the Son of God, they are all brought to pass, and all in act, and
being in that one Christ, nothing in him therefore whatsoever; but being set
forth and brought to light, there appear a wonder, a miracle is wrought, a
sign set up for the confirmation of the Gospel, such as no nature simply
considered can attain unto, or bring forth; so that if the true word of the
Prophet, or of interpretation be spoken, this true and miraculous work must
enevitably appear, transcending all nature in the utmost capacity thereof.

And therefore that saying holds firm, that we have a Meditor made higher then
the heavens, a work and wonder above all nature simply and solely considered,
and therefore Christ is that new creature, yea the beginning or head of the
creation of God, for God is one in the work, not only in making, but as one
made in Christ.

And thus the Prophets are invested with power and authority to speak in the
name of the Lord, not only in word, but in work also, a sign and wonder
accompanying the word at all times, which makes them most noble, and God-like,
to the cutting off of the spirit of Princes, becoming terrible to the Kings of
the earth.

2. Whence he brings in the second description of a true Prophet as the means
whereby this power and authority is attained; and that is, through suffering
affliction, and long patience.

By suffering affliction in this place, we are to understand a being cut off
from being supported by any earthly power, carnal policy, or any temporal
glory whatsoever, with respect to friends or alies, or any earthly relations
which fade and vanish away, which human spirits seek unto, and rely upon, for
the promoting of themselves.

For only in the loss and laying aside all these things, a true Prophet comes
to be invested into the power, wisdom, and excellency of the Son of God, in
whom is found all friendship, all offices, and all relations whatsoever not
only completed, but also eternized to abide for ever, in whose power and
authority by this means they go forth.

By this means it was that Moses became so great a deliverer; for he refusing
to be called the Son of Pharaohs daughter, choosing rather to suffer adversity
with the people of God, in the loss of all such kind of glory as Pharaohs
Court afforded, became an effectual instrument to manifest that power and
glory, throughout all the land of Egypt, in the deliverance of Gods chosen,
and overthrow of his enemies.

Again, take Eliah for an instance in this point, comprehending all the
Prophets, as he did in his appearance with Christ in the transfiguration, and
you shall find him complaining that he is left alone, as cut off from all
relations from carnal apostatized Israel, and his life sought after to be
taken away also, by the policy and power of the whole kingdom of Israel under
the Government of that wicked Ahab.

For a true Prophet is to endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ,
and no man that warreth intangleth himself with the affairs of this life,
that he may please him who has chosen him to be a soldier; For no
superiority, dignity, or advance, no place of office or atendance, no
conjunction or relation of this life, but must suffer wrack and ruin, in the
true prosecution of the authority and spirit of a Prophet, otherwise the name
of God is not called upon, as Christ witnesses, saying, For whosoever of you
he be, that forsakes not all that he has, he cannot be my Disciple.

The bond of family with respect to wife and children, must give way to this;
the bond of trade and employment must give way to this, the bond of office and
place to uphold this tottering temporary order amongst men, must give way to
this, the bond and tie to particular congregations of tittuler Pastor, Teacher;
or in any other way, hireling ministry, which are much alike to family, cares,
relations, and employments to maintain a temporary credit and livelihood in
this life, the power and spirit of Eliah breaks them to pieces; if the spirit
of God breath, it snaps them all like Sampsons bands, which were but as flax
when it smells the fire, though the world in the loss of the lock, by its
Dla's, who has bewitched them, to stand engaged unto it, contrary to the
express word of Christ, which says, If any man come to me, and hate not his
father and mother, and wife and children, and brethren and sisters, yea and his
own life also, he cannot be my Disciple.

When did we hear of any of the Prophets or Apostles tied unto wife, children,
congregation or family, who have spoken in the power and authority of the Son
of God, or what earthly relation was any of them tied unto: We read of Hosea
marrying a wife of fornications for a sign unto the people, and also of Peter's
wives mother, which are but slender arguments to encourage men to sit down and
dwell by temporary relations, and make them a sufficient fence and guard to put
off all Gods calls and intimations, to attend upon him in any other way, if it
make not for the support and supply of such engagements; where is there a man
that acknowledges a call from God, if it make not for the promoting of
himself in temporary things at the least in his expectation; and if it prove
contrary, he takes it up as a fore burden; what ever becomes of the cause of
God, it must be subservant to these things; no marvail though the world be void
of the joyful presence of God, when we rejoice in nothing but what (in
effect) the bruit beasts seek after.

Obj. But it will be said, that how ever the Prophets, Apostles, and Christ
himself went on in the neglect of all temporary relations, yet how careful
were the Patriarchs in the preservation and mayntaining of them.

Answ. To which we answer, that the Prophets, Apostles, and Christ himseife
teach in their practice, how we ought to stand affected with these earthly
things, and how to demean our selves toward them in this our pilgrimage
through the world.

And the fathers of old teach us by their demeanor, what care and respect we
are to have in the conservation of such relations which are spiritual, and
abide for ever, as they are constituted in Christ, and conversant in the family
and house of God.

Obj. It will be said, that men uniting themselves to particular congregations,
as Pastor, Teacher, Elders, Deacons, and Members, is of divine institution, and
ought to be mayntained and contended for, according to the practice of the
Apostles, and those seven Churches, with their 7. Angels, or Messengers
particularly described and set forth in the Revelations.

Answ. To which we answer; that such as the salvation and faith is which we
contend for, and maintain, such is the Church, but we contend for the common
salvation and faith once delivered to the Saints; and so we do for a universal
Church and congregation of the firstborn, whose names are enrolled in heaven,
once and for ever constituted; and that doctrine and prayer which is of less
comprehension, that it reaches not universally to involve the complete
mystical body of Christ, it is a private spirit, and not consonant to the
doctrine and intercession of Jesus Christ, which has a like respect to all the
chosen of God, and that in all times and ages.

And for those particular Churches mentioned in Scripture, they are all
represented unto us in those seven Churches in the Revelations, which all
vanish in the opening of heaven, in the fourth Chapter, and are never heard of
again, which only set forth unto us in their several virtues, and sevenfold
fullness and perfection therein, the state of that Church governed by him only
that sits on the Throne, adorned with those 4. lively weights, and four and
twenty Elders, furnished with that Angelical and fullness of Ministry, set
forth by seven Angels, seven Trumpets, and seven Vialls, enriched with all
those excellencies, declared throughout that whole book, and the perfection of
this one only Church is signified unto us, in the virtue of those seven, as the
excellency of one spirit of God is set forth unto us in that report of seven
spirits of God being about the throne, and this one Church is signified and set
forth in that of Philadelphia, which has nothing but commendable things found
in her, and no reproof, uncomelinesse, or imperfection at all.

Again, those seven Churches teach unto us, that one Congregation or Synagogue
of Satan, wherein is contained that sevenfold wickedness and fullness of
sin, in that Babylon the great, the mother of whoredoms, and proper seat of
wickedness in the land of Shiner, to which it is all conveyed and carried in
that Evah, which the Prophet Zachariah speaks of, and this is signified unto us
in that one Church of Laodicea, commended in nothing, but condemned in all
things according to just deserts, having atracted all wickedness from that
Angelical Ministry by turning the truth of God into a lie, and this Church is
ruled by the Dragon, the beast, and the false Prophet, in all those abominable
practices and filthinesses set forth therein to the end of that Book.

He therefore that sets himself as a Pastor over one particular people or
congregation, and yet it is not without reproof, nor does his exercise in the
word and doctrine, comprehend all the flock of God, and concerns the state of
every Saint of God particularly, that man will be found a feeder only of the
mother of harlots, and as a Dragon to devour the man-child with Herod, when he
appears, and not as that good shepherd who gives himself for the flock, not
having that spirit of the Apostle that the care of all the Churches is upon
him, as all in one, and one in all, as the true Spouse says, draw me, we will
run after thee; A single eye has respect to all Saints alike, has a like care
of them, and they are a like precious unto him; the Son of God never directed
the virtue of his death, or labor of his love to some of his chosen before
others, but men in these days have framed a pastoral charge to be a fat
pasture for themselves, or else the call of God speaks not therein.

But a true Prophet is under the loss, and in the departure from all these
things, and thereby is invested with the power and authority of the Son of God,
speaking in his name, words of wonder, and admiration, and not as the Scribes.

And they do not only suffer themselves to be dispossessed of these things, but
they have long patience, or under-abiding in this condition, it alters not,
what change soever comes upon them in this world, for they are not less
jealous of that which the world counts prosperity, then they are of that it
calls adversity, and are as watchful under good reports as bad, knowing a like
snare in both.

Not as such as seem to suffer for a time, and are zealous against the common
practices of the world, till they have gotten some high place amongst men, and
then they come to comply with the greatest worldling, and conversant with
worldly affairs, that can put forth it self to be a consociate, or
suffragator unto them.

Note for conclusion of this point, that a true Prophet knows his liberty, how
that all things are lawful, but all things are not expedient; all things are
lawful, but he is not brought under the power and dominion of any thing; he
may marry, but so as though he had no wife, he may use the world, but as though
it were of no use unto him at all; and he may buy, but so as one that never
intends to possess, for he makes no store or treasure of any thing that is of
a perishing nature, no not of the worlds ordinances of Christ, as they call
them, being of such nature as are only comprised within the narrow confines of
this mortal life, which they cannot extend nor draw them out beyond, and
therefore things that perish as bodily exercises which profit not.

So that whatsoever a true Prophet makes use of in the world, he abides under
suffering of the loss of it, and is disjointed from it, in the enjoyment of
it, in point of that spirit, wherewith the men of the world pursue and make use
of the same thing, becoming a pilgrim and stranger, to whatsoever the common
spirit of the sons of men account themselves at home in, and is no more
contracted, or affianced unto the things of this life, then he shall be when in
respect of this mortal life, he is no more to converse with these transitory
things, and affairs.

Whereupon he brings in the next words in way of answer to a question, might
arise as thus; If the Saints of God suffer affliction under so long continued
patience, wherein then does their rest and comfort consist, the answer is,

Verse. 11. Behold, we count them happy that endure. Ye have heard of the
patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord, for the Lord is very
pitiful and of tender mercy.
In which words observe these particulars.
1. The esteem had of enduring and suffering: Behold we count them hapy that
endure. 2. A pattern thereof propounded; Ye have heard of the patience of Job.
3. The end God aims at and attains therein: And have seen the end of the Lord.
4. The ground and reason of the effecting and accomplishing thereof, for the
Lord is very pitiful and of tender mercy.
FIrst, for the esteem and account had of suffering, it is brought in by way of
admiration and wonder, Behold, it is no less then a miracle, that all
happiness should consist in durance and suffering; for the Saints of God upon
true account can sum up the blessed and hapy estate and condition in one
continued act of suffering, which all the world is so much afraid to undergo;
that is, they suffer the loss of that exercise of spirit in its enjoyments,
wherein the honor, riches, praise, and proper prosperity of all flesh does
consist (naturally considered) which is the desire and support of all the men
of the world, in the loss whereof the Saints are made partakers of that spirit
and life of the Son of God which springs up and exercises its virtue and
power in them, wherein all true happiness does consist and exercise it self.

Which all carnal men decline, detest and abhor, for they will never accept
nor receive Christ upon his own terms and conditions, but contrarily reject and
cast him off preferring the pleasures of sin which are but for a season
before those riches and treasures stored up for ever in that Son of God.

It is a wonder, and miraculous, that afflictions and sufferings which all men
are so fearful of, should be filled with the victory, joy, and triumph of a
Savior: therefore it is that the Apostle says (being well acquainted with
this point) God forbid that I should rejoyoe in any thing save in the cross of
our Lord Jesus Christ, whereby the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the
world.

Yet all men cannot but have an honorable esteem and high account of an
innocent suffering as having praise-worthinesse therein, Behold we count them
happy that endure. Yea the integrity of the silver tried in the fining pot, and
the soundness and solidity of the gold in the furnace, are precious in the
sight of all men.

Who is the man, but when the the suffering and the sufferer seem both to be
removed out of the world, will not seem to approve of the work? Abraham's
departure from his fathers house to go to a land he knew not whether, and his
abode in the same land as a stranger and sojourner, not enjoying a foots
breadth thereof, as the martyr Stephen reports, is approved as an excellent
thing by all now in our days: but would be counted great folly, to give it a
present being in a Prince to for sake his royalties to undergo the cross of
Christ: So also his seed going down into Egypt, and suffering hard bondage
under cruel task* masters, with their tediousness and dangerous travel in the
wilderness enduring so many cruel assaults of the heathen, and in their
entrance into the promised land, by those seven nations greater and stronger
then they.

The dispertions and persecutions of the Prophets and Apostles, together with
the sufferings and death of Jesus born of the Virgin, these being all taken
only as things past, turned as into humane history, out of which may be
collected carnal experiments and policy; who is the man that will not lend an
ear unto them, and seem to approve them? yea the very Scribes, Pharisees, and
hypocrites cannot but trumpet out the fame of the Saints in this point of
suffering, saying, That if they had lived in the days of their fathers they
would not have persecuted the Prophets as they did, but in the mean time do
nothing else but build the Sepulchers of the Prophets, by their erecting of
temporary ordinances, carnal governments, humane institutions, and appointments
formed and framed from the pattern of the bare letter of the Scripture, under
which they keep buried, the very spirit and life of the Prophets, Apostles, and
Christ him self, stifling thereby the very virtue and power of those spiritual
and heavenly appointments of the of God among the sons of men.

In those eternal extentions and operations thereof, then the which, a greater
cruelty cannot be attempted or maintained; for as the blood shed in all
generations from Abel to Zacharias, comes justly upon that present age and
people who thus deal with the Prophets; even so that complete power, glory, and
presence of the Prince of peace, and innocent Lamb of God, which has appeared
in any, or all ages of the world, ought (according to the law of truth,
justice, and equity) to be set forth, made manifest, and acknowledged in the
present generation and age of the world, who is Jesus Christ yesterday, and to
day, and the same for ever, though the world know him not, nor will acknowledge
him so to be.

Note for conclusion of this point, that only the sufferings of the Saints of
God is an innocent suffering; for they do not wrong unto, use cruelty against,
or contradict any of the proper creatures, or workmanship of God, who is the
Creator of all things.

For how soever it be true, that the wisdom and subtilty of man, be the proper
instigator and stirrer up of all perscution and cruelty against Christ in all
ages, yet it is not that wisdom simply considered, as a work of God, but as it
has through its own voluntary propensity, sockt in, and drunk up into it self
the wisdom and word of God to the corrupting and falsifying thereof in it
self, and thereby does truly become Satanical, which condition is no proper
work of God.

Even as frail man in that way of Christ, is become the potent and eternal son
of God, and not the proper seed, and offspring of man.

So that it is the spirit and power of Satan, that the Saints kill and
crucified in themselves, and oppose in others, where, or in whomsoever it
appears, and not any proper creature of God, and therefore the Saints only are
innocent sufferers, that being all they suffer for.

Even as it is in the wicked, it is not the spirit of a simple creature which
they oppose and persecute in the godly, and kill and crucify in themselves.

But it is the spirit and wisdom of God which has drunk in the soul of the
creature into it self, through the nullifying of all humane excellencies and
glory in which the wisdom and glory of God does consist, so that it is the
wisdom of God in this act, which the world opposes and persecutes; the
sufferings of the Saints therefore are only innocent, and miraculous, for they
go beyond the power of any nature considered only in it self, which suffering
of the Saints he works up into one, as a pattern of all the rest, and that is
the second point.

Ye have heard of the patience of Job.
2. The sufferings of all the Prophets are here gathered togethe, and composed
in one, namely in Job, wherein we see the liberty of the Scriptures in
propounding it self unto us either in the singular or plural form, and that
in the grace of suffering, wherein the Saints are made exemplary, for the
sufferings of all the Prophets are here gathered up and centred in one
particular, namely in Job.

For if the sufferings of all the Saints have unity in one Son of God, and be
all of like nature, virtue and power in him, then has that one act of
suffering of the Son of God (once and for ever) alike respect unto every
particular Saint of God, and has its plurality in them, being of like nature,
virtue and efficacy wherever it appears; for whatsoever is in that great
Prophet of the Church, is of one simple and eternal act, and is as unpossible
to carry a differing nature or virtue, as for God to change in any of his
exellencies.

For it becomes the Captain of our salvation in bringing many sons to glory to
be made perfect through suffering: so that there are many sons we see, and yet
there is but one only sonship, which only sonship every one has who is not
a bastard, and no son, and is a son only by the virtue and dignity of that one
sonship and not of any other, in any respect whatsoever.

And yet there is but one son, because all have access unto the Father by one
spirit: and therefore it is that God is said to call his son out of Egypt,
when so many thousands of Israel marched out from Pharaoh, being but one body
of Isral, which is said to be done also, when Jesus, alone, after the death of
Herod, returned, being transported by Joseph and Mary, as one of no strength
without support, a great difference in humane reason between that Infant and
that Army that none of the Nations can stand before; but in both consists that
harmony which is in the natures of Christ, therefore it is a faithful saying,
that if we be dead with him, or in him, we shall also live in him, if we suffer
together (or in unity) we shall also reign in unity, so that the sufferings of
Christ are as truly multiplied in the Saints as the glory of his reign and
sonship is.

And yet it is true, that as there is but one son, so there is but one
sufferer, for he him self bears our sins in his own body upon the tree; that
is, in his body mystical, and not in an historical body, and of such nature
is the tree whereon they are born. He bore our sin; that is, all that which
is their sin in the worlds account, namely the contradicting and abrogating of
that law of the carnal commandment, standing in ordinances, which is done,
not on a wodden cross, or gibbet, but in or upon that tree of righteousness,
where only it is found to be abolished, that we being dead to sin might live
to righteousness, in which the stripes do consist, whereby we are healed.

So that the sufferer is but one complete and compacted body; the place whereon
this suffering is only found, is but that one tree of righteousness, namely
of the righteousness of God through the faith of Christ, where the flesh is
only crucified unto an eternal strength, and yet there are many sufferers:
and therefore it is the voice of all the Saints of God that ever were, are, or
shall be, as one joint acclamation or outcry, written in their hearts for
ever, For thy sake are we killed all the day long (that is, once and for ever)
and are counted as sheep for the slaughter.

We conclude then, that the sufferings of all the Prophets, Seers, or
interpreters of the mind of God, are comprised in our mystical and spiritual
Job, and the patient sufferings of Job, are extended unto, and of an examplary
nature in all the Prophets; that is, of a teaching and leading virtue in every
Saint of God, fit to be imitated, and worthy to be followed of all the rest,
otherwise due honor is not given unto Christ according to the nature and glory
of those inestimable sufferings comprehended in his mystical and royal body
innocent.

But he is carnallized in the doctrine of the Cross, as in all other points,
the world deals with him in the matter of the Gospel.

3. It is taken for granted therefore, in the next place, that the Saints of
God have heard of the patience of Job, or the sufferings of the hated one, as
his name signifies, or one that endures enmity against himself, as it is said
of him whom the world hates even until now Consider him that endures such
contradiction of sinners against himself, least you be weary and faint in your
minds, as knowing it is the portion of him always, in whomsoever he really
appears.

The word translated heard in this place, signifies to know, and that upon such
terms of certainty, as to become one with the thing known, as it is said that
Adam knew Eve his wife, not only to be made one in Contract and Espousall, as
Joseph and Mary were, who yet notwithstanding know not one the other; but to be
made one individual subsistence in their seed, having one form, and one spirit
and life in it, and so the patience of Job: or the sufferings of Job, yea of
Jesus, are known in the Saints of God; that is, they are one entire, simple,
and undivided act in him, and in them also, bearing the same form, containing
the same virtue, subject to the same reproach by the men of the world, as also,
of like joy, and acceptance as of old unto the godly, by whom it is said,
Rejoice greatly O daughter of Zion, shout O daughter of Jerusalem, behold thy
King comes unto thee, he is just saving himself, lowly, and riding upon an
Ass, and upon a colt, the foal of an Ass.

Consider, the word of God brought not forth in the beginning the sun moon, and
stars, or any creature upon the face of the earth, to be of one nature and
virtue in one age of the world, and of another nature and virtue in another
time or age thereof, no more does the word of God bring forth the sufferings of
the Son of God, to be of one kind and virtue in one man of God, and of another
kind, power or virtue in another man of God, or in one age to be really
present with the Disciples, and in another age to be far remote, for they are
all one individual act in that one multiplied Saint or holy one of Israel.

And so are the sufferings of Christ according to the spirit, in the man of
sin, and sons of Beliall, which crucify the Son of God afresh unto, or in
themselves, putting him to an open shame: it is not one in Pharaoh, and another
in Herod; it is not of one nature or kind in Cain, and of another in Judas; it
is not one in the Scribes and Pharasees, and another in the wicked Lawyers and
Soldiers; it is not of one nature and kind io that Antichrist and son of
perdition, and of another nature and kind in the Devil and Satan.

But it is one simple and eternal act of that one man of sin, multiplied into
many Antichrists, which are now working already in the world, according to the
power of the Prince of the air, the spirit which now works in the children
of unbelief, unto which Christ speaks as unto one, saying, what is thy name?
the answer implies both the singular and plural number, my name is Legion, for
we are many.

For we must remember that what soever the law says, it says unto them, or as
the word is, in them who are under the law; that is, whatsoever the law of the
spirit speaks; now the law of the spirit of life is in Christ Jesus, according
to which he submits to the will of his Father (that ancient of days) in all
things, as also rules over all temporary and carnal power; for there is
nothing in Christ as wherein he submits, but it has the virtue of authority
therein also, and whatsoever this law says, it says it in all that are
subjects unto the same, and gives being to what it utters, as the word did to
all things in the beginning; so that if it speak of faith in any, it speaks
without respect of persons according to that impartiality which is in it self:
so that where it utters faith, it is in the powerful work of faith, as a work
wherein the Son of the eternal is involved, in whom it has its virtue and
power: if it utter alone, it sheds it abroad in the heart in the labor of it
as that wherein God dwells, who is composed of it: if it speaks of hope, it is
not deferred, but springs up in the soul as that tree of life in the Paradise
of God: and if it speak of suffering, it creates the Cross, not in any other
form and virtue, but in that wherein it takes its being from the beginning,
even as it was at the first, with the creation in the operation of the word in
bringing forth all creatures to exist and have a being.

When it made the Sun, it formed it in that virtue that abides the same in all
ages; and so it is with all creatures receiving their being and virtue by that
word; even so whatsoever the law of the spirit says, it gives the same being
and virtue thereunto in all that are under that law, whether it concern
humiliation or exaltation, death or resurrection, the being of the Lord the
Savior, or the saved of the Lord.

For what or in whom-soever it speaks, it says it to the reallizing of it
self in the thing spoken, and that without exclusion of any one particular, or
including any one more then the rest, which are found under the same law.

For as unto us there is but one God, so there is but one Image of that God,
which is his wisdom made manifest in Christ, which is the proper and
perpetuated form of Christ, wherein soever he is manifest, and of all true
Christianity in all ages of the world.

We must therefore either take Christ, or a christian form being under the law
of the spirit (and then there is no other seat to set him in, but under the
dominion of the flesh, that law of sin and death) or else the Cross expressed
and maintained according to that law of the spirit is the same in Christ, and
in every Christian in all respects.

For it is that circumcission made without hands; that is, without any wisdom
or ability proper unto, or atainable by man, namely the cutting off of that
superfluous foreskin of the flesh; which is superfluous to the fullness of Gods
wisdom and power, which is the proper hinderer and obstructor of the
propagation of the Son of God.

Therefore this circumcission is to be exercised upon every male in the family
of God (and that by divine institution) that is upon every one who have that
masculine spirit of the Son of God, to acquit themselves like men of God, by
faith, conquering and overcoming the world, for this circumcision only brings
the soul of man into a capacity of having the power of God to be exercised
therein, in which is that fullness and perfection, that all things natural or
proper to a creature, are altogether superfluous, and therefore it is said to
be Circumcision, or cutting round, so as no beginning or end of this virtue can
ever be found out, for it is eternal.

Again, there is also the law of the carnal commandment* or the carnal law,
and whatsoever that speaks, it says it only in them, and in all them
(respectively) that are under that law.

And this consists in carnal and temporary ordinances and institutions, such
appointments as fade and perish in the use, such as abide not with man, or he
not with them for ever; and what this law says, it says it in all and every
particular that are under the same; that is, it reallizeth it self in every
heart wherein it speaks, forming and framing a work therein according to the
word gone out; for she word of God speaks that language in a figure, which man's
heart naturally speaks, taking that (by viewing it by his own light) to be the
substance and reality of the mind of God, in his intent; but is but a shadow,
a figure or signification thereof, thereby carnallizing the word by
transforming it into the similitude of a creature, and not into the glory of
the Creator, so that the imaginations and dictates of his own heart give a
temporary form unto an eternal word, which is that carnal law of sin and
death in himself, subjecting himself thereunto, so that whatsoever the letter
says which kills, it says it in him who is litterall, and has the power of
engagement, and binding that party over to the only acknowledgement, and
practice thereof; and so the word of God becomes a tormentor unto man; for it
being held, or imprisoned in this unrighteousness, or narrow and strait
confines of humane principles and capacity, and yet in it self infinite and
eternal, cannot possible move therein, but must have respect unto its own
nature, which is infinite incomprehensible, and eternal, whereby the soul of
the creature is set upon the rack, hanged on the gibbet, laid under an
intolerable press, cast into the flames, overwhelmed with the floods, being
extended and entangled with that which is infinitely above, as also below and
beneath, and in all respects beyond the reach of all humane abilities, and so
continually devises and frames out more ways of torture and torment unto it
self, then ever man's heart in any tyrant could invent for the shame and
horror of the body.

In which respect that complete condition cease to be the state and
condition, or to be led by the proper principles of a mere creature, or
workmanship of God, and becomes Shedim, as the Caldean phrase is, that is the
destroyer of mankind, in humane and satanicall.

So that the dictates of such a heart are the proper suggestions of Satan, and
its operations, the proper works of darkness, and the only path wherein the
wrath of the Almighty treads for ever.

Note also, that there is in them who are under the law of the spirit, a direct
Antithesis unto this expressed of the wicked.

For the spirit of man being taken into unity with the word, and so gathered up
into the wisdom and power of God, works nor moves not but by principles proper
unto God, which are of an eternal and incomprehensible nature; and yet the
spirit of the creature cannot move, but with respect to the precincts of time,
in which it is, but it goes forth in and by eternal principles, so that there
is in the Son of God distinct operations, yet every one of an eternal nature
and race.

The one giving delight to the work through variety and change of action; and
the other gives liberty, ease, and freedom unto the soul therein, having so
large room and so spacious a sphere to walk and exercise it in, the bounds
whereof can never be trodden out, like the Sun in the firmament whose progress
none can hinder, nor stop, or prevent the health under its wings from the
exercise of it self; nor can any take out of order those fixed stars of the
morning, that fight from such an eminent and noble distance in their courses
for the destruction of this wicked Sisera, even those bright morning stars that
sing together, and sons of God shouting for joy in those Nobles of Israel, in
laying of the first foundation of the earth so as it shall never be removed;
who are as far above the power and dominion of Satan, as the heavens are above
the earth, out of the gunshot of being insisted with any corrupt doctrine, or
of being hurt by any of the tyrannical practices of this present world.

Such is the state and condition of that mystical body of our Lord Jesus, the
dictates of whose heart are the motions of that spirit of holiness and power,
and his operations works of the Son of God.

And of such nature is the law of the spirit which is in Christ Jesus, and of
all such as are under command, and in the authority thereof.

The Saints then, or brethren of our Apostle, know the patience of Job, not at
a distance, but in the nearest conjunction; so as being made one with it, it
being an entire and undivided cross and suffering, and is brought in the next
sentence, viz.

And have seen the end of the Lord.
Under the word seen is comprehended the exercise of all the senses which is
usual in Scripture, as being filled in them all by the Cross and sufferings
of Christ; as if he should say, ye have seen, ye have heard, ye have tasted,
relished and felt the sufferings of Christ, for his name is an ointment poured
out, the sweet savor and scent whereof fills the whole house; so that your
hands have handled the word of life in this point, as really as Thomas handled
the humane body of Christ, when he put his finger into the print of the nails,
which fastened him to his Cross, for the confirmation of his faith; of such
reality is the Cross of Christ, as to make us to see, touch and taste for our
satisfaction the power and virtue of the Lord, otherwise we can never handle
the word of life to minister and serve in the same as Ministers of the
Sanctuary, and as able Ministers of the Gospel, not of the letter, but of the
spirit, for the letter kills, but the spirit gives life.

So that our hearing or knowing of the patience of Job, namely our being one
with Christ in his Cross, alike as we are one with him in any other grace or
virtue, is that which opens unto us the scope of the Scriptures: so that we see
Gods end and aim in blasting unto us all carnal things, is the same that
appeared in Job, to give double in that which never fails; for we never read
of any more loss unto Job, but as though he were enriched for ever.

We see therefore Gods intent and end in the Cross, so as to make it our joy
and consolation, so that we rejoice in persecution, in tribulation, and
reproach, knowing that Gods end herein is only to make his power manifest in
us, for in all these things we are more then conquerours, knowing that our
victory stands both in being the Rescuer, and the rescued: so that the glory
and joy of them both is made one in us, which no earthly Conqueror can
attain. So that our laughter is that spiritull Isaac, the joy of the whole
earth; for howsoever we know our selves (in man's nature simply considered) to
be like Sarah, barren of all the fruits of righteousness, and destitute of
that immortal seed of God, and also our Lord simply considered; to be past
age; for being brought forth and made manifest in time in one that is but of
yesterdays continuance, who in himself is that Ancient of days: Yet the end
and intent of the Lord in the conjunction of these, by visiting of us in that
way of the promise, is the bringing forth of Isaac, according to that time of
life proper to the Son of God, who is the joy and laughter of all that hear
it, so as to approve of it, and give credit thereunto, according to that
unwavering faith of the Father of the faithful, who staggered not.

Therefore the end of this Cross is manifested to be sonship unto God, as it
is said, My son, my son, despise not; that is, honor and embrace the
chastning of the Lord, in the cutting off of all superfluity of naughtiness
which man's nature is subject unto, for the end thereof is that child-like
disposition, being naturalized unto the Lord.

Yea, Gods end herein is to receive and embrace us as his peculiar ones; For
whom the Lord loves he chastneth, and scourges every son whom he receives.

This is that through which we participate in his holiness, and are possessors
of that integrity which is in none but himself.

For he corrects in cutting off all superfluous branches, to this end that
we may be made partakers of his holiness.

Yea, the end of the Cross is to invest us in our filial portion, for if you
endure chastning, God deals with you as sons, for what son is he whom the
father corrects not; and that for this very end, namely to fit him thereby to
exercise and bear up his own spirit, nature, office and authority.

Such is the Lords end and intent in our undergoing of the Cross, to bestow a
double portion on us as he did to Job, which is the proper right of the first
borne of God, appointed by the Law in Israel: For where it is said, the Lord
gave Job twice as much, the word is, Added double: The same phrase is used by
Elisha, where he desires to receive a double portion of the spirit of Eliah, or
that spirit of partition, whereby to divide Jordan aright, as his Master had
done before him; the word properly signifies the mouth exercising the part of
two, which is the spirit of Prophecy considered in a double or twofold
respect; that is, as it contayns the spirit of intercession, in laying open and
interpretting the state and condition of mankind before God from which the
Saints are freed and delivered; as also the laying open before the sons of men
the state and condition of the Son of God, opening and interpretting that to
which we are delivered, both these were in Job; the one signified in his
praying for his friends, that they might be delivered from unrighteousness;
and the other in the names given to his daughters, declaring his present
joyous, and delightful condition. Likewise the spirit of Prophecy is
signified unto us, in that he sees his seed unto the fourth generation; which
number four has in it the mystery of the extension of things, as in the
gathering of the elect from the four winds, or four corners of the earth: so
also in that four times ten, or forty days fast of Christ, his continued act
of obstinance from the ways of sin and death is signified, as in that four
times ten, or forty years travel of Israel in the wilderness, declares the
Saints sight and acknowledgment of the works and ways of the Nations, in all
their performances, to be unto them as a barren, dry, wild and way less
wilderness for ever. Likewise Gods visiting of the fathers upon the children
to the third and fourth generation of them that hate him, is for ever; for whom
he hates once, he hates for ever; which visitation the holy man Job sees his
seed freed from by the spirit of Prophecy in this estate and condition of his
restoration, and eternal enriching by God in way of this double portion.

For as the office of Kingdom and Priesthood are the inheritance of the
firstborn in the family; so also is this double portion in Prophecy, or mouth
performing the part of twain; that is, he has the mouth to perform the part
of the son of (Man) namely in exercise of the spirit of God in interpretting
and laying open the state and condition of all flesh, and by the virtue and
authority of the high Priest of God, which is done not unto terror, grief, or
controversy, but unto peace, joy, and reconciliation with God, as one that is
entered within the vale.

And thus the mouth and breath of prayer is opened and drawn out with boldness
before the Lord at the throne of grace, as coming in that name and authority of
Jesus Christ, who is a Priest for ever after the order of Melchisedech.

Again, in this double portion is the mouth of the Son of of God exercised
as from heaven, opening and interpreting unto the world the mind of the Father
in that state and condition of Jesus Christ, freely offering and making tender
of the love, bounty, good will, and mercy of God unto the Saints; and this is
done in that Princely spirit, and bounteous riches and liberality consisting in
the power and authority of a King, which things are comprehended in the right
of the first born, and are the portion of Job in this his restoration, wherein
we see the end of the Lord, and in whom the state of all the Saints is
personate and involved, and no other end is aimed at, or effected by God in all
the sufferings of the Saints, but to give in exchange for transitory and vain
things, an inheritance mortal and undefiled, which fades not, reserved for us
in heaven, or in the height of of that estate and condition of the Son of God.
For the confirmation whereof, he brings in that argument propounded in the next
place, which is the fourth point.

For the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.
To pity, spare, or to be indulgent, is to refrain from imposing any penalty
or, burden, it is to forbear to vex in the least; even as not in pitying or
sparing a person or a people, is to execute destruction to the uttermost; This
pity is exercised in the spirit of Christianity, and of Christ, as when the
son of sorry man is acknowledged to be such, as there needs no other weight
but his own proper propensity, to cast himself down unto death for ever; nor
any other subtilty but his own to entrap and ensnare him unto the will of Satan
for ever, then only do the compassions and pity of a father move upon that
heart, so as to add no sorrow thereunto.

Again, to pity or commiserate, is to redeem, release, and deliver from
whatsoever might annoy or disquiet the party which is subject to distress;
therefore it is said, that in his love and pity he redeemed them, and bare
them (as out of the reach of any harm) all the days of old.

So that when the heart declineth the help of all creatures, as insufficient to
lend a hand from any of their proper abilities to help or rescue out of
trouble, and that wretchedness whereunto all flesh is by nature subject; then
does the pity and compassion of a father, as being author of all tenderness
and compassion, move upon that soul, effecting Gods end by suffering of the
loss of the ability and power of the creature: For when Job abhorred himself,
as being but dust and ashes, then the Lord stirs up himself to release him not
only from the bitterness of his friends, but repayrs all his losses with the
right and privileges of the firstborn of God. Such is the tenderness and
pity of the spirit of our good Shepherd, gathering the Lambs into his arms,
and carrying them in his bosom, and gently leads such as are with young, yea
lays down his life for his flock: And this is the state and condition of all
such as find themselves fatherless in respect of any love, pity, or
compassion exercised toward them by the spirit of the world, of whom it is
said, Ashur shall not save us, we will not ride upon horses, neither will we
say any more to the works of our hands, ye are our gods, for in thee the
fathers find mercy.

For he is not only pitiful, but of tender mercy, whereby the day that
springs from on high has visited us: Or that morning Sun which is the light
and glory of the world is risen up upon us, to give light to such as otherwise
fit in darkness and in the shadow of death, even that light of prosperity, joy
and gladness, peace and plenty, which arises out of the light and inheritance
of the firstborn, unto whom the full inheritance belongs, with whatsoever the
Father was, is, or shall be, in all his enterprises and operations.

For the nature, office, and operation of the Son of God is ours, through these
tender mercies, bowels, and compassions of a Father which cannot withold from
an only Son, not only freeing us as a merciful high Priest, from all evil and
sin, but as a most bountiful and liberal King, supplying and furnishing us
with all good; for if we see the end of the Lord in our suffering the loss of
corruptible things, we are sure to feel the tender mercies of a compassionate
Father, communicating himself with us in all the things incorruptible and
eternal, without which he is not, and therefore is ceased to be mercy and
tender pity in the world, that so as a Father is in his Son, he may be what he
is only in us: Whereupon he brings in an eminent and universal prohibition,
backed with an exhortation, together with the danger of not observing the same,
contained in the next verse.

Verse. 12. But above all things my brethren swear not, neither by heaven,
neither by the earth, neither by any other oath; but let your yea be yea, and
your nay nay, lest you fall into condemnation.
Wherein observe these particulars.
1. The necessity and weight of the charge, in these words; But above all
things. 2. A loving insinuation to move unto observation; My brethren. 3. The
charge it self, or inhibition; Swear not. 4. An instance in particulars not to
be sworn by, that is 1. Not by heaven. 2. Not by the earth. 3. A universal
comprehending of all things contained in them both; Neither by any other oath.
5. An exhortation consisting of affirmation and negation; But let your yea be
yea, and your nay, nay. 6. The danger ensuing the not observing hereof; Lest
you fall into condemnation.
AND first of the charge, Swear not. By swearing in this place is meant any
Covenant, Contrract, or betrothing unto a thing, as to be engaged as subservant
thereunto; that is, when we are obliged and bound over, as being under the
authority or command of any thing further then it is found in, or serving unto
the completing and setting forth the mystical body of Christ, that son of
eternity.

Now a man is under the command and power of a thing, when he waits thereupon,
so as to observe and answer to the time and opportunity thereof. In the
rejection or neglect of any other thing, which might take up the opportunity,
and hinder or obstruct the time, whereby that his Commander might be defrauded
of its interest in him, whether it be office, dignity, alliance, relation,
slothfulness, or operation.

And first for office and dignity throughout the confines and government of a
Kingdom, they ought not to captivate a Christian, but must be subservant to
the kingdom and call of Christ, whose kingdom is not of this world, or things
thereof.

When did Abraham that high father of the world, Isaac and Jacob, who were
heyrs with him of the same promise, settle and establish their Scepter in any
part of the earth, as tied by place and office there, and were not as pilgrims
and strangers, standing in readiness as that righteous one of the East, to
answer Gods calls, and to follow the Lord at his foot, who made the nations as
stubble unto his sword, and as driven stubble unto his bow.

Or where did Moses, King in Jeshurunn, pitch his Tent to make his abode longer
then it pleased that cloud of witness to exercise its abode upon the Tent,
being ever ready to depart with the motion thereof.

Which bore witness in its two and forty removals in the wilderness, to those
two and forty generations, or resurrections of Christ, from Abraham to the womb
of the Virgin, as also to the over-shadowing of the Virgin by the spirit of
God, in that conception of the Son of God, from all the scorching reys and
sunshine of man's glory and subtlety in that daytime of our salvation; as also
unto that fiery light of the spirit breaking forth in Israel, through that
Cross of Christ, as in a night so dark and obscure unto the nations.

And to what people or places were any of the Prophets of God, or Apostles of
Jesus Christ tied, or engaged, by any temporary or terrene band, except
imprisonment by the adversary, that so the virtue of the Cross in its courage,
constancy, and Princely resolutions, might appear and make it self evident.

Or were the Judges and Law givers in Israel tied to days, times, seats, and
circuits, as men making merchandises of men's estates, credits and lives, that
in case an Oath be bidden and given in exchange, delivery must be made without
controversy; and many times the cause is as current, as when the strongest
caries away the purse on the high way, though a possibilty may be to find out
the falsehood of the oath afterward, when there is left no hope of redemption:
And as for that mercinary and belly-god-like bond, to be engaged to places and
people under the names of Pastor and Teacher, to evade the troubles and travels
of Prophets and Apostles. Let that suffice which has already been said, only
let such look themselves as in a glass, in that young man of the house of
Judah, and yet a Levite, joined unto their congregations, as he to the family
of Mica. Read Judge. 17. and let them read the effect of their Ministry in that
strange kind of Levite, who is of mount Ephraim, joined unto his Concubine of
Bethlehem Juda, according to what it brings forth between Benjamine and Israel,
set forth unto us, Judges the 19. and 20. Chap.

Again, in point of family, as in kindred and relations, the words of Christ
holds firm, and are to be valued at the same rate we set upon him: and he
says, He that for sakes not father and mother, wife and children for my sake
and the Gospel, is not worthy of me.

And again, He that hates not father and mother, wife and children, brethren
and sisters, yea and his own life also, he cannot be my Disciple. The reason
hereof is, because all natural relations brought unto the highest pitch which
they tend unto, is to idolize the thing, by setting it in the place of God,
requiring a due respect and observation thereof in the neglect or contempt of
what ever might hinder the promoting thereof, which cannot stand with a due
observation and respect of that relation, as it is ordered and eternized in
Christ, but must make a nullity of it; for the coming of Christ in all things
is glory to God in the highest, and not to the things of the creature.

When the man called by Christ, desired first to go and bury his father, that
the earthly relation may have chiefty, and come in the first place, Christ
answers, Let the dead bury their dead, follow thou me; intimating that these
relations are dead, and are to be buried unto us in the call and relation of
Christ.

For Christ is about his Fathers business; not when he attends on Joseph and
Mary, but when he is disputing and convincing the Doctors of the carnal Temple
at Jerusalem.

But earthly relations in their proper intent (without which the life of it is
let out) ever set themselves in the first place; for what is a Husband or a
Wife, unless they make each other the highest pitch of their love, which is
the pointed up pinnacle, which the Devil sets Christ upon according to the
flesh, wherein the strength of his temptations consists; and where it takes, it
is the presumptuous sin, which our spirituali David is freed from; for who
dares not to love wife and children to the highest point thereof, without fear
of sinning, being the proper sinew to ^ye them together, and the lifeblood in
the veins, to give motion and agility in all conjugall respects, making each
other the object of desires, hopes, observation, diligence, care and motion,
that nothing, no not life it self shall hinder, or be thought too dear to
maintain the credit, comfort, and well-being of one another.

And here it is to be noted, that when the Scriptures take up any of the
Creatures in their nature, relation, operation, or in any respect, it is not
done but with respect unto the wisdom and spirit of man, for whose use all
things were made and are, and that to declare thereby either the mystery of
God, or the mystery of iniquity, or both.

And that allusion cannot be of a capacity to signify unto us the mind of God
wrapped up therein (whether a thing terrible to nature or lovely) unless we
extend it unto the farthest point which it intends or inclines after, and that
is Satanicall; as for example, when it takes up a Lion to express it self by,
a Dragon, Tiger, Wolf, Leopard, Bear, Fox, or Serpent, we must look unto the
proper pursuit of the creature to the utmost extent of his disposition and
practice; which being centred in man as the scope and intent of all Gods works,
it must be found there in the greatest cruelty, subtilty, and tyranny, which is
no less then the Devil, that roaring Lion, seeking whom he may devour.

Again, when it takes up lovely relations, as Husband to wife, and wife to
Husband, Father to son, and son to Father, we must carry them unto that point
which nature depraved pursues in this world (For in the Kingdom of God there
is neither marrying nor giving in marriage) and then it idolizeth the party
beloved, sets it in the place of God, and so becomes an idolatrous affection,
yea it is that love of the world which is enmity with God, having the spirit of
the Serpent in it, and therefore to be hated.

For it swears and engages unto the things of this world, contrary to the
charge of our Apostle given in this place; and so is a true metaphor, and in
way of dissimilitude, or antithesis, holds direct proportion with the things of
God, and so fitly sets out the nature of the love of God in the Saints.

Whose temporary relations, or lives are not dear unto them for the cause of
Christ, in mayntaining those that are real and eternal in him: and in this
true sense of the height and intent of them, are all hated for Christ, and no
bond at all to hinder them in their course in the promulgation of the Gospel.

For where find we any of the Prophets or Apostles of Christ entangled with
wife or children, friends or famlies, as a tie to hinder them in the pursuit of
the things of God. Indeed the Apostle says, Have not we power to eat and to
drink, to lead about a sister, a wife, and power not to work as other
Apostles, brethren of the Lord, or in brother hood of that Lordship over all
things: Yet did they practice or desist in doing, or not in doing these things,
only as the progress and propagation of the Gospel might be furthered and
promoted thereby.

But it is the policy and practice of the world to adjure and conjure things so
together by humane ties and bonds, knowing that all carnal relations fly for
refuge unto a Diabolical engagement, even as every spiritual relation flies to
that bond and oath of God.

For thereby the spirit of the world sets persons and places together, to claym
mutual interest to the neglect and vilifying of that bond of the spirit which
is in Christ, prostrating themselves to the service and use merely of each
other.

But the doctrine of Christ says on this wise; Ye have heard that it has
been said of old, thou shall not for swear thy self; but I say unto you,
swear not at all; that is, take not an engagement upon thee, so as to submit
unto, or be at the service and command of any thing whatsoever; that is, not
the proper state, place, office, relation, operation, or condition, as it is
founded in Christ, or conducing thereunto.

By which, and in whom we are made Lord of all things, and so subject to none
besides him alone: For of him, and through him, and for him are all things, and
to him the glory of all appertains and belongs.

Therefore it is, That the sabbath is made for man, and not man for the
sabbath, for the son of man is Lord of the sabbath. And hence it is that it
is said, that the woman was made for the man, and not the man for the woman;
that is, all things more weak and effeminate, whatsoever they be, are made to
be subject, and of the service of that masculine spirit of the man of God, and
not the man of God to be subject to any thing which has not the strength and
authority of the Son of God in it.

Now in that Christ was not made an high Priest but by an oath, and yet gives
strict charge not to swear at all; we are to consider wherein an oath does
consist, which the Apostle to the Hebrews describes in a twofold respect, that
is, the oath of God, and the oath of men. The oath of men is never taken in the
way of Christ, but without the oath of God he exists not; the oath of God is
never taken in the way of Antichrist, but without the oath of man he never was.

And first for the oath of God, we are to consider the speech of the Apostle,
where he says; That when God made or built the promise in Abraham, because
there was not a greater to swear by, he swore by himself; where he
transforms the promise into the oath, making them as one thing.

1. For the Promise of God, the Covenant of God, and the Oath of God, are but
one entire act or state of the Son of God, only differ in variety and real
distinction of glory. The promise being Gods voluntary and free tender of
himself in Christ, together with man's acceptance in a voluntary and free
return of thankfulness: It is in God voluntary without compulsion, free
without any restraint in himself, or desert in man; It is the tender of
himself, else could not have in it the bounty and benignity of God.

And it is accepted by man in a thankful acknowledgment thereof in Christ,
which is voluntary, without compulsion; for the Son of God is not compelled to
acknowledge the bounteous liberality of the Father, and it is free without
restraint of himself, for he makes a complete surrender of himself unto God,
and without any desert in God; as considered in the vilification of the spirit
in the men of the world, wherein is no desert, or thanks worthy at all but in
himself, and exaltation of the same spirit in Christ, most worthy of all
renown and acknowledgements, as the author and giver of all things.

Even as the unworthiness of man consists in that state of the exaltation of
the flesh in the man of sin, or men of the world, but as it is submitted unto
God in Christ: so the man Christ is he, to whom of due desert every knee shall
bow, and tongue confess the worth and dignity of that Lord Jesus the man of
God, and Savior of the world.

2. Again, for the Covenant of God, it is a mutual and conjugall engagement of
God and man in the faith of Christ, whereby they become mutually and
reciprocally at the service and use of each other, for therein is that speech
made good and fulfilled; The man has not power of his own body, but the woman,
neither has the woman power of her own body but the man, God vouchsafing unto
the Son of man all that help and glorious supply that is in himself, and man
bringing forth, and making manifest in himself all those glorious excellencies
and virtues which are in the Son of God, and so is due benevolence given with
respect unto all conjugall duties appertaining and belonging unto that holy
Covenant and Contract in that Espousall of Christ Jesus the Son of God.

3. The oath of God is the immutability and unchangeable condition of this
estate of our spiritual Abraham, taken into the promise and hopeful
expectation of God; taken into the Covenant and present enjoyment of God; taken
into the oath of confirmation, and unchangeable estate and condition of the Son
of God, wherein it is impossible that ever God should fail or forget himself,
as not to abide and remayn the same, so that he swears by himself, wherein
Abraham is a party, else it cannot be an engagement, and so is involved in the
same condition with God; for where it is said (God swear by himself) it is
word for word, If I bless thee not; that is, if thou be not blessed, I am not
blessedness my self: Therefore he says, Surely in blessing I will bless
thee, and multiplying, I will multiply thee; that is, if I be blessed, then
thou art the same; if I be multiplied in my virtues and excellencies, then thou
also art and do the same.

Note from hence, that a Christian and God-like oath, never swears by a thing
greater then he that swears; for if he do, he divides himself from Christ,
divorcing himself from God in falsifying the Covenant, in adulterating that
holy and perpetuated bond.

And therefore he adds the oath of man to be such as swears by a greater then
himself, which is to make God and man to be two estates and conditions, which
is that which has ever made a nullity of Christ (who is one) and holds the
soul in a state of unbelief, and is properly that oath which God swears in
the way of his wrath, which excludes men from ever entering into his rest; in
the one man is in the oath, but no cause original of the unity and contract
between God and man; and in the other, God is a party in the oath, but no cause
or original of that breach or separation from God, exclusion out of the land
of the living, or undergoing of wrath: The one is the shutting of the gate of
heaven unto the world by that close and undivided estate of God and man, being
the same condition; the other opens the grave for the Rebels in the
wilderness, that Hades, and state of death, by separating God and man from
being the same existence, and so ever look after a greater then themselves; for
the obtaining of whom, they return back in their hearts into Egypt, seeking
shelter and protection in the power and authority of the arm of flesh,
exercising it self in the men of the world.

It stands the world upon therefore to maintayn engagements between creature
and creature, as the intent of the word of God, and so in all things to have a
respect to one greater then themselves, which must be another, and not their
condition, which is the only strengthening of the arm of flesh, and buckling of
the joints of the kingdom of darkness together, to become their only refuge.

Even as it does the Saints of God, to maintayn God and man to be one and the
same condition in Christ, in the knitting together of that mystical body of
Christ, in the perfect supply of every part unto a perfect man, and so make
that undefiled and all-sufficient Son of God the only place of their refuge.

The oath of man is framed by the wisdom of man, and is the very top and
pinnacle of his prefermens and perfection.

And the oath of God is framed by the wisdom of God, being the masterpiece of
his work, the beginning or head of his Creation.

The wisdom of God is his counsel held, or advice taken with frail man,
arguing from cause to effect, and from effect to cause, concluding both in one
individual act and being; the result properly springing out of divine nature
which comprehends all times, concluding man together with it self in the same
condition, and that upon such undeniable principles, as carry in them the bond
of an oath of the most highest and most eminent nature, which the Apostle calls
the oath of interposition, because that in this state of Christ he comes
between the blessing and the curse, in such sort that nothing of true
happiness can possibly pass by, or transfuse it self into the cursed
condition; for the virtue and excellencies springing out of divine nature,
being the glory of the engagement, all things tending to happiness repayr
thither, and gather themselves into one there, even as all light is gathered
into the body of the Sun, and is all the seal and signet of God to confirm all
true happiness to take its beginning and make its abode there for ever, being
an immutable thing or word abundantly declared in all the heyrs of the promise.

Again, the wisdom of man is that counsel held, and advice taken with the
excellency of God, arguing from cause to effect, and from effect unto cause,
ever concluding a distance in the one from the other, the result properly
springing out out of man's nature and aptitude, which mouldeth things in the
precincts of time, and concluding God to be concerned in the thing, as being
the cause of all cause, and so argues a distance between the cause and the
effect, God being before as the cause, and his word afterward as an effect;
the divine nature in Christ, before from eternity, the humane after in time:
but the Gospel is a mystery, and such argument is natural and humane, to make
God eternal, and man in time: but the Gospel eternizeth man in God, and makes
God in time, in the son of man.

2. This wisdom argues a distance in place, of cause and effect, as the virtue
of our salvation is in Christ as a cause, being only such a person as lived in
such an age of the world only, but the effect is in a Christian, being another,
which is a mere humane speculation, and no mystery of the Gospel.

3. Again, it argues a distance in point of eminency, and principality, as the
cause being more principal, and the effect less principal, as though the
birth and bringing forth of the Son of God in the royalty of his operations,
were not a thing of like worth and dignity that the conception and framing of
him is, according to that pattern of the law of the spirit, seen only in the
Mount.

So that this wisdom arises from, and carries in it principles undeniable to
keep a distance and loof between God and man, and therein the point of unbelief
consists, which is the state of death, in which the son of God is made a curse
in the men of the world, as man is made a blessing in the Son of God in Christ:
and this also is an oath of interposition; for hereby the Son of God being made
a curse for us, interposeth himself between the curse and the blessed state:
So as nothing bearing the nature of a curse, sin, death, or any unhappiness
can pass by, or defuse it self into that happy state and condition of Christ;
but all attracts it self unto that which has so vilified and made a nullity
of the Son of God: and this is an immutable word or thing, even the word and
state of the curse which abides for ever, which God explains and makes
manifestly to appear unto the heyrs of Promise, which stand upon this ground of
the impossibility of God, to lie or fail to remayn and be for ever, that which
once he is without alteration or change; therefore in these two immutable words
of blessing and cursing, or immutable things of the state of death and the
state of life, God has founded our salvation, that we might have strong
consolation, as the Apostle testifies.

And this wisdom or reason of man is as a seal to confirm the soul in its
separation and deverse from Christ, being that signet the high Priests and
Pharisees set upon the stone which covers the Sepulcher of Christ, and keeps
him in the state of death in the men of unbelief, that his glorious
resurrection is not found in the men of the world from the beginning thereof
unto this day, and is a principal product of the Schools of humane Learning;
for the more refined reason is void of the spirit of God, and the closer tied
to Grammar-rule, in constructing the word of God, the more are such sealed up
in the word of the Curse, so that you shall seldom see a great Artist embrace
the simplicity of the Gospel in that Cross of Christ.

And with respect to the oath of man, Christ says in a word for ever to be
observed, Swear not at all; which our Apostle accords with in this place,
saying, Above all things my brethren swear not.

Note from hence, that he which holds himself under a greater bond to utter
truth, having taken the oath of men, then he is without the same, who never
knew what the power and virtue of the oath of God is.

And if the weightinesse of a cause require an oath, and not required in a
thing of less moment then men hold the preaching of the word of God, either to
be but a trivial thing; or else why do they not tender an oath to the Minister
when he goes about to speak thereof.

Note again, that as men hold themselves under a greater bond have taken the
oath of man, then they are without it; even so when they are invested into
offices and places thereby, they account and reckon of themselves as being
better, and of greater account and esteem then others of their brethren, the
sons of men.

To conclude this point, wide is the difference between the oath of God and the
oath of man; the one forms and sets in place and office the Son of God, the
other forms and officiates the son of perdition.

The one swears the Lord lives in him, in truth, in judgment, and in
righteousness, and only glories therein, and the other swears the Lord to be
another thing, state, and condition besides himself; the one swears with
Jacob, by the fear of his Father Isaac, reverencing the state of Isaac to be
one with God as Abraham was, and the other swears by the God of his Father
Nahor the idolater, who ever worships that which is acknowledged to beanother,
and not himself.

The Saints are ever to swear in the name and authority of God, but never to
swear by the oath of men; the world ever swears in the name and authority of
men, but never in that name and authority of the Son of God.

2. The weight of the charge therefore is to be considered in the next place in
these words, above all things swear not; We conclude then, that it is a thing
of greatest worth and weight in Heaven or in earth, never to swear by the oath
of men, but to receive our authority and confirmation in all things by the
wisdom of God, and not by the wisdom of the world, for the one invests as a
son into the Preisthood, and way of reconciliation of, God and man; and the
other as a slave and vassal of Satan sets in the state of death, cruelty and
wrath, in the separation from God; therefore of greater weight and concernment
then all things besides.

3. Consider the term he gives them, my brethren; as if he should say in more
words, except ye be of my fraternity; that is, of the proper off spring and
brotherhood of the Son of God (flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bone) ye
will never yield over your selves unto this inhibition, nor observe this charge
given by God, for none but the offspring of God will disingage themselves from
the language of this world framed and contrived according to the reasonings
thereof in the wisdom of man, no more then there is any to be found but the
seed of the Serpent that will disingage, disjoynt, and dislocate themselves
from the language and oracle of God, contrived and uttered by that wisdom of
God in Christ; prove your selves therefore by this, whether you be the brethren
of Christ, belonging to one and the same Father, possessors of the same
inheritance, for otherwise no heirship of heaven, no share in the tender
compassions of a father, no virtue nor grace of the spirit, no crown of life
laid up, only for them that wait for, and love the reality of Christ's
appearing, in the vanishing and not appearing of all corruptible things at the
brightness of his glory alone, in what thing, relation, or act soever they may
seem to stand in, unto us, so as not to be engaged unto any of them; for
explanation whereof he gives an instance what we are not to swear by; first
particularly, and then universally

1. And first, we are not to swear by heaven: By Heaven, or height, as the word
imports in this place, is meant Principalities, powers, dominions, the rulers
of the darkness of this world, which the Apostle styles spiritual
wickedness, or wicked spirits in high, or in heavenly places, such as are
eminent and glorious in the eyes of men, according to the judgment of humane
wisdom: now the Saines of God are not to swear by any of these; for however
the oath of man swears by the greater, yet the oath of God which is only upon
the Saints of Israel cannot be by a greater then himself, so that he is not
engaged to any of these, but all are subservant unto him, and he is above them
all, for he is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, as it is written upon his
vesture, and upon his thigh or joines, as in his strength and ornaments of his
power and authority it does appear, therefore Christ gives the reason why we
are not to swear by Heaven, because says he, it is the throne of God: Now the
throne is at the service of him who fits thereon, and not he to be engaged to
the throne: so that the Principallities and powers of worldly Governments, are
the very thrones or chariots, wherein the Son of God sits for the excecution of
his wrath on the world, and they all stand engaged to be at his service, as
that proper matter, and instrument, wherein the wrath of the Son is kindled,
and executed.

For there is a throne whereon Christ sits to rule with a rod or scepter of
Iron, wherewith he breaks to pieces as the sheards of a potters vessel, as well
as there is a great white throne, that from the presence of him that sits
thereon, this heaven and earth which are not to be sworn by, do fly away, and
no place for them (in that dominion) is to be found.

For Ashur is the rod or scepter of his anger, and the staff in their hand is
his indignation; unto these high places the Saint of Israel is not to be
engaged, for they are all subservant unto him; and thence it is that
Nebuchadnezzar that great King performed that piece of service to Daniels
friends, for the destruction of such as were his immediate actors therein, for
the manifestation of a miraculous deliverance through the appearance of the Son
of God in his powerful presence with his people, when as they would not swear,
or be engaged to the authority and power of that high place, or great King; the
like was in Pharaoh, whose wrath Moses feared, not because he saw him who is
unseeable; and in Herod whom Christ looked upon as a Fox fitter to betake
himself to the holes of the earth in his carnal power and policy, then to
hinder him in that work the wisdom of the father of lights had prescribed
him; in the doing of which work he denies his mother to have any interest in
him, in that way of the earth, saying, Women, what have I to do with thee, my
hour is not yet come; that is, my time is not to come under any carnal
command, or authority whatsoever.

Note in this point how contrary the practice of the common ministry of the
world is, in seeking to be engaged unto earthly power, as to sit under that
shadow and protection, as their only defense, having confidence therein, as
though there were no other safety; so that if they can but stand (with
acceptance) by the elbow of a great man, and watch for a nod, or a beck, to
signify a permission to give thanks, pray, or to preach, they count it their
chief honor and happiness, and take it for a proper inspiration of the spirit
unto them, and so it is of that spirit whereby they are led.

2. The second particular by which we are not to swear, is the earth; Neither
by the earth: The word translated (earth) signifies a base degenerate stock,
such as in the judgment of man are as persons illegitimate, not being borne or
brought forth unto the excellency, and desired privilege of the Sons of men
in, and of the world.

These we are not to be engaged unto, or to swear by, whether in respect of the
state and condition of persons, or of any thing base in the worlds account; the
Saint of Israel is not to be taken as bound over, or engaged unto these things,
as for their defense, government, supply, relief, release, or redemption and
deliverance in any respect, so as to be required, and laid claim unto by the
world, as their right due, or as a debt from his hands, no more then Satan can
lay claym unto any thing that is in Christ; for the Son is free from paying
tribute unto the world in all the children of the kingdom, only as time,
place, necessity, occasion, convenience, and expediency gives and frames a
fitness and opportunity thereunto; so do the Saints act, or refrain from
acting in all things which the spirit of the world ingageth it self unto, as
being bound and yet most free; that is, they are all firmly bound over in
themselves for the liberty and propagating of the Gospel of God, and they are
free likewise from whatsoever is out of that state and condition of the Son
of God, from yiedling any tribute, or being any way so engaged, as that it
should make any true challenge, or lay any claym or title unto them, no more
then that rich man could lay claym to the service of Lazarus so much as to
bring him one drop of water to cool his tongue.

Christ renders a reason why we are not to swear by the earth, namely, because
it is Gods footstool; so the enemies of Christ are said to be made his
footstool, by the Psalmist; for as the powers of the world are as the throne
for the exercise of Gods displeasure, so in the exercise and execution thereof,
they are trodden down under his feet, as such as are of base condition and
offspring whereon his feet are set, as being victour and conqueror of them for
ever, therefore the promise is, Thou shall tread upon the Lion, and the adder,
the young Lion and the Dragon shall thou trample under feet.

3. In the third place, the prohibition is of universal extent, comprehending
all things contained in this heaven and earth as is described, in which heaven
the actions, relations, and constitutions are multiplied, as the heavenly
bodies in the visible heavens are, in their constitutions, motions, operations,
and respects, which are innumerable.

The things of the earth also, in their several forms, kinds and virtues are
all comprehended in these words, Neither by any other oath; the world therefore
in its exalted and trodden upon estates and conditions, are as full of variety
in the one and in the other, and with respect to each other, as the heavens and
the earth are, which are here elegantly alluded unto, and yet true Christianity
is free from being engaged to any thing. (it self only excepted) not
consisting of any nor of all them; for the Son of God not having a greater
swears by himself, and is engaged to none besides; the spirit and life of true
religion is engaged to nothing but it self, and unto that upon oath wherever
it appears.

And pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father, is to visit the
fatherless and the widow (according to their necessities) and to keep our
selves unspotted of the world; that is, it gives out it self and yields
sufficient supply only to the fatherless, namely to such as are cut off from
that race and stock of the men of the world, and so are without father, as
Melchizedech is, and ever was, and will be, and in that respect the Prophet
says, For with thee the fatherless they find mercy, who are not propagated,
and borne of flesh, nor of blood, nor of the will of man, but of God, for that
which is borne of the flesh is flesh, but that which is borne of the spirit is
spirit.

The state of the widow also religion supplies and is engaged unto as to it
self, whose covenant and contract with the things of this life is broken, and
altogether dissolved, and made void, who are come to that age and gravity of
the Gospel, as of threescore years and past, that is past bringing forth
according to the wisdom of the flesh, who are such widows that bring forth in
that kind, as the Apostle says, wax wanton and will marry; that is, enter into
contract and engagements with the things of the world through their divorce
from Christ; Religion is in no sort obliged unto such, but only to the modesty
and gravity of the former.

And therefore it is said, to keep it self unspotted of the world, it makes it
self immaculate and undefiled, by the estranging of it self from the proper
operation of that spirit of the world in all things; for it neither eats nor
drinks, marries, nor yet gives in marriage upon the same grounds and principles
which the men of the world do, in so much that Christianity is that Virgin-like
Espousall which conceives and brings forth by that spirit of purity not found
elsewhere but only in it self, which the world stumbles at more then Joseph
did at Mary, before God resolved his doubt, when he concluded to put her away,
and to have no fellowship with her, which all the world not taught of God
proceed unto, concerning the Saints of God, as engaged thereunto by that spirit
of uncleanesse, whereupon our Apostle brings in the next point.

But let your yea be yea, and your nay nay.
That is, whatsoever you acknowledge your selves to be engaged unto affirming
it to be yea, let that engagement be acknowledged to be always, and in all
things the same without denial thereof in any thing whereinsoever it may be
concerned: as for instance; if ever you were engaged to God and nothing else,
as men for the most part acknowledge traditionally they were in the creation of
the first man Adam; or if you acknowledge that hereafter you shall be engaged
only to him and no other if you cannot make this yea; that is, to be always
the same without any negation at all, it is not the confession of faith, no
true profession of Jesus Christ, yea it must be concluded upon, and acknowledge
both in the preter, present, and future tence, or else it is not pure religion
and undefiled before God even the Father, because otherwise it is not the
engagement of the Son of God in whom alone all purity does consist; for if any
thing, at any time, or time it self, for one moment, interpose between God and
man, between the Father and the Son, it is not that unity and faith of the Son
of God who never admits of any time, or any thing to interpose between the
Father and himself, in that subsisting unity of his.

2. This exhortation is laid down in way of negation, let your nay be nay; that
is, if ever you find a time wherein you deny your self to be engaged to
Satan, either in your creation, or in Gods determination, or if ever you expect
a time, or way, and means wherein and whereby you shall be disingaged unto him,
and that fully and perfectly, then let your nay be nay; that is, let it be
resolved upon that you were never engaged unto him, neither are, nor ever shall
be at no time, nor in any respect, else it is not that disingagement of the
Son of God; for Satan never came to find any thing in him, bearing the least
tincture of his nature, or that held any correspondency with that evil one in
any respect.

But I cannot but wonder many times, when I think of that profession of Christ
which is made in the world, which for the most part is of such things as
themselves cannot but acknowledge were never found in Christ, as ignorance,
pride, error, absence from God, self-love, enmity, disobedience, unbelief,
and the like, at the least the relics and remaynders of these to reside in the
state of Christianity, not knowing that these things are to be confessed, upon
that condition wherein the Son of God is transformed by the world unto, and
in it self another thing then by nature he is, in which confession there is
the virtue of transmission of all sin and unrighteousness into its proper
place, even as in the acknowledgment of the righteousness of God, it is to be
transmitted into the state and condition of Christ, or else it is not an
acknowledgment and confession of faith.

And so sin is confessed upon the head of the Scapegoat to be carried into the
wilderness which is desolate and way less unto the people of God; neither is
he nor it that is the goat, nor the sin in that true respect found in Israel
any more, and so sin it set on its probase and place of its perpetual abode
not only in time to come, but past also; that is, in Babylon, in the land of
Shyner, the place of confusion; wherein note, that the strictest order composed
by the wisdom of man (which is in truth and substance consonant to the letter
of the Scripture) men being tied thereunto as a rule to walk by, is that proper
confusion of Babell unto a Christian unity, because it makes man the
forerunner, and not the Lord Christ, who only enters within the vale, where
the true oracle is uttered even as it is true, that when the will of God
according to the law of the spirit, is the most distinctly made manifest, it
appears to be the only confusion in a carnal mind, because it lays wast those
proper principles whereby it adorns it self with all its ornaments.

Note here, how necessary it is for man's wisdom to moderate it self in the
making of Laws, and binding men under penalties to take them as rules for all
to walk by.

And here we propound a question, whether one Law of God be not of like weight
as another? for that distinction of the first Table being more eminent then the
second, is merely humane; for does not Christ center both in two commands, and
affirms them to be of like weight: and the Apostles bring all into one, saying,
love fulfils the whole law: So that the two Tables do teach unto us the unity
of God and man, and that both according to the letter of the Law, and also of
the spirit, and therefore the Law is broken by Moses at the foot of the Mount,
as considered in the Leviticall Priesthood, exercised in the Rebels in the
wilderness, and the Law is preserved and kept by Moses in the Arc unto this
day as the Scripture affirms, as it is exercised in that way of the Spirit, in
Joshuah or Jesus, who leads into the land as that Captain of our salvation.

But however the question stands concerning strictness of Law in two commands
of the second Table, which are of the same weight and importance to every
Christian, the one as the other, and that is the not killing, but preservation
of life, and the not committing of adultery in the preservation of chastity.

Is there not then a like care to be had, and provision made for the
preservation of life, in respect of its existance and being, as there is to
preserve chastity, that so man may appear in honor and temperancy.

If there be a like care to be had in both, then I demand how it comes to
pass, that men make a law to execute death upon that fact of adultery, which
reaches unto the very Embryon, and unformed substance of man in the womb, that
so they may prevent a Bastard-like brood, and that impure and incontinent
conversation of men in the world.

Why are they not alike careful to ordain and execute a law upon men, in case
man and wife know each other, when there is no possibility of conception,
whereby the life of man seems to be destroyed and cut off, as considered in the
very same capacity and principles, and so upon the like ground murder committed.

This case may seem to be the very point of Christ's argument brought forth by
his practice against the Scribes and Pharisees, who stood so strictly upon the
letter of Moses writing, when they brought that woman taken in adultery unto
him; who in pretending the fulfillment of the Law, out of a malicious spirit
seek to ensnare the Son of God, to kill him, and put him to death, which
murdering litterall spirit of theirs he convicts them of, and acquits the
woman, in that double act of his, in writing on the earth, having respect unto
the writing of the two Tables of stone, signifying unto them that killing
letter bearing sway in themselves, whereby they sought to take away his life,
rather then the woman's, by putting the force and dignity of the Law to stand in
carnal and fleshly observance, and so convicted them in his first writing upon
the earth, as having broken the Law, as Moses did the first Table; and therein
their consciences accuse them as guilty of murder, and so they absent
themselves from Christ.

And in his second writing on the earth, he signifies that law of the spirit,
which is for ever kept and preserved in himself, wherein is found no
condemnation, but an acquittance from all sin and unrighteousness, and
therefore the woman escapes without condemnation, when none but Christ,
according to that law appears with her.

A Commentary might be writ of this point, but thus much only as closely as may
be in way of caution, to prevent men in their so confident prosecutions, formed
from the letter of the Scripture, as they piece-meale it out of the wisdom of
man, left it prove no better in conclusion then the wisdom of the Serpent;
that whilst they entice to the eating of the fruit of one tree, because of the
fairness and benefit of it, they do not corrupt and destroy another in
themselves in so doing, before they be well aware of it.

For if such men's wisdom and wills had taken place in the days of Juda and
Thomas, they would have made a breach in the Geneology of Christ: And if they
say they would have stopped execution till the children had been born, then
they would not have sto^d to the glory of the Law; which after it be truly
discerned, stands in seleritas inexequendo.

We are then to attend the mind of the spirit of God in this; namely that our
yea be yea, and our nay, nay, wherein the scope of the Scriptures do consist,
being the state of mankind with respect unto God, which is in one act and for
ever, and not in the relation of any one Creature or Creatures, with respect
unto others; that is, to any mere creature or creatures, which may now be yea,
it is, and immediately nay, it is not: but in Christ it is not so, who is the
end of all law, the scope of all relations, and the very end which all
operations drive at, and press unto, as he is crucified according to the
flesh, or else according to the spirit; in which respect, yea remayns yea, and
nay remayns nay, both in the way of Christ, and in the way of Antichrist: So
that he that teaches another thing to be the intent and meaning of the word of
God, what ever it is that may one time be, and another time not be in the same
state and condition of mankind considered, that is a doctrine under the state
of condemnation: Therefore he backs it with this argument, Lest you fall into
condemnation. The word translated Lest, is not spoken as a supposition, but as
an absolute affirmation, You are fallen into condemnation: As in the Prophecy
of Isaiah, the words of Rabshekah are, Lest Hezekiah deceive you: For which in
the book of Kings is written, Hezekiah deceives you. So also where one
Evangelist says, Lest the people faint in the way. Another rehearsing the same
story, says, The people will faint in the way, as a certain conclusion
thereof; and so it is here, If your yea be not yea, and your nay, nay, you are
not fallen into condemnation; therefore Christ affirms, that whatsoever is more
(of the very same point) is of that evil one, that is, of the Devil.

We are to know then, that such Doctrine as teaches, that it was yea, that
certain Angels, and also man were made in happy estate and condition, but
afterward it was nay, for the same state and condition became evil. It was
yea, that Christ dyed, and afterward it was nay, he lived again in the same
respect that he is said to be dead, according to the scope of the Scriptures:
Also that it is yea, the Saints of God are sinners; but hereafter it shall be
nay, for they shall have nay sin; in the same respect considered further, it is
or was yea; that the worship of God is or was tied to such a form, according to
the intent of Scripture, but it is or shall be nay; it either is not now, or
hereafter shall not be tied to such a form as it has been, or now is,
according to the intent of Scripture.

Doctrine of this nature is more then to let yea be yea, and nay be nay, for it
makes the same thing to be both yea and nay, which the Apostle affirms to be
the word of God, not but it is yea and Amen, the same for ever in the word of
Blessing, as also in the word of the Curse.

This doctrine then is that way of the fall, and defection from God brings men
under the state of death and condemnation, as here our Apostle affirms, and
has not salvation and life by Christ contained in it.

We are not ignorant of the manifold objections which may arise in men's hearts,
backed by carnal Ministry in way of man's wisdom, drawn from the letter of the
Scripture, which we have not ceased to speak unto as the Scriptures have given
us occasion.

We shall here propound two, and speak a word to each of them.

First, the fall of man, which as it is carnallized seems to interpose sin
between God and the elect for a time.

Secondly, the confessions of the Saints of God of a miserable condition for
present.

To the first we answer, that there is a miserable defection from God, and also
a happy gathering up into unity with God, both with respect unto mankind, and
no other creature whatsoever in heaven or in earth: And as for that Doctrine of
Angels in that acceptance the world takes them, it is a mere fiction brought
forth by humane wisdom, brooding upon the letter of the Scriptures; for there
is no elect Angel which consists not of the same nature which the Angel of
the Covenant does, which is Christ Jesus, God and man, in one subsistence and
being.

And again, if there was a sin in the fall of Angels before the sin and fall of
man, how could the Apostle confess himself in that faithful saying, worthy
of all acceptance (or to be embraced of all the Saints so as to acknowledge the
same) That Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am
chief; or as the word is, I am the first: So that if there be a sin before the
sin of man, how can man be said to be the first sinner; this doctrine therefore
makes void the truth of the Scriptures in every foundation thereof.

We grant then that there is an absolute and real change both in the Son of
God, and the son of perdition, but what change is from that first act of the
manner of the being of each of them once and for ever, without other mutation
or change otherwise: That is to say, in the Son of God; the wisdom proper unto
a creature is in the first act and manner of his being changed and transformed
into the wisdom and principles peculiar to God himself; and this estate is,
and abides the same for ever which is Christ the seed of the woman.

Again, in the son of perdition, the wisdom of God is changed and transformed
into the wisdom and principles peculiar to a creature, and that in the very
first act and manner of his being; and this estate is, and abides for ever the
same, and is Antichrist that seed of the Serpent, yea that very Serpent the
Devil himself.

Even as Christ is not only that seed of the woman, but also that spirit which
over-shadoweth her, even God himself.

Furthermore, the word of God never expressed it self, but as a word of
wisdom; therefore it is said by the Psalmist, O Lord how manifold are thy
works, in wisdom have thou made them all. So says Solomon, The Lord by
wisdom laid the foundation of the earth. And the Apostle says, Christ is the
wisdom of God, and the power of God. Therefore out of him there is no wisdom,
so that there is no expression of the word of God, or any existance of the work
of God, but with respect unto Christ therefore the first words and works
manifested by God in the Scriptures is the preaching of Christ, which is the
glad tidings of salvation, the Gospel of God, which was never known, nor ever
shall be, but in the death and resurrection of Christ, and that through the
tender of him in whom the day springs from on high to visue us. So that in the
framing of neaven and earth in the beginning, this mercy-seate is erected,
whereon those two Cherubims do stand, the death and resurrection of the Son of
God, and from this mercy-seate, and from between these two Cherubims the word
of God is ever uttered, and did never in any other way express it self in the
world.

Therefore the life and resurrection of the Son of God in his Saints, and his
death and descention in men of the world, do face each other, as holding
proportion, and being of like capacicity, even those two Cherubs of mercy and
Juistice distributed in Kingly authority, where ever the mercy-seate is ser up
in the publication of the Gospel; and this life and death holds proportion in
point of time so as never life nor death were ever before, or shall be after
them.

The doctrine therefore of Angels and man in a state of innocence, and yet out
of Christ, being changed from that which they were from the beginning, is no
doctrine savouring of Christ in the Gospel, nor word of life and salvation. But
only as those sayings of old of the Scribes and Pharisees, which our Lord
Christ so carefully corrects, as such as were corrupters of the Law, walking
according to the oldnesse of the letter, and not in the newness of the spirit,
for arguments of that nature are not consistant with the doctrine of the
Gospel, and faith of Christ Jesus.

For to affirm that man is sometimes in Christ, and sometimes out of Christ in
the same individual, is all one to affirm, that the Son of God is sometimes
in favor with the Father, and sometimes out of favor with him; which is no
less then to say, that sometimes Christ the Savior of the World is true God,
and sometimes he is no God, and then no Savior at that time at all.

And note here for the conclusion of this point, that the doctrine of the
Gospel is not yea and nay, but yea and Amen, once and for ever. That the Son of
God never was, nor is considerable, knowable, or speakable, but in the
compleatnesse of his mystcall body; in the contriving and device whereof, the
wisdom of God does properly, yea solely consist, for all other things point as
with the finger thereunto: So that to deprive Christ of that work-manship at
any time, first or last, is to deprive God, only and infinitely wise, of that
his wisdom, then the which greater Sacrilege cannot be. What change therefore
may be concluded to appertain and belong unto the Son of God, the same also
belongs unto the Saints of God, and that is once for ever.

For as there is but one death of Christ, so there is but one change as one
eternal act: and as death is considerable in a twofold respect, so is the
change, and are of the same rise in point of time past, and of the same race or
duration for time to come.

No marvel therefore though men cannot calculate the time when Angels
(according to their Doctrine) were created, or when the Devil (as they form
him) took his beginning and rise.

But a word of the next point objected against this eternal Gospel which that
Angel that flies through the midst of heaven preaches, being at a like
distance from every part of it, all things being beyond comprehension, and he
is a like near unto all, for the midst of heaveen is the center of the world,
where all points of the heavens meet and unite themselves in one.

And this second Objection consists in the Confessions of the Saints of God,
and is a confirmation of the point, for which we will instance in one for all,
and that is the Apostle Paul, who is said to be first a Saul, and afterward a
Paul; who first breathed out slaughters against the Saints, and afterward
payers, Behold he prays; once said to be the chief of sinners, and again not
inferior to the chiefest Apostle of Christ: once a persecuter of the Church,
and afterward a Preacher of righteousness in the constitution of the Church:
once a blasphemer, and afterward utters the high praises of God: once engaged
to the high Priest of that carnal and degenerate Synagogue of the Jews, by
letters received to execute their enmity on all that call on the name of Jesus;
and af^terwards so engaged to the Saints of God, as to be sacrificed, or poured
out as a drinke-offering upon the service of their faith.

To which we answer; That whatsoever is said of this holy Apostle in point of
evil with respect unto that vicious and depraved nature of man, it is spoken
of him only as personated in that corrupt course and condition of the carnal
Jew, so as to declare and set out unto all the world that stock and race of
which by nature he comes, even as all men spring out of the dust, which is the
proper meat of the Serpent wherewith he is nourished and kept alive according
to the flesh, and according to the proper bent and propencity thereof brings
forth nothing but enmity, corruption, and subtilty.

For it is dust and Gods image which are the materials of man's being in his
Creation; for there is the seed of man's wisdom as a creature, as well as the
seed of Gods wisdom as a Creator, which twayn are mayntained for ever, or else
Gods workman-ship should fail and come to naught; but it is to abide in both
respects, and that in the height and eminency of each of them, which could
never be in one and the same subject undivided, for they are inconsistant;
therefore mankind cannot be known but with respect unto seed and generation:
and so these are both found in their height in Caine and Seath, who is set in
Abels stead, and in them the whole work is brought to light, which before lay
but as in the Chaos or Embryon in the man and the woman, so that neither is to
be annihilated: No man shall kill Caine, a mark is set on him by God, as a
seal to confirm his life to the flesh, the very prints and characters of
humane wisdom turning it self (as seal to the wax) to the word or wisdom of
God: So that as the Sun which has dominion of the day, and the Moon having
dominion of the night, shall never fail, but are those faithful witnesses of
heaven: so the sight of Gods wisdom hearing rule in the day of salvation: and
the wisdom of man as that other great light ruling in darkness over all those
Lucubrations of the men of the world, are those faithful witnesses of Gods
mercy and severity for ever.

Paul therefore sets forth himself; that is, what he and all men are with
respect unto that wisdom exercised in that legal, and literal worship of
such as put Christ to death, namely the carnal Jew; thereby declaring unto all
men from whence, and from what the word of life has rescued and delivered him,
in whom the state of all the Saints is personated and involved, for the word of
God is not of that narrow scantling and capacity as to center it self only in
one particular man, but it takes in all men that belongs unto that proper
inheritance which it intends in its expressions.

The scope of the Scripture then in Paul as in all other of the Saints, is to
preach Christ, and centers not in any particular man otherwise, and so declares
from what he is changed, as he is man to be made the holy one of God for ever:
Not that Paul was in any time of his life of that corrupt and carnal spirit of
the wicked Jew; for blasphemy against the spirit of God shall never be
forgiven: Also he says of himself, that he was called and sanctified from the
womb, and that he saw Christ as one borne out of due time, or as an abortive;
that is, he reckons himself in the wisdom of God (which gives him his being,
and makes him to be that which he is) as one born out of time; that is, before
all time, for no time can comprehend that; and as one that never saw the Sun,
that is, the glory of the Creature, to place an excellency therein, but only in
that light which shined round about him in the way to Damascus.

So that we may not give these execrable things any being, or time, or abode in
the Apostle of Christ, no more then we can give unto him to be a servant of sin
at that time when he says, So then in my mind I my self serve the law of God,
but in my flesh the law of sin, which things are inconsistant in one
individual subject.

For the word of God is an eternal word, and expresses not it self but with
respect unto an eternal act; it is not a transient and momentany thing, when
it says of Christ, I am a worm and no man, an object, a scorn, a bubble, a
vapor, a vanity, a nothing; to be in the belly of hell, and in the heart of
the earth, to be shut up, and cannot get out; These things are not momentany
expressions, and transient acts, for the word and work of God is no such thing
according to the true and real intent and operation thereof: But they are
real manifestations and declarations of what the world has really made of the
word and wisdom of God in themselves.

And so are these expressions of Paul true manifestations, what the condition
of a carnal Jew is, and how they deal with Christ the wisdom of God, and ever
will do in whomsoever he appears; from which spirit that glorious change
wrought once and for ever in Christ, has freed all the Saints, and set them in
the liberty of the Son of God, which otherwise are no better, but by nature the
same with others.

So that it is not creation of man in being made one with God, wherein
blessedness does properly consist; but it is that generative virtue of the
immortal seed, bringing forth unto God, together with that act of conjunction,
whereunto true blessedness is annexed; therefore Christ is truly said to be
made, and also to be begotten.

For out of that act of Creation in the unity of God and man, not only the
wisdom of God makes it self manifest in giving form unto Christ the seed of
the woman, but also that wisdom of the creature, namely of man, which gives
form to the Serpent, who was more wise then any beast of the field which the
Lord God had made: And that is the seed of the Serpent so brought forth, that
is, in consulting with the wisdom of God from humane principles.

This is a faithful saying then of Paul, and worthy to be embraced of all men,
so as to utter the same language, That Christ Jesus came into the world to save
sinners, of whom I am chief: For he that cannot acknowledge himself to be the
first or chief of sinners, that is to say, in his grand Ancestor being made
one in that act of Creation, as he comes of the earth, and so in that way of
the unbeliever is the first perverter of the word of God to destruction, though
in himself in his proper subsistence in the way of the generation of the Son
of God, he is once and for ever freed therefrom, in that deliverance made by
Christ: so that it is none of his inheritance or portion, otherwise no man can
ever acknowledge himself to be blessed and possessed with the first and chief
righteousness that ever was, namely that righteousness of God in Jesus
Christ, nor know himself to be a firstborn of God, an heyr of the promise,
and an inheritance of life that lasts for ever. And so we come to the fourth
part of the Chapter, containing that fruitful and wholesome benefit, which
spring from the death of Christ in all true Christians, the first whereof is
laid down in the next verse.

Verse. 13. Is any among you afflicted, let him pray; is any merry, let him sing.
Wherein we are to observe a twofold proposition, laid down interrogatively,
together with a twofold answer given thereunto.

The first whereof is this;

Is any among you afflicted, let him pray.
By affliction in this place is meant diminishing or weakening, as the word
imports, and so Pharaoh afflicted Israel in Egypt, to weaken and diminish
them, lest they should grow in multitude, and so wax too strong for him and his
people: but God makes use of that his dealing with them, to increase and
multiply them exceedingly; for that which weakens men in the worlds account,
proves through Gods device to be the strength and power of the Saints of God.

Therefore our Apostle puts us upon this question; Is any among you afflicted?
Being that he had told them of what nature the death of the Son of God is in
the godly, namely to bereave and dispoil them of all the strength, glory,
excellency, and goodlinesse of man, so as it becomes as the withered gross, or
decayed flower of the field, when the spirit of the Lord breaths upon it; yea,
though they be weakened and diminished in all such respects, so as they have
nothing of that nature to trust or betake themselves unto, which can stand them
in any stead.

As if he should say, has the Gospel and word of the Kingdom made spoil and
prize of all things among you, or in you? has it routed and laid you wast of
all such transitory ways and perfunctory worships as the carnal and litterall
Jews do commonly boast themselves of, and comfort and content themselves in,
of which Paul says, If any man might boast of, he much more, circumcised the
eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamine, an Hebrew of
Hebrews, as touching the law a Pharisee, concerning zeal, persecuting the
Church, and touching that righteousness which is in the law blameless: And
where shall we find a Church extant in these days which speaks by any other
spirit then this, which runs in the sincke and channel of such external and
extrinsicall institutions, ordinances, genealogies, pharisaical righteousness,
persecuting zeal, and tribe-like division of rule and government.

But what says our Apostle of all these things? But what things were gain to
me; that is, as the very wealth and riches of a carnal Jew, those I counted
loss for Christ, yea doubtless, and I counted all things but loss, for the
excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered
the loss of all things, and count them but dung, that I may win Christ. And
for this loss, diminution, or affliction, our Apostle prescribes the cure and
remedy in whomsoever it is suffered, in this his answer given.

Let him pray.
The word (Let) has a like Emphasis, as that of the Creation at the beginning,
Let there be light, and it was so, and has in it the very force and virtue of
creating the spirit of prayer and intercession in that heart, in which this
loss, diminution, or affliction is found, for it signifies as much as Amen, so
be it, or so it is, or so it shall be; so that it fits the soul with the
spirit of prayer, as the world was furnished with light by the same phrase in
the beginning, without which spirit or breath of prayer the soul is without
life, even as the world was in darkness without the creation of light, or as
the body that breaths not is dead, so is the soul without prayer.

Concerning praying therefore being so necessary unto the life of the Son of
God, consider, 1. The signification of the word. 2. How it is to be taken in
this place as an answer to the interrogation, or effectual and forcible
sentence. To pray, is to make an appeal, it is an appellation, or
intercession; for the original word in the Hebrew tongue, which the Prophets
use for prayer, is Hithpallel, which signifies to appeal, or present a man's
self, or cause to the Judge, and it comes of pillel, which signifies to judge or
determine causes, for which appeals are made.

1. To pray therefore, is to make our appeal from one Judgement-seate unto
another; that is, from the judgment and determination of man's wisdom, opinion,
and sentence, to that wisdom and device of the Son of God, who judges not as
man judges: For as far as the heavens are higher then the arth, so is the
way of the judgment of God higher than all the Thrones and Judgement-seats of
the sons of men; therefore the Apostle tells the Corinthians that were carnal,
That it seems a small thing to him to be judged of them, or of man's judgment,
or of man's day, as the word is; that is, by the light understanding or wisdom
humane, only he stands to the judgment and wisdom of God, so as he judges not
himself; that is, by his own wisdom as a man, but by the wisdom and light of
the spirit of God: Therefore the Psalmist complayns, saying, Many there be that
say of my soul, there is no hope for him in God, Selah: but he appeals unto
God as to his shield, and the lifter up of his head, but thou O Lord art a
shield about me; that is, a defense from all adverse power set forth and
signified in Absoloms conspiracy; and the lifter up of my head, or head-ship,
in setting me to be head of the people, and not Absalom, and that only through
thy wisdom, where the wisdom, counsel and craft of Achitophel cannot take
place; prayer therefore is an appeal from one judgment-seate to another.

2. Prayer is to speak, or plead a cause: so says the Prophet Daniel, Whilst
I was speaking in prayer, presenting my supplication before the Lord my God,
for the holy mountain of my God, even while I was yet speaking, the man
Gabriel, or the strength of God came flying vehemently and touched me. It is a
word or speech by which the strength of God hasts it self, and makes speed to
lay hold upon the soul: So David calls it a speech, saying, My heart was hot
within me, whilst I was musing the fire burned, and I spoke with my tongue,
Lrrd make me to know mine end, etc.

3. Prayer is to supplicate and entreat; so says the Psalmist, Return we
beseech thee O God of hosts: And again, I beseech thee deliver my soul: And
again, Save now I beseech thee O Lord, O Lord I beseech thee send now
prosperity. So says Moses, I beseech thee show me thy glory. Prayer is the
office and property of a supplicant.

4. Prayer is to judge and determine a cause (as the word signifies) therefore
David says, Hear me when I call O God of my righteousness (or justice) that
is, of my just and righteous cause: and again, Judge me O Lord, for I have
walked in mine integrity, I have trusted in the Lord, I shall not stagger: And
again, Hear me when I call, and answer my prayer.

Now for God to judge the cause of his Saints, to hear prayer, and to answer
when they cry unto him, is to give right sentence, and to determine the matter:
which thing is not done in another state and condition, but in that individual
being and state of a Christian in that Saint of Israel, or holy one, the
judgment is not passed, and sentence given of the cause and matter, by or from
another subsistence or being: but in that subsistence and consistance of the
Son of God, the hearing, answering, judging, determining, and passing sentence
of, or upon any cause or matter presented by prayer, is no further off, nor at
any other distance from the state and being of a Christian, then the cause or
matter is which is presented, for they both flow from, and are acts of the same
spirit, as man ascending in the word of God for supply, and the word of God
discending in man, to declare its fullness.

So that there is in prayer a just appeal from the wisdom and practice of the
world unto God; and there is in it also an humble suit and real act of a
supplicant and intreater for favor, yea and the pleading and laying open of a
righteous cause before the Judge of all the earth, together with the hearing,
answering, judging, determining, and passing Sentence thereupon.

And every one of these are as really intrinsicall, and of the same nearness
to a Christian, making all for his proper being and subsistence as well one of
them as another; neither shall he for ever be without any one of them, but they
shall be as an harmonious mellody in the soul or life of a Christian for ever,
which if we deny, we hold not the unity of faith according to that complete and
mystical body of Jesus Christ, but make a fraction therein to the deviding of
that holy one of God, which is that state of unbeleif, on which wrath abides.

So that when a Christian cease to judge between sin and righteousness,
between Christ and Belial, when he cease to discern the difference between
light and darkness, between God and the Devil, then prayer shall have an end
and cease in the spirit of a Christian, and not till then; for it is the very
breath of the Son of God, whereby he lives the life of God eternally.

Note from this point, as it has been often declared unto us how the prayers
of the world, not only in set forms, but in the more refined Preisthood fall
short of the nature of the intercession of Christ, who ever lives to make
intercession, not only for, but in us, without straining of the word, so that
they deny the nature of the prayer and intercession of Christ, in this great
point of its continuation.

And so in like manner their doctrine must needs fall short of that message of
life and salvation, and so much for the signification of the word prayer.

2. The second point is in what acceptance it is to be taken here, and that is
for an appeal, implying hereby thus much, as if in more words he should say,
have you lost all your own humane and fading excellencies, in the proper life
and spirit of all your earthly and momentany relations, for the most honorable
loss of them is, when we are cut off from them in our hearts, in the present
enjoyment of them, as in covenants, contracts, and combinations with the
creature, that carnal and topped up height of all your places of worldly
dignities: have you picked out that common stamp, in all your relations and
operations, which the spirit of the serpent sets upon them, making them appear
beautiful and desirable; and are you diminished and corrected, as having all
such superfluous branches lopt away from you, as yiedling no shelter, nor glory
or safeguard unto you. Take it for granted that it is so, yet here is a
sufficient supply and remedy, make your addresses and appeal unto God in
Christ, in whom they are all full, and that in an eternal complete and perfect
supply, as things that are only proper and peculiar to the glory and duration
of that eternal Son of God, and not to that mortal, fading, and shameful
race and pedigree of the sons of earthly men, whose breath as a vapor is in
their nostrils; for in Christ you shall have and be both king and subject, and
so shall never fail nor betray himself, which no earthly man can attain, for
he is that ruler in submission as the Apostle to Titus calls him; for there is
the truth of rule and submission in Christ as one, and both in the utmost
excellency thereof, though men translate the word, as a charge to obey
magistrates, Tit. 3. 1. To that effect the Apostle speaks, I John who am also
your brother and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom, and patience of
Jesus Christ; or as the word is rightly rendered, in the kingdom and
under-abiding of Jesus Christ: So that he is a companion in kingdom, that is,
in power and authority, and also in under-abiding, or in a perpetuated
submission to the will of the father: so that in the state of Christianity
there is all the relations, acts, and waits of administration of the kingdom,
all relations and mutual respects are there in act, and are fulfilled as in a
kingdom of eternal glory and power, and that only in the loss and
villification of nothing else but an earthly fading and corruptible Crown,
which Paul counts as dung, and loss, as the shame and undoing of man, that he
may win the Diadem and glory of the other.

Again, in it you shall have that mutual relation of husband and wife in that
glorious and happy espousall of Christ, for he that is joined unto the Lord is
one spirit with him, or one spiritual estate and condition, in which is
completed, and fulfilled all those mutual and conjugal relations, acts, and
operations of the married estate, in the reality thereof, in which the nuptial
day and joyful feastivity never cease; nor can time be found wherein it may
not be said; Behold this is the day of salvation, behold now the accepted time,
yea this is the day which the Lore has made, let us be glad and rejoice
therein.

Moreover in the state of a Christian you shall find the relation of father
and son, for the Father and I are one, there is the language of the son of God,
and that in all the ways and administrations, o^ Education, donation,
resignation, and inheritance of that purchased possession, acted and done, and
ever in the act of doing, betwixt the father of lights, and that son of
righteousness, that great light that lightneth every one that comes into the
world, so that in this appeal all loss of temporary condition is infinitely
supplied in eternal.

And further, in it you have the state and relation of high Priest and people,
and that in all those several respects of sacrifices, services, and oblations,
together with their respective virtues and operations in point of that
reconciliation and agreement made between God and man in the multiplied comfort
thereof, exercised in that house and temple not made with hands, but is
eternal in that heaven, or height of happiness in Christ, who is that
dwelling place of the most high.

But time would fail to speak of these things, because they are infinitely
uncountable, and unmeasurable in all their relations, offices, respects, and
operations, which are through that device of God in christ to be attained in
this appeal: because God himself who is infinite, emence, and eternal, gives
being unto, and is the reallity of them all, and yet man is really in the use,
comfort, existance, and exercise of them all, even as it is true that the soul
is properly the fountain, and cause of all the motions and operations of the
body, and yet the body is really in the exercise, and has the participation of
them all.

For in this appeal is fulfilled that law of the spirit, which Paul to the
Romans says is fulfilled in us; so also speaks the Apostle John, that the new
Commandment is fulfilled in him and in us, because the darkness is past; that
is, that which is proper and incident unto the creature, and the true light
shines; that is, that which is proper unto God is broke forth and appears in
us, for a law cannot consist of one but must have respect unto twain,
otherwise there is no bond, therefore the law of the spirit is not contrived,
takes form, or holds in any point thereof, but as it consists of God and man in
that faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, in which or in whom stands all our
Lordship and salvation: for howsoever in the world there be Gods many, and
Lords many, yet unto us there is but one Godhead who is Lord over all, and one
Lordship which abides and remains the same for ever.

Are we then at a loss in the world, enjoying nothing that can abide by us, as
Abraham sojourned in Canaan, as the land is carnally considered, not enjoying
the breadth of a foot thereof: as Stephen, that faithful Martyr, or witness,
makes report.

Let us make our appeal, for in this offspring and seed of God, the whole
inheritance in all its excellencies is perfected and completed in us, as the
wole land was given to Abraham in his seed, after the enduring of so great
affliction.

So that in this appeal is contained a supply of every want, a comfort against
every affliction, a restoration of every loss, as being that year of Jubilee,
or Jubel, the time of carrying or leading along, as the word imports, into that
ancient liberty, rest, and riches that are in the Son of God; wherein we find
an infinite augmentation and increase of all things (wherein) with respect to
the world, we are diminished.

And hence the second Query is added of purpose, which naturally flows from
this, with the answer or direction annexed.

Is any merry let him sing.
By being merry, pleasant, or joyful, in this place, is meant the joy of
harvest or first fruits, or that triumphant mirth, and joyful feastivity and
splendant liberty exercised in Israel in that year of Jubilee, when the land
brought forth so plenteously of it self, without the labor and toil of the
people, or any means used by humane hands or administrations, no not so much as
to gather it in, but feed upon the fruits where they were found naturally
growing in the land, which is here alluded unto, to set forth that abundant
supply and furniture to be found in this our appeal, which yields unto us
through Gods appointment without humane help, all those liberties, privileges,
riches, and rest, which anciently have appertained unto the Son of the
eternal God.

So that however we may go forth of the things of this life, as weeping in the
eyes of the world, like men in the time of sowing, parting with all their store
and provissions of temporary things; even as the people parted with the glory
of the carnal temple, when they went down into Babylon: yet we know, that
those which bear the precious seed, or as the word imports, used by the
Psalmist, the purchased seed, such shall return with shouting, joyfulnesse,
bringing their sheaves with them: They then that have their lap filled with
Ruth, in the parting from their native country to follow that motherly Naomy,
being increased with the increasings of God, in the diminutions of all humane
and Moabitish preferments and excellencies, who have found the harvest, and
more of the full years of corn in Canaan, to exceed all the thin ears in the
land of Egypt: And how that vintage which rejoices the heart of God and man,
excels and surpasses the Vines of Sod me and the grapes of Gomorah, such as
make merry in the Lord, being joyful and triumphant in his salvation, as
Israel was in his coming out of the red Sea; or as the word imports, the Sea of
Edom, adversary to Israel, though near unto him in their first original.

When Moses and the men of Israel sung so triumphantly, with Mirriam, and the
damsels answering thereunto, with sollem pomp in that happy return of the
Captain of Israel, from the victory and slaughter, in breaking the head of
that Leviathan, and giving him to be meat for the people in the wilderness;
such as are merry with this kind of mirth, and in such causes, they only are
the parties unto whom this direction belongs.

Let him sing.
The word let, is of like force as is before explained, giving virtue and
existance to the mellody of a song in the soul of him, in whom this mirth is
found; and by the word sing, is comprehended also, playing on instruments,
dancing, or any joyful activity or acclamation.

So that all such as have made their lawful appeal (as congruous to that law
of the spirit) from the judgment and determination of the wisdom of man, unto
that which only consists in the wisdom and device of God in Christ: They
receive such plenty thereby, and skill for the use and exercise thereof, that
they become expert, in handling all those organs, iustruments, and exercises of
joy and triumph, which appertain and belong to that spiritual Tabernacle and
Temple, which God builds, and not man, so as to proclaim and set forth that
harmony, and melodious consort, and agreement (unto the world) which is between
God and man in that faith of Jesus Christ.

Which is the song of old Simeon, Mary, and Elizabeth, Deborah, and Barack, and
of all the Saints of God from the beginning until now; For there is none that
can appeal unto God in prayer, removing the cause from carnal reason into his
wisdom, holding a holy plea, in opening the necessities of mankind unto God,
carrying up, and giving true intelligence of the same unto him; but that man
whatever he be, can also bring down, and distribute unto the world, the true
state and condition of the Son of God, who is the subject matter of the Gospel,
and give undoubted intelligence of that peace and plenty which is in the
kingdom of God, uttering and declaring how good the Lord is in Jesus Christ.

Note then from this point as a conclusion thereof; That the true spirit of
prayer and supplication, and the spirit of Prophecy and interpretation, are
never separated, never were, nor never shall be, but are of an eternal unity
and conjunction in the faith of Christ; and hence it is, that the Elders and
instructors of the Church are brought in as having the spirit of prayer, to
pray for the Church in the next Verse following.

Verse. 14. Is any sick among you let him call for the Elders of the Church, and
let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.
Wherein we have to consider; first, a proposition; and secondly, the answer
thereunto; in the proposition observe.
1. A disease, Is any among you sick. 2. The practice of the party diseased, as
part of the answer, and that is, to call for the Elders of the Church. Then
consider in the rest of the answer, or direction, the practice of the Elders,
that is threefold.
1. To pray over him. 2. To anoint him with oil. 3. The manner how, that is,
in the name of the Lord.

1. FOr the first, namely the proposition, If any be sick among you? This is
not spoken in way of supposition, but in way of certainty, and as taken for
granted: and by sickness we are not to understand only a distemper of the
body, no nor yet some certain sorrow, grief, or disquiet of the mind, which
the word may seem to import; but we are to take it as large as Joseph did; when
he heard that his father was sick, he presently takes his two sons unto him (as
giving him up for dead) to be blessed in his death and departure; for it is in
this case as it was with Hezekiah, when he was sick unto death, which if he had
not been, his life had never been renewed as it was: and as his life was
restored through the spirit of prophecy in Isajah, so here the life of the
sick is restored by the spirit of prayer in the Elders, and as the spirit of
prayer was in Hezekiah, else had not the prophecy taken place, For he turned
his face to the wall and prayed: Even so is the spirit of prophecy conversant
in this sick party, or else the prayer of the Elders cannot be effectual,
which spirit of prophecy appears in his calling for the Elders, as foreseeing
health to arise out of that special appointment and ordination of the wisdom
of God.

And as a miraculous sign was given at the recovery of Hezekiah, namely the
Sun going back ten degrees in the dyall of Ahaz, that wicked King, to declare
that the light and wisdom of the world by which the men thereof rule and
reign over their brethren goes directly backward, and contrary to that sun of
righteousness, light and wisdom proper unto the Saints: and that it is for
ever so to be considered, is signified by those ten degrees, which number has
the mystery of eternity taught in it, for so Moses does expound it, saying, a
bastard shall not enter into the Congregation of the Lord unto the tenth
generation, which in the next verse he concludes to be for ever: Even so here
is the sign of the holy unction given to this sick party, to signify his
reception from the dead, even as Abraham received his Son as from the dead in
his exercise of the Priests office in sacrificing and offering him up unto God.

This sickness therefore is as that of Lazarus whom Jesus loved; for when his
sister told Jesus that he was sick, it is plain by the record in computation
of the time, that he was then dead; which Christ affirms is not death, but
that way of the operation, and manifestation of the glory of God, which only
and for ever shines and sets forth it self, through the death of the
flesh; that is, the death of all humane and carnal reasonings, resolutions, and
conclusions, in point of the knowledge of Jesus Christ; which sickness or
death to all the legal and litteral services, according to the carnal law is
truly said to be not unto death, because it is unto that eternal life of the
Son of God, and a sickness of this nature we are to understand in this place,
or else we carnallize the sickness, as surely as Rome does at this day the
Eldership, as also New England, more zealously then they, and the reason is,
because the one is Hehetated with worldly pomp, and the other is
Persequentissimus, but has not yet attained thereunto.

And whereas it is said, Is any sick among you? or as the word may be read, is
any sick in you? as speaking either of person or thing, as the Psalmist has a
phrase, help Lord, for the fathfull fail; that word faithful is used in
Scripture sometimes for a true or faithful person, and sometimes for a true
thing; as if he should say, help Lord, for trueths fail, or fidelities fail;
So this word (any) may be taken for any person or any thing, as if he had said,
is any thing in you sick? or are you dead to any particular thing whatsoever,
which worldly men make their life and trade, so that you cannot relish nor taste
it, no more then a sick or dead man can relish any food, to quicken or enliven
him, be sure then to use the remedy prescribed unto you, for your health and
restoration, and your days shall be renewed with Hezekiah, and your life
recovered with Lazarus, and you shall be raised out of the grave of all sin and
sorrow; and that is, to call for the Elders of the Church, for they are the
resurrection and the life in this point; in which observe,

1. What it is to call. 2. Who these Elders be. 3. What is the Church of which
they are.
1. Concerning the Call, the same word is prefixed as before (let him call) and
it is of like Emphesis, that is to say, that through this sickness or death
here spoken of, it creates and gives being in that soul unto the life of the
Son of God, and that life is the light of men; by virtue of which light he
becomes a Seer, for it has the spirit of Prophecy in it, whereby he discerns
wherein true health does consist, and knows what the Eldership is, and where to
find the true Church, which is so controverted throughout the earth, in all
ages of this present world: so that if this sick party had not perfect vision,
he might wander from mountain to hill, and from the flood to the worlds end,
before he could attain the true knowledge thereof.

For some say, lo here is Christ, and some say lo there, which we are not to
believe neither the one nor the other; some say, he is in the desert; and some
say; he is in the mountain; and some, in the secret Chamber: but as the
lightning shines from one end of heaven unto the other, so is the coming of
the Son of man; that is to say, all things that ever were or shall be,
proclaim his present abode in mankind either in point of his life, or death,
in mercy, or else in his severity, and such are the confines of the Church, it
is not bounded within the circuit of time, place, or person, no more then the
Son of God is; for his Spouse holds proportion with himself in all points,
therefore is she admired as one that looks forth as the morning, fair as the
moon, clear as the Sun, terrible as an Army with banners: nay it is said to be
his body, the fullness of him that fills all in all: So that to form and
fashion a Church of less comprehension then Christ, will prove rather a
Sinagogue of Satan, or cage of unclean birds, then the spouse of Christ: so
that our Chronologers deceive the world, in framing a Christ only by
genealogy, not knowing what the Prophet means when he says, he was taken
from prison, and from judgment, and who shall declare his generation, he was
war cut off from the land of the living, and made his grave with (or in) the
wicked, and in the rich in his death; it seems Philip (that man of war) is not
joined to their Chariot (as his name signifies.)

And so they frame a Church not only by separation of themselves from others
by some carnal and temporary ceremonies, that they may say, Stand by thy
self, I am holier then thou. If these be their defenses from the wicked, they
had need carry them along with them through death, or else the fence being
down, they will go near to come over and feed with them in the same pasture.

But this is not all the separation they make, for they divide the word of God,
and separate it, to form their Church, saying, that such portions of the word
of God were for the form of the Church in such an age of the world, and for
such people; but now another portion of it gives the form in our days, as
though the word of God were dead, or fallen asleep unto the world in some
injunctions and promises, but alive and awake in others, whereas they may as
well change and alter the form and manner of the being of the Son of God, as to
change and alter the form, and manner of being of the Church of God; for the
word of God in whatsoever it has expressed, is the will, or law of God, and
the will of God cannot change, and Christ is the end of the law: so that if we
fall short of him in any portion of the word of God, as though he had been in
it, but now is passed over it, or as though it intended him, but yet has not
brought him forth, we make it the word of man, and not the word of God; for
man's reason is the proper word of man, even as the wisdom of God in that
wonderful contriving of his Son, is the word of God; and therefore man is said
to be made a living, or a speaking soul, or life of speech, or reason, whereby
he transcends all other creatures excepting none; for no Angel, that is,
messenger, or message was ever sent from God unto the world out of mankind.

It is true indeed, that the word of God has expressed it self, as in diverse
Nations, Jew, and Gentile, in differing generations, or genealogies, as Cain
and Seth, Abraham and Nahor, Jacob and Esau, and the like, as teaching higher
and more transcendant things thereby; Therefore to rest in these as being the
intent and scope of the Scriptures, without seeing and acknowledging the life
and death of Christ in them, both according to the flesh, and also according to
the spirit; we may by as good skill of interpretation center and terminate the
mind of God in making any or all those visible creatures in heaven and in
earth, in that proper work, without having any respect at all unto man therein,
and make them the utmost and extremest point of Gods thoughts and intent,
which were no better then to disinherit the Son of God, making a bastard and no
Son of him, being they were all made to do service unto him, and to stand up,
and jointly and skilfully point as with the finger to direct either to his
perpetual, life, or death, as being the reality, and substantiality of them
all; the form of a Church therefore as constituted into particulers now in the
world, is of no more weight or worth in a Christian mind then any other order
wherein men are conversant in ways of civillity, so called; for if once we
find the substance by the light of that day that springs from on high, the
darkness of night, and shadow fly away.

So as nothing looks amiable upon us, but only glory in the highest, and peace
in the earth, to that man of good will who dwells in the bush.

It is the spirit of Prophecy therefore, or of true interpretation that calls
in the Eldership, which sees this sickness or death, to be that renovation of the
health and life of mankind in Christ, from that carnal life which the world
lives, from living unto earthly and transitory things, to live unto heavenly
and everlasting things, such as abide for ever; therefore it is said, that
fifteen years are added unto the life of Hezekiah, which number consists of
ten, and five; ten has in it the mystery of eternity, as has been declared;
and five has in it the mystery of multiplication, signifying that variety and
uncountable ways of health and life which in all respects and ways of relation
are multiplied and exercised in that mystical body and state of Christ.

Therefore no speech of the multiplication of any of Gods works till the fifth
day, to show the mystery of this number; therefore it is that Joseph brings
five of his brethren before Pharaoh to signify the multiplication of blessings
upon the land by all the family, seeing so manny had come upon it by his being
there as one; the like is in Benjamins mess, sent in by Joseph, five times so
much as any of the rest, to show the multiplication of his love to that his
brother, who only came of the beloved Rachel, together with himself.

In the recovery out of this sickness, or renewing of life from the dead, we
are to consider what Christ says, viz. Except the wheat corn dye, it
multiplies not; that is, except Christ the seed of God dye, he multiplies not;
in which we are to know, that divine nature simply considered in it self, is
not the seed of God, no more then the seed of mankind is simply in the male,
but respectively in male and female, else it produces not, to multiply its
kind, and every tree has seed in it self, therefore the man is not without
the woman, nor the woman without the man in the Lord. They are but one tree;
that is, one estate and condition: even so the seed of God is whole Christ, God
and man made one, and this wheat corn or seed must dye, or else it brings not
forth the true kind and offspring of the Son of God; that is, it must be sick
and dye to all carnal and corruptible things, or else it never brings forth
that multiplied fruit of the spirit which is in Jesus Christ.

To conclude this point, to call (in this place) for the Elders is not meant,
the mendicimonium of a man, without magnanimity and courage, as one crouching
unto a course and carnal Elder made with hands; that is, set up and created by
men, who can come unto the assembly, and a private person; but before it be
dissolved, is a pulick person, a reverend Elder.

But this call is an anthetique and princely summons of a royal Prophet; for
this sickness has in it the virtue and voice of a summons to convent the true
physician multiplied into an holy and honorable Eldership, the consultation
and practice of whom is the cure of the soul, even as the life and frolic
presumption of the arm of flesh has in it a sufficient summons to bring in
the works of unrighteousness to that appearance of Antichrist, who is that
poysonfull dragon and destroyer of the soul.

Yea this call is the voice of the spouse, being dead to her first husband, and
having forgotten her fathers house in the forsaking of all her kindred, through
which her speech becomes sweet, and her countenance comely for ever.

2. The second point is, who these Elders are; They are not the Elders of
particular Congregations, composed and ordered by man, under that deceivable
term of reformed Churches, as in these days, which are but like to the sheards
of a potters vessel, which cannot be set together or sodred, no more then they
can ever bring themselves into unity; for the spirit of that kingdom is
divided in it self, and therefore can never stand in the way of that
resurrection by Christ, but are in the way of that apostasy and fall of man
from his Creator, endeavoring still to become as Gods by the wisdom of the
flesh.

We must observe then, for the clearing of this point, who they are which our
Apostle writes unto in this Epistle, and that is to the twelve Tribes in their
dispertion, and scattering from Israel, as carnally considered, for otherwise
the Saints are never dispersed from the house and temple of God.

And this scattering is not into any particular country or kingdom, as into
Assyria, Babylon, Caldea, or the like, but over the whole earth, even upon the
breadth of the land of Emanuel, therefore they are said to be scattered abroad,
as having no confines set.

Neither does he write to people as of one age, or tract of time, but as unto
such as shall live in all ages of the world; for as the word of God in the
beginning went not out as to create the Sun for one age of the world, but for
all ages; even so the word of the kingdom, the Gospel of God goes not forth
to the dispersed and outcasts of Israel (that is, from the wisdom, power, and
policy of the arm of flesh) in one place, or one age, but so as every word of
God in its true intent, concerns and fi^s all places and ages of the world,
both in respect of the word of the curse, and of the blessing: so that to
expound the word of God, as fitting for one time, place, age, or person, and
not for another, is the wisdom of man that perishes, and comes to naught, and
not the wisdom of God, which abides the same for ever, and is that light which
guides unto the Elders, who are the only governors and rulers of this
universal Church called into communion and fellowship with this sick party:
and they are the first borne of every tribe, having upon them the office of
King, Priest, and Prophet in every family, and inferior to that dignity; does
not this sickness call for any to come to visit it, knowing all others to be
Physicians of no value, for this kind of sickness summons none but the first
borne of God into communion and fellowship with it; that call which Cornelius
gave to Peter, that Elder of the Church, was like unto this, that when he spoke
of that unction of Christ, the spirit of God descended upon those that heard
it, insomuch that Peter challenges all men, whether they can forbid water that
those should not be baptized who had received the holy spirit as well as
themselves; as if he should say, can any deny the sign of unity between Jew
and Gentile, which is communion and fellowship, seeing they have the ground and
substance thereof, namely are partakers of the spirit of God, that holy
anointing, which is the truth and substance of all community; whether we be
present or absent in body, we are one in that spirit of the Lord. The word of
Prophecy therefore, which is ever accompanied with prayer, as in Cornelius, or
that word of true interpretation of the word of God, knows how to give summons
unto, and call in the life and spirit of kingdom and Preisthood into
fellowship with it self, which is that healthful spirit, or unction that is
by Jesus Christ.

Add further, this sickness is the very foot of the throne, upon which that
great Elder, even the ancient of days sits; for when Daniel beholds through
this spirit of interpretation, he sees thrones set up; or as the word will
bear, thrones cast down, at you may see how the translators give it in both
phrases, signifying thereby that the power and glory of the world is cast down
wheresoever this great Eldership is set up, which is of no less antiquity then
is the eternal, that gives Judgment into the hands of the Saints of the most
high, and possesses them with the kingdom, for none but the eternal can give
an eternal inheritance, and he gives it not but as he sits on this throne,
namely the glory of man cast down, and the gravity of this ancient of days set
up, whose garments are white as snow, and the hair of his head like pure
wool; and such is the royalty and authority of the Eldership here intended,
who are not brought in by any other call but by the Prophecy or interpretation
of the mind of God; therefore it is, that the vision speaks so punctually and
particularly, where and with whom Peter is to be found.

Note here, that even as the life of the flesh, through the crucification of
the spirit, admits none into unity, nor invests any into its proper condition,
but only such as are of its own kind; so the life of the spirit which is in
Christ Jesus, through the crucification of the flesh, admits none into
fellowship, nor invests any into its proper state and condition but its own
kind.

For what is born of the flesh is flesh, and what is born of the spirit is
spirit; and therefore none but the firstborn of God are of this Eldership, or
callers of them into the exercise of their proper virtue and authority, even as
it was with the Apostles when they pronounce peace; if the son of peace be not
there, their peace returns upon themselves, and their abode is not in that
house of family.

3. By these Elders then in the third place, we see what we are to understand
by the Church they are of; that is, that unity and fellowship which the
selected and chosen people of God are of, and have in that fellowship and faith
of Jesus Christ, as they are considered, not in one age, much less in one
Parish or company of people gathered together, but as they are universally
considered in all ages and times of the world.

For such as is the extent of the spirit, by which every Saint lives, and of
those offices of Christ; by virtue whereof, the exercise of such extent is the
true Church ever to be held and taken, otherwise the Church is carnallized, and
cast into the mould of the letter that kills, and not into the mould of the
spirit that gives life. So that to thrust up Christ as into a corner, as in one
age of the world, or to monopolize him amongst a handful of people is all one
as to put him in the grave, though with Nicodemus a Ruler among the Jews, and
that rich man Joseph of Arimethea, both night Disciples for fear of the Jews;
they may seem to differ from Herod, in that they perfume the dead body and wrap
it in clean linen, being affected therewith, but it is but according to the
custom of the Jewish Sinagogue, for they put it in the grave, and roll a great
stone thereupon, as men without hope or desire of the resurrection, having that
common spirit that now lives in the world to beg leave of the Pilates, and
great men thereof, before they dare adventure to trim up the dead body of
Jesus, and fit it for the Sepulcher: But this universal Church of which these
Elders are, is called by the Apostle, mount Zion, the City of the living God,
the new Jerusalem, the general assembly and Church of the firstborn, which
are enrolled in heaven.

And such as constitute and set up a Church not of this nature and
comprehension, they build it up upon mount Sinai, under the terrors of the law,
and sprinckle the instruments and officers there of as with the blood of Abel,
speaking from the ground, or earthly heart of Cain: and not on mount Zion, in
that blood of sprinkling, which speaks better things, in that peaceable
agreement and reconcilement of God and man in Jesus Christ.

Note here, that where two or three are gathered together in any part of the
world, or at any time, we deny it not to be the true Church of Christ; but what
is it which gives it its capacity to be that Church of Christ? is it not he who
is in the midst, or in the heart of them, as the word is, who is no less then
that everlasting father, or that ancient of days; what bounds then can be set
unto it less then that which gives it its capacity, to be such a thing who
extends himself to the whole family of heaven, for unto him all faces look,
and every knee bows: and if once it be so in our selves, we see it in the
whole family and flock of God in all the elect.

So that the true sum and volume of all their doctrine and prayers is of no
less extent, then the whole mystical body of Jesus Christ, otherwise it is
not the word or Gospel of the kingdom, nor the spirit of intercession which is
by Jesus Christ.

Object. But it will be said, that these things crncern the invisible Church,
and not the visible, for the true visible Church is otherwise to be considered.

Answ. To which we answer; that it is a work of as great curiosity to frame a
visible Church of Christ, as to frame and compose a visible body of Christ;
therefore the Apostle comparing the true Church to a body, says, For as the
body being one has many members, and all the members of that body being many,
are but one body, so also Christ.

And again, hear what the spirit says by the Apostle John, viz. As he is, so
are we, even in this world, where he speaks of the Son of God.

So that to frame and compose a visible Church, and to frame and compose a
visible Christ, are of the same nature, and of like ease and difficulty, and
are alike strange unto the world, and of the same acceptance to bring into
manifestation and appearance. Yet we know that Christ in both respects (for
otherwise we know him not) is truly apparent and visible, as also secret and
unseen. For Moses by faith saw him (meaning Christ) who is invisible) that is,
he saw him who is unseeable, and both are really true in a diverse respect.

And they who frame a Christ visible in one age of the world, and not in
another, they do by the same argument conclude the visible Church to appear,
and to be manifest only within the same confines and precincts of time wherein
Christ appeared.

For the Church was never known to appear but in the real form of Gods
righteousness and wisdom, which is Christ, for he is the wisdom of God, and
the righteousness of God by says, which is the reality of the Church: and as
for all imaginary Churches, we skill not, for they will vanish and come to
naught, together with the professors of them, as they have done in all ages.

Again, such as form a Christ unto themselves to appear visibly unto a carnal
eye, so as to accept and approve of that his way of appearance, at the carnal
and perfunctory worshippers of the Jews did. Know this, that whenever the
true Christ appears, he will receive at the hands of such the same measure
which was measured out unto Jesus born of the Virgin, by Herod, Pontius Pilate,
Scribes, Pharisees, with the cry of all the people, saying, Crucify him,
crucify him, away with him, crucify him.

Even so, they that frame unto themselves a visible Church, so as to appear
unto a carnal eye or understanding, as being in a capacity to approve and like
well of it, at the least for a certain season.

Whenever the true Church makes it self visible, it shall receive like
measure at the hands of such persons, to the utmost of their power and ability,
as Christ did when he appeared unto the Jews: For in such persons, and in that
spirit is the zeal of persecution properly founded in the visible and apparent
exercise thereof.

Moreover they that form a visible Church, as not having the invisible virtue
alike efficatious in every part and member thereof, they also form unto
themselves a visible Christ to appear, without aving the complete virtue of the
wisdom and power of God in all respects in him, either in point of his being,
or in the order and manner of his being; and this is that great Image of
Nebuchadnezzar which has beeen so long erected and set up in the world, where
the Scriptures are traditionally acknowledged and read, which all must bow down
unto at the noise of their instruments and institutions, or else the fiery
trial must pass upon them that obey not: Only this is our comfort, that the
Son of God will so appear with them, or in them, that so much as a smell of
that zeal or fiery fume and wrath of the world shall not appear upon them, but
serve only to the destruction of such as are zealous actors in such matters of
the worlds melody.

The next point is the exercise of the Elders, and the first is, they pray over
him, or for him, or without any wrong to the Text with him; that is, in
communion and fellowship with him; for there was never prayer of faith made
unto God, out of which any elect or chosen vessel was excluded; the reason is,
because every acceptable prayer has in it the virtue of the intercession of
Christ, otherwise it is not in his name and authority, and the spirit of Christ
neglects not any one that appertayns to his mystical body; for if it should,
that soul could never be inspired with the spirit of prayer, without which
there is no participation in the mediation of the Son of God, and then no
acceptance with the Father; therefore prayer is communicative to all the
Saints, if it be as the prayer of faith, it is as the lifeblood running into
all the veyns of the whole body; for none can enter into the holy place but he
that carries all the Tribes upon his heart; it is not our temporary and private
wants, which can bring forth a faithful prayer to God; for as prophecy is not
of any private spirit or interpretation, but holy men speak as they are moved
by the holy Ghost, of like public spirit is true prayer.

So that this sick party is in unity with the prayer here spoken of; for the
eldership of this Church, or that eternized fellowship in the ancient of days,
never appears unto any in that miraculous virtue of healing, but in way of
unity with the party healed. Therefore it is, that Christ will have the stone
rouled away from the Sepulcher, that nothing interpose betwixt Lazarus and
himself, when he restores him from death to life.

Also Elisha will be shut up in the same room with the widows son, when he
rayseth him up from the dead; and Paul the Apostle falls upon Eutichus and
embraces him, when he brings his spirit into him again.

Furthermore, where this true Eldership appears, it ever communicates a like
virtue to every individual of the body, for the spirit is not received by
measure; for that which in it self is emence, cannot be received by measure;
they that go about to persuade men that some have a greater portion of the
spirit, and some have a less measure thereof, they may upon as good grounds
persuade men that some shall be saved, and be happy and blessed a long time,
and some a shorter time; for if the spirit of God in any point of our salvation
be subject to measure in latitude, it is as truly subject to be measured and
bounded in longitude, and then salvation is void, which is the doctrine of the
most of our Elders in these days: but the spirit of glory and of God, that
rests upon the Saints through this sickness and suffering, is neither given
out nor received by measure, but is unmeasurable in all its operations, whether
in prayer or in prophecy; for they are so near in alliance, that that which
is the spirit of Prophecy in Eliah (in the history) in his shutting up of the
heavens, and restraining them from rain; and also in the opening of them, to
give rayn in abundance, is said here by our Apostle in this Chapter to be
prayer: Prayer therefore and Prophecy are of like nature, and of like fame in
the the house of God; so that to prefer one before the other, or to contain
the one, harder to be attained then the other; or that one is of more use in
the Church then the other, is not according to the judgment of God, but only in
humane wisdom, and the Serpents subtilty and policy, that things are so
carried in the world to lead men along in blindness, by speaking of the word
of God in such unknown languages, which are not to be heard in the house of
God; for there is no office of Christ whatsoever, or exercise of his spirit,
that one ought to be preferred before another, only the call of God makes every
one chief and principal in its time and season. If men would well consider
this, they might as well lay out money upon their children in the Schools to
learn them to pray, as to teach them to preach, in case the Spirit of God might
be bought for money.

But the point is, that true Prayer and Prophecy do give and proclaym a like
honor, virtue and power to Christ in whomsoever he appears: and they are so
near a kin, that the Apostle appoynts one and the same law in the exercise of
them both; that is, in prayer and prophecy the man is to be uncovered, and in
prayer and prophecy the woman is to be covered. And it is ^suall in Scripture
to use one phrase that signifies both, as in the Psalms; Let God arise
prayer-wise; or as the word may be as truly read, God will arise, or God shall
arise, and his enemies shall be scattered (prophetically.)

The reason is, because none but a Seer can be a supplicant, if he behold not
the thing by the spirit of interpretation or prophecy, to give a true form
unto it; he can never sue for it, because he knows not what it is.

To conclude this point, this act of the Elders may either be taken to pray
with him, or prophecy with him; for we see the spirit of God uses them
indifferently, the one for the other, as in that instance of Eliah which he
brings in, in teaching this doctrine, for the one is as healthful and
necessary for the recovery and well-being of the soul, as the other, and of as
wonderful and miraculous effect for remission and confirmation, and cannot be
in exercise by any, either the one or the other, but as it is accompanied with
the holy oil, even that annoynting which teaches all things, and has no need
to be taught of man; that is, it has no need of humane skill, which falls
infinitely short of that which it brings the soul unto, and instructs and
teaches it in, and that leads us to the second point in the exercise of the
Elders, They annoint him with oil.

3. This sick party therefore, or all such as are dead to the law of the
letter, or carnal command; that is, to the word of God, as it is formed and
fashioned, through the wisdom, art, and skill of humane principles, which the
Schools of Learning among the sons of men in the world are only exercised in,
and conversant about, or else they should undermine their own foundations, and
so let fall their building; for Gods wisdom once laid in the descention of the
Son of God, overthrows it all, as it comes of the Serpent, and so is Satanicall
folly.

But we must know, that the Eldership of Israel consists of the firstborn of
God, and no other, unto whom the Scriptures look in the firstborn of every
Tribe or family of Israel, to instruct us in that family which the Apostle
speaks of, that the whole and every part thereof is named, or has its renown
and authority only of, and from the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, as Paul
affirms to the Ephesians, as being of no other but of his true and proper
offspring, so as to make a difference of the sons of God (none excepted) as
one being of greater eminency, birth, breeding, or excellency, then another, is
to cast reproach upon that one only father of whom every one is named that
appertayns to that family, as though he were not of like power and glory, with
respect unto them all; or as though he changed his act in producing of his only
son, which tends to nothing else, but to make the seed of the bond-wman heir
with the seed of the promise, and guil efully to give the wicked interest in
the promise, whereas the word of the curse is only their inheritance.

But the children of this offspring having the name of this one Father called
upon them, or they called by his name holy and blessed for ever, every one as a
firstborn of God, bearing his name and authority, is King, Priest, and Prophet
(by virtue thereof) in the family, and there cannot be any inferior among
such, as to whom God communicates himself in the whole offspring; nor can one
be in account and reckoning before another, For of his own will begat he us
by the word of truth, that we should be the first fruits of him, who is no
less then the eternal father.

So that it is impossible that this Eldership should appear, and not be
anointed with the holy oil, for it is their proper patrimony and birthright,
and therefore they ever appear invested therewith, which ever carries in it
the same virtue of healing this sick party in all ages and times of the world;
and a like miraculous recovery and restoration, wherever they are called for
by the spirit of true interpretation or prophecy; for they cannot withold,
but must impart to every one in the family that which themselves are blessed
withal: For none can know what is the right of the firstborn of God, and be
possessed therewith, but he must freely impart it to every one in the family.

For the Spirit of Christ is ever like it self in all ages, only men deceive
themselves by mistake of the variety of figures, wherein God in one Christ, or
holy annoynting commends himself unto us, doting upon the shadow wherein the
substance is wrapped up as under Moses vale, and they see it not, nor can
endure the glory and shine thereof

But to whomsoever Christ unveyles himself, he imparts whole and complete
salvation to every one, else it cannot be the salvation of God; for he, or it,
cannot be divided, and therefore the holy unction is alike shed forth to every
one in this Kingdom: and they that have it, must of necessity annoint every
one into whose fellowship they are called, according to the nature of the call
of this sick party, if they be Elders, having it by right of inheritance, of
whom it may be said, Thou art my son, this day have I begotten thee: For the
day wherein Christ is begotten, or the day of salvation, or of the Savior, as
the word will bear, is like the seventh day in the Creation, whereunto neither
evening nor morning are annexed, as to the rest of the days, for it is ever
the same where in the Son is begotten, even an eternal light or day: Therefore
this Eldership knowing it to be the birthday of the Son of God, in that
resurrection of the dead, they cannot withold the whole Kingdom, nor any
privilege, prerogative, or royalty thereof, from any one that appertayns or
belongs thereunto.

The use and benefit of the holy unction therefore is not yet ceased, for then
the kingdom of God should cease; for all things in it that ever were, are, or
shall be in it taken and understood according to the mind of God, are of the
same duration that the kingdom it self is, which must be as ancient as the
King himself. But the carnallizing of the word of God in that and all things
is ceased unto us, according to the Leviticall services, the Kingdom and
Priesthood thereof holding no proportion with the Kingdom and Priesthood of
our Melchisedech: For men may as well go about to divide the Red Sea, with a
material rod or wand, as to pour oil upon a sick body, to give him health
and forgiveness of sins: Let us know therefore, that such as trade in
material oil, water, bread, wine, gestures and vestments, they are such as
serve in the oldnesse of the letter that kills its subjects, and not in the
newness of the spirit which gives life to them that are exercised therein: And
to make a difference between the histories of Christ and his Apostles, as being
more clear, and to be practiced in the letter, then the histories of Moses and
the Prophets, it is a mere trick and device to deceive the world; for the one
has as great a veil upon it as the other, and needs the same spirit of
interpretation to open it; For Christ himself uttered his mind in parables,
and without a parable (says the Text) spoke be nothing. We conclude then, that
every Saint of God having received that spirit of antiquity which only makes an
Elder or Governor in the kingdom of God; without which, no true Saintship or
holiness, being a spirit of Princely rule, dominion, undaunted courage and
fortitude in the things of God, whatsoever he may appear to be in the eyes of
the world, and judgment of men, yet he is one that sheds forth the holy oil,
having the materials of which is consists, and skill to compose the
ingredients, according to the device of wisdom, or that word of God which he
pours out in prayer and prophecy, to the healing of the sick, strengthening of
the weak, quickening of the dead, and acquitting of the soul from the guilt of
sin, in all such who find themselves dead unto all such things as men
naturally live unto, as they are the proper offspring of the earthly man: and
these Elders do ever acknowledge as great an excellency, and no less miraculous
act in him that receives the unction, as in him that pours it out; for none but
the firstborn of God (whose right it only is) can receive it, nor can any of
less authority, or more inferior offspring shed it forth.

Object. But some will say, That this doctrine denies that order set in the
society of mankind, consisting of superior, and inferior.

Answ. To this we answer; that the order set in nature in point of sex, age,
gifts, place, etc. they are all as significant intelligencers of higher, and
more noble and durable things; for as it was in the creation of all things in
the beginning, so it is now in this point, there being respect had unto
mankind in every particular work of Gods* hand, for whose use and service they
were all created, and he the last, as being the end and scope of them all, who
was indeed that Microco sinus in himself as the very sum and Epitomy of them
all: Even so man in himself considered, or with respect unto any creature, act,
or thing, unto which he may stand in any relation whatsoever to things in heaven
or in earth, he has therein a proper respect unto the Son of God, Jesus
Christ, poynting at, and leading unto him, even as all other creatures had a
proper aspect upon mankind for whom they were made: and whenever the thing
taught by (which is the Son of God) appears, who is the truth and substance
of them all; then the shadows fly away, and are of no more validity nor value
to a knowing and enlightened mind, which carries some resemblance of the body
and substance, but holds no weight, value, or considerable worth with the same;
therefore when ever Christ appears, who is the end and substance of the law,
then does the letter betake it self to its respitillian wings, and is no more,
in point of any account or reckoning with the sons of God, who weigh and
measure all things according to that law of the spirit of life which is in
Jesus Christ.

For the unity and conjunction of God and man simply considered, is that real
and substantial Chaos, or unformed thing, taught unto us by that in the
beginning, which no mind or heart of man can so light up it self as to give a
comely form unto the same, or deck it with ornaments pleasing unto a mere
Creature, that is, that God should be made man, and become a creature, who is
the Creator of all things; or that man being a creature, should be made the Son
of God, he that creates all things, without whom nothing is made.

Now the wisdom of the spirit of God brooding upon this deep, as in the
beginning, brings forth all the ornaments of Christ in his unity, offices,
virtues, relations, and operations whatsoever, who indeed is that Microcosmus,
furnished and adorned with all those super-eminent excellencies and glory of
the son of God, being that world whereof his kingdom does consist, which is
the world to come, or else it could not be happiness unto the inhabitants
thereof, if it were not to come as really as now it is: For as he was before
the earliest time that can be reckoned, or retreated, and fallen back unto,
even so he will be, or is to come, beyond the latest hour that ever can be
marched unto hereafter.

And in this Chaos drawn out unto these ornaments, and beautified with these
honourabe and eternal virtues in Christ, the order of God, or the God like
order does consist, who is that God of order, and not of confusion; and the
most eminent and strictest order in the worlds account, besides this, is real
confusion: Yea, that Babylon the great, the mother of harlots, which the
Scriptures forewarns us of: and this order arises, and is drawn out of the
Chaos of God and man being made one, through that wisdom or spirit of the
creature brooding upon the same deep of the said Chaos, drawing it out into the
lines and lineaments proper to the principles and capacities of a creature,
wherein the letter of the word does consist, adorning it self with the
excellencies and abilities of the creature, and not of God the Creator; in
which respect it is said to be a house of man's building, and not of Gods: And
this is the proper order and reformation of the world, stood for, and
maintained to this day by Schools, Libraries, and Records, by Art, study, and
Law; by policy, experiments, and force of arms, unto which the most eminent and
sublime order and institution of the wisdom and spirit of God, are as a
formlesse Chaos, and most dangerous gulf: and this wisdom or device of man
has arguments according to its proper sphere it works in, as punctual and
proper for the conservation and binding over of it self unto destruction, as
the wisdom of God has in that way of Christ, for the laying down of his life
unto salvation.

We thwart not then the order and instinct of any creature, but give it its
proper due for which it was made, which is either to give intelligence, by
breathing out its proper life in the souls of the Saints, in directing unto
another in whom the order of heaven and earth, which abides for ever is
established, or else to retayn its own proper life, which is earthly, in the
expiration of the life of the spirit of God, whereby it becomes a builder of
the tower of Babylon, the one receives instruction from the world, in the
expiration of the life of it in himself, it becoming as a crucified, and dead
carcass unto him, whereby he is made alive unto God; and the other receives
instruction from the kingdom of God, in the expiration of the life of all the
things thereof in himself, so as it is made by his wisdom, as a crucified and
dead thing unto him, whereby he is made alive unto the world, and the things
thereof, adorning and supplying of himself with the arm of flesh, and so
becomes as truly Satanicall, as the Saints become holy and godly. It is no more
wrong therefore to look upon the glory and goodlinesse of man, as the flower of
grass, or thing of naught; when Christ was made manifest, then it was wrong to
the rest of the creatures, when man was made as Lord of them all; which before
that, the bruit beast of the field might seem to have dominion of the earth.

Those therefore that would have the shadows of the night to retayn some
excellency in their place, and not to fly away when that Sun of righteousness
arises, and shows forth himself. Let such make their opinion good unto the
world, by retayning of like delight in, and having like esteem of such rattles
and baubles in the time of their Seniority, as they delighted themselves with
in the days of their minority, and so much in answer to the objection.

3. The third point is the practice of the Elders, and that is the manner how
they annoint the sick party, and that is in the name of the Lord, or into the
power and authority of the Lord Christ; for by this unction we are gathered up,
and are all drunk into one spirit of Jesus Christ: So that men may as
fittingly preach the wisdom of man to be no better then the understanding of a
bruit beast, as to teach that the spirit of a Christian is inferior to the
wisdom of God in Christ, for they are one, as the wisdom of man is one.

Therefore the actions of a Christian spring from the proper Edicts and
Institutions of God according to the law of faith, with respect unto those
relations and operations established between God and man in Christ, or in the
unction, and not from those relations and respects which natural instincts and
humane wisdom has founded and set up between creature and creature, which the
beasts of the field, and fowls of the air are for the most part inclinable
unto, as well as mankind: So that there is something that is proper unto God
only, that is a relative in all the actions of a Christian, or else it is not
done by the law of faith, which stands in all terms of relation between God and
man, and not between creature and creature: and thereby is every Christian made
Lord of all, which otherwise they could not be; for by this means no creature
can lay claym unto them, but they are only the Lords, the obligatious standing
only between God and man, in that law of faith or subsistence of God and man in
one, by the unction, which is Christ.

Secondly, the actions and demeanors of a Christian, have in them the effect of
Gods power and authority, as well as spring from such a root; so that they
prove fruitful, either to be a savor of life unto life, or of death unto
death. The doctrine, ways, and counsel of a Christian have a certain virtue
of God in them to produce life unto life unto them that are saved, or to work
life in life (as the word may be read) in others; for they bring forth in the
chosen of God a life which has all manner of liveliness infolded and wrapped
up therein; for as the wisdom of God is said to be a manifold wisdom, so is
the life of God a manifold life, which can never be unfolded and made manifest
unto the uttermost, for then it were not infinite and eternal: So that if the
Gospel bring forth and produce the life of Faith, it has the life of hope in
it, and in all things that can be hoped for; which as they are obtained, every
one is as a tree of life: If it produce love, there is wrapped up therein the
life of the love of all lovely relations, as Father, Son, Husband, Wife, love
of all kinds of friendship, and the like; If it bring forth the life of joy,
there is wrapped up therein the life of all joyful things; in the life of
prosperity there is the life of all prosperous ways: so that whatsoever the
Gospel works in the soul, there is involved therein all of that kind that ever
can come into use and exercise; so that it is a bundle of life which none but
the wisdom of God and the power of God can ever bind up together, or bring
forth.

Again, if a Christian or the Gospel (for they are co-apparent, and were never
one without another) produce and bring forth death in any, it is death unto
death, or (death in death) there is one death involved and wrapped up in
another unto eternity, which can never be found out to the uttermost, and yet
no particular way of death does ever assuage from the height and extremest
terror of it, nor stand aside, as to permit an intermission, but only so, as
to give way or being in another, to exercise its virtue in the full force and
terror thereof: So, as the King of fear changing his countenance in point of
wrath, may give the greater onset, and breed a fresh and unexpected trouble and
terror in the soul, that it shall never be inured or acquainted with any
particular terror, so as to abate the present sense of a heavy and infinite
displeasure, which nothing but Gods power and authority in that way of the
Curse can possibly bring to pass; therefore this unction invests into the
effect of Gods power and authority, in that way of his Son Christ Jesus our
Lord, and therefore he brings in the royal effect and power of prayer in the
next place.

Verse. 15. And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall
raise him up: and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.
Wherein observe for order;
1. What manner of prayer this is, and that is, the prayer of faith. 2. The act
or power of it what it does, and that is threefold. 1. It saves the sick, it
has the power of salvation in it. 2. It raises up as from the dead: And the
Lord shall raise him up. 3. It has in it the power of pardon: If he have
committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.

FIrst, for the manner of prayer here used, and that is, The prayer of faith,
for that only is this healing prayer, it has the virtue of health in it.

By Faith then, we are not to understand a notional perfection, as having
Christ only as the object of it, as the common opinion is, but we are to
understand it as the Apostle defines it; namely, that i^ is the Hypostacis, or
subsistence, not only of things unseen and hoped for, but also in present
being, and demonstration; for so much our Apostle affirms of it, that it is the
subsistence of things hoped for, and the demonstration of things not seen;
that is, it is the present being of things that are also to come, for they are
unto eternity: and it is a demonstrative argument (as the word there signifies)
which makes things to be in present appearance that yet are not seen; for the
depth of Gods counsels can never be sounded, but are infinitely as a treasury
to be brought forth, which things are not made good, but only in the Son of
God, who only can say, Before Abraham was, I am, and yet am to come: So that
prayer consists not of a request made by a mere creature unto the invisible
God: But it is an appeal made by the Son of God, who consists of humane nature
and divine (as the common phrase is) God and man as one simple act,
undissolvable, and eternal creation.

Therefore it is said, that we know not how to pray as we ought, but the spirit
it self makes intercession for us. Now there is no spirit of God
considerable, disjoined from the spirit of man, no more then there can be a
Christ destitute of humane nature; therefore it is said, That he that is joined
unto the Lord is one spirit: For God and man in Christ are never separated, no
more then the Father and the Son can be divided, for they are but one estate
and condition in which the wisdom of God, together with all his proper and
native excellencies do consist: So that there is no Christ or Anointed
considerable, but as consisting of divine and humane nature, or aptitudes to do.

Therefore the spirit of God makes request, but it is with groanings or sighs
which are proper unto man: and they are said to be sighs not utterable,
because there is in prayer a sighing or breathing out of life, as the last
breath, never to be resumed or taken in again in regard of that spirit living
to any carnal or corruptible thing, and this is a thing can never be uttered
by any unbeliever, for they never sigh, as sending out their last breath, in
regard of ever living again to the law of the flesh, therefore not utterable by
any that is destitute of the spirit of God.

Again, there is a sigh in prayer as being the last breath, and utter cessation
of life in the men of the world, which is never resumed or taken in again, and
that is the breathing out of the life of the spirit in the wicked, never to
live unto God, in any spiritual or heavenly virtue proper to the Son of God,
of which there is an utter dissolution and cessation in the men of the world,
and this is unutterable also, for it can never be uttered or expressed in the
state of Christianity, where the spirit of Christ resides and dwells; and the
prayer of faith cannot be expressed but with respect unto these twayn; the one
is life lost in the Saints; that is, the life of the flesh, but it is extant in
the men of the world, which is no less then that spirit of Satan, or that
dying life of the Devil, and this gives demention unto that from which we are
ransomed and delivered: and the other is life lost in the men of the world, but
extant in the Saints of God, which is no less then the life of the Son of God,
that holy one or (Saint of Israel) and this gives demention unto that whereunto
we are delivered, and whereunto we are brought.

It is not a part therefore, but whole Christ that makes an appeal in prayer,
namely from that which the Son of perdition is, unto that which the Son of God
is: and of such extention and comprehension is true prayer, or else it is not
that prayer of faith which is effectual; nor can it be said otherwise to be
that spirit of intercession which interposeth it self, and comes between that
depth of death, and that height of life, as in the participation of them both,
as being freed from the one, and set in the other, that is, Death, as God is
considered, what he is, through that wisdom of the creature in that man of
sin, and life, as man is considered in the wisdom of God, in that man of God
the Lord our Righteousness, the Saints therefore can truly say, Out of the
deeps have I cried unto thee O Lord: and in that acknowledgment confess
themselves to be set upon the mountain of Gods holiness, though it be
paradoxicall unto the world.

Quest. But if whole Christ be the supplicant, God and man, to whom then does
he appeal, to himself or to another.

Answ. Not to another, as in point of reallity of subsistence and being, for it
is one that pleads, and also gives Judgment, and determins the cause; But he
prays unto another, with respect unto the reallity of the distinction of
glory, for supplication and answer are truly twain in the same hypostasis, for
the glory of the supplicant is one, and the glory of the suppleo is another,
and these give being each to other, else they are not nor can subsist, for
either of them cease to be without its relative, so that prayer must consist of
them both, else it cease to be prayer, for the supplicant humbly prostrates
the cause in the necessity of, and with respect unto supply, which is the glory
of its office so to do.

And the suppleo yields relief, and supplies the necessity, and it is the glory
of its office so to do: and if either of these be wanting in a Christian
spirit, it subsists not, because it is not the spirit of the Son of God, in
whom is power to forgive sins, as well as to make supplication for pardon.

So that the glory of the speaker in prayer, or pleader of the cause before the
Judge of all the earth, is one real glory, and the glory of the sentence
passed thereupon, is another real glory, but both but one act of the law, the
glory of the speaker in prayer as Daniel calls it) is to open the cause,
holding plea upon true principles unto the point of issue, now Christ is the
end and issue of the law in all points of relation and causes depending between
God and man whatsoever.

Again, the glory of the Judge is to pass sentence, according to the law in
the point of issue, so that the cause pleaded, and Judgment given, is but one
act of the law, which is Christ; and in case either of these be wanting in a
Christian, he cease to be that law of the spirit of life which is in Christ
Jesus our Lordship, and is become that law of sin and death.

So that the party praying, and the party prayed unto, are one in point of
hypostacis and being, and the party or office of prayer, and the party or
office of hearing, or answering, are twain, in point of the variety in reallity
of glory, for God and man are completely in unity in them both, else Christ is
divided.

Even as it is said, that it is a more blessed thing to give then to receive,
which the Apostle affirms to be the saying of Christ, though we find no such
place in Scripture, in so many words; so that it may seem that the whole Gospel
or speech of Christ is summed up therein, namely in giving and receiving, as he
says to his Disciples, in sending them out to preach, freely you have received
and freely do you give; so that it is a more blessed thing to give then to
receive; that is, it is another thing, a further glory, a various virtue in the
Son of God, as if he should say, it is a blessed thing to receive; moreover,
or furthermore, it is a blessed thing to give, for the one is the blessing of
giving, and has its real and peculiar blessedness really consisting therein,
and the other is the blessing of receiving and has its real and peculiar
blessedness really consisting therein, and one of these cannot be without the
other, for no giver without a receiver, and no receiver without a giver, and
each of them has whole Christ exercised therein, that only blessed one; and
therefore as the hearingeare, and the seeing eye are both alike of the Lord, so
it is true of giving and receiving, and the difference stands only in the
variety of glory, even as in the three witnesses that bear record in heaven, no
other disproportion can be found.

For a natural man can neither perceive so as to give, nor effect so as to
receive the things that are of God, for they are spiritually to be discerned,
and apprehended, and said hold of, for none knows the things of God but the
spirit of God, no more then any other creature can know the spirit of a man but
only he that is of his own kind.

And it is the Son of God only that knows the father, and it is the Son only
that reveals him, for no man knows the father but the Son, and he to whom the
Son reveals him.

We conclude then, that prayer consists of whole Christ, and that both in point
of petition, as also in the answer, otherwise it is not this prayer of faith:
and therefore it is, that prayer is of that validity and force as to do such
mighty things as are here attributed unto it. As

First saves the sick, it has the virtue and power of salvation annexed unto
it, which can be ascribed unto nothing but unto Christ alone, who never was nor
can be known but in the exercise of an office, for it is the virtue and power
of the spirit of God that makes manifest the Son of God, and it is he alone
that saves, for he has salvation.

Therefore it is said, deliver my soul from the sword, my darling, or as the
word signifies, my alonely soul (as having no copartner) from the power of the
dog, and it is he that comes meek and lowly, as the Prophet Zachariah says,
saving himself, and not another; for as the father and the Son are one, so is
the Lord and the Disciple one; the Savior and the saved are one, else Christ
should not be Godman.

Salvation then is in prayer, as the Scriptures testify, and the time is come
that every one, or whosoever call on the name of the Lord shall be saved; many
teach that salvation is only by faith, that neither know what faith nor
salvation is, for faith has salvation in it only as it is, that hypostacis
and subsistence of the Son of God; and so Paul teaches faith without works;
that is, without the works of the law, which he calls dead works, because the
life and spirit of the Son of God is not in them: but our Apostle James
ascribes salvation unto works, and declines faith, as being the belief of
devils; that is, such faith as has not the powerful operations of God working
in and together with it, so that there is complete salvation in any proper work
or operation of the Son of God, as well as in faith; therefore Christ
concludes, that the great work and operation of God to be in faith, for faith
is not without the works of God, nor the works of God without faith.

We are also said to be saved by hope, as well as by either faith or work,
there is salvation also in love, for it is the fulfilling of the law: and where
the law is complete and full, there can be no condemnation, but perfect
acquittance and salvation; yea God is love, and he that dwells in love dwells
in God, and God in him, which cannot be without salvation; yea salvation is in
patience, for he that continues to the end shall be saved, so that we are saved
by it.

Furthermore we are saved by wisdom; for the poor man by his wisdom saves the
whole City of God, though his wisdom be despised, and his words not heard by
the wise of the world.

And to conclude this point, salvation is in prayer, it saves the sick, because
it is the subsistence of the mediator-ship of the Son of God, which is ever one
and the same, where, when, or in whom-soever it appears, although it be so
little in use, and so lightly accounted of in these days wherein we live.

Secondly, it has in it the virtue and power of the resurrection from the
dead, as it is said, the Lord shall raise him up: there is in prayer a
Lord-like authority, to rise out of that grave of sin and sorrow, of death and
destruction, so as none shall have dominion over it to keep it under, for it
cannot be held of death, but it will remove the stone from the Sepulcher, and
deface and break open the seal of Herod himself, though set upon it by the
chief Priests and Pharisees, making it as sure as they can; it will make the
house of the carnal Jews to shake, when the Apostles of Christ are gathered
together, or brought into unity and harmony by that reconciling spirit of
interpretation.

It will make the foundations of the Prison to shake, where the spirit of our
great Apostle is infringed, casting open the doors, and laying wast such power
to the astonishment of the Jaylors themselves, whoever they may be; yea it will
raise Peter up out of the dungeon, and cause his chains to fall off from his
hands to his own admiration and wonder.

In a word, prayer has in it the power and virtue of the resurrection, because
it is the breathing of the Son of God returned from death to life; this word
behold he prays, was an argument sufficient to prove Paul change from a Saul,
and to be risen up out of that grave and puddle of the Jewish, litteral, and
carnal worships, and from that deadly spirit of persecution which ever
accompanies such manner of services.

Thirdly, prayer has in it the power of pardon and forgiveness of sins; for
if he have committed sins they shall be forgiven him, or in the present tence
as the word will bear, they are forgiven him; that is, to every one that
partakes in this prayer of faith.

To commit sin here is to be understood in a twofold respect, that is
negatively, and affirmatively, of which the breach of law being sin, does
consist; now to sin, and prove a delinquent in omitting, and not doing that
which is required, is to neglect and leave undone that which the carnal
commandment according to the strict spirit of a Pharisee calls for; such sin,
or missing of the rule of the carnal commandment standing in outward
ordinances is here to be understood, which is the only sin condemned by a
carnal Jew, and this law the prayer of faith does rout, ravell, undo, and
abrogate, with respect unto the obligation thereof in the true intent of a
Pharasaical Jew.

And against this law does true prayer sin, in all its supplications,
intercessions, and requests; for the prayer of faith observes not in the least
in any point, that law of the spirit of bondage, which only obliges to the
law of the flesh, nor can it keep and perform that spirit of enmity which
Christ Jesus nails to his Cross and slays in himself, and therefore a sin
in a Saint, in way of negation, against the affirmative part of the law of the
flesh.

Again, there is a sin committed affirmatively, and that is by real acting
and doing, according to the law of the spirit of life which is in Christ Jesus
our Lord, which the wisdom of man in that carnal law forbids, and that under
the penalty of error, schism, heresy, pride, blasphemy, and death it self.

For every point of the law of the spirit rightly composed according to the
prin ciples and grounds of faith, is most heinous, wicked, detestable, sinful,
and abominable in the eyes of a carnal man.

Now the breach, disannulling, and abrogating of the carnal command (for which
the Jews so hated Christ) is the truth of the matter, the reality, and ever
carries in it the remission, pardon and forgivenes of sins in the Saints, as
surely as the breach of the law of the spirit, and that everlasting Covenant of
God carries in it, guilt, crime, and is the condemnation of the world.

For every sin and blasphemy against the Son of man (that is, against the
wisdom, will, power, and authority of the arm of flesh) shall be forgiven, or
it is forgiven, for it has the acquittance, general discharge, and release in
it self: but he that speaks aagainst the holy spirit, that is, against that law
of the spirit, or spiritual estate of that holy one of God, it shall never be
forgiven; that is, he that breaks the law of the spirit, in any word, or thing,
as the phrase imports, it has in it that guilt which can never be wiped out,
neither in this world, that is, in time present, nor in the world, or time,
that is to come; or not in this world, that is, in the conscience of the party
so made guilty; nor in the world to come, that is, in that sentence of the
righteous Judge which does for ever adjudg and condemn it, so that as the
breach of the spiritual law has in it an eternal guilt unseperably and
enevitably fastened unto it and accompaning the same, even so has the breach or
abrogation of the carnal law, an everlasting pardon, and acquittance before
God fastened unto and ever accompaning the same.

Note in this point that the Levitical law which the Apostle apposeth to the
law of an endless life, does not condemn, because men fall short in some
particulars of the fulfillment of the same, but it condemns, and is death unto
him that walks according to the same, or lives thereafter.

Therefore our Apostle says, If ye live after the flesh ye shall dye; that is,
if ye live according to the law of the carnal commandment, for by it no
flesh can be justified; or if ye mind the things of the flesh; that is (as
the word signifies) if ye frame, form, or fashon things unto your self
according to the carnal command, art, or reason of man, concerning the affairs
of God, it is death; but to live after the spirit; that is, the law of the
spirit, or spiritual law is life and peace; or to mind the things of the
spirit, that is, to form, frame, and fashion things spiritually, that is life
and peace; and as the one of these is sin according to man's wisdom, and his
accounts, even so is the other sin according to Gods wisdom, and his reckoning
and account, judgment, and doom passed upon it by an eternal and unchangeable
sentence.

There is pardon then, and power of forgiveness in prayer, because it is God
that sits upon that throne of grace judging unto justification, who then
shall condemn? for it the spirit of grace and supplication, whereof prayer does
consist, yea it is the Son of God who is justified? who then shall lay any thing
to the charge of Gods chosen, that holy one of God?

For wherever the spirit and virtue of Christ is, there is power to forgive
sins; therefore he says (to stop the mouth of those legal Pharisees) whether
is it easier to say, thy sins are forgiven, or to say take up thy bed and
walk, but that you may know that the Son of man has power to forgive sins on
earth; therefore I said unto thee, arise, take up thy bed and go thy way into
thine house.

So that to preach the Gospel to the restoration of the soul from the policy;
that is, from the fear, terrors, and tremblings of the law, as at Mount Sinai,
to bring it unto Zion, giving strength to take up that and carry it unto its
proper place, as that man carried his bed into the proper place, which is his
house, which before had carried him extravagantly, and diseasedly abroad;
wheresoever the Gospel exercises its power to raise up any to walk in the way
of God, before others, in prayer or prophecy, or any appointment of God
according to the nature and season of it, as that man is said to walk before
them all to their admiration; wheresoever the Gosplel is ministered to that
effect, there is also in that ministration power to forgive sin, for the one is
of like case, and of like difficulty as the other is, yea they are both in one
act; for he that can preach the Gospel to carry sin into its proper place
(which must be done or else the Gospel is not truly preached) he must of
necessity remove it from the chosen of God, which is the true remitting and
passing of it over unto another.

He that has power therefore to preach the Gospel to the healing of the
Conscience of the palsy, sickness, or tremblings of the law in the dead works
thereof, or works of death, that man has power to forgive sins on earth, for
they are inseparable, and Christ in that place alluded unto, makes them one;
for first he says, son thy sins be forgiven thee: and in the rehearsal of it
he says, his speech was, arise take up thy bed and walk, go thy way into thy
house.

And we know that Christ says to his Disciples, whose sins ye remit they are
remitted, and whose sins ye retain they are retained: And again, what ye bind
on earth is bound in heaven, and what ye loose on earth, is loosed in heaven:
to walk and work therefore in the things of God according to the power intended
by the word of God, are of greater concernment then they would think; for to
preach the Gospel, in the revelation of the mind and will of God as to an
only Son, or to present our supplications to God as a father from the mind
and disposition of an only son, are of no less authority and power then to to
give sins; for to pray with the spirit, and to pray with the understanding
also; that is, to pray according to the mystery of Christ's meditation, and yet
with that wisdom and skill of expression, as to unfold and explain it in the
minds of others, that they may ascend up unto God together therewith, as
Manoa's Angel in the flame of the sacrifices; this, and to pardon sin, are of
like power skill, and, authority, and a like weight lies upon both to
whomsoever communicates in them.

For to pardon sin is not to change or alter the mind of God toward that
party, but to explain and interpret the mind of God concerning that party,
which mind and will of God is the same in that one faith of the Son of God to
all the chosen of God, and wheresoever it is rightly unfolded and made manifest
in the proclamation of peace and reconciliation of God and man in one; if the
Son of peace be there, he accepts and receivet the same as the right of his
inheritance.

If the Elders pray or prophecy unto health therefore, they pray or prophecy
to the remission of sins, in whomsoeve, commucates in the same, his sins are
forgiven him.

To conclude this point, it concerns us, then to know what sin is, that we may
rightly conceive of it, as it is pardonable, and also as it not pardonable, for
there is a sin (says the Apostle John) which is not unto death, or which is
not in death, that is, it is not in that way of death; and there is a sin that
is in death, I do not say that you shall pray for it; that is, you shall not
pray for the pardon of it, because it is not to be pardoned; for where Christ
is once crucified in the spirit, he never is to live in that heart according to
the spirit, no more then where he is once crucified in the flesh, he never
lives in that heart according to the flesh.

Therefore in the next place he exhorts us unto the confession of our faults,
in the true acknowledgement of them one to another.

Verse. 16. Confess your faults one unto another, and pray one for another,
that ye may be healed; the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man
avails much.
In these observe,
1. An exhortation consisting of two parts, 1. To confess faults one to
another. 2. To pray one for another.
2. The end wherefore; That ye may be healed. 3. A reason, ground, or cause
drawn from the nature of prayer, which is twofold. 1. It is effectual. 2. It
is fervent.
4. The quality of the person praying; that is, A righteous man. 5. The issue
or event of such prayer; It avayleth much.
1. ANd first for confession of faults, sins, or oberations from a law; For
where no law is, there is no transgression, for sin is the transgression of a
law, or as the word is, the withoutnesse of a rule.

Now there is the law of the flesh, or carnal commandment, which is the law
of sin and death: and there is the law of the spirit, or power of faith,
which is the perfect rule of righteousness, or law of the spirit of life in
Christ Jesus.

Now the carnal commandment or perfunctory and fading ordinances may be
broken, yea abrogated and nailed to the cross, as that which is against us,
and yet forgiven; for every breach or piercing through of the son of man;
that is, man's institutions and appoyntments composed by that carnal law, shall
be forgiven, or are forgiven; for the disannulling of man's wisdom, and in that
respect to become a fool, is the establishment of Gods wisdom, in the
removal of all guilt and condemnation from the soul.

And there is the law of the spirit, or of that holy Ghost, which if a man
speak a word against intentionally, or blaspheme and pierce through; that is,
abrogate or make a nullity of it, It shall never be forgiven neither in this
world nor in the world to come; that is, neither in the present mind and
conscience of him that so does, nor in that holy mind and judgment of Christ,
from passing sentence against it, being so remote, and at such a distance from
it, and contrary unto it; for the abrogation of the law of the spirit is no
less then to disannull that wisdom of God in Christ; by which device only the
sin and guilt of the sons of men is taken away, and no other way, for
elsewhere the redemption of the soul cease for ever.

Confession of sins then one to another: This phrase one to another is of like
nature, as when Moses cast down his rod on the earth of Egypt, it became (or
as the word is) it was to a Serpent; when it was on the ground, it was a
Serpent, a quite contrary thing then when it is in his hand, or Ministry; the
one declaring the Dragons fury, in that government of Pharaoh in Egypt, and
the other that rod or scepter in the rule of Christ, as that Shepherd and
feeder of Israel, as the word rod signifies a Scepter.

So that when we confess sin, that is, the breach of the law of the spirit in
the world, through the observation of the carnal command, where Christ is
bereaved of all his proper virtues and operations of his spirit, it is unto
another; that is, that state is become another thing (as Moses rod was) then
the son of God; for it is that son of perdition, even Satan himself, though
under the figure of an Angel of light, in the eye of the men of the world.

Again, when we confess sin; that is, the breach or abrogation of the law, or
carnal command, that Christ is bereaved and dispoyled of all glory, power, and
virtue of the arm of flesh: so that his own arm saves and gets the victory, not
by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, says the Lord of hosts. We confess,
this sin against the carnal command, unto the unity of the spirit, and the
fulfilling of the law of Christ, or of that rule of righteousness that is by
faith in him, which is to another; that is, to another thing, state, and
condition then that of the letter that stands in outward observations,
temporary engagements, and performances, and this is that one and alone good
thing desirable, that Christ of God that carries and abides for ever.

To confess sin therefore, or to make profession of any thing; that is, to
praise or acknowledge it, is to give the thing its nature and properties unto
the utmost extent, and so it must be here to an utter contrariety, vast and
perpetuated distance of the law of the flesh, and that of the spirit, otherwise
we contradict the command of God, by plowing with an ox and an ass together,
by wearing a garment of linen and woollen, and by sowing our field with two
kinds of seed.

Quest. Here arises a necessary question; Whether in the acknowledgment of the
nullity of the law of the carnal commandment, unto that unity that is in
Christ, a Christian does not thereby reckon and acc^unt all the virtue of the
Son of God to be his own proper portion and patrimony, as also whether in
acknowledgement of the nullity of that law of the spirit unto the unity of the
harlot, he does not as necessarily reckon unto himself as his due and proper
right and inheritance, all those vicious abominations that rest and abide in
the bosom of that man of sin, which is Antichrist.

Answ. To which we answer, that there is a like truth and reality in the
acknowledgment of the one, as there is in the other, taken in a due respect, as
the mind of God commends the same unto us, where he says; So then with my
mind I my self serve the law of God, but with my flesh the law of sin. For a
Christian must be plain downright and real in his acknowledgments before God,
whether of sin, or of the fruits of righteousness, yea in the root and
original both of the one and of the other.

Object. But a Christian by faith professing the fruits of righteousness, and
fountain out of which they flow, is endewed with the life and spirit of them,
according to their native property in that blessed subject of Christianity,
else his confession of them is but as a fire painted upon a wall, or the
picture of a man carved out of wood or stone, that wants soul and spirit, the
ground of motion and operation.

For what is it to profess or acknowledge the love of God, unless it be
kindled in our hearts to a flame, that many waters cannot quench, neither the
world drown; or to confess the power of Christ, unless through him we be able
to do all things; or to praise the Kingdom, Priesthood, and prophetical
office of Christ, unless we have the power of rule, reconciliation, and
interpretation in us.

Will it not then also follow, that if he deal faithfully and sensibly in the
confession of sin, as that he has not the understanding of a man, that he
persecuted the Church of God; that he is the chief of sinners; that the
terrors of the Almighty are upon him; that out of the belly of Hell he cries
unto God, that he is shut up, and cannot come out. If he deal plainly in that,
and be real, will it not follow, that he has in him the vicious desire of the
flesh, the state of the Devil (if he be the chief of sinners) and partaker of
the terrors of Satan sensibly, if he cry out of the womb of hell; that if the
creature, man participate of joys celestial and eternal in confession and
acknowledgment of them: So the creature or man must partake of all abominations
of sin, and state and condition of the Devil, if he be real also therein,
in his acknowledgments.

Answ. We answer in the name of God, that no such consequence follows upon a
real confession of sin: But through the wisdom and device of God, it proves
an eternal separation of the spirit of a Christian from all such sins and
sorrows; justly and really acknowledged in and upon mankind, or that matter
whereof a Saint does consist; and this is proved by a true and real
distribution of man, or of the creature, according to the word of the Lord gone
out in the disposing of it, as a real subject of mercy and severity, of love
and wrath.

We are to take a man in a two fold respect according to the intention and
expression of the word of God, which rightly judges and determines all things.

1. As it speaks on this wise, All power is given unto him in heaven and in
earth, because he is the son of man.

Again, whether is it easier to say, Arise, take up thy bed and walk; or to
say, thy sins are forgiven, but that ye might know that the son of man has
power to forgive sins. So also, blessed is the man, or oh how happy it is, and
well for us, that man going right forward, not turning aside to the right hand
nor to the left: The Hebrew word Ashrei imports that simple and immixt
condition of man, which is only found in that man of God, Christ Jesus, who is
God blessed for ever, being that beginning, head, or fountain of the creation
of God, that new creature: and in this sense is man, or the Creature
considerable in the answer of this objection.

2. We are to take man also in another sense infinitely remote from this, where
it is said, man being in honor abides not but is like the beast that
perishes; and woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed it were good
for that man if he had never been born; also, if an enemy had done it I could
have born it, but it was thou Oh man, my familiar I speaking of the trechary of
Achitophel, and Prophesying of Judas, into whom Satan entered, which is that man
of sin, that Antichrist and deceiver, of which spirit and power there were many
in the Apostles time: but the Preisthood of our times have collected them into
one man only, and crowded him up only in that corner of the world called Rome,
that so notice may not be taken of their opposing and rejecting of Christ to
the deceiving of the people, as that spirit ever does into him, or into them.
Satan enters, or takes his beginning in them; for as the Son of God has no
beginning but in man, so Satan, or the Devil has no beginning, but in man,
even in that man of sin and son of perdition, for as the Scriptures give the
word of truth a being from the beginning, for in the beginning was the word,
even so it gives Satan to be a liar from the beginning, and one that abides not
in the truth: and this twofold esta^e man to be taken in, else know we not how
to acknowledge sin, nor how to praise God for our deliverance into those fruits
and happy estate of righteousness by Christ.

We answer then, that, when a Christian confesses, acknowledges, or praises
the excellencies of God in Christ, giving them their proper and full virtue and
extent, as love, joy, mercy, gentleness, kindness, bounty, power, and
eternal goodness, man participates thereof; the creature really and sensibly
possesses and enjoys them in the unfeigned and just confession of them; that
is, the man of God, the new creature, which is that work-manship of God in
Christ Jesus, and man-like Son of God, standing in that one alone sonship of
God not found extant but in Christ that anointed one.

But man, or the creature, that is, that man of sin, made to be taken and
destroyed, ungodlike men, that man of Beliall, that vain and empty man of
faith without works, of which belief the Devil is, yea that Antichristian
spirit, wherever it is, that molds the worship of God into a form, tying him to
appear in the same figure and posture: Again, we say that man or that creature
has no fellowship with the things proper to the Son of God, as peace, joy,
love, nor any of the fruits of the spirit, which are by Christ, he is a
stranger unto them all, and therefore intermeddles not with the joy of the
saints, though they be real, forceable, and effectual in the man of God, or
saint by calling, when ever they are uttred or expressed.

Even so there are the terrors of death, vexations of spirit, guilt of sin,
condemnatory sentence of conscience, that ever accompanies the sins confessed
by a Saint really beyond any shadow, or semblance, and that not bounded by
time, but are eternal; and yet the man or the creature, that is, the man of
God, or the new creature participates not in the least in any of their
distress, guilt, or fear, no more then the wicked partake in the joys of
salvation in Christ; he has no taint or tincture of the enmity of the Serpent,
nor sense unto pangs and vexation of the guilt of corrupt and defiled
conscience, and yet says truly and unfeignedly, this is my sin, this is my
death, and this abomination is in me; that is, in my flesh, or in that carnal
estate out of which I am taken, where dwells no good thing, but is a cage of all
unclean and abominable filthiness, and wickedness; So that in a true
confession of sin according to faith; not only it, but all its appurtenances
are carried forth and set upon their proper base; that is, in that land of
Shiner, which is Babylon, that confusion gone over all the earth, which is that
strict composure of things by man's wisdom, according to times, places,
persons, and temporary respects whatsoever, which makes a nullity of Gods
order, who is a God composed thereof, and all things therein are illimitted,
not any thing tied to time, place, person, or any temporary or fading bond
whatsoever, otherwise it is not the order of the Son of God, but a device and
inventions of man unto confusion, whether the Epha of wickedness is carried,
and is the house built for it where for ever it shall remain and abide.

Thither all sin and sorrow in true confession is carried, as fully as all
righteousness and peace is carried only into that happy estate and
incomprehensible order, that is, of God by Jesus Christ; the carnal mind, or
man therefore, is only sensible of sin, in the way os Gods displeasure, but
not of that virtue of reconciliation; and the spiritual mind, or man, is
only senfible of all righteousness in way of the peace of God, but not of
that horror which comes through that breach of the everlasting Covenant.

And yet is neither the one nor the other void of sense, with respect unto the
others condition.

For the wicked from the sight of the Saints being lifted up in that holy
unction, and taken into an everlasting reign and authority, by unity with an
omnipotent and all-sufficient power, are filled with fear, and terror at the
fight and apprehension thereof, as having the glory of a righteous Judge; also
the Saints of God beholding themselves lifted up, and taken out of that fearful
and abominable state and condition of the wicked, rejoice thereat with joy
unspeakable and full of glory; even as Noah, when he saw the waters over-whelm
and destroy the world, was by the same waters lifted up to heaven, as sase from
all rocks, mountains, or hills that might annoy him; so the Saints seeing how
the Son of God has given himself unto death in the world (never to live the
life of the Son of God in them) as a ransom, whereby he is lifted up unto the
throne of Gods glory in the Saints everlastingly, which carries with it a holy
shout, harmonious and melodious singing and rejoicing for ever, to see the
terrors of death captivated under eternal darkness, which can never seize nor
entrench upon that Sun of righteousness which shines in the saved of the Lord.

The second part of the exhortation is, to pray one for another, or appeal one
to another; the word for, and to, are indifferently taken, as you may see by
the difference of translations. One says, a Psalm for the sons of Corah; and
another says, a Psalm to the sons of Corah, so that here it is taken for one
to another; that is, in your confessions of the nullity and breach of the law
of the spirit by that wicked one; do you appeal to the law of the carnal
command which is of sin and death, which is thereby established and confirmed
in the world, whereby the men thereof are effectually bound over (under that
spirit of bondage) to walk and work according to the letter that kills, and to
emulate, decline, and reject (in all things) the spirit that gives life.

And at that Judgment Seat, behold the summoning in, and the assembling of all
sin in the fight of God, by the crucisication of Christ, together with the
manner of Gods execution of wrath for your acquittance and escape: For in that
throne is all sin summed up, as in that King of Tyrus, for corrupting the
wisdom and profaning the holy things of God, see Ezekiel. 28.

Again in the acknowledgement of the breach and nullity of the law of the
flesh, appeal to the law of the spirit, for it is the perfection and fulfillment
thereof; for the disjunction from all carnal and diabolical things, is the
conjunction of God and man in Christ, the crucification of Christ by the
ministry of the letter in the world, is the raising of him up from that death
in the ministry of the spirit, in the Saints, for it is impossible that the
Son of God should be held of death, so as not to live his proper and native
life.

If we expect unity with all the excellencies and virtues of God, we must be
loosned and disunited from all carnal relations and bonds, and we must either
have unity with all the things proper unto God, or none, for he cannot be
divided, therefore we must admit of a total separation from all carnal things;
that is, such as fade and have an end; however we know that all things are
lawful with due respect unto Gods call in the use of them, yet are we not to be
brought under the power of any thing as by a bond subjected unto it, but to use
the world as though we used it not, to marry as though we married not, and to
buy as though we possessed not, for the Son of God never acknowledged
conjugation, or copulation, by any carnal tie, or bond; therefore when his
mother told him at the feast, that they had no wine, he says unto her, woman
what have I to do with thee, mine hour is not yet come, as to have my works
and times set and appointed unto me by virtue of any earthly or temporary
relation, therefore she bids the servants look unto his time and his command,
saying, what soever he commands you, that do.

Where the force of earthly relations takes place of the spirit of Christ, that
state or place of honor shall never succeed well.

Again, when one told Jesus that his mother and his brethren stood without to
speak with him, he answered and said to him that told him, Who is my mother?
and who are my brethren? and he streched forth his hand toward his Disciples
and said, behold my mother and my brethren; for whosoever shall do the will of
my father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother,
all relations centred in one; also when his mother found him in the Temple
Questioning the Doctors, saying, why have thou thus dealt with us? behold thy
father and I have sought thee, sorrowing: but he answers, how is it that ye
sought me, wist you not that I must be about my fathers business? as
acknowledging none but that one father of eternity, and in such relations
stands the band of a Christian, and therein is the acknowledgement of his
engagements.

But from this point it will be gathered by carnal spirits as of old, then let
us do evil that good may come thereby, whose damnation is just; if this be
true, then let us endeavor to undermine, extirpate, root out, and bring to
naught all natural relations and consociations amongst the sons of men.

1. To which we answer, that no such consequence follows upon the spirit of
Christianity, for the abrogation of the law of the flesh is to repeal and
abolish it completely, and it confists of an affirmative and negative part; the
affirmative is to set up, adorn, and maintain all things honorable in the
fight of man, according to the nature, manner, and constitution of the place
where it is exercised, and to avoid and abandon the contrary shame, and this is
but one administration or law, for they are inseperably joined together, even
as the honorable sentence of the Judge of a Size unto death, and the shamesull
office of the hangman are but one administration; So that from the office of
the Judge, you bring in the office of the Hangman; and from the act of the
hangman, you include the office of the Judge, or else the law is not
completed in that point; right so in the abolishing and disannulling of the
law of the flesh, that it takes not hold as being any yoke or bond upon the
Saints, it is completely repealed and made void, both in respect of all things
that the world makes and accounts honorable, and likewise of all things that
are dishonorable and shameful in the same account; so that it becomes nothing
else but a provocation unto them, to guard and fortify themselves against the
one and the other, for they are one entire and undivided law or administration.

The Saints therefore cannot go about to establish that which they abolish (for
the shameful acts of the world are nulled unto them as well as the honorable)
no more then the wicked in making void unto themselves the law of the spirit,
can possibly go about to set up or advance the cross of our Lord Jesus in the
true virtue and power of it.

2. We answer, that to such a conclusion from our freedom from the carnal
command, or way of the letter of the Scripture, is to lay a hard thought and
deep censure upon the spirit and power of God; for shall the wisdom and
institutions of man that shall vanish and come to naught, have power in them to
provoke to diligence? to preserve in peace? to keep in temporance, chastity,
gravity, and moderation in all things? and shall not the spirit of God, or law
of that spirit be sufficiently wise and able to preserve men in modestety,
chastity, gravity, and moderation in all things? with wisdom, care, and
deligence to use the creature of what kind soever, according to time, place,
and occasion, as becomes the nature end and use thereof, without lisentious and
lascivious liberty? surely those that so judge never found nor felt the virtue,
life, liberty, and power of the spirit of our only Lordship, and salvation,
Jesus: Therefore the reason of our thus appealing follows.

Namely that ye may be healed.
The spirit of God makes this manner of appeal the possession to purge out all
superfluous humors, the sovereign salve to cure all deseases, the cordial
medicine against all crudities of soul, and peccant humors of spirit; this is
health to thy navell, and marrow unto thy bones: If when we see the breach os
the law of the spirit of Christ, we carry it unto the law of the flesh, and
observe how that is only established thereby: and when we observe the repeal
of the law of the flesh as made of none effect, we carry it up into the law of
the spirit, and know that it is established and confirmed for ever thereby.
This is the Medicamentosus, without which no prayer can be made acceptable unto
God; for if prayer confirm not the law of the spirit, it binds not over the
Lord to be our supply, if it comprize not his mercy within the bounds of its
proper place, which is Christ our boundless and common salvation.

This appeal or prayer must also confirm the law of the flesh, or else it
carries not all sin and sorrow into its proper place of abode, which is
Antichrist, or Satan that slayer of the Son of man from the beginning, even
as Caine slew his brother, because his own works are evil, and the works of
the Son of man good; and in these twain stands the health of our souls, and
is by them preserved for ever, viz. a place of the reception of all
wickedness, where it abides exercised in the curse for the acquitting of the
Saints for ever.

And a place of reception into righteousness, and residence of that blessed
estate of the Son of God in the love and delight of the father for ever, in
the just condemnation of all enmity.

The third point is the ground of this sound and healthful condition by this
appeal, or prayer; and first it is effectual, or forceable, without let or
hinderance; the appeal is made upon such grounds, as nothing can stop the
bringing of the cause thither, either for the stating of sin, or of
righteousness; of the curse in the confirmation of the law of the flesh, or of
the blessing in the law of the spirit of Christ in the one, and Antichrist in
the other.

No Supersedias can be sued out, no counter-command can be given, no
obstruction can be made, to stop or recall the stating of all abominations in
the exercise and practice of the carnal command, and all the virtues,
excellencies, and dignities of God in Christ in that law of the spirit; for
Satan the God of this world, which is the wisdom of the world, the subtilty of
the serpent, as he is a murder our from the beginning, in slaying and putting
to death the Lord of life and glory; so is he a liar, and abode not in the
truth; so is he sacrelegious, robing God of his glory, making himself to be
God, adulterating the word of God, turning the glory of God into shame, and is
the sole and proper opposer of God in all his excellencies; therefore nothing
can hinder, no law or evidence gainsay, but that state is the proper sinck and
center of all wickedness, and so of all wrath. Also in its appeal to the law
of the spirit, which is the proper order and composure of the Son of God, what
can obstruct but that in him are all those dementions of height, depth, length,
and breadth, of the goodness, mercy, truth, life, power, spirit, and love of
God for ever; therefore this prayer or appeal is most forceable and effectual,
it passes through without let or hinderance, for the performance of its work,
in rendering to each his right, in the perfecting of the cause of its appeal.

2. It is fervent, hot, without any intermixture of cold, the word signifies to
boil, which admits of no cooling thing to come there; such is the nature of
true prayer, it admits no chilly or cold thing to be cast into the love and
zeal of God in Christ, but finds the coals thereof to be fiery coals, yea to
have a vehement flame.

Neither can the spirit of prayer admit of any cooling mixtures in the fume and
heat of Gods wrath, in the wealthy of the world named above; for a fire is
kindled in mine anger which shall burn down to the nethermost hell.

But the Academists of our age, they know how to moderate the love of Christ in
those whom they call Saints, by some cold and decaying humor of the spirit of
the world; yet tradition is of that strength in them that they dare not impute
such to him that was borne of the Virgin: but for any sound knowledge they have
of him, they might as soon do it to him as any of that mystical body, and
would for advantage, if they had been brought up in Schools of such principles,
for they have nothing but what they receive from man.

Likewise they can cool Gods infinite displeasure against sin, with graduall
distinctions of it as good part in nature, some good works wraught, some
remainders of Gods image in the wicked, such sleights of Satan we skill not but
are confident; the path of fervent prayer never lay in that way, nor shall ever
be beaten out or found in it, by all those carnal and superstitious cuttings,
and fleshly launsings of the Priests of Baall, to uphold Ahabs Throne in all
the Statues of his Ancestor Omry.

The fourth point is the qualification of the person praying, and that is a
righteous man.

Now a righteous or just man is he, who gives every thing its proper right and
due, which appertains and belongs unto it; if we speak of any thing of God,
give unto it arise, arraign, and scope appertaining to God; if we speak of any
of the ordinances of God, give them the virtue, property, duration, and
continuance of the Son of God, who abides for ever, else we give not the Son of
God that great ordinance and fountain of all holy ordinances his right and
due, who is holy, spiritual, just and good, otherwise they are human and
perishing things, and we are found unjust in not giving Christ his due, the
spirit of prayer and this effectual appeal resides not there.

Again, if we speak of any thing as not having the Son of God in it, then
give it the spirit and power of the Prince of the air, the spirit that now
works in the children of unbeleif, or disobedience, for the scope and end of
all things is Christ, in the exercise of mercy in the faith of the Gospel, or
in the exercise of wrath in that way of Antichrist, for we know that we are of
God, and the world is of that wicked one, namely the Devil; therefore if we
speak of sin, give it its due, the guilt of making a nullity and falcification
of him that made all things in truth.

If we speak of sinners, give them the state and condition of their father the
Devil, whose works they do and will do.

Either clear the innocent whom God in Christ justifies once and for ever, and
so give them their due belonging unto them, and condemn the guilty, who reject
the manner and way of his acquitting of his Saints, or else no person
quallified for prayer; if you speak of death, bring it unto the scope, either
death unto all transitory and carnal things in Christ, or else death unto all
spiritual and durable things in Antichrist, or else we give not right unto it,
and so are not that righteous man whose prayer avails, and is the event and
issue of this prayer, which is the fifth point, that is, it avails much.

Now for prayer to avail much, is as much as if he said in more words, it
effects, accomplisheth, and brings to pass all things, even as not to avayl
is of none effect, worth, nor excellency: So it is said, Circumcision or
uncircumcision avayls nothing, but a new creature, that is all in all; for it
has the whole workman-ship of the Son of God in it. Observe the speech of
Haman, when he is nvited to the feast the Queen makes for the King, who calling
his wife and his friends, tells them of the glory of his riches, and the
multitude of his children, and all the things wherein the King had promoted
him; and how he had advanced him above the Princes and servants of the King.
Haman said moreover; yea Hester the Queen did let no man come in with the King
unto the banquet she had prepared, but my self, and to morrow am I invited
unto her also with the King; yet all this avails me nothing, so long as I see
Mordecai the Jew sitting at the Kings gate. A wicked Statesman cannot endure
Mordecai, which according to the etymology of the word is pure myrrh, or
myrrh of freedom, signifying the sweet liberty of the Gospel, for it is the
first of the chief spices in the annoynting oil, to show the Princely dignity
that is in the grace of the Gospel, that bows, nor is subject to any carnal
thing whatsoever; for there is but one primatus or summus which moves Haman try
Mastery with Mordecai, which shall be lifted up the highest. There is not the
most civilized man in the world, destitute of the spirit of God, put in place
of dignity, that can admit of the Cross of Christ, to have supremacy; for it
is as a moth to carnal pomp, declaring it to be enmity, therefore carnal
Kingdom must ever have carnal Priesthood to uphold it, by deifying of it,
and it rewards them with tithes and protection.

But Mordecai (the Jew inward in heart) will not be endured by Haman; for the
King represents a stranger won to the faith, as that Egyptian King which
acknowledged Joseph. So that nothing avayls, if Mordecai live, who is a worm
unto all Hamans honor, that nothing is had nor done unto him, till Mordecai be
taken out of the way: but to avail much, is to bring all things to pass, to
be, and to have the fullness of the souls desired, and empowered with virtue
and strength to perform and effect what heaven and earth can yield or deny to
any, and therefore an instance is brought of Eliah for the proof hereof.

Verse. 17. Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, etc.
In which instance or continued and persevering exemplary virtue, observe for
order these things.

1. The party instanced in, that is Eliah. 2. His condition; A man subject to
passion; together with the consimilitude, that is, as we are. 3. His act, that
is, He prayed. 4. The issue or effect of his prayer; It rained not. 5. The time
how long; that is, for the space of three years and six months. 6. The
renewing of his prayer, and the effect thereof; And he prayed again, and the
heavens gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit.
1. FRom the first, the party instanced in is Eliah; observe thus much, That it
pleases God to memorize the names of his Saints, by acts of honor which he
leads them through in the world. This is evident throughout the holy letters
written from heaven unto us, see an epitomy hereof in that 11. Chap. to the
Hebrews.

The ground of it is, because the acts of the Saints are the operations of
Christ: Now I live, yet not I, but Christ lives in me; which life is the root
of all their motion, and the memorizing of him is Gods aim and end in all his
ways and operations; he it is whom he will make higher then Agag, greater in
power and authority then all the Kings of the earth; His acts therefore must be
as monuments in the world, who ever is made mavelous in mercy, only in them
that believe: Therefore God makes them as monuments thereof, setting them as
Cities upon a hill, to whom all shall repayr for the richest merchandise; and
as beakens upon a high mountayn, who only can give warning of the approach of
the adversary: And as the lights of the world, without which no man can work;
however the Prophets and Apostles were under persecution, ignominy, and
disgrace in the time of their sojourning here; yet now where is the wise? where
is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world, but seeks to uphold and
honor himself by them? Yea, that very spirit that slew them, now builds their
Sepulchers, and says, If they had lived in their fathers days, they would not
have done as they did. Nay, God will register the names of his Saints in that
book of life, in whomsoever the life of Christ is, there they shall be
memorized, and set up by God as Standard-bearers in their generations; before
whom, if the enemy come in as a flood, the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a
Standard against him, and chase him away.

Wonderful is it to consider of this point, when we see so many have gone down
to the dust by plague, famine, sword, and not a name of them left upon record
in the world: but he that once comes within the volume of that spirit of
intercession, shall remayn engraven as in a precious stone upon the
breast plate, or heart-ornament of Christ Jesus, as a record or inscription of
blessed memory for ever.

Therefore the next words are brought in, viz. Is a man, or as the word will
bear, Is a thing, as the Apostle affirms; Henceforth we know no man after the
flesh; or as the word is (nothing:) So here Eliah is a man, or thing, a matter,
cause, condition, or deed, such as his name imports. Elijah, that is, my God
Jah, or my strong being, or the strength of my existance. Now if it be such a
one, or such a matter or cause, such a condition or deed brought in as
congruous to us, implying all the faithful; how can it be, but that name, or
that authority shall be memorized for ever: If a word of Samuel shall not fall
to the ground, a deed of our Eliah shall never be forgotten, when, or in
whomsoever it appears.

The second point is the state and condition of the party instanced in,
together with the consimilitude, that is, subject to passions as we are.
By passions here is meant sufferings, for so much the word imports; and to be
subject, is to be under; that is, under like sufferings that we are, that is,
the faithful in all ages.

Whence observe;

That the Saints of God are subject to like sufferings: they all alike endure
affliction, they all alike inherit the Cross; it is not said of any particular
man, or particular Church (limmed out by the spirit of man from some few
particular expressions or practices manifected in the Scriptures) but of all
the Sains of God that ever lived, or shall, viz. For thy sake are we killed all
the day long, and counted as sheep for the slaughter.

There is none of those several afflictions which the Saints of God have
undergone, but rightly understood, one of them is as extensive as another, and
it must needs be so; for the sufferings of the Saints is the Cross of Christ,
and not the cross of any particular creature, but of the son of God; therefore
he says, In all their afflictions he was afflicted: and therefore he says
also in the behalf of the believers and prayers in Damascus, Saul; Saul, why
persecutest thou me: Therefore it is, when the Corinthians seemed to cleave
one to one man, and another unto another, though all sound men and good; one is
of Paul, another of Apollo, another of Cephas, and another of Christ; that he
calls them carnal, because they take not every way or manner of the
administration of the grace of the Gospel, to be the same universally through
the whole body; what says he, Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you?
or were you baptized into the name of Paul? I thank God that I performed no
such particular act, but to such as understood the mystery of it, for that is
the effect of his speech, and cause of thanksgiving.

The ground of these particular and nominall Religions (as Independent,
Presbyterian, Anabaptist, Papist, Generallist, for they all stand on one root)
is, because they limit and infringe the grace of the Gospel, both in way of the
sentence of absolution and condemnation, mincing and fashioning things
according to the judgment or discerning of man, and not according to the light
and revelation of the Son of God: Hence they are affected with manlike
expressions, and so cleave unto man, and not unto the Son of God: and if the
mind of God be expressed unto them, they hammer it into their own shape, as the
Corinthians did, and so make rents and schisms.

Now the grace of the Gospel in whatsoever it expressed it self, as King or
Priest, Prophet or Victor, father or son, Master or servant, Lord or Disciple,
Apostle or follower) is as that leaven which the woman hid in three pecks of
meal, whereby the whole lump was leavened: or like that unction poured on
Aarons head, which run down unto the collar or hem of his garment; for the oil
contained in that honorable vessel of the Gospel fills completely all
vessels that are brought into unity or love with it. Of such nature and extent
are all things appertaining unto the Gospel, and so the afflictions of the
Saints, the Cross of Christ takes not its latitude nor longitude from the
dimentions of a creature, but holds correspondency with the son of God; for the
cross of Christ is of the same extent and continuation that his Crown and
kingdom is.

By this we may take notice of what nature the Cross of Christ is that it
stands not in, or consists of any temporary relation or operation of the
creature active or passive, but is the proper suffering of the son of God in
the wicked, as deprived of all livelihood and proper operations of the spirit
in all ways of motion and relation; and in the Saints, in being deprived of
all livelihood and proper operations of the flesh in all the ways of its
motion and relation.

It would seem a great cross to a man, if the world were vacant of a rational
spirit, and none but beasts to converse with: of no less, but infinitely
greater is the disproportion of the wisdom of God in a Christian, and the
wisdom of this world in the wicked; yea if they be as crafty as Achitophel, or
as subtle as the Serpent, the wisest beast of the field. Yea, in the world we
have lost our proper life, spirit, and power, and all virtue proper to a
Christian in point of heavenly things.

Further, it would seem a great affliction and suffering unto us to see the
world take all our strength, our wisdom, honor, riches, peace, friendship,
etc. and leave us nothing, but that we should depart from, and forsake father,
mother, wife, children, etc. and thus it is with a Christian; The world
ingrosseth power, authority, wisdom, riches, etc. and leaves us as the scum
and outsweepings of all things. Nay we forsake our nearest relations in all
respects, as the law of the flesh in its true sense calls for, and go to a
place we know not whether, by any wisdom or understanding of the creature,
which can never be done but by the instinct and operation of the spirit of God,
opening unto us the power, wisdom, riches, and all relations that are real,
substantial, and eternal: And if the spirit of God be there, it never appears
but in the faith and unity of Christ, therefore they are the proper sufferings
of Christ, and not of any particular creature: And when we know and judge of
the sufferings of the Saints, we shall not lament if the world take all
temporary things from us, nor rejoice in what it can cast upon us; for God
forbid that I should rejoice in any thing save in the cross of our Lord Jesus
Christ, whereby the world is killed and crucified in me, and I in the world. If
once we know how to loose our lives in the world, in all things of the spirit,
and how to loose our lives in our selves, and body mystical in all things
pertaining to the flesh, we shall then take is lightly in whatsoever the world
can give, or take away from us.

By the nature of these sufferings we know of what spirit and power, of what
nature, virtue, and comprehension this act of Eliah is, which is the third
point; And he prayed.
Whence we note;

That the act or spirit of prayer has in it sufficient honor, power, and
authority to memorize and register the name of a christian for ever, that it
shall never be put out, but continue in the records of the house of God: For

1. Prayer has in it the virtue and power of prophecy; for in the history
treating of the act of Eliah, he prophesies unto Ahab, saying, As the Lord
lives there shall be no rain nor dew for these years but according to my
word: So that this prayer comprehends the whole Prophecy of Eliah, and Eliah
is brought in as comprehending all the Prophets, as Moses comprehending the
whole law, in the transfiguration of Christ's appearing in the same form and
glory that Christ does, so that all prophecy and noble acts of the Prophets
are involved in the spirit of prayer: By the spirit of God in this place, his
reproof of Ahabs wickedness, his slaying of all the false prophets of Baal,
his bringing fire from heaven to slay Captayns with their fifties, his dividing
of the waters with his mantle, his giving of his spirit to Elisha, his binding
up and flopping the bottles of heaven, and loosing of them at his pleasure; his
rebuking the earth, and drying it up to dust, that it cannot yield fruit; his
ascending up into heaven in a fiery Chariot. The spirit of God is pleased to
commend all his honorable deeds unto the world in this one act of prayer, to
stand and to be as his memorial for ever. Prayer therefore is garnished with
all the ornaments of a Prophet o^ God, and cannot be less then a most
honcurable monument and memorizing of the Saints wherever it is found extant.

2. Prayer has all the virtues and ornaments of Priesthood in it: Never was
Aaron fitted and adorned with greater variety of vestments and virtues, to
minister before God in the holy place (and according to the variety and change
of the multitude of sacrifices and offerings) then the spirit of prayer
contayns in it; and according to occasion puts on, and brings forth, when the
virtue and power of our great high Priest after the order of Melchisedech is
brought in, it is all summed up in the spirit of prayer, as he says also in
another place, Thou art a Priest for ever after the order of Melchisedech; who
in the days of his flesh when he offered up prayers and supplications with
strong crying and tears unto him (or in him) that was able to save him from
death, and was heard in that which be feared; That is, he was heard in all
things, or for the accomplishment and bringing to pass all things that concern
life and salvation. Now that all things that concern the Kingdom of God is
involved in this prayer, is thus proved.

The word translated feared, is in the Greek dispaired, about which men have
much contended how it may be said of Christ.

But the thing is really and substantially to be considered, though men do
wrest and bend, mince and strayn the word, to suit it to humane reason.

For it is as true that the Son of God in, and by the spirit of the world, and
principles proper to humane wisdom, does despair and relir quish all hope and
expectation of being delivered or set at liberty from that infinite wrath and
displeasure of Almighty God; as it is true, that the son of sorry man is in,
and by the spirit of God, and principles proper to the wisdom of God
established and confirmed in the love, power, truth, righteousness and glory
of God, and of his Kingdom everlastingly.

If men be ignorant hereof, how Christ is said to fear or dispayr in all
things, they may talk of eternal life, but they know not how a creature can
live eternally, and be possessor of all things.

Want of this knowledge breeds your Mortallists, that know not by virtue of what
the soul becomes eternal, either in life or death, as also your Generallists,
that say God will save all, whereas there may be as real and undeniable
arguments used upon like ground, that God will destroy all; and so they must be
left to the height of their doctrine, which will amount to no more then the
condition of a beast, yet does it make them such men, as it had been good for
them they had never been born.

For the rest that have gotten a tract of salvation and damnation by tradition
from schools, books, natural philosophy and observation, not having the
knowledge of the nature of this Priesthood, comprised in the spirit of
intercession: They believe such things, but they must not be curiously searched
into; that is, we cannot know them; of these we say, as the mind without knowis
not good, so these men's faith is dead: For will thou know oh empty man that
faith without works is dead? For the spirit of God never works in way of life,
but in its own light; therefore ignorance in any point must be void of the work
of faith, and so of the saving virtue that is in the life of Christ.

But prayer comprehending the whole Priesthood of Christ, is a work of that
honor and power, as to memorize the name of a Saint for ever, and to set him
up as a monument of the wisdom and mercy of God.

3. Prayer is a work that comprehends the Kingly authority of Christ; for when
the Apostle Paul had shaken off the traditions and rudiments of the carnal
Jew, the power of the high Priest, in that prosecuting spirit of binding and
imprisoning all that were of the way of Jesus, calling on the name of the Lord:
and when the Lord would proclaim him, and make it manifest that he was a chosen
vessel fitted to bear his name, or carry his authority before the Gentiles,
Kings, and the children of Israel. Yea, when he would put all that honor upon
him which the Psalmist foretells, saying, There is little Benjamine their
ruler, the head of the Tribe, a Prince of God, he comprehends and concludes all
in this act of prayer, to give satisfaction to Annanias, behold he prays: As
if he should say, it is enough to know that miraculous change from Saul unto
Paul; from the service of the Synagogue of the Jews, to be a ruler over Kings,
the Gentiles, and children of Israel, (for the name of God is by his word
advanced over all, which he was to bear) this is sufficient to give
satisfation to all, Behold he prays: So that none can deny a Princely spirit
of power and authority, where the spirit of prayer bears sway, and a princely
excellency is of honor sufficient to eternize the record of a Christians name.

4. There is in prayer the power of victor, or a victorious renown, consisting
of the noblest conquest that ever was; Jacob by prayer overcame the man that
wrestled or combated with him, which man is said to be an Angel, but it is the
Angel that blessed him in the way, and therefore is declared to be God; for
Jacob said, I have seen God face to face; in which act of prayer his name is
changed from Jacob to Israel, to declare a prince-like promise in prevailing
with God, as the Prophet explayns his name and act, saying, And by his strength
he had power with God, yea he had power over the Angel, and prevailed; he wept
and made supplication, he found him in Bethel, and there spoke with us (or in
us) for if the spirit of God had not spoke in our father Jacob, and so in all
of his race, he had never prevailed.

Was ever the like Conquest made, as to overcome omnipotency? which could never
be, but through the requests of his own spirit, which he cannot deny, but must
yield himself over thereunto.

Prayer therefore consists of a combat which ever has conquest, therefore of
sufficient honor and renown to memorize a Saint, who-ever he be that
exercises the design and skill thereof.

5. Prayer has salvation contained in it, nay it is salvation: For whosoever
calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved: or in the present tense (as the
word will admit) is saved; for he that thinks he knows Christ any otherwise
then in the virtue of an office exercised in such a subsistence, or by such a
manner or subsisistance exercised in such an office, that man may come to be
deceived as the Jews of old were, and Jewish Gentiles are at this day, and so
persecute Christ in stead of receiving him, when or in whomsoever he appears.
Let those of that carnal opinion, that Christ shall come and reign upon the
earth as a great Monarch for a thousand years, look into this point; for
Christ was never known but in an office as aforesaid, and every office of the
spirit in its proper way and manner of working, comprehends whole Christ: Now
the office of intercession is a work of the spirit, for we know not how to pray
as we ought, but the spirit makes intercession for us, or in us; therefore it
comprehends whole Christ, for he cannot be divided; and it being the spirit of
the Savior, must have, yea be salvation; for where Christ the Son of God is,
there is salvation: In what grace, virtue, or office soever he appears, in or
by, that tradition of tying salvation to believing alone, is ridiculous; for
can there be more in faith then in love, which is the fulfilling of the whole
law, yea of that law of the spirit of life in Christ? and are not we saved by
hope? Does not Timothy save himself and them that hear him by preaching sound
doctrine? Now to take faith according to that dismition the Apostle gives,
saying, It is the subsistence of things hoped for: So faith is in every virtue,
office and exercise of Christ; for the subsistence is the being of God and man
in one, and that is to be held and had of Christians in all things that can be
said of Christ, therefore we acknowledge nothing but Jesus Christ and him
crucified; There is both the unction and crucification in every thing a
Christian knows: but there is no unction but in the nature divine, nor slaying
in a Christan, but of the flesh; which twayn are never separated, neither in
love nor hope, gentleness, mercy, kindness, wisdom, truth, patience, and
whatsoever can be named of Christ, it is the subsistence of twayn made one new
man, that compleats it: and therefore salvation is in all Christ's excellencies,
and they are all as things hoped for, because they are ever to come; that is,
not only in present being and exercise, but shall for ever spring up unto a
Christian out of that living and everlasting fountain.

All things of salvation therefore are in prayer; for prayer consists of
necessity and supply, but all necessities and all supplies are in prayer,
therefore prayer contayns whole Christ, which is complete salvation; therefore
a work of honor to eternize the memory of a Saint.

This point may fence a Christian from discouraging and drooping thoughts, apt
to sieze upon all all flesh, thinking himself of no use in his age, nor of any
performance befitting such a name, or calling, as to be entitled a Son of God,
being destitute of any power or authority, wisdom or policy, device or
invention, art or science, such as the sons of men have gathered and encroached
unto themselves in all ages: By sword and stratagems; by Schools and
Seminaries, by money and friendship, by travel and humane experiments and
observations.

Poor heart that thou art (with respect unto the world) can thou pray? be of
good comfort, it countervayls all, it is the renownedst act that ever was
wrought in the world; Get thee to thy Closet, viz. shut up thy self from the
common courses and customs of this world, and pray unto thy father in secret;
or according unto, or in that secret and hidden mystery of Christ, which is as
secret and hidden from the world, as thy self is hid from the ways of the
world in this thy closet or chamber of presence: And thy father which sees in
seecret; that is, which beholds and approves of this mystery of God in thee,
will reward thee openly; that is, will make it manifest that the reward or end
of thine estate and practice is to be made manifest to the Son of God; and that
the Heyr-ship and inheritance of the Kingdom of God appertayns and belongs
unto thee.

2. Again, let such weigh this point that hold themselves free from believing
any doctrine in the world till they see it accompanied with miraculous works,
viz. works in like manner and form as they have been done formerly, as to
heal the sick, restore the lame, open the eyes of the blind, and raise up the
dead, all these are taken in a bodily and corporeal respect. These men do not
consider that the famous and miraculous works that Elia did, all of them are
included in his prayer, and that is as miraculous as any of them; the miracles
that Christ did, they are all included in his prayers, supplications, and
tears, with strong cries, which is no less miraculous then any of the rest:
The wonders of Paul in doing and suffering are all comprised in this, Behold he
prays.

Now the miraculous virtue and power of prayer consists not in words, or any
outward expression or bodily exercise in a form of words: but in humble
petition, a lawful suing out of right, a just and legal appeal and judgment
given, according to the nature of the case propounded, in which all accord and
agree together to complete the mystery and miracle of prayer, having all these
things in it, whereby according to the law of the spirit, our right of
inheritance is faithfully sued out. Note further, that it is no more the form
visible of any miracle that ever was wrought, that is the proper seal to
confirm the Gospel; no more then the Ministry of the Letter that kills, is the
proper path of the spirit that gives life.

But it is the scope, drift, aim and end of the miracle in what it points
unto, in that great and miraculous workmanship of Christ the son of the living
God, which is the true and proper seal of the Gospel: and wheresoever that is
effectually wrought, there it is felt and approved, and there only the Gospel
or glad tidings of salvation is really and miraculously confirmed by a sign
and wonder, passing infinitely all momentany and corporeal respects.

But these men think they honor the Gospel, and lift it up to its proper
height, and ancient dignity. In thus concluding, their opinion is no less
honorable then that of those that have resolved and decreed, that the
pattering (over the words of that prayer which Christ taught his Disciples) as
a spell, is an effectual ordinance in the house of God, never looking at the
life, spirit, and proper power of prayer, only the form of words. So these look
at the form of the miracle wrought, as it appears to a natural eye, as the
other appears to the ear, and never look at the true wonder and sign, only
sound in the son of man, and elsewhere centred, is no better then the magic
of Egypt; for they may as well gape after the outward forms of words to be the
prayer of the Gospel, as the outward form of the work, to be the seal of the
Doctrine of the Gospel, and any particular, or all outward forms, which
Religion is represented unto us in, to be the Religion of God, as well as any
or all of those former miracles wrought, to be the seal of God.

3. Furthermore, to conclude the historical act of wonders wrought, to be the
sign of confirmation, is to darken, yea to annihilate the virtue and power of
the Gospel; for in this wonder of Eliah, to make the heavens as brass, and the
earth as iron, is here a fit allusion in the judgment of the spirit (and we
are to hear what the spirit says unto the Churches) in the teaching of the
death of Christ, and the operations thereof considered in the world; and also
in the house of God, whose house we are, if we hold fast the confidence, and
the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end: And thus the allusion is unto a
three years and six months forbearance of rain, and afterward to raynein
great plenty.

This allusion is also used not in the term of years, but of two and forty
months, which is the same length of time, but in a far differing respect,
and differing doctrine, in regard of the several beams and luster of the
Gospel.

For there he teaches, that in measuring of the Temple, the Courtyard is to
be left out, and not to be measured, because it is given unto the Gentiles: And
the holy City shall they tread under foot two and forty months, which is this
three years and six months.

It is also alluded unto in point of days, and so the same mystery is called a
thousand two hundred and threescore days, which are not properly years of
famine, but rather of fruit, for it is the time of the prophecy of the two
witnesses of the Gospel; it is alluded unto likewise, as consisting of three
days and a half, which is the time of the witnesses dead bodies lying in the
streets of the great City, which is spiritually called Sodom and Egypt,
where also our Lord was crucified, not suffered to be put in graves.

This wonder wrought by Eliah, is alluded unto also, as points or monuments of
time, in which the time of the woman's being in the wilderness is taught, a
doctrine far differing from any of the former, and that is for a time, times,
and half a time, on the division of time. Now if the three years and six
months drought, and afterward rain, were the substance and intent of the
miracle, and in that the wonder to lie for the confirmation of the Gospel; how
fi^ly could the spirit of God bring it in, as an elegant allusion in all these
several respects.

Those therefore that would have the Gospel confirmed by miracles of like
outward form as have been done in ages past; they annihilate the Gospel, by
denying the truth, substance, and reality of the sign to be extant only in
Christ. Like friends to the Gospel are they, who look to see Christ coming from
heaven, confined in one individual man (as the Disciples saw him go up) to
reign on the earth as an only Monarch for the space of a thousand years; and
then, and not till then we shall see good days, as those Doctors affirm.

The fourth point is the effect of his prayer; And it rayned not.
Concerning the historical form of this wonder, all men know what it is to
rain, and not to rayn: But few know the mystery thereof, which is
substantiated in the Son of God, and consists in that death of his, reallized
in the men of the world, and in the men of God.

The spirit therefore and office of the intercession of Christ, centring in,
and gathering it self into that one holy and mystical body, in the utterance
and manifestation of it self, affords not any of the rain of Gods liberality
and bounty; nor of that dew which causes Israel to grow as a lilly, unto that
body of sin, that state of Ahab, Jezebel, and apostatized Israel, but leaves
it fruitless and barren, like those mountains of Gilboa, where Saul slaw
himself, etc. to declare that his unction according to the works of the Law of
the carnal command, with all the glory arising therefrom: and the terrors of
God are never separated, nor upon that height and dignity does ever rayn, nor
dew (according to the intent of our Apostle in this place) fall or descend to
bring forth any fruit unto God, but are like the heath in the parched
wilderness, and as the dry dust which the wind of Gods fury drives away.

2. The spirit of intercession comprised and exercising it self in that
Elijah, the strength of our being or existance, dries up that mystical body
of Christ, that no rain, nor dew, nor any moisture producing fruits according
to the flesh, falls upon it, or descends thereon: And this is declared and
signified unto us in Eliah, who goes to the brook Cherith, or the brook of
slaying, and mortification of the flesh, with all the lusts and affections
thereof, intimated unto us in the drying up of the brook by that drought, and
he is fed by no earthly thing, but only by the fowls of heaven. Also when he
sits under the Mulbery trees, as one bereaved of his life, as his fathers
before him also were. To the things of this world, there also an Angel or
Messenger heavenly only, makes provision for him, in his ascension to Horeb,
the Mount of God; in the strength of which food once received, though in a
twofold respect, he travels forty days and forty nights, the like time that
Moses and our Lord fasted, where he complayns to God, that he only is left
alone, destitute of all help of man, as an outcast from all claym or title to
the Kingdom of Ahab, and backsliden Israel, to idolatry: For there is no rayn
nor dew which makes that earthly condition fruitful that falls upon him; for
the Famine is as great unto him in point of the wisdom of the flesh, yielding
any food to Eliah, as it is in respect of the wisdom of the spirit, in
yielding any refreshment to Ahab; the one being the heaven of God, of Israel,
and the other the heaven, or god of the world.

To conclude this point, let us insert that word Selah, which has the
signification of lifting up, do but exalt the word of God, as it is in Jesus;
and behold it is extant, and lives in both these respects at this day, and
thence comes in the time of this restraynt of rain.

And this is the fifth point, which is for the space of three years and six
months.
For the opening of this point, we know that the number three as it has the
mystery of a true and real distinction in it, in the same individual, as in
the three that bear record in heaven, the father, the word, and the spirit,
and these three are one: So also the mystery of fullness and perfection (as the
number seven has) for three witnesses are as a thousand, they answer the Law
completely. Likewise it has the mystery of eternity in it, for they are
heavenly, such as never fade away, nor fail to bring in their testimony;
therefore it is, that Israel must go three days journey into the wilderness to
worship the Lord; that is, there must be a total and final departure from
Egypt, in regard of the ignorance or darkness of it, from their governments,
Hosts, and Armies, burdens, tasks, and cruelties, Magicyan-like worships, lying
wonders, and fauning flatteries, in the erecting and setting up of the
Tabernacle and worship of God at Mount horeb, or Sinai.

This is also the reason why the Ark must go before them three days journey
from Mount-Sinai, to seek out a resting place, namely to show, that there must
be a total and final departure from the works of the Law, in our entering into
that rest that yet remaynes for the people of God. Of like signification is
Jonas, being in the Whales belly, and the Son of man in the heart of the earth.
Jonas is swallowed up of the Whales in carnal and backsliding Israel, who
observe lying vanities, and decline the word of God, but is cast up and made
alive in the Ninivites beyond all reason, expectation, or thought of heart, for
the Publicans and Sinners enter before the strict Scribes and Pharisees into
heaven.

Christ lies three days and three nights in the grave, as buried eternally,
concerning any life of his spirit, in Herod, Pontius Pilate, and that wicked
Judas, and the Jews: but he rises the third day in his Disciples, the
Gentiles, and all Nations, never to dye any more, but only those three days
and three nights of eternity in the wicked of the world, unto which his life in
the Saints is proportionable.

Even so, here is three years void of rayn, or dew, or any fruitfulness of the
earth, wherein both heaven and earth are in exercise, and are comprehended. So
there is an eternal estate of the wicked that comprehends both God and man in
that way of the Curse, and unity of the Harlot, wherein twayn are made one
flesh; for two (says he) shall be one flesh, in which estate there is no dew
of heaven, nor fruit yielded by the earth; that is, of those fruits of
righteousness and virtues that are by Jesus Christ, in those three years, that
is, unto eternity: There is also an eternal season of the Saints of God,
wherein no dew nor rayn from heaven (or from that wisdom of the flesh) falls
on them, to cause any fruits of the flesh, or works of darkness to be brought
forth by them: So that as in a year we see a perfect revolution of things not
only earthly, but heavenly also, at least in that great light and course of the
Sun: so that the number three signifies a total and final revolution of all
things that concern God and man, as two being joined in way of flesh: And all
things also that concern God and man everlastingly, in that way of being joined
unto the Lord, and made one spirit with him.

Further, we see that in a whole years space, there is a like time of night as
there is of day, if we take the globe universally; even so there is a like
eternity of darkness and the power thereof, that there is of light in the
Kingdom of Christ.

Moreover, take the whole circumference of heaven and earth, and there is a
like time of Winter that there is of Summer, even so there is the same
threefold time of eternity in the kingdom of darkness, of blasting,
withering, smiting with chilly coldness, and all unfruitfulnesse, as there is
in the kingdom of life and light, of the joy of harvest, and pleasure of the
tree of life, which bears twelve manner of fruits, as being furnished for
every Tribe of Israel, and every month of the year; which tree is not afraid
of drought, nor knows when the heat comes.

Concerning the six months added, it is a rendering or consigning to each
estate of eternity such a time; for the Prophet in the history is illimited in
his expression, saying, that it shall be neither rain nor dew for these
years; which may be applied to time past, present, or to come; for it is
according to my word, which is the word of the Lord, the word of eternity: so
that we can give no other bounds to the time, but such as hold correspondency
with the word of eternity: Our Apostle therefore brings it in by these
expressions, to declaring and distinguish his meaning, namely the Prophets
meaning.

This term of six months then, is to be taken according to that distinction,
when he says, that summer and winter, cold and heat, seed-time and harvest,
night and day shall not cease. This six months properly sets forth unto us
the time of seed-time and harvest; which take it throughout the earth, with
respect to all grayn, and it consists so long time: Besides, the number six
has in it the mystery of means of increase; for increase, multiplication, and
fruitfulness is not brought in in the creation, but with the blessing, which
is the means of it: So that six months in this place is the time and means of
multiplication and increase, which is here frustrate and hindered by the
drought unto barrenness and famine.

In the mystery of Christ, the Saints of God sow unto the spirit, but the seed
of immortality is lost in the wicked, they reap nothing unto eternal life.
Also the wicked, they sow unto the flesh, but their seed is lost in the Saints,
and comes to naught, for they reap nothing of corruption: So that in these
three years of eternity there is a frustration of seed-time and harvest; an
absolute fruitlesnesse, barrenness, and famine throughout the earth; the one
unto blessing, in bringing forth nothing unto the flesh; the other unto a
curse, in bringing forth nothing unto the spirit.

Yet men bear men in hand, and vainly persuade themselves they can convert
men, and turn them by their preaching, and make them other things then they
are, whereas the Gospel only declares and discovers men to appear to be that
which they are, no alteration of a work done once and for ever. They may as
well say they can make the righteous and just one a sinner, as to say the
wicked may become holy, otherwise then as they are once and for ever; for Gods
work in mankind is an eternal act, not knowable, but as himself considered
one with it.

6. It follows, which is the renewing of his prayer, and the effect thereof;
And he prayed again, and the heavens gave rain, and the earth brought forth
her fruit.

We are not here to take prayer as one being of a later production then the
former, for they are but one continued and eternal act, as the doctrine of the
Gospel is, which is herein commended unto us; for the things of God are
comprehended and involved one in another: and it is the skill of a Scribe
taught unto the Kingdom of God, to bring them out of the treasury, as things
of old from eternity; and new, as in present use, fitting and beseeming the
present oration and opportunity. This phrase therefore is like that, where the
Apostle says, My little children, of whom I travel in birth again, till
Christ be formed in you; not as though they had now defaced Christ, who before
was formed in them: but he declares hereby the effect of his doctrine, from
which some were turned aside unto the rudiments of the Law, as unto another
Gospel, which he says is not another, but the same Gospel perverted by false
Teachers, telling them that some are entangled with the yoke of bondage
thereby; for he that is bound to any particular of the carnal commandment, as
to be circumcised, or any outward form of bodily action; He is bound to keep
the whole law, and shows that such have abolished Christ, and are fallen from
grace; such effect he shows his Doctrine had of some, as a savor of death unto
death: but there were others unto whom he there speaks, on whom his doctrine
had a more noble effect, as being a savor of life; Therefore he says, My
little children, of whom I travel in birth again; or I have brought you
forth, not in a second act, but in another manner and way, namely to the
forming of Christ in you, or framing you into the similitude of the Son of God
once and for ever.

Even so it is here, He prayed again; that is, the spirit of intercession has
a secondary, or other manner of effect then that which is before specified, not
another prayer, but another manner of wonder accomplished by the same prayer,
for now the heavens gave rain, and the earth brings forth her fruit.

We are to know then, that as the Gospel opens the treasuries of the Kingdom
of God unto an abundant freedom, liberty, and plenty of the going forth and
exercise of the spirit of grace in the Saints, even as water poured upon the
thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground, through that office of intercession
peculiar unto our Eliah, without any hinderance or engagement of any bond of
the flesh; when through the spirit of prayer, that cloud of witness or rayn of
liberality arises, as a hand or administration thereof, even as the word of
the Lord is said to come by the hand of Haggie, and by the hand of Malachie,
and by the hand of all the Prophets, which so covers the heavens, as no
parching sun of the beams of man's wisdom and device takes place, no more then
they do in those over-shadowings of the Virgin, by that holy spirit of God in
the production of Christ.

Even so does Prayer set at liberty the works of the flesh in the men of the
world, by opening the sluices and floodgates thereof unto condemnation and
destruction; for the waters of the great deep, mystery, or bottomless pit, are
opened for the destruction of the world, as well as the floodgates of heaven
for the safety of Noah and his household, in bearing up the Ark fifteen cubits
above the great mountayns of the States of this earth, or of the world. And
this prayer does not simply, accidentally, but ministerially and effectually in
the same sense, That the Gospel is a savor of death unto death. Not only by
gleaning of all the fruits of righteousness out of the wisdom of the Serpent,
or men of the world, which centred in the Saints, are the proper cause of the
transcendencies of their estate above all humane excellencies, so does it also
gleane all the vicious desires of the flesh out of that state and condition of
Christ, centring them in that state of unbelief, whereby man descends
infinitely beneath a state of simple, humane, or properties of a mere creature,
and by fashioning and corrupting the holy things of God, becomes satanicall,
and diabolical, and such as seek to find an excellent or commendable betwixt
these twayn, it cannot be better described or diciphered (for the solidity of
it) then by that partition that divides Purgatory and Hell, in those of that
mercinary conceit.

The abundance of spirit therefore in the Saints, and that plenty of the spirit
of the Prince of the power of the air which now works in the children of
disobedience, hold proportion in way of Antithesis, otherwise an infinite and
an eternal wrath could not take place in the wicked, as an infinite and
eternal glory does in the Saints.

For he made but one; speaking of that state of Christ (with an elegant
allusion unto the high Priest) and wherefore but one? seeing he had abundance
of spirit, namely that there might be a holy seed; that whatsoever the fruits
are, that are by one Lord Jesus Christ, of the same nature and dignity are all
the fruits of happiness produced and brought forth by that one mystical and
spiritual body, and so in a diameter respect are all the fruits of sin in the
wicked.

This plenty in this twofold respect is signified by warning given to Ahab, to
betake himself to his Chariot, for I hear a noise of much rain, which Ahab
flies from as a terrible thing, as it contayns the spirit of Eliah, betaking
himself to Chariot and horse in the furnitures of this world: and Eliah flies
from it, as it has the spirit of Ahab and Jezebel, as that which brings
destruction upon them, only he betakes himself to the strength of Gods spirit
to take the gates of Iesreel.

The plenty of Eliah's spirit is seen and taught in that duration and plenty in
the cruse of oil, and barrel of meal; raising up the woman's son from death
to life, and annoynting Hazael and Jehu for the ruin of Ahabs house; Elisha to
be a Prophet in his stead, and in the destruction of all those false Prophets
of Baal.

And the plenty of the rayn of that spirit of wickedness appears in Ahab and
Jezebel, their cruelty toward the Prophet of God, their miserable and horrible
overthrow, and in their desire and endeavor to nourish and maintayn such
plenty of a false spirit of prophecy upon the face of the earth, and in this
plenty of rain, seed-time, and harvest are continued; for the world sow unto
the flesh, and the flesh they reap and inherit corruption; and the Saints sow
unto the spirit, and inherit everlasting life.

And from this power of prayer he assumes the power and virtue of doctrine, in
which he concludes the Epistle, to show that where the power and virtue of the
one resides, there is the power and virtue of the other. The prayer of Faith is
never without the spirit of Prophecy: and prophecy according to the spirit,
is never without the life and power of prayer; and where one of these is
wanting, they are both absent from that party, in the true exercise of them;
for a formal prayer is never accompanied with the life and power of sound
doctrine: but as they have composed a prayer by man's invention, gathering up
expressions suitable in the understanding of a man, so do they compose a
doctrine from Libraries, School-distinctions, and from a serious observation of
the carriage and demeanor of one creature toward another, only bringing God
into the account, by turning the glory of the incorruptible God into the
similitude of a corruptible man, and of birds, four-footed beasts, and of
creeping things. It is not Universities, books, and Libraries, that can
transfer the spirit of the Scriptures; no nor the skill in those Languages
wherein they were originally written, without the same spirit comment upon them
in our hearts, by which they were first indicted: It is the spirit that indicted
them, that gives the meaning of them, and not the hand that writes or
translates, no more then paper and ink can do it. Without which spirit, let
us use all means and industry that possible we can, and it is but to pick at
the bark, and rind of truths, and cracking of a shell, void and destitute of
any kernel, better then a gale of bitterness to be found in it; and such as
compose their Sermons of such stuff, their prayers are no better, however they
may show the zeal of Baals Priests in the uttering of them.

But true prayer carries the force of the Doctrine of the Gospel in it, by
judging of the want and supply, according unto God, and true doctrine has the
power of prayer going forth in it for the effectual performance of the things
that are taught, and neither the one nor the other consist of any form or
statue that any book or Library can possibly bring and represent unto us; for
the visions and operations of God are never found in the same form and time as
at another, all circumstances duly weighed and considered.

Yet may we not deny, but the same words may be used often and again in prayer
or doctrine, but with a various respect, as this wonder of Eliah is brought in,
with respect to years, months, days, and points of time: so Christ prayed in
the same words thrice, but with variety and eternity of respect, for the cup
for ever passes by him, and touches him not, as man is eternally saved in
that blessed condition of the Son of God, and it takes effect, at the Son of
God is transformed by the world into the cursed state and condition: For if we
make the death of Christ according to the true mystery of it, wherein salvation
does consist, to be of less continuance then eternity; we shall annihilate
Christ, and make salvation it self of no longer continuance; for if Christ
once dye unto the flesh in the godly, he never lives unto it any more: And if
he once be dead in the wicked, in respect of his proper spirit and life, it is
never repaired in them again, for then there were not eteranll perdition, which
the word of God has commended unto us upon like grounds of certainty, that it
has done everlasting life: That word translated, was dead and is alive, is
read is dead and is alive; as the same word, I am an Apostle, is used in the
present tence. Doctrine and prayer are inseparable companions, even as Kingdom
and Priest hood are, as here in the way of Christ, even so in the world in the
way of Antichrist, and thus the connection of the next point is brought in.

Verse. 19, 20. Brethren, if any of you have erred from the truth, and one has
converted him, etc.
In which words observe;
1. A proposition consisting of two points; As 1. Error from the truth. 2. A
restoration.
2. Observe an injunction, and that has two parts also, 1. To acknowledge or
make a confession of an estate or act. 2. The party that is so to do, and that
is, He that has turned from error.
3. The state and condition, or act done, and that consists of two things. 1.
Death. 2. The hiding of a multitude of sins.

BUt first observe the term or appellation he gives as before he has done,
Brethren. By brethren here, is meant a like brotherhood, as in Esau and Jacob,
which are often so called: Was not, or is not Esau Jacobs brother, says the
Lord? Yet I have loved Jacob, and hated Esau, and laid his mountain wast for
ever. So the Apostle has respect to the wicked, as brethren in a true sense to
the godly, because they consist of the same matter and substance; that is, God
and man made one in the wisdom of the flesh, as the Saints consist of God and
man made one, but according to the wisdom of the spirit.

If one of you, or if any of you; If one of you, that is, as a Nation
considered collectively in Esau, as the Oracle said to Rebecka, Two nations are
in thy womb: or any of you; that is, distributively, or distinctly, and so it
comprehends all the Apostates and Revolters from God, or all virtues or
excellencies in the Saints, from which they are fallen, and have erred and gone
astray. If any, that is, man and man, one or other, or thing and thing, one and
other whatsoever is in the Son of God.

Erred from the truth; that is, gone astray, and wandered from that which is
the reality and substance of all things, which is Christ the Son of God: And to
err in this place, is not simply for a mere creature to declyne and go away
from his Creator; but to pervert, mis-apply, and wrongfully to interpret the
very things of God themselves, turning his glory into shame, his truth into a
lie; therefore they err from truth, as having been in it; for that which was,
is, and ever shall be righteousness and holiness of truth, they have
perverted unto profaneness and wickedness, by interpreting the things of God
to be such as the proper spirit of a creature naturally brings forth, so that
it is a diabolical spirit which this error is formed into.

The particle (if) is not here to be taken as making questions, or doubt
whether there be such a swerving from truth, but as a certain affirmation,
that such there are, as the Apostle explayns the Prophets meaning, where it is
said, Unto whom I swear in my wrath (if) they shall enter into my rest: which
the Apostle expounds, They shall not enter into his rest, as an absolute
certainty: And so there is of one converting or turning from error into truth,
in that wonderful change that the Son of God makes in our nature, for it is
impossile that he should be held of death: but as certainly as he lays down
his life in the wicked, so must he take it again in the godly, otherwise there
were an annihilation of him who is the Author and strength of all things, which
is impossible.

And in this change or turning, we are not to take it as the simple and single
spirit of a creature turned, but the complete spirit of him who is the Son of
God; for as the Apostle speaks of prayer, We know not how to pray as we ought,
but the spirit makes intercession for us. It is not the spirit of God, without
the spirit of the creature, for then there could be no want to be supplied: so
that the whole spirit of Christianity prays, viz. God and man in unity; so it
is here, the spirit that turns, is God and man in unity, and is as true a
change from that which is, and ever shall be Satanicall, as the wicked err
from that which is, and ever shall be holy and righteous, and they are both of
one and the same time, in the rise of them: For in the beginning was the word,
and that word is with God, and is God: And Satan is a liar from the beginning,
and abode not in truth, no more then Christ's soul was left in hell, or that
holy one suffered to see corruption, but was ever taught in the way of life,
and in that real presence, at whose right hand there is fulness of joy for
evermore: Therefore the Prophet says, that Christ comes meek and lowly, saving
himself, that is, completely, and not apart only: and therein the worth and
dignity of salvation stands, that it has that weight, substance of account,
and reckoning in it; and upon this ground the Disciples are comforted against
all fear whatsoever, where it is said, Are not two sparrows sold for a
farthing, and yet one of them falls not to the ground without the good will of
your heavenly father? of how much more worth are ye then many sparrows? Can you
set a price and rate of so mean a thing, and does God take care for the
preservation of it? Of what esteem, price, and respect then is the state of a
Christian? in which not a part, but the complete spirit of the Son of God is
involved, and by a ransom given, and paid in the world proportionable
thereunto purchased. This point contains a mystery, which the common
Priesthood of the world (so far as I have heard or seen in books) is
altogether ignorant of, though life and death, yea the spring and original
fountain of all things is involved in it: So much for the proposition, the
injunction follows.

Le him know, or acknowledge, etc.
The word (let) is of like signification here, that it is in the beginning; Let
there be light, let us make man, etc. having the power of a command, and virtue
of propagation to bring forth, being of the nature of the word Amen, so be it;
or so it shall be without all gainsaying or contradiction, having in it a
creating power and virtue to give being to the thing uttered.

That is, that the party thus turning, or turned; for both are true, and the
word implies both, one that turns, and one turned, for both are in that state
of Christ: and he that preaches any thing but Christ and him crucified, he
goes beyond our Apostle as far as the common apostasy.

The word Let, then, establishes in the heart of him (and no other) that
turns a sinner from the error of his way, a certain power of acknowledgment
of such a condition, or royal and noble acts, which here follows: but first
see here the nature of the confession or acknowledgment of sin, it is his way
that turns naturally, but it is confessed to the change, or converting it
unto the state of the Son of God; even as truth may be said to be their way
naturally, who are in error, but they have perverted the same into falsehood,
turning the truth of God into a lie, and his grace into wantonness: so that
their way (with respect to that which they have perverted) is holiness, and
is, and ever shall be so in Christ; but there remayns nothing but sin and
wickedness in the perverters thereof.

So also a Christian may confess that the evil of sin and error is his way,
with respect to that which is converted, and is, and ever shall be so in the
wicked: but in that state of the turned and converted, there is no sin nor
error to be found at all; there is then a reality of the Saints confession of
their sin, but it is to the removing of it to another, where it abides for
ever, as there is a real confession of a holy one in the wicked, but it is
ever in removing it unto another, which they are not, which is the proper
spirit of Python, that unperswaded or unfaithed one; as the Apostle gives the
wicked the title of Apeitheis, unperswaded, or disobedient: so that their
acknowledgment of holiness in another subsistence, is the unfaithing or
unbetrothing of the soul from God, it is its proper and perpetual divorce.

So that he that knows not how to clear the state of Christianity from sin, and
fill the world with wickedness, he will come to make a bankrupt-like account,
when ever his estate comes to be discovered: Therefore the wealthy estate,
noble acts, and royal prerogatives following, are only entailed and made over
to him that turns the sinner from the error of his way; error collectively,
as all considered in one, otherwise Christ is not cleared, and made the holy
one of God, and then not risen from the dead. We are yet in our sins, the
substance of the common doctrine at this day in the world.

The first point or act of honor given to him that turns, is, that he saves a
soul from death; not as the world thinks by preaching the terrors of the Law,
and frighting men from some gross and brutish acts, they have thereby
converted and saved souls; the most part of those that thus save, did strive to
pluck men out of the hands of the Bishops, that the people might be instruments
to lift them up into the like seat, if not worse; no such conversion coms in
here, it is abominable: but it is a true and faithful distribution and
opening of Gods righteous and holy manner of working, in the absolution of his
holy son made sin, in being acquit from all sin, and the just condemnation of
that wicked one, who in being made Lucifer, the morning star, became the
Prince and power of darkness; From such an original we must fetch salvation
and destruction, or else all our doctrine of the decree of election and
reprobation, will prove no better then reprobate silver, not passing for
current in the Kingdom of God.

1. But the thing to be acknowledged by such a one, as turns, or is turned, is,
he saves; that is, the power and spirit of the Savior is there: when once we
know of what nature the spirit of the world is, namely, that we are of God,
and the world is of that wicked one? then we shall learn to acknowledge, that
salvation never appears, but there is the Savior; we think to honor Christ
by binding him up in one individual man; in point of the mystery of the
Gospel, it is a carnal and humane honor, not beseeming the Son of God; the
common Priesthood has blinded and besotted the world in this point, setting
up an idol in men's minds, and not the mystery of life that is by Christ: but
it is taken for blasphemy in these days, to talk of the Son of God, or a
Savior any where, but as locked up in a humane body in heaven, that men may
stand here in his room, till he return from thence, to suck up all the glory of
the earth.

It was not so in ages past, and men spiritual; for Joshuah, Moses Minister,
was called Jesus, a Savior, as the Apostle interprets his name, and the Lord
acknowledges in raising up Judges in Israel, that he raised up Saviors unto
them. And Paul was not afraid to tell Timmothie, that in taking heed to
himself; that is, how God has composed salvation in his consisting in Christ,
and unto learning or doctrine; that is, how it ought to be laid out and
distributed to others, that in so doing, he should be a Savior of himself,
and them that hear him.

2. A second point is, what he saves; that is, a soul, or a life; this is not
meant of the life of a mere creature, but it is the life of the Son of God, as
our Apostle affirms; Now I live, yet not I, but Christ lives in me; and the
life which I now live, is by, or in the faith of the son of God. So that a
Christians life is the life of Christ: and there is no life of mankind, but
either the life of the Savior, or else the life of Satan, that destroyer; for
heaven and earth conspire together in the making of man. Let us (speaking with
respect to that plurality) in our image; that is, in our image earthly, as well
as heavenly; for there is a heavenly body, and there is an earthly body, and
God is as just and righteous in the making of the one, as of the other, and
every way as honorable, the one in mercy, and the other in severity: And man
cannot be known in a simple act of creation, for that multiplies him not; but
propagation or generation must be brought in also, else the son of God, nor the
seed of the Serpent can be known, and so both are brought forth in that first
act of generation in Cain and Abel, wherein the seed of the Serpent appears in
the same act as in Jacob and Esau, together with Christ in Abel, dead by Caine
in the spirit, and in Seth, that set one in life for evermore, who is set in
the room of Abel, crucified in the world: So that the life of Christ, and of
Antichrist are both from one act, even from as early days the one as the
other, and without the true knowledge of that, we know neither of them: and for
other life in mankind, we know none worthy the name of life beyond other
creatures, but as it serves to the setting forth of the one or of the other of
these, and so they transcend the life of all other creatures, as far as the
image of God did the frame of any other creature, or that earthly image
descends below them all, even to a bottomless pit, which no other creature is
subjected unto, but only man.

3. There is a third point what he saves from, that is, death, namely a death
that holds correspondency with that infinite and eternal life of the Son of
God, in way of Parathesis in all points, for Christ is saved from whatsoever
Satan is, has, or undergoes: and Satan is destroyed from whatsoever Christ
is, has, or is advanced unto; therefore that conceit that Satan was an
Angel, that is a mere creature at the first, and in acceptance with God is a
mere humane tradition, and philosophical fiction, and is a point of greater
concernment then men are aware of; for it is as safe to say, that the son of
God was for a time out of the Fathers favor, as to hold that the Devil at any
time was in acceptance with God, for whatsoever is out of Gods favor, can
never return into again; and what is accepted of him for a moment, ca^ never
be rejected.

2. A second royalty, or act of fame that is to be acknowledged by him who
turns the sinner from the error of his way, changing him into truth it self,
that is, the covering or hiding of a multitude of sins.

This is taken from the speech of Solomon, Hatred stirs up strife, but love
covers all sins, which our Apostle calls a multitude of sins: the word
signifies the deep of the troubled ocean, intimating that huge multitude of
torturing and troubling trespasses, proper to that great gulf of the
bottomless pit.

Now to turn from the error of a man's way, is to turn to truth; and no man can
turn to truth, but by that unity that is in Christ; none turns to truth, but
he that becomes truth; for there is no term or title given in Scripture, but
being rightly interpretted and rightly applied, the truth, substance, and being
of the thing is there; for God uses no expression, but he intends under that
the truth and substance of the thing expressed: To turn to truth, is not only
truth in word, but truth in act also, yea to be that very thing as Christ
says, I am the way, the truth, and the life.

Now that unity that is in Christ is the fulfillment and completing of the law
of the Spirit; for if the love of Christ be in us, and constrayn us to all
acknowledgments of him, we know that love is the fulfilling of the Law: and
where the Law is fulfilled, there sin utters not its voice, nor has it a face
to appear, it is altogether hid and covered for ever. Christ is the e^d and
scope of the law for righteousness, and more it aims not at, nor more it
cannot require; for it is the son of God that is justified, who then shall
condemn him? The law is fully satisfied, from what ground then shall any
accuse? yea our Apostle says, that the righteousness of the law is fulfilled
in us that walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit: No hiding of sin
therefore but by fulfilling of the law: but what law? not the law of the
carnal commandment, generally taught in the world, by which no flesh can be
justified, but it is the law of the spirit of life which is in Christ Jesus; or
which consists in that unction, office, or spirit of the Savior.

Again, how do the wicked hide righteousness, that none appears in them but
only the spirit of the wicked one, namely by walking according to the law of
the flesh: For he that walks after the law of the flesh, he cannot please God,
so that all righteousness is hid and covered in them, yea even by fulfilling
the law of the flesh; for the more they conform themselves thereunto, the more
their condemnation does appear: for it is not because men cannot perform all
the works of the law (in that respect) that they cannot be justified thereby,
but because they do any of them; for it is against the nature of that law of
the carnal Commandment and every part thereof to justify, for it is its
proper nature and office to condemn; for we may as well say, that the law of
the spirit of life which is in Christ Jesus, is a law of sin and death, as to
say, the law of the carnal command can give life or peace, no not in the
complete performance of it. For every part thereof is a breach of the law of
the spirit: And whatsoever is a breach of the law of the spirit, is a
crucifying of the Son of God afresh, and putting of him to open shame: so that
every performance of the law of the flesh according to the intent thereof, is a
breach of the same law of the spirit; and he that breaks one, breaks all,
therefore all righteousness is hid and covered in the wicked; even so the true
keeping of the law of the spirit of faith in any part of it, is a nullifying of
the whole law of the carnal Command; therefore no law of sin and death is
found in them, all sins and sorrows are hid and covered; therefore the man is
blessed whose trespass is forgiven, whose sin is covered: Blessed is the man,
and he only, unto whom the Lord imputes, accounts, or reckons not
iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile,

Amen.
