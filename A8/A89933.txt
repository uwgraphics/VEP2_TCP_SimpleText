A New character of a Christian, or Roundhead.
HE is a creature new molded out of the frame and stock of the old Adam, into
that of the new and second; and is compounded of light and darkness, which
sometimes makes him to shine, and sometimes obscureth him, as either of both are
predominant in him. In the former part of his life after conversion, you shall
have him all in raptures, new joys, and strange expressions; being, as it were,
in a new world: but after that in dumps and melancholy fits, now and then like
a storme-beaten-man, complaining of cross winds, storms and tempests: A
creature who at his entrance into Christianity finding such changes, and
various entertainment, looks not for his portion in this life, and therefore
expects no great matters in the house of bondage he now labors in: He is not
much troubled for his present condition, because he is heir of all things, and
what he wants in possession, he is assured of in reversion, knowing that his
Father will see him furnished in the fittest season; and therefore in his wants
he fues the promises, Gods bonds, yet leaves to Gods pleasure when to make them
good, and cares not though others are lifted up upon dunghils to overlook him.
Though he be in show miserable, yet he envies not the present felicity of any,
who have but a sunshine day toward their execution: He dares not adventure
upon the lest of evils for attaining of the greatest good; of two evils he
always chooses the least, though he acknowledges that there is no evil of
sin to be chosen at any time, and therefore uses this world and all things
therein, as though he used them not. He can cast his bread upon the waters,
and yet after many days, expect increase from thence; in all things he
sympathises with the sufferings of others, and helping them in their miseries
what he may.

In all his actions the Word he makes his Rule in all things, and dares not
without a warrant from thence undertake any matters of consequence; the rules
and precepts whereof being multifarious, therefore his readier practice has
summed up into one, to do to others, as he would be done to by of them: and
because at the giving of the Law all the Mountain was railed round, he
therefore puts this rule about all his words, ways and actions, To abstain from
all appearance of evil: Christ he makes his chiefest joys, his sins his
greatest sorrow, next unto which an hypocrite vexes him most, because he
undertakes to act his part, but yet so bunglingly, that he always shames
himself in the end: heaven he prises above all things, and so little values
the earth, as he thinks all this world not worthy of a sigh: He out of
singularity affects not preciseness, but that his wary walking is still
atended with that aspersion, he is temperate in all things, being to try great
masteries over himself and others, not caring for the jollities and
rejoyceings of others, lest too much of that temper should enforce that he had
received his consolation.

He knows that he walks in the midst of dangers, and therefore he walks some
turns every day in heaven and hell, the one to cheer him in his journey, the
other to afflict him from sinning. He espies and sees the snares which are rapt
up in all the creatures to entrap him, and therefore as one treading amongst
snares, he walks the more warily and circumspectly in all things, and can
admire high hills, but bide within the plains: Yea, in all his journies he by
faith sees all this world on fire, as holy Jerome, though he always heard the
last Trumpet sounding in his ears, Arise ye dead, and come to judgment, and
therefore suits all his actions, affections, and meditations, according unto
that matchless admiration, He thoroughly hates all sin, willingly hugs and
harbors none, and mourns most that he cannot leave all. In his deviations when
he sins, he goes not purposely astray, but only unwares slips and misses his
way, and rather is enforced then led willingly out of the good way, when being
out he is restless, until he come in his way again, whose falls and failings,
are not fallings away; rather diseases and wants in the fear of God, then want
thereof, being the remembrancers of his frailties; helps unto his abasement,
subject of his humiliation, matter of his mortification, and wings unto his
vivification, to make him flourish in self-denial.

All Superiors and Magistrates he obeyes and reverences, not only out of
duty, but also for conscience sake, and that not only unto the good, but also
unto the bad, unless it be when they command things unlawful, in which case
only he has learned to refuse obedience and suffer, rather choosing with
Saint Paul to obey God than man: He refuses no good instructions coming from
Moses chair, but willingly receives all which is good, whosoever the messenger
be, and for matter of ceremonies, he does not refuse the shadow for the
substance, the kirnell for the shell. Saint Paul's Bishop he honors with double
honor, but for a Lord Bishop, he professes not to understand that mystery
which our blessed Savior rejected: He can hear the word preached in season
and out of season, in Churches and out of Churches, though he prefer the
hearing thereof in Churches as the more decent and of better report then the
other.

He thinks better of all others then of himself, because he knows most evil
by himself, and therefore dares not entertain or receive evil reports of
others, because he knows all men are liars, but rather usually underfoots
them, least they should pass further, and when he ventures upon admonition or
reproof, it is upon urgent known cause, with much compassion, fear and
observation of Time, Place, person, and manner, and with abundance of
discretion and love, both foregoing it, and following after the same, nor does
he venture to judge rashly after the hearing of the ear, nor after the seeing
of the eye of any; being jealous of his mistakes, that so in this kind he may
suite himself unto a divine temper, like unto Christ, who refused to judge the
woman without her accusers, as knowing that conviction should always go hand
in hand with accusation, least we wrong others.

He cares for nothing that God will not give him, accounting his will best
whatsoever, and seeing the end of all the promises hang in heaven whence they
come, he expects the full performance of them, what he wants here, in heaven;
he naturally loves braverie, ostentation, riches, gentleness as well as
worldliness, but that he dares not venture Eternity of Glory, for their
purchase as some do: He acknowledges the beauty of holiness to be the only
beauty, and therefore neither esteems himself, nor any other to be more happy
or wise then they are accounted therewith. He knows no man now after the flesh,
neither regards he any merely for fleshly, but for spiritual excellency, and
therefore knowing by himself partly what is in man, he dares commit himself
unto no man without trial of him first; his passions and affections, sometimes
would fly out like a tempest, but that he has rules in readiness how to check
and restrain them from being inordinate: and in performance of holy duties when
perturbances interrupt those Sacrifices of ravenous birds, live unto Abraham,
he drives and scares them away, he has learned in all estates therewith to be
contented, and grudges not at any cross which makes him more holy, and
teaches him either more experience, wisdom, or patience.

He knows that he is a pilgrim upon earth, and like one in a strange Country
here, and therefore whilst he is upon his journey homewards is not much
troubled, what his entertainment in strange places shall be, or is, in which
case though the dogs bark, and the servants frown, yet he cares not so long as
he rests assured at length to be welcome, unto the master of the house; In
which case, though by the way, he be whipped and lasht sometimes with the scourge
of tongues, yet is he contented to bear all, knowing that it were woe with
him, if all men should speak well of him, yea that it were but a kind of
infamy to be praised of evil doers: Like good Jehosophat, you may have him
sometime forget himfelfe to be enticed into some Ahabs company, but yet even
there he is not himself, but checks himself for that adventure, and looks out
for some further and better direction, to have some better warrant for what he
is about.

His actions are all so framed as may further his latter end, neither looks he
or cares he so much what they are, as whether they carry him, in all which he
has a design and plot upon eternity of heavenly glory, he admits, loves,
and cherishes goodness in whomsoever, and amongst them the most excellent, in
whom his chief delight is. His devotions are constant both in ordinary and
extraordinary, wherein, what he misseth at one time, he makes up at another.
And as for Gods goodness and manifold favors, and blessings upon him at any
time conferred, they are so far from lifting him up that they make him the more
thankful end humble, the more he sees God in them, acknowledging himself to
be less then the least of all his mercies: He is most censorious of himself
and least of others, whose faults he loves rather to conceal, extenuate and
cover, then farther to display: Merciful, loving, compassionate, and kind he
is unto all, but especially unto those, whom Religion, Nature, Kindred or
Affinity, most strictly has tied him unto, and is as well moved to help at the
sight, as at the voice of misery; sorry that he is not able to relieve and help
all.

He is also wonderful ambitious, but it is how best he may come to be
partaker of the Divine Nature, to be filled with all diffusive goodness,
whereby to help and overcome all others therein: In all extremes he keeps the
middle way, and lays out for the golden Mean; He is contented that God be his
purs-keeper, who can keep it best, lay it out to the most advantage, and
neither suffer him either to want or be a bankrout: He knows that all Gods
works are beautiful in time, and therefore he patiently waits for the issues
of Providence: Compared with Heaven he undervalues all earthly things, and
being clothed with this Sun, can tread upon the Moon, and as Oil swims above
all waters, so has he principles in him which make him above, and to conquer
all crosses. In his afflictions, crosses and sufferings, he looks more at the
hand of God, than at the malice of men, knowing that if he can but appease the
one, giving the Messenger his errand; that he shall quickly be rid of the
other. In all companies he either does good or takes good; at least labors to
leave no ill savor by bad example: though justification be but once done on
Gods part, yet he makes it an every days work to renew the same, and engrosse
further assurance thereof. He is thankful in all things, and in all estates,
because the worst estate he can be in out of Hell, is more then his deserving;
to further which temper, he looks as well at those under him, as at those
above him: He shuns all offenses as near as he can, either to give or to take
any, and as for Revenge, he dares not so much as think of that, for fear he
intrude into Gods Office: and he makes himself all things unto all that he may
win some, knowing that he lives not here so much for himself as for others:
he is left amongst his slanderers and persecutors to keep off wrath from them,
whilst they sinning as with cart-ropes pull it upon themselves: he knows no
happiness but in holiness: and therefore accounts this only worth the looking
after to study Mary's part: most laboring in sum-like unto Christ to do all
things well, and improve his talent unto the most advantage: he is always best
when he is alone; though then an Hypocrite be at the worst, and never wants
work when he has time to examine and call to question himself for all his
words, ways, and actions; in which course every evening he cleeres his ^core,
and makes an even reckoning with the Almighty for all his offenses.

To conclude, view him well, and we shall find that there is no creature like
him, who has joys which others cannot intermeddle with: Meat which they see
not, drink which they cannot taste of: impenitrable armor which they know not,
defense and protection wherein they are naked and wanting: Apparel more costly
than Salomons in all his royalty, with directions from heaven and earth within
him and behind him, for his safe passage unto glory, Being like the Kings
daughter all glorious within, though he wear his worst side outmost: yet he
is more excellent then his neighbor, and of all others the most overcomming
creature, whose eyes are said to overcome Christ himself: Turn away thine
eyes from me, for they overcome me: he being the only true model of the new
creature, whose heart is still good and the same, whatsoever his actions be.

A matchless person saved by his God, kept by his power unto salvation: held in
his hand, who is the shield of his help, and the sword of his excellency. The
eternal God being his refuge from above, and beneath clasping him in the
everlasting arms, at whose feet Saint-like he sits down to receive of his
words. He has a heaven in his heart, his thoughts are most of heaven: his
conversation is in heaven, he sits in his head there in heavenly places: and
had he wings to fly, we should not have him long from thence. And the true
cause why the world loves him not, Is, because they know him not, and are so
blind as they cannot discern into his excellencies, they being veiled in this
world as Christ's sometimes were. But let us lend him but a lease of three
things, wherein when he fails he is usually deficient, heavenly wisdom,
knowledge, and discretion, to mingle with his zeal, and temper it: being thus
qualified he is Heavens Darling, Earths Paragon, the Worlds only wonder: who
whilst his Graces are conflicting, wrestling and shining as he mounts
Heaven-wards, out of the wilderness of this World, is justly said to be the
wonder of God himself. Thus a right Puritan or Roundhead is in his most noble
right temper, or should be qualified: and let my Roundhead be thus beautified,
and let me live his life, whatsoever his death be, and I dare venture my
Eternity with his.

FINIS.
