THE DECLARATION OF THE SEA COMMANDERS and Mariners in the Royal Navy and
Fleet, now with his Highness Prince Charles now riding on the Downs. ( August
2.)
OUr late experience of the woeful effects of War, raises in us many most sad
considerations, and fears of the unhappie continuance thereof, in this our
dear Mother Kingdom; unto the prevention of whose Calamities, we are assured
that God, and Nature, by all Obligations humane, and divine, most strictly bind
us; In discharge therefore of this our duty unto God, and our Country, we do
in the presence of God publish unto the world, that we have already used, and
shall forever hereafter use, the utmost of our endeavors, for the happy
settlement, and quiet of this distracted and bleeding Kingdom: In evidence
whereof, we have heretofore humbly petitioned both Houses of Parliament, for a
speedy Personal Treaty, betwixt his Majesty, and the two Houses, (being the
only, and so often by them selves acknowledged expedient, to establish a safe,
and well grounded peace) yet have been answered with such meditated
protractions and delays, as gave us just cause to judge, that all our
Endeavors in this kind, would prove fruitless, and that the overruling
party in both (Houses never meant any such thing: So that thoroughly observing
all our pious endeavors, (with those of others unto this purpose) herein
frustrate, we could not bethink our selves of a more speedy and effectual
course, to arrive at that blessed, and by us most desired end; [the peace and
prosperity of our Country] then by the rendition of our selves and our
returning unto our due Loyalty and Obedience, unto his sacred Majesty, our dear
Sovereign; (from whom we cannot without much sorrow but acknowledge; that the
subtle malice, and many hypocritical pretentions, of his Majesty's most
confirmed adversaries did to long alien us.) And in Order unto that to restore
unto his Majesty, as his most undoubted right) such Vessels of his Majesty's
Navy Royal, as were in our power, together with what Ships of defense we had
of our own, being by this course hopeful to render his Majesty, (now
suffering under unparalleled Oppressions) and his affairs more considerable,
unto such as opposed him, and hereby the better to dispose such, unto more
visible terms of Accommodation; that his Majesty might be restored unto his
unquestionable rights, and royal Prerogatives.

And this; we profess (before God) unto the whole world, that we could not but
know and acknowleghe our bounden duty, without a fearful incurring within our
own Consciences, the secret sentence of damnation; having by our Oaths, and so
many sacred Obligations, sollemnly sworn and protested, the preservation of
Religion established by Law, his Majesty's honor, person, and dignity, and the
Liberty of the Subject. All which we are accordingly resolved, God assisting,
unto our utmost endeavors to preserve, though with the apparent hazard of our
lives and fortunes.

And we do hereby invite all Good Subjects, Especially our brethren the Sea
Commanders, Mariners, and Seamen, unto a serious consideration of their
several and respective duties, unto these mentioned, great Interests, and
conjure them with us vigorously to prosecute so honest and honorable ends,
unto which both God, Nature, and their so often iterated Oaths, (then which
nothing can more awe a good Christian) most firmly bind them and from which,
without manifest sinning against their own Consciences, and the apparent loss
even of their souls (which God forbid) they can no ways recede; Especicially
when their Adherence unto so good and just ends, may probably put a full period
unto the present miseries of this distressed Kingdom, or notably contribute
unto so good a work; to provoke and annimate them unto the undertaking whereof
with us, let them look upon the most deploreable condition of the present
affairs in this Kingdom, let them behold the Protestant Religion, (in the
religious exercise whereof God so mightily blessed our Kingdom, in the reign of
K. Edward 6. in the happy days of never to be forgotten Q. Elizabeth, and in
the good days of K. James of blessed memory) cast out of doors, and almost
quite overgrown with Schisms and Heresies.

Behold his sacred Majesty, most disloyallie, and treacherously cast into
prison, and strictest durance; debarred the free exercise of his Religion,
deprived of the society of his beloved Queen, the comfort of his dear
children, the attendance of his faithful servants: Behold our Liberties
trampled upon, and trodden underfoot, by the Arbitrary power of a party,
supported by force, and an Army of Sectaries, who have raised Excises,
Taxations, free Quarter, and other unsupportable burdens upon us.

Look upon the universal decay of foreign trade, whereby this Island so much
flourished, and became rich and potent above all Isles, and a wonder and an
Amazement unto the whole world: what Country so ever we came to trade withal,
we found this to be true: And now we beseech you Brethren, to look upon the
sad and ill favored countenance of things amongst our selves, and how many
families in our profession, are almost, or altogether impoverished, by the
decay of foreign Traffic, and Trade, which is in a present possibility to be
quite lost unto us and our whole Nation, and to be seized upon by Strangers.
And that through the continuance of this most unnatural war, which kept up,
will bring utter ruin, and desolation unto this late flourishing Kingdom.

Two Armies are already entered into the Bowels of the Kingdom, and two more
near the entering, whence Trade both by Sea and Land will be so obstructed,
that it will be impossible to trade with any security, which as it will be unto
the exceeding Impoverishment of the people of this Kingdom, so especially unto
those of our profession.

Let us consider, that the persons from whom all these Evils come upon us, are
some few in the House of Lords, and some of the House of Commons, and their
Creatures, Excise-men, Farmers, Purchasers, of Bishops Lands, and the
Committees of the City of London, and of the Countyes: Such as have cheated
this Kingdom of many millions, and now fearing they should be called unto an
account, will not be brought to hear of a personal Treaty, or any course which
may bring peace unto this miserable Nation; Least their horrid Imposture, and
Coznage, wherewith they have abused the three Kingdoms, should be reckoned
for; to decline which by the Purse of the Commonwealth, (which they command)
they maintain an Army of desperate Sectaries, to uphold themselves, and
oppress our Religion, King, and Kingdom.

There is no way, or means under Heaven, left you or us, to restore peace unto
this afflicted Kingdom, to restore our Religion unto its ancient lusture and
beauty his Majesty unto his Rights, and our selves unto our libertyes, then by
adhereing unto his highness the Prince of Wales, who is willing to venture his
dearest blood to preserve ours; nay there is no other way left unto you to save
your Souls; For if you will not keep inviolable your just Oaths, you run the
Hazard of certain damnation, The Consideration whereof is fearful, and calls
upon you for a present resolution: Which if such as becomes you, you will
forthwith repair unto the Navy, and Fleet with his highness Prince Charles, and
in the best manner you may, tender your loyal Services unto him, for the good
Ends mentioned, which if you shall do, assure your selves, you shall not only
perform an Act exceedingly acceptable unto his Majesty, and his Highness,
worthy of your selves and most desired by us; but also pleasing unto God, as
being your bounden duty, what he requires at your hands, and the neglect
whereof he will grievously punish.

This duty of your loyallty we expect from you, and if you shall any ways
decline it, know assuredly, that as we are able, so we are resolved to debar
you of all benefit of foreign trade, and to deal with you as professed
Enemies unto your King, and Country, the very thought whereof ought to be most
odious unto every honest man, and contrary unto whom we doubt not, you will
always show your selves.

FINIS.
