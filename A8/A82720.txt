Die Jovis 28. Julii. 1642.
A DECLARATION OF The LORDS and COMMONS Assembled in PARLIAMENT, Upon
information received, that diverse of His Majesty's Soldiers under color of
his command, and in some places countenanced by his Majesty's Presence, have
violently attempted to seize on the Magazine in sundry places.
WHereas the Lords and Commons have received diverse informations from several
Counties, that the Soldiers raised by His Majesty, and that other ill affected
persons under the color of his Command, and in some places countenaunced by
His Majesty's presence do endeavor with violence, and in a hostile manner to
take away the magazines of powder, and Arms out of the possession of the
Counties (whose proper goods they are, being purchased with their own moneys)
and likewise to disarme the trayned-Bands of the County, to the end that the
said Counties being deprived of the means of their own just defense, might
be exposed to the malice, and fury of those wicked persons that should be
armed with their own weapons; It is declared by the Lords and Commons, That
whosoever shall endeavor to preserve the magazines of any county, or the Arms
of the trained, or voluntary Bands, and to defend them by force, if the same
shall be attempted to be taken away, shall do according to Law, and their
duty, as likewise all other persons shall, of what county soever, being
assistant to them therein; And they do further Order and declare that all
persons whatsoever, shall use their utmost endeavor to resist any attempt that
shall be made, for the surprise of any such magazine, or arms of the trayn'd
or voluntary Bands, and that every person in so doing shall be protected, and
saved harmless, by the authority, and power of both Houses of Parliament.

Jovis 28. July 1642.
ORdered by the Lords in Parliament, That this Declaration shall be forthwith
printed and published.
