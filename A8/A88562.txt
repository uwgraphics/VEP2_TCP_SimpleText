A SPEECH OF THE Right Honorable the Earl of LOUDEN, Lord Chancellor of
SCOTLAND.
My Lords and Gentlemen,
THe occasion of this meeting is to represent to the Honorable Houses of the
Parliament of this Kingdom, the condition of the affairs of Scotland, which
at this time is very sad, in respect that those bloody Rebels who came from
Ireland (whom this Kingdom by the large Treaty are obliged to repress) and
their treacherous Confederates and Malignants, who have conspired against the
Covenant and League betwixt the two Kingdoms; have so much prevailed in
Mischief, especially in that unhappie late rancounter with our Forces at
Kilsyth, where the Rebels being upon their march Southward, and (according to
our best intelligence) to join with the King, whom they did expect in
Scotland, or to break through our borders into England, and to come with their
Army into this Kingdom, and our Army being then very weak by reason of
their former losses and conflicts, wherein most part of our Forces were cut
off, did raise some Country Forces, and brought them along with them, and (out
of their zeal, to the good and safety of both Kingdoms) did pursue them with
more forwardness and haste then good speed or success; for the Enemy having
placed themselves in a ground of advantage, betwixt sleep Mountains on the
one hand, and Woods and Bogs on the other, possessing the best ground, wherein
a latent place they were all drawn up in battle; our Forces advanced up to
them, and the ground being very strait, and the Enemy lurking in a place where
they were not perceived till our Forces were close at them, and none of ours
being drawn up, nor put in order but only the Regiment that marched in the
Van, the Enemy did fall upon them with their whole Horse and Foot, and after
fighting with that first Regiment (who did fight very valiantly till oppressed
with the multitude of the Enemies whole Forces) they were most part cut off,
and the rest broken: the few Horse we had retreated disorderly, breaking
through their own Foot, and all being in disorder the Enemy prevailed, and
routed our Forces with great execution, giving quarter to no^e.

After this sad blow, we having no other Army, not reserve of Forces on the
Fields, some Towns near the Enemy, wherein there be many Malignants ready to
welcome them, and others out of fear were glad to capitulate with the Enemy,
and submit themselves to their mercy, upon such conditions as they could
obtain.

The deportment of the Enemy since, is by all craft and cruelty to strengthen
and recruit their Army, wherein they leave no means unessayed that policy or
violence can effect; they offer Peace and protection, Immunitie from all
Excise, Assessements, raised for the entertainment of our Armies in Scotland,
England, and Ireland, and the ratifying of the former Covenant of Scotland, to
all that shall join with them or lie Neutrall; and (as they term it) return
to their loyalty and obedience to the King, and shall renounce the mutual
League and Covenant with England; and such as will not, are threatened with Fire
and Sword, which in diverse places they put to execution most cruelly: And
Montrosse, as the Kings Lieutenant-Generall, Issues forth Commissions to Popish
and Malignant Lords, and other, to Array the Country for the King.

Papists and diverse Malignants, who before were with them in their hearts, but
durst not appear, are now avowdly joined with them; others out of fear to
preserve themselves, their wives and children from destruction of the Sword and
Fire, are fled, and some take protections from them: the Enemy is roaring and
tryumphing in the heart of the Kingdom, and is now possessed of the Houses,
Lands, and Estates of many Noblemen, Gentlemen, and others of the best affected
in the Kingdom, to whom nothing is left but Families without maintenance,
honor without means to support it, and who are under all the grievous
Calamities of War, and under the mercy of a most cruel and bloody Enemy,
not having (when I came from that Kingdom) any Army in the Fields to oppose
them. And in the mean time the Angel of God is striking our Cities,
especially Edenbrough, the chief City of that Kingdom, with the Plague of
Pestilence so fearfully, as there is no living there, nor any Commerce, Trade,
nor exchange of Money, which increases our difficulties to maintain a War,
and a Parliament is indicted by Montrosse, to establish all these iniquities by
a Law.

In this our extremity, we were forced to have our recourse to our Armies in
England and Ireland, to crave their aid; and for that end I am sent hither to
the Honorable Houses of Parliament, to represent to them and this Honorable
Meeting the necessity of calling our Army, for the relief and safety of
their Native Country, and that the party who was nearest them, under the
conduct of Lieutenant General David Lesly, might with all possible speed march
into Scotland, to whom the Committee did earnestly write for that effect: this
was the readiest remedy which did fall within the compass of their present
consideration; they desire, and are confident, to find the Honorable Houses
approbation thereof, there being no hope of assistance from our Army in
Ireland.

Their next desire to the Honorable Houses is, that the Wars in Scotland
against these bloody Rebels, may be carried on by the joint Counsels and
assistance of both Kingdoms, against the common enemies of both Nations, and
the Cause wherein we are so deeply engaged, the War and our Enemies being
still the same, and the place of our War only changed; and if the King or
his forces break into Scotland that proportionable forces from the Parliament
may closely follow them.

No man has conscience or honesty, but he will remember the solemn League
and Covenant, the Treaty, and the Declarations of both Kingdoms, which are
the strongest bonds betwixt God and man, and betwixt man and man, and Nation
and Nation, before the world: no man has true zeal to Religion, that will
shrink for such adversity and opposition, as has been ordinary in the like
work, and has been obvious to us since our first undertaking, but has been
always overcome by the assistance of God: no man has prudence, will hope for
a powerful and prosperous War, or any firm or true peace, but in the
conjunction of both Kingdoms.

How great then would the sin and shame be, if either Nation, against so
manifold Obligations whereby we stand obliged before God and the world, should
desert other in this Cause?

How great advantage would it be to our common Enemy, who has still followed
that Machiavilian Maxim, Divide and impera, to get us divided, and the
greatest favor either Nation could expect in the end is, but to be the last
that shall be devoured?

As in the time of your greatest distress and lowest ebb, when Scotland
enjoyed peace and quietness, they did from their sympathy of your sufferings
forsake their own peace for your aid, apprehending also your mine and
servitude might be a forerunner of theirs; so if this Kingdom shall withdraw,
or be wanting in their assistance to us, in the day of our distress, brought
upon us for imbarking with them, and we perish in it; will it not usher in and
hasten upon you that same ruin, intended from the beginning by our common
enemy? And if the godly and honest party in that Kingdom perish for want of
assistance, you may certainly expect as great an Army from the^^^ for your
destruction, as came formerly for your preservation; which God forbid.

But from our Brethren of England, and the Honorable Houses of Parliament, who
are the true Pilots, set at the Helm in so great a storm, we expect better
and greater things, that their whole authority, power and means will in this
exigent be aiding to us: And it is the firm resolution of that Kingdom, by
Gods grace, never to forsake this, but against all opposition, with courage and
constancy to live and die with you in this Cause; and although all the world
should forsake us, so long as there is one drop of blood in our veins, we
resolve never to relinquish this Work, but to put our confidence in the
justness of the Cause, and in the invincible power of God, whose Cause it is,
till it please him by a prosperous War, or happy Peace (which we still desire
may by all good means be sought after) to put an end to our troubles, trusting
he will strengthen us and send deliverance to his people: But if either Nation
draw back their hand, or deal trecherously in it, their judgment and doom
will be harder then I desire to pronounce.

FINIS.
