SAd News by the Post, from Albion, does me call,
To know what mighty Planet there did fall
So lately down, that all the people were
In darkness, till another placed there.
Some say 'twas Mars, or some such Ruling star;
For they had never his like, to manage War:
Some say 'twas Jupiter; for such was He,
A Juvans Pater to the Nations three.
Planets (we know) do govern Countries, Men,
And other things below; but God rules them:
So here, this Planet ruled, with awe, and love,
Being always ruled himself by God above.
Our grief for Him, and joy for his Successor,
We know not which was greater, nor which lesser.
When War was at the height of tears and blood,
The LORD sent OLIVER the Great, and Good,
Who proved our Olive Branch, and Peace he got
To all in time, but those that loved it not:
Most fit PROTECTOR was he then to be,
To keep that Peace he gained the Nations three.
Not resting here, but better to secure
Our Peace at home, abroad he did procure
A Peace with all our Neighbour-Nations, and
With honor much to him, and to our Land.
Then martially did he so act abroad,
He whipped the Spaniard with an English rod;
So that the Popish Donns in several parts
Do tremble in their Kingdoms, and their hearts.
What Plots with vain attempts were against our Land!
Yet God did prosper all he took in hand;
And he preserved by Grace, until become
The worthiest Worthy of all Christendom:
Then Europe's Corner-pillar being grown fit
For Heavens throne, was summoned there to sit;
Who (as in life his precepts were to obey)
Being called (too soon for us) he went his way.
But here is another Post: What news, my Friend?
Is Albion's HERO dead, as some pretend?
He is not dead; nor can he die, whose Fame
Will ever live in honor, and his Name
So great in Albion, that S. George has been
Forgotten there, till on a Sign-post seen:
S. David'n Wales, and Andrew for the Scot,
Were never so great as was this Patriot.
S. Patrick was for Ireland renowned,
And France for glory have S. Dennis crowned;
The Italian Anthony, and James for Spain,
Did never for them, as He for us did gain:
The Dutch-man's Champion that did Trump about,
And for the ninth take in Gustavus stout;
Yet read them all together in true story,
You Will find them short of Oliver his glory:
So that his Enemies can say no less,
He was a Cato, and an Hercules:
His Wisdom, Courage, ruled our Commonwealth,
And yet took little glory to himself,
But gave it where 'twas due; and so should we
Give thanks to God for him eternally.
Yet greater was his good; He did provide
That we should not be left without a Guide;
But after him find settled here we see
The primest Branch of that fair Olive Tree:
Whose noble virtues fill our expectations,
He Will be a second Glory of our Nations;
As by the Anagrams of both we see
What was the one, the other like to be.
Grieve not in vain then, but rejoice the rather
For such a Son succeeding such a Father.
Long live brave Richard then! Your help being such,
The LORD takes Care You may by him Rule much.
As by this Anagram: Richard Cromwell -- Lord care, I rule much.
Vivat, videat, vireat and vincat RIC. Pr. semper.
More Anagrams on their HIGHNESSES and their Family.
RICHARD CROMWELL, A much Lordly Curer. HENRYE CROMWELL, Love mercy'n Rule.
ELISABETH CROMWELL, Chaste love be my rule. JOHN CLEYPOLE, Lo, I coin help.
ELISABETH CLEYPOLE, A holily blessed piece. DOROTHY CROMWELL, Come Lordly worth.
CHARLES FLEETWOOD, Free loved, Chaste love. BRIDGET FLEETWOOD, O true gifted
beloved. THO FAULCONBRIDGE, Begin, Act famous Lord. MARY FAULCONBRIDGE, Go main
careful Bride. FRANCEIS RICH, '^ Richer Fancy.


The LORD protect -- our LORD-PROTECTOR. So humbly prays -- THO. DAVYES,
Pembr:sh.
