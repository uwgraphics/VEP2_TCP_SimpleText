The Railer Rebuked, in a reply to a paper subscribed Ellis Bradshaw, who calls
it The Quakers whitest devil unvailed: But has discovered a dark Devil in
himself, as in his paper appears, replied by him who is called James Nailer.
Now is the Lord raining snares on the wicked, and thick darkness shall cover
them.
THe fruitful generation we own and witness, and so we profess and practice
as that generation ever did who in all ages have ever borne witness against the
worlds unrighteous ways, false Faiths, and formal worships, which hirelings
and false prophets have set up in their imaginations from the letter: and that
faith we know and the fruits of it: which ever were found enemies and false
accusers, of those who were led by that spirit which is before the letter was,
by which the letter was brought into the wo^ld, which the prince of this world
has ever made use on to withstand such as brought forth the life of the
scriptures into the world. And that under the name of some zealous profession*
calling themselves Jews children of Abraham, the Temple circumcision and such
like, even as you now who profess Faith and Baptism, calling your selves
Christians, but are found in direct opposition (as thou say) unto this
generation of sufferers and messengers of God, slandering, nick-naming them,
but calling themselves Christians, and there the serpent would hide his head,
but out of your holes you must come, by your fruits to be tried what sort of
Christians you are* for they were no Christians who upheld the hirelings, and
pleaded for them, as thou do: nor they who called them Masters; they were no
Christians who worshipped in the Idols Temple, who beat in the synagogues, and
hailed before Rulers, and imprisoned such as came to witness against the
hirelings, and their Idol worship. They were no Christians that sued people
for Tithes or wages, and bare rule by their means, nor the people that loved to
have it so, and called such faithful laborers, as thou do. They were no
Christians who by petitions or otherwise stirred up the powers of the earth
against the innocent to persecute and kill the persons for reproving their
wickedness, or who laid snares for such as reproved sin in the gates: these
were the wolves and are the wolves Christ speaks on, who are out of the light
of Christ: and that is the spirit of Antichrist in thee that pleads for such,
and calls them helps and means to guide in all the ways of God, who are found
in the steps of the Pharisees and false prophets, withstanding the ways of
God, in the devises of men, and by their fruits they are known: and who calls
these sheep are blind, though with the name of Christians they be cloated: and
these are they with which thou are seriously engaged (as thou say) to deny
all who speak against them, and here thou art engaged against Christ, and the
seared conscience thou speak on appears in upholding such as the scripture
condemns which thou call faithful laborers; and beliest Christ saying he
has thrust them forth, who has ever denied such, and those that upheld them,
but they have thrust themselves in, and run unsent, for gifts and rewards:
And thou deniest the life of Christ, therefore must needs bring forth the life
of the devil, and plead for it in others, slandering and lying, upon us, and
the spirit of God, saying it teaches you not to own any perfection in Christ
as properly yours: and here I charge thee before the Lord whom thou have
denied, to stop thy mouth for ever meddling to judge of the people of Christ,
his righteousness or perfection, who have no propriety in it, but have denied
him before all men to be properly thine; for who has him, has his perfection,
whom we witness to be freely given to us of our Father, and him we have
received, and he is properly ours, with all his perfection and power, in him we
have power to do the will of God, and through him that strengthens us, can do
all things that God requires of us; which thou deniest also: and herein we
justify God, and his gift to be perfect, and the power of God in Christ his
will to do, and his law to fulfill in us, and this is the righteous Covenant
God has given, which we witness, and if any abide not in the will of God, and
this power, but go into condemnation, let God be clear of his blood for ever
who is departed out of the way of God, and his power, which is perfect freedom
to all that abide in it: But this the babes know, and not the wolves; and the
purity of Christ we own, (which thou deniest) and that hope that leads thee to
it is the hope of the hippocrite, and shall perish: and a^l that have Christ
have the true light and word within them, and need go no more out to seek it
in Babel, though thou would imply the contrary: and this the Apostles
ministered out, which was within in them: and this word and light we witness in
us, which cannot be contained, nor darkness comprehend it* And thou talks of
the spirit teaching you that Christ your righteousness was sacrificed for you,
and in another place thou say, the spirit teached you to deny his perfection
to be yours: But what spirit is this which ownes his righteousness and denies
her perfection; is not his righteousness perfection? this is the lying spirit
thou chargest us with, which thou listens to, which rules in thy deluded heart;
and manifest is thy confusion to all who know Christ and his perfection. And
thou say you have no intent to establish your own righteousness, but what
else can thou establish who have not that righteousness thine which is
perfect; that is thine own which is not perfect, for the least measure of the
righteousness of Christ is perfect: thou say the spirit of God teaches you
to honor all men: and here thou art seen in thy own will, and personal
admiration, honoring thou know not what with the proud clothing, and the
gold ring, men in their greatness and pride, and this is not in the Lord, but
in the earth: and thou belyest the spirit of God, if thou do say it teaches
this honor, and condem^es the practice of the Saints, yea Christ himself, who
could not honor Herod here, but called him a Fox, though he was a king: and by
the spirit of Jesus that honor is judged to be for the dust, and that which
here thou honor, for condemnation. But that which is honored by the spirit
of God is that power which is of God, in whom ever he has placed it without
respect of persons, that sword that cuts down sin, and executes the Law of God
upon offenders without respect of persons, they that resist this power receive
to themselves damnation, which that in every conscience does witness, and there
is honor to whom honor is due, But no place for pride, nor the prince of
pride to be worshipped, who therefore rages and says, (in them where he is
exalted) that we would destroy Mgistracy, but is a Liar and has so been proved
in all ages, for that spirit which denies to honor men in their pride,
preserves Magistracy, even from such as will bow and flatter to the face, but
would destroy in secret, and that seed was manifest in Mordecai, who saved the
Kings life, and yet would not obey his commands to Bow to Hamans pride, also in
Christ, and many of the dear servants of God who never went about to destroy
Magistracy but preserved it, who said, give Caesar his due, and God his due, and
yet was accused to be an enemy to Caesar, by those who were enemies both to
Caesar and God, and yet had a large profession as thou have who art found in the
same accusation; and so the devil has been in all ages, who cannot have that
seed to bow to him, in proud man in whom he is exalted above all that is called
God; for that seed is taught of God what to honor, and to honor that which
God honors, and this is no spirit of delusion, incivility, or like brute
beasts as thou call it, for that is the Beast which worships the Beast and
his Image, where it is; and thou art the false prophet that pleads for it, and
this we judge not before the time (as thou accusest us) for the Son of God is
come, to whom all judgment belongs, and has given us an understanding in all
these things, and the spirit of judgment is powered out, and the prince of this
world is judged and condemned, and the Dragon, and the hireling, and the
deceiver, and the proud, and the carnal (thor speak on) which thou would
have spared under a pretense of charity; and says, the spirit of God teaches
so, which the spirit of God has ever condemned such; but this is the spirit of
the devil who under pretense of charity would keep his own works from
judgment, the proud, the carnal, the hireling, and the deceiver, and
demonstrated this is though the blind cannot see it: and thy charity I deny,
who loves these things and would hold them up. And he that is risen to overturn
these, his work shall praise him in the gate, and flatterers shall run to the
mountains to cover them: and thou says I belly your doctrine, because I deny
that faith which cannot believe salvation from sin to the ut^ermost, or that
says they have Christ and have not power. To which I answer, they that say
none can be free from committing sin while they live, (as your teachers do)
hold forth that faith which I deny. And for Christ having empowered any to do
the will of God, thou thy felf opposes in this paper: and here I have not
belied your doctrine, but the lie is thy own, though thou say the spirit
teaches to speak truth in love and meekness; and this doctrine is quite
contrary to the word and promise of God, who said he should save his people
from their sins, and present holy without spot or wrinckle or any such thing,
and this we know, and are one with him, but thou who have not propriety in his
perfection, art ignorant of it, and therefore thinks us to be so too; And thou
chargest us for denying that faith to be in Christ, whose righteousness is not
perfect, because the righteousness of Christ is perfect: To which I affirm that
because the righteousness of Christ is perfect: therefore that faith I deny to
be in Christ which lays hold upon an imperfect righteousness; And thou say
the righteousness of Christ is not properly ours, but only through frith, and
here thou denies faith to be proper, or the gift of God by faith received to be
properly ours; and then God has given an improper thing, which is not theirs,
for believers to be saved by; and this is thy doctrine and conjured stuff from
the letter, imagined by a spirit of direct opposition (as thou say) thou
have against us; and rather then thou will be silent thou will speak thou
know not what. And thou take offense that we should witness the life of
Christ, or that he that has this hope purifieth himself as he is pure, and
when thou have done, thou say thou endeavourest to purify thy self even as
he is pure; and here thou discoverest thy wolfish inside (thou tells on) who
accusest us for witnessing the Scripture in that which thou thy self endeavors
after; and diverse other things thy mischievous mind murmurs at, and in thy
paper wonldst cast a mist before the truth, but dare not deny them, and here
thy whited devil is seen and bound: And thou say thou have learned not to
account thy self already perfect: I answer, what perfection can thou have who
deniest the perfection of Christ to be thine (unless thou be perfect in
iniquity;) and the least child of light shall thee judge, who art setting the
old Covenant above the new, to be judge and tryer of it, which old the Apostle
denies, to establish this new; for the old Covenant made nothing perfect: and
there thou art who denies the perfection of the new to be thine: and here thy
spirit is tried, with that which is before the old Covenant was, to be that
delusion of Satan, thou tellest on, who would try the Covenant of life with
that which can give no life, and by such a trial did the Jews put Christ to
death for a blasphemer, by the letter of their Law who was the life of the Law,
which life is the end of all laws without; yet herein is not laws without
denied, but fulfilled in Christ, for whom they were written: and thou say
thou ownes that faith which purifies the heart, and produces holiness, within
and without, and yet thou denyest the perfection of Christ to be tbine; or to
be empowered by him to do the will of God: and this purity and holiness which
is not thine in Christ, and in his power, I deny, and the ground of it I judge
with that which is perfect; that this thy holiness is the silthy rags. And
thou talkst of many things without thee, as a law without, a light without, a
word without, and many such words thou utterest, but with that eye which is
single, which is before the visible was, art thou seen and comprehended, and
thy faith that stands in visible things which shall perish, for what is seen is
temporal, but so is not the law, and light, and word which endures for ever,
though thou would prove the letter to be the word, which was never given
forth to be called by the name of God or Christ (who are called the word) nor
to withstand the appearance of God or his word, as you would use them, as some
of your rabbis have lately affirmed, that God has spoken his last, for the
Scriptures, say they, is his last will, and no more Revelations since the book
of Revelations was written, and thus Idolizes a visible thing, and gives it the
name of God, and sets it in his place, and says there is no other way to know
God, all which the letter denies, and declares God to be the word, and exhorts
to hear his voice and know it, and says there is not, nor can be any knowledge
of God but by Revelation from Jesus Christ which is before the letter was,
which the letter declares, but this is the spirit of Satan that would stop the
mouth of God never to speak more, nor that any should wait for it; but he that
has heard the voice of the living God does bear witness in his presence
against that spirit to be a lying spirit, and an enemy to Abraham's seed and his
Faith, who stands opposing between God and the creatures, to make people
believe that they shall not have the same fellowship with God as the saints
have ever had, but would set up the letter in his stead, spoken forth by them
who heard his voice, and declared for that end his word to wait for, and his
teachings to witness by him to be guided in all things, which such as thou
would deny to set up the hirelings who never heard his voice, but were ever
denied by them who had the word as the letter declares, and proves all you
Liars who puts the Lord far from you in these later days, which, says in
the latter days, he will pour out his spirit more abundantly and that the
knowledge of God shall cover the earth, which is witnessed by hundreds who from
the mouths of the wolves and liars are set free, which whilst we were under
them we could not believe, and we know whom we worship and his power, and all
the liars in the world cannot make us deny him, nor his work in us, who is
blessed for ever: And thy doubtful queries are answered, and with the spirit
we are taught, this faith to hold forth, and with meekness they are showed, and
in that wisdom that is foolishness to the world and ever was, and his virtues
who has called us out of darkness into light, and this faith works by love
to all the creatures of God, and by it we are constrained to call all to this
love, for which we suffer in you Streets, Markets, and Synagogues, in a spirit
of meekness, and this we have learned of him, which is more then thou know
(as thou say) for if thou knew thou would not have a hand, in which thou art
deeply engaged as thou says, And it is utterly in vain to write or speak
against this faith, for therein thou shows but thy folly, and what generation
thou art of, who calls this perverted which the saints practiced, and thou that
doubts art damned in thy own conscience, and being deluded to believe lies,
thou art rejected and steadfastly resisted in the faith, who art under the
power of Satan, bringing forth his works, who says we in works deny God, and
that we know not what the resurrection of the dead means, and then says thou
w^lt not absolutely determine nor judge of us, and here thou have told three
lies together, and its easy to determine, who is that vassal (thou speaks on)
led captive at his will, And the word of God we have, and his law, written in
our hearts which condemns all such practices; And the fruits of love such
could never discern, nor the end of the Commandment, but under pretense of
charity would be flattered in their sins: And we know Christ to be in us
without thy comparisons, and by his spirit are we led, which if thou was so
thou durst not lie and slander as thou do, nor have rested my words in
printing them false in thy paper, saying, I deny all those laws without, as
though I denied the laws of the Nation, when my words is, I deny all whose law
is without and moral intending your popish notions, with which you set up the
letter to oppose the new Covenant, yet herein do I deny no Laws in Books which
are according to this Covenant, but own them in their place, but not to try
the law of life which is in Christ, by (as thou would make it) and here thy
crooked ways are seen, subtle lying, slandering, and perverting my words: and
the whited Devil thou tells on, is discovered in thy self, not in the Quakers
as thou scornfully call us, and thou have the seared conscience thou tells
on, else ashamed thou would be, and to thee I have written and all thy
generation, but not for your help, but to help thee to see thy folly which to
that of God in thy Conscience, if thou be obedient, it will stop thy mouth and
let thee see thy envy and a busy mind, speaking evil of that thou knows not,
that thou may appear to be some body, but thy work is seen, and thy reward
also: And now seeing these things thou chiefly opposest, yet dare not plainly
deny them, I shall return the sum of them by way of Querie, to which in
plainess that thou answer the Yea or the Nay, that thy mist may be cleared, is
the demand of him who is called James Nayler?

First, Whether that Faith which lays hold of an Imperfect Righteousness, be
Faith in Christ, or self righteousness?

Whether God can own an Imperfect Righteousness for salvation, or is any
perfect but that of Christ?

Whether God have given Christ with his righteousness and perfection, freely
to all that receive him?

Whether Christ so given, and by faith received, be properly ours with all he
has, in the measure so received?

Whether any one can be born of God and not have the life of Christ in him, and
abiding in him? whether he commit sin or no?

Whether the Law of the new Covenant be written in the heart? And whether the
Apostle denied the Old to Establish the New? and whether of them is the
believers rule and freedom?

Whether the hope of Christ purifies the heart? and is not that the hope of
thee hippocrite that hopes to be saved, but lives in sin and worldly pleasures?
and whether that be the life of Christ, yea or nay?

Whether every one that has received Christ, has received power to resist the
devil and to do the wills of God in his measure, and if such commit sin,
whether it be want of power, or denying the power, seeing the greater is in us
then in the world?

Whether they that are called of men Masters, love greeting in Markets, Chief
place in Assemblies, sue for tithes, or set wages, bear rule by their means,
Imprison the Innocent, be those laborers Christ has thrust out into his
vineyard: Or do these fruits prove them so, seeing Christ says by their fruits
you shall know them?

Whether the end of Christ's coming be to redeem his people from their sins in
this life, or are they believers that deny it?

Whether the spirit of God teaches to call Christ ours, and his righteonsnesse
ours; but to deny his perfection to be ours?

Whether the letter be that word and light of John, Christ, and the Apostles
bear witness on, yea or nay?

Whether plain dealing be pure love, seeing thou pretendest Charity to spare the
wicked?

FINIS.
