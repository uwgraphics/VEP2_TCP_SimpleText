A DECLARATION OF THE LORDS and COMMONS Assembled in Parliament.
THe Lords and Commons taking into consideration the miserable distractions and
calamities with which this whole Kingdom and Nation is now infested, the face
and cruel effects of an unnatural civil War, being too visible, and
apparent in all the parts thereof, and the power of the Sword so prevailing, as
that the public Justice of the Kingdom cannot be expected to be administered
in a just and indifferent way, but that the Judges and Ministers thereof may be
terrified, and awed by the power of Armed men; And also for preventing of
inconveniences, which may happen by assemblies of multitudes of people, in
these times of such miserable distractions; Have thought fit to order, and the
said Lords and Commons in Parliament assembled do Ordain and Declare, That
the several Judges and Justices of the Assize, and Nisi-prius and Justices of
Oyer and Terminer, and Goale-delivery, and their Associates, and the Clerks of
Assize, and every of them, of or within any the Counties or Cities of England,
and Dominion of Wales, do forbear to execute any the said Commissions, or to
hold or keep any Assizes or Goale-delivery, at any time during this Summer
vacation; Or to issue any Warrant for summoning the Assizes, within any County
in which they shall be appointed Judges or Justices; And if they have already
issued any, that they forthwith revoke, and recall the same; And herein their
ready and perfect obedience is expected and required, as they will answer the
contempt and neglect hereof before the Lords and Commons in Parliament.

Die Lunae, 10 Julii. 1643.
