IT is thought fit by diverse persons of quality, who met on Friday last at
Scriveners Hall, to advise how just Debts may be secured, upon honorable and
advantageous propositions, to the Parliament. That all persons who have any
Debts owing them, by such who are with the King, do sum up a total thereof,
without nominating, either Debtor or Creditor, and send the same to the shop
of Jonathan Blackwell Scrivener, on the Northside of the Royal Exchange; to
be entered. And that the usual meeting place for this business, is to be at
the late house of Alderman Freeman, in Cornehill, where there is another
general meeting on Wednesday next, between two and three of the clock in the
afternoon*

This 16 of August, 1644.
