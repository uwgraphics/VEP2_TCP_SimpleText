ENGLANDS Prosperity.
THe Institution of our Parliaments is very ancient; Some hold they were in use
among the Saxons, but the more certain opinion is, they are derivative from
the Norman Conqueror, being indeed the very Essence and primum mobile of the
Fundamental Laws of this Kingdom; the Subjects best inheritance, the Charter
by which he holds his liberty.

In the Reign of William the Conqueror his time, being most employed in
France, we read not of any memorable act performed by Parliament, the Kingdom
being then as it were in parties, and the Laws in their infancy: Nor in his
sons William Rufus reign, till upon his decease the Body of the kingdom,
says William Rishanger, chose for their head King Beauclarke discarding Robert
Duke of Normandy his elder brother from the government; so supreme was the
dignity of the Parliament in those days, that for the good of the people, who
desired not a stranger should rule over them, Robert being an alien borne, and
Henry at Selby in Yorkshire, that it could confer the royalty on him that
only had his right in the Sovereignty by the Parliaments Election and
sufferage. The same Parliament to unite the ancient Saxon blood Royal, with
the Norman, engaging him to marry Matilda the daughter of Malcolme King of
Scots, being the only heir of Edmund Ironside. The same Parliament or another
in his Reign obtaining from that good King many Franchises and Privileges for
the subject.

King Stephen the successor to his Uncle made no great use of the Honorable
the High Court of Parliament, being indeed an usurper, he was assured that just
and wise Assembly could never be so much recreant to their natural virtue, as
to underprop by their strength his former claim against the right heir Maud
the Empress, whose son Henry the short Mantle, Parliamentary power rather
then his forces, settled in the Royalty. This powerful King made frequent and
special use of his Parliaments, both for the supplying his coffers exhausted
in his expensive wars; and for settling the affairs of the kingdom, a
Parliament in his reign settling the confusion of our common Laws, gathering
the best of the Norman constitutions, and adding to them the best of King
Alfreds and Saint Edwards Laws; It made up the body of our fundamental
Statutes. The same Parliament for the ease and benefit of the subject obtaining
from that King Judges itinerant that should ride the several circuits of the
kingdom, and bring the people right home to their own doors: His son the
Lyon-hearted Richard, in his wars in the Holy Land, receiving from his subjects
the bounteous provision of his Parliaments in nine years, eleven hundred
thousand marks, a stupendous sum says one in those days, ere the Indean
Treasury had oresiowed the world, though they were not at all for the profit of
the people, were mightily to the honor of the Nation in general, as those
days went; So that it is apparent our Parliaments have always been as
careful of the kingdoms honor as its profit.

King John his successor indeed an usurper, declined the use of Parliaments
till his necessities enforced him to call them and rely on them: Our
Parliaments having always been our Kings best helpers at dead lifts,
furnishing them from the public store, when either mischance, or if
superfluity had exhausted, their private Treasuries

When this King alienating from the virtue of his Ancestors, sought not only
the oppression of the subject, but to inslave the Crown to a foreign yoke,
to avoid excommunication, and to win him to his party, holding his Royalty of
the Pope. The Parliament mindful of the subjects safety took righteous arms
up against them, and got the charter of their Liberty, sealed them, his son
Henry the third as he reigned longest of all our Kings, so he had the most to
do with the high Court of Parliament, with whom for the Liberty of the
Subject, that Assembly had many and frequent contentions at Oxford: A
Parliament in his Reign (all places of credit and trust being conferred upon
aliens the Kings kinsmen and half brothers) took upon them to redress those
abuses, displacing those up-starts from their usurped dignities, and banished
them the kingdom.

Parliamentary power was never more useful to the Subject then in these times,
nor never was it is power better managed. When the King having again got new
and evil Ministers that wasted the treasure and Crowne-lands on themselves and
followers; The usual reply of their servants to the complaints of the Kings
Subjects, as says William of Kishanger, being quis tibi rectum faciet quod
Dominus meus vult. Dominus Rex vult. Then did the Parliament by force rectify
those abuses when fair means would not prevail, and thence indeed grew those
long lasting Barrons wars, wherein the Liberty and property of the subject had
been swallowed in the gulf of the Royal Prerogative, had not the Parliament
preserved it; so careful has that great and wise Assembly always bin of the
kingdoms safety, and so advantageous to the commodity of the subject.

Edward the first, our English Justinian made often and good use of his
Parliaments, which liberally furnished him with money for his Scottish wars,
the Parliament supplying him with money, being the maine occasion of his
conquests; there those Parliaments in lieu of their liberality obtaining from
that good and gracious King the ample confirmation of their former privileges,
diverse new ones being added to those of Magna Charta, as the mitigation of
those rigorous laws of the forests, which did most undo the subjects
safeties, many excellent and useful Statutes, being enacted in those
Parliaments. The Jews, that both by their irreligion and usury, were grown
odious to the people, being not as in former Kings reigns fined, but their
ill-gotten goods confiscated, and themselves for ever banished the kingdom.

Edward the second, a dissolute and unfortunate Prince, complied not with his
Pa^^iament but his Minions, and was at last by a Parliament deposed, and the
royalty conferred on his son, that great Edward the third; who still relying
on the love and loyalty of his people, was powerful and victorious in France,
the Parliaments assembled here furnishing him with plentiful supplies of
treasure to pay his soldiers, and by those sums purchased still new
infranchisements for the Subjects, that glorious King being every whit as
careful to institute good and wholesome laws for his people here, as he was
desirous to conquer in France. That unfortunate grandchild of his, Richard 2.
seduced by flatterers, and led away to Oppressions and Injustices by his evil
ministers, the Subject groaning under their tyrannies, had only recourse to
the Parliament for relief: that great and famous Parliament that wrought
wonders, being in his reign wherein forces were raised by the noblest Peers
and faithful commons for the punishment of the Kings malignant councillors.
Vere Tresilian and the rest, who from the Parliament received a due reward for
their trecheries; and that last this King who never would adhere to his
Parliaments advice was by Parliament degraded of his royalty, and the Crown
conferred by their act upon Henry the fourth, who confiding in his Parliament,
repressed by their help all domestique troubles and foreign Enemies: his
son that thunderbolt of war, Henry the fifth, by his Parliaments bounty, made
an absolute conquest of France, so that indeed all the glorious atchievments of
our English Monarchs are to be attributed to the care of and providence of
Parliaments: Henry the sixth, during the life of his Uncles, Bedford and
Gloucester, was happy and feared abroad, as well as loved at home; those good
Dukes, both to defend their foreign conquests, and to preserve the Majesty of
their Nephew at home, summoning many Parliaments, at last the Parliament in
it is justice taking notice of the undoubted right of Richard Duke of York, to
the Crown and the usurpation of the house of Lancaster, by their act settled the
royalty upon his Progeny, disclaiming the son of Henry the sixth, though a
gallant Prince.

Edward the fourth, the first Monarch of the House of York, was, though not a
frequent caller of Parliaments; yet when they were assembled, a great consenter
to them, and at their request a continual confirmer of the peoples Immunities;
so was he, who though held the worst of men, is reputed among the best of our
Kings. The Tyrant, Richard the third, who at his Parliaments devised many new
and wholesome Laws for the benefit of the people: how rich, how puissant and
glorious Henry the seventh lived and di'd by the Parliaments advice and
furtherance, is not unknown to all that know our Histories, the union between
the two so long jarring Houses, though continued by private persons, being
ratified and confirmed by Parliament.

Henry the eighth's reign afforded plurality of Parliaments, and very materious
ones; at one of them that great Act (the more wondered at then the extirpation
of Episopacie could be now) was passed for the demolishment of those rich
Abbeys, the nurseries of sloth and licenciousnesse; for the not only excluding
miter'd Abbots from having votes in Parliament, but for their utter
annihilating, their mighty revenues being confined the Kings: At another
Parliament the power of the Pope was banished this Island, and the Supreme
Ecclesiastical government annexed to the Prerogative Royal; so careful have
our Parliaments always been, not only to preserve, but augment the dignity of
our King. A Parliament in Edward the sixth's time refined Religion from all the
dregs of Romish superstition, and settled the purity of Religion in this
Kingdom, which obscured and altered in Queen Mary's reign, was in her
sisters, of famous memory, by Parliamentary power settled again into it is old
order, how happy and glorious was that Queen during her long reign by relying
on her Parliament: what blessings were derived from the Prince to the people,
and from the people to the Prince: so it was i^ King James his time, no
difference at all ever happening between him and his Parliament; at one of
which himself with his whole Nobility, had not God miraculously prevented it,
had been by the Papists divellish conspiracy sold to destruction; nor
certainly had there ever been emergent this strange distemper between King
Charles and this his honorable and loyal Parliament, had the King bin as
ready to comply with their just desires, as they were to perform their duties
to him; never was Parliament so hopeful, never had the State so much need of
physic, because it was never so desperately sick: never were wholsomer
medicines applied to cure its distempers, then has been by this Parliament,
had not perverse malignants altered and transformed the Kings intentions from
his Parliament now assembled, heaven send a speedy union between them, and
there is no doubt but the Parliament (whom God preserve from all dangers) will
make the King great and glorious, and the Subject fortunate and flourishing.

FINIS.
