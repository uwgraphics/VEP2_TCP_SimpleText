A GODLY EXHORTATION TO THIS DISTRESSED NATION.
Showing the true cause of this unnatural Civil War amongst us.
PSALM. L. VERSE XV. Call upon me in the time of trouble, so will I hear thee,
and thou shall praise me.

When pride abounds in the City,
And peoples hearts are void of pity;
When little children learn to swear,
And wickedness abounds each where.
Then let Gods people cry and call
Good Lord have mercy on us all.
When as Gods service is neglected,
And able Ministers rejected:
When Popery rests in the land,
And strives to get the upper hand.
Then let Gods people cry and call
Good Lord have mercy on us all.
When people they have itching eats,
Desturb our Church, and grieve our Peers:
When men despise good government,
And spurn against the Parliament.
It Is time for us to cry and call
Good Lord have mercy on us all.
When as the Kingdom is divided,
And by the sword the cause decided:
When Law and Justice take no place,
And people lose their hold of grace.
It Is time for us to cry and call
Good Lord have mercy on us all.
When people stumble at a straw,
And make their own self will a Law:
When people makes sanctity
A cloak to hide hypocrisy.
It Is time for us to cry and call
Good Lord have mercy on us all.
When people for mere trifles quarrel,
And make a Pulpit of a barrel:
When people run from place to place,
Unreverently Gods Church deface,
It Is time for us to cry and call
Good Lord have mercy on us all.
When some that cannot read nor write
Shall tell us of a newfound light,
And Scripture unto us expounds,
True learned Discipline confounds.
It Is time for us to cry and call
Good Lord have mercy on us all.
When people are distracted so,
Distressed England filled with woe:
When people for the common good,
Unnatural shed each others blood,
It Is time for us to cry and call
Good Lord have mercy on us all.
When dire destruction runs before,
And brings bad tidings to our door:
When arm, arm, arm, is all the cry,
To add grief to our misery.
It Is time for us to cry and call
Good Lord have mercy on us all.
When armed men each day we meet
In every lane and every street:
When as our streets are chained straight,
And Ordnance placed at every gate.
It Is time for us to cry and call
Good Lord have mercy on us all.
When London is entrenched round,
When fear our senses does confound;
When men with grief behold those works,
As if we were besieged by Turks.
It Is time for us to cry and call
Good Lord have mercy on us all.
Now since we are distressed thus,
Good Lord make haste to succor us;
On woeful England cast thine eye,
And ease us of this misery.
For now it is time to cry and call
Good Lord have mercy on us all.
When King and Peers agree in one,
And cause a blessed union;
When all embrace, and throw down arms,
And we be freed from public harms.
Then shall we find when we do call
That thou do hear and help us all.
When they shall fall that do oppose
Thee in thy way, O Lord, and those
That wish well to thy Church increase,
Then shall betide a happy peace.
Then shall we find when we do call
That thou do hear and help us all.
Humphrey Crouch.
