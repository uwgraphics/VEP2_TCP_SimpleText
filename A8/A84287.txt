THE EXERCITATION ANSWERED, In the Assertions Following made good against it.

1 That the usurpation pretended by the Exercitator is really no usurpation, by
any thing that he has said to prove it such. 2 That former Oaths in
controversy oblige not against obedience to present Powers. 3 That obedience
is due to Powers in possession, though unlawfully entered.
Duobus modis aliquis est Tyrannus; uno, quia licet sit vere Dominus
Reipublicae, injuste eam administrat. Nesas est privatis isium interficere; at
pro sui defensione licet; and Respublica quoad capita convenire potest, and
deponere and depositum punire.

Tyrannum secundo modo, quivis de Republica potest licite interficere nisi ex
ea interfectione major a mala Reipublicae imminerent; nam tune contra
Reipublicae charitatem peccaret illum interficiendo.

THE EXERCITATION answered, in the ASSERTIONS following, made good against it.
CHAP. I. A taste of the Exercitator and Exercitation.
Public obedience to Powers ordained by God, next to immediate obedience to
God himself ordaining those Powers, is a Duty that should have the first place
in the heart, as it has in the second Table of the Law, which the New Covenant
writes in the heart. And therefore he that shall break this Commandment of
obedience (not one of the least but greatest Commandments) and shall teach men
so, had need of a light within him to warrant both himself and his Doctrine, as
clear as the Meridian Sun; least while he thinks to resist the usurpations of
men, he indeed resist the Ordinance of God.

They that favor the Doctrine of disobedience to the present Powers, commend
to us as the most clear and able if not irrefragable Discourse upon that
Subject, a Book entitled, An Exercitation etc.

The Author we must profess we know not, nor any thing of his personal
ability or integrity, but certainly if in other matters he have had the repute
of one defective in neither, we are sorry we are enforced to say that in this of
the Exercitation, He has showed a miserable want of both. To make this
apparent, we shall not need to tire the Reader or our selves, to follow him in
his wild extravagancies, by a particular enumeration of his tedious
impertinencies and manifest contradictions: It will suffice (before we come by
an examination of his foundation and groundworke, to shake the main Pillars of
his Philistine-Fabrick) that we premise a taste, and but a taste (for ex pede
Herculem) of the strength and candor of this so much admired Piece.

The Title page runs, An Exercitation, so we may justly expect an accurate
Tract; yet page 75. the Exercitator tells us, he has not by him diverse of the
Books cited by the Author whom he there undertakes to answer. Has he not? it
may be they are hard to be got; or it may be they are not worth the getting,
who are they? let the Reader judge, Bucer, Peter Martyr, Calvin, Gualter etc.
these are the Authors that our learned Exercitator says he has not by him;
and have we not here a proper Exercitator, that thus like a fresh water
Soldier enters the Lists without his Arms? But what want of Arms, where there
is no want of confidence? for he proceeds magisterially to tell the Reader (and
he must believe him gratis, without the least syllable of reason for it) that
the Authors sayings set down by his Antagonist reach not the case at all. And
comes he not learnedly off? The Reader need not scruple to believe him that he
answers without book. Such an answer were fitter for Solomon's sluggard, Prove.
26.16. then an Exercitator. For surely Replies of this nature need no great
Exercitation, and are like to afford as little satisfaction, unless it be to
such as are so kind hearted to him, that they have before hand resolved to
believe him (or indeed any of his Bias) out of pure charity. But you will say,
it may be, as he alleadges they were, so they were indeed, impertinently
quoted; and what need he trouble himself with them, so long as they speak
nothing to the purpose? How much to the purpose they speak, let the Reader
judge, when he shall first have heard the Position to be proved, and afterward
one or two in stead of all the rest, speaking to it in his Antagonists
Quotation. The Author of the lawfulness of obeying the present Government
(with whom our Exercitator in the place in question has to deal) asserts that
a Government unlawfully erected, may yet lawfully be obeyed; and the foundation
upon which he builds his judgment in the Position, is Romans 13. For he argues
that the Apostle writing to the Christians of that age, gives them command to
be subject to the Powers that then were, because even those Powers were of God,
though (as our Author conceives) they were usurped Powers, being either
Claudius Caesar or Nero, both Roman Emperors; from whence he concludes that
unlawful Powers in point of Title, may lawfully be obeyed; and for proof by
way of testimony of the godly reformed Divines concurring in judgment with
himself, cites Peter Martyr, page 8. in these words: It shall not here be
scrupulously disputed, Nihil hic anxie disputandum est, quo jure quave injuria,
principes adeptisint potestatem suam. Illud potius agendum est, ut Magistratus
praesentes revereamur. Haec enrm Epistola scribebatur, cum Romant jam adepti
essent imperium orbis terrarum, quod eos per vim scimus occupasse, and postea
Imperatores artibus nihilo melioribus rerum summam ad se pertraxisse. Paulus
tamen sine omni exceptione praecipit, obediendum esse Magistratilus. Per.
Martyr in Romans 13.
by what right or by what wrong Princes have gotten their Power; this rather is
to be done, that we reverence the PRESENT Magistrates; for this Epistle was
written when the Romans had now gotten the Empire of the world, which we KNOW
they did possess by FORCE; and that afterward, the Emperors by Policies,
nothing better, drew to themselves an universal Power; yet Paul does command
that Magistrates, without all exception, must be obeyed. And now let the Reader
judge, whither it be not so far from being nothing, that indeed nothing can be
more to the purpose; for who sees not that he asserts the self same thing, and
upon the same ground with our Author, without a hairs difference save in
expression? And with him do all the rest agree; but Bucer is more full and
peremptory upon the point, Quum igitur quaeritur cui paerendum, non est
spectandum qualis sit qui potestatem exercer, nec quo jure vel injuria quis
potestatem invaserit, quave ratione eam administret, sed tantum si potestatem
haheat; si enim quis potestate pollet, jam indubitatum est illum a Deo illam
potestatem accepisse, unde sine omni exceptione, illi te permittas oportet, and
pareas ex animo.
expressing himself in these terms: When a question is made whom we should
obey, it must not be looked at what he is that exercises the power, or by what
right or wrong he has invaded the power, or in what manner he does dispense
it, but only if be have a power. For if any man does excel in power, it is
now out of doubt that he received that power of God. Wherefore without all
exception, thou must yield thy self up to him, and heartily obey him.

It Is therefore plain that the reason why the Exercitator makes such a sorry
shift to rid his hands of those approved Divines, was not because they speak
too little, but rather too much to the purpose; for being resolved, right or
wrong, to maintain his own conceit, he knew not how to decline the Authority of
opposites so learned and judicious, and which no judicious man but himself
would have slighted, save by thus turning them out at the back door.

But again, though this Exercitator had wanted Books, (for he says he had not
the Authors by him) he should not have wanted reason for overthrowing the
Reasons that were alleged to maintain the Position of Obedience which
himself did oppose. The Reasons of the Casuists, and particularly that of
Salon, were at large expressed, so that he needed not to be at charge for
Books to find them, being there found to his hands. But indeed if many
Exercitators were in this one, they cannot stand under the weight of those
Reasons; and therefore he did wisely not to take these Gates of Azzah on his
shoulders, being no Sampson, least he should sink under the weight of them.
But in the mean time, till they be soundly answered, the Position of obedience
stands strong and unshaken, and his Discourse does fall (with Dagon) before it.

And yet our Exercitator superciliously says (and he thinks it enough, though
never so apparently untrue, to say) it reaches not the Case at all. But to
return to our Exercitation.

We are told in the Title Page, that the Discourse is modestly and
inoffensively managed, (men's consciences tell them what they should do, and
their works tell us what they have done) by one studious of truth and peace. If
he be so good a student, it is strange he should be so bad a proficient. For if
we may make a better judgment of him by his works then his words, we doubt not
but the Reader will find him a very truant in the study of truth, at least in
the present controversy, when it shall be brought to the Touchstone. And for
the peaceable and inoffensive modesty whereof he would bespeak himself an
opinion, let but the heart and design of the Exercitation be compared with the
Quotations out of Fenner and Grotius confronting his so candid profession, and
they will speak him far from the pretended temper of peace and an inoffensive
modesty. The Exercitation endeavors (though in truth by arguments no less
false then frivolous, and as injurious as either) to fix Usurpation upon the
Parliament; and thereupon decries all obedience to them, and cries up
disobedience as meritorious in the hearts and affections of the people: the
Quotations to add more light and heat to the business, must insinuate, That
any private person may lawfully kill an usurper. Though in truth he puts a
dangerous wrong upon the Reader, and indeed upon the Authors quoted, whilst he
racks their Tenet to so evil an end, and brings forth their words upon the
stage by halves, without those Cautions and Qualifications usually annexed, and
requisite to so tender a point, whereof we have here given a taste.

One well skilled in Cases of Conscience says: Id curare debet occisor ita
caute and consulto facere, ut non pejores exitus and scandula ex tali occisione
sperentur. Sayr. Cas. Cons. lib. 7. cap. 10. n. 4.
He that shall kill a Tyrant, must have a care that he do it with such caution
and wisdom, as the killing it self give not cause to sear that worse
consequences and scandals may follow thereupon.

And another of no mean esteem for learning, Tyrannus Titulo, ut appellatur, ad
tempus est tolerandus; omnibus autem mediis and remediis frustra tentaris est
tollendus; sed non nisi ab ordinibus five Optimatibus. Alst. Reg. Theol. cap.
23. Artic. 8.
and cited by the Exercitator himself, says: That a Tyrant in Title, as we
call it, is to be tolerated for a time; but after all means and remedies tried
in vain, is to be taken away; yet by no others then the States or chief Rulers.

And to see the fidelity of this Exercitator; even to that very sentence which
himself out of the same Author has cited page 74. De hoc etc. liceat illunn e
medio tollere, st quidem hoc faciat Autoritate publica. Idem. Syst. Pol. sec.
cap. 12. Reg. 4.
De hoc etc. there is annexed this qualification by him most in juriously
omitted, That a private person in taking away a Tyrant, may not act but with
public Authority.

Neither has he dealt altogether faithfully with Fenner, Dudl. Fenner Sacr.
Theol c. 13 De polit. Civit. p. 80.
as he that peruses him will find in the place cited, whither for brevities
sake I refer him.

But of all the rest he has most palpably abused Grotius. For after diverse
qualifications and cautions both prefixed and affixt by him, but omitted by the
Exercitator, yea and some in the very sentence quoted, Maxim autem in re
controversa judictum sibi privatus sumere non debet, sed POSSESSIONEM sequi.
Sic tributum solvi Caesari Chrtstus jubebat, quia ejus imaginem nummus
praeferebat, id est, quia in possessione erat imperii. Grotius, De jure pacis
ac belli, lib. 1. c. 4.. 20.
Grotius thus concludes upon the whole matter: But most certain it is, that in
a controverted case no private person may presume to make himself a Judge, but
must give way to POSSESSION. Thus Christ commanded that Tribute should be paid
to Caesar, because the money bore his Image, that is, because he was in
possession of the Empire.

And what can the meaning of the Exercitation in all this be (charity it self
being judge) but on the one side to blow the Trumpet to open Rebel^ion against
the Authority of Parliament in general? and on the other side to strengthen
the hands of private assassines against the lives of the Members in particular?
And is not this modestly and inoffensively managed? are not these the designs
of one studious of peace? It Is strange the Exercitation it self should not
blush, to pretend to a peaceable and inoffensive modesty, whilst it exposes the
blood of the Powers against whom it disputes, to the lust of every bloody
miscreant. And yet the Exercitators conscience could not but tell him, that
many if not most of the Commons now sitting, possess their seats within those
walls by virtue of an Election unquestionably, legal, and by the sanction of a
Law to perpetuate them (till themselves shall consent to their own dissolution)
as unquestionable. And therefore he might have considered (for being an
Exercitator, sure he could not be ignorant) that according to that generally
known, and as genarally received Maxim, In re dubia tutior est conditio
possidentis; which might have taught him to forbear such unchristian
insinuations in an affair of so solemn and sovereign concernment, both in
religious and civil respects.

But we shall now come to particulars, and first to that of the pretended
usurpation, and we shall absolve it in the ensuing Chapter.

CHAP. II. That the Usurpation pretended is really no Usurpation.
THat the Commons of England assembled in Parliament should be charged with
Usurpation by any single person without doors, doubtless in all reason cannot
but seem very irregular; and therefore it might well have become the
Exercitator (whoever he be) by that Analogy of our Saviors words, of which he
speaks, page 3. modestly to have asked himself before he began this work, Who
made him a Judge or a Rule-maker over the Commons in Parliament? But it is
easier sometimes to see a mote abroad then a beam at home. All that he says to
the point of Usurpation (and questionless his zeal makes him omit nothing that
he can say) is comprehended in the first Chapter, containing both the Charge
and the grounds thereof, in the ensuing description of Usurpation.

Vfurpation (he says) is an intrusion into the seat of Authority, a presuming
to possess and manage the place and power thereof, without a lawful calling,
right, or title thereunto.

In the prosecution of this description he tells us (though with much ado about
nothing) that by Authority he means that which is supreme, and by a lawful
calling, a calling from the People; and this he says is so essential to a
humanely constituted Magistracy, that where it is, it makes a lawful
Magistracy; and the privation or want thereof makes Usurpation. Again it is
confessed by himself, page 5. that by the fundamental Government of this Nation,
the Commons in Parliament have a lawful Title to supremacy of power jointly by
way of coordination with the other coordinates there mentioned; and by
consequence it cannot be denied, that they have also a lawful Title to
supremacy of power severally by way of supply without them. Fuller Ans. to D.
Fern. page 1. Ibid. page 6.
For in this particular, the learned Author of the fuller answer to D. Fern,
will tell him that coardinata invicem supplent, coordinates supply each other.
And he gives this reason afterward, Because in a coordinate and mixed
Government, one parts refusal exempts not the other from its duty, nor must it
defraud the whole of its safety; so it should frustrate the very end of that
its coordination, which is, supply for the more security of its safety. And he
adds further in the same place, That in case of the absence and refusal of the
other parts in coordination the supreme power of the whole is virtually in the
part supplying. Neither is it material if it be objected; that he speaks of
both Houses in the place last mentioned, for the reason in point of safety is
the same whether both or but one supply, as was clear in the Votes against
Hamiltons Army.

From all which grounds thus apparently deduc't from our Exercitators own
Doctrine, it is evident that the man is contradictory to himself, whilst he
endeavors to bring the Commons in Parliament within the compass of
Usurpation, as exercising the Supreme Power without a lawful calling; whereas
himself has plainly confessed that by way of coordination jointly, and therefore
severally also by way of supply, they have a lawful calling to the exercise of
the Supreme Power. What Is objected to evade this palpable contradiction? It Is
alleged, That the Commons now sitting are not a House, and that is the only
subterfuge, the old and thredbare shift of the late Kings Party, of which if we
can but uncase him, we shall allow him (besides the whole crowd of his other
impertinencies) the Apex, Zenith, and Culmen of his highflown Rhetoric, with
all the Poetica licentia of his tragical American scene; for we must
acknowledge he were an Exercitator that deserved richly to be whipped, if he
could not with some little handsomnesse at least, so tell his own tale, as to
make it serve his own turn.

First therefore if they be no house, we would willingly know how they came to
be none. We well know that once they were a House, and we know as well how they
came to be a House; in a word, by a lawful calling from the People (to use his
own expression) to constitute them, and the sanction of a Law to continue them
a House, till their own consent should dissolve them; which till themselves
shall have declared to be past, we cannot easily believe any other that shall
tell us of their dissolution. Yea but they are no House, for he says they are
under a force, and he proves it out of all cry, because they are willing and
consenting to that force. Now in truth they deserve to be pitti'd. What to be
constrained to act against their wills with all their hearts! (...). Arist.
Ethic. lib. 3. cap. 1.
I dare say it is such a force as never men were under before them. He talks of
an usu-pation, but I am sure here is a contradiction to the life. But besides
the contradiction, how knows he they were consenting? did they ever tell him
so? I am sure they have told the world the contrary, as appears by their
Message to the General and Council of War. It will be said, that was but a
mere formality; and, if they did not consent to the force, why did they not
prosecute the Authors of it? I answer, By denying the consequence; neither can
the Exercitator, were he as able as his admirers do or possibly can imagine
him, ever prove, That to forbear the prosecution ad summum jus of the Authors,
is to consent to the evil of an act. For instance, If a man remit a wilful
trespass, that will bear action in Law to his Neighbor, does he consent to
the evil of that act? or to come a little nearer both to the Exercitator and
the present case: When the Apprentices made a force upon the House, it was
afterward moved in the House, whereof Mr. Pelham sat Speaker, That the Authors
of that force might be prosecuted, and carried in the negative, will the
Exercitator say that the House then sitting was therefore consenting to the
force, and consequently was not a House? I am confident he loves them too well
to think so. Yet, Aut haec cum illis sunt habenda, aut illa cum his amittenda
sunt, either he must grant that the House then sitting was consenting to the
force then, and therefore was not a House, or deny that the House now sitting
is consenting to the force which is urged, and so conclude that they are still
a House, notwithstanding the non-prosecution of the Authors of that force. But
to help both him and his friends out of this difficulty, who may not perceive
that will, that it is one thing to pass by, and another thing to consent to a
miscarriage; the latter may not be done upon any consideration whatsoever; the
former not only may, but must be done upon many, when the Reason of the State
(which our Author says, Fuller Ans. page 25.
the Law makes to residein both Houses jointly by way of coordination, and
severally by way of supply) shall think it fit. And in this final resolution
of the States judgment the people (he says) are to rest. Ibid. page 1.
But to give an unquestionable warrant to this distinction and the practice of
the House of Commons upon it, Mica 7.18.
it is said of God himself, that he passes by the transgressions of the remnant
of his people, and yet it were blasphemy to say that he is in the least
consenting to them; The Reader is desired (...) notice that the misca iage here
pretended is only supposd not granted.
and can there be a better president to warrant the Commons passing by a
miscarriage (without out being guilty of consenting to it) rather then by
calling for a strict account to sacrifice the peace and safety of the
Commonwealth upon the service of those Privileges, which no man that has his
reason and a freedom to use it can deny to be intended in their own nature and
by their first institution to be fences and ornaments for the good of the
Commonwealth, not firebrands of contention for its ruin? Privileges are
servants to the good of the public, not Lords over it, and therefore are to be
respected in order to the public good, and in order to the public good are to
be neglected, according as the Commons in Parliament (whose they are, either to
use or not use, and who in such cases as concern their own privileges, are
the only competent Judges) shall determine. Yea but for all this, As they have
with common approbation laid them aside in giving way that Members shall be
subject to the suits of Creditors.
he says that the House must be free for all to come to, that their acts may
be free and authoritative. If he mean a freedom in respect of any Vote past
within doors, to exclude such as shall not conform to the Orders of the House,
nothing can be more apparently untrue; for the House, as it is well known, past
several Votes to exclude those that would not engage in the Vow and Covenant
concerning the Lord General Essex; and upon the Votes for the taking of the
Selemn League and Covenant, diverse that before had sat in the House, were
actually excluded for refusal. Yet I never heard of any, no not of the persons
excluded, that thereupon denied the being and Authority of the House. It is
therefore unquestionable, that the Commons in Parliament have a power to
exclude such of their Members as shall not conform to the Votes and Orders of
that House, and yet neither themselves be ever the less free, nor their acts
any whit the less authoritative. But secondly, if he mean that all the Members
must be free in respect of any restraint, save what is put upon them by the
Votes and Authority of the House; it is absolutely answered so, they are; and let
the Exercitator or any of his judgment prove the contrary if they can. Again,
let it be granted that diverse of the Members were sometimes under a force, can
that hinder those from sitting and being a House, who never were either under
or consenting to that force? If it could, it is desired the Exercitator would
show how the Commons were a House, and their Acts authoritative, when the late
King had diverse of their Members in prison in his Quarters; for by his Doctrine
if one Member be under a force, it nulls the Authority of the House. But who,
unless he wilfully shut his eyes, canuot see the mountainous grossness of
these absurdities? Wherefore to conclude this particular, Fuller Ans. page 7.
our Author in this case will tell him, That an injury cannot take away a
right; which though in truth it never can, yet according to our Exercitators
principles it must, if a force upon some of the Members could hinder the rest
from being a House. Lastly, it is objected by the Exercitator, That the Commons
now sitting are not the major part. And it is answered, What is that to the
purpose, so long as they are a House? what if the major part of the Commons had
deserted their trust, and gone to the late King, should that have hindered
those that had staid behind and continued faithful to their trust, from being
a House? The contrary is apparent in the Lords, who while they sat, were never
looked on as being ever the less a House because the greater part deserted
them, and were afterward justly excluded the House by the far lesser number of
Lords sitting.

To conclude, the Exercitator acknowledges page 7. that if it could be made
good, that the whole Nation had in the original constitution of Government
committed the sole power to the House of Commons, there could be no Usurpation.
Now it is as apparent as the light by his own grounds, that the whole Nation
(for the Lords if they fall not under a National, must fall under a personal
consideration) has committed the Supreme power to the House of Commons
jointly, by way of coordination, and solely by way of supply; and therefore by
his own confession, they can never be concluded under usurpation, as exercising
that power without a lawful calling, for the exercise whereof they have by his
own grounds a lawful calling from the People.

CHAP. III. That the Oaths objected oblige not against obedience to the
present Government.
THe Assertion that we are now to make good against the Exercitator, is, That
the Oaths by him objected obliges not against obedience to the present Powers.
To demonstrate this truth with as much brevity as perspicuity, we shall first
lay down certain generally received principles, by which as by so many rules,
we may evidently discern in what cases, ex confesso, Oaths do not oblige.
Secondly, we shall examine and answer our Exercitators objections, why those
Rules should not take place in the Oaths in controversy. And a main reason
inducing to the choice of this method, is, because truth and experience jointly
tells us, that of commenting on words and sentences in controverted Oaths there
can never be an end. For the fancy of man being of so various a working, and
working a variety, hardly can that word or sentence be propounded, which it
will not scrve and wier-draw to its own sense, if it have not some clear and
constant principles of truth, as a bright but unerring star, both to guide and
fix it.

In the first place therefore it is generally granted, as a Principle of truth
that cannot be denied, Dr. Sanders, Pral. 2.. 11. Juramentum non tollit
obligationem prierem.
That no Oath can so oblige, as to take away the obligation of a former duty.
The force by which all Oaths are said to bind, is constructive only, never
destructive; they may impose a Duty where they find none, or dispose of
certain circumstances about the performance, but they cannot destroy or take
away a duty where they find it.

As much with as much clearness may be said concerning the Oaths in
controversle, and objected to obstruct our obedience to the present Government.
It Is most true, they had a constructive force to oblige according to their
several limitations, to the former Government whilst it did obtain; but as
true it is, they never had, nor ever can have a destructive force to oblige to
disobedience, and disoblige from obedience to all other Governments in the
future actually obtaining. For it is evident, that by such a destructive force
they should (which it is confessed they cannot) take away the obligation of: a
former duty, seeing we are first bound to obey all Government in gener all as
the Ordinance of Ged, and so by a Divine right; before we are bound to obey any
form of Government in particular, which is but the Ordinance of man, and so
only by a humane right. It Is observable, that the reason given why no Oath can
take away the obligation of a former duty, is, because an inferior act of the
person in duty obliged, cannot take away the superior right of the person to
whom the obligation is due. How much less then can an inferior act of the
Creature obliging himself by the Oaths in controversy, take away not the
Superior but Supreme Right of the Creator, by virtue of which he stood obliged
to God in duty to give obedience to all Government in general, before he
obliged himself to man to give obedience to the then obtaining form of
Government in particular? Yet this Supreme Right of God, and the obligation of
duty in point of obedience to all Government in general by virtue of that
Right, must actually be taken away, if upon the removal of the former
Government and substitution of another in its stead, and both by that Divine
hand which may and does at pleasure dispose of all Governments, the Oaths
objected oblige against Obedience, and enforce a non-subjection to the hand of
God in the preceding change, and the Ordinance of God in the present
Government. For whilst they still oblige to be subject to the Government that
was but is not, and not to be subject to the Government that is, they indeed
oblige to be subject to no Government, and consequently to Anarchy and
confusion. But such an Obligation must needs be Null, because as is evident
from all that has been said, unlawful and wicked.

What Is objected here by our Exercitator? he tells us page 46. All Authority
hangs not upon the back of Usurpation, so he terms the present Government,
and says this [the present Government] may come down, and that [the former)
recover it self and stand upright. To which we answer. First, It has already
been showed that if he have not contradicted the truth in his description of
Usurpation, p. 1. he has contradicted both himself and the Truth, in the
Application of it to the present Powers. To which we shall only add, that
among coordinate states and compeeres such as he has confessed, page 5. the
present to have been, there can be no advantage of right in point of Title,
save what arises from the advantage of a better cause, the one side faithfully
endeavoring according to trust, the safety, and prosperity of the
Commonwealth; the other faithlesly betraying trust and endeavoring its ruin
and destruction; in which case the Common Tenet is, that the just party has
sufficient Title enough to save the Commonwealth, but the unjust none to
destroy it, and therefore may justly be deposed and punished by the other
coordinate in supremacy of Power. And certainly if in giving a Right judgment
of the Merits of the present Cause, the interest of the reformed Religion and
the public liberties of the Nation must (as what else must) by honest men be
regarded, it cannot in reason be doubted, but al such will unanimously conclude,
if the hour of temptation be not upon them, that the present powers have so
far the advantage of a better Cause, as the Cause of Christ is better then
Antichrists, and the cause of Common liberty better then that of Tyranny.
Neither is it probable that they will ever find Cause to reienquish their
judgments in this particular, until our Exeroitator by a second and more
sound Exercitation shall upon infallible evidence substantially and to
satisfaction demonstrate, that the bloody and idolatrous Irish, are the best
and most cordial instruments to carry on the work of Reformation, and the
interest of the true reformed Religion; that prerogative Court-parasites are
the truest Patriots and properest champions of the public liberty of the
Nation; and in a word that Hamiltons Army howeverdisclaim'd by the Kirk, and
all the truly religious of Scotland, invaded this Nation out of pure Zeal to
the ends of the Covenant, and the interest of all truly religious Covenanters,

Atque idem iungat vulpes and mulgeat Hircos. But secondly, to do our
Exercitator a courtesy let it be supposed (because he will needs have it so)
that the pretended usurpation is real; what then? will he then maintain his
ground any better, when he shall lie at his own guard and have the advantage to
choose his own weapon? Let the Reader judge, Usurpation (he says) may shortly
fall. It may? yes, and it may not; it may not fall shortly, not a long time,
many years, ages, never; what then? certainly then either all authority must
hang on the back of that which he is pleased to call V surpation, or else it
must all fall to the ground. For by the [may be] of our Exercitators Doctrine,
there not only is no authority in England at present, but neither himself nor
any man else knows, whither ever there will be any to the worlds end. And what
is this but by one dash of a ridiculous [may be] to subvert the Ordinance of
God in Government and the Order of Mankind in obedience to it? The fuller
Answer, Fuller Ans. page 3.
will teach him a better lessen, who according to the truth tells us, that
there be in all societyes of men (and theresore in the present amongst us) a
government capable of its end, safety, is out of question Gods institution and
moral. Nay indeed he might have taught himself a better lesson; for whilst
he defines Usurpation, a presuming to possess the seat, and manage the power
of the supreme Authority, he acknowledges even under Usurpation a seat fixed,
and an actual Exercise of the supreme Authority, by the fixure of which Seat
we see the Nation at present established in Order, and by the influence of which
Authority, public justice is fully administered, both which being the
ordinance of God, can no more be taken away by any act or oath of man, then it
could at first have been instituted by any other then a divine wisdom, or
could since have been constantly maintained, otherwise, then by the powerful,
though secret influence of a Divine and Almighty hand.

And therefore we doubt not but to make it evident as the Day, that however the
Exercitator presume to make himself an accuser of others for presuming to the
seat of Authority, there cannot easily be found a more presumptuous Usurpation,
then that whereof he stands guilty, and obnoxious both to God and man. For
whereas he charges most untruly, and therefore most ungratefully, those to whom
he owes his protection, with presuming to the seat of Authority, himself, which
is infinetely worse, presumes to overthrow the very seat of Authority, and
fling the Authority it self wholly out of the Nation, so at once endeavoring
to make void the supreme Ordinance of God, for the Civil welfaire of
mankind, and leave the Nation withont all Order or Government to be swallowed
up of Anarchy and confusion, and in this most miserable estate must the Nation
by his irreligious [may be] continue even to the worlds end, unless the
public enemy for whom he pleades, and upon whose back he makes all authority
to hang, shall be pleased to give leave that Gods Ordinance of Government may
again take place among us.

For the second, to answer him out of his own definition of Usurpation: First,
we must distinguish between the Act of Intrusion, and the Person that makes the
Intrusion; Its granted that the Act of Intrusion is not the Ordinance of God;
but the Person of the intruder considered per se, and in actual possession of
the supreme power, not only may be, but certainly is the Ordinance of God;
whilst by God he is put into a capacity of being a Minister (and accordingly
acts) for the good of those over whom the hand of God has exalted him in place
of higher power; although it be but for a time, and only by way of permission
otherwise there must necessarily be a breach in that Golden Chain of Order and
Government which God has ordained, to bind up mankind, from inevitably, and
by our Exercitators [may be] irrecoverably falling into Anarchy and confusion
upon every concussion of State, and the frequent Revolutions of Governors and
Governments, of which our own Nation has not had the least experience. And
upon those grounds we even now mentioned, it is, that even they that allow a
removal of a Person in power without a Title, allow it only in an orderly
way, and in clear and untroverted cases, and unquestionably conducing to the
good of the Commonwealth. Again we must distinguish between the Act of
Intrusion, and the Authority or Supreme power; the former as was granted,
before, is not, but the latter ever is the Ordinance of God. For the Seat of
authority being from the beginning, fixed by the hand of the most High; the
authority or supreme Power annexed to, and issuing out of that Seat, can never
cease to be the Ordinance of God, by what hand soever he is pleased to dispense
it, who may, and does dispense it by what hand he pleases; and therefore it may
not be resisted in the hand of any whom himself has put in possession, though
by means extraordinary to us, without sin, and incurring the danger of
receiving the damnation threatened by the Apostle, Romans 13.2. Neither can the
Obligation of any Oath whatsoever, either invalidate a Duty, or enforce a sin
in this particular.

But to come to a second principle, It Is a rule beyond all exception, Indubijs
sequendum est partem tutiorem D. Sands. Prael. 2. 9.
that indoubtfull cases the safer part is to be chosen. The doubt of which we
are now speaking, may be either concerning the Explication, or the Obligation
of an Oath; and that part is in all doubts out of all controversy the safer,
which has nothing of Sin, and most of Duty in it. The present doubt concerning
the Oaths controverted, respects their Obligation, whether such as may justly
hinder obedience to the present Government; and it has been asserted against
the Exercitator, that the safer part as including nothing of Sin, and most of
Duty, is the Negative; that the Oaths objected, neither do nor can bind
against obedience to the present Government. The reason is, because its a sin
against the fifth Commandment implicitly, and expressly against Romans 13.1. to
be under no Government; its consequently a necessary Duty to be under some, and
no sin to be under any, because all Government is the Ordinance of God, Romans
13.1. If therefore the Oaths in controversy should oblige against obedience
to the present Government, they should bind from a necessary Duty, to a
manifest Sin; but nothing can oblige unto Sin, and therefore no Oath
whatsoever.

2ly. If it be true that in doubtful cases the safer part is to be chosen, it is
as true that in all such cases, In re dubia turior est pars possidentis.
the party in possession is the safter part. But that which in the present
Contorversie, puts the doubt out of all doubt, is that the party in possession
have ever had at least an equal Title, as coordinates ( ex confesso) with
their Competitors. And therefore at present have a superior, or rather indeed
the only Title, in regard of the justness of their own, and the unjustness of
the adverse parties cause, unless (as was said before) a confederacy with the
bloody Irish, and Hamiltons invasive Army must be justin'd as the juster cause,
and withal, as the safer part.

What evasion has our Exercitator here to extricate himself out of this
difficulty? His old Tenedian axe still. (...) Vid Erasin. Chiliad.
First, the pretended Usurpation, and then that Usurpation is not the Ordinance
of God. For the first we have answered it once and again in the preceding part
of this discourse; neither shall we write after his Copy, in his frequent and
tiresome Tautologies; it were too great an affliction to the Reader to vex
him, usque ad nauseam, with his Crambe his millies ^^cta.

But the full prosecution of this will be proper in the third assertion.

We come now to a third principle, In juramento semper jus superioris
intelligitur exceptum. 2 Decret. 24 19
and it speaks as the rest ex confesso, (for we intend such only) thus. In
all Oaths whatsoever the superiors right over the inferior, is ever
understood to stand excepted, as that which can never fall under their
Obligation. Or (it may be) more plainly thus, No Oath of an inferior, can
bind against that Right of a Superior, by which he has a lawful Power over
him.

There are two Superiors, or rather indeed Suprems, that have a lawful power
over all men, by virtue of a Supreme Right, against which no Oath can oblige;
in a word, God and the Commonwealth. This Right of God to begin with it in the
first place, is not only supreme, but absolute, and therewithal universal,
and extends over all men, in all things, by virtue whereof he claims a lawful
power, Job. 33.13.
at pleasure to dispose of all, rendering no man an account of his ways; but
certainly of all that he claims a power to dispose, there is nothing wherein
he is more peremptory, there is nothing which with a more high hand under the
name of the Most high, he asserts unto himself with a more sovereign majesty
and absolute soverainty, then the swaying stroke in the Kingdom of Men, Dan.
4.17. (...) Hwnillimum hominem. Hier.
and an undoubted right to give it to whomsoever he will, and set up over it
the humblest of men. When therefore the most High actually puts down one, and
sets up another Power, and so by virtue of his supreme absolute, and
universal Right gives the Kingdom to whomsoever, HE, not WE will, (for such
a contra-distinction the solmne inforcement of the words, must of necessity
infer in the eye of any impartial judge;) who can plead a Right against God?
or what Oath stand valid to invalidate his Right? Especially seeing all
inferior Rights cease and determine (at least pro tempore) upon the actual
entrance, and interposition of the Superior; how much more shall the inferior
right of man be no right, when not a Superior only, which yet it self might
be subordinate and doubtful, but the supreme absolute and undoubted right of
God, by an actual and powerful interposition takes place? It Is said, Si
filius familias jurel se facturum aliquid in selicitum; pater autem rei
that in case a Son being under his Fathers power, shall oblige himself by
an Oath, to an Act in it self lawful; and the Father being ignorant of the
thing, ignorus aliud ei faciendum imperet, quod impediat id fieri quod juratum
est, filius non tenetur juramento: quia lege divina naturali tenerur parere
imperio patris D. Sands Pral. 2. 10.
command somewhat else to be done, that hinders the accomplishment of what was
sworn; the Oath of the Son is not obliging; because by the law of God and
Nature, he is bound to obey his Father. How much more then are the Sons of
men obliged to obey the God both of that Law and Nature, the everlasting
Father, by subjection to the powers that are, because they are Ordained of him:
and how much less can any Oath bind against Obedience to him by such
subjection? Seeing all Oaths at their first taking, are to take in the tacit
condition of a salva potestate juperioris, an exemption of the Superiors
Right, much more of the Right of the most high, by a si deus permiserit, if God
say a men to the Oath taken.

What says our Exercitator to all this? God gives no power to Usurpers he
says; but surely it is safer to say with truth it self, Joh. 18.11. They could
have no power unless he gave it them. And it is certain that our Savior there
speaks of a juriciall Power, and to a Person that was an Usurper, if ever yet
there were any. For our Savior himself (if we will receive the truth out of
Godly and judicious Mr. Perkins mouth) was the true heir, Mr. Perkins Expos.
on the Epistle of Jude.
and had the only title of Right to the Crown and Kingdom of the Jews.
Besides, he must either contradict himself, and there-withall confess the
truth, or the Scripture in express terms, and therein given his own opinion the
fall, whilst he denies that God gives the Kingdom to Usurpers, whose it is to
give to whomsoever he will. For he nndertakes to prove Jereboam an Usurper,
page 1. and yet he is not ashamed there to quote 1 King. 11. where at verse 31.
The Lord the God of Israel says, Behold I will rend the Kingdom out of theh and
of Solomon, and GIVe ten Tribes unto thee. But our Exercitator not without
manifest wrong to the express Text says; yea suppose it a grant, As if when
God had in terms said to Jeroboam, I will give; there were not sufficient
ground from the stability of every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God,
absolutely to conclude a full Grant. But we shall not here anticipate that
which we intend hereafter more fully to discuss for the further confirmation
of this particular, when we shall come to the third assertion, whither for the
present we must still refer the Reader. Only for a conclusion, take the late
judgment of our own Divines, with learned Mr. Diodati's concurrent in answer
to the present Objection, in these words on Romans 13.

Ordained of God, that is instituted of God among mankind, to Rule and
Govern men in Order as in Gods stead. For God is the Author of this Order in
the world: and all those which attain unto this equity or excellency, do
attain unto it either by his manifest will and approbation, when the means
are just and lawful, or else by his secret providence, with permission and
toleration, when the means are unlawful: and it is just and equal that man
should approve and tolerate that which God himself approves and tolerates: and
that he approves and tolerates, which we cannot by any lawful means appointed
by him decline and avoid. All therefore who resist authority, make war after a
sort with god himself. Ann. on Romans 13.1. Didati. ibid.

A Second Superior, or to speak more properly, among things of an inferior
rank under the most high, Supreme, for salus populi suprema lex, is the
Commonwealth, bonum publicum. Against the sovereign Right of this; superior,
and that lawful power which it has over us, no Oath can oblige, and
consequently not the Oaths pretended. This is no denied by the Exercitator
himself. For speaking to this Argument urged against the Obligation of the
present Oaths, by the Author of the lawfulness of obeying etc. He grants page
44. If the thing sworn shall become privative of, or opposite to the public
good, or welbeing of the Nation in its own nature and necessarily, the Oath
would be void; for to a sinful thing there can be no Obligation. But to assume
upon his own concession in the premises, most certain it is, that where Order
and good Government, public justice, and peace may be had, and surely it may
be, nay it is generally had under the present Government, witness all the
public seats of Justice in the Land, there to resist the powers administering
this Order and Government, public Justice and Peace, is as much in its own
nature, and as necessarily destructive to the public good and wel-being of the
Nation, as disorder and Anarehy is to Order, and Government, or war and
consusion to public Justice and Peace; in a word, as much in its own nature,
and as necessarily privative of, and opposite to the public good and wel-being
of the Nation, as the privation of, and opposition to the proper immediate and
necessary means is in its own nature, and necessarily privative of, and
opposite to the end it self. Whereupon it follows evidently and undeniably,
that to such a sinful resistance of the Powers administering, there can be no
Obligation; and consequently the Oaths objected in that respect are void by
our Exercitators own concession. And to evince this yet more fully (if at least
there can be a fuller eviction) from his own principles and expresions. We say
on all hands says our Exercitator) page 33. The King it for the Kingdom, as
the means is for the end; and the same in effect we have from the mouth of a
King, confessing, and therewithal confirming this truth as a Royal Law, that
the King is for the Commonwealth, and not the Commonwealth for the King;
which granted, King James.
if Oaths and Duties (do, as indeed they must) oblige to respect things
concerned, according to their own rank and dignity; and the rule hold always
true, as indeed it can never fail, that finis quo ultimatior co influxu
potentior, the highest end has the strongest influence; and to that end, (as
our Fuller Answer very fully) still all other subordinate ends stand but in the
Office of means; it is clear that as both the Oaths were for the King, and
both King and Oaths for the Commonwealth, as subordinate means for the
ultimate End; so both the one and the other oblige only as condueing, but
neither the one nor the other can oblige as destructive to the Commonwealth,
or bonum publicum; for so the nature of the means, should be to destroy the
End, which is a contradiction in nature, seeing the very essence and
intrinsecall form of the means, consists in this that they are apra nata ad
finent, naturally conducing to the End, else they are but equivocally termed
means. In sum then, we already have the means sufficient (by experience) to
the End; we have the end as the actual fruit and effect of these means; and
therefore if the Oaths objected do oblige to destroy those mean^s, and with
them, the end by them already obtained; that is, if they oblige on the one side
to subvert (and all disobedience tends to subversion) that Order and
Government, public Justice and Peace, which is at present in the Nation; and
on the other side in its stead to introduce disorder and Anarchy, War and
consusion which all disobedience naturally tends to introduce; and all this
upon pretonce to reobtain other means, if at least truly means, though such
as according to the present posture of the parties concerned, probably are
never, or if ever to be obtained, threatening to prove destructive to the end
itself: in such case (and it cannot be denied but such is the present case if
impartially stated) the Oaths objected apparently bind (if said to bind) to
that which in its own nature, and necessarily is privative of, and opposite to
the public good and welbeing of the Nation; and consequently (the Exercitator
himself being Judge) they are to be pronounced void, for to a sinful thing
there can be no Obligation. So it remains that the true intent of the Oaths
in controversy, is finally lodged in the good of the Commonwealth; neither
have they any force to the destruction thereof, but must needs be void if ever
so intended.

By this times it is hoped, we have sufficiency expedited our selves of the
impeditive, which our Exercitator says will not be granted, and demonstrated
the privative part of his distinction. We are now at leisure to hear what he
says further. That of the Gibeonites is no way pertinent to the present case,
the inconvenience of that Oath being quite of another nature, bendes they were
made servants, though there lives were span'd, which they acknowledged to be at
themercy of the Israelites, who considering their servitude, were at no great
loss by them. But that their Oath was unlawful Vrsums flatly denies nay he
positively affirms, Non ideo servatur Gibeonitis iuramen ^tum quod ad illum
obstingantur etc Vrsin. Cas. Tere. Pracept.
they were not bound to keep it. But to pass over his impertinences, and come
to his weakness; here he tells us, and we had a glance at it before, hat all
authority bangs no upon he back of Vsorpation. NO? How comes he then to define
it an intrusion into the Seat of authority, and a possessing and managing of
the place and power thereof? So it seems though they intrude into the Seat,
yet they are out of the Seat; and though they possess and manage the place and
power, yet they neither possess nor manage the place and power of Authority;
which is a mere contradiction, and so must needs be false, because no
contradiction can be true. He is so ingenuous afterward as to grant the
Doctrine of obedience, so much better then his own of disobedience, as that it
will afford a little justice, but his own non. Well but he sales we were not
taught this Doctrine of obedience, when the Parliamen began to stand up, and
waken the people to shake off expilation and oppression.

Certainly when the Parliament began, we were not taught by any, but such as
pleaded for the cause of that expiration and oppression; whereof he speaks,
that the Commons in Parliament were no House, were usurpers. And therefore it is
plain, that either this Exercitator from the beginning was one of the Common
Enemies against whom we Covenanted; or else contrary to the express Text of
the Covenant in the fixed Article; has made a defection to them, for the takes
up their weapons and fights their Battles, however he would be thought a
champion for he Covenant. Again. I cannot but wonder at the ignorance of this
silly Objection; for had the Expilation which he takes of been ten-fold more
then was, no man that either had Knowledge or Conscience of what he taught,
would have taught to have lifted up so much as a finger against the Expilator,
had we not had the impreame power of the Nation in peaceable and plenary
possession, to call us forth by Authority and Commission us into Order, and a
cause unquestionably just to justify those Commissions; nay, the War on the
Parliaments side being defensive, not offensive, the end could never be the
subversion of that Order and Government, public justice and peace which the
Nation then actually enjoyed, as our Exercitators end, though a pretender to be
studious of Peace, really is, but indeed by a defense less necessary then
just, to prevent the subversion of all these, apparently endeavored, by the
actual invasion of Delinquents of all sorts and Sizes. The Doctrine of
disobedience then is peculiar to the Exercitator, and the rest of the Park,
not as themselves say of old Puritans, but what might more probably have beeene
said, new Pharisees, by the selfe-assuming still, had they not told us
themselves, that they were a company of godly Ministers. But ^ertainely for
their new Doctrine of disobedience, it has no affinity, with that of the good
old Puritans; but is as contrary to it, as light is to darkness, as we shall
show hereafter in one of the most eminent.

He tells us with great cry, and little wool, that Righeousnesse exalts a
Nation, and the Throne is established by righeousnesse; what righteousness? a
Titular righteousness without a Real, nay with a Real unrighteousness? The
truth is a Real righteousness, may sometimes establish the Throne without a
Tituler, but certainly a Tituler without a Real, or with a Real
unrighteousness never. We may say in some sort, the coneatenations of
providence considered, After noones preaching. Book of sports. Innovations
Mass it self.
that if Saul had not reigned in unrighteousness, righteous David had never
reigned. Had not unrighteousness been propagated through the Nation, by the
public suppression, and profanation of what was holy, and authorization of
what was wicked and profane; and the almighty thereby provoked as 'twere to his
face, possibly the Exercitators Pen might have been idle, or found a better
employment.

Under Usurpation (he says, meaning the present Government in the American
tongue) we can expect no settlement. It Is granted, how can we, what need we
expect it? we have a settlement already, and Nthil appetit id quod habet.
Desire and expectation end, where fruition and enjoyment begin. Well, but
however, he says, it is certain to fall. Quod volumus facile credinues. Sure
his certainty is but from an uncertain and simplicite faith, that has its eye
blinded by that ignorance which is the mother of his devotiton to his own
cause. No, for he says commotion is sure in reasonte follow. Sure enough from
such turbulent reason as he gives us in his Exercitation; for therein he does
what he can to prove himself a Prophet, as true in his false prediction, as
false in his untrue Doctrine: but sure if the reasons for obedience be as
truly, as truth would have them followed, commotion in reason can never follow.
It Is such Doctrine as his own without Religion, however pretending to reason,
that raises the evil spirit of Commotion, which the p^^e and peaceable wised
me that is from above, would soon lay and bind up forever. But we shall follow
him no farther in these minute impertinences, but return to the last
principle, which we here intend to insist on.

The case of impossibility is so evident in it self, and obvious to the
meanest capacity, as no sooner can it be said, then assented to, that no Oath
can oblige to do that which cannot be done. To this our Exercitator page 44.
Answers, All reasonable men will grant so far as impossbility lies, and so long
as it continues, the Oath binds not; but this is not to our Authers purose, for
to cease from an Act, that is, from obedience, to the present Government, can
never be impossible.

The impossibility which the Exercitator denies, and his opposite affirms,
must concern either the Act to be performed, or the lawfulness of the
performance. If both these be proved against him, the Authors argument stands
good and the Exercitators exception against it falls to the ground. Now it is
certain as the present case stands, it is both impossible to obey the former
Powers, and unlawful to disobey the present. The former cannot with the least
shadow of reason be denied, and indeed the Exercitator seems to grant it,
whilst he puts the whole stresse of his answer upon a bare cessation, or
non-acting in obedience to the present Government. For it is plainly as
impossible to give actual obedience to any power there, where there is no
power actually to command, as it is for Caius being in the evening at London, to
meet Titius thenext morning at Venice; or it you will, as impossible (to come
nearer to the present case) as it is for caius being in England, to yield
subjection there to the sovereign power of Titius being in Venice; when indeed
others are actually and plenarily possessed of the sovereign power in England;
and Titius has actually no part in the sovereign power there. The
Exercitasaies as much, p 9.
The reason is evident in the Axiom, Relata mutuo se ponunt ac tellunt,
Relatives (and such are soverainty and subjection) stand and fall together.
Where there is no power to command, it must needs be impossible to obey,
because obedience properly presupposes a power commanding, and acommandment to
be obeyed. The latter is as truly unlawful, as the former apparently
impossible. For it is a sin against Romans 13.7. Not to render honor, to whom
honor is due; but honor is due to those that receive tribute, for they are
Gods Ministers, attending continually upon this very thing, v. 6. to those that
are Ministers under God for our good, and for vengeance and wrath to evil
doers, and so both actually bear the Sword, and bear it not in vain v. 4. to
those that being actually Rulers, are a terror to evil works, and a praise
to them that do well, v. 3. In a word, to those that are Ordained of God, and
they are the Powers that are; For there is no power but of God, and the power
that are, are ordained of God, v. 1. to those honor is due. Can any thing be
spoken more plainly for the duty of rendering honor to present powers? Let Us
see now our Exercitators Doctrine, how agreeable it is to this of the Apostle.
Honor, he says, is not due to those that are Gods Ministers continually
attending, not to those that receive tribute, not to those that are Gods
Ministers for vengeance and wrath to evil doers; not to those that bear the
Sword, and bear it not in vain; not to those that are Ministers under God for
our good, not to those that being actually Rulers, are a terror to evil
works, and a praise to such as do well; in a word, not to the powers that
are. To those honor is not due No? to whom then? to those, says our
Exercitator, that are not Gods Ministers continually attending, receive not
Tribute, are not Gods Ministers for wrath, bear not the Sword, are not Gods
Ministers for good; not Rulers, not a terror to the evil, not a praise to the
good; finally to those that ARE NOT, to those honor is due. To those? why to
those? why? because according to our Exercitators Doctrine, when the Apostle
says the powers that are, are ordained of God, he means the powers that are
not; and when he says, there is NO power but of God, his meaning is, there are
some powers (supreme powers) that are not of God: lastly, when he says, let
EVERY soul be subject, his meaning is, let some souls not be subject. Can any
thing be spoken more ridiculously absurd in it self, more contradictorie to
the word of God by his Apostle, to the mind of God in his word, or indeed to
reason and common sense? But hold a little, why must those that are not, be
obeyed, and those that are, disobeyed? Why? because William the Conqueror had
a lawful calling from the people, but the Commons in Parliament have none. And
yet the truth is, it may with no less evidence then truth, and as much as both
of is possible, be asserted, that there is not that supreme power this day
under the Sun, which has so express and full a calling from the people; the
people in so full a latitude, as the Commons of England in Parliament; unless
it be among the Macariens, not long since brought to light by the discoveries
of Raphael, H^^^deaeus. But to return thither whence we digrest, it is evident by
every stroke and lineament of the powers, which the Apostledescribes and limnes
out to be obeyed, that he means powers actually empowered, and not a power
actually dis-empowred, and in that respect, a mere Ens rationis. And therefore
if honor (which compared with the fifth Commandment, takes in the full
latitude of obedience) must in duty be given to those, to whom the Apostle
says it is due, and it be due, by the Apostles Doctrine, to the powers that
ARE and ACT; it follows, it is impossible to cease from an Act; that is, from
obedience to the present Covernment, because, Id tantum possumus quod jure
possumus, whatsoever is unlawful, is also in that respect impossible, and
therefore we may not disobey the present Government, because the word commands
to obey them; neither can any Oath disoblige from this duty of obedience, or
oblige to the sin of disobedience, for Rei illicitae nu^^a obligatio. To a
sinful thing (as our Exercitator speaks) there can be no Obligation. So it
remains, that our Authors argument was full, and the Exercitators exception is
nothing to the purpose.

There is yet one Objection behind, which cleared, cleares up this part of the
controversy. For it is urged, that To obey Powers possessed by wrong, is to
justify the Possess^urs wrong, and wrong the right of the dispossessed; and
therefore such obedience can be no duty but a sin.

The answer is clear. Obedience does indeed justify, that to which it is
properly and formally given. But the Obedience asserted is not so to be given,
either to the Act of Usurpation in entering, or the person of the Usurper, as
entering by such an Act into the supreme Power. But the truth is, the obedience
maintained, is properly and formally to be given: First, to the Ordinance of
God in the hand of the person actually entered. Neither can it, without manifest
contradiction to the word of truth, be denied, that the Sword or supreme
power, which is actually a terror to evil doers, and a praise to them that
do well, and therefore is not borne in vain, is truly the Ordinance of God.
And secondly obedience (as it is asserted) is properly and formally to be given
to the person actually entered; not as entering by Usurpation, but as that person
to whom the most High thinks meet to give the Kingdom of men, who by that
sovereign absolute and universal right which he claims as sole Lord and
maker of All; givesit both from, and to whomsoever he thinks meet; and who
many times for causes best known to himself, thinks meet, both to give it
from those who among men have an acknowledged right; and to those who have no
other right among men, but what himself as the most High, that rules in the
Kingdom of men, by virtue of his own supreme and absolute right, is pleased
from his own actual gist and donation to confer upon them. And this also is a
truth so manifest from the word of truth, in that 27. Chapter of Jeremy; as
nothing can be spoken with a more transcendent majesty, both of evidence and
authority. For we all know concerning the Kingdom of Judabh, that the
unquestionable right, as to man was solely in the house of David: neither can
we be ignorant, that therefore as to man, Nebuehadnezzar could have no right in
the least to that Kingdom. Yet the most High God having first premised verse.
5. his absolute soverainty, and soverain right, (by virtue of his bringing
forth all things, into their respective beings, by the exerted arm of his
Almighty power) to the dispensation of all things according to his pleasure,
acquaints us with the pleasure of his dispensation, concerning the Kingdom of
Judah, and with it all other Lands that sunk under the weight and force of the
victorious Sword of the Babylonian King, in these words verse. 6. And now have I
GIVEN all these Lands into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar the King of Babylon my
servant etc. And in the process, a universal obedience is peremtorily
commanded, and disobedience threatened with severest chastisements. From all
which it is evident, that God himself expressly, both ownes the giving of power
to those who have no Title in point of Right; and both commands obedience, and
for bids disobedience to those who (though God has always a design above
them) possess themselves of power by force and Usurpation. And to the truth of
this particular, and the deduction of this truth from the grounds before us, we
have the testimony of Mr. Calvin, with that fullness as more cannot be said.
Speaking of Nebuchadnezzar, hesaies:

Now What manner of King Nebuchadnezzer was, he that seekt Jerusalem, Jam
qualis ren faerit Nebu chadnezar, is qui Jerusalem expugnavit, satis scitur,
nempe strenuns aliorum invasor ac populator. Call. Inst. lib. 4. Cap. 20. 26.
Videmus quanta obedientia Dominus tetrum illum ferocemque tyrannum coli woluit,
non alia ratione nisi quia regnum obtainebat. Ibid. 27 Erustra objiciar quis
mandatum illud fuisse Israelitis peeuliare, Observandum enim est qua ratione
ipsum Dominus stabiliat; Deiuli, inquit, Nebuchadnezari regnum quare servite
ills. and vivite. Cuicuno; erge delatum fuisse regnum constalit, ei serviendum
esse ne dubitemas. Atque semnlac in regium fastigium quempiam evehit Dominus,
testatam nobis facis suam voluntatem, quod regnare illum velit.
is sufficiently known; to wit, a mighty Usurper, and oen that made speile of
others. And after wards speaking to Jerem. 27. We see (says he) with what
great obedience the Lord would have that cruel and fierce Tyrant to be
honored, for no other reason, but because he was in possession of the
Kingdom. But that which follows, exceeds what has been said, and is indeed as
much as in the present case can be said. In voine may any one Object, that
commandment [of obedience] was peculiar to the Israelites. For the reason must
be considered upon which the Lord grounds it; I have given (says he) the
Kingdom to Nebuchadnezzer. Wherefore serve ye him, and live. To whomsoever
therefore the supreme Power shall appear to be given; let us never doubt but
we must obey him. Seeing as soon as the Lord raises any person to a state of
soverainty, he gives us to know it is his express will that such a one have the
Government.

Upon he whole, the conclusion will be evident in its own light, and fairly
untye the knot of the present Objection. For, to give obedience to the
Ordinance of God, can never justify the disorder of man; neither can a
submission to the supreme right of God, be in any sort an injury to the
subordinate right of man. Which granted (as it cannot be denied) the obedience
asserted can never be a Sin, but continues stilll a Duty, against which no Oath
has power to oblige. And thus far shall suffice to have asserted this Truth,
that The Oaths objected oblige not against Obedience to present Powers.

But before we proceed to the third Assertion, although (as we said in the
beginning) our intention is not to enter into a Logomachie, or word-wrangle
with the Exercitator, wherein to give him his due, it must be confessed he has
deserved very well of the whole frye of School-boyes, and given them much light
into their true Syntaxis (as he speaks page 48.) in his large and exquisite
Comments upon the Pronouns and Conjunctions Copulative, and disiunctive; Him
and Them, and Her, and Their, and His, and Her, and Or, and And etc. Showing
himself a most profound Grammaticaster: Yet seeing his impotence cannot think
it self conspicuous enough in it self, without being injurious to others; we
cannot but take notice and give the Reader a short account of his injurious,
though impotent insinuation repeated (according to his usual vein of
Tautologies) thrice over (Page 18.43, 52.) against the Author of The
lawsulnesse of obeying etc.

It is to be admired (he says) That the Author should begin with a general
Deliberative [It were good to be considered etc.] And yet end with only a
particular instance in one of the Oaths to be considered.

Admiration (it is usually said) is the child of Ignorance; and it is true (if
ever) here of our learned Exercitators double, if not treble ignorance, in
respect both of the present ground of his admiration, and his mistake about the
meaning, both of the Author and Oath.

For first, what necessity is, there I pray, that he that propounds matter
worthy of general consideration to others, must therefore himself enter into
a particular enumeration of particulars? As if he that should say, it were
good to consider, whether the so much applauded Exercitation be not a piece
that deserves better to be exploded, and instance only in page 88. where the
Exercitator besides his falfifying the History alleged, and with it the truth
it self, shows himself after all his discourse about true Syntaxis, unable
to construe his own Latin; should yet be bound to follow him in a particular
investigation of his perplexed impertinencies, from his first entrance into his
Amercian deserts, Page 5. to Page 88. before mentioned, which shuts up his idle
Exercitation. Obut he says, The Author seems to fasten on that instance,
because he thoughthimselfe best able to loosen its Obligation. A piece of
discretion i will assure you, of which if the Exercitator had been guilty, he
had never undertaken to loosen souls from subjection to the powers that are,
by endeavoring to fasten on them the Doctrine of disobedience, though he were
feign to sneake into America to fetch it. But he leaves the judgment of the
Authors performance to the Reader; and so shall we of his.

But first he falls into another fit of Admiration. What Is the matter! He
admires, Seeing the Author accounts Oaths sacred Bonds and reverend
Obligements; how he feared not to use such enforcement, to the clear letter of
so tender and sacred a thing. Bona verba! If (before we dismiss the
Exercitator) we find not himself really guilty of an enforcement to learned
Paraeus, not much better (for the nature of enforcement is the same, however
the subject differ) then that which is here but pretended, and that too without
the least ground given by our Author, but merely taken from his own
ignorance, and hammered out into the deformed piece of perjury in the charge,
upon the black forge of his own mistake; we shall allow him to fall into a
third fit of Admiration. In the mean time whilst he endeavors wrongfully to
fasten on our Author, an interpretation begotten (like Ixion's Centaures) on
the Cloud of his own mis-apprehension, what does be but create a fault, that
he may not want an accusation, though he bring himself within the guilt of
bearing false witness against his Neighbor by it, which (as he speaks)
borders upon Perjury; and surely is not very agreeable to that Hyperbolcall
Character of the Exercitator, held forth in the glorious bush of the Epistle to
the Reader.

Wherefore of show the true intent of our Author, and with all the untrue,
charge of this Accuser; Our Author (as we can speak from some that have reason
to know) never intended the present Powers, as the Successors in the Oath, at
the Exercitator ingorantly, or maliciously, or both (let him take his choice)
mistakes him; his intention in truth (and his discourse testifies as much) was
only to enforce a Dilemma, upon those that argue for the Obligation of the
Oath. For he reasons, that if Heirs and Successors must, (as the Exercitator
and all that are of his judgment, say they must,) be understood of the same
persons, the Obligation of the Oath must needs ceasE upon such a juncture of
affairs, wherein neither the Successors are Heirs, nor the Heirs Successors.
And to take off the Objection of a Succession in Right, though not in Fact; He
showed that that word usually is, and therefore truly must (as indeed it must)
be understood in the Oath of actual Successors; unless a Nation may be
Governed by, and give obedience to a mere Ens rationis; for a Successor in
right only, though never so truly in right, as such, is such or no better.
Behold the strength of the perjurious accusation, or more truly the weakness
of the injurious accuser, after all those solmne aggravations, in which he
has dressed up his accusation, and his grave advice to the Author upon it;
whereas indeed had himself been so well advised, as he should have been, he
never had laid so heavy a charge upon so light, or in truth, no ground, on a
person of whom he confesses to have received so fair a Character from the
worthy Author of the religious Demurrer. And now after his threefold attempt on
the word Successors, to wound the reputation of our Author, because here (at
least) he thought he had met with a Flaw, what is all he has gained, save
only a fuller confirmation, both of our Authors integrity, and the truth
asserted by him, and a further discovery both of the weakness of his cause,
and the greatness of his little good will toward our Author?

-- Fragili quaerens illidere dentem, Offendit solido. But seeing he talks of
an Enforcement to the clear letter of the Oath (though indeed the true sense
of an Oath, more then of the Scripture it self, is not always to be finally
determined by the Letter) what will he say, if it be proved against himself,
that he is truly guilty of the enforcement, untruly charged by him on our
Author? may he not then justly be struck into a worse fit then any of the
former, not of Admiration, but astonishment? Yet peradventure this is not a
thing altogether impossible nay possibly it may be done in very few words.
Wherefore though we assert nothing Magisterially, yet to meet with our
Exercitator in the same path which himself has chalk tout, we shall commend
the sequel to the serious and impartial confideration and judgment of the
Reader.

Out of his own mouth shall we judge our Exercitator. For page. 48. He tells
us, that by Succession in the Oath, must be intended heirs in Succession. It
follows then, that by his own confession, the Oath obliges not to Heirs out
of Succession. And indeed herein he speaks reason, though afterward he is so
unhappy, as to contradict both reason and himself, when he lights upon it;
for he would have those termed Successors which do not actually succeed, which
may be with as much propriety of speech (for Oaths sure do not use to speak
in Tropes) as Mons may be said a movendo. He pretends that our Authors
interpretation borders upon perjury; but I am sure his own both borders upon
it, and falls into the very bosom of nonsense. No he says, for there is a
succession in Right, as well as in Fact. What then? A succession in Right, and
not in Fact, is not better then no succession to the Nation. Does the Oath
bind to actual Obedience to a person that is not an actual Successor? An
evident impossibility to give actual obedience to a person that does not
actually suicceed.

Incidit in Scillam etc.

But he has yet another string to his Bow. For he says the Oath of Supremacy
binds to a lawful Successor. Much to the purpose. How can he be a lawful
Successor that (as K.) does not succeed at all? Non entis nullo sunt
accidentia. But the truth is, it had been good this Author had understood the
true state of the Oath of Sapremacy, before he had adventured upon it. To do
that he should have consulted with 5. Eliz. and that would have conducted him
to an Injunction, in the premonition to which Injunction, he would have found
that this Oath was to be interpreted and taken In this sense viz. To exnelude
all foreign Jurisdiction. And so he might have spared his Logic and
Rhetoric both, concerning this Oath, which as is wholly unconcerned in the
present case; for here is no question about Foreign juisdiction. But to omit
this and proceed; what if by the laws of the Land, a Successor, in Fact, be a
lawful Successor, at least until he be lawfully rmov'd, has he any whit
advantaged himself by the word Lawful? Yet that so it is, seems to be very
clear in the case of H. 7. If we will receive the verdict of the Sages of the
Law, the company of Judges assembled in the Exchequer Chamber upon it, even
when his Person was actually under an attaindour of Treason, and before the
Parliament conferred that right which the Exercitator contradicting himself (as
we shall show elsewhere) would pretend; Heart their words as they are given us
by the Lord Verulam; It was (says he) with unanimous consent resolved, That
the Crown takes away all defects and stops in blood; from the time the King
did assume the Crown, the Fountain was cleared, and all attaindours and
corruptions of blood discharged. What can be more plain? Bacon H. 7. page 13.
From the time he assumed the Crown, that is, after his actual possession of
soverainty and Succession to the former King, although his Title had before
been condemned by Parliament in H. 6. and the Succession in right, were then
in the Lady Elizibeth, yet the Successor in fact is unanimousy acknowledged a
lawful Successor in the soverainty. Again, It was (says our Author) agreed
and resolved by the same Judges, and their Resolutions were accordingly
followed by the Parliament then fitting; That the Knights and Burgesses should
forbear to come into the House, till a Law were past for the reversall of
those attainders, under which he had said before diverse of them were, for a
acting against, R. 3. whom all the world acknowledges to have been an Usurper.
Where, beside the confutation of the Exercitators Doctrine, page 7. That, the
House must be free for all to come to, that their Acts may be free and
authoritative; It is worth the Readers most serious observation, that by the
opinion of the Judges generally assembled, an attainder may be brought in for
Treason against an Usurper, and stands good in Law, Nota, Diciair and non
negaiur quod proditione facta tempore H. ^^qui fuit usurper del Crown le
party sera arraigne de ceau tempore E. 4. vel bujus modi, per compassant le
more regis poet esse pune tempere alterius, Regi: Comment que l'un suet Vsurp.

Brook, Grand Abrigement Tit. Treason.


until by course of Law it be reverst, though the Usurper himself were
removed. Which proves clearly, that Treason is truly Treason by the Law of the
Land, though committed against an Usurper. And to this Brook, gives a full and
clear testimony; for Note, says he, It is affirmed beyond contradiction, that
for treason committed in the time of H. 6. who was an Usurper of the Crown,
the party shall be arraigned thereof in the time of Edw. 4. Or such a person
may be punished in the time of an other King, for compassing the death of a King
that was an Usurper. By all which it is clear, that a Successor in Fact, by
the Law of the Land, is a lawful Successor, until lawfully removed. And that
passage concerning H. 6. is very remarkable. For when Richard Duke of York,
had Seated himself in the Chair of State in the Lords house in Parliament,
and there laid claim to the Crown, and made good his claim and Title to the
Parliament, it is said, When the Lords and Commons there assembled, had with
mature deliberation and good advice, Marting History of the Kings and Queens of
Engl. page 258.
soundly debated on this important business, it was by them all enacted, that
King H. should so long as he lived, retain the name and honor of a King etc.
So great respect had our Ancestors to Successors in Fact, even where the
Successor in Right, and of eminent worth and abilities was present, and
claiming, and had judgment also given on his side. And upon the ground in Law
before mentioned, was the Statute of 11. H. 7. Enacted, which frees from the
guilt of Treason, for adhering to Successors in Fact. But the Exercitation
espies yet another advantage in the Oath, by which he makes account easily to
elude all this; for he says the succession is to a Crown and Dignity, but that
is abolish; and therefore the Successors which he pretends our Author pleads
for, can never be those intended in the Oath. Is it indeed abolisht? How then
can the Successor which he pleads for, be the Successor in the Oath, more then
they? nay how can he indeed be either Successor or Heir? He that is either
Heir or Successor to that which is a abolish, is such to that which is not;
he that is such to that which is not, is such to that which is indeed nothing;
much good do it him, both with his Heir and Successor-ship; the man has
fairly confuted himself. But then again, does he know what the Crown and
Dignity he talks on, is? Does its essence consist in a Name or Thing? If in a
Name, There is no body desires much to take it from him, provided he be
contented with that only. If it consist in a Thing, then the name is only
changed, the thing still remains, and so they of whom our Author (as he would
pretend) speaks, may be the Successors in the Oath, notwithstanding what he
Objects to the contrary, concerning the abolishing of the Crown and Dignity.
Yet again he sales, the Oath intends by Heirs and Successors the Jame
Persons, which he goes about to prove, too ridiculously to need an answer, and
adds, admit them diverse, and the Oath will import a contradiction. For he
says, had the persons been diverse, it must have been Heirs [or] not [and]
Successors. Right. For you know in a Lease, we must not say Executors,
Administrators [and] Assigns, but [or] Assigns, unless Assigns mean the
same persons, with Executors and Administrators, else it will imply a
contradiction. Where Is his true Syntaxis now? will not every Scrivener tell him
that this deserves the Ferula? Again, admit them diverse, and the Oath will
import a contradiction. A very weak exception, but a strong contradiction to
the truth, and therein a real inforcement to the clear Letter of the Oath;
his overhasty zeal making him truly fall into that very crime, which he had
before wrongfully charged on our Author. For why I pray, may we not swear to
perform the duty of the Oath, to diverse sorts of persons, at diverse times
obtaining, and without a contradiction; seeing both cannot obtain at once, if
the words bear adifferent signification? And that their signification is
indeed different, The Exercitator himself cannot deny, whilst he grants the
word [Successours] even in the present Oath to be a Term in Law, Page 50. For
every Puisne will tell him that has but read the first Chapter in Littleton,
that words that make a different estate in Law, must in Law have a different
signification. Besides reason it self will dictate, that they were at first
intended different. For the Oath being made by the Kingdom in Parliament, was
intended to make provision for the Kingdom, as well as the King; (and not for
the King, without the Kingdom, as the Exercitator sondly imagines) in case the
line obtaining should fail, or upon other emergencies whatever that might
ensue. To conclude this particular; our Author to show the ordinary acception
of the word Successor, bids ask the question, who was Successor to W.
Conqueror. The Exercitator takes him up very Magisterially and says, it is
fallaciously propounded. Rightly, he says, 'twill be this, Who is to be his
Majesty's Successor? But surely he has not more fallaciously, then foolishly
propounded a question, which Friar Bacons head would hardly have been able to
answer him. For if it must be understood, as he tells us he intends it, Of the
suture time, and a thing to be done in it; He that shall give a true answer to
the question so propounded, and so understood, must either answer by
inspiration, or confess that our learned Exercitator has clearly put him to
a non-plns.

Before we conclude this Chapter, we cannot but taste of one more dish of
Objections served in (as indeed it is somewhat a homely o^e) our of a Homily.
For he tells us the Homily is fully and flatly against Subjects removing or
disposing (sure it should be deposing) their Princes upon any pretense
whatsoever. This Homily he says is part of the Doctrine of the Church of
England; and this Doctrine of the Church of England he says, we are bound by
Protestation to maintain; and this sticks very much with him, for he knows
not how the contrary can stand with the Protestation. Well, for this once I
shall undertake with his own, and the help of the Fuller Answer to be his
Oedipus. I answer therefore, If he please to call it to mind, he may remember
he told us, that in his America the House of Commons, were coordinate with the
American Prince; now if he do not understand his own Terms, the Fuller
Answer will tell him, that where there is a Coordination, there is no
Subordination, but Subjects are Subordinate; therefore he adds, that all the
Members Collectine in their House, are not Subjects. Again, our Exercitator
makes his coordinate Commons, the Fundament Us of his American Government. And
in this case the Fuller Answer will tell him again, Fundamentalls admit not of
higher and lower; all foundations are principal alike, there can be therefore
no subjection. So it is not much material, whether his Homily be part of the
Doctrine of the Church of England or no, for the practice in America, is not
contrary to the Doctrine in England. But certainly some that have reason to
know, say that those Homilies are no part of the Doctrine of the Church of
England: and that the Articles give them only this Testimony, that they
contain wholesome Doctrine, and suitable to their times. But enough, if not too
much of this we hasten to our third Assertion.

CHAP. IIII. That obedience is due to Powers in possession, though unlawfully
entered.
IN answering the Arguments, from the Oaths objected in the former Chapter,
against obedience to present Powers, when supposed to be unlawfully entered;
there was frequent cause to demonstrate the Duty of such obedience, which
properly should have been the work of the present Assertion, wherefore having
as to the point in hand already spoken so much, so much the less will need now
to be added.

The Exercitator page 64. acknowledges, The lawfulness of obeying etc. has of
all others, spoken most for the obedience to be maintained; and upon that
account tells us, he intends to speak most against what was by him spoken. We
shall herein follow the path which he has thus trod out to us, and if we do
but make good our Authors part against his Antagonist, we shall defeat his
maine Battle by his own confession.

The first task he undertakes, is, to prove that the Apostle in the place
urged by our Author, ( Romans 13.) can only be understood of a lawful
Magistracy, and to make that good, compares it (as he had done before, in
laying his foundation page 1.) with Hos. 8.4. Wherefore if here we find his
foundation Sandy, his whole edifice will sufficiently appear to be ruinous To
proceed then, from the comparison of those two Scriptures he concludes page 66.
That the former speaks of a legal, the latter of an illegal Magistracy, else
they would be contradictory. Wherein I am sure he is contradictory to his own
Doctrine, as his own Doctrine is contradictory to the truth, and consequently
needs no other Judge, but his own mouth to condeme it. For first, he is
apparently contradictory to himselfs, in that at the beginning, he would have
Usurpers to be but private persons, Page 9. and Romans 13. must be understood
(how universally soever spoken) of a lagal Magistracy only; yet in conclusion,
he finds a distinction between a legal and illegal Magistracy. But why? you
will say there may be a fair answer to all this; the contradiction is only in
terms, not in things, in appeareance, not truth; by illegal Magistracy, he
means no other then Usurpers. Does he mean Usurpers? then clearly he
confutes, as well as contradicts his own Doctrine. For if he do (as indeed he
does) here intend Jeroboam and his Successors, whom as here, so before in the
entrance of his discourse, he strongly proves to be Usurpers, both by this very
Scripture, and the judgment of diverse learned Divines upon the place; then
certainly the confused pile of the whole discourse, like Babylon is fallen; and
we need no other prospect to behold its ruin, then the light and advantage
which the present Scripture will afford us. For first, whereas he would make
Usurpers no more but private persons, who sees not that as himself here terms
them Magistrates, though as to their Title and entrance into the Magistracy,
they were illegal and Usurpers: So this very Scripture which he brings to
prove them Usurpers; and their History in Scripture records them by the Name,
Title, State, and Dignity, of the Kings and Princes of Israel? And secondly,
whereas he would prove that obedience is not due to Usurpers, because as our
Exercitator would pretend they are no Magistrates; who knows not that those
Usurping Princes were the Magistrates of Israel, and Obadiah, Eliah, and diverse
other Prophets and Servanas of God gave obedience to them according yes to
their Magistrates? Lastly, what does he but Nodum in scirpo quaerere, in
setting the Scriptures, mentioned at such a distance? Seeing Hos. 8.4. speaks
expressly of Powers, in fieri in their entrance, concerning their making or
setting up. But Romans 13 speaks of Powers in facto esse, in possession and
acting, as Ministers for the good of mankind, from verse 1. to verse 7. And so
we may help his memory, for by his frequent contradictions he seems to need
it, to untye this knot from his own words, Page 2. Where he tells us
concerning Jeroboam and his Successors, That the Event and effect, that is (or
I know not what it is) their actual possession of Power, and acting in a way
of Government, for the good of the souls subject, was from God; as how?
certainly the other negative part of the contra-distinction considered, if he
speak sense he must mean, by ordination, not permission only: but (he says)
the sinful means by which it, that is, their actual possession of Power was
accomplished, was not from God; as how? Surely, if he speak reason, reason
will say, not by ordination, but permission only. As Jacobs actual obtaining
of the blessing, was that which God had ordained; but his obtaining it by
deceit, was only by divine permission. And that the Reader may see, that when
we affirm that the person of Jeroboam as a Magistrate, though not his practice
as an Usurper, was from a divine ordination, and the power in his hand, though
an Usurper, the Ordinance of God; we speak not that which none else ever spoke
before; if the judgment of Paraeus may be of any moment in the point, no man
can speak more expressly; for speaking of Gods rending the Kingdom from
Rebohoam, and setting up the Kingdom of Israel in Jerohoam; hus he delivers
himself, grounding his judgment upon Nec fortuit o aut hominnm ta tum
concilio and pe-fidia, nec deo inscio aut invito, sed ita volente and ordinance
illam (...) Regni con^itu^i onem ^actam fuisse, Historia sa^^a ^esta^u^, 1 Reg.
11.31.35,37. 1 Reg. 12.15.24, Parae. in Romans 13. Dub. 3. Ad. 1

12 15, 14. The constituton of a new Kingdom, came not to pass either by
accident, or by the council and treachery of men only; neither was it without
the knowledge, or against the will of God, but because he ordained and would
have it so.

Can any thing be spoken more plain from the express Text of Scripture, which
was also urged before in the preceding Chapter, to prove, that Government
though in the hand of an Usurper, is the Ordinance of God? and therefore the
person of the Usurper, though not his sinful entrance by Usurpation, is by a
divine ordination; and so a Minister of God for our good, which the Exercitator
would deny. It Is clear then and undeniable, that the Exercitator has laid in
a ^^l^e principle, as the Cornerstone of his whole structure, which being once
shaken and removed, the whole with its whole burden, like a ruinous building,
comes tumbling to the ground. For if (as has already been proved) an Usurper
in possession be a Magistrate, though in respect of entrance illegal; and if
Government in his hand be (as it has been proved to be) the Ordinance of God;
then it follows beyond contradiction, that the Apostle, Rom 13. speaks of
such inclusively; and therefore such in duty must be obeyed, and cannot without
sin be resisted, which confutes the Exercitators Doctrine, and confirms the
assertion of our Author.

What has our Antagonist to say to the Contrary? he would prove that Usurpers
may be resisted; and instances most absurdly, in Chedorlaomer and his
participants, who never were possessed of the Government of Sodom, only made an
invasive War, and tooks some Prisoners; and who ever denied that an invader or
intruder, in that action may be lawfully resisted or that to join with him in
it, were to be equally guilty; but our assertion is not against residing au
Usurper in the Act of intrusion, but against resisting Government in the hand
of an intruder, when he is actually possessed of it, and so is the only person
left us by the providence of God, to be his Minister to us for good, in the
dispensation of that Ordinance, to whom we may be the clear and general
Dialect of the Scriptures conclude, that the most High, who gives the Kingdom
of men to whom be thinks meet, has now (to the uttermost that were can judge)
thought meet to give it.

His other instances are as absurd as the former, for they speak only of a
resistance, or rather indeed a defensive War managed by public and supreme
Magistrates, and those too, all persons of an extraordinary Call, excepting the
Maccabees; whereas if he would have spoken to the purpose, he must have given
an instance from Scripture, of some private Saint, resisting a public
Magistrate obtaining, upon pretense, that in his judgment the Title of the
Magistrate was not good; but that indeed is a task too hard for the whole
Tribe of Exercitators. In the mean time he has sufficiently confuted himself
in the instance concerning Athaliah, for seeing the Text fares expressly,
Athaliah reigned six years, and all men know there can be no reigning without
Subjection, it follows, private persons must be subject to Usurpers in
possession. Again, whereas Jehoiada and those Rulers over hundreds, stirred
not for Joash his Right, till the end of six years; nor then neither, but with
such caution as prevented the embroyling of the Commonwealth, it is clear that
public persons and chief Magistrates, may not remove an Usurper, in the most
clear and uncontroverted case, with danger and disturbance to the
Commonwealth. And lastly, whereas it is said Athaliah reigned; it is evident that
the Seripture speaks of Usurpers in possession, as of Magistrates, and not
private persons.

But he urges, a lawful calling from the People, is essential to a
Magistrate. It is answered. First, few Kingdoms in Europe have been so begun,
or indeed otherwise then by conquest; and if a consent of the people come
after, what is that but an effect of force? And herein is briefly, but clearly
answered, all that he has said for the lawful calling of his Roman
Emperors; for what Tully (cited by himself) says of one, may with the same
truth be said concerning all the rest, He had Attulerat jam liberae civitati,
partim meru, partim patientia, consuetudinem serviendi. Cicero in M.A Philip.
2. Orar.
now reduced the City [of Rome] from a state of liberty, to a custom of
servitude, partly by fear, and partly by suffering. To which add that notable
testimony of Tacitus, concerning Tiberius out of his own mouth. It is recorded
(says Tacitus) That Tiberius as often as he went out of the Senate, was wont
to use expressions aloud in Greek, Memorae proditur, Tiberum, quoties curia
egrederetur, grecis verbis in bunc modum elequi, selitum, OHO MINES AD
SERVITVIEM PARATOS! scilicet etiam illum, qui libertatem publicam nollet,
tamprojectae servient ium patientiae taedehat. Tacit. An. l. 3.
and to this effect: O men prepared for servitude! the trnth is, though
himself were against public Liberty, yet he loathed at their base patience,
in submitting themselves to servitude. Behold his own Conscience condemning
him of Usurpation upon the public liberty; and yet the Exercitator is not
ashamed to enforce a Title upon him, though therein he oppose himself to the
generally received judgment of the most approved writers of all sorts, as were
easy to show, if time would give leave.

But Secondly, what if it were granted, that the essence of a particular
persons call to the office of Magistracy, is such as the Exercitator would have
it, yet the essence of Magistracy it self, consists not in this call, and may
therefore subsist without it; neither can the disorder of man, in the manner or
circumstance about the person administering, make the matter or substance of the
Ordinance of God of none effect, no more then the entering into the office of a
high Priest among the Jews, by ways corrupt and unwarantable, did null and
make void the Office self, Or to give an instance of our own clear and
unquestionable; it is well known that persons unduly chosen Members of
Parliament, have properly no Right to fit and Vote in the House; yet their
Votes are never the less valid, in any Act of the supreme Legislative power,
though afterward the undunesse of the election be proved, and the persons
discharged from further fitting in the House. The like may be said concerning
Usurping Princes of this Nation, whose Acts in Law stand good at this day, and
have a great influence into the present Policy among us.

But here the Exercitator replies, thereis a mistake in this argument, for
though those Usurping Princes entered by force, or otherwise unlawfully; yet
they had the concurrent or subsequent consent of Parliaments. Was ever man more
grossly mistaken, that would pretend himself an Aristarchus over the mistakes
of others? For first what power, by his own grounds has one that enters by
force, or otherwise unlawfully, (that is, an Usurper) to call a Parliament? an
Usurper (if himself say true) is no more but a private person; and if a
private person by force, or otherwise unlawfully call a Parliament; what is
that Parliament but an effect of that force, and unlawful Act, and therefore
it self unlawful? for the effect follows the nature of the cause. Nay
secondly, what power (by his own grounds) has a Parliament however called to
give away the right from him, hat has it, to him that has none? The people
(or the Exercitator is mist ken) have no power to give their Consent, being
preing aged to a^o^he^s right; nay their consent (unless the Exercitator be
fill, in a mistake) is void and null, and a Parliament (he tells us) has no
power but what the people give them. But thirdly, granting Parliaments so
called as has been said, lawful; and the usurping Prince legally invested (as
the grand corrector of mistakes speaks) by those Parliaments, and granting
(which is also his own) that the Prince must have no hand in conferring any
thing to his own Title, for that were (as he says) a selfe-created Titles,
when all is past, the worst, is to come for the Exercitater; for from the
premises, it will inevitably follow. First, that the supreme power is
originally properly, and only in the House of Commons, for they only are the
representatives, and by consequence the trustees of the people, and therefore
they only can give a Prince a legal Title; because (if our Exercitator be not
mistaken in his very foundation) a lawful calling from the people, is
essential to a Magistrate rightly constituted. Secondly, it follows clearly,
that the supreme power is so absolutely in the House of Commons, that they may
without wrong take the Kingly authority from him, that had the right and give
both right and it to him that had none. 3ly. It cannot be denied, but if they
have (as by the premises the most have) an obsolute power to take the Kingly
authority from whom, and give it to whom they think meet; they have also a
power, when they shall think meet, to reserve the exercise thereof to
themselves; if they shall judge it meet for the good of the Representees,
otherwise they should be unfaithful to their trust. Lastly it follows, that
the Commons sit not by ve^tue of the Princes call, but their own right; for an
Usurper (as it is confessed such were the Princes in question, at the time of the
calling) is but a private person; and no more (witness our Exercitator) and
therefore has no power to call a Parliament. And now let the Reader judge upon
the whole, whether ever there were such a Felo de se, as is this wretched
discourse of our Exercitator: or whether instead of correcting one, he has not
showed himself a thing merely made up of a heap of mistakes.

But to proceed, he tells us page 74 75. That the Author of The lawfulness of
obeying etc. has but half quoted Paraeus, as well as impertinently; and that,
according to Paraeus, unjustly gotten power is not of God, in regard of the
person, or man owning it, and consequenly not to be obeyed, by verue of Romans 13.

To do the Exercitator right, Nec refert quibus medijs vel artibus Nimrod
Jeroboam aut alij regra sibi pa-averint. Nam aliud est potestas que a deo est,
aliud acquisitio and usus potestaus, que indisserens, alias legitima, alias
illegitina, Parae. (...) Romans 13.
we shall take his own whole quotation of Paraeus; and then let the most
partial Judge, whether he has not done Paraeus, and the Author quoting him;
and herein the Reader and himself worng, in forcing a sense upon Paraeus, so
much at enmity with his words. Paraeus says, It matters not by what means
Nimrod, Jeroboam, or others got Kingdoms to themselves; for the power which is
of God is one thing, the getting and use of the power is another, which is
indifferent, sometimes lawful, sometimes unlawful. And again, dubijs,
whether both Paraeus and the Exercitator himself, refers us so the fuller
explication of this place: We must discern betwixt the power which is EVER of
God, and betwixt the getting and use of the power, Discernendum test inter
potesta em que semper a Deo est, and inter acquisitionem and usurpationem, que
quod homines saepe est injustissima, non a Deo, sed ad hominem affectibus and
Statnae Malitia. Idem. Ibid.
which as to men is often most unjust, not of God, but of men's lusts, and
Satan's malice. Wherefore to examine the true sense of the premises, and compare
them with the Exercitators deduction. It matters not (says Paraeus) by what
means or craft Nimrod. Jeroboam or others: what others? Our Exercitator shall
answer other Usurper; for such he has proved Jeroboam more then once, besides,
such get Kingdoms to themselves by craft etc. Again, It matters not, says
Paraeus, in what respect matters in not? Reason and truth shall answer in
respect of their Authority to command, and the Subjects Duty to obey. For in
the words immediately foregoing; he was proving that Civil power is the
Ordinance of God, and adds, although in the hand of Nimrod, or Jeroboam, as he
expressly affirms, concerning the former Ad. 2. De Nimrodo. And concerning the
latter, as expressly Ad 1 Hos. 8.4. Lastly, it matters not, says Paraeus: Why
matters it not? Why? because the Power howsoever, and by whomsoever got, is
EVER of God, and consequently from him derives its Authority to command; and
for him requires our duty to obey, and thus to eye God in our obedience, is to
obey according to Romans 13.5. For Conscience sake, in the judgment of Paraeus,
with whom the Annotations of our own divines concur. And yet our learned
Exercitator says but Sure he sees not what he says) Paraeus in your place
speaks nothing pro or con of obedience to Usurpers; when notwithstanding
having traveled some then lines further toward the end of that Paragraph,
forgeting that he had said in the beginning, (so treacherous is his memory)
that Paraeus speaks nothing against obedience to Usurpers, he tells us (from
the latter quotation, which himself as well as Paraeus makes interpretative to
she former) he tells us (most grossly contradicting himself, and the truth) That
Paraeus is against obedience to Usurpers, by virtue of Romans 13. Non quecunque
per vim vel dolum acquiruntur cum sint per se bona, cessant esse d^ Deo.
Dissere nendum est enim interjus dei quod in res bonas nun quam amittis, a
quibuscunque teneantur: and teneantur; and inter judicia dei puibus bona sua
sic distribuit, ut in eorum acqui suione and usu vitium hominum aliquando
concurrere permittat etc.

Sic igitur de acquisitione etiam imperiorem and regnorum, quoe Perce, quae
Greci, quae Romani, iujustice fere bellis and oppressionibas acquisiuerunt, est
judicandum. Parae. in Romans 13.


Once more and we have done. Paraeus says: Things that are good in themselves,
cease not to be from God, bowever gotten by force or fraud. For we must
discern betwixt the right of God, which he never loose in good things, by
whomsoever, and howsoever possessed: and betwixt the judgments of God, by which
he distributes his good things so, as he sometimes suffers the vitiousnesse men
to concur in the getting and use of them etc. Thus thereforo are we to judge of
the getting, even of Empiers and Kingdoms, which the Persians, which the
Grecians, which the Romans got, for the most part, by unjust wars and
oppressions. And accordingly, Ad 2. De. Nimrodo, not far before the words cited
by the Exercitator himself, Paraeus says, However Nimrod were an oppressor and
Tyrant, yet it follows not, that HIS power was not of God: Yet nor modest
Exercitator blushes not to affirm that Paraeus says, unjustly gotten Power is
not of God, in regard of the person, or man owning it. Could any thing be
spaken more apparently, untrue in it self, by one that professes himself
studious of truth? more injurious beyond all modesty, both to Paraeus, and the
Author quoting him, by an Exercitator pretending to modesty? yet if he had
answered without book again, it had been tolerable. But to accuse his
Antagonist of a partial and imperninent quotation; and yet himself after a
professed consultation with Paraeus, to use such enforcement, to the clear
letter of the Author, in the fairest language that can be given it, it is not
fair.

To conclude, it is observable here, that whilst Paraeus maintains the
Authority of Nimrod and Jeroboam to be of God; he neither takes away Usurpation
from them, nor gives them a right Title. And accordingly Salon, after he had
fully and undeniably proved the Duty of obeying the just commands of an
Usurper, yet councels the Usurper to leave his Usurpation, and to get the
express consent of the people. It is not necessary therefore (as the
Exercitator would infer) that a tacit consent of the people to obey, take away
Usurpation. For the consent can justify no further then it goes, and it goes
no further (in this case) then to give Authority to the Usurpers just commands,
for the present good of the Commonwealth. And upon this ground, it is that the
Law gives Authority to a Lord of M^nnour, though a Disseisor, to hold a Court,
and the Tenants may swear Fealty to him, and do him service, yet neither
justify the Disseisors Tide, nor wrong the Title of the Disseised.

There is therefore a Tacit, and Interpretative consent of the people (which
our Author truly asserts, and the Exercitator in vain denies) when (as reason
wills) they consent that the Power which is peaceably possessed should Govern
pro tempore, rather then that confution and War should destroy the
Commonwealth. And such a consent is sufficient to constitute such a
Magistrate. Wherefore having made good our Assertion against such Objections in
the Exercitation, as are any way material; We shall professedly omit the rest.
Only we cannot but take notice of the wretched folly, and vanity of his empty
challenge Page 75 wherein as he tacitly grants the whole cause; so he does it
in express words to any understanding Reader. For it obedience be
substantially (as already it has been) proved a Duty; all Circummstantial
Objections vanish as a mist before the Sun.

And now for a conclusion, (that our Exercitator may end as ill as he began) he
goes about to make good the Title of the Romans, to the Kingdom of Judaea,
even against the Title of the House of David, and of the great Son of David;
Christ himself, who, as Mr. Perkins acknowledges, was right Heir to the
Crown, and Kingdom of the Jews. And to bring this to pass, he leapes over
the Beams of Massy, and mighty Arguments that lie in his way, and takes up
little Motes, and Strawes to bind up this forged Title.

First, He passes by the whole Title of the House of David, and that great
promise, That there should not want a man to set on his Throne.

Secondly, He takes no notice, how the Maccabees came by the Kingdom, which
was by force and power; when there was another King a Successor of Alexander,
even of that beast in Daniel, whose Kingdom was divided into four parts, yet
the Exercitators party condemns this, if now a Title be thus gotten by
Subjects.

Thirdly, He said nothing of the point, whether the High Priest were capable of
a Crown, and could bear at once on his head, both a Crown and Mitre; wherein,
some say, he was a pattern of Antichrist.

Fourthly, He observes not, that there was a Covenant of peace and agreement
made in the Temple, and bound with Oaths, and confirmed by mutual embracings,
between Hircanus and Aristobulus; that Aris^^bulus should command the
Kingdom; and this was done in the sight of all the People.

Fifthly, He gives no proof that Hircanus having given away the Kingdom
before, could give it after to Pompey; nor that a King at all can give away a
Kingdom, without his Kingdoms consent. Yea, he cannot prove that he did it:
yet this is one of the motes with which h^ ^inds up Pompeyes Title; because
Hircmus, whoin his opinion, had the better Title (though perchance none at all)
untreated him to come to help him, and to judge the controversy between him
and his Brother: And a second is this, as if Pompey had got the good will of
the people, to give the Kingdom to him; whereas himself says but this, that
Pompey, after he had taken Jerusalem, did rather by good turns then terrors
conciliate the People to himself, Now this speaks, what Pompey did to please
the people, not what the people did to him; much less that they gave up the
Kingdom to him, which they would have given to none. For the truth is,
Josephus says; That all the whole Nation [marke the words ALL and WHOLE] were
against both Hircanus and Aristobulus, for bringing them under the servitude of
a Kingdom; For they said, their Custom was to be Governed by Gods High Priest.
But I hope Pompey was no Priest, and therefore they did not choose him for their
Governor.

And for the words of Antipater concerning Antigonus, when he craved assistance
from Caesar, they are very untruly alleged, they being thus in the author: He,
that is Antigonus, craved not maintenance for that he wanted, but that he might
raise a rebellion among the Jews; and against them who should bestow any thing
upon him; that is against Caesar, if he should give him any relief. But the
Exercitators Latin, (...)
Non propter inopiam desiderare facultatem sed ut in eos qui dedissent
Iudaeorum seditiones accenderet, is thus construed by him. He sought not
relief of Caesar, because he was poor; but that he might kindle jewish
seditions, against these had made a dedition of themselves. Behold, the
foundation of a Kingdom laid upon a false construction of Latin. But is it not
a desperate boldness, that this man should take upon him to be a writer, who
cannot construe his own Latin; yea that he should put his Latin in the Margent,
to shame his own english, especially there being an english Translation, that
might have taught him to construe it? But to be short, the story is truly thus,
Hircanus living quietly after the forementioned Agreement, between him and his
Brother, was continually provoked by Antipater, (the Father of Herod) to stir
for the Kingdom; to which at last yiedling, and Pompey being in those parts,
they sent to Pompey concerning their differences, who gave them audience, and
promised to came into their Country, to determine their differences, and told
them, that in the mean time, they should live in peace.

But Aristobul us stirring to make himself strong, Pompey comes up and takes
Jerusalem and Aristobulous also, And theu commits the Priesthood to Hireanus,
and now see the goodly Title of the Romans in the words of Josephus, thus
Hireanus and Arristrbulous through their dissentions and evil broils were the
cause of that servitude and misery [not that voluntary subjection he speaks
of] that fell upon the Jews. For we have lost our liberty and bin subdued by
the Romans. Behold and exellent Title of the Romans. Two Brothers being at
odds, strive one with another, and desire Pompety to be an Umpier of their
controversies, therefore the Romans by this, have a Title to the Crown of
Judaea; or again, the two Brothers being at odds, Pompey comes in to help one
against the other, and conquers him; who (as the Author says) had the worse
Title. Therefore by beating him, he got a good Title to the Romans; just as if
when the Nation desired help of the Scots against a Malignant party, the Scots
prevaling against that party might get a good Title to this whole Kingdom; or
because the Scots desired the Lieutenant General of England, to come for their
assistance into their County against the Malignant party there; he might
thereupon, or thereby have gotten for the English a good Title to Scotland. So
upon the whole, the Romans had no other Title but mere Conquest; as Salon,
and many others do truly affirm, we shall now conclude with the resolution of
an holy, impartial, and reverend Author, and Author of our own above all
exception; as he wrote before these times of exceptions; hear what he says,
concerning the validity of the commands of an usurped Power and the duty of
obeying them.

The fault of the worker is when an action of a lawful calling is done by one
that is not called lawfully, now then when the fault of an action is not in the
work it self, but in the person that works is; it is not to be reputed a
nullity, neither to be reversed as nothing, etc.

This doctrine is agreed upon by the common consent of Divines, as also by the
Laws, and orders, of Kingdoms, as may appear plainly in particular.
Augustus Caesar a Roman Emperor inv^ded the Kingdom of the Jews, and
brought it into a Province: and thus was he made King of the Jews, not by
lawful means, but by intrusion. For all this the Actions done, and the
Commandments given by him, were reputed Commandments of a King, not reversed by
any Jew, but obeyed of all. For when he gave Commandment, that all the world;
yea the Jews should he taxed, they yielded themselves to this Commandment; yea
righteous Joseph, and Mary went to their own Town to be taxed, etc.

Whereby it is manifest that if there be no fault in the work the defective
calling of the worker, does not make a mullity of the Action done. For
howsoever the workers sins, in his unlawful entrance, and in that regard is
not to be approved, yet the Actions in the calling, to which he is en^red, are
the Actions of that calling; For though he be called amiss, yet he stands in
the room of one lawfully called. And we are to make difference betwixt him
that is called, though unlawfully, and him that has no calling at all. For the
Actions done without calling, are indeed nullities, whereas if there be any
calling, though entrance ^e b^dly made, it does not make the Action void. And
whosoever denies this ground of truth over-turneth the Regiments of Kingdoms,
Churches, States, and societies whatsoever.
