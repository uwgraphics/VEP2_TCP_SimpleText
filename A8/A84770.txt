A LETTER FROM His Excellency Sir THO: FAIRFAX, TO The Honorable William
Lenthal Esquire Speaker of the Honorable House of Commons.
SIR,
I Received your Letter, and another enclosed from the Commissioners of
Scotland, expressing their sense of injuries offered to them by some of this
Army; first to my Lord Lauderdail, in denying him access to the King, and next
to Mr. Chiesly, in detaining him at Newcastle in his passage to Scotland; To
both which I thought fit to return this Answer, That no man is more unwilling
to suffer any thing to be done by any under my command, that may be
Dis-satisfaction to that Nation, then my self; nor shall any be more willing to
do all things which tend to keep a right Understanding, and to preserve the
happy Union between the two Kingdoms, then I: But I hope the rudeness of
Soldiers disavowed, will not be made of National reflection, which is all in
the case of the Earl of Lauderdail: And as to that of Mr. Chiesly, I have sent
to the Governor of Newcastle to give him a free passage into Scotland, which, I
hope, is done already; for hearing of it formerly, I sent to him to that
purpose; And shall in all things be ready to observe your Commands, and rest,

Your most humble Servant, T. FAIRFAX.
Kingston, 20 August, 1647.
Die Sabbathi, 21 Augusti, 1647.
ORdered by the Commons assembled in Parliament, That Sir Henry Vane, Sir
Gilbert Gerrard, Sir Robert Pie, and Sir Arthur Haslerig, do communicate this
Letter to the Commissioners of Scotland, and acquaint them from this House with
their Desire and Resolutions of doing all things that may preserve the Union
and good Correspondency between the Two Kingdoms.
