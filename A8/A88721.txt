The last damnable Design of Cromwell and Ireton, and their Junto, or Caball;
intended to be carried on in their General Council of the Army, and by their
Journey-men in the House of Commons, when they have engaged them desperately in
sin, past all hope of retreat by murdering the KING.
MAjor White, a Member of this Army, long since at Putney foretold, That
shortly there would be no other power in England but the power of the Sword:
and Will: Sedgwick in his Book called Justice upon the Armies Remonstrance,
says, the Principle of this Army is, To break the Powers of the Earth to
pieces: and John Lylburne in his Plea for Common Right, page 6. says, The Army
by these extraordinary proceedings, have overturned all the visible Supreme
Authority of this Nation.

That is, They have, and will, by seizing upon the Members of Parliament,
dissolving it, and setting up a new invented Representative, and bring the KING
to capital punishment, and dis-inheriting His Posterity, subvert the
Monarchical Government, and Parliaments of this Kingdom; the Laws and
Liberties of the People, and so by bringing all to Anarchy and Confusion, put
the whole Government of the Land under the Arbitrary power of the Sword.

In order to which they have, and will overturn the Government of the City of
London by a Lord Mayor and Aldermen; and Govern it by Commissioners, and a
schismatic Common Council of Anabaptists, illegally chosen; and deprive
them of their Charter of Incorporation and Franchises; and this shall be a
leading case to all the Corporations of England.

Their next design is, to Plunder, and Dis-arme the City of London, and all
the Country round about; thereby to disable them to rise when the Army removes,
but not to the use of the Soldiers, (although they greedily expect the first
week in February the time appointed) from whom they will redeem the Plunder at
an easy rate; and so sell it in Bulk to the Jews, whom they have lately
admitted to set up their bancks, and magazines of Trade amongst us, contrary to
an Act of Parliament for their banishment; and these shall be their Merchants
to buy off for ready money, (to maintain such wars as their violent proceedings
will inevitably bring upon them) not only all Sequestered, and Plundered goods,
but also the very bodies of Men, Women, and Children, whole Families taken
Prisoners for sale, of whom these Jewish merchants shall keep a constant
traffic with the Turks, Moors, and other Mahometans; the Barbadus, and other
English Plantations being already cloyed with Welsh, Scottish, Colchester, and
other Prisoners imposed by way of sale upon the Adventurers; and this is the
meaning of Hugh Peter's threat to the London Ministers, That if another War
followed, they will spare neither Man, Woman, nor Child: For the better
carrying on of which Design, the said Caball, or Junto, keep a strict
correspondency with Owen Roe Oneal, the bloody Popish Antimonarchicall Rebel
in Ireland, and the Popes Nuntio there. The Antimonarchicall Marquess of
Argyle in Scotland; the Parisian, Norman, and Picarde Rebels in France, and the
Rebel King of Portugal. If danger be not held so close to your eyes that you
cannot discern it, look about you English. But this Kingdom is not to be
saved by men that will save themselves: nothing but a Private hand, and a
Public spirit can redeem it.

FINIS.
