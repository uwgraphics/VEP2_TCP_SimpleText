THE CONFESSION OF FAITH, Of those CHURCHES which are commonly (though falsely)
called ANABAPTISTS; Presented to the view of all that fear GOD, to examine by
the touchstone of the Word of Truth: As likewise for the taking off those
aspersions which are frequently both in Pulpit and Print, (although unjustly)
cast upon them.

ACTS 4. 20. We cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.

ISAI. 8. 20. To the Law and to the testimony, if they speak not according to
this Rule, it is because there is no light in them.

2 COR. 1. 9, 10. But we had the sentence of death in our selves, that we
should not trust in our selves, but in the living God, which raises the dead;
who delivered us from so great a death, and does deliver, in whom we trust
that he will yet deliver.

LONDON, Printed in the year of our Lord, 1644.

TO ALL THAT DESIRE The lifting up of the Name of the LORD JESUS in sincerity,
the poor despised Churches of God in London send greeting, with prayers for
their farther increase in the knowledge of CHRIST JESUS.
WE question not but that it will seem strange to many men, that such as we
are frequently termed to be, lying under that calumny and black brand of
Heretics, and sowers of division as we do, should presume to appear so
publicly as now we have done: But yet notwithstanding we may well say, to
give answer to such, what David said to his brother, when the Lords battle was
a fighting, 1 Samuel 29. 30. Is there not a cause? Surely, if ever people had
cause to speak for the vindication of the truth of Christ in their hands, we
have, that being indeed the maine wheel at this time that sets us aworke; for
had any thing by men been transacted against our persons only, we could
quietly have sitten still, and committed our Cause to him who is a righteous
Judge, who will in the great day judge the secrets of all men's hearts by Jesus
Christ: But being it is not only us, but the Truth professed by us, we
cannot, we dare not but speak; it is no strange thing to any observing man,
what sad changes are laid, not only by the world, that know not God, but also
by those that think themselves much wronged, if they be not looked upon as the
chief Worthies of the Church of God, and Watchmen of the City: But it has
fared with us from them, as from the poor Spouse seeking her Beloved, Cant. 5.
6, 7. They finding us out of that common road-way themselves walk, have smote
us and taken away our veil, that so we may by them be recommended odious in
the eyes of all that behold us, and in the hearts of all that think upon us,
which they have done both in Pulpit and Print, charging us with holding
Free Will, Falling away from grace, denying Original sin, disclaiming of
Magistracy, denying to assist them either in persons or purse in any of their
lawful Commands, doing acts unseemly in the dispensing the Ordinance of
Baptism, not to be named amongst Christians: All which Charges we disclaim
as notoriously untrue, though by reason of these calumnies cast upon us, many
that fear God are discouraged and forestalled in harboring a good thought,
either of us or what we profess; and many that know not God encouraged, if
they can find the place of our meeting, to get together in Clusters to stone
us, as looking upon us as a people holding such things, as that we are not
worthy to live: We have therefore for the clearing of the truth we profess,
that it may be at liberty, though we be in bonds, briefly published a
Confession of our Faith, as desiring all that fear God, seriously to consider
whether (if they compare what we here say and confess in the presence of the
Lord Jesus and his Saints) men have not with their tongues in Pulpit, and pens
in Print, both spoken and written things that are contrary to truth; but we
know our God in his own time will clear our Cause, and lift up his Son to
make him the chief cornerstone, though he has been (or now should be)
rejected of Master Builders. And because it may be conceived, that what is here
published, may be but the Judgment of some one particular Congregation, more
refined then the rest; We do therefore here subscribe it, some of each body
in the name, and by the appointment of seven Congregations, who though we be
distinct in respect of our particular bodies, for convenience sake, being as
many as can well meet together in one place, yet are all one in Communion,
holding Jesus Christ to be our head and Lord; under whose government we desire
alone to walk, in following the Lamb wheresoever he goes; and we believe
the Lord will daily cause truth more to appear in the hearts of his Saints,
and make them ashamed of their folly in the Land of their Nativitie, that so
they may with one shoulder, more study to lift up the Name of the Lord Jesus,
and stand for his appointments and Laws; which is the desires and prayers of
the contemned Churches of Christ in London for all Saints.

THE CONFESSION Of FAITH, of those Churches which are commonly (though falsely)
called ANABAPTISTS.
I.
THat GOD as he is in himself, cannot be comprehended of any but himself, 1 Timothy 6. 16.
dwelling in that inaccessible light, that no eye can attain unto, whom never
man saw, nor can see; that there is but 1 Timothy 2. 5. Ephesians. 4. 4, 5, 6. 1 Cor.
12. 4, 5, 6, 13. John 14. chap.
one God, one Christ, one Spirit, one Faith, one Baptism; 1 Timothy 6. 3. 13, 14.
Gal. 1. 8, 9. 2 Timothy 3. 15.
one Rule of holiness and obedience for all Saints, at all times, in all
places to be observed.

II.
That God is Esa 44. 67. and 43. 11. and 46. 9.
of himself, that is, neither from another, nor of another, nor by another,
nor for another; John 4. 24.
But is a Spirit, who as his being is of himself, so he gives Exodus 3. 14.
being, moving, and preservation to all other things, being in himself
eternal, most holy, every way infinite in Romans 11. 36. Act. 17. 28.
greatness, wisdom, power, justice, goodness, truth, etc. In this Godhead,
there is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit; being every one of them one and
the same God; and therefore not divided, but distinguished one from another by
their several properties; the 1 Cor. 8. 6.
Father being from himself, the Pro. 8. 22, 23. Heb. 1. 3. John 1. 18.
Son of the Father from everlasting, the holy Ioh. 15. 26. Gal. 4. 6.
Spirit proceeding from the Father and the Son.

III.
That God has Esa. 45. 10. Romans 11. 34, 35, 36. Mat. 10 29, 30
decreed in himself from everlasting touching all things, effectually to work
and dispose them Ephesians. 1. 11.
according to the counsel of his own will, to the glory of his Name; in which
decree appears his wisdom, constancy, truth, and faithfulness; Col. 2. 3.
Wisdom is that whereby he contrives all things; Number. 23. 19, 20.
Constancy is that whereby the decree of God remains always immutable; Jere.
10. 10. Romans 3. 4.
Truth is that whereby he declares that alone which he has decreed, and though
his sayings may seem to sound sometimes another thing, yet the sense of them
does always agree with the decree; Esa. 44. 10.
Faithfulness is that whereby he effects that he has decreed, as he has
decreed. And touching his creature man, Ephesians. 1. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. 2 Timothy 1. 9.
Acts 13. 48. Romans 8. 29, 30
God had in Christ before the foundation of the world, according to the good
pleasure of his will, foreordained some men to eternal life through Jesus
Christ, to the praise and glory of his grace, Jude ver. 4. and 6. Romans 9. 11,
12, 13. Prove. 16. 4.
leaving the rest in their sin to their just condemnation, to the praise of
his Justice.

IV.
Genesis 1. chap. Col. 1. 16. Heb. 11. 3. Esa. 45. 12.
In the beginning God made all things very good, created man after his own Genesis
1. 26. 1 Cor. 15. 45, 46. Eccles. 7. 31.
Image and likeness, filling him with all perfection of all natural
excellency and uprightness, free from all sin. Psalm. 49. 20.
But long he abode not in this honor, but by the Genesis 3. 1 4, 5 2 Cor. 11. 3.
subtlety of the Serpent, which Satan used as his instrument, himself with
his Angels having sinned before, and not 2 Pet. 2. 4. Jude ver. 6. Ioh. 8. 44.
kept their first estate, but left their own habitation; first Genesis 3. 1, 2, 6
1 Timothy 2. 14. Eccles. 7. 31. Gal. 3. 22.
Eve, then Adam being seduced did wittingly and willingly fall into
disobedience and transgression of the Commandment of their great Creator, for
the which death came upon all, and reigned over all, so that all since the Fall
are conceived in sin, and brought forth in iniquity, and so by nature
children of wrath, and servants of sin, subjects of Romans 5. 12. 18, 19. and
6. 23. Ephesians. 2. 3. Romans 5. 12.
death, and all other calamities due to sin in this world and for ever, being
considered in the state of nature, without relation to Christ.

V.
All mankind being thus fallen, and become altogether dead in sins and
trespasses, and subject to the eternal wrath of the great God by
transgression; yet the elect, which God has Jer. 31. 2.
loved with an everlasting love, are Genesis 3. 15. Ephesians. 1. 3, 7. and 2, 4, 9. 1 Thessalonians. 5. 9. Acts 13. 38.
redeemed, quickened, and saved, not by themselves, neither by their own works,
lest any man should boast himself, but wholly and only by God of 1 Cor. 1.
30. 31. 2 Cor. 5. 21. Jer. 9. 23, 24.
his free grace and mercy through Jesus Christ, who of God is made unto us
wisdom, righteousness, sanctification and redemption, that as it is written,
He that rejoices, let him rejoice in the Lord.

VI.
Joh. 17. 3. Heb. 5. 9. Jer. 23. 5, 6.
This therefore is life eternal, to know the only true God, and whom he has
sent Jesus Christ. 2 Thessalonians. 1. 8. Joh. 3. 36.
And on the contrary, the Lord will render vengeance in flaming fire to them
that know not God, and obey not the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.

VII.
The Rule of this Knowledge, Faith, and Obedience, Joh. 5. 39. 2 Timothy 3. 15.
16, 17. Col. 21. 18, 23 Matthew. 15. 9.
concerning the worship and service of God, and all other Christian duties, is
not man's inventions, opinions, devices, laws, constitutions, or traditions
unwritten whatsoever, but only the word of God contained in the Canonical
Scriptures.

VIII.
In this written Word God has plainly revealed Acts 3. 22, 23. Heb. 1. 1, 2. 2 Timothy 3. 15, 16, 17. 2 Cor. 1, 20.
whatsoever he has thought needful for us to know, believe, and acknowledge,
touching the Nature and Office of Christ, in whom all the promises are Yea and
Amen to the praise of God.

IX.
Touching the Lord Jesus, of whom Genesis 3. 15. and 22. 18. and 49. 10. Dan. 7.
13. and 9. 24, 25, 26.
Moses and the Prophets wrote, and whom the Apostles preached, is the Prove. 8.
23. Joh.. 1. 1, 2, 3, Col. 1: 1. 15, 16, 17.
Son of God the Father, the brightness of his glory, the engraven form of
his being, God with him and with his holy Spirit, by whom he made the world, by
whom he upholds and governes all the works he has made, who also Gal. 4. 4.
when the fullness of time was come, was made man of a Heb 7. 14. Rev. 5. 5.
with Genesis 49. 9, 10. Romans 1. 3. and 9. 5. Mat. 1. 16. with Luke 3. 23. 26. Heb.
2. 16.
woman, of the Tribe of e Judah, of the seed of Abraham and David, to wit, of
Mary that blessed Virgin, by the holy Spirit coming upon her, and the power of
the most High overshadowing her, and was also Esa. 53. 3, 4, 5 Phil. 2. 8.
in all things like unto us, sin only excepted.

X.
Touching his Office, 2 Timothy 2. 15. Heb 9. 15. Joh. 14. 6.
Jesus Christ only is made the Mediator of the new Covenant, even the
everlasting Covenant of grace between God and Man, to Heb. 1. 2. and 3 1, 2.
and 7. 24. Esa. 9. 6, 7. Acts 5. 31.
be perfectly and fully the Prophet, Priest and King of the Church of God for
evermore.

XI.
Unto this Office he was foreordained from everlasting, by the Prove. 8. 23.
Esa. 42. 6. and 49. 1. 5.
authority of the Father, and in respect of his Manhood, from the womb called
and separated, and Esa. 11. 2, 3, 4, 5. and 61. 1, 2, 3. with Luke 4. 17. 22.
Joh. 1. 14 16. and 3. 34.
anointed also most fully and abundantly with all gifts necessary, God having
without measure poured the Spirit upon him.

XII.
In this Call the Scripture holds forth two special things considerable;
first, the call to the Office; secondly, the Office it self. First, that Heb.
5. 4, 5, 6
none takes this honor but he that is called of God, as was Aaron, so also
Christ, it being an action especially of God the Father, whereby a special
covenant being made, he ordaines his Son to this office: which Covenant is,
that Esa. 53. 10. 11.
Christ should be made a Sacrifice for sin, that he shall see his seed, and
prolong his days, and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand;
which calling therefore contains in it self Esa. 42. 1.
choosing, 1 Pet. 1. 20.
fore-ordaining, Joh. 3. 17. and 9. 27. and 10. 36 Esa. 61. 1.
sending. Choosing respects the end, fore-ordaining the means, sending the
execution it self, Joh. 3. 16. Romans 8. 32.
all of mere grace, without any condition foreseen, either in men, or in
Christ himself.

XIII.
So that this Office to be Mediator, that is, to be Prophet, 1 Timothy 2. 5. Heb.
7. 24. Dan. 7. 14. Act. 4. 12. Luke 1. 33. Ioh. 14. 6.
Priest, and King of the Church of God, is so proper to Christ, as neither in
the whole, nor in any part thereof, it can be transferred from him to any other.

XIV.
This Office it self to which Christ was called, is threefold, of Deuteronomy. 18. 15.
with Acts 3. 22. 23.
a Prophet, of Psalm. 110. 3. Heb. 3. 1. and 4. 14. 15. and 5. 6. and 9. 21.
Priest, and of Psalm. 2. 6.
a King: this number and order of Offices is showed; first, by men's necessities
grievously laboring Acts 26. 18. Col. 1. 3.
under ignorance, by reason whereof they stand in infinite necessity of the
Prophetical office of Christ to relieve them. Secondly, alienation from God,
wherein they stand in need of the Priestly Office to reconcile them: Thirdly,
our e Col. 1. 21: Ephesians. 2. 12.
utter disability to return Cant. 1. 3. Ioh. 6. 44.
to him, by which they stand in need of the power of Christ in his Kingly
Office to assist and govern them.

XV.
Touching the Prophecy of Christ, it is that whereby he has Ioh. 1. 18. and
12. 49. 50. and 15. and 17. 8. Deuteronomy. 18. 15.
perfectly revealed the whole will of God out of the bosom of the Father, that
is needful for his servants to know, believe, and obey; and therefore is
called not only a Prophet and Matthew. 23. 10.
a Doctor, and the Heb. 3. 1.
Apostle of our profession, and the Mal. 3. 1.
Angel of the Covenant; but also the very 1 Cor. 1. 24.
wisdom of God, and Col. 2. 3.
the treasures of wisdom and understanding.

XVI.
That he might be such a Prophet as thereby to be every way complete, it was
necessary that he should be Ioh. 1. 18. and 3. 13.
God, and withal also that he should be man; for unless he had been God, he
could never have perfectly understood the will of God, 1 Cor. 2. 11. 16.
neither had he been able to reveal it throughout all ages; and unless he
had been man, he could not fitly have unfolded it in his Acts 3. 22. with
Deuteronomy. 18. 15. Heb. 1. 1.
own person to man.

XVII.
Touching his Priesthood, Christ Ioh. 17. 19. Heb. 5. 7, 8, 9. and 9. 26. Rom
5. 19. Ephesians. 5. 12. Col. 1. 20.
being consecrated, has appeared once to put away sin by the offering and
sacrifice of himself, and to this end has fully performed and suffered all
those things by which God, through the blood of that his Cross in an
acceptable sacrifice, might reconcile his elect only; Ephesians. 2. 14, 15, 16. Romans
8. 34.
and having broken down the partition wall, and therewith finished and removed
all those Rites, Shadows, and Ceremonies, is now entered within the Veil, into
the Holy of Holiest, that is, to the very Heavens, and presence of God, where
he for ever lives and sits at the right hand of Majesty, appearing before
the face of his Father to make intercession for such as come to the Throne of
Grace by that new and living way; and not that only, but 1 Pet. 2. 5. Ioh. 4.
23. 24.
makes his people a spiritual House, an holy Priesthood, to offer up
spiritual sacrifice acceptable to God through him; neither does the Father
accept, or Christ offer to the Father any other worship or worshippers.

XVIII.
This Priesthood was not legal, or temporary, but according to the order Heb.
7. 17.
of Melchisedec; Heb. 7. 16.
not by a carnal commandment, but by the power of an endless life; Heb. 7.
18, 19, 20, 21.
not by an order that is weak and lame, but stable and perfect; not for a Heb.
7. 24, 25.
time, but for ever, admitting no successor, but perpetual and proper to
Christ, and of him that ever lives. Christ himself was the Priest, Sacrifice
and Altar: he was Heb. 5. 6.
Priest, according to both natures, he was a sacrifice most properly according
to his humane nature: Heb. 10. 10. 1 Pet. 1. 18, 19. Col. 1. 20, 22. Esa. 53.
10. Matthew. 20. 28.
whence in the Scripture it is wont to be attributed to his body, to his blood;
yet the chief force whereby this sacrifice was made effectual, did depend
upon his Act. 20. 28. Romans 8. 3.
divine nature, namely, that the Son of God did offer himself for us: he was
the Heb. 9. 14. and 13. 10, 12, 15. Matthew. 23. 17. Ioh. 17. 19.
Altar properly according to his divine nature, it belonging to the Altar to
sanctify that which is offered upon it, and so it ought to be of greater
dignity then the Sacrifice it self.

XIX.
Touching his Kingdom, 1 Cor. 15. 4. 1 Pet. 3. 21, 22. Matthew. 28. 18, 19, 20.
Luke 24. 51. Acts 1 11. and 5. 30, 31. John 19. 36. Romans 14. 17.
Christ being risen from the dead, ascended into heaven, sat on the right hand
of God the Father, having all power in heaven and earth, given unto him, he
does spiritually govern his Church, exercising his power Mark 1. 27. Heb. 1.
14. John 16. 7, 15.
over all Angels and Men, good and bad, to the preservation and salvation of
the elect, to the overruling and destruction of his enemies, which are the
Reprobates, John 5. 26, 27. Romans 5, 6, 7, 8. and 14. 17. Gal. 5. 22, 23. John
1. 4, 13.
communicating and applying the benefits, virtue, and fruit of his Prophecy
and Priesthood to his elect, namely, to the subduing and taking away of their
sins, to their justification and adoption of Sons, regeneration,
sanctification, preservation and strengthening in all their conflicts against
Satan, the World, the Flesh, and the temptations of them, continually dwelling
in, governing and keeping their hearts in faith and filial fear by his
Spirit, which having John 13. 1. and 10. 28, 29. and 14. 16, 17. Romans 11. 29.
Psalm. 51. 10, 11. Job. 33. 29 30. 2 Cor. 12, 7, 8, 9.
given it, he never takes away from them, but by it still begets and nourishes
in them faith, repentance, love, joy, hope, and all heavenly light in the soul
unto immortality, notwithstanding through our own unbelief, and the
temptations of Satan, the sensible sight of this light and love be clouded and
overwhelmed for the time. Job 1. and 2. Chap. Romans 1. 21. and 2. 4, 5, 6. and
9. 17, 18. Ephesians. 4. 17, 18. 2 Pet. 2. chap.
And on the contrary, ruling in the world over his enemies, Satan, and all the
vessels of wrath, limiting, using, restraining them by his mighty power, as
seems good in his divine wisdom and justice to the execution of his
determinate counsel, delivering them up to a reprobate mind, to be kept
through their own deserts, in darkness and sensuality unto judgment.

XX.
This Kingdom shall be then fully perfected when he 1 Cor. 15. 24, 28. Heb.
9. 28. 2 Thessalonians. 1. 9. 10. 1 Thessalonians. 4. 15, 16, 17. John 17. 21, 26.
shall the second time come in glory to reign amongst his Saints, and to be
admired of all them which do believe, when he shall put down all rule and
authority under his feet, that the glory of the Father may be full and
perfectly manifested in his Son, and the glory of the Father and the Son in
all his members.

XXI.
That Christ Jesus by his death did bring forth salvation and reconciliation
only for the John 15. 13. Romans 8. 32, 33; 34. Romans 5. 11. and 3. 25.
elect, which were those which Joh. 17. 2. with 6, 37.
God the Father gave him; and that the Gospel which is to be preached to all
men as the ground of faith, is, that Matthew. 16. 16. Luke 2. 26. Ioh. 6. 69. and
7. 3. and 20. 31. I John 5. 11.
Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the ever-blessed God, filled with the
perfection of all heavenly and spiritual excellencies, and that salvation is
only and alone to be had through the believing in his Name.

XXII.
That Faith is the Ephesians. 2. 8. Ioh. 6. 29. and 4. 10. Phil. 1. 29. Gal. 5. 22.
gift of God wrought in the hearts of the elect by the Spirit of God, whereby
they come to see, know, and believe the truth of Ioh. 17. 17. Heb. 4. 11, 12.
John 6. 63.
the Scriptures, and not only so, but the excellency of them above all other
writings and things in the world, as they hold forth the glory of God in his
attributes, the excellency of Christ in his nature and offices, and the power
of the fullness of the Spirit in its workings and operations; and thereupon are
enabled to cast the weight of their souls upon this truth thus believed.

XXIII.
Those that have this precious faith wrought in them Matthew. 7. 24, 25. John 13.
1. 1 Pet. 1. 4, 5. 6. Esa. 49. 13, 14, 15, 16.
by the Spirit, can never finally nor totally fall away; and though many
storms and floods do arise and beat against them, yet they shall never be able
to take them off that foundation and rock which by faith they are fastened
upon, but shall be kept by the power of God to salvation, where they shall
enjoy their purchased possession, they being formerly engraven upon the palms
of Gods hands.

XXIV.
That faith is ordinarily Romans 10, 17. 1 Cor. 1. 21.
begot by the preaching of the Gospel, or word of Christ, without respect to
Romans 9. 16.
any power or capacity in the creature, but it is wholly Romans 2. 1, 2. Ezekiel.
16. 6. Romans 3. 12.
passive, being dead in sins and trespasses, does believe, and is converted
by no less power, Romans 1. 16. Ephesians. 1. 19. Col. 2. 12.
then that which raised Christ from the dead.

XXV.
That the tenders of the Gospel to the conversion of sinners, Ioh. 3. 14, 15
and 1. 12. Esa. 55. 1. Ioh. 7. 37.
is absolutely free, no way requiring, as absolutely necessary, any
qualifications, preparations, terrors of the Law, or preceding Ministry of the
Law, but only and alone the naked soul, as a 1 Timothy 1. 15. Romans 4. 5. and 5.
8.
sinner and ungodly to receive Christ, as crucified, dead, and buried, and
risen again, being made Act. 5. 30, 31 and 2. 36. 1 Cor. 1. 22, 23, 24.
a Prince and a Savior for such sinners.

XXVI.
That the same power that converts to faith in Christ, the same power carries
on the 1 Pet. 1. 5. 2 Cor. 12. 9.
soul still through all duties, temptations, conflicts, sufferings, and
continually what ever a Christian is, he is by 1 Cor. 15. 10
grace, and by a constant renewed Phil. 2. 12, 13 Joh. 15. 5. Gal. 2. 19, 20.
operation from God, without which he cannot perform any duty to God, or
undergo any temptations from Satan, the world, or men.

XXVII.
That God the Father, and Son, and Spirit, is one with 1 These. 1. 1. Joh. 14.
10. 20. and 17. 21.
all believers, in their Col. 2. 9, 10. and 1. 19. Joh. 1. 17.
fullness, in Joh. 20. 17. Heb. 2. 11.
relations, Col. 1. 18. Ephesians. 5. 30.
as head and members, Ephesians. 2. 22. 1 Cor. 3. 16, 17
as house and inhabitants, as Esa. 16. 5. 2 Cor. 11. 3.
husband and wife, one with him, as Gal 3. 26.
light and love, and one with him in his inheritance, and in all his Joh. 17.
24.
glory; and that all believers by virtue of this union and oneness with God,
are the adopted sons of God, and heirs with Christ, co-heires and joint
heirs with him of the inheritance of all the promises of this life, and that
which is to come.

XXVIII.
That those which have union with Christ, are justified from all their sins,
past, 1 John 1. 7. Heb. 10. 14. and 9. 26. 2 Cor. 5. 19. Romans 3. 23.
present, and to come, by the blood of Christ; which justification we conceive
to be a gracious and free Acts 13. 38, 39. Romans 5. 1. and 3. 25. 30.
acquittance of a guilty, sinful creature, from all sin by God, through the
satisfaction that Christ has made by his death; and this applied in the
manifestation of it through faith.

That all believers are a holy and 1 Cor. 1. 1. 1 Pet. 2. 9.
sanctified people, and that sanctification is a spiritual grace of the Ephesians.

truth and realitie separated, both in soul and body, from all sin and dead
works, through the Phil. 3. 15.
blood of the everlasting Covenant, whereby he also presses after a heavenly
and Evangelicall perfection, in obedience to all the Commands, Mat. 28. 20.
which Christ as head and King in this new Covenant has prescribed to him.

XXX.
All believers through the knowledge of 2 Cor. 5. 19. Romans 5. 9, 10.
that Justification of life given by the Father, and brought forth by the blood
of Christ, have this as their great privilege of that new Esa. 54. 10. and 26.

off, were brought nigh by Ephesians. 2. 13, 14

passing all understanding, yea, joy in God, through our Lord Jesus Christ, by
Romans 5. 10, 11.
whom we have received the Atonement.

XXXI.
That all believers in the time of this life, are in a continual warfare,
combat, and opposition against sin, Ephesians. 6. 10, 11, 12, 13. 2 Cor. 10. 3.
Rev. 2. 9, 10
self, the world, and the Devil, and liable to all manner of afflictions,
tribulations, and persecutions, and so shall continue until Christ comes in
his Kingdom, being predestined and appointed thereunto; and whatsoever the
Saints, any of them do possess or enjoy of God in this life, is only by
faith.

XXXII.
That the only strength by which the Saints are enabled Joh. 16. 33.
to encounter with all opposition, and to overcome all afflictions,
temptations, persecutions, and trials, is only by Jesus Christ, who is the
Captain of their salvation, Heb. 2. 9, 10.
being made perfect through sufferings, who has engaged his strength to assist
them in all their afflictions, and to uphold them under all their temptations,
and to John 15. 5.
preserve them by his power to his everlasting Kingdom.

XXXIII.
That Christ has here on earth a spiritual Kingdom, which is the Church,
which he has purchased and redeemed to himself, as a peculiar inheritance:
which Church, as it is visible to us, is a company of visible 1 Cor. 1. 2. Ephesians.
1. 1.
Saints, Romans 1. 7. Act. 26. 18. 1 These. 1. 9. 2 Cor. 6. 17. Rev. 18. 18.
called and separated from the world, by the word and Acts 2. 37. with Acts 10.
37.
Spirit of God, to the visible profession of the faith of the Gospel, being
baptized into that faith, and joined to the Lord, and each other, by mutual
agreement, in the practical enjoyment of the Romans 10. 10. Act. 20. 21. Mat. 18.
19. 20. Act. 2. 42. 1 Pet. 2. 5.
Ordinances, commanded by Christ their head and King.

XXXIV.
To this Church he has Mat. 28. 18, 19, 20. 2 Cor. 6. 18.
made his promises, and given the signs of his Covenant, presence, love,
blessing, and protection: here are the fountains and springs of his heavenly
grace continually flowing forth; Esa. 8. 16. 1 Timothy 3. 15. and 4. 16. and 6. 3.
5. Acts 2. 41. 47. Song 4. 12. Gal. 6. 10. Ephesians. 2. 19.
thither ought all men to come, of all estates, that acknowledge him to be
their Prophet, Priest, and King, to be enrolled amongst his household servants,
to be under his heavenly conduct and government, to lead their lives in his
walled sheepfold, and watered garden; to have communion here with the Saints,
that they may be made to be partakers of their inheritance in the Kingdom of
God.

XXXV.
And all his servants are called thither, to present their 1 Cor. 12. 6, 7. 12.
18. Romans 12. 4, 5, 6. 1 Pet. 4. 10. Ephesians. 4. 16. Col. 2. 5. 6. 19. 1 Cor. 12.

bodies and souls, and to bring their gifts God has given them; so being
come, they are here by himself bestowed in their several order, peculiar
place, due use, being fitly compact and knit together, according to the
effectual working of every part, to the edification of it self in love.

XXXVI.
That being thus joined, every Church has Acts 1. 2. and 6. 3. with 15. 22. 25
1 Cor. 16. 3.
power given them from Christ for their better well-being, to choose to
themselves meet persons into the office of Romans 12. 7, 8 and 16. 1. 1 Cor. 12
8. 28 1 Timothy 3. chap. Heb. 13. 7. 1 Pet. 5. 1, 2, 3.
Pastors, Teachers, Elders, Deacons, being qualified according to the Word, as
those which Christ has appointed in his Testament, for the feeding, governing,
serving, and building up of his Church, and that none other have power to
impose them, either these or any other.

XXXVII.
That the Ministers aforesaid, lawfully called by the Heb. 5. 4. Acts 4. 23. 1 Timothy 4. 14. Joh. 10. 3, 4. Acts 20. 28. Romans 12. 7, 8 Heb. 13. 7. 17.
Church, where they are to administer, ought to continue in their calling,
according to Gods Ordinance, and carefully to feed the flock of Christ
committed to them, not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind.

XXXVIII.
That the due maintenance of the Officers aforesaid, 1 Cor. 9. 7. 14. Gal. 6.
6. 1 These. 5. 13. 1 Timothy 5. 17, 18. Phil. 4. 15, 16.
should be the free and voluntary communication of the Church, that according
to Christ's Ordinance, they that preach the Gospel, should live on the Gospel,
and not by constraint to be compelled from the people by a forced Law.

XXXIX.
That Baptism is an Ordinance of the new Testament, Mat. 28. 18, 19 Mark. 16.
16.
given by Christ, to be dispensed only upon persons professing faith, or that
are Disciples, or taught, who upon Acts 2. 37, 38. and 8. 36, 37, 38 and 18. 8.
a profession of faith, ought to be baptized.

XL.
The way and manner of the Mat. 3. 16. Joh. 3. 23. Acts 8. 38.
dispensing of this Ordinance, The word Baptizo, signifying to dip under water,
yet so as with convenient garments both upon the administrator and subject,
with all modesty.
the Scripture holds out to be dipping or plunging the whole body under water:
it being a sign, must answer the thing signified, which are these: first, the
Rev. 1. 5. and 7. 14. with Heb. 10. 22.
washing the whole soul in the blood of Christ: Secondly, that interest the
Saints have in the Romans 6. 3, 4, 5
death, burial, and resurrection; thirdly, together with a 1 Cor. 15. 28, 29.
confirmation of our faith, that as certainly as the body is buried under
water, and rises again, so certainly shall the bodies of the Saints be raised
by the power of Christ, in the day of the resurrection, to reign with Christ.

XLI.
The persons designed by Christ, to dispense this Ordinance, the Esa. 8. 16.
Mat. 28. 16, 17 18, 19. John 4. 1, 2. Acts 20. 7. Mat. 26. 26.
Scriptures hold forth to be a preaching Disciple, it being no where tied to a
particular Church, Officer, or person extraordinarily sent, the Commission
injoyning the administration, being given to them under no other consideration,
but as considered Disciples.

XLII.
Christ has likewise given power to his whole Church Acts 2. 47. Romans 16. 2.
Math. 18. 17. 1 Cor. 5. 4. 2 Cor. 2. 6, 7, 8.
to receive in and cast out, by way of Excommunication, any member; and this
power is given to every particular Congregation, and not one particular person,
either member or Officer, but the whole.

XLIII.
And every particular member of each Church, how Mat. 18. 16, 17, 18. Act. 11.
2, 3. 1 Timothy 5. 19, 20, 21.
excellent, great, or learned soever, ought to be subject to this censure and
judgment of Christ; and the Church ought with great care and tenderness, with
due advice to proceed against her members.

XLIV.
And as Christ for the Acts 20. 27, 28. Heb. 13. 17. 24 Mat. 24. 25. 1 These. 5.
14.
keeping of this Church in holy and orderly Communion, places some special
men over the Church, who by their office are to govern, oversee, visit, watch;
so likewise for the better keeping thereof in all places, by the members, he
has given Mark. 13. 34. 37. Gal. 6. 1. 1 These. 5. 11. Jude ver. 3. 20 Heb. 10.
34, 35 and 12. 15.
authority, and laid duty upon all, to watch over one another.

XLV.
That also such to whom God has given gifts, being 1 Cor. 14. cha. Rom 12. 6.
1 Pet. 4. 10, 11 1 Cor. 12. 7. 1 These. 5. 17, 18, 19.
tried in the Church, may and ought by the appointment of the Congregation, to
prophecy, according to the proportion of faith, and so to teach publicly the
Word of God, for the edification, exhortation, and comfort of the Church.

XLVI.
Thus being rightly gathered, established, and still proceeding Rev. 2. and 3.
Chapters. Acts 15. 12. 1 Cor. 1. 10. Ephesians. 2. 16. and 3. 15. 16. Heb. 10. 25.
Jude verse. 13. Matthew. 18. 17. 1 Cor. 5. 4, 5.
in Christian communion, and obedience of the Gospel of Christ, none ought to
separate for faults and corruptions, which may, and as long as the Church
consists of men subject to failings, will fall out and arise amongst them, even
in true constituted Churches, until they have in due order sought redress
thereof.

XLVII.
And although the particular Congregations be distinct and several Bodies,
every one as a compact and knit City 1 Cor. 4. 17. and 14. 33, 36. and 16. 1.
Matthew. 28. 20. 1 Timothy 3. 15. and 6. 13, 14. Rev. 22. 18. 19. Col. 2. 6, 19. and
4. 16.
in it self; yet are they all to walk by one and the same Rule, and by all
means convenient to have the counsel and help one of another in all needful
affairs of the Church, as members of one body in the common faith under Christ
their only head.

XLVIII.
That a civil Magistracy is an ordinance of God set up Romans 13. 1, 2, 3, 4, 1
Pet. 2. 13. 14. 1 Timothy 2. 2.
by God for the punishment of evil doers, and for the praise of them that do
well; and that in all lawful things commanded by them, subjection ought to be
given by us in the Lord: and that we are to make supplication and prayer for
Kings, and all that are in authority, that under them we may live a peaceable
and quiet life in all godliness and honesty.

XLIX.
The supreme Magistracy of this Kingdom we believe to be the King and
Parliament freely chosen by the Kingdom, and that in all those civil Laws
which have been acted by them, or for the present is or shall be ordained, we
are bound to yield subjection and obedience unto in the Lord, as conceiving our
selves bound to defend both the persons of those thus chosen, and all civil
Laws made by them, with our persons, liberties, and estates, with all that is
called ours, although we should suffer never so much from them in not actively
submitting to some Ecclesiastical Laws, which might be conceived by them to
be their duties to establish, which we for the present could not see, nor our
consciences could submit unto; yet are we bound to yield our persons to their
pleasures.

L.
And if God should provide such a mercy for us, as to incline the Magistrates
hearts so for to tender our consciences, 1 Timothy 2. 2, 3, 4. Psalm. 126. 1. Acts
9. 31.
as that we might be protected by them from wrong, injury, oppression and
molestation, which long we formerly have groaned under by the tyranny and
oppression of the Prelaticall Hierarchy, which God through mercy has made this
present King and Parliament wonderful honorable, as an instrument in his
hand, to throw down; and we thereby have had some breathing time, we shall, we
hope, look at it as a mercy beyond our expectation, and conceive our selves
further engaged for ever to bless God for it.

LI.
But if God withold the Magistrates allowance and furtherance herein; Act 12.
40, 41. and 4. 19, and 5. 28. 29, 41. and 20. 23. 1 Thessalonians. 3. 3. Phil. 1. 27,
28, 29. Dan. 3. 16, 17. and 6, 7, 10, 22, 23.
yet we must notwithstanding proceed together in Christian communion, not
daring to give place to suspend our practice, but to walk in obedience to
Christ in the profession and holding forth this faith before mentioned, even in
the midst of all trialls and afflictions, not accounting our goods, lands,
wives, children, fathers, mothers, brethren, sisters, yea, and our own lives
dear unto us, so we may finish our course with joy: remembering always we ought
to Matthew. 28. 18, 19, 20. 1 Timothy 6. 13, 14, 15. Romans 12. 1, 8. 2 Cor. 14, 37.
2, Tim. 4, 7, 8. Rev. 2. 10. Gal. 2. 4, 5.
obey God rather then men, and grounding upon the commandment, commission and
promise of our Lord and master Jesus Christ, who as he has all power in heaven
and earth, so also has promised, if we keep his commandments which he has
given us, to be with us to the end of the world: and when we have finished our
course, and kept the faith, to give us the crown of righteousness, which is
laid up for all that love his appearing, and to whom we must give an account of
all our actions, no man being able to discharge us of the same.

LII.
And likewise unto all men is to be given whatsoever is Romans 13. 5, 6, 7.
Matthew. 22. 21. Titus 3. 1 Pet. 2. 13. Ephesians. 5. 21, 22. and 6. 1, 9. 1 Pet. 5.
5.
their due; tributes, customs, and all such lawful duties, ought willingly to
be by us paid and performed, our lands, goods, and bodies, to submit to the
Magistrate in the Lord, and the Magistrate every way to be acknowledged,
reverenced, and obeyed, according to godliness; not because of wrath only,
but for conscience sake. And finally, all men so to be esteemed and regarded,
as is due and meet for their place, age, estate and condition.

LII.
And thus we desire to give unto God that which is Matthew. 22. 21. Acts 24. 14,
15, 16. John 5. 28. 2 Cor. 4. 17. 1 Timothy 6. 3, 4, 5. 1 Cor. 15. 58, 59.
Gods, and unto Caesar that which is Cesars, and unto all men that which
belongs unto them, endeavoring our selves to have always a clear conscience
void of offense toward God, and toward man. And if any take this that we have
said, to be heresy, then do we with the Apostle freely confess, that after
the way which they call heresy, worship we the God of our Fathers, believing
all things which are written in the Law and in the Prophets and Apostles,
desiring from our souls to disclaim all heresies and opinions which are not
after Christ, and to be steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of
the Lord, as knowing our labor shall not be in vain in the Lord.

1 COR. 1. 24. Not that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of
your joy: for by faith we stand.
