AN ORDINANCE OF THE Lords and Commons Assembled in Parliament.
WHereas many thousands of the natives and good Subjects of this Kingdom of
England, through the oppression of the Prelates, and other ill affected
Ministers and Officers of State, have of late years to their great grief and
miserable hardship bin enforced to Transplant themselves and their families
into several Islands, and other remote and desolate parts of the West Indies.
and having there through exceeding great labor and industry (with the blessing
of God) obtained for themselves and their families some competent and
convenient means of maintenance and subsistence, so that they are now in a
reasonable well settled and peaceable condition. But fearing least the
outrageous malice of Papists and other ill affected persons should reach unto
them in their poor and low, (but as yet peaceable condition,) and having been
informed, that there has been lately procured from His Majesty several
grants under the great Seal for erecting some new Governors and Commanders
amongst the said Planters in their aforementioned Plantations; Whereupon the
said planters, Adventurers, and Owners of Land in the said foreign
Plantations, have preferred their Petition unto this present Parliament, that
for the better securing of them and their present Estates, there obtained
through so much extreme labor and difficulty, they might have some such
Governors and government as should be approved of and confirmed by the
authority of both Houses of Parliament. Which petition of theirs the Lords and
Commons having taken into consideration, and finding it of great importance
both to the safety and preservation of the aforesaid Natives and Subjects of
this Kingdom, as well from all foreign invasions and oppressions, as from
their own intestine distractions and disturbances, as also much tending to the
honor and advantage of His Majesty's Dominions, have thought fit, and do
hereby Constitute and Ordain Robert Earl of Warwick Governor in chief, and
Lord high Admiral of all those Islands, and other plantations, inhabited,
planted, or belonging to any His Majesty's the King of Englands Subjects, or
which hereafter may be inhabited, planted, or belonging to them, within the
bounds, and upon the coasts of America. And for the more effectual, speedier,
and easier transaction of this so weighty and important a business, which
concerns the wel-being and preservation of so many of the distressed Natives
of this and other His Majesty's Dominions, The Lords and Commons have thought
fit that Philip Earl of Pembrooke, Edward Earl of Manchester, William
Viscount Say and Seal, Phillip Lord Wharton, John Lord Roberts, Members of the
House of Peers, Sir Gilbert Gerard Knight and Baronet, Sir Arthur Heselrigg
Baronet, Sir Henry Vane junior Knight, Sir Benjamin Rudyer Knight, John Pym,
Oliver Cromwell, Dennis Bond, Miles Corbet, Cornelius Holland, Samuel Vassal,
John Rolls, and William Spurstow, Esquire. Members of the House of Commons, shall
be Commissioners to join in aid and assistance with the said Earl of Warwick
chief Governor and Admiral of the said plantations, which chief Governor,
together with the said Commissioners or any four of them, shall hereby have
power and authority to provide for, order, and dispose all things which they
shall from time to time find most fit and advantageous to the wel-governing,
securing, strengthening and preserving of the said Plantations, and chiefly to
the preservation and advancement of the true protestant Religion amongst the
said planters, inhabitants, and the further enlargement and spreading of the
Gospel of Christ amongst those that yet remain there in great and miser^ble
blindness and ignorance. And for the better advancement of this so great a
work, It is hereby further ordained by the said Lords and Commons, That the
aforesaid Governor and Commissioners shall hereby have power and authority
upon all weighty and important occasions which may concern the good and safety
of the aforesaid Planters, to call unto their advice and assistance therein any
other of the aforesaid Planters, Owners of Land, or Inhabitants of the said
Islands and Plantations, which shall then be within twenty miles of the place
where the said Commisioners shall then be; And shall have power and authority
to send for, view, and make use of all such Records, Books, and Papers which
do or may concern any of the said Plantations: And because the well-setling
and establishing of such Officers and Governors as shall be laborious and
faithful in the right governing of all such persons as be resident in or upon
the said Plantations, and due ordering and disposing all such Affairs as
concern the safety and welfare of the same, is of very great advantage to the
public good of all such remote and new Plantations.

It is thereby further Ordained and Decreed, That the said Robert Earl of
Warwick, Governor in chief, and Admiral of the said Plantations, together
with the aforesaid Commiss oners, Philip Earl of Pembroke, Edward Earl of
Manchester, William Viscount Say and Seal, Philip Lord Wharton, John Lord
Roberts, Sir Gilbert Gerard Knight and Baronet, Sir Arthur Heselrigge Baronet,
Sir Henry Vane junior, Knight, Sir Benjamin Rudyer Knight, John Pym, Oliver
Cromwell, Dennis Bond, Miles Corbett, Cornelius Holland, Samuel Vassal, John
Rolls, and William Purstowe, Esquires, or the greater number of them shall have
power and authority from time to time to nominate, appoint, and constitute all
such subordinate Governors, Counselors, Commanders, Officers and Agents as
they shall judge to be best affected, and most fit and serviceable for the said
Islands and Plantations; And shall hereby have power and authority upon the
death or other avoydance of the aforesaid chief Governor and Admiral, or any
the other Commissioners before named, from time to time to nominate and appoint
such other chief Governor and Admiral, or Commissioners, in the place and
room of such as shall so become void. And shall also hereby have power and
authority to remove any of the said subordinate Governors, Counselors,
Commanders, Officers, or Agents, which are, or shall be appointed to Govern,
Council, or Negotiate the public Affairs of the said Plantation, and in
their place and room to appoint such other Officers as they shall judge fit.
And it is hereby ordained, That no subordinate Governors, Counselors,
Commanders, Officers, Agents, Planters, or Inhabitants whatsoever, that are now
resident in or upon the said Islands or Plantations, shall admit or receive any
other new Governors, Counselors, Commanders, Officers, or Agents whatsoever,
but such as shall be allowed and approved of under the Hands and Seals of the
aforesaid chief Governor and high Admiral of the said Plantation, together
with the Hands and Seals of the aforementioned Commissioners, or any six of
them, or under the Hands and Seals of such as they shall authorize thereunto.

And whereas for the better government and security of the said Plantations and
Islands, and the Owners and Inhabitants thereof, there may be just and fit
occasion to assign over some part of the power and authority (granted in this
Ordinance to the chief Governor and Commissioners aforenamed) unto the said
Owners, Inhabitants, or others; It is hereby Ordained, That the said chief
Governor and Commissioners before mentioned, or the greater number of them,
shall hereby be authorized to assign, ratify, and confirm so much of their
aforementioned authority and power, and in such manner, and to such persons as
they shall judge to be fit for the better governing and preserving of the said
Plantations and Islands from open violence and private disturbance and
distractions.

And lastly, That whosoever shall do, execute, or yield obedience to any thing
contained in this Ordinance, shall by virtue hereof be saved harmless and
indempnified.

FINIS.
