CANT. 2.14.15. O my Dove, that art in the Clefts of the rock, in the secret
places of the stairs: let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice, for
thy voice is sweet, and thy countenance is comely.

Take (for) us the Foxes, the little Foxes: which spoil the Vines, for our
Vines have tender grapes.

JUDE 3. Beloved it is needful to write unto you, and to exhort you to
contend, and that earnestly too: for that faith that was once delivered to the
Saints.

To the Christian Reader.
AS Israel departing out of Babell, to repair Zion, were hindered: so now
spiritual Israel departing spiritually from spiritual Babell, to repair and
build up spiritual Zion, are also hindered by such as are called
(Non-Worshippers) and as they built and held weapons too, so must we
spiritually. Of these are three sorts, some deny worship only, some believers
also, and some deny Scripture too. The first sort are most conscientious, but
the last are truest to their principles; for such gifts as they say, must
accompany Administrators, and confirm administrations. Are rather by Scripture
speech to accompany believing, and to confirm the word to be the word A^ Mat.
16.17.20. Heb. 2.4. Mar. 1.27. John 12.37. Therefore that Non-Worshipper that
is not also a Non-Believer, yea that does not by Scripture deny Scripture, is
not true to his principles. And if the first sort (which I have to deal with)
dare own Scripture to be Scripture, and themselves Believers, though they want
gifts, much more hold might they be, to practice this received word, and
declare their faith by obedience, though they want the same gifts.

These I take to be the Foxes specified, Can. 2 15. there is first the speech
of Christ to his people, and therein, Exhortations, and provocations to
worship, verse 14. And then their reply to him, declaring their grievances, in
that the Vines are injured, and their small fruit hindered by little Foxes.
These vines are believers, fruit is obedience, John 15.8. and these Foxes are
such as (what in them lies) hinders the Saints fruitfullnesse as I conceive.

They petition, and so do I, (not to man, but God) that Christ (not the
Woolfe) would take them, and bind them, with the cords of love and pierce them,
(not in the flesh with a sword of steel, but) in the heart with the sword of
the spirit. For the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal, but spiritual, and
mighty through God, to cast down, etc. Acts 2.37. Heb. 4.12. 2 Cor. 10.4.

Their way is to study subtle queries, which pussles, and puts at a stand, the
(weak, but) conscientious people. For it is easy to propound what is hard to
answer, they are subtle, and I simple, they in parts strong, and I weak. But I
have the word on my side, which they have not, and truth fears no cullers, and
I faint not, knowing that God makes babes to praise him, Mat. 21.16. they quote
Scriptures, so do I Let the Reader weigh theirs and mine, and see whose are
suitable to what they are brought for, and whose not. I have covited brevity,
therefore read deliberately, weigh carefully, practice conscionably. Farewell.

Thine in Christ's cause. Thomas Killcop.

SEEKERS SVPPLYED. Or 43. Non-Church queries briefly and plainly answered by
Scripture.
WHether the visible congregated Churches of Christ did, or ever should suffer
defection under Antichrist, from these and other Scriptures. Jer. 10.20. Dan.
8.13. and 9.25. and 11.31. and 12.7.11. Hos. 3.4, 5. Amos 5.13. and 8.12.11.
Mich. 3.6 7. Luke 17.22.23. Joh. 9.4. 1 These. 2.3. 1 Timothy, 3.5. Rev. 11. and
12.6. and 15.8.

Whether the defection, should be total, or in part only?

Luke 19.13. Rev. 2.25. 1 Timothy 6.14. 2 Pet. 1.19.

And a recoverie from this defection, (either in whole or in part) is virtuous,
not vicious. Cant. 1.7, 8. Jude 3. Rev. 2.5.

God may justly, for the abuse of Gifts, Ordinances, or Administrations: take
them away and still withold them?

set childrens teeth an edge, for fathers eating sower grapes. Ezekiel. 18.2, 3, 4.

Whether there has been a restoration, since that defection?

When, and how far this restoration has been?

England) both in doctrine, and practice: thousands can experimentally
testify. Which restoration will be more and more, Cant. 2.12.13.15. Dan.
12.4.9.10. In the mean while we ought to walk by our, rule, so far as we have
attained. Phil. 3 16.

Whether there be any pattern of a true Church under the Gospel that ever was
gathered without Baptism?

Acts 2.41. were added by baptism, which could not be, if the Church they were
added to, were not also baptized, and baptism is the entrance into Christ, (in
respect of order) Gal. 3.27. John 3.5. Romans 6.1, 2.

Whether any people (how godly so ever) may gather and baptize themselves, and
others: unless they have a Commission from Heaven, (as John, the Apostles and
Ananias had) either imediatly, or mediatly, by the visible gifts of the Holy
Spirit? As John 16.33. and 17.18. Math. 28. Acts. 9.10.



For first, never had John, the Apostles, Ananias, nor any other, a Commission
to baptize themselves.

Secondly, (Visible gifts) is not Scripture language, but very improper,
because though the baptism of the Spirit, was sometime visibly seen like a
Dove, or like fiery tongues, Math. 3.16. Acts 2.3. Yet it was not always seen.
For the Jews knew not that the Gentiles had it, tell they heard them speak
with tongues, and magnify God. Acts 10.46. And never was any other gift
visible, no not once, though their effects were visible, as healing the sick,
raising the dead, etc. A knowing man can distinguish betwixt a thing it self,
and the effects it produces.

Thirdly, These gifts (improperly called visible) are not Commissions from
Heaven, nor so called. Fourthly, they fit not for administrator-ship. For John
had a commission from Heaven, and was a lawful Administrator, Mat. 21.25. John
1.33. though he had not these gifts, John 10.41.

And Christ's Disciples, were lawful Administrators, Ioh. 3.22. and 4.1 2.3.
When they had not Apostle ship, nor power to work miracles, nor the baptism
of the spirit, for this Administrator-ship, was before John's imprisonment, John
3.34. or Christ return to Galilee, John 4.3. But after these things; many of
the twelve came to Christ, Mark. 1.14.16.19. and 2.14. and after this, Christ
chose the twelve, from other Disciples: and after this choice, he called them
Apostles, and then gave them power to heal sicknesses, cast out Devils, etc.
Mark. 3.13.14.15. Mat. 10.2. And their baptism with the spirit, was not till
after Christ's assension, Acts 1.4.5. and 2. chap.

Whether John's baptism, and ministry, were not to end when John 3.30. Act.
13.25.

No verily, for first, those places speak no such thing, 2. John began Christ's
Gospel, prepared his way, made his paths straight, Mark, 1.1, 2, 3, 4.

Whether any were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus, or of John's baptism
after the assension?

Yea verily, for these differ not, Acts 1.5. and 10.47.48. and both the
baptism of repentance, for the remission of sins. Mar. 1.4. Acts 2.39.

Whether there be not a baptism for the giving, and receiving of John or
Christ, seeing Philip it seems, could not administer that of the holy spirit,
though he did administer the other. Act. 8.12.15.16.17.

The baptism of water, and the baptism of the holy spirit, Act. 1.5.

Whether the baptism in the Apostles Commission, Mat. 28. Mar. were the
baptism of John, so called, Mat. 3.7. and 21.25. Act. 1.22. and 18.25. and
19.3. or the baptism of Christ, or in the name of the Lord Jesus, so called,
Act. 2.38. and 8.16. and 10.48. and 19.5. or the baptism with, or in the name
of the holy spirit so called, Math. 3.11. and 28.19. Mark. 1.8. Luke 3.16. or
all these baptismes together?

I have proved the two first not to differ, (querie 8.) secondly, the baptism
of the spirit, but of the baptism of water. For it is the disciplising
baptism, and that is that with water, Ioh 4.1.2. compared with Ioh. 3.22.23.
Secondly, it is that baptism to which is annex*t the promise of the spirit.
Mat. 28.20. Mark. 16.17. and that is that with water. Mat. 3.11. Mark. 1.8.
Act. 2.38.

Where is that baptism said to be in the name of the father, son and spirit?

Act. 8.15.16. and 10.47.48. and he (as man) is his fathers deputy, doing and
speaking his fathers will. Heb. 1.1.2. Ioh. 7.29. Therefore what is done in his
name, or in obedience to him, is in the name of, or in obedience to the Trenity
or Godhead, Luke 10.16.

Whether the baptism of Christ, be to be administered with water?

Act. 8.38. and 10.47.48.

Whether the baptism of the spirit be administered with water?

Act. 1.5.

Whether the baptism of John, or the baptism of Christ, in the ministration
with water, be to be administered with these words (in the name of the father?



Whether all that were visibly baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus,
received, or were they visibly baptized, with the holy spirit?

Act. 2.38 39.

Whether ever any particular Churches of Christ, officers, officer, or People
(as by virtue of particular Church priveledges) did, or had power to
administer, either all, or any of the aforesaid baptism?

Act. 8.16, 17, 19.

Whether Elders, Bishops, Pastors or Deacons, had any more power by virtue of
these titles of office, to administer in matters of worship, then any other in
the Church had, or might have: though they were no officers?

John 4.1, 2. Mat. 25.16, 18, 19. Acts 9.10. yet may a Church, I conceive, make
use most usually, of her ablest Members Acts 13.1. with Acts 15.22.35.

Whether the Officers before said, were not only civell?

soul Bishop, or Shepherd, 1 Pet. 2.25. And these are his Deputies, 1 Pet.
5.1, 2, 3, 4. Also the flock and food is spiritual, therefore Pastors also.

Whether the visible presence of Christ, or any other of his visible ministries
or ministrations of worship: were to continue any longer time, then the visible
power and presence of the holy spirit by gifts, which was before told should
accompany them, and was fulfild according to these and other Scriptures, Mat.
3.11. Mark 16.17, 18, 20. John 1.33 and 7.39. and 14.26. and 16 13. Act. 1.25.
and 2.38.43. and 8.16.17. and 11.15.16. and 19.5 6. Heb. 2.3.4.

John 16.7. Secondly, not one of these Scriptures do fore tell that these
gifts should accompany ministries and ministrations of worship. Thirdly, not
one of them affirms such a thing to be fulfild. Fourthly, some of them declare
the word to be confirmed by them, As Mar. 16.20. Heb. 2. But that being
confirmed, and people receiving that for Gods word, they are to submit to it,
without seeing miracles for such as now give nor heed to but neglect it, cannot
escap. Because Christ and others, at first preach it, and God even then bore
witness to it, or to them preaching it, with miracles, and other gifts of the
spirit, as he at that time pleased, Heb. 2.1, 2, 3, 4. These gifts were to
confirm doctrine while it was new, Mar. 1.27. Thus with Moses and the Prophets
so also with Christ.

But now Gods last spokes-man, has already uttered, and confirmed his last
message, Mar. 21.36.37. Heb. 1.1. and 2.3.4. therefore Gods use and end for
miracles, or gifts, termed visible, is null. For whosoever teaches otherwise
now, then what is already taught, is to be accursed, Gal. 1.

Whether the visible gifts of the holy spirit, were not the life, power, etc.
of the visible ministries and ministrations of the Gospel, as much at least as
the holy anointing oil, and the body of Christ was the life of those under
the law?

John and Christ Disciple administered in a Gospel way, when they had not such
gifts. That John was a Gospeller, see further Mat. 11.10.12. Mark 1.12.4. Luke
16.16.

Whether the death of the Visible body of Christ, was not the death of the
visible ministries and ministrations of the Law?

Col. 2.17. Heb. 9.9, 10, 11. and 10 1, 2.

Whether the death of the visible power of Christ, by the ceasing of the
visible gifts of the holy spirit, was not the death of the visible ministries
and ministrations of the Gospel?



Whether it be possible for any man to be a true visible Preacher or Minister
of worship in any other kind, according to Romans 12.6.7. 2 Cor. 12.3, 7. Ephesians.
4.7. 2 Timothy 4.14, 15. 1 Pet. 4.10.11. unless he has received, or been
visiblie baptized with the holy spirit that if way be manifest to sense, that
it is imediatly, or mediatly after a supernatural way from God?



Whether if any can, or at least will pretend to administer in a Gospel way,
visibly (who are dead to it, for want of visible life by gifts) why may not
every one that can and will pretend it?

Psalm. 50.16.17. Secondly, Non-participaters, (though believers) may not, (when
Christ's ways are afoot) for Christ himself would not preach the Gospel, but
first be baptized, to fulfill righteousness, even a righteous order. Mat.
3.15. and 4.23. And Paul though appointed to witness Christ to the Gentiles,
must first be baptized. Acts 22.15, 16. Thirdly, believing women (though
baptized) may not in the Church (by administering) usurp authority. 1 Cor. 14.34
1. Tim. 2.

Whether any believer now living in the world, can truly say he is visibly
baptized with the holy spirit? according to Acts 8 15 16.17. and 10 44.45. and
19.2. and many other places?

Acts 10.45.46. Secondly, every baptized believer (since Christ assention) is,
or shall be, little or much baptized with the holy spirit, or else God keeps
not promise. Acts 2.17, 18.38.39. John 7.38.39 Believers without this, are
without their earnest, and likewise unsealed, Ephesians. 1.13.14. which I doubt the
Querer is.

Whether any believer now living in the world, can show what this particular
gift, or gifts are, and after what manner or form particular gifts are to be
administered, as the gift of knowledge, wisdom, faith, miracles, prophecy,
disearning of spirits, tongues, interpretation of tongues? etc. 1 Cor. 12.8.9.

What the baptism of the spirit, (the Birthright of every called one) is? I
purpose (God assisting) to declare fully, from Acts 19. In a book which I
shall entitle, (A two fold baptism) in the mean while, see the substance of
it, in Acts 2.18. in these words. (On my servants and handmaids, will I pour
my spirit, and they shall prophecy.)

God will pour his spirit on them, (that is the gift) and they shall
prophecy, (that is the effect) they shall be filled with the holy spirit, as a
fountain is filled with water, that is the gift, and the fullness within,
shall bubble forth, that is the effect, as John 7.38, 39. Acts 2.4 The
appearance of fiery tongues, is an overplus in the gift, and the speaking with
tongues, is an overplus in the effect.

Whether any that has a visibile gits, or gifts of the spirit, must not of
necessity know that he has so?

Sampson thought the spirit abode with him, when it was gone. Judge. 16.20.

Whether any that has a visible gift or gifts of the spirit: must not of
necessity administer infallibly, when he administers by them?

Cor. 12.3.

Whether any one that has a visible gift or gifts of the spirit, administering
sometime by them, and sometime beside them, must not of necessity know, when
he administers infallibly by them, and when beside them: As well at least as
any Officer in commission, or any Soldier of, or in any Army, or any Officer,
or member of a civil state; can tell when he administers or acts, according to
his commission, institution, bi^th, priveledges, etc. and when it is not?

Cor. 14.37. Gal. 1 8 9 2 Pet. 1.17.18.19. Secondly, there is a possibillity
for people thus gifted, to be mistaken in this kind. For the Corinthians which
came short in no gift, 1 Cor. 1.5, 6.7. Supposed the spirit taught them to let
women teach in the Church. 1 Cor. 14.35, 36, 37, 38. and the Galatians had
these gifts, and yet that was error, which they took for truth, and they fell
backward, when they thought they went forward, Gal. 3.2, 3.5. and yet all the
Saints, (gifted or not gifted) are in some things infallible. John 21.24. and 1
John 5 18, 19, 20.

Whether any that has a visible gift, or gifts of the spirit, must not of
necessity know, when he administers each several gift?

Iam. 3.13.14, 15. 1 Cor. 8.1, 2, 3.

Whether it be not necessary that the visible gifts of the holy spirit, should
continue in the Church, as long as there is a Church, to distinguish between
christian and antichristian spirits. As in civil affairs, officers and
members of a civil state should have visible commissions, institutions,
birth-priveledges, etc. to distinguish them from false intruders?

miracles deceive all except the Elect. Mat. 24.24. Rev. 13.13, 14, 15.

Cor. 12.

Corinth, was a body or members in particular. A part of the whole as verse 27.
So that this Church wants not members, if ever these gifts were, though
particulars have them not, and whoever now has intrest in the Church general,
has intrest in them gifts. Ioh. 20.30, 31.

Cor. 12 4.5, 8, 9, 11, 13. and 13.8.13.

Cor. 12.4.5. are Christ's administrations of gifts, not our administration of
worship, (a great mistake) I confess that when these gifts cease, our Lord
cease to administer them, and these administrations of gifts, spring not from
a command, as our administrations of worship do, Ioh. 15.14.

Ier. 31.33.34, Ezekiel. 34.11, 12, 13, 14.15. Revel. 12.6.14.

Rev. 12.6. says, they shall feed her. Secondly, your other Scriptures, ate
not fulfilled in this life, for now we know but in part, and see as in a glass
darkly. 1 Cor. 13. But when Christ again appears, then, and not tell then we
shall see him as he is, even face to face, and know as we are known. 1 Cor. 13.
1 John 3.2, 3. and tell then, we are to make use of word and ordinances. 2 Pet.
1.19 1 Cor. 11.26. Rev. 2.





Ezra and the rest, went not about to reform, tell they had a particular
command from God, with power and particular promises of protection, and
success, and strengthened with most sweet and gracious promises?

Former Prophets, typifying ours, and he is the Antytipe of them, Acts 3.22.23.
Heb. 1.1 Secondly, these Prophets gave them not their 1. commission. But (the
work by opposition ceasing) their prophesying did only reincourage them. As is
clear. Ezra 4 24. and 5 1.2. Hag. 1.2.3.

As concerning spiritual gifts brethren, I would not have you ignorant, etc.
Does it not lay an absolute necessity upon every one that will administer in a
Gospel way, to be really possessed with such gifts as also, rightly to understand
them.

every one is to administer, as he has received. 1 Pet 4 10.11. Or he shall be
bound and cast into utter darkness, Mat. 25.30.

in the name of the father son and spirit, that wants power to give the holy
spirit, etc. or at least that has not visibly Gospel life himself by it, for
matter of faith, order, etc.



First, John and Christ's disciples, querie 6 and Philip as you grant, querie 9
administered the baptism of Christ, when they could not conveigh the spirit,
Secondly, the Samaritanes, had visible life touching faith, and order. For they
believed and were bapt^zed. Acts 8 12. or received the word of God, verse 14 and
the Ephesians had visible life touching faith and order. For Paul, (though a
stranger) found them to be believing disciples. Act. 19 1.2. when both the
Samaritanes, and Ephesians, wanted (as yet) your least degree (to wit) the
baptism of the spirit, as Acts 8.16. and 19. 2 6. Which you falsely call
vissible life, etc.



John and others that wanted these gifts, did administer by authority from God
or Christ, John 1.33. Math 21.

Ieroboams calvos, as Gospel is above the law, Christ above Moses, and
spiritual Babell with her plagues, Rev. 18.21. above literal Babell with
hers. Ier. 51.63.6^.

John and others a commission, to set up Idolatry in the highest degree (they
wanting these gifts as aforesaid.) Secondly, if these gifts, be visible power
and commission, then John and others (that had not these gifts) had no visible
commission at all, opposite to John 1.33.

to receive the mark of the Beast, number of his name, and to worship the beast
and his image, and so to be liable to those dreadful plagues, Ier 14.13, 14,
15, 16. and 29.15.16.17, 18. Rev. 14.9 10, 11. etc. read and tremble.



I can prove the neglecters, (much more the opposers) of Gods way of worship,
to be resisters of his counsel, and that against themselves, and liable to be
plagued, Luke 7.30. Math. 12.30. Rev 4.7 12. read and trimble.

Ex. 26.5. Deu. 4.2 and 12.32. Pro. 30.6. Rev. 21.10.

Rev. 14.7.9. Secondly fearers of the Lord, are also worshippers of the Lord
and non-worshippers are non-fearers. Psalm. 2.11. Psalm. 5.7. Rev. 1^.7. and many
more places.

Exodus 25.9.40. and 10.33. Levit. 10. 1, 8. Numb. 16.7. Psalm. 138.2. Ezekiel.
15.6. and 43.8.9.11.12. and many other places, Especially Psalm. 138.2. I will
worship toward thy temple and praise thy name, for thy loving kindness, and
truth, for thou have magnified thy word above all thy names. Does it not
eminently declare the exceeding transcendencie of Gods worship, above all other
his name, works and ordinances whatsoever. And consequently that all the
murders, rapes, oppressions plunderings, blasphemies, or whatever grievious
sins, have been, or shall be committed, are little or nothing in comparison of
this great blasphemy, to wit, abuse of this great and glorious name of God, by
false and will worship.

David, who therefore worshipped toward his holy temple. Psalm. 138.2. Here O
heavens, and witness O earth, (at the great day of Christ) against this
horrible and desperate plundering of this glorious name.

they should wait on the Lord for a restoration and reformation, etc. Eccles.
3.7. Cant. 1.13. and 3.1. and 5.2. Esaias 5.30. and 13.9, 10. and 26.20. and
28.26. and 60.2. Ier. 13.16. and 14.22. Dan. 12.12. Hos. 3.4, 5. Joel 2.2, 10.
Amos 5.13. and 8.9, 10.11. Mich. 3.6.7. and 7.7, 8.14.15. Hab. 2.3. Zeph.
1.4.15. and 3.8.9 Zach. 12.14.17. Math. 24 29. Mar. 15.43. Luke 2.25, Ioh. 9.4.
1 Cor. 1.7, 8. Rev. 8.1.

silence; night; weight, are often in these Scriptures, but not once to
purpose, but each Scripture is horribly abused. First, Solomon's all things, are
all accidents that befall us, his time of silence Eccle. 3.7. is an accidental
silence, as by death, etc. and not an allowed time to be silent Godward. As
Eccles. 12.13. and if the righteous through fear, be altogether thus silent.
As Amos 5.11.13. it is vice, not virtue, to be shund, nor followed as Esaias 62.6,
7. Mal. 3.15, 16, 17. And Christ will not own such hereafter, thus own not him
now. Mark 8.38. John's half hour silence Rev. 8.1 sets forth Gods forbearing;
to plague the ungodly, while the Saints acceptably worship, as verse 2, 3, 4,
5. of this silence in other words, see further, Rev. 7.2, 3. 2 Pet, 3.9, 10.
This night Cant. 1.13. and 3.1. and 5.2. is the whole time before Christ's
second coming, and that time is day time Romans 13.12. Heb. 10.25. 2 These. 2.1,
2, 3. bed is worship, true worship is Christ's, or Gods bed, false worship, is a
Whorish bed and idolatry is whoredom God-vvard, or Christ ward, Esaias 57.7, 8.
There we learn from Cant. 1.13. etc. That night time is bed time, that is the
time before Christ's coming, is the only time of worship. See further, Luke 19,
13. 1 Cor. 11, 26. 1 Timothy 6.13.14. 2 Pet. ^.19. Kevel. 2.25. This night then,
is not night too, but night for worship, and this bed is not a want, but a
joyful enjoyment of Ordinances. Cant. 1.16, 17. And this Waiting, so often
specified, is sometime a waiting for succor from God, as Esaias 25.9. and 26.8.
Mich. 7.7, 8. Zepa. 3.8. sometime for Isreal's consolation, Luk 2.5. Gods
Kingdom, Mark. 15.43. the resurrection or Christ's coming, Dan. 12.12, 13. 1
Cor. 1.7, 8. sometime for rain Ier. 14.22. H^bacuk for a vision, 2.3. the
Jews waited on Zachoriah for the word of God Zach. 11.11.17. Christ's Disciples
by command waited for the promise of the father, to wit the baptism of the
spirit, Act. 1.4. but not one of these Scriptures speaks of a waiting for
worship but this last place has greatest show, and is the special place,
which all seekers, or waiters in general cleave too, from that therefore note.
First, they waited not for ordinances, restaurations, nor reformations of
worship, but for the spirits baptism, Acts 1.4, 5. Secondly, for this they
waited in a way of worship, or in the use of Ordinances, as first baptism,
Acts 1.5. compared with Mark 1.8. Secondly prayer, Acts 1.14. Thirdly,
preaching, verse 16.17.18.19.20. Fourthly, exhortation, v. 21.22. Fifthly,
ordination, v. 23. Sixthly casting of lots, v. 29. and all before this baptism.
Hence note first, that waiting for worship, or use of ordinances, is
Scripture-lesse, and so groundless, secondly, waiting unbaptized with water,
for the baptism of the holy spirit is also groundless yet, horrible
presumption. Acts 2.38. for though the baptism of the spirit preceeded the
other only one time, Acts 10.47. yet the promise ran not so, neither were any
ever taught, so to expect it, but contrariwise, Acts 2.38. Mar. 1.8. Luke 3.16.
John 1.33. I also find in these Scripture, some words not minded in the querie,
of them a word or two, by darkness is meant sometime sorrovv, as Esaias 5.30.
Ier. 13.16. with ver. 14. Zeph. 1.14.15. sometime ignorance, Esaias 60.2. Mich.
3.6.7. sometime litterall darkness Esaias 13.10. Joel 2.10. explained in Math.
24.29. that famine Amos 8. is not now, (if the writings of the Prophets and
Apostles be Gods word) and though the Jews, were and are Kinglesse, Hos. 3
4.5. believers are not nor shall be, Luke 1.32.33. Believers make not have,
Esaias 28.1^. that is, they hasten not to abtain by right or wrong, but expect
the accomplishment of their lawful desires in a lawful way, but they do
hasten to keep Gods commands, Psalm. ^9.60. Acts. 2 41 and ought so to do. Acts
^^.16. Thus briefly I have discovered how horribly these Scriptures are abused,
and how groundless now worship is, if thou art hereby benifitted praise God,
and practice thy light.

FINIS.
