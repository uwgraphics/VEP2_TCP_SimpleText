LONDON, Printed for John Walker, at the sign of the Star in Popes Head
Alley. MDCXLIX.

To the most famous and Illustrious Lords, my Lords the States of Holland and
West-freisland.
NOble and mighty Lords, I present unto your Lordships a little Book; or rather
it presents it self, which though the quantity thereof be very small, yet
being of a great quality, and altogether appropiate unto your Lordships; for it
maintains your command, your Right and Sovereignty. The scope and drift
thereof is to demonstrate and prove, (as it were cursively, and running over
the times past, even from the beginning of this so famous Nation, unto this
very present day) how that the chief Sovereignty of the public affairs, has
ever had place in the principal of the two States, which were then the
Battavers; but now are the Hollanders and the West Freises. The which Soraignty
through a long continual consequent Succession, is now at this present
established in your Lordships.

This Sovereignty and power of the States has been the foundation of the
Commonwealth, the harbor of perfect moderated equity, and the bridle of the
Principalities prodigality.

This power in former times has been a terror, and for fear thereof, even the
chiefest Commanders, and those Regents of the State of the Land, have willingly
submitted their magnifience thereunto; yea, whether they were Kings, or
Generals, or those which in these latest times were called the Earls thereof.

The very Laws and Privileges thereof, which are holy and unviolable, have
likewise also continually been preserved safely in the custody and possession,
and as it were in the bosom of the States.

By the resolutions of their Lordships, is that Liberty, (which in former times
the Hollanders have had, and is now again so far famous) sailed through
those mighty raging tempests, even unto these happy days and times.

For what greater dangers could have happened to any for their Liberty, then that
which has happened unto them? as first, that the Romish power, and afterward
that of the Spanish power, which is the next unto the Romish, or else according
unto their own opinion far greater then the Romish, power it self was.

Yet nevertheless, that Liberty has wrestled and strugled it self through
both of those hideous dangers; and when they were enforced to take Arms, They
first opposed against the violence of their Oppressors, the reasonableness of
their Cause, a good politic Order, and an invincible courage.

The happy event thereof has declared it self at two several times unto the
admiration of all Nations, upon the face of the Earth, and with the War is
the fame and power thereof increased, even as it pleases the wisdom of God,
commonly first to prove and assay those with great travels and dangers, whom
he will afterward advance to great honors.

Under the condition of those same Lords and Governors, has ever appeared
that great fidelity of the Battavers, which was never less then the
valiantness of their deeds in War; which fidelity the Romans can
sufficiently testify of, in the times of your Lordships Predecessors: And the
Neighboring Kings do now acknowledge the same in your Lordships: And not only
they, but also even those which are our Antipodes, and which behold another
Firmament and Stars.

The recitation of all which things according unto their deserts, would be
matter for the furnishing of a great History.

It may suffice for this present, shortly and summarily to relate the Antiquity
of this Government which happened under the Government of the Nobles or States,
the labor whereof I doubt not but it will be profitable for the Inhabitants,
and very acceptable unto Strangers; for although it be very true, that which in
old time was reported of Alcibiades and also Augustus, which is, That a good
Subject is bound to defend the present estate of the Commonwealth, and to seek
for no Alteration* Yet nevertheless, we desire and more earnestly affect such
a kind of Government, as we our selves enjoy, and besides we perceive has
been pleasing to our forefathers, whether it be as the best in it self, or
whether it be that which is most convenient for them, the which our Fathers
have maintained and defended even with their dearest lives, having left the
same as their own proper inheritance unto their succeeding posterity.

Hereunto may also be added, that in all matters Antiquity is much respected,
and of great worth; yea, so much esteemed, that they of Marseilles, whose
Commonwealth is anciently reported to be so exceeding famous, and for which
they are so highly commended, that they even from the first foundation of that
City, have themselves used the sword for the execution of Justice upon
Malefactors; showing thereby, that also even in the smallest matters, all the
least points of Ancient Custom ought to be maintained: for Antiquity in some
respects comes nearest unto God, by way of resemblance that it has with
Eternity.

From whence also it proceeds, that in our hearts, there is bred a
reverentnesse and respect unto Antiquity; which Antiquity in the Commonwealth
ought much more to be had in estimation, rather then in the persons of men, in
regard that in the persons of men, which are mortal, their Antiquity or
Antientnesse is a sign of their approaching Death: But Antiquity in the
Commonwealth being once settled and grounded upon hope of never to die, does
beget from time her virtue and force, and becomes the more old the more able;
for continuance is an infallible demonstration of a well framed policy: from
hence proceeds an assurance and affection unto the Government, even from the
very hearts of the Inhabitants. And this is the very principal occasion of the
continuance and standing of a Commonwealth, because that in former times it so
continued.

It was also reason that I had some respect unto Strangers, to the end that
those which are exceeding desirous to be informed of the state of this
Commonwealth, by reason of the greatness of those famous Acts achieved by
the same, might not only know the estate thereof as it is at this present, but
also in what estate the same has been in times past.

Also taking away an abuse which oftentimes proceeds from names that are
alike, in matters that are differing; for the Princes themselves were not
always alike, nor yet the States neither; for sometimes the Chief Power and
Sovereignty was in the person of one man; but then the counsel and advice for
the effecting of businesses was in the persons of many. At other times the
Soveraigntie was in many, but the Administration in the person of one man. At
some times the Laws were subject to the Prince; at other times the Prince
subject to the Laws: All which, if a man will deliberately ponder, he shall
easily find, that that Commonwealth which is at this present among us, has not
had its beginning now of late, but that the very same Commonwealth that in
former times has been, is now made more manifest, and appears more clear
and evidenter then ever before. For like as a house may continue standing
though some parts thereof be altered and changed: but if the foundation be
overthrown, it cannot continue standing; Even so, the altering and changing of
names and Offices of some Magistrates, does not make presently another
Commonwealth, in regard that the principal Power and Sovereignty, and as it
were the very soul of that whole body which has its being, moves and keeps
together, and does remain and continue one and the very self-same.

It remains then, (Noble and most worthy Lords) that we pray unto the Lord
God, who is the establisher and maintainer of this State, That it will please
him to defend and maintain that Liberty, the which is not so much defended by
your especial providence, and the worthy valor of the Burgesses and Soldiers,
as it has been hitherto, and is yet defended by his heavenly assistance, and
may yet extend it self for many years to come; and GOD grant, that it may
continue among us, and be made our own, even all these blessings that we now
at this present do enjoy; but before all things grant us as an assured pledge
of the common Tranquillity, Piety, Equity, and Unity; thus prays he who is

Your Lordships Servant, THO. WOODS.

A TREATISE OF The Antiquity of the Commonwealth of the Battavers, which is
now the Hollanders.
The first Chapter. What a Principality is in a Government of Nobles; And what
they be that are called States.
ALI Nations are governed, either by the Common People, or else by the Nobles,
or else by one Man only. The Government of the Nobles is either with a
Principality, or else without a Principality: I call that a Principality, which
is a more excellent and eminent Authority in the person of one man only, being
limited by the Power and Laws of others: By which marks this is different from
that which is called properly a Regal Authority. And for this occasion, it is
that Tacitus makes mention, how that Piso had reported of Germanicus, that he
was the son of a Prince of the Romans, and not of a King of the Parthians.
And Suetonius reports of Caligula, that it wanted but a very little, but that
he had transformed the shape or frame of the Principality into a Regal
Authority; even as Caesar also reports of the Father of Vercingetorix, that
he being a Prince of the Walloons, for diverse Considerations suing to have
brought the same to a Regal Authority, was made away by the Burgesses. And
Pliny speaking of Trajan, reports that he possessed the Seat of the Prince,
because that there should be no place for a Lord: Yet nevertheless, the
Principality being improperly spoken, is called a Regal Authority. And in like
manner (says Aristotle) it was in the days of the Worthies, that the Regal
Authority had his original beginning, and that when as the People having
gotten and received any exceeding great benifit from them, their Parents or
Ancestors, as for example; By whom they had gotten and obtained good Laws, or
by whom in time of War they were protected and defended, them they gave the
full Authority of the War, with the power of judging of the Affairs: which
Regal Authority he reports to be over them that voluntarily consented
thereunto, and were also limited with Laws: The same also reports
Thucidides, that amongst the Greeks the Authority of the Kings is the most
Ancient, the which descended from the Parents unto the Children by Succession,
being clad with certain Titles of Honor.

From whence then appears, that in the Government of the Nobles, the
Principalities were distributed according to the order of the kindred; from
whence we have an excellent example from them of Lacedemonia: Moreover, the
Nobles in whom the Sovereignty consists, do give their voices* either each
of them apart, like as the Venetians do, or else in the behalf of any Society;
which Societies are either of one, or else of diverse sorts: Those that were of
one sort, were like unto those of Achaia, whose Convocation consisted of the
Deputies of the Cities. The other which were of diverse sorts, were of the
Burgesses, and of the Societies consisting of the Burgesses, arising from the
diversities of the Qualities, according, unto the which, some of them were
ordained to the Government, some by one means, and some by an other means:
And for this occasion, those same Qualities; and also those Societies
themselves were called by the Latins, Ordines; which in Common Language we do
usually call the States: Which States Hippodamus made of three sorts, as, of
the Artificers, the Husbandmen, and the Soldiers. Plato made, the Survayers,
the Soldiers, and the Husbandmen: The Egyptians made the Priests, the
Soldiers, and the Tradesmen: The old Walloons made, the Druides, the Horsemen,
and the common People. So that oftentimes the Nobles then were different, and
apart, in respect of the States: Those that have then the chief sway in the
Government, we call a Government of States: Like as at this present in
Germany, where the chiefest sway consists together in the Princes Electors,
the Princes and the Cities. If in case then that this Authority of the Nobles,
being united together with the States, whereunto also appertained a lawful
Principality, then such a Government must be esteemed for the most choice and
best tempered Government. For, since in all matters mediocrity is most
commended; and that mediocrity is nominated sometimes from that which is
separated from both the Ends, and sometimes from that which is partaking of
both the Ends; so that then it appears, that this Government in such manner,
is placed between the Regal Authority, and the Authority of the Common People;
so that it avoideth the evils of both of them, and draws unto it self from,
them all which is good after it. For first of all, since that it tolerateth not
all things, neither only one man to govern, which is subject to many errors,
not yet the Common People who are ignorant; so that by this means without all
doubt much danger is avoided.

Again, in regard that a Regal Authority is commended, in respect of the
exceeding Majesty and Dignity thereof: And the Authority of the Common People
commended, in respect of the equal Liberty: Yet the Government of the Nobles,
obtains that exceeding Majesty and Dignity by the Principality; and also
gives as much equal Liberty as is convenient, when as they (unto every one
that shall endeavor himself thereunto, of what state soever he be, by his
good parts and demeanors, and by making themselves a fortune thereunto) do
bestow upon such, both the highest Offices, and also the partnership of the
Sovereign Authority.

This then being set down as a Preface, to the end, that that which follows
and shall be spoken hereafter, be not mangled and spoiled; there remains
now, that we diligently make enquiry, in what state the Government of the
Battavers has been, even from the very beginning of this Commonwealth, to
this very present.

And in the doing whereof, if in case my arguments be not so absolutely
perfect, as if I were in handling the History of the Grecians, or of the
Romans: yet let no man marvel thereat, since that the ancientest Antiquities
of the Germans are not known unto us no otherwise, but by the Writings of the
Romans, who took very little care in the Registring of the Affairs of
Strangers: And that also even after the fall of the Roman Empire, the Acts of
our Nation, like as also the greatest part of all others, of those times, are
so exceeding obscure, and also very many of them so involved in many untruths
and mear fables: And also that for a long time after, and even until now, very
lately, is there risen up but few of good understanding that have endeavored to
propagate the Fame of the Acts of the proceedings unto Posterity: Especially,
also, because that for a long time, the very Charters and Records do make no
report of any thing unto us: And for this occasion, the Reader must take in
good part, and be content with that rough hewn and unpollished portraiture of
the Government that is described; and not expect a perfect, curious, and
polished representation thereof: and must do in this, that which a Judge ought
to do in matters that exceed memory; as namely, that he shall not so curiously
and precisely urge testimony from every moment of time to time, but the
beginning and the end being proved, he must imagine with himself, that the
time betwixt both was conformed unto the ends, if the contrary do not appear.

The second Chapter. In what Estate the Commonwealth of the Battavers, was at
the Original beginning of this People.
IT is then certain, that the Battavers, which before were a part of the people
then called Catches, which now are called Hessens, as Tacitus testifies; As
also, the coherence of the names of the Battavers with the Hessens, and the
names of the Catches with the Battavers, is an infallible mark and token
thereof: And that long before the time of Julius Caesar, yea, peradventure some
hundred years before, they being removed and come unto the place which they now
inhabit, that is, into an Island which was environed about with the great Sea,
and the River Ryne; and the next place unto their shore upon this side of the
Ryne, was that which is called the River Wall, or the Belgian border: And that
then these places (as Tacitus reports) being unhabited, and then by them
taken in and possessed, appertained most justly and rightly unto them,
according to the most reasonable Law of Nature, even like as those goods which
have no Possessors, do properly appertain unto those which are the first
Possessors thereof. So is this then the very first and absolute perfect
beginning of a free Government, as being established by a people of a free
original beginning in a free Land.

What manner of Government they then used, Strabo shows, who says, that the
Celtes were altogether addicted to the Government of the Nobles; for when as the
Greeks call them Celies, they comprehend therein as well the Walloons, which
were then Neighbors unto the Battavers, as the Germans, whereof the Battavers
were the most famous, if we will credit Tacitus and Plinius. And as concerning
the Walloons, Ambiorix shows what manner of Government they had before the
Conquest of the Romans, where he says, That the command of the Prince in that
place was such, that the multitude had no less sway over him, then he had over
the Multitude; now in this place, the word multitude is not to be understood
for the base Commonalty, but for the assembly of the choycest of each Nation;
even as we find many Examples thereof in Caesar: and Caesar himself shows,
where he says, that the Common People amongst the Walloons were of no respect
nor account, and that they were never admitted to come into any Council; but
that all their Authority was in their Druides and Horsemen. That also the
Germans from all Antiquity, did not live under the Authority of one only
person, but of many persons. Tacitus shows the same in that place, where he
speaks of the Ancient Warlike Expeditions of the Germans; saying, That the
Germans were more furious, and more earnest to maintain their own Liberty then
the Kings of the Parthians were.

And Lucanus makes mention of them, they complaining after this manner, in
these words:

Our Liberty is gone,
So far out of our hands;
And got beyond the Doane,
Into the over Rynish Lands:
And though we seek it should,
And hazard life and blood:
The Dutch, and Tartar bold,
Do keep it as their good.
Whereafter also this followed:

Much People now abroad,
That for themselves make Kings;
But we have got a load,
Our Liberty that stings.
In which places, what is meant by this word Liberty; the proper exposition of
the word King or Regal Authority does sufficiently express, as that which is
opposite unto Liberty: like as the Annals in the beginning do affirm, saying,
The City of Rome at the first beginning, was governed by Kings; But Lucius
Brutus brought in both Liberty and Consulship.

And like as these things generally did concern the Germans, even so Civilis,
who was a Battaver himself, does approve that only these did properly
appertain to the Battavers: And in his Oration which he made, exhorting the
Walloons to their Liberty, viz. where he said, Let them of Syria, and Asia,
and the Easterlings be in subjection, which are accustomed unto Kings; whereby
he shows sufficiently, and gave them to understand, That like as the
Easterlings are much addicted to have Kings, that by that means the Battavers
might have a loathing of such a manner of Government. Yet some men may think
that this contradicts that same which is spoken of Civilis in another place,
who was himself of the Royal blood. Whereunto may be added, that which Strabo
reports of one Veromerus, who had been a King of the Battavers, like as also
Ammianus Marcellinus, who also makes mention of other Kings of the Battavers.

There is nothing more certain, but that these Kings, such as the Lacedaemonians
had, only Kings in Name, not in very deed, were no other but the chiefest
amongst their Nobles. This Tacitus plainly proves, where he says, That the
Germane Kings had not a free and unlimited power; and says further, that in
their Convocations they were heard more with Authority to Counsel, then with
power to Command. In like manner speaking of the Frieses who were an Ancient
Neighboring Nation of the Battavers, when he had said that they had Verritum
and Malorigem to their Kings, added very discreetly thereunto, for as much as
the Germans were governed after a Kingly manner. Also where he describes the
Goaths, he says, That they were governed more near unto a Kingly manner, then
all the other Nations of the Germans; Yet nevertheless, not exceeding their
Liberty: And showing that they of Sweathen having altogether another nature of
Government, otherwise then the Germans have, he says, So that one man only
has the Authority over them without any exception, and that they, Volens,
Nolens, must obey him.

And also the Germans had not all of them, nor yet at all times, such like
Kings, but sometimes only Generals. Tacitus makes a plain and evident
difference between these two, saying, That they made them Kings that were of
the highest descent of the Nobility; but the Generals, according to their
valor and virtue. Caesar also says, that the Germans in the time of peace,
had no common General; but that they were chosen, that should be their
Generals in War after such a manner, that their Authority had the Power of
punishing with life and death: So that sometimes (though seldom) there have
been Kings, but oftentimes Generals, the which were chosen for every
expedition; like as Civilis himself was chosen by the Battavers; and before his
time Cariovalda, and afterward others.

The Authority of the Generals was of no force, but in the Wars; But the
Authority of the Kings had a farther extent, of rather was herein greater, that
it still continued: And yet each and both of these Authorities were neither of
them infinite nor unlimited; from whence follows necessarily, that they were
both of them bound in with certain limits and restrictions.

This limitation proceeded either from the Law, or from some other Authority:
The Law has his certain exceptions, as Tacitus so calls it; but the Authority
of many joined thereunto, does make that that one has his Authority only by
toleration, and not by his own right.

The Laws were not contained in writings, but were kept and maintained (as
being holy) by memory and custom, like as it was accustomed among the
Lacedaemonians.

Now in what manner, or how far, or after what sort, those Limitations of the
Battavers did extend in Limiting the Authority of their Kings and Generals, it
would be very heard to repeat: Yet it is credible, that the very same was not
much different from that which hereafter in the sequel we shall hear, was
used in the days of the Earls, the which but of late years was begun to be
registered. And to produce proofs, that the Battavers descended from the
Hessens, which was the most provident Nation of the Germans; and who did excel
in the knowledge of commanding and obeying; which Tacitus affirms in these
words, saying, They set over them, him, whom they had elected, and obeyed him
whom they had ordained.

Moreover, I never heard or found, that any one Nation either in private or
public matters, did so constantly hold and stick together in maintaining the
Laws and Customs of their Ancestors, in such sort that it may justly be said
of them, That good Customs were of greater force there amongst them, then in
other places good Laws were unto others: For example thereof, take the Custom
of the Hessens, when as they did wear the hair of their heads and beards so
long, and binding themselves with an Oath, not to change the deformity thereof,
before they had overthrown their Enemies. For the remembrance and performance
of which Custom, take Civilis himself who was a Battaver, as Tacitus says,
who first cut of his long golden yellow colored hair, when as he had defeated
the Legions: And it is manifest, that there have been such in the beginning of
these last Wars which lately ended, that used the very same, maintaining the
Custom in that particular, which they had from their Ancestors.

Tacitus says, that their Companies and Squadrons were not erected and made by
Chance, as taking whom they could get, but it was by kindreds of Consanguinity,
and Alliance. There is yet to be found in many Cities of the Battavers, even
in these days, such Companies and Squadrons, consisting of Friends and
Neighbors, being a Custom exceeding all memory.

By the old Germans, the women as soon as they were married, were exhorted and
instructed, that they were come thither to be as Companion to their Husbands,
in all pains, and in all dangers; and that she must endure and suffer all
things with her Husband, whatsoever happened, whether it were in time of Peace
or War: from hence it proceeds that the Battavers, even to this very
present day, do hold their goods common between bed-fellows, that is man and
wife.

They do make their drink of Malt, which is made of Corn, very like unto Wine:
They do wear very straight Clothes girded to their loins.

They do make their habitations in the fields; and every man his own
Possession hedged in, which are altogether old tokens of the Germans.

That which Tacitus reports of those deadly feuds, which were once begun
amongst any of the kindreds by any other, that the reconciliation was to be
made even unto that whole kindred: And that the parties were to be reconciled
sitting and eating togegether at one Table; and that one part of the
Reconciliation-money should be paid to their Lords, or put into the common
Purse, and the other part should be paid unto him that was injured, or unto
his friends. Which Customs have been continued, and yet still do continue,
excepting that above a hundred, or two hundred years since, those deadly feuds
which were amongst the kindreds, were prosecuted more furiously and more openly.

Tacitus says, that amongst this People was a Custom, That every man for his
own part, man for man, brought some of their own Cattle unto their Prince,
which he received of them as a gratuity, keeping the same for his proper use,
from hence did the Tithes proceed.

Lastly, their manner of choosing their Generals, is expressed by the example of
the Kennemers, who being a part of the Battavers, did after this manner elect
one Brinio, being very nobly, descended for their General; as namely, They set
him upon a Shield, and according to the Custom of their Nation, as Tacitus
says, They lifted him up, and carried him upon their shoulders. That the very
same manner continued amongst the Battavers and their Neighboring Nations,
even until the days of the Earls, appears in many old pieces, which do
manifestly testify, that before the Battle which happened between the Freises
and Earl William, the last of the House of Henault: that there was a
Convocation held; and the Freises did this reverence unto their Earl: four of
the chief of the Nobles of the Freises, did set their Earl upon a Shield, and
so carried him upon their shoulders, and proclaimed, saying: This is the
Magnificence of Friesland.

The reasons wherefore that these old Customs were so strictly maintained by
these People, as well in particular, as also in public matters, which tend
more to an outward show, then to any powerful effect of Government; I could
easily persuade my self, that even of old time, they have had such Laws
concerning the Government, as the Custom of succeeding times has declared.

Yet must we make enquiry, in whom was this highest power or Sovereignty,
besides in the Kings and Generals. I find that by the Germans, excepting the
Clergy, that there was two sorts of States amongst them, viz. the Princes, and
the Comonalty; now when I speak of Princes, I do not understand, nor mean
those, that each of them had their Authority over a whole Nation; like as that
name is commonly used, for such Princes were the Kings and the Generals
themselves, whereof we have already spoken: But they were such, as that each of
them took care for one part of the Nation, which parts being great, were called
Quarters, and being little, were called Villages; of which Caesar thus
speaks, They have no common Magistrate, but the Princes of the Countries, and
of the Quarters, do minister Justice unto them which are under them, and do
decide the Controversies. Tacitus says, that those Princes do minister
Justice, both in the Quarters and in the Villages. Tacitus also shows unto
us, that those Princes were usually chosen, where he says, In that Convocation
were also the Princes chosen: But they went so to work, that ever after they
had regard unto those that were nobly born, and of the choycest of the
Nobility, or rather, the meritorious deeds of their Predecessors being applied
even to their young Youths, did afford them that worthiness to be Princes.
From whence I believe is come, that those Jurisdictions, both of Quarters and
Villages, having long continued in the Houses of the Nobility, are at last
become hereditary: By reason whereof, those Princes by the worthiness of their
Offices; their ensuing Posterity afterward were those which were called
Barrons and Nobles: yet the Government was not so much in their persons, that
the Common People were held as Slaves, like as the Walloons were in the time of
Caesar: But unto each Prince, (as Tacitus testifies) were adjoined a hundred
men, which were chosen out of the Comonalty, to be as their Companions, serving
for Counsel and Estimation.

Those were the Princes that Caesar reports, who together with the Officers,
divided the Lands into Portions and Pastures: So then were those same Regions
governed partly by those which were chosen out of the Common People, and partly
by those Princes of each Commonwealth. And they in this manner governed each
of them their Quarters, having (being altogether,) the Sovereignty of the whole
Commonwealth, and that by a form of Convocation. Tacitus says, that of all
the small matters, the Princes did consult upon, but the great Affairs were
dispatched by the Princes in general; yet in such a manner, that whatsoever
was decreed by the general Princes, the Comonalty was acquainted withal. He
says, that the Convocations of the Germans was of two sorts, whereof the one
was little, in the which, the daily Affairs which often happened, were decided,
and this Convocation consisted only of the Princes: And the other was greater,
in whom was the power of deciding even of the most highest and weightiest
Affairs; and this consisted of both the States: For whereas Tacitus says (in
general) that same is not so to be understood, as if every one should come
thither, like as it usually happened upon the Assemblies of the Romans, in such
manner, that every man should leave his house and home; for such could not
conveniently be amongst so great a popularity; especially, like as the
Battavers were, among whom Pliny reckons up seven Nations, as, the Battavers,
which were properly so called, the Kennemers, the little Freises, the
Friesiabonds, the little Cauches, the Tusians, and the Marsacians: Now these
altogether were called the Convocation it self, whereunto some persons were
sent from each Region and State.

Tacitus expounds that same, where he speaking of the Semnomes, says, that
all the people of one descent assembled together at appointed times, by those
that were deputed thereunto, in a wood, the which was sanctified by the old
Devotion and Prophecies of their Ancestors. And of the Germans in general,
he says thus, that they assembled upon certain days, unless that
accidentally any thing happened which required haste, and was some
extraordinary matter. And there after he says thus, This abuse proceeded of
their liberty, that they did not assemble altogether, nor yet when as they were
commanded or warned; but oftentimes they let pass two or three days before
they did assemble; so that then the Sovereignty was in the persons of this
Assembly of both the Estates: whereupon he says thus, Before this Assembly,
was any man to be accused and challenged upon life and death. Again he says,
In this same Assembly the Princes were elected, and also those hundred men
which were chosen out of the Commons, and adjoined as companions unto them. The
Kings themselves and the Generals were heard in this Assembly, (as is before
said) more with Authority to counsel, then with any power to command. And
although this was common unto all the Germans, and not appertaining unto the
Battavers, as being not able to attain thereunto; Yet the History of Civilis
approves that the Battavers had this manner of Government, to the end that the
wars might orderly be decreed against the oppression of the Romans; for that
end (says he) he assembled together the Princes of the Nations, and the
ablest of the common people. Wherein appears then that the Battavers used the
government of Nobles, and yet in such sort, that there was a Principality
annexed thereunto, which was either continually under the name of a King, or
temporally under the name of a General: That also the Nobles were of two
sorts, that is, of the Princes, the which were called the first and the
greatest: and those that were elected out of the Common people; these two being
conjoyntly in the Assembly, had the Sovereignty of the public matters; but in
regard that this same Assembly did seldom meet, the matters were commonly
dispatched by the Kings, according to the advice of the Princes.

That also the Government of each quarter was in such manner in each of these
Princes which had their own Jurisdiction, as in those Magistrates which were
chosen out of the second State; the which in such a wonderful musical consort
does express that Government which Plato so much commends, in which the
Nobles together with the mutual agreement of the Common People, had the
Sovereignty: Yet this must be added hereunto, That in one matter the Battavers
do seem to differ from other Germans; as namely, That the Germans dwelt all
in open Villages, and had no fenced Cities nor walled Towns: On the contrary
part, it is apparent, that the Battavers, (as soon as they had Possessed the
Island) made fenced Cities, to the end, that they (not like as other People)
might settle their abode for a short time, but to continue and that in one
place: whereof Tacitus says, because of the convenient and easy access
thereunto for all commodities, which abundantly might be brought in thither.

For first of all, the great Sea opened a free passage for their trafficque
into Great Britain, and to the Seacoasts of Germany. And secondly, the Ryne,
the Maes, and Scheld opened them passages for trafficque into the heart of
Germany, and to a great part of the Walloones Country. Adding hereunto, that
in the time of Julius Caesar there were very many walled Towns in the
Walloones Country, which was a near neighboring example for the Battavers.
Moreover the nethermost part of the Island gives sufficient testimony thereof,
which was called Lugdunum Battavorum, which now is called Leyden, and the
higher quarter called Battavodurum, which is now called Wyckterduerstede, being
both the old names of famous fenced Cities, besides some other lesser Cities,
as Grinnes, Vada, Aranacum* and other, whereof Tacitus and Pentingerus in their
Maps do make mention.

All which if it be so, it is manifestly apparent, that like as these fenced
Cities could not consist without Magistrates, that those Magistrates next unto
the Princes had very great Authority in their public Assemblies: And that the
simple common people busied themselves, some with tilling of the Land, others
with feeding of Cattle, and others with fishing, and with Merchandise, and
other occupations belonging thereunto, that they very willingly committed the
charge of the Government unto the Magistrates, whereof we now have spoken.

The third Chapter. In what estate the Commonwealth of the Battavers was in
the flourishing time of the Roman Monarchy.
WE have already heard after what manner the Government of the Battavers was at
the very Original beginning of that people: But in regard that the
Magnificence of the Romans did oppress so many other Nations, that they made
free Commonwealths to be their Tributary; Provinces. And that they used the
very Kings themselves as instruments of slavery, as some Writers affirm: So
peradventure may some think that these Common Lords the Battavers were used
after the same manner also; and that the rather, because we read in Tacitus,
That the Battavers leaving the land of Hessen to dwell in a place where they
should be a part of the Roman Monarchy. But after what manner that is to be
understood, the Authors own words presently following do declare, where he
says, that the Mattiacks being near neighbors unto the Battavers were in the
very same custom with the Romans, that is, to pleasure them; which word does
not appertain unto a subject, but unto a friend: Adding yet further thereunto,
That it so far extended it self, not unto the Monarchy, but to the homage of
the Monarchy.

It is manifest that there are two sorts of tolerations; one sort that is
equal, and another sort that is unequal: The unequal is, when one Nation is
subject under the authority of another; The equal is when as each of these
Nations do continue in their own privileges, notwithstanding though one
Nation oftentimes be more mighty then the other, although their privileges
be both alike. Yet oftentimes it comes so to pass, that those that have the
least might, although the toleration be equal, yet nevertheless very
willingly do certain homage unto those that are the more mighty, and do
endeavor to please them: And in this case it is credible, that the Battavers
have done homage unto the Romans, and yet have not been subject under their
Command.

The word Society shows the very same, the which Tacitus uses in the same
place, which Society was also honorable; for says he, they held their
reputation, and the tokens of the old Society; for the Society betokens an
equality of each others privileges; and so much the more, when as the word of
Reputation is added thereunto, the which cannot be understood in a Nation which
submit themselves unto another, either by yielding, or by an unequal
toleration. Yet in another place Tacitus speaks more clearly of the
Battavers, where he says, That they being in the Society of such as were more
mighty then themselves, were nowhit dismayed at the Magnificence of the
Romans; for as commonly amongst those that are so unequal, there continues
no Society, but rather such a one as the Lion made, whereof the Fables make
report, who urged all to that point, that the strongest should have all;
wherein he clearly proves, that the Battavers had obtained this by their
undaunted courage and fidelity, that they maintained the Society, that is an
equality of privilege, not only in words, but in very deeds also.

I will conclude this point yet after this manner, The Nations that were under
the Romans, showed that they were subject under them by these three tokens;
First, that they were under the command of the Roman Magistrates; Secondly,
that they were Tributaries; and thirdly, that they paid Toll.

Now concerning the Roman Magistrates, they were never in the Island of the
Battavers; whereupon Civilis in his Oration unto his Country men, says, That
there never came so much as a Legate of the Romans unto the Battavers, but they
governed their own Common wealth by their own Laws, and their own
Magistrates; and in this respect they were never reckoned among the number of
the conquered Provinces: For oftentimes Tacitus makes mention of the Nation of
the Battavers, of the Convocations of the Battavers, of the Citizens of the
Battavers; by which words he means no other thing, then that which we now a
days call a Free Government; like as Caesar called the Citizens of of the
Swisers that is, the Commonwealth of the Swisers.

Now concerning the Tributes and Tolls, from which almost no Nation is free,
although it had bin for no other end and purpose in them, but for this respect,
That they enjoyed yet still their own Laws as a benefit from the Romans, yet
for all this the Battavers paid nothing at all, neither the one, nor the
other. Tacitus says, they were not upbraided with tributes, nor oppressed with
the receivers of the Toll. And presently thereafter he says that they were
free and exempt from all Charges and Contributions. Civilis in his Oration unto
the Walloons, says of the Battavers, That they were free from Tributes. And
the Battavers themselves speaking of themselves do say, that they were not
charged with any Tributes. What other Articles there were concerning the
tolleration, it were folly to make further enquiry then of those that are
manifest, and which the Romans and the Battavers agreed upon, as, That they
should mutually assist each other with men; and for this cause the Battavers
which were continually jarring with their Neighbors about their limits, had
the less need to fear them, because they learned of the Magnificence of the
Romans. And again, the Romans perceiving that the Battavers would be a great
assistance unto them against the Belgians, the Germans, Britains, yea even
against the whole world, as being such who were the most excellently valorous
of all other Nations round about them: and no less famous for their Horsemen,
Footmen, and Mariners, and aptness for all sorts of war; therefore like as
at this instant the Swisers are serviceable to many Kings; even so did the
Battavers unto the Romans in those days, furnishing them with Troops and
Companies, the which as Tacitus says, were governed according to their old
Customs by the noblest of their own Countrymen: This was a great token of
their equality, which seldom happened in the Monarchy of the Romans, that the
Battavers themselves appointed those that should be the General, and the
Officers of those that were sent to assist the Romans, and received none from
the Romans: This is that which Tacitus says, That the Battavers brought only
Men and Arms unto the Monarchy. And in another place he says, That they were
of purpose kept and preserved as a refuge to be chiefly used in Battles, and
were preserved for the war as Arms and Ammunition. Besides the assistance of
men, the Romans had another as great a benefit of the Battavers, as namely,
the use of the Island, wherein they had not only certain Garrisons, but also a
Fleet upon their Sea oasts, and all other things that were necessary for the
provision of their War against the Germans, or the Britains. It is without
all doubt, but that Caius Julius Caesar, was the first of the Romans that
invaded these Countries, by whom they were first brought unto this Society and
Alliance with the Battavers; for he makes mention himself of the Island of the
Battavers, and how that he was come so far where the Ryne and the Maes ran
into one stream, and that he in his Expedition had the Battavers to assist
him; the which Lucanus plainly expresses unto us. He himself also writes,
that he had with him Dutch Horsemen, afterterwards also certain light armed
Footmen, which whether they were Battavers themselves, or were among them; and
that the rather because that all the rest of the Germans had a detestable
hatred against the Romans: And Caesar writes, that those same Horse and
Footmen, were levied out of the Commonwealths, the which he himself had
pacified.

These were they by whose valor principally Caesar conquered the Walloons, as
Orosius writes.

These were they whose shock the Walloons by Noyon could not resist: for this
occasion* it is that Civilis boasts himself that the Burgondians and the
Averginans were daunted by the Horsemen of the Battavers.

These were they that beat back the Walloons, when they Charged Caesar at the
Borders of Langres.

These were they that in two several Battles conquered the Enemy by Ausseis.

By the valor of these were they of Beauvois put to flight: Afterward
concerning the Victory of the Pharsalians, Caesar had promised before, that no
other should have the first onset thereof, and the event and success shows
the same, as Florus and Dion do testify.

These were the very same Battavers, whose Horsemen had that Quality of
swimming over Rivers on Horseback, which no other could do, and put to flight
Ptolomy* and the Alexandrians, when they charged Caesar: for which great
examples of Courage and fidelity, Augustus Caesar took the Battavers to be his
personal Guard, as now many Kings do the Swisers, which also the succeeding
Emperors have Imitated: Of this mentions Dion, Suetonius, Tacitus and others.

Germanicus was exceedingly assisted by these, being under the Emperor
Tiberius, in respect of the situation of the Island, as also by the valor of
the Battavers, like as it is clearly proved by the example of the General
Cariovalda, in the Reign of the Emperor Claudius, when Plautius was sent into
Great Britain, That then a great part of that Island was Conquered by the
wonderful and admirable Stratagems of the Battavers as Dion testifies.

Again, under the Emperor Nero, when Suetonius Paulinus governed Great
Britain by many strategems, was the reputation of the Battavers exceedingly
augmented: Shortly thereafter, followed the Civil Wars of the Romans, whose
good or bad success depended most of all upon the Battavers.

These were they who advanced Galba, and after him Vitellius: The Legions of
the Romans themselves called them the strongest member of their Army, the
ablest men, old Soldiers, Conquerors in many Battles: Tacitus says, That the
Regiments of the Battavers, were a great motive unto what side soever they
inclined, whether they were with them or against them: And for this occasion,
the Vitellians durst not put to death Civilis; least that for the punishing of
one man, who was so mighty amonst the Battavers, they might lose the hearts of
so valiant a Nation. And Martial speaking of a Battaver, uses the words: This
face which I do show thee here,
Did make your Fathers most to fear.


Now since that the benefits were so many and so great, which the Battavers had
showed unto the Emperors, and unto the Monarchy of the Romans, as that they
had such profit by that Island: That they were so exceeding valorous, and that
the fame was so spread abroad of the great aid that they had received from
them, so that it was no marvel that for the space of a hundred and twenty
years (for so many years is the reckoning from Caius Julius Caesar, unto the
reign of the Emperor Vespasian) the Battavers still kept their reputation, and
their absolute perfect Privileges of the Society. But when the time came, that
the Favors of the Romans turned into an enforcing Taxation, and they not only
prosecuted the same with exceeding greediness, but also aggravated the same
with most detestable and reproachful Ravishments; the which was in no wise
tolerable for a free people to endure: Then did the Battavers that which was
lawful for such worthy men to do, in taking of Arms, whereby they might
defend their Liberty and unspotted Chastity: The occasion whereof, Civilis
reports, saying, That they were not Esteemed now as Companions, like as in
former time they had been, but as Slaves; That they for these occasions, had
justly taken Arms against the public Lords: That Liberty naturally was given,
even to the very brute beasts: From the History of which War does appear what
love the Battavers had to keep their Liberty; for the which, they feared not to
challenge the Romans power, and the fifteen Legions that were quartered round
about them: Therefore like as Tacitus says, the very name of the Romans was
expelled out of the Island of the Battavers; and they were exceedingly had in
great estimation throughout all Germany, and the Walloons Country, as being
the Authors of Liberty. This is also to be considered in the time of that War,
that when as the Walloons had generally taken Arms, and were also bound by
Oath unto the Legions of the Romans; That neither Civilis himself, nor yet any
of the Battavers, were bound with Oath as the Walloons were: That is, because
it was not convenient that such a free Nation, and such as fought for their
Liberty, should give their Oath unto any other.

What success and event that War had, which the Battavers undertook by the
Resolution of both the States, under the conduct of Civilis, against the
Tyrannical domineering of the Romans, is not very manifest, because that
Tacitus in his History makes no mention thereof. But in regard that Tacitus
says, that Cerialis did offer pardon unto Civilis, and peace unto the
Battavers; And that Josephus the Jewish Writer says, This War ended by
concluding of a peace; so that I make no question, but that the Battavers were
re-established in the former state of the Society: And so much the rather,
because that Tacitus writing of the manners of the Germans in the time of
Trajanus who was twice Consul, says, That the Battavers kept their old
reputation, and their tokens of the old Society: And in the sequel thereof,
shows manifestly enough, that after that War they were neither oppressed with
Tributes, nor yet with Toll; but that they kept their Privilege, only with
this Condition, that they should send aid unto the Romans.

And for a certainty, before that time, in the Reign of the Emperor Domitian,
Agricola being assisted by the Battavers, effected strange businesses in
Britain: Also when as Adrianus was with his Army by the Danow, that also then
was there great Service performed by the Battavish Soldiers.

After those times, the Privileges of the Battavers were so far from being
diminished, that their Reputation was the rather augmented, the which, certain
old Titles and Inscriptions, which are yet extant and found amongst us, do
sufficiently testify; whereof some produce the time of Severus; and others, of
Antonius and Geta; for they do not name the Nation of the Battavers, and the
Citizens of the Battavers, not Companions, like as formerly they were called:
but call them Brethren and Friends, as well of the people, as of the Monarchy
of the Romans; from which name, a certain Panegyric Writer, says, appears
as well the fellowship as the equality of their worthiness.

After these times, the Francks began to be known about the Ryne, against whom
the Battavers and the Romans had continual Wars: Oftentimes the Francks
invaded the Island of the Battavers, oftentimes they were repulsed. And lastly,
in the Reign of Constantius the Emperor, the Francks trailing the Almans along
with them, and the Saxons who were in Confederacy with them, swarming up and
down far and near, that then Iulianus did so pepper them in a great Battle
by Straesburch; for the Victory of which Battle, as Ammianus says, they may
principally thank the valor of the Battavers; for the Horsemen of the Romans
being all fled, and the Enemy beginning with their swords to fall to the
Execution of their confused Battle; the Battavers came to second and to
relieve them in their greatest necessity, they being as Ammianus says, a
terrible multitude of people, they came with their Kings with them: from whence
is concluded, that at that very time remained yet the same manner of Government
amongst the Battavers, which they had had of old, excepting that they by reason
of the continuing Wars, did more use the perpetual Command of the Kings, then
the temporal Command of the Generals. Moreover, that for the time that the
Monarchy of the Romans was ambitiously climbing or had any trouble, they never
diminished nor detained any Privileges from those that were their ablest
Confederates, not in the least degree, as mear reason can sufficiently approve
the same.

And undoubtedly, the cruel Wars with the Francks, which continually endured
from the Reign of Valerian, even unto the Monarchy of Iulianus, being a hundred
years, gave such a shroud pul-down unto the People of the Battavers, that by
reason thereof, it happened that the Salians who were one of the principal
Nations of the Francks, first invaded a part of the Island of the Battavers, as
I think, that part which is nearest unto Over-Isell, and with the consent of
the Romans and of the Battavers kept the same: But when the Quades being a
Nation of the Saxons strove to drive them out of their Possession, Then did the
Emperor Iulianus, first by Arms defend his new friends the Salians, and
afterward made Peace in such a manner, that he united the Quades and the
Salians being the valiantest, the one Nation of the Francks, and the other of
the Saxons, into one Corporation and name of Battavers. And hereupon, were
certain Legions levied out of these people of the Quades, Salians, and
Battavers, to aid the Romans, who (as we may understand by Zosimus) were all
called by the name of Battavers: whence appears, That the Battavers being
augmented by the increase of other Nations, did maintain the Privileges of
their Liberty undiminished. But especially about this time, the State of the
Romans in great Britain being very weak and in great danger, they were held up
and supported by the Battavers, by whose assistance recovering London, Civilis
who was a Battaver and of Royal blood, was then made Governor of great
Britain, as in my opinion, the very name imports so much, being descended from
that famous General which was in the Reign of the Emperor Vespasian.

The fourth Chapter. In what Estate the Commonwealth of the Battavers was
after the fall of the Roman Monarchy.
FRom these times until the first installing of the Earls, which was about
five hundred years after, the Histories are very defective: And in the mean
time, as on the one side, The Saxons, the the Wiltons, the Slavens, and
thereafter they of Norway and the Danes, by Invasions and Robberies had done
them very much harm; so on the other part it is probable, that while they
defended their lives and goods, and amongst many losses, the valor of the
Battavers increased; but all the rest is very obscure. Also at this time they
did begin to change their names, and the name of Battavia or Betow, being shut
up in the highest part of the Island, kept still that name: And the Battavers
whose dwellings were lower in the Island, began to be called Freises; the which
is not to be marvelled at, in regard that in Pliny his time, one part of the
Battavers were called little Freises or Frisiabons; and the very same may
appear in the old Superscriptions, That amongst these Battavers which were the
Guards of the Emperors, were certain Frisiabones.

Now it appeared well, that the name of Freises pleased them, either because
that same word in that Language is very near unto Freedom or Liberty; or else,
because that the Freises being environed about with great Lakes and Pooles were
not very accessible the reunto, and being the more invincible, were a Refuge
unto all other Battavers, which lay more open to the Invasions of the barbarous
Nations: And you shall ever find, that the first Earls were called by no other
Title, but of the Freises, before that ever the name of the Hollanders was
known: Like as Tacitus at this time, and in former times, makes mention of the
Kings and Generals. And Ammianus a little before these times, makes mention of
the Battavian Kings; in like manner also it is that the Ancient Writers of the
French and German Histories, about this time do nominate certain Kings of the
Freises, which have held hard War against the Francks; and amongst others, the
name of Radbond is very famous, whose head is to be seen in the Castle at
Medenblick; after the Kings, you shall find certain Generals expressed by
their names; these were they which were called Potentates.

It is somewhat strange, that which we read in Procopius, That in the great
Sea, about the mouths of the Ryne, that there should be an Island called
Britton, lying opposite against Great Britain: That the same Island was
inhabited by three Nations, whose names were the Britons, English and Frieses;
from whence yearly, many people went to inhabit the unhabited Countries of the
Francks: And that for this occasion, the Francks, although they had no other
Interest in that Island, the which also was governed by their own Kings, yet
nevertheless they endeavored that it should be said and be believed, that it
was subject under them: And hereupon, the King of the Francks sending an
Ambassador unto Constantinople, unto the Emperor Iustinianus, did therewithal
send some of the People of the foresaid Island, that by that means he might
have a pretense of Authority over that Island.

That this Britton was Battavia, or else a part of Battavia, bordering upon the
Sea, may with some approbation of the truth be spoken, because there is no
other Island in the Sea, that has the mouths of the Ryne in it. And moreover
and above, it appears that upon the Sea shore of Battavia upon the middle
mouth of the Ryne, there stood a House called Britton, whereof yet even in
these days the remaining Foundations are yet seen; and it is no marvel then
that either the House took this name from the Island, or else the Island took its
name from the house. In the like manner, as with us here in Holland the name of
the River has of old been called the Fly; then after, the House standing
thereupon got the same name, so that even now the whole Island is called
Flieland; which if this be true, then was there yet two other Nations which
inhabited that Island, besides those that were born in the Island, which we have
said before were called Frieses, viz. the English, which were an old Germane
people, and the Britons which peradventure were enforced by the violence of the
Picks and men of Norway to leave their native Country, and to seek them a
place of a more strong refuge and retreat. It is therefore without all doubt,
that the English and Saxons possessed the Sea Coasts which were the nearest
unto the Battavers, and that they diverse times sailed from thence into
Britain which is now called England. It is also manifest that Willebord an
English man came hither out of England and preached the truth of the Christian
Religion unto our forefathers in the same language that was then spoken in
England. It is also credible, that the Britons betook themselves for their
refuge, as well unto the moorish parts of our Country as unto the Sea Coast of
France, which is now called little Britain. But that the Francks striving for
the Reputation of their Kingdom, do affirm that it should have extended so
far, who indeed had no Command over this Island, or at least, not below
Utrecht, the which some do affirm to be the period of the Kingdom of the
Francks, then called Austrasians, which do very well approve the Liberty of
the Sea-bordering Battavers; from whence it is credible, that they were
multiplied from time to time, by the increase of new Nations. And that they
having made peace with the Francks for fear of the People of Norway, and
uniting themselves by a fast and sure league, have continued their old manner
of Government, as well under their Kings, as under their Generals, even to the
time of their Earls, whereunto we now proceed.

The fifth Chapter. In what estate the Commonwealth of the Battavers was in in
the days of the Earls.
I Will pass by what others have reported of the institution of this Earldome,
who therein have followed the Authority of a certain report but lately risen
up, the same being founded upon certain writings, which does sufficiently
confute it self: And will only speak of that which concerns my purpose, and as
I think is the truth, and that with no small reasons: It is thus then, That
before the time of Dederick, who was counted the first of the Earls of Holland,
there were in Holland many Princes that had their Authority not over the whole
Nation, but each of them over some one part thereof: As those had whereof
Tacitus and Caesar do make mention of: These Princes were called by the names
of Graven or Grafiones, which we in English call Praetors* and now the Dutch
Graven, that is Earls, which is often found in the Germane Laws: which to
speak properly, is nothing else but Judges, from whence we call those that are
the Officers and Controlers of the Causies and of those Bancks that do check
the Rivers and the Sea, we call them Dykegraven, that is Causie-Judges or
Causie Earls. And with good reason were those Princes so called, because that
their Principal Office was as is aforesaid to administer the Law: Now
wherefore that these Earls or Judges in former ignorant times, by those that
spoke Latin, were called Comites, or Companions, I can find no great reason
for it, unless peradventure, because that they together among themselves were
all alike of one estimation, respect, and worthiness. And from hence it is,
that those Regions, which in old time were called Pagi, that is, great
Burroughes or Villages, got the name of Counties or Earldomes. And such an
Earldome Walcheren which is an Island in Zealand has bin: And likewise, such
have been Maesland, Kennemerland, and Texell, being all Regions in Holland,
each of them has been Earldoms of themselves, the which both History and
ancient Writings testify. Such also were the forefathers of the Seigneors of
Wassenar, who were called Burghgraven, that is Castle or Burrough-Earls, who
were the Judges of that Castle or Borough (as it is very credible) in which
place is now the old City then called Lugdunum Battavorum, now called Leyden
(which was then destroyed by the People of Norway) and also of some part of the
Country thereabouts, which Seigneors being the Survayers of the Dams and
Sluices of the River Ryne, there has anciently been paid unto them certain
Tolls; the which is continued yet to their posterity. At the same time were
there certain Cities or Towns in this Land, as Schaffnaburgensis an old Writer
names Flaording and Rynsburch to be very strong Towns in Freisland; whereunto
may be added Froonley in former times the chief City of the Northren Quarter:
Dordrecht and Haerlem are of no little Antiquity. The Principal Seigneors
aforenamed, and the Magistrates of the Towns (seeing that they were daily
incombred with their Enemies the People of Norway, and that now the Enemy was
more furious in regard that our Battavers had lately embraced the Christian
Religion) held a public Consultation and Resolution (as may well be imagined)
how that they not would content themselves with certain retreats, which they
had long used against the violence of their Enemies: but also how they might
deliver their native Country, both for the present and future time from such
unwelcome Guests, whereunto the mutable and temporary command of the Generals
was not sufficient; they thought it good after the example of their
forefathers, who had Kings, yet their liberty not infringed, to ordain a
Prince, over the whole body of the Commonwealth; which they entitled not with
the Title of King, as being such a one as was not employed any otherwise then
in the chiefest and absolute Authority, but entitled him by that accustomed
and usual name or Title of Gravii, that is Judge or Earl, yet with this
difference, that he was not called Earl with an addition of any Quarter
thereunto, but simply, as being Judge himself over the other Judges. Unto this
command (out of all question) he was chosen that was the very principal, both
for Nobility and power amongst all other Princes: This was Dederick who in the
old Records was called the Freise.

Now that these Battavers which dwelt upon the Seaside were called Freises, we
have showed already, and the same is manifestly proved with the aforesaid
place of Schaffnaburgensis.

John Vander Does the Father, Seigneor of Noortwick, a man as exceedingly well
known amongst his own people by reason of his Nobility, as also to all others
by reason of his Learning, manifestly shows (in his books, wherewith he has
perpetually obliged his Native Country by an everlasting benefit unto him) out
of Regino an old Writer, that this Dederick had a Brother whose name was
Walgar, and that this Walgars and Dedericks Father was one Gerloffe, whom
Regino a very faithful French Historiographer affirms to have been an Earl of
the Frieses. Dederick was then before an Earl, and an Earls son, but Earl of
some one certain Quarter, and not of the whole Nation, which honor is bestowed
upon him principally through the favor and good affection (as may be well
supposed) of the Lords and the People of the Towns. And also because that in
the Maps of Vtrecht, there is mention of a Region or Quarter called Holland; so
peradventure it is likely to be true, that this same Region was the Earldom of
Dederick and his Predecessors: And that thereafter, the whole body of the
Commonwealth being concredited unto him, grew into a Community of the same
name, to this end, that those Freises which dwelt upon this side of the River
Fly, should properly be called the great Freises, only to make a difference
between those Freises which dwelt on the other side of the Fly; yet
nevertheless, that part which is next unto the Fly, even to this present day
is called West Freisland, the which with Holland makes a Commonwealth. Unto
this is very conform that which the States of Holland alleged in that famous
Controversy which was disputed upon by them and the Brabanders before the
Emperor Charles the Fifth, Prince of the Netherlands, where the Brabanders
affirmed, that the Emperor Charles the Fourth had granted them a certain
Privilege, that they out of their own Country might not be sued at the Law,
maintaining therewithal, that it was not lawful for the Hollanders to proceed
against the Brabanders by manner of Arrest after the Hollanders manner.
Whereupon the States of Holland showed to the contrary, That that Privilege
did not concern them, in regard that they and their Earls from all Antiquity
had the Sovereignty and all manner of Juridisction without giving any manner of
acknowledgement unto any other; And that since the time that Dederick the
First, recovered the Land of Holland from the Barbarous Nations, the which was
then subject under the power of no King, that the same Earls of Holland at all
times ever had the like Authority in their own Earldoms, as the Emperors of
Germany or of Italy had in their Empire, without being bound or beholden to any
by manner (of Leen,) that is either Free form or Coppy-hold.

The which may be gathered even from that succession, that the women had in the
Earldom; And also from hence, That the Earls have set out great parts of the
Earldom, as the Lordships of Foirne, Arckel, and Putten and others, and that
even to hereditary Free-farme, or Coppy-hold, without the Consent of any other
Foreign Power: Although that the Ordinances of the Germane Empire, with what
general Title soever they might be written or Registered, were never so much as
once published in Holland, neither were they in any one point obedient
thereunto, the which they also proved with a very memorable late Example; for
whereas the Germans had ordained very many Laws for the obtaining of
succession without testament, even to the derogation of all customs to the
contrary; yet nevertheless the Heritages in Holland were never assigned by no
other Law then by their own customs to that very day; that also the affairs
neither of the Earls nor of the States were never sentenced by the German
Senators.

The which being thus alleged and proved by the Hollanders, the Declaration
followed, that that privilege which was given unto the Brabanders, was of no
force in Holland.

Besides this, Philip of Leyden writing a Book of the Government at what time
as the first William of Byeren governed Holland, and dedicated the same Book
unto his Prince, he then professing the Law in France, says often in the same
Book, That the Earl of Holland is Emperor in his Earldom.

We know that the Germane Emperors, and also the Francks, as it is before
reported out of Procopius, usually pretended that not only the Earls of
Holland, and other Princes, but even the Kings themselves were their Vassals;
the which although it were granted unto them, yet in that respect the
Hollanders were nevertheless free. In such like manner, as Proculus an ancient
Lawyer proves very well; The particulars which are defended by others, do not
therefore lose their freedom, because they are not of equal worth with their
protectors: And in like manner, the freedom of the people is not diminished,
because in their Covenant there is contained that they with all courtefie
should respect the Sovereignty of another, from whence also the name of free
Leenen (that is, as Free Copyholders) has its Original. But nevertheless
this same Covenant of free Leen, or after what sort or manner the same might or
could be termed, the Earls never consented unto, as easily may be understood
by that which before has been said, as also out of the History of the Wars
with the first Earls; and namely, Dederick the fourth, (for the maintenance of
their reputation and worthiness) undertook with good success against the
Emperors. And put the case that any of those Earls, either in time of
necessity, or for some certain consideration, were brought thereunto, who
depending upon the Emperors have desired their protection, which so happening
without the consent of the States, the same could neither prejudice the
privilege of the Commonwealth, nor yet of the succeeding Princes. In every
respect we are certainly assured that neither those Earls of the house of
Burgundy, nor yet those Earls of the house of Austria, the memory whereof is
yet unfallible, that they never in respect of Holland have done any homage unto
the Emperors: And that Holland never was subject neither to the Laws nor
Customs of the Emperor, nor of the Empire, which is the very principal point
of all; and that the Germans themselves do confess; from whence it is
manifest, that the principal Sovereignty over the Hollanders has been among
themselves, and never depended upon any foreign Authority.

It remains now that we consider the other, that is, what privilege and
authority the Princes had in the Commonwealth, and what was the Authority of
the States; the which we should very particularly know, if in case those Laws
were to be found, which concerning the Authority were given unto Dederick. But
besides that which formerly has been spoken, that by the Germans books as well
of public as of particular matters but very lately began to be registered, so
is also the memory of all those times, (excepting only of some certain Wars,
and of some other matters which do not concern this purpose,) utterly lost:
Yet even before these times there was not given so great a power, as there was
authority unto the Kings of the Battavers, the which even in our fathers days
has been registered up by foreign Writers, That the command of the Princes of
these Lands was as well limited with Laws, as it was moderated by the
resolution of the States; from whence we may assuredly collect, that the
Government of the time, which was betwixt them both, has been the very same
Government as was received from our Ancestors, and left again unto posterity:
Neither is it lightly to be credited, that those worthy Cities, and the
Inhabitants that were so noble and so mighty as we have shown to have been in
those former times, did fall from that equality of power whereunto they were
accustomed, unto such a sudden unequality: And on the contrary part, it is
manifest, that afterward when as the magnificence of the Earls by the
adjoining of other Principalities thereunto greatly increased, and especially
in the House of Bourgondy and of Austria, that then the freedom or liberty
rather decreased then increased. These were then the principal Laws of the
Government, viz. That no Countess should marry unto any man, but with the
consent and good liking of the States.

That none of the Officers, as of the Counsel, and Rent-masters, and
Pretorship should be conferred upon no other but unto those that were born
within the Land.

That the States shall have liberty to assemble upon the affairs of the Land
and State, and that as often as it shall please them, without need to have
consent of the Earl for that end.

That no new Tolls might be imposed, neither any man freed from those that
formerly were ordained, but by consent of the States.

That the Prince should undertake no war, neither defensive, nor offensive,
otherwise then by the consent of the States.

That the Princes should in all their writings use the Dutch Language.

That the Coin should be altered, and appointed by the Prince, according as
the States find it convenient.

That the Prince might not make away any part of his Principality.

That the States may not be warned to assemble upon any convocation out of the
Provinces.

That when as the Prince shall have need of any impositions or collections,
that he himself personally, and not by the mediation of his Lieutenant, shall
make intercession unto the States, without exacting any thing otherwise then by
a willing and voluntary free consent.

That he exercise and administer Justice and Law by the hands of ordinary
Justices.

That the ancient Laws and customs, being holy, should be inviolably
observed; and if the Prince should ordain any thing contrary the reunto, that
no man is bound to observe the same.

These Laws having been long maintained by mere custom, were afterward
registered into Articles, and subsigned by the Princes from time to time, to
this end that the natures of the same Princes might not be infected by the
evil incitatations of flattering Courtiers unto the hope of an unlawful
domination: And at the last, in regard that the States made complaint of their
grievances, that most of the fundamental points of the ancient Government were
overthrown by innovations; even then was there a collection made of all these
aforesaid Laws; and so by some others before, but chiefly by Mary Countess of
Bourgondy, they were sealed up for an everlasting memory.

And although the Hollanders now in the succession of the Earldom followed
the order of lineall descent; yet nevertheless, to the end they might show
that the command and authority did not proceed from a fatherly inheritance, but
from the consents of the people, that is, of the States, therefore they never
esteemed any for their Prince, before that they had bound themselves by an oath
unto the States, to maintain the Laws and Customs of the Land; the which
being thus performed, they promised again to him fidelity and obedience in
whatsoever the Laws should command them. Wherefore in regard that those Laws
being conditions and precontracts, are connexed unto the Authority, then hereby
is manifest, that those Princes had no power of themselves to loose or to
dispense themselves from the aforesaid Laws, as it has been very much
discoursed and concluded upon by those that have written much of Government:
From whence it follows, that since the chief Power or Sovereignty cannot be
in such a one as is bound unto any Civil Laws or institutions, like as most
of the Northern Princes be, that even also the Earl of Holland being bound
unto so many Laws, has not had the right of the Sovereign power only in
himself.

All that which we now have declared from the words of the Laws or from other
Covenants, or Contracts, even all them, and diverse other points of no less
consequence are all approved by very old examples.

For whereas Arnoulffe the third of the Princes had two sons, the eldest who
was called Sifrid, and of some Sicco, for some certain fault, was denied the
command; and the Principality (by the consent of the States) was conferred upon
the younger, whose name was Dederick.

Dederick the fourth dying without issue, although there were as yet no example
of a brotherly succession, the States proclaimed Florence the brother of the
deceased to be Prince.

The Wardship of Dederick the fifth of that name (whose years being yet unfit
for government) the States conferred upon his Mother the Lady Geertright, and
also married her unto Robert the son of an Earl of Flanders, who hereby got
the surname of the Friese, because that he governed the Hollanders, who at that
time were yet called the Freises.

Ada the daughter of Dederick the seventh, because that she married the Earl
of Loen against the States will, was deposed from the Principality, and in her
place succeeded William the brother of Dederick the sixth.

Florence the fourth, being yet but young, his Uncle Florence was ordained
Protector, after whose death because that Alidt his Aunt administered in the
Protectorship, not according to the counsel of the States, but after her own
will, the Government was committed unto Otto Earl of Gelder, who was the
nearest (though very far) of kindred unto the young Earl.

Afterward the Principality being void by the death of Florence the fourth,
the Commonwealth was governed by the Nobles and the Cities, until that John
the son of Florence, who (traveling abroad) returned out of England, whose
Wardship was concredited unto John Earl of Avennes.

Afterward, the Lady Margaret because it seemed that she was not fit for
government, was deposed, and in her place they accepted her son Duke William
for their Earl, who afterward being mad, the charge of the Commonwealth was
committed unto Duke Albrecht his Brother, as Steward, providing that he should
govern the Commonwealth by the Counsel of the Barons, Lords, Knights and
Squires (which are degrees of the Nobility) and of good Towns. This Albrechts
son, Duke William, perceiving that he should dye without leaving any
Heire-male after him, assembled a Convocation of all the Nobles and of the
Cities, and there entreated and obtained, that the succession of the Earldom
might be granted unto his Daughter the Lady Iacobey; but in regard that this
Iacobey abused her self, by marrying without the consent of the States, she
was reputed unworthy of the Government, so that in her life time she must
endure to see the Government of Holland transported unto Duke Philip of
Bourgondy.

This Philip his sons daughter the Lady Mary was married unto Maximilian,
Archduke of Austria; which Maximilian after his wives death, desiring to keep
the agreement in his hands, and administering in the same, not as being
administrator and Protector of his son Philip the second of that name, nor
yet according to the good liking of the States, but after a kingly manner; then
the States of Holland, and of the adjoining Provinces valiantly resisted the
same.

The same States of the Netherlandish Provinces appointed the Protectors unto
the Emperor Charles the fifth of that name when he was but young, and came
first to the Principality.

The same Charles the Emperor having in an Assembly of the general States
resigned his Principality, recommended very earnestly his Son Philip unto the
fidelity of the said States.

All these are tokens that the Princely Authority, like as it had the original
beginning from the States, that even so it returned again unto them, as often
as there was no Prince to succeed.

Moreover, we shall not find any Act or Condition of any of the old Earls of
any importance, but that it was Authorized and ratified by the consent of the
Barrons and Nobles, who sealed and gave virtue unto the same; for these were
the Ancientest Council of the Earls, like as it was also in former times of
the Germane Kings.

Now concerning the Cities, their number, and with the number their worthiness
is from time to time augmented; for even of old time each City had their own
Council of Senators; and one of those Senators dying, the place was supplied
by another of the ablest and wealthiest of the Burgesses: And in some places,
that same Council ordains the principal Magistrates which are called the
Burgh-Masters: And in some other places, they present the names of the same
Burgh-Masters, and also of the Jurats, which sit to do Justice, unto the
Prince for the electing of them, yet in such a manner, that they have the
nomination of as many more as are chosen, which the Prince may not exceed, the
which is no little assurance of their Liberty.

It appears also by very many examples, that not only the great Cities, as
now in these latter times has happened, but even the little ones also, do
take their turns at the Convocations and Assemblies of the States. Philip of
Leyden before named making often mention of the Nobles and the Governors of
the Cities, calls them the great ones of their native Country, saying, that
their care was (the Prince neglecting the same) to see that the Commonwealth
should suffer no wrong. I find also that in the days of William the Fourth,
who was the last of the House of Henault, about two hundred and thirty years
ago, That at Dordrecht, there was an exceeding great Convocation, of the three
Nations of Holland, Zealand, and Henault, where the Deputies of the Cities,
being very many, were Assembled about the Toles: And this Assembly was called
the High Council. Moreover, no Imposions nor Contributions were imposed
without the consent of the States, as appears by all those reckonings which
are found in the Courts, whereof the consent thereunto of the same was always
openly published.

And from hence it proceeds, that even of old and from all times, the
aforesaid Contributions and Impositions, were called nothing else but the
Entreaties, the which name is often found in Philip of Leyden, in regard that
they (as has been showed already) were granted at the entreaties of the
Princes. The same being also a sufficient demonstration how the Principality
must strike sail unto the Authority of the States: Yea, even in Philip
himself who was the last Earl, and maintaining Wars in France, those nine
years Impositions were not consented unto by the States no otherwise, but by
the prescription of certain Laws, and amongst others this, That the money
should be at the disposition of such persons that should be appointed thereunto
by the States. Like as it is manifest, that the States have held and maintained
that Privilege, that they may assemble at their own pleasures, even in the
very latest times that were before the Wars.

From all that which hitherto has been spoken, appears, that the Earls of
Holland have differed almost nothing at all from the old Kings, but that they
only used a name which was not so eminent, nor yet so suspicious for the
Liberty as the Kingly Title was. Moreover, that the same Earls were elected
according to the succession of blood, as the same is used by many free Nations;
but yet nevertheless, the Authority was not given unto them without exception,
in regard that there were Laws appointed thereunto, and were confirmed by
Oath. That herewithall, the Authority of the Earls was not so extenuated, but
that the power of the States was such, and that in diverse matters, and
especially concerning the Coin, which is the sinnews and strength of a
Common-Weath. And that may we truly say of the Earls, which in former times
was said of the Germane Kings, that they had Authority, but it was by entreaty*
or permission. If in case I should seek for a Foreign example to this purpose,
I can find none more like hereunto, then in the Commonwealth of the
Lacedaemonians, the which by Plato, Polybius and very many wisemen, yea, by
Apollo himself is affirmed so to be, and is by them commended before all
other; for in these, the Kings succeeded one after another, by the order of
their Consanguinity, in so much that in place of the Kings, those that were the
Protectors or Dictators, which they called Prodicos, had the Authority in their
hands: But the Kings were not admitted to the Authority before they had taken
their Oath to use their Authority according to the Custom of the Laws of the
Land. Now the Kings had power over each one, but above the Kings were the
Survayers or Ephori, together with the Council.

The Ancient Fathers do very much commend a notable Speech of Theopompus King
of the Lacedaemonians, who being disdainfully reproved by his own wife, because
that he had diminished his own Highness by the Institution of the Office of
the Survayers; he Answered thereunto, That he should leave unto his Children a
lesser, but yet a more permanent Authority: For of a truth, it is even so as
the Ancient Fathers used truly to report, That every Commonwealth consists
in a certain melody or consort, the which being once broken, all comes to
naught: which melody in my opinion consists not in any sound or in strings,
but in the well tempered unity of the Prince with the People, and of the People
with the Prince; or of several States, the one with the other. In this melody
have the Princes, the Nobility, and the Comonalty long time flourished, when as
each one respected the Prince, and the Prince himself respected the Laws and
the common Assemblies; and whilst the Nobility kept their Reputation, and the
Comonalty their Liberty: From hence issued the good success of War; from
hence it proceeded that this Nation, like as in former times they were
Confederates with the Romans, even so thereafter, though being little, have
sought unto great Alliances. Hereof the Treatises of the Confederacies do
plainly show; for presently at the very birth (as it were) of the Principality
there were two Dedericks, as it is generally believed, who were Brothers in-law
unto the Kings of France. Arnolffe the third Earl, had to wife a daughter of
the Emperor of Constantinople, whose sister was married unto the Emperor of
Germany. Diverse others that succeeded, were married unto the House of Saxon,
who then possessed the Empire. Florence the third, was married unto the House
of the King of Scotland; William the Second of that name, Earl of Holland, was
elected Emperor of Germany; and as I think, for no other cause, but for that
he was used in his own Country unto such a moderate Government. This man's
Son Florence the Fourth, was earnestly solicited unto, on the one side, by
the King of England, and on the other side, by the King of France, for his
Confederacy with the presentation of each of their Daughters in marriage with
great gifts. But John his Son with the advice of the chiefest Nobles of the
Land married the daughter of England: And presently after William the Sixth,
married the daughter of the King of France. Again, the daughters of the Earls
were bestowed into very great Houses, as the Lady Margarite the daughter of
William the Fourth, unto an Emperor of the House of Beyeren: Iacoby unto a
Dolphin of France: And all these whilst they were but only Earls of Holland and
Zealand, and some of Henault: After that by the daughter of Albrecht, who was
married unto one of the house of Burgondy, did Holland obtain the same Prince,
who was before Prince of Brabant, and of Flanders, and many other Nations. And
by this means were several Nations, not differing in manners, Laws, and
Customs from each other, being at a special unity, and under one public
Authority, thereby the more fortified: Thereafter the Lady Mary of Burgondy,
had by her Husband the Archduke of Austria, a Son, unto whom befell for his
marriagegood, the greatest part of Spain, and with Spain the expectation of
Terra nova and many other Titles which are spread far and wide over diverse
Countries. But from this great Magnificence of the Prince, proceeded a great
alteration in the Government, the which I will briefly touch.

The sixth Chapter. How that the intended Alteration of the Government, was the
occasion of the Wars.
THe nature of man is much addicted, and is easily inclined to domination; from
whence (according to the saying of Aristotle) proceeds Tyrannical
Government; especially, when as the Prince transgresses the limits of the Laws
of the Land: And it seldom happens, but that men attempt the taking of more in
hand, then they are able to perform, unless the very hope of the performance of
that which is desired be utterly extinguished: Therefore those ancient Princes
whose hope and repose depended altogether upon their Native Country, as having
no expectation of Foreign power to rely upon, were obedient unto the Laws,
were lovers of equity, were respecters of the States, as well knowing upon
whose power and means both their honor and reputation consisted.

The Burgondians descended of Royal Progeny, were the first that climbed up
the first step unto domination, yet very secretly; the Liberty continuing never
the less, not only in outward show, but also for the greatest part thereof in
her full face.

Afterward Charles being Emperor, and King of other Countries, was not
therewithal well contented, that herewithall he should be called but a Prince:
But yet he for affection and some certain respects was restrained, in regard
that he was born and brought up here in the Country; and besides, did
exceedingly respect this People, as being very convenient Instruments for the
enterprising of any great exploit; and such as were of themselves very
faithful, but yet very soon displeased, and exceeding powerful, when as their
Liberty should be but once touched.

Now the Church of God at that time being overwhelmed and poisoned with
palpable Heresies, and longing for a wholesome medicine to purge the same: yet
he resolving by violence to maintain that which was in use amongst them, sent
his bloody Commissions, that whosoever should be found to be of any other
Religion, should be punished with death, never respecting nor enquiring what
was the meaning and resolution of the States in so weighty a business.

But his Son Philip being of that unsatiable nature, that was content with
nothing else but with an absolute power, envied all Nations that would
prescribe a Law unto their Prince: The which the People of Aragon to their
great ruin have proved. The Spaniards, who had the Education of King Philip in
his youth, took hold of this occasion very earnestly, to prosecute the same
against the Hollanders, and the rest of the Netherlanders; since which time,
there has been a continual jealousy and contention betwixt them, which of
them should be best in the Princes favor; whereupon they sought to make the
Liberty of the Netherlands very hateful: And on the contrary, to demonstrate
how that the Cities in Italy, and the Countries of America, and the
West Indies, in such and such manner were kept in subjection with their
Garrisons, and that there was an absolute obedience without any limitation.

At what time as the wars in France ending, and King Philip being requested
in behalf of the States, that he would draw the Garrisons of the Spaniards
out of the Country; which reasonable request of theirs, he took very
hainously, and in ill part; and being returned again into Spain, from that
time for the most part after never permitted the public affairs of Holland,
nor of the Netherlands to be governed by the Lords that were the Inhabitants,
and borne in the Country, whereof according to old custom, the principal and
permanent Council of the State of this Land did ever consist, but by the
resolutions which were concluded in Spain* leaving here the Cardinal
Granvell to be the executioner of the Spanish Precepts.

The matters concerning Religion were brought to that pass, that although it
had bin a matter of great offense to have believed any otherwise then the Pope
of Rome should think convenient, yet nevertheless a good Prince should not
have atempted to have punished the same, in regard of the great multitudes of
those that might be accused therewithal, from whose consciences that Religion
of what sort soever it might be, would never by no fear have been
extinguished, or qualified.

For this occasion the principal Lords, and also the chiefest Cities and
Provinces made their Declaration, that neither their traffic, nor yet the
common tranquillity of the Land could be maintained, unless those corrisive
Commissions concerning the Religion, were lenified and mitigated; the which was
so far contrary to his mind, that King Philip should follow their counsel
therein, that he contrary thereunto ordained that such a search and
inquisition should be made, even to the very secret motions and cogitations of
the heart, and that after a very new, strange, and unusual manner of
proceeding, the like whereof was never heard before, in such manner as if it
had been against those Jews, or Mahumetists which shelter secretly in some
parts of Christendom, and is practiced in Spain.

To this end and purpose were there here and there new Bishoprics erected and
distributed with great contradicting and in despite of the States, without
whose consent in former time the Clergymen might not be augmented; considering
now that all this without all doubt tended to the great confusion of the
public affairs, and first of all, those Lords that were in the Council of
State, and afterward a great number of noble personages assembling to this end
and purpose, under whom also was the Lord of Brederode, descended of the Family
of the Princes of Holland, who did both counsel and entreat, that they should
proceed unto that remedy, the which in former times was very often used in
matters of less moment, viz. to a Convocation of the General States, although
King Philip before his departure, and at his departure, had excessively
commanded to hinder the same, that there might be no Convocation of the
General States; from hence there arose an uprore, not by any common consent,
but by the enterprise of some certain particular persons of the poorest and
common people, about the taking away of the Images out of the Churches, in
regard that it was a high trespass and sin to make supplication and
intercession unto them. And after that this uprore was pacified by the
authority of the principal Lords, it pleased the King of Spain, and the
Spaniards, under the pretext of this one inconsiderate particular, contrary to
all right and reason, to charge the whole Nation generally with the offense of
Rebellion; whereupon the Duke of Alba was sent with a very rigorous Commission,
to take possession of the absolute Sovereignty, being naturally a very rigorous
man, as all Germany can testify; he very openly published that both the
States, Cities, and People of the Netherlands, and every person in particular
had forfeited all their privileges, and that from hence forward they were to
expect no other Laws but what it pleased the King to command, whereof he
himself was a sufficient testimony that the Laws were abolished; he being a
stranger, and none of the Princes blood, and yet nevertheless against all
right and custom was sent to possess the general Government. The judgment
of matters was also withdrawn from the lawful and ordinary Colleges, and by
the erection of a new Judgment Seat, or Bench, where the matter of Lesae
Majestatis, or the abusing of His Highness, should be decided by the
Spaniards, and by their adherents, such as made themselves slaves unto the
Spaniards, having gotten under their power, not only the lives, but also the
goods of all the inhabitants, whereof not only many thousands of the common
people were executed, but also the very Earls themselves of Egmond and Horn,
being condemned by false accusations, were forced to present their necks to the
violent stroke of the Hangman. William Earl of Nassaw, Prince of Orange, being
one of the chiefest Lords of the Netherlands, with diverse others, were
banished; of which persons, Egmond had his Earldome in Holland, and the Prince of
Orange was Governor of Holland. The Marquess of Berghen, and the Lord of
Montignie, who had carried the Requests and Remonstrations of the people and of
the States into Spain, were both made away, the one being openly executed, and
the other* according to common report, poisoned.

Thereafter, according to the custom of all those that will be Dominators,
the Cities were planted with Spanish Garrisons, or else Cittadels and Castles
built therein. Moreover and above, to the end that this Nation, which before to
this present time had been a free people, might the more openly publish their
slavery, by maintaining and providing for themselves food and raiment, they
were enforced at that time by the terrible threatenings of their Deputy, to
bring up the twentieth penny at the sale of every house or parcel of Land, and
every tenth penny of all Movables, which their Princes themselves in former
times were accustomed to.

Then the Fidelity and the Liberty of those people were long contending with
each other; but in regard it was not possible to endure any longer the
oppression of their Laws: and they setting at naught of the States, and the
Government which had continued so many hundred years; and that the Liberty
of their posterity could not longer be maintained: then the States of
Holland, unto whom appertained the protection, as well both of the Laws, as
also of the general, and their own particular Rights, in the year 1572. upon
the 19. of July, in the Assembly at Dordrecht, consisting of certain Nobles,
and of the Deputies of the greatest part of the Cities, according to the
example of their Fore fathers, who took up Arms against the Romans, when as
they pressed to be Dominators, undertook the war against the Duke of Alba,
re-establishing again the persons that were unlawfully banished, and
acknowledged William Prince of Orange for their Governor and General.

The seventh Chapter. In what estate the Commonwealth of the Battavers was in
the time of War, and is now at this present since the War.
SInce which time the Sovereignty of the States, which was not a little
obscured and darkened by that usurped Authority of the last Princes, is brought
again shining more clear in the light. And afterward when as the States of
the neighboring Provinces had taken Arms with them of Holland for the
maintenance of their Liberty, and were knit together by an assured alliance and
confederacy; And that King Philip (whose reputation even yet hitherto has not
been touched) neither by entreaties, nor by admonition, could be brought into a
better mind: then at last the general States upon the 26. of July, in the
year 1581. declared that King Philip, by reason of the nullifying of their
Laws of Government, according to all Laws, and ipso jure had forfeited his
Principality, in the same manner like as many free Nations have oftentimes
condemned their Prince, as the Lacedaemonians condemned Pausanias; the Romans,
Nero; the Venetians, Falerius; and the Danes, Christiern: Yet nevertheless,
these Nobles did not govern the Commonwealth without a Principality. But like
as in former times in place of the Kings succeeded the Generals, even so did
the Prince of Orange (the title of Earl being taken away) obtained the lawful
Authority under the Title of Governor: This Prince his singular unity with the
States, whilst he gave place unto their Mightiness, and they on the contrary
part both loved and respected him as being their common Father, brought the
affairs of Holland from little beginnings to a great growth; wherefore
although the neighborings Provinces had ordained first Matthias Archduke of
Austria, and after him the Council of State, and yet after them the Duke of
Anjoy over them: yet nevertheless the States of Holland and Zealand
maintaining firmly the confederacy with their Neighbors, and never consenting
unto any alteration in their own lands, continually maintained, not only the
same manner of Government, but even also the very outward form of the
Government.

After the death of the Prince of Orange, the general Government was resigned
unto the Earl of Leicester, who had brought over English* Soldiers with him
to aid these Lands; but in regard that he being of a Kingly prodigality, and
unacquainted with our Customs, and following evil Counselors, began to speak
against the Government of the States, and to bring in many innovations;
thereupon the States took occasion to show that their power from the which
Leicester had received his Commission, was the most righteous and the most
ancient power. Also, certain persons, who to pleasure him, sought by uproars
to bring in alterations, they punished with death; which the Earl of Leicester
understanding, left both the Government and the Land. And thereupon Prince
Maurice, the son of William Prince of Orange, took upon him the chief
government over Holland, and of certain of the Neighboring Provinces. Under
his Government has been great concord, so that by the twenty yeeers
tranquillity of the Commonwealth, and by the enlarging of their borders, by
fortunate Battales, by Seidges so ably enterprized, as also more ably resisted,
have the States obtained the fame of exceeding wise Governors, and Prince
Maurice the fame of the worthiest General.

The Reputation of this Commonwealth is yet augmented, since that Kings have
accepted the same into confederacy with themselves. For in the year, 1597. was
a Confederacy agreed upon betwixt the King of France, the Queen of England, and
the States of the united Netherlandish Provinces: Yet nevertheless, the States
did so reverence their deposed Prince, that whilst King Philip lived, the
habilities of these Lands contained themselves within the necessity of their
own defense; but after his death was the War more openly manifested, and
that war was sent back again into Spain, which first came from themselves:
Yea, and even unto the very furthermost parts of India is our Trafficque
sailed, being defended with Arms: And in those places also by the occasion of
the common enemy, and by the known valor and fidelity of the Hollanders, is
there occasioned both friendships and Confederacies with Kings and Nations, so
that the Lords the States have been saluted by Ambassadors coming so far as
out of the other world.

Hitherto has the wars continued: There has been often dealing for peace,
both whilst King Philip lived, as since his death. As also, when as the
Netherlands were resigned unto his daughter and son in-law: But ever the States
disdained those conditions, whereby either their Liberty, or that lawful
resolution, which they had justly decreed and pronounced against King Philips
Authority, might any way be impeached or touched; like unto the example of the
Ancient Romans, who never esteemed any Peace so highly, that they therefore
would receive in again the banished Tarquins.

Lastly, when as the Archduke Albertus, and Isabel, and King Philip the Second,
Philips Son, showed themselves to be ready to acknowldge the freedom and
Liberty of the States; then through the Intercession of the Kings of France, of
Great Britain, and of Denmark, and of some other Princes did begin a
communication: And in regard that many difficulties hindered the Peace, there
was lastly in the year 1609 a Truce concluded upon for the space of 12 years,
with a formal Declaration of the Archduke, both in their own names, as also in
the name of King Philip, from whom to that very end, they had received
Commission and procuration, that they should make Truce with the Lords the
States General of the United Provinces, as respecting and holding them to be
in quality of free States of their Lands, Provinces, and Cities, where over
they have nothing to pretend.

This short Relation beginning long before the time of Julius Caesar, and
ending at these times, shows, that continually during more then 1700 years,
the Battavers which now are called the Hollanders, have used the same
Government; the Sovereignty whereof has always remained in the States hands,
and so is it at this present. So that nevertheless, a Principality has
belonged thereunto, sometimes in a greater, and sometimes in a lesser manner of
administration. In former time coming thereunto by Succession, but very often
and at this present by voices, being ever subject under the Laws. This then is
the shape or rather to say, the face of the whole Government.

Now if any man would know all the particular members thereof; They are these
as follows:

Holland is very populous, and exceedingly well stored with Cities and
Villages. The especial care of the Cities is committed to the Senators and
Magistrates of each City, unto whom it is permitted within their own Liberties,
to make certain Laws and Forfeitures, and to ordain certain Impositions for the
Cities necessaries. The Senators are perpetual, The Magistrates are yearly,
having very little or no allowance at all therefore.

Their chief Burgh-masters have their Authority from the higher Magistrates,
for to maintain the good of the Cities, and of the common Burgesses.

The Jurats which are called Schepens, are ordained for the Law, as well over
Civil as over criminal matters, whereof the Baliffs and Scoutes by one
Authority, do serve in that public Office of Plaintiffs or Accusers.

The Magistrates have in their Council, learned Lawyers, called Pensionaires.
The Jurisdiction of the Villages, both as well in the High Lordships called
Hooghe Heerlyecheyden, as also in the Ambachs Heerlycheden, is partly, either
in the Commonwealth, or in the Principality; and partly, in the chief of the
Nobility who have received the same from their Forefathers: The affairs of the
Ambachs Heerleycheden, are commonly decided by the Schouts and the Schepens,
The Hooghe Here lycheyden by the Baliffs and the Tenants, or else by the
Gentility.

Moreover and above, there is the Forresters and the Rangers of the Woods and
Wildernesses; and the Stewards of Noblemens houses have each one their own Laws
concerning Hunting etc. and their own fellow servants: And the Dykegraves and
Heemraden, those that have the Authority over the Seadykes, and the River
bancks, wherein consists the special preservation of Holland, from all these
sentences (excepting in criminal matters, whereof the condemned very seldom
is granted any appeal) they make their appeal unto the Court of Holland, the
which is also acknowledged by Zealand. The controversies of Cities and other
matters of great importance are also decided there.

In this Council according to ancient Custom, does sit certain of the
Nobility, with certain Lawyers and men experienced in all Customs: The chief
head of this Council is the Stadthouder, or the Governor of Holland himself;
who moreover and above has the power to command over the Garrisons, To elect
the Magistrates of the Cities after a former nomination thereof; and also, to
give remission and pardon to Malefactors; all which are tokens of an exceeding
high Authority. There is also a Counting House of the Principalities own proper
Rents and Revenews which is governed by the Rent-Masters.

The Convocation of the States (the chief power whereof they of Holland have)
happens three or four times yearly, or as often as is required.

The State of the Nobility, and of the Gentility is represented, by some
certain, who are the chief thereof, as well in respect of their noble descent,
as of the Lordships which they possess, being in number about twelve, whereof
one of them dying, they choose another unto themselves. The Cities that commonly
send their Deputies unto this Convocation being warned thereunto, are these.
Dordrecht, Haerlem, Delffe, Leyden, Amsterdam, Goude, Rotterdam, Gorchum,
Schiedam, Schoonhoven, Breill, Alckmaer, Horn Enckhuysen, Edam, Monickendam,
Medenblick, Purmerendt. Those that are deputed are commonly Burgh-Masters, now
and then accompanied with some of the Senators, or else pensionary.

The Nobility gives their voice first, then the Cities every one according to
their turns: All this is even now as it was in the days of the Earls,
excepting that the Administration of the public matters which formerly the
Earls performed, is now inherent in the States and in the Governor.

From the aforesaid Court of Holland, there was wont to have been appealed unto
the great Council of Mechlen, which Council in former time, the States of the
several Provinces at the request of the Princes of the House of Bourgondy had
condescended unto, to abide unto that common Law: Instead of this Council, they
of Holland, and of Zealand, about eight and twenty years since, have ordained
the high Council consisting of certain famous learned persons, from whose
sentence there can be no appeal, but yet there may be a supplication presented
unto the States, to the end that certain other Lawyers, Judges or Revisers,
might be added unto that College which might diligently and considerately
peruse and examine whether in that sentence there might be any error or fault.

Moreover since the wars, both the charges, and also the businesses are very
much increased, that in respect thereof, there is yet another College
instituted, to have the survey of the common Treasure of Holland; and to decide
all Controversies arising thence. This College consists of persons which are
deputed thereunto by the Gentility, and by each several City, and are now and
then changed. These do warn the States to assemble as need requires, and do
execute that which the States do decree. There are yet other Deputies
appointed for the surveying of these, which have the hearing of the reckonings
of the Receivers of the common Treasure.

Now since Utrecht continuing still in the union with the other Provinces,
which are Gelderland, Holland, Zealand, Vtrecht, Friesland, Over-Isell and
Groaning, who in former time were all called by the names of the Battavers,
Mattiacks, and Frieses, there has bin a Community or Fellowship both of War,
Peace and foreign Alliances and Confederacies, as also of all other affairs,
they have been alike partakers with each other. These same Provinces are also
accustomed to send their Deputies for the consultation of the general good of
the Lands. This assembly seldom separateth, and are called the general States.
By these, the points that fall into Controversy betwixt the Provinces, are
disputed and decided. The next unto these, and by the same Commission, the
Council of State has the survey of the affairs of the union, and the
Government of the Soldiers, and of the Military businesses. This Council is
come instead of the Council of State, which in the time of the Earls, had the
survey of all the affairs of all the Netherlands.

The Counselors being a certain number, are chosen by the States of each
Province, and also sometimes changed; they give their voices not by the
Provinces as in the Convocation, but man for man: The heads of this Council
are the Governors of the Provinces.

Moreover there is divided in Holland, Zealand, and in Freisland, certain
Colleges of the Admiralty, that look unto the affairs of the Sea, and of the
Customs and Commodities that come out of the Sea; They have their Commission
from the general States; every Province sends their Deputies thither; and now
and then changes them.

The Admirall-ship (which is the highest command at Sea) has Prince* Maurice.

The reckonings of the Cantoor of the generality, are looked unto by certain
persons deputed thereunto.

These things being sufficiently known to the Inhabitants, I have handled the
same more particularly for the use of strangers, not doubting when they shall
have narrowly looked into these matters, but that they shall very much commend
the forms and frames of the Government of this Commonwealth; for if we would
but allege reason hereunto; reason teaches us that Authority is best of all
there, where it is conferred upon the principal best men. If we look about us
concerning the Authority, That Government which consists of the Nobles has
in commendation thereof the wisest in former times. If we look after examples,
we have such as were very worthy and very famous. As of Candy, Lacedemon,
Carthage, Rhodes, Marselles, Thessaly Achaia, Samos, Cnydos, Chio, Corfu, and
as many think even the Romans themselves at such time as they most flourished
in Virtues: Yea, and that which is more, it sufficiently appears that the
Commonwealth of the children of Israel (even as it was ordained of God before
that the people desired a King) was governed by the Nobles: Neither wants
hereunto any fresh examples, as of Ragusa, Luca, Genua, Geneva, and the
principal Cantons of the Swisers, and of Venice, which testify their
stability by the continuance of a thousand years. Hereunto may be added the
whole corporation of the Germane Empire, being full of majesty and estimation;
and many of the Northen Kingdoms, which though they be called Kingdoms, are in
very deed Principalities.

If in case, yet we will prosecute examples that are more near home, The
Sovereignty of the assembly of the States was in use by the ancientest Nation
of the Walloons and of the Brittons; and is yet at this present used in Germany.

For so much as concerns the Government which is administered by the Cities, we
therein agree very well with them of Achaia, Etolia, and Licia, whose
Commonwealth consisting of certain Cities conjoined together, have governed
the same by their Assemblies and by Deputies, whereof that of Achaia is set as
a pattern, and commended by Polybius, Strabo, and Plutarch to be the best
representation of an absolute uniforme Commonwealth.

Also that unto the power of the Nobles be added a Principality, limited with
Laws, that very same is common unto us as it was unto the ancient Israelites,
in the days of the Judges, and unto the Lacedaemonians, and the people of
Achaia, and unto the Venetians, and unto the Germane Empire, and unto the
Northern Kingdoms, as we have said before, and unto many others. The
assembling of the general States, with the Council of State, by whom is
dispatched or decided the common affairs, which concern the union (setting
the Sovereignty of each Province aside) agrees very well with the Amphictiones
Assembly by whose bond the Commonwealths of Grecia, being knit up together,
did for a long time beat back the Medes and all other foreign powers.

In like manner also have they of Ionia with 13 Commonwealths: Those of
Hetruria with twelve, the old Latins with eight and forty Commonwealths. And
in former time many of the Nations of Germany, of the Walloons, and of the
Britains, have had their general Assemblies by virtue of their Confederacy;
and the very like have the Swisers and Grisons to this very day in use.

Now whereas we do very much commend this manner of Government, yet we may nor
will not discommend nor speak against that which is used by another; for we
must confess, that all manner of things are not convenient for all sorts of
people, and that there are many Nations, which serve far better to be under
an absolute Kingly Power, then to be left to their own liberty; in regard
whereof, it was more profitable for the people of Asia to have Kings; and on
the contrary, the Grecians could endure no Kings. Now that this manner whereof
we have been speaking, is the most convenientest for us, the experience of so
many hundred years has testified the same. As long as this continued, all
things went well; but when the contrary was sought, then presently has there
Commotions and troubles arisen, neither were, or could they by any means be
remedied, until that the Government was suited again into her old habit.

Those that have very diligently looked into the several dispositions,
natures, and manners of people, have perceived that those people lying
Northward, and especially adjoining unto the Seacoasts (among whom we are
reckoned) have ever had an antipathy of the absolute authority of one man
only, and have a greater pleasure in their own Liberty. Also there are some
that approve, that great Lands and Kingdoms are best governed by Kings, the
lesser Lands by the common people; but that those Nations which are of an
indifferent greatness, and in special do know how to keep that which they
have well and warily, and not coveting that which is another, are best content
with the Government of the Nobles. Moreover, there must be had great regard
unto the use and customs; for that which is commonly said of all Laws, is
most commonly true in these Laws, wherein the principal point of the
Government consists, that is, That it is better to use such Laws which are
of themselves not the best, then to change and alter those which are received
and have been long practiced.

For it is with Laws even as it is with the Plants, there must be of necessity
time for the establishing and fastening of the Roots; and contrarily, if they be
often removed, they lose their virtue, power, and efficacy.

For this cause are we very much bound unto our Forefathers, who have left
unto us a Government that is very good of it self, and exceeding well agreeing
unto our nature and manner of life, having re-obtained the same by War, and
preserved the same in time of peace.

And this ought to be our endeavors, if we will neither prove unthankful,
nor unprovident, that we constantly maintain that Commonwealth whereunto we
are counseled by Reason, approved by Experience, and recommended by Antiquity.

FINIS.
