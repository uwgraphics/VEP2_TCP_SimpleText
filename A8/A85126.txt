A SALT TEAR: OR, The Weeping Onion, AT THE Lamentable Funeral of Dr.
DORISLAUS.
WHat though Lamented? Cursed; and the High Tree
Of Fifty Cubits was Just Destiny
(Though a Deplored one) of that Agent drew
The Articles against the Holy Jew,
Good Mordicai; which by queint-curious Art,
Should have contrived the Queen Her share oth' smart.
But Providence said, No; And HESTER taught,
Proud HAMAN to a Bloody Banquet brought.
Our upstart Hamans had a Feast: Who Will bring
Them, for Digestions fake, to take a swing.
2.
DORISLAUS! Art' Lamented? So was He
Who was more Dives* then the State made thee.
If thou chance meet with Him; Lift up thine eyes,
And see where CHARLES in Abraham's bosom lies.
O for a Messenger the House to tell
And all the merry Commoners, of Hell.
How LENTHAL looks! How WHITLOCK pales his face,
Who caught one Seal, and lost that Seal of Grace!
O how damned BRADSHAW quivers as he comes!
And FAIRFAX groans! And CRUMWELL bites his thumbs!

Egypt, no doubt, was hid in double black,
When that last Wonder, and grand Land-Sea wrack
Was powered on Pharao and his Host; when Waves
Revenged the Insolence of Murderous Slaves,
Pharao must drown; so it does Providence Please.
We have a MOSES too, is Heir oth' Seas
Heavens will a Party in that Element make:
Your KING-SALE Projects do not always take.

The Wife of SISERA did no doubt bewail,
Sisera's Face; yet the Canonized Nail
And Hammer of stout Jael and the Song
Of Deborah showed Heaven smiled, and went along.
A Kenite did the fact: it was not Lot
For Perjured English, But a gallant Scot.
It Is a good Omen: That, as They Pulled down
The FIRST, they shall set on the SECOND'S Crown
Let our deluded Citizens invite,
Hug, Kiss, and Lick the Cursed Canaanite:
What though their Chariots be of Iron? we may
See them lie Grovelling, like lost Sisera.
5
Now Pray observe the Pomp, the Persons, State
That did attend This Alien Reprobate:
Here, went Lieutenant General Crocodile,
And's Cubbs, bred of the Slime of our Rich Nile:
Who weep before they kill, and whose False Tears
Trickle from Bloodshed eyes of Murderers.
Poor Island! they have made a Nile of Thee,
We cannot find thy HEAD, which feign we would see.
6.
Next march a train of Ravenous wolves, whose jaws
Yet owze with the blood of slaughtered King and Laws:
These are close Mourners; These the Kingdoms gull:
True Wolves, that never Howl, till they are full.
These are the Beasts of Prey, whose sharp Fang Tears
Not Cavies now, but the Harmless Levellers;
By whom they rose unto this Greatness: We,
We are distasted, well as Monarchy.
7.
Close unto these, in grave Deportment March
The City Changelings in Thanksgiving starch,
A sort of Whelps, Taught by that Woolvish kind;
Who if one Howled, strait the whole Kennell whin'd.
These, at the Whip of cunning oliver,
Do Feast, or else drop a dissembling Tear.
All these attend their AGENTS Funeral;
This Honor' s but a Trap, the States fly call,
To get another throat cut, but in vain;
Dorislaw cries from Hell;
'TWILL BE NO GAIN.
