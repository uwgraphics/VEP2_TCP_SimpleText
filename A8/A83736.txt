Die Mercurii: 5o Maii. 1641.
IT is this day ^^dered by the House of Commons now assembled in Parliament,
That the Preamble, together with the Prot^^ation, which the Members of this
House made the third of May, shall be forthwith Printed* and the Copie^ Printed
brought to the Clark of the said House, to attest under his hand, to the end
that the Knights* Citiz^s, and Burgesses may send them down to the Sheriffs and
Justices of Peace of the several Shi^s, and to the Citizs and Burgesses of the
several Cities, Boroughs, and Cinque Ports, respectively. And (...) Knights,
Citiz^^s, and Burgesses, are to intimate unto the Shires, Cities, Boroughs, and
Cinque Ports, with what willingne^^ all the Members of this House made this
Protestation: And further to signify, that as they justify the taking of it
in themse^^s, so they cannot but approve it in all such as shall take it.

WE the Knight Citizens, and Burgesses of the Commons house in Parliament,
finding, to the great grief of our ^earts, that the designs of the Priests and
Jesuits, and other Adherents to the Sea of Rome, have (...) late been more
boldly and frequently put in practice then formerly, to the undermining and
danger (...) the ruin of the true reformed Protestant Religion in His
Majesty's Dominions established: A^^ ^inding also that there have been, and
having just cause to suspect that there still are, even during this (...)ting
in Parliament, endeavors to subvert the fundamental Laws of England and
Ireland, a^^ to introduce the exercise of an Arbitrary and Tyrannical
Government, by most pernicious and wicked Coun^^s, Practices, Plots, and
Conspiracies: And that the long intermission* and unhappy breach of
Parliaments, h^^h occasioned many illegal Taxations, whereupon the Subject
has been prosecuted and grieved: And that di^^rs Innovations and Superstitions
have been brought into the Church; multitudes driven out of His Majesti
Dominions, Iealousies raised and fomented betwixt the King and His people, a
Popish Army leavied in Ireland, ^^d two Armies brought into the bowels of this
Kingdom, to the hazard of His Majesty's Royal Person, the co^umption of the
Revenues of the Crown, and Treasure of this Kingdom: And lastly, finding great
cause of Jealousy, that endeavors have been, and are used to bring the English
Army into a misunderstanding of this Parl^^ment, thereby to incline that Army,
with force to bring to pass those wicked Councels, Have therefore thought ^^od
to join our selves in a Declaration of our united Affections and Resolutions,
and to make this ensuin^ Protestation.

I A. B. do ^n the presence of Almighty God, Promise, Vow, and Protest, to
maintain and defend, as far as lawfully I may, with my life, power, and estate,
the true Reformed Protestant Religion, expressed ^n the Doctrine of the Church
of England, against all Popery and Popish Innovations within th^s Realm,
contrary to the same Doctrine, and according to the duty of my Allegiance, His
Maj^^ties Royal Person, Honor, and Estate; As also the Power and Privileges
of Parliament; The lawful Rights and Liberties of the Subject, and every
person that makes this Protestation, in whatsoever he shall do in the ^awfull
pursuance of the same. And to my power, and as far as lawfully I may, I will
oppose, and by all good ways and means endeavor to bring to condign
punishment, all such as shall either by Force, Practice, Counc^^s, Plots,
Conspiracies or otherwise, do any thing to the contrary of any thing in this
present Protestation contained. And further, that I shall in all just and
Honorable ways endeavor to preserve the Union and Peace between the three
Kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland; And neither for hope, fear, nor
other respect, shall relinquish this Promise, Vow, and Protestation.

Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty: And by the Assigns of John Bill. 1641.
