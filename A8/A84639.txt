An Unhappy VIEW OF THE Whole behavior of my Lord Duke of BUCKINGHAM, AT THE
French Island, called the Isle of RHEE

Discovered By Colonel William Fleetwood, an unfortunate Commander in that
untoward SERVICE.

LONDON, Printed for R. Smith. 1648.

AN Unhappy view of the whole behavior of my Lord Duke of Buckingham, at the
French Island, called the Island of REE.
AT a private assembly at the Council Table by the King and the Lords, and to
extinguish the ignominy of the former service of Cales, an attempt into France
was concluded on, and the Duke designed for General, who took the honor
indifferently gladly, presuming to recover his lost honor and credit by his
own Prowess in his Exploit.

Hereupon began a strong press of Soldiers, so large a provision of Victuals,
and other maintenance for them, as could not but in common reason promise a
boon voyage to come, if the intent were closely carried.

But before any Soldiers were imbarqued, the Duke ouc of an evil will to the
weal-publique, divulged the plot at Court very freely, without any fear or
wit, whereby the worst of our ill-willers wheresoever (taking but the pains to
address themselves thither) might know al for an easy attention, which must
needs be half a prevention of the hopes in question.

Upon the point of our first setting to Sea, the Duke out of a distrust of some
miserable death that might befall himself in the voyage, as of the
consideration of being for a time estranged from his effeminate pleasures here
at home, from which no warlike service could ever withdraw him, would
willingly have relinquisht his Charge; without any allegation, either of the
weakness, unexperience, or insufficiency of his own person, but that he was
pricked and spurred on to it afresh, by the only persuasion of his Majesty: For
that the eyes of all the Troops, were fixed on him for their Chieftain.

Upon this we put forth to Sea, and inclined our selves by the Dukes direction
to the Island of Rhee, or St. Martins.
Where, as well every Mechanic and common Soldiers, as Captains, and
Colonels in our Company, knew, where our Journey was to end. But, Lord! the
Dukes carriage at Sea was obstinate and ridiculous, and altogether backward to
his faith and credit, laid to pawn here at home in his absence; for whatsoever
the circumspect Commanders under him had propounded, as behoovefull, he would
be sure to gainsay it, under a vile penalty, to command, that no Invention
should be so much as set on foot, but what proceeded from his study and
approbation, so to be wholly enriched and dignified with the Attribute of
compassing all the good fortune that could any way attend the Enterprise, as he
now, contrariwise, surfeits of the disgrace.

The Islanders, through the largenes of the Dukes tongue, being too inquisitive
after their fortifications of diverse plaguie Passengers at Sea, were acquainted
with our meanings, long before they saw us, and we arrived not there without an
unlucky expectation, and entertainment.

After we had viewed the Fort and Situation, we began to demand of the Duke,
wherein our Country could be advantaged, by suppressing such a vast strong,
ill-favored place, in that the maintenance thereof after our conquest, would
yearly expend very near as much, as the profit could amount unto.

To this he replied, that through his own Entreaty, upon His Majesty's Signing
of his Commission, he was only put upon this Island, which, if he should but
recover, at his return, it would redeem all his lost honor at home; and so
commanded us to entrench our selves.

We all being confident, that the Expression could not but proceed from an
undaunted heart, some of us presently in a desperate manner, went on shore
(expecting the Duke and his Retinue at our heels) where we were suddenly
unawares encountered very sharply by some Troops of French Horsemen (which by
means that the Duke kept at Sea, and came not in to our succor) so oppressed
us with their multitude, that many of our company in our return to our ships,
were hewn to pieces, or drowned in the water, as Sir William Hayden, Mr. Temple
of Lincoln Inn, and many other of good parentage.

The third day after the repulse, we renewed our strength, and went all again
on shore, and there fortified our selves for our most advantage, and in short
time after, so furiously summoned the Island, that the Inhabitants were
constrained to retire to their Fort, as their last refuge, to the gates whereof
we pursued them with great terror, and took some prisoners.

Then perceiving the strength and compass of the Fort, and understanding that
it was well Victualled for a lingering Siege, we recoyled back, and entrenched
our selves anew from the annoy of their Cannon, and by degrees we came at last
to inviron it almost round (as far as it was any way needful) and yet kept out
of the danger of their Ordinance still, and for a good while deprived them of
all succors, both by Sea and land, and so planted our Battery.

Thus far we sped indifferently well, having, in recompense of our first
overthrow, gained the Island, and put our selves in possession of it.

The honor and applause whereof detesteth the Duke and his best merits in the
whole action, and, next under God, reflects on the Ever-having fame and memory
of that Right Valiant, and Heroique Gentleman Sir John Burrows, by whose only
reach it was compassed, and whole act herein, since in a calm season, he was
afterward trecherously slain, deserves, if one may say so without presumption,
to immortallize his Soul.

The Fort now remaining unyeelded, and standing betwixt us and a reasonable
Conquest, by the powerful and searching persuasion of Sir John Burrows, as
well common Soldiers as Captains protested to have too, or else to dye in the
field, which promise, the very Flower of all our Commanders there, were
enforced in the end to make good, to the very effusion of their dearest blood:
And thus we continued our Battery for above two months space; and yet in all
that time, through the extraordinary strength of the place, by reason of the
Rampires, and Barracadoes, that the defendants had new erected within, we could
make no breach, nor take other opportunity to give an assault.

Whereupon for that our provision held out well, it was determined by Sir John
Burrowes (whose weakest advise at this time, the multitude were readier to
follow than the best of the Dukes) that we should beleagure the round Fort
still as we had begun, and without a surrender thereof by a long seige, should
starve up the defendants, and (all things considered) this was the only way to
surprise so impregnable a place.

The Duke was infinitely incensed with this sway of Sir John-Burrowes, and his
own neglect, and therefore by degrees he endeavored to allure the hearts of
the Soldiers from him, which bare words could not do, nor bring to pass till
he privately had distributed to some of them assenting, the pay of the rest
discenting, whereupon such a murmuring discontent arose betwixt the faction of
Sir John Burrowes and the Duke, that had not Sir John suddenly quieted all by
his wisdom, we had certainly mutined amongst our selves to all our confusion,
and so have given the Enemy an occasion of advantage, but they seemed to be
reconciled, and new celebrated the amity, the same night, by a private Supper
in the Dukes Tent

But such is the malice of a vindicative heart, that it is never appeased, but
remains still inexorable and devilish.

For the next morning Sir John Burrows (according to his daily wont) surveying
his own Trenches and being clear out of all danger of the Fort, was in an
instant stricken dead in the place with a musket, shot by an unknown hand, and
so gives up his spotless soul into the joys of Heaven, that had never done
but good on earth.

The news and manner of this bred a new hurly burley in the Camp, and ready
we were to dye again upon each others swords, but through fresh rewards from
the Duke to some, and Lord like means to other some that had been formerly
rewarded, all were once more quieted, and our provision was much lessened,
whereupon my Lord of Holland was sent to for our releife but came not.

About this time there was news, that the French King approached with releife
for the Fort, and to raise our seig whereupon the Duke for the safeguard of his
own person (whereas his retinew were the strongest already, withdrew two of the
best Regim. from the sure places where Sir John Burrows had formerly allotted
them for his own defense in particular, and so left al manlesse, which the
French Convoyes perceiving, entered there the same night, and releived the Fort
in abundance both with fresh soldier and provision, and so nightly for a week
together came under our noses with the like stuff, and yet the Duke would not
suffer us to encounter them, pretending that he feared the French King at his
back; when (alas) there was neither King nor French Army there.

When the Fort was as well manned as victualed, the defendants began diverse
times to confront and brave us, before their maine sally out, yet this our
General would neither permit us to encounter them, nor at last to continue our
battery, so that in a very discontented manner we lay idle, riotously consuming
the remainder of His Majesty's allowance, without attempting any thing worth
the while: Insomuch that I my self impartially demanded of the Duke what he
would do with us, whether he longed to inthrall us to his own ignoble
pleasure, or to starve us up instead of the defendants, but could draw no other
answer from him, but that he was our General, and so we should know it by the
strict hand he would carry over us.

And for our further proceedings against the Fort, we should go on in our
idleness till we heard further from him.

We that were Colonels and prime Officers under him could hardly brook this
his untoward carirage (as raw meat on our stomachs) yet for quietness sake, to
repel mutenies in the Camp, we smothered our grudge, without any appearance of
heart burning to the multitude, and so lay expecting a miserable success of
all our undertakings. Afterward the Duke told us, that he had secret
intelligence out of the Fort, that most of their best Soldiers had conveied
themselves away by night, for fear of a new supply by my Lord of Holland, and
that the Remnant (if we lay still intrencht) would shortly become our Vassals,
which news being confirmed with as large protestations as could proceed from
the heart of any Christian man, made us so far to credit him, as to lie
secure, and to presume, that this, once done, would make us all as happy, as
our confidence in his word, could any ways make us miserable by the contrary.

The very next morning after this consultation, which fell out to be the day of
doom to most of us, the Duke being sensible of his perfideous dealings, and
that was the day the Defendants would encounter us to death, notwithstanding
what his engagement for our safety had formerly bin to the contrary, privily in
his Tent, by the help of his faction; attired one of his own followers, every
way much resembling himself, in his warlike habit and colors, with
instructions suitable to the deceit, and then disguised, as a faint and
impotent soldier, got himself a Shipboard, and not only left us ignorant of
the bloody intent toward us, but also made us incapable to prevent it, when we
should.

Immediately upon this, we suspecting as little this treachery (as that which
came of it) the defendants numberless sallied out, and with such violence, and
fury assailed us in our Trenches (they taking most of us unarmed, and daunted
with the sight of the multitude) that we were glad to fly for our lives.

Which retreat cost most of us our lives (as the assault and both fell out in
the end) to make up a conquest to the French, and an absolute overthrow to us.

The wildness of my Lord Mountjoyes horse was the cause of his surprizall, and
as well of the death of some of our own men, for that he not only avoided the
Enemies charge, but confusedly ran upon, and beat back diverse of our best
horses, which otherwise to the very death would have stood it out

In our flight we aimed at a certain narrow bridge, over agreat River, which if
we could have recovered and passed, we had stopped the pursuit of our Enemies,
but through their policy we were prevented by their overturning a loded Cart
there beforehand which we must either climb over, or leap into the River, or
salt pits, which most of our Company being unable to do, were instantly hewn
in pieces, Sir Charles Rich and others of great esteem, who in the very deadly
extremity were offered quarter; but would not, rather choosing to dye
honorably, then longer to live with infamy and torment, I my self perceiving
the folly of resisting any longer, having one of the best Horses in the
Company, was forced to take an infirm Salt-pit, where both my self and my
horse stuck fast in the ground, and where I had suddenly a gashly wound in the
leg with a Bullet, and so I lay struggling for life, Lord, Lord, (me thought)
what pain it was to dye so, and diverse of our Company and Commanders were in
the like distress, But in the end the French horsemen, wanting shot to reach
us in the water, by the valiancy of the poor remainder of our soldiers, that
were gotten over the Cart, we were dragged a shore, and so being at that time
unpursued, were conveyed out of danger.

During the time of our conflict, our counterfeit General fought very
resolutely, and got a gash or two in his shoulder for his pains and labor,
which (before we knew the deceit) made us, notwithstanding our losses, to
commend him for a valourous Commander, but through the Dukes back wardnes, some
of those that were trusted with the knowledge of this Villainy, we understood it
all in two days after, in our comfortless journey homewards, and we had
thereupon presently mortalized his carcass for amends, but that, upon a more
mature deliberation, we thought it fitter to let him die at home, by the
inquestionable hand of the Parliament, so he himself could not take this as his
preservation, but as his reservation to a more infamous end. And truly should
the revenge of the Parliaments almost extremity seize upon him, it would be but
correspondent to his merits, that would find in his heart to lie secure
himself, and all the while to see us, that were his charge, knocked down, and
slaughtered like dogs: O let him go to the grave and let no man stay him, for
it is a sin to pity him in his worst estate.

My Lord Mountjoy, was the only man of note of our party, that accepted
Quarter, and was since very honorably ransomed, and sent home again, which
proceeded more from the Heroique clemency of the French King, then for any
desert, either of his own or ours.

One of our French prisoners that we have taken at our first encounter,
confessed to me, in our return homewards, that had Sir John Burrowes lived one
two days longer, the Defendants were concluded to have given up the Fort, and
all the treasure in it, to our disposure, in respect they had so miserable
experience of his vigilant intercepting of all their convoyes, and stopping of
their passages; And therefore this reach could not but redownd to their utter
confusion in the end, unless they submitted themselves betimes, but the news
of his death was joyous unto them, as it was grievous unto us, and made them
resolve to dye in their own defenses, but the mistake at last cost most of us
our lives.

And this is the whole description of our misfortunes, which upon a due
consideration (I think) must needs provoke the poorest affected of our nation,
to endeavor a revenge to be done; In all our future Voyages, he must and will
be still our General, and then to thrive (at least) after the old fashion, we
must assure our selves.

We have not been a little famous in France, for Conquest heretofore with a
few, but God Almighty is omnipotent and just, and we now see it is his
pleasure, to make us all to suffer for the sin and lascivious life of this one
man: His will be done in all.

And if we can, we must be content (besides too notwithstanding) he has been
the death of diverse of the nobility, the unlucky overthrow of all our late
voyages.

The unknown consumer of our Treasury, and the utter confusion of the poor
Protestants in France, now daily massacred without all pity, through their
needless defense of their Religion.

Yet it is the Kings pleasure still to afford him his wonted grace and
connivance for all this; And Treason it is apparent to denounce him faulty in
any thing; But let his Majesty look to it, for his longer sheltring of this
rich Traitor, and false-hearted man, both to God and his Country, which will be
the ruin both of himself and his kingdom at last, yet then I have hope (out of
the integrity of his heart, now whilst it is called to day, and before the
evil day come) he will give him over to the Parliament, whilst it is of
strength to punish him; And that they for their parts will send him to H.
without any more ado.

If any hereafter shall malign, or go about to disprove me in any one of
these points (so I may be unquestionable for this presumption) I will,
notwithstanding my lamenesse, maintain all upon notice to his face, to the
expense of my dearest blood; In the interim, I expect good news from the
Parliament, by the next fair wind.

FINIS.
