A merry Dialogue between Thomas and John. In the praise, and dispraise of
Women, and Wine*
Thomas against the Women does contend,
But John most stoutly does their cause defend,
Young and Old, read these lines that ensue,
You Will all confess that which I write is true,
I know no reason, but that without despute,
This may as well be printed, as sung to the Lute
To a gallant delightful new Tune, well known amongst Musitianers, and in
Play Houses, called, Women and Wine.



Thomas. SOme Women are like to the Wine,
like the Sea, and like the Rocks;
But they yt proves them, soon may find them
like the Wine and VVeather-Cocks:
But if you will believe me
I Will tell you true,
What light Women are like untoo,
Wine, Wine, Women and Wine,
thus may you compare them too,

John. Women most constant Man do find,
not like the Sea, but like the Rocks,
They are evermore loving and kind,
not like the Wine and Weather-Cocks
But if, etc.

Thomas. Women have hooks, and Women have crooks
so has the Wine, so has the Wine,
Which draws great Lawyers from their Books
so will ye Wine, so will ye Wine.
But if, etc.

John. Women have beauty and fair looks,
so has the Wine, so has the Wine,
Far surpassing the Lawyers books
more then ye Wine, more then ye Wine
But if you will believe me,
I Will tell you true,
What good Women are like untoo,
Wine, Wine, Women and Wine,
thus may you compare them too.



Thomas. Women are witches when they may
so is the Wine, so is the Wine
which causes men from their wives to stray
so will the Wine, so will the Wine.
But if you will believe me
I Will tell you true,
What light Women are like untoo,
Wine, Wine, Women and Wine,
thus may you compare them untoo.

John. Women are witty when they may,
so is not Wine, so is not Wine,
And causes Men at home to stay,
so does not Wine, so does not Wine.
But if, etc.

Thomas. Women have arms for to embrace.
so has the Wine, so has the Wine,
Which brings brave Gallants to disgrace
so does the Wine, so does the Wine.
But if,

John. Women most sweetly do embrace,
more then the Wine, more then ye Wine
And save their Husbands from disgrace,
so does not Wine, so does not Wine,
But if, etc.

Thomas. Women's tongues are like sharp Swords,
so is the Wine, so is the Wine,
Which urges men to swear damned Oaths
so does the Wine, so does the Wine,
But if, etc.

John. Women's tongues do speak sweet words,
so does not Wine, so does not Wine,
They can persuade from damned Oaths,
so will not Wine, so will not Wine.
But if, etc.

Thomas. Women they do use to change,
so does the Wine, so does the Wine,
And often times abroad do Range,
when Sun does shine, when Sun does shine
But if, etc.

John. Good women they will nev^r change,
so will the Wine, so will the Wine
For profit they abroad will range,
Hail Rain or Shine, Hail or Shine
But if, etc.

Thomas. Women they will fight and brawl,
filled with Wine, filled with Wine,
Their Husbands they will Cuckholds call
inflamed with Wine, inflamed with Wine
But if, etc.

John. Good women they will comfort all,
like the best Wine, like the best Wine,
What ever sorrow does be fall,
so will good Wine, so will good Wine.
But if you will believe me,
I Will tell you true,
What good Women are like untoo,
Wine, Wine, Women and Wine,
thus you may compa^e them too.
