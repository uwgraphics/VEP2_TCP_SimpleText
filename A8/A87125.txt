A Translate of a LETTER FROM Don Lewis de Harro
Chief Counselor and Minister of State to his Majesty of Spain sent unto the
King of Scots at Brussels concerning the affairs in England, publication of
the Articles of Peace and Marriage with France, etc.
May it please your Majesty,
SInce it has pleased the Almighty Lord thus to bless and crown your Majesty
with patience in long sufferings, in which you have been a strict observer of
those graces, precepts and qualities so eminent in your Royal Father, that even
his and your greatest enemies are driven to confess, that amidst the multitude
of your thoughts (as the Psalmist delivers it) Gods comforts does delight your
soul, And whilst evil men who are the tormentors in this life solace
themselves with all your earthly pleasures, it is your greatest care to
preserve and keep unto your self the Testimony of a good conscience, which will
ever surmount and triumph above all the adversities of this lower world, and at
last that furious zeal which has now Dominion in your Kingdoms, will burn, and
as a Canker at the root of their hopes shall destroy your opposers; from hence
great Sir, the Nations murmr, and your faith in those long sufferings gives
you firm hopes that the day of your Redemption is nigh, for this never fails in
the consent of all Nations, vox populi, vox Dei: And therefore since God has
showed unto the people a mark of his high displeasure by your Exile, they are
upon return, by which your Majesty is encouraged to say Amen. But this is not
altogether my Affair, The transact promulgation of the Articles of Peace and
Marriage with his Majesty of France is unalterably true, And what therein
concerns your Majesty is also decreed, as I hope has already in part appeared
by the present Forces of your own Subjects drawn out by your Majesty's
Servants, and if need require there is other helps designed for you, yet
finding an unwillingnesse in your Council to Alarm your Countries with
Forraigners (if possibly avoided) I must forbear to urge the kindness of my
Master, otherwise there had been a freedom answerable to your Majesty's (I am
sorry that I have occasion to say) necessities, which indeed is rather a shame
to your own Subjects, of whom the Heathens can with some remorse discourse, and
amongst the Christians under his Catholic Majesty (although there wants union
with you in matters of religious worship) you are pitied in that the foundation
is laid in Christ our Lord; Let your enemies therefore fear and tremble as in
the presence of the Lord, for the justness of your cause heightens my belief
of their Astonishment. And were it not for their present interest in ill gotten
goods; I dare positively affirm there were no Enemy to give you battle, but
the wonder is at an end in that such as these are foretold by that unerring
Spirit in the Prophets and Apostles, which says, That Covetousness is the
root of all evil. In conclusion the forwardness of this dispatch is occasioned
through great desires of yielding any thing which may contribute to your
Majesty's consolation: Pure and entire affections are pardonable, although
hastily scattered before Princes, and in confidence of that I can as well hope
for as plead my excuse. His Majesty's Congratulations followed with all the
Ambassadors, Counselors, Commanders, Ministers of State, and Monsiur Le Prince
are amply in this express declared as a demonstration of great joy for your
Majesty's hopeful Restoration: And that your success may fill the world with
admiration, and convince all Subjects of that sin, is the prayer of him who is
in great truth,

1659. Your Majesty's most humble and faithful servant, Lewis de Harro.
