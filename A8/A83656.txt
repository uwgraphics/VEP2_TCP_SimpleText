Die Sabbathi, 27. May, 1643.
THe Commons being informed that many Soldiers listed, and in pay under the
command of the Lord General, the Earl of Essex, do daily withdraw themselves
to the great prejudice of the present service, and to the disturbance of the
most of the county whither they do resort, Do order that the Deputy
Lievtenants, Constables, and other head Officers, or any one or more of them,
of every County where any such Soldier or Soldiers shall be found, do
forthwith cause him or them to be apprehended, examined, and imprisoned, and
with all convenient speed shall cause such Soldier or Soldiers to be safely
conveyed at the charge of the County to the Lord General, or to such Captain
from under whose command he shall have so withdrawn himself. And it is further
ordered that all Captains, and Officers of Trained-Bands and Volunteers, And
all Head-officers, Constables, and all other persons whatsoever, shall be
ayding and assisting to the said Deputy-Leivtenants and Justices of the Peace,
or any one or more of them in execution of the premises, as they will answer
the contrary at their peril.

Ordered by the Commons assembled in Parliament, That this ORDER be forthwith
printed and pubished.
