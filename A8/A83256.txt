AN ORDINANCE OF The Lords and Commons in Parliament for the safety and defense
of the Kingdom of ENGLAND, and Dominion of WALES.
WHereas there has been of late a most dangerous and desperate design upon the
House of Commons, Which we have just cause to believe to be an effect of the
bloody Counsels of Papists, and other ill affected Persons, who have already
raised a rebellion in the Kingdom of Ireland. And by reason of many
discoveries, we cannot but fear they will proceed, not only to stir up the
like rebellion and insurrections in this Kingdom of England, but also to back
them with Forces from abroad.
