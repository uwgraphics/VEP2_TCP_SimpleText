Die Mercurii, 19. July, 1643.
THE Lords and Commons assembled in Parliament, out of the deep sense of Gods
heavy wrath now upon this Kingdom, and more particularly manifested by the
late discomfeiture of the Forces, both in the North and in the West; Have for
themselves resolved to set apart and keep, and do ordain, and command* That
Friday the 21. of this present July, 1643. be set apart and kept as a day of
public and extraordinary humiliation by Prayer and Fasting, throughout the
Cities of London and Westminster, and the Suburbs, and places adjacent, within
the Bills of Mortality; That every soul may bitterly bewail his own sins,
and the sins of the whole Nation, And cry mightily to God for Christ his
sake, that he will be pleased to turn from the fierceness of his wrath, and
heal the Land. And the Lord Mayor of the City of London, is hereby required to
give present order for the due performance of this Order.

To the Gentleman* Usher, or his Deputy, to be delivered to the Lord Mayor of
the City of London.
Jo. Brown Cleric. Parliamentorum.
