LONDON, Printed by T. FAUCET, Aug. 5. 1642.

NEver has any Kingdom or Country been blessed with so flourishing an estate,
and such a blessed condition, the security of whose Peace, and the durance of
whose happiness, has always preserved them both from the hostility of a
foreign Foe, and the annoyance of an intestine Enemy; nay which is more, let
us unfold all the secrets of Antiquity, and J believe it will be very difficult
to any one Prince whose Reign (if it were of any considerable number of
years) has proved so fortunate as to be totally free from homebred
Conspirators or foreign Enemies. But if ever any State has enjoyed Peace,
security and Liberty, it has bin that of England, if ever any Church has
attained to Uniformity, Sincerity and Truth, it has been the Church of
England, this having bin long free from the blindness of Ignorance, the
erroneousnesse of Heresy, and the folly of Superstition, that, from the
cruelty of War, the mischief of danger, and the unsufferable irksomeness of
Slavery. So that the State being blessed in pious Princes and loyal Subjects,
the Church in learned Teachers and religious People, they were both in
themselves happy and of others admired, so much does the Unity of a Nation
conduce to the tranquillity thereof; But never is the Devil more busy then
when he sees how hard his labor is, many ways did that Machiavill use to unty
that Gordian knot, first he tryes his skill abroad, and from Spain he brings
us Enemies to fright us out of our so long in^oyed Security: But by the
indulgent Providence of God and the never-yeelding valor of our Sea Captains,
they did once again by sad experience find what mettle the English were made
of, and what Noble blood flowed in their full veins; For no sooner had they
given Battle, but they were conquered no sooner had they approached our
English Coasts but they were all scattered, and brought to the worst of
misfortunes to entreat us for Succor, whose Destruction they had before
threatened and were come to perform their promise, made in as ill a time as
with bad success performed. For in stead of Misery they brought us Happiness,
in stead of Poverty the treasure of their own. Spoils, in the place of
Ignominy the glorious names of Undaunted Soldiers.

Since this Plot was defeated the next must be more subtle, and come even from
our own bowels, Suis est ipsa viribus rue^, we must be our own Enemie^ or
else never miserable, then must the State be vexed with unheard of Taxes, and
griping Monopolies, and the Church too that it might share in the others
m^series with usurping Rulers, and proud Governors, starving the Souls of the
flock to pamper their own bodies and leaving out the chief points of
Religion while they fast^n upon us unnecessity Ceremonies. Th s had better
success then the form r, and for some time to the g iefe of the Subjects did
continue, but straight the cause of both diseases being by skillful Physicians
looked into, the Cure was found out and prescribed; which Physicians were this
present Parliament who have happily begun to remedy those over grown Diseases,
and have because some would admit of no other Cure cut them off. But now that
Enemy to Peace has us d the utmost of his skill and by his base Enemies the
Malignant Spirits, lest this happy means should proceed, has set a
differen^e betwixt the King and Parliament, seeking to make that our Misery
which was sought out for our Remedy, but the continuance of Gods Providence,
and the industrious care of this Honorable Parliament, will I hope ere long
consound his devices, and be a happy means, whereby we may recover our former
Glory, Peace, and Felicity, in the mean time let us confide in their Wisdom,
and not rashly go about to gain those Good ends by so bad a Medium as that of
Civil war. For we must not expect that the happiness which after it may be
enjoyed, which is doubtful, will countervaile the Miseries that in the
attayning of it we shall certainly endure, that therefore we may the more
ab^o^re it, and use all means to prevent it, I shall according to my ability
set down the Nature, danger and cause of it, and the means to avoid it.

How miserable that Nation is which is entangled with any kind of War, we may
easily see if we look back into the former ages, and into the lam^ntable
conditions of those Countries which have been the Stages of that Tragedy:
Ancient writers do abundantly restifie by their full descriptions, how
flourishing, rich, stately, and Victorious that great City of Troy had (before
the subversion of it) always been, but by the savage cruelty of a (...) war,
it was made so miserable, that it was neither great, nor yet a City, but a
ruinous heap of stones, an unhappy sign of what it had been, and as says the
Poet, Versa est intinere. --

To come nearer how great and glorious, how happy and peaceable, how feared and
admired have the Jews been, whose Character it once was to be Gods peculiar
People; their Territories were as large, their Walls as high, their Palaces as
stately as any Nations in the whole Universe, nay their Temple alone (such was
the beauty of it, such the riches) would have bought many a whole Kingdom, and
yet what miseries did they many years together endure in their long siege for
want of Food, for want of water, for want of all things, and all this for the
want of this one thing Peace, their Cities and Temples were burned to Ashes,
themse^ves taken Captives, and miserably butchered nay they were scorned of
other Nations (to whom they had once been a terror) for that (so poorly were
they esteemed) no less then 30 Jews were sold for one penny, these were
foreign Wars.

To come nearer yet, to what a lamentable estate is all Germany reduced, what
miseries has it endured? Nay what has it not endured by foreign and home
bred enemies together? Let us consider what civil Wars have wrought in them,
and to them must we needs be compared, if amongst us (as amongst them there
have) civil dissentions should arise.

Nay let us come so near as to our selves, to those at least which should be
as dear unto us as our selves, our poor distressed brethren in Ireland, whose
manifest wrongs and grievous calamities, do cry to Heaven for vengeance
against those enemies to peace and Religion the most wicked Papists, of whose
cruelty, Idolatry and Antichristian Impiety, what Nation is there that is not
sensible? A people so execrably cruel, that they make it a point of Religion
and a work meritorious to murder Gods people under the name of Heretics, what
misery; slavery, tyranny, nay what death, nay what horrid kind of death these
men our poor brethren do endure, under these other men (if I may call them by
so good a name as men) our and their enemies? some loose their Lands, some
their liberties, some both, others with both their lives and estates, and happy
is he that with loss of estate can escape, can these men be as they pretend
Gods people; when by their ungodly, nay unmanly actions they prove themselves
no be of more then Turkish cruelty.

My pen cannot speak in a dialect sad enough the ones misfortune and the
others insulting tyranny, these and more then these are the mishaps which
befall a Land infected with civil War which of all wars is most dangerous
and pernicious, in the other we are made miserable by our enemies in this our
friends are our enemies, in that we may be prosperous, in this we must needs be
miserable, those are undertaken of necessity, this is begun by treachery pride,
cruelty, oppression, and a number more of horrid crimes, and ends in confusion
and destruction, all contribute and lend aid against our open enemies, when we
are at wars with our selves who can be safe? or who secure? Victory being
here a Misery, and Conquest an Overthrow, he alone thinks himself safe, who
sees none survive to molest him and who is happy but bankrouts, ferlorne and
desperate men, and those whose fortunes can be raised no other way, and such
men are, as the greatest offenders for the greatest causes of such broils and
dissentions, for none but the enemies of the Commonwealth will disturb its
peace or seek its ruin, these are the Incendiaries in a Kingdom, these cannot
endure that there should be wholesome Laws to punish Delinquents, for then
themselves would not escape, but they breed variance, invent Plots, foment
Jealousies and all to distract, disturb, and if they could quite overturne the
Republike, and with such sugared language and subtle carriage do they infuse
their gilded poisons, and sweetened infections into those that cherish them,
that for the present they suppose them their greatest friends choicest
Counselors who will at last prove themselves their most dangerous enemies,
and it is no small point of these men's policy by all ways possible to reader
those odious and contemptible to the common people, whose only end it is to
settle peace and procure the happiness of the people.

To the wicked insinuations and mischievous practices of these men must we
needs attribute the unhappiness of our present condition and that such may
receive condign punishment for their base actions, we should as in our
Protestation we are bound to use all lawful means, peace being that which
every good Subject does desire, and these men being the soarest enemies to a
well-setled peace; nor is it the mischief alone of Civil war to divide a
Land against it self which is misery enough but it is also a sinister cause of
introducing foreign enemies a so taking his best occasion by the weakness
of his foe to insult over him, and then who knows not that enemies abroad and
enemies at home must needs bring a Land to the lowest depth of a most desperate
misery, but let us not be so busied in deploring the sad case of it as not to
seek a timely remedy for it, for if this be not prevented who amongst us can
say he has a House, Land, a Wife, Children, nay who can safely say he has a
Life, so uncertain and in so great danger will all things hang. Another let to
unity, and that a great one too are the unhappy differences betwixt the King
and his Parliament, the occasions of which differences have bin by many
touched, and I wish they had not the misfortune to know them, or we the
unhappiness to feel them, for how can the Kingdom subsist if the Pillars by
whom it subsisteth are undermined? how can peace flourish when the maintainers
of it are not at peace amongst themselves? How can happiness attain to us if
the introducers of it are at unhappy variance? O let it then be the desire of
all true subjects that these may agree, concord, and be united; that themselves
may enjoy again their Peace and Liberties, and happily avoid what is so much
feared Civil dissension, for most manifest it is, that a King agreeing with a
truly settled Parliament must needs make his Kingdom truly flourish, for they
being chosen from all parts of the Kingdom, and by the free Election of the
men in those parts must needs be supposed to know what the grievances or wrongs
what the troubles or vexations of the whole Land are and none doubts, but
(were there an agreement betwixt the head and these members) hose wrongs would
be righted, those troubles would be appeased and those vexations quieted and
secured, before this be done it cannot be expected that we should be safe and
peaceable and better were it to enjoy peace at hard conditions, then that we
should be embroyled with civil distractions, for then would the Laws be cast
of, the Magistrates despised, the liberty of Subjects turned into the
licentiousness of Rebels, and all things strangely metamorphosed into a
confused Chaos, and we all know that the Laws are the sinews and nerves which
consolidate and strengthen the Commonalty, they are the authority by which
every man challenges his right and enjoyes his own, in them the prosperity of
the Subject, being set down, the punishment of offenders prescribed, and all
political government established, then by whom were all these made and enacted
but by the W sdome and Counsel of Kings and their Parliaments the Magistrates
are those (that being authorized by those that made them) do give r^se to the
Laws, by declaring them and putting them in fo^ce, by such the Laws which in
themselves are dead being enlivened for they invindicating those that suffer,
and punishing those that do wrong and in justice do execute and administer
justice, upon which the Laws are founded.

The liberty of the Subject is not such a licentiousness as will authorize him
to do any thing, without fear or care of any ensuing danger but it is that
whereby he enjoyes that which is properly his own without any molestation or
trouble, and this liberty also produces from the ordaining of good Laws which
are by Kings and Parliaments, and the executing them which is by Magistrates,
we may then plainly see that the maintenance of the Kings honor and estate,
the power and privileges of Parliaments, and the liberty and property of the
Subjects, are those which make a State political truly peaceable, but when the
Kings Prerogative is invaded, the just power of Parliaments by every one
questioned, the liberty of the Subject misinterpreted, all things turn into a
confusion, and straight is fomented a civil War sooner begun then ended, and
produced by as bad causes, as it self does generate disastrous effects.

Let then the Law proceed duly and justly against those magligannt spirits,
whose only aim it is to bring such sad ends to pass, and to poison the Land
with the infection of Arbitrary government, that all things may be lawful
nothing safe, which how great misery it will bring upon us a very Heathen could
tell, who openly professed, That he had rather live in a Land where nothing is,
then where all things were common and lawful.

Nor is it Englands unfortunate condition alone to be so near to its ruin and
de^^ruction, nor is it only Ireland whose distresses want relief, but both
our neighbors France and Spain are violently oppressed with their own
greatness. Jn Spain whole Countries revolt against their King and choose
another, thinking themselves too great a Nation to be swayed by one Scepter, or
ruled by one Monarch.

Castile and Portugal scorning to be less then Kingdoms, by the loss of
which great Countries how much the honor and revenue of that King will be
impoverished we may easily judge

In France not only the Kingdom but the life of the King himself was in great
danger, by the Stratagems they say of an unnatural Mother and an ambitious
Brother, strange that he should be in danger of losing his life by her that
first gave it him! and that a Brother should prove a Traitor! but the
horridness of this plot was defeated to the destruction of the Conspirators;
for no so^ner was it known to be divulged, but it shortened (some say took
away) the life of her, that world have taken away the life of her Son. She
within five days expiring. Such is the deplorable estate of ill success in
ill Enterprises, perish all they who desire the Misery and o pugne the
Happiness of this Land, and by the goodness of GOD and care of this prudent
PARLIAMENT, let their horrid devises perish with themselves.

FINIS.
