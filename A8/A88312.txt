JOHN LENTHAL.

THE PROPOSITIONS WITH SOME ADDITIONS.
1. THe Prisoners were desired to show their Reasons why a Law should not be
made, to Sequester their Estates into the Hands of Commissioners nominated by
their Creditors, as in the Statute of Bankerupt, to be Let or Sold, that their
debts might be paid, and the remainder returned to them.

2. To show their Reasons, why a Law should not also be made, That if any of
the Prisoners have made over their Estates, or any part thereof, in Trust, or
otherwise, to any Person, so as to defraud their Creditors; And if such Person
or Persons shall not voluntarily make Discovery thereof, within a convenient
time, to be appointed; That then, they shall forfeit of their own Estates the
Value of what is so Concealed, and such fraudulent Acts made void.

3. Why the Creditors of such as are poor, and have not to pay their debts,
their Creditors having the benefit of Commissioners if they will, to examine
their Debtors upon oath, and such other Witnesses as are necessary for the
discovering their Estates, paying as far as it will extend, why such persons
should not be released, so as to be set to labor (if able) for bread for
themselves or families: and if possible, to pay their just debts: That the
Commonwealth, Creditor, and Debtor may less suffer, and the Lord not provoked
by the cruelty of the Creditor or carelessness of the Debtor.

And all such poor Prisoners as are in want and not able to work, may be
released and relieved; That so Prisons may neither be places of protection to
men of Estates, nor of destruction to such as have none.

The answer by some of the Prisners to the first Proposition was; That they
thought it reasonable, so as they might have like relief against their Debtors.

Others said, that they lay in Prison for other men's debts, who dyed men of
great Estates, and left them to descend to their Children in Tail, and they
prayed their Estates might be made liable to pay their Debts.

Others said, they were imprisoned unjustly, at the suite of Corporations, and
those Corporations were indebted to them, and prayed that a Law might be made
to make Corporations liable to pay their debts.

Diverse Prisoners complained, that they were kept in Prison by feigned Actions,
and no Declarations upon them, to show for what cause; and when they had been
so imprisoned three Terms, because then they might free themselves upon common
Bail; their Adversaries would lay other feigned Actions upon them, and so they
were never like to get out.

These and many other things of moment, for redress in these cases, are under
consideration, and to be presented to the Council of State for present relief.
