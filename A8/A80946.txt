London, Printed for Edward Husband, Printer to the Honorable House of Commons,
August 23. 1648.

To the Honorable, William Lenthal Esquire Speaker of the Honorable House of
COMMONS.
SIR,
I Have sent up this Gentleman to give you an account of the great and good
hand of God toward you in the late Victory obtained against the Enemy in these
parts.

After the conjunction of that party which I brought with me out of Wales with
the Northern Forces about Knaresborough and Weatherby, hearing that the Enemy
was advanced with their Army into Lancashire, we marched the next day, being
the 13 of this instant August, to Oatley (having cast off our Train, and sent
it to Knaresborough, because of the difficulty of the marching therewith
through Craven; and to the end we might with more expedition attend the Enemies
motion) and from thence the 14 to Skipton, the 15 to Gysborn, the 16 to
Hodder-bridge over Ribble, where we had a Council of War, at which we had in
consideration, Whether we should march to Whalley that night, and so on to
interpose between the Enemy and his further progress into Lancashire, and so
Southward, which we had some advertisement the Enemy intended, and since
confirmed, That they resolved for London it self; or whether to march
immediately over the said Bridge, there being no other betwixt that and
Preston, and engage the Enemy there, who we did believe would stand his ground,
because we had information, That the Irish forces under Monro lately come out
of Ireland, which consisted of Twelve hundred Horse and Fifteen hundred Foot,
were on their march toward Lancashire to join with them; It was thought that
to engage the Enemy to fight was our business, and the reason aforesaid giving
us hopes, That our marching on the North-side of Ribble would effect it; It was
resolved we should march over the Bridge, which accordingly we did, and that
night quartered the whole Army in the field by Stonihurst-hall, being Mr.
Sherburns house, a place nine miles distant from Preston, very early the next
morning we marched toward Preston, having intelligence, That the Enemy was
drawing together thereabouts from all his out-Quarters, we drew out a Forlorn
of about Two hundred Horse and Four hundred Foot, the Horse commanded by Major
Smithson, the Foot by Major Pounel; our Forlorn of Horse marched within a mile
where the Enemy was drawn up in the enclosed grounds by Preston, on that side
next us; and there upon a Moor about half a mile distant from the Enemies Army,
met with their Scouts and Out-guard, and did behave themselves with that
valor and courage, as made their Guards (which consisted both of Horse and
Foot) to quit their ground, and took diverse prisoners, holding this dispute
with them until our Forlorn of Foot came up for their justification, and by
those we had opportunity to bring up our whole Army: So soon as our Foot and
Horse were come up, we resolved that night to engage them if we could; and
therefore advancing with our Forlorn, and putting the rest of the Army into as
good a posture as the ground would bear (which was totally inconvenient for our
Horse, being all enclosure and miery ground) we pressed upon them; The
Regiments of Foot were ordered as follows; There being a lane very deep and
ill up to the Enemies Army, and leading to the Town, we commanded two Regiments
of Horse, the first whereof was Col: Harrisons, and next was my own, to charge
up that Lane, and on either side of them advanced the Battle, which were Lieut:
Col: Reads, Col: Deans and Col: Prides on the right, Col: Brights and my Lord
Generals on the left, and Col: Ashton with the Lancashire Regiments in reserve;
we ordered Col: Thornhaugh and Col: Twisletons Regiments of Horse on the right,
and one Regiment in reserve for the lane and the remaining Horse on the left,
so that at last we came to a Hedge Dispute, the greatest of the impression from
the Enemy being upon our left Wing, and upon the Battle on both sides the lane,
and upon our Horse in the lane; in all which places the Enemy was forced from
their ground after four hours Dispute, until we came to the Town, into which
four Troops of my Regiment first entered, and being well seconded by Col:
Harrisons Regiment, charged the Enemy in the Town, and cleared the streets;
there came no hands of your Foot to fight that day, but did it with incredible
Valor and Resolution, amongst which Col: Brights, my Lords Generals, Leiut:
Col: Reads and Col: Ashtons had the greatest work, they often coming to push of
Pike, and to close firing, and always making the Enemy to recoyl; and indeed I
must needs say, God was as much seen in the Valor of the Officers and Soldiers
of these before mentioned, as in any Action that has been performed: The Enemy
making (though he was still worsted) very stiff and sturdy resistance, Col:
Deans and Col: Prides outwinging the Enemy, could not come to so much share of
the Action; the Enemy shaging down toward the Bridge, and keeping almost all
in reserve, that so he might bring fresh hands often to fight, which we not
knowing, but least we should be outwinged, placed those two Regiments to
enlarge our Right Wing, which was the cause they had not at that time so great
a share in that Action; at the last the Enemy was put into disorder, many men
slain, many prisoners taken; the Duke with most of the Scots. Horse and Foot
retreated over the Bridge, where after a very hot Dispute betwixt the
Lancashire Regiments, part of my Lord Generals and them being at push of Pike,
they were beaten from the Bridge, and our Horse and Foot following them, killed
many, and took diverse prisoners, and we possessed the Bridge over Darwent and a
few Houses there, the Enemy being driven up within Musket shot of us where we
lay that night, we not being able to attempt further upon the Enemy, the night
preventing us; in this posture did the Enemy and we lie the most part of that
night; upon entering the Town, many of the Enemies Horse fled toward Lancaster,
in the chase of whom went diverse of our Horse, who pursued them near ten miles,
and had execution of them, and took about five hundred Horse, and many
Prisoners; We possessed in this Fight very much of the Enemies Ammunition, I
believe they lost four or five thousand Arms, the number of the slain we judge
to be about a thousand, the prisoners we took were about four thousand.

In the night the Duke was drawing off his Army toward Wiggon, we were so
wearied with the dispute that we did not so well attend the enemies going off
as might have been, by means whereof the enemy was gotten at least 3. miles
with his rear before ours got to them, I ordered Colonel Thornhaugh to
Command two or three Regiments of horse to follow the enemy if it were
possible, to make him stand till we could bring up the Army: The enemy marched
away seven or eight thousand foot, and about four thousand horse, we
followed him, with about three thousand Foot, and two thousand five hundred
horse and Dragoones, and in this prosecution that worthy Gentleman Colonel
Thornhaugh pressing too boldly was slain, being ran into the body, and thigh,
and head, by the enemies Launcers, and give me leave to say, he was a man as
faithful and gallant in your service as any, and one who often heretofore lost
blood in your quarrel, and now his last, he has left some behind him to
inherit a Fathers honor, and a sad Widow, both now the interest of the
Commonwealth; our horse still prosecuted the enemy, killing and taking diverse
all the way, at last the enemy drew up within three miles of Wiggon, and by
that time our Army was come up they drew off again and recovered Wiggon before
we could attempt any thing upon them, we lay that night in the field close by
the enemy, being very dirty and weary, and having marched twelve miles of such
ground as I never rod in all my life, the day being very wet we had some
skirmishing that night with the enemy near the town, where we took Major
General Van Druske and a Colonel, and killed some principal Officers, and
took about a hundred prisoners, where also I received a Letter from Duke
Hamilton for civil usage toward his Kinsman; Colonel Hamilton whom he left
wounded there. We took also Colonel Hurrey and Lieutenant Colonel Ennis
sometimes in your service. The next morning the enemy marched toward
Warrington, and we at the heels of them, the town of Wiggon a great and poor
town and very Malignant were plundered almost to their skins by them, we could
not engage the enemy until we came within three miles of Warrington, and there
the enemy made a stand at a pass near Winwicke, we held them in some dispute
till our Army came up, they maintaining the pass with great resolution for
many hours, ours and theirs coming to push of pike, and very close charges,
and forced us to give ground, but our men by the blessing of God quickly
recovered it, and charging very home upon them beat them from their standing,
where we killed about a thousand of them, and took (as we believe) about two
thousand prisoners, and prosecuted them home to Warrington town, where they
possessed the bridge, which had a strong barracado and a work upon it formerly
made very defensive; as soon as we came thither, I received a Message from
Lieutenant General Baily desiring some capitulation, to which I yielded
considering the strength of the pass, and that I could not go over the river
within ten miles of Warrington with the Army, I gave him these terms, that he
should surrender himself, and all his Officers and Soldiers prisoners of War,
with all his Arms and Ammunition and horses to me, I giving quarter for life
and promising civil usage, which accordingly is done, and the Commissioners
deputed by me have received and are receiving all the Arms and Ammunition
which will be as they tell me about four thousand complete Arms, and as many
prisoners, and thus you have their Infantry totally ruined, what Colonels or
Officers are with Lieutenant General Bailey, I have not yet received the
list, The Duke is marched with his remaining horse, which are about 3000
toward Namptwich, where the Gentlemen of the Country have taken about 500. of
them, of which they sent me word this day, the Country will scarce suffer any
of my men to pass, except they have my hand, telling them they are Scots, they
bring in and kill diverse as they light upon them, most of the Nobility of
Scotland are with the Duke, if I had a thousand horse that could but trot
thirty miles, I should not doubt but to give a very good account of them, but
truly we are so harrased and hagled out in this businsse, that we are not able
to do more then walk an easy pace after them, I have sent Post to my Lord
Gray, to Sir Henry Cholmeley and Sir Edward Roads, to gather altogether with
speed for their prosecution as likewise to acquaint the Governor of Stafford
therewith;

I hear Munroe is about Cumberland with the horse that ran away, and his Irish
horse and foot, which are a considerable body; I have left Colonel Ashtons
three Regiments of foot, with seven troops of Horse, six of Lancashire, and one
of Cumberland at Preston, and ordered Collonell Scroop with five troops of
Horse, and two troops of Dragoones, with two Regiments of foot, viz. Colonel
Lassals, and Colonel Wastats to embody with them, by which I hope they will be
able to make a resistance till we can come up to them, and have ordered them to
put their prisoners to the sword if the Scots shall presume to advance upon
them, because they cannot bring them off with security.

Thus you have a Narrative of the particulars of the success which God has
given you, which I could hardly at this time have done, considering the
multiplicity of business, but truly when I was once engaged in it; I could
hardly tell how to say less, there being so much of God, and I was not willing
to say more, lest there should seem to be any of man, only give me leave to
add one word, showing the disparity of the Forces on both sides, that so you
may see, and all the world acknowledge the great hand of God in this business,
the Scots Army could not be less then 12000. effective foot well armed, and
five thousand horse, Langdale not less then two thousand five hundred foot,
and fifteen hundred horse, in all twenty one thousand; And truly very few of
their foot, but were as well armed, if not better then yours, and at diverse
disputes did fight two or three hours before they would quit their ground.
Yours were about two thousand five hundred Horse and Dragoones of your old
Army, about four thousand Foot of your old Army, also about one thousand six
hundred Lancashire foot, and about five hundred Lancashire horse, in all about
eight thousand six hundred. You see by Computation about two thousand of the
Enemy slain, betwixt eight and nine thousand Prisoners, besides what are
lurking in hedges and private places, which the Country daily bring in or
destroy; Where Langdale and his broken Forces are, I know not, but they are
exceedingly shattered; Surely sir this is nothing but the hand of God, praise
only belongs to him, and where ever any thing in this world is exalted, or
exalts its self, God will pull it down, for this is the day wherein he alone
will be exalted. It is not fit for me to give advise, nor to say a word what
use should be made of this, more then to pray you and all that acknowledge God,
that they would only exalt him, and not hate his people who are as the apple of
his eye, And for whom even Kings shall be reproved, and that you would take
courage to do the work of the Lord, in fulfilling the end of your Magistracy,
in seeking the peace and welfare of the people of this Land, that all that will
live quietly and peaceably, may have countenance from you, and they that are
implacable, and will not leave troubling the Land, may speedily be destroyed
out of the Land, and if you take courage in this, God will bless you, and good
men will stand by you, and God will have glory, and the Land will have
happiness by you in despite of all your enemies, which shall be the prayer
of your most

20th August 1648. humble and faithful servant O Cromwell.

Postscript.
We have not in all this lost a considerable Officer but Colonel Thornhaugh,
and not many soldiers, considering the service, but many are wounded, and our
Horse much wearied. I humbly crave that some course be taken to dispose of the
Prisoners, the trouble and extreme charge of the Country where they lie, is
more then the danger of their escape, I think they would not go home if they
might without a Convoy, they are so fearful of the country from whom they have
deserved so ill; Ten men will keep a thousand from running away.

FINIS.
