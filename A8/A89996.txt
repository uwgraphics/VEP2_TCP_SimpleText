News from Babylon, of the birth of a strange Prophet.
LEtters were sent from the Master of Malta to a kinsman of his here in this
Kingdom, wherein were very many strange things specified, which are these
which follow.

There was from a natural woman borne a man child, of very strange and unheard
of feature; his eyes sparkled like Gold, he was borne with teeth, which
resembled cats teeth, he had also nails on his fingers and toes, but not like
a man, but like a beast, he spoke to them so soon as he was borne, and
reproved them for any thing which was done against his will, taking great state
upon him, and he calls himself the great Prophet, he much delights in, and
loves Images, and Pictures, and very devoutly will pray, seven or eight times
each day, he loves to walk solitarily in the fields, and he eats very
little, and that which he does eat is very corse.

One day as he was walking the fields, attended on by those which use to wait
on him, which are a douzen or fourteen uglie, and ilshapen fellows none know
from whence they came, or whither they will go, he met with three or four
which were in the shape of men, which when they came near him they kneeled and
delivered letters unto him, which when he had read he tore the l tters, and
the bearers thereof vanished away, and were no more seen. Another time he was
walking into the Temple, into which he was conveyed with such a sweet harmony
of music that has not been heard on the earth before, and at his coming
out thereof there was such a clangor of Drums, Gunns, and Trumpets in the air,
which made the whole Country amazed, for it was seen all over the Country,
of which he began to prophecy, that at his death there should be wars, and
rumors of wars, in so much that all the western countries shall be laid
desolate, but this Country shall flourish like the bay tree even in the
midst of the winter of misfortunes. He will not abide to hear of the
Scriptures, for he says that there was no such thing as is there specified,
but they are all most strange lies, and not to be believed by man.

Sometimes he will be gone for the space of a week or a fortnight together, but
whither no man knows, but his men or Devils, or whatsoever they are which wait
upon him, are always with him.

Now many poor silly people do believe this man to be the savior which was
promised, and now is come, but I believe and faithfully persuade my self that
they do deceive themselves, and come short of the truth; these things if they
be true are strange, very strange, yet they are but as a foil to perfection,
they are nothing in respect of the Miracles which were done by our Savior,
whose fame does as far outrun the fame of this newborn Prophet, as the light
of the Sun does the light of the smallest Star.

It is my censure, and the censure of many more which have heard of this
business, that this is rather Antichrist, then any true prophet, for it is
written, Antichrist shall come, and in an other place, beware of false
Prophets, for they shall come and strive to persuade you from the right way,
and lead you to perdition; I cannot choose but think and admire to see how each
tittle of his sayings will come to pass, nay day by day they are more and more
manifested.

But here now is happened a very strange accident, he was gone for the space of a
month together as his custom was, in which time there was nothing but
lightning, and thunder, and horrible tempests, in so much that each man
expected no otherwise but that the last day had been come, for night and day
there was no resting, every one expecting his house to be blown down about
his ears, great harm was done by the tempestuous winds. There was a poor man
had been abroad amongst the woods to gather sticks, which poor man was taken
up by a whirlwind and was no more seen or heard of again; An other thing also
which is much to be admired at, which would make men beware how they tempt the
angry Heavens, for fear that they suffer the like punishment.

In all this hurly burly, when the contentious Heavens were jarring, there
was a boy which laughed excessively, and very merry he was, saying that none
but fools would be afraid of lightning and thunder, for it was impossible
that it should hurt them; wherefore because he would show himself
foole-hardie, he run about in the rain, as if he would provoke Heaven to do
its worst, nay this was not folly enough for him to act, he began now to be
wickedly impudent, for (said he) if any one will give me any thing, i will go
and show my breech to the thunder, an other unhappy bird although not
altogether so unluckie, told him that if he would do it he would give him all
his points, and forgive him the two farthings which he owed unto him, will thou
(said he) and presently he went forth into the green and there he did it,
but mark, sorrow, and tremble reader, the Lord will show himself to be a great
God, there came a thunderbolt and struck his breech from his body, his body
was no more seen, but his breech lay there as a sign for what he was
punished. All you young youths to whom this present discourse shall come,
learn to refrain such foole-hardie attempts, for by this you may see, that the
Lord will not be dallied withal, read therefore, and consider, and the Lord
guide you and keep you, I have for a while derogated from my Story.

At the months end this prophet and his uglie rouges were seen again, and for
because there was such a great deal of harm done in the land by reason of the
thunder, as rooting up trees, blowing down houses, murders and such like,
they began to examine him where he had been, he answered them very
scornfully, that he was not come into the World to be examined but to examine,
not to be ruled but to rule over others, with these and such like peremptory
words he answered them, till at last he had incensed them so far that they
told him flat and plain they must and would examine him, and if he denied to
answer to such interrogatories which they would propose, there was no abiding
for him, neither should he stay there, why (said he) you shall be beholding
to me to stay, or else I will not stay and with that he vaunted ted himself
and flew away from them through the air, and his men with him, but ever since,
the Country has been affrighted with thunder and tempests, and earthquakes,
that the like was never known there bafore, In so much that they fear the
whole Countries desolation, and they now pray with our liturgy, from lightning
and tempest, and from sudden death,

Good Lord deliver us.
FINIS.
