THE Lawyers Bane: OR, THE Laws Reformation, AND NEW MODEL.
FOrasmuch as it concerns all men in general (the lowest and meanest not
excepted,) to know and understand those Laws and Ordinances by which their
Rights, Privileges, Interests, and estates are secured, their words and
actions regulated and directed, and for the breach and transgression of which
said Laws and Ordinances they shall be punished, even in the highest degree of
life and member: and seeing it is altogether unjust and unreasonable to punish
any man, for omitting or doing contrary to that which he neither knows, nor
can know, nor understand, therefore it is no less just and equitable, then
consonant and agreeable to solid and sound reason, that the Laws Statutes and
Constitutions, by which any people or nation under heaven, are to be governed,
and to which they are to yield obedience, be (as much as possible may be,)
short, few and compendious, and withal so easy and plain to be understood,
that if any men should plead ignorance of them, it could be no other then
wilful and affected, and so all men being left without excuse, those justly
might then be adjudged worthy of severe and exemplarie punishment, that should
digress, swerve from their duties, whereof they had or might have had perfect
cognusance and knowledge: now for as much as the present Laws of this nation,
are in regard of their multiplicitie, and number, confused and tedious, in
themselves faulty, and in the execution of them extremely corrupted, and the
knowledge of them with much labor, pains and study scarcely to be attained
unto; and also in regard of the strange and barbarous language wherein they are
for the most part written, hard (and to the common and vulgar sort of People
impossible) to be understood, who are both most in number and have most need to
know them, so that it were almost as good for them to have no Law at all, as
one so blind and difficult, that cannot be understood without great wit and
long arguing, to which neither their gross judgments can attain, nor their
leisure and opportunity, (who are otherwise necessarily to be employed in
their several vocations and callings for the maintenance of themselves and
families,) can suffice, so that they are to them, and almost unto all other men
whatsoever, (Lawyers only excepted) no better then snares and traps, wherein
they are usually caught and taken, to their great trouble and vexation, and
oftentimes to their utter ruin and undoing, and therefore for the breaking of
this net, and the preventing of the like inconveniences for the future, these
few observations are here offered to be considered.

1. That the Laws which are made for the preservation, use and regulation of
English men, and of them only, may be written in the English tongue, and not in
Latin, French, or any other language whatsoever, and in a style so easy,
plain and familiar, that all may know them, and be enabled to understand them,
that so they may be able to avoid and escape those rocks, against which so many
have formerly been split and broken, and to preserve themselves from falling
into those gulphs wherein multitudes have so often been swallowed up and
perished, and then if any shall suffer shipwreck, it will be no other, then a
just reward of their own wilful ignorance.

2. That for the making of the Laws easy and plain, as aforesaid, a
competent number of impartial, indifferent and unbiassed men, learned, wise,
discreet, and every way fitly qualified for the performance of the work they
are to manage and effect, may be chosen by the consent of the King and
Parliament, being the representative body of the whole Kingdom, to consult and
take into serious consideration the whole body of the present Laws, as they
now stand confused and in parts, and out of the result, pith and marrow thereof
(the temper and genius of the times and people being thoroughly studied, and the
personal rights, privileges and immunities of all persons, as well the Kings
as others considered and preserved,) to extract, invent, and find out, new,
good, equal, just and necessary Laws, plain, easy and free from all
dilemmaes and ambiguities, according as they in their wisdom shall think fit
and convenient, all the rest of the Laws, together with all old names and
distinctions as of Common, Civil and Statute Laws, being repealed and taken
away for ever, and if in case hereafter any or more of these Laws thus made as
aforesaid, be found in some part or parts of them ambiguous, improper or
insufficient (experience being the best mistress) either in respect of
themselves or the times, for as the Poet says, tempora mutantur, et nos
mutamur in illis, that then the dificience, ambiguitie or defect of the said
Law or Laws, or any of them, may not be provided for or amended, by being
explained, altered supplied, or repealed in that, or those parts only
ambiguous, improper, or insufficient as aforesaid, the remainder of the said
Laws being still continued in force and virtue, a remedy which in time would
prove as ill, if not worse then the disease it self, and in a great part the
source and fountain from whence has flowed the prolixity and confusion of our
present, (especially our Statute Laws, but that the said Law or Laws
defective as aforesaid, may be totally abrogated and taken away, and for supply
thereof, a new or new ones, fit and proper for the malady to which it or they
are to be applied, in place thereof may be made and enacted, that by this means
the Laws may be kept and preserved in their primarie brevitie, plainness and
integrity.

And in order conducing to the ends aforesaid, viz. the Laws brevitie and
plainness, upon which depends the peace and happiness of the people, these
things following are to be considered: first, all diversities of tenures, as of
Free-holds and Copie-holds; secondly, all diversities of Fees, as of
Fee-Simples, Fee-tailes and the like, with the Sub-Divisions of Soccage Capite,
Knight service, etc. as also the Tenures by Fines, certain and uncertain in
Copie-holds, together with all others of the like nature, are for ever to be
nullified and abolished, one Tenurie and Fee which shall be thought most
useful and convenient for all the Lands in the whole Kingdom, only excepted,
that so they may all be one and the same, both in Fee and Tenure, which how
much it would conduce to the benefit and ease of the whole Kingdom, who sees
not? and only to make it appear just and reasonable, two great Objections are
to be answered.

Object. 1. It may be objected that the King, the Nobility, and Gentry would
be much prejudiced both in their honors and profits, by the taking away of the
rents and services due to their Manors, together with diverse other casual
profits thereunto appertaining.

Object. 2. By the taking away of intailes, it may seem hard and unreasonable,
that all men should be debarred and secluded from conveying and disposing of
their own Lands upon their own terms, and according as they should think
most useful and convenient for themselves and their posterity.

I answer: 1. For their rents and their casual profits, as Escheats,
Forfeitures, uncertain Fines in Copieholds, and the like, being estimated at a
certain annual rent by an equal and indifferent computation, they may be
continued, issuing and payable out of the same Lands they were formerly, in the
nature of rent charges, and so the alteration in this particular would be only
nominall.

2. For their services due to their Manors, as Fealty suting their Courts,
and the like; I answer, first, for their King, all men that are borne his
Subjects, owe him Fealty, swear him Allegiance, and as his liege people,
ought to do him service upon all lawful occasions, and therefore the
reiterating of the same things by the same men in his particular Courts, may
seem only a work of supererrogation, and a repetition and re-acting,
fruitless and unnecessary. And secondly, for the Nobility and Gentry, their
pristine honor and reputation, both as relating to the power and command they
formerly had over their Tenants, holding of their said Manors, as also in
reference to the present opinion and estimation of all men, is utterly lost and
vanished, no man in these days valuing his Lord of whom he holds his Lands
(his free rents being paid) more then another man, scarce any thing at all. And
secondly, diverse of these Manors being fallen into the hands of ignoble and
mechanic men, diverse both of the Nobility and Gentry in regard of the tenure
of some part of their estates, owe Fealty and other services incident to the
said Manors, to mean men far their inferiors, both in rank and quality,
and therefore this punctilio of honor is not to be regarded in respect of its
confusion and disorder.

Now to the second Objection, concerning the restraining of all men from
limiting of their Estates by Intailes; I answer,

1. As the case now stands, they are so easily and usually cut off, frustrated
and made void, by Fines and Recoveries, that they are altogether vain and
useless, except it be to make employment for Lawyers, Atturneyes, and others
of the same craft and calling. And,

2 Admit they were altogether unavoidable and inalterable, what other use or
advantage could be made of them, (the showing of men's pride and vanity only
excepted) then the intailing of a destructive inconvenience upon their
posterities, whose numerous issues and offsprings are (by reason of these
Intailes) for the most part in a forlorn and miserable condition, left to
beggerie and poverty; or, according to the proverb, to the wide world, utterly
unprovided for (the eldest only excepted) contrary to Reason, the Law of
Nature, and of God himself, a double portion only being allotted to the
firstborn: and therefore such a liberty as this is rather to be suppressed
and provided against, then any wise cherished or indulged unto, as a
distrusting of the providence of God, and a too much confiding in an arm of
flesh, in a Christian and well-governed Commonwealth.

And now to proceed, the letter and sense of the Law being thus made plain and
apparent, the next thing to be considered is the execution of them, and in this
part doubtless they cry alowd for the help of a Physician, the present
practice of them being so corrupted and polluted, that it stinks abominably in
the nostrills of God, and all good men; and therefore it were to be desired,
that several Courts of Judicature should be established in every, even the
least Counties; and in those that are larger, as Lincolnshire, Yorkshire, etc.
two, three, or more, according to their respective greatness and extents,
which said Courts might judge absolutely and soveraignly (all arbitrarinesse
being by provident and wholesome restrictions and limitations carefully and
diligently prevented) over all causes and persons, crimina laesae Majestatis,
and of highest treasons, which may be referred to the censure of the
Parliament, only excepted, whereby the shuffling and removing of Suits from
one Court to another, to the great damage and oppression of the people, by
injunctions, and the like, might be taken away, and justice equally and
speedily administered to all men, even at their own doors, whereby likewise one
sort of Vermin, viz. Atturneyes, Sollicitors, and the like, would be made
useless, all men being now by the Laws plainness and simplicity enabled to
plead their own causes, some few of the most ignorant being for this present
generation only excepted, who might easily procure a friend or neighbor to be
their Advocate. As for the future, the Law being thus made easy by the vulgar
to be known and attained unto, especially if public Schools were in every
Parish erected, for teaching to read and write the English tongue, a work
worthy to be ^^ought upon by those that are in authority, all men, mad men and
fools only excepted, would be ^^fficiently able to manage (...), and further
the dishonesty and villa^^ie of those men, would hereby be suppressed, who vex
and oppress their Neighbors by fained and unjust futes, peaceable minded men
as the case now stands, choosing rather to purchase their own quietness at a
litigious knave^ hand, then to contend in Law with hi^, although their cause in
its self be both just and honest, in regard both of the delay of justice,
proceeding from briberie, removing of suits, and many other corruption, as also
from the remote distance of the place of judicature, to the great oppression
and ^exation of the best and honestestiso^ of people, most worthy by all
lawful and good means to be protected and provided for; and lastly, (a little
to digress, hereby the exorbitant greatness of the City of London would be
^^ated, and reta^ded, which by the co^fluence and resort of people unto it,
from all part^ of the Kingdom upon so many occasions, is although the (...)
City, grown so monstrous and disproportionable (a great solecisme in estate
policy) to the rest of the body, that it is to be feared, (if experience have
not already taught us just cause of fear,) that it will shortly, if not
prevented, through the infinite numbers of tumultuous base and r^scallous
people; wherewith it now about (...) produce effects monstrous and destructive
to it^ self and the whole Kingdom, but to return, if it be objected that
when there were but two resembling those Courts aforesaid in the whole
Kingdom; (...) those of the presidents and Counsels established in Wales, and
in the North, and those to judge only in cause of lesser consequence, and yet
these two by Parliament suppressed at burdensome to the Commonwealth, what
then could be expected from so many of the like not (...), to be set up
throughout the whole Kingdom, but oppression ^^re then formerly, respective to
their (...)? I ^nswer 1. These Courts were put down for their arbitrarie
acting, according to their own wills and discretions, not being (...) to
observe the strict Rules and Precepts of a known and certain Law, a fault in
these new Courts to be with all (...) a ^^sp^^^ion and careful diligence
provided against as aforesaid, and secondly, the plain and well known rules
of the Law, to all men now made obvious and apparent, would defer Judges and
all other Ministers of justice from oppression and corruption, in regard that
if they should never so little step aside or digress from the paths of
equity, they would presently be detected and discovered without reaping any
other brevitie (although now the case be otherwise) to themselves, then the
loss of other places for ever, together with a brand of infamy and disgrace
for their said transgressions; thirdly and lastly, an annual of trienniall
Parliament, or of any other certain distance of time, as should be thought
most convenient, one of whose proper ends and works it would be, to examine,
punish and reform abuses and all sorts of enormities whatsoever, wherewith
these Courts should at any time be infected or corrupted, would so dant and
over awe, especially if justice were severely and impartially administered and
afflicted upon all offenders, without respect of persons, even the most daring
and impudent Spirits; and so all those might be curbed, and bridled (how
unruly soever) by the Laws strictness and severity, whom conscience of their
ways and the love of justice, would not refrain, the next in order to be
considered, is the Regulation of the fees of all those that are to act or
agitate in the administration of the Laws, in any rank or degree whatsoever;
now although the present abuse and abominable excess in this particular, cry
aloud for Reformation, a thing formerly often attempted without success, in
regard that the branches (although out and ^^ped,) will spring and put out
again, if the roots be still continued, yet because all that formerly, or
hereafter shall be said, tends only and properly to the ^^king away of the
cause of all these corruptions and abuses, which once performed, all
mischeivous effects of this or the like nature, will of themselves cease and
become void, therefore I shall only add in relation to this particular; that
those sees ^hough^ needful to be continued, which would neither be great nor
many* might be both known and certain, without all equi^^^^tions or ^^asions,
so far as could by any means be divised by humane wit or policy, and that
all offenders, either in giving or taking above that proportion which should be
by Parliament allowed and established, might be for example to all (...) most
severely punished, and further, the taker of any bribes above the proportion
aforesaid, to be deprived of his office, and if his offense were great and
notorious, the said offender to ^^^^^^de incapable of bearing any office in the
Common wealth for ever.

And now let us step a little aside for conscience sake, and consider the
Chancery, which being as first erected to mitigate the vigor and strictness of
the Common Law, has by experience proved a great burden and oppression to the
people; by the multiplicitie of suits, and delay of justice, and therefore may
now be taken away, both as corrupt and ^selesse, all Laws being now in
themselves made just and equitable as aforesaid; and if it shall be objected,
that some of them may by the alteration of times or other accidents, prove too
hard and severe. I Answer, the said greivances may then be presented to the
next Parliament, to be considered of, and so a remedy may be provided for the
future.

And now at last I am come to the storming of that strong Bulwark, whereby
these (...) Lawyer, are in their own opinions impregnable, and by t^^ strength
whereof, as though they were altogether i^^ef^c^ble and inconq^^rable, they bid
def^nce unto all m^n, and even with contempt and d^^d ^^e example all their
(...) and opposers under their feet, which enchanted ^^mo^ is nothing else but
those ruler and that fo^^ which they themselves have (...) and propounded for
(...) men that will or desire to practice it the Laws, to observe and walk in;
which (...) ^or^ is a lab^^inth (...) ((...) like) ^o f^ll of windings and
^ut^ings, that it (...) and ^ut o^ known to any, h^^ themselves only; and th^se
^^^owardly men, (...) ^o^rds the Law, of their own profession, now the
cons^^^atio^^ and ^^nfir^^tion of th^^ (...) y^^^y i^, be^au^^ (...) failing
(...) lord, ^^iable, (...) in matter of (...) circum^^ance, ^^though (...) and
meaning be other^ise never so clear and (...) a ^ufficient (...) and (...)
hereby made therefore (although (...) so evil and co^^^pt) so (...), and of
such ^^solute necessary to be employed by all men, to whom the (...) that now
they may abuse us at their pleasure; they may suck our blood, eat our flesh,
and when they have done, even sit them down to gnaw and pick our bones, and yet
we as remediless) must kiss the rod, and Spaniel-like, fawn upon these our
cruel taskmasters; nay further, to provoke and insult over us, their Clarks
forsooth, as though their skill and learning were much in the tacticts, do
place their writings in order military, their words and lines like rancks and
files, keeping equal space and distances, and thus they charge and discharge us
of all our monyes, and then both they and their masters face about to our
enemies; and thus we with Issachar, Asse-like, crouch down between two
burdens, and by the means aforesaid, together with their harsh and conjuring
names, as infang-theif outfang-theif, with others of the same kind, their
strange and barbarous language and the like; they have raised such mists and
fogges about all the parties and parcels of the Law, that except themselves and
their Disciples, all others may well say of it with the Poet, Capud inter
imbula condit; and yet with all their machinations and devices, they are
methinks, no securer then the Ass in the Fable, who disguised with a Lions
skin, walked proudly and disdainfully, (to the terror of the people) up and
down the Country, until one wiser then his neighbors, perceiving the deceit,
pulled off the skin, and then he appeared in his own proper colors, a poor
simple ridiculous Ass, and a laughing stock and derisi^^ to those that
formerly did so much fear and tremble at his presence: The Moral and
application of which said Fable will then clearly and evidently be seen true
when those that are in authority shall seriously undertake to clear up and
dispel those clouds wherewith these men of the long to be have over cast and
darkened both the sense and letter of the Law, and yet more clearly when the
Law's reformed, as aforesaid, shall be cut out of those old stinking and
polluted ditches, wherein they have for so many years been forced to run, and
captivated by these Lawyers, and turned into new clear and uncorrupted
chancels, whereby they may flow purely and pleasantly into all the parts and
corners of the Kingdom, and they themselves shall be discharged of all places
of trust and creda^, both in Council and Government, and thus justly in regard
that they, like the Bishops foot in the Proverb, do spoil and vitiate every
thing they intermiddle with, or have an hand in; these simpletons with their
appurtenances, viz. Atturneyes, Sollicit^^, Clarks, and so to the end of the
chapter, how Asse-like and ridiculous would they then b^, in what a pitiful
c^^ would of John an Oaks be, together with John a Styles his ^eve^ and
copartner, unto what ^ouster de more empore^^^ would they transport themselves,
with their cap^^^s and tails (whereof the ^os^ ^^rt^. English men, could make
neither head nor feet) (...) th^^ wi^^ the rest of their precious ^^^fills,
which would now ^o longer be Staple commodities, nor ve^dable here in England,
he that would nor could resolve them, might get the first ^^e that ever Lawyers
gave, and do them Knight Service also; (...) my part, except they eyes-drop ^e,
I Will be none of their Counsel, but rather leave it to themselves, who wanting
employment of all other men, would now have the most spare time and leisure to
consult and consider of their own occasions; and lastly, to ennumerate the
Knaveries and villainies of all inferior officers, were an endless labor,
especially of those worthy Knights of their own proper foundation surnamed de
le post, who because by their perjuries (tremble O earth, and be ashamed O
heavens) they were serviceable to these Caterpillars, they were by them
tolerated and connived at, and therefore we may justly say of them with Juvenal.

Dant ve^iam corvi^, vexant censure columb^s. Now to conclude, since it is
confessed by all parties that the Law is that which terminates and bounds the
rights and interests of all men, as well of the King in his Prerogative, as of
the people in their privileges and immunities, and seeing these are the two
Poles, upon which, as one saye^ very learnedly and judicially, the Sphe^^ of
government moves, whose influences, if they keep their equal and just
distances, are peace and happiness; and on the contrary, if they interfere and
clash together, they produce certain ruin and destruction to the Nation; and
further considering that these two have always, it all times been used as
stalking-horses on both sides, whereby the Kingdom has oftentimes been
imbroyled in blood and wars, to it is almost ^eter desolation, whereof this
present time, is a woeful testimony and whereunto the Chronicles of all former
times do plainly and evidently bear witness, they having be^^ the causes and
originals of all the civil wars in this Nation, since the Norman-conquest
(the contestation between the White rose and the Red not excepted; and
therefore it were above all other things cordially to be wished and desired
(the reformation of the Laws, as aforesaid scarcely excepted) that the limits
and extents of these two ( viz. the Kings Prerogative and the peoples
privileges) might be thoroughly and thoroughly examined and enquired after, and
being once certainly known and found out they might by the consent, and to the
good and happiness of all Parties, be boundered out to all posterities with
two Herculean pillars, and a non plus ultra, in golden Capital letters written
on them, to the everlasting peace, quietness and prosperity both of King and
People, so far as humane prudence may extend) in this and all succeeding
generations. Thus have I cast my mite into the public treasury, and drawn a
pourtraiture (though rudely and unskilfully) of that, which if done to the
life, and set forth in fresh and proper colors show by a more able and
experienced workman, would show as in it self beautiful and lovely, so would
bring to this Nation more benefit, ease and happiness than it was ever yet
partaker of. And therefore, most noble King, grave and renowned Senators both
of Parliament and City, and ye the Worthies of the Army) the cleansing of this
Augean stable, being a work not unworthy even the Greatest, join all your
forces here together, do but bring this great work to perfection, and we will
all attest under hand and seal, that you have then effected that which all of
you jointly and severally have, to the expense of so much blood and treasure,
all this while either desired or pretended, viz. the good and welfare of the
Common wealth if any shall object that these are but Notions and Fancies, fit
only for Platos or an Utopian Commonwealth: I enswer, that it is the greatest
grief and vexation; next to the mischief it self, that nothing (if really
undertaken by those that are in authority) would be found more easy to be
effect^^, nothing more profitable when effected, and yet none can be ^ound to
attempt it. And therefore, most gracious Sovereign, and noble Heroes, to whose
valor and magnanimity nothing has been found too hard or impossible, give but
a beginning to this great and famous Reformation of all good men, so much
longed after and desired, and the God of peace and order will prosper it in
your hands, to the endearing and ingratiating of your selves to this, and the
eternizing of your names to all future generations, that so Justice may flow
down like a mighty stream, and peace may be within our walls, and
plenteousnesse within our palaces.

Which that it may be, is the hearty prayer and desire of him, who is a loyal
subject to his Prince, a faithful servant to the Parliament, a wellwisher to
the Army, and a lover of the peace and feedome of his native Country.

Nicholson.
