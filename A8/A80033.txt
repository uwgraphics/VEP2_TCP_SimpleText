LONDON Printed according to order for Humphrey Tuckey at the black spread

A true Relation of the Progress of the LONDON Auxillaries since their Joining
with Sir William Waller until their return homewards.
BEing marched from London to Farnham which was our general randevous there
we joined with Sir William Wallers forces, he being our General and Sir James
Harrington Mayor General over the City Brigade.

On Monday the 13 of May 1644. Sir William Waller gave order for all the
Regiments both horse and foot belonging to him to meet next morning in the
Park behynd the Castle which was done accordingly there we lay 3 nights (our
Army consisted of 8 Regiments of horse, and as many foot, being in all about 9
or 10 thousand, 24 pieces of Ordnance great and small, many leather guns and
about 60 wagons for provant and Ammunition, on friday the 17 we were commanded
to march but knew not then whether, that day and all night we marched, next
day being Saturday we came to Bagshotte where our City Brigade and the Kentish
Regiment were quartered in the Park, where was plenty of mutton veale and
lamb some venison and good water but neither bread nor beer for money, but
what we brought with us which was very little, there we lay Saturday night
and Sunday and on monday had order to march toward Basing house, but came not
thither that night for we quartered at a place called Bramly house belonging
to Mr Henly sometime of the: Temple there we wanted neither meat nor fireing
but nothing else to be gotten for love or money, on tewsday the 21 we marched
to Basing house where we came about 3 or 4 of the clock in the afternoon
they welcomed us with 2 or 3 pieces of Ordnance, and hung out 3 or 4 several
Coullers, the Ordnance did no hurt only scared our under marshall the blast
blowing off his hate our horse went round, faced the house, the enemy charged
upon them, slew 2 horse and one man of ours, we saw 2 of their men fall on the
breast works but no more to our veiw, there we lay until evening and it not
being thought convenient to lay seidge to the house we marched round the park
to Basing stoke, the Enemy thinking we had an intent to beleauger the house,
burnt all the houses and 2 mills near adjacent because we should have no
shelter there, we lay at Basing stoake 3 nights and had indifferent good
quarter for our money, but the inhabitants were fearful they should be ill
dealt withal after our departure for entertaining us, they pay 40. l. per week
toward the maintenance of the house, and that morning before we came in, they
had paid that weeks money: one thursday the 24 we marched toward Abington
and making a halt 2 miles onward in our way, there were brought unto us 20
prisoners or there abouts horse and foot; that night we lay at Aldermarson in
the field and one friday likewise, one saturday we marched to Compton in the
hole; this morning a soldier of my Captains Company whose name is Gore) was
shot by accident and sent for London, in the after noone an other of our
Regiment had the like mischance, we descried this day some of my Lord
Generals Colors to march wide of us toward Abington, that night we lay at
Compton a durty town, but we had good respect for our moneys; one sunday the
27 we marched toward Abington and in our march Sir John Merricke came to us
who saluted our Commanders nobly and was wellcomed of us with much joy and
shoutings, he told us my Lord Generals forces were that night to quarter in
Abington, (they consisted of 14 or 15 thousand horse and foot* great store of
Ammunition and provant: our forces could not march to Abington that night,
there being no quarter to entertain a such Armies; therefore sunday night, and
monday night we lay wide of Abington, and one tewsday hearing my Lords Army to
be marched away, we followed in the rear and went through Abington after my
Lords army, (by the way we saw 2 of my Lords men hanged for violence and
plundring) it was written so on their breasts, and that night we lay at Newnam
wo^d where we burnt (it being rainy weather) I believe 50 pounds worth of wood
if not more, next morning we marched forward in sight of Oxford, and my Lords
army marched within a mile of our army or thereabouts we heard how kindly the
City and my Lords Gunns entertained each other, my Lord took diverse prisoners,
and many came to him out of the town, we were on thu^sday commanded to retreat
to regaine a bridge called Newbridge, held b^ the Kings forces which we did,
and that night and friday lay at Abington, and one saturday (the crose being
first plucked down by whose means I know not) we marched for Newbridge, and
being come within a mile or there abouts 2 files of each company were drawn
out for a forlorn hope Captain Gore of the hamlets, and a Captain of the
Kentish Regiment leading them on which they did with such willingness and
courage, as deserves to be remembered and admired, for notwithstanding the
enemy had cut of part of the bridge, and made it unpassable, yet our
Commanders with a boat or a called Punts and some Plankes fell on so bravely
that they made them forsake the bridge, took 30 prisoners upon quarter and 40
more among which were diverse Irish, and a woman who was whipped and turned away,
by Newbridge we lay 3 nights to make the bridge passable for our carriages, and
on teusday the 4. of june (hearing his Majesty with some forces were marched
suddenly from Oxford westward) we marched after all day and night, and came a
little before day nere Witney where we were quartered under a hedge 3 or 4
hours, it rained extremely as it had done for the most part since our advance
from Farnham till then, on wednesday morning we marched toward Stow on the old
being informed the Kings Majesty with his forces were marched for Burford and
that way, which we found true, for comeing to our randevous by Burford, we
were certified the King supped there that night* but rod away immediately: we
staid not at all not so much as to get beer bread or water but were
commanded b^ mayor General Potlid under Sir Williams command to march round
the Town, with all speed affirming the Kings forces and our horse to be in
fight which was nothing so, that morning diverse of the Kings Soldiers were
taken, we marched that wednesday to Stow on on the old in Glocestershire,
where we lay Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, and on Saturday morning we marched
toward Winchcombe, but before we marched, a Gunner of ours was hanged for
violence and plundering, we came that Saturday the eighth of June near the
Town, faced Shudly Castle, drew out of every Company certain Files for a
Forlorn hope, marched to the Castle about nine or ten of the clock, lay just
under the Walls, expecting order to fall on, they had set fire of a stately
Barn adjoining to the house, because we should have no harbor, that evening
one of our great pieces playing on the Castle, shot the Gunner of the Castle in
pieces, which so daunted them, that in the morning without a shot it was
yielded up, there being taken in the Castle these Commanders following; Sir
William Morton, Governor; Lieutenant Colonel Sawyer, Major Ouldham Major
Floyd, Captains, Colt, Merrilla, Banks of Cheapside, Pitwell, and Andrews
Lievtenants, Dogerfield, Thornbury, Floyd Quillet Munford Duncombe, Cornet
Burt. 6. Ensigns, 2 Mass-priests Dun and Prat, 250. common soldiers 3 pieces
of Ordnance, 32 pieces of Cloth, many Featherbeds with furniture, Ammunition
and provant for soldiers, 100. quarters of grain, or more, some cattle and
horses, some Plate and money, there we stayed until Monday, and marched
toward Easum, where we lay Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, before we came
thither a soldier was hanged which was taken at Newbridge, and entertained by
us, having taken the Covenant, and then taken running away. On Thursday we came
to Bramsgrave, where we quartered that night, and on Friday the 14, of June to
Strubridge, and so to Wordsly, where we quartered near Du^ly Castle, there we
lay 3. nights having some ^utton, bread, cheese, and beer, sent to us out of
the Country; On monday we marched toward Saltwich and in our match at
Harvington we light on a Papist widows house (but she not at home) the
soldiers took all in the house, as Pewter, Brass, Bedding, great store of
Books, etc. her name was Mistress Packington then at Worcester; we lay that
night at Saltwich and lying in the salt Cellers, grew so dry, that we drunk
the Town dry, and so marched toward Parciall, where we lay on Tuesday night
(near the Town not being suffered to come in; this Town has been always
opponent to the Parliament, which God has punished in this wise, for on the
eleventh of June, hearing our forces to be advancing that way, there being two
great Monsieur Dammee commanders, appointed overseers of the Works, whom all
the Townsmen were willing to obey, and according to their command resolved to
cut off the Bridge fell eagerly at work, and had cut down three Arches, but
God suffered them not to go forward, for part of the rest fell on these great
Commanders, who with 60 of the Townsmen were drowned and slain, leaving many
Widows and Fatherless children behind them.

Thence we marched toward Tewxbury where the city Brigade were quartered
wednesday and Thursday in the church some in the town and some without, on
Friday the 21. of June we marched toward Gloucester and lay wide of Gloucester
that night and on Saturday intending to march back toward Stow, lost our way,
and went backward and forward within a mile where we lay before, at a place
called Willingcot, from thence to Chelthenham* and so back that Saturday night;
the rest of our men were marched toward Stow, whom we overtooke, and that
night quartered in the fields, the next day being Monday the 24 of June we
marched by Stow, and quartered beyond the Town two miles, and the next day to
Shipson upon Stower, near which some were quartered, and some in the Town,
there we lay two nights, and on Wednesday we lay in the fields; on Thursday we
marched toward Banburie, and lay at Hanwel that night; next day being Friday,
we were commanded to be in Batalia, and marched out of the pasture ground into
the Corn fields, where we discovered the Kings Forces beyond Banbury under
Preston Mills, and they us: our Horse and they faced one the other, the water
being between them and us, we not willing to venture between them and the
Castle, they not daring to come over to us, there we lay all night, but knew
not their minds, as they it seems did ours. For early on Saturday the 29. of
June they marched with their whole body, but whether we could not discover, the
water being between us and them, we likewise marched away, and by some Scouts
found which way they were gone, Colonel Wem Commander in chief for Sir
Williams own Brigade led the Van, had some certain Horse and Dragoons, and
spying a wing of the Enemies in sight imagining the rest of the body to be gone
before, marched over venterously, and charged the Enemy, who retreated, to
their maine body, our Forces following them were overmatcht and so lost some
men and some Drakes, with 3. Colors the rest were forced to retreat, and came
over a Bridge called Crapridden, crying the fields lost, the fields lost: but
by Gods providence and the courage of the Kentish Regiment and the City
Hamlets, we got down two Drakes to the Bridge and stayed them off so bravely,
and gave them so good play all day, that ere night they could not brag of their
winnings, there we lay all night, looking one upon the other (when sleep would
give leave.) Next morning those that had wearied themselves, Saturday, and that
night marched up to our body, where we lay all Sunday facing one the other, but
did little; at 10 or 11. a clock at night a foolish fellow of our Regiment,
shot off his Musket, (the Watch being set) which made an Alarm in the Enemies
quarters, they shot at our Forlorn hope, which lay down by their Works, and
we shot at them, but we were there over-cunning for them, for our Firelocks
were placed under a hedge, and light match hung alone on pallisadoes a Musket
shot off; before day they discharged a piece of Ordnance, and gave us an Alarm
likewise, we made our selves ready to entertain it, but heard no more of them,
for as soon as day approached we missed them, and they were marched away, we
marched down to the Bridge, and as we marched, spied that side of Banbury next
to us on fire, which the Castle had done for giving some small entertainment to
our soldiers, then we marched over the Bridge wherein our march up the lane to
Moriton, a mile off the Bridge (which lane the enemy enjoyed before) we found
many dead corpse lying naked and unburied, 40 graves in the highway, and many
stately horses, and in the Church and Churchyard at Moriton, were many
Commanders buried who had been flame in the fight, one Lord (as the Country
men say) 2. Colonels, and other Officers. We marched thence on Monday the
first of July, and that night we lay at a poor Village called Preston, which
had been former^y burnt; on Tuesday toward Torciter, where we met Major Brown
and his forces, who marched with us (we lying Tuesday and Wednesday near
Torciter) On Thursday we marched toward Northampton, where he left our Forces
and went for Greenland House, which he has since taken, being then 7000. Horse
and Foot; We have since our advance from Farnham, marched 500. miles and
upwards, and lost very few of our City Brigade, no Commanders except Colonel
Hoblin, and Captain Grove of the white Auxilliaries, both good Commanders, who
falling sick after we came from Banbury, and dying in Northampton, are both
brought up to be buried here in London, their whole Regiment being likewise
come up with the Colors; The Hamlets with Col^onel Prince of the Yellow
Regiment being daily expected (according to Sir James Harringtons promise, who
is Major General of the City Brigade.
