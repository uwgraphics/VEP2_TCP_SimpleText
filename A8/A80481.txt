THE COPY OF A LETTER Sent from Shirbourne relating the skirmish between the
Earl of Bedford and the Cavalliers there.
I Have now lighted on a fair oppertunity to return you kind greetings by
this Gentleman, who (I believe) is like to be one of the first that can give
you a true information of what befell at Shirbourne on Saturday last, where
(with grief of heart) he beheld the sad work of that day, which from his
mouth I took as near as I could possibly, least his short abode in London (as
he tells me) should not give him time to visit you himself, (his haste and
business you may well guess) not brooking any delay or loss of time.

Upon Friday last (I take it the first day of September) the Earl of Bedford
marched to Shirbourne, with about five thousand horse and foot under his
command, unto whom fifteen hundred more from Dorchester (but came out of
Devonshire) did join themselves, having in their march thitherward, by their
over careless looking to their powder, blown up four of their poor
soldiers, and hurt ten more, which they sent back again to Dorchester. With
this power of about six thousand men in all, the Lord General pitched his
Camp within a mile and a half of Shirbourne, behind a hill, in the evening
upon friday sending out some sallyes of horse to scour and view the coasts,
that he might be secured from danger at his back, while he wholly bent his
forces upon the good work in hand, that night some of his soldiers being
weary of lying in the open field two nights together, and having eaten nothing
upon Wedendsday, and on Thursday but one meal, and their provision being not
so good altogether as was to be desired, did get away from him, but not any
considerable number, upon satterday in the forenoon he marched with all his
forces toward Shirbourne Townes-end, and in the way the ordinance from the
Castle, being discharged against him somewhat endammaged him, some few of his
horse being then lost, but no number considerable, then marching to the Town,
at the Townes-end diverse Musketeers out of ditches and pits played very hotly
upon his men upon all sides on a sudden, and annoied them very much, but not so
much as some have reported, who report not always according to truth, but
according to their malignant wishes and desires, from which God deliver us, the
truth is, that it was Gods pleasure to suffer some men on our side to be
slain, about two hundred, but not many above that number. The Cavalliers
having hidden themselves for the most part in pits and ditches, whence they did
this mischief, for had they appeared, I believe they had not carried it with
so little loss as the hurt only of four of their men, for they say they lost
none, and this was the passage of that sorrowful day, which with grief of heart
I have acquainted you with, least you should be deluded with other false
relations more to our prejudice then the loss of that day. The night being
come, very many soldiers got them away being weary, but we doubt not but they
will return speedily when they have poor souls a little refreshed
themselves, then they will be better able and more serviceable then ever
before; the next day being the sabbath, the Cavalliers in the Castle did not
much stir that I hear of, but our men got them away apace, and crawled of all
four through the corn, at last the General caused the horse to encompasse
them to keep them in, and then the Cavalliers from the Castle did some hurt
among the horse, but the next day my Lord finding his numbers much decreased,
for he had but a thousand or less now left, resolved to return to Dorchester
where he is at this present, but he burnt two houses at the Towns end before
he went, and a ricke of hay, which with the corn that is trampled will be a
thousand pounds loss to the Cavalliers and their adherents, that ungodly
Lunsford and his Brother is here among them, God deliver us from such bloody
butchers, and send us peace if it be his will. This Marquess is now three
thousand strong, but I doubt not but the wisdom of the Parliament will soon
rid us of him and his ungracious Cavalliers: I have no more to write, but
shortly you shall hear from me, in the mean time be not disheartened, for I am
confident my next letter will afford you more comfortable tidings, for we daily
expect such strong supplies as will soon send these bloody Cavalliers packing
from the rest.
