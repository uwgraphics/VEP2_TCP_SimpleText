An excellent Ballad of George Barnwel an Apprentice of London, who was undone
by a strumpet, who having thric^ robbed his Master, and murdered his Uncle in
Ludlow.
The tune is, The Merchant.
ALL youths of fair England,
that dwell both far and near
Regard my story that I tell,
and to my Song give ear;
A London Lad I was,
a Merchants Prentice bound,
My name George Barnwel that did spend
my Master many a pound,
Lake heed of Harlots then
and their enticing trains;
For by that means I have been brought
to hang alive in Chains.
As I upon a day
was walking through the street,
About my Masters business,
I did a woman meet;
A gallant dainty Dame
and sumptuous in attire,
With smiling looks she greeted me
and did my name require.
Which when I had declared
the gave me then a kiss,
And said if I would come to her,
I should have more then this,
Infaith my Boy (quoth she)
such news I can thee tell,
As shall rejoice thy very heart,
then come where I do dwell,
Fa^r Mistress then said I,
if I the place may know,
This evening I will be with you,
for I abroad must go.
To gather money in;
that is my Masters due,
And ere that I do home return,
I Will come and visit you.
Good Barnwel then (quoth she)
do thou to Shoreditch come,
And ask for Mis. Milwood there
next door unto the Gun.
And trust me on my truth,
if thou keep touch with me
For thy friends sake as my own heart
thou shall right welcome be.
Thus parted we in peace,
and home I passed right,
Then went abroad and gathered in
by six a clock at night,
An undred pounds and one,
with bag under mine arm,
I went to Mis. Milwoods house
and thought on little harm.
And knocking at the door
straight way her self came down.
Rustling in most brave attire,
her Hood and silken Gown.
Who though her beauty bright,
so gloriously did shine.
That she amazed my dazzling Eyes,
she seemed so Divine.
She took me by the hand,
and with a modest grace,
Welcome sweet Barnwel then (quoth. she)
unto this homely place,
Welcome ten thousand times
more welcome then m^ brother*
And better welcome I protest
then any one or other:
And seeing I have thee found,
as good as thy word to be,
A homely supper ere thou part
thou shall take here with me,
O pardon me quoth I,
fair Mistress I you pray,
For why, out of my Masters house
so long I dare not stay.
Alas good Sir she said,
art thou so strictly tied,
You may not with your dearest friend
one hour or two abide:
Faith then the case is hard
if it be so (quoth she)
I would I were a Prentice bound
to live in house with thee.
Therefore my sweetest George,
list well what I do say,
And do not blame a woman much
her fancy to bewray.
Let not affections force
be counted lewd desire,
Nor think it not immodesty
I would thy love require.
With that she turned aside
and with a blushing red,
A mournful motion she bewrayed,
by holding down her head:
A Hankerchiffe she had
all wrought with silk and gold,
Which she to stop her trickling tears
against her eyes did hold.
This thing unto my sight
was wondrous rare and strange
And in my mind and inward thoughts
it wrought a sudden change.
That I so hardy was,
to take her by the hand.
Saying sweet Mistress why do you
so sad and heavy stand:
Call me no Mistress now,
but Sara thy true friend,
Thy servant Sara honoring thee,
until her life has end.
If thou would here allege,
thou art it years a boy,
So was Adonis, yet was he
fair Venus Love and Joy.
Thus I that nere before
of women found such grace,
And seeing now so fair a Dame
gave me a kind embrace.
I supt with her that night,
with joys that did abound,
And for the same paid presently
in money twice three pound.
A hundred kisses then,
for my farewell she gave,
Saying sweet Barnwel when shall I
again thy company have:
O stay not too long my dear
sweet George have me in mind,
Her worlds bewitched his childish-^^^^
she uttered them so kind
So that I made a vow,
next sunday without fail,
With my sweet Sara once again
to tell some pleasant tale.
When she heard me say so
the tears fell from her eyes,
O George quoth she if thou do fail
thy Sara sure will dye,
Though long yet so at last
the pointed time was come.
That I must with my Sara meet
having a mighty sum.
Of money in my hand.
unto her house went I
Whereas my Love upon her bed,
in saddest sort did lie.
What ayls my hearts Delight?
my Sara Dear (quoth he)
Let not my Love lament and grieve,
nor sighing pain and dye,
But tell to me my Dearest friend
what may thy woes amend?
And thou shall lack no means of help
tho forty pound I spend.
With that she turned her head,
and sickly thus did say,
O my sweet George my grief is great
ten pounds I have to pay,
Unto a cruel wretch,
and God he knows (quoth she)
I have it not. Tush rise quoth I
and take it here of me,
Ten pounds, nor ten times ten
shall make my love decay,
Then from his Bag into her lap,
he cast ten pounds straight way,
All blithe and pleasant then,
to banqueting they go,
She proffered him to lie with her
and said it should be so.
And after that same time,
I gave her store of Coin,
Yea sometimes fifty pound at once
all which I did purloyn.
And thus I did pass on,
until my Master then,
Did call to have his reckoning in
cast up among his men
The which when as I heard,
I knew not what to say,
For well I knew that I was out,
two hundred pound that day
Then from my Master straight
I run in secret sort.
And unto Sara Milwood then
my state I did report,
But how she used this youth,
in this his extreme need,
The which did her necessity,
so often with money feed.
The second part behold,
shall tell it forth at large,
And shall a strumpets wily ways
with all her tricks discharge,
HEre coms young Barnwel unto thee
sweet Sara my delight,
I am undone except thou stand
my faithful friend this night
Our Master to command accounts
has just occasion found,
And I am come behind the hand
almost two hundred pound.
And therefore knowing not at all,
what answer for to make,
And his displeasure to escape,
my way to thee I take.
Hoping that in this extremity,
thou will my succor be.
That for a time he may remain
in secret here with thee.
With that she knit and bent, her brows
and looking all aquoy
Quoth. she what should I have to do,
with any prentice boy?
And seeing you have purloynd and got
your Masters goods away
The case is had, and therefore here
I mean thou shall not stay
Why sweetheart thou know he said
that all which I did get,
I gave it and did spend it all
upon thee every whit:
Thou know I loved thee so well,
thou could not ask the thing,
But that I did incotinent,
the same unto thee bring.
Quoth she thou art a paultry Jack
to charge me in this sort,
Being a woman of credit good.
and known of good report.
And therefore this I tell thee flat,
be packing with good speed
I do defy thee from my heart,
and scorn thy filthy deed
Is this the love and friendship which
thou did to me protest,
Is this the greatest affection which
you seemed to exprese:
Now fie on all deceitful shows
the best is I may speed,
To get a lodging any where,
for money in my need.
Therefore false woman now farewell
while twenty pound does last,
My Anchor in some other Haven.
I will with wisdom cast
When she perceiving by his words
that he had money store.
That she had gul'd him in such sort
it grieved her heart full sore.
Therefore to call him back again,
she did suppose it best.
Stay George quoth she, thou art too quick
wyh man I do but jest?
Think thou for all my passed speech
that I would let thee go:
Faith no quoth, she my love to thee
I wis is more then so.
You will not deal with Prentice boys
I heard you even now swear
Therefore I will not trouble you:
my George hark in thine ear,
Thou shall not go to night quoth. she
what chance so ere befall,
But man we will have a bed for thee,
or else the Devil take all,
thus I yt was with wiles bewitched
and snared with fancy still
Had not the power to put away
or to withstand her will
Then Wine and Wine I called in
and ch^^r upon good cheer
And nothing in ye world I thought,
for Sarahs love too dear.
Whilst I was in her company,
in joy and merriment,
And all too little I did think,
that I upon her spent,
A fig for care and careful thought
when all my gold is gone,
In faith my girl we will have more
who ere it light upon.
My Father's rich, why then quoth. I,
would I want any gold,
With a Father indeed quoth she
a son may well be bold.
I have a sister richly wed,
I Will rob her ere I Will want:
Why then quoth. Sara they may well,
consider of your want.
Nay more, then this an Uncle I have
at Ludlovv he does dwell.
He is a Graster which in wealth,
does all the rest excel.
Ere I will live in lack quoth he,
and have no coin for thee,
I Will rob ye Church and murder him
why should you not quoth she,
Ere I would want, were I a man,
or live in poor estate,
On father, friends and all my kin
I would my talons grate;
For without money George quoth. she
a man is but a beast,
And bringing money thou shall be
always my chiefest guest.
For say thou should pursued be,
with twenty Hues and cries
And with a warrant searched for
with Argo's hundred eyes,
Yet in my house thou shall be safe
such privy ways there be,
That if they sought an hundred year
they could not find out thee,
and so carousing in their cups
their pleasures to content,
George Barnwel had in little space
his money wholly spent.
Which being done. to Ludlow then
he did provide to go,
To rod his wealthy Uncle then
his Minion would it so,
And once or twice he thought to take
his father by the way,
But y^ he thought his Master there
took order for his stay,
Directly to his Uncle then.
he rode with might and main,
Where with good welcome and good cheer
he did him entertain.
A sennit space he stayed there
until it chanced so,
His Uncle with fat Cattle did
unto a Market go.
His ki^sman needs must ride with him
and when he saw right plain,
Great store of money he had took
in coming home again,
Most suddenly within a wood
He struck his Uncle down,
And beat his brains out of his head
so sore he cracked his Crown.
And fourscore pound in ready coin
out of his purse he took.
And coming unto London straight
the Country quite forsook,
To Sara Milwood, then he came,
showing his store of gold,
And how he had his Uncle slain,
to her he plainly told,
Tush it is no matter George quoth. she
so we the money have,
To have good ^heer in folly sort
and deck us fine and brave.
And thus they lived in fifthy sort,
till all his store was gone,
And means to get them any more
I wis poor George had none.
And therefor now in rattling sort
she thrust him out of Door,
Which is the just reward they get,
that spend upon a Whore.
O do me not this vile disgrace,
in this my need quoth he,
She called him thief and murderer,
with all despite may be:
And to the Constable she went
to have him apprehended,
And showed in each degree how far
he had the Law offended,
When Barnwel saw her drist,
to Sea he got straight way,
Where fear and Dread, and Conscience sting
upon him still does stay.
Unto the Mayor of London then
he did a Letter write,
Wherein his own and Sarahs faults
he did at large recite,
Whereby she apprehended was
and then to Ludlow sent.
where she was judged, condemnd and hanged
for murder incontinent.
And there this gallant Queen did dye
this was her greatest gains.
For murdering in Polonia
was Barnwel hanged in chains
Lo here is the end of wilful youth,
that after Harlots haunt,
Who in the spoil of other men
about the streets do flaunt.
FINIS.
