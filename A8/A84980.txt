My Lords and Gentlemen,
WE received this enclosed paper the last night, from the hands of a very well
affected Citizen, it was delivered him by an Officer of the City Militia who
being invited to meet some Citizens at Skinners hall upon Wednesday last, with
diverse others to sign the same, and offering to dispute against the matter of
it, to show how dangerous and illegal it was, was silenc't and told that it
was not to be disputed, but to be signed and joined in, there being diverse
Citizens and others at the same place for that purpose, which when he
understood, he took this printed Copy away with him,

By the contents of which when you read it you will easily perceive what it
tends to, and how desperate and dangerous it is to the hazard of the whole
Kingdom, and to frustrate all those endeavors of the Parl. the army and
Kingdom for an happy settlement, and likewise to precipitate all into a new
and bloody war, we cannot therefore but acquaint you that we look on this as a
business set on foot by the malice of some desperate minded men, this being
their last Engine for the putting all into confusion, when they could not
accomplish their wicked ends by other means. To this have all secret listings
tended, and we wish that the needless and superfluous Listing of Auxilaries
and connivance at the continuance of the Reformadoes about the Cities of
London, and Westminster, have not had the same aim, and by this we hope it
will appear that our iealousies and fears of some such desperate designs to
be harched in and about the City, (considering the temper of men there) have
not bin groundless, nor our desires to draw near the City of London with the
Army to disapoint and break all such plots, and to free the Parliament from
the violence of them have not bin without just cause, and we desire all
indifferent men to judge whether our withdrawing from the City in obedience to
the Parliaments command was for their and the Kingdoms security or not: we
wonder that diverse men did calumniate that our marching so near the City, and
put so bad Representations upon it, as that it tended to force the Parliament,
or to plunder the City seeing our doing so, was to break that black design
which now begins to show it self in its colors, whereas indeed our
consciences witness with us, that our aims were clear and ^^nest tending to
restore the Parliament into its just liberty, which was much abated in the eyes
of all the Kingdom, and no doubt by the Authors and ^^^ntrivers of this new
Covenant and engagement; some whereof have been so far from assisting to put
the Reformadoes and other dangerous persons out of the Lines that now they are
called to join in this conspiracy: we entreat you to give the Parl. a full
Representation of these things, which that you may do; we have sent you the
Papers, together with such informations as may give them an opportunity to
discover the bottom of this business, we were marching from London (when we
received this Information) in obedience to the Parliament, and to give the City
more content, and to stop the mouths of slanderers; But if such Designs, so
distructive to the Parliament, and the work in hand be suffered to go on, or
that the Parliament be interrupted in the freedom of their debates and
proceedings as we hear, within these few days they were, by those that are
invited to partake in this Consideracy: we beg it of the Parliament, as they
tender their own safety, the Peace of the Kingdom, and preventing of a second
War, as they would not have the Kingdom loose the fruit and benefit of all
the blood and treasure that has been spent in this cause, that they would not
suffer their freedom and liberty to be endangered by such designs as these,
they having an Army which by the Blessing of God, in spite of all that theirs
and the Kingdoms enemies can do, will stand and fall with them, and be found
faithful and obedient to them in all things, and as ready to relieve Ireland,
when the Peace and rights of this Kingdom are seried: We write not this to
desire the Parliament to invite us to march up to them, we care not how great a
distance we are from London, if it be the Parliaments pleasure, and consists
with their security, and the breaking of those combinations which are hatched in
the Bowels of the City, we are hastening our Proposalls which are for the
general settlement, and which (we are confident) will satisfy all that love
truth and peace: But we see plainly, we need more to intend security then have
cause to expect to bring things to an happy issue by Treaty while such designs
are on foot: We pray you therefore that the Parliament would speedily and
thoroughly inquire into, and break these Designs wherein as in all things, else
we shall be ready to serve them as they shall judge it needful, and when they
shall command us.

By the appointment of his Excellency Sir Thomas Fairfax, and his Council of
War. Signed, John Rushworth, Secr.
Alesbury July 23. 1647.
BY a Printed Paper come to our hands this day (a Coppie whereof you receive
herewith) we still find, and clearly and evidently perceive that some evil
Spirits within the City of London, maliciously disaffected to the Peace of this
Kingdom, do secretly and wickedly endeavor, to bring about that mischief
upon the Kingdom, which we have so much feared, and by all our several
addresses unto you sought to prevent; which indeed are of that dangerous
consequence as we can expect no other issue from, then the unavoydable engaging
the Kingdom in a second War, if not timely and effectually prevented by your
wisdom and diligence. We must further observe unto you, that whatoever design
is intended in the forssad Paper, is contrary to the Authority of Parliament,
and indirect opposition to the proceedings of the Army (which the 2. Houses
have owned as theirs, and approved of their fidelity by committing the forces
of the Kingdom of England, Dominion of Wales, and Islands of Garnesey and
Iersey, under the Generals care and Command) and therefore cannot be effected,
but by force of Arms against the Parliament and their Armies, which in
probability may involve the whole Kingdom in blood; but must necessarily begin
within your own Bowels, and draw the Seat and misery of War upon you and
your City.

Also we desire you would consider, whether we have not just cause to suspect
that an evil party lurkes within the City ready to distemper it, and the whole
Kingdom upon every occasion, and whether it be probable such persons desire a
happy Close between the King and the Parliament, (at least such as will be for
the Kingdoms good) when they take upon them the boldness to make new offers
to His Maj. with solemn engagements to make good the same during the time that
the Parliament had given us leave to make tender of, and treat with their
Commissioners about those things which tend to a general settlement. And
therefore we cannot but desire, that you would take a speedy course timely to
suppress this great evil, and to prevent all of this nature for the future,
and by making some of those examples who have been active to carry on this
business: We have not had time to enquire into particulars, out shall give you
only one instance of a meeting at Skinners-Hall, concerning this business,
where some persons have been very active, (the names of some of whom we have
given to your Commissioners) and also the names of other Citizens who will
testify their carriage there.

Lastly, we cannot but desire you to concur^ with us in our desires to the
Parliament, to put the Militia into the hands of those that had it before;
without which we can have no assurance that the City will be free from designs
of this nature, nor can we expect to see a happy Close.

By the appointment of his Excellency Sir Thomas Fairfax and his Council (...)
Alisbury July 23. ^.
To the Right Honorable the Lord Mayor, the right worshipful the Aldermen and
Commons of the City of London in the Common or Guild Hall of the City of
London, assembled.
The humble Petition of the Citizens, Commanders, Officers, and Soldiers of
the Trained Bands and Auxilaries, the young men, and Apprentices of the Cities
of London, and Westminster, Sea Commanders, Seamen and Watermen, together with
diverse other Commanders, Officers, and Soldiers within the Line of
Communication, and Parishes, mentioned in the Weekly Bill of Mortality.
Shows,
THat your petitioners (taking into serious consideration how Religion, his
Majesty's honor and safety, the privileges of Parliament and liberties of
the Subjects, are at present greatly endangered, and like to be destroyed, and
also sadly weighing with our selves, what means might likely prove the most
effectual, to procure a firm, and lasting peace, without a further effusion
of Christian English blood, have therefore entered into a solemn engagement,
which is hereunto annexed, and do humbly and earnestly desire, that this whole
City may join together by all lawful and possible means, as one man, in
hearty endeavors for his Majesty's present coming up to his two houses of
Parliament, with honor, safety, and freedom, (and that without the nearer
approach of the Army) there to confirm such things as he has granted in his
Message of the 12th. of May last, in answer to the Propositions of both
Kingdoms, and that by a personal Treaty with his two houses of parliament, and
the Commissioners of the Kingdom of Scotland, such things as yet are in
difference may be speedily iettled, and a firm, and lasting peace established;
all which we desire may be presented to both houses of parliament from this
honorable Assembly,

And we shall pray.

A Solemn engagement, of the Citizens, Commanders Officers, and soldiers of
the Trainbands, and Auxiliaries, the young men, and prentices of the Cities of
London and Westminster Sea Comanders, Seamen, and Watermen, together with
diverse others the Comanders, Officers and soldiers, within the lines of
Communication, and Parishes mentioned in the Weekly Bill of Mortality.
WHereas we have entered into a solemn League and Covenant, for Reformation
and defense of Religion, the honor and hapynesse of the King, and the peace
and safety of the the 3 Kingdoms, of England, Scotland, and Ireland; All which
we do eminently perceive not only to be endangered, but ready to be
destroyed, we do therefore in pursuance of our said Covenant, Oath of
Allegiance, oath of every freeman of the Cities of London, and Westminster, and
protestation solemnly engage our selves, and vow unto Almighty God, that we will
to the utmost of our power cordially endeavor that his Majesty may speedily
come to his two houses of Parliament, with honor, safety, and freedom, (and
that without the nearer approach of the Army) there to confirm such things as
he has granted in his Message of the 12 of May last, in answer to the
Propositions of both Kingdoms, and that by a personal Treaty with his two
houses of Parliament, and the Com. of the Kingdom of Soctland, such things as
are yet in difference may be speedily settled, and a firm and lasting peace
established, for the effecting hereof we do protest and reobleige our selves
as in the presence of God the searcher of all hearts, with our lives and
fortunes, to endeavor what in us lies to preserve and defend his Majesty's
Royal Person, and authority, the privileges of parliament, and liberty of the
Subject in their full and constant freedom, the Cities of London and
Westminster Lines of Communication, and Parishes mentioned in the Weekly Bill
of Mortality, and all others that shall adhere with us, to the said Covenant,
and oath of Allegiance, oath of every freeman of London, and Westminster, and
Protestation, Nor shall We by any means admit suffer or endure any neutrality
in this Common cause of God, the King, and Kingdom as we do expect the
Blessing of Almighty God, whole help we crave, and wholly devolve our selves
upon in this our undertaking.

I Do hereby require the chief Officer present with every Troop and Company,
to make strict inquiry what Cavaliers have been listed and entertained in their
Troops or Companies, since the Muster preceding the last Muster; And that all
such chief Officers shall presently upon such enquiry as before, put forth of
their Troops or Companies of such Cavaliers as they shall find in their
troops or Companies from such Musters (as before) And before they receive any
pay upon this last Muster, they shall expunge the Names of all such Cavaliers
out of their Muster Rolls, as they shall have put out of their Troops or
Companies. And if it shall hereafter appear (that any chief Officer present
with their Troop or Company) shall neglect to put forth, or cashiere such
Cavaliers in manner as before, or receive any for the time to come upon proof
thereof made, he shall be liable to a Council of War, and be accordingly
proceeded against.

Given under my hand the 21. of July, 1647. Thomas Fairefax,

FJNJS.
