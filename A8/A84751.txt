Four SPEECHES Delivered In Guild Hall, on Friday the sixth of October, 1643.
At a Common Hall.
Mr. Solicitor his Speech at Guild Hall, on Friday, October 6. 1643.
Worthy Aldermen, and Gentlemen, and Citizens of this Famous City of London,
THe cause of the calling of this Assembly of this Common Hall, it was the
business of Scotland, I think it is not unknown to many of you, that about
two months since both the Houses of Parliament did send a Committee into
Scotland to desire the assistance of our brethren of Scotland in this War:
the Committee has from thence sent Propositions to both the Houses, whereby
we see their willingness to come to our assistance: but one part of it is,
that without some supplies of Money, they are not able at all to come into this
assistance, The Houses considering the necessity of their coming in, and of
speedy supplies of Money to that purpose, they did send a Committee, and did
desire that a Common Council might be called, which was done upon Monday last,
and they did thither send a Committee, with desire that the Common Council
would take that into consideration, that is, the necessity of their coming,
and speedy supplies to be raised. And for the effecting of this, not having
any other means so near at hand as that, they did desire that the
Common Council would appoint a Committee out of themselves to consider of this
business with the Committee of the House of Commons: These they met, and have
been together these two days considering of it, that is, Wednesday and
Thursday, and they did intend, and do still, to send to diverse of those that
are able and rich of this City, to the intent that they might see, what they
would lend to this business; and to tender to them such security, as they
conceive to be very convenient and fitting for those that are willing to lend
Money: but when they had entered upon the business, and* considering the speed,
and the necessity that the supply should be expedited, they thought that would
be too long a way, yet resolved to prosecute it still, but withal they did
desire, that my Lord Major would be pleased to call a Court of Aldermen this
morning, (which he did) and likewise a Common Hall, to the intent that the
necessity of the raising of this money speedily might be declared to you,
because the other would be a longer way; which though it be intended still to
be prosecuted; yet when you are all here together, we may the better know your
affections to this business, and that the Money may be speedily raised, though
not the whole, yet it will be somewhat to the business, if some considerable
sum might speedily be sent away.

I conceive there is no need to acquaint you with the benefits that will
redound to this kingdom, and the advantages we shall have by a nearer
association with them, and by their coming in, to this purpose for our
assistance; the benefits certainly when we consider of them, are many. As
first,

This great cause which is now in agitation, that by this means will be much
secured; it will be assured to us, that the event, and the success of it (by
Gods blessing) will be made a great deal the certainer: If they do not come
in, then we are to consider how we stand. Certainly, the Parties they are very
equal in this business, and where the Parties are equal, the success must
needs be dangerous, and very uncertain. Now we all of us see, that all ranks
and degrees of men, even from the highest Lords, to the meanest Commoners, they
are engaged on both sides; and if the advantage be of either side, it is in the
other, because that the greater part of the Nobility and Gentry we know they
are the other way. Likewise if we consider the Citi^^ and Towns of this
kingdom, that there is Newcastle, that there is Yorkshire, that there is
Shrewsbury, that there is Bristoll, that there is Chester, and that there is
Exeter, and diverse others Cities and great Towns in their custody.

If we go through all the Counties of the Kingdom, we see there the greatest
parts of the Northern parts possessed wholly by the Earl of Newcastle,
Northumberland, Cumberland, Westmerland, Yorkshire, and some other parts. So
in the West, go to other Counties, there is a mixture in all of them, that we
cannot say there is any part of the Kingdom free; so that the mixture seems
to be of the people likewise, if not the greater party the other way.

If we consider likewise the events and successes; as we on the one side have
taken Portsmouth, Chichester, and some other places, so they on the other side
have taken Exeter, and Bristoll, and other places. If we consider the events of
the Skirmishes, Fights, and Battles that have been; we cannot say, that on
any side has been any complete Victory; that at Edgehill, it pleased God to
give us a deliverance, we find it was no complete Victory, by those things
that followed; so this at Newbury lately no complete victory, for had it been
so, the War had been at an end, so that which way soever we look, unless
we call them in to our assistance, certainly the Parties on both sides, are
very equally engaged; and certainly when two men of equal strength do
wrestle, it is an even lay which of them will give the fall; as long as the
balances stand so even, it is very uncertain which way they will weigh down.

We are to consider, (that in respect that the danger is such, and the event of
the War so uncertain, without their coming in) what the cause is that is
lost, in case the day should be theirs; certainly considering that the Papists
in Ireland are wholly engaged, that the Papists in England are wholly engaged,
that the Prelates and their Party are wholly engaged, that there are diverse
that are Neuters, and ill-disposed men, that they likewise incline that way:
Considering that that Party is acted by Jesuiticall Counsels, for certainly
they are behind the Curtain, though they are not so visible to us: I say,
when this is considered, who are the Parties that shall get this day, it is
very easy to prognosticate what the loss will be, no less then of Religion,
and of our Laws, and of our Liberties: In a word, if that that Party do
prevail, I am afraid we have lost all; and therefore those other things, they
will not be so considerable which I shall tell you of. We know the great
Loanes and Contributions that have been made by the Worthy Citizens of this
City, and by diverse other well-affected persons throughout the Kingdom; the
Money, the Plate, the Horses, and other things for this War too, they will
be lost: but not only so, but certainly, that these have been lent to the
Parliament for the maintaining of the War, against that Party, this will b^e
good reason why they should take all away. The public Faith likewise of both
Houses of Parliament, and so the whole Kingdom, certainly that must be
violated, and if that should be so, if that we should be ove^born in this
cause, it will easily be foreseen, whether any future Parliament will be
enabled to stand up for the defense of Religion, and the Liberties of the
People. We may add to this the Charters and the Franchises of this great
City, it will be easily foreseen, what will be the event of that, whether they
will be continued to you, yea or no, considering what affection you have born to
this cause. Certainly in former time^, the Charters and the privileges of this
City, they have been confirmed by Parliaments, as does appear in King John's
time, in Henry the third, Richard second, and always after the ending of those
great Wars, whe^in no doubt, the City (as has been seen in that) did engage
themselves, as now, in the Parliaments cause; therefore for their security,
their Charters were always confirmed; which we need not doubt will be done in
this cause; but in case the event should be otherwise, what the loss will be
in that way, you may easily see; so that all is at stake, and if we bring not
them in to our assistance, for ought I know, we are at fairs to lose the game,
as win^^ it, and if any mana estate here, stood upon the like c^su^lty, I
believe he would give some considerable sum to ensure it, in the office of
Policies* Thus we stand in case they are no^ called in the loss so great, that
is the loss of all, the event so uncertain.

In case they be called in, we are to consider then what alteration this is
like to make* we are therefore to consider how it comes about that the Party
comes to be so equal, that so many should engage themselves on the other
Party, as we see they do; certainly a great many of them do it, being
uncertain in their judgments to which side to cleave. Another Party they do
it, because that they out of fear desire to keep their Estates, and stand
Neuters. For the first of those, certainly both at home and abroad, those that
are averse, they look upon us as a Protestant Kingdom, but divided among our
selves; they hear Protestations on both sides, that both Parties do protest
to maintain the Protestant Religion, the Laws of the Kingdom, and the Liberty
of the Subject; and they see and read the Declarations that go out on both
sides, and the matter of fact being that that makes the cause, they know not
what to believe of that; for when they read the several Declarations, they see
that affirmed by one party, that is denied of the other, so that indeed they
know not which way to bend themselves to believe, (of the matter of fact, I
mean:) But now a great many after the case has been stated, as it has been
on both sides b^ these Declarations, when they shall see that this Kingdom of
Scotland, to which Declarations have been sent by both Parties, (for so they
have, the King has sent on his side, and the Parliament has sent on their
side also) when they shall see the Kingdom of ^cotland has sent a Committee
into this Kingdom, to inform themselves of the business how it stood, to the
intent they might know how to carry themselves between both Parties; I say,
when after all this, they shall see a whole Protestant Kingdom, as one Man, a
Protestant Kingdom that has had differences heretofore, and those differences
have been settled, when they have been in the same distractions as we have,
and so settled, as that it has been with a clear Declaration of their
innocencies, that they had just cause to do, what they had don't, and went away
as they did, with that full satisfaction they have given to the world: I say,
when they shall see such men, as have for so long a time stood by as a third
Party, and Spectators only, and lookens on; when they shall see a Kingdom,
that is altogether unbiased, that has the same King* lives in the same
Island, that has the same Religion: I say, when they shall behold a whole
Kingdom to declare for the one Party, that is, for our Party; when they shall
see them not only do so, but enter into a League and Covenant, and that by
oath with us, for the maintaining of this Religion: when they shall see them
engaging their whole Kingdom as one man, in a War for the maintaining of this
cause: I say, certainly that must be a convincing, silencing argument to all
these men, that this is the Party that does maintain really, and in truth, the
true Protestant Religion, the Laws of the Realm, and the Liberties of the
Subject: That is for the first.

The second is, there is another Party, that are well enough satisfied in their
judgments, but out of fear of their estates, and other sinister, by and base
ends, (for so they may be called, for as this Covenant calls it a detestable
Neutrality* so may we) I say, when these Parties shall see such an addition of
strength to the one side, their own principles of fear will reach them to go
to that that is the stronger side. But admitting that men stood in their
judgments, and in Neutrality, as they now do, and that their coming in did
not alter one man; yet we are to consider what the strength is that they do
bring in wi^h them, and what that is like to do, admitting the parties to be
as equally engaged, as now they be; and that is by their own Propositions,
that when they come in, they intend to come in with 18000 Foot, with 1000*
Dragoneers, and 2000 Horse, with 21000 Horse and Foot, with a Train of
Artillery proportionable and suitable to such an Army: Certainly, by the
blessing of God, such a force to be added to the one Party, that is now even,
it cannot but in all likelihood carry down the scales, and alter the whole ^ame,
and the state of the business. Why? certainly two against one in all
^usinesses, that makes odds. If we have the addition of that whole Kingdom to
this Party that is even with the other, or near so, now we may easily judge
of the event. This is the first benefit I shall propound to you, we are like
to reap by their coming in, that is, the assuring of this great cause, that so
much conc^^nes us.

The second is this, which I shall propound to you, that is* that it will be
for our profit, that it will ease the War, that it will make the charge* and
the burden of it to (...) This does arise partly out of what has been said,
that their coming in, it will shorten the War, for as long as the parties
ar^ equal, it must needs lengthen and protract the War; when two scales are
almost equally balanced, we know for a great while it falls on the right
hand, and on the left hand, and it is a great while before they stand still; so
that if the War be protracted and lengthened, that will be spent in time, and
a great deal more, then a good round sum will be in making a sudden
conclusion of it; I think every Lessee, he had rather pay a good round Fine,
than for many ^^ers together, to sit upon a great Rent* this may be our
condition, if we do not bring them in, besides the loss of all at last; But
the benefit will appear, by the shortning of the War, in this further:

By those miseries, and that poverty* and that calamity, which a long War
must of necessity bring with it; The wealth of this Kingdom (I suppose*) it
arises out of the soil, and the ground of the Kingdom, and it arises out of
the M^nufactures, and out of the Trade of the Kingdom; These again do consist
principally in Rents and in Debts; certainly Debtors by having their estates
plundered, and wholly taken away from them, and the lives from many* debts will
cease* there will be no debts to be paid; the same will be likewise of
Rents, when the Cattle shall be killed up, and the Tenants plundered of all
they have, there will be no Rents paid: How will it be like, if the Wars
continue, that the Trade will be continued? for the materials of Trade by a
long War, will be wholly destroyed, and taken from us; The Sheep of the
Kingdom that bring our Woall, and the Horses, and the Cattle, that bring our
Leather and our Tallow; these three, the Wool, Leather, and Tallow, and diverse
other things, we know how many hundred Trades, even from the greatest
Merchant, to the lowest Handicrafts-man, how many they employ* these, they will
be destroyed, not only by the consumption, which the Soldier makes, that is
wastefull, but even the policy of War will require of the Enemy, (as we see
of late about Gloucester, in the Vale of Esum, the policy of War will cause, I
say, one party) ^o kill and destroy all Cattle, when the necessity of War
r^qui^^^ ^t, to s^arve out the Enemy; Besides the daily loss of Towns and
Cities, what a loss will that be to Trading, and in particular to this City?
I believe it is a sensible thing to many of you* the ^aking o^ ^^^ter, the
taking of Bris^o^, and the Trade of Newcastle stopped, and some other Cities,
what a great loss, even in point of debt, it has been to many worthy
Citizens, of this City; Besides, a long War it will consume, the very
materials of life, of food and raiment, we shall neither have meat, drink,
nor clothing, if the War con^inue, considering the burnings and devastations
that go along with it* so that for my own part, I think it is a very clear
case, that we had better buy out with a round sum, a short War, then to have
a long War continued, though it be without any charge at all; If all our horse
and foot, and trayn of Artillery, and Garrisons, were all paid to our hand, we
had better buy a short Peace, by bringing them in, than to have a long War
without charge, because of that inevitable poverty, that a long War must needs
bring to a Kingdom; this first thing that I have offered, is in point of time,
the shortening of War, the Benefit and Profit that it will be to the
Kingdom.

Secondly, We all know this War has contracted a great debt upon the
Kingdom, and it will contract far more; In case this shall be hereafter to
be paid in sheere Money and Coin, I am afraid the Kingdom is not able to pay
it at once, (I believe that all men know) Suppose this then shall be appointed
to be paid at certain years and times, what will be the event of that? I am
afraid the destruction of the Kingdom, for then the case will be thus, the
greatest part of the Lords and Gentry are engaged in the other way, and here
lies a great debt annually to be paid by the Kingdom, and certainly this will
disaffect people to all other Parliaments, when they shall yearly be under the
payments of such mo^eys, that the Parliament has contracted upon them; And
then considering who it is will operate upon the other party* for there is
another party that will not be easily reconciled to the party that has been
on the other side, and so this other party striking in the other way, what this
is like to produce, is very dangerous to me; whereas on the other side, as
long as the parties are equally engaged, as we are, without their coming, I
am afraid there will not be that force on the one side, as to make the other
side, (that is, the Papists, and the Prelates, and the other Malignants) out of
their estates to pay these debts, which their coming in, in all likelihood
will make us do* which if these debts be paid out of their estates and Lands*
I know no inconvenience will come to the Kingdom by it; for here is the case,
they that have it now in their hands, to employ i^ for the destruction of the
Kingdom, it will be only putting it in their hands, that show their good
affections to the Kingdom; so that way I conceive the debt of the Kingdom, will
be no loss at all to the Kingdom.

The third benefit is, that even the present War it will be made less
chargeable to us* and that in this* They not being come in, we have not
Newcastle, there is Nottingh^mshire, York^^^ir^, that great Country, a great
part of L^^^olnshire, the Bishopri^^ of D^rham, Northumberland, Co^^m^erland,
W^^^merland, the great^^^ part of the West, the richest part, I know, in this
Kingdom, except this City* I say, in case they come not in, they are all under
contribution* to the other side; their coming in gains New^^^^le, it gains*
as much, as the money to bring them in will cost (...) the very gaining of that
Town; and likewise when they come in, it brings all those Countries under
contribution; so that the very contribution* that those Northern Countries will
yield, it will not only pay the Scotch Army, but is likely (as it is believed)
it will make an addition for our other For^^s, that we shall have to spare for
other Forces, by that which their coming in will gain of the con^ributions of
those (...) so that I have now done with those (...) that will come ^o you in
point of Profit, and likewise the assuring of this great Cause.

The third is this, that (...) w^^ do come to a peace, when Gods time is come
that we shall have one* yet their coming in* in all (...) i^ will cause^^s to
have a better a surer* and b^tter g^dunded (...) then if they do not ^om^ in*
And likewise, what peace (...) that it will be p^r^et and be the sco^^^ for
us, (...) our posterity to reap the benefit of it: First, that their coming in
will make our Peace, in all probability the better; I beseech you, without
their coming in, what is it like to be? The p^^ties are equal, the party
that is against us, they consist of P^pi^^s, and P^elates, etc. if we come to
compound this business, what is it like to be? but that our composition will
be indeed the destruction of the Protestant Religion, and of our Liberties; I
am afraid it is very like to be the ending of that controversy between the
two women for the Child, who should be the Mother of it, that is, that the
Child should be divided; We know that our division must have caused death, I
am afraid we shall then come to be half Protestants, and half Papists, and
this neutrality of both, I am afraid it will be the destruction of the one; If
it prove not destructive, yet certainly it will prove very dangerous to us; In
diseases, if Nature be not able wholly to expel the malignity of the disease,
it afterward breaks out in botches, and one malady o^ another: A sore not
cured at bottom, it afterward festers, and breaks out, and afterward
endangers the person, as much as before; If they come not in, considering the
engagements on both sides, and considering the parties, who we must compound
with, I say, the cure is like to be very imperfect, their coming in I hope
will make it perfect; Besides, what ever the Peace is, if it be good without
their coming in, it is likely we and our posterity shall reap the fruit of
it, certainly, we have had great experiences in the times of our Ancestors,
that when divisions of this nature have been, as when the Statute of Magna
Cha^^a, was first obtained, which was with all the care the w^t of man could
devise, there was the Oath of the King, and all the Nobility of the Kingdom,
yet it was broken within twelve months after; In his Sons time twelve of the
Nobility were appointed to see it kept, that would not do the work, afterward
they appointed Gentlemen in every Country, that they should see to it* this
did not the work, it broke out from time to time; But what should we go
further? Those Laws that have been made against Papists in our memories, are
not the Laws full, that no Papist is to (...) how see we that put in
execution, and that two pa^t^ of their ^^^ates to be seized* when we see
nothing at all has been done that way. For the Petition of Right, in our
memory, how was that kept? Again, our neighbors the Netherlanders, when they
made that peace with the King of Spain, they called in this Kingdom and France,
to be witnesses to it; we see how that calling us in, to be witnesses, how
that has engaged both parties to that State at this time, and how we have
been assistant to them, and expresse^ our desires to have them thrive; But how
is it like to be, when there shall not only be our own Kingdom, but a
brother Kingdom, an entire Kingdom, one of the same Religion, with us, one that
loves their Liberties, as well as we, when they shall be engaged in point of
interest with us, when the same Law, the same Acts of Parliament that shall
compose the differences, when if it he broken on our parts, in any thing that
concerns us, they cannot conceive but it may be their case the next day,
because it all depends upon one Law, one and the same Title, and their interest
is the same; So that it there were nothing else in it, but that we were like
to have the better Peace, and on the better terms, and what ever it be; it is
likely to be kept the better, to us and our posterity, if nothing else were in
it, that were much to our advantage surely, if by some considerable sum of
money, we might have them brought in, and have them at the end of this Peace,
and interested in it as well as our selves; So that I have now done with those
Benefits, I have offered to you, that we shall have by their assistance and
coming in; I make no doubt but that most of these things were known to you all
before, and that this part has been to very little purpose, that I have
spoken* for when that both the Houses of Parliament, have seen the necessity
and benefit of it, when it was propounded to the Common Council, that they
likewise saw the necessity of it, I know it will ^ee bootlesse to use any
further Arguments to you, that you may see the benefits that will redownd by
their coming to us*

But it will be asked, notwithstanding we may receive benefit by it, how may
we be assured that they are willing? Truly, for that, by what has been
done* it will be sufficiently clear; Both Houses sent a Committee to them,
that in a little time did produce the Covenant there, approved of by their
Assembly of Divines, and by the Convention of Estates, it is co^^ hither, it
has been agreed here, it has been taken here by the House of Commons already,
and by a great many of this City; A worthy Lord, my Lord Wharton (I may name
him here) at a Common Council, he did declare to my Lord Major and Aldermen,
that their House would in few days likewise take it; this Covenant shows their
willingness (in the first place) for we by that are bound to the mutual
defense of our Religion, and preservation of our civil Liberties, for by that
we are bound to the preservation of the Liberties of Parliaments; and that
Delinquents and Malignants may be brought to their just trial; so this is
already done.

It was likewise declared by the Commissioners of Scotland, that they did not
doubt, but by this time they were taking it in that Kingdom; and their
Commissioners here they have taken it already; so that they have joined
themselves to us by oath, for the mutual preservation of Religion and Laws.

In the second place, they have showed their consent by the Propositions they
have sent to us, which are the terms upon which they are to come in; they have
not stayed here but they have proceeded to action; they have named the General
of their Army, which is my Lord General Lesley, which was their General when
they came into this Kingdom.

And likewise they have granted Commissions into all the Shires of Scotland for
the raising of Horse and Foot, and named their Colonells, Captains, and other
Officers, and listed them. There is a further progress likewise, that is, that
we have taken Berwicke already, for the facilitating of their coming in, which
may be a place of retreat for them, and a Magazine for their Ammunition and
Victuals. And since this has been taken by the Parliament, they have sent
some Troops of Horse, and certain Foot for the securing of that Town: and if
they had before known the consent of the Parliament for their having the use
of Berwicke, they had put in their Ammunition and Victual before this time
into Berwicke, which before this time surely they d^^ know; and therefore we
doubt not, but they have done the other.

Likewise further, when they come in, they intend to go on in their march,
though it be far in the year, and not to sit down in their quarters. We
know my Lord of Newca^^le did it ^ast year, we know they are as far Northern
borne, they are both in a colder Cly^^te* and therefore we doubt not of it,
and so (...) long, we hope to hear of the taking of Newcastle, which what
relief it will be to this City in the point of Coals, and other Trade, you
may easily see: Most of this to the Common Council was declared by two Worthy
Commissioners that were sent out of Scotland, my Lord Mackland, and Mr.
Henderson. But it may be said, if they be so willing, and so ready to come, and
have all things ready, what is the reason we hear not of their coming into
the Kingdom? They have answered us by their Propositions, that it is
impossible for them to do it, without some sum of Money: and that this is no
pretense, but that it is really so, we have it from our own Committee there,
we have it from all hands there: and if we consider how they have been
exhausted heretofore, I think we may easily believe it our selves: and that
their Army that is in Ireland have been 14 months without any pay at all, they
are saine to supply them with necessities, which has been four score thousand
pound, else that Army must have starved. We know they had two years War, we
promised them a brotherly assistance, and there is an act for it, but it is
known by reason of the troubles we have here at home, we have not paid them
that; so that considering the poverty of that Kingdom (without offense I
think we may say so) I say, considering the poverty of that Kingdom, it is
certain, it is not a pretense of theirs, but it is really so. Neither indeed
can we presume it, when as the Covenant and Oath they take, bind them as well
as us, that they should come to our assistance; it binds them as much to our
assistance, as that Oath bind our selves to our own assistance, and therefore
we cannot presume, that they would (being dis-ingaged of an Oath, afterward)
be willing to take that Oath, unless they did likewise know their own
necessity, that they could not come in without some sum of Money; and truly I
suppose that they cannot come in without Money, (as has been declared to you)
and that we must ground upon and build upon, for we are assured it on all
hands.

It will be then said, what is that sum? Why truly the sum that they have
sent in their Propositions, is 100000 l. I confess a great summ^, and that
that I know not how to mention in this Assembly, considering how this City has
been exhausted formerly by those great Contribution^, and by those aides that
they have given in this case. But on the other side, though I cannot indeed
tell how, when I consider the sumto press it: yet when I do consider the
inevitable danger that follows, and the great advantages that we lose by every
days delay in it. I say, when I consider them, I cannot on the other side but
press it. Let us therefore consider, in case this be not within some
convenient time raised, what an infinite disadvantage comes by it to us.

First of all, all those preparations they will be in a manner lost, if that
it be not presently raised, there will be no coming in this Winter, if there
be no coming in this Winter, no gaining of Newcastle, if no gaining of
Newcastle, no Coals, nor materials for Fuel. Nay, that is not all, but if
they do not come in now, and if we do not provide this Money, I shall
despair of their coming in at all, and that upon this ground, that if we be
not able now to raise the sum of Money, the continuance of this War, it
will more and more every day, and that sensible* dis-enable us to do it at
another time. If we cannot do it now, we shall be less able to do it, a
week, a month, a quarter of a year hence; for the War you see destroys
all Trade, (that has been opened to you before) we shall grow poorer, our
Enemies stronger; if we be not able to bring them in now, we shall never be
able to bring them in at all.

It will be desired, if it be possible to raise this great sum of Money,
what is the security shall be given? for truly it was never desired of this
city, that so much money should be given to them, but it is desired it should be
only lent, for if they come not in in time, the business is as good as lost:
they have therefore (considering this) already engaged the Public Faith of
that Kingdom, with the Public faith of this Kingdom, for the raising of
200000 l. either by borrowing of it here, or in Forain parts. Therefore this is
the first Security that is ^endered to you now, that money is a borrowing in
Parts beyond the Sea; that Money that is so borrowed, shall go on toward the
repayment of this, what ever it is that shall be lent. But besides this Public
Faith, there are diverse ways visible how this Public Faith will be
dis-engaged, that is, by the Sequestrations, for there is an Ordinance of both
Houses for 30000 l. to be raised for them out of the Sequestrations. Now this
shall not need to discourage any that so little has bin raised out of the
Sequestrations hitherto, for the Houses have been preparing the businesses a
great while, and now Michaelmas is come, all the Rents are ready, within few
weeks to bring it in; that is for so much.

Their coming in, it gains Newcastle, the gaining of Newcastle gains a great
mass of Coals that are there ready already, when they come in; and out of
that there will be likewise an Annual or a Monthly payment of the Coals,
for the dis-engaging of those that shall lend this sum. Besides, when they
come in, if they clear those Countries, we know how full of Papists, and how
full of Prelates, those Northern Countries are, as Yorkshire, but especially
the whole Bishopric of Durham, a whole County, Northumberland, Cumberland,
etc. full of Papists, full of those of the Prelaticall party, full of
Malignants, when they come in, those parts are cleared, they will be free for
three whole months, and ten days, for the dis-engaging of this, (which I
forgot to tell you before what the Scots are to do for this 100000 l.) for
they are to bring in their Train of Artillery, their 21000 Horse and Foot,
they are to continue three months and ten days in your Service, after they
come into your Kingdom, after the payment of this 100000 l. so that there is
full three months and ten days for these Counties to lie open to the
repayment of this Money; for those three months they are to be without pay.

These are the principal things, that we have yet thought upon for the
dis-ingaging of us, that we tender to you; there are diverse others, which the
Committee has taken into consideration, which they see as much or more
certainty in, than in any of these that has been propounded; If it were no
more than the Public Faith of both Kingdoms, as long as the Kingdoms subsist,
or the Cause thrives in the hands of one or other, this must be dis-ingaged,
so that at best it is but a Loan, and must be paid if the Cause survive,
truly, if it do not survive, it being our Religion, I know not what reason
we have (...) desire to survive it, and if we lose it, I am sure we lose all.

Truly Gentlemen, thus, I have but one word more to say; The Cause it is Gods,
if it be not so, let us repent that ever we meddled with it; It is the Cause
of our Country, if it be not so, let us now say, we repent, and leave it; It
is the Cause of these three Kingdoms, England, Ireland, and Scotland, it is
the Cause of Christendom, for if this Cause be carried against us, certainly
the Protestant Cause throughout all Europe, will fare the worse for it: this is
the Cause, and this we all know to be the Cause. It has pleased Almighty God
out of his Providence to call even us poor creatures, to be the managers of
this great cause of his, we have undertaken it, we have formerly by our
Protestations engaged our selves to the maintaining of it, we have all of us,
both Parliament, City, and all well-affected Subjects, of this Kingdom, we
have put our shoulders to it, we have of late manifested to God and all the
world, that we do not repent of what we have done, we have entered into a
Solemn League and Covenant; I think the solemnest that ever was seen in this
Kingdom, Gentlemen thus, let our cheerfulness in this service show, that we
have taken that Covenant, and do affect this business, with our whole hearts;
I have done, Pray God give his blessing.

Mr. Edmond Calamy his speech in Guild Hall on Friday the sixth of October, 1643.
Gentlemen,
YOU have heard a worthy Gentleman of the House of Commons, it is desired by
this grave and Reverend Assembly of Ministers, that three of the Ministers of
this Assembly, should likewise speak unto you concerning this great business,
and notwithstanding my indisposition of body, being required by them, though
that Gentleman of the House of Commons has spoken so abundantly to the
purpose, yet notwithstanding I am here come to speak something, the rather to
declare my willingness to appear in this Cause, that is every way so just, and
every way so honest, and so good, that I may truly say, as the Martyr did, that
if I had as many lives, as I have hairs on my head, I would be willing to
sacrifice all these lives in this Cause; You know the story of Craesus, that
though he never spoke in his life, yet when he saw his Father ready to be
killed, it untyed the strings of his tongue, and then he cried out, that they
would not kill his Father; you are not ignorant that England and Ireland lie a
dying, and though I never appeared in this place, yet I bless God that has
given me that health, this day, to speak something in this Cause, for the
reviving of the dying condition of England, and Ireland; It is such a Cause as
is able to make a very Infant eloquent, and a dumb man to speak that never
spoke in all his life; The matter I am desired to speak to, is, concerning the
Contribution, to persuade you to be liberal toward the bringing in of the
Scots, to help us in this our great necessity; The truth is, it is a great
shame that England should stand in need of another Nation, to help it to
preserve its Religion and Liberties: That England, that has been enriched with
the Gospel of Peace, and the peace of the Gospel for so many years, that
England, that has been blessed with so many rare Ministers of God, so many
precious, and powerful servants, that have preached the Word of God in season
and out of season; that England, that has professed the Gospel with so much
power and purity; that England should stand in need, of the help of their
Brethren of Scotland, for to preserve that Gospel that they have professed so
many years; I confess to me it seems a very strange Prodigy, and a strange
wonder; but it has pleased Almighty God for the sins of England, for our great
unthankfulness, and for our unthankfulness under these means, and for the
great blood-guiltinesse, and Idolatry, and Superstition of this Nation, it has
pleased God to suffer a great part of the Kingdom, to be blinded, especially
those parts, where the Word of God has not been preached in a powerful
manner; and there are many in the Kingdom, that will not be persuaded, that
there is an intention to bring in Popery, and to bring in Slavery; Many of them
(I say) think that though the Popish Army should prevail, and the plundering
Army should prevail, yet they think all would go well with Religion, and with
their Liberties; I say, it has pleased God to suffer abundance in the Kingdom,
to be blinded with this opinion, out of a just judgment to punish us for our
unthankfulness, and for our ingratitude; and this is the reason that so many
men stand Neuters, and that so many are Malignants, and disaffected to this
great Cause, in so much that I am concluded under this, that there is little
probability to finish this Cause, without the coming in of the Scots (as you
heard so worthily by that Member of the House of Commons;) The sons of Zerviah
are grown so strong, what through our fearfulness, what through our
covetousness, what through our malignity, that there is little hope (I say) to
finish this great Cause, or to bring it to a desired peace, without the help of
another Nation, and by the assistance of God, by the help of another Nation it
may be done; These are two mighty, two omnipotent Arguments, to prevail with
you to contribute your utmost aid and assistance to that Cause; since it
cannot speedily be done without their help, and by Gods blessing, it may
speedily be don by their help.

What would the Kings party do, if they could engage another Nation to their
help? 21000. if they could engage them to our ruin; what would they not do?
How much more should we be willing to contribute our greatest help to engage a
Nation, that indeed is part of our own Nation, within the same Island, and our
Brethren, so faithful, and so well affected to this Cause, what should we not
be willing to do to engage so great a party? I would entreat you to remember,
that it is not many years ago, since our Brethren of Scotland came hither into
England, in a warlike manner, and yet with peaceable affections, and that you
would reminde your selves, what good they did to you, when they were then in
England, they were the chief Causes of this Parliament, that now we do
enjoy, and of all the good that has been reaped by this Parliament; (as you
may well remember) By their coming in you know this Parliament was procured,
and their second coming in (through Gods mercy) may be a means to confirm
this Parliament, and to establish it, and to uphold it in its dignity, and in
the privileges of it, and to keep it from being ruined; and if the Parliament
be ruined, you all well know that our Religion, and our Liberties are ruined,
for the Parliament is the great Conservatour of Religion and Liberties; and I
may truly say, as you know Caligula did once wish, that all Rome were one neck
that he might cut it off at one blow; They that intend to ruin the
Parliament, they ruin your Religion and Liberties, and all England at one
blow; Now (I say) as their first coming was a means to produce this
Parliament, so their second coming in (through Gods blessing) may be a means
to establish it, and to confirm it* And when they were here, you know how
faithfully they carried themselves, and when they had done their work, how
willingly they went away without doing any hurt, and I doubt not of the same
faithfulness, nay, you ought all to believe, that they will likewise, when
they have done the work they are called too in England, they will likewise
with the same faithfulness depart, for it is Religion that brings them here,
and the same Religion will make them willingly leave us, and go home to their
own Country, when they have done that work for which they came. I am assured
that the great hope at Oxford is, that they will never prevail for the petting
of Money for to bring them in; and if they once see the matter of Money
effected, and if they once hear of the Scots coming in, it will work such a
terror there, as I am assured, that it will (through Gods mercy) produce a
notable compliance of that Party with the Parliament for an effectual peace,
such as all the godly of the Land shall bless God for.

I foresee there are many Objections that may be brought to hinder this work,
many mountains of opposition that will lie in the way: And likewise that the
Malignants will bu^ many things in your ears, if it be possible to put some
great rub in the way, to hinder the effecting of this work, but I hope, the
love you have to God, and to your Religion, and to the Gospel, and to yours
wives and children, will swallow down all these objections, and conquer them
all; I Will name some few objections, and give you some short answer.

Some it may be, will put you in mind, to call in question the lawfulness of
contributing toward the bringing in of the Scots to this Nation; But for this,
I Will give you an easy answer, Certainly Gentlemen, it is as lawful for the
Parliament to call in our brethren of Scotland to their help, as it is lawful
for me, when my house is on fire, and not able to quench it my self, to call
in my neighbor to quench my house, that is ready to burn down; The Kingdom is
all on fire, we are not able with that speed to quench it, as we wish, we
call in our brethren in Scotland to help us to quench the flames that are
kindled among us; It is as lawful as it is for the Master and Mariners of a
Ship, when it is ready to sink through a mighty Tempest, to call in other
Mariners to help to keep the Ship from sinking; It is the condition of our
Kingdom now, it is ready to sink, and it is our desire that our brethren of
Scotland would come in to our aid, to keep it from sinking.

Others it may be will object and say to you, it is rebellion, especially to
call in another Nation to your help. But I beseech you give me leave to put
you in mind, that when the Scots came last into England, there was a
Proclamation out against them, wherein they were called Rebels, and there were
prayers to be said in our Churches (as you well remember) in which we were to
pray against them as Rebels, and there was Money likewise contributed then,
for to hinder their coming in, and to raise an Army to drive them out of the
Kingdom, and I doubt not but you may remember, all the ill-affected did
contribute Money to keep them out of this Kingdom, and from tarrying in; but it
pleased Almighty God through his great mercy, so to change and alter the state
of things, that within a little while, the Nation of Scotland, even by Act of
Parliament, they were proclaimed and made the true and loyal Subjects of the
King, and in those Churches in which they were prayed against as Rebels, even
in those very Churches, they were pronounced the good Subjects of the King;
this I doubt not but you remember, and I doubt not, but through the mercy of
God, the Lord raising up our hearts, I doubt not but the same effect, will come
of their second coming into this Kingdom; and they that now tell you they are
Rebels, and you do an act of Rebellion, in the contribution to the bringing of
them in. I doubt not but you shall see an Act of Parliament to call them his
Loyal Subjects, (wherein I hope our King will concur with his Parliament)
and likewise Prayers made; nay, a day of thanksgiving, as was after their first
coming, a day of Thanksgiving for the mercy of God, in stirring up their
hearts to be willing to come unto our help.

But it may be some others will object and say, why should we that are
Ministers, engage our selves so much in this business? to see a Reverend
Assembly of grave Ministers to appear here in so great an Assembly. This it
may be, will be a mighty objection to some, but I beseech you give me leave to
give you a short answer did I not think that that that shall be said this day,
would mightily conduce to peace, for my part, I would not have been the month
of the Assembly; did I think any other way to produce a solid and a settled
peace, a Religious peace. I that am a Minister of peace, an Ambassador of
peace; I would not have been a Trumpeter to this business this day: the truth
is, if you would have peace with Popery, a Peace with slavery; if you would
have a Judas peace, or a Joab his peace, you know the Story, he kissed Amasa,
and then killed him; if you would have a peace that may bring a massacre with
it, a French peace, if you would have such a peace, it may be had easily; but
if you would have a peace that may continue the Gospel among you, and may bring
in a Reformation, such as all the godly in the Kingdom do desire, I am
concluded under this, and am confident that such a peace cannot be had without
contribution toward the bringing in of the Scots, and that is the reason for
the promoting of this peace, this blessed peace, that we have appeared here
this day: and me thinks (Gentlemen) the very sight of these worthy Divines, me
thinks so many Divines, so many Orators, so many silent Orators to plead with
you, to be willing to engage your selves to the utmost to help forward the
Nation of Scotland to come to our help. And likewise I would put you in mind of
the 10* of Numbers, there you shall read that there were two silver Trumpets;
and as there were Priests appointed for the convocation of their Assemblies, so
there were Priests to sound the silver Trumpets to proclaim the War. And
likewise in the 20. of Deuteronomy, you shall find there, that when the
children of Israel would go out to War, the sons of Levi, one of the
Priests, was to make a speech to encourage them. And certainly, if this were
the way of God in the Old Testament, certainly much more in such a Cause as
this, in which Cause Religion is so intwin'd, and indeed so interlac'd, that
Religion and this Cause, they are like Hippocrates his twins, they must live
and die together. And (Gentlemen) if Religion were not concerned in this Cause,
and mightily concerned; and if Religion did not live and die with it, we had
not appeared this day; And I hope this will be a sufficient answer unto this
Objection.

But there is another Objection which I will answer, and then briefly give
leave to my other Reverend Brethren, that likewise are prepared to speak here.
The great Objection of all is this, that the City is already exhausted, and so
much Money has been lent already, that there is no hope of lending any more;
this is the grand Objection, But truly (Gentlemen) for my part, this is one of
the chief Arguments I have to persuade you to lend a little more, because you
have lent so much: give me leave to put you in mind of that Story, in the 2
Kings 13. the Story of King Joash, that came to visit the Prophet Elisha, when
he was ready to breath out his last, the Prophet Elisha gives him a bow and
arrows, and bids him shoot, he shootes, and bids him smite, he smites the
ground thrice, and then he ceased, the Prophet was exceeding angry with him,
and tells him, you should have smote the ground 5 or 6 times, and then you
should have utterly consumed the Assyrians, whereas now you shall smite them
but three times. Give me leave to apply this, Gentlemen, you have smote the
ground thrice, you have lent once, twice, and thrice, indeed you have been the
fame of England, and the Repairers of England, and the Ornaments of England,
you have lent much, but let me tell you, you must smite the ground 5 or 6
times, if ever you look to consume the Assyrians, if ever you look to bring
this War to a happy Peace, that your posterities may rejoice in this Peace,
you must shoot one arrow more, and then through Gods blessing, you may utterly
consume these Enemies, that you and your posterity may rejoice in a happy
peace; It is a famous story of Johannes Eleemozinarius, that when he had given
even almost all he had to the poor, his friends were exceeding angry with
him, and told him he had undone himself, what was his answer? O (says he) I
have not yet shed my blood for Jesus Christ; Jesus Christ he emptied himself
of his Divinity, to make us rich, he became poor, and shed his blood for you;
You have not yet made your selves so poor as Jesus Christ was, that had no
house to lodge in, and he did all this for your sakes; You have not yet shed
your blood for the Cause of Christ; We read that Moses was willing to be
blotted out of the book of life, for the Cause of God; and we read of Paul,
that he was willing to be accursed, for the people of Isreal's sake; And will
you not be willing to venture your earthly provisions for so good a Cause as
this is, which (I say) England was never engaged in the like.

Religion has produced all the wealth you have, all your wealth is but the
child of Religion, we have a saying, Religio peperit divitias, and divitiae
devoravunt matrem; Religion has begot wealth, and the Daughter has devoured
the Mother; and ^^lia devoravit matrem; but give me leave, and I hope (through
Gods blessing) you will invert this saying, Religion has got you all the
wealth you have, you Gentlemen, and I hope the Daughter now will preserve the
Mother; I hope Riches will preserve Religion, and not destroy Religion. A
famous example of Polan^^ Noli^^^, that when he had given all that he had
away, and being asked, why he would give so much to the poor, he gave this
answer, V^ levi^^ ascenderem s^alam Ja^c^i, that I might the easier get up
Jacobs ladder; And let me assure you, in the word of a Minister, the
contributing to this Cause for Gods sake, and for the glory of God, and for the
peace of the Gospel, (I say) will be a means to make you the sooner ascend up
Jacobs Ladder; not for the giving of the money, but for the evidence of your
Faith, through the merits of the Lord Jesus Christ, by your giving of the
money; And certainly that man will never get up Jacobs Ladder, that has the
^ust of his money to ^^ar witness against him, at the day of Judgment,
especially at such a time as this. Give me leave to put you in mind of one
other story, and that is of one Bernardinu^ (...) that was so liberal to the
poor, that every penny that he gave to the poor, he would call it a holy
penny, and a happy penny* and he would bless God* that he had that penny to
(...) indeed he was a Papist, and his ordinary speech was, O happy penny, that
has purchased immortality to me; indeed this speech was not good, for it is
not our money that does purchase heaven, that is an evidence of the truth of
our Faith, that lays hold upon Christ for salvation; But let me tell you, if
ever (Gentlemen) you might use this speech, O happy penny; you may use it now,
Happy money that will purchase my Gospel, happy money that will purchase
Religion, and purchase a Reformation, to my posterity, O happy money, and
blessed be God that I have it to lend. And I count it the greatest opportunity
that ever God did offer to the godly of this Kingdom, to give them some money
to lend to this Cause; And I remember in this Ordinance of Parliament, you call
it Advance money; It is called an Ordinance to advance money toward the
maintaining of the Parliaments forces* and truly it is the highest advance of
money, to make money an instrument to advance my Religion; the Lord give you
hearts to believe this.

You shall have the Faiths of both Kingdoms engaged in this Cause, the Kingdom
of Scotland, and the Kingdom of England, and surely the Public Faith of
Scotland will secure the Public Faith of England; I speak now of secondary
causes* through Gods blessing. I am informed by the Commissioners of Scotland,
that the Nation of Scotland are now taking the Covenant, (that we took the
last Lord day in this City*) And you know that a Scotch Covenanter is a
terrible thing; you know what mighty things they did, by their last Covenant;
you know that the name of a Covenanter, the very name of it, did do wonders;
And I am assured by them, that there is not one person in the Kingdom of
Scotland, that is not a Covenanter, and there shall not one abide among them,
that will not take this Covenant, and there shall not one of those 21000 that
are to come over in this Cause, not one of them shall come, that will not take
this Covenant, but they must take this Covenant before they come; O that the
consideration of these things, might work up your hearts to a high degree of
Charity, to a superlative degree, and that the Lord would make you more active
and more liberal in this great Cause; For my part, I speak it in the name of
my self, and in the name of these (...) Ministers, we will not only speak to
persuade you to contribute, but every one of us, that God has given any estate
to, we will all to our utmost power, we will not only say it^, but v^^ite,
we will not only speak to you to lend, but every one of us, as we have
already lent, so we will lend to our utmost power, and bless God that we
have it to lend; for indeed it is now a time of action, and not of speaking
only, because it is an extraordinary business, therefore here is an
extraordinary appearance of so many Ministers, to encourage you in this Cause,
that you may see how real the godly Ministry in England, is unto this Cause.

The Gospel it is called a Pearl of price, by our Savior Christ, and I hope
all you Merchants, will part with your goodly pearls to buy this pearl of
price; You Tradesmen, the Gospel is called a Treasure hid in the field, so our
Savior Christ calls it, I hope you will be willing to part with your earthly
treasures, to preserve this blessed treasure, that is hid in the field; you
have parted with some goodly pearls already, I hope you will part with your
other goodly pearls: There is an excellent Story of one Nonlu^ a Roman Senator,
that had a pearl that he did prize above his life, and when Anthony the
Triumvir, one that was then in great power, when he sent to N^nius to have the
pearl, he would not send it him, and he told him, that if he would banish
him, he would be willingly banished, so he might save his pearl, if he
would take away his life, he would dye with his pearl; he did not regard his
Country, so he might have his pearl* he regarded nothing, so he might have
his pearl; but he would not part with his pearl, what ever he parted withal;
This pearl it is the Gospel of Jesus Christ, that you have professed in this
City, and I hope you have professed it with power; and certainly, you have the
name of those that have professed the Gospel in the greatest purity of any
under heaven; This pearl is this Gospel, I hope you will part with all
willingly and cheerfully, rather than part with the Gospel, though you go to
prison, carry the Gospel with you, nay, though you lose your lives, ^t shall
be with the Gospel, and for the Gospel; I hope so.

There is one Argument more, and then I have done, and that is from the
inveterate hatred they have at Oxford, against the City of London, and against
you for your good, because you have been so well-affected to this Cause.
Gentlemen, I beseech you give me leave (that am no Statesman, not acquainted
with the affairs of policy, yet give me leave) to put you in mind of this,
that surely the plundering Army at Oxford conceive that they shall find a
great treasure here in the City, though many pretend they have no money; Though
certainly you have done well, and lent much, yet the plundering Army give out,
that if they get possession of the City, they shall find a treasury to be
able to pay all they have been at: And if ever you should be driven (which God
forbid) to make your peace, it would cost you twenty times as much then to
procure your peace, and such a peace it may be, that would be rather a War
than a Peace, and a death better than that peace, which now you may have for a
very little, a most happy Peace.

There is a famous story of Zelimus Emperor of Constantinople, that after he
had taken Egypt, he found a great deal of treasure there, and the Soldiers
came to him, and asked him, what shall we do with the Citizens of Egypt, for
we have found a great treasure among them, and we have taken their Riches? O*
(says he) hang them all up, for they are too rich to be made slaves; and
this was all the thanks they had for the riches they were spoiled of; And it
may be^, though some of you that stand neute^^, or some of you that are
disaffected to the Cause of the Parliament, may think that if the Lord for our
sins, should give up this City unto the Army that is with the King, you may
think that you shall escape, yet be assured that youngoods will be
Roundheads, though you be not, your goods will be Gybalins, though you be
Gwel^s, as (...) is; Certainly, there will be no distinction, in the
plundering of your goods, between you and others; and therefore let me beseech
you, that as the Lord has made you instruments to do a great deal of good
already, for indeed you are the preservers of our Religion, and you are the
preservers of our Parliament, by your liberality, and by your former
contributions, and by your assistance, and the Lord has made you mighty
instruments of our good, let me beseech you, that you would persevere, and now
we are come to the Sheat Anchor, we are now come to the last cast, I beseech
you, you would persevere, and hold out; and O that my words might add somewhat
to help forward this contribution! It has pleased God to make me a settled
Ministry in this City, and I have now been here almost five years in this
City, and though I had never done any good in my place, I should now think it a
great fr^ite of my coming to this City, if after five years unprofitablenesse,
I might speak somewhat this afternoon, that might enlarge your hearts to a
greater measure of liberality; All I will say is this: We Divines say, that
Perseverance is the only grace that Crowns a Christian; Methushelah lived 999
years, if he had fallen away from Grace, at the 999 years end, all the good
that he had done before, had been quite forgotten; I know that God will so
uphold his children, that they shall never fall away, but I bring it as a
supposition, that suppose that Methushelah had forsaken his righteousness, all
he had done before, had been quite forgotten; but God has made a promise,
never to forsake his Children, and that grace he has begun in them, he will
finish, and I doubt not but that God, that has put it into your hearts to be^
so liberal already, and to do so much in this Cause, and to be so cordial,
and so real, and to exceed all other parts of the Kingdom, I hope that same
God now will finish that good work he has begun, and will crown all his
graces in you, with the Grace of Perseverance; and that God that has been the
Author of all the good you have done, I doubt not; but that God will be the
Finisher; And I beseech God to give a blessing to that has been spoken.

Mr. Jeremiah Burroughes his speech in Guild Hall on Friday the sixth of
October, 1643.
Gentlemen,
PRovidence has cast this Assembly, met for such a weighty occasion (as indeed
it is the weightiest, that has concerned England in our age) to be late, and
so perhaps wearisome to many of you, but you may well be content to stay a
while, although you should be deprived of a great part of your sleep this
night, if this Evenings business may have the hoped success of it, it may
make you sleep quietly and securely many nights after. Things of present and
absolute necessity, call for action, not deliberation; this work that you have
been called unto, is such, as you must leave objecting against it, and rather
fall a blessing God, that you may be used in it; In the 1 of Chronicles 22.
14. When David and the people had come and offered of their estates freely, and
bountifully; David he humbles himself then, Who am I? and who are we? It were
happy if you come all with such an humble frame of spirit, to admire that God
preserves your lives, and calls you at this time to such a work, so concerning
his glory, and the good of three Kingdoms, yea of the Christian world; If ever
you that have estates had cause to rejoice in them, then now when God presents
such a large opportunity for his service as he loath; and wherein consills man's
happiness, but in being serviceable in his generation? In these days to be
acted by that poor, ^ow principle, Qui been lotuit, been vixit; that is, let
us keep our selves safe, and quiet, keep our estates, take heed of appearing
too far, we know not which side may prevail; this is an argument of a vile
and a sordid spirit; let such a man's name be written in the earth; Unworthy is
such a man to live in such a Generation as this, in which God is doing such
great things, as might enliven the deadest heart, quicken the dullest spirit,
raise the heaviest, and enlarge the straitest spirit living upon the earth; In
former times indeed there was less charge called for, there was less trouble,
but there was less service too, and what do you think to be the measure of a
man's happiness, either little trouble, or much service? A gracious heart
thinks it as great a mercy to lay out for God, as to receive from God; God in
these our days is risen on high in his administrations, and our hearts should
rise together with him; Psalm 105. 4, 5. Thy mercy O Lord is above the heavens,
and thy truth reaches unto the clouds* what follows? be thou then exalted, O
Lord, above the Heavens, and let thy glory be above all the earth; This day
Gods name, Gods great works they are above the heavens, they are very high, we
behold them, let our hearts rise in a suitable way, as God rises in his
workings, and all say, and do as we say, that God may be exalted now above
the heavens indeed.

God can do his work without you, and do it certainly he will, howsoever,
but seeing he is now laying a foundation of the most glorious building, that
it is like ever has been in this world, if he shall be pleased to call you
to be helpful in it, it will be Gods mercy, and your glory; Were it that
this one principle were raised in the hearts of people, that to do public
service, it is not only a duty, but a dignity, how ready, how abundant then
would men be in the Work of the Lord? There has lately been the most blessed
union of two Nations, as ever was in the world, lifting up their hands to the
high God, swearing that they will amend their ways, and seek to reform
themselves according unto the Word, let us now reach forth our hands and
hearts, unto our brethren in Scotland, let us come up fully unto this our
engagement, and rejoice in it, for certainly that Nation is a Nation that God
does love, a Nation that God does honor, and by those many expressions of his
love, showed that he does intend to make them special instruments of the
great things he has to do in this latter age of the world; It is a Nation
that is united the most firmly of any people under heaven, We may truly call
it a Philadelphia, and Brightman (that famous light in former times, 30 or 40
years since) did parallel the Church of Philadelphia with the Church of
Scotland; Philadelphia signifies brotherly love; When was there ever a Nation,
such a Church, that joined together in such firm Covenants as they have done?
had we had the like union amongst us, O what great things had we done long
before this time?

A Nation it is that has engaged it self to God in a higher way, in a more
extraordinary way, than any Nation this day upon the face of the earth has
done; in the most solemn way Covenanting with the eternal God, pouring forth
their prayers, and their tears for joy, together with their Covenanting; A
Nation that has reformed their lives for so small a time more than ever any
people that we know of in the world have done, and a people that have risen up
against Antichrist more in another way, than ever people have done, and that is
the great Work of God in these times, and therefore God certainly has a love
unto them, because they break the ice, and begin the work, and arise in such a
way as they do for the pulling down of that man of sin. A Nation that God has
honored by giving as glorious success unto, as ever he did unto any; whose
low and mean beginnings he has raised to as great a height, as ever low
beginnings in any Country were: How has God dissipated and biasted the
Counsels of their adversaries? how has he discovered all their Treacheries?
although they be in themselves (comparatively at least) a poor people, and of
little strength, (as the Church of Philadelphia was) yet they have kept the
word of Gods patience, and God has kept them in the hour of temptation; God
therefore is with them: (How happy should we be, if we may have them in a
near union with us?) And a people that have carried themselves with as great
honor and faithfulness, with as great wisdom and order in the most difficult
work that ever a people did undertake, in those by and intricate paths that
were before uncrodden. Certainly that they undertook at the beginning of their
wor^e, but a few years since, it could not but be looked upon with the eye of
reason, as the most unlikely work ever to have proceeded, as any work^ has
ever done, and yet how has the Lord been with them, and with what wisdom and
graciousnesse have they carried it? Was there ever such an example since the
world began, of a people coming out of a poorer Country, into a fat and
richer Country, and having those opportunities that they had to enrich
themselves to go away so as they did? (their greatest enemies they now admire
at them.) A people they are that began to rise for their Liberties, when the
generality of this people here, were ready basely to bow down their backs, and
put their necks under the yoke: and had it not been that they had been willing
to have endured the brunt, we had all been slaves (it is like) at this day. A
people that are exceeding sensible of our condition, witness that when our
Letters from the Reverend Assembly came unto them, they received them with
tears, and much meltings of spirit, in their General Kirk Assembly; witness
their readiness and willingness to come now, though in winter season, in
times that we dare not venture our selves abroad; witness the temptations
that they have had unto the contrary, and yet carried through all.

They now desire 100000 l. what is this to 300000 l. in pay? what is this to
five Counties? what is this to the plunder of a whole City? what reasonable
terms do they proffer to come among you? do but give them 100000 l. advance,
and they engage themselves for three months and ten days, and in the winter
time to be in the Kingdom, not to have a foot of Land granted unto them, or
assured them, but willing to depart again without any more, when they have
done their work; this certainly cannot but satisfy any spirit that is never
so malignant, at least it may stop his mouth. A Nation it is that we are
engaged unto likewise, that that now is desired of you, is no more indeed then
is their due, it is due already to them, but they desire it not in that way.
Wherefore shall such an opportunity as this is be lost for want of Money? God
forbid; shall a people to whom God has given such testimony of his acceptance,
be rejected by us, when they would come in and help us? Their Liberties are
settled, why they, though on the other side of Jordan, they are not therein
satisfied, to sit still, but are willing to come themselves, and come into the
brunt, and hazard themselves, for the settling of their brethren in the
inheritance of the Lord likewise.

And it is not only the number of those that shall come in ^1000 that is our
advantage, but the great business is, the engagement of a kingdom, the
encouragement of such a Kingdom, that God has given such testimony to, that
that Kingdom shall be by this everlastingly engaged in what is dear unto us,
in our peace and our security, that is the advantage of all. And as the Lord
has a delight in this place, in this Nation, he has no less surely in this
renowned City; this City whom indeed our adversaries have found out nicknames
for, and call it the rebellious City, (as formerly Rehum the Chancellor, and
Shimsbai the Scribe, Ezra 4. called the City of Jerusalem) but God has other
names for you, it is the City of the Lord of Hosts, it is the faithful City,
and God has much mercy certainly for this place. There is no City in the
world, that has such a cloud of incense of prayers go daily up to heaven (I
verily believe) as does from this City. Yea, put all the Cities of the earth
together, I scarce think that God is so much honored in family duties in them
all together, as he is in this place. A City that has had the powerful
preaching of the Gospel, beyond all Cities upon the face of the earth; and the
Ministers of it receiving more encouragement here, then they have done in any
other parts of the world. A City that has more of the power and life of
godliness, then any place yet upon the face of the earth; surely God intends
good to this City, and does likewise delight in it, and he has great things
for this City to do, and great mercy to bestow upon them.

You have been the bulwark of that honorable Assembly in both Houses of
Parliament, you have been their safety, you have been their assistance, their
lives have been preserved by you, and God will remember it another day, and he
has mercy in store for that labor of your love, and that hazard that you
endured in that thing: You have been the refuge of the banished Ministers, and
Saints of, God in most parts of this Kingdom, and in Ireland, and the blessing
of those that are ready to perish, it is much upon this City night and day.
Never did the Lord stir up so many young ones, as he has done in this city at
this time, that promises great mercy, that speaks aloud to us, that God
intends to do great things by them. Never was there so many godly ones, or
more, (to speak with modesty) together in place of power in this City, then
there is at this day. You have the blessing of all the prayers of all the
servants of God throughout this Kingdom, Parents shall teach their children to
bless God for London, as long as they live, yea for many generations, when
they have any fruit by the Gospel, they shall teach their children to
acknowledge it to the glory of God; children thank God for London, thank God
that ever you heard of Christ, had it not been for the forwardness, the zeal,
the activenesse of the Spirits of those in London, you had never come to enjoy
these Liberties of the Gospel, as now you do. And now shall this City withdraw
themselves from such a noble and great work of God, as they are called unto at
this time, and let it fall because of them? for it is in your power, either to
raise it, or to let it fall, (that is the English of it) it is in your power
now, either to save us, or to undo us, and shall this be let fall now out of
love of Money? shall I say, Let the Money of those men perish with them? No, I
came not hither to threaten, but to persuade; consider that the mercies that
you have from Christ, cost Christ more then money* they cost Christ his dear
heart blood: Who is it that raised your estates more then others? have not many
of you come hither low, as Jacob, with your staff to this City, and now behold
these bands, this estate? who knows but that you are raised for such a time as
this? Have not you engaged your selves many times in prayer to God, when first
you entered into Covenant to God, did not you give up all your estate then to
God, to be employed in his Service, God calls for his due at this time from
you? Oftentimes upon your sick beds, and death beds (in your apprehension of
death, that they would have been death beds) you have then given up all again
to God, and vowed that if God did raise you up, you would live to his service,
you would employ your strength in his Service. God calls for all those vows,
you have now an opportunity to fulfill all those vows: And seeing providence
has cast it so, that a Reverend Assembly of Divines, has appointed us to
speak thus unto you, give us leave to speak in the name of God unto you, and
to call upon you in the name of God; for the fulfilling of all the vows that
you have made upon your sick beds, to give up your selves and your estates for
the service of the Lord: And know that if you shall keep your estates otherwise
then God would have you, it will be to you as the Manna was to the Israelites,
they kept it longer than they should, and there was worms in it; (...) that
was preserved no longer than Gods time, was sweet, but that that was kept
afterward, it had worms breeding in it; Your estates you have now, you must
not think will always be so sweet as they have been unto you, if you preserve
them longer than God would have you, there will worms breed in them, yea the
curse of God will be in them.

Have not you s^nt up many prayers to God, for this great Cause, that God would
bless it? (I appeal to you) then you have engaged your selves to Heaven by all
your prayers; therefore I beseech and entreat you now, by all the prayers you
have made, (as before by your vows, by all the prayers you have made) upon
your Fasting days, that God would preserve his Cause, that you would now do
as much as in you lies, to maintain his Cause, otherwise how do you trifle
with the great God, and mock him in your prayers, that you seek to him to
maintain it, and when there is an opportunity in your hands, you will not do
wh^t lies in you. It may be you will say, w^e have done much already; We
acknowledge it, and blessed be God for it, but know the Cause is a great
Cause, and it is a great God that you do for; Philo Judaeus tells us, it was
enough among some heathenish people, but to say to them, Libertas agitur, the
business is your Liberty, that is afoot, enough to venture their estates and
lives; It is not Liberty alone, but Religion (as you have heard:) But because
some may perhaps cast such a scruple into your minds, a^ we have heard of it;
That what warrant have we to take up Arms to maintain Religion? that is not
at present to be discussed, but only this, to satisfy and stop all their
mouths with one word:

Thus far none can deny it, but it is lawful to take up arms, to maintain
that civil right we have to our Religion, and this we do; For we have not
only a right to our Religion, by the Law of God, but we have a Civil right
to this our Religion, that other Christians have not had, and therefore there
can be no scruple in this, to retard you in such a work as this, you have done
much, but a gracious heart will ever think what he has done for God, it is
but poor and low; That example is famous of David, that had done so much for
preparing the Temple of God, in the 1 of Chronicles 22. 14. It was 1000000
talents of silver, and 1000 talents of gold; which some compute a matter of 33
Cart loads of silver, allowing 20000 li. to every Cart load, and 70 millions of
French Crowns of gold, this David had done preparing but for the house of the
Lord, and yet he says that out of his poverty he had done all this; all this
was but a poor and low thing for him to do in comparison of the great God;
why, have you done more then this? therefore seeing it is for the high God, you
have done it, look upon what you have done, but as low, and still go on in the
work of the Lord; You have done much, and so have the adversaries too; We
would have you to weigh this, that the adversary has been at as much charge,
as you have been, as bountiful and free as you have been; in the 46 of Isaiah
6. We read that the Idolaters did lavish out their gold upon their Idols, yea,
they lavished their gold out of their bags: Certainly, our adversary has
felt the burden of this, and has been at the charge of it, as much as you;
You have done much, but yet you have not gone in a good work so far as a
Herod has done; Josephus in his 15 Book of Antiquities, and about the 12
Chapter, tells us of Herod the King, that in the time of scarcity, he sold
away all his movables, all the plate that was served to his table, and fetched
corn from Egypt, and bought it for the poor, and clothed them, yea, and gave
seed corn to the Assyrians his neighbors; Why now, in this our Kingdom, we
may see much Plate still at many Noble men's tables; yea, at many Gentlemen's
tables, a great deal of Plate reserved, they have not sold all their movables,
and Plate to give away; it is but a proportion of their estates, and but to
lend upon so good security.

And take this one consideration further, your having done much, is a mighty
preparation, to make your doing now to be formidable to your adversaries; for
what is the hope of your adversary? but that you are drawn dry; They triumph in
this, and they tell the world, that there must be such petty ways, to seek to
the City, to get petty sums of money, and all is even gone, and therefore we
shall have them to be a prey ere long; but when they shall see, that after so
much has been expended here, that you have such free spirits, and to come out
still abundantly with further treasure, this will more daunt their hearts; this
100000 li. will daunt their hearts more than 2000000 li. before has done; If
you say, why do we do all? What if God will give the City, the special
honor, yet the Country will be required for a great part besides; but the
Lords work now to be done, it must be done especially by his servants; and
we know in Ezra, when as the adversaries of Judah would have come and helped
in the work, they would not suffer them to come and help in the work; I say
not, we should do so; but only to satisfy ^s in this, that we should not
think it much, that God should especially honor us in such a work as this is;
But yet besides know, that your interest in this business, it is more than the
interest of other men; for other men care not what becomes of Religion, what
care they for Reformation? they are willing to be slaves to some, that they
might have others slaves under them; But you desire Reformation, you therefore
shall have the greatest share in the blessing of the issue of this work; and
therefore if others do not so much, yet you should be willing to be forward
in the work you are now called to; and if you be willing, it is like in a
little while, you may get such power, that you may bring others to do
whatsoever may appear to be just; If it shall be said, I, but a great deal is
done, but to little purpose all this while; O (my brethren) say not so, it is
an unthankful voice, this, for much has been done, there has been a check
given to the adversary, the stream of tyranny and slavery, it has been
stopped, your lives have all this while been preserved by what has been done;
If you think, but it is too late, and all will be lost that we do; Say not
so neither, this is below a Roman spirit, the Romans when Hannibal was at their
gates, yet would sell their fields at as great a rate, and as great a
consideration, as at any other time* Even the field where the Enemy was, found
buyers, when it was put to sale, there were enough to buy that field; Your
spirits would scarce rise so high to give a valuable consideration, for the
field of your Enemy, to be Fee simple to your selves; he not discouraged, you
have not only the Faith of both Kingdoms, (that has been offered) but we as
Divines may offer you this day the Faith of Heaven, the Faith of the promises
of Heaven, they are offered to you, and there is nothing will blast that work
more than a discouraged heart; You know that the very thing that caused God to
deprive the children of Israel of Canaan, when they were at the borders, it
was, because they were discouraged, and said, There are children of Anak here,
and let us not go; The Lord is bringing of us to a blessed (...) it is true,
we are in a wilderness, but we know God has brought us into the
wilderness, and he will speak comfortably to us in it; and let us not be
afraid of difficulties, lest we be deprived of that good Land that God is
bringing us into; and little cause have we to be discouraged, for those we
have to deal with, their spirits are base and vile; why should we fear those
uncircumcised Philistines?

And we see God has been with us, in every thing that we have undertaken;
We have never shown our selves like men, but God has shown himself to be like
a God for us. If you say, Well, but were it not better we bent all our forces
to some Accommodation? To that we answer you thus: You have to deal not only
with his Majesty, but with a Popish party that are about him, and what security
you can ever have of your peace, (as was worthily said before) except the
Scottish Nation comes in for to fasten it, it is easy for any one to judge. I
will tell you but one story about that, and because it is suitable unto you, I
will therefore relate it here: It is a Story that I find in the Chronicles,
that in the days of King Edward the fixed, King Edward sends to this City for
assistance against the Lords, and the Lords send to the City for their
assistance likewise, against the Protector, the Earl of Somerset; and the
Common Council was called, (I suppose in this place,) and there stands up, as
the story says, a wise discreet Citizen, in the Common Council* and makes
this speech unto them; First, he acknowledges that the cause was right for the
Lords, for the Kingdom, though it were against the will of the King, because
the King would not then put in execution those Laws that should be, but
hindered them, but yet (says he) let me reminde you of that that I have read
in Fabians Chronicle, (it was one George Stadley that stood up, let me reminde
you of that) when there was a fight between the Lords and the King, the Lords
send for assistance to the City, the City granted their assistance, the Lords
prevailed, the King was taken, and his Son a Prisoner; afterward they were
both released upon Composition, and amongst other things, this was one, that
howsoever the City should be preserved, that the City should suffer nothing
for what they had done; and this Composition was confirmed by Act of
Parliament, but (says this Citizen) what came of it? did the King forgive? No*
nor forget, for afterward all our Liberties were taken away, strangers were
set over us, for our Heads and Governors; the bodies and the estates of the
Citizens were given away, and one misery followed after another; and so we
were most miserably persecuted; and here was their Accommodation.

Wherefore then (to close all) you have heard before, that we come not only
to persuade you, but to engage our selves as well as to persuade you, and to
do that, that we would have you do: For our parts, as we have in some
proportionable manner done it already, so we are ready to do it further, and
it beseemes us well to do it; We read in the 3 of Nebemiah, that the first
that did help to repair the City, it was the Priests of the City, and about the
middle of the City, the Priests of the Plain; I suppose it is meant, the City
Ministers, and the Country Ministers, and you shall find in that Chapter,
several sorts of people were there, there were the Rulers these specially
mentioned; I suppose their chief Rulers, as their Aldermen, etc. they were very
forward in that work of the Lord; Yea, there were the Tradesmen, there you read
much of the Goldsmiths, two several times in that Chapter, you read of the
Goldsmiths, more then others, and you read of the Apothecaries, that they were
ready in their work; yea, and you read of the Daughters of men, how they
forwarded their Parents; I would I had to speak to many young ones this day, I
hope I should prevail much with them, to be great forwarders of you that are
more ancient, that you may do this freely, which you are here exhorted to.

Have not many of you spent your blood in this Cause, yea, how many young ones
in this City have lost their blood? Me thinks a spirit of indignation should
rise in you, to vindicate the loss of the blood of your Servants and Children*
many precious ones, that might have lived many years, to have done good service
for the Lord; Even the children of the City, they rise and cry, Hosanna,
Hosanna, O blessed is ^ee that comes in the name of the Lord! O then let old
Citizens be forward, me thinks Elders should ^ee forward in this Cause* for
^^e thinks they should not think themselves men of this world, In the 17 of
John, Christ speaks of himself, when he was going out of the world, I am not
in the World; and so should you going out of the world, even say, you are not
in the world; and therefore let your close in going out of the world, be a
happy close in such a blessed work as this is. And know there shall come a day,
wherein you shall be calling and crying to God for mercy; the success of this
evenings work will be recorded against that day, when you shall cry for mercy.
I conclude all with applying the words of Jotham to the men of Sechem, in the 9
of Judges 7. Hearken to me, that God may hearken to you: So (I say) hearken to
that worthy Member of the House of Commons, unto that Reverend Divine before,
and to him that shall come after: Hearken unto ^s this day, that God may
hearken unto you.

Mr. Obadiah Sedgewick his speech in Guild Hall on Friday the sixth of October,
1643.
Gentlemen,
I Am commanded by the Assembly of Divines, and they by a command from the
House of Commons, to be present at this solemn and public meeting, and from
them to move for that, which I confidently presume is granted already, a
helping heart, and a helping hand, to preserve (O that we must be forced to say
so, and yet blessed be God that we are alive to say so, to preserve!) our
Religion, our lives, and the lives of ours. It is I confess my happiness,
that I am not to speak unto such who have made our troubles, and that laugh at
them, but unto them that see our distresses, and know how to compassionate
them: the persuasion is the more hopeful, when the compassion is beforehand
afoot: if that honorable Gentleman that spoke first, had bin sent with fire to
destroy your City, or others with Swords from that grave Senate, to have
destroyed your lives, or with armed power to have compelled and plundered your
estates; there I confess a refusal, nay a contempt had been the most proper
answer. But Sirs, their address unto you is paternall, it is humble and full
of efficacy, it is but to request you to preserve your own lives, it is but to
request you that you would not suffer your selves, your wives, your children,
your City, your Religion to be destroyed. I confess that I had prepared diverse
things to have worked on you; but they that have spoken before me, have scarce
left me any new matter to say, but all (which I wish with all my heart were
wrought in you, as well as in my self, nothing lest but) to do.

The Religion that we have all our lives professed, if it be not worth thy
money, trample it under thy feet: Religion (brethren) is an invaluable thing,
it is far above our estates, far above our lives, nay it is far above our
souls. For our estates, the Heathen say so much, That our estates were not to
be insisted on, when Religion was in danger, and therefore some of them have
according to their imaginary Religion, (the strength of it) they have neglected
their goods to preserve their Gods; nay they hare (as Alvinus did) neglect his
own wife and children, to take care of that vain Deity that they sacrificed
unto. It is (I confess to me) a most remarkable thing that Pliny reports,
(and good Gentlemen, let not Heathens exceed Christians, in love either to
their Country or Religion:) You know that Hanniball was a sore enemy to the
Romans, and the Romans, when they to maintain themselves against them had
exhausted all their public treasury* a Consul in the Senate bespake the
people that they would all ^ring out their personal estates, (something like
what is this day moved unto you) it was so instantly, it was so universally
relished, that all ^orts of people brought in abundantly, and (might I give but
a suggest unto the grave Senators, that) the Citizens, and (...) Senator in
Rome, left not himself, (so prodigal was (...) for the ^^fety of the public,
he left not unto himself) for to keep himself and household, above the value
of 16 Crowns. O shall heathens be so prodigal to preserve themselves against a
Hanniball* and shall not Christians be as careful to preserve their Religion
against Antichrist.

Well Sirs, as that which you are desired to expend something of your estates
for is Religion, that is far beyond all your estates, so it is that, that is
far beyond all your lives: For I beseech you what are all your lives for
value unto Religion, what will your lives be to you for comfort, when the
Sun is taken out of the Firmament, and the Gospel is removed out of this
English horizon? if* you should outlive the Gospel, why (the Lord be merciful
to you) what would your lives avail you? were it not better to make Religion
and the Gospel your Executors, then to make Idolaters your Executors? were it
not better to make Religion your Executors, then to make your selves, or your
posterities heirs of Idolatry? When Troy was taken, Anchises disdained to take
his Sons counsel, to save his life: Away! live when Troy is taken? And truly
(Friends) if there be in any of you, (a^ I persuade my self there is in all
of you that hear me this da^) a sense of God, a sense of your souls, a sense
of the Gospel of Christ, why you must acknowledge now, that all your comforts
are lost, that all your hopes on earth are lost, and all your hopes in heaven
are gone, if the Gospel, if that Religion be gone. Nay, (as I said at the
beginning) it is that, that no not your souls can stand in competition with; I
confess the soul of man is a precious thing, it is as the ring of Gold, yet
if I do not mistake my self) Religion is the most precious Diamond in that
ring. The business of Religion, why, it is the salvation of your souls, no less
then your souls, and higher I cannot speak. And if this will not move you, at
this time to lend out your strength, to preserve your lives, your estates, your
Religion, that which preserves your souls to eternity, I can say nothing more.
But then Sirs observe one thing, there is not only this dignity in Religion
that may challenge all that you are and have; but there is likewise an efficacy
in Religion: It is one of the best Masters, and one of the best Fathers, true
Religion is. What you lay out to preserve it, that one day will return to
preserve you. I have ever thought our Religion to be our shield; and as he said
of his shield, so Religion will say to you, Defend me, and I will defend you.
It is our shield, why, preserve your shield, you preserve your self: O that
this large Auditory would but remember two or three things, that I will speak
unto you. It is better (Friends) to keep your Religion with the expense of all
you have, then to keep all you have with the loss of one dram of Religion; and
if you should quit the preservation of Religion, you shall lose in the event,
both Religion and your selves too. There will be a double loss; you may
perhaps for the present be at a double cost to keep up Religion, but you shall
be at a treble loss if you lose Religion; you shall lose your lives, you shall
lose the estates that you keep, and you shall lose your souls too; and if any
thing keeps you, it is Religion. For if any thing keeps God, that keeps all, it
is the keeping of Religion. Now Sirs, a^ this argument (besides all that (...)
for in truth, they have left me almost naked, that I have nothing to say; as
this argument)* may revive those affections that have been stirred up already,
so methinkes, if you look but upon the very condition of the Church this day,
I profess unto you, it will break your hearts; and therefore may certainly
open your purses this day: Why, (friends) if I am able, I may not deny, no, not
one day, nor the second day, nor the third day, nor any time, I must not deny
to help a poor Lazarus; I must not see Lazarus to starve and die at my doors,
if that I am able to help a poor Christian: Why, if my bowels must extend
themselves, i^ (...) help must extend it self to one Christian, how shall I,
how can I see, the Churches of Jesus Christ, for to*gaspe and give up the Ghost
at the feet of blood? There are two sorts of blood which will lie heavy upon
my soul, if that I should suffer the guilt of them to be upon my soul* there
is the blood of Christ, and the blood of the Churches of Christ: If Abel^
blood, the blood of a single person, was so heavy upon ^ain, what will the
blood of (...) Church, of all the Churches of Christ, let down upon our fonts*
if we should now fall to help the Churches of Christ* But if there were no
other (...) with you* but only something that might concerns your selves, I
profess, as I am satisfied in my owns Spirit, so I am p^rswaded it were enough
to persuade you. Why, (Friends) you have done already, (I speak not to flatter
you, you (...) already) more then all the land has done, even to the
preservation of all the Land, nay more then all the Christian world has done
to preserve the Cause of Christ. And let me tell you, that God has not been
behind hand with you, God has looked upon you, as much (I mean this City*
God has looked upon this City, (...) if not more, then upon all the land
besides. And ^ruly, if you will cast east up all accounts betwixt God and your
selves, though you have done very much, yet you are in arre^s ages still unto
God; God is still beforehand with mercies* though in mercy he has stirred up
your hearts to do thus.

These are three things methinks, wherein the Lord has showed himself to you,
that may for ever engage your hearts, with all alacrity to spend, and to be
spent for his cause: Why, the one is, he never would to this day suffer the
destroyer, notwithstanding all their intentions, (he would never suffer the
destroyer) to enter into this City; he has still diverted them, as you have
observed by some admirable acts of providence, when their resolutions have been
to come to this place, (the Lord knows in what condition you had been by this
day, if providence had not (at one time especially) diverted them from it; but
notwithstanding all this, God has not suffered them to this day, to shoot one
arrow into your City. But then there is another thing; as the Lord has not to
this day suffered them to come in a public hostile way, so he has from time
to time discovered all the Treacheries, Plots, and designs against you. When
the enemy could not destroy you above board, but thought to undermine your
Lives and States, and all (I need not say much to revive your memories,) of
late days, did God unknown to you, deliver you from destruction, and should
you now be backward to do for this God, that has preserved all that you have,
and all that you are? Nay, consider one thing more; he has in all the public
services; wherein indeed, if any people in the Land deserve our
acknowledgements and honor, this City has got it from the whole Land. But
this is that I was saying, God has in all the public Services and Battails
which have of late been fought in the land, God has hanged the shield of
salvation upon your shoulders, he has been pleased to cast all the glory, not
only of preservation, but of the great success, and honor, and victory, God
has cast it upon the people of London. And will you, that God has defended
all this while; will you that God has preserved from secret treachery; will
you, that God has given hearts all this while to stand for God above all the
people of the earth: will you that God has done so much for in the times of
battle, more then for all the rest, will you fail now to do for God? God
forbid, I beseech you rather that your hearts may be doubled and trebled for
that God that is so good to you. And not to trouble you long, because the truth
is, I am confident there needs no more to be said, you long rather who should
most show his affection at this time to preserve all: Why, there is one thing
more that might be spoken too, that is, touching our brethren of Scotland:
Why, so many things have been said already, that I can say nothing.

Our condition (worthy Sirs, our condition) of England, me thinks it is so
like the condition of that poor man, that went between Jericho and Jerusalem,
there the Priest he passes by on the one side, never so much as looks upon
him; Our Priests and Popish party; and another sordid party that cleaves to
them, they do not so much as consider the lamentable loss of this poor
Kingdom of England; the Levite he came, and looked on indeed, but he passes
by: I pray God it ^ee not laid to the charge of some Churches abroad, to whom
we have been helpful, that they can have ears, to hear of our distresses,
and wounds, but have not hands at all to help us, whether they have tongues to
pity us, we know not; Only there is the Samaritan (Sirs, the Samaritan) that
saw this wounded man, and that had compassion, and that went to him, and that
bound up his wounds, and that powered in Oil and Wine; Truly (Sirs) the
Samaritans that we find on earth, (for our great Physician in Heaven, we
bless him still for looking upon us; but the Samaritans, the only Samaritans
that we have on earth) they are our brethren in Scotland; O the tears that
they have shed for poor England! O the Prayers that they have in solemn
manner, from time to time, sent up to Heaven for poor England! O the Petitions
that they unknown for a long time to us, did direct unto his Majesty, if it had
been possible to take up all differences! and now yet again, as if their inward
compassions, as if their prayings to Heaven, as if their petitionings to man
were nothing, so sensible, so affectionate are they, to live with us, to dye
with us, that they are ready to come in, to adventure their dearest lives, to
save our lives; Why (Friends, why) what will move your hearts, if this does not
move your hearts? I do profess it is the greatest equity under heaven, to
lend our estates, some of our moneys to them, that are not unwilling to venture
their lives for us.

I know many Objections might be made; You have done much already, and the
sum is great; I say no more, There is nothing great, to a mind that is
great, and the Cause is great, and though the sum of money be great, yet
their love is greater, then all you can lay out to answer their love; And say
not (grumbling) we have done often and often; I say to you, as Christ said to
him that asked him, How often must I forgive my brother* Why, 70 times 7 times;
So will I say for this public Cause, you must do, and you must do, and yet
you must do, and yet you must do, as long as there is a penny in thy purse,
as long as there is strength in thy hand, as long as there is breath in thy
body, you must be all Servants to Christ, and Servants to the Churches of
Jesus Christ.

And so I beseech the God of Heaven, that what has been delivered unto you
this day, (and much has been spoken, I think as much as possibly can unto men)
that it may be effectual, to move your hearts, that what is done, may be
speedily done, and fully done, lest we be for ever undone; Nay, that we may
be preserved, and not only we, but all the Churches of God preserved. And the
Lord of Heaven make impression upon your hearts.

FINIS.
