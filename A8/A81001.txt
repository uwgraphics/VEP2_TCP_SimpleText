O blazon or coat of arms incorporating the Commonwealth Flag (1649-1651) P
By His Highness: A PROCLAMATION PROHIBITING The Disturbing of MINISTERS and
other CHRISTIANS in their Assemblies and Meetings.
IT having pleased the Lord, by the manifold Mercies and Deliverances which he
has wrought in and for these Nations of late Years, and the Blessings
wherewith he has blessed the Endeavors of the Good People thereof, in making
them Successful against his and their Enemies, to crown Us with this, as not
the least Token of his Favor and Good Will to Us, That there is a free and
uninterrupted Passage of the Gospel running through the midst of Us, and
Liberty for all to hold forth and profess with sobriety, their Light and
Knowledge therein, according as the Lord in his rich Grace and Wisdom has
dispensed to every man, and with the same Freedom to practice and exercise the
Faith of the Gospel, and to lead quiet and peaceable Lives in all Godliness and
Honesty, without any Interruption from the Powers God has set over this
Commonwealth, nay with all just and due Encouragement thereto, and Protection
in so doing by the same; A Mercy that is the Price of much Blood, and till of
late years denied to this Nation, as at this day it continues to be to most of
the Nations round about Us, and which all that fear God amongst Us ought duly
to consider and be thankful for in this Day, wherein God has so graciously
Visited and Redeemed his People; His Highness, as He reckons it a Duty
incumbent upon him, and shall take all possible Care to Preserve and Continue
this Freedom and Liberty to all Persons in this Commonwealth fearing God,
though of differing Judgments, by protecting them in the sober and quiet
exercise and profession of Religion, and the sincere worship of God, against
all such who shall; by imposing upon the Consciences of their Brethren, or
offering violence to their Persons, or any other way, seek to hinder them
therein; So likewise does He hold himself equally obliged to take Care, That,
on no pretense whatsoever, such freedom given should be extended by any beyond
those bounds which the Royal Law of Love and Christian Moderation have set us
in our walking one toward another; Or that thereby occasion should be taken by
any to abuse this Liberty to the disturbance or disquiet of any of their
Brethren in the same free Exercise of their Faith and Worship, which himself
enjoies of his own. And His Highness cannot but sadly lament the woeful
distemper that is fallen upon the Spirits of many professing Religion and the
Fear of God in these days, who instead of a suitable return to the Lord our
God for this Liberty, and all our other Mercies, and appearing in an answerable
carriage by a Spirit of tenderness and forbearance one toward another, and
provoking one another to Love and good Works, are found in a Spirit of
bitterness toward their Brethren, biting and devouring, hateful and hating one
another, and whilst they pretend the Liberty which Christ has purchased for
his People, do openly and avowedly, by rude and unchristian Practices, disturb
both the Public and Private meetings for preaching the Word, and other
Religious Exercises, and vilify, oppose, and interrupt the Public Preachers
in their Ministry, whereby the Liberty of the Gospel, the profession of
Religion, and the Name of God, is much dishonored and abused, and the Spirits
of all good men much grieved. His Highness therefore, having had many
informations from diverse parts of this Commonwealth of such Practices by diverse
men lately risen up under the names of Quakers, Ranters, and others, who do
daily both reproach and disturb the Assemblies and Congregations of Christians,
in their Public and Private Meetings, and interrupt the Preachers in
dispensing the Word, and others in their Worship, contrary to just Liberty, and
to the disturbance of the Public Peace, Does hold himself obliged by His
Trust to Declare His dislike of all such Practices, as being contrary to the
just Freedom and Liberties of the People, which by the Laws and Government of
this Commonwealth they ought to be Protected in; And does hereby strictly
Require and Command all Persons whatsoever, That they forbear henceforth all
such irregular and disorderly Practices. And if in Contempt hereof, any Persons
shall presume to offend as aforesaid, We shall esteem them as Disturbers of the
Civil Peace, and shall expect, and do require all Officers and Ministers of
Justice to proceed against them accordingly.

Given at White Hall the 15. day of February 1654.
