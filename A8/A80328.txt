A CONFESSION OF FAITH Of seven Congregations or Churches of Christ in LONDON,
which are commonly (but uniustly) called Anabaptists. PUBLISHED For the
vindication of the Truth, and information of the ignorant; likewise for the
taking off of those aspersions which are frequently both in Pulpit and Print
unjustly cast upon them.

But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call heresy, so
worship I the God of my Fathers, believing all things that are written in the
Law and the Prophets, and have hope toward God, which they themselves also
allow, that there shall be a resurrection of dead both of the just and unjust.
Acts 24. 14, 15. For we cannot but speak the things that we have seen and
heard, Acts 4. 20. If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil; but if
well, why smitest thou me? John 18. 23. Blessed are ye when men revile you,
and say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake. Rejoice, etc.
Matthew. 11. 12. and 19. 29. The second Impression corrected and enlarged.

TO THE RIGHT HONOrable the Lords, Knights, Citizens and Burgesses in
Parliament assembled.
Right Honorable and most Noble Patriots,
IN as much as there has been a Doctor Featleys Book dedicated to the
Parliament.
Book lately presented unto you, in whose Dedicatory Epistle there are many
heinous accusations unjustly and falsely laid against us, we conceived it
necessary to make some declaration of our innocence, and (to the end) humbly to
present unto your view this our Confession of Faith: Here we unfainedly
declare, what in our hearts we judge, and what we teach, and according to
this Rule we desire and endeavor, through the grace of God, to lead our lives.
This Confession of our Faith we send forth to speak the truth for us, and so to
make our innocence to appear; desiring that the same light may guide others
also to the same way of truth and of obedience both to God and to the
Magistrate, who is the Minister of God to us for good. We hope your Honors
will permit us to speak with modesty in our just defense. And when any shall
provoke you to lift up a hand against us, we desire you may seriously consider
Gamaliels counsel in Acts 5. We take no thought for our selves, for the Lord
our God is all-sufficient; but we desire and pray that you may do nothing
against Christ, neither in his members, nor in his ordinances, that there may
be no wrath upon you from the Lord, but that you knowing the innocent and
protecting them according to the will of God, may for the same be famous unto
all generations, and the memorial of your names may be precious among the
Saints till the coming of King Jesus.

To the judicious and impartial READER.
COURTEOVS READER;
IT is no wonder if it seem strange to thee, that we should publish a
confession of our faith, who are frequently termed to be Heretics and
Schismatiques, and what not, though unjustly; neither is it any discouragement
unto us, though this sect (as they call the Anabaptists) is Acts 28. 22.
every where spoken against, and in that we are charged (for Christ's Name sake)
with the same things our Lord Jesus Christ, and his Apostles were accused of;
it is a mercy, an honor, and a comfort unto us, when we remember what our Lord
has said unto us, Blessed are ye when Mat 5. 11, 12.
men shall revile you, and persecute you, and say all manner of evil falsely,
for my sake; Rejoice and be exceeding glad, for great is your reward in heaven,
for so persecuted they the Prophets that were before you. The Disciple is not
above his Master, nor the servant above his Lord; it is enough for the Disciple
that he be as his Master, and the servant as his Lord. If they have called the
Master of the house Mat. 10. 24, 25
Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of his household? If the world
hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you: if ye were of the
world, the world would love her own, but because ye are not of the world, but
I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hates you. The servant
is not greater then the Lord; if Joh. 15. 18, 19, 20, 21. See Acts 21. 28. 30,
31. and 14. 22. 2 Timothy 3. 12. 1 Pet. 4. 13.
they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you, etc. All these things
will they do unto you for my Names sake, because they know not him that sent
me; Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution;
but rejoice in as much as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings, that when
his glory shall be revealed, ye may be clad also with exceeding joy.

Our Lord Jesus was accused to be a sedtious and mutinous fellow: Luke 23. 25.
Paul was called a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition, and a ringleader
Acts 24. 1. 5. 6
of the sect of the Nazarens; Saying, Away with such a fellow, Acts 18. 13.
for it is not fit he should live; Saying, This fellow persuades men to
worship God contrary to the Law: and our Lord Jesus Christ was accused of
perverting the people, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar; Luke 23. 2.
14. Mat. 15. 1. to 9
and that he and his Disciples did teach novelties, and brake the traditions of
the Elders. Christ was accused to have a Devil, and to Joh. 10. 20. Act. 26.
24, 25 Act. 17. 18, 19. Mark. 14. 64.
be mad, saying to the people, Why do ye hear him? Paul was esteemed to be
mad: also they said, What will this babbler say? And that he taught new
doctrine: and Christ was accused to speak blasphemy, and they all condemned
him to be guilty of death. So some are offended at us for meeting in houses to
preach, and would have us punished for it; notwithstanding, it was Christ and
his Apostles practice to do so, whose example we are to follow. Christ taught
upon a mountain, and in a ship. Mat. 5. 1. 2. and 13. 2. Acts 20. 20. Act. 1.
13. 15, 16 and 2. 2. Act. 16. 13, 14. Act. 20. 7, 8, 9. Act. 28. 30, 31.
Paul preached from house to house; also the Church met together in an upper
room, where Peter preached; and Paul preached, and converted Lydia by the
River side; the Disciples met together in the night in an upper room; Paul
preached two years in an hired house, and received all that came unto him. If
he had lived in these days and done so, it is to be feared some would have
petitioned against him: So some accuse us to be disturbers of the peace of the
Commonwealth; yet all that know us can testify for us, that we meet together
and depart in a peaceable manner: And from Acts 17. 5, 6, 7. it will appear,
what persons they were that disturbed the public peace, it is fit such persons
should be taken notice of and accordingly punished.

So we are blamed, because we frequent not their Temples; we dare not Acts 7.
48.
trust in lying words, saying, The Temple of the Lord, the Temple of Act. 17.
24, 25. 1 Cor. 3. 16. 1 Cor. 6. 3. 19. 1 Pet. 2. 4, 5. Joh. 4. 20. etc.
the Lord are these; we know the most High dwells not in Temples made with
hands; and that we are the Temple of the living God; and that our bodies are
the Temples of the holy Ghost; and that Christ's Church is not built with dead
stones. And because there are but a few of us, some conceive we are in an
error, and that the least number should yield to the greater; then it seems,
if the number of the Papists or Atheists Acts 14. 16. Exodus 23. 2. 1 King. 22.
6, 7, etc.
exceed the number of the Protestants, they must forsake their Religion. God in
times past suffered all Nations to walk in their own ways; there was but one
true Prophet to 400 false. After three years preaching and working miracles by
Christ, there was but a small number. Christ calls his, Acts 1. 14, 15. Luke 12.
32. Mat. 7. 13, 14. Rev. 13. 7. 16. 17.
a little flock: the Scripture declares the greatest number followed after the
beast. Also those that preach amongst us, are esteemed as the Apostles were, to
be unlearned and ignorant men. Apollo was instructed more perfectly in the way
of God by Aquila, a tradesman, and Priscilla his Acts 4. 13. Acts 18. 1, 2, 3.
26
wife: but the Scripture says; As every man has received the gift, 1 Pet. 4.
10, 11. See 1 Cor. 14. 3. 26. 31.
even so minister the same one to another, as good Stewards of the manifold
grace of God. Also some say of us, that we be of several sects, and Luke 23.
12. Ioh. 9. 22. See 1 Cor. 1. 10, 11.
that we cannot agree among our selves. Pilate and Herod agreed together to
crucify Christ; we dare not agree as the Jews did that if any did confess
that Jesus was the Christ, he should be put out of the Synagogue. The union
Christ prayed for, we desire, and for such an agreement as John 17. 21.
agrees not with the truth, we may not agree unto, therefore we desire it not;
yet the Paedobaptists differ more among themselves then we do, and if this
Ephesians. 4. 3. to 17.
their reason have any strength in it, it is against themselves: the several
sects of Paedobaptists, be Papists, Arrians, Nestorians, Pelagians, Donatists,
Eutychians, Grecians, Lutherans, Arminians, Episcopans, Nicolaties, Calvinists,
Zuinglians, Hussites^, and above twenty other several sects, which are all
baptizers of infants, and notwithstanding, for other points, are all asunder,
and have all rent one from another, therefore we send Mat. 7. 3, 4, 5.
them to follow the counsel of Christ.

As the Watchmen dealth with the Spouse of Christ, in her seeking her beloved,
Song 3. 2. 5. with 5, 6, 7.
so they deal with us, they finding us out of that common and broad way
themselves walk in, they smite us, and take away our veil, and veil us with
reproaches, and odious names; to incense all, both good and bad, against us,
that we may appear vile in the eyes and hearts of all that behold us, or
shall hear of us, which they endeavor to do, both in Pulpit and print, Acts
16. 19.
not fearing to charge us, with holding free will, falling from grace, denying
election, original sin, childrens salvation, the old Testament, and men's
propriety in their estates, and censuring all to be damned that are not of our
judgment and practice; all which we disclaim, because they are untrue. And
as for the other things, whereof we are accused, we refer those who desire
further satisfaction to the answers of them In a small Treatise, entitled,
Briest Considerations on Dr Featly his Book, entitled, Tho dipper dipped, by
Samuel Richardson.
: yet by reason of the many accusations that are cast upon us, although they
cannot prove the things whereof we are accused, yet the generality of the
people are incensed against us, and are encouraged, and set on by such, to seek
out the place of our meetings, which are the more private, not because they are
private, but because we have not any more public places; but if any shall
please to procure us more larger places to meet in, we are willing to embrace
them with thankfulness and joy, although no man should speak for us to those
in an thoritie, from whom one word were enough to protect us, from the violence
we should be subject unto; but as it was then, Acts 17. 5, 6, 7. so it is now;
yet must Act 17. 5, 6, 7.
we bear all the blame; but our God will in his time clear our innocence,
although now many stand looking upon us as a people (holding such things) not
worthy to live, and are in danger by the rude multitude gathering together to
stone us: and had it been against our persons only, we would have held our
peace, and committed our cause to God; but considering it is the truth that we
profess that suffers, we may not, nor dare not be neuters in matters of so
high a nature, but come in and speak to the help of the Lord against the mighty.

Therefore to free our selves, and the truth we profess, from such unjust
aspersions, that it may be at liberty, though we be in bonds, we have
published a brief confession of our Faith, (which we conceive most void of
contention in these sad and troublesome times) the thoughts of our hearts as in
the presence of God we here declare, that it may appear to the consciences of
them that fear God, what wrong we suffer from some who have ability to cast
mists, Jude 14. 15.
and dark clouds, which overshadow the glory of the truth, and them that
profess it. And although they acknowledge with us, that the truth is not fully
discovered, yet they will tie all future discovery to a former light, and
conceive they do well in so doing. But God will by his truth show their error,
and exalt Jesus Christ the chief cornerstone, which the builders so much
reject. And lest this should be thought to be the judgment of some particular
persons, this is done by the consent and appointment of seven Congregations or
Churches in London, with the names of some of each of them subscribed in the
behalf of the whole. And although we be distinct in our meetings, for
convenience; yet are we one in faith, fellowship, and communion, holding Jesus
Christ for our Head and Lawgiver, under whose Rule and government we desire to
walk, and to follow the Lamb wheresoever he goes, that when our Lord and King
shall call us to account, we may be found ready and worthy to be received into
our Masters joy. Until which time we desire to spend these few days we have
here to remain, to the glory of God, the honor of the Gospel, the Saints
comfort, and our Countries good, to our own account at the great day when
Christ shall come in flaming fire, taking vengeance on 2 Thessalonians. 1. 8.
them that know not God, and that obey not the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.

A CONFESSION OF FAITH of seven Congregations or Churches of Christ in London,
which are commonly (though unjustly) called ANABAPTISTS.
I.
THe Lord our God is but 1 Cor. 8. 6. Esaias 44. 6. Chap. 46. 9.
one God, whose Exodus 3. 14.
subsistence is in himself; whose essence cannot be comprehended by any but
himself; who only has immortality, 1 Timothy 6. 16.
dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; who is in himself most
Esaias 43. 15.
holy, every way Psalm. 147. 5.
infinite, in Deuteronomy. 32. 3.
greatness, Job 36. 5.
wisdom, Jer. 10. 12.
power, love; Exodus 34. 6, 7.
merciful and gracious, long-suffering and abundant in goodness and truth,
who gives Acts 17. 28. Romans 11. 36.
being, moving, and preservation to all creatures.

II.
In this divine and infinite being, there is the 1 Cor. 1. 33
Father, the John 1. 1.
Word, and the Chap. 15. 26
holy Spirit, each having the whole divine Exodus 3. 14.
essence, yet the essence undivided; all infinite without any beginning,
therefore but 1 Cor. 8. 6.
one God, who is not to be divided in nature, and being, but distinguished by
several peculiar relative properties.

III.
God has Esa. 46. 10. Ephesians. 1. 11. Romans 11. 33.
decreed in himself before the world was concerning all things, Psalm. 115. 3.
and 135. 6.
whether necessary, Psalm. 33. 15. 1 Samuel 10. 9. 26. Pro. 21. 6. Exodus 21. 13.
Pro. 16. 33. Psalm. 144. Esa. 45. 7. Jer. 14. 22. Mat. 6. 28. 30. Col. 1. 16,
17. Nu. 23. 19, 20 Romans 3. 4. Jer. 10. 10. Ephesians. 1. 4, 5. Jud. 4. 6. Pro. 16. 4.
accidental or voluntary, with all the circumstances of them, to work,
dispose, and bring about all things according to the counsel of his own will,
to his glory: (yet without being the Author of sin, or having fellowship with
any therein) in which appears his wisdom in disposing all things,
unchangeablenesse, power, and faithfulness in accomplishing his decree: and
God has before the foundation of the world, foreordained some men to eternal
life, through Jesus Christ, to the praise and glory of his grace; leaving the
rest in their sin to their just condemnation, to the praise of his justice.

IV.
In the Genesis 1. 1. Col. 1. 16. Esa. 45. 12.
beginning God made all things very good; created man after his own 1 Cor. 15.
45, 46.
image, filled with all meet perfection of nature, and free from all sin; but
Eccles. 7. 29.
long he abode not in this honor, Satan using the subtilty of the Genesis 3. 1.
4, 5. 2 Cor. 11. 3.
Serpent to seduce first Eve, then by her seducing Adam; who without any
compulsion, in eating the forbidden fruit, 1 Timothy 2. 14.
transgressed the command of God, and fell, whereby Gal. 3. 22.
death came upon all his posterity, who now are conceived in sin, and by nature
the children of wrath, the servants of sin, the subjects of Romans 5. 12. 18, 19.
Chap. 6. 22. Ephesians. 2. 3.
death, and other miseries in this world, and for ever, unless the Lord Jesus
Christ set them free.

V.
God in his infinite Job 38. 11.
power and wisdom, does Esa. 46. 10, 11. Eccles. 3. 14.
dispose all things to the end for which they were created, that neither good
nor evil befalls any by chance, or without his Mat. 10. 29, 30. Exodus 21. 13.
Pro. 16. 33.
providence; And that whatsoever befalls the Elect, is by his appointment, for
his glory, and their Romans 8. 28.
good.

VI.
All the Elect being Jer. 31. 2.
loved of God with an everlasting love, are Ephesians. 1. 3. 7. Chap. 2. 4. 9. 2.
These. 5. 9.
redeemed, quickened, and saved, not by themselves, nor their own works, lest
any man should boast, but only and wholly by God, of his free Acts 13. 38. 2
Cor. 5. 21. Ier. 9. 23, 24.
grace and mercy through Jesus Christ, who is made unto us by God, 1 Cor. 1.
30, 31 Ier. 23. 6.
wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption, and all in all, that
he that rejoices, might rejoice in the Lord.

VII.
And Ioh. 17. 3. Heb. 5. 9.
this is life eternal, that we might know him the only true God, and Jesus
Christ whom he has sent. And 1 These. 1. 8. Ioh. 6. 36.
on the contrary, the Lord will render vengeance in flaming fire, to them that
know not God, and obey not the Gospel of Jesus Christ.

VIII.
The rule of this knowledge, faith, and obedience, concerning the worship of
God, in which is contained the whole duty of man, is (not Col. 2. 23. Mat. 15.
9. 6.
men's laws, or unwritten traditions, but) only the word of God contained in
the holy Ioh. 5. 39. 2 Timothy 3. 15, 16, 17.
Scriptures, in which is plainly recorded whatsoever is needful for us to
know, believe, and practice, which are the only rule of holiness and
obedience Esa. 8. 20. Gal. 1. 8, 9. Acts 3. 22, 23.
for all Saints, at all times, in all places to be observed.

IX.
The Lord Jesus Christ, of whom Genesis 3. 15. Chap. 22. 18. and 49. 10. Dan. 7.
13. and 9. 24, 25, 26.
Moses and the Prophets wrote, the Apostles preached, he is the Pro. 8. 23.
John 1. 1, 2, 3. Heb. 1. 8
Son of God, the brightness of his glory, etc. by whom he made the world, who
upholdeth and governs all things that he has made; who also when the Gal. 4.
4. d Heb. 7. 14. Rev. 5. 5. with Genesis 49. 9, 10. Romans 1. 3. and 9. 10. Matthew.
1. 16 with Luke 3. 23. 26. Heb. 2. 16. Isa: 53. 3, 4, 5. Heb. 4. 15.
fullness of time was come, was made of a woman, of the Tribe of Judah, of the
seed of Abraham and David; to wit, of the virgin Mary, the holy Spirit coming
down upon her, the power of the most High over-shadowing her, and he was also
tempted as we are, yet within sin.

X.
1 Timothy 8. 5. Heb. 9. 15. John 14. 6
Jesus Christ is made the Mediator of the new and everlasting Covenant of grace
between God and Man, ever to be Isa. 9. 6, 7.
perfectly and fully the Prophet, Priest, and King of the Church of God for
evermore.

XI.
Unto this office he was appointed by Prove. 8. 23. Isa. 42. 6. and 49. 15
God from everlasting, and in respect of his manhood, from the womb called,
separated, and Isa. 11. 2, 3, 4, 5. and 61. 1, 2. with Luke 4. 17, 22. John 1.
14. 16. and 3. 34.
anointed most fully and abundantly with all gifts necessary, God having
without measure powered out his Spirit upon him.

XII.
Concerning his Mediatorship, the Scripture holds forth Christ's call to his
office: For Heb. 5 4, 5, 6.
none takes this honor upon him, but he that is called of God as was Aaron, it
being an action of God, whereby a special promise being made, he ordains his
Son to this office; which promise is, that Christ should be made a sacrifice
for sin, that he should see his Isa. 53. 10 11.
seed, and prolong his days, and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his
hand, John 3. 16. Romans 8. 32.
all of mere free and absolute grace toward Gods elect, and without any
condition foreseen in them to procure it.

XIII.
This office to be Mediator, that is, to be Prophet, 1 Timothy 2. 5. Heb. 7. 24.
Dan 7, 14. Acts 4. 12. Luke 1. 33. John 14. 6.
Priest, and King of the Church of God, is so proper to Christ, that neither in
whole, or any part thereof, it cannot be transferred from him to any other.

XIV.
This office to which Christ is called, is threefold, as Deuteronomy. 8. 15, with Acts
3. 22. 23.
a Prophet, Heb. 3. 1. and 4. 12. 13.
Priest, and Psalm. 2. 6.
King: this number and order of offices is necessary; for in respect of our 2
Cor. 5. 20. Acts 26. 18.
ignorance, we stand in need of his Prophetical office. And in respect of our
great Col. 1. 22
alienation from God, we need his Priestly office to reconcile us: and in
respect of our averseness and utter inability to return to God, we need his
Kingly office, to John 16 8.
convince, Psalm. 110. 3
subdue, Cant. 1. 3. Ioh. 6. 44.
draw, Phil. 4. 13.
uphold and 2 Timothy 4. 18.
preserve us to his heavenly Kingdom.

XV.
Concerning the prophecy of Christ, it is that whereby he has John 1. 18.
and 12. 49, 50. and 15. and 17. 8. Deuteronomy. 18. 15.
revealed the will of God, whatsoever is needful for his servants to know and
Mat. 23. 10.
obey; and therefore he is called not only a Prophet and Doctor, and the Heb
3. 1.
Apostle of our profession, and the Mal. 3. 1.
Angel of the covenant, but also the very 1 Cor. 1. 24. Col. 2. 3.
wisdom of God, in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge,
who for ever continues revealing the same truth of the Gospel to his people.

XVI.
That he might be a Prophet every way complete, it was necessary he should
be God, and also that he John 1. 18. Acts 3. 22, with Deuteronomy. 18. 15. Heb. 1, 1
should be man: for unless he had been God, he could never have perfectly
understood the will of God; and unless he had been man, he could not sutably
have unfolded That Jesus Christ is God, is wonderful clearly expressed in the
Scriptures: he is called, The mighty God, Isa. 9. 6. That Word was God, Joh. 1.
1. Christ who is God over all Romans 9. 5. God manifested in the flesh, 1 Timothy 3.
16. The same is very God, 1 John 5. 20. He is the first Rev. 1. 8. he gives
being to all things, and without him was nothing made, John 1. 2. he forgiveth
sins, Matthew. 9. 6. he is before Abraham Ioh 8. 58. he was and is, and ever will
be the same Heb. 13 8. he is always with his to the end of the world, Mat. 28.
20. which could not be said of Jesus Christ, if he were not God. And to the
Son he says, Thy Throne, O God, is for ever and ever, Heb. 1. 8. John 1. 18.

Also, Christ is not only perfectly God, but perfect Man made of a woman, Gal.
4. 4. made of the seed of David, Romans 1. 3. Coming out of the loins of David,
Acts 2: 30. of Iesse and Judah, Acts 13. 23. In that the children were
partakers of flesh and blood, he himself likewise took part with them, Heb.
2. 14. he took not on him the nature of Angels, but the seed of Abraham, v. 16.
So that we are bone of his bone, and flesh of his flesh. Ephesians. 5. 30 So that, he
that sanctifies, and they that are sanctified, are all of one, Heb. 2. 11. See
Act. 3. 22. Deuteronomy. 18. 15. Heb. 1. 1.


it in his own person to men.

XVII.
Concerning his John 17. 19.
Priesthood, Christ having sanctified himself, has appeared once to put away
sin by Heb. 5. 7, 8, 9. and 10. 12. Romans 5. 19
that one offering of himself a sacrifice for sin, by which he has fully
finished and suffered all things God Ephesians. 5. 2. Col. 1. 20. Ephesians. 2. 14, 15,
16. Romans 8. 34
required for the salvation of his elect, and removed all Rites and Shadows,
etc. And is now entered within the veil into the Holy of Holies, which is the
presence Heb. 9. 24. and 8. 1. 1 Pet. 2 5. Ioh. 4. 23, 24.
of God. Also, he makes his people a spiritual House, an holy Priesthood, to
offer up spiritual Sacrifice acceptable to God through him. Neither does the
Father accept, or Christ offer to the Father any other worship or worshippers.

XVIII.
This Priesthood was not legal or temporary, but according to the order of Heb
7. 17.
Melchisedec, and is stable and perfect, not for a Heb. 7. 16, 18, 19, 20, 21,
24, 25.
time, but for ever, which is suitable to Jesus Christ, as to him that ever
lives: Christ was the Priest, Sacrifice and Altar: he was a Priest according
to both natures; he was a Sacrifice according to his humane nature; whence in
Heb. 5. 6.
Scripture it is attributed to his body, to his Heb. 10. 10. 1 Pet. 1. 18. 19.
Col. 1. 20. 22.
blood: yet the effectualnesse of this Sacrifice did depend upon his divine

his Heb. 9. 13. Acts 20. 28.

Altar to sanctify that which is offered upon it, and so it ought to be of
greater dignity then the Sacrifice it self.

Concerning his Kingly office, 1 Cor. 15. 4. 1 Pet. 3, 21, 22. Mat. 28. 18, 19,
20. Luke 24. 51, Acts 1. 1. and 5. 30, 31. John 19. 36. Romans 14. 9. John 5. 26,
27. Romans 5. 6, 7, 8. and 14. 17. Gal. 5. 22, 23. Mark 1. 27. Heb. 1. 14. John
16. 15. Job. 1. 8. Romans 1. 21, 27 18. Ephesians. 4 17, 18. 2 Pet. 8.
Christ being risen from the dead, and ascended into heaven, and having all
power in heaven and earth, he does spiritually govern his Church, and does
exercise his power over all Angels and men, good and bad, to the preservation
and salvation of the elect, and to the overruling and destruction of his
enemies. By this Kingly power he applies the benefits, virtue, and fruits of
his Prophecy and Priesthood to his elect, subduing their sins, preserving
and strengthening them in all their conflicts against Satan, the World, and the
Flesh, keeping their hearts in faith and filial fear by his spirit: by this
his mighty power he rules the vessels of wrath, using, limiting and
restraining them as it seems good to his infinite wisdom.

XX.
This his Kingly power shall be more fully manifested 1 Cor. 15. 24, 28, Heb.
9. 28. 2 Thessalonians. 1. 9, 10. 1 Thessalonians. 4. 15, 16, 17. John 17, 21, 26.
when he shall come in glory to reign among his Saints, when he shall put down
all rule and authority under his feet, that the glory of the Father may be
perfectly manifested in his Son, and the glory of the Father and the Son in
all his members.

XXI.
Jesus Christ by his death did purchase salvation for Ephesians. 1. 14. Heb. 5. 9.
Mat. 1. 21. John 17. 6. Heb. 7. 25. 1 Cor. 2. 1^. Romans 8. 29, 30. 1 Ioh. 5. 12.
Ioh. 15. 13. Ioh. 3. 16.
the Elect that God gave unto him: These only have interest in him, and
fellowship with him, for whom he makes intercession to his Father in the
behalf of, and to them alone does God by his Spirit apply this redemption
unto, as also the free gift of eternal life is given to them, and none else.

XXII.
Faith is the Ephesians. 2. 8, John 6. 29. and 4. 10. Phil. 1. 29. Gal. 5. 22.
gift of God, wrought in the hearts of the Elect by the Spirit of God; by which
faith they come to know and believe the truth of the Ioh. 17. 17. Heb. 4. 11,
12. John 6. 63
Scriptures, and the excellency of them above all other writings, and all
things in the world, as they hold forth the glory of God in his attributes, the
excellency of Christ in his nature and offices, and of the power and fullness
of the Spirit in its workings and operations, and so are enabled to cast their
souls upon this truth thus believed.

XXIII.
All those that have this precious faith wrought in Mat. 7. 24, 25. John 13.
10. John 10. 28, 29.
them by the Spirit, can never finally nor totally fall away, seeing the gifts
of God are without repentance; 1 Pet. 1. 4, 5, 6. Isa. 49. 13, 14, 15, 16.
so that he still begets and nourishes in them faith, repentance, love, joy,
hope, and all the graces of the Spirit unto immortality; And though many
storms and floods arise, and beat against them, yet they shall never be able
to take them off that foundation and rock, which by faith they are fastened
upon; notwithstanding, through unbelief, and the temptations of Satan, the
sensible sight of this light and love, be clouded and overwhelmed for a time;
yet God is still the same, and they shall be sure to be kept by the power of
God unto salvation, where they shall enjoy their purchased possession, they
being engraven upon the palms of his hands, and their names having been
written in the book of life from all eternity.

XXIV.
Faith is ordinarily Romans 10. 17. 1 Cor. 1. 28.
begotten by the preaching of the Gospel, or word of Christ, without respect to
Romans 9. 16.
any power or agency in the creature; but it being wholly Ezekiel. 16. 16. Romans 3.
12.
passive, and dead in trespasses and sins, does believe and is converted by no
less Romans 1. 16. Ephesians. 1. 19. Col. 2. 12.
power then that which raised Christ from the dead.

XXV.
The preaching of the Gospel to the conversion of sinners, is Ioh. 3. 14, 15.
and 1. 12. Isa. 55. 1. Ioh. 7. 37.
absolutely free; no way requiring as absolutely necessary, any qualifications,
preparations, or terrors of the Law, or preceding ministry of the Law; but
only and alone the naked soul, a 1 Timothy 1. 15. Romans 4. 5. and 5. 8. Acts 5.
^0, 31. and 2. 36. 1 Cor. 1. 22. 24.
sinner and ungodly to receive Christ crucified, dead, and buried, and risen
again, who is made a Prince and a Savior for such sinners as through the
Gospel shall be brought to believe on him.

XXVI.
The same power that converts to faith in Christ, carries on the 1 Pet. 1. 5.
2 Cor. 12. 9.
soul through all duties, temptations, conflicts, sufferings; and whatsoever a
believer is, he is c Phil. 2. 12, 13. Ioh. 13. 5. ^ Gal. 2. 19, 29.
by 1 Cor. 15. 10.
grace, and is carried on in all obedience and temptations by the same.

XXVII.
All believers are by Christ, united to God, by which a 1 Thessalonians. 1. 1. John 17.
21. and 20. 17. Heb. 2. 11. 1 John 4. 16.
union, God is one with them, and they are one with him; and that all believers
are the Gal. 2. 19, 20
Sons of God, and joint heirs with Christ, to whom belong all the promises of
this life, and that which is to come.

XXVIII.
Those that have union with Christ, are justified from 1 John 1. 7. Heb. 10.
14. and 9. 26. 2 Cor. 5. 19. Romans 3, 23. Acts 13. 38, 39. Romans 5. 1. and 3. 25,
30.
all their sins by the blood of Christ; which justification is a gracious and
full acquitance of a guilty sinner from all sin, by God, through the
satisfact on that Christ has made by his death for all their sins. And this
applied (in the manifestation of it) through faith.

XXIX.
All believers are a holy and 1 Cor. 11. 1 Pet. 2. 9.
sanctified people, and that sanctification is a spiritual grace of the Ephesians. 1.
4.
new covenant, and an effect of the 1 John 4. 16 Mat. 28. 20.
love of God manifested in the soul, whereby the believer presses after a
heavenly and Evangelicall obedience to all the commands which Christ as Head
and King in his new covenant has prescribed to them.

XXX.
All believers through the knowledge of 2 Cor. 5. 19. Romans 5. 9. 10.
that justification of life given by the Father, and brought forth by the blood
of Christ, have as their great privilege of that new Isa. 54. 10. and 26. 12.
covenant, peace with God, and reconciliation, whereby they that were afar
off are made nigh by Ephesians. 2. 13. 14.
that blood, and have Ephesians. 4. 7.
peace passing all understanding; yea, joy in God through our Lord Jesus
Christ, by Romans 5. 10, 11.
whom we have received the atonement.

XXXI.
All believers in the time of this life, are in a continual Romans 7. 23, 2^.
Ephesians. 6, 10, 11, 12. 13.
warfare and combat against sin, self, the world, and the Devil; and are
liable to all manner of afflictions, Heb. 2. 9, 10. 2 Timothy 3. 12.
tribulations, and persecutions, being Romans 8. 29. 1 Thessalonians. 3. 3. Gal. 2. 19.
20. 2 Cor. 5. 7.
predestined and appointed thereunto, and whatsoever the Saints possess or
enjoy of God spiritually, is by faith, and outward and temporal things are
lawfully enjoyed by a civil right by them who have Deuteronomy. 2. 5.
no faith.

XXXII.
The only strength by which the Saints are enabled to encounter with all
oppositions and John 16. 33.
trials, is John 15. 5. Phil. 4. 11.
only by Jesus Christ, who is the Captain of their salvation, being made
perfect through Heb. 2. 9, 10.
sufferings, who has engaged d ^ Tim. 4. 18.
his faithfulness and strength to assist them in all their afflictions, and to
uphold them in all their temptations, and to preserve them by his power to his
everlasting Kingdom.

XXXIII.
Jesus Christ has here on earth a spiritual kingdom, which is his Church, whom
he has purchased and redeemed a Matthew. 11. 1^, 2 Thessalonians. 1. 15. and 1 Cor. 1.
2. Ephesians. 1. 1
to himself as a peculiar inheritance; which Church is a company of visible
Saints, Romans 1. 7. Acts 19. 8, 9. and 26. 18. 2 Cor 6. 17. Rev. 18. 4.
called and separated from the world by the Word and Acts 2. 37. with 10 37.

being baptized into that faith, and joined to the Lord, and each to other, by
mutual agreement in the Acts 9. 26. 1 Pet. 2 5.
practical enjoyment of the ordinances commanded by Christ their Head and King.

XXXIV.
To this Church he Man 28. 18, 19, 20.
has made his promises, and given the signs of his covenant, 1 Cor. 11. 24.
and 3. 21. 2 Cor. 6. 18. Romans 9. 4, 5. Psalm. 13 3. 3.

And all his servants of all estates (are to acknowledge a Acts 2. 41. 47. Isa.

they are made meet to be partakers of their Acts 20. 32.

and outward; (and although each person has a Acts 5. 4.
propriety in his own estate, yet they are to supply each others wants,
according as their Acts 2. 44, 45. and 4. 34. 35.
necessities shall require, that the name of Jesus Luke 14. 26. 1 Timothy 6. 1.

also being come, they are here by himself to be bestowed in their several
order, due place, peculiar use, being fitly compact and knit together Ephesians. 4.

according to the effectual working of every part, to the edifying of it self
in love.

XXXVI.
Being thus Joined, every Church Act. 1. 23. 26. ^ 6. 3. with 15. 22, 25.
has power given them from Christ, for their wel-being to choose among
themselves meet persons for Romans 12. 7. 8.
Elders and Deacons, being qualified according to the Word, 1 Timothy 3. 2, 6, 7,
8. 1 Cor. 12. 8. 28. Heb. 13. 7, 17, 1 Pet. 5. 1, 2. 3.
as those which Christ has appointed in his Testament, for the feeding,
governing, serving, and building up of his Church, and that none have any power
to 1 Pet. 4. 15.
impose on them either these or any other.

XXXVII.
That the Ministers lawfully called, as aforesaid, ought Heb. 5 4. Ioh. 10. 3,
4, Acts 20. 28, 29. Romans 12. 7, 8. Heb. 13. 7, 17. 1 Pet. 5. 1, 2, 3.
to continue in their calling and place, according to Gods ordinance, and
carefully to feed the flock of God committed to them, not for filthy lucre, but
of a ready mind.

XXXVIII.
The Ministers of Christ ought to have whatsoever a 1 Cor. 9. 7, 14. Gal. 6 8.
Phil. 4. 15, 16.
they shall need, supplied freely by the Church, that according to Christ's
ordinance they that preach the Gospel b 2 Cor. 10. 4. 1 Timothy 1. 9. Psalm. 110. 3.
should live of the Gospel by the law of Christ.

XXXIX.
Baptism is an ordinance of the Matthew. 28. 18, 19 John 4. 1. Mark 16. 15, 16.
Acts 2. 37, 38, and 8. 36, 37, 38, and 18. ^.
new Testament, given by Christ, to be dispensed upon persons professing faith,
or that are made Disciples; who upon profession of faith, ought to be baptized,
and after to partake of the Lords supper.

XL.
That the way and manner of the Matthew. 3. 6. 16. Mark 1 5. verse. 9. reads [into
Iordan] in Greek. Ioh. 3. 23. Acts 8. 38
dispensing this ordinance, is dipping or plunging the body under water; it
being a sign, must answer the things signified, which is, that interest the
Saints have in the Romans 6. 3, 4, 5, 6 1 Cor. 15. 28, 29.
death, burial, and resurrection of Christ: And that as certainly as the body b
Rev. 1. 5. and 7. 14. with Heb. 10. 22.
is buried under water, and risen again, so certainly shall the bodies of the
Saints be raised by the power of Christ, in the day of the resurrection, to
reign with Christ. The word Baptizo signifies to dip or plunge, (yet so as
convenient garments be both upon the Administrator and subject with all
modesty.)


XLI.
The person designed by Christ to dispense Baptism, Isa 8. 16. Ephesians. 3 7. Mar
18. 19. Joh. 4. 2. Acts 20. 7. Chap. 11. 10. 1 Cor. 11. 24. with 1 Cor. 10 16,
17.
the Scripture holds forth to be a Disciple; it being no where tied to a
particular Church Officer, or person extraordinarily sent, the Commission
injoyning the administration, being given to them as considered Disciples,
being men able to preach the Gospel.

XLII.
Christ has likewise given power to his Church to Romans 16. 2. Mat. 18. 17.
receive in, and cast out, any member that deserves it; and this power is given
to every Congregation, and not 1 Cor. 5. 4. ^* 13. with 12. 6 2, ^
to one particular person, either member or officer, but in relation to the
whole body, in reference to their faith 2 Cor. 2. 6, 7
and fellowship.

LXIII.
And every particular member of each Church, how Mat. 18. 16, 17, 18 Acts 11.
2, 3 1 Timothy 5. 19, 20 21
excellent, great, or learned soever, is subject to this censure and judgment;
and that the Church ought not without great care and tenderness, and due
advice, but by the Col. 4. 17. Acts 15. 1, 2, 3
rule of faith to proceed against her members.

XLIV.
Christ for the keeping of this Church in holy and Act. 20, 27, 2^ Heb. 13. 17.
2^ Mat. 24. 45. 1 These. 5. 2. 1* Jude 3. 20. Heb. 10. 34, 35 and 12. 15.
orderly communion, places some special men over the Church, who by their
office, are to govern, oversee, visit, watch; So likewise for the better
keeping thereof, in all places by the members, he has given authority, and
laid duty upon all to watch over one another.

XLV.
Also such to whom God has given gifts in the 1 Cor. 14. 3 etc.
Church, may and ought to Prophecy, according to the Romans 12. 6. 1 Pet. 4. 10,
11 1 Cor. 12. 7. ^ 1 These. 10 19, 20, 21
proportion of faith, and so to teach publicly the Word of God, for the
edification, exhortation, and comfort of the Church.

XLVI.
Thus being rightly gathered, and continuing in the Rev. 2. and 3. Chap. Acts
15. 12. 1 Cor. 1. 10 Heb. 10 25 Jude 19. Rev. 2. 20, 21. 22. Acts 15. 1, 2.
Romans 14, 1. and 15. 1, 2, 3
obedience of the Gospel of Christ, none are to separate for faults and
corruptions (for as long as the Church consists of men subject to failings,
there will be difference in the true constituted Church) until they have in
due order, and tenderness, sought redress thereof.

XLVII.
And although the particular Congregations be distinct and several 1 Cor. 4.
17. and 14. 33. 36. and 16. 1.
bodies, every one as a compact and knit Psalm. 132. 3. Ephesians. 2. 12. 19 with
Rev. 21.
City within it self; yet are they all to walk by 1 Timothy 3. 15. and 6. 13,
14. 1 Cor. 4. 17.
one rule of truth; So also they (by all means convenient) are to have the
counsel and help Act. 15. 2, 3. Cant. 8. 8, 9. 2 Cor. 8. 1. 4. 13, 14.
one of another, if necessity require it, as members of one body, in the
common faith, under Christ their head.

XLVIII.
A civil Romans 13. 1, 2, 3, 4. 1 Pet. 2. 13. 14 1 Timothy 2. 1, 2, 3. The supreme
Magistracy of this Kingdom we acknowledge to be the King and Parliament (now
established) freely chosen by the Kingdom, and that we are to maintain and
defend all civil Laws and civil Officers made by them, which are for the
good of the Commonwealth: and we acknowledge with thankfulness that God has
made this present King and Parliament honorable in throwing down the
Prelaticall Hierarchy, because of their tyranny and oppression over us, under
which this Kingdom long groaned, for which we are ever engaged to bless God,
and honor them for the same: and concerning the worship of God; there is but
one Lawgiver, which is able to save and destroy, James 4. 12. which is Jesus
Christ, who has given Laws and Rules sufficient in his Word for his worship;
and for any to make more, were to charge Christ with want of wisdom, or
faithfulness, or both, in not making Laws enough, or not good enough for his
house: surely it is our wisdom, duty, and privilege, to observe Christ's
Laws only, Psalm. 2. 6. 9, 10, 12. so it is the Magistrates duty to tender
the liberty of men's consciences, Eccl. 8. 8. (which is the tenderest thing
unto all conscientious men and most dear unto them, and without which all other
liberties will not be worth the naming, much less enjoying) and to protect all
under them from all wrong, injury, oppression and molestation; so its our duty
not to be wanting in nothing which is for their honor and comfort and
whatsoever is for the well-being of the Commonwealth wherein we live; it is
our duty to do, and we believe it to be our express duty, especially in
matters of Religion, to be fully persuaded in our minds of the Lawfulness of
what we do, as knowing whatsoever is not of faith is sin: and as we cannot
do any thing contrary to our understandings and consciences, so neither can we
forbear the doing of that which our understandings and consciences bind us to
do: and if the Magistrate should require us to do otherwise, we are to yield
our persons in a passive way to their power, as the Saints of old have done,
Jam. 5. 4. And thrice happy shall he be, that shall lose his life for
witnessing (though but for the least tittle) of the truth of the Lord Jesus
Christ, 1 Pet. 5. Gal 5.
Magistracy is an Ordinance of God, set up by him for the punishment of evil
doers, and for the praise of them that do well; and that in all lawful
things, commanded by them, subjection ought to be given by us in the Lord, not
only for wrath, but for conscience sake; and that we are to make supplications
and prayers for Kings, and all that are in authority, that under them we may
live a quiet and peaceable life, in all godliness and honesty.

XLIX.
But in case we find not the Magistrate to favor us herein; Act. 2. 40, 41
and 4. 19. and 5. 28, 29. 41 and 20. 23. 1 These. 3. 3. Phil. 1. 28, 29. Dan 3.
16, 17. and 6. 7. 10. 22, 23.
yet we dare not suspend our practice, because we believe we ought to go on
in obedience to Christ, in professing the faith which was once delivered to the
Saints, which faith is declared in the holy Scriptures, and this our confession
of faith a part of them, and that we are to witness to the truth of the old
and new Testament unto the death, if necessity require, in the midst of all
trials and afflictions, as his Saints of old have done; not accounting our
goods, lands, wives, children, fathers, mothers, brethren, sisters; yea, and
our own lives dear unto us, so we may finish our course with joy, remembering
always, that we ought to 1 Timothy 6. 13, 14, 15. Romans 12. 1. 8. 1 Cor. 14. 37.
obey God rather then men, who will when we have finished our course, and kept
the faith, give us Rev. 2. 20.
the Crown of righteousness; to 2 Timothy 4. 6, 7, 8. Romans 14. 10. 12. 2 Cor. 5.
10. Psalm. 49. 7. Psalm. 50. 22.
whom we must give an account of all our actions, and no man being able to
discharge us of the same.

L.
It is lawful for a Christian to be a Magistrate or Civil Acts 8. 38. and 10.
1, 2. 35. 44. Romans 16. 23. Deuteronomy. 6. 13. Romans 1. 9. 2 Cor. 10. 11. Jer. 4. 2.
Heb. 6. 16.
Officer; and also it is lawful to take an Oath, so it be in truth, and in
judgment, and in righteousness, for confirmation of truth, and ending of all
strife; and that by rash and vain Oaths the Lord is provoked, and this Land
mournes.

LI.
We are to give unto all men, whatsoever is their 1 These. 4. 6. Romans 13. 5, 6,
7 Mat. 22. 21. Tit. 3. 1 Pet. 2. 15. 17. and 5. 5. Ephesians. 5. 21. 23. and 6. 1. 9.
Tit. 3. 1, 2, 3.
due, as their place, age, estate requires; and that we defraud no man of any
thing, but to do unto all men, as we would they should do unto us.

LII.
There shall be a Acts 24. 15.
resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust, and every one shall
give an account of himself to God, that every one may receive the things 2
Cor. 5. 10.
done in his body, according to that he has done, whether Romans 14. 12.
it be good or bad.

The Conclusion.
THus we desire to give unto Christ that which is his, and unto all lawful
Authority that which is their due, and to owe nothing to any man but love, to
live quietly and peaceably, as it becomes Saints, endeavoring in all things
to keep a good conscience, and to do unto every man (of what judgment soever)
as we would they should do unto us, that as our practice is, so it may prove
us to be a conscionable, quiet, and barmlesse people, (no ways dangerous or
troublesome to humane Society) and to labor and work with our hands that we
may not be chargeable to any, but to give to him that needs both friends and
enemies, accounting it more excellent to give then to receive. Also we confess
that we know but in part, and that we are ignorant of many things which we
desire and seek to know: and if any shall do us that friendly part to show us
from the word of God that we see not, we shall have cause to be thankful to
God and them. But if any man shall impose upon us any thing that we see not to
be commanded by our Lord Jesus Christ, we should in his strength rather embrace
all reproaches and tortures of men, to be stripped of all outward comforts, and
if it were possible, to die a thousand deaths, rather then to do any thing
against the least tittle of the truth of God, or against the light of our own
consciences. And if any shall call what we have said Heresy, then do we with
the Apostle acknowledge, that after the way they call heresy, worship we the
God of our Fathers, disclaiming all Heresies (rightly so called) because they
are against Christ, and to be steadfast and immovable, always abounding in
obedience to Christ, as knowing our labor shall not be in vain in the Lord.

PSALM. 74. 21, 22. Arise, O God, plead thine own cause; Remember how the
foolish man blasphemeth thee daily.

O let not the oppressed return ashamed, but let the poor and needy praise
thy Name.


Come Lord Jesus, come quickly.
