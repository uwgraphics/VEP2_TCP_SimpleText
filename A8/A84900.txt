A PROCLAMATION BY His Excellency the Lord General, concerning FREE QUARTER.
WHereas Information is given, that several persons, not Soldiers, do pretend
themselves to be Soldiers, and produce counterfeit Passes and Tickets for
Quarter, and take Free Quarter where ever they come, to the great injury of the
Nation, and dishonor of the Army, (it being the desire and endeavor of the
Army, that Free Quarter be speedily taken off in all places;) for remedy
whereof, all Soldiers are hereby required not to march from their Colors, and
take Free Quarter without a Commission-Officer, and the Commission-Officer is
not to require Free Quarter upon any Ticket or pretense whatsoever, until he
have first showed his Commission for his place as an Officer in the Army, and
given his name and the names of his Soldiers under his Conduct: And if any
shall contrary hereunto offend, the Civil Officers are desired to secure their
persons, till such course be taken, as to the merit of their offenses shall be
thought fit by a Court-Martiall.

Given under my Hand and Seal in Queens-street the 20. day of February, 1648.
T. FAIRFAX.

Imprimatur.
