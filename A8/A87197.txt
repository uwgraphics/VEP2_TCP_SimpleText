DIRECTIONS TO KNOW where any Town you desire to find out lies in the Mapp
immediately.
IF you desire to find out in the Mapp, the Town of Knockfergus I look in
the Alphabet, and I find the Town, and finding the Town, I see in the Book,
it lies in longitude 16. degrees, and 24. minutes in latitude, 54. degrees, and
36. minutes: bring with one of your fingers a strait line from the degree and
minutes of the longitude, and with another of your fingers, a strait line from
the degree and minutes of the latitude till these two lines meet in a square,
and there you shall see the Town of Knockfergus: this is a rule for all other
Towns that you desire to know where they lie in the Mapp.

Directions to find the distance from one Town to the other in the Map.
IF you would know how far Dublin is from Knockfergus, take a pair of
Compasses, and put them to the Scale of Miles at the foot of the Mapp, extend
them as long as the Scale is, which is 40 miles: every black, and every white
being a mile: Then measure from the Town of Knockfergus to the City of Dublin,
and so many times as it is the length of the Scale, so many times 40 miles it
is from one Town to the other: Or if you would see any other Town that is not
so much as 40 miles distant from Dublin, then take the measure from Dublin to
the Town you would know, and then set your Compasses to the Scale of miles,
and you shall see how many miles it is by the Compass, counting every black a
mile, and every white a mile, and that is the distance: by this you may know
the distance of any one Town to another.

If you would know by the Book what Province any Town you look for is in: the
name of the Province is set down by the Town in the Book.

How to know the longitude, and the latitude, and the degrees, and the minutes.
ON the top of the Mapp of Ireland, you shall find written longitude, and on
the side of the Mapp of Ireland, you shall find written latitude, the degrees
are marked with figures, the minutes are the black and the white: that you see
every black is 4. minutes, and so is a white; at every twentieth minute there
is a small stroke: there is three of them small strokes between every degree,
which is 60 minutes, which makes a degree, every black and white being 4.
minutes.

IRELAND.
IRELAND is situate under the tenth and twelfth climates: The longest day being
16. hours and more: It stands to the west of Britain, being of length from
South to North near four hundred miles, and in breadth two hundred miles: the
most usual name amongst writers is Jernia, ^he modern Hibernia, the English
Ireland, the Inhabitants Eryn-land, which in their language signifies Western
land: It is environed on all sides with the sea, having on the South part the
Virginian sea; on the west, the main western Ocean; on the North, the
Deucalidonian sea; and on the East, the Irish sea, which divides England and
Scotland from Ireland.

This Island or the soil, it is full of mountains, hills, woods, bogs and
lakes, but abundantly fruitful, as may be seen where the industry of man
plays the Midwife with the Earth, in helping her to bring forth.

It nourishes no venomous beasts, so that a man may sleep securely under a
hedge, and in the open field upon the ground: All the breed thereof except
women and gray-hounds, are lesser then in England.

The native people are generally strong, and nimble of body, careless of their
lives, patient of cold and hunger, implacable, in enmity, savage, cruel,
treacherous and superstitious, easily adicted, and extremely laborious,
especially those commonly called the Kernes or wild Irish; but such as are
bred with the English and Scots are more civilized.

Since the first plantation there, of our English, the people have been
governed by a Vice Roy, who we usually call the Lord Deputy, to whom there
comes no Vice Roy in Europe more near the M jestie and Prerogative of a King.

Ireland is divided into four Provinces, 1. Munster. 2. Connaght. 3. Vlster.
4. Lemster.
and these into 32. Counties.

The Metropolis of Ireland is Dublin, seated on the hiffe in Lemster, wherein
is an Vniversirie: This City after the English conquest was people by a Colony
of our Bristoll men.

THE BLOODY ATTEMPTS Upon the Kingdom of IRELAND in general, and on DUBLIN in
particular; and how it first began.
UPon the three and twentieth day of October 1641. the Castle of Dublin should
have been surprised, (as at that time it might easily have been) for there was
no fear or suspicion of Treachery, there being at that time 400. Irish Papists
elected out of most parts of Ireland, desperate persons, designed and appointed
for that bloody and desperate attempt, all lodging and sculking in several
places of the City and Suburbs, waiting and expecting the time and watchword,
when to give the onset. One of their own Countrymen at that time, abhorring so
foul and detestable a Treason, revealed it to Sir William Parsons Knight and
Baronet, Master of the Court of Wards and Liveries, and Sir John Borlase
Knight, Master of the Ordnance, both Lords Justices of the Kingdom of Ireland.
The party who discovered the plot, had been formerly a servant to Sir John
Clotworthy, but at the time when he revealed their design, he served one Capt.
Mack-Mahowne an Irishman, who lodged at the sign of the artichoak, vulgarly
called S. Mary's Abbey in the suburbs of the City of Dublin, The servants name
was Owen Mack-Connel, who being with his master Capt. Mack-Mahown, in a house
in Cookstreet, at the lodging of the Lord Mack-Gueere, also an Irishman in the
City of Dublin. Upon the two and twentieth of October. being the night before:
his master did then and there reveal the whole plot unto him in the presence of
the Lord Mack-Gueere, and others.

This Owen Mack-Connel had married an English woman, by whom he had children
living in the County of Antrim, in the Province of Vlster, and she was and is a
Protestant; as soon as Owen Mack Connel had heard and understood the plot, and
their damnable intentions, with a sad countenance asked his Master what should
become of his wife and poor children, he replied in these words: hang her
English Kite, we will get thee a better Wife: But the Company perceiving that
his thoughts were troubled at the relation of this horrid Tragedy, now to be
acted on the stage of Ireland, that within few hours was to be in a flame of
confusion, the word to be given, that, man, woman, and child should have been
butchered the next morning: the poor man's heart failed him at this hellish and
barbarous massacre, whereupon these bloody Villains, perceiving by the
alteration of his countenance that he approved not, or rather, like a man
amazed, startled at such a bloody motion, as to imbrue his hands of his own
dearest wife and children, and that that is more, of his own Country and
Kingdom, they began to bethink themselves what to do with him; they resolved to
make him drunk, and thereupon enforced him unnaturally, to drink so much that
he could hardly drink more, yet they plied him close, he desired to be excused,
they to give him his load powered it down his throat, he resisting such
unreasonable violence, there steps toward him one Donal Mack-Gueere, saying,
will you not drink your liquor, see if you dare deny to pledge me? thereupon
set a pistol to his breast with two bullets, the pan being primed with powder
and brimstone, that so it might not fail to speed, twice it was offered against
him, and took no fire, whereupon Capt. Mack-Mahown stepped in and said, let him
alone, God will not suffer him to be killed, he will be on our side I warrant
ye. They afterward led him from the lord Mack-Gueers lodging to Capt.
Mack-Mahowns lodging, but the poor man, faining himself more drunk then he was,
and taking the advantage of the time and place, willingly fell down in a dirty
channel, and was so bemired with mud, that none would help him up, but with
much ado he crept out of the kennel, and reeled to the stoop of a door, and
sat down to sleep, he seeming to sleep, the fellow which was left with him to
watch with him, departed, which this Owen Mack-Connel perceiving, as soon as
ever his back was turned, with a bold resolution arose up, and went to the
Merchants key in Dublin, between eleven and twelve of the clock at night to Sir
William Parsons house, one of the Lord Justices of Ireland, where knocking at
the door, the Porter knowing him, demanded of him what he would have, he
answered he must needs speak with his Lord, the Porter replied his Lord was in
bed, It is no matter answered Owen Mack-Connel, I must and will speak with him,
for my business concerns both King and Kingdom; then the Porter let him in,
wondering to see him in such a pickle, still he hastened the porter, until he
had called up one of his Lords Gentlemen, who got up speedily, and went into
his Lords bedchamber, where he acquainted his Lord with the earnest desire
this Owen Mack-Connel had to speak with him concerning a business of weighty
consequence, but would not reveal it to any but his Honor, whereupon he was
called up and had access to my Lord, unto whom he discovered the whole plot,
which was to be executed the same morning at 9. of the clock, this being
between twelve and one.

At the first the Lord Parsons did seem to slight it, but Owen Mack-Connel
confidently affirmed the thing to be true, and withal told him thus, my lord I
have discharged my duty and my conscience, look you to it; I will go back to my
master, because neither he, nor the rest shall suspect me.

Owen Macke-onell, who discovered the plot of taking Dublin, had a Pistol
Charaed with too Bullets the pane primed with powder and Brimstone twice
offered against him took not fire, so the Rebels said God will not suffer him
to be killed and he will be on our side I warrant you,

Your Lordship shall find my lord Mack-Gueere at M. Cadowgans house, and Capt.
Mack-Mahowne at the Artichoak, whither I now go. This Owen Mack-Connel going
to his masters lodging, takes dirt in his hands, and besmuts his face, that
they might think he had tumbled over and over in the dirt: whose approach into
the room (where many were assembled together, drinking; for they intended not
to go to bed) was so ridiculous, that the company burst out into such a
laughter, the place rung of them round about: and to welcome him home, the
company fell to their old course, to make him drink more, but he told them that
he must needs go into the yard, so they suffered him but commanded two of his
companions to attend him, and bring him up again, but they let him go into the
yard by himself: no sooner was he in the yard, but he leaped over the pale, and
so escaped.

A true Description of sundry sad and lamentable Collections, taken from the
months of very credible Persons, and out of Letters sent from Ireland to this
City of London, of the perfidious outrages and barbarous cruelties which the
Irish Papists have committed upon the persons of the Protestants, both men,
women, and children in that Kingdom, since Anno Dom. 1641.
THe Irish nation is a people both proud and envious. The Commonaltie ignorant
and illiterate, poor, and lazy: and will rather beg or starve, then work; and
therefore fit subject for the Priests and Jesuits to spur on upon such bloody
actions and murtherous designs.

It is too well known that the Irish have murdered of the Protestant party in
the provinces of Vlster, Leinster, Connaght, and Munster, of men women, and
children, the number of fifty thousand, as it is credibly reported by
Englishmen, who have been over all parts of the Kingdom, and do protest upon
their oaths, that there are above five thousand families destroyed.

The Irish have most murtherously and traitorously surprised them upon great
advantages, and without respect of persons, either of age, youth, or infancy,
of young men or maids, or of old men or babes, stripped all to their skins, naked
as ever they were born into the World, so they have gone out of the World, many
starved to death for want of food and raiment; the Irish have showed them no
more compassion, nor so much as they do to their dogs.

At Belturbait in the County of Cavan, the Popish Rebels demanded the Town, on
promise that if they would surrender, they should pass free with bag and
baggage: On serious considerations of the inhabitants and the Governor, they
were persuaded to yield it up, which when they had done; they sent about twenty
or thirty to guard them; when they had guarded them seven miles from the Town,
they seized on them, robbed all the Protestants, being between five hundred and
a thousand persons, men, women, and children: who submitting themselves to
their mercy, found no quarter but cruelty: they stripped them all naked, and
turned them into the open fields in bitter cold weather, not affording them one
of their lowzy rags to hide those parts which even nature commands to be
covered.

In Londonderry, belonging to the Londoners, Sir Philem Oneal promised under
hand and seal to let the poor Protestants pass with bag and baggage, only to
part with their Town: yet this At one Mr Atkins house and Papists brake in and
beat out his brains, then riped upe his wife with Child after they had

The Lord Macquires brother at the beginning of the rebellion, for the first
fortnight commands his soldiers to give quarter to women and children, but to
massacre all the men.

The Handlowans came to Tom-regis, diverse of them assaulted the Castle, of
which Captain Saint John was Commander, he with his son got away with some
difficulty, leaping over the wall, they fearing they might fetch some supplies,
took the Captains wife, and set her on the wall, having stripped her to her
smock, who was big with child, and within an hour of her deliverie, that in
case the Captain and his son should have assaulted the Town, his wife should
have been the white at which he must have levelled.

M. Trafford a minister, was assaulted by these bloody wolves, who desired but
to call upon God, yet they would admit no time, but fell on him, and hackt him
to pieces.

Sir Patrick Dunstons wife ravished before him: they slew his servants, spurned

One M. Luttrell was basely betrayed by an Irish boy that he had bred up in his
house: who when he was at dinner, was surprised by threescore o^ those Irish
unmercifull villains, with a company of whores and bastards that followed them
which this boy let in at a back door, where pulling him and his wife from the
Table, and fou^ small children, and one sucking at her breast: stripped them
naked, and then thrusting them in a violent manner out of doors, threatened to
kill them if they went not speedily away. So they departed, being ashamed to be
seen of their servants, toward Dublin, hoping to find some o^ their friends in
the way to relieve them, but the farther they came, the more miserable they
were, meeting their loving friends robbed (by others) in the same manner, which
struck in them such amazement and fear, that their hearts failed them, so that
being naked and hungry, helpless and hopeless, the poor Infants crying in
their ears, they sat down under a hedge and died: The same day some Horsemen
riding that way to coast the Country, met this youth, unto whom he told this
sad story, and led them to this lamentable sight, where they beheld the true
love of man and wife, embracing each other in their death: the three eldest
children dead, but the sucking Pulling them about the streets by the hair of

In the County of Roscommon, there fled into the parish Church eleven score of
the English, men, women, and children, where they remained three days and
nights without any sustenance, till they were almost starved: so that at last
they were forced to commit themselves to the cruelty of the Irish, who stripped
them naked, after drove them through the Town like so many harmless Lambs
over a Bridge at the Towns end, having before broke down one of the middle
arches, where a strong water runs, so that either they must leap in, or come
back, their intent being there to murder them, as they did: For the poor
wretches being sick, weak and faint for food and sleep, some returned back,
whom they killed without mercy, others they thrust into the water, who were
drowned: some that could, did swim toward the shore, and there, inhumane
villains, they ran and met them before they could get to land, and knocked them
on the head in the water.

In the County of Tyrone was the cruellest murder of all the rest, committed
by some Soldiers upon the bodies of one M. Charles Davenant, his wife, and two
young children. The villain which first entered the house was known to one of
the servants in the house, to be commonly called Thady O Swyllivane, sometime a
servant to this M. Davenant, and lived not far from Dungannon, in the County of
Tyrone. The servant that knew him could speak good Irish, and so escaped, being
an eyewitness of these passages ensuing. This Swillyrane and his rout broke
in forcibly into the house, where they found M. Davenant with his wife and
children, they immediately seized upon him and his wife, and bound them both
fast in their chaires, making a great fire, after they stripped the two
children, slew them in the sight of their parents, and after roasted them upon
spits before their faces, they were compelled (poor souls) to behold that
cruelty which they could not help: after they stripped his wife, forcing her most
uncivilly and unmercifully before his face: and afterward cut her throat: the
distressed Gentleman being over pressed with the lamentable sight of the death
of his wife and children, strived and strugled in his chair where he was bound,
hoping they would have killed him, choosing rather to die any death, then to live
any longer. So when (...) had made an end of his wife and children, the Lord
Blany forced to ride 14 Miles without Bridle or Sadell to save his life, his
Lady Lodged in Straw being allowed 2^ a day to releue her and her Children,
slew a kindsman of hers and hanged him up before her face 2 days telling her
she must expect the same, to terrify her the mere.

At the Borough of Kello, the Rebels surprised the house of one Arthur
Robinson, he himself being at that time in Dublin, he not knowing that the
Rebels were risen in those parts there, intending to have gone home to his wife
and family, before his appointed time to return home, a Messenger prevented him
with heavy tidings, even his only Daughter, whom he quickly knew, though she
were much disguized, for the Rebels had slain most of his family, robbed and
pillaged the house, after they had stripped his wife and ravished her, they
sought out for this young Virgin, who had hid her self in a barn, where the
Villanes found her; but she made what resistance she could, and with a knife
she had (unseene to them) wounded one of them, which the rest perceiving,
seized upon her violently, stripped her, and then bound her with her arms
abroad, in such manner as she could not help her self any way, and so
destoured her one after another, pulled the hair from her head, and cut out her
tongue, because she should not report the truth and their cruelty, but the
maid could write though she could not speak, and so discovered their inhumane
usage to her and her mother. The maid was sent with a letter from her father in
Dublin, to her uncle at Mynhead in Somersetshire.

In the County of Fermannagh, Mr Champion was betrayed by an Irish Villain
(his Tenant) whom he had saved twice before from the gallows: the rogues name
was Patrick Mack-Dermot, who finding one of his Companions, brings him to
Master Champion's house, and tells Mr Champion that he found this thief
stealing of his cattle: the Gentleman knowing this Mack-Dermot, said unto him
before one Mr Iremonger, I am glad thou art turned from a thief to catch a
thief; whereupon he returned him this answer, that He was no more thief than
himself. No sooner had he uttered these words in the Court, before his house,
but there rushes in upon them a great number of rebels, who stabd Mr Champion
before he could get into his house: but their fury went further, for they
wounded him with their Skeins in thirty places after he was dead, and then cut
off his head while the rest ran into the house after Mr Iremonger, they fell
upon him, and ran him through: Then the Rebels entered the house, and killed
more, his wife's sister and her brother in law; his wife was down on her knees
to beg a sheet, to put her husbands dead body in. And other friends that came
to visit him, lost their lives.

In the County of Monaghan, one Master George Foorde, a great company having
gotten into a loft over a stable, when he with his wife and Family were gone
to Church, hid themselves till they The Priests and Jesuits anointe the

intaglio print of two men with swords and a corpse came home, watching their
opportunity, first se^ upon him without any words, and then entered the house,
bound all the servants, till they had found Mistress Foord, whom they stripped
naked, and bound, taking from her her keys, having also her husbands keys, and
opened every Trunk and Box in the house to find their money, where they sound
but little to that they looked for; wherefore they began with threats to kill
her, if she did not tell them, but alas she could not, then they fell a
torturing her, heating a pair of Tongues in the fire, and clapping them to the
soles of her feet, and palms of her hands, so that with the pain thereof she
d^^^. After she was dead, they ripped her body to see if she had not swallowed
any gold into her guts; and so when they had pillaged the house, and carried
away with the Horses and Carts, all that was worth the carriage, they unbound
the Irish servants, (which they before had bound) and murdered such of the
English as they pleased, and then departed.

They have set up Gallows five miles distant in diverse places, on purpose to
hang up the Protestant Spies: they ^ave likewise set women and men on red hot
Gridirons to make them confess the money and goods they had, or whether they
have hid or sold any.

They have cut off men's privy members, and stopped their mouths with them, that
they might Mr: FFordes house rifled, and to make her Confess where her money
lay they took hot tongues clappinge them to the Souls of her feet and to the
Palms of her hands so tormented her that with the pain thereof she died,

These bloody Papists forced the Protestants to pull off their clothes, and
then killed them, on purpose, that they might have their clothes without holes.

They have forced (as is reported) some to turn to their cursed bloody
Religion, and then persuaded them that they were fittest to die, and then
treacherously kill their bodies, and do what in them lies to kill their souls.

Others they have wounded to death, and then left them languishing, their
bellies being ripped up and guts issuing out.

An Irish Rebel (as a credible friend reports) snatched an innocent babe out of
the arms of the mother, and cast it into the fire before her face, but God met
with this bloody wretch: for before he went from that place, he brake his neck.

Another, Rory Macqueere, who came into an English Gentleman's house, and found
him in his bed, and there began to cruciate and torture his naked body to make
him confess where his treasure lay, which when this poor distracted Gentleman
acknowledged, they cruelly killed him, and then stripped his wife naked, and
turned her out of doors, took his daughter and satisfied his beastly lust on
her, deflouring her, cut off her garments by the middle, and then turned her to
the mercy of the common Soldiers, to be abused at their pleasure.

The Protestant Troopers marched out of Dublin, to view the Coasts, they espied
a Rebel hewing a woman in so horrid a manner that it was not possible to know
her, having acted his Devilish part, he triumphed over the dead corpse, and
washed his hands in her blood, whereupon the Troopers apprehended this
barbarous villain in the very act of cruelty, and brought him to Dublin with
his hands all bloody, and was adjudged to be hanged immediately, he ascended
the Ladder, and would not stay till the Executioner turned him off, but
desparately leapt off and hanged himself.

These Villains take children and toss them with pitchforks like dung into
Rivers: one was an eye witness who saw a cruel wretch, throw a woman crying
with tears one way, and he^ Child with a pitchfork another way.

They have cruelly murdered women great with child, and then left them in
ditches, to the fury of their dogs, who have eaten the children out of the
bowels of the mother.

They inslave poor protestants under them, making them work like horses all
day, digging and delving for them, and then are shut up all night, not knowing
what wages, whether life or A Woman mangled in so horred a man^er that it was

A Minister seeing his wife abused, and his children roasted, desired them to
put him out of his extremity of anguish, to see such cruelty on those so near
him, they most inhumanely cut his tongue out of his head.

Seventeen of those barbarous monsters came to a Ministers house, where they
violently fell on him and his wife, stripped them naked, bound them back to back,
then cut off his privy members, afterward ravished his wife on his back, and
then inhumanely cut their throats.

Women were delivered whiles they were hanging. One ripped up, and two children
taken away and all cast unto, and eaten by swine. Another stabbed in the
breast, her child sucking.

They forced 40. or 50. Protestants to renounce their profession, and then cut
all their throats.

Christians have been eaten by Dogs, and Dogs tearing children out of the womb;
the bloody beholders relate such things with boasting. Two were said to be
buried alive, and others that had been long buried dug up; they saying that
the Church could not be consecrated whiles Heretics bones lay therein. And in
the Church of Newtown was a child boiled alive in a Caldron.

Diverse women and children murdered, lying George Forde, hanged on a tree in

The rebels met with a Protestant Minister at Kells, by name Mr Sharp, who
had three children, two of them on his back, and did most barbarously hack, cut
in pieces, and murder him, thrusting into his body three o^ four pikes
together, and then threw him into a ditch of water, where they left him.

Captain Bryan mac Mahon, of Tehollan, said, he would hang any that could
speak English: And a Priest said that all the English must be hanged, and being
asked why, he said, meat was scarce, and they would not be at the charge to
keep them.
