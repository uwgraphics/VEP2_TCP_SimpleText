A seasonable Letter of Advice delivered to the Major of London; as He was
sitting at Common Council at Guild Hall, on Tuesday the 27. of December, and
by Him read on the Bench.
Right Honorable,
YOur very good friends here present understand by some Members of your
Council, that you have many difficulties to wrestle with, which are cast in
amongst you by ill-affected Members to the peace of this Nation. Your
Adversaries will grow upon you by your delays. The eyes of the Nation are upon
you. Glory or shame will be your potion. Your Authority has the only lawful
stamp; all others are but pretenders: Resolution and Expedition are the Mothers
of glorious actions. Sir, you are more nearly concerned in this glorious work
then any other person. If by delays the work succeeds not, I dare assure you
the fury of the People will unavoidable fall upon you: but I hope your good
Example will prevent the ill consequence of it. The pretended Authority fear
your Council; but their only hope is, you may as easily be misled by them, as
you were caught by that silly Gull Fleetwood, by the pretense of a free
Parliament. Verbum sapienti.

Your humble Servant and Wellwisher C. D.
