An Exact Relation of the Proceedings of the CAVALEERS at CICESTER.
PRince Ruperts Scouts, upon the tenth of this instant February, approached
near the Town of Cicester in the County of Gloucester, and news was brought to
the Town, that Prince Rupert himself, Prince Mawrice, the Earl of Carnarvon,
the Earl of Northampton, the Lord Digby, and diverse other great Commanders,
with about seven thousand horse and foot, were marching toward Cicester with
an intent to make an attempt against it, which Town at that time, was not in so
good a posture of defense as formerly it had been, for that part of their
forces were about Malmesbury and other places, which was occasioned by a late
assault which was made against Shudly-Castle by the Gloucestershire forces,
where they took the Lord Shandoys and three hundred men prisoners with their
Arms and Ammunition, so that there was in Cicester at this time, but eleven
hundred men, and five small Pieces of Ordnance. This day there was but little
done, only three or four of Prince Ruperts Scouts were taken Prisoners and
carried into the Town, but the next day Prince Rupert having brought all his
forces together before the Town, began to make an assault against it, whereupon
the Townsmen perceiving the great strength that was against them, presently
sent to Gloucester, desiring some aid and assistance from thence, and in the
mean time, they resolved to oppose the Enemies forces, which was valiantly
performed by them, insomuch that the Enemy could make no entrance all that day,
although they played very fiercely against the Town with their Ordnance, and at
last, whilst the Ordnance were playing against one end of the Town, Prince
RVPERT with a party of Horse, advanced to the other end, and made an assault
against it, shooting Grenades to set on fire Barnes and thatched houses, which
were at that end, and fired some of them, amongst which was a Stack of Hay, the
smoke of which fire, by reason of the Wind carrying it into the Town, did so
much annoy the inhabitants of the Town, that they could hardly see one another,
and knew not which way to turn them, and and thereupon were suddenly surprised
by the Cavaleers, who at their first entrance laid about them in that inhumain
manner, it would grieve the hardest heart to think of, for they spared neither
woman nor child that they met withal, and most cruelly murdered a godly
Divine and his whole Family, and after quarter was granted, those men which
escaped with their lives, were miserably tortured, and us^d with worse cruelty
then death, for they were stripped naked and dragged up and down the street,
terrifying them with most heavy oaths, and curses, holding their naked swords
and Pistols to their breasts, and at last drove them i^to the Church, where
they were kept in that naked and miserable condition, four and twenty hours
together, without either bread or water, there being (as it is reported) about
a thousand of them, which cruelties are hardly to be paraleld by any stories in
our English Chronicles.

Before I pass any further, I should relate the number of such persons as were
slain on both sides, but in this particular I shall crave favor to be excused,
if I do not so exactly relate the very certainty thereof, it being a thing of
more then ordinary difficulty, to give a true definition thereof, but herein I
must refer my self to the general brute of the people, which in all
probability does not much vary from the truth, who say that before the
Cavaleers en^red the Town, the inhabitants lost not above two hundred men, but
the enemy lost about fifteen hundred.

The prisoners which were taken by the Cavaleers, were pinioned and coupled
together, and driven like Cattle to Oxford, without shoes or stockins, or hats
to keep their bare heads from the weather, many of them (as it is ^eported)
being glad to make hard shift for a piece of Mat or Straw to tie about them, to
cover their nakedness, and and at their coming near unto Oxford, news being
brought to the town of their near approach, a great number of people came out
to meet them, the prisoners being tied together with Cords and Match, though
most of them were of very good worth and quality, and two of them Ministers,
which were in the like manner drawn through the dirt and mire, and so were all
carried into the Town and imprisoned in two several Churches, and kept there
all night, not being allowed either fire, bread, or water: whereupon a poor
woman perceiving the miserable condition of these poor distressed prisoners,
and hearing their lamentable complaint and cry for water, went to fetch them
some, but being seen she was beaten by a Cavaleer; yet the poor woman being
inwardly moved with these men's miseries, said she would fetch them water,
though she were hanged for it. Some of them that were taken at Cicester, and
thus carried to Oxford, by reason of their cruel usage, and the wounds they
had received, not having any means to recover them, nor any Surgeon to come
at them, are since dead.

After they had been thus imprisoned all night in the Churches, the next day
they had an Oath tendered unto them, which was as follows, viz.

The Oath administered unto all those who were taken Prisoners ly the Cavaleers
at Chichester.
I A. B. resting fully assured of His Majesty's Princely truth and goodness,
do freely and from my heart, promise, vow, and protest, in the presence of
Almighty God, that I will, to the utmost of my power, and with the hazard of my
life, maintain and defend the true Protestant Religion, established in the
Church of England, His Majesty's sacred Person, his Highness, and lawful
successors, His Majesty's just power and privilege, and the just power and
privilege of Parliament, against the Forces under the Conduct of the Earl of
Essex, and against all other Forces whatsoever, contrary to His Majesty's
command. I do believe that the raising and employing of forces by His Majesty
for the purposes and causes before mentioned, to be most just and necessary,
and I will do my utmost endeavor to procure and re-establish the peace and the
quiet of the Kingdom, and that herein all His Majesty's Subjects may fully
enjoy their liberty and property according to the law of the land; and I will
neither divulge or communicate any thing to the said Earl of Essex his
Officers, or to any other to hinder or prejudice the designs of His Majesty
in the conduct and employment of His army: and I do believe that the Subjects
of England are not obliged by any act of State, Vote, Ordinance, or
Declaration, made or to be made, either by the Kings Majesty solely, or by the
Lords and Commons singly, or jointly, without his Majesty's express consent
(saving such as have or shall be in execution, of or according to some known
Law-custome of the Realm, or Statute enacted by the King, or Lords and Commons
in Parliament:) and J do further protest and vow in the presence of Almighty
God, that I will not take or bear arms, but by express warrant of His
Majesty, or by authority justly derived from His Majesty's immediate warrant.

A Great part of the business in Parliament the last week, was concerning the
propositions lately sent from his Majesty to the Parliament concerning a
treaty, and perticulerly about a Cessation of Arms; and the House of Commons
conceving it unsafe and a matter of dangerous consequence to the Kingdom, that
there should be a cessation of arms only during the treaty, after long debate
of the business (their being about 200 persons in the House) it being put to
the Question it was carried by the Major voices, that there should be an utter
disbanding of all forces, both by the King and Parl. which if his Maj. will
graciously be pleased to agree unto, the Parl. will make choice of fit and able
persons for the managing of the treaty with those which shall be chosen by his
Majesty, and in the mean time, until things are further agreed upon, they
will be ready to propound such a way to give his Majesty satisfaction concrening
the propositions made by his Majesty, touching his Forts, Castles, and Navy, as
shall be reasonable, and with safety to the Kingdom.

FINIS.
