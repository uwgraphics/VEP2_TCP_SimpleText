THE HVMBLE MANIFEST OF Sir JOB HARBY Knight. IN April. 1650.

LONDON, Printed in the year. 1650

The manifest of Sir Job Harby Knight, unto all persons, of Honor, who are
piously inclined to hear, and Commiserate the oppressed, and especially unto
those patient Creditors, who did formerly lend their moneys, upon the security
of Sir Abraham Dawes, Sir John Jacob, Sir Nicholas Crispe, Sir John Nulls, and
himself; when he, was unfortunately, made one of the farmers of the customs
for three years, and did enjoy them only two of the said three years, they
being forced to relinquish the third year before they had paid back those
moneys, which were taken up at interest for that service, and for the payment
of their fine to the Parliament.

THe publisher of this ensuing remonstrance, does desire, that it may not seem
impertinent, nor displeasing unto any of you, that one of your debitors does
take the boldness to declare, that he did not come into the customs, with any
sinister intent, nor with the least inclination, to defraud you nor any of you,
but with a constant resolution, to deal justly with you, and with all men; nor
did he foresee such a sudden ruin, to fall upon him, for his receiving those
Customs two years, which himself, as a merchant had paid for 40 years before;
Neither did he after the disaster was unexpectedly fallen upon him, come to
prison (as some persons have most unworthily divulged) to deceive you or any of
you; But did go on paying, as long, as he was able, his full share of such
moneys as were called in; even to the value, of above thirty thousand pounds,
as will appear by the sequel of this (to me) sad story; being out of purse for
the said two years Farms, above eight thousand pounds, more then any of his
before named partners, and that before he submitted his person to imprisonment,
which was in November 1646. when he could no longer enjoy his liberty, unless
he would have dishonestly laid a debt of one thousand pounds with interest upon
his friends that bayled him; for at that very time, when the Execution was laid
upon him singly by Master Squire deceased (being done with the privity; and (as
he believes) at the instance of Sir John Nulls; he sent some friends unto the
said Sir John Nulls, and unto Sir John Jacob, to entreat each of them to pay
one third part of the debt, those friends offering to pay the other third part
for discharge of the said execution: the said Sir John Jacob, and Sir John
Nulls, did both of them positively refuse the same, although they knew, there
was then due unto me from that very account above 8000 pounds all the debts
satisfied; The narrative of which their unjust proceeding with me, I had then
prepared with intent to publish the same, But that I was by some friends
dissuaded, who did rationally advise me rather to suffer for a season, then to
fall out amongst our selves, before we had obtained relief for the great debt
of three hundred thousand and odd pounds, owing unto Sir Paul Pynder and us, by
the late King; for these considerations, and being disabled to recover any part
of mine own means, I have endured imprisonment three years and a half, with
as much hardship scandal, and disgrace, as if the debt had been properly mine
own; But now that the greatest part of my estate is consumed for the payment of
other men's debts; And that I daily undergo suits, and reproaches, and (which is
worst of all) am continually slandered, as one that deteyneth those effects
which should satisfy you, I say, having hitherto smothered my grief, and even
wearied out mine own patience, finding no relief as yet from those above us,
neither justice nor equity amongst my said parners; and being, in all
probability at the brinck of my grave, aged above 70 years; I have thought it
requisite for the vindication of mine own integrity; for the discovering unto
you that are Creditors; upon whom you may justly, and securely lay your debts;
and for the instructing my wife and posterity, what is become of my estate, and
whom to pursue for the same, when I shall be no more; I have, I say, thought
upon this expedient in my plain manner to publish the truth in print; rather
then by Commencing a suite in Law to protract your satisfaction, and to bring
my self to a morsel of bread.

And that you may not conceive that this discourse of mine is undertaken
rashly, or groundlesly, I must crave leave, to acquaint you, that I have used
all the friendly means I could think upon, for the continuance of a right
understanding twixt my sad parners and my self, yea beseeching them (as if I
should have begged for life) to finish the accounts amongst themselves; or to
permit some unconcerned knowing persons to examine them, to the end we might
equally and justly join together, and proportionally satisfy you that are
Creditors to the uttermost of our Abilities; And to this purpose I have
solicited them, not so few as one hundred times; by word of mouth, by letters,
by friends, by strangers, yea even by some of your selves; And at last by
declaring unto them, that I might not (without robbing my self and posterity)
forbear them any longer. But all in vain, nothing will prevail; they are in
possession, And it seems fully bent totally to ruin me and my family, and to
give a mortal wound unto my reputation, which is as dear unto me as my life; I
am farther to beg your patience, to read the historical parts of the most
material passages of our engagements in this (to me) fatal Custom
businesses, as they stand in the register book, and in several accounts, drawn
up by the secretary, book-keepers, and accomptants, some of them having near
relation to the Treasurer, Sir John Nulls; who is and has been the chief cause
you have not been satisfied long since, as you will discern very plainly by the
sequel. For the more clear demonstration, that what I affirm is really and
punctually true; I beseech you observe and weigh, these following particulars.

1. To invite and entice me to join in taking the Customs, there was an
instrument in writing, brought to me, signed by those who made the contract for
the farms, with the late King, (and the Lord Treasurer) wherein I was named to
be the Treasurer, which place if I had supplied; there had not been at this day
one penny owing to any of you; for as soon as the farms were settled upon us, and
that I had advanced twenty thousand eight hundred and odd pounds in ready money
for 7 shares of the said farms, and that the deeds of partnership were signed
and sealed, the Lord Goring, who was the chief undertaker, and had eight shares
of the said farms, addressed himself unto me, to assist him with greater sums
of money, then I was willing to stand engaged for: when I did plainly and
positively refuse him; conceiving that the payment of mine own shares, and the
finding money for the Credible performance of the joint service, would be work
sufficient for such a Treasurer, as intended to deal safely for himself, and
justly with all men, that should lend their moneys; The said Lord Goring taking
ill my refusal, seeks amongst us for one to serve his turn, and at last
prevailed with Mr. Nulls (now Sir John) to promise the said Lord his
assistance, conditionally to make him treasurer, which the L. Goring did
perform, and did put me from that very place which first induced me to meddle
with the Farms: and this was effected the third day of Novem. 1638 at the Lord
Gorings house in Tower-street; At which time, if I could have had my twenty
thousand pounds again, and have bin disengaged, I had withdrawn my self and bin
freed of the great pressures I have since undergone, but God had nor so
appointed; (I was caught for want of judgment, or foresight) and therefore was
author of mine own woe: The said Master Nulls (now sir John) being so chosen
treasurer, and 500. li per ann. allowed him for his intended good service, he
being to give security for ten thousand pounds, to keep exact accounts, and
deliver them unto the Farmers at all times upon demand; and to pay no
considerable sums of money, but by order and direction of the said Farmers, or
three or more of them; the very same day were the receipts divided; and the
Lord Goring was to have the subsidy of Tobacco, and impost of Currants in
London, and the Out ports, etc. The treasurer immediately after, began to lay
about him, and under color of being provided of money for the joint service,
he takes up at interest all the money he could Compass, that is to say,
thirty thousand pounds more then there was any joint occasion to use, and did
make particular use thereof for the reimbursing himself of what money he had
formerly lent the Lord Goring for his own sinister end as a^oresaid; breaking
the trust reposed in him, and lending it without my knowledge, and for ought I
could ever discover without any sufficient warrant; since I am sure he cannot
show my hand to any such warrant, though my share was the greatest next unto
the Lord Gorings; neither was there left any latitude in our articles of
agreement to lend any money at al, much less such vast sums, unto a noble man
of a fortune so perplexed, as his Lordship was understood to be at that time;
the orders themselves speaking no such language as you may discern by the copy
of them drawn out of the Register Book kept by him that was secretary to the
Farmers, the original, (by Gods providence) is now in my possession, and ready
to be showed unto any person that shall desire to be satisfied in that
particular, the dates of the said orders, and the expressions do follow
verbatim.

18. December 1638.
At the meeting at Sir Job Harbies House.
Present all the Farmers.
IT is ordered, that every particular receiver shall produce a particular of
the state of his account, and of the money remaining in cash and bonds, taken
once every Month in London and the Out-ports, and that his Cash-Book, and bonds
shall be ready upon all occasions for the Treasurer or any of the Farmers to
oversee: And that every particular receiver, shall pay what shall so remain in
cash to the Treasurer, within four days after the Treasurer shall call for the
same.

That all and every the Farmers shall see the Books of the Treasurer, as well
for his Cash, as for any thing else that shall concern the service.

That in case any of the receivers shall fail to make payment of such money
remaining in his hands within four days aforesaid; and shall not pay the same
within four days more next after; that then upon notice given (of such default
made) by the treasurer to the other Farmers: it is ordered, that the other
Farmers shall sequester the receipt of such failing receiver from him: And the
said receipt shall be disposed of as shall be thought good by the other Farmers
or the Major part of them, then resident; at the Custom-House or City.

And the Treasurer, is likewise ordered that at the same time of his calling
for money from the receipt^, he shall generally and equally call for the same
from all the receipts without Exception.

And it is further ordered that the money being so brought in to the Treasurer,
that he shall pay proportionally to every one of the Farmers, as to himself, an
equal and proportionable part of their advanced money, until the sum of one
hundred thousand pounds being repaid to them; which sum they have advanced to
his Majesty, etc. Which was the substance of what passed at that meeting

Another meeting, Vndecimo Aprilis 1639.
At Master Burlamachis.
It is orderd, that the several receivers shall deliver in to the Treasurer,
at the end of every quarter a particular note of his receipts, his several
payments made in that quarter, And the several debts made in their receipts,
and the persons from whom they are due, that every such receiver may clear with
the, Treasurer, and perfect his account. And if any receiver under any of the
Farmers shall give credit to any considerable sum, without the consent of the
Farmers, or three or more of them, in whose receipt it falls, shall be
answerable for the same.

Another meeting, 27 Die Junii 1639.
It is this day agreed between the Lord Goring on the one part, and the other
Farmers of his Majesty's Customs on the other part, that the Lord Goring shall
Farm the whole Subsidy and Custom of the Tobacco in the Port of Loddon, and
out-ports for three years from Christmas last 1638 for which the Lord Goring is
to pay yearly during the said term to the other Farmers, the sum of nineteen
thousand pounds, whiih rent of 19000. li is to be paid as it is now received
and paid by Master Thomas Nevet, by ready money and security taken.

Another meeting, The second July. 1639.
It is ordered that there shall be a draught presently made of an assignment of
the subsidy and customs of Tobacco's from the other Farmers to the Lord Goring,
at above said rent of nineteen thousand pounds per annum, which rent is to be
paid quarterly by even and equal portions by the said Lord Goring, etc.

Vicesimo quarto die July 1639. Ordered a Warrant after. Another meeting,
present
Sir Abraham Dawes. Sir John Jacob. Mr. Crispe. Mr. Nulls.

Mr. Nulls,
Whereas it is this day ordered by the farmers, that the sum of ten thousand
six hundred and seventeen pounds fourteen shillings and six pence, remaining in
cash your hands shall be divided among them upon account, viz. to the Lord
Goring the sum of seven hundred ninety nine pounds, seventeen shillings and
seven pence, to Sir Abraham Dawes for himself, and the assignment from the Lord
Goring, two thousand one hundred thirty nine pounds two shillings and five
pence; to Sir John Jacob for himself, and the assignment from the Lord Goring,
two thousand three hundred sixty nine pounds nineteen shillings; to Sir Job
Harby the sum of two thousand two hundred and twelve pounds and two pence; to
Master Crispe the sum of nineteen hundred and seventeen pounds and two pence,
And to Master Nulls the sum of eleven hundred seventy nine pounds fifteen
shillings and two pence, which several sums we pray you to pay, to every
Farmer accordingly: for which this order together with their several
acquittances shall be, your discharge.

Another meeting, being the last which was entered into the Register-Book.
The 15 October 1639. At Mr. Burlamachis House, all the Farmers present.
WHereas the Lord Goring offered nineteen thousand pounds, yearly for the
Custom of Tobacco: It is now agreed between all the Farmers, that the L.
Goring shall have the same for eighteen thousand pounds per annum, some reasons
being alleged for the abatement; and Mr. Nulls is to be the Lord Gorings
security by the consent and approbation of all the Farmers, and is to have all
the Lord Gorings receipts of Custom and Impost of Tobacco, as also of Currants.

AFter this order no register was kept of any more meetings, all indeed being
done without order, and without Conscience; for the then Sir John Nulls the
Treasurer, being also collectour for the Northern Ports, wherein Dover was
comprehended, and having griped the Lord Gorings collections of Tobacco, and
Impost of Currants into his own hands, he continued reimbursing himself of what
he had unwarrantably lent as aforesaid to the said Lord Goring, and connived
with Sir Abraham Dawes, and Sir John Jacob to receive the sum of nine thousand
pounds between them in ready money, as part of the Lord Gorings supposed
profits; whereas he best knew, there were no profits at all, the said profits
being swallowed up, in debts resting still unpayd, and the greatest part of the
said bad debts being by himself made; witness his keeping the Tobacco in
kind, also diverse bonds for subsidy of Tobacco to the value of seven thousand
three hundred pounds, and his placing to account, that exorbitant, unjust,
unwarrantable parcel of twenty three thousand four hundred pounds lent at
interest, which sum of money was double as much, as all the supposed profits
belonging to the Lord Goring for his eight shares could amount unto, moreover
he winked at Sir Nicholas Crispe to keep ready money in his hands to the value
of nine thousand pounds, and also took unto himself six thousand pounds
likewise in ready money, whereas if he had performed his trust faithfully, as
he was obliged under his hand and seal so to do, he should have given a
proportionable share of ready money, and a proportionable part of debts unto
each Farmer according to his share, and not all the ready money to himself, and
his confederates; and to leave me who (at the first) had advanced the greatest
share of the ready money (almost) nothing but bad debts, keeping those very
debts also in his own possession: only when this contrivance was made between
them for a division, they perceiving, I had not in good and bad debts so much
by two thousand and odd hundred pounds in my hands, as to make my division
equal with theirs, they caused Sir John Jacob to give me a slight note of his
hand for 2212. li 4. s 6. d instead of so much ready money, which should have
been paid me the 30 of Septem. 1641 from which very day there was due unto me,
as so much ready money short of my division the full sum of seven thousand two
hundred and twelve pounds four shillings and six pence, with interest for the
same ever since, whereof I could never procure one penny in payment from the
said Sir John Jacob, nor from the Treasurer, Sir John Nulls, notwithstanding
all the reasons I could give, nor all the solicitations I could make; All I
could possibly effect, three years after, when Sir Abraham Dawes was dead, and
Sir Nicholas Crispe was gone, was to obtain a warrant from Sir John Jacob, Sir
John Nulls, and my self unto Burlamachis, to Calandrini, and other accomptants,
to peruse all the books, and to examine and settle the said accounts according
to their best skill and understanding, and to report the same unto us with,
what expedition they could, which they performed in the year 1644. and made the
report thereof under their hands in manner and form following, the Copy of
which account is here set down verbatim.

Mr. Burlemachi,
WE are resolved for several Reasons us thereunton moving, to have the Books of
the Great and Petty Farms for the years 1639 and 1640 Audited, and have
appointed Mr. Richard Mountney, and Mr. Thomas Murthwaite to take it in hand
with all convenient speed; These are therefore to desire you to give them, or
either of them, free access unto the said Books and all other Papers, accounts,
and particulars belonging to the said Farms, and for so doing this shall be
your Warrant; This 22. of May 1644. And that you or Calendrini be assisting to
them, and do order or certify what shall be amiss, and deliver under all your
hands how every thing does stand,

J. Jacob.
Job Harby.
John Nulls.

Right worshipful,
IN pursuance of your order of the 22 of May 1644. We have drawn up the
accounts of the Farms Anno 1639 and 1640 wherein we have (by what we could
gather out of the Books and writings produced unto us) set down the true state
of those accounts to the 30 of July 1644. As by the said account hereunto
annexed may appear. In the first place is drawn out the General account of
the Great and Petty Farms, both for the charge thereof, and the profits
accruing thereby, next an abstract of his Majesty's account, and the account of
the several Farmors interressed therein; And lastly an account or Balance
what is owing either to any of the Farmors for the foot of their accounts, or
at interst to other men, in all amounting to the sum of 49670 l 3. s 11. d with
the account of the debts owing by several men for satisfaction of the said sum.
Upon all which accounts you may please to take notice that there is entered de
Been esse for the better stating thereof 2986. l 15. s 10. d for three parcels
on the Lord Gorings account of Tobacco, and 150. li demanded by Sir John Jacob
for charges, as by the general acompt in Folio 1. appears, Also there is
past to the credit of Sir Job Harby 4559 li 17 s 6. d for debt in his hands
according to particulars now produced, which in former calculations we find
was set down but at 1596. li 14. s Moreover we are informed that there has
been several Grograines received by Sir Job Harby and Sir John Nulls, of Mr.
Edward Abbott in part of his debt, for which they are to give an account; All
which we humbly leave to your considerations,

THis aforegoing account being thus stated, drawn up, and certified Anno 1644
And the original remaining in the hands of Pompey Calendrini, and several
copies thereof delivered, one to Sir John Jacob, one to Sir John Nulls, and
another to my self, wherein I appeared to be Creditor the sum of, 7212-04-0b.
As principal money. At which time Thomas Murthwait one of the said accomptants
did cast up the interest, whereby it did also appear that I was Creditor the
sum of 625-08-03 Sir John Jacob debtor 463-05-0. Sir John Nulls debtor
505-09-2 Sir Nicholas Crispe debtor 1107-04-09 so that all my said partners
were debitors great sums of money for principal and interest, and my self then
a Creditor for eight thousand pounds or there abouts, of which I could never
since procure one penny neither from Sir John Jacob nor Sir John Nulls; but on
the contrary part have since paid other great sums of money, being pressed
thereunto by their practices, in one payment 1150. li at the reqest of Sir John
Nulls to One Tainturier to keep him from being arrested, he then telling me I
was wronged by Sir John Jacob and Sir Nicholas Crispe, and that he would be a
means, I should be satisfied my full due, which was his flattering language,
until he had dreyned from me almost all my estate, and then perceiving he
could do no more with me by persuasions; he fell down right upon me; and caused
me to be arrested by one Bovey to whom I was forced to pay about 700. li for
part of that debt, my share thereof being a great deal less: after that he
caused M. Squire to cast me into prison as aforesaid, then he heightened the
Lady Wyche now the lady Merrick her pressures against me: telling her, Mr.
Gouldman and others, that if Sir Job Harby would pay his third part, he would
discharge his own part: this done, he caused one Shurland to pursue me, as also
Colonel Hutchinson with many others too long to be named: telling to one, that
Sir Job Harby keeps in his hands that which should pay the creditors, unto
others he says frequently, Sir Job Harby does nothing but talk, he will do
nothing, to others that Sir Job is a beggar: with these and other slanders he
would feign make the world believe that I am the cause the creditors are not
paid: whereas I do entreat you all to take notice, that I have continually
importuned him, and others the partners, to make up accounts: but all without
any success: for it being some months past ordered amongst us, that each
Farmer should bring his account to the book-keeper, to see what every man had
paid toward the satisfaction of the creditors in general: there is nothing
at all done therein: Only I have drawn up mine own account, subscribed the
same, and delivered it, unto the bookkeeper. the 3 day of Ianu. last past,
whereby it does plainly appear: there is due unto me for the two years account

Since my sending in this account, I have many times importuned them that we
may fairly and friendly settle all our differences and go jointly on, hand in
hand to the satisfaction of our Creditors, and this done by word of mouth, by
several messages unto Sir John Jacob, Sir John Nuls etc. having written several
times unto them unto that purpose; the Copy of my last is hereunto annected but
never answered, and I think never will be; the letter follweth.

Gentlemen,
AS I take it this is the first time, that (after promise) I did ever miss to
wait upon you, for the settlement of this account for the two years Farms; And
were it not that my attendance before a Committee in Parliament, does now
hinder me, I should instead of these lines, have been personally with you.
Although I must confess, such is my apprehension, that all our meetings, yea,
and our pursuit for satisfaction of the great debt Owing unto us, will be to
very little purpose, unless we either come resolved to do as we would be done
unto; Or else admit of some unconcerned knowing persons to decide matters in
difference between us: and indeed how can we expect to have justice done unto
us upon our petitions, so long as we are not inclined to deal equally and
justly one with another. For my part I am sensible, and the course of nature
teaches me, that it will not be long, before I must render account of my
stewardship, even unto the great Judge of all the world; Before whom I do now
profess, that I would not willingly wrong the general accounts amongst us, nor
any of you in particular, no not, if by my so doing I might gain all your
estates; In pursuance whereof I affirm, that if by error or mistake, I have
claimed any thing, or shall demand that which does not justly belong unto me;
Let it be made apparent wherein any such omission or mistake of mine is, or may
be; and it shall be rectified instantly to the utter most farthing, both of
principal and interest, yea, though I should be a loser thereby. It is not
meeting by our selves alone, nor Contestations about Punctillo's, or
Circumstances, that will make a just end of our accounts, no nor ever settle
any peace amongst us; such proceedings will rather make the breach wider; We
have had words more then enough already, and all to no purpose; It is action
must do our work, that is, to set down justly in writing the true state of this
accounts, which may most easily be effected in a few days, nay in a few hours,
by the Treasurer, and by him that kept the book of accounts; and have had
sufficient sallary for their pains, if their wills be suitable to their
abilities; the groundwork lying readily before them, in their own custody, so
as if they two will spend together but half so much time, as we have usually
and fruitlessely spent at any one of our meetings, there may be more done in
that short space, then we have done in all our impertinent and confused
conferences.

And whereas that inconsiderate order of the 30 of September 1641. is Conceived
to thwart those deeds under our hands and seals for the equal division of
principal and profit upon the Farms; groundlessely inferring that the division
then made was as well upon the stock, as upon, the supposed gain; It does
contrarily and plainly appear that at the time when this order was made; none
of you there had one penny of principal stock remaining undivided, each of you
having had his whole principal before; only Sir Abraham dawes was a Crediror;
and my self for so many wine Merchants bonds as were then known to be
desperate, and were left in my hands as part of my principal; how ever that
very order so much insisted upon, does speak plainly, that the said division
should be equally made, and that who has more then his proportion, should pay
presently unto the other that should come short, so that every thing might be
justly stated and cleared; and withal, that if the remainder of the stock
should not come in to satisfy the debts, every one should rateabl^ repay so
much of the said division, as should discharge the same. Which taken for
granted, there was due to me seven thousand two hundred and odd pounds, a^
appears by the accounts drawn up and subscribed by your own accomptants in
July. 1644. All the debts paid, there remaining in the treasurers hands a great
part of the Tobacco, and never yet accom^ted for. Now Gentlemen, having thus
far really and truly related the state of our unhappy partnership; I do leave
it to your selves to choose whether you will account from the v^r^ b^ginning of
our undertaking the Customs; or to take ^he me from those accounts drawn up in
1644. In one (...) which two ways I do beseech you in such manner to (...)
^hol^ accounts as may stand with the discharge of your own consciencess, and
the clearing of your integrities to the world; without which no inventions nor
protractions can clear you, neither before God nor man. I do now call to mind
a speech used unto me by one of you upon the Exchange, at our very first
entrance into this (to me) fatal negotiation, id est, That the old farmers
would be too hard for us; and I do also remember my own reply, (with which I
shall conclude this scrole) that we would be too hard for them; my intent being
to do nothing but what should become an honest man. This was my tenent at the
first, and God willing shall be whilst breath is in my body. Only this I
add, that without some settlement of the accounts between us; I shall not be
capable to assist you at all neither in payment of the old debts, nor with any
supply toward the procuring of satisfaction for the great debt due unto us
from the late King: but if you will please to order the just liquidation of the
said accounts (though my condition be the poorest amongst you) I shall hope to
find friends so as to satisfy my full proportion of what sum soever shall be
concluded between the creditors as well for the two years as the contracted
farms, So wishing friendship, and praying God to direct you and me for the
best, I take leave and rest

March the 13. 1649. 50. At your service Job Harby.
The way to settle this account justly and equally is to appoint Mr. Calendrini
to make a new estimate of profit and loss, and then to divide as well the good
as the bad matter equally according to each man's proportion, and then there can
be no wrong to any man; but to give all the money unto one, and all the bad
debts to another is most abominable injustice.


J. H.

ANd not withstanding all these passages, the truth whereof I shall make good
(upon my life) they will do nothing, but backbite me, and daily slander me to
the Creditors, and others, with such other provocations; that I being but a
worm, made of flesh and blood can no longer digest; nor forbear the
publishing of this my last refuge, wanting any other means to support me in
this great and bitter afflictional which particulars Comprehended in as short a
compass as my declining Genius could contract them; I do conclude with my
hearty requests unto all those I am indebted unto for these partable accounts
of the farms: As follows.

That you will seriosly observe these particulars, as follows.

1. That the debts owing unto you for the two years farms, is but 20000. li at
the most; secondly, that the very same account owes me twelve thousand pounds,
thirdly, that for some of those debts (by the Art of Sir John Nulls) I have
lain prisoner three years, and a half; fourthly, that the said Sir John Nulls
as treasurer did take up at interest and lent more of these monyes without any
sufficient warrant then would have paid all these debts unto you and me, and
moreover does keep in his hands, bonds, and security, to a far greater value,
although he be tied in equity, and by the Farmers joint order, with his own
consent to be the Lord Gorings security, and had the receipts of Tobacco, and
Currants for his indemnity; he having lost nothing by the said Farms, but has
clearly gained thereby, 7 or 8000. li And is best able to pay the said debts;
fifthly, Sir John Jacob does owe me upon that score 2200. li with interest ever
since Janna. 1641 and never paid me, one penny principal nor interest; howbeit
these two persons have made it all their work to keep me prisoner 3 years, for
those very debts which properly belong to themselves.

In tender Consideration of the premises, and for that all my said partners in
the two years farms, are gainers, and my self only a great loser; you will
please, that I may be no further prosecuted for those debts belonging
thereunto; but that I may be set at liberty, to join with you as a Creditor in
the pursuit of those two persons aforementioned, who do wrongfully keep our means
from us, and yet have visible estates sufficient to pay.

The April 1650 Job Harby.
