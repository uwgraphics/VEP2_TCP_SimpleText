A Copy of the Petition presented to the Kings Majesty by the high Sheriff, and
other Gentlemen, and Freeholders of the County of Rutland, as His Majesty
passed through their County, between Stamford and Grantham.
To the Kings Most Excellent Majesty.
The humble Petition of Your Majesty's loyal Subjects of the County of Rutland.
Shows,
THat as with all humble thankfulness they do acknowledge the many former and
late influences of Your Royal Grace and Goodness, whereby they were lifted up
with an expectation of happy days, wherein Your Sacred Majesty should have an
Eternal Throne of Safety and Honor erected in the hearts of all Your loyal
people, higher than the Thrones of any of Your Royal Predecessors; So we
cannot now but express our unspeakable griefs, fearing all those hopes shall
be dashed, and the joy of the whole Land darkened, by Your Majesty's
withdrawing Your Sacred Person, in these times of imminent danger, from Your
Great Council, to the raising of unspeakable fears in the hearts of Your
loyal Subjects.

Wherefore, in all humility, Your Petitioners implore Your Sacred Majesty, That
out of the depth of Your Princely Wisdom and Goodness, the beams of Your
Grace and Favor may again break forth upon Your Kingdom, in vouchsafing Your
Majesty's Presence to the Parliament, whereby the fears of Your People may be
removed, A Foundation laid of everlasting comfort to this Kingdom in the safety
of Your Sacred Person, And abundant increase of Honors and Greatness upon
Your Royal Government.
