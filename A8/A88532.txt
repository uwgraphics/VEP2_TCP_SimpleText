A LOOKING-GLAS FOR THE PRESBITARY GOVERNMENT, ESTABLISHING IN THE CHURCH OF
ENGLAND.

OR, A Declaration of the Revolution of the times, pithily composed and
seasonably recommended to the view of all sorts of people, but principally to
the Judicious Reformers of the Church and State.

Look in this Glass you will not think it strange,
England once more receives a change.
Of Scotlands Government, you will have a view,
And Englands Presbitary which is new.
As in a Glass you here may see,
The King: the Kingdoms misery.
The Crown resigned, Religion suffers,
By Pride, Ambition, and Self Lovers.
LONDON, Printed by B. A. 1645.

A LOOKING-GLASS For the PRESBITARY GOVERNMENT, Establishing in the Church of
EEGLAND.
AS I consider the matter which I have to write, me thinks it has the rare
nature of a Looking-glass; to show and represent that which is behind, as well
as that which is before, wherein I doubt not but to gain the better acceptance
if I avoid these things which are commonly known; and have often sounded in
your ears.

Before the Conquest the Pope had no supremacy in England, but all the
intercourse and Commerce between the Sea of Rome and this Kingdom, was in
these three partticulers.

First, it was confessed that the English were converted unto Christianity by
the means of Pope Gregory, about the year of our Lord six hundred.

Secondly, the Kings of England paid Peter Pence to Rome, which in the old
English were called Almespence, and were distributed among the poor impotent
persons which should come out of England to Rome; which was paid upon this
reason?

The Pope taking upon him to be a dispenser of spiritual gifts, and that, the
Mother Church of the world, that Church received all into it, viz. the halt,
blind, sick, etc. And for that the Conclaves of Rome were not only thirsty
after money, but loath to be pestered with the frequent resort of poor people
into the City, without having means from the several Countries from whence
they came, for their releife and maintenance; they found out this way not only
to defray that charge, but to bring a great Revenue into the Popes Treasury.

Thirdly, the Bishops and Abbots had sometimes deeds of privile^ge and
confirmations to their Seas and Abbathies from the Pope of Rome, but before
Henry the seconds time, the Bishops took no oath to the Sea of Rome, neither
was the Popish Lithurgie or the Cannon Law of any use before his days in this
Kingdom; for Pope Gregory says, it was not necessary that the Roman Lithurgie
should be followed in this Kingdom, any other might serve, but in Henry the
seconds time, Thomas Becket Archbishop of Canterbury, practiced to enlarge the
power of the Pope, for which he being killed in a preposterous manner, though
the King de^^ed to have any hand in the fact: yet to be reconciled to the
Clergy, he granted all their demands; and what privileges they desired. So
that the death of Be^ket ^n the seventeenth year of Henry the second, Anno
1171. was the birthday of the Canon Law, Notwithout cause did then the Pope
Canonize Becket and appointed for him a holiday in England, yet Caesarius the
Monk, questioneth whether Becket were saved or not?

Thus was the King led away by a Popish Clergy faction, insomuch that (now and
not before) they plead exemption from temporal jurisdiction, and yet are made
temporal Judges, being Sheriffs of Counties, and Bayliffes of Hundreds, which
makes Graftshood Bishop of Lincoln break forth into these words. That for a
Divine to meddle in a sequeler Court is, as if a Bird in the Air should with
the Mouldwarp work in the earth.

The Pope having by this means gotten such strong footing in this Kingdom, no
means was left unattempted to inthrall this Island in stronger cords of
bondage and servitude, which was the easier to effect; for that King John
sought rather to please the Faction, then to regulate the Laws ^f the land:
because he was a usurper, and of so weak c^pacity, that as he had no right to
the Crown, so he cared not to wrong the whole Kingdom; both in not defending
their Liberties, and resigning his interests therein; surrendering the Crown to
the Pope to his dishonor and perpetual infamy. Thus was the Crown of our
King taken from him and laid at the feet of the Holy Father, with which at this
day his Miter is laureled about.

These growing evils begat the wars between the King and his Barons, temp^re
Henry the third, in whose reign Mounford a Frenchman was the only favorite of
the Kings delight, and now were the Reins of Rule put alone into the hands of
the Kings half Brethren; Adam, Guido, Godfrey, and William; these Ministers
do what they list, they fill upon the places of Justice, and (being strangers)
put out English men and exacted of whom and how they pleased, set prizes on all
offices, and ruled the Law with their own breasts, keeping the subject from
complaining to the King; and these strangers seemed not to have been invited
hither, but to have entered the land by Conquest. And this we see is the
capacity of Government in a King, when it falls to be a prey to such lawless
Minions; for they generally take warrant from Princes weakness, of licentious
liberty.

This King being thus drawn away from his Commons, was brought into such want,
that he first sold his Lands, then his jewels, and pawneth his Crown; and
when he had neither credit to borrow (having so often failed the trust he
made) nor morgage of his own, laid to pawn the jewels of Saint Edwards shrine,
and afterward was forced to break up his house, and with his Queen and
Children,

Cum Abatibus and Prierihus humilia satis hospitia quaerunt, et prandia.

The State was managed by sour and twenty Commissioners, so that he had left
himself neither election of public officers, nor private attendance; and was
forced to exile his half brethren under his own hand in writing, and the King
himself being taken prisoner at the battle of Lewis, was brought to see his
error and misfortune; and afterward by a happy concurrence with the Commons,
was re-established in his Throne, and reigned many years after in glory and
tranquillity.

Although upon the settling of those distractions the Adversaries to the public
weal of this Kingdom received such a stroke, that they were able to act
little for many years after; yet were they always plotting and contriving
against this State, by secret Jesuitical and Domestic plots, and raising
Iarres and open commotions abroad: witness the continual wars between
England and Spain in the days of Queen Elizabeth of happy memory, and the
Irish rebellion at the same time; all which troubles were hatched by the
Spanish and Jesuiticall faction at home: which at her Majesty's first entrance
to the Crown (though for wisdom and virtue was the Phoenix of her sex) had so
cunningly insinuated with her sacred Majesty, that they had almost at the very
morning of Knowledge (which indeed is the constant practice of their sandy
foundations) persuaded her that there was too much preaching, and that one or
two preaching Ministers in a County was sufficient; which was so subtly
infused into her ear, that it took such impression in her Royal Breast, that
her Majesty wrote a Letter to Bishop Grindall then Archbishop of Canterbury,
seeming to relish that advise, but this religious Bishop being then four miles
distant from Court, wrote another Letter to her Majesty, declaring that her
Majesty was misadvised therein, desiring that she would not have a thought of
restraing the worship and service of God, showing that nothing was so dangerous
to her person as ignorance in her people, proving that to be the cause of the
Rebellion (about the same time) in the North; besides it was one way whereby
she should best discharge her duty to God, if she promoted his Gospel.

This Counsel of the Bishops wrought so effectually on the Religious
affections of that gracious Queen, that she presently (not to consult with
flesh and blood) received the former Council, and looked upon it and the
persons as favoring of the Jesuitical faction, and al^hough the G^oves (many
Relics of Popery) were no^ utterly taken away (it being then but the dawning
of the day) yet Religion did flourish and increase not only during the whole
Reign of that famous Queen, but in the time of King James mauger, all the
wicked practices of the adversaries of our Religion and Liberty, and when they
perceived that they were infatuated in their Counsels, and confounded in their
domestic plots (that it might appear to the world, that they are ever
plotting mischeife) they take on them the managing of a Treaty of marriage for
our King that now is, till they had treated the Palsgrave out of his Kingdom,
and after so much time lost, a match was concluded with France to our far
greater disadvantage at the present, and has proved a scourge to us for the
future; neither do we read that ever any match with France proved
advantageous to this Kingdom, though the parties were of our Religion; much
less therefore could it be expected when they were of different Religions, and
Articles agreed upon (which on out side were too well kept) that such a number
of Priests and Capuchians, should come over into England, and that Idolatry
should be openly exercised in her Majesty's Chapel; though a^l English men
except her Majesty's servants were prohibited from coming thither) neither was
the Queen to use any private persuasions to his Majesty, concerning matters of
Religin.

But mark how the Game was played, now, Canterburies Chaplains must preach
nothing but themselves and Arminianisme (the subtilest sort of Popery) and we
must believe that Papists were honest men, and might go to Heaven as soon as
Protestants (yet they might always account and call us Heretics and that
there was some little difference between their Religion and ours, that they
might easily be reconciled, and as an efficatious means of this
reconciliation, her Majesty's Chapel doors must stand open to all Comers,
and sights be seen there, and music to be heard; far exceeding any pastime
at Interludes or Stage Plays, the number of Priests about her Majesty must
have been doubled (if not trebled) and Jesuits peeping, nay swaggering about
in every street: more Chapels must be built, and Nunneries erected; the
Queen her self is forced (for what offense I know not) to go barefoot to
Tyburne and back again on penance? His Majesty put to an excessive charge in
maintaining those which under a profession of poverty eat the fat of the
Land, and had their pockets full of gold, and a garb like a Lord, yet might
not his Majesty complain of this, nor suffer it to be spoken on. Nay when
they had broken all their conditions, instead of banishing them (as by the Law
they might) they are now become such necessary instruments, and so potent; that
they must set forward and contribute to the maintaining of a war against our
brethren of Scotland.

Yea further, their advice is held better then a Parliament, and Father
Phillips is protected within the verge of the Court, against the power and
authority of the supreme Court in the Kingdom; and the King cannot rest in
his private Chamber.

And although the King by his Proclamation declare the insurrection in Ireland
to be a Rebe lion, yet within a short time after their factors are protected,
and the Rebels (to the dishonor of his Majesty) are so impudent, that they
boast of the authority they have from the Royal powers, to warrant their
massacring thousands of Protestants in that Kingdom, and the provisions which
were designed for their releife by the Parliament, are intercepted by the
Papists in England, and their adherents; the Parliament are sometimes termed
Rebels, and sometimes no notice taken of them: and an Anti-Parliament cal^ed at
Oxford, which imitated all those branches o^ privilege which is only prosper
to the Parliament at first called by his Majesty's writ: wherein he calls them
his great Counsel; but when it appeared that this plot to deceive the people,
could not take that effect as was intended, It is once more granted, that the
L^rds and Commons assembled in the Parliament at Westminster, are the
Parliament of England? by which at the last is confirmed (even from Oxford)
that whatsoever Ordinances, etc. have been made at Westminster since the
sitting of the House, have been done by the P^rliament of England, what ever G.
Dighy was pleased heretofore to call them, and whatsoever a Parliament has
power to do, may be done by them hereafter.

Having thus far declared the state of this Kingdom from the Conquest unto
our times, under the burden of an aspiring Iesuited Clergy, and their faction,
it remains, that I should briefly represent unto you the true state of the
Church, by which, as in a glass you may perceive the foundation, increase, and
alterations therein; which that I may the clearer demonstrate unto you, I shall
ascend above the Conquest, and in the first place lay before you the state of
the prosessours of Christ and his Gospel in the primitive times: for our
orthodox writers speaking of those times, say thus; From the time of our
Savior, until the Emperors became Christians, the people of God assembled
upon the face of the earth much, as the fishes do in the Sea, or the birds in
the Air; for the inhabitants thereof admit of no bounds or particular
divisions; neither were Christians allowed any particular bounds or places of
residence or meeting, but gathered together and assembled sometimes in private
houses, and sometimes in Cells and Caves; and therefore were the more
materially called the Catholic Church dispersed over the face of the Earth,
for all the world was but one Diocese or Parish: the Church in those times
much resembling the Church of England in the days of Queen Mary, yet were they
called a Church; for by this word is meant the Assembly of faithful
Christians, for Solomon blessed all the Church of Israel, and Saint Peter
says, the Church saluteth you.

But when the Emperor became a Christian, there was soon a glorious visible
Church, for Eusebius writes, about the year 254. after Christ, there was forty
six Presbiters in the Church of Rome, and 1500. poor people maintained by the
contribution of the Christians of the City; and there was of the Clergy 108.
which were men that had such excellent gifts, and of so holy a conversation,
that the proverb of those days is, that they had wooden Challaces, and golden
Priests.

But to descend nearer to our times and our own country Ethelbert King of Kent
married with Berta, the French Kings daughter, who was a Christian and she
being desirous to have her husband, of her Religion, made means to Pope
Gregory, first to send some ministers to convert the English who sent Augustine
the monk and Candidus the Priest, which were courteously received by the King,
and Augustine made Bishop or minister of Canterbury, there being a Church or
Temple; and being the chief place in the dominions of the King of Kent, other
places became subordinate to this, and so he got the title of Metropolitan or
Archbishop, and as Christanity increased and Churches built they were but as
chapels of ease to this church, and all were brought hither to be christened
this being the parish church, for we find in the Epistle of our Saxon King
Renulphus, that the whole Archiepiscopall sea of Canterbery is called parochia,
or a parish, yet at that time there were other places for christians to
assemble in; but the church, at canterbury was like unto Halifax in Yorkshire,
which has twelve chapels belonging to its Dioces or parish.

In England before William the conquerers time there were few country churches,
or at leastwise parish churches, for Diocesses or parishes were erected since
according to the civil government of the Land, to the intent it might be known
out of what towneship tithes were due.

Having laid this foundation and showed you what a church is, and what a Bishop
and his Diocesses were we will give a short view of their varying from their
first station, for by degrees they usurp authority over the whole clergy, get
into temporal offices and become rather Statesmen then Divines yea though the
Bishop of Winton says, that the Church is never taken for the assembly of
Priests alone, but for the assembly of all the faithful, yet the Clergy alone
assembled in their convocations would be accounted the Church of E^gland, as
Linwood has it, and were grown to that height, that Anselme Archbishop of
Canterbu^y writes in his Epistle to the Pope, that the power of the holy Church
is drawn by two open, of equal strength and beauty, the King and himself.
And the Bishop of Winton, though he were the Kings brother, assembled all the
Clergy against King Stephen, And Temopre H^^ry 1. The Bishop complies with the
Pope standing in defense of the King, until the King complying with his
Parliament, made a Law that if any Bishop or Clergie-man had any wrong offered
him he should have no writ to redress it, that all the lay fees of the Bishop
and Clergy, should be seized into the Kings hands, that if any man met with a
Clergy man which had a better horse then his he might unhorse him and change
with him (then change was no robbery?)

By this means the King was for the presnt restored to his right of
government, and the present abuses found some redress, but they could not long
be kept under, for innumberable are the presidents which I might recite in the
days of Hen^y 7. Edward the 6. Queen Mary, Queen Elizabeth, and King James
too, of the plots against the Church, against the Kingdom, against preaching,
against Religious discourse, and Godly meetings, and to bring in Popery,
tyranny profanation, all which have been practiced by many Bishops, but
because I would not be tedious, finding them all summoned up in one (as yet)
living example, who though in his life was like his predeceslour Thomas Becket,
yet I am cofident he will not in his death; for the death of Becket is said to
be the birth of the Canon Law and superstition, but I hop^ the death of this
man, will be the death of these and many other Romish Dregs.

And thus being again descended to the present times, I shall say little
concerning the first part of my discourse touching the Civil government of
this Kingdom, for that it has abundantly been manifested to the world, the
unwearied pains, and uncessant endeavors that have been long used by the
Honorable Houses of Parliament, to redress them, and to remove the causes
from whence all those evils flow; wherein by the way we may observe that the
evil of evils, or the greatest evil that ever befell this Kingdom, is, that
the inhabitants thereof for the most part, are as a man in a dead palsy, and
one side quite benumbed, and utterly void of sense or feeling; or like one that
is stricken with some other desperate disease: and instead of seeking a cure,
plungeth himself into a condition irrecoverable. And such an evil as this is
not to be paralelld amongst all the distempers and revolutions of times, since
Christianity first entered this Island. For though our Historians mention former
differences between the King and his subjects (and that in time of a
Parliament too) which grew to so great a height, that it produced open wars
(even when the whole Kingdom for matter of Religion, were universally of one
mind) yet were the Commons of this land so tender of their birthrights and
liberty of their posterity, that they maintained them with their dearest blood;
but in a dead Lithurgy is this age, that although liberty was never deeper
engaged and Religion, the life of our lives at the stake, the greatest part of
this Kingdom either stand as Newters, or most unnaturally, by a course of
violence, endeavor to plunge themselves and their posterity into a condition
irrecoverable, and though they profess a hatred to Popery, join with all the
Papists in the Kingdom, yea the uncivillized barberous bloody Irish Rebels,
which are more cruel then Nero.

But I hasten to a period, for it is my task to draw my conclusions from what
I roughly represent, and lay before you; for having in the second part of my
discourse declared the foundation of Christianity, the nature of a Church; and
given you a short hint of the manner of Discipline and government therein, and
how it has varied from the first foundation, I shall humbly leave the
rectifying or re-establishment thereof to the grave and juditious reformers of
the Church and State. For though there be some doubts whether the Church at
Jerusalem, were but one Congregation or assembly in the Apostles time, yet if
we consider the multitude of Christians that were there, and the several sorts
of Languages, and Nations, in i^ we may thence gather, that there were more
places to Congregate then one, else all could not hear, or if they could, yet
were not capable to understand and edify. And as for the division of parishes
the matter is not great, being a politic Law, which a State have had power to
make in all ages.

That there were Presbiters in the Church is not denied, but some question is
made what power and authority they had over the Clergy which we humbly
conceive may easily be cleared, and though the Minister may be presented by
the Presbyters (as in the Church of Scotland) yet may there be such testimony
and approbation given, by consent of the P^^ish where he or they are to serve,
that all scruples (...) away; and tender consciences (both in this and (...))
receive good satisfaction. And the difference between ^^e Presbyterians and
Independents, is not in point of Religion, but in matter of Civil Government,
which the Civ^^^ Magistrates have power to settle according to the policy of
(...), which power has been exercised heretofore in this K^^g^om, wherein I
humbly conceive they followed the examp^^ or the renowned Senators of the Roman
State, for though I find not in the old Law of Moses, that any man was to dye
for theft, yet I read that two thieves were crucified with our Savior, which
being according to the politic laws amongst the Romans, was not condemned by
Christ himself or his Apostles And when Shemei was confined to a city, out of
which he was not to go on pain of death, though we read not before of any
such penalty upon the breach of such confinement; yet he was executed for that
offense, and the judgment acknowledged against him to be just and good.

If this be the case, then the Parliament of England have power to make Laws,
for the Civil Government in Church and Commonwealth (which are not repugnant
to the word of God) and by the Laws of this Land, parishes are already
divided: and those which are called Independents, are not able to make it
appear that there was any such Independency as some have aimed at in the
Church of Jerusalem or elsewhere in the primitive times, after the Church came
to be settled. O let it not therefore be said in Gath, or published in Ashkelon;
that any haughty spirits strive to make a breach amongst those which are within
the Pale of the Church of God, but let us submit to every Ordinance of man for
the Lords sake, and let it be our constant prayers, that this great Counsel
may go on in establishing such laws in Church and Kingdom, as may be for
the glory of God, and establishing of peace and tranquillity amongst us; So
shall they do worthily, and be rendered famous to all posterity.

FINIS.
