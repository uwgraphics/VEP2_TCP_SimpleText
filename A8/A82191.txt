THE DECLARATION Of the Navy, being THE True Copy of a Letter from the
Officers of the Navy, to the Commissioners: With their Resolutions upon
turning out Colonel RAINSBROUGH from being their Commander.
28th. May, 1648.
Worshipful;
THese are to certify you that we the Commanders, and Officers of the Ship
Constant Reformation, with the rest of the Fleet, have secured the Ships for
the service of King and Parliament, and have refused to be under the Command of
Colonel Rainsbrough, by reason we conceive him to be a man not well-affected
to the King, Parliament and Kingdom, and we do hereby declare unto you, that
we have unanimously joined with the Kentish Gentlemen, in their just Petition
to the Parliament, to this purpose following, videlicet.

First, that the Kings Majesty with all expedition be admitted in Safety and
Honor, to treat with his two Houses of Parliament.

Secondly, that the Army now under the Command of the Lord Fairfax, to be
forthwith disbanded, their Arrears being paid them.

Thirdly, That the known Laws of the Kingdom may be Established and continued,
whereby we ought to be Governed and Judged.

Fourthly, That the Privileges of Parliament and the Liberty of the Subjects
may be preserved.

And to this purpose we have sent our loving Friend Captain Penrose, with a
Letter to the Earl of Warwick, and we are resolved to take in no Commander
whatsoever, but such as shall agree and correspond with us in this Petition,
and shall resolve to live and dye with us, in the behalf of King and
Parliament, which is the Positive Result of us.

We humbly desire your speedy Answer. Officers of the constant Reformation.
