THE INHERITANCE OF JACOB Discovered: After his return out of Egypt, and the
leading of the Lord of the Land of promise, declared, and some information of
the way thither.
AWAKE Oh Sion, who has long sitten in the dust, in sorrow and bitterness,
and has been covered with ashes, and none has had compassion upon thee, but
all the Kings, and mighty men of the earth who have worshipped the beast, and
received his mark, and committed fornication with the whore, which sitts upon
many waters, which is full of abomination, and the Cup in her hand have all the
men of the earth drunken off and are made drunk, and staggers and now glories
in their abominations, and (Oh Sion) dispises thy virginity, and thy
situation, and has pulled down thy Towers, and made thee as a desolate
widow, and has gone over thee, and trampled upon thy glory, and has made
merry over thee, and has slain thy Sons and Daughters in the streets, even
in Babylon, where the whore sits as a Queen, and in Sodom and Egypt, with
whom they are joined, where the witnesses lies slain, But the time of thy
deliverance is come, and the years of thy Captivity is up. Arise, Oh Virgin,
who art not defiled, who could not join with the Daughter of Babylon in her
whoredoms; Therefore they have mocked thee, and wagged their heads at thee,
and has said in their hearts, who shall deliver thee? Arise, shine forth, put
on thy beautiful garments, behold thy King comes in his glory, who will
adorn thee and crown thee with a royal Diadem, in the sight of thine
enemies, who have reproached thee; and thy reproach shall be taken away, for
thy Seed shall be as the stars in multitude, yea* they that have spoiled
thee, shall be spoiled, and they that have destroyed thee shall be destroyed,
for the King is coming out of his Tent, yea he has lifted up his Standard
against all that have spoiled thee, yea, the destroyer is come up against
Babylon, and Egypt shall tremble, and the Philistines hearts shall fail for
fear, and all the Canaanites shall be cast out, and this shall be performed by
the Lord of Hosts, the God of Jacob, who is now arisen in his Jealousy and it
burns as fire, against all the Inhabitants of the earth, and the Sea, who has
joined their strength together against the inheritance of the Lord, rejoice for
evermore all that love his appearance, and who have waited for him, he is come,
and coming to take vengeance upon his, and you adversaries, for he has a
sacrifice in Babylon to perform, even to cut off all her Children; who has
despised thee, Oh* Sion. Arm your selves, oh ye high Cedars, and mighty men,
put on your strength, and gather together all your forces, which you have
trusted in, call upon your gods, and all your Soothsayers, and Diviners
together, for now he is come, and the Daughter of Sion now laughes you to
scorn, and Jerusalem, the free Citizens does wagg their heads at you; for he
will now plead the cause of the poor, against you who have been too strong for
them, and now all that hears this shall tremble; For he will make Jerusalem a
praise in the earth, and from it does the Law and the Prophets come forth.

Awake, Oh Arm of the Lord, and put one strength as in the days of old, to
redeem thine own inheritance, which has long been by the heathen laid wast,
and has been trampled upon by the uncircumcised, art not thou he, which was,
and is, and is to come? who wilt not give the glory to another, arise and shine
forth in thy brightness thou Starr of Jacob, and Sun of Righteousness, and
let the earth be filled with thy Light and glory, that Generations to come may
call thee blessed. Dry up the tongue of the Egyptian Sea, confound the wisdom
of this world which never knew thee, neither would own, nor receive thee, make
the Diviners and Sorcerers mad, who have scattered thy sheep from the
everlasting fold, and have healed the hurts of thy people deceitfully, and have
caused them to err, in telling them, thy power, nor thy Arm was not to be
looked for now, as in the days of old, nor thy immediate voice, nor word was
to be looked, or waited for now in the earth, and so have deceived the people,
with their lying divinations, which they have spoken from the imaginations of
their own hearts, and have laid a stumbling block in the way, as the Son of
Nebat did who made Israel to sin.

But Oh Lord, thou see how thy own Seed lies scattered, and the ravenous
beasts make a prey upon it, and the devourers swallow it up, therefore have
thou appeared in thy love and power, for thine own names sake, and will not
suffer thy Seed to be trodden upon any longer, by the Prince of darkness, nor
his Children whom he has begotten in his own Image.

Arise, shine forth, thou everlasting Covenant of light and peace, by which,
and in which, all our Fathers believed* and so obtained a good Report, and were
redeemed out of Captivity, to serve the* Lord for ever with one heart and
mind, and worshipped in one Spirit, in which Faith they laid hold upon the
perfect Righteousness of Christ, made manifest in them, and were justified,
but has been hid for many Generations, in the time of Antichrists Reign, and
all the world has wondered after the be^st, and has received his mark, but
now is the night far spent, and the day is at hand, wherein all that has
been hid shall be made manifest, and the Number of the beast is read and known
by all that are redeemed from under his power, and now the beast and the false
Prophet is seen, and the man of sin, is made manifest in this the day of his
everlasting power; and the brightness of the Sun of Righteousness, who is the
light of the word, has made him manifest who is come and coming: Glory unto
him for evermore, who alone is worthy to take the Kingdom.

Wherefore all honest hearted* in, and underall forms of professions who have
traveled, and are weary, and all you that have kindled a fire, and have warmed
your selves at the sparks thereof; and yet still you lie in sorrow.

Oh all ye that have pantel, and thristed after Righteousness, who have
wearied your selves in seeking, among the dead Graves and Tombs for a Savior,
but have found no rest, and who have followed, Lo here, and there, in this
grave, and the other Sepulcher, builded on this and that Sand, and still swept
away* Your state I know, you have no peace in the eternal rest, I say unto
you, while you look without you, your eyes may consume in your holes, and your
expectations fail, and you will be still complaining; For your sakes, who are
weary, and have found none to direct your way, A few lines I am moved in
compassion to write, unto you, and if you will not receive it, you will not
believe, if one should rise from the dead, for I have obtained mercy from
Christ: through his free grace who is risen from the dead, and saw no
corruption; by which grace I am saved from sin, and cleansed from
unrighteousness, after long and sore labor and travel, under Pharaoh the
oppressor, from under whose Dominion I am brought to worship the living God, in
Spirit and truth, in his Temple, where he dwells in righteousness for ever.

And for the simples sake, (who have erred for lack of true knowledge, as I did
in times past) I shall declare unto you a little in short of my travells in
Aegypts-Land, where darkness is so thick, that if ye wait but diligently to
see your selves, you will feel it also.

From twelve years old I set my heart to know that God which the world
professed, and which I did read of in the Scripture, which Abraham, Noah,
Moses, and the Prophets, and the rest of the Fathers worshipped, and I did fall
into the strictest worship that was in that part wherein I lived, and often I
desired to be alone, and attended much to reading, and meditation, and then as
I was sober, and serious alone. I began to see that all the sports and
pastimes, and such as youth delights in naturally* were vanity, and they lasted
but for a moment, and while I was in folly and wantonness, doing of them, the
nature which was run into transgression, had pleasure in them, but as soon as I
was come from among them, I was judged in my self, for what I had done, and
often made me weep, then I resolved in my will, that I never would do so
again, and for some time did restrain from the common practice of those
things that I had walked in; but as soon as I came amongst those again, I
acted those things again* which before I did see to be vanity, but long before
that I was checked for many things; and so I walked, often condemned in my
self, when I was serious, and had no peace, and then not knowing what to do
in much sorrow when I was alone, I had a desire to be alone where I might not
hear nor see any folly acted, and did not go to the former exercises,
although some thing in me hanckered after it, but when I yielded not unto it, I
was glad, and had peace, and then I began to oppose my fellows with whom I had
walked in wantonness, and then they began to revile me, and hate me, and
scorn me. Yet notwithstanding I mattered not, then I read much and prayed in
words often, three or four times a day, but I knew not where God was, but in
my imagination, imagined a God at a distance, and so went on; and then I began
to grow in knowledge, without (which is sensual) and then I was puffed up, for
the world admired me; but still I was condemned for vain words and actions,
and the root of iniquity grew in me, and then I followed a more strict course;
and often went five or six miles, to hear some more excellent means (as they
called it) and so did get more words, but still I was the same, nay worse, for
knowledge puffed me up; Then along to about fifteen years of age, I posted up
and down after the most excellent Sermons, so called, and so became acquainted
with all the eminent Christians so called in the region, where I lived, and I
was despised of my parents, and of the world made, and great reproach came upon
me, but still I saw they knew naught, and it was no matter, and so much sorrow
fell upon me, four or five years, and when I was turned within, I was judged
for all myiniquity formerly, and still my heart was showed to me, that it was
corrupt, but as I kept whithin to the light in my conscience, I was restrained
from many actions, which I had a will to do, and in the instant when I have
been doing any unrighteousness in actions or words, in many things I was often
stopped, and when I saw that I did it not, a great joy arose in me, and when I
had done any thing forwardly and rashly, I was judged, but this the teachers
said was a natural conscience that kept from sin, and did restrain it, and
said, he that had but restraining grace, (as they called it) he was but a tame
Devil.

And so I hearkened to their imagination and so slighted the light as too low a
thing, that was but common grace that did preserve out of gross evils, but
the Saints had a peculiar faith and grace; and so I hearkened unto them, and
still I was convinced of sin; and then they told how the Saints did believe in
Christ, and so sin was not imputed, but his righteousness was accounted unto
them, and so I must seek him in the means, as prayer, and receiving the
Sacrament (as they called it) and judged me a worthy communicant: and in great
fear I was that I should eat unworthily, and none could direct me what the
body of Christ was, insomuch at one time I read all the Scripture that spoke of
Christ's suffering. And they said, I must believe he suffered for me; and I
believed all that they called faith, but yet I could not see how he dyed for
me, and had taken away my sin, for the witness in my conscience told me I was
a servant of sin, whilst I committed it. And they told me I must not omit that
Ordinance, for thereby strength was confirmed, and faith added; insomuch, on
the one hand they pressing it as a duty, and on the other hand I saw that the
Scripture said, He that eats unworthily, eats damnation to himself; I was in
fear, notwithstanding none could accuse me without: yet then afterward a great
fear fell upon me, and I thought I had sinned against the Holy Ghost, and great
trouble fell upon me.

Then they said, I had not come prepared; and yet I had all the preparation
that they had spoken of, But still they were all Physicians of no value.

Then I fasted, and prayed, and walked mournfully in sorrow, and thought none
was like me, tempted on every hand; so I ran to this man, and the other, and
they applied promises to me, but it was only words, for the witness of Christ
showed me that the root of iniquity stood, and the body of sin whole;
notwithstanding I was kept by a secret power from gross evils: but still
sorrow compassed me about, and I questioned all that ever I had; which they
said was grace, and repentance, and faith.

And then I told them there was guilt in me: And they said, sin was taken away
by Christ, but the guilt should still remain while I lived, and so brought me
the Saints condititions, who were in the warfare, to confirm it: and so I said
in my self, this was a miserable salvation, that the guilt of sin and
condemnation still in me should stand; and so I was tossed from mountain to
hill: And I heard them preach confusion, and so I matterd not for them, and
said, sure this is not the Ministry of Christ, and so I ceased long by fits and
did not mind them, but kept still at home, and in desert places, sollitary in
weeping; and every thing that I had done was laid before me, insomuch that
every thought was judged, and I was tender, and my heart broken, and when I
could sorrow most I had most peace, for something spoke within me from the
Lord, but I knew him not then.

And they said, that it was heresy to look for the word of the Lord to be
spoken now in these days, but only the letter; and so I regarded it not much:
yet often I was made to do many righteous things by the immediate power and
word of God, and then peace and joy sprung up in me, and promises was spoken,
that he would teach me himself, and be my God; and often I did obey contrary
to my will, and denied my will: but they told me, this was legal to obey out
of fear, and that was slavery; but there was an Evangelicall obedience (as they
called it) so I got above the fear, and yet acted the former things, which they
called Ordinances, and they said that was son-like obedience, and Christ had
done all.

Then there appeared more beauty in them called Independants, and I loved them,
and so joined my self to them, and all the money that I could get I purchased
books with, and walked with (and owned) them as more separate from the world;
and they pressed separation, but at last I saw it was but in words, that they
would do things, and choose officers, and members of themselves, and so made
themselves an Image, and fell down to it; yet there was some tenderness in
them at the first, but the doctrine was the same with the worlds words without,
of others conditions.

Then they whom they called Anabaptists appeared to have more glory, and walked
more according to the Scripture, observing things written without; and I went
among them, and there was something I loved among them; but after they denied
all but such that came into their way, as out of the fellowship of the Saints
and Doctrine of Christ, I saw the ground was the same, and their Doctrine out
of the life with the rest of the Teachers of the world, and had separated
themselves, and made another likeness; but still all said, the letter was the
word and rule, and Christ at a distance without had done all; and some of them
holding freewill others opposing, and all in the will.

But still I loved them that walked honestly amongst all these, but though I
had seen and owned all that I had heard (except the figure which I saw was
outward, and that was their greatest glory; and I saw they would have all fall
down to it, else no communion; in the midst of all these, and much more, which
is death to speak on: but only that all honest hearted may see themselves
where they have rested and also may not trust any more to a reed of Egypt)
after all this no peace nor no guide I found. And then the Doctrine of
freegrace (as they called it) some preached, that all sin was done away, past,
present, and to come, and so preached salvation to the first nature, and to the
Serpent that bore rule, only believing this, and all was finished; to this I
hearkened a little, and so lost my condition within: But still whither ever I
went; this was spoken in me, His servant thou art to whom thou obeyes; and so I
being overcome by sin, I had no justification witnessed in me, but condemnation.

Then some preached Christ within, but they themselves were without, had but
words, and yet they said all must be within (unto which my heart did cleave)
and spoke of redemption, and justification, and all within, and of God
appearing in man, and overcoming the power of the Devils, and then that in my
conscience bore witness it must be so, and I was exceedingly pressed to wait
to find it so, and something breathed after the living God; and a true love I
had to all that walked honestly in what profession soever, and I hated reviling
one another, and that they should smite one another, and persecute one another,
and with the sufferer I always took part: But still I saw though they spoke of
all things within, and of a power to come, that they enjoyed not what they
spoke, for the same fruits was brought forth; till at last, I saw none walked
as the Ministers of Christ, nor none that pretended to the Ministry had any
such gift, neither Pastor, nor Teacher, nor any such Members as was in the
Apostles time.

So at last, having passed up and down, hurried here and there, I saw all the
Teachers of the world, that they sought themselves, and fed poor people with
dead names, and deceit and that they were not the Ministry of Christ: and so I
saw them all in deceit who did not abide in Christ's Doctrine, and so I got my
self quit of most of them, for ever as I dissented from their judgment, they
hated me, and persecuted me.

So at last, there was something revealed in me, that the Lord would teach his
people himself; and so I waited, and many things opened in me of a time at
hand: And sometime I would have heard a Priest, but when I heard him I was
moved by the Lord, and his word in me spoke to oppose, and often as a fire, I
burned, and a trembling fell upon me, yet I feared reproach, and so denied the
Lords motion: and it was revealed in me to wait, and I should know his
counsel, and the word of the Lord was in me, the time was at hand when the
dead should hear the voice of the Son of God, and it burned in me as fire, that
the day was near when it should not be, Lo here, nor there, but all his people
should be taught of the Lord: But still my mind ran out, and out of the fear
into carelessness, for the Cross of Christ I knew not; And yet this I say, I
was wiser then my Teachers I met with in that Generation, I do not glory in
it, for condemnation is past on it all for ever; yet still I had ever as my
mind was turned to the light, pure openings and Prophesies to come, and a
belief that I should see the day, and should bear witness to his name; and so
when things opened so fast, the wisdom of the flesh catched them, and so I
went up and down preaching against all the Ministry; and also run out with that
which was revealed to my self, and preached up and down the country of the
fullness that was in the old bottle, and so was wondered after, and admired by
many who had waded up and down as my self had, and we fed one another with
words, and healed up one another in deceit, and all laid down in sorrow, when
the day of the Lord was made manifest; for I was overthrown, and the foundation
swept away, and all my righteousness and unrighteousness was all judged, and
weighed, and all was found too light.

And immediately as soon as I heard one declare (whose name is not known to the
world, but written in the Lambs book of life for ever) in eternal record for
ever; as soon as I heard him declare that the light of Christ in man was the way
to Christ, I believed the eternal word of truth, and that of God in my
conscience sealed to it; and so not only I, but many hundreds more, who
thirsted after the Lord, but was betrayed by the wisdom of the Serpent, we
were all seen to be of the foundation, and all mouths was stopped in the dust,
and so we stood all as condemned in our selves, and all saw our nakedness and
were all ashamed, though our glory was great in the worlds eye, but all was
vanity.

And then after all this, I was ignorant what the first principle of true
Religion was: but as I turned my mind within to the light of Jesus Christ
wherewith I was enlightened, which formerly had reproved me for all vanity, and
also as I did own it, it led me into righteousness, and when I turned to it I
saw it was the true and faithful witness of Christ Jesus, and then my eyes
was opened, and all things was brought to remembrance that ever I had done,
and the Ark of the Testament was opened, and there was thunder, and lightning
and great hail, and then the trumpet of the Lord was sounded, and then nothing
but war, and rumor of war, and the dreadful power of the Lord fell upon me,
plague, and and pestilerce, and famine, and earthquake, and fear, and terror,
for the sights that I saw with my eyes, and that which I heard with my ears,
sorrow, and pain, and in the morning I wished it had been evening, and in the
evening I wished it had been morning, and I had no rest, but trouble on every
side; and all that ever I had done was judged and condemned; and all things was
accursed, whether I did eat, or drink, or restrain, I was accursed; and then
the Lion suffered hunger, and the Seals were opened, and seven thunders uttered
their voices; mine eyes were dim with crying, my flesh did fail of fatness,
my bones were dried, and my sinnews shrunk: I became a proverb to all, yea to
them who had been mine acquaintance, they stood afar off me; the pillars of
Heaven was shaken, and the earth reeled as a cottage; one woe poured out after
another. And I sought death in that day, and could not find it, it fled from
me, and I sought to cover my self any way, or with any thing, but nothing
could, for the indignation of the Lord was upon the Beast and the false
Prophet; and Babylon came into remembrance in that day, the mother of harlots,
and the Sea dried up, and all the Merchants that had traded with her stood asar
off, for the cup of fury was poured forth, and Cain was seen, and Judas that
had betrayed the Lord of life: and I would have run any way to have hid my
self, but nothing but weeping and gnashing of teeth, and sorrow, and terror,
and I roared out for the disquietnesse of my heart, and the kingdom was full
of darkness, I knew not the right hand from the left, I became a perfect fool,
and knew nothing, and as a man distracted; all was overturned, and I suffered
loss of all: in all that ever I did, I saw it was in the accursed nature, and
then something in me cried, Just and true is his judgment, my mouth was stopped,
I durst not make mention of his name, I knew not God, and as I bore the
indignation of the Lord, something rejoiced, the Serpents head began to be
bruised, and the Witnesses which were slain, were raised, and stopped Heaven
that it rained not in the days of their Prophecy, and a great samine there
was; and the Sun was darkened, and the Moon turned into blood, and the Stars did
fall, and all the grass of the earth withered, and every green tree, and all
the springs were dried up, and a great and a noisome smell, and a plague fell
upon the earth, and the waters became as the blood of a dead man, and the
Heavens passed away with a noise, and the Elements melted, and the earth was
scorched with the flame which proceeded from the Throne of God, and the
Judgment Seat of Christ was seen, and an account was to be given, and then
Esau was cursed, and Cain, and Judas, and Ishmael, and all the Cananites, and
the Egyptians, went to the left hand, and as the Judgment was pronounced,
something cried, Just art thou oh Lord in all thy judgments; and as I did give
up all to the Judgment, the captive came forth out of prison and rejoiced, and
my heart was filled with joy, and I came to see whom I had pierced, and my
heart was broken, and the blood of the Prophets I saw slain, and a great
lamentation; and then I saw the Cross of Christ, and stood in it, and the
enmity slain upon it, and the new man was made, and so peace came to be made,
and so eternal life was brought in through death and judgment, and then the
perfect gift I received which was given from God, and the holy Law of God was
revealed unto me, and was written in my heart, and his fear and his word which
did kill now makes alive; and so it pleased the Father to reveal his son in me
through death, and so I came to witness cleansing by his blood which is
eternal, Glory unto him for ever, and am a Minister of that word of eternal
life which endures for ever, Glory unto his name for ever, and have rest and
peace in doing the will of God, and am entered into the true rest, and lie down
in the fold with the lambs of God, where the Sons rejoice together, and the
Saints keep holy day, Glory unto him for ever.

And these few things have I written for your sakes who walk in darkness, that
you may see where you are; and also ye high Cedars, who trust in the arm of
flesh, that you may cease your boasting and com^ down from off the pinnacle
where you are exalted, for the same must come upon you, if ever the Lord you
know in truth and righteousness, even through the death of things, in the
curse of all knowledge and wisdom which is from below; yea, through the death
of death that rules in you, which must be slain upon the Cross of Christ
Jesus if ever you come to true peace and witness eternal salvation.

And therefore, Cease you Diviners, and Imaginers, who have feigned a faith,
and a Christ, and a salvation in your imaginations, and yet that you may live
in the lust and filth of the world and the customs and fashions which perish.
I say, your expectations shall fail, and you will lie down in sorrow, for
where salvation is witnessed, the life of Christ is witnessed, but you would
have salvation, and the life of the Devil brought forth and lived in.

But unto all such I say, This will be your sentence, Depart into the lake:
Therefore take warning, for it is not your good words without the life of
godliness nor your swelling speeches that is accepted with God, for he accepts
nothing but what is of himself, and by him wrought in the creature by his own
will and power; and this destroys the carnal will and power and
righteousness; and this work which he works of himself and by his power and
in his Covenant is perfect and is accepted of God, and so its no more the
creature but Christ who is all in his Saints, and so he brings all that follow
him out of the works of condemnation (which is acted in the disobedient nature,
and is accursed whether praying or plowing, or whatsoever while Cain lives,
which is in the banishment out of the acceptance of God) and all who follow him
who is the light, and leads all that believe and follow him into the living
works of righteousness wrought by Christ through faith, and is accepted and
well pleasing unto God, and here all boasting is excluded for all is of him,
and from him that works both the will and the deed, and here the Lord is
admired in all his works, and his works praise him.

Wherefore all honest hearted, who travells and are weary and have found no
rest for your souls, I say unto you, Arise, and come away, lie not grovelling
in the earth like Moses, nor seek not to know God in your fallen wisdom, for
the well is deep, and if you know nothing but the old wisdom, which is
corrupt and natural, you cannot come to one drop of the living water;
therefore dwell no longer among the graves, and Tombs, where the unclean
spirits dwell, which troubles and vexes all that passes in their way, neither
dwell among the pits where there is no water, he is risen, he is not there,
look upward, mind that which draws you from the earth, the Covenant of life is
made manifest, Glory unto him in the highest; his Proclamation is, Ho, every
one that thirsts, come freely and receive of him freely, without money or
price, or any thing of yours, or self, nay, self must be denied, and that you
must deny if you will receive of him, that he may be all, and you nothing, for
he gives freely, and his gift is perfect, and pure, without spot, stain, or
mixture, and all that receive his gift, comes by it to be presented perfect to
the father.

And this is making manifest to you also, who wait upon him, who is given for a
Covenant of light, and peace, and life, and all that receive this gift, shall
come to hear glad tidings, peace on earth, and good will to you, as you turn to
the light, and this shall be preached in you, by him who is the anointed of
God, and the messenger of the Covenant, and is sent to preach to the spirits in
prison, and to open the blind eyes, and to set open the prison door, that the
Prisoner may come forth, out of the mire and clay, to follow and wait upon him
who is the Rock of this age, and all ages, in which all the fathers believed,
and were justified, and did eat and drink of this Rock, and this Rock was and
is Christ Jesus, the light of the world, and has enlightened every one that
comes into the world, with his true light.

Therefore I say unto you who looks after righteousness, come hither, who are
weary, and I will show you where you may have true everlasting rest, which he
has shed abroad in my heart by his free grace, and everlasting love made
manifest, after a long and a dark night, in which I passed without a guide, and
so fell into the pit, and stumbled, and then sorrow and trouble compassed me
about on every side, as an armed man, but now has he shed abroad his grace in
my heart, which saves me from sin, and leads out of the works of condemnation,
into his habitation, where no unclean thing can enter; and this grace has
separated me from sin, and has constrained me to deny my self, and follow him
through the death of the Cross, and through the denial of all both Country
and Nation, kindreds and tongues and people, and from wife and children, and
houses and lands, to publish his name abroad contrary to my own will, and to
make known unto you the riches of his grace, which all that wait in the light
of Christ Jesus shall come to see, and so you may see him whom your souls loves
and longs after, which has long breathed after refreshment, but none could
speak a word in season to your condition.

Return home again, ye that in your seeking have sought among the lead, and
joined your selves to strangers, and have get nothing but a husk, a shadow, and
live in a dream, you are further off, in running out, and seeking in your
earthly wisdom and comprehension, then you were before, and has got nothing
but a report of what Christ said, and did, and how they worshipped him, and so
while your eyes have been without, you never found him whom the Saints, and all
that knew him worshipped in spirit, and witnessed him their salvation in them,
and was their hope, and the ground of their hope was manifest in them; and he
that manifested his love in them then, and was their redeemer, he changes not,
but is the same to his seed for ever. And all who waits in the light of Christ,
the measure of God in you, this shall come to see.

Now therefore every one that thirsts, come unto Christ Jesus, which is near
you, and wait to know his word in you, which it in the heart, which faith comes
by the Preaching of it in you, as you diligently wait, and keep your minds unto
it; and this which shows you sin and evil, is in you, and makes manifest all
that you have acted contrary unto it, yea, even all that ever you have done,
and will search your hearts, and is the eye that sees the deceit in all its
transforming in you; and it will let you see, it has often checked and called,
but you have not answered its call, and so has chosen your own way, and so
has gone from the way, which is the light of Christ in you, and so you run
into the broad way; and that which desired after God, has not been nourished,
and fed, but has been famished, and another has been fed, which now is for
the slaughter. But now as ye return home to within, to the true light of Jesus,
which is that one thing, which leads all men that own it, to be guided by it to
true rest and peace.

Now friends, there is something in man which must receive Christ, something of
his own (learn what it is) which he comes to, and nothing can he join with, or
be joined unto, but that which is pure and undefiled; for the pure in heart
sees God, and not the mortal mind, that despises his glory; for to that mind
that hunts abroad, he does not reveal himself, that is Esau, the blessing is
nothing to him, nor that which the Covenant of God is with* the Election he
hates, and to him its of no price, nor value, that is the profane person, and
Judas that betrays him, sells him for a thing of naught, nor the Pearl is
nothing to the Swine, now read within, every one, you that are painted with the
attire of the Harlot, trimmed and made beautiful in the eyes of the
Egyptians, this is a small thing to you, and to that seed which the promise is
to, and the Covenant established with, is trodden upon, and is famished in the
streets of Sodom and Egypt, where Christ was, and is slain, and his
witnesses suffers in the streets, and none has compassion, is this thing
nothing to you, all ye that pass by, to slight the love of the father in
sending his Son a light to you, and him you despise; and as the Pharisees could
not own him, they put the time far off, and so do you, and cannot own that of
him in you, to be lead by it, and so follows strangers, and still are
complaining, and puts redemption to another world, and so Satan has deceived
you in looking abroad, and therefore that at home is of no price unto you, and
so you run away from the drawing of the father, and from his dwelling, where
the least in his house has bread enough; but to the carnal mind, which is at
enmity with God, who seeks him in the fallen wisdom, he is of no value, and
that which was the Saints Rule is too low for you, and yet you say the Sons of
God are lead by his Spirit. Now I say, where does the Spirit speak? does it not
bear witness either with or against our Spirits? and so all men's spirits, and
so that nature in you which is one with the Serpent, and nourishes the Harlot,
is exalted, and lives, and has pre-eminence, and yet you will talk of being
reconciled unto God. Now consider, while you stand not in the Council of God
within, and wait to hear his word, you know not the word of Reconciliation, for
he takes none into union with himself, but they that follow him, and does what
he commands, and are his fruit and offspring. And therefore, O foolish and
unwise, how long will you feed on a dream that you are saved, when your
rebellion is open to your own sight? To that of God in your consciences I speak.

All therefore, that see your darkness that you lie in, return home, and that
which is low, mind, the meek spirit, and be not forward nor rash, but stand
still in quietness and meekness, that the still voice you may hear which till
you come down low within, you cannot hear; for the loud voices of the
Egyptians and Inchanters is so many, and Pharaohs voice, and Herod's is so
loud, and you whose minds are abroad, you think as they thought its the voice
of God. But I say be still, he shall not cry, nor lift up his voice in the
streets who you must hearken unto, in you, that your souls may live, and so be
low and still if you will hear his voice, and wait to hear that speak that
separates betwixt the precious and the vile. Now that which you must wait in,
is near you, yea in you, the eye that sees, and the ear that hears that, is
of the Lord, for that which is visible, is natural and carnal, and the
natural ear cannot hear the word of the spiritual God, for that which
hearkens without, that ear must be deaf, and that eye blind. Now that which
reveals the pure spiritual God must be in you pure and spiritual; for none
knows the things of God, but by the Spirit of God, and did not his Spirit bear
witness always unto their spirits? and does it not so now to all that know
him? So in the light wait which comes from God, who is light, and dwells in the
immortal light, which the mortal eye cannot behold, and it will lead you to
know Christ who is immortal, and not carnal, but spiritual and eternal. And
as you love the light, and keep your minds inward, then you will hear the
motion of Christ Jesus in you; and so loving it, the good you will come to see
from God, which will lead out of sin, and sanctify you, and the acceptable
year you will see, and the day of vengeance, and this is he whom the father
has given for a Covenant, to bring man out of the alienation to himself again
and to reconcile man unto himself even by the blood of the Cross; and he who
is the light is the Covenant; and he who is the Covenant is the light, for they
are one in him; and this Covenant of peace is tendered unto you who are afar
off: And herein is the eternal love of God made manifest to the Jew and the
Greek, and the life of his Son to be the light of the world, and of men; and
so in the Covenant of light abide, and you will see he is near you, the
Peacemaker, the gift of God which presents you perfect in himself to the
father, and this gift is free, and offered freely, to all that will receive it;
and yet you cannot receive the gift in your own wills, but through the denial
of your own wills, for the light is contrary to the will; and so you will see
the will of the earthly man and Gods will contrary, and as you receive the will
of God, you deny your own wills, and so does the will of another, and another
guides you, and leads you, and this is Gods alone work, not of your selves, but
wrought by Christ, in his own way and truth and so the Covenant of God comes
to be established to the seed, and the foundation stands sure, and his promise
is fulfilled in you, as you come to witness the seed which is one, in whom the
promise is fulfilled.

And friends, Thus must you wait to have judgment set up within you and this
is he who is the Judge and the light of the world; and so wait to see the Law
set up within, which is added because of transgression to cut down, and the
unjust destroyed in you, and the rebellious nature yoaked, which has had its
liberty in the earthly, where the Beasts of the field dwells, and so it will
come to decay and the Law works wrath upon the deceit in you, which has had
pre-eminence, and so you will see the thunder as the Seal is opened, and the
earthquakes, and lightning, insomuch as you cannot behold and live. But the
transgressor, and the transgression, which is contrary to the Law is cut down,
and when there is a time of great sorrow, and great trouble, and trial, and
temptation, wait in patience in the judgment, and let the Lords work have its
perfect operation in you, and so as you turn unto him that has smitten and
wounded you, he will bind up and heal, and give up all to the great slaughter
of the Lord unto the Cross, all that which is discovered by the pure Law of
God; and as the earth comes to be plowed up, the seed which is sown comes up,
and the Rocks broken, the water gusheth out, and so you will see some promises
will arise in you, to the seed which is coming up out of the grave, and so the
love of God will appear in you, and you will be stayed, and see hope in the
midst of calamity.

Then take heed that the Serpent get not that which is to the Babe, and so the
carnal come to be exalted; but as you wait, you will see the subtilty of the
Enemy; and sin and death rules till Moses, who was a faithful servant in his
house, and brings to the Law of God revealed in you, then sin comes to be
crucucified, and to loose its dominion over you, and in you, and so you will
see one brought forth under the Law, who fullfilled the Law, and now fullfills
it in all those who walk after him in the spirit, and fullfills not the desires
of the flesh and wait, and you will see some Prophecies opened in you, and the
day star in your hearts, which leads to where Christ is, and openings of the
inheritance which is to be received, and the promise is to the seed. And all
wait in the light, and keep in your minds to it and you will see John's
Ministry, the water which washes, and he is the preparer of the way, and turns
to God, lest he smite the earth with a curse, and his Ministry breaks down the
mountains, and removes them, and makes a plain way, and your minds being
turned to the Lord, and as you own the gift of Christ given you, repentance you
will see, unto life, and then you will see something arising and shine in you,
opening your hearts, and there will be a breathing after the Lord and his
righteousness, and standing in obedience in the Cross, the veil you will see
rent, and you will see him that has turned you from sin by his free gift made
manifest in you; and he which is the gift saves you from sin, and so the seals
will be opened by the Angel of the Covenant, and the Lamb. So all in patience
wait, and keep in the living principle of life, and things will open in you,
even the dark sayings of old; and that which spoke Parables to the Serpents
seed, will open the Parables to his own seed, then you will see him whom you
have pierced, even the Lamb who has been slain since the foundation of the
world, and your hearts will be boken, and water will gush out of the Rock* and
so love will increase in you, who abide faithful in your measure, and the good
and perfect gift of God will be made manifest in you, and the hope upon which
the soul comes to be anchored, will come to be witnessed, which hope purifies
the heart; and as you stand in the perfect Law of liberty revealed in you
revealed by the Spirit which cuts down the oppressor, and gives liberty to his
seed, unto which the Covenant is, and the promises for ever; and this seed
Christ took, and takes upon him to redeem, even the seed of Abraham, unto whom
the promise was made; and so wait, that the pure Law of righteousness, which
is life to the righteous, and so the seed may be set up, and you will see all
chained under, and this binds and fetters the unclean spirits, and shuts up
them into utter darkness for ever.

And as you come to be redeemed from under the bondage of sin, and come above
the bonds of death, and the pure principle lives in you, there will be a
delight in you to do the will of the father, who has redeemed you from sin
and its Law, unto righteousness and its Law. And all who hunger and thirst
after righteousness, wait in that which thirsts, that the gift you may
receive, which perfects for ever them that receive it, and believe in it, and
cleanses and purges you from unrighteousness; and this being revealed in
you, as you obey it, it leads to true peace, and will reveal in you the
immortal seed which came not by the will of man, but is contrary, and revealed
out of man's will which all must witness to be born of, that inherits the
Kingdom of God; and this is he who is begotten of the incorruptible seed,
which the promise is unto, and are in him fullfilled Yea, and Amen, come out of
time before all time, the Son of God, which leads out of time; and this is he
whom the father revealed in Paul; and this is he of whom I am a witness, in
whom I have redemption by the blood of the Cross, and he is my Sanctification,
Justification, and Wisdom, who is the Son of God, who came to do his fathers
will, and now does, where he is witnessed, who by his eternal word of life
has begotten me, and made me a partaker of his eternal inheritance which
never fades away; Glory unto him for evermore, who is life, and translateth all
that believes and follow him in the work of Regeneration unto his Kingdom.

So silence all you Diviners and Sorcerers for ever, who believe with a faith,
and teach a faith, that none can be ever cleansed from sin while they are here,
you and your faith is denied, for it is not the same which was once delivered
to the Saints, which gave them victory over the world, and by which they
overcame. Paul a Minister of Christ by the will of God, said, the Colossions
were translated into the kingdom of God, where nothing that is imperfect can
come or enter, your preaching is vain, your hope and faith is vain, and all
your hearing is vain, while the perfect gift of God is not witnessed, nor the
everlasting offering which perfects for ever them that are sanctified by him,
even by his word of life and his will, which sanctifies and makes perfect the
comers thereunto, and presents all that believe and receive him without spot.

And therefore all you that love the Lord, and wait for the coming of the
kingdom of Christ, feed no longer upon imaginations nor vain words; cease
from looking, lo here and there, for the kingdom of God will the Father
reveal in you, as you wait in the measure of the light in you, by which he
reveals himself in his sons and daughters, and will bring them to his
everlasting fold and true rest, all who follows him through the denial of
all, and to the loosing of all for him, shall come to witness an incorruptible
inheritance, which never fades away.

And now a few words to you who would thrust your selves into the kingdom, and
would be called Christ's Disciples, and Church members, who are gathered into
confederacies, and makes a likeness unto your selves, and are now professing
the Saints conditions in words. How come you hither, to climb up so high in
words, when as you are what you were before, if not worse? Think it not a hard
saying, for it is so among many of you, and in the light which is pure you are
weighed, and when one comes to try you your language bewrays you that you are
not what you profess, for when you are tried by the Saints practices and life
that was in them, and the enjoyment they had with God, you are found so far
from being any such that you even oppose the faith they believed in: as some of
your Pastors openly to my face in the hearing of two hundred people, said, all
the Saints dyed sinners, and so was so far from owning the perfect
righteousness of Christ that he even denied it and said it was heresy; and
others of you say, you believe that all the graces the Saints enjoy are
imperfect, yea even faith is imperfect; and others saying, that all the
righteousness that was wrought in them by faith was imperfect; and others
saying, while the light of Christ Jesus condemned them, yet Christ justified
them, and yet that which was wrought in them there was failings in it, and so
you have imagined a faith and righteousness of your own, and such a Christ to
talk on, and a redemption as you may live in lusts, and be men pleasers, and in
the customs and fashions of the world, and coveteousnesse, and pleads for sin,
and puts perfect righteousness to another world, and thus the Devil has
deceived you, and so you set up, and makes covers, but all will not hide you in
the day of his appearance, for God joins not to that which is imperfect,
neither is that true faith which is imperfect and which lays hold upon an
imperfect righteousness, that is such a faith as never was professed by any of
the Saints, whose words you profess, for they had received faith the gift of
God, the least measure of which was perfect, and as they stood in it, though it
was but as a grain of Mustard Seed, they said to this mountain be removed and
it was so; and that which was in them reveald by the Son, led them that did
believe in it to lay hold upon Christ's righteousness, which was and is perfect,
which had (yea has) no spots, nor wrinckles, nor stain, and this
righteousness was made manifest in them by the faith of the Son, by which they
were justified in the sight of God, and came with boldness before the throne
of Christ, for in them there was no condemnation, neither guilt, but became one
with the Judge, and reconciled unto him and his throne, and to the Lamb by him
who is the Midiator, and has made peace betwixt them and the Father, and so
were justified in the sight of God, and this witness they had in them, that
they pleased God, and were accepted of God, and this righteousness was wrought
in them, and is now the same which is wrought in the Saints, by him who is
their light and life, and this was the righteousness of faith, and that which
was wrought by Christ in the Saints, as they believed in him, and in the
measure of grace received from him, which saved them from sin, which was not
of themselves, he perfected his own work in them, through and by faith, and
justified them, and sanctified them and became their vvisdome, by which they
were led into all truth, out of failings and imperfection; and weaknesses,
and he became their strength and rock and they were builded upon him, and as
they stood upon him the rock, they were preserved when the waves did beat,
and when temptations came, and were sure and steadfast, and immovable, and so
overcame the Armies of Aliens, and quenched the violence of fire, and resisted
the Devil, and quenched his fiery darts, and had victory over the Heathen, and
reigned as Kings over the Beasts of the field, and over the deceit, and by the
receiving and believing of the word of him, who was and is called Jesus, by
which faith came by the hearing of, they overcame the enemies of their souls,
and him who has the power of death: and the strength of sin is the Law* but by
the blood of him who is eternal, who is Jesus the Midiator of the new and
living way, they overcame the Dragon, even by the word of his testimony, which
was revealed in them; which word of faith Paul who was a Minister preached
unto them, even to them who had the word in them and turned them to it, and
as they believed in it, they were sanctified by it, and cleansed by it, and
made perfect, and then they witnessed the bringing in of a better hope, which
perfects and makes perfect as pertaining to the conscience, which while they
stood without, looking at Elementary things, and diverse washings, and those
things which were figures of the true Tabernacle made without hands which stood
until the time of Reformation, and then done away, to wit the hand writings,
and them that witnesses the new Covenant now, they see them done away, and the
time of Reformation is come, the same which they witnessed, Glory for evermore.

And therefore all you professors, who have builded high Towers and Castles in
your imaginations, and has told of Reformation these many years; but you have
nothing but a handwriting to establish your building upon, and all your
Reformation has been but the washing of cups, and pulling down one thing, and
set up another beggarly Elementary Images and do not witness the better hope
brought in, nor the time of Reformation, nor cannot abide that any should
declare it unto you, nor believe it, nor hear it, nor while your eyes are
without and not in the head you cannot see when good comes, but are as Heathens
in the desert, and although you are among the brambles and briars, yet you
would be counted Kings and Heads over others, and one making an Image in this
manner, and another in that, of all sorts high and low, but all stands in the
earth, and all in one ground, and what do they avail you? for they cannot
save, for your highest enjoyment is imperfect (you say) what then serve these
for? only for you to talk on, and this is all they serve for, and to contend
and strive about one with another, and all in your wills, while the will of God
in you is not hearkened unto, but cast behind your backs, and so the way of true
peace you never come to attain unto.

Oh, when will you be weary of feeding upon the wind, and of husks among swine,
and upon that which dies of it self? and when will you enquire after the
living God who is power? how long have you talked of his power to come many
years? and you are still as far off, if not further than you were before, and
has told of the glory of the Lord to be revealed, and of his Law being written
in the heart, and of God teaching his people himself, and of his Spirit being
poured out upon his sons and daughters, and you cannot see that you have
obtained nothing; and you have prayed, and what have you obtained nothing? for
you have asked amiss, and one comes hungry, and is still complaining, and then
you that are full feeds them with the old dregs and lees which you are settled
upon, and the old leaven of aerie notions, and conceptions, and wine of the
sour grape, which sets on edge the childrens teeth and fills them to full,
that when the living bread is broken, they cannot eat nor relish it nor taste,
and so cannot enter your selves, nor suffer others to enter, and when these
things are witnessed in the life which you have talked on so long, you cannot
own them that does declare it, and when the power of God is declared unto you
what it is, and where it is to be waited for, you cannot own it, this is too
low for you and except the Lord will come in your way, that you prescribe unto
him, you will not look upon him, but as the Jews did whose eyes were without,
and your fallen wisdom cannot receive him, nor compass his eternal wisdom.

And yet you will say, the Jews did require a sign, and were in the adultery;
and the Greeks sought after wisdom, and they stumbled: and yet you cannot see
your selves in the same state: Did ever God reveal himself to the fallen
wisdom, which is learned from that principle which is erred and gone out from
God? or to the will of man which is at enmity against God? Nay, nay, He never
did, nor will reveal his counsel, but to that which is of himself, which is
the least of all seeds in the world, and it is he that is borne of God, that
hears Gods word, and what is borne of the Spirit is Spirit, and is nourished
by the Spirit, and led by it, and so the spiritual God reveals his Law and his
Statutes to him, and his testimony which is sure. How long have you talked of
the Spirit, and worshipping in Spirit? and yet indeed denies its leading and
teaching, and lives in the oldnesse of the letter, and crying up, and setting
up things that are carnal, and visible, and Elementary, and washing is not
known from sin, nor cleansing; and so you may see what operation your Spirit
you have talked on, has, when you are still what you were.

Now the Spirit of God is operative, and works a change in the ground, and
translateth all that follow and hearken unto it into its own nature, when all
those things you so much strive about were but a shadow, for the word was in
the beginning and gave life, and is spiritual, and when its known and
witnessed within in the heart, it separates from death and gives life to all
that hear it and believe in it: What Christ is this you preach? and what Gospel
is this you preach which saves you not from guilt and condemnation? for the
word of the true Christ where it is owned, cleanses and takes away sin,
and condemns it, and blots it out, and destroys the root from whence it flovvs
forth, and works a new creation, in righteousness, and the Lamb of God takes
away sin, in which the Churches of Christ believed, and is glad tidings to all
that do receive it: now none can witness gladness of soul where there is guilt,
which (you all affirm) is in every Christian, while in this world, and so you
might see that its not the true Christ nor the everlasting Gospel you preach,
but this you cannot bear: Yet you say, he has taken away your sin; How much is
sin taken away? if you say all, how comes the guilt and trouble that is in you?
for if it be taken away, and his justice satisfied, this were to make God
unjust to charge it upon you again: But I tell you when his witness in your
conscience convinces you, and manifests unto you that you commit it, and
reproves for it, I say, you cannot witness his justice satisfied, for the
light is just, which is one with God, and when this condemns you, there is no
God that will justify you: But you use to say, Its all done in Christ; I ask,
where? if it be not taken away, and unless you have the witness of it in you,
your faith is vain; for he that believes has the witness in himself, which
none has who walks contrary unto the light the pure witness of Christ, for
this convinces you of sin, and bears witness against you: Now show your
witness within you, and your assurance; I say unto you, while the testimony of
Jesus bears testimony against you it bears not witness unto you, and so see
your confusion. But after you have believed in Christ (as you say) and have
received all his Ordinances, if any thing after did judge you and bring trouble
upon you, this you used to call a temptation, and so put light for darkness,
and darkness for light; I say, there is no guilt where sin is taken away, and
crucified, but peace and rest in the holy God, who is unchangeable, and so is
his witness unchangeable, which judges and condemns the changeable. But you
use to say, His love is unchangeable, and whom he loves once, he loves to the
end; Yea, but it is him who is begotten by the immortal word, which was in the
beginning, and which word leads to the beginning again, before the Hatred was,
the Promise is to this seed, not seeds as to many, but the seed of the
Covenant, there he loves from the womb, yea, the womb that bears the seed of
Jacob, and the paps that gives them suck, and where this is known, as to
enjoyment, Esau is cast out, and Ishmael, and the seed of Abraham inherits the
Promise, and Edom and Moab is laid wast, and Amaleck is slain by the edge of
the sword, and the seed of evil doers cut off, blessed are they that can
witness this in truth, and till this be known, the everlasting love of God is
not known, which is stronger then death, and sin is death, and where it is
acted and conceived, love is not witnessed, nor its strength, but wrath comes
upon the Children of disobedience, and are you not Children of disobedience
while you break the holy Law of God, in which is power, which is in the heart,
and it bears witness against you, and in you, and yet say you cannot believe
that ever you shall be able to fulfill it; if you fulfill it not, you break
it, and then the wrath abides upon you. But then you say, if we must fulfill
the Law, what use is Christ of? I say, he who abides for ever, fulfilled it*
and fulfills it in them who know him and his work, and this the Scriptures
bears witness of, and herein man comes to be jufied in Gods sight, by Christ,
who works all our works in us, and for us, and self becomes dead, and because
he lives, we live also, Glory unto him for ever. And therefore we cannot but
lay open the deceit of Satan, and exhort all to come up to Christ out of the
works of condemnation.

Oh foolish people and unwise! when will ye seek after wisdom, and hearken
that your souls may live? How long will ye trust to the imaginations of your
own hearts? Verily verily, I say unto you, The time is coming your building
shall fall, and there shall not one stone be left upon another that shall not
be thrown down, and the shame of Ethiopia and Egypt shall come upon you, and
your old Garments shall be torn off you, and you shall walk naked and bare, and
shall see your shame, and the holy Nation of the Lamb shall rejoice, and your
sorrow the Lord hastens upon you, who will not own the Cross of Christ, nor
the word of life, which would turn you from unrighteousness, and out of the
world, and its nature* but you harden your hearts, and bend your brows, and
shoot your Arrows against the Lord, and his Anointed ones, and takes part with
all the uncircumcised in the Nations, in the confederacy in the Nation against
the Lamb, yea even with them against whom you your selves have declared, and
many of you who have been a reproach, now reproach. O, tell it not in Gath,
never let it come to other Nations. Shame, shame, and blush at this, you who
thus requite the Lord evil for good: Has the Lord broken the band of the
oppressor without? And have you not seen the hand of the Lord against them that
were oppressors, cut off in his wrath, and overthrown? And are not many of you
the highest professors both in England and Ireland, now acting in their
footsteps? Even you who profess separation from the world, who has been taken
from the sheepfold, and as you were seeking the Asses, and raised from a low
estate in the World now to places of dignity and honor, and to bear Rule, and
to sit as Judges among the people; and now have you forgotten that you were
servants under Pharaoh, but now has taken up his power; and have forgot the
afflictions of Joseph, and your fingers is becoming heavier then your fathers
loins, and now you are joining your strength with the Canaanites and
Egyptians, against the Lord. Where is the liberty of tender consciences you
have told of? And what is become of your Reformation? Is it ended in this, like
Absalom, when you are come to be Judges in the Gate, acts in open Rebellion
against the Lord, and now would be Judges of him every where, and would limit
him* and set a bound unto him, and would break his eternal Decree, which
stands for ever. Oh, if them who had professed no love to God had done thus, it
might have been born, but ye treacherous hearts, your ingratitude and
hypocrisy cannot be born, but the Lord God will visit for these things; that
you should now act by those Laws which you cried out of as oppressive, and
should deliver your brethren up to the devourer and spoyler, who have born a
part of the suffering in the Nations distress and grief, in the greatest
calamity, would you thus be done by? would you bear it well? I will not
complain, but I will show you the ground, and lay it before you, that if it be
possible, you may be ashamed and repent, lest the Lord also avenge himself upon
you, as he did upon the enemies before you.

Have not many of you in England been acting in the steps of the profane? when
the Lord has given you what you sought after, liberty and freedom in those
things; and now you labor by all your strength and power to oppress them who
walk blameless before the Lord and men also. Oh, what? is all your preaching,
and praying, and fighting, and warring come to this, that none must declare the
mind of the Lord, except it be in your way, or will, or time, under pain of
bonds, and banishment fines and imprisonment, stocking, whipping, stoning? and*
you that have been sufferers your selves, now comes to be chief oppressors and
opposers of the Lord in his way, and all manner of lies and reproaches you cast
upon the truth, and you take part with the rest of the Priests and deceivers in
the Nation, which take part against you when you was for the Lord, and numbers
us among transgressors, of every hand to make the truth odious to all. These
things and much more are found among you, from the least to the greatest, and
yet you would be accounted Christians; and if you say, you have thus learned
Christ, I say you know him not: Can you limit the Ocean from flowing? or can
you command the wind that it blow not? or can you stop the windows of Heaven
that it rain not upon the Earth? if you cannot at all do it all, lie down, he
that reproves God let him answer it: Have you given counsel to the Lord? or
have you been his Instructor? or can you limit him in his way? if you cannot,
no more shall you be able to stop his way, who is riding on in his power, and
overturns all the worlds wisdom, and power, and strength, and who is able to
resist him, who dryes up the face of the deep and says to the Sea, be still,
and to the mountains be removed, and they are so; and he will advance his
own glory and power against all men's wills and Laws, which stands in man's
will, and will break all your cords as a Bullrush, and overthrow all your
counsel, and make it even with the earth, and shame shall cover all his
opposers, and therefore learn wisdom, Oh ye Potsheards of the earth, and
cease to strive against the Lord, and his power which will be too strong for
you, and you shall not be able to limit him, nor stop him in his way, who runs
his course as a Giant, and bruises all his enemies heads, and cuts them in
piece by the two edged sword of his mouth, which he has put into the bands of
his Saints who follow him in the War, and our conquest is through suffering,
Glory unto him for ever, who has counted us worthy to suffer for his names
sake, and to be brought before Rulers and Councels for his names sake that the
Scripture might be fullfilled in us in this day, as it was upon our Brethren
who went before us.

And Oh ye Rulers and Officers of Ireland, who have been Professors and
affecters of liberty, and for suppressing of Tyranny, behold now the Lord has
sent to try you, and you are found in the same footsteps when you are tried, as
them that the Lord cast out before you; and in the nature of the chief Priests,
and Elders, and Councels, who breaths out threatenings, and sends out your
Warrants, and Inquisitions to bind all, and to send up all bound too, before
you, that so evil (you say) may be prevented in time, and takes reports from
the Priests and false Prophets of the Nations, who are liars, evil Beasts,
whose mouths the Lord will stop, and bring shame upon; who are flatterers, and
have flattered the Powers and Rulers before you, till they were all cut off,
and now they flatter you, and cannot hold up their Divination without you help
them, what Gospel is this they Preach? when a few poor despised people, who are
hated of the World, that the sound of them makes them afraid, Oh that ever you
should be so ignorant to join to Baal, but let him plead for himself and they
stand by their God, and their Gospel, and if they be not able to defend
themselves, let them perish, let them perish. But them who comes in their own
name, you receive but them who comes in the name of the Lord, and seeks none of
your Tithes, nor Augmentations, nor your advance, them you cannot bear should
be in the Nation, who are not troublesome to any, nor desires to eat any man's
bread for naught, and these you call of an evil life. And men who have
devoured their own estates and others also, and drunkards, and all manner of
unclean persons, these may have liberty. Oh, do you think that he sees not
your doings, and will call you to an account for these things? and you must
know our Country and calling, I say unto you who live in envy and wrath, if we
declare unto you, ye cannot believe; but God gives no account of his matters
unto man, where do ye read, O ye foolish people, and slow to believe, but
that the Ministers of Christ were called out from their outward employments,
into the Lords Vineyard, contrary to their own wills, and were Ministers
contrary to the will of man, and did mind the Calling of God to his own work,
both the Prophets, and Apostles, and Ministers of Christ; and also they
Preached the Gospel who were never Church Officers in all their lifetime, as
you may see, Acts 8. 4. But you say that was in a time of persecution. And
what is this time? How many has been persecuted from Town to Town, from
City to City, put in Prison, haled out of the Synagogues? as most part of the
Nation of England can witness.

And you in Ireland are follovving your Leaders who are in this Generation,
and fills up your measure also; but persecution was ever blind.

But you say, They suffered for well doing, but we justly. Let that in your
consciences be Judge; Would you not have judged Paul as you do us, who went
into the Synagogues on Sabbath day, and disputed, and in the Markets daily; and
Christ who was their example, and ours also, in the Synagogues he taught, and
in ships, and Towns, and Villages, and Deserts, and wandered up and down, and
the Ministers of Christ had no certain dewlling place, and the multitudes that
followed them, would you not have said, These men are evil livers? Your
Generation said so then, and that they were sowers of sedition and Heresy, and
Ringleaders of sects, and setters forth of strange Gods, and were accused to be
the disturbers of the peace, and were in tumults often, as we have been; and
they said, that they were not worthy to live, and now the same you say.

Instance is, a Warrant given out at Dublin in December, 1655 to fetch up, and
send up bound to Dublin, all that are called Quakers, and all these things and
much more, you who (...)s as Rulers and Judges of the Nation of Ireland, (...)
upon us, and has required the Justices every (...) us on these things, and to
lay to our (...), and what testimony we have, or letters of recommendation, (I
say) what testimony had the Ministers of Christ, from the Rulers or high
Priests then, they were false Apostles which were made by man's will, and the
Apostle said, Need we Letters of recommendation as others have? And of what
Church we are in England, we are of that which is in God, begotten by the
Preaching of the Gospel of the Son of God, which all the Hirelings and them you
uphold by a Popish Law, calls Heresy; and there is that in every man's
conscience, which is the Letters of our recommendation. And you say, we are not
of any settled Principle; I say, we are grounded and settled upon him who is the
Rock of Ages, and stand in his counsel both sure and steadfast, and cannot be
moved: Notwithstanding all the rage of the Heathen we are in peace, Glory unto
him for ever, who is the worlds tormenter, and the breaker of deaths Covenant,
and Hells Agreement and disquiets the Devils peace, and torments them who plead
for his Kingdom. And you accuse us, we make open and public disturbance, to
the grief of the godly and sober people, and scandal of Religion, if we come
and declare the mind of the Lord (as it is revealed in us) in public, and
declare the word of life in truth and soberness, and then you hale him out,
and stocks, and whips, and prisons, and persecutes and what Religion is this
that is among you? who stops your ears, and as the Jews did with Paul, runs
upon us, and, rents our clothes, and yet you call us disturbers. Are not these
practices found in most of your Idols Temples, into which the Hirelings
creeps, and calls a Church, and all those practices among you are found, and we
are ashamed of you and your practices, that these things should be found among
you, after so manifest an appea^ance of the Lords wrath against them, and are
these godly? to that in all your consciences I speak: One haling, another
beating, another punshing, and rending our clothes, and Prisons, and revilings,
and cruel mocking, and false accusing, and stoning, are these God like, or
like God? Oh be ashamed. And you that are so soon grieved, you are not God
like, who is long suffering, and his Saints who were God like did bear, and
forbear one another.

And these Parish Teachers which you hold up in Ireland, I challenge them all
in the name of the Lord who lives for ever, that in all their public worship
(as they call it) and them also, that they are not like God, nor any of his
Ministers, nor any thing that ever they practice. And therefore I say, Come
forth and vindicate your practice, and let your God come forth, and be tried,
and lay open your practice, and your Principles to the world, and stand by them
if you can, and for shame never run to the Magistrate to help; you learned
Rabbis, you great Orators, come forth, and stand and prove your selves before
the people, and manifest your strength, and your weapons, and that God that
answers by fire, let him be God, you have confessed our God answers by fire,
for its kindled among you, and the word which is fire we have declared, and
many has heard it, and have believed, and answered it, and now it burns, and
you shall not be able to quench it; post and run as fast as you can* dig as
deep for Council as Hell, call up all the powers of darkness, you shall not be
able to quench the fire that is kindled. If we should hold our peace, the
stones of the wall would cry out against you.

And therefore I say unto you, all you Parish Teachers, and all you that uphold
them, arm your selves with all your strength, call your Diviners together, for
we proclaim in the Lords name (who has rent the Heavens, and is come down, and
his Tabernacle is with men) open War we declare, and sounds the Trumpet of our
God, out of the holy mountain, all the earth shall tremble before him, and the
mountains* shall melt before him, why should we be undiscovered to you? we are
sent forth to take peace from the earth, and to warn all to the battle of the
great day of God, for now he is arisen in his power and glory, and his Kingdom
is come, Glory unto him for ever, and we are witnesses of it, and it is not of
this world, and we have denied the world, and follows him who has a bow and a
sword, and makes war in righteousness, and none is able to stand before him,
therefore gather your selves on heaps, O ye potsheards, and make a consederacy
among the people, arm your selves, cast up your mounts and batteries,
strengthen your selves, and trust in the arm of flesh, and say, none can come
near us, Verily I say unto you, you shall be made level with the ground, and
all your Sorcery shall be laid open, and Antichrist is discovered by the
brightness of the coming of Christ, our eyes have seen the Lord of Hosts in
his glory, and all your glory, ye tellers of Dreams and Diviners, shall be
made as a dunghill, and your renown shall perish from the earth, the mouth of
the Lord has spoken it.

And now a few words unto you, O ye heads and Rulers of the people in Ireland,
who sit in Judgment, remember from whence you are raised, and how great
deliverance you have had, and how manifest the Lord has appeared for you, to
deliver you out of the hands of blood thirsty men, and your enemies, who
despised the Lord, and all righteousness, and they were numerous and great,
when you have been in great straits, and they said in their hearts, we will
swallow them up, and then the Lord in the day of your distress delivered you,
and has given you their possessions, and dominion over them, and has settled
you in peace, and you that has been but low, has he exalted to bear rule, and
expects from you righteousness, and justice, and equity, and to be as seet to
the lame* and strength to the weak, and to break off every yoke of oppression
from the neck of the poor, and oppressed, and to relieve your brethren, and to
entertain strangers, remembering you were many of you strangers in this Land,
which now is given you to possess; I say, take heed unto your selves, how you
act according to the customs of the Nation, and your own wills, nor the
customary worship of the Nation, which the Lord laid by, and wast, and
scattered all them that pretended themselves Teachers of the people; was there
any of them that stood in the gap, or turned people from their iniquity? till
the Lord broke out in his wrath as fire, and laid the Land wast, and the house
of their God wast, which you burnt up; and will you now join with Moab? and
will you build again those things which you have once destroyed? then you make
your selves transgressors. Think not thus in your hearts, that the Lord has
given you dominion over the Nation to walk after your own wills, and join unto
deceit, and that you may establish those things again, which the Lord was wroth
with. And if you hold up those by your Laws, and your power, and your prisons,
and your sword, which is the people of the Lords curse, I speak of the Teachers
who are in Balaams way; and greedy dumb dogs, who can never have enough; and
bestow the Nations Tithes, and Lands, and riches, which is the Lords treasure,
upon them, that they may cry up deceit, and flatter you, both you and they will
fall together.

And friends I am plain with you, The hand of the Lord is against them, and
all the power of the Nations shall not save them from his indignation. And
therefore be wise oh ye Rulers, and do not you think to take counsel against
the Lord and prosper, nor prescribe not the Lord a way; for h^s thoughts are
not as your thoughts, not his ways as your ways, For he has chosen the weak
things of this world to overthrow the mighty, your eyes have seen this without,
and he has revealed his will to them and in them, whom you look upon but as
weak t^ings, and base things, and in them is he making known his eternal power
to overthrow the worlds wisdom and might, which is in the fall and cursed, from
whence all heresies, and blasphemies, and sects, and opinions flow and come
forth, and he is bringing his own work, his mighty work to pass, even to
overthrow and overturne all the power of the Beast, and the false Prophet, and
shut them into the pit, and the Decree is gone forth and sealed, and shall not
be altered though all the powers of darkness join against him, and although
you should make a Law as the Jews did to take away the life of Christ, yet it
did but little avail them, for he has carried on his work through all
generations, notwithstanding all opposition, and this is he in whom we trust,
and do not you think that you are able to limit the Lord, by whom he must
declare his name, or how, or where, or in what time, but in his own way and
time, and if he command and will us, all men's will must be broken, though still
the holy men of God suffered as such, and so accounted as disturbers of peace,
I say the Devils peace must be broken, and though the false Prophets of this
Nation cry peace unto you, when you walk in the imagination of your own hearts,
and though you cry peace unto them, yet one is come, and coming to take peace
from you, for all your peace and agreement that you make against the least
appearance of God in his servants, it will be dashed to pieces.

And if they were to depart from the presence of God, who fed not the Saints,
neither clothed them, nor vsited them in prison, but were to depart with the
Devil and his Angels into everlasting fire; what will become of you who
instead of clothing incourageth the people to rent them off us, and instead of
feeding us, gives command to depart because we are strangers, and instead of
v^siting them in prison, you put them in prison, and sends for them one hundred
miles to be dragged to your prisons, and before your Judgment Seat, in whom he
is made manifest.

And now oh ye Council at Dublin your order has so gratified the Devil, and
all the profane in the Nation, that they judge your order was not large
enough, as that they had not liberty to banish them, who have been long
inhabitants in the Nation, and therefore they tell you their readiness to
fulfill your orders upon this account, and desires your directions what to do
further* yea, you have made all liars, drunkards, cursed speakers, and profane
rejoice, and has strengthened the hands of the wicked, and so judgment is
turned backward, and righteousness cannot enter, but all these things are
recorded, and you shall one day remember what you have done.

And friends, its nothing to us, we lay down our heads in peace;
notwithstanding, if it had been done by them who had never professed any thing
of liberty of conscience, and tenderness, it might have been born, but here
your double hypocrisy is made manifest.

And near forty of the Priests within the County of Cork, who all subscribed
to the Government under Ormond and In^heq^^e^e, and said, they did not
acknowledge any other Government, and counted them murderers who had taken away
the Kings life, as is manifest in their Book Printed at Cork, wherein most of
these men now have their Tithes, and great sums of money of the Lords Treasury
bestowed upon them; and these are they, which if we declare but against their
deceit, and hyppocrisie, nothing but bonds can we expect, and their information
is taken against us; Oh that ever you should be so led. But why do the Heathen
rage, and the people imagine a vain thing, for he will exalt his Son upon the
Hill of Sion, and then woe unto them that has joined their power to uphold the
Beast, and the false Prophet, for all must go into the Lake together, where
the worm dies nor, nor the fire goes out, to be tormented with the Devil and
his Angels for ever.

And therefore I say unto you, Repent, and turn to the Lord, and seek
judgment and righteousness, that so you may judge for the Lord, and break off
all oppression, and entertain the strangers, who seek not yours, but the good
of the Nation, and that all people might know the Lord, and worship him in
righteousness, that so your days might be prolonged in the Land, and the Lord
of heaven and earth might rule over you in righteousness, and that he alone
might be exalted in the Nations, which has not been known for many
generations, but only all have lived with the name, without his life and
power, in deceit, and all manner of unrighteousness, and the Lord is wearied,
and will ease himself of his adversaries, and his glory shall no longer be
given to another.

Cork in Ireland, the 8 of the 11 month. 1655.
