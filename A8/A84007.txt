ENGLANDS Troublers Troubled, Or the just RESOLUTIONS OF The plaine-men of
ENGLAND, Against the RICH AND MIGHTY: by whose pride treachery and wilfulnes,
they are brought into extreme necessity and misery.

IAM. 5.1.5.6. Go to now ye rich men weep and howl, for the miseries that
shall come upon you; ye have lived in pleasure and wantonness on the earth, ye
have nourished your hearts as in a day of slaughter (...) ye have condemned and
killed the just, and have not been resisted.

Englands TROUBLERS TROUBLED, Or the just RESOLUTIONS Of The plaine-men of
ENGLAND etc.
THough ye have dealt most fraudulently and and treacherously with us, yet we
shall deal plainly and honestly with you, especially you of the City of London.

When before this Parliament, the whole land was over-burdened with unlawful
taxes and pattents, then the Magistrates, Aldermen, Common Council and other
rich Citizens, joined therein with the King and Courtiers, vexing, reproaching
and imprisoning all that would not submit to any thing imposed, though never so
unjust; many of you becoming projectors your selves, and so betrayed the
liberties of the Nation, and caused the evils of the Commonwealth to arise
unto that height, which have occasioned and increased the troubles ever since.

When the oppressions and cries of the people had gotten a Parliament, Oh then
what heave and shove there was to get all out of Office, that had complied with
the King, and to get in such as showed themselves forward for the Parliament:
but to our grief and misery, we find our selves much deceived and abused, too
many wolves and foxes in sheeps clothing, geting in amongst some honest men;
who ever since have perverted all honest endeavors, diverted all just
proceedings, and from time to time strove to set differences between the
Parliament and City, and so have devised all ways, and used all means to leng
then and increase our miseries.

At the first (and for some time after) this politic work of theirs proved
somewhat difficult, because for a season, the major part of the Common Council
were so wise and honest, as to discern and oppose them therein; during which
time, not one evil word was suff^red to be whispered, (or past unpunished that
was spoken) against the house of Commons, or in behalf of the common enemy the
King and his party, then if the Lords did in any thing dispute with the
Commons, the Common council instantly laid it to heart, and ran to Westminster
with Petitions, declaring for the authority of the house of Commons, as
representing the people, such a happy and hopeful time there was, ye cannot
deny.

But the House of Lords, (who have been and are chief in this politic work,
ever carrying on both the King and Courtiers designs) perceiving this
difficulty, strike in with the Lord-like men of the City, the Aldermen, and
with other rich men in all places of the Country, all proceedings ever since
evidently demonstrating a confederacy amongst the rich and mighty, to
impoverish and so to enslave all the plain and mean people throughout the land.

And h^nce we evidently see it is, that we have had so many bones cast amongst
us, to devide and make us quarrel one with another, driving all men into
parties and factions, that so we might never agree together in any thing,
tending to our good and preservation, until we were so wasted and impoverished
by your wicked means, that we must be forced to serve you and your vile ends
for a morsel of bread.

We feel ^arly it is from the House of Lords, that the house of Commons have
been corrupted, drawn into factions, put upon such courses as should make them
odious to us and all honest men, that so when time should be, we might be
induced (through their unjust dealings to oppose their authority, and for this
end it is, that the Lords have packt so many of their sons, servants and
tenants therein, and countenance all Lawyers there, who are the manifest
perverters of of justice, and corrupters of all places.

By these their creatures, they put the House of Commons upon taking offices,
and disposing the public treasury of the Commonwealth amongst themselves,
their children, kindred and servants upon enriching themselves by Bishops and
other Delinquents lands, upon obstructing and perverting legal trials, and
imposing a multitude of illegal taxes, as excise and the like upon us,
wiherein we are miserably over-butthened in our trades and painful callings,
and wealthy men favored.

By these and such other subtle practices they cuningly corrupt them, and then
they cry out on their corruptions, that so all men might be induced to
undervalue and despise them, and be ready to trample upon their authority, and
erect that of the Lords and the Kings, (which indeed are both one) above the
power of the people in the House of Commons; being stomackt and repined at by
both alike; So that now we not only see, but begin to feel, that the ground of
all our wars, and the continuance of them, and of all our miseries have been
and is, to erect the power of the King and Lords, above that of the people, in
the house of Commons.

And therefore unanimously to this end, they bend their joint endeavors; for
when many of the Lords went with the King to help him to raise forces, and to
be Commanders in his Atmies, many of them also were left here, and sent back to
corrupt the House of Commons, to devise plots and stifle discoveries (as that
of Challenor and Tomkins) to pervert the City, to divide the people, to
preserve traitors and delinquents from due punishment, as Waller and many
others, to favor richmen and monopolizing companies, to crush mean men, impose
burdens, and destroy the Parliaments Armies, as that of Essex Manchester and
others.

For this cause, the house of Lords agreed not to the raising of this
succesfull Army, but obstructed it all they could, endeavored to have bound
them fast at Oxford from following the King, kept them without pay fourteen
Months together, wrought the City and other places to become their enemies, to
remonstrate and Petition for their disbanding, stir them up to an engagement
to force the house of Commons that adhered to the Army, and in conclusion, to
raise an Army against them, and proclaim them enemies, and vote the King to
London.

And all this for no other cause, but that this Army proved not deceitful like
others; but faithful and in good earnest against the King and his forces, and
endeavored to restore the power of the house of Commons above that of the
House of Lords, having in all their victories made no use of any Lord at all.
It Is true, some few of them seemed to comply with the Army, when there was
little or no need of their help; but thrice happy had it been for this nation,
that they had never mixed their counsels with such time-serving hypocrites as
these Lords are; for they seemed to hold with the Army merely to betray them,
putting them upon tampering with the King, and upon holding up their own Lordly
usurped power equal to, if not above the just power of the house of Commons,
when according to duty and conscience the Army, should have only insisted upon
the establishment of the just liberties of the people, being the true end for
which they were raised.

So that for any good the house of Lords or any part of them have done in all
these eight years troubles, it had been happy for this Nation, they had all
gone at first with the King, as the rest of them did.

All men may se, it is from the Council and practice of the house of Lords,
that we have had such pulling and halling, such packing and striving about
Common-counsel-men in every ward of London, crying down one sort of men, and up
another, and could never be quiet till the Common-counsell and Aldermen in all
respects answered the expectation of the Lords; and now that they are become as
one fraternity or incorporate body together, what are they put upon, but doing
the King and (his deputies) the house of Lords work for? not only every week,
but almost every day petitions are posted up to the house of Commons for no
less then a Personal Treaty with the King, a platform laid for his coming to
London, all means used to necessitate their yielding the reunto, though against
all conscience and reason.

To this end, an universal rising is contrived, together with the revolting of
the Navy, and the Scots invasion, and an engagement at London, all at one
instant, and all expressly for the same things, chiefly a Personal Treaty, and
the disbandings of the Army.

By all which stratagems, policies and confideracies, they have disturbed all
trade at home, and stopped up all traffic by sea, and thereby intend to reduce
us the plain and mean people of England to such extremity and lamentable
poverty, as that we shall have no possibility to get bread for our selves our
wives, children and families, except we will serve their vile ends, in crying
up a personal treaty, and the power of the King and Lords, and down with the
House of Commons for ever and ever.

And if crying, petitioning and engaging will not do it, then ye think, we will
be so mad as to list and fight against them, or that worthy Army (who is both
their and our shelter from these wicked men's bloody cruelty) and to join with
such desperate enemies of God and all goodness, as Goring, Rupert, Maurice or
with such apostates as the Scots, to bring our selves and our posterity into
bondage and beggary. But we trust, we shall be proof, both against your old
treachery, and Prince Charles his new flattery, we look for no grapes from such
thorns, nor figs from such thistles.

How ignorant soever ye suppose us to be, we are sensible enough of what
trouble and misery you have brought upon as, and how daily (upon pretenses of
speedy remedies) ye bring us into more cruel and painful diseases,
transporting us daily from one degree of poverty and necessity into another,
and seem now cock-sure, that we must either starve, or do ourselvs and the
Commonwealth any mischief ye can imagine.

But assure your selves, ye insolent and deceitful men, as ye have brought us
into our greatest extremities, so when ye have most need of our aid, ye shall
find us otherwise minded, Ye have by corruption in Government, by unjust and
unequal laws, by fraud, cousenage, tyranny and oppression gotten most of the
land of this distressed and enslaved nation into your ravenous claws, ye have
by monopolies, usuties and combinations engrossed all the wealth, moneys and
houses into your possessions, yea and enclosed our commons in most Counties.

Ye have by your confederacies usurped all authority, the plain and (...)
England by your great craft and power are ba^led out of all, as for instance,
in Parliament, the house of Commons is made by your means, of no value or use
to the people that chused them, and amongst them a plain man is made the scorn
of rich (...), yea of Lawyers who are the vilest of men, and greatest abusers
of mankind.

In the City, the Aldermen and we^^ by Citizens ^ver rule all, not est^eming of
any commoner, bu^ such a^ serve their wills. In all the companies the Commons
and Commu^^lity are all cheated and abused by their w^althy members, pack:
together under the name of the assistants, all law and freedom are every where
perverted by you, even in trials a^ law, juries and jury men (though grave and
ancient) are despised and vi^^fied and though in the esteem of the Law of the
land, they be of chiefest trust, yet are forced to stand bare, and oftentimes
righted by unjust judges and corrupt Lawyers, for giving just and true judgment
according to their knowledge and consciences; so that it is in vain, for any
plain honest mean man to ^xpect any reason, equity or justice against any
sort of you (...) and wealthy men, who have not only engrossed all our
substance into your claws, which we have dearly earned with the sweat of our
brows, but ye have caused much innocent blood to be spilt to maintain your
pride and domination.

How excessively and unconscionably have ye advanced your land rents in the
Country, and house and shop tents in the City within these forty years? How
many families have ye eaten out at doors and made beggars, some with rack
rents, and others with engrossing of leases, and monopolizing of trades?

When with extreme care, rackt credit and hard labor our selves and servants
have produced our manufactures, with what cruelty have ye wrought, and still
work upon our necessities, and enrich your selves upon our extremities,
^ffering yea frequently buying our work for less then (you know) the stuffed
whereof it was made cost us; by which and the like unconscionable means in
grinding the faces of the poor, and advancing your selves on our ruins, most
of you rich Citizens come to your wealth, without any kind of remorse or
Christian compassion for your so undoing of poor Families, and pitifully
eating the bread out of the young crying infants mouths.

And what do ye think we shall do now, for (by divine providence) it begins to
come to our turns? ye have by your Arts and devices stopped and suppressed all
Trade, how do ye imagine we shall pay our debts, our rents, or give our
Families bread? ye suppose, we will (contrary to common sense) fight against
the House of Commons, or against the Army? But for whom shall we do it, for
you! who so many ways oppress and tyrannize over us, or for what? To
establish your Lordships over us, and become your slaves, your beggars, your
prisoners, and be for ever without any hope of ever seeing a House of Commons
any more in England, to redress our grievances? Or do ye think in these
manifold extremities, to starve us by this your wilful dearth, pinching
hunger, and intolerable Famine brought upon us, by your crafty, base, and
corrupt means? No,

Ye may assure your selves, ye shall not only taste, but drink deep of your own
mischievous brewing, the evil which you so hastily provide for us, ye shall
find suddenly to fall upon your own heads.

For to be plain with you, though ye have ever dealt deceitfully with us,
until ye forbear to wrest, force, and importune the House of Commons beyond
their own mature judgments, either concerning the King or any thing else; and
likewise, cease to scandalize and provoke the Army, under Command of his
Excellency the Lord Fair fax, which has preserved both you and us, and has
dealt civilly with all men, until the Scots that are come in by your
invitation and procurement, be wholly withdrawn, The revolted Ships be come in,
and the passage by Sea fully cleared, yea and both Trading and other
subsistence be restored, whereof by your wicked means, we are quite debarred,
ye must hold us excused, for paying any of you either re^ts, debts, or
interest, and all enclosures of fenus and Commons, ye must expect to be laid
open; And such of us as shall be in extremity of want by your indirect means,
(as many thousands of us (especially who depends on Trade are likely to be,) we
shall make bold with our Servants and Familes to visit your rich houses, barns,
butteries, capbords and tables, with whatsoever else may supply our
necessities, and that not by way of felony, or robbery, but in a just, fair,
and usual way of free quarter, as too many of our selves have given, both to
the Kings Armies and yours, as well as to any one under the Parliament and
Commonwealth, even for years and half years, and months and weeks, so far
above our power as makes us so much the more unable to maintain our Families
at this time, which ye perceiving instead of pity, do also spoil us of our
Trades and Livelyhoods: So it is but reasonable and equitable, that ye who
bring upon us these miseries, should supply our necessities so long as they
continue, or at least, so long as ye have estates, and we neither Estates nor
Trades, by your means.

We shall also expect to be excused from paying either Excise, Assesments, or
other Taxes, and shall desire of our House of Commons, that all impositions
upon Trade, especially on mean Tradesmen may for ever cease, and that they will
raise such somes of money as they shall need for the public, only by way of
subsidees, as by law and reason they ought, which also will fall chiefly upon
you, who are only able to bear them, as having both real and personal
estates, even to superfluity.

And we, shall upon all occasions be ready to assist them in reducing you to
obedience thereunto, and to what else shall be thought expedient for the
public service.

For however you have most unjustly done your utmost to corrupt^ ^ou^ ^w^e
sons, servants and relations, and (contraty to the nature of all order and
Government) set them us Judges over the Commons of England in Parliament
Assembled, yet shall we give those unexparienced young men better example, and
both recover and preserve that just authority hence forth as carefully as our
lives.

Had ye been willing, ye could have prevented much of these troubles when
Gorings forces kept Bow-bridge, by sending a small force cut of the City, by
which your wilful neglect, ye not only see, but seem to rejoice at the
miseries of Colchester, and the coming in of the Scots, and labor day and
night to bring us into as bad or worse condition, but we trust in God we shall
be able justly to turn the mischief upon your selves, which ye have unjustly
devised and intended against us.

If ye think us too bold with you, and that the burden will be too heavy for
you, then think what it is for us to be thus exrteamly necessitated by your
malicious wilfullnes, and for your own sakes make an end the sooner; for it is
in your power to do all we according to reason desire and insist upon, if you
defer therefore any longer what you ought to perform, as cur necessity by
your negligence and wicked means shall increase upon us, so shall we be
enforced to take a more effectual course with you.

And of this also take timely warning, if ye shall obslinately and traterously
persist, to animate, help or further the Scots advance, the sea men in their
revolt, over-bear or importune the house of Commons, and provoak the Army, and
for these and the like perfidious treacheries to the Commonwealth, come to be
voted enemies and Delinquents.

Assure your selves, that we shall not fail, but be ready to help and assist
the house of Commons with all curabilities, to make good all such Votes of
theirs, against the greatest, proudest and highest of you all; being still (as
we were always) resolved to value no man, nor party of men, in any unjust way
to their just authority, (whose amendment we shall pray for, hope and study to
deserve) but never to rely upon you or any of you in any public respect,
whose work and interest it is, to deceive, oppress or hold us in bondage.

Ye are so rich, fat and swollen with wealth, that ye esteem far less of plain
men then you do of your horses or dogs which ye feed and pamper, whilst by
your means such as we are enforced to starve or beg.

But know this, God can pull down your pride (like Dives) and that by your own
folly and madness, and in short time, bring you (as he has brought thousands
both in City and Country as high as any in Court, City and Country to such a
low condition, that ye may be sensible what it is, to stop and interrupt that
so lawful and needful course of trade, without which so many thousands cannot
subsist, having neither one foot of land to plow nor pasture, nor house to
live in, nor shop nor stall wherein to get their daily bread, but at your
unconscionable and unreasonable rackt, oppressive and destructive rents.

But these and many other enormities, are parcells of the fruits of evil,
co^rupt and tyrannical Government, and of covetous, wicked and ambitious
Governors, perverting most undutifully, and unconscionably the end of Gods
Creation, who in all Nations, has most wisely and liberally provided a
sufficiency of necessaries for the Inhabitants, and unto every particular or
individual person whereof a competency is due, and which if withheld, is in
his sight no less then robbery and injustice: And therefore by all just
Governments, ought to be carefully looked unto and prevented, it being most
unreasonable where God has given enough, that any should perish through want
and penury.

These things we have begun now more seriously to consider, then at any time
heretofore, ye giving us more and more cause so to do, and if ye desist not,
from stopping and disturbing of trade, by which (if ye would be quiet) we for
our parts could (with Gods blessing upon our labors, comforrably and peaceably
live; ye must consider, that necessity (which passes the bounds of Law) will
put men upon further and higer matters, then either ye would be willing to
hear, or we desirous to utter: for we desire only such competency of meane^
whereby to live quietly, that we be not cha^gable, but rather helpful to the
Commonwealth, and no wise to disturb you, either in your wealth or honors,
if ye would desist from doing us wrong, and suffer us to enjoy what is due unto
us by proper right.

Therefore, as ye love your wealth, honor and greatness, study and endeavor by
all good means, to put an end to these long lasting troubles, and (as ye
ought) refer the Government in every part of this destressed Nation, to those
who are chosen from all Cities and Counties thereof, and think not because ye
are happily more wealthy then they, to trample them under your feet, which is
such a presumption as will never be endured in England; And as it has been,
so may i^ ever be the certain downfall of you, and all that attempt so
pernirious and distructive an enterprise.

Nor can we but wonder, why the Parliament, having so great a number of true
friends should suffer themselves to be thus continually vexed and affronted, as
they have been and are, by your destuctive firebrand Remonstrances, and
Petitions, wherein from politic hypocrites, (long time pretending zeal and
conscience) ye are grown impudent professed malignants, and traitors to the
Commonwealth; as has manifestly appeared in your Petition of the 8, of August
last, and your persisting to list horses without authority, and against command
of Parliament.

For what else imports, that ye deem the King in a sad, miserable and
deplorable condition, as in your Petition is expressed? Is not his condition
too good for him, considering so many thousands and ten thousands honest people
that have been seduced and destroyed by his obstinat tyrannous disposition, and
by whom this long and bloody war has been contrived and continued? Could such
language proceed from you in his behalf, but that ye and he are of one mind,
and are confederated together with the house of Lords your gracious answerers,
to destroy the House of Commons, the only obstacle of your tyranny.

If you would not be so esteemed, why call you those Scots your brethren, that
by your own acknowledgement are, come into this Nation in an hostile manner?
ye know sufficiently, the house of Commons have voted all those Traitors, that
had any hand in bringing them in, or shall any wise assist them; and if these
be still your brethren, God bless us from such Common Council Petitioners.

And why is it that ye bear your selves so respectfully toward him, who has
now made himself Prince of those Rebels in the revolted Ships, as to fawn
upon him in these corrupt expressions, His Highness the Prince of Wales,
Commanding at Sea, a considerablle part of the Navy and other Ships; (as if ye
thought him justly there) but that ye desire to honor him before the people,
and thereby increase his party?

Were ye otherwise minded, ye would have laid all those evils (ye there
mention) upon him, whether it be the destruction of Navigation, the deserting
of Seamen, obstruction in the trade of Merchandise, clothing, manufactures,
wool and the like; for who is the cause of these and the rest ye mention, but
he? And had ye not been of his faction, ye would have styled him the Grand
enemy of England, and destroyer of this City, and would have tendered your
utmost assistance to the Parliament to have brought him to justice, and which
(if ye would) ye could as easily yet do, as ye could have stopped Gorings passage
to Colckester.

But we see, ye will never leave ploting, till ye have brought this City into
as grrat misery, as that Town is now in; ye have wealth at will, (and can it
seems) outlast these times of destruction and poverty:

Trade, ye thought was over-wrought before, Tradesmen and Merchants were so
numerous, that your wealth came in too slowly, and it seems ye hope this will
cure your disease, and weed out all inferior traders; and then ye think, ye
and your gallant Sons shall soon recover (with the Princes favor) all that
ye disburse underhand, or are willingly robbed off by him.

So that it is only we of the meaner sort, that must be robbed, beggered and
undone in good earnest, and so it shall be, if we cannot help it; but we hope
you will find your selves mistaken: it is not your dissembled care of us in your
Petition, that will now blind our eyes; when we want work and bread, we shall
neither run to disturb our friends at Westminster, nor into foreign parts,
but our innumerable number (as ye call us) shall find a nearer way to food and
raiment, till (as ye have begun them) ye put an end to these distempers.

Nor is it your Bishop-like outcries against the unsetlement of the Church, or
the increase of blasphemy, Heresy, Schism and prophanenes, that will any
longer keep us from discerning you to be our worst of enemies, and those whom
thereby ye intend to reproach, to be our best of friends; for we know ye mean
thereby to asperce principally the Grand enemy of your Scot^s brethren, the
Army, commonly called by them (their King and Prince) the Army of Sectaries.

But when ye have spett all your venom, ye must find more honest expedients to
prevent the apparent ruin, (ye indeed intend) then so speedy a freeing of his
Majesty from the unjust restraint, wherein he now remains, by a Personal
Treaty: Your meaning is, ye would have Him to your City, and put Him in the
head of a new Army, that so He might restore Himself to His unjust power, which
ye call His just Rights, because thereby only ye expect to be protected in all
your oppressions and dominations over us.

The Parliament is now sufficiently acquainted, with your delusions of this
nature, and how careful ye will be to preserve their undoubted Privileges,
whereof ye and the King would be competent Judges, (and soon put them out of
all question) as also of our native Liberties, would they but once be so cruel
to themselves and us, as to grant your Petitions, or a Cessation of all acts of
hostility, until the Scoss have increased, and your Prince grow more absolute
Master at Sea, or his Father get loose again, then we should soon lie at your
mercy, and in stead of this Army, which ye so eagerly seek to have disbanded,
we should (in all probability) have such a wretched one, as was led by Rupert
and Maurice to robb and spoil us at land, as now your new Prince Pyrat does at
Sea.

But we trust, God will preserve both Parliament and people from all your
malicious stratagems, and intended mischeifs, and give you to drink deep of the
cup of your own so recries and abominations.

FJNJS.
