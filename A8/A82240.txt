LONDON, Printed for Thomas Banks, 1642.

The valiant Resolution of the Prentices of London.
THe famous City of London has ever been fruitful in noble and heroike
Spirits, who have performed wonders of magnanimity and valor in foreign
parts, to the everlasting honor and glory of their Country, and at home what
a numerous Army, consisting of many expert and ^^o^rishing Trained Bands can it
produce? whose skill and courage equally marching together, does with the
artificial thunder of shot, out the Heavens into a trembling amazement, and
with the report thereof strike a terror into the remotest Courts of Jupiter,
though farther distant in the skies by many miles, than York from London. How
therefore can any supposition of fear be grounded on any malignant party now
prevailing with the King to raise Arms in the North? the Papists so
maliciously affected to the Protestant Religion, join with temerarious and
rash Noblemen, in prosecuting a civil war. These gather unto them the decayed
Gentry of several Countries, who having by prodigality, excess, riot, and
horse-races, run their fathers estates out of breath, thinks hereby to renovate
their estates, and unite themselves to the rest, to make their Forces stronger,
add to those Delinquents and roaring Cavaliers, who like Nero, would sing to
behold, their Country suffering in the martyrdom of a civil war, and with
this heterogeneous confused Crew, decayed and indebted persons, are ranked
together, with a multitude of drunken idle people, and giddy brained Gentlemen;
and lastly, the ambitious Clergy, who that they may still have plurality of
Benefices, use their tongues to sow dissension, and give an edge to the
Soldiers swords. All those, and many other sorts of persons, for their own
sakes and safeties; and to further their-owne penicious purposes, or at least
to secure themselves from condign punishment, are all willing, under the fair
pretense of defending the Kings right and prerogative, to join together in
making one entire body of a civil war, and after the Siege of Hull, which is
first attempted, to set the whole Kingdom in a combustion, or ^inate the
Country, besiege London, extirpate the Protestant Religion, introduce Popery,
so much desired by the Malignant Party, and work such a lamentable Tragedy, as
was never known in any Kings reign of England. This storm, thus long a
gathering in the Northern parts, is ready now to fall down in an impetuous
shower of blood: the Kings defensive Guard being multiplied into a great Army,
collected and compounded of malicious Papists, rash unadvised Protestant
Noblemen, decayed Gentlemen, indebted common people, doubtful Delinquents,
loose debauched persons, rattle-headed giddybrain'd Gentlemen, roaring
Cavaliers, and factious Clergymen, whose Sermons bid them ^ight for their own
preferment and glory, not for the King and Gods glory, though that be made
the colorable motive and occasion of the war.

Now the wisdom of the Parliament and the City of London, seeing that the
King will in hostile manner wound his honor and reputation, through his
Subjects, and that their many petitions cannot prevail with him, to dismiss
those evil Counselors of the Malignant Party, but does suffer them to put
in action their own plots and designs, under his royal name and standard, to
the destruction of the Kingdom, the ^bertie of the Subjects, and the
overthrowing the privileges of Parliament, they with much unwillingnesse being
provoked and irritated thereunto, to vindicate their clear intentions to the
King, have raised Forces for the safety of the Kings Majesty, the defense of
the Kingdom* the preservation of the distressed and be sieged town of Hull,
and in this Army by them, to those just and legal ends levied, there are eight
thousand brave-spirited young men, being all Apprentices, who deserve to be
registered in Fames eternal Records; for seeing their Country is thus like to
be engaged in a civil war, and that Popery is like to be introduced in stead
of Protestantisme, slaverie in stead of liberty, and a general destruction
induced into the whole estate of the Kingdom, are with much alacrity and
cheerfulness resolved, to the utmost hazard of their lives, to oppose and
resist the Malignant Parties Army, consisting of Papists, and many others
formerly mentioned.

These martial and valiant Apprentices that do thus expose themselves to
danger for the good of their Country, to the qualities, conditions, and intents
of the persons in the malignant Army, for these Prentices earnestly desire the
prosperity of the Kingdom, and the honor of the King; and will truly with the
best blood in their bodies maiintaine the true Protestant Religion, against the
malignant enemies of the truth, carrying in their breasts loyal hearts to their
Country. King and Parliament, and intending their service only for the safety
and honor of His Majesty, and the glory of God, confident in good success,
marching on as cheerful as if it were their marriage day, and that victor^^
should be their happy Bride. Neither are they of the ba^^^ and mechanic scum
of the people, who to support themselves in a riotous fashion, and to pillage
the Country, under the name of being Soldiers, do without fear or any
conscionable respect, take pay, and enter into service, but the greater part of
those magnanimous Prentices, are servants to honest and sufficient Men, and by
their own honest laborious endeavors can be both serviceable and profitable
to their Masters, and be very beneficial to them, in working at their Trades,
but their Masters preferring the public good before their private profit and
commodity, resist not the willingness of their servants, but do give them free
and fair leave according to their own desires, to do lawful service to their
King and Country, being persuaded thereunto not through necessity, but animated
with the noble desire of renowned honor. Neither are they loose idle fellows
that are feign to make war their profession, for want of other maintenance, for
all these Prentices as was aforesaid, have Trades and Callings, and most of
them young men of good parentage; whose friends live honestly and thriftily in
the Country, and yet as if they all descended of generous blood: their minds
are so enlarged, and their ^courages so magnanimously advanced, that nothing
can contain them from putting their Resolution in execution, and are
determined by this their unexpected expresses of valor, in so young years to
advance their own fame, and bring honor and renown to the City of London.

Besides these young sons of Mars, or Martial Prentices, greeving to see how
the King has been misled with false Counselors to resist the loving
loyallty of his Parliament, and to raise forces in the North, in stead of a
defensive guard, they living here in London and being daily ear witnesses of
the Parliaments legal and just proceedings, and knowing to be the basis or
foundation whereon the structure and building of the Common wealth must stand
or fall, they perceiving now that through the instigation of the malignant
party, those forces are levied and levelled against the Parliament, which is
the defensive wall of the Kingdom, these noble minded Prentices, freely and
voluntery offer their services to maintain the Parliament against the opposers
thereof, knowing the preservation thereof is in the power and prerogatives
belonging thereunto, will conduce to the Kings honor, the Kingdoms safety,
and the prosperity of the City of London.

If therefore the end, moving to the undertaking of any action, deserve praise
and commendations, especially the necessity of the time requiring the sudden
an^xiliary forces be sent to oppose and stay the fury of civil dissension and
the flame of a destructive war, breaking forth in the heart of the Kingdom,
how ought the City of London to magnify and applaud the hopeful stout
Resolutions of these 8 thousand magnanimous Prentices, that go to defend the
Privileges of Parliament, against the Tyranny of an arbitrary government:
these Prentices that march forth to preserve the Kings honor, and to prevent
our own misery, these Prentices that with unanimous and courageous hearts, go
to succor the distressed Town of Hull, and daunt the presuming Cavaliers. And
lastly, these Prentices that make their Religion the object and cause of their
confidence, in maintayning whereof it may be said, Mors omnibus l^crum, death
is a gain to all, and in this cause, this quarrel thus animated, and thus
resolved, these Heroic Prentices are now going forward to fight for Gods
glory, their Sovereignes honor and the defense of the Laws, and liberties of
the Kingdom, being led on by His Excellencye the Earl of Essex, in whom by
his a stable and courtuous speeches, they do very much confide. And doubt not
but under his prosperous conduct by the propitious favor of God, to behave
themselves in such a valiant manner that it shall redound to the honor of the
City of London, they having with many acclamations of joy acknowledged their
willingness to some under His Excellence, desiring nothing but the prayer of
this honorable City, for their happy and prosperous success in this their
noble Expedition and Reso^^^^^^.

The approbation of both Houses
THe Lords and Commons in Parliament assembled, being advertised by the Lord
Lieutenant, and Deputy Lievtenants of the County of Essex, of their ready,
full, and forward meeting of the Trayn-Bands of that Country; and of a
cheerful access, of a very considerable number of Volunteers at their first
appearing, Have thought sit to ^^presse unto them, the good sense they hold of
their proceedings, so much conducing to the general safety of this Kingdom;
And having likewise received from them a Declaration full of affections, and
good inclinations, to maintain our Religion, Laws, Liberties, and Priv^^^^ges
of Parliament; Which they observe to be invaded by pernicious Counsel, as
indeed they have been of late, in a more dangerous and high manner than any
age can pa^allell,: And having very prudently observed in a right
understanding, That the Kingdom, and the Kings authority, and Person, can be
no ways maintained, but by the upholding the Power and Privileges of
Parliament; as by the late Protestation they acknowledge themselves bound unto,
against all contrary Counsels, Power, and force of Arms whatsoever. This just
and faithful Resolution of theirs, to the public good; The Lords and Commons
do not only approve, but commend, assuring them, that as their endeavors have
been for the peace and happiness of the King and Kingdom; So they will
persist in charge of the great and public trust, which lies upon them; to go
through all difficulties which may oppose the public peace and welfare of this
Kingdom: And will upon all occasions be ready to express particularly, to
those persons from who^^ they have received such assurance of their affections
and fidelities.

FINIS.
