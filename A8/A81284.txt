THE CASE OF Robert Husey Esquire.
THOMAS HVSEY Esquire, being seized in Fee of the Manor of Winterborn Tompson
in the County of Dorset, did covenant to levy a Fine of it, to the use of
himself for Life, the Remainder to his Son Delaline Husey for Life, the
Remainder to the First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Sons of Delaline
in Tail; the Remainder to the Heirs Females of the said Delaline to be begotten
on the Body of Dorothy Bingham, his then intended Wife; with several Remainders
over to diverse Persons of his name. Thomas Husey dies. Delaline and Dorothy,
having issue only one Daughter, Elizabeth, levy a Fine of it Sur concessit,
for 500 years, to the use of his last Will; and by his last Will did appoint
the said term to be to certain persons entrust for the payment of his Debts,
and for the raising of 2000 l for a Portion for his said Daughter Elizabeth,
with a Proviso, that if the next Heir Male of the said Delaline, living at the
time of her age of 21 years, Death or Marriage, which should first happen,
should discharge the Debts of Delaline, and pay the said 2000 l and in the mean
time 120 l per Annum for the maintenance of the said Elizabeth, and also the
Charges in the management of the said Trust, then the said Term to be in Trust
for such Heir Male. Delaline dies, leaving issue only his said Daughter
Elizabeth, who is now seized in Tail, and so all the said Remainders are not
valuable; the said Elizabeth being of the age of fifteen years and upwards, and
her Guardians consent that an Act of Parliament should pass to enable Robert
Husey, who is the next Heir Male of Delaline, upon payment of the 2000 l
limited to her by her Father's Will, and upon performance of the other things
required by the said Will, to Mortgage or sell the said Manor, the said Robert
Husey being otherwise utterly incapable of raising the said sum of 2000 l and
of taking any benefit of the Estate, which his said Brother Delaline, upon that
Condition, intended to him.
