THE CONCURRENT TESTIMONY OF THE MINISTERS In the County of VVILTES, With their
Reverend Brethren the Ministers of the Province of London, TO THE Truth of
JESUS CHRIST, And to the solemn League and Covenant: As also, Against the
Errors, Heresies, and Blasphemies of these Times, and the Toleration of them.

LONDON, Printed by R. Cotes for Stephen Bowtell at the Bible in
Popeshead-Alley, June 26. 1648.

To our Reverend and Dear Brethren the MINISTERS in the Province of LONDON,
Subscribers to the forementioned TESTIMONY.
Reverend and Beloved Brethren,
IN this time of Jacobs trouble, wherein the great red Dragon has watched the
woman clothed with the Sun, to devour the man-child as soon as it should be
borne, and wherein the serpent has cast out of his mouth a flood of Heresies
and Errors, to carry away the woman and the child; we are much comforted to
see that God has raised up any help for the Woman in the earth, and that there
is a remnant of her seed which keep the Commandments of God, and the Testimony
of Jesus Christ, and who are resolved earnestly to contend for the faith, which
was once for all given unto the saints. We look upon your Testimony as a
forerunner of Truths resurrection, which is lately fallen in the street, and as
the returning of the spirit of life into the two Witnesses which were to be
slain. Blessed be God that has stirred up your hearts to witness a good
confession, and so effectually to conform your selves to Jesus Christ, who for
this end came into the world that he might bear witness to the truth Since
the day we first saw your zeal for the truth of Jesus Christ, our hearts
affectionately joined with you in the Testimony; and now we do most readily
with our hands also (which we lifted up unto the Most High God with you, in
taking the Solemn League and Covenant) subscribe and set our seals to the
Testimony with you, To the Truth of Jesus Christ, and to the Solemn League and
Covenant; as also against the Errors, Heresies, and Blasphemies of these times,
and the Toleration of them. God forbid that we should be ashamed of Christ and
of his Word, in this adulterous and sinful generation, lest the Son of man
should be ashamed of us, when he comes in the glory of his Father. We resolve
rather through the grace of God to discharge our consciences with you, though
we should be slain for the word of God, and for the Testimony of Jesus Christ,
Neither shall we count our lives dear to us, that so we may finish our course
with joy, and the Ministry which we have received of the Lord, to testify the
Gospel of the grace of God. Be you encouraged therefore (Dear Brethen) with an
holy zeal and in vincible resolution to persist in pleading Gods cause, and
opposing the enemies of the truth and Kingdom of Jesus Christ, who will not be
unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love, which you have showed
toward his name; but be assured if ye suffer with him, ye shall also reign
with him, and receive the crown of righteousness, which is laid up for all
them that fight the good fight, and finish their course, and keep the faith. We
commend you to the grace of God, and rest

Your Brethren and fellow laborers in the work of the Gospel. DOuglas
