GOSPEL GROUNDS; OR, CHRIST Declared to be the only Treasury of all Good, AND
THE FULLNESS OF All, before God the Father, For true Believers.

Coloss. 1.19. For it pleased the Father that in Him should all fullness dwell.

Printed at London.

To the READER.
IN honor of the glorious Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, and to vindicate
the truth of it from the false and base aspersions which upstart errors, and
abominable blasphemies, and as diabolical practices, as well idolatrous as
profane have cast upon it; These few Gospel grounds, which are humbly
presented to every honest spiritual eye: That it may appear that Gospel
knowledge is not obscure, uncertain, difficult, or any more cause of liberty
that is wickedly taken up: then wine is of drunkenness, or clothes of pride,
or meat of gluttony: Neither is it to be withheld or minced, or club'd down by
any, least it should be perverted, as it were madness to go naked, least we
should be proud, or destroy vines, least any be drunk, and to make no
provision for food, least we should be gluttonous; they are partly Antydotes
against errors, or Cordials for the comfort of such as are cast down: In which
the defects call for supply, and the redundancies for pruning, by some learned
Scribe; only let no advantage be taken from any misquoted or misprinted
Scripture: If they be good for nothing else, they may be profitable for young
people that are to be drawn on with delight: or to such as want leisure to read
larger books; or such as are of shallow capacity to conceive a large tract: or
for old folk, whose brains are dried up, and so of frail memories, one
sentence may be easily learned in one day: and the proofs in two more, and so
in as many days as there be conclusions, all may be gotten, and the proofs in
twice as many more: The Lord bless them as they are intended to do good to all
that are his: Amen.

The Gospel Grounds.
ALmightinesse in God, and the Creatures emptiness in, and of themselves, are
the only subjects of all the holy Scriptures. Exodus 6.3. Genesis 17.1. and
28.3.43.14. Psalm. 68.34.35. 2 Cor. 6.18.

2 All the holy Scriptures do jointly witness Christ Gods arm to save, and
tend to make men perfect by faith in Christ. Isa. 40.10, 11. and 52.10. and
53.1. Joh. 5.39. 2 Timothy 3.16, 17.

3 All things are to be rejected, as loss, and dung, for the excellency of the
knowledge of God in Christ Jesus. Luke 14.26. Phil. 3.8, 9. Mat. 19.21. Mat.
10.37.

4 All that profess Gods free and supreme will, a sure ground of believing;
confess the same revealed will, a safe rule for their living. Romans 9.11.20.21.
1 Pet. 1.2. and 2.15, 16. Romans 12.2.

5 All true believers are in a perfect, and everlasting union with God in
Christ, and one with another. Joh. 14.20. Joh. 17.21, 23. Ephesians. 4.16. and 5.30.
1 Cor. 6.17.

6 All that are actually perfect in Christ, do by faith rest quietly on him,
and look out for no other perfection. Heb. 4.3. Romans 5.1, 2. Phil. 4.7. and
14.17.

7 All man's worthiness is Gods esteem of Christ's worthiness imputed to them,
and of what he himself works, by his Word and Spirit. Rev. 5.9. and 3.4. 1 Thessalonians. 2.12. 2 Thessalonians. 1.14.

8 All faithful prayers, prophecies, and precepts of, and to believers, are as
so many plain promises made unto them. Joh. 17. Psalm. 3. Ephesians. 4.4. Mat. 6.9.
Ezekiel. 36.25, 37. Romans 12.1, 2.

9 A believer is always perfect before God, in Christ, not so to conscience by
faith, much less by works to men. Heb. 13.8. Dan. 9.24. Romans 14.1, 12. Lam.
3.2.

10 A believers perfection is not absolute by renovation, but only by
imputation of Christ's perfection. 2 Cor. 4.16. Phil. 3.12, 13. 2 Cor. 5.21. 1
Cor. 1, 30. Romans 4.7, 8.

11 A believers stay is upon Gods Almightinesse in Christ, in the greatest
straights of the sorest darkness. Isa. 26.3. Hab. 3.17. Isa. 50.10. Mich. 7.8,
9. Psalm. 42.11.

12 A believers strength in dangerous straights, is to be still, and the more
knowledge of God, the more quietness in any trial. Psalm. 46.10. Isa. 30.7,
15. Exodus 14.13. 2 Chronicles. 20.17.

13 A believers estate is very happy, glorious, and unchangeable, yet nothing
to that it shall be at the last day. Prove. 3.13. Psalm. 1.1. 1 John 3.1, 2. 1
Pet. 1.3, 4, 5. Heb. 13.5, 8.

14 A believers liberty is so limitlesse in prayer, that he cannot make over
bold with God for things agreeable to his will. 2 Cor. 4.17. Heb. 4.16. and 10,
22. Isa. 49.11. 1 John 5.14, 15.

15 As happy as every believer is, were it only in this life, none could be
found more miserable. 2 Cor. 4.17, 18. 1 Cor. 15.19. Heb. 11.26.

16 A believers joy is no fleshly, feeble, or fading joy, but a spiritual,
full, and flowing joy. Phil. 3.3. 2 Cor. 5.12. Job 20.5. Isa. 66.10, 11, 12.

17 A believer can accuse himself of more sin, then any; yet can excuse himself
of all sin before God himself. 1 Cor. 2.11. Psa. 51.1, 2, 3. Isa. 38.14, 17.
Psa. 103.12.

18 A believer having put off himself, and put on the Lord Jesus Christ, is as
absolutely perfect before God as Christ can make him. Gal. 2.19, 20. Gal. 3.25,
26. 1 John 4.17. Isa. 61.10.

19 A believer is so far from the love of any sin, that for sin, he abhors his
best works, and himself. 1 Cor. 13.6. Isa. 64.6. Job 42.6. Eze. 36.31.

20 A believer receives the doctrine of renovation as readily to glorify God,
as that of justification whereby God glorifies him. Romans 6.1, 2, 3, 4. Tit.
2.12, 13, 14. 2 Cor. 7.1. 1 Pet. 2.9, 10.

21 Believers are saved already, though salvation appear not as it is, till
the last and great day. Ephesians. 2.8. 2 Timothy 1.9. 1 Pet. 1.9.

22 Believers, though simple, weak, and nothing to themselves, or others, are
the wisest, strongest, and most excellent persons in the world. 1 Cor. 1.26,
27, 28. 2 Cor. 12.10. Pro. 12.26. Psalm. 16.3.

23 Believers and their sins, are not one thing: but sin in them is far distant
from them to faith. Romans 7.17.21. Psalm. 103.12.

24 Believers do not any evils, they seem to do: but sin with them only does
all that is so done. Romans 7.20, 31. 1 John 3.6, 7, 9.

25 Believers, how ever it seem, do always grow in faith, and love and
answerable fruits. Psalm. 92.12. Job 17.9. Psalm. 22.1. Judge. 5.31.

26 Believers are not exhorted to duties because they can do more then others,
but God works so in them, not in others. Tit. 3.8. Phil. 2.12, 13. Isa.
26.12. 2 Cor. 3.5.

27 Believers persons are pleasing to God in Christ's only person: their works
as they are Gods pleasure done in them. Mat. 3.17. Heb. 13.21. 2 These. 1.11.
Psalm. 135.6.

28 Believers are most made and built up when they do apprehend themselves in
themselves most cast down and undone. Isa. 6.5, 6. Job 40.4, 5. and 42.5, 6.
Luke 5.8.

29 Believers cannot loath themselves, nor love Christ enough in themselves all
their days. Ezekiel. 6.9, 10. Gal. 2.20. Phil. 3.3, 4, 8, 9. 1 Cor. 16.22. Mat.

have of sorrow in Adam. 1 Cor. 15.22. Romans 5.10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. 1 Cor.
15.45.

31 Believers cannot be prevailed against for hurt, by all the policy, and
powers of hell. Mat. 16.18. and 7.24, 25. Romans 8.28.

32 Believers are simply in all things to do Gods revealed will, without any
further question. Deuteronomy. 29.29. and 12.32. Joh. 6.28, 29. Phil. 2.14. Gal. 1.16.

33 Believers and Gods Ordinances being mutually disposed one for another, God
so leads them on to perfection. 1 Cor. 3.1. Heb. 5.12, 13, 14. and 6.1, 2. 1
Cor. 11.29. Phil. 3 16, 17. Acts 20.20, 27, 32.

34 Believers are never the more just before God, for their own integrity, nor
the less just for their iniquity. Romans 4.2, 5. Romans 3.28. Isa. 38.14, 17.

35 Causeless suspicion, or contempt of a Gospel ministry bewrayes ignorance
of the Gospel, or malice against it. Luke 7.39. 2 Cor. 13.3, 4, 5, 6. 1 Cor.
13.5. Act. 17.18.

36 Christians, whose care is cast wholly on God, are the choicest believers,
for such are not negligent in the use of lawful means. 1 Pet. 5.7. Phil. 4.6.
Act. 27.25, 31.

37 Censured believers shall be judges of their impenitent censurers at the
great day. 1 Cor. 6.1, 2, 3. Jude 14.15. Rev. 20.11.

38 Christ crucified is the only subject of all Gospel preaching, other
doctrine is not to be received by believers. 1 Cor. 1.23. and 2.2. and 9.16. 2
Cor. 4.5. 2 John 9.10, 11.

39 Christ first, then a believer in Christ, is the person to whom all promises
of happiness do belong. Psalm. 1.1, 2. and 119.1, 2. Pro. 3.13. Isa. 33.15, 16.
Mat. 5.3. Gal. 3.16.

40 Christ only is the end of all Laws, the hiding place from all threats; and
the door of all promises to believers. Romans 10.4. Isa. 32.2. 2 Cor. 1.20. Gal.
3.16.

42 Christ's birth, blood, death, and righteousness are Almighty, by the
personal union of both natures in Christ. Luke 2.10, 11. Act. 20.28. 1 John
3.16. 2 Cor. 5.21. Joh. 1.14.

43 Christ only is the common treasury of all good, and the fullness of all
before God to true believers. Col. 2.3.9, 10. Col. 1.19. and 3.11. 1 Cor. 1.30.
Joh. 1.14, 16.

44 Christ knew no sin, yet was for us made not only a sacrifice, but sin; and
we that so believe, are made Gods righteousness in him. 2 Cor. 5.21. Gal.
3.10, 11, 12. Isa. 53.6.

45 Doubtful disputations are to be avoided in the presence of the weak, lest
they be either offended, or ensnared. Romans 14.1, 2. Romans 15.12. 1 Timothy 1.4. and
6.4, 20.

46 Doubtings of Gods favor yielded unto by the faithful after new sins, are
greater added to lesser evils. Mat. 14.30, 31. Heb. 2.1, 2, 3. 1 John 5.10.
Genesis 4.13.

47 Evil is as burdensome to believers, as good is to unbeleevers, seeing they
are both out of their rode way. 1 Cor. 13.6. Romans 7.24. Amos 8.4, 5. Gal. 5.17.

48 Faith, and love, with their attendants, are not gotten by our own industry,
nor without it. Psalm. 10.17. Ezekiel. 36.25, 37. Ephesians. 2.8. Romans 5.5.

49 Faith is hard, yea, impossible for man to get, but possible, and as easy
for God to give. Mat. 7.13. Luke 18.24, 27. Phil. 1.29.

50 Faith is not founded on our works, yet is the only ready way to all
powerful performances. Gal. 5.6. Ephesians. 2.20. 1 Cor. 3.11. Tit. 3.8. 2 Cor. 4.13.

51 Faith is the only evidence of salvation to our selves, works do show our
faith to others. Heb. 11.1. 1 John 5.10. Jam. 2.18.

52 Faith makes the hardest duties easy, mastreth the strongest lusts,
wanquisheth Devils. Luke 17.3, 4, 5. Gal. 5.24. Ephesians. 6.16.

53 Faith makes Gods power ours, and all our enemies Gods adversaries. 1 Pet.
1.4, 5. Act. 9.5. Mat. 25.44, 45.

54 Gospel precepts are creating injunctions, as soon obeyed as enjoined, when,
and by whom the commander pleases, Genesis 1.3. 2 Cor. 46. Eze. 2.1, 2. Joh.
20.27, 28. Esa 44.26, 27. Deuteronomy. 33.27. Dan. 10.8.

55 Gospel arguments to work of sanctification weaken not, but confirm and
strengthen believers in faith and love. Cor. 10.8. and 13.10. 1 Pet. 1.3, 4.
and 2.12.2, 3.

56 Gospel exhortations are no rods; but hearty encouragements to believers in
all performances. Jos. 1.2, 3, 4, 9. Heb. 12.1.5. and 13.22. 1 Cor. 14.3.
Paraclesin.

57 Gods works are everlastingly unchangeable, not to be added to, or at all
diminished by any creature. Eccles. 3.14. Isa. 46.9, 10. Dan. 4.35. Isa. 14.24,
25.

58 Gods eternal decree is not crossed, but only discovered by the execution,
seeming never so strange. Act. 2.23. and 3.18. Act. 4.27, 28.

59 Gods saving purpose free from all causes but his own pleasure, was to save
none but by faith in Christ. Ephesians. 1.4, 5. 1 Cor. 8.6, 7.

60 Gods elect ever beloved of God, are yet by sin truly Gods enemies, till
Gods love be declared by faith in Christ. Romans 8.30. and 10.14, 17. Romans 8.16.
Isa. 59.21. Jer. 31.3. Romans 5.10.

61 Gods all-sufficient grace is not lost, nor lessened by the sins of the
faithful, but commended, illustrated, and magnified. 2 Cor. 12.8, 9, 10. Psa.
51.3. Romans 3.3, 4, 5. Romans 5.20.

62 Gods way is the safest way, though known to none but such only as he
himself teaches. Isa. 54.13. Psa. 86.11. Isa. 35.8.

63 Gods image more manifestly appears in all believers, as they are more
enlightened to behold Gods image in Christ. 2 Cor. 3.18. and 4.4, 6. Phil.
3.10. 1 John 3.2.

64 God is most glorified, when most joyfully sought and confidently relied
upon for all his free promises. Isa. 56.7. Heb. 4.16. 2 Cor. 5.6, 8. Romans 4.20,
21.

65 Good or evil acts make no man good or evil; but by some circumstances do
manifest what men are. Mat. 7.17, 18* 2 Samuel 11.4.

66 Greatest confidence in God through Christ, is attended with greatest love
and obedience to God. 2 Cor. 5.6, 7, 8, 9, 11. 1 Cor. 15.10.

67 Growth in grace and the knowledge of Jesus Christ is the only powerful way
to spiritual steadfastness. 2 Pet. 3.17, 18. Heb. 6.1, 2, 3. Ephesians. 4.12, 13, 14.

68 He only is worthy of a Gospel Ministry which receives the Gospel for its
own sake against all opposition. Mat. 10.11, 12, 37, 38. Luke 3.5, 6. Mat. 8.8,
9.

69 Hearty hospitality is discernable by un^esistable expressions of fervent
love in the entertainment of friends, or strangers, Genesis 19.2, 3. Judge. 19.5,
6, 7, 20, 21. Luke 24.28, 29. 3. John 5.

70 Increase of mortification, and renovation in believers arises from their
growth in the knowledge of Jesus Christ. Phil. 3.10. Col. 3.1, 2, 5, 10. 1 John
3.2.

71 It is not good to dig up the buried faults of the faithful, but men of
foulest lives are most busy with believers blemishes. Genesis 9.22. 1 Pet. 4.8.
Mat. 7.5. 2 Samuel 16.5, 7. Joh. 12.4*5, 6.

72 Knowledge of the Gospel increases abundantly by dispersing it liberally.
Pro. 11.24, 25. Genesis 18.17, 18. Mat. 25.20. 2 Cor. 9.6.

73 Man is said to do only as the created subject wherein, or the formed
instrument wherewith any thing is done. Phil. 2.13. Isa. 26.12. and 10.5, 15.

74 Man falls from God by going out from him, to the creature; and rises by
returning to God by faith in Christ. Genesis 3.6, 7. 2 Cor. 10.4, 5. Mat. 16.24. 2
Cor. 3.5. Luke 14.26, 27.

75 Man's renewed perfection in his expectance of all good from God, and ability
to glorify God for all good renewed. Romans 11.36, 1 Cor. 10.31. Jer. 9.23, 24.

76 Many speak seemingly well, but to do good, or to speak well indeed they
are altogether to seek. Mat. 7.21. Jer. 7.4. Mat. 23.5. Mat. 12.33, 34.

77 Meditation of the Gospel, together with self resignation wholly to it, is
the way by which God teaches to profit by it. 1 Timothy 4.15. Psa. 1.2. and
119.11. Isa 48.17.

78 New heavens and a new earth shall be created of God for the everlasting
happy habitation of believers. Isa. 65.17. 2 Pet. 3.13. Revel. 21.1, 2.

of Gods free love in Christ. Romans 4.5. Psalm. 95.7. Heb. 3.7, 15. 2 Cor. 5.6, 8.
Romans 4.19, 20.

80 None but prepared ones will take Christ, yet is no preparation to be forced
on any as man's work in any sense. Isa. 61.1, 2. Act. 16.31. and 8.37. Mat. 9.23.

81 Nothing is procured by prayer besides Gods purpose, believers are by it
only fitted to receive Gods gifts. Isa. 46.9, 10. 2 Chronicles. 20.12, 17. Act. 12.
Ezekiel. 36.25, 37.

82 Perfection is only in God, who being simply and universally perfect,
performs all things perfectly. Mat. 5.48. Deuteronomy. 32.4. Psalm. 18.30.

83 Perfection is required of the creature to bring it back to the Creator by
Christ. Mat. 5.48. 2 Cor. 13.11. Ecles. 7.29.

84 Philosophical subtilties are to be avoided, and plain simplicity to be
only used in the publication, and profession of the Gospel. Col. 2.8. 2 Cor.
1.12, and 11.3. and 4.2.

85 Preaching is the only ordinary way of publishing the Gospel: to beget and
perfect faith, and love. Romans 1.15, 16. and 10.8, 14, 17. Gal. 3.1, 2.

86 Quenching the Spirit is prevented and Apostasy, by dehortations from it,
and admonitions against it. 1 Thessalonians. 5.19. 2 Timothy 1.6, 7. Heb. 12.15, 16.

did at first in creating it self. 2 Cor. 5.17. Ephesians. 2.10. Gal. 6.15. 2 Cor.
5.5. Joh. 3.3, 5. Act. 11.18. Ephesians. 2.8.

88 Such as were never at a stand about Gospel knowledge, know not what the
Gospel is. Jer. 6.16. Isa. 6.5. Act. 2.37. and 8.31.

89 Such as rest satisfied with any measure of Gospel knowledge, know it not
truly in any measure. 1 Cor. 8.2. Ephesians. 1.18. and 3.18, 19.

90 Such as are most acquainted with the Gospel, desire nothing so much as the
increase thereof. Phil. 3.9, 10. Joh. 6.34. 2 Pet. 3.18. Act. 13.42.

91 Salvation by Christ contains in it all the promises of God made to
believers in the Scriptures. Mar. 16.16. Joh. 4.22. Isa. 49.6. 1 Pet. 1.5.

92 Sin is not so far from any, as from those to whom it seems to be most
near. Psalm. 51.3, 4, 9, 10, 13. Romans 7.24. Isa. 18.14, 17.

93 Sudden sadness free from sickness, bewrayes evil purposes in the wicked;
sorrow or temptations in the faithful. Genesis 4.4, 5, 6. 1 Kin. 21.3, 4. Neh.
2.1. Ps. 42.11. Mat. 26.37.

94 The Gospel is a joyful Revelation of Gods work in Christ to save elect
sinners, and of the work of his spirit in the saved. Romans 16.25. Luke 2.10. 2
Cor. 5.19. Romans 8.30. Gal. 5.22. 2 Cor. 3.18.

95 The Gospel is the Almighty word of Gods grace able to beget, and build up,
all that are begotten. Romans 1.16. 1 Cor. 4.15. Act. 20.32.

96 The Gospel is a doctrine of liberty, not to the flesh, nor so wilfully
abused by any but very Reprobates. Gal. 5.1, 13. Jud. 4. 1 Pet. 2.8.

97 The Gospel is not to be hidden but openly preached to every creature; but
such as obstinately put it from them. Mar. 16.15. 2 Cor. 4.2, 3. Act. 13.45, 46.

98 The Gospel is a transforming doctrine, though the change appear not in all
alike, for time, manner, or measure. Es. 11.6, 7, 8, 9. 1 John 2.12, 13. Act.
8. and 16. 1 These. 1.5.

99 The Gospel, though dark, hard, a foolishness to many, is plain, easy,
and excellent to believers. 1 Cor. 2.7, 14. Joh. 6.60. 1 Cor. 8.23. 2 Cor. 4.2.
Esa. 35.8. 1 Timothy 1.11.

100 The Gospel is not ordinarily revealed to any at once, but as men are
enlarged by the Revealer. Mat. 16.17. 2 Cor. 6.11, 12.

101 The Gospel is not truly believed by such as receive not the doctrine of
renovation by it. Tit. 2.12, 13, 14. Romans 12.1, 2. Ephesians. 4.18, 19, 20.

102 The Gospel is perverted, when weak ones are terrified and not comforted,
and confirmed by it. Isa. 29.20. and 35.3, 4.

103 The Gospel is not the Law, nor the Law the Gospel, but they are to be
destinguished by believers. 2 Cor. 3.6, 7. Gal. 3.12, 13. Joh. 1.17.

104 The Gospel fewer in words, is far greater then the Law in powerful, and
glorious administration. 1 Timothy 1.11, 15. 2 Cor. 3.6, 7, 8, 9. 2 Cor. 4.1, 2.

105 The Ministers of the Gospel are most jealous least peoples affections be
withdrawn from Christ to themselves. 2 Cor. 11.3, 2. 2 Cor. 12.6. Rev. 22.8, 9.

106 The more men know they excel in learning and natural parts, the further
they are off from the true knowledge of the Gospel. Mat. 11.25, 26. 1 Cor. 2.6,
7. and 3.18.

107 The Law reveals sin, showing what man was, and is not; should do to life
but can never. Romans 3.19, 20. and 5.20. and 10.5. Deuteronomy. 5.29.

108 The Law is a rule of life to believers not from the letter without, but
from love within. Joh. 14.13. Romans 7.6.

109 The Law has nothing at all to do with believers, but they have most of
all other to do with it. 1 Timothy 1.9, 10. Romans 6.14. and 3.31.

110 The Law of faith is the Law of a believers mind, not Moses Law, but
Christ's. Romans 3.2, 7. and 7.25. Jam. 2.8. Gal. 6.2.

111 The Law of faith receives Christ and his fullness for our selves, and
like power to express the same to others. Romans 6.1, 2. and 3.27. and 8.34.

112 The Law is not used in preaching lawfully if not always with the Gospel,
and only for the Gospels sake. 1 Timothy 1.6, 7, 9, 10. Romans 6.14. and 10.4. and
3.31.

113 The new Covenant is everlastingly unchangeable, seeing it is founded only
