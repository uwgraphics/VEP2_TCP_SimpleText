LEX TALIONIS: OR, LONDON REVIVED.
To the Tune of, Prethy friend leave off this thinking.
THe Cavaliers are vanqnish'd quite,
The King took from that wicked train,
That would deprive him of his rights,
And bring in Popery again:
The Army and the Parliament,
Must now dispute what Government
Shall be established in this Nation,
Protestants are out of date,
Where is that glorious Reformation
We contested for of late?
Not having form nor order now,
We would serve God if we knew how.
The Papist and the Protestant
The Roundhead and the Cavalier
Can neither act nor yet prevent
Those dangers which do now appear:
The Presbyter and Independent,
Now are Plaintiff and Defendant.
The Parliament gave a Commission,
To their Troops to ketch their King,
Not limiting on what condition,
So they alive or dead did bring:
But now they have him none do know
How they his person shall bestow.
The Country can no longer bear,
The City which this War fomented,
Must with their neighbors sufferings have,
And at their losses be contented:
The Apprentices next Tuesday may
Conclude a peace to crown their day.
The Londoners will fetch their King,
The Parliament proclaimed it so,
Sir Thomas would him fain home bring,
From whence do these distractions grow?
How come the holy Brethren
Thus err, alas they are but men?
This City who advanced High,
A Parliament above their God,
Like dust into their faces fly,
And for themselves have made a Rod
They covenanted to mayntain
What privilege they now disdain.
The King who once did rule Supreme,
Gave power to a Parliament
To settle things, but they have clean
Deprived him of his government:
He put a Sword into their hands
For which his life in danger stands.
Such power the States gave to Sir Thomas,
Still presuming he would be
Their servant, and perform his promise
To serve his Majesty:
But he requites them in each thing,
As they before have served the King.
And thus you see the Heavens were just
Who renders every one his due,
He that deceives his Masters trust,
Shall never find a servant true:
Let each one learn from hence to do,
Even as you would be done unto.
