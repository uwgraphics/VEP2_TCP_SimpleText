Latitude.

Advertisement to the Reader.
THE following Geographick Treatise, with some other Parts of this Book, had
the ill fortune to be left uncompleat, by our Renowned Author, who was snatched
from us, whilst he was with greatest application hastening the Edition thereof.
This deplorable accident has been the occasion that it has been so long
detained from public view, and that now it is come abroad with much less
luster, than ought to be expected, from the Judicious and Learned Pen of Sir
Jonas Moore. As far as could be Collected, from the Maps he had caused to be
engraven in his Lifetime, and the several Tables of the Latitudes and
Longitudes of the Cities of Europe, written with his own hand; we have
endeavored to prosecute this Design he had laid, and have given you a brief
and succinct Description of the several Regions of the whole Earth, and have
been more or less particular therein, according as our knowledge of the
Countries we describe, is more or less perfect. The Maps are taken from the
newest Geographers extant, and therefore it is probable the most exact (time
still producing corrections and amendments in the Works of them that went
before) and our first Meridian is that of the Isle of Ferro, the most Westerly
of the Canaries, which at present all the French Geographers are obliged to
observe. The Tables are deduced from the Maps, and serve to find out any place
in them without long search. This, Reader, is what was thought necessary to
advertise thee of, in this place, and if any mistake have escaped unseen, you
are desired heartily to excuse it, or at least not to attribute it to our
deceased Author.

GEOGRAPHY: Or, a Brief DESCRIPTION Of the whole EARTH.
THE Earths Surface, whose Description is properly termed Geography, is by many
and sufficient Arguments made appear to be of no other than a Sphaerical
Figure; and the Circumference thereof has in this our Age been more curiously
than heretofore inquired into, and found by the Concordant Observations of the
Gentlemen of the Royal Academy of Paris, and of our worthy Countryman Mr.
Norwood, to be very near 25000 English Statute Miles, and consequently its
Diameter 7958 Miles: The greater part of this vast Globe is covered with Water,
which we call the Sea, out of which the Land rises with very slow Ascents, the
hight of the highest Mountains and Prominences thereof scarce amounting to the
two thousandth part of its Radius, and only serving to cause the Rivers to run
with slow and easy Channels. The Air on all sides encompasses it and renders it
habitable, and the principle of Gravitation, whereby all Bodies descend toward
its Center, is that which defends it from dissolution, by not permitting the
least part thereof to be separated far from it; into the reason whereof
Philosophers have hitherto inquired in vain. This Globe by its twofold motion
enjoys the grateful Vicissitudes of Day and Night, Winter and Summer; the
former by turning round upon one of its Diameters in the space of 24 hours, and
showing all its sides successively to the Sun: This Diameter is called the
Axis, and its extremities the Poles of the World, which by the experience of
many Ages are found unalterable and fixed in the Earth, and the direction of
this Axis by some unknown Magnetical Principle of Nature is always carried
parallel to it self, during the time of the revolution of the other motion,
whereby the Earth is carried round the Sun in the space of a year, and the Axis
being inclined to the plain in which the annual motion is performed, causes the
one Hemisphere to have more of the Suns light for the one half year, and the
other Hemisphere for the other. These affections though necessary to be
premised here, you will find explicated and demonstrated more at large in the
Astronomical part. We come now to the Explanation of the terms which have been
thought proper in the illustration of Geography.

We must observe that there are greater and lesser Circles, and that the former
divide the World into two equal parts, and the latter into two parts also, but
unequal. All these Circles severally are divided into three hundred and
threescore parts, which are called Degrees.

There are four greater Circles, to wit, the Equinoctial, the Zodiac, the
Horizon and the Meridian, and as many lesser, to wit, the Tropicks of Cancer
and Capricorn, and the two Polar Circles, the Artick and Antartick.

The Equinoctial Circle is so called, because when the Sun enters it, the days
and nights are of an equal length; it is also called the Equator, because it
divides the World into two equal parts. Seamen call it only the Line. For the
right understanding of this Circle, we must know that the Heavens seem to move
upon two points, called Poles, the one bearing the name of Artick, and the
other of Antartick; in a middle distance from which Poles this Circle is
imagined to be: the use of it in Geography, is to divide the Earth into two
parts, the one Northern, toward the Pole Artick, and the other Southern
toward the other opposite Pole. The Latitude of places is reckoned from the
Equinoctial where it begins, toward the Poles wherein it ends, and this space
contains ninety Degrees. Latitude is either Northern toward the Pole Artick,
or Southern toward the Antartick.

The Zodiac is the Suns High way, and this Circle cuts the Equinoctial into
two equal parts, from which its greatest distance is but twenty three Degrees
and an half; it only shows what places of the Earth may have the Sun
perpendicular, and more properly belongs to the Heavens than the Earth.

Horizon is as much as to say, boundary, because that Circle limits our sight,
and divides the Heavens and the Earth into two parts, which are called
Hemispheres, the one whereof we see, but cannot the other. There is a right
Horizon, a Polar or Parallel one, and an oblique one; those places that lie
under the Equator, have a right Horizon, and are in the right Sphere; those
that are under either of the Poles have the Parallel Sphere: and all other
places have an oblique Horizon, and are in an oblique Sphere. This Circle shows
the Rising and Setting of the Stars, and the four principal Quarters of the
World, which are East, West, South and North; the East is on the side of the
Rising Sun; the West is where the Sun Sets; the North is toward the Pole
Artick; and the South toward the Antartick. These four Quarters are very
necessary for distinguishing the limits of Regions, as will appear throughout
this whole Treatise. From thence come the four principal winds, all which the
Horizon shows; but it is not marked on Maps, but only on the outside of
Globes and Spheres.

Meridian signifies Midday Circle, because when the Sun is come to it; it is
Noon in that place whereof it is the Meridian; for over every part of the Earth
there is a Meridian, so that the number of these Circles is almost infinite:
However out of all those there is one pitched upon which is called the great or
first Meridian, or the Geographers Meridian. The Ancients chose the Meridian of
the Canaries, which they knew by the name of the fortunate Islands; and some
Moderns make use of it still in their Maps. Others have pitched upon the
Meridian of the Isles Azores, or Western Islands, which lie to the West of
Europe. From this first Meridian the Longitude of places is reckoned from West
to East through the three hundred and sixty Degrees of the Equinoctial, which
is the circuit of the whole Earth; whereas Latitude is only reckoned to ninety
Degrees, which make but a fourth part thereof.

The Tropicks are so called from a Greek Word Tropos, which signifies turning,
because when the Sun is come to one of these Circles, he returns again toward
the Equinoctial.

The Tropic of Cancer is toward the Pole Artick and that of Capricorn toward
the Antartick, and both carry the names of the Signs of the Zodiac through
which they pass; each of them is distant from the Equinoctial, three and twenty
Degrees and a half, which is the greatest distance of the Sun from that Circle.

The Polar Circles go round the Poles, from which they borrow their names, and
are distant each from his Pole twenty three Degrees and a half.

Of the Zones.
THE four lesser Circles whereof we have been speaking, divide the World into
five parts, called Zones, that is to say, Belts or Girdles, because they begird
the whole Globe. One of them is Torrid, two are temperate, and two cold: The
Torrid Zone is comprehended between the two Tropicks, and the people that
inhabit it are called Amphiscians, that is, such as have their shadows both
ways. To all places of this Zone the Sun comes perpendicular twice in a year,
and therefore some of the Ancients believed this Zone inhabitable, by reason of
too much heat; but we know it to be otherways now a days.

The Northern temperate Zone is between the Tropic of Cancer and the Artick
Polar Circle: The Southern temperate Zone is between the Tropic of Capricorn,
and the Antartick Polar Circle. The Inhabitants of these Zones are termed
Heteroscians, that is, such as have their shadow but one way.

The Frigid Zones are within the Polar Circles, the Northern within the Artick,
and the Southern within the Antartick; the people of those two Zones are called
Periscians, signifying that they have shadows round them on all sides. To all
places in these Zones the Sun in Summer never sets for some days, and in the
Winter he never rises for as long time.

The Inhabitants of the World are distinguished after another manner, according
to the different Situation they have to one another; as into Antipodes,
Antoecians and Perioecians. The first are wholly opposite, and when it it is
Noon with us, with our Antipodes it is midnight, and they have Winter when we
have Summer. Our Antoecians have Noon and Midnight when we have them, but
Winter for our Summer. And our Perioecians have the same seasons that we have,
but the hours quite contrary; for when we have Noon it is Midnight with them.

Of Climates.
A Climate is a space of the Earth contained between two Circles. Betwixt the
beginning and end of a Climate, in the length of the longest day of Summer
there is half an hours difference. For the clearer understanding of this, it is
to be observed that Countries under the Equinoctial have all the year round
twelve hours day and twelve hours night; but as places recede and are distant
from the Equator, they become more and more unequal, and the days in Summer are
longer than the nights. This inequallity is marked by the Climats; so that when
on either side of the Equinoctial we find a place where the longest day of
Summer is of twelve hours and a half, that is the first Climate, and so
successively till we come to the Polar Circle, where the longest day of Summer
extends to twenty four hours: For beyond that Circle, the days increase by
whole days and months, until ye come to the Pole under which the whole year
makes but one day and one night, six months long a piece. Climats take their
names from the famous places through which they pass.

Now to know in what Climate one is, we must from the number of hours of the
longest Day in Summer subtract twelve, and double the Remainder; that is,
reduce them into half hours, and that will show the Climate wherein we live.

CHAP. I. Of some proper terms of Geography.
HAVING explained the Circles that are useful to this Science, we are now to
consider some terms and words which are peculiar to it.

Continent is a vast space of Earth, such as that which comprehends Europe,
Asia, and Africa; it is likewise called the main Land.

Island is a piece of Land surrounded with the Sea or other Water, and so
divided from the Continent.

Peninsula, that is to say, almost Island, is a part of the Earth encompassed
by the Sea on all hands, except on that part which joins it to the Continent:
the Greeks call it Chersonesus, a term sometimes made use of in Geography.

Isthmus is that Neck or Piece of Land that joins a Peninsula to the Continent.

Promontory is a high Land running out into the Sea. The Moderns call it a Cape.

Mountain is a part of the Earth higher than the rest that is about it.

Ocean is that vast body of Water which environs the Continents, and is
likewise called the Sea.

Gulf is an Arm of that Ocean running in between Lands. The Latins call it
Sinus, and sometimes it has the name of Sea.

Bay is likewise an Arm of the Ocean, but whose entrance is much wider than
that of a Gulf.

Port is a small part of Sea so hemb'd in by the Land, that Ships may there lie
in safety.

Harbor is the same thing almost.

Straight or Frith is commonly taken for a Channel that joins one Sea to
another, or a Gulf to the Ocean; there is also a Straight or Neck of Land,
which, as we have said, is called an Isthmus.

Banck is a heap of Sand in the Sea, which puts Vessels in danger.

A Shelf is much the same, on which, and on hidden Rocks near the Surface of
the Water Ships may split and be cast away.

Archipelago is a part of the Sea, where many Islands are.

River is a running Water that loses its streams in the Sea.

CHAP. II. The Division of the Earth and Sea.
THE most common Division of the Earth is into four parts, which are Europe,
Asia, Africa and America: the three first are comprehended in one Continent,
and is our old World; and the other makes an Island of it self, called the new
World, because it has not been discovered but since the Year one thousand four
hundred and ninety two: it is likewise called the West Indies in distinction
from the East Indies which are in Asia.

Some Geographers divide the Earth into six parts, adding to the four which we
have named, the Artick toward the Pole that gives it its name, and the
Antartick toward the South Pole: this is called Terra Australis incognita, or
the Southern Land undiscovered, and is thought to make a Continent as big as
Europe, Asia and Africa. Of these two last we shall speak at the end of this
Treatise.

Europe has Asia on the East separated from it by these limits, the Egean Sea
or Archipelago, the Streights of the Dardanelli, the Sea of Marmara, the
Streights of Constantinople, the Black Sea, the Streights of Caffa, the Sea
della Zabache, the River Tanais and a Line drawn from its most Eastern Bank to
the North Sea: it has the same Ocean on the North, the Atlantic Sea on the
West, and the Streights of Gibraltar and Mediterranean Sea that divides it from
Africa, on the South. From West to East, that is, from Cape St. Vincent, in
Spain, to Constantinople, it contains seven hundred seventy five French
Leagues; and from South to North, that is, from Cape Malee in Morea to the
Northern Cape of the Laplanders, eight hundred and twenty five Leagues.

Asia has to the West the same bounds that divide it from Europe, and the Red
Sea, with the Streights of Suez, that divide it from Africa; on the South the
Indian Ocean, the Ocean of China on the East, and on the North, the Sea of
Tartary, called Mare Glaciale. From East to West it contains seven hundred and
fifty Leagues, from the Archipelago to the Ocean of China: and from South to
North a thousand five hundred and fifty, reckoning from Malacca to the Sea of
Tartary.

Africa has on the North the Mediterranean Sea, on the East the Red Sea, with
the Isthmus of Suez that divide it from Asia, and the Indian Ocean: On the
South the Ethiopian Sea, which with the Atlantic Ocean is likewise to the West
of it. From West to East, that is, from Cape Blank, to the Cape of Guardafuy,
it contains a thousand six hundred and fifty Leagues: and from South to North,
that is, from the Cape of Good Hope, to the Mediterranean Sea, a thousand six
hundred and seventy. It is on all sides encompassed with the Sea, except that
narrow track of Land between the Red Sea and Mediterranean, which is not above
thirty Leagues in Length: so that it is a perfect Peninsula.

America has the North Sea to the East, the South Sea to the West, to the
South the Streights of Magellan, which divide it from the Terra del fuego, and
to the North unknown Lands or Seas. It is divided into two great Peninsulaes,
by the narrow Ibstmus of Panama, which is but eighteen Leagues over: From South
to North, that is, from the Streights of Magellan to the Northern Ocean, it
contains three thousand and fifty Leagues; and from West to East, toward
Mexico, two thousand nine hundred.

The Terra Australis, and that of the North, are so little known to us, that
their limits and extent cannot as yet be designed.

Having taken a view of the Earth, let us now cast our eyes on the Sea, which
takes diverse names according to the parts of the World where it is, or the
Countries it washes. That which encompasses Continents is called the Ocean;
and this likewise has different appellations, as on the West of Europe, and
part of Africa, it is called the Western or Atlantic Ocean; toward the Cape
of Good Hope, the Ethiopick Ocean; to the East of Africa, the Indian Sea; to
the East of Asia, the Eastern Ocean, or Sea of China; to the North of Asia, the
Sea of Tartary, and on the same side, and toward Europe, Mare Glaciale or the
Frozen Ocean; to the East of America, the North Sea, and to the West, the
South. These are the general denominations of the Sea, but it has also
particular names from the Countries that lie near to it.

The chief Gulfs or Bays of the Ocean are the Mediterranean Sea, which lies
betwixt Europe, Africa and Asia; the Red Sea, betwixt Africa and Asia; the Gulf
of Persia, and that of Bengala, in the East Indies; the Baltic Sea encompassed
by Germany, Sweden and Denmark; the Gulf of Mexico, and that of St. Laurence,
in America.

These Gulfs are joined to the Ocean by Streights; the Mediterranean Sea by the
Streights of Gibraltar; the Red Sea by that of Babel-mandel; the Persian Sea by
the Streights of Bassora, otherwise of Ormus. The Gulfs, or rather Bays of
Bengala, Mexico and St. Laurence have no Streights, because their mouth or
entry is very large.

The Baltic Sea has the famous Straight of the Sound.

The Mediterranean Sea has some noted Bays that well deserve to be mentioned.
Betwixt Italy and Dalmatia is the Gulf of Venice, called in ancient times the
Adriatic Sea. In Greece is the Gulf of Lepanto, heretofore of Corinth. And in
Macedonia that of Salonica, formerly of Thessalonica.

Between the Egean Sea, now called the Archipelago, and the Propontis or Sea of
Marmora, there is a Straight heretofore called the Hellespont, and at present
the Streights of Gallipoli, or the Dardanelli, and St. Georges Channel; between
the Sea of Marmora and the black Sea, formerly called the Euxin Sea, is the
Bosphorus of Thrace, which is now a days called the Channel of the Black Sea,
or Streights of Constantinople, because that famous City is seated there;
betwixt the Black Sea and the Palus Meotides, at present called the Sea delle
Zabache, is the Streights of Caffa, heretofore named the Cimmerian Bosphorus.

Betwixt the Island of Euboea, at present Negropont, and Greece, there is a
narrow passage of Sea, by the Ancients called Euripus, who have affirmed that
it ebbed and flowed seven times a day. There are some other famous Streights
which join several parts of the Ocean together; or to say better, the Ocean to
the Ocean it self.

Toward the Northern Ocean is the Streights of Waigatz, between Tartary and
nova Zembla; between Cathay and the Land of Jesso, is the Streights of Jesso;
between Japan and the Land of Jesso, is the Streights of Sengar; between the
same Land and Califurnia, is that of Anian; between Estotiland and Greenland,
is that of Davis; between Greenland and the Island of Elizabeth, is that of
Forbisher.

Toward Canada is that of Hudson, which according to the new Maps is properly
a Gulf.

Toward the Terra Australis is the famous Streights of Magellan, discovered by
him who gave it the name, in the year one thousand five hundred and twenty,
between America and the Terra del fuego.

Betwixt this Land and that of the States, is the Streights of Le Maire,
discovered in the year one thousand six hundred and sixteen.

And between that Land of the States and the Terra Australis, is the Streights
of Brouvers, discovered in the year one thousand six hundred and forty three.
These three last Streights join the North and South Seas together, and serve
for a passage from one to the other.

Between Califurnia and new Mexico, there is a Gut of Sea, or Streights, which
is called the Vermeillian Sea, and was taken for a Bay before that Califurnia
was discovered to be an Island.

We must not omit a Sea that is separated from all others, and which indeed is
but a Lake of a vast extent, and that is the Caspian Sea, called at present the
Sea of Bachu or Kilan. The Ancients imagined it to have been a Bay or Gulf of
the North Sea, but it is now known to be on all sides encompassed with Land; it
has Persia to the South, and Tartary to the North of it: In some Relations it
is reckoned to be eight hundred Leagues in Circumference.

Let us now give a hint of the greatest Rivers in the World, beginning with
those that fall into the Ocean, on all sides of our Continent or old World.

In Europe are the River Tagus, the Garronne, the Loyre, the Sein, the Scheld,
the Rhine and the Elbe.

In Asia the Oby, the yellow and blue Rivers, Ganges and Indus.

In Africa, Cuama, the River de Spiritu Sancto, the Zaire, and the Niger.

In America the Rivers of St. Laurence, Oranoque, the Amazons, and Rio de la
Plata.

Into the Mediterranean Sea on the side of Europe, fall the Ebre, the Rhosne,
and the Tiber; into the Gulf of Venice, the Po; into the Euxin Sea the Danube,
and the Borysthenes, now called Nieper, and the River Tanais runs into the
Palus Meotis.

On the African Shore the Mediterranean receives no famous River but the Nile.

In Asia, Euphrates and Tygris having mingled their streams fall into the
Persian Gulf, and the Volga into the Caspian.

The Oder and the Weissel, or Vistula, discharge themselves into the Baltic;
and the Duina into the White Sea.

We shall not speak of the chief Lakes till we come to describe the particular
Regions wherein they are:

But we will here subjoyn the most noted Mountains of the World, such as in
Europe are, the Pyrenees, the Alps and Appenine-Hills. In Asia, Taurus,
Caucasus and Imaus; in Africa, Atlas and the Mountains of the Moon: and in
America the Cordilleras or Andes. The Islands we shall describe as we come to
the several parts of the Earth near to which they lie.

Thus, Reader, you have a general description of the whole Earth, and Seas that
environs it, or fall into its bosom. We must now descend to a more particular
Description; and shall begin with that of Europe.

CHAP. III. Europe.
EUROPE
map of Europe

SPAIN
map of Spain

EVROPE, whereof we have already mentioned the limits, is the smallest, but
most considerable for Learning and Arts of the four parts of the World: it
comprehends the following Kingdoms and Regions. Spain, France, Italy, the Low
Countries, Germany, Hungary, Transylvania, Moldavia, Walachia, Bessarabia,
Dalmatia, Bosnia, Servia, Bulgaria, Romania, Greece, Norway, Denmark, Sweden,
Poland, Prussia, Lithuania, Livonia, or Liefland, Muscovy, and the lesser
Tartary. Its chief Islands in the Ocean, are Great Britain, Ireland, the
Orcades and Hebrides, Iseland, and the Azores. In the Mediterranean Sea,
Majorca, Minorca and Yvica, the Isle of Elbe, Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily,
Candia, Negropont, and many more in the Archipelago. We shall speak of its
Rivers, Lakes, and Mountains, when we treat of the Regions wherein they are.

CHAP. IV. Spain.
SPAIN is surrounded by Seas on three sides; on the East and South it is
watered with the Mediterranean, and the Famous Streights of Gibraltar divide it
from Africa; to the West it has the Atlantic Ocean, and to the North partly
the Cantabrick Ocean, or Bay of Biscay, and partly the Pyrenean Mountains that
reach from the Mediterranean to the Ocean, and divide it from France: most part
of its Provinces are honored with the Title of Kingdoms. On the Mediterranean
are Catalonia, of which the Metropolis is Barcelonna, a large City, with a
Seaport: the other Towns are Terragonna, an Archbishopric, Tortose, Gironne,
Lerde or Lerida.

The Kingdom of Valencia with a Metropolis of the same name, and Alicant; the
Country about which produces the best Wines in Spain.

The Kingdom of Murcia, the chief City whereof carries the same name. In this
Province stands Carthagena, a very good Seaport.

The Kingdom of Granada that has its name from its Metropolis lies to the West
of that, and has the Cities of Malaga and Almeria.

Andalusia is partly on the Mediterranean and Streights of Gibraltar, and
partly on the Ocean. Its chief City is Seville, (one of the loveliest Towns in
the World) seated on the Guadalquivir. Its other Towns are Cordova, the Native
place of Seneca and Lucan, Xeres from whence our Sherries come, Saint Lucar and
the Famous Port of Cadez or Cales, which stands in a small Island of that name,
very near to the Main on its East side.

The Provinces washed by the Ocean, are

The Kingdom of Algarve; its Cities are Sylvis and El Fare.

The Kingdom of Portugal, anciently called Lusitania; which has Lisbon a large
fair City, and Archbishopric for its Capital: the other chief Cities thereof
are Braga, an Archbishops See, Evora and Conimbre a Famous University; this is
now, and for many Ages has been subject to a King of its own independent of
Spain.

The Kingdom of Galicia has Compostella, where the Body of St. James is, for
its Metropolis, and Corunna a good Seaport: this is the North-West corner of
Spain.

Asturia, whereof Oviedo is the Metropolis, lies to the East of Galicia,
fronting the Bay of Biscay: and yet more Easterly on the same Coast lies
Biscay, whereof the chief City is Bilboe. And to this is adjoined Guipuscoa;
whereof Tolose or Tolosette is the Capital City: its other Cities are St.
Sebastian, which has a good Port, and Fontarabie. At the foot of the Pyrenees
are the Kingdoms of Navarre and Arragon.

Pampelonna is the Metropolis of the Kingdom of Navarre; its other Cities are
Victoria and Estella.

Sarragossa is the Capital City of the Kingdom of Arragon, and a University;
the others are Huesca, Alharazin, Calatayud, which some take for the ancient
Bilbilis, the Native Town of the Poet Martial: In the heart of Spain are Leon,
the two Castilles, the old and new, and Estremadura.

The Metropolis of the Kingdom of Leon bears the same name; Astorga and Semora
are its other Cities.

Bourgos, an Archbishops seat, is the Capital City of old Castille; its other
chief Towns are Valladolid, where some Kings of Spain have kept their Courts:
Palenca, Salamanca a famous University. Numance that heretofore resisted the
Roman Forces so long, was in this Province, but there remains no Footstep of it
at present.

Toledo is the Metropolis of new Castille, and the Archbishop of it is Primate
of all Spain, it is a stately and large City: The other chief Towns of that
Province are Madrid, the usual Residence of the Kings of Spain, and five
Leagues West from that, the famous Monastery of St. Laurence, called the
Escurial, built by Philip the Second, and before it was burnt, one of the most
Magnificent Fabrics in the World.

Alcala de Henares, famous for the University that Cardinal Ximenes Founded
there.

Each of the two Castilles is qualified with the Title of Kingdom.

Estremadura has two considerable Towns, Badajos and Merida.

The chief Capes in Spain are on the Mediterranean, Cape Palafagel in Catalonia
Cape Martin in the Kingdom of Valencia, Cape Palos in Murcia, and Cape de Gates
in the Kingdom of Granada, Cape St. Vincent in Algarbe, Cape de Spichel and de
Roca in Portugal, and Cape Finisterre and Cape Ortogal in Galicia, and Cape de
las Pennas in Asturia.

The chief Rivers that fall into the Mediterranean are the Ebre or Iberus,
which runs through Arragon and Catalonia, and passes by Sarragossa and Tortose;
the Guadalaviar that passes by Valencia, and the Xucar in the same Kingdom; the
Guadalentia in the Kingdom of Murcia: those that discharge themselves into the
Ocean, are the Guadalquivir, otherways Betis, that runs through Andalusia, and
passes by Cordova and Sevil, and empties it self into the Sea at St. Lucar de
Barrameda: the Guadania in Estremadura, which River, a little above Merida,
runs under ground for several Leagues, and then breaks out again.

The Tagus which waters new Castile and Portugal, passes by Toledo and Lisbon.

The Douero that runs through old Castile and Portugal, and the Minho that
divides Portugal from Galicia.

The chief Mountains are the Pyreneans, Sierra Morena, Sierra D' Alcaraz,
Sierra D' Albarazin, and the Sierra Nevada, commonly called the Granadas.

The Isles upon the Coasts of Spain, are the Isle of Cadiz in the Ocean; and
near to Andalusia, the Baleares, to wit, Majorca and Minorca, the Isles of
Yvica and Formentera in the Mediterranean.

The King of Spain is not at present Master of all these Provinces, for
Portugal and Algarbe belong to the King of Portugal; and the King of France has
made some encroachments in Catalonia.

There is no Religion professed in Spain but the Roman Catholic.

CHAP. V. France.
FRANCE is bounded on the East by Italy, from which it is divided by the River
Var and the Alps; by Savoy, Switzerland, the Franche Comte, Germany, and the
Low Countries, which are likewise to the North of it, with the Channel or
Narrow Sea that divides it from England; on the West by the Ocean, and on the
South by the Pyrenean Hills and the Mediterranean. We shall first describe its
Provinces that are washed by the Ocean, proceeding from North to South.

Pieardie has Amiens for its Capital City; the other more considerable Towns
are Abbeville, Perone, Roye, Corbie, St. Quintin, Calais and Boulogne, which
two are Seaports; Soissons, Laon, Beauvais, Montrueil, Dourlans, Crecy, where
Philip de Valois lost a Battle to the English, Guise and Rhetel.

Normandy has Rouen its Capital; its other principal Towns are Eureux, Bayeux,
Caen, Diepe, Constance, Auranche, and Havre de Grace.

Bretagne whereof Rennes is the Capital City, Nantes, Vannes, S. Malo,
Beauport, Lantriguier, Breast and Blavet, are its other Towns.

Poictou contains Poictiers its chief Towns, Luson, Maillezais, Niord,
Fontenay, Chastelleraud: Rochel is in the Aulnis.

Xaintonge has for its Capital Xaintes, where some Roman Antiquities are still
to be seen; its other Towns are Blay and St. John d' Angeli.

Guienne has Bourdeaux upon the Garonne for its principal City; at the mouth
of that River stands the Tower of Cordouan, a stately building, and serves for
a Sea Mark to Ships. Under the name of Guienne several Countries are
comprehended, as the Agenois, where are Agea, Marmande, Clairae; the Condomois,
where are Condom and Nerac. The County D' Armagnac, where are Auch and
Lectoure; the County of Cominges, where are Bertrand, Coserans and Lombez; the
other Towns of Guienne are Bazas, Airs, Acqs and Bayonne.

FRANCE
map of France

The Basse Navarre lies at the foot of the Pyrenees; its chief Towns are
Palais, and St. John de Pied de Port.

The Principality of Bern is likewise at the foot of these Mountains; its
Capital is Pau, and the other Towns of any note, are Oleron and Lescar.

Bigorre has Tarbes for its Capital; Bagueres is likewise considerable there,
because of its hot Baths from whence it has its name.

The County of Foix lies at the foot of the same Mountains; besides its chief
Town of the same name, it has the Town of Pamies.

The County of Roussillon taken from the Spaniard has the same Situation, and
Perpignan is its Capital.

Languedoc comes next, and stretches along the Mediterranean which it has to
the South, being bounded on the North by the Mountains of Anvergue. The Rhosne
divides it from Provence and Dauphine on the East, and Guienne borders on it to
the West; its Capital City is Tholonze, Montpelier is the next: the Bishops
seat was at Maguelonne, which is now ruined, nothing remaining but two
Churches. It stood in an Isle in the middle of a Pool or Lake, which has
Communication with the Sea. This is that Town which Ptolomy calls Agatha, and
which some Geographers take for Agde; but that Authors calls this last
Agathopolis, near the Eraut, which removes all doubt: besides, that he calls
Agatha an Isle and City. Now there never was any City in an Isle upon that
Coast, except Maguelonne alone, which changed its name with the Fate and Wrack
of the Roman Empire. It is somewhat strange that the greatest Geographers
should have been ignorant of this which is so easy to be perceived by any that
will consider Ptolomy and the Situation of that Country. I make this remark in
favor of Montpellier, which is enlarged by the Ruins of Maguelonne; enriched
with its spoils, and adorned with its Bishopric which was transferred thither
by Pope Paul the third, in the Reign of Francis the first, the Year one
thousand five hundred and thirty six. The other Towns of Languedoc, are
Narbonne, an ancient Roman Colony, as well as Nismes, which by its stately
Antiquities still shows what was heretofore the splendour of that place: There
is an Amphitheatre, the most entire of any that is to be seen of that kind in
the World, a Royal Palace, and some other magnificent Relics of the Roman
Age. Four Leagues from this City is a stately Aqueduct, which is called the
Pont du Guard, because it is upon a River of that name. Carcasson, Besiers,
Agde, Viviers and Beaucaire, famous for the Fair of Magdalent, are the other
Towns of this Province, which is one of the pleasantest in France.

Provence is divided from Languedoc, that lies to the West of it, by the
Rhosne, and from the County of Nice, which it has to the East, by the Var; and
from Piemont by the Alps, it has the Mediterranean to the South, and Dauphine
to the North: its chief Towns are Aix its Capital, Marseilles, Arles, Frejul,
Thoulon one of the best Seaports in France, Hieres and some others: St.
Maximin preserves the Body of Mary Magdalen.

The County of Venaissen that belongs to the Pope is shut in within the limits
of this Province, its Towns are Avignon, Carpentras, Cavaillon and Vaison.

The Principality of Orange belonging to the Princes of the House of Nassaw,
who from thence have their Title, is inlocked within the County of Venaissin.
There is no considerable Town in it, but that of Orange, where are the Ruins of
an Amphitheater, and a Triumphal Arch of Marius.

Dauphine, which is divided from Languedoc by the Rhosne, and from Piemont by
the Alps, contains these principal Towns following; Grenoble its Capital, and
Ambrun; this upon the Durance, and that upon the Isere: Vienna and Valence upon
the Rhosne, both very ancient.

The Lyonnois is to the North of Dauphine, and Lions, one of the greatest and
fairest Cities of France, is its Capital; it is situated on a point where the
Saone mingles its still and gentle waters with the rapid streams of the Rhosne:
it has no other Towns of great note.

Bresse is to the North of the Lyonnois; its chief Towns are Bourg in Bresse,
Montluel, Pont de Vaux, and St. Julian.

The Principality of Dombes, which belongs to Mademoiselle of Montpensier,
Cousin German to the King of France, is enclosed within Bresse; the chief Town
of it is Trevoulx.

The Duchy of Burgundy lies Northward from the Lyonnois, between which and it,
are the Beaujolois, the chief Town whereof is Ville Franche, and the Maronnois,
that takes its name from the Town of Maron: the chief Towns of Burgundy are
Dijon the Capital, Authun an ancient Town, Chalons on the Saone, Beaune, Semur
and Langres; some place Sens and Auxerre here.

Champaign has Burgundy to the South, and Picardy to the North; its chief
Towns are Rheins Troyes, Chalons on the Marne, Bar on the Sein, Bar on the
Aube, Nogent, Chaumont in Basigny and Joinville. Seeing Champaign joins
Picardy, and that we began the Description of the Circuit of France by this, we
will end it here, that we may view the middle of the Kingdom, and describe the
Provinces that lie there, proceeding from North to South.

Brie lies to the West of Champaign; its chief Towns are Meaux, Province,
Lagny, Bricomte-Robert and Montereau.

France, properly so called, lies West from Brie, and has Picardy to the
North; it comprehends the Prevostie and Vicecounty of Paris, the Isle of
France, the Valois, the Heurepois, and the Gastinois: Paris is the Metropolis
of all this Kingdom, the Residence of the Kings, and one of the fairest Cities
in the World. In the Isle of France is St. Denis, the burying place of the
French Kings; Poissi, St Germain, and Montmorency are the other more remarkable
Towns thereof. In the Valois are Crespi, Senlis; and Beauvois, with the
Beauvoisis, is by some also placed there. In the Heurepois are Melun, Corbeil,
Moret: in the Gastinois are Montargis, Nemours, Estampes, Milly Chastillon and
Fontainbleau, where the French King has a stately House in a vast Forest.

The Beausse has for chief Towns, Orleans, Chartres, Dreux, Chasteaudun,
Vandosme, Meun, Nogent le Roy and Blois.

Perch has for principal Towns, Nogent Le Retrou, Molesme and Mortagues.

Anjou has Angiers, Saumeur and La Fleehe.

Tourain has Tours, which gives it the name, Amboise, Loches, Chinon, where
Rablais was born, Loudun and some others.

Sologne has Remorantin, Gergeau and Sully.

Berry, which is almost in the middle of France, has Bourges its chief Town,
Sancerre, Yssoudun, Vierzon, Dun Le Roy and Selles.

The Nivernois has Nevers.

The Bourbonnois has Moulins, Bourbon L' Ancy, and Bourbon L' Archamband.

The Forest has St. Estienne de Feuran, Mont Brison, Feurs, and Rouenne.

Auvergne is divided into the upper and lower; in this are the Towns of
Clermont, Ryons, Montferraud, and the Castle of Montpensier: in the upper, St.
Flour and Aurilhac.

Lymoisin has Limoges its Capital Town, Segur and Chalus, which are in the
upper; and Tulles, Vzerche and Brive in the lower, called otherways La March.

Quercy has for Capital Cahors, the other considerable Towns are Montauban and
Moissac.

Perigord has Perigueux, Sarlat, Bergerac and Miremont.

Rouvergne has Rhodez, Ville Franche, and Milland.

The Angoulmois, Angoulesme, Chateau-neuf, Coignac and Jarnac, where the bloody
Battle was fought in time of Charles the Ninth, which bears that name. And this
is a brief Description of all the Provinces of France.

We must now see what Rivers water it. Those that run into the Ocean are the
Garonne, the Charente, the Loyre, the Sein and the Sum. Into the
Mediterranean Sea, the Aude, the Eraud, and the Rhosne.

The Garonne has its source in the Pyrenean Hills, runs through Guienne,
passes by Thoulouze and Bourdeaux, receives into it the Ariege, the Lot, the
Tarn and the Dordogne, and falls into the Ocean near to Bourdeaux.

The Charente passes by Angoulesme and Xaintes.

The Loyre has its Head in Languedoc, among the Mountains of Vivarezi; from
whence it enters into the Forests, and passes by Rouenne, where it begins to
carry Boats, it runs through the Bourbonois, the Nivernois, Beausse, Tourain
and Anjou, passes by Nevers, Orleans, Blois, Amboise, Tours, Saumeur, and
entering a little into Bretaign, and having washed Nantes, it discharges it self
into the Ocean, carrying with it the Allier, the Clein, the Creuse, the Cher,
the Vienne, the Main, and many Rivulets.

The Sein comes out of Burgundy, waters Champaign, the Isle of France and
Normandy; it passes through Paris, and by Rouen, and being increased by the
Marne, the Youne, the Oyse, and some other Rivers, it is embraced by the Ocean
near Havre De-grace.

The Sum springs out of Picardy, runs through it, and forsakes not that
Province till it lose it self in the Ocean, after it has washed Amiens,
Abbeville, and several other Towns of that Country, from whence the Escaut, or
Scheld, springs also.

The Aude come from the Pyrenean Mountains, and runs by Carcassonne and
Narbonne.

The Eraud comes from the Sevenes, and passes by Agde, the Orb by Beziers,

The Rhosne has its source in Mount St. Gothard among the Alps, runs through
the Lake of Geneva, passes by Lions, Vienne, Valence, under the Pont St.
Esprit, by Avignon, Beaucaire, Arles, and receives into it the Saone, the
Isere, the Droume, the Durance, the Ardeche, the Gardon; and by its Branches
having made an Island which is called Camargue, (from Cajus Marius, corrupting
Caii Marii Ager, into Camargue,) it falls into the Mediterranean

There are in France fifteen Archbishopricks, and comprehending Avignon,
sixteen, which are Rouen, Tours, Bourdeaux, Auch, Thoulouze, Narbonne, Arles,
Aix, Ambrun, Vienne, Lions, Sens, Rheims, Paris, Bourges and Avignon, and above
an hundred Bishoprics.

There are ten ancient Parliaments which are established at Paris, Rouen,
Rennes, Bourdeaux, Pau, Thoulouze, Aix, Grenoble, Dijon and Metz, and two new
ones, the one at Tournay for the French Conquests in the Netherlands, the other
at Besancon for the Franche Comty.

Its Isles in the Ocean are Belle-Isle, on the Coast of Bretaign,; Neirmonsteir
on the Coast of Poitou; the Isles of Re and Oleron on the Coasts of Aunis and
Xaintonge: In the Mediterranean are the Isles of Hieres, of St. Margaret, and
St. Honorat on the Coast of Provence.

Its Mountains besides the Alps and Pyrenees, are those of Auvergne and
Sevenes, which the Ancients called Montes Cebennae, the name not much as yet
altered.

There are besides, Mount Jura, or St. Claude, which is toward Switzerland,
and Mount Vogese, or Faucilles, toward the Diocese of Langres.

The Catholic Religion is the public established Religion in France, yet the
Protestant is permitted there: And thus, Reader, you have a short draught of a
large and flourishing Kingdom, under the Dominion of a great and powerful
Prince.

Before we proceed to Italy, we must pass over into Savoy, which is enclosed
within France: This Duchy belonging to a Prince who carries the Title of it,
has to the North the Lake of Geneva and Switzerland, to the East Piemont, and
Dauphine to the South and West; the chief Towns of it are Chambrey its Capital
City, Montmelian and Foussigny. The County of Morienne, where St. John stands,
and the Tarantaise, where Monstier is, which are in the Alps, belong to the
Duke of Savoy, as well as Piemont, and the Marquisat of Saluces, of which we
shall speak in the Description of Italy. Geneva lying at the end of a great
Lake that carries its name, heretofore belonged to the Duke of Savoy, but at
present it owns no Superior, and is erected into a Commonwealth.

CHAP. VI. Italy.
ITALY has on the West the River Var and the Alps which divide it from
France, and the Mediterranean Sea; it is divided from Germany by the same
Mountains on the North, on part of which side also is the Gulf of Venice: it
has to the East the Ionian Sea, and to the South the Sea of Tuscany. This
Region resembles the Leg and Thigh of a man, or (if you had rather) a Boot.

The Apennine Hills stretch along the whole length of it; and it is divided
into several states under the Dominion of diverse Princes. The Pope possesses
the Ecclesiastic State, in which are the Campania of Rome, the Patrimony of
St. Peter, the Dutchies of Spoleto, Vrbin and Ferrara the Mark of Ancona,
Romania and the Boulognois: and in the Kingdom of Naples, the Duchy of
Benevent. The King of Spain possesses the Kingdom of Naples, the Duchy of
Milan, and some places on the side of Tuscany, with the Marquisat of Final, on
the Frontiers of Genoa. The Duke of Florence is Master of the greatest part of
Tuscany. The Duke of Savoy holds Piemont, the Marquisat of Saluces, and the
County of Nice. The Duke of Parma, the Dutchies of Parma and Placentia, and the
Duchy of Castro. The Duke of Mantua, the Duchy of Mantua and Montferrat. The
Duke of Modena, the Dutchies of of Modena and Regio. The Prince of Massa the
Principality that gives him the Title. The Prince of Mirandola, the
Principality of the same name. The Bishop of Trent is Prince of his own
Bishopric: it contains four Republics, two that are great, to wit, of Venice
and Genoa, and two lesser, of Lucca and St. Marin. The Republic of Venice
possesses part of Istria, (the rest belonging to the House of Austria) Frioli,
the Mark Trevisane, il Dogado, the Padonan, the Veronese, the Vicentin, the
Bressian, and the Bergamaske. The Republic of Genoa possesses that which is
called Riviera di Genoa; that of Lucca but little, and that of St. Marin less.
We are now to take a view of of all these States in order, Coasting along by
the Sea which environs that sweet Country, and proceeding from West to East.

Having passed the Var, we come into the County of Nice, wherein is a City of
the same name, and that of Villa Franca.

Monaco which belongs to its own Prince; the Marquisat of Final with a Town of
the same name.

The Riviera de Genoa, wherein are the Metropolis of Genoa, (which is called in
Italian, La Superba, the Stately, and is one of the most beautiful Towns in
Italy,) Savona, Albenga, and some others.

Tuscany is separated from the Riviera de Genoa by La Macra; it reaches to the
Campania of Rome on the East, and has that Sea which carries its name on the
South, and the Apennines on the North. The Duke of Florence who takes the Title
of great Duke of Tuscany, is Master of the greatest part of it. The chief Towns
in his Territories are Florence, the Capital City, Pisa, Siena, Volterra,
Pistoia, and Legorn, a Seaport Town. The small State of the Republic of
Lucca, the Principality of Massa, and the Stato delli Presidi, in which are the
Towns Orbitello, Porto Hercole, and Piombino, that belong to the King of Spain,
are in Tuscany; as also the Duchy of Castro, which belongs to the Duke of
Parma, having a Town of the same name, and the Patrimony of St Peter, wherein
are Viterbo, Montefiascone, and some others: Aquapendente, Peruga near a Lake
that bears its name. Orvieta and Civita Vecchia, a fair Port where the Pope
keeps his Galleys, are likewise in Tuscany.

The Campania of Rome, in ancient times called Latium, has to the East La
Terra d' Lavoro of the Kingdom of Naples, to the South, the Sea, to the West
Tuscany, from which it is separated by the Tibre, and to the North Abruzzo; its
Capital City is Rome, so famous that none can compare with it: heretofore it
gave Laws to the whole World almost, and at present extends its power farther
than ever, seeing the Popes exercise their Authority in America, where the
Consuls and Emperors of Rome were never known: There are many prints of its
ancient splendour still extant, as the Pantheon, which goes by the name of Santa
Maria Rotunda, the Pillars of Trajan and Antonin, Amphitheaters, Baths,
Aqueducts, and many other stately remains of Antiquity, which by their Ruins
publish the Roman Magnificence and Grandeur: it stands upon the Tiber, at the
mouth of which River is the Town of Ostia. The other Towns of the Campania of
Rome, are Tivoli, formerly Tybur, where are excellent Waters, Avagnia,
Palestrine, which is the ancient Preneste, Veletri, heretofore Velitrae, where
Augustus was born, Terracine, and some others.

The Kingdom of Naples is bounded on the West, by the State of the Church, and
on all other sides by the Sea; to wit, the Sea of Tuscany on the South, that of
Ionia on the East, and the Gulf of Venice on the North: it is divided into
several Provinces; on the Tuscan Sea are, Terra di Lavoro, of which Naples is
the Capital City, that has a good Port, the others are, Capoua, Pussoli,
Cajette, and Baiae that is ruined: The Principality wherein Salerne is*
Calabria that contains Cosenca and Regio. The Basilicate and Principality of
Tarento, lie on the Ionian Sea; and on the Gulf of Venice, the Country of
Otranto, that has a Town of the same name, and the Land of Bari, in which are
Bari and Brindisi; Apulia, wherein is Manfredonia; Abruzzo, whereof the Capital
Town is Aquila: And in that Province also is the Duchy of Benevento that
belongs to the Church.

The Mark of Ancona lies likewise on the Gulf of Venice, in which is a Town of
the same name, and that of our Lady of Loretto, that is much frequented upon
the account of Devotion.

Next after comes Romania; its Capital City is Ravenna, and the others are,
Faensa, Forli and Imola.

The Boulognois has Bononia for its Capital, which is one of the fairest Cities
of Italy: The Duchy of Ferrara with its Metropolis of the same name is
Situated on the Po.

The Duchy of Venice, wherein is comprehended that delicate City built upon
Piles in the Sea.

Frioli, where are Vdena, and the Ruins of Aquilea.

Istria, which belongs partly to the Venetians, and partly to the Archdukes of
Austria, bounds Italy on that side; the chief Towns of it are, Cabo d' Istria,
Tergeste, Parentia and Pola.

The Marque, or Mark Trevisane, has Trevisa, Verona and Vicensa.

The Bishopric of Trent stretches along the Alps; and its chief City is
famous for the last Council held there: the Bishopric of Bellona is in the
same Province also.

The Duchy of Milan has the Alps on the North, Piemont on the West, Parma on
the South, and the Venetian State on the East; Milan its Capital, is one of the
greatest Towns of Europe, and its Castle one of the best Fortresses: in the
same Province are also Pavia, Cremona, Novarra, Lodi, Como and Vigevano. The
Metropolis of Piemont, is Turin on the Po, a lovely City where the Dukes of
Savoy keep their Court: Pignerol a strong place belonging to France, is in the
same Province. Carmagnole is the chief Town of the Marquisat of Saluces, as
Casal is in Montferrat.

The Dutchies of Parma, Placentia, Modena and Regio, have their Capital Cities
of the same names.

The Duchy of Mantua has likewise a City of the same name, built in the
middle of a Lake on the River Mince.

These Dutchies that we have now named, lie in that part of Italy which the
Romans called Gallia Cisalpina, because the Gauls were planted there, and that
as to them it was on this side of the Alps; it was afterward called Lombardy,
from the Lombards that Conquered it, which name it still retains: it is on the
South shut up by the Apennine Hills, the Alps on the North and West, and by
the Gulf of Venice and the River Pisaura, or Foglia, on the East. A great part
of the Venetian State lies in that Region, as Crema a strong Town, Bergamo with
its Territory, and Eresse, or Brescia, wirh its Dependances.

The Duchy of Spoleto, and that of St. Vrbin, which belongs to the Holy See,
have each of them a Capital Town of the same name, and are Situated upon the
Apennine Mountains in the Center of Italy. In the first is the Town of Assise,
where St. Francis was born; within the second is enclosed the little Republic
of St. Marin, under the Protection of the Pope.

The chief Rivers of Italy that fall into the Mediterranean, are the Var, which
runs through the County of Nice, and divides it from Provence; the Magra, which
divides Liguria, called Riviera di Genoa, from Tuscany; the Arne, that passes
by Florence and Pisa; the Tiber, that runs by Rome, and is augmented by
Teverone and Chiara; the Garigliano, heretofore Liris, and the Vulturno.

Into the Gulf of Venice fall, Lofanto, Pescara, and Tronto, which are in the
Kingdom of Naples, the Foglia, that is is in the Mark of Ancona.

Rubicon, at present, Pisatello, that heretofore divided Gallia Cisalpina from
the West of Italy.

The Po, which is the greatest River of Italy, and rises in Mount Viso, one of
the Alps; it passes by Turin, and through the Duchy of Milan, goes into the
Lands of Mantua, and Ferrara, and from thence into the Gulf of Venice; having
swallowed up in its passage the Doria, the Tezin, the Ada, the Oglio, the
Mince, the Taner, and several other Rivers.

The Adige passes by Trent and Verona.

The Brenta passes by Padua.

Tagliamento and Lizousa wash Friuli: Rizano Istria; and Arsa divides it from
Dalmatia.

There are considerable Lakes in Italy: in Lombardy is the Lake Major,
heretofore called Verbanus, out of which comes the Tezin.

The Lake of Como, anciently called Larius, out of which comes the Ada; the
Lake of Isseo, whence comes the Oglia; the Lake of Lugano, and another called
de Garda, which produces the Mince.

SICILIA
map of Sicily

In Tuscany is the Lake Thrasimene, at present called the Lake of Perugia: the
Lake Vulsin, now of Bolsena, and the Lake of Braciano, heretofore Sabutinus.

In the Campania of Rome, are the Lake Fucin, the Lake Fundi, and the Lake
Albanus, now called Lago di Castello Gandolfo.

The chief Islands of this Country, are Elbe, Corsica, Sardinia, Ischia,
Caprea, Sicily, and some others.

The Isle of Elbe is near the Shore of Tuscany: it has a Town called
Cosmopolis, and a Mountain of Loadstone: it belongs partly to the great Duke of
Tuscany, and partly to the King of Spain.

Corsica is over against the Riviera of Genoa, and belongs to that Republic;
its chief Town is La Bastia, and best Port that of St. Boniface.

Sardinia is divided from Corsica by an Aim of the Sea; it lies to the South of
Corsica, and belongs to the King of Spain: the chief Town of it is Calari, and
the others are Oristagna, Sassari and Algeri.

Near to Naples is the Isle of Ischia, with a Fort of the same name, and
Caprea, famous for the Residence of Tiberius, is likewise there.

Sicily is the greatest Island of the Mediterranean, it is dis-joyned from
Italy, (to which it is thought to have been anciently united) by a narrow
Branch of the Sea, called the Fare of Messina; the chief Towns of it are
Palermo, its Capital, the Residence of the Viceroy, Messina, Trepano, Girgenti,
Syracusa, and Catanea, near to which is the famous Mount Aetna that vomiteth
out fire, called at present Mount Gibello: this Island belongs to the King of
Spain.

The Isles of Lipare are not far from this, some of which cast out Fire.

In the Gulf of Venice, and near to Mount Gargan, are the Isles of Diomedes, at
present of Sancta Maria del Trinita.

The Mountains of Italy are the Alps that limit it, and the Apennine Hills
that run through it. Not far from Naples is Mount Vesuvius, which has often
cast out Fire, but not at present, it is now called Monte di Sommo, and
produces excellent Wine. In Apulia is Mount Gargan, now di Santo Angelo.

There is no Religion but the Roman Catholic professed in Italy: and the least
Towns of it are Bishoprics.

CHAP. VII. The Low Countries.
BEFORE we pass into Germany, we must view the Low Countries, because they lie
between it and France. They have Germany to the East and North, the Ocean to
the West, and France to the South. They are divided into seventeen Provinces,
to wit, four Dutchies, seven Counties, five Signiories or Lordships, and the
Marquisat of the holy Empire. The Dutchies are Brabant, the Capital of which is
Brussels, the Residence of the Governors of the Low Countries for the King of
Spain; its other Towns are Louvain, Antwerp, Boisleduc, and many others.

The Duchy of Limbourg, which has a Capital of the same name.

The Duchy of Luxembourg which has its principal Town of the same name also:
its other considerable Towns are Arlon, Thionville, Danvilliers and Montmedy.

The Duchy of Gueldres that has a Town likewise of the same name, and
Nimeguen a place of importance.

The County of Flanders has Gbent for its Capital; the other considerable
Towns are Bruges, Ipre, Courtray, and (upon the Sea) Sluse, Newport, Ostend,
Dunkirk and Graveline; which two last belong to the Crown of France.

The County of Artois has Arras for Capital, belonging likewise to France, the
other Towns are Beaupaume, Bethune, and St. Omer, taken in the late Wars by the
French.

The County of Hainault has Mons for Capital, Valenciennes, Bouchain,
Mariembourg and Landrecy.

The County of Namur has its Capital of the same name, Bouvines and Charlemont.

The County of Zutphen has its chief Town of the same name also: it is
comprehended under the Duchy of Gueldres.

The County of Holland has very fair Cities, as Amsterdam its chief, Harlem,
Leyden, Dort, Roterdam, and several others. The Hague is but a Town, yet there
the Assembly of the States, and Court of the Prince of Orange are kept.

The County of Zealand is composed of several Isles, made by the branches of
the Escaut, or Scheld; the chief is the Isle of Walkeren, in which are the
Towns of Middleburg and Flushing.

The Marquisat of the Holy Empire is no more but the City and Territory of
Antwerp, comprehended under Brabant.

The Signiory or Province of Malines contains likewise only the Town of the
same name, with its Territory enclosed within Brabant.

The Signiory or Province of Vtrecht has a large and beautiful Town of the
same name, and besides Rhenen, Amersfort, Montfort and Wik at Duerstede.

The Signiory or Province of Over Issel is so called, because in respect of the
other Provinces of the Low Countries, it is on the other side of the Issel,
which is a branch of the Rhine, and is by the Latins called Transissulana: its
Towns are Deventer, Swoll, Campen, Steenwick, Cowerden, and Oldenzeel.

The Signiory or Province of West-Friesland has these remarkable Towns,
Lewarden, Dockum, Franiker, Staveren, and Harlingen.

The Signiory or Province of Groningen, has the Town which gives it its name,
and another small Town called Dam.

The Low Countries are watered with pleasant Rivers, which are the Scheld, the
Meuse, and the Rhine; the Scheld has its Source in Picardy, passes by
Valenciennes, Tournay, Ghent and Antwerp; and having embraced the Isles of
Zealand, and received the supplies of the Lys, the Lieue, the Dender, the
Rupel, and some other Rivers, it falls into the Ocean.

The Meuse comes from the Mount of Vauge in the Diocese of Langres, passes by
Charlemont, Bouvines, Namur, Maestricht, Grave, and joining with the Wahal, one
of the Branches of the Rhine, it receives the Sambre and some other Rivers.

We shall speak of the Rhine when we treat of Germany.

The nineteen Provinces, or Low Countries, falling to the Crown of Spain by
Mary, Heiress of the House of Burgundy, some of them Revolted, and erected
themselves into a Commonwealth, by the name of the States of the United
Provinces, commonly called the States of Holland: they are composed of Holland,
Zealand, Vtrecht, Over-Issel, West-Friesland, Groningen, Gueldres, and Zutphen.
The Assembly of the States General is held at the Hague, and since their
settlement, the Princes of Orange have been the Generals of their Armies.
Calvin's Reformation is the Religion publicly established; but the Catholic,
Lutheran, Anabaptist, Socinian, and many other Religions are tolerated there.

The French in the late Wars Conquered many considerable places of the Spanish
Netherlands, some of which have been made over to that Crown, by the Spaniard,
in the last Treaty of Peace concluded at Nimeguen; so that the Spanish Interest
in these Provinces is at present much impaired and weakened.

Before we proceed further, it is to be observed, that the Cambresis and
Bishopric of Liege are enclosed within the Low Countries.

The Cambresis lies between Artois and Hainault, and has Picardy to the South:
the City of Cambray that gives it the name is a spacious and fair Town,
belonging now to the French King.

The Bishopric of Liege has to the North and West Brabant, Luxemburg on the
South, and Limbourg on the East. The City of Liege is very fair and spacious,
lying on the Meuse; the Bishop of it is Sovereign Prince of all his Diocese,
which comprehends the Duchy of Bouillon, the Towns of Maseyk and Tongres, with
the Borough of Spa, famous for its Medicinal Waters.

The Duchy of Juliers has its name from the chief City thereof; it has also
Berge and Duern. Aix la Chapelle is in this Duchy, and there Charlemaign kept
his usual Residence; it was the seat of his Empire, and the place of his
Burial: He Beautified it with many stately Buildings, with a Church Dedicated
to the Holy Virgin, that still remains, and a Palace, which in the time of
Charles the Bald, in the Year eight hundred and eighty one, was by the Fury of
the Normans reduced to Ashes. It has Mineral Waters about it, proper for the
Cure of several Maladies, from whence it took its Latin name, Aquisgranum, the
Germans call it Acken, and a third of it belongs to the Duke of Juliers.

The Duchy of Lorrain may be reckoned among the Provinces of France, being now
in the possession of that King; its Capital City is Nancy, the other Towns
thereof are Marsal, Saint Nicholas, Pont a Mouson and some others: Mets, Toul
and Verdun are likewise in Lorrain, and belong to the French King.

The County of Burgundy, called the Franche-County, lies to the East of a
Duchy of the same name belonging to France; but the County belonged formerly
to the King of Spain, though lately Conquered by France: The chief Towns of it
are Dole, the Capital, Bezanson, an Imperial City, Vesoul, Grez, Cromay,
Salins, Arbois, Poligny, Nozeret and others. The Doux a sweet River, waters
that Country, and passes by Dole: it afterward loses it self in the Saone,
which divides the Duchy of Burgundy from the County.

Abidos in Asia, where are two Castles called the Dardanelli, which defend the
passage to the Sea of Marmora and Constantinople.

CHAP. XIII. Greece.
UNDER the name of Greece were anciently comprehended, Macedonia, Epirus,
Thessaly, Phocis, Baeotia, Achaia, Peloponesus, and some other Provinces which
have now lost both names and their limits: they are environed by the Egean Sea
or Archipelago on the East, by the Cretan or Sea of Candy on the South, by the
Ionian and Adriatic Seas on the West, and Maesia on the North.

The chief Towns of Macedonia, are Salonichi, heretofore Thessalonica, Pella
famous for the birth of Alexander, and Stagira for that of Aristotle. Mount
Athos, now called Monte-Santo, and the River Strimon are in this Province.

Croia is the Capital of Albania, heretofore called Epirus; its other Towns are
Durazzo, La Valona and Scutari.

The Cities of Thessaly are Larissa and Pharsalia, whose Fields were dyed with
the Roman blood in that famous Battle wherein Caesar overcame Pompey; there is
the River Peneus, and the Valley of Tempe, the Mounts Olympus, Ossa and Pelion,
so Celebrated in the Writings of the ancient Poets.

Phocis had in ancient times the City of Delphos, with the Temple of Apollo,
renowned for its Oracle all the World over; there you may see the Mount
Parnassus, heretofore Sacred to the Muses, and so Celebrated by the Poets, now
inhabited by nothing but ignorance and Barbarism.

Thebes was the Capital of Baeotia, where Bacchus, Hercules and Pindaer were
born.

Attica was the chief Province of Achaia, and in it was Athens, the Nursery of
many great Men; it was the Residence of the Learned and the Heroes: there
remain in it now but some pitiful ruinous places, which are called Setines,
Megara, Eleusis, and some others.

Pelopenesus, called at present Morea, is almost and Island joined to Achaia by
a Neck of Land, which was called the Isthmus of Corinth, from the adjoining
City of that name: the other Towns were Mycene, Argos, Sycione, Pisa, (where
the Olympic Games were Celebrated, and where that famous Statue of Jupiter
Olympus stood, which was reckoned one of the seven wonders of the World.)
Sparta or Lacedaemon, all Famous and Learned Cities, but now buried under their
own Ruins and Barbarity, as all Greece is, which though heretofore the School
of the Liberal Arts and Sciences, is now plunged into an abyss of ignorance,
and groans under the Tyranny of the Turks. These follow the Religion of their
Prophet Mahomet, and the Native Greeks that of the Greek Church.

CHAP. XIV. The States of Denmark and Sueden.
WE must now visit the North, and take a view of those Countries which lie
under Frozen Climates.

The King of Denmark possesses there the Cymbrian Chersonesus, now called
Jutland; Norway, and several Islands in the Baltic Sea, whereof the chief are
Funzen and Zealand.

South Jutland comprehends the Dutchies of Sleswick, with its City of the same
name, and Holsace or Holstein, wherein are Segeberg, Hambourg, and Lubeck an
Imperial Town, and the Ditmarse, in which is Meldorp.

North Jutland has the Towns of Scagen and Ripen.

Norway is a large Country reaching even to the Polar Circle: it is bordered by
Sueden on the East, and by the Ocean on all the other sides. It had heretofore
Kings of its own; its Capital City is Drandhain, but the most famous is
Berghen, a much frequented Sea Port.

Sconen lies to the South of Gothia; its Cities are Lunden an Archbishopric,
and Ellebogen or Malmoe.

The Capital City of the Isle of Zealand is Copenhagen, which is also the
Metropolis of all Denmark, and the usual Residence of their Kings, as Roskild
is the place of their Burial. Betwixt this Island and Sconen is the famous
Straight of the Sound, which is but a mile over; commanded by the Castle of
Crenemberg on the side of the Island near Elsenor, and on the opposite side in
Sconen, by that of Elsenbourg: here all Vessels are obliged to pay Toll to the
King of Denmark. Near to this Straight is the Isle of Ween or Huenna, whither
the illustrious Tycho-Brahe retired to make his Astronomical Observations.

Odensee is the chief Town of the Isle of Fuinen, between which and Zealand is
the other passage called the Belt.

The other Isles are Laland, Feneren, Faster, Muen, and many more.

The King of Denmark possesses also Iseland, and the Isles of Feroe, Situate
between it and the North of Scotland.

The Lutheran is the only Religion permitted within the States of the King of
Denmark.

The King of Sueden possesses Sueden, Gothia, Finland, Bothnia, Scricfinnia,
and part of Lapland, with the Isles of Gotland and Rugen.

The chief Towns of Suedland, are Stockholm the Metropolis of the State and
Residence of the Kings, built upon Piles like Venice, in the Lake Miler: Vpsale
an Archbishopric and University.

Gothia is to the Southward of Sueden, properly so called; its most
considerable Towns are Northcopen and Calmar.

Finland, whose Eastern part is likewise called Carelia, lies to the East of
Sueden, divided from it by the Gulf of Bothnia, and has the Finnick Gulf to
the South, and Russia to the East; its more remarkable Towns are Wibourg and
Rasenbourg.

Bothnia lies North from Finland, and its chief Town is Torn.

Lapland belongs partly to the Muscovite, and has no Cities, but pitiful
Villages: it is the Country of the Laplanders, a Barbarous people, some of
which are still Idolaters, and obey partly the King of Sueden, and partly the
great Duke of Muscovy.

Suedland embraced long ago the Lutheran Religion, which it professes at this
day.

In the extremities of the North, are Finmarchia or Scricfinnia, belonging
partly to the Crown of Suedland, and partly to that of Denmark.

It is to be observed, that Norway, Sueden, Sconen, Gothia, Finland, Lapland,
Bothnia, Scricfinnia, and Biarmia, lie in a Peninsula, called Scandia, or
Scandinavia, on the West and North sides encompassed by the Occan, on the South
by the Baltic, and on the East by the Gulf Botnia.

CHAP. XV. Great Russia, or Moscovy.
THAT Prince whom we call the Great Duke of Moscovy, is by his Subjects called
Czar, which is as much as to say, Emperor; and he may very well take that lofty
Title, seeing his State is one of the greatest in Europe, and reaches even to
Asia, and he is so absolute a master of the Lives and Fortunes of his people,
and his Empire Despotick; on the East it is bordered by Tartary the Great, on
the South by the Lesser, on the West by the States of Poland and Suedland, and
by the Ocean on the North: it comprehends Great Russia, which is divided into
many Provinces.

Mosco is the Capital City of the State, and gives its name to the whole
Empire, which it receives from a River that washes it; it is built of Wood, and
contains above forty thousand Houses: The other remarkable Cities are
Sandomiry, Molodimer, Novogord, and many more. Upon the White Sea, which is a
Bay or Gulf of the Northern Ocean, are St. Michael Archangel, and St. Nicholas
at the mouth of the Divina, which is one of the greatest Rivers in Russia: the
other Rivers are the Boristhenes, at present the Nieper, that falls into the
Black Sea, the Tanais, now called Don, which discharges it self into the Palus
Maosis, or Delle-Zabache. The Volga, heretofore Rha, which having its spring
head in that Country, after a long Course, carries its Streams into the Caspian
Sea.

The Moscovites follow the Religion of the Greek Church.

CHAP. XVI. The Lesser Tartary.
THE States of the Prince of Przecop, or of the lesser Tartars, lie betwixt the
mouths of the Boristhenes and Tanais; and in that Peninsule which the Ancients
called the Taurick Chersonesus, bounded on the East by the Palus Meotis, and on
the South and West by the Black Seas; on the Isthmus thereof stands the City of
Przecop, which has given the name of Przecopites to that People, and the City
of Caffa is its Capital: the Straight that joins the Palus Meotis to the Euxin
Sea, was heretofore called the Cimmerian Bosphorus, and is now termed the
Straight of Caffa or Vospero, and St. John's Mouth.

The Tartars Przecopites are by Religion Mahometans.

CHAP. XVII. The States of the King of Poland.
THESE States have the Territories of Moscovy on the East, on the North those
of Sueden and the Baltic Sea, on the West Germany, and on the South the
Carpathian Mountain which divides them from Hungary and Transylvania: they
comprehend Poland, Prussia, Lithuania, part of Livonia, Massovia, Podlassia,
Podolia, Volhinia and Russia-Nigra.

The Capital City of Poland is Cracovia, which is the Metropolis of the State;
the others are Guesn an Archbishopric, Sandomeria, and many more less
considerable.

Prussia Regalis belongs to the King of Poland, and its chief Towns are
Moriembourg and Dantzick, which has a famous Port on the Baltic at the Mouth
of the Weisel or Vistula.

Prussia the Ducall belongs to the Marquess of Brandebourg, who does homage for
it to the King of Poland: its Capital City is Koningsberg, or Regiomontum.

The Capital of Lithuania is Vilua.

In Livonia, or Liefland, are the Towns of Riga, Revel and Torpach; it belongs
almost wholly to the Suede, being yielded to that Crown by the Treaty of Oliva
in the Year 1660.

The Capital of Massovia is Warsaw, of Podlassia, Bijelsko: Caminiek and Bar
are in Podolia, and Vlodimer in Volhinia

Leopolis an Archbishopric is the Metropolis of Russia-Nigra.

Samogithia is also a Province of that State, but has neither Town nor Castle.

The Rivers of that Country are the Vistula or Weisel, that passes by
Cracocovia, Sandomeria and Dantzick.

The D'una passing by Riga into Lithuania.

The Boristhenes or Nieper bounds these States on the East, having its mouth in
the Vkraine, the Country of the Cosacques, who are under the Dominion of the
King of Poland, but none of the best Subjects.

The Catholic Religion is the strongest in these States, but the Calvinist and
Lutheran are professed there also.

CHAP. XVIII. The Isles of Europe.
THE Isles in the Ocean which beIong to Europe, are in the first place those
that are called British Isles: under which name are comprehended the Island of
Great Britain, Ireland, the Orcades, Hebrides, Anglesey, Man, and Isle of
Wight; and on the West of Normandy are those of Garnsey and Jernsey, ENGLAND,
SCOTLAND; and IRELAND; With the ISLES. Thereto Belonging.
map of Britain and Ireland ENGLAND
map of England and Wales SCOTLAND
map of Scotland IRELAND
map of Ireland (showing Eire (or the Republic of Ireland) and Northern
Ireland) all which are under the Dominion of the King of Great Britain, and
compose one of the greatest States in Europe.

The Island of Great Britain, which comprehends the Kingdoms of England and
Scotland, is one of the biggest Islands in the Ocean.

The Kingdom of England is divided from Scotland that lies to the North, by the
River of Tweed, and Cheviot Hills, and from France by a narrow Sea called the
Channel; the chief Cities thereof are London on the Thames the Metropolis, York
and Canterbury its two Archbishopricks: Oxford and Cambridg two famous
Universities, and several other great and populous Cities. The chief Rivers of
England are the Thames, the Humber, and the Severne.

This Kingdom is divided into fifty two Counties or Shires, reckoning the
Dominion of Wales which lies to the West thereof, from which the eldest Sons of
the Kings of England have their Titles of Princes of Wales.

Scotland a Kingdom to the North of England has Edinburgh for its Metropolis,
St. Andrews and Glasgow two Archbishopricks and Universities, and Aberdeen
another University, with many other Towns of less note: the Rivers of Scotland
are not very considerable except for Fishing.

The Orcades to the Northward of Scotland, are many in number, but only
thirteen of them are inhabited, and yet more Northerly are the Isles of
Shetland, belonging likewise to Scotland.

The Hebrides, or Hebudes, are to the West of Scotland, and are above three
hundred in number, the greatest of which are Arran, Sky and Mule.

The Isles of Anglesey and Man are to the West of England, and the Isle of
Wight to the South.

Ireland, heretofore Hibernia, lies to the West of England: it is a great
Island, and has many good Towns, Dublin is its Metropolis, and its University,
Armach, an Archbishopric, Cork, Limmerick and Waterford: its greatest River is
Shanon.

Iseland lies under the Polar Circle, which cuts it through the middle, so that
part of it lies on the Frigid Zone; there is a Mountain here that cast formerly
out flames of fire, though at present it ceases, called Aecla: they have some,
though but few, places of Habitation, the chief of which is Skalhot.

The Western Islands called the Azores or Tercera's, are betwixt America and
Europe, but nearer Europe, and therefore they ought to be ranked among the
European Islands: there are nine of them, Tercera, St. Michael, St. Mary, St.
George, Gratiosa, Pico, Fayal, Coruo and Flores.

Tercera that gives the name to all the rest is the greatest, and has a Town
called Augra; they belong to the King of Portugal, and produce plenty of Cedar.

We have spoken of those that are on the Coast of France, when we gave the
Description of that Country.

There are many Isles in the Mediterranean Sea; and we have taken notice
already of those that are on the Coasts of Spain, Italy and France: We must now
speak of Candia, and of the Isles upon the Coasts of Greece.

Candy, heretofore named Creet, which contained a hundred Towns, has not at
present above four or five which deserve that name; Candia is the Capital, and
has given that name to the Island, the others are Canea, Retimo and Sitia: it
belonged to the Venetians, but after above twenty years War, and that famous
Siege of Candia, it is at last fallen into the hands of the Turk: it was once
the Kingdom of Minos, and the Labyrinth that Dedalus made was here, and several
other things which have been the Theams to the ancient Poets.

Corfou, Zant, and Cephalonia, are in the Ionick Sea under the Dominion of the
Venetians, as also Cerigo, heretofore Cythera, which is to the South of
Peloponesus or Morea.

Nigropent, heretofore Euboea, is upon the Coast of Achaia; and on the Coast of
Romania is Samandrachi, which was called Samothracia, and to the South of this
Italimene, anciently Lemnos, where they dig Terra-Lemnia, or Sigillata.

In fine, the Egean Sea, called the Archipelago, and White Sea, is full of
scattered Islands which the ancients divided into the Cyclades and Sporades,
because those lie in a round, and these are dispersed upon and down,

The most famous have been Delos where Apollo and Diana were born; at present
it is called Sdrille Paros, now Paro, renowned for its White Marble: Zea Andro,
Niscia Sifano, and many others, besides those that are near Asia, which we
shall afterward discourse of.

We have already mentioned the Islands in the Baltic, which the King of
Denmark possesses, but there are some others also that belong to the King of
Sueden.

That of Oeland lies opposite to Calmar, a Town of Gothia; a little more to the
North-Eastward is that of Gotland, which heretofore had a famous Sea Port
called Wisbuy, which gave Laws to Commerce and Navigation. The stately Ruins
whereof show it to have been very Magnificent.

The Isles of Offel and Dagho are on the Coast of Livonia, and that of Rugen is
near to Pomerania; all which are under the Dominion of Sueden, but the Isle of
Bornholm is Subject to the Dane.

Before we leave Europe, it is to be observed, that it is almost wholly under
the Northern temperate Zone; it has some Regions indeed under the frozen Zone,
which are part of Norway, Finmarchia, and the greatest part of Lapland, and
some Lands of Moscovy, toward the Streights of Waigatz, the Streights of
Gibralter, and Cape Malapan in Morea, lie in the six and thirtieth Degree of
Latitude, and these are the most Southern parts of Europe: the North Cape lies
in seventy two almost, and is the most Northern place thereof.

A NEW GEOGRAPHY. The SECOND BOOK.
ASIA
map of Asia

CHAP. I. ASIA.
IN the First Book we have given a Description of GEOGRAPHY in general, and of
all EUROPE in particular: In the following Books we shall treat of the other
parts of the Earth; and in the first place of ASIA, as being contiguous to
EUROPE.

ASIA, whereof we described the Bounds in the beginning, was variously divided
by the Ancients; but at present, these famous Names are abolished, and it looks
with a new countenance: I think it ought to be divided according to the
Principal Empires that share it, which are under the Obedience of Five Great
Monarchs; to wit, the Grand Signior, the King of Persia, the Great Mogol, the
King of China, and the Great Cham of Tartary. To these must be added some Kings
of the East Indies, with what the Portuguese possess there, and the Isles, that
are numerous and very considerable.

CHAP. II. The Empire of the TURK in ASIA.
THE Emperor of the Turks, whom we call the Grand Signior, has his Imperial
Seat at Constantinople, which is in Europe; but the greatest part of his
Dominions is in Asia: to wit, Anatolia, Syria, Armenia, Mesopotamia, Arabia,
Chaldea, Mingrelia, Georgia, and Circassia.

Anatolia of the Moderns, is the Lesser Asia of the Ancients; it is on three
sides encompassed by Seas, on the North by the Black Sea, on the West by the
Propontis and Archipelago, on the South by the Mediterranean; and has the
River Euphrates on the East. It was heretofore divided into Two and twenty
Provinces, Pontus, Bithinia, Asia Propper, the greater and lesser Phrygia,
Troas, the greater and lesser Mysia, Eolia, Ionia, Caria, Doris, Lydia, Lycia,
Paphlagonia, Pisidia, Isaurta, Pamphilia, Cilicia, Lycaonia, Galatia and
Cappadocia; but at present their Names are lost, their Bounds confounded, their
Towns ruined, and their Inhabitants heretofore so polite, are become barbarous.
Nor do we certainly know how the Turks divide and name them at present; so that
we must rest satisfied to remark the Chief Towns that remain. Bursa is one of
the most considerable, and was the First Seat of the Turkish Empire; it is a
large and well-peopled City: the miserable Remains of Nice and Chalcedon,
famous by their General Councils, and the Ruins of Troy are to be seen there.
On the Archipelago are also Smyrna, Ephesus where the Temple of Diana was,
reckoned one of the Seven Wonders of the World, and where a General Council was
also held: Miletum, Halicarnassus which is in Caria, where Arthemisia erected
to her Husband Mausolus that Stately Monument which was also ranked among the
Wonders: and hence it is that Rich Tombs are called Mausolea. On the
Mediterranean is Satalie, which has given its Name to a Neighboring Bay; and
Tarsus, where St. Paul was born. On the Black Sea are Trabizonde, the Seat of
an Empire; and in the Country of the Amazons Sinobi, heretofore Sinope,
Angoure and Coni.

Syria has the Towns of Aleppo and Damascus, which are two of the greatest
Cities of the Turkish Empire. Said, anciently Tire, and Baruth, heretofore
Sydon, famous Towns; Antioch now ruined, Alexandretta or Scanderoon, its
principal Sea Port; and Tripoly of Syria.

Palestine, which was comprehended in Syria, was called Canaan and the Land of
Promise, Judea from a part of it; and the Holy Land, because of the Mysteries
that there were accomplished. It is bounded on the East by Mount Libanus and
Arabia Petraea, on the South by the same and Egypt; on the West by the Sea and
Phoenicia: it has been divided into four parts, Galilee on the North side,
Samaria, Judaea, and Idumea. In Galilee is Nazareth, where our Savior was
conceived, Cana where he changed the Water into TURQUIE in Asia

Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Jordan, Iraq, Kuwait, and eastern Iran) TURQUIE in

Arab Emirates, Oman and Yemen) Wine; Capernaum where he often soiourned, and
raised the Daughter of Jainus; Mount Tabor, where he was transfigured; the Sea
of Galilee, where he calmed the Tempest, and chose some of his Disciples; Naim
where he raised the Widows Son: all these Towns are now reduced to pitiful
Villages. In Samaria is the City of the same Name, which was the Seat of the
Kings of Israel; there remains no more of that City nor of Sichem, but
deplorable Ruins. In that Country also they do show the Well, at which our
Savior spoke to the Samaritan Woman: In Judaea is Jerusalem, where he suffered
death; its extremely fallen from the ancient splendour it had; nevertheless it
is environed with good Walls, and may reach Twelve or Thirteen hundred yards in
length, and as much in breadth. It is inhabited by Turks, Moors, and Arabians,
who are Mahumetans; by Greeks, Armenians, Syrians, and Cophties. There are no
Roman Catholics there but two Convents of Franciscans, the one of St. Savior,
and the other of St. Sepulcher; some Jews also live there. That so famous and
holy City has been often ruined, and as often repaired again. Mount Calvary
and the Holy Sepulcher were once without, but now within the City. It would
require a Volume to describe all the holy Places that are within and about it.

Two Leagues from Jerusalem is Bethlehem, where our Savior was born; it is at
present but a Village full of Ruins, inhabited by some poor Christians and
Arabians. Bethany where he raised Lazarus, is nearer to Jerusalem, and is but a
heap of Ruins; amongst which they still show the Tomb where the Body of Lazarus
lay when he was raised from the Dead, and the ruins of his house, of the houses
of his Sisters, Martha and Mary, and of Simon the Leper. Emaus, where the
Disciples knew their Divine Master, it is in no better condition; no more than
Jericho: upon the Plains whereof rises a Mountain, where our Savior fasted
Forty days. On the Seaside is Joppa, now called Jaffa, Acre heretofore
Ptolemais, and in Idumea is Gaza and some other Towns. Jordan waters that Holy
Land, runs through the Sea of Galilee, which is indeed but a Lake; and loses
its clear Streams in the stinking and black Waters of the Dead Sea: in this
River our Savior was baptized by St. John Baptist.

Arabia is divided into three, Deserta, Petrea, and Faelix, or the Desert,
Petrea or the stony, and the happy, the first two are to the North, and the
other to the South.

Arabia the Desert is the Country where the Children of Israel sojourned Forty
years, its Chief Places are Meschet, Orem, and Ana.

Arabia Petrea has Petrea (so called from the Name of the Country, but now
it is called Crach) and Eltor. In this Country is Mount Sina, upon which God
delivered the Law to Moses.

Arabia Foelix; or the Happy, so called because it is more fertile than the
other two, and bigger also; lies between the Red Sea which it has to the West,
the Gulf of Persia to the East, and the Indian Ocean to the South. Its chief
Towns are Medina, where the Sepulcher of Mahomet the Prophet of the Turks is:
Meccha the place of his Birth, Aden a place of great Traffic, Sanna, Mocha,
Soar, and many others. In this Country they gather Frankincence, and several
other precious Gums.

Chaldea is at the Confluence of Tygris and Euphrates, its Capital was Babylon
a famous City, and the Seat of the Babylonian Empire, the Walls whereof, built
by the Famed Queen Semiramis, were placed amongst the Seven Wonders, of the
World. It stood upon Euphrates, and little or nothing remains of it at present,
and less of the Tower of Babylon, that was near to it. Bagdat is at present
what Babylon was anciently, being built of its ruins; but upon the Tygris, as
the other was upon Euphrates.

The other Towns of Chaldea are Elmara, Gorna, Balsara, at the bottom of the
Gulf of Persia, Orchea which is thought to be the Ur of the Chaldees, from
whence God called Abraham; Magdon and some others.

Mesopotamia, now called Diarbeck, lies to the North of Chaldea, and to the
South of Armenia, between Euphrates and Tygris; its Chief Towns are Dava,
Merdin, Orpha, Bir, and Caramit.

Armenia is divided into the greater and lesser, the one on this side of
Euphrates, and the other beyond it; both the two are at present called
Turcomania. The Chief Towns of the lesser are Sivas or Sebaste, Kemach,
Erzinga, and Suar. Some place here Samosata, Lucian's Country; but it is in
Arminacha, which was called Comagene. Those of the greater, are Arzeron, Chars,
Essechire, which is taken for the Ancient Artaxata. In this Armenia is Mount
Ararat, where the Ark of Noah rested after the Flood. Some affirm that some
remains of it are still to be seen there.

Georgia is to the North of Armenia; its Towns are Cori, Scander, and Glisca;
that Country is the Iberia of the Ancients.

Zuria or Albania lies to the East of it, and reaches to the Caspian Sea. The
most remarkable places of it are Derbent, Zitracha, Sobai and Chipiche.

Mingrelia is nowadays the Colchis of old, whither Jason went for the Golden
Fleece; it has the Sea to the West, and Georgia to the East. Fazzo and
Sevastopoli are the more considerable Towns thereof.

Circassia and Comania, Countries of very little note, lie Northward from he
aforementioned Territories.

The Isles that the Turk possess about Asia, are famous in Antiquity.

Tenedos, at the back of which the Grecian Fleet skulked: Metelin, heretofore
Lesbos, where the renowned Sappho was born.

Chio or Scio, has a Town of the same Name; this Island produces Mastick and
the best Turpentine.

Nicaria, anciently Icaria, to which Icarus by his fall gave the Name.

Samos, where Pythagoras was born.

Pathmos, at present Palmosa, where St. John the Evangelist was banished in the
time of Domitian, and had those Divine Revelations whereof he composed the
Apocalypse.

Lango, heretofore Co or Cos, illustrious by the Birth of Hippocrates and
Apelles; the one gave men life by his Medicines, and the other by the Touches
of his Pencil.

PERSIA
map of Persia (showing modern-day Iran, Afghanistan, and western Pakistan)

Rhodes retains its Name, but not it its Ancient Splendor: Its called Rodo,
and has a Town of the same Name. In this place was anciently one of the Seven
Wonders of the World, I mean, that Famous Colossus of Brass, that was Erected
at the Entry of the Harbor, betwixt the legs of which Vessels passed. It was
thrown down by an Earthquake. This Island is Fifty Leagues in Circuit, and but
Six distant from Caria. The Turks took it from the Knights of Rhodes, who
afterward retreated to Malta. it has some other places as Lindo and Filerno.

Cyprus at present Cipro, is one of the greatest Islands of the Meditarranean,
being above Six score Leagues in Circumference. It was in Ancient times
Consecrated to Venus, and lies in the Sea of Pamphilia, which Country it has
to the North, Syria to the East, and Egypt to the South: It has been a
considerable Kingdom; which from the House of Lusignan fell into the Dominion
of the Republic of Venice; and is at present Subject to the Turk. The Chief
Towns of it are Nicosia and Famogosta, that has a good Port.

And thus you have a short Description of the Territories that the Grand
Signior, Emperor of the Turks, possesses in Asia: In all which the Mahumetan
Religion is publicly Established; but the Jewish and Christian Religion are
both permitted; and this last is divided into many Sects, as Greeks, Armenians,
Jacobites, Georgians, Maronites, Cophtites and many others. The Roman
Catholics are not so numerous there, as the others are.

There are many Governors in the Turkish Empire called Beglerbeys, who have
under them Sangtacs, that are as their Deputies or Lieutenants.

CHAP. III. The Kingdom of PERSIA.
THE Empire of the Persians, heretofore so Vast and Famous, has been subject to
many Alterations. It was founded by Cyrus, and overthrown by Alexander. The
Parthians drove his Successors from thence, and maintained long Wars with the
Romans; it was again restored under the Name of the Persian, and ruined by the
Califes the Successors of Mahomet: Invaded by the Tartars under the powerful
Tamerlan, and at length Raised again by Ismael Sophy, to the State wherein now
it is. It is called the Empire of the Sophy of Persia; and is bounded on the
West by the Turkish Empire, on the East by that of the great Mogol, on the
North by the Tartars, from whom it is divided by the River Oxus, now Abiamus;
and on the South by the Gulf of Persia, and the Indian Sea: In a word it
Reaches from Tygris to Indus, and from the Caspian to the Persian Sea,
containing several Provinces, Persia, Sustana: Parthia, Media, Affyria,
Hircania, Paropamisa, Margiana, Carmania and Gedrosia, all which have lost both
their Names and Limits. The Metropolis of these States is Hispahan or Isfaham,
a great and fair City containing many stately Palaces, where the Sophy keeps
his Court and usually resides: It lies in Parthia now a days called Hierak: The
other Towns of that Province are Cassan, Argistan, Jex, Saba, and Targazin.

In the Province of Persia now called Farsy, is the Town of Siras, which is
taken for the Ancient Persepolis, burnt by Alexander.

Susiana, which is called Cusistan, has for its Chief City Sus formerly Susa,
the Imperial Seat of Ahassuerus.

Media now a days Servan, has the City of Tauris, which is the Ecbatana of the
Ancients.

Assyria, whereof the Turk possesses part, has Mosul for its Capital, which is
the Ancient Ninive the Metropolis of the Assyrians.

Hircania is called Diargument; its principal Towns are, Mazandaron and Strava.

Paropamisal at present Sablestan, has Candahar for its chief Town, which
gives also a name to all the Province.

Margiana or Elsabar, has Mexed for its principle Town, where the Kings of
Persia are Interred.

Carmania has Chirman, from which it takes its modern name, Gedrosia or Circan
has the Town of Calamate.

The most Remarkable Isles of Persia are in the Gulf of that Name; that of
Ormus is near the Sreights, and has a Town of the same name Ruined at present.

The Isle of Baharem is famous, by reason that about it they fish for, and take
the lovliest Oriental Pearls.

The Sophy of Persia is Mahumetan; but follows the Doctrine of Aly, Mahcmets
Son in Law, whom the Turks reckon a Heretic. The Persians are of their Prince
his Sect, and civilized and polished, and much of the humor of the French. The
Christian Religion is suffered there, and in Hispahan it self there are
Convents of several Orders, as barefooted Carmelites, Capuchins, Minims, and
many others.

CHAP. IV. The Empire of the great MOGOL.

PORTUGAL.
map of Portugal

THE Ancients divided the East Indies, into India on this side, and India on
the other side of Ganges. In the first, called now Indostan which lies between
that and another River named Indus, is the Empire of the great Mogol. It has
to the North Turquestan, to the West the States of Persia, to the South the
Territories of several Princes which we shall hereafter mention; and to the
East the Kingdom of Bengala: It is divided into several Kingdoms, which carry
generally the Names of their Capital Cities, as Agra, Lahor, Delli, Kabul,
Caximir; but the Kingdom of Sinda has Tatah for Metropolis. The usual place of
Residence of that Monarch is Lahor, his Palace is Magnificent, and he is the
Richest Prince in the World in precious Stones. He is Mahumetan, and most of
his Subjects follow the same Religion; but there are many Christians and
Idolaters amongst them, and a Sect of Pythagoreans, who hold it a deadly Sin to
eat any thing that ever had life; who are there called Bannians.

CHAP. V. The other States of the EAST INDIES, and what the PORTUGUESE and
other Nations Possess there.
BEfore we proceed further, we must take a view of the other Kingdoms of the
East Indies, and of what the King of Portugal Possesses there, that we may not
be obliged to come back to the same parts again. These Indies have two
Peninsules, which are divided by the Bay of Bengala. That which is on the West
side, contains the Kingdoms of Decan, Onar, Barcelor, Canara and some others,
with the Coast of Malabar, in which are the Kingdoms of Calicut, Cochin, Coulan
and others, all bearing the Names of their Capital Towns: They are Situated on
the Western part of this Peninsule. Toward the Eastern, is the Coast of
Coromandel, where are Negapatan, Maliapor or St. Thomas, and the Kingdom of
Bisnagar, Narsingue, Golconde and Orixa, which bear the Names of their chief
Cities. The two Coasts of this Peninsule are divided by Mount Gate which ends
at Cape Comorin. The Country situated on this Mountain is called Balagate.

At the Entry of the other Peninsule, which is to the East, we meet with the
Kingdoms and Cities of Pegu, Siam, Camboia and Tunquin; and in the Penninsule
is the Kingdom of Malacca, with its City of the same Name, which is the
Southermost Extremity thereof.

In the Entry of the other Peninsule, which is to the West, is the Kingdom of
Cambaya, with a City of the same Name, and another called Surrat, which is very
large, and a place of great Trade, and the Residence of our English President
of India.

Thu Kingdam of Bengala is near the mouth of Ganges, between the States of the
Mogol and Pegu.

The King of Portugal possesses the Isle of Diu, near the Kingdom of Cambaya,
which has a Town of the same Name near the Kingdom of Decan, the City of Goa,
one of the greatest Towns of the Indies, and the Residence of the Archbishop
and Viceroy; some places on the Coast of Malabar, and on the other side he had
heretofore Maliapur a considerable Town, where it is believed the Body of St.
Thomas is. In the other Peninsule formerly he held Malacca, which the Dutch
have since taken from him. Besides these, he has several Islands, and some
places in others which belong not wholly to himself.

CHAP. VI. The Kingdom of CHINA.
SOme Authors make this Kingdom as big as all Europe, so vast is its Extent. It
has the Ocean to the East, Cochinchina to the South, and to the West the
Indies and part of Tartary, which it has likewise in the North, and from which
it is separated by that Famous Wall of Four hundred Leagues in Length. It is
divided into Fifteen Provinces, the Names of which it is not very material to
know: There are above Two thousand Cities reckoned to be in this great Kingdom,
and of them Peking is the Chief and the Imperial Seat of their Kings. That
Throne was overturned by the Tartars, who ruined this Empire, and possessed the
greatest part thereof; but the Natives have lately recovered their Liberty
again and expulsed the Conquerers. Nanquin, Xanton and Amus, are the most
considerable CHINA.

map of Tartary (showing modern-day Russia, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Uzbekistan,
Turkmenistan, and northern China) Cities, and the least is as big if not bigger
than London. There are in this Kingdom many Fair Navigable Rivers, the chief of
which are the Yellow and the Blew, called in the Chinese Language, Caramoran
and Jansuguiam, and Chincheo that passes by the Stately City of Amus. The
Chinese are Idolaters, and Worship the Heavens and Stars, with many Idols that
they place in their Temples.

The Jesuits have Converted many of them to Christianity, and are very Active
in making Proselytes in those Parts.

CHAP. VII. TARTARY.
THE greater Tartary is one of the vastest Regions of the whole Earth. It has
to the West the States of Muscovy, the Ocean to the North, to the East the
Streights of Anian, or Jesso, according to some Maps, and to the South Persia,
India, and China. Several Princes have Dominions in that great space of Land,
and among others the Prince of Niuche on the East Side, who Invaded and
Conquered China: But the most considerable of all is the Great Cham. One of his
chief Provinces in Cathay, which some take for China, and its City of Cambalu
for that of Pequin, so uncertain Men are in the knowledge of those distant
Countries. It is nevertheless sure that there are Vagabond Tartars, divided
into Societies called Hordes: They Inhabit that place which is called Tartary
Desert, near which is the Kingdom of Astracan, with a Town on the same Name on
the Volga. In these Countries, as it is reported, grows the Boranetz, which is a
Plant Animal, that is, half a Plant and half an Animal: It is in Shape like a
Lamb, and fastened to a stalk, about which it Nibbles and Eats the Grass, which
once failing, it withers and dies. The other parts of Tartary are, Turquestan
and Zagathy, the chief City whereof is Samarkand, the Imperial Seat of the
Victorious Tamerlan. Most part of the Tartars are Mahumetans, there are many
Idolaters, some Jews, and very few Christians among them.

CHAP. VIII. The Isles of ASIA in the Ocean.
IN treating of the Tetritories of the Turk, we spoke of the Isles of Asia that
are in the Mediterranean: We must now mention those in the Ocean which belong
to that part of the World; but seeing they are so numerous, that a large Volume
would be too little to describe them all in, we shall only touch at those which
are the most considerable and of greatest Note amongst them.

The Maldives lie toward the Cape of Comorin, to the South and West thereof;
there are many of them, and they reach to the Line, being divided into certain
Parcels, which are called Attollons, and contain many small Islands, separated
by verry narrow Channels; they are full of Cocotrees; the Inhabitants are
Mahumetans, and subject to a King.

Zeilan or Zeilon, is near Cape Comorin, being Two hundred and forty Leagues in
Circumference: The Indians call it Tenasirim, that is, a Paradise of Delights;
there grows the Tree whereof Cinnamon is but the Bark, and that in such plenty,
that there are whole Forests of them: Fair Emeralds and fairer Elephants are
likewise to be had there. Some would have it to be the Taprobane of the
Ancients, which others think to be Sumatra. One of its chief Towns is Sitavaca,
the Residence of a Prince who takes the Title of Emperor of Zeilan, to whom the
other Kings are Tributary. It is divided into several Kingdoms, of which Candy,
that is in the middle of the rest, is one of the chief. The Portuguese had
formerly some places there, of which Columbo was the most Important: But at
present the Hollanders are possessed of that and much more than ever the
Portuguese had. The Natives are either Mahumetans or Idolaters.

Sumatra is divided by the Streights of Sincapura, from the Peninsula of
Malaccra. Most part of the Modern Geographers take it for Taprobane; the
Equinoctial cuts it almost in the middle, it is very large, and some assign to
it Thirty Kingdoms. Its chief Towns are, Achein, Pedar, and Batham: The
Inhabitants profess Mahumetanism, and many of them are still Idolaters.

Great Java is near to Sumatra, and is separated from it but by an Arm of the
Sea, called the Streights of Sonda. This Island is about Two Hundred Leagues in
Length, but not above Forty in Breadth: It is Subject to several Princes, who
are Tributaries to another, by them called Mataram, that is to say, Emperor.
It has considerable Towns, such as Bantam, Palambuam, Japara and Batavia,
called so by the Hollanders, being formerly called Jacatra: They took it in the
Year One thousand six hundred and seventeen, and have strongly fortified it,
and made it the Residence of their General, and Principal Seat of their great
East India Trade. The Inhabitans of the Island are for the most part Mahumetans.

Little Java is now called Cumbava, and but little known, some of its
Inhabitans are Idolators.

Borneo lies to East of Malacca and Sumatra, and to the North of Java: This is
one of the greatest Islands in the Ocean; it is almost round, and has above
200 Leagues in Diameter. Its Principle Town carries its Name. Most part of the
Inhabitans profess Mahumetanisme, and the rest are plunged in Idolatry.

Celebes is to the East of Borneo, and is much less than it, the chief Towns
thereof are one that goes by the same Name and Durate.

Gilolo is to the East of the former, and is not so great; it has a Town of
its own Name, and another called Tolo.

The Molucca's, so Famous for the Cloves, Nutmegs, and Mace, which they
disperse through the whole World, lie under the Equinoctial, betwixt Celebes
and Gilolo. The chief are Ternate, Tidor, Motir, Machian and Bachian. The
Portuguese have had some places there, which have been disputed by the English
and Dutch, and finally carried by the latter, who have Engrossed the Trade of
those Rich Spices.

Banda is to the South of Gilolo, and furnishes also Nutmegs. The Hollanders
have the Possession thereof.

The Philippine Islands, called so by the Spaniards, in Honor of their King
Philip the Second, are so many in number, that some Authors reckon above Ten
thousand of them. They lie Northward from the Mollucca's, and Eastward from
Cochinchina. The greatest and most considerable of them is Luconia, where the
Town of Manilha is. The other that are remarkable are those of Mindanao, which
has a Town of its Name, the Isles of St. Juan, of Cebu, Matan and Tandayo:
Betwixt this last and the Isle of Lucon, is the Streights of Manilha, Famous
amongst Navigators.

Amacao or Macao, is a small Island on the Coast of China, where the Portguese
have a Town of the same Name.

The Isle Formosa, the Lucaios, and some others, are to the East of China.

The Empire of Jappan, is composed of several great Islands, on the the East of
China, the chief of which is called Niphon, and its Capital Town Meaco; though
this present Emperor has his Court at Jedo in the East part of the Island.
Many Jesuits have here lost their lives for Preaching Christ to that
Idolatrous People. To the North of this Country the Land of Jesso has been
lately discovered, divided from it by the Streights of Sangar.

The chief Mountains of Asia, are Taurus, Libanus, Caucasus, and Imaus. Its
chief Capes, are that of Comorin in the Indies, Liampo in China, Fartach,
Razalgate and Monzandaon in Arabia the happy, and the Promontory of Tabin in
Tartary. Its principal Rivers, are the Volga, Araxez, Oxus now Abiamus, and
Jaxartes or Chesel, which run into the Caspian, Sea.

Euphrates and Tigris come from the Mountains of Armenia, embrace Mesopotamia,
and uniting in Chaldea, fall into the Gulf of Persia. Indus comes from
Caucasus, gives its name to India, which it waters, and afterward runs into
the Ocean, as Ganges does into the Bay of Bengall.

The Cosmin passes by Pegu, and the Menan by Siam, they both proceed from the
Lake of Chiamay, and fall into the Ocean.

The Yellow and Blew Rivers are in China.

The Tartar, that is thought to have given Name to Tartary, runs into the
Northern Ocean, and the Oby also.

It is to be observed, that the greatest part of Asia is in the Temperate Zone:
It has some Regions in the Torrid, to wit, part of Arabia the happy, and of
the Indies; with many Isles. Some Countries of Tartary are in the Frozen Zone.
To conclude, Asia reaches from the Equinoctial to the Seventieth degree of North
Latitude; and some of its Isles are Ten degrees beyond the Line.

CHAP. IX. AFRICA.
THere is no need of crossing the Sea to go from Asia to Africa, since we have
a passage by Land, which is the Isthmus of Suez, betwixt the Red Sea and the
Mediterranean. Having passed that, we find at first sight Egypt, and proceeding
from East to West, we shall in order find Barca, Barbary, and the Kingdoms of
Fez and Morocco, that are washed with the Ocean. Afterward from North to South,
we will meet with Biledulgerid, Zahara, the Country of Negres, Guinea, the
Kingdom of Congo, the Country of Caffres, as far as the Cape of good Hope.
Afterward going toward the North, we shall find Zanguebar, and some other
Countries; and then having visited those Regions that are in the heart of
Africa, as Nubia, Ethiopia, and Monomotapa, we shall end with its Mountains,
Capes and Isles.

CHAP. X. EGYPT and the Region of BARCA.
AFRICA
map of Africa

WE shall view the Countries of Africa, that lie upon the Ocean, after that we
have seen those that are upon the Mediteranean. Egypt, so famous both in Sacred
and Profane History; which speak so often of its Pharaoh's and Ptolomies, has
on the East the Isthmus of Suez, and the Red Sea; on the North the
Mediterranean, on the West the Country of Barca, and on the South Nubia and
Ethiopia. It has not so many Towns at present, as it had heretofore. The
Metropolis of it is Caire, a very great City on the right Bank of the River of
Nile. On the other side of that River are to be seen those famous Pyramids,
which were the Monuments of some Kings, and have been reckoned amongst the
Seven Wonders of the World; and as in all probability they were the most
ancientest of the Seven, so it is certain they are the only one remaining. Nile
having washed Caire, divides it self into two Branches, which embrace the
Country called Delta, from the Greek Letter D, which it resembles; these two
Branches produce others, which made several Mouths to that River, some of which
are stopped up. The other Towns are Asna, anciently Siene, toward the South
Alexandria, heretofore the Capital City under the Ptolomies, preserves still in
its stately Ruins, the Name of Alexander the Great, who founded it: It lies
upon the Sea, and near the place where the Phare stood, which was one of the
Seven Wonders. Rosetta and Damieta, are also upon the Sea, at two other Mouths
of the Nile. All this fair Country is made wonderfully fruitful, by the
overflowing of the Nile, and is subject to the Turk: the Inhabitants are
Mahumetans, but there are many Jews and some Christians among them.

The Region of Barca was anciently called Cyrenaica, and has Egypt on the
East, the Sea on the North; on the West Barbary, and the Deserts that carry its
name, with Lybia on the South; its chief Town is likewise called Barca; the
others are Alberton, Patriarcha, Bonandrea, Berniche, and some more. The People
are Mahumetans, Subjects to the Turk.

CHAP. XI. BARBARY, with the Kingdoms of FEZ and MOROCCO.
BArbary has to the East the Country of Barca, to the North the
Mediterranean, to the West the Kingdoms of Fez and Morocco, and to the South
Mount Atlas, which divides it from Biledulgerid. Going from East to West we
find the Kingdoms of Tripoly, Tunnis, Algire, and Tremesin or Telensin, with
their chief Towns of the same Name. Near to Tunnis are to be seen some Ruins of
the famous Carthage. In the Kingdom of Algier is Bugie and Gigery; and some
other places that may be seen in the Map, but very little known to us. The
People of that Country are Mahumetans, and subject to the Turk, and have for
many Ages practiced Pyracy upon the Mediterranean, to the great Annoyance of
the Christians Commerce.

The Kingdom of Fez has to the South Morocco, to the East the Kingdom of
Tremisen, to the North the Streights of Gibraltar, and to the West the
Atlantic Ocean; its chief Cities carries the same Name, and is a beautiful and
stately Place; the Principal Mosque of it is above a quarter of a mile in
circuit, and therein burn constantly Nine hundred Lamps. The other Towns are
Mahamore, Larache, Alcazer, and Tetuan; (the two former belong to the King of
Spain) and Tangier belonging to the King of Great Britain.

The Kingdom of Morocco lies to the South of that of Fez; its chief City bears
the same Name, and is beautiful and large, though it has lost much of its
ancient Splendor. On the the Top of one of its Towers, are three Golden Balls,
which are believed to be Enchanted. Next to Morocco, the Town of Agmet is the
most considerable: These two Kingdoms belong to one Prince, who is called
Emperor of Morocco; he is Mahumetan, and his Subjects are of the same Religion;
but there are many Jews and Christians among them.

of America, Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Panama)
GUIANA
map of Guyana (showing modern-day eastern Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, French
Guiana, and northern Brazil

BILEDULGERID signifies a Country of Dates, because it abounds with
Palm Trees, which bear that Fruit. The Ancients called that Region Numidia; it
reaches from the Atlantic Ocean to Egypt, the space of a Thousand Leagues:
Mount Atlas divides it from Barbary on the North, and Zara bounds it on the
South. Its best Province is Suz on the Atlantic Ocean; the rest, which are
Tesset, Dara, Segelmesse, Zeb; and some others, most of which take their Names
from their Towns, are but little inhabited, by reason of the great
inconveniences of want of Water, noxious Animals, and the barrenness of the
Soil. Zahara, or the Desert, is the Ancient Lybia, and reaches from the Ocean
to Egypt, and has Biledulgerid to the North, and the Country of Negres to the
South. There is hardly any thing there but Deserts and heaps of Sand, which
being driven by the Wind, many times bury Travelers alive, and being heated by
the direct Beams of the Sun, render the Air insupportably hot. However there
are some places inhabited, as Zanhaga, Zuenziga, Terga, Agadez, Berdoa; and
some others, so little known to us, that we can say nothing with any certainty
of them. These People, as well as those of Biledulgerid, are Mahumetans, and
some of them Idolaters.

CHAP. XIII. The Country of Negres and Guinea.
THat Country which is called the Country of Negres or Nigritia, has on the
West the Atlantic Ocean, on the North the Deserts of Lybia, on the East Egypt,
Nubia, and the Empire of the Abysins; and on the South Guinea and the Kingdom
of Congo: It is about a Thousand Leagues in length, and of a very considerable
breadth. The River Niger waters it, and overflowing like the Nile, renders it
fruitful: It is divided into several Branches, whereof the two chief are
Senega, Gambao, or Riogrande, which fall into the Ocean near Cape de Verd. That
great Country is divided into several Kingdoms, of which the most remarkable
are Genehoa, Tombut, Senega, Gago, Gualata, Melli, Cano, Agadez; and betwixt
the Branches of the Niger, the Kingdom of the Jaloffes and Gambea. They have
generally either given or taken their Names from their chief Towns. The People
are of different Religions; a great many of them are Idolaters, and some few
are Mahumetans; they are subject also to different Princes.

Guinea has to the East and North the Country of Negres, in which some
Geographers also place it, toward the West and South the Ethiopick Ocean. It
contains the Kingdoms of Sierra Leona, Sabon and Benin. It has no Towns of any
note. The Coast there is called by several Names, as the Grain Coast, the
Quaqua Coast, and the Gold Coast, upon which the English, Dutch, and some other
Nations, have their Forts and Factories. The Natives drive a great Trade with
the Europeans, who transport yearly into the West Indies, several thousands of
these wretched Animals, sold to them by their inhumane Lords, and sometimes by
their own Parents, into perpetual Slavery. This Country abounds in Gold; the
Natives for the most part are Idolaters, and some of them worship their Kings.

CHAP. XIV. The Kingdoms of Congo, Cacongo, Angola, Malemba, and Mataman.
THese Kingdoms are by some Geographers placed in Ethiopia; but we distinguish
them, because under that name the Country of the Abyssins is chiefly
understood.

The Kingdom of Congo has to the East the Empire of Prester John, to the North
the Country of Negres, to the West the Ocean of Ethiopia, and to the South the
Kingdom of Angola. It is divided into several Provinces, and its chief Town is
called St. Salvador. Next to that the most remarkable are Panho, Batta, Sanho,
Sunde, Pemba, which take or give their Names to their Provinces. The River
Zaire, that comes from a Lake of the same Name, runs through this Kingdom, with
a Stream famous for its swiftness and breadth. That of Coanza makes the Isle of
Loanda at its Mouth; there is another River likewise called Lelunde. In the
Northern part of this Country, there are People called Anzicains, who are
reported to eat Man's Flesh, which is sold in the Shambles, as Beef and Mutton
with us.

When the Portuguese discovered the Kingdom of Congo, the Inhabirants of it
were Idolaters, and worshipped the Sun, believing that the Souls of COAST OF

time many there have Embraced the Christian Religion.

The Kingdom of Caconga is to the Eastward of the former; and there is no Town
observed in it.

That of Angola is to the South of Congo; its chief Town is Dongo: Here are the
Mountains of Cambambe (Rich in Silver Mines) and Cape St. Mary.

The Kingdom of Malemba is to the East of Angola, and near the Lake Zambre;
that of Mataman is to the South of it. The People of these Kingdoms are
Idolaters, but the Jesuits daily endeavor their Conversion.

CHAP. XV. Caffreria, Sofala, Zanguebar, and some other Countries.
THE Country of the Caffres or Hottentots, named Caffreria, has to the East
and North Monomotapa, to the West and South the Ocean, and reaches to the Cape
of Good Hope. Along the Coasts of it are good Ports. No Towns are to be seen
here; the People are altogether barbarous, having neither Laws, Kings, or
Religion. Near the Cape of Good Hope the Hollanders have planted a very Noble
Colony, which supplies in great abundance all Necessaries to their Ships as
they go and come from the East Indies.

The Kingdom of Sofala is upon the Indian Ocean, its chief Town bears its Name,
and is built in an Island made by the River of Cuama. Some Authors take this
Country for the Land of Ophir, whither Solomon sent to fetch Gold for Adorning
of that stately Temple which he Built.

Zanguebar is to the North of it, and extends it self upon the Indian Ocean,
which it has to the East, as far as the Kingdom of Adea, which it has on the
North side, and the Empire of the Abyssins to the West. It comprehends Six
Kingdoms, to wit, Mongalo, Mozambique, Angothe, Quiloa, Mombaza, and Melinde;
each of them having a Capital Town bearing its Name. The Inhabitants are
Idolaters or Mahumetans, with some few Christians. The Portuguese possess
Mozambique and Mombaza with some other places.

Continuing still Northward and along the Indian Sea, we find the Republic of
Brave, consisting only in one Maritime Town of the same Name, which was pretty
Rich, before it was sacked by the Portuguese.

Next we find the Kingdoms of Magadoxo and Adel, with their Capitals of the
same Name. the latter reaches to the Cape Guardafuy and the Streights of Babel
mandel which Joins the Ocean to the Red Sea.

The Kingdom of Abex is upon that Sea and under the Ottoman Empire. Its chief
Towns are Arguico, Doncale and Suguam, all three Maritime.

If there be any other little States, they are so inconsiderable, that it is
not worth our while to stop and view them, just when we are about to consider
larger and more Famous Territories in the middle of Africa, whereof we have now
Surveyed the Confines.

CHAP. XVI. NUBIA.
NUBIA has the Nile on the East; which divides it from Ethiophia, that is
likewise to the South of it. The Country of Negro's on the West, and Egypt on
the North. Its Metropolis of the same Name is upon the Nile, and the others
deserve not the Name of Towns, being but pitiful Villages. The Inhabitants have
been Christians, and according to some Authors are so still; but without any
Exercise of Religio: of which they retain nothing but the shadow and confused
Knowledge.

CHAP. XVII. Ethiopia or the Empire of the Abyssins.
SOme Geographers divide Ethiopia into the Upper and Lower, and under this
comprehend the Kingdoms of Congo, Angola, and some others, whereof we have
treated; and those of Monomotapa and Monoemugi, of which we shall speak: And
under the other they place the Empire of the Abyssins; but because this retains
particularly the Name of Ethiophia; we shall use the same without perplexing
our selves about that Division.

Ethiopia has to the North Nubia and Egypt, to the East, the Kingdom of Abex
and Zanguebar, to the South Monoemugi; and to the West the Kingdom of Congo,
and the Country of Negro's. That vast Tract of Land which makes the Empire of
the Abyssins, is all in the Torrid Zone, and reaches almost from the one
Tropic to the other. Its length from North to South, is Six hundred Leagues.
The Nile crosses it, and forms therein a Famous Island, which the Ancients
Named Meroe, and the Moderns Gueguerre.

This great State is divided into a great many Kingdoms or Provinces, which
bear that Name. The next to Egypt is the Kingdom of Cansila, then streatching
Southward, these following are to be seen, Barnagasso, Tigremahon, Bagamidri,
Amara, Roxa, Narea, Zet, and several others which I mention not, as judging it
useless to fill this Description with barbarous Names that are good for
nothing: The Towns here are mean and inconsiderable, having neither beauty nor
extent, with pitiful Houses built of mud or clay and straw, because there is
but very little wood or lime in the Country. Nor has the King of Ethiopia
fixed upon any Town for his usual Residence, but goes from Province to
Province; having all his Court lodging in Tents, of which he has always Five
or Six thousand carried about with him in his Retinue. This is an odd way of
living, and yet he is one of the greatest Princes in the World; he has vast
and large Dominions, great Treasures, rich Furniture, and can send numerous and
strong Armies into the Field. He is abusively called Prester John, his Subjects
call him Adubvegue; which signifies Emperor, and some Moderns, Negus, as much
as to say Monarch. That Powerful Prince and all his Subjects profess
Christianity, but with some mixture of Jewish Ceremonies; for they retain both
Circumcision and Baptism. Their Priests Marry, but yet they have Monks. They
have a Patriarch who is the Head of their Church, whom they call the Abuna; and
their Country is full of Monasteries.

CHAP. XVIII. The Kingdoms of Monoemugi and Monomotapa.
THE Kingdom of Monoemugy has to the North the Empire of the Abyssins, to the
East Zanguebar and Sofala, to the South Monomotapa, and to the West Congo.
Sofala, whereof we have spoken, depends on it, and belongs to the same Prince:
His other Countries are inconsiderable, and the Towns that are more so, are
Beif, Agag, Camar. To the Northward of this State rise above the Clouds the
high Mountains of the Moon. The Inhabitants are almost void of all Religion.

The Kingdom of Monomotapa, has the last Kingdom we spoke of to the North, and
on all other sides the Country of the Caffres. The chief City of it and Seat
of the Prince is of the same Name; its other Towns are Mogar, Mosata and Gale.
Under it are comprehended the Kingdoms of Toroa, Inhambane, and Inhamior. Its
Inhabitants are Idolaters, whom the Jesuits labor to convert to Christianity.

This Rigion is watered with the Rivers of Cuama and Spiritu Sancto.

These are the more known Regions of Africa, which yet are so little, so that
what we can say of them deserves not the Name of a Description. The chief
Mountains are, Atlas, Sierra-Liona, Mount Amara, and the Mountains of the Moon.

The chief Capes thereof are, Cape Verd, the Cape of Good Hope, and Guarda-fuy.

Its Rivers are the Nile that runs into the Meditarranean, after it has
watered Ethiopia and Egypt. The Niger that runs through the Country of Negres,
and falls into the Atlantic Ocean near the Cape Verd, where it makes many
Branches. The Zambre, that proceeds from a Lake of the same Name, runs through
the Lake of Zachaf, and dividing it self into two Branches, one whereof is
called Cuama, and the other de Spiritu Sancto, both whereof are discharged into
the Indian Sea; and the River Zaire, which falls with great Impetuosity into
the Ethiopian Sea.

CAHP. XIX. The Isles of AFRICA.
IN the Miditerranean are first the Isle of Malta, the Melita of the Ancients,
Famous for the Shipwreck of the Apostle St. Paul, and the Residence of the
great Master of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem, which bears its Name: It is
Seven Leagues Long, and Four Broad. Its Towns are the Valette, the City, the
Bourg, and St. Michael, with the Castle St. Elm. The Isles of Comin and
Comminet, Forfora, Goze, Lampadosa and Limosa belong likewise to the order of
Malta.

The Isle of Pantalarea belongs to the Portuguese, and that of Zerbi to the
Turks.

In the Atlantic Ocean are the Canaries that belong to the Spaniards, Porto
Santo, Madera, and the Cape De Verd Islands, which belong to the Crown of
Portugal.

Porto Santo is near to Madera, and in respect of it inconsiderable, for Madera
is large and fruitful, producing good Wines, and that Sugar which goes by its
Name. The chief City of it is Funchall, and has a Bishop Suffragant to the
Archbishop of Lisbonne. The People are Civil and Roman Catholics.

The Canaries, which the Ancients called the Fortunate Islands, because of the
goodness of the Air and Soil, are to the West of the Kingdom of Morocco: they
reckon Seven of them, that are the chief; to wit the Grand Canaries, the Isle
of Ferro, the Isles of Taneriffe, Lacerotte, Palma, Gomera, and Fortventura.
The great Canary which has given its Name to all the rest, and got it from the
abundance of Dogs that were found there, has a Town of the same Name which is
a Bishopric.

The Island of Ferro is considerable, for that we have from thence taken our
beginning of Longitude, it being the most Westerly of these Islands. There is
here a Tree which so condenses the Air, that it furnishes the Inhabitants with
Water, which is otherwise scarce enough with them.

Taneriffe is remarkable for a great Mountain, which is thought to be the
highest in the World; called by the Spaniards Pico: from thence we have the
best Canary Wine.

The rest are but inconsiderable.

The Cape De Verd Islands, so called, because they are opposite to that Cape,
were known to the Ancients by the Name of Hesperides, Gorgoniae, and Gorgades:
The chief of them are Eight, to wit, St. Anthony, St. Vincent, St. Luce, St.
Nicholas, St. Jago, del Sal, Mayo and Fuego. That of St. Jago or St. James, is
the most considerable. It has a City of the the same Name; the Bishop whereof
is Suffragant to the Arch Bishop of Lisbon: Its other Towns are, Ribera a great
place and much frequented, St. Thomas, St. Michael, and La Praya which is its
best Port. The Air of this Island is extremely bad.

In the Ethiopick Ocean and near Sierra-Liona, are the little Isles of Farellon
and Massacoya.

Somewhat farther in the bottom of the Bay or Bight of Guinea, is that of St.
Thomas, discovered on that Saints day whose Name it bears. It is directly under
the Equinoctial: Its chief Town is Pavoasan, Inhabited by the Portuguese.

The Princes Island is near to the former, and was so called because the
Revenue thereof was appointed for the use of the Eldest Son of the King of
Portugal.

The Isle of Farnandopo is to the North of that, and near the Coast of Guinea
and the Kingdom of Benin.

Beyond the Line we find the Isle of Annobon, which last the Portuguese called
so, because they discovered it on New Years day.

The Isle of Ascension, discovered on Ascension day, and therefore so called,
is farther to the South in the Ethiopick Sea, and is neither inhabited nor
habitable for want of Water, but it is abounding in Turtle or Sea Tortoise. St.
Helena, for a like reason so named, is of all the Islands in the World the most
Remote from the Continent, being about Four hundred Leagues distant from it. It
has excellent Fresh Water, and so Salubrious an Air, that the Sick who land
there, recover their Health quickly. It belongs to the English, and all the
Ships that come from the East Indies and belong to England, do commonly put in
and take Fresh Water there.

In the same Ocean, and toward the Cape of Good-Hope, are the small Islands of
Elizabeth, Cornelia and Fera.

Beyond that Famous Cape, and to the East of Africa, in the Indian Sea, lies
the Isle of Madagascar, called also of St. Laurence, or of Laurence Armeide who
discovered it, in the year One thousand five hundred and six, on the day of St.
Laurence. It is one of the greatest Islands in the World; containing about Six
hundred Leagues in Circuit, Two hundred and sixty in Length, and in some places
an Hundred in Breadth. Its Length reaches from North to South, from the
Eleventh Degree of South Latitude, to the Five and Twenteth, so that it is
almost altogether in the Torrid Zone, the Southern end of it being only
without it; over which the Tropic of Capricorn passes. It is very probable,
that they who have taken this for the Cerne of Pliny and the Menuthias of
Ptolomy are mistaken, and that the Ancients never knew it. It has no Towns,
only Villages beset with Stakes, the fairest of which is Fauzaire. The
Inhabitants have little or no Religion, they have neither Temples nor Altars;
they Fear a God, but Worship him not. The French have made some Voyages
thither, and printed Relations of the same

There are many little Isles about this, of the chief whereof we shall only
speak. To the East of it are the Isles of St. Mary, of Bourbon, Maurice, and
Diego Roiz. To the North, Gade, Agulha and Natal. To the West, Mohila, Camora,
Mayota, Johanna, and St. Christophers.

Near the Coast of Zonguebar is an Island of the same Name, having to the South
the Isle of Monfia, and to the North that of Pemba.

Near the Cape Guardafuy lies Zocotora with a Town of the same Name. This is
the Dioscorides of the Ancients; it produces the best Aloes and Dragons Blood;
between this and the said Cape lies another Island, called Abba del Curia.

It is to be observed that the greatest part of Africa is in the Torrid Zone,
and that the Line cuts it so exactly in the middle, that it reaches as far to
the South, as it does to the North of it, that is to the Five and thirtieth
Degree of South and North Latitude; however the much greater part is to the
Northwards.

CHAP. I. AMERICA.
WE are now come to the New World; for so Men has been pleased to call this
Continent which is divided from Europe, Asia and Africa, because it has not
been known to us much above an Hundred and four score years. It is held, that
Christopher Columbus a Native of Genoua first discovered it in the year One
thousand four hundred ninety two; yet it carries not his Name, but that of
Americus Vespucius a Florentine, who five years after Columbus, in the year One
thousand four hundred ninety seven, discovered Brasile; which was the cause
that all that part of the World is called America. It is likewise called the
West Indies, in distinction from the East Indies in Asia. It has to the East,
the Sea called the North Sea, Mar del Nort, to the West the South or Pacifick
Sea, to the South the Streights of Magellan; but its bounds to the North are
unknowen to us, and we cannot tell whether there be Seas or Lands. By the
Isthmus of Panama, which makes it two Peninsules, it is divided into the North
and South America.

In North America, and on the North Sea, are Estotiland, Greenland, Terra de
Laborador, Canada, or new France, New England, Maryland, Virginia, Carolina,
Florida, New Spain, Jucatan, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costarica and Veragua. And on
the Vermilian Sea, Anien, Quivira, and New Mexico.

In South America are Golden Castille, Guiana, Brasile, Plata, and Terra
Magellanica, all upon the North Sea, and on the South or Pacifick Sea, Chili,
and Peru; and Tucuman in the middle.

CHAP. II. North AMERICA.
ESTOTILAND, Greenland and Terra de Labrador or Laborador, have no Inhabitants
but Savages, who live amongst Ice and Snow, with which these Countries are
covered. The Reader must not expect Towns here, for there are none at all: We
are only to observe that Greenland is a Country lately discovered, and that
there was another of the same Name, which cannot now be found; though the Kings
of Denmark to whom it belonged, have in vain sent Ships in search of it. It had
Towns, with Churches, and Monasteries; but no body can tell what is become of
it: whether the passage to it be blockt up by the Ice, or that it has been
swallowed up in the Ocean.

Canada is called New France, because the French discovered and planted a
Colony in it; the chief places thereof are Quebec, and Tadoussac, upon the
great River of St. Laurence.

New England is a Rich and Flourishing Country, with many Towns, the chief
thereof is Boston, Inhabited by the English.

Maryland is Peopled by the King of Great Brittain's Subjects, and belongs to
the Lord Baltimore, who holds it of that Crown.

Virginia was so called by the English, because they discovered it in the time
of Queen Elizabeth who was never Married. In it is James Town, and some others;
the principal product of this Country is Tobacco, which from hence is carried
into most parts of Europe.

Carolina is a late Plantation of the English, not fully settled as yet.

Florida was so Named by the Spaniards, who discovered it on Palm Sunday. It
stretches to the South in form of a Peninsule: In it are the New ENGLAND

Guiana, and northern Brazil Towns or Villages of St. Matthew, St. Augustine, and
the River of the Holy Ghost.

New Spain is one of the loveliest Provinces in this New World. There stands
the City of Mexico, which gave the Name to a great Empire, whereof Montezuma
was the last King. Fernando Cortez Invaded it, in the year One thousand five
hundred and nineteen, took that Prince, and Conquered his Country. There are
many other Towns in that Country, the chief whereof are, Mechoacan, Los
Angelos, Vera Crux, Valladolid, and Guatamala. Mexico the Capital stands upon a
Lake, it is large and well peopled, being the Residence of a Viceroy, and Seat
of an Archbishop.

Jucatan is a Peninsule on the Bay of Mexico, the chief Town whereof is Merida.

Honduras has the Town of Truxillo.

Nicaragua has Cartagen, and Veragua and La Conception. These Three last
Provinces and Costarica, lie between the South Sea and the Bay of Mexico.

Anien is only remarkable for the Streights that carry its Name, which are by
some thought to be fabulous; and runs between Califurnia and the land of Jesso:
this land is supposed to stretch far out into the West, and is separated from
Asia, only by some branches of the Sea, and from Japan by the Streights of
Sangar.

Quivira was called New Albion by Sir Francis Drake Admiral of an English
Fleet, who discovered that Country in the year One thousand five hundred and
seventy nine: it lies on the Vermilian Sea, that divides it from Califurnia;
but there are no Towns observed in it.

New Mexico contains New Granada, wherein is the Town of Staff.

CHAP. III. South AMERICA.
UPon the Isthmus of Panama are two Towns, whereof the one that gives it the
Name, is upon the South Sea, and the other, which is upon the North, or rather
the Bay of Mexico, is called Nembre di dios. Beyond that space of Land, which
lies between the two Seas, are the following Regions on the North Sea.

Golden Castille, so called from that precious Metal which is found there in
abundance. Its chief Towns are Carthagena, St. Martha, and St. Fe de Bogota.

To the East of that is the Country of the Caribbes, in which is the North
Cape, well known to those that Sail in these Seas. The Inhabitants go stark
Naked, and have neither Government nor Religion.

Guiana is to the South; it has a Town called Manoa, and by the Spaniards El
Dorado (because there is much Gold in it) with a Lake of a vast extent, almost
under the Line. Some affirm that there are a kind of Monstrous People in that
Regions, who have no Heads, and have their Eyes in their Shoulders, and their
Bellies; but that is only learnt from the report of their Neighbors, who
heretofore told it to Sir Walter Raleigh, Admiral of an English Fleet under
Queen Elizabeth. We are not to believe all that we are told, neither are we to
deny all that we cannot believe. The truth is, that report of Men without Heads
is very strange, and seems contrary to the order of Nature, which is not guilty
of so considerable mistakes, as to fail in the production of a whole race of
People. Sometimes she produces Monsters, because she meets with bad
Dispositions that hinders her Operations; but as if she repented of what she
had done, and would disown such imperfect works, she puts a stop to the
progress, and suffers them not to propagate and beget others like themselves.

Brasile streches on the North Sea, from the River of Amazones to the Region of
De la Plata. The People go there stark Naked, neither sow nor reap, but live on
the Natural Fruits of the Earth, which are very plentiful in their Region, and
by Hunting and Fishing. They cat the Prisoners they take in War, rather to
satiate their Revenge than their Appetite. They have no Prince, no Laws, nor
Religion; and they believed not that there was a God, until they were
instructed by the Europeans, with whom they conversed.

The Portuguese, English, and Hollanders, have had Plantations there, and
sometimes Wars for their Titles. In that Country are the Towns of St. Salvador
or Baiae, on the famous Bay of Todos los Santos, Pernambouk, Rio Janeiro; and
several others. But let us not leave this fair Country without viewing the
most pleasant and biggest River of the World, that waters it: It is called
the River of Amazons, because some Women carrying Arms and Fighting, were
observed upon the Banks thereof. It is likewise called Oregliane, from a
Spanish Captain that sailed long upon it. It springs from the Mountains of
Peru, and carries its Streams through that Country into Brasile; where after a
course of Six hundred Leagues long, it pays the Sea the largest tribute that it
any where receives. Its Mouth, in the opinion of some, is Fourscore Leagues
over; and just under the Line it mingles with the North Sea.

The Region De la Plata is to the South of Brasile, and on the North Sea; it is
refreshed by a River that gives it both its Name and Water. The Portuguese have
called it Rio de la Plata, that is, the Silver River; because Silver is found
amongst the Sands it brings with it. On the side of it is the City of
Assumption; the others are St. Foy and the Visitation.

The Country of Chica, and that of Patagons, which borders on the Streights of
Magellen, are to the South beyond La Plata, Here are no Towns, some Capes and
famous Ports, as the Port Desire, and the Cape De las Virgins. It is true,
that on the Streights are to be seen the Ruin of a Town called Philippa, built
by the Spaniards, where they were almost all starved.

The most remarkable thing in this Region, is the People that inhabit it, and
are called Patagons; they have been reported to be Ten or Twelve foot high, and
to swallow down a Pail full of Wine, with as much ease as an ordinary Man one
Glass. They cover themselves with Beasts Skins, and carry Clubs, Bows and
Arrows. They lay their Dead upon little Hills, and cover them with heaps of
Stones, lest Beasts should devour them. It has not been observed that they
have any Laws or Religion. In a word, they are Barbarians, and for Strength and
Bulk of Body, some what exceed our Europeans; but our latest Discoveries will
not permit them to be Giants.

Having passed the Streights that were called after Magellan's Name who
discovered it, and had so much honor thereby; we find on the South Sea Cape
Desire, and advancing from South to North, Chili and Peru.

The Country Chili has these chief Towns, St. Jago, L' Imperial, La
Conception, and Baldivia.

Peru is is to the North of Chili, and reaches Five hundred Leagues from South
to North; it has to the West the South Sea, to the East the high Hills, which
the Spaniards call Las Cordilleras, or the Andes, perpetually covered with
Snow, in the midst of the Torrid Zone. when Pizarro and Almagro arrived in that
Country, in the year One thousand five hundred and twenty four, it was subject
to the Princes named Ingas, who had settled a powerful Empire in those Places,
extending above Fifteen hundred Leagues in circuit; they had governed there
above Six hundred years, when the Avarice and Ambition of those two Spaniards
promoted them to dethrone the last that swayed that Scepter; his Name was
Atahualpa, or Atabalipa, whom they took and caused to be strangled. Here they
found a prodigious quantity of Gold. The Inhabitants were Polite and Civil,
they worshipped the Sun, and believed there was another God Superior to him,
whom they called Pachacamac. The City of Cusco was the Imperial Seat of the
Ingas. The second in Dignity was Quito, situated almost under the Equinoctial;
both which remain still. The Spaniards have built many there, the most
considerable of which is Lima on the Sea side, with a Port. This is the
Residence of a Vicroy and Archbishop. The other chief Towns are Arica,
Arcquipa, St. Miguel, on the Sea, and in the Inland Potosi, near the famous
Mountain of the same Name, wherein are inexhaustible Mines of Gold and Silver;
La Plata, so called for its Silver Mines, San Juan del Oro, and some others.

The Original Natives of this Kingdom, have for the most part been extirpated
by their Conquerors; and those that were not, were converted to the Catholic
Faith: so that there are several of them Suffragant Bishops to the Archbishop
of Lima.

The Country of Cinnamon lies betwixt Peru and Guiana; it was so called, by
reason that there were Trees found there, whose Bark had a great affinity to
the true Cinnamon. There are no Towns nor Villages observed there.

Tucuman is between Chili and the Region De la Plata, and has St. Jago del
Estero for its chief Town.

We must now see what are the Mountains, Capes, Rivers, and Streights of this
New World.

Its chief Mountains are the Andes, or Las Cordilleras, which lie to the East
of Peru. The Ingas caused ways to be cut out in them, which surpassed all that
the Roman Grandeur ever could do. They filled up deep Valleys, and cut through
high Rocks; the remains of which prodigious Works are still to be seen.

In Mexico the Mount Popochampeche continually casts out Flames. The most
famous Capes, are Cape Breton, Cape Florida, the North Cape, and that of St.
Augustine.

Its greatest Rivers are that of St. Lawrence in Canada, of the Holy Ghost in
Florida, Oranoka, Maragnon, the River of Amazones, and Rio de la Plata, in
South America; all which run into the North Sea; no considerable Rivers fall
into the South Sea.

The most noted Streights are toward the North, those of Davies and Hudson;
toward the South the Streights of Magellan, Le Maire and Brouvers, of which we
shall speak, after that we have considered the Islands that lie about this
Continent.

CHAP. IV. The Isles of AMERICA.
WE shall in the first place view the Isles of the North Sea, which are the
most considerable; for there are but very few in the South Sea, and we shall
proceed from North to South New-Foundland is an Island near the Bay of St.
Lawrence and Land of Canada; upon the Banks of which there is a great
Cod-fishing.

The Isles of Assumption is in the Bay of St. Lawrence, and the Sandy Island,
to the South of New-foundland.

The Bermudas are in the middle of the Ocean, and the Bahaman Islands to the
East of Florida.

Cuba lies to the South of them, and upon the Mouth of the Bay of Mexico; it is
above Two hundred Leagues in length, and about Threescore in breadth: St. Jago
is its chief City, and an Episcopal Seat. Next to that is the Havana, where the
Spanish Flota Rendevouze,, and meets on their return homeward from America: it
lies on the West of the Island, and almost opposite to Cape Florida.

Hispaniola, called likewise St. Domingo, and by the Natives Haity, is about
Three hundred Leagues in circumference, and lies Eastward from Cuba. The
Capital City, which gives it the Name, is St. Domingo; the Residence of a
Viceroy, and Seat of an Archbishop. The object of Avarice is found there, I
mean Gold and Silver Mines. The Spaniards have dispeopled these two Islands and
banished the Natives, as they did from most of the others.

Jamaica lies South from Cuba, and belongs to England; the Two chief Towns of
it are St. Jago de la Vega, otherway called the Spanish Town, by whom it was
built, and Port Royal, or the Point, built by the English, and an excellent
Harbor; the Governor of the Island resides in the former. It is rich and in a
flourishing condition.

St. John de Portorico is to the East of Hispaniola; its chief Town, which is
that of St. John, has an excellent Harbor. This Island was formerly called
Boriquen.

The Caribbe Islands are to the East of the former, and, as it were, at the
Mouth of the Gulf of Mexico, which they seem to shut; they lie ranked in form
of a Crescent, and reach from North to South. The most remarkable of them are
Barbados, St. Christophers, Guadaloupe, Dominico, Martinico, Antego, Grenada,
and the Trinity. The English, Dutch, and French, possess most part of them.

Margareta lies somewhat more Westerly; and the Fishing of Pearls, which gave
it its name, renders it famous.

The Natives of these Islands, as in many places of the main Land, were Man
Eaters or Canibals, but at present the greatest part of them are destroyed, or
forced to seek some other way of living.

The Isle of Cayenne is near the main Land, upon the Coast of Guiana, an Island
made by the Mouth of a River called also Cayenne. The French had settled there
and printed Relations of it, but in the late Wars the Hollanders dispossessed
them, and have planted a Colony of their own. The Isle of Maranhaon, is also at
the Mouth of a River that likewise carries the same name.

The South Sea has very few Islands near to America, these are only found there:

Mocha, on the Coast of Chily, is an Island of some consideration. Califurnia
has been long taken for a Continent, but it is at length found to be an Island
supposed to be divided from the Land of Jesso, by the Straits of Anien, and
from New Granada, by a pretty large Channel, which is called the Vermilian Sea.

The Isles of St. Thomas, Nublada, and Rocapartida, are to the South of
Califurnia.

The Isles of Solomon are in the middle of the South Sea, toward the Coasts of
New Guinea.

And now you have, Reader, what we thought fit to speak of this New World. When
it was discovered, the Inhabitants were either plunged in Idolatry or void of
all Religion. Of this kind were the People of Brasile. Those of Mexico
worshipped Idols, and Sacrificed Men unto them; they plucked out the Hearts of
those wretched Victims, and threw them at the Feet of their Gods, made of Gold
and Silver.

The People of Peru were more moderate in their Worship, their Sacrifices were
not so cruel; they chose for their God the most Glorious of all the Lights of
Heaven, but they believed him not the Almighty, for they assigned a Father and
Sovereign to him, as well as to all other created Beings, and called him as we
have already said, Pachacamac. But it is strange, that in all this vast
Continent there was no trace of Christianity to be found; all of them were
ignorant of that, yea, and of a matter of far less importance, though of great
use, I mean of writing. They could not conceive how a piece of Paper could
convey the words and thoughts of People at a great distance to one another. We
may affirm that these Countries are every way far distant from ours. The
Beasts, Plants, Flowers and Fruits, are quite different from what are amongst
us; and the People of Europe imparted theirs to them, with the Religion that
they profess.

CHAP. V. The TERRA AUSTRALIS.
WHen Magellan passed the famous Streights that is called by his Name, on his
left hand to the South, he observed a Land that shone with multitudes of Fires,
and therefore he called it Terra del Fuego. He took it for a Part of the Terra
Australis; but Le Maire having discovered another Straight in the year 1616,
which carries his Name also, perceived that that Land of Fire was but an
Island, NORTH POLE
map of the nothern hemisphere from the North Pole, showing parts of Tartary,
Asia, Europe and America and observed another on his left hand, that he named,
Statenland, which in his Language signifies, the Country of the States
Brouvers, who found another Straight more Southward than that of Le Maire, in
the year One thousand six hundred and forty three, has discovered the Country
of the States to be likewise an Island.

Betwixt the 30 and 40 degrees of South Latitude, and the 210 and 220 of
Longitude, some late Maps mark a Country which they call New Zealand,
discovered in the year One thousand six hundred and fifty four.

Under the same Latitude, but between the 160 and 170 degrees of Longitude,
they mark another Land, discovered in the year One thousand six hundred and
forty two, called Antony van Diemanland: Under the same Longitude, and the
Tropic of Caprioorn, they place a Country called, New-Holland, discovered in
the year One thousand six hundred and forty four.

New Guinea is near the Molucca's, but it is believed to be an Island, and it
is not certain whether the Lands we have just now named, be Isles or parts of
the Continent.

To the South of the Cape of Good Hope, it is supposed that there is Land, and
some have called it the Land of Parrets. They talk of some Kingdoms there, but
all the knowledge we have of those Countries is very uncertain; for no progress
has been made into them: some small Touches of the Coast have only been
discovered. Time and Industry may possibly afford us greater Discoveries.

CHAP. VI. The Land near the ARCTICK or NORTH POLE.
ABout this Pole are Greenland, Nova Zembla, and Spitzberge, with some other
Countries, of which we know very little. It is certain that some have sailed
within Eight degrees of the Pole; and it is affirmed that the Hollanders have
been under the very Pole: but with what truth I shall not adventure to say.

It is thought by some, That about that place, America is joined to the
Continent, either on the side of Asia, or of that of Europe; but nothing of it
is yet certain.

It is to be observed that America reaches North, to the 70 degree or farther,
and South to the 52 or 53 degree of Latitude: so that it lies partly in the
Torrid Zone, partly in the North and South temperate Zones, and partly in the
Northern Frozen Zone.

Thus, Reader, I have given you a short and as exact Description of the Earth,
as I could, and have said nothing but what I thought true.

The little knowledge that we have of the Inland parts of these quarters of the
World, together with the uncertainty of the Relations of different Travelers,
made me unwilling to impose upon you for truth, those things that I was not
well satisfied in my self; which has rendered this Treatise possibly, more short
than the Vast tract of Land it pretends to describe, may seem to require.

FINIS.
