DIE SABBATTI. SEPTEMBER, 24. 1642.
WHereas, this Kingdom and Common wealth has been put to a great and vast
Charge by Delinquents and an ill affected Party which if it be not discharged
by them and their Estates, must necessarily lie as a Burden upon the good
Subjects that have no way deserved it. It is therefore thought fit and ordered
by the Commons assembled in PARLIAMENT, That the Houses of Delinquents or ill
affected Persons shall not be plunderd, pulled down or destroyed; but reserved
for the benefit and advantage of the Commonwealth, they being now considered
rather as the Houses of the Commonwealth then of Delinquents; and accordingly
to be so preserved, as they yield more profit and advantage to it.

Ordered by the House of Commons that this be forthwith printed and published.

Hen: Elsinge, Cleric. Parliament. D. Com.

Imprinted at LONDON by L. N. for E. Husbands and John Frank, and are to be
sold at their Shops in the Middle Temple, and next door to the Kings Head in
Fleetstreete. MDCXLII.
