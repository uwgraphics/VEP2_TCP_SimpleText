LONDON: Printed for Laurence Chapman, July 6. 1646.

To his Excellency, the Earl of Leven, The Petition of all the Officers and
Soldiers under your Excellencies command,
Shows,
THat whereas the whole Officers and Soldiers of this Army under your
Excellencies Command, out of their zeal to the Reformation of Religion, their
tender care to preserve and confirm the mutual Amity and Confidence of both
Kingdoms, and their earnest desires to vindicate their Honor from reproaches
and aspersions lying upon them; Have thought it necessary to emit a Declaration
of their Constancy and Integrity in the pursuance of the ends of the Covenant;
and likewise to supplicate His Majesty, that he would be pleased to comply with
the just desires of His Parliaments, and take some speedy course to put an end
to our lasting Miseries by settling of Truth and Peace.

May it therefore please your Excellency to represent our Desires in this
behalf to the Honorable Committee; and that we humbly conceive, the
uprightness of our Intentions herein (having nothing before our eyes, but the
good of Religion, his Majesty's happiness, and the Peace of these Kingdoms) will
procure a favorable acceptance of our Endeavors.

A DECLARATION OF The Lord General, The general Officers and Soldiers OF THE
Scottish Army at Newcastle, June 29. 1646.
THe many calamities and heavy pressures, the sad affliction lying upon these
Kingdoms this time past, and the great effusion of Christian blood occasioned
by the continuance of this unnatural War, having so deeply wounded us, And
being earnestly desirous to give some evident testimony of our Piety to God,
Loyalty to our Sovereign, and Love to these Kingdoms; that the constancy of our
affection to this Cause, our zeal to the Reformation of Religion, and His
Majesty's Person and Authority in defense thereof; And our firm Resolutions to
pursue the ends expressed in our Solemn League and Covenant, may appear to the
World: We have thought it necessary in this juncture of time, when all means
are essayed by the Enemies of Truth and Peace to disparage our proceedings, by
rendering suspected our best actions and endeavors, to the begetting of
misunderstanding, and weakening the Union between the two Kingdoms, to Declare
and make known, That as we have entered into a Solemn League and Covenant, with
our hands lifted up to the most High God, with real Intentions to promote the
ends thereof, So do we resolve, God-willing, constantly to adhere to the whole
Heads and Articles of the same, And for no earthly tentation, for no fear or
hope, to fall away and violate our Sacred Oath.

We do likewise profess, That nothing has been with greater care and
faithfulness endeavored by us; then to preserve the happy Union and Brotherly
correspondence between the Kingdoms, as a principal mean of happiness to both;
And shall continue in the same care to avoid every thing that may tend to the
infringement thereof, with a special regard and tenderness to the Interests of
both Kingdoms: For the strengthening of which Union, and removing every thing
that might obstruct the same, As hitherto we have had no compliance, nor kept
correspondence with known Enemies and Malignants, So will we never hereafter
give countenance or encouragement to any person disaffected to the Parliaments
of either Kingdom.

And that the Integrity of our Intentions, and the uprightness of our Desires
may be the more manifest, We do Declare, That we abhor all public and private
ways, contrary to the Covenant, and destructive to the happiness of both
Kingdoms, We disclaim all dealing with those that are Instruments of these
unhappy Troubles and Impediments of Peace, And with all such persons who will
not use all means and endeavors, and contribute their best Counsels and Advice
for hasting an end to our lasting Miseries, and procuring a sure and
well-grounded Peace; and in particular we do abominate and detest that
execrable Rebellion of James Grahame utterly, abjuring all manner of conjunction
with him and his Confederates, And with all other known Enemies, or declared
Traitors to either Kingdom, notwithstanding of any insinuations to to the
contrary expressed in some Letters, as is said, by His Majesty to the Earl of
Ormond in Ireland; for we have none but single Intentions, and unfeigned Desires
of Peace, renouncing all communion with whatsoever designs and practices
contrived in the dark to the prejudice of Religion, and Tranquillity of these
Kingdoms, the only principles by which we move.

And as we came into this Kingdom at the earnest desires of our Brethren, to
assist them in the time of their great Extremity, in the pursuance of the
National Covenant, not for any mercinary ends, nor to enrich our selves, as is
falsely and calumniously charged upon us by those that wish not well unto us
nor our cause; So shall we be most willing to depart and return home in Peace,
with the same cheerfulness and affection that we had when we came in: Nor
shall the matter of money, or want of just Recompense for the Service
performed, and hardship sustained, be to us an Argument of our stay; But
leaving the consideration of these things to the wisdom and discretion of both
Parliaments, we shall so far deny our selves, as not to suffer any private
respects of our own, to retard the advancement of this cause, or prejudge the
public work of both Kingdoms.

We cannot conceal, but must acknowledge how sensible we are, and have always
been of the many Complaints presented to the Parliament of England against this
Army, and the heavy Calumnies and Aspersions lying upon us for having
committed Insolences, and oppressed the people by taking free quarter,
offering our selves most willing and ready, that whosoever amongst us have by
their Misdemeanors, Miscarriages, or Inordinate way of walking, scandalized the
Cause for which we have taken our Lives in our hand, or endeavored to beget a
Misunderstanding, or foment Jealousies between the Kingdoms, we shall strive to
discover all such, and labor to bring them to public Trial and condign
punishment: Not doubting, but as we are zealous to vindicate our Honor and
Reputation from all reproaches, so the Parliament will likewise be pleased to
have such favorable construction of our proceedings, as not willingly to harbor
any Thoughts which may lessen their respects to us, and which are not suitable
to the constant Tenor of our carriage and profession: And we shall likewise
desire, That the manifold necessities, and pressing wants to which we were many
times reduced, may not be forgotten; and that the ways and means appointed for
our supply, neither answered the expectation of the Honorable Houses of
Parliament, nor satisfied our necessities, so that for want of Moneys we could
not always discharge our quarters; Yet do we most freely declare our
willingness to allow of whatsoever has been taken up by us, and for that
effect we desire the Accounts of the Army to be adjusted with the several and
respective Counties, that what ever can be justly charged upon us, may be
discounted off any Sums that shall be resting us in Arrear: And if we knew any
thing else that could serve to remove all Jealousies and Misunderstandings, and
beget a more full confidence of our uprightness, we should with the same
readiness apply our selves to all the ways that might conduce thereunto.

But, because His Majesty's su^den and unexpected coming into this Army does
minister new occasion to us, to give some demonstration of our constancy,
though we hope His Majesty came with real Intentions, to satisfy the just
desires of His Parliaments, and compose all those differences. Yet, lest it
should bring in question the Clearness and Integrity of our ways, whereof
our Consciences do bear us witness, and our actions shall be public and
real testimo^ies; We do protest* that His presence with us, has not
begotten any alteration in our minds in the least measure to estrange us from
the ways of our Covenant, or alienate our Resolutions from going on Zealously,
Constantly, and Unanimously, to set forward the ends therein expressed,
endeavoring (so far as lies in our power) to improve that providence of His
coming to ^s* to the public good and happiness of both Kingdoms. And as it
is our earnest desire, that His Majesty would no more suffer Himself to be
involved in the Counsels, whereof He h^^ had so sad experience, to the
endangering of His Person, Posterity, and Kingdoms; So do we exceedingly
wish, that He would comply with the Counsels of His Parliaments, to the
satisfaction of His good people: And we shall be careful that nothing proceed
from us, which may give occasion to His Majesty to entertain any secret
confidence, that this Army will give assist^nce for advanceing other ends then
such as are agree^ble to our Covenant, conducing to the good of Religion, the
happiness of the King and His Posterity, and sa^^tie of the King^omes.

Signed by his Excellency the Earl of Leven the general Officers, and three
Commissioners from every Regiment of the Army.

The Petition of the Earl of LEVEN, Lord General, the general Officers,
Colonels and Captains, etc. of the Scottish Army, presented to His MAJESTY at
NEW CASTLE.
WE, your Majesty's loyal Subjects and faithful Servants, the Lord General,
the general Officers, the Colonels and Captains in the Scottish Army, now in
the Kingdom of England, from the deep sense of the bleeding condition of these
Kingdoms so heavy pressed with sad afflictions, through the unhappy differences
between your Majesty and your Subjects, from the true affection and zeal to
the Reformation of Religion, and your Majesty's Person and Authority in
defense thereof; And in the pursuance of that Sacred Oath which we have taken
with our hands lifted up to the most high God, Do make our humble address,
and tender this earnest Petition to your Majesty in our name, And in the name
of all the inferior Commanders and Soldiers under our charge, That your
Majesty, in your Wisdom and Goodness, may be pleased to take a speedy
course for settling of Religion and Church Government in this Kingdom,
according to the Word of God, and example of the best Reformed Churches, and
bringing the Churches of the three Kingdoms to the nearest conjunction and
Uniformitie; And for establishing the Privileges and Liberties of your
Kingdoms, according to the desires of Your good People. We may not conceal
our unfeigned grief, for that Your Majesty has not yet been pleased to
authorize and sign the Covenant, which we are confident would bring honor to
God, happiness to your Self and Posterity, and indeare Your Majesty (above
measure) to all Your faithful and loyal Subjects: In the just defense
whereof, as many of them have already lost their lives, so are we ready to
sacrifice ours.

We must also pray your Majesty to compassionate the distressed condition of
your Kingdoms groaning under the heavy pressures of manifold calamities,
occasioned by the continuance of this unnatural War; and to comply with the
Councels of your Parliaments; that all differences being happily composed, and
the Armies in both Kingdoms disbanded, we may return home in peace, or be
disposed of otherwise by your Majesty, with the advice of your Parliaments,
which may be most for Your Majesty's honor and service, and the prosperity of
these Kingdoms.

Signed by his Excellency the Earl of Leven, the general Officers, and three
Commissioners from every Regiment of the Army.

By His Majesty's Command.
I Am in his Name to return this Answer to the Petition presented to him by
the Lord General, the General Officers, the Colonels, and other Officers and
Soldiers of the Scottish Army, That his Majesty came into the Scottish Army,
with full intent of Settling an Happy Peace in these His Kingdoms, and to
satisfy the Just Desires of His good Subjects; and likewise to comply with His
Parliaments in all things which shall be for the good of Religion, and the
Happiness of His Subjects, which he will always prefer to all worldly
interests: And whenever it shall please God so to bless His Majesty's
endeavors, as to settle an Happy Peace in these His Dominions, His Majesty
will be very solicitous to find out some means of Honorable Employment for
so many Gallant Men as are employed in this Army.

At Newcastle 27. of June, 1646. Lanrick.

FINIS.
