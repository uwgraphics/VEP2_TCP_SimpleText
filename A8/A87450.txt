The just reward of Rebels, OR The Life and Death of Jack Straw, and Wat Tyler,
who for their Rebellion and disobedience to their King and Country, were
suddenly slain, and all their tumultuous Rout overcome and put to flight.

Whereunto is added the Ghost of Jack Straw, as he lately appeared to the
Rebels in Ireland, wishing them to forbear and repent of their Divellish and
inhumane Actions against their lawful King and Country.

The Rebellious Life and Death of VVat Tyler and Jack Straw.
OBedience (says a learned Father) is a Virtue due both unto God and man, to
God as our Creator, to Man as our superior; and a learned Philosopher tells
us, that to know how to obey, and how to command are two things and thus
differ; for the one comes by Nature, the other by Experience: That Country is
well managed where the King knows Royalty to govern, and his People
faithfully to serve. The Prince is supreme head of all Authority, and the
Subject is enjoined to obey God, the Laws, and his Prince; for Treason can
have no place where Obedience claims principality. So much for the
Introduction, I come now to the matter it self.

Richard the second of that name, the Son of Prince Edward, (commonly called the
black Prince) the eldest Son of King Edward the third, being then a Child of
the age of eleaven years, began his Reign over the Realm of England the 22.
of June, in the year of our Redemption 1327. being the 13. year of Charles
the sixth of that name, then King of France, he was called Richard of Burdeux as
being borne there, and upon the fifteenth day of July in the year above
mentioned, was Crowned at Westminster, being the day of the translation of St.
Swithin, which time was Major Nicholas Brembre Grocer, and Andrew Pikman and
Nicholas Twifford Shreifes.

In the third year of this Kings Reign, and toward the latter end thereof,
William Walworth Fishmonger being Major, and Walter Docket, and William
Knighthood Shriefes. About the beginning of summer in diverse places of the
Land, the Commons arose in Kent, in Essex, in Suffolk etc. and made amongst
them Rulers and Captains, of which (according to some Chronologers) one was
named Wat Tyler, a second William Waw, a third Jack Straw, a fourth Jack
Shepherd, a fifth Tom Miller, a sixth Hob Carter, but the best and most
approved Records style them thus: John, or Walter Tylor, John, or Jack Straw,
John Kerby, Allen Threader, Thomas Skot, and Ralph Rugg, all of them of that
dissolute and desperate condition, that like Herostratus, who set fire of
Dianaes Temple in Ephesus (which was one of the seven wonders of the world)
and burnt it down to the ground for no other reason, but that he would be
talked of after his death, according to the strict decree of of the Ephesians,
(who made it death for any man to speak of her) are not worthy to be named.

But I proceed in my Discourse, according to the most exact and authentic
Chronicle of St. Albones, which makes this report. The young King in his
minor^ty granted a great Tax upon his Subjects both spiritual and temporal,
which was called Pole-mony, that is a groat upon every pole or head, which
could call themselves man or woman: which coming in very slowly, diverse
Courtiers about the King desirous to enrich themselves by the goods of the
Commons, complained that it was not faithfully gathered by the Collectors,
wherefore they offered to pay a great sum of money to farm it of the King,
which they would gather over and above that which had bin paid, so that by the
King they might be sufficiently authorized, who getting Letters to that
purpose, sat as Commissioners in diverse places of Kent, and Essex, and handled
the people very roughly and discourteously, beyond either mercy or conscience,
who no doubt if they had proceeded with clemency and humanity, might have
prevented those fearful and horrible disasters which after happened, for the
Commons took counsel, and they had private conventions amongst themselves and
growing to an head made resistance against those exactors rising against them,
of which some they slew, others dangerously wounded, and the rest were forced
to save themselves by flight.

Which tumult began first in Kent, and upon this occasion following one of
those Collectors of the Groates or Pole-mony, coming to the house of one Wat
Tyler, (so called because he was of that Trade, for his sir name is not
otherwise remembered) who dwelt at Dartford in Kent, twelve miles from London)
and demanded of his wife money for her Husband, her self, and her servant,
which she refused not to pay, but the covetous greedy fellow seeing her
daughter, a maid scarce 15. years of age in the house, demanded a groat for
her also: to whom she modestly replied, that she was but a child, and was not
arrived unto that mat^rity to be reckoned in the number of women: No, says the
Collector, that shall be tried, and taking her up in his arms most uncivilly
and dishonestly took up her clothes, and bared her before her mother saying,
he would see whether she had any pubes upon her or no; and in many places the
like barbarous demeanor had bin used: at which the mother hearing her daughter
screech out, and seeing how in vain she struggled against him, being therewith
grievously offended, she cried out also, and leaving the house run into the
street amongst her Neighbors, clamoring about that there was one within that
would ravish her daughter: The noise and hubbub grew suddenly so great, that it
came to the ear of the Husband, who was then tyling of an house in the Town;
who instantly snatching up his Lathing-staffe made what have he could home,
where finding his daughter weeping and perceiving how she had bin ruffled by
the Collector, demanded of him the reason of his uncivil boldness? who
answered him he was a saucy fellow to ask him such a question, he had
authority for what he did, neither would be give him any account at all for
what had passed; and withal made offer to strike at the Tyler, who avoiding
the blow up with his staff, and reached him such a knock upon the pate that he
brake his Skull, and the brains flew about the room, which seeing he
presently left the house, told the Neighbors what had happened, that his cause
was now theirs, at which there was great noise and uproare, they all justifying
the act to be good and honest, and that to their best and utmost power, with
their lives and goods, they would assist and support him.

And thus that many-headed monster, the multitude being drawn together, they
tumultuously went from thence unto Maid-stone, and from thence increasing their
number, they came back to Black Heath, encouraging all the Country as they past
along, to be partakers with them in their commotion, when besetting all the
ways that directed either from London to Canterbury, or from thence to London:
They staid and arrested all Passengers of what degree or condition foever,
compelling them to swear; First that they should keep fast and firm their
Allegiance to the good King Richard, and to the Commons, and next, if his
Majesty should fail, they should accept of no Sovereign whose name was John,
which was for the great envy which they bare unto John Duke of Lancaster, and
uncle to the King, who by reason of his conquest of Spain, writ himself King
of Castile. And further that they should not yield unto any Tax that should be
leavied in the Kingdom, from thence forward, nor consent unto any unless it
were a fifteen.

The rumor of these bold and presumptuous actions, was quickly spread into
Sussex, Essex, Hertford-shire, Cambridge-shire, Suffolk, Norfolk etc. for
Fama malum quo non aliud velocius -- now when these daily conventions of the
Commons increased, and their number was almost grown unto an infinite, so that
they thought themselves to be of that strength, that no power was able to
resist them; they began now to think of nothing but misdemeanour and
misbeliefe, framing themselves to all the rebellious irregularity that could be
devised even unto brutish cruelty.

For first they proclaimed an Edict, to apprehend all Lawyers, whether Judges,
Benchers, Barristers or younger Students, and all Justices of Peace, or grand
Jurors, and to cut off their heads, of which they spared none that fell into
their hands, neither was there any one, whom they supposed to have any learning
at all, if they found but a Pen and Inkhorne about him, upon whom they did not
unanimously cry out with this acclamation, Hence away with him, cut off his
head.

The Rebels of Essex having joined themselves with these of Kent, there came
certain Noble men, and Knights from the King to them, being then on black
Heath, to demand of them the cause of this their unlawful assembly, to whom
they sawcily and most unreverently made answer: That for certain causes best
known to themselves they were come together: but the chiefest was to have some
talk with the King, and therefore bad them tell him so, and further if he
would come thither in person, they would tell him their grievances, but to none
else they would reveal them.

His Majesty by some who was near about him was counseled because of the
present necessity to satisfy their request in that, and by reason it was no
further to give unto them a meeting with all speed possible; but Simon Sudbury
then Archbishop of Canterbury, and Lord Chancellor, and Robert Hales, of St.
John's, Lord high Treasure would by no means admit of their Counsel, affirming
that it was not for the Kings honor to yield to the desires of such base and
refractory Rebels: but rather to take order for the speedy leavying of an Army
to suppress them: of which the Commons having got Intelligence: they solemnly
vowed, and in great fury swore, that they would cut off those Traitors heads,
and to that purpose, they left black Heath, and instantly marched toward
London.

And first they dispersed themselves in Southwarke, filling all the places of
the Barrough, and the place being not able to contain a tenth part of them,
they quartered themselves in the fields, and Country thereabouts; and by
reason of the vowed malice and envy that they bore unto the Archbishop, their
first Barbarous attempt was to set upon his Palace at Lambeth, which they
rifled and spoiled, and wonder it was, in regard of their Brutish fury, that
they had not set it on fire, and burnt it down to the ground.

In the interim, the Lord Major, and the Aldermen, fearing also that they would
make spoil of the City, called a Counsel amongst themselves, in which many
things were debated for their public security, and in the end concluded to
shut up their gates, let down their Percullices, chained their streets, and
the Citizens should arm themselves, man the walls, and stand upon their guard.
But the Mechanics and meanest sort of people, who always are apt to envy
their superiors, and are therefore prone to any Innovation, favoring the
cause of the seditious Commons, were so far from suffering the Major and the
Sheriffs to come near unto the gates, and by shutting them to keep the
Rebels out, that they insolently opposed them, threatening death to any should
attempt it.

This was the occasion, that all the night following being the Eve before
Corpus Christi day, the Rebels had free ingresse and egresse in and out of the
gates, by which they stirred up the Commons of the City, as Artificers,
Laborers, and Apprentises to take part with them, and join to their faction,
making a fair pretense, that their purpose was only to search out such as
were traitors to the King and his Realm, and they being cut off, to make a
cessation of Arms, and every one peaceably to retire himself into his own
Country.

This fair pretense wrought much in the hearts of the giddy multitude, and the
rather because notwithstanding their great number, which was difficultly to be
guided they offered violence neither to man nor woman neither took any
commodity from them, but at a just and competent price; for whomsoever of their
own society they found either pillidging or stealing, they used Martial Law,
and commanded his head instantly to be smitten off: The morrow after they had
communication with diverse of the most substantial Commons of the City to whom
if they would adhere unto them, and take part with them, they promised absolute
freedom and liberty: insomuch that the most or all of the meaner sort, were
suddenly drawn into their conspiracy: for joy whereof they were admitted
into the Vintners and Merchants Cellers, where they quaffed and drank together
Healths by no allowance, with which License not being acquainted, it so wrought
within them, that some were merry, others mad: a motion was made to go
instantly to the Savoy, which then was the Palace, and domestic dwelling of
the Duke of Lancaster, a place for the rich furniture thereto belonging,
through the whole Kingdom was not to be paralleld) and either to burn it, or
raze it down to the earth; for he being an excellent and worthy Prince, their
malice toward him was implacable.

Thither they tumultuously hurried in heaps, and setting fire in diverse
places thereof made it suddenly all in a flame, and to give the greater coour
to their insolence, caused Proclamation to be made, that that was done was not
to their own use or proper ends, for no man upon pain of death should reserve
any thing, but that all plate and vessels of Silver and gold, or jewels which
were there in abundance should be battered, defaced, and broken into small
pieces and cast into the river, which was accordingly performed, but as our
Author writes, one of the Rebels contrary to the Proclamation took a silver
Plate, and hid it in his bosom, which being espied by one of his fellow
Rascals, he made it known to the rest, who instantly laid hold upon him, and
without further examination or Trial, cast him into the fire with the Plate,
with this loud acclamation, We are the maintainers of Truth and justiec and
are neither Thieves nor robbers.

It is further remarkable, that some of these robbers, to the number of two or
three and thirty had got into a Celler of the same house, where they drank so
much sweet and pleasant wine, that they could not find the way out again in
any seasonable time, but with the ruins of the house were so barracadoed in
with Timber, rubbish and stone, that they were heard crying and calling for
help and succor seven days after, where they perished, all being or not
able, or not willing to relieve them.

This exploit being over, they again assembled and broke open a place which
was called the new Temple at the bar, which was a place for Lawyers, and quite
demolisht it for no other reason, but the hate which they bore to Sr, Robert
Hayles, Master of St. John's Hospital, unto which place that of St. John's of
the Temple belonged. There many writings and Monuments which were then in the
custody of the Lawyers were destroyed by fire: after the ruin of this place,
many through weariness, and others over-laded with wine, lay down under the
walls and stalls there a bouts, where some were slain by those on whom they
had committed such outrages, and some killed one another upon that advantage for
ancient and former grudges.

In the interim whilst these things were in action, another dangerou troop had
gathered themselves together to set fire on the Palace of S. John's in
Clarkenwell, which was seen to burn seven days together, they not suffering
any man to lay a helping hand to quench it, on the Friday after they burnt the
manor of Highbury, the multitude of the Commons being at that time divided
into three several bands, of which division one part was employed in the
burning of Highbury and other places belonging to the Prior of St. John's. A
second Company lay at Mile-End East of the City, A third lodged themselves upon
the Tower Hill, to intercept all such Victual as was for the Kings provision,
whilst they on Mile-end sent a bold and peremptory message to the King to make
his personal appearance before them, and that too all delays and excuses set
apart unarmed, and without any guard or power to attend him, which if he should
deny to do, they would not only pluck down the Tower upon his head, but
neither he, nor any of his Attendants should depart alive. Observe herein what
rebellion is, and to what impudence it grows, when those that are the Actors
therein transgress all the bounds of Religion and reason, but it follows
(for so the Chronicle relates) that his Majesty advised by some few that were
at that time about him, with a small train, and those altogether unarmed went
toward them, (no doubt in great fear) riding on horseback. The gates of the
Tower standing open, and a great many of the rascal rabble entering and
returning at their own wills and pleasures.

Here is another thing worthy of note to all Posterity, but especially to the
braver spirits of our own Nation, that there were at the same instant, six
hundred Armed men reputed valiant and expert in Arms, besides six hundred
able Archers, who all this time hanging down their heads, were mute and stood
amazed. They being appointed to guard the sacred person of the King who
suffered those pesantly rusticks void of all manners or humanity to enter his
Highness privy Bedchamber, and the Queen Dowager his mothers, with their
weapons in their hands, and yet against them, made at all no resistance N: ay
saw them there to play the impudent wantons by lying and sporting on his
Highness own bed, and further in their homely and base accouterment, most
sawcily to offer to ruffle and kiss the mother queen, whilst they stood
patiently by and sufred it, had these things bin reported to have bin done in
any other Foreign Countres, as we should have thought them altogether
incredible, but they are related by our own Domostick Chronologer.

Whilst these things were in agitation, some of this rude rabble made strict
inquiry for the Archbishop, and some searching one place, and some another,
and not finding him, at length finding one of his servants, with incredible
fury they threatened unto him present death, unless he would bring them to his
Lord and Master, whom they most unreverently called by their own name Rebel
and traitor.

This groom fearing his life, and therefore not any way daring to contradict
or to displease them, presently conducted them to the Chapel in the Kings
Lodgings, where after mass had been said and sang, the Reverent Prelate was
then busy in his private Orisons, for having received the Sacrament, and
ignorant either of their coming or purpose, he had the night before confessed
himself to his Ghostly Father (for such was the custom in those days) who
when he heard that they were come, and had broke open some doors against him,
with a noble and Christian-like constancy said to those few of his retinew who
at that time attended him. The enemy is now come, let us go and boldly meet
him, for seeing things stand as they now do, it is much better for us to dye
like Martyrs, then to live, being reported no better then Malefactors.

At which word the Rebels entered with this clamor, where is this Traitor to the
King and commonwealth? To which he answered, Lo I am the man you seek, the
Archbishop but no Traitor, where presently they laid rude and violent hands
upon his Sacred person, and dragging him out of the Chapel, drew him from the
Tower, to the Tower hill, where being compassed and enclosed with their swords
and weapons advanced, he appeared no way discouraged or daunted, but with a
Martyr-like constancy uttered these words following.

Resolve me, my dear brethren, what you purpose to do, what is my offense
against you or any man for which you purpose to shed mine innocent blood, it
were good for you to advise before you take away my life, for if I be thus
undeservedly slain, who am your Pastor, there must consequently fall upon you,
the great indignation of the just Revenger, besides for such an heinous fact,
all the whole shall be interdicted: scarce had he ended those few words before
they cried out with an horrible clamor that the men there feared nor cared for
any interdiction, nor would they allow the Pope to have any power or Supremacy
over them: the Archbishop seeing his inevitable death before him (being an
eloquent man, and wise, beyond most of the Kingdom) gave unto them very fair
and comfortable words, desisiring them only to give some short space to pray
for his souls health, and then he would submit himself to their utmost
cruelty, which being scarcely granted, he forgave the Executioner and kneeling
down offered his head to be smitten off by the headsman.

The first stroke made a great wound in his neck, but was not mortal, when the
Archbishop putting his hand to the place uttered these words, Aha, it is the
hand of God, nor could he so soon remove his hand but at the second blow he
wounded him deeper and cut off the ends of his fingers, at which he fell
grovelling, but was still alive, till being piteously mangled by eight several
blows he gave up his last breath into his hands from whom he first received
it, all that day his body lay unburied, and till the morrow being Satterday
none daring to afford it at any burial, but took his head and nayling his
head upon it fixed it on a Pole, and set it upon London Bridge in the same place
where before was fixed the head of Sir John Minster-worth.

This reverend Arch Bishop Simon Tibald, Alias Sandbury, son to Nicholas
Tibald borne in Sudbury, a town in Norfolk, Doctor of both Laws, had been
eighteen years Bishop of London, who was cruelly murdered, and his body
after borne to Canterbury, and buried in the Cathedral Church: There dyed with
him a most valiant Knight called Sir Robert Hayles, Lord of St. John's, and
Treasurer of England with John Legate, one of the Kings Sergeants at Arms, and
with them a Friar of the Order of St. Frances, whose name was William
Axpledore, and was at that time Confessor to the King. There was executed also
by the Brutish tyranny of these Rebels, one Richard Lions, an exquisite
Lapidary, and a Goldsmith, who had bin some few years before Shriefe of the
City of London, who was most inhumainly drawn out of his own house into
Cheap side, and there beheaded.

Many the same day had their heads cut off, as well Flemings as English and for
no other cause, but only to fulfill the madness of the barbarous Commons, for
they spared no men who were not of their diabolcall faction, but they cut off
their heads, saying, they cared not whether they sent them, to God, or to the
Devil: All sacred places they hold in contempt, as such as they had never bin
acquainted with, for even in the Temples, and at the time of divine Service,
they did not forbear to kill and murder any man to whom they had any spleen
or malice: But especially their envy was to the Dutch, whom they termed by the
general name of Flemings, who as they supposed sucked the very moisture and
marrow of the Kingdom, and therefore out of the Augustine Friars Church in
London, they fetched thirteen Flemings, and out of another Church, (not named
in the Chronicle) to the number of seventeene, and thirty two out of the
Vine-tree, and so out of other places of the City, as also Southwarke, whose
heads they struck off without any mercy, unless they could plainly pronounce
Breed and Cheese, for if their speech sounded any way toward Brott and Cawse,
off went their heads without redemption, etc.

But I lest the King at Mile-end, it is most pertinent to the History that I
give you account how he sped there; thus therefore it follows: His Majesty
riding thither rather commanded then invited, was in a great strait and fear
withal, when he cast his eye upon such a multitude of unruly Rascals, who
with supercilious fronts gave him an unmannerly salute, he there from fashioned
himself to the necessity of present and demanded of them what they desired?
who delivered unto him a writing, which they said they would have him confirm
by his Letters Pattent, the effect of part of their demands were these.

First, that all men in the Kingdom whatsoever, should be free from servitude
and bondage, so as from that time there should be no bondmen at all, or to
hold any Tenure in villanage etc.

Secondly, that he should grant his free and general pardon to all men of what
estate soever, of all manner of Actions, or insurrections committed, and all
Rebellion, Treason, Fellonics, Extortions, Robberies, traingressions by any of
them done, and further that their peace might be so confirmed, that
there-after their former insolences might not be called in question, etc.

Thirdly, that all persons from time forward might be infranchised, and have
free liberty to buy and sell in every Country, City, Borrough Town, Fair, or
Market or otherwise within the Realm of England, etc.

Fourthly, that no Acres of Land held in service or bondage, should be held
but for some pence the Acre, and if it had gone for less in former time, it
should not there-after be inhanced: These and many other things they required,
to be confirmed by his Majesty, telling him boldly withal, that he had evilly
governed till that day, and that they would take order that from that time
forward be should be better counseled.

The King perceiving by their sudden four countenances, that unless he
granted punctually to every of their demands, (though never so unreasonable)
his person was in great danger, being by them round mvironed, and therefore no
possible means of his escape sealed to their writings; and desiring Truce for
some small time departed thence without any violence done unto his person; and
the Essex men returned home peaceably into their Country.

On the morrow being Satterday, and the fifteenth or June, the King after
dinner, went from the Wardrobe in the Royal which is in London, to
Westminster, to visit the shrine of St. Edward King and Confessor, and withal
to see whether upon it they had committed any outrage by defacing it: Then
went he to the Chapel called our Lady in the Piew, where after he had offered
up his Orisons he returned by the Suburbs of West Smith-field, where he found
the place thronged with the Kentish Rebels, wherefore he sent to their
Captain to inform them, that he had pacified their fellows the Essex men,
who had abandoned Mile-end, and were peaceably departed home-ward, and that he
was pleased in his gracious clemency to grant unto them the like conditions of
peace; and superscribe to the same Articles if they pleased to accept of them.

But their chief Captain whom some call John, but the best Chronologers call
Walter Hiliard, Alias Tyler, being of a subtle and crafty condition, and
wickedly witty made answer, that though he had then the power in his hands, yet
he was willing to listen unto peace but only thus, with some particular
conditions added to his own approbation and liking, his purpose being to feed
the King and the Nobility with delays, till he had compassed his diabolical
purpose, whose plot was first the same night to have surprised the King, and
all those Peers which then attended him, Courtiers and others, and then to
have spoiled the City, and then to have burnt it to the earth, by setting fire
in four parts thereof at once.

But the Providence of Heaven, who always favors and protecteth Justice and
innocense, diverted his mischief which he intended against others, and powered
it on his own head, as shall appear by the sequel. For whereas the
conditions of peace were engrossed in their several Charters, and thrice sent
unto him by the King not any of them seemed to please him, therefore his
Majesty sent unto him a Knight, Sir John Newton, a man both of great courage
and discretion not to command, but to entreat him, as from the King his
Sovereign (for his great insolence and pride was known to all) that he would
vouchsafe to come and speak with him about his own demands, which should be
inserted into his Charter: of which demands* by this one which I will set
down, it may manifestly appear, how uncharit^ble how unchristianlike all the
rest were.

First, he desired to have a Commission sealed, to behead all Lawyers, of what
degree soever, from the highest to the lowest; all Escheaters, or whatsoever by
reason of their office communicated with the Law. For his apprehension was, and
if this could be compassed, all affairs should be ordered according to the
fancy of the Commons, and to change the Monarchy into an Anarchy: For (it is
said) that but the day before he had made his boast, putting his hand to his
lips that before four days were come about, all the Laws of England should
proceed from his own mouth.

Now whilst the Knight importuned him for dispatch, that he might return his
answer to the King his Master, he contracted his brow, and in great rage
replied: If thou be so hasty, go get thee back unto him, and say; I will
come unto him at mine own pleasure and leisure. Notwithstanding which, he
followed on horseback with a stately and slow pace, casting his eyes about him
(as he rode) as glorying in the multitude, and that he had been the Prince of
all that people. In his way he was encountered by a Doublet-maker, who had
delivered in threescore doublets to the chief of the Commons by his
appointment and demanded for them thirty marks, to whom the Captain made
answer; Friend content thy self for a while, I will see thee well and fully
satisfied before this day be fully ended.

He then set forward, leaving his company behind'him, and came so near unto
the King, that his horse brushed against the Kings horses crupper, and the
first words he spoke unto him were these; Sir King, see thou all you people?
Yes, answered the but wheresore do thou ask me that question? Because
(replied he) they be all at my commandment* and have sworn to me their faith
and obedience, to do all things what soever I shall impose on them. In good
time, answered the King, I believe it well. Then said the Rebel, Beleevest
thou King, that this people, and as many mo as be in this City at my command
and service, will depart from thee thus without thy Charters? No, said the
King* you shall willingly receive them, and they shall be presently delivered
unto you.

The King no sooner ended his speech, but the proud Rebel casting a scornful
eye upon Sir John Newton, who at that time bore the sword, and was on
horseback, as if he had been much offended, said unto him, that It would
better have becommed him to have been on foot, than so mounted in that
presence, To whom the Knight not forgetting his old courage, made answer, that
he hoped there was no great offense in that, seeing himself was on horseback
also. At which reply he was so much incensed, that he called him Traitor,
drew his dagger and pressing toward him, offered to wound him; who boldly drew
his dagger also, and told him he lied, and withal made toward him, but they
were kept asun^er. Wat Tyler scorning to take such an affront before his
companions, drew his sword too, and made after him. But the King seeing him in
such danger, commanded him to alight, and deliver his dagger up to the
Captain. But when his scarce-heard off insolence could not be therewith
satisfied, he said that he would have his sword also. The Knight answered, that
the sword was the Kings, and further said, Thou art a Rebel, and not worthy of
it, nor durst thou demand it of me, if thou and I were alone together in this
place. To which Wat Tyler, now in a greater fury, replied; I will not eat nor
drink, till I have thine head upon that swords point; and again run at him.
But at the very instant, when these things were in agitation, came to the
place William Walworth Fishmonger, and then Lord Mayor of London (a man of an
invincible spirit and courage) who brought in his train many Knights, Esquires
and Gentlemen, to assist the King, who seeing this presumptuous outrage done,
in his spirit spoke aloud, and said; My Sovereign Liege, it were a shame
insufferable, and never till this time heard of, that this noble Knight your
loyal Subject, should be murdered before the face of his Sovereign; therefore
command this rebellious Captain to be arrested upon high and capital treason.
At whch words the King, though but of tender years, took manly boldness
upon, and commanded the Lord Mjaor to lay hands upon him, who with an
incomparable courage, without further pause or delay, arrested him with his
Mace, not on the shoulder, but the head, and that with such a sound Soldiers
armed with pikes look on as Sir William Walworth, Lord Mayor of London, strikes
Wat Tyler on the head with a ceremonial mace. Commoners, armed with pitchforks,
walk away. blow, that he struck him from his horse, and laid him grovelling on
the earth, much stounded and amazed, when suddenly dismounting, he stabbed him
with a short dagger (which he then wore) into the bosom, whom an Esquire of
the Kings, called John Cavendish seconded, and with his sword ran him into the
belly, after by others that stood by he received many wounds; which done, they
drew his dead and mangled body out of the press, and laid it in the Hospital
of St. Bartholomewes. This when the Commons had notice of, for it was publicly
done, and not in a corner, they made a loud exclamation, that their Captain
was treacherously murdered, encouraging one another speedily to revenge his
death, bending their bows, and managing such weapons as they had about them to
that purpose. At which the King rode unto them in person, and said; What mean
you, my dear and loving Subjects, will you shoot at your King? be not mutinous
about the death of a Rebel and Traitor, I will be your Sovereign, and will
be your Captain and Leader; follow me then, and you shall receive at my hands
are-dresse of all your grievances, even to your own hearts desire. And this
the King was counseled to do, lest these seditious Rascals should set fire on
the houses in Smithfield, and other parts of the Suburbs, being at that time in
great fury for the death of their Captain. The presence of the Kings Majesty
somewhat abated their rage, they therefore followed him into the open field;
the Soldiers that were then about his Highness, not knowing whether they
would quietly depart the place with their Charter, or lay violent hands upon
his sacred person.

In this Interim the Lord Mayor, for his last noble and memorable enterprise,
worthy to be eternized, to second his former pecce of service, sped him
instantly into the City, and cried out aloud; You good and faithful Citizens,
arm your selves with all speed possible, and help to assist your King and
Sovereign, who is in grear peril to be slain; and aid me your Major and
Governor who am in the danger, or if you will not suffer me, yet leave not his
select Majesty destitute.

Which when the well-minded Cityzens heard in whose loyal breast the love of
their King was engraven, they presently to the number of a thousand armed
themselves, and staid in the streets attending for some Captain to order them,
and lead them toward the King, at which instant came to them a noble Knight
and a Soldier, who was also a freeman of the City: him they entreated to take
upon him that charge, to which he willingly and most cheerfully assented, the
greatest part of them were under his conduct, the rest were commanded by the
Lord Major, one Preducus Dalbret, and some other Knight in the story not named.
These with this aid presented themselves before the King, who greatly
rejoicing in the faith and loyalty of his armed Citizens, presently with these
fresh forces compassed the Rebels about.

Now there appeared (by Gods wonderful goodness) a sudden and unexpected
alteration, for the seditious Commons who but some few minutes before stood
upon such peremptory and proud terms with the King himself, finding
themselves thus environed, flung down their weapons at once, and with a loud
unanimous voice cried pardon, pardon; such as could escape out of the Ring
fled, and hid themselves, some in Cellers, others in the Corn fields, Woods
and Ditches, etc. They being now at the Kings mercy, the Lords and the rest
about desirous to take some vengeance of their former insolency, besought his
Majesty that for example sake he would command some hundred or two of their
heads to be strunk off, to whose request he would no way condescend, but gave
order that their Charter which was sealed should be delivered unto them, which
was to prevent a new Insurrection, as knowing, that Essex was not yet
altogether pacified nor Kent quieted. The Commons having gotten their Charter,
and much taken with the Kings extraordinary and unexpected mercy, they left
both City and Suburbs, and departed homeward; when the King calling the Lord
Major before him he Knighted him in the Field, as he had most worthily
deserved: The like he did to Nicholas Brember, John Philpot, Robert Lawnd, John
Standish, Nicholas Twisord, and Adam Frances Aldermen, and after entered the
City in great state, where he was joyfully received from thence, he went to
visit his Mother, who was at that time lodged in the Tower Royal, in a part
thereof called the Queens Wardrope, where she had remained for the space of
two days and two nights, the time of this combustion, much bewayling and
lamenting her Sons imminent danger, whom when she saw to return safe she was
greatly comforted, and with tears of joy said: O my dear Son, what sorrows
have I suffered for you even to this hour? who answered again, Certainly
Madam, I knew it well but now rejoice, and praise God with me, for I have this
day recovered mine Heritage, and the Realm of England, which I had almost lost:
Then he gave present Commandments, that the Archbishops head should be taken
from off the Bridge, and Wat Tylers to be set in the place.

His Majesty further in remembrance of this joyful day, and for the Cities
greater honor, who next under God were his sole deliverers granted, that in
regard that worthy William Walworth the Lord Major had stain that dangerous
Rebel with a Dagger, a bloody Dagger should therefore be added unto the Arms
of the City, and to be placed in the right quarter of the Escutchion as an
addition to the Arms, and to celebrate the memory of a Lord Majors valiant
act, for before that time the City bore only a Cross without a Dagger.

And where it has bin vulgarly bruted, that the Rebel whom Sir William
Walworth flew was not Wat Tyler, but Jack Straw, that doubt is thus easily
reconciled; for Jack Straw was not taken till after the death of Wat Tyler,
being then apprehended with diverse others the chief of that horrible sedition,
who being brought into the Guild Hall where the Lord Major sat in Judgment,
having pronounced the Sentence of death upon them; he openly spoke to Jack
Straw as follows:

John behold thy Sentence is past, and thine unavoidable death at hand, for
thou have not many hours to live; wherefore I entreat thee, since there is no
way to save thy body, that for thy souls health thou will now without
extenuating thy grievous fault which is inexcusable* that thou betwixt God and
thy Conscience resolve this Honorable Bench, what the utmost of your purpose
was, and to what end you so mutinously assembled the Commons: who making a sad
pause to this demand, The Lord Major again thus seconded it; I speak to thee
as to a dying man, who now ought to study for the peace of thy soul, and not
dissemble at all either with God, or man: at which words recollecting his
spirits, he returned this answer following:

Now I confess in vain it booteth me not either to lie, or make any delatory
or evasive excuse, understanding that if I should so do, I might endanger my
soul unto the greater torments; and besides, I hope to obtain two benefits by
speaki^g truth: First, that I thereby may somewhat benefit the Commonweal in
the future* and next according to your promises, I hope to be assisted by your
prayers, that God would be merciful unto my soul. And therefore thus I
deliver unto you my conscience faithfully, and without deceit.

Being assembled upon black Heath, at that time when we sent for the King to
come unto us, our resolution was, to have slain all the Nobles, Knights, and
Esquires about him, and to have taken him into our own custody, to the intent
that the people might have repaired unto us with more boldness, and less
fear; since we would have made them to believe, that whatsoever we did was by
his Majesty's Authority: And next when we had got such power that we needed not
to be afraid of any other forces which might be raised in the Kingdom, our
purpose was then to have slain all such of the Nobility, as might either have
given Counsel, or made any resistance against us. But more in particular, we
would have massacred all the Knights of the Rhodes, and St. John's Knights, or
burned their houses over their ears: And lastly, we would have slain the King
himself, and all Gentlemen of any revenue throughout the Kingdom, with all
Archbishops, Bishops, Abbots, Priors, Monks, Canons, and Parsons of Churches,
reserving only some few Mendicants or begging Friars, they being sufficiently
able for saying Mass, and the administration of the Sacraments.

And having made a clear riddance of all those unnecessary Members of the
Commonweal (for so at that time it pleased us to call them) we would have
abrogated the old Laws, and devised new according to our own fancies; by which
the whole Realm should be governed, for we had determined to have divided the
Kingdom, and to have made Kings amongst our selves, as Wat Tyler in Kent, my
self in Essex, and others in other places: but by reason that these our
designs were prevented by the Archbishop of Canterbury, who dissuaded the
King from coming amongst us, we vowed by all means to insidiate his life, and
to dispatch him out of the way, which we did after: And further, the self same
evening that Wat Tyler was slain in Smithfield, we resolutely determined,
(having the greatest part of the Commons of the City bent to assist us in the
Act) to set fire in four several parts of the same at once, and to have
divided the spoil amongst us: and this says he, was our resolved purpose, and
concluded on by all, as God may help me now at my last end. After this
Confession made, he with many others of his late faction, were lead unto the
place of Execution, whose heads being struck off, his was put upon a pole and
set upon the Bridge next unto Wat Tylers.

Here I might enter into a large discourse of the horridness of Rebellion; as
that of Ireland, whose distressed estate is very lamentable, whose rebellion
and outrages I hope will be considered, and they speedily (by the permission of
the Almighty) receive their just rewards. Rebellion can no way be better
illustrated then by the sad and lamentable effects expressed in the premises:
I will therefore conclude with that of the Prophet Samuel, Rebellion is as the
sin of Witchcraft, and Transgression is wickedness and Idolatry.

The Ghost of Jack Straw.
I That did Act on Smithfields bloody stage,
In second Richards young and tender age;
And there received from Walworths fatal hand
The stab of death, which life did countermand;
And made an equal to the Tragedy
Of Leyden, a Dutch Tailors villainy:
Not that I ere consorted with that slave,
My Rascal rout you in this Story have:
But that in name and nature we agree,
An English Tailor I, Dutch Rebel he;
In my Consort, I had the Priest John Ball,
Mynter the Clerk, unto his share did fall.
He, to have all things common did intend,
And my Rebellion was to such an end:
Even in a word, we both were like appointed*
To take away the sword from Gods Anointed;
And for examples to the Worlds last day,
Our Traitors name shall never wear away;
The fearful paths that he and I have trod,
Have bin accursed in the sight of God.
Here in this Register, who ere does look
(Which may be rightly called The Bloody Book)
Shall see how base and rude these villains be,
That do attempt like Leyden, plot like me:
And now the Devil in whose name they are gone,
Pays them Hells wages, when their work is done;
Treason is bloody, blood thereon attends,
Traitors are bloody, and have bloody ends.
Meaning the Irish Rebels.
To you, my brother Rebels in like kind,
That do usurp authority, you will find
The same reward which we shall feel too soon,
A horrid Conscience at the day of Doom:
Which to avoid let this my Ghost entreat,
Yes love your King, fear Heavens Tribunal Seat;
So shall your souls without disturbance rest,
Till Christ shall come to make you fully blessed.
FINIS.
