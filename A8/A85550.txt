TRUTHS DEFENDER, AND ERRORS REPROVER: OR A Brief Discovery of feined
Presbytery dilated and unfolded in 3. distinct Chapters. The first, showing
what English Presbytery is. The second declares what the failings and errings
are, in the practice of those that have constitution by Ordinance of
Parliament. The Third Chapter discovers the conceited fancies, of such as
mind not Parliamentary directions, either for their constitution or execution
and yet denominate themselves Presbyterians.
And both Parties being found guilty of transgression, are admonished to
repentance, according to the rule of the word of the Lord, that commands his
servants, saying, Thou shall in any wise rebuke thy Neighbor, and not suffer
sin upon him, or as it is in the Margent, Or thou bear not sin for him

TO THE Right Honorable JOHN BRADSHAW LORD PRESIDENT of the COUNSEL of the
STATE of ENGLAND.
MEeting of late (my Lord) with some strange undertakers in point of
Church-Governement, who thought they had done well, and yet missed at a great
distance the marks both divin and humane, not only in that which concerned
their impowerment, but also their direction for government, and finding my
Brethren injuriously dealt withal, and over-mastered by more then ordinary
insultation, I could do no less there and then, but defend them by my advice
and counsel, which did so seasonably relieve and refresh them, as that they
earnestly desired, that I would send them the like in writing, for their better
satisfaction, and vesoluton in future times, whose Christian importunity, has
so prevailed with my weak ability, as that I have made a brief, yet a true
discovery of fained Presbytery: And notwithstanding your Lordship, has
formerly taken notice, of the contents of the two first Chapters, yet that
experience I have had of your ready ear for hearing, and soundness of
judgment in knowing, makes me bold to acquaint your honor with the whole
discovery, and therein especially with the contents of the third Chapter, in
which are such strange and new things, as I presume your Lordship never read the
like, and I humbly beseech, that my boldness may find pardon of your
goodness, and amongst your great Offerings let this mite of mine receive
acceptance from him whom the Lord has made his servant and yours, to serve him
the great God of Heaven and earth, and your Lordship in a higher employment.

My Lord, no sooner had I thought thus to conclude this short Epistle: but
presently was given me a gross delusion of Captain Norwoods asserted under his
own hand. And wondering that such an impudent falsehood should put on a face of
confidence and boldness, I thought it my duty to the Commonwealth in a few
words, to break his bands of ^ruths restraint asunder, as Sampson arose, and
cast away the Strumpets intanglements: And because I have declared before
against these approbrious injuries offered to the mystery of godliness,
touching our Lords personal death and resurrection, I thought good to add
them, and this to the aforesaid discovery, commending all to your Honors
meditations, Who am always ready to serve you,

John Grant.

A Discovery of fained PRESBITERIE.
FIrst, Presbytery is that regulate way of a religious Christian profession,
that is declared by the Parliament. And Secondly, feigned Presbytery is
something denominated like it, being taken up at the pleasure and will of
diverse Christians, carrying on thereby an arbitrary way of bondage and
slaverie toward their weak Brethren, who give themselves up to the will and
pleasure of such as err, not knowing the Scriptures, notwithstanding their
pretense of Church Government.

The first Chapter, showing what English Presbytery is.
FOr the first sort of Presbytery, it is such as Authority instituted in anno
1645. 1646. and 1647. by the power and virtue of diverse Ordinances of
Parliament: And first, we must take notice of such rules and directions, as do
enable each Parish, to make choice of Elders, and that is when a County or
Country is made a Province by Authority of Parliament, that Province divided by
them into Classis, in which Classis respectively there are nominated Ministers
and others to be Judges and Triers, who are authorized to try and examine the
elected Elders, which the Parishes in the said Classis shall present unto them,
under the hands of the Minister and Churchwardens, and within 14 days after
Election, to hear the exceptions against them, made and exhibited by any
Parishioner or others, in matters of ignorance or scandal committed within 12.
months before, according to the descriptions of both enumerated in Ordinance
of Parliament, October 20. 1645. and as the Triers shall judge, either to
approve, or disapprove, the said Elective Elders, and when the convenient
number, more or less, chosen by the Parishioners, be approved of, then and not
before, are they in capacity to act, that is to meet once a week or oftener;
and the Congregationall Eldership, consisting of Minister and Elders, or the
major part of them are empowered to summon before them, the Parishioners or any
part of them, to examination in matters of ignorance and scandal, according to
the particular heads, of each enumerated, in the Ordinance before mentioned,
and they are empowered further, to take an Oath of such witnesses, as shall
accuse the examined; and as the Eldership shall judge, to admit, and suspend
them from the Lord's Supper, and further it is ordained, that of the
Congregationall Elderships, are made and constituted all other degrees of
Presbyterian government, for by one Minister at the least, and two ruling
Elders, sent from each Congregation, is made and constituted the Classical
Elderships, who are to meet once a month, and by two Ministers, and four
Elders sent from each Classis, is made and constituted the Provincial-Assembly,
who are ordered to meet twice a year, and so by the like sent from the
Provincial, is the National Assembly made and constituted, who are always to
attend the High Court of Parliament. And it is also provided, that for the
relief and righting of such as shall think themselves wronged in the
Congregationall Elderships, that such shall have liberty to appeal from them
to the Classis, from the Classis, to the Provincial, from the Provincial, to
the National, and from them to the Parliament, if right may not be had
otherwise: And further, each Classis being constituted, they are also empowered
for examination and ordination of Ministers.

The second Chapter shows the errors and failings of this first, which is the
best sort of Englsh Presbitery.
FOr although this way and order was first ordained for the good and bettering
of Christian Congregrations, yet woeful experience has proved it to be very
prejudicious and injurious, through the ignorance of some, and malice of
others, against the straight way of the Lord, and the Children thereof, for
whereas the Elderships ought to have proceeded according to the rule, for the
increase of grace, love and knowledge, and the maintenance of peace and amity,
for the flourishing of true and pure religion, instead thereof, they have acted
by their own corrupt minds and wills, and vented their hatred and spleen, and
have prevented truth, and promomoted falsehood, and where there was quiet and
peace before, they have now raised up discord and dissension, and instead of
denying themselves, and bearing with, and edifying one another, they have
destroyed and devoured each other, witness the third Classis of London, and
the assemby of Syon-Colledge, which Committee as they call themselves, did
declare in print to all the world, that this forementioned government was the
will and appointment of Jesus Christ, and avouched it to be jure divino, and of
themselves made additionall Orders, without notice to, or leave given them by
the Parliament: That all Elected Elders of every Parish, should have their
names very fairly written, and set upon the Church door, desiring any
whomsoever, that could make exception against any three mentioned they should be
heard, at such a time and place, where the Triers would sit and receive all
such accusations, they observing no rule or directions therein, provided by the
Ordinance of Parliament, neither for the time limited, nor the particulars
enumerated, nor the competetency or number of witnesses required, whereby
illimited Jurisdictions, innovations, and arbitrary proceedings may be avoided,
and as this lawless Committee then, and the Triers afterward declared their
own wills, so they all acted as corruptly; for I knew a man then chosen an
Elder in one of the parishes of the third Classis, whose election was with the
greatest freedom and affection of the Parishioners, as any that has been
chosen, the man being ancient in the Congregation, and had gone through most
Offices amongst them, and it so fell out at the same time, there was another
younger, yet a richer Parishioner, chosen also, that was one of the Triers
nominated in the Ordinance, who causelessly, diverse times before had declared
himself an opposer, of the former, and in the Vestry he affirmed, the Party
they had chosen should never be allowed of, and presently used all his
endeavor, to find cause of exception, in such a malicious and inveterate
manner, as the whole Parish took notice of it, so that at the next Vestry,
some of them blamed him, that the State having appointed him a Judge, he should
so maliciously make himself the Accuser, the Prosecutor, the Condemner, and
Executioner and all: To whom he made this answer again, he whom you have
chosen shall never be allowed of, and I will never give him the right hand of
Fellowship, nor be reconciled unto him; upon his thus speaking, the opposed
Elder desired the Parish to take notice of two things, in his implacable
adversary; First, That he sets up his own will, above the Ordinances of
Parliament, which gives you power to choose your own Elders, and leaves it not
to his perverse will and pleasure, and again he supersedes all the rest of the
Triers and Judges, for the Ordinance refers the Trial and approbation to nine
men, or any fix of them. And Secondly, he exalts himself above God, and his
Ordinances, in saying peremptorily again and again, I will never be
reconciled; for Gods word commands, and his servants beseech the contrary;
wherefore I pray (said he) observe what an unworthy Elder, and Judge you have
chosen to govern you, for his opposition is not so much against me, as against
you all, for your yea, is his nay, and you claim a Public interest in me,
but he denies it you, from the which to be excused, tends to my particular ease
and freedom; and truly, as this his beginning was vile and corrupt, so his
prosecution abundantly exceeded in hatred and malice, for in all have, he
caused diverse exceptions to be drawn up against him, which he pretended to be
scandalous, both in practice and Judgment, and upon summons, the accused
appeared, and after their Clerk had read the exceptions, he required a Copy of
them, which being denied by the Prolocutor, (which afterward through much
importunity was obtained) he then presently disclaimed and disavowed so many
of them as tended to practice, and that most of them were false in many
respects, and requiring them to proceed, by the rule limited to a year before,
for the time, the enumeration in the Ordinance for the particular matters, and
two honest Christians at least for evidence? do you tell us of the rule we
should walk by (say they) we would have you know we are not tied to the letter
of the rule, but the meaning of it, is left to our judgments: I hear you, said
he, but I never heard before of a mystical humane Law, and I tell you all
plainly, that if you wave the letter of the Ordinance of Parliament, which is
your direction to try me by, then I would have you know, I have as much power
to try you all, as you all have to try me; and added that he was sorry to
find them so unlimited and arbitrary in their proceedings; and because the
exceptions in practice were vain and frivolous, and no way ordered by the
Ordinance, I will not now mention them, but refer them to another day of
hearing, and proceed to give you a Breviate of the Exceptions touching
scandalous judgment: The first was that he had affirmed, That the first day of
the week was not commanded in Gods word to be a Sabbath. He answered, I have
so affirmed, and if it be an error so to say, then show me it commanded in the
word of God, to which they did not reply, but proceeded and said, it was
further objected against him, that he denied the morality of the Sabbath. He
said, before I can properly and clearly answer you, I must ask you a
question, what you mean by Sabbath, whether the sign or the thing signified?
And also what you mean by morality, because, I do not find the term in our
English tongue, used in the Scripture? The Prolocutor or Moderator, being at a
pause, I answered, I affirm that the command of the seventh day, extended not
to the Christian Gentiles, and I think you are all of my mind, or else you
would observe, and not profane it as you do.

Secondly, I do hold that which the seventh days rest did signify, does
remain and continue to the end of the world, and in some respects forever
also, and pulling out a Bible out of my pocket, read part the of third and
fourth Chapters of the Hebrews, and opened to them those Scriptures, that speak
of the Sabbath, or rest of God, before mentioned, also by the Prophets David
and Isaiah, saying, To day if you will hear his voice, harden not your hearts,
least you enter not into his rest, etc. And again, We that have believed,
have entered into his rest, and have ceased from our works, as God did from
his, proving to them by the Scriptures, that the rest that remained unto the
people of God, was a spiritual rest, and not a corporal, and you that are
Ministers here, said he, know well enough, that it is concluded in the harmony
of all Christian Churches, their confessions, that the command for sanctifying
the first day of the week, is an Ordinance of the Church, but they being weary
of his exposition and exhortation, they replied little, and less to the
purpose, but proceeded to further exceptions, and said, that he was accused for
affirming, that divine examples, do not always bind the conscience of a
Christian, to which he answerered, that in saying so, he said no more, then
what themselves justified, for said he, there is a divine example, that the
baptizer and the baptized, descended personally into the water together, and
you baptizers follow not this holy example; they replied, it was not the
custom of this Country: Behold said he, your hands and your tongue, and all
that you do, is against you, to justify that to be lawful in your selves,
which very thing, you accuse in me for a scandalous exception; These and such
like, they debated some three or four hours, but I will not tell you for
shame, how shamefully they parted from my Friend, least you should be ashamed
to hear it: But to put a face upon the business, they summoned him twice or
thrice afterward, to make him wait, but they durst not dispute, and he finding
their delays, were to the Parishes prejudice, in their right, and for their
satisfaction, he made the case known to that worthy, and now Right Honorable
Counselor, whose place is too high to declare his name, in so low a
discovery as this; yet I cannot do less, then tell you his judgment was,
that the Triers had much wronged the accused, in not bringing his accusers,
face to face, according to Ordinance of Parliament, in such cases provided, and
commanded him to tell them so from him, which Message he delivered to them, the
next time they sat; which when they heard, they told him they did not believe
him, whereupon he required them as they had power to take an Oath, so they would
give him his Oath to confirm the truth of it, and when they would not,
required what answer he should return to him that sent him, they said, that
they could not approve of him to be an Elder, he desired their reasons, and
their hands for his removing, that the Parish might choose another, all which
they unworthily denied him, notwithstanding the Ordinance required them.

If such gross injuries as these, through selfishnesse and carnalitie, have
been done by the best and choicest Presbyters, by the Judgers and Triers, such
as were heedfully and consideratly appointed, by immediate Authority of
Parliament, and if it be so with the best, what can we expect from the choice
of the multitude, both Parochial and Classical, of which if I had but time to
tell you, would make both your ears to tingle, to hear what ignorance,
contradictions, nonsense and impentenency they are guilty of, besides their
Pride, vain glory and hypocrisy: yet a hint of it you shall have in the
Chapter following. The second sort of English Presbyters, are such as take upon
them the name of the former, and are in some practices like them, but wholly
without institution by Authority of Parliament, who in their practice heed not,
but are opposers both of the Law of God and Man. therefore



The third Chapter discovers the conceited fancies of such as have no
authority for their practice, but their own inventions.
FIrst, for the constitution of their Church Officers, they mind not the
Ordinances before mentioned, thereby to be made capeable for election, nor to
be empowered being elected, and allowed, but according to their own
inventions, go on in the name of Presbyterians, and choose Elders and Deacons,
whereas the Parliament knew well, that the Office of Deacons was sufficiently
already provided for, by diverse Acts and Statutes under the name of
Churchwardens, and Overseers for the poor, and therefore have wholly left
out, that sort of Church Officers, in their Ordinances, thereby giving us a
clear evidence, that they never intended to destroy Parochial Congregations,
as these men unwarily do but to reedefie and repair them, by adding a
helpful, careful, and watchful Office of Elders, to those Officers that were
formerly, although they prove not as they were intended, and such as do thus
practice a Presbyterian way in the Parochial Congregations, not authorized as
aforesaid, it is so far from being beneficial, as that it will prove wholly
prejudicial, and it tends more to a Teaching sense of the supreme Judicature
of this Commonwealth, then of obedience, Of selfishnesse in judgment, then of
sincerity of Engagement, for if such as were ordained prove not to the purpose,
what can we expected of them that ordain themselves? and if those fail that
are regulated, what can we look for from such, whose rule is their will? how
helpless are the people that submit to them, that are not provided for to
appeal from them, to free them from the wrongs they shall do them? what
defense shall a Christian have from amongst them, for speaking the truth in
reproof of their false Doctrine, you may judge what they will do with you
hereafter, by what they do, and have done heretofore; have they chosen
themselves? have they set up themselves above their Brethren? what good fruit
can you expect from such evil Plants? and the choice they made was so strange
and new, that as there is no example to Parallel it, so there is scarce a
dialect to express it, without smiling at it; that such an unanimous people,
such a great corporation, and constant communicants, so that I know not a more
fuller, or willing Congregation in this Commonwealth, for frequenting Gods
public Ordinances, for these to be denied the Lords Supper, for five years
together by the same Teacher, that all on a sudden, through imposing a new
fancy of his own devising, neither warranted by the Law of God or man, but
destructive to both, yet all that now would follow, and dance after his pipe,
should be admitted to that he had so long time detained, and yet now also
publicly declared that all that would not ob^y his humane invention should
not presume to come to the communion, and thus he conceived and brought forth
vanity, for being in the pulpit, desiring the people to meet him next morning
in the Church, and some fourscore of many hundreds appearing to him, he then
taught them a necessity of believing his humane conceiving, to be sound
doctrine and then and there, to choose a Minister, and Church Officers of their
own devising. And the first question he asked them, was, who they would choose
for their Minister, and with one voice they chose himself, a fair Election to
choose one out of one, and he being chosen in such an unwarantable manner as
this, and accepting thereof he told them that as they had made choice of their
Minister, so now they must proceed to choose other Church Officers, and for my
Assistant, I choose Mr. Mayor said he, and Mr Mayor presently chose for his
Assistant, an Alderman, then the Alderman chose A. and A. chose B. and B. chose
C. and C. chose D. and so one chose another, till eight Elders were chosen to
the Minister, or rather chose themselves, and then by their Teachers direction,
the last Elder chose the first Deacon, and so from the first, one chose
another, till there was as many Deacons begat as there were Elders, and
Officers multiplying so fast, from so small a number assembled, they presently
took Counsel together, how to Officiate, and so at that instant, appointed
two week days, before the next Lords day, to give attendance to examine
Communicants, and some did come and were admitted, but others who better knew
the difference between will worship, and true worship, forbore, and heard
themselves forbidden that, by man, which Gods word did allow them: Now in this
respect, those you have for so long time heretofore condemned, shall rise up in
judgment against you, and be justified in comparison of you, for as they wave
the rules of Authority, and in that are blameable, as you are, yet they do it
without doors, and not within, they leave all quiet at home, from whence they
go, whatsoever they do abroad where they are, but you befoul your own nest,
set fire of your own house, cause divisions and dissentions in your own
Congregation, that before was quiet, so that nothing can be expected from you,
by your own doings, but confusion and destruction; wherefore I advise my
Friends that are free, not to meddle with such as are subject to change. And
these things being so, for my Brethrens cause I must speak, and for the truths
sake, I cannot keep silent; my Brethren are captivated and inslaved, and the
truth is withheld in unrighteousness, by such as exalt themselves above all
authority, that is, all that are called God, for as their Discipline, as they
call it, is warrantlesse both for matter and frame, so are their doctrines,
which forces me by way of discovery, thus to dissect and anatomize the whole
body, or rather a Monster of this fained Presbytery. Not long since it is that
I heard this Minister on Mich. 4. 3. in these words, And they shall breakr
their swords into ploug-sheares, and their spears into pruning-hoocks.
Affirming the Prophet in these words, prophesied of the Churches state and
condition under the Gospel, before the Lords coming or general resurrection,
on whom should be poured forth such great gifts of the Spirit, that they should
in converting men unto God, turn their finnes into graces, and their
wickednesses into rightousnes O strange ignorant unheard of expression! not
only contrary to divine, but natural principles, how will this Teacher prove,
that that evil must be turned to good, which God commands to be cast away,
broken off, killed, and forgotten, a thing so contsary to grace, that the
fountain thereof washes it away,, from the truly converted, the Minister
endeavored to prove this doctirne by a Parallel Scripture where Wolve are
turned into Lambs, and smarling dogs into harmless sheep, as he said,
alluding to Isaiah 11. 6. The Wolf shall dwell with the Lamb, and the Leopard
shall lie down with the Ktd, etc. Now the Gentleman is not alone in this last
Exposition, for many others besides him, have declared the same mistake,
neither is this last Scripture parallel to the first, for this last proves evil
creatures shall be made good, but not as you expound the first, that
wickedness shall be converted and turned into goodness: Sir, I dare not use
my strength, now I have you at an advantage, through your own weakness, but
for your further information, I affirm, that neither of these places are
figurative, but both litterall expressions, and teach not the doctrine of man's
conversion, but the whole Creations restitution, holding forth the state of
perfection, and not that of regeneration, according to Romans 8. that when he
sons of God shall be revealed or manifested, then also shall the whole
Creation in the Apostles meaning, participate according to their ability and
capacity, in the glorious liberty of the Inheritours of salvation. And I
further affirm, that the Elect of God are never called in the Scripture Dogs
and Swine, as the Reprobates are, because the truly sanctified 2 Pet. 2. 22.
never return to their loathsome vomit again, nor the purely washed, to
wallow again in their filthy mire, nor after putting their hand to the plough,
to turn back, nor never shall tread the blood of the holy Covenant under their
feet, after they are thoroughly sanctified thereby, nor sin willingly, in
hating and despising the blessing after the true knowledge of it, and in this
respect only, it cannot be said of the Saints, as of the wicked, but such were
some of ye, although in other respects it may be so said.

Now my conclusion shall be an exhortation to repentance, for when we have
done, that we should not have done, the next way we are to take is to repent of
it, therefore see how you have transgressed the rule, which says, Give unto
God the things that are Gods, and unto Caesar the things which are Cesars; that
is, to the supreme power, whether it be in one or many, the things that
pertain to them, now both the Lawgivers require submission to their
directions, that so there may be quiet and order in the Commonwealth, without
which you are not true thereunto, and so walk not according to your engagement,
and for you to raise up a select Congregation out of an authorized or legal
one, it tends rather to strife and dissension, then peace and unity, and
thereby as much as is in your power, deny that to Caesar which belongs to him,
and in so doing you deny God his due also who commands obedience to every
ordinance of man for his sake, and for your conscience sake also. And for
as much as you are all before named, faulty in one respect or other, I admonish
you all to repent, and advise you to look higher, then these outward external
administrations, which are common as well to outward Christians, as to those
that are inward, and labor for that holy-eye-salve, which will enable you to
see and discern those spiritual high and heavenly administrations, that none
but the Elect, called* and sanctified, can understand or participate in such
peculiar treasures, and privileges, that the world can neither give nor take
away, which will make us Christians indeed, and Members of the Church of Christ
indeed, and true worshippers of God indeed, and to be approved (though not of
wicked men, yet) of God, in whom I am

Yours to be commanded in defense of the Truth. J. G.

Captain NOR WOODS Declaration, proved an abhegation of the truth of Christ's
incarnation, discovering thereby those strong Satanical delusions, to which he
is given up, even to the belief of lies, in opposing the Author of salvation
the Doctrine of regeneration, the hope of the second and better resurrection,
and the glorious and endless reward in the world to come.
ANd because we are to deal with the old Nicholitan Doctrines which always
has been and now are the Depths of Satan, we must first premise such Tenets
of his, which are plainly avowed, or else from what he has written,
necessarily or absolutely concluded, remembering also that he will yield to all
manner of Scripture readings, although never heeding their proper and distinct
meanings, and I marvel to find this Declaration in Scripture expression, for
as much as he and his have most wickedly affirmed, that the Scriptures the Old
and New Testament is Ante-Christ, even that Scarlet clothed whore, which has
made the Nations drunk with the wine of her fornications, now you shall find
this abominable boldness accompanied with miserable ignorance, of the faith
the just do live by, in that he knows not what the hope of true believers is
they stand by.

For page 5. and the last line, he is as corrupt in his expressions, as he is
in his delusions, for the Apostle does not speak in his language of the Saints
bodies in the resurrection of the just to call them earthly, and beastiall,
like the beastly Spirit he is lead by, but being guided by the holy Spirit of
truth, calls them incorruptible, immortal, spiritual bodies etc. 1 Cor. 15.
and proves plainly that the resurrection of the body (that which the Captain
denies) to be an unquestionable truth, by the common and daily experience of
the sowing and growing of seed, verse. 37, 38. thou sowest some bare grain of
wheat or other (which is not quickened except it dye) but every seed comes up
with its own body, not bare, as it was sown, but glorious or clothed upon,
so also is the resurrection of the dead, says he, meaning man, its sown in
corruption, it is raised in incorruption, it is in dishonor when it is sown,
but it is glorious when it is raised, verse 43, 44. A more cleerer and fuller
manifestation of this I made to Mr Royle in my defense following, in the 5, 6,
7, and 8. pages of Lamp of light, as also in my first answer to him, The Cure
of deadly Doctrine, page 4, 5.

Furthermore as Capt. Norwood does in his Confession of Faith, page 1. in words
acknowledge the divine nature of the second Person in the Trinity, as giving to
him the name and title of infinite power and wisdom in Creation, according to
that which is written, By it all things were made, and without it, was made
nothing that was made: so far his expression is true, what ever his meaning be
of the divine nature, but whereas he further says, which is also called Christ
the first borne, or only begotten of the Father, or the anointed, these titles
or appellations cannot relate to his divine nature alone, but his humane, as
the name Jesus or Christ was given to his person, when he was circumcised, his
proper name by which he was known from other men So the Prophet David in Psalm.
89. 27. applies the appellation of the first borne, to Christ's humane nature;
as a King in his glorious Kingdom (and yet not divided from his divine) I will
make him my first borne higher then the Kings of the earth, pointing to the
time when he shall take unto himself his great power and personal reign:
Agreeing with another expression of his, in the Psalm. 2. 6. I have set my King
upon my holy hill of Zion; that is, Christ personally and not mystically, and
by this name he calls his Church and Kingdom, also Ephraim (says the Lord by
Jeremiah the Prophet) is my first borne, Jer. 31. 9. Likewise the Capt. applies
the term only begotten of the Father to the divine, which most properly is
applyable to Christ's human nature, his incarnation, and so do the Prophets and
Apostles speak Psalm. 2. This day have I begotten thee, God the Father speaking
to God the Son, in and by David, and so the Apostles testifying to Christ's
incarnation, death and resurection, Acts 13. 30. they prove it by the same
Prophetical words, foreteling of Christ's coming in the flesh, Thou art my
Son, this day have I begotten thee, and they add for further proof of Christ's
humanity, verse. 35. wherefore he says also in an other Psalm, Thou shall not
suffer thy holy one to see corruption, Psalm. 16. which words point plainly to
Christ's body in the Sepulcher, and in proof hereof the Author to the Hebrews
is beyond all exception, for in this respect only of the personal suffering of
death, he was made a little lower then the Angels, who as touching his divine
nature, he was above them, but in regard of his humanity in suffering
inferior, now see (most ignoble Captain) how your opposition exceeds the
cursed Jews crucifixion, for they did but kill that body of his which through
the power of God was raised the third day, but you utterly destroy, deny, and
annihilat that body, and roared it out daily to your deluded Disciples, that
Jesus Christ is a quallitie, and no way to be conceived or understood
personally for that you make an Allegory.

Observe further, that whereas this Captain unwarily has joynd these terms
annoynting and anointed together, thereby as he says to declare the second
glory or manifestation of one Unity in the Trinity, and yet plainly
abnegating and denying the humane nature of Christ, how the infiniteness of
unction, in any true consideration can be said to be anointed within it self,
implies finitenesse, and for as much as the finite anointed is inferior to
the fullness of anointing being infinite, I know not how he will clear his
own words from obsurditie, but in this gross mistak he concurreth with his
Friend Mr. Royle, which makes the letter of the Scriptures, that speak of
Christ's humane nature, to be but figurative expressions, and fulfild in every
one of them by several removes and degrees of dispensations, as you may see
more clearly opened in the 4. and 8. pages in the Lamp of Light following.
Again, the Capt. in page the second has these words, the same Christ I
steadfastly believe to be my only and alone right, and life, and salvation, and
so much, and so far as I have attained him or it, or rather he or it is risen
up or brought forth it or himself in me, so far I judge my self to live or
be alive, or saved,, or to have attaind salvation, etc. under which plausible
words of his, lies abundance of corruption and rottenness, for he intends by
the Party spoken of, not only himself, but every man also, and by him or it
the light or life before mentioned, which he says is inherently in all
mankind, as the soul in the body, and when he that is his fancied Christ
Jesus, is manifested and revealed or raised, then is this salvation
accomplished, the resurrection at the last day finished, and the world to come
possessed, and all what glory soever the Scriptures speak of, or the Saints
of God hope for, is now completed and perfecteded in men, in which insertion
is included many gross falsehoods and absurd contradictions of the truth of
God. First, That a man's happiness and salvation proceeds from something within
man, as he is man, and not from some one thing without him, and so becomes
happy, by himself, or by something of himself, which was borne with him, and
not by imputation of another righteousness from without him. And Secondly, he
overthrowes all future hopes whatsoever, and affirms there is no other
resurrection, glory, or happiness then what is enjoyed in men, in this cursed
world, in this vild and corruptible body, by which it plainly appears the man
is both ignorant and destitute of the lively faith, and assured hope of Gods
elect, for which there needs no greater proof against him then his own
confession, which wild and mad doctrine, is further discovered and condemed in
the Lamp and cure following.

Again, the Capt. seems to vaunt much of his knowledge of heaven and hell,
and says that there is no other of neither, but what is now in men's bodies, a
thing as strange as the rest, yet that he may be proved deluded, we must first
consider that the term heaven is variously taken, and has different meanings
in the Scripture: first in a strict, secondly in a more general sense; in a
strict sense, is sometimes meant the doctrine and beginning of the Kingdom of
Heaven sometimes the righteousness of the Kingdom, sometimes the Children of
the Kingdom, sometimes the glorious Kingdom it self altogether considered,
sometimes the contenent and place of this Kingdoms perfection. And secondly,
in a more general sense, the profession of the doctrine, and place of the
Kingdoms regeneration, now as I formerly told your Brother Royle, in Cure of
deadly doctrine, page 4. that the truth of terms is the preservation of
proprieties, which here now I shall more clearly open to you; And Sir, I pray
take notice, for you to speak indefinitely, as you have done of a term,
which admits of such different exceptions, in so doing you have spoken
altogether unprofitable, because in such cases, the definition shows the
meaning, not the term, so that in the rule of reason, no man can expect a
full answer to a doubtful assertion, yet that you may be answered we will
presume your intention that, by the term Heaven, you mean the place, and
everlasting glorious salvation of the Saints, now the Scripture shows the
place, in which they shall enjoy eternal salvation to be without them, I go to
prepare a place for you, (says their Lord) again I will prepare a place for my
people, and they shall be removed no more, now this holy place promised, is the
new heavens, and new earth, in which dwells righteousness, in which place
there shall be no evil nor sin, nor curse, nor death nor sorrowing, nor
crying, even such a place of holiness and perfection, as Adam enjoyed in his
innocence, which place was not contained within his body, but his body within
it, he personally had dominion over all the whole cr^^tion, and not all the
whole glorious creation contained within his person, but as it was without the
holy man in his innocence, so it shall be with Christ their King, and the whole
house of Jacob in their excellency in the world to come, whereof the Prophets
speak, in which all things; that is, all created things shall be subjected and
subdued under Christ's and his Saints feet, Heb. 2. and then also shall the
Kingdoms of this world, become the Kingdoms of our Lord and his Christ's, where
he and his Saints shall reign personally for ever and ever, and then all Kings
and Kings Subjects shall fear and fall down to him, for all Nations shall
serve and worship him.

Consider likewise how the Saints desired expectation is to be clothed upon
with their house that is from Heaven, which is such an extraordinary glory as
Moses and Elias was clothed with in the holy Mount, which were visible and
transparent beauties as well as internal: And in the morning of the Saints
awaking, at the general resurrection they shall shine (says the Prophet) as the
brightness of the Firmament, and as the Stars for ever and ever. and so says
our Savior and Emanuel, As truly God, so truly man, whom you despise and
scorn, thus understood and acknowledged, nevertheless at the end of this
world, when the time of separation shall be between the Children of the
Kingdom, and the Children of the wicked one, Then shall the righteous shine
forth as the Sun, in the Kingdom of their Father, and this is added, Who has
ears, let him hear, which hearing ear, your Declaration shows you have not,
as certainly as any thing you want in the world besides, and when these things
come to pass, as truly speedily they shall, then shall you be forced to
confess a Hell without you also, as well as a Hell within you, and condemned
with shame, and clothed with confusion, as with a mantle, when the undying
worm is spread under you, which shall also cover you; then shall you see him
and his, whom you now blaspheme and persecute, to be personally glorified, but
your self justly and everlastingly tormented and condemned except you repent:
in the mean while I leave it to all people, to whom these presents shall come,
to judge if you be not a lying deluded Prophet.

And as I fear not to undertake the Captain of my Lords enemies, although he
be an uncircumcised Goliath, and* a leader of the host of the huge Camp of the
Philistims, the Lords adversaries: so I fear not likewise to reprove all such
Ministers, of all denominations, that pretend to feed and lead the Lambs Army,
and to be Shepherds of Gods holy flock, and yet do let such Wolves as these,
to worrie and destroy the harmless sheep, and so smite the Shepherd, as to
kill and crucify him the second time, and this done, not in a corner but in
the sheepfold, before all their faces, and yet not one of you have had a word
to speak, for your pretended Master, nor his faithful Servants, I could tell
you where in London and Westminster, both publicly and privately, by men of
your own coat as you call them, as well as by others at York and Canterbury
and all over the Nation, of which the cure behind will tell you more, how
these corrupt, abominable and rotten doctrines have been plainly advanced and
put to sale, to the killing of the head of Christ's Church, and the poisoning of
the Members thereof, and yet not one of you all as I know of, have appeared in
the cause of truth against them; now how will you acquit your selves from that
woeful sentence, and lamentable reward of unprofitable Servants, without
repentance I cannot tell you, but I admonish you all to look about you, for
the hour of account and reckoning is very nere coming, of which says he that
is your Friend, Come Lord Jesus, come quickly.

J. G.

These two letters came to my hands after I had fully concluded the premises,
which in regard they concern the said Capt. and his blasphemy, are thought fit
to be here annexed.
SIR,
MY due respects presented unto you; whereas I understood by a friend of yours,
by accident, that you are now about or intend shortly to write, (and that
justly) against one Capt. Norwood, a notorious blasphemer in our age, I could
not choose but acquaint you with my thoughts upon this subject, viz. That
without controversy, 'twill be a very shame to the Rabbis of this time,
Presbyterians and Independents both, I mean, that pretend so highly on all
sides to the truth of their Master (as they say) and yet leave (like hirelings
as for the most they are) his truth and poor flock, to be torn, and rent by
ravenous wolves, and not once appear, or so much as open their mouths in
public, to speak a word in their behalf: Sir, the word long before declared
is now fulfilled, that grievous wolves should enter, etc. men speaking perverse
things, (...), etc. Lovers of pleasure rather then of God, etc. (...). Whose
God is their belly, whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things;
to their shame be it spoken; Sir I have herein sent you a Copy of a Letter
writ to a Scholar, Mr Simpson by name, by some surnamed of Holland, of whose
Congregation the said Capt. was sometimes one, and by him excommunicated, as
it is reported: the language for some reasons is lattin as you see, the effects
to delare some horrid blasphemies maintained by a Goldsmith (whose name I know
not) and the said Capt. Norwood: and in the conclusion a secret check to Mr.
Simpson, as (by his not preaching repentance) being occasion to the said
Captains Apostasy, after whom it is justly feared, many blind (their Leaders
being blind) will draw back and fall into perdition. Sir, I have no more to
say but this, that if the thing be true, then go on carefully and prosper, and
let this letter enclosed (if you think good) be added to your paper, and the
Printer will give you thanks, by which means this and the ensuing, and last
age, may better discern and reject the said Captains blasphemies which is the
chief thing herein desired by

London 10. June 1651. Your Friend, Philalethes.
