The Humble ADDRESS Of the Right Honorable the Lords Spiritual and Temporal In
PARLIAMENT Assembled.
Die Lunae 16. Decembris, 1695.
WE the Lords Spiritual and Temporal in Parliament Assembled, Having taken into
our Serious Consideration the great Mischief which is brought upon this Your
Kingdom, by reason that the Coin which Passes in Payments is generally
Clipped, and that no other Remedy is like to prove Effectual for Preventing the
Increase of this Evil, but to make Clipping Unprofitable for the future, Do
most Humbly Address to Your Majesty, to Issue out Your Royal Proclamation, That
from such Day or Days, as Your Majesty shall think fit, no Clipped Money, of
any Sort, shall Pass in any Payment, as the Current Coin of this Kingdom.

Matthew. Johnson, Cleric' Parliamentor'

His Majesty's most Gracious Answer to the Address.
THat according to the Lords Desire in their Address, His Majesty will Issue
out His Proclamation with what speed the Nature of the thing will Admit.

FINIS.
