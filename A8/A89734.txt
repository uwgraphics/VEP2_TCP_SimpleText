Commons. 1468.

THE PUBLISHER To the Courteous READER.
TO be tedious in Prefacing where the Work is so short, would be prejudicial
both to the Author that has studied, and the Reader that delights in brevity:
Yet because the world is grown to such a frame, that little (though never so
excellent) is now respected, if not commended, accept a word or two. The
subject cannot but please any who is cordially affected to approve himself to
God and the world, by walking in all godliness and honesty: To live, is the
desire of the creature; to live to sin, of a sensual and corrupt creature; to
live unto God, of a new creature: If Christ be in us we are new creatures, and
so shall daily be renewed in strength and grace, till we attain to that state
where old things shall utterly vanish. Among others, take this little Treatise,
attend to it, and in these giddy times, wherein poor souls seem to be bewitched
and led captive with the enticing words of Men's Doctrines, thou may have a
direction to lead thee toward thine end, the enjoyment of God.

Touching the Author, though he be far above my commendation, or the worlds
usual expectation; yet, lest the ignorance of him should prejudice his worth,
and so the benefit of his Labors, Honesty requires me to speak what Modesty
justly denies him to publish. Where he is he is eminent honorable among the
Worthies; yea (without injury to any) one of the chief. Whosoever reads this
(which is but a piece of him) let him, if he can, justly deny his abilities and
learning. If any fall out with his Opinion concerning Church Power, let him,
before he censure, read his Answer to Apollonius in Latin, and then if he be
not fully satisfied, let him censure on, or disprove it if he can, and let the
Author have his Plea to make it good, and then let the world judge who has the
best.

To trouble thee no farther, as there are diversities of subjects, so there are
diversities of gifts, that every one whose eye is to heaven, may have somewhat
spoken suitable to his own heart: It may be what satisfaction thou have missed
elsewhere, thou may receive here. Read thou, and God give thee understanding
in all things.

Farewell. J. W.

CHAP. I. Of the Sufficiency, and so of the Essence of GOD.
Q. WHat is Divinity?

Ans. The Doctrine of godliness, Romans 6.11.
or living to God.

Q. How many parts has it?

A. Two, Faith in God. Obedience unto God. Tit. 3 8.



Q. Concerning God what are we to know?

A. 1. That God is. Heb. 11.6. Deu 6.4. 1 Cor. 8.5, 6. Exodus 35.23.
2. That God is one. 3. What this one God is, as he has manifested himself to
us in his back-parts according to our measure. manner.



Q. From what other heads may arguments be drawn readily to prove that God is.

A. From the word of God. From the works of God. From the eminenter works of
his Spirit,
1. Supernatural upon the Creature, viz. Miracles: 2. Extraordinary upon
Hypocrites: 3. Special upon the Elect.


Q. What are his back-parts?

A. His Sufficiency. Efficiency.


Q. Wherein consists his Sufficiency?

A. In his Essence. Subsistence.


Q. What do you understand by the essence of God?

A. The essence of God absolutely considered, is that one pure and mere act by
which God is God.

Q. How may we further know what his essence is?

A. Because through weakness of our understanding, we cannot in any measure
apprehend it by one act; it has pleased God to give unto himself many Names
and Attributes, by the help of which we may the better conceive thereof.

Q. Which are those Names?

A.

Jehovah; Exodus 6.3.
signifying Gods being of himself, and also his giving being to all creatures,
and to his word both promises and threatenings. Jah; Psa. 68.4.
signifying that God is an absolute being of himself, and gives being to all
creatures. Ehjeh asher Ehjeh, Exodus 3.14.
I am that I am, or I will be that I will be; it signifies Gods eternal and
unchangeable being in himself, and that he is now and will be for ever that
which he was before to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob; accordingly we read of Jesus,
Hebr. 5.8. to this Name Christ alludeth Joh. 8.58. El, the mighty one; Isa. 9.6.
signifying that God has all power in himself, and gives unto all creatures
the power which they have. Elohim, a word of the Plural Number; Genesis 1.26.
signifying that there is a plurality in this one being of God, and so notes
the mystery of the Trinity, or Three Persons in one Essence. Shaddai; Genesis 17.1.
signifying the All Sufficiency of God; or, that God is he who is
Allsufficient, wanting nothing, and able to provide for all. Adonai, Lord; Psa.
2.4.
signifying the absolute Lordship of God; it is of the Plural Number, and
therefore signifies all the Three Persons in one Essence. Helion, translated,
the most High; Psa. 9.2.
signifying that God in his being and glory is far above all creatures. Luke
1.32.
In the New Testament.
Theos, Mat. 4.7.
God; signifying a Being that is above all other beings, and comprehending all
other beings in its power. Kurios, Col. 4.1.
Lord or Master; signifying, that God is the only Lord, and has absolute
power over all creatures.
Of the Attributes.
Q. What do you understand by the attributes of God?

A. Certain essential properties which God is pleased in Scripture to ascribe
or attribute unto himself; they are also called the Perfections of God, or
Divine Predications or Titles.

Q. What is the use of these attributes?

A. Their use is to help our understanding the better to conceive of the
Essence of God. Exodus 34.6, 7.


Q. How are the attributes distinguished from the essence?

A. They are not distinguished from the essence really, but notionally; that
is, they are not distinguished at all in God, but only to usward, according
to our manner of conceiving; for every and all the attributes are the Divine
essence it self, according to that received proposition, Whatsoever is in God,
is God: and this is the reason why some describe every attribute from the
essence of God.

Q. How many kinds of attributes are there?

A. Three, Negative. Relative. Positive.


Q. What do you understand by the Negative attributes?

A. Such attributes as remove from God all imperfection; by these we help our
understanding in our meditation of God by way of negation.

Q. How many Negative attributes are there, to which, or some of which, any
other of like nature may conveniently be referred?

A. Five, Simplicity. Eternity. Immensity. Imutability. Infiniteness.


Q. What is Simplicity?

A. It is God; one mere and perfect act without all composition. Exodus 3.14.


Q. What do you mean in saying God is a mere and perfect act?

A. That God is a cause without any cause, a being that is not from any being,
not compounded of an act by which he is, and possibility by which he may not
be, of whom it never could nor can be said, that any thing was to be in him,
which is not, or cannot be, that is.

Q. How many ways of composition are there?

A. Seven.

1. Of parts which are bounded by quantity, as a body having one part upon
another. 2. Of matter and form, as a man of body and soul. 3. Of general and
special nature, as every species whose common nature may be found in some other
thing, where the special nature is not, as a living creature and a man. 4. Of a
subject and an accident, as every created substance. 5. Of an act and
possibility, as Angels. 6. Of a person and nature, as Christ compounded of the
Divine Person and Humane nature, which yet is not properly composition of
parts, but of number. 7. Of being and individuation, that is, that by which we
have such a particular being, as Humanity and Peter.
Q. What is Eternity?

A. God without Beginning, Isa. 57.15.
without End, and without all manner of Succession, where is nothing past nor to
come.

Q. How is the duration of God of incorruptible creatures, and of corruptible
creatures, distinguished?

A. The duration of God is called Eternity; the duration of incorruptible
creatures, such as Angels, and the souls of men, which had a beginning, but
shall have no end, is called Eviternity; the duration of corruptible creatures,
is called Time.

Q. What is the Immensity of God?

A. God present every where, Ps. 139.7 Isa. 66.1. Ier. 23.
neither included in, nor excluded from any place or thing.

Q. How many ways do you understand God to be every where?

A. Three, 1. By his Essence, Genesis 1.31 Ioh. 1.3. Col. 1.16 Ps 139.7 Heb. 4.13
Act. 17.28. Col. 1.17. Heb. 1.3.
as the cause of all things. 2. By his Presence, beholding all things. 3. By
his Power, upholding all things in their motion and action.


Q. What is Immutability? Psa. 102.27, 28. Mal. 3.6. Iam. 1.17


A. God without any alteration in respect of being, will, or any accidents.

Q. What is Infiniteness?

A. It is God incomprehensible in respect of Created understanding, Ioh 1.18 1 Timothy 6.16. Job 11.8
and comprehending in himself the fullness of all perfection.

Q. Give the sum of the Negative attributes?

A. By Simplicity Eternity Immensity Imutability Infiniteness
we remove from God all composition and multiplicity. time and succession.
place and quantity. change and quality. comprehensibility.


Q. What do you understand by Relative attributes?

A. Such attributes as are ascribed to God in time, employing a respect unto
the creatures now in being; by these our understanding is helped in our
meditation of God by way of causality.

Q. Do these Relative attributes, in that they are ascribed unto God, in time
infer any change in God?

A. No; they do not infer any change or accident in God; James 1.17.
in such attributes there is no change in God, but in the creatures.

Q. How many Relative attributes are there to which, or some of which, the rest
of like nature may conveniently be referred?

A. Seven, 1. Creation. 2. Providence. 3. Lordship. 4. Benignity. 5. Mercy. 6.
Redemption 7. Justice.


Q. What is Creation?

A. God creating all things of nothing very good. Genesis 1.

Prove. 16.4. Romans 8.28, 29.
unto their several ends, according to the counsel of his will, for his own
glory, and the good of his Elect.

Q. What is the Lordship of God?

A. God having absolute right and power to and over all his creatures, 1 Samuel
3.18. 1 Timothy 6.15. Job 33.13. Matthew. 20.15. Romans 9.20. Dan. 4.25.
and disposing thereof according to his will.

Q. What is Benignity? Psa. 33.5 Mat. 5.45 1 Timothy 4.10. Ps. 36.6.


A. God freely communicating of his grace and goodness to his creatures
according to his good pleasure.

Q. What is Mercy?

A. God inclined out of his free love to succor his creature in misery. Exodus
34.6. Deuteronomy. 4.31. 1 Chro. 21.13. Jonah 4.2. Iam. 5.11.


Q. What is Redemption? Ioh 3.16 Mat. 20.28. Mark 10.45.1^ Gal. 2.20 Romans 3.26.


A. God giving his Son, and Jesus Christ God-Man giving himself a ransom for
the Elect; whence it comes to pass, that Justice is no hinderance to the
application of Mercy.

Q. What is Justice?

A. Justice is, Deu. 32.4 Dan. 9.16 Psa. 80.14 Isa. 5.16. Psalm. 62.11, 12.
God rendering unto the reasonable creature what is due thereunto according to
his Word, whether by way of grace or punishment.

Q. What do you understand by the Positive attributes?

A. Such attributes as ascribe some perfection to God, not inferring any
respect unto the creatures existing, or in present being; by these our
understanding is helped in our meditation of God by way of eminency.

Q. What is Perfection?

A. God All-sufficient and All-excellent, not having need of any thing, giving

CHAP. II. Hitherto of the Essence: now Of the Subsistence of GOD.
Q. What is the Subsistence of God?

A. That one Divine Essence subsisting in Three Persons, of Father, Son and
holy Ghost; so as the Father is of none, the Son of the Father, the Holy Ghost
from the Father and the Son.

Q. How many persons are there of the Divine Essence?

A. Three, God the Father, God the Son, Mat. 3.16 Mat. 28.19. Ioh. 15.26 2 Cor.
13.13. 1 Ioh. 5.7.
and God the holy Ghost.

Q. What is a person?

A. A person is God, or the Divine Essence subsisting in such a relation.

Q. What do you understand by the first person of the Trinity?

A. God subsisting in the relation of begetting, and together with the Son,
breathing forth or producing the holy Ghost.

Q. What do you understand by the second person?

A. God subsisting in the relation of being begotten, and together with the
Father, breathing forth or producing the holy Ghost.

Q. What do you understand by the third person?

A. God subsisting in the relation of proceeding from the Father and the Son.

Q. What do you gather from thence; viz. that the whole Divine Essence subsists
in every person?

A. 1. That all the Divine Attributes are common and predicate of every person.
2. All the Names that are proper to God, are common to every person. 3. That
all the works of God which are upon the creature, are truly predicated of every
person. 4. That Divine worship is due to every person. 5. That all the persons
are equal.


Q. How does a person differ from the Essence?

A. As the relation or manner of any being or thing is distinguished from the
thing it self.

Q. How does a person differ from a person?

A. As a relation or manner of a being or thing is distinguished from a relation
or manner of a being or thing; or more largely they are distinguished by their
order, properties and manner of working.

Q. What is the order of the Three persons in the Trinity?

A. That the Father is the first person, John 5.30. John 15.26.
the Son is the second, the holy Ghost in the third; that is, there is a
priority in respect of the order of their original, but no priority of dignity,
duration, causality or nature, properly.

Q. What rule have we to regulate our apprehensions concerning the order of the
persons?

A. Notwithstanding distinction in respect of order, the persons remain equal
amongst themselves.

Q. What is a personal property?

A. That which is proper to one person; Psa. 2.7. Ioh. 1.14 and 15.26.
the personal property of the Father is to beget, of the Son to be begotten, of
the holy Ghost to proceed.

Q. What rule have we to regulate our apprehensions concerning the personal
properties?

A. The manner of the existence of the persons, is communicable from one person
to another, but the Essence is incommunicable.

Q. What do you understand by the manner of the working of the persons? Genesis
19.24. John 5.19, 30. and 8.28.


A. That the manner of their working is according to the manner of their
existing, the Father not from any, Ioh. 16.13. and 14.26. and 15.26. Gal. 4.6.
the Son from the Father, the holy Ghost from the Father and the Son.

Q. What rules have we to regulate our apprehensions, concerning the manner of
the working of the persons?

A. Two, 1. The causality of the operations of every person is from the Divine
essence, the order of the operations from the manner of the existence of the
several persons. 2. All the works of God upon the creature are wrought in
common by all the Three persons, notwithstanding the work be principally
ascribed unto that person whose manner of existence does most eminently appear
in it.


Q. What terms are we to avoid in speaking of the Trinity?

A. Five sorts of terms, 1. Diversity or difference, 2. Of division, 3. Of
disparity, 4. Of confusion 5. Of solitariness,
opposite to the Simplicity of God. Unity of God. Equality of the persons.
Order of the persons. Number of the persons.


Q. After what has hitherto been said, express now your belief concerning God.

A. I believe God to be Jehovah Elohim; that is, one absolute being, subsisting
in Three persons, of Father, Son and holy Ghost.

CHAP. III. Hitherto of the Sufficiency: now Of the Efficiency of GOD, and
Apostasy of MAN.
Q. What is the Efficiency of God?

A. It is that whereby he works all things, Ephesians. 1.11.
and all in all things.

Q. How many kinds are there of this Efficiency, or how may the works of God
be divided?

A. They are Essential. Personal. Personal after a manner.


Q. What do you mean by the Essential works of God?

A. Such works as do proceed from the Divine Essence, which is common to
Father, Son and holy Ghost, and whose object is the creature.

Q. What do you mean by the personal works of God?

A. Such works as proceed from any of the persons working according to their
personal properties; viz. for the Father to beget, the Son to be begotten, and
the holy Ghost to proceed.

Q. How do you distinguish between the Essential and Personal works?

A. The Principle of the Essential works, is the Divine Essence common to
Father, Son and holy Ghost.

The Principle of the Personal works, is some one of the persons working
according to its personal relation, or relative property.

Q. How may the Essential works of God be divided?

A. They are Internal. External.


Q. What is the difference between the internal and external works of God, both
being essential?

A. The internal works are increated, the external are created.

The internal are from eternity, the external are in time.

Q. What do you mean by the internal essential works of God?

A. Such works as are in the Divine Essence it self by an inward and eternal
act, as namely, the Decree of God.

Q. What is the Decree of God?

A. His eternal purpose of working all things according to the counsel of his
will. Act. 2.23 and 4.28. Ephesians. 1.9.

viz. 1. The nature of the soul. 2. The conformity of the whole man unto Gods
will 3. The original liberty of his will to good. 4. His dominion over the
creatures.


Q. What is the Soul?

A. The Soul is a spiritual, incorporeal and immortal substance, created by God
of nothing, immediately infused into the body as the proper form thereof, by
which man is, lives, is sensible, moves, understands, wills, and is
affected, and when it shall be separated from the body, it still remains
immortal, subsisting by it self, to be reunited to the body at the
Resurrection, there to abide for ever.

Q. What is the Providence of God? Ioh. 5.17 Psalm. 76.10. Ephesians. 1.6. Phil. 2.10,
11. Romans 8.28. Matt. 10.29, 30.


A. It is an external work of God, by which he preserves, and so orders and

Q. How many parts are there of his Providence?

A. Two, The keeping of his creatures in their being and virtues. Acts 11.28.

A. His prescribing to them a Law: and Deuteronomy. 26.16, 17, 18. Romans 9.19.
ordering the events that were to follow thereupon.


Q. Touching the ordering of the events concerning man, what are you to
consider?

A. Two things, Romans 5.19. 1 Cor. 15.21.
1. His Apostasy or fall, which was the transgression of the Law prescribed to
him by God. 2. His Recovery.


Q. What are there to be considered in his Apostasy.

A. The transgression it self. Genesis 3.6


The propagation of it.

Q. But for your better understanding of this point, what may you further
consider concerning the transgression?

A. 1. The sinfulness of the transgression. Genesis 2.17.
2. The causes. 3. The consequents thereof.


Q. What are you to consider concerning the causes of this transgression?

A. 1. Negatively, Iam. 1.13.
God was not the cause of it. 2. Affirmatively, Genesis 3.1 and 3.6.
the External cause was the instigation of Satan. Internal, the swerving of the
will of our first Parents from the Will of God.



Q. What are you to consider concerning the consequents or events thereof?

A. The Guilt. Genesis 2.17. and 3.10.
Punishment, viz. Death; a great part of which death is original sin, 1 Cor.
15.21, 22.
whence actual sin flows as an act from the habit.


Q. What is Original sin?

A. The hereditary and habitual enmity and contrariety of the whole nature of
man unto the Law of God, Romans 7.17, 20. Heb. 12.1. Genesis 6.5. Romans 8.7 Ier. 2.13.
consisting in aversness from all good, and propensness to all evil.

Q. What is Actual sin?

A. It is the swerving of the act of man either in thought, Romans 7.16, 17. 2
Cor. 10.5. Mat. 12.37. Eccl. 12.14.
word, deed,
from the Law of God.

Q. How many sorts are there of Actual sin?

A. Two, sins of Omission. Commission.


Q. What is the propagation of sin?

A. The conveyance of the actual sin of Adam in eating the forbidden fruit, Job
14.4. Psa. 51.5. Romans 5.14. Ephesians. 2.3.
and of original sin to all his posterity proceeding from him by ordinary
generation; together with the guilt and punishment thereof.

Q. After what manner is all this propagated?

A. The Instrumental cause, Genesis 5.3 Psa. 51.5. Job 14.4. Ioh. 3.6. Romans 12.5.
is the seed of our next Parents. Blameable cause, is Adams sin made ours by
imputation, and by real communication, and it may seem by some kind of
participation. Unblameable cause, is the righteousness of God, Genesis 2.17.
not as the Author of nature, but the Avenger of sin.


Q. After what order is sin derived to man?

A. First, the actual sin of Adam in eating the forbidden fruit; thence
proceeds original sin as an effect from the cause; thence actual, as an act
from the habit, with the guilt and penalties, all hanging one upon another.

Q. What is the way by which God reveals this misery?

A. By the moral Law. Romans 7.7


Q. How does God reveal this misery by the law?

A. First, Romans 3.20. Isa. 4.4. Romans 8.15. 2 Timothy 1.7.
by discovering sin as sin.

Secondly, by the works of conviction, bondage, terror, all in their measure.

Q. What are we to think of man in this estate according to the Scripture?

A. That he is wholly dead in sin, the child of wrath and disobedience.

CHAP. IV. Hitherto of Man's Apostasy or Fall from GOD: now Of Man's recovery,
the Redeemer, and the Person of Christ.
Q. What is man's recovery? Romans 6.14. Romans 8.2 Gal. 3.10 Acts. 26.18.


A. It is the restoring of him from the state of sin and death, unto the estate
of grace and life.

Q. How many parts are there of man's recovery?

A. Two, Redemption: Application of it.

Q. What is Redemption?

A. It is the freeing of man from the bondage of the Curse, Sin and Satan, into
the liberty of the grace of God in Jesus Christ, by the laying down of a price.

Q. Who is the Redeemer? 1 Timothy 2.5, 6. 2 Cor. 15.21.


A. Jesus Christ.

Q. What is Jesus Christ?

A. God; viz. the second person in the Trinity, and Man in one person, anointed
to be a King, Priest and Prophet unto his people: Briefly, he is God-Man,
Mediator between God and man.

Q. What things are chiefly to be considered in Jesus Christ?

A. 1. His fitness to be a Redeemer. 2. The parts of Redemption.


Q. In what does this fitness to be a Redeemer consist?

A. In his person and office.

Q. What is to be known concerning the person of Christ?

A. 1. The distinction of the two natures. Matthew. 1.23. Ioh. 1.14 Col. 2.9.
2. The personal union of them in him. 3. The effects and consequents of this
personal union.


Q. What is the distinction of the two natures?

A. That whereby the two natures remain distinct in him, both in themselves and
in their properties.

Q. What is the personal union of them?

A. That whereby the second person in the Trinity, John 1.14. Hebr. 4.15. 1 Timothy 3.16.
viz. the Divine Essence subsisting in the relation of the Son, assumed the
Manhood like unto us in all things, sin only excepted, and the manner of its
subsistence; for the Manhood never subsisted but in the Godhead, from which
substantial coupling together both of the Divine and Humane nature, both
natures make but one person.

Q. Why must Jesus Christ be Man? Ge. 2.17 1 Cor. 15.21.


A. That he might in our nature suffer for us.

Q. Why must he be God?

A. That his sufferings might be overcome by him, 2 Cor. 13.4. 1 Pet. 3.18.
Heb. 9.1, 4.
and be effectual unto us.

Q. But how do you apprehend the Manhood to be united to the Godhead?

A. By means of the second person, so that the Manhood was united immediately
to the person, and so mediately to the Godhead.

Q. For the better understanding of this personal union, what is to be
considered?

A. Three things: 1. A double consideration of the second person of the
Trinity. 2. The consideration of the nature of a person. 3. What it is for the
Manhood to receive its personality from the second person in the Trinity.


Q. How does it appear that there is cause for a double consideration of the
second person in the Trinity?

A. 1. The second person in the Trinity considered in himself, is God and not
Man; but being considered in personal union with the Manhood, he is God-Man. 2.
That the second person should be of the Father by coeternal generation, was
absolutely necessary; but that the second person should be united unto the
Humane nature, was not absolutely necessary, but proceeded from the free
pleasure of God: Or that the second person should be, was absolutely necessary;
that he should be incarnate, was arbitrary, not necessary. 3. The second person
as considered in himself, is of the Father, not of the holy Ghost: The second
person considered in personal union with the Manhood, is of the Father, Son and
holy Ghost. 4. The second person considered in himself, is equal unto the
Father; but considered as united to the Manhood, is inferior to the Father in
respect of his voluntary dispensation. 5. The second person considered in
himself, was of the object of Faith unto Adam in the first Covenant, who was to
believe in God the Father, Son and holy Ghost; but the second person incarnate
God-Man Mediator, was not of the object of Faith in the first, though he be in
the second Covenant.


Q. What is a person?

A. A person is the complete and lastly perfecting subsistence of a reasonable
nature.

Q. What is it for the Manhood to receive its personality from the second
person in the Trinity?

A. It is for the manhood from the first moment of its conception (it never
having neither subsistence nor consistence of it self) to subsist in the second
person of the Trinity; so as the second person in the Trinity and the manhood
have two natures, yet but one, and that an increated person.

Q. What are the principal effects and consequents of this personal union unto
the Manhood?

A. Seven: Col. 2.9.
1. The grace of Eminence, whereby the Manhood by reason of this personal union
is exalted above all creatures, and now sits at the right hand of God. 2.
Created habitual grace out of measure, the same in kind with which all
believers are made partakers of. 3. Created knowledge. Psalm. 68.18. John 1.16.
John 3.34. Matthew. 28.18.
4. Capableness to receive all power both in heaven and earth. 5. Capableness
of the office of a Mediator. 6. The communication of the properties of both
natures, to the same one person. 7. The right of Divine adoration, yet we are
to know that we worship not with divine worship the Manhood, as considered in
it self, but as being personally united to the Godhead; that is, we worship the
Lord Jesus as God-Man.


Q. How many sorts of created knowledge are there in Christ?

A. Three: 1. Beatifical, consisting in the vision of God, whereby the Manhood
does not only see God face to face, as all they that are blessed do; but sees
it self in personal union with God; this is called the knowledge of the vision;
of it Joh. 1.18. Its principle is the Word, its medium a created light of
glory. 2. Infused, by which Christ as Man knew what can be known either of
Angels or Men in this life; of it Isa. 11.2. its principle was a divine habit
immediately inspired, its medium a created light of grace. 3. Experimental, by
which Christ as Man knew all things that could be known by the light of humane
understanding; of it Luke 2.52. its medium the light of created reason.


CHAP. V. Hitherto of the Person: now Of the office of the Lord Jesus Christ.
Q. What is the Mediatorly office of the Lord Jesus Christ?

A. It Is that work of mediation committed unto the Son by the Father, Heb. 5.4,
5, 6. Ioh. 6.27 John 10.16. Phil. 2.6 Isa. 53.10
accepted readily and freely by the Son, thereby procuring the application of

our persons and actions accepted before God.


Q. What is the Kingly part of his Mediatorly office?

A. It Is that part of the Mediatorly office, Rev. 118. 1 Cor. 15.24, 25.
in which that which Christ makes known as a Prophet, and purchased as a
Priest, he does now apply and establish by his Spirit as a King to the Elect;
together with the everlasting overthrow of his and their enemies.

Q. What are the parts of this Kingly part of his office?

A. Two: 1. His calling upon all that hear the Gospel by the word of truth;
Matthew. 28.18. Isa. 11.10, 11, 12, 13.
upon the Elect, by the special work of his Spirit; upon others, by his works,
and the grace of nature; i.e. the remainder of the image of God abiding with
man after the fall. 2. His exercising judgment upon all.


Q. How has this an end?

A. 1. In respect of the manner of dispensation, 1 Cor. 15.24.
it has an end. 2. But in regard of the glory due thereby to the Mediator,

CHAP. VII. Hitherto of Redemption: now Concerning the application of it, with
the parts thereof.
Q. What is the application of Redemption?

A. It is that work of the Spirit, 1 Cor. 12.13. John 3.5, 6, 8.
whence that which Christ has procured as Mediator, is seasonably and
effectually applied to the Elect.

Q. Why is the application of the work of Redemption, eminently ascribed to the
Spirit?

A. In two respects: 1. In respect of the office of the Spirit. Ephesians. 1.17
2. In respect of the manner of his working; John 14.16. Ioh. 16.7.
for as his subsisting is from the Father and the Son, so his working is from
the Father and the Son; and consequently, the consummation of things is
especially ascribed to the holy Ghost.

Q. What is the subject unto which the Spirit does apply the work of Redemption?

A. The Elect prepared by the work of the Spirit, Matthew. 10.6. 2 Cor. 5.19.

Q. What are the parts of this application? John 15.25. Romans 11.17. Romans 7.4.


A. Three: 1. Vocation: 2. Union: 3. Communion.

Q. What is Vocation?

A. It is the infusion of a principal of life (or as some speak, Ephesians. 2.1. John
6.63. John 6.64, 65. John 5.41. Rom 11.28, 32.
of the habit of Faith) by the spirit into a lost soul, in measure sensible of
its inability and enmity to believe, repent or do any good: by the means of,
and together with the external call of the Gospel, in which work the soul
notwithstanding any preparatory work, is merely passive; i. e. a mere passive
receiver.

Q. What is justifying Faith?

A. It is a saving grace of the spirit flowing from election, Tit. 1.2 Ioh.
1.12 2 Cor. 4.1 Phi. 3.12 Col. 2.6.
whereby the soul receives Jesus Christ as its Head and Savior, according as
he is revealed in the Gospel.

Q. What is Union?

A. It is the conjunction of Jesus Christ and the believer in one mystical
body, 1 Cor. 12.12, 13 Romans 12.5. Col. 2.19.
by the Spirit and Faith; whence arises the relation of a Head and Member
between Christ and the believer for ever.

Q. When is Union wrought?

A. At the same time with, but in order of nature, after Vocation.

Q. What is Communion?

A. It is that whereby a believer by virtue of his Union, is orderly made
partaker of all the good of the Covenant of GRACE.

Q. What are the benefits of this Communion, which a believer has with God in
Christ Jesus?

A. They are of two sorts; 1. Relative or Imputative: 2. Inherent. Relative
benefits are such which are not Inherent in the subject; yet real, as
Justification and Adoption; Inherent, as Sanctification and Glorification.

Q. What is Justification?

A. It is a gracious act of God upon a believer, Romans 3.22, 24. Romans 4.5. 2
Cor. 5.19.
whereby for the righteousness sake of Christ, imputed by God and applied by
Faith, he does freely discharge him from sin and the curse, accept him as
righteous with the righteousness of Christ, and acknowledge him to have a right
unto eternal life.

Q. What is the efficient cause of Justification?

A. God the Father, Romans 8.30.
Son and holy Ghost.

Q. What is the material cause?

A. The Active and Passive obedience of Jesus Christ. Phil. 3.8, 9. Romans 3.22.
Romans 3.24. Romans 4.6 Phil. 3.8, 9. 2 Cor. 5.21.


Q. What is the formal cause of Justification?

A. The free imputation of this Active and Passive righteousness unto the
believer.

Q. What is the instrument of applying Justification?

A. Faith, which Justifies Not properly, Not by way of a work, Not as an
inherent quality,
but relatively.

Q. What is the final cause of Justification?

A. To declare the glory of God in a way of mercy, mixed with righteousness.
Romans 3.25, 26.


Q. What is Adoption?

A. Adoption is the gracious good pleasure of God, Ioh. 1.12 1 Ioh. 3.1
by which he does acknowledge and declare all believers to be his sons.

Q. Why is Adoption placed after Justification?

A. Because Adoption necessarily presupposes reconciliation.

Q. How does the Adoption of man differ from the Adoption of God?

A. 1. In respect of the ground of it: the Adoption of man is grounded upon
that which is external, but the adoption of believers is founded on an inward
act; briefly, it is Faith. 2. In respect of the right unto the inheritance: the
Adoption of man has no other right besides his Adoption; the sons of God have
right as believers. 3. In respect of the state of him that does Adopt: a man
Adopts where he wants sons; but God does not want sons when he Adopts children
unto him. 4. In respect of the manner of possessing the inheritance: those whom
man Adopts, they inherit by succession; a believer inherits his by a way of
participation, and not succession. 5. In respect of the number of them that are
Adopted; a man Adopts but one son or few, but God Adopts many.


Q. What are the benefits of Adoption?

A. They are Three: John 8.32, 36. Romans 8.17. 1 Cor. 3.21, 22.
1. Spiritual liberty: 2. Coheirship with Christ: 3. Restored lordship over the
creatures, and interest in the Angels.

Q. How come the believers to have this sonship made known to them?

A. By the testimony of the Spirit.

Q. What is that peace which accompanyeth justifying Faith as the next effect
thereof? Romans 8.15, 16. Gal. 4 5, 6, 7.


A. Repentance; the nature of which does especially consist in an aversion from
sin, Amos 5.14, 15. Ier. 31.33. Ezekiel. 36.26, 27. 1 Cor. 15.10. 2 Cor. 10.4.
Romans 8 30. 1 Thessalonians. 5.23, 24. Col. 3.5. Col. 3.10
and a full purpose of cleaving unto God.

Q. What is Sanctification?

A. Sanctification is a habit of inherent grace, infused by the Spirit of God
universally into all the powers of the soul, whereby the believer is
effectually inclined and (by assisting grace) enabled to bring down every high
thought, and to yield Evangelical obedience unto the whole will of God.

Q. What are the parts of Sanctification?

A. Two Mortification, Vivification.


Q. What are the differences between Justification and Sanctification?

A. Three: 1. In respect of the subject: The subject of our Justification, in
which that is inherent, is Jesus Christ: The subject of Sanctification, in
which that is inherent, is the whole man, though not wholly. 2. In respect of
the form of Justification and Sanctification; The form of Justification is by
way of imputation, but Sanctification is the motion of alteration, from the
corrupt to the renewed part. 3. In respect of the adjuncts, one especially;
Heb. 12.30. Matthew. 25.34. Mat. 25.21, 23. Psalm. 16.11. Rov. 21.22, 23. Rev. 22.1
our Justification it is perfect, and in Christ; our Sanctification is
imperfect, and is in us.

Q. What is Glorification?

A. It Is that state wherein the elect being freed from all imperfection, do
enjoy perfect blessedness in the presence of God, and of the Lamb for ever.

Q. Wherein does this glorified estate of the elect consist?

A. In four things: 1. The vision of God: Math. 5.9. 1 Ioh. 3.1 Psalm. 17.15. 1
Cor. 13.12. Phil. 1.23. Phil. 3.21. Heb. 11.35. Phil. 3.11
2. Conformity to God: 3. Satisfaction in God: 4. Knowledge of this estate.

Q. When shall this blessed estate of the elect be enjoyed?

A. The soul shall go into this glorious estate at its dissolution, but the
full accomplishment of glory, is reserved until the body and the soul be
reunited at the Resurrection.

Q. What is the second part of the Doctrine of godliness? 1 Pet 1.2 and 1.14,
15. Romans 6.16, 18.


A. Obedience unto God.

Q. What is obedience?

A. A habit wrought in us by the holy Ghost; Mic. 6*8. Gal. 2.20. 1 Cor. 15.10.
whence through the help of the same Spirit working in us, we do in a way of
Faith Evangelically fulfill the revealed and commanded will of God.

Q. What is required to the performing of an act of obedience, Isa. 29.13 Mat.
15 9 and 12.33 Romans 14.23. 1 Cor. 10.31.
which is commonly called a good work?

A. Three things: 1. That it be commanded: 2. That it be done in Faith, in
respect of the habit and act: 3. That it be done to the glory of God.

Q. What is the rule of obedience?

A. The Decalogue or the ten commandments; Deuteronomy. 4.13. Mica. 6 8 Mat. 22.37,
38, 39, 40.
unto which, whatsoever is commanded in Scripture may be reduced.

Q. What general rules are there which may be as helps for the better
understanding of the Decalogue.

A. These: 1. The Decalogue must be understood to comprehend as well internal
as external duties. 2. Every Negative includes an Affirmative, and on the
contrary, 3. Negative commands bind us at all times, there is never any time
to do any evil: Affirmative commands bind us not at all times; for we are not
to do this or that particular good duty at all times. 4. The commandments of
the second Table must give place to the commandments of the first; if the
commands of the one and other be compared in the same degree: but the greatest
duties of the second Table, must not give way to the least in the first, Mat.
12.7. 5. Whatsoever is commanded in the Scriptures, may directly or indirectly
be reduced to the Decalogue; those commands Mat. 22.37, 39. are reduced to the
Decalogue as principles to their conclusions; other commands are reduced as
conclusions to their principles: some of which we yet must remember cannot be
referred to any one command only, but in diverse respects are to be referred
unto diverse.


Q. How is the Decalogue, which is the rule of obedience, divided? Exodus 31.18.
Deuteronomy. 9.10. Exodus 32 16.


A. Into two Tables, according to the two general parts of obedience.

Q. Which are those two parts of obedience?

A. 1. Religion, showing our duty toward God, the sum of the first Table.
Matt. 22.32. Romans 1.18. Tit. 2.12
2. Righteousness, showing our duty toward our Neighbor, the sum of the second
Table.


Q. What is Religion?

A. It Is a virtue wrought by the holy Ghost, Romans 1.21. Acts 26.5. James 1.26,
27.
by which, together with the exercise thereof, believers do rightly acknowledge
and worship God.

Q. What is worship?

A. The immediate service of God, whereby in Jesus Christ we give unto him the
honor of the supreme, only and absolute Lord, and exercise a holy communion
with him as with our God.

Q. How many kinds of religious worship are there?

A. Two: 1. Natural, called otherwise primary, or properly moral worship. 2.
Instituted, called otherwise secondary, Exodus 20.6.
positive temporal by some ceremonial worship.

A. The perpetual and eternal service of God commanded in the first Table: thus

of which, that which is proper to the Church under the Gospel, is that which

A. 1. Moral worship, besides its being taught in the first Table, may be
learned out of the nature of God: Instituted worship is founded in the positive
Law of God. 2. Moral worship continues unchanged: Instituted worship has been
changed, being diverse before the Law, under the Law, and under the Gospel. 3.
Moral worship is perpetual: 1 Cor. 13.8.
Instituted worship is temporal, ending with the world.
