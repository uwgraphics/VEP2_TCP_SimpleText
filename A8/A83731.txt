Die Martis, Iunii 24. 1645.
IT is this day Ordered by the Commons assembled in Parliament that the
Ensigns and Cornetts sent up now by Sir Thomas Fairfax, and all other Ensigns
and Cornetts, that have at any time formerly, or shall at any time hereafter be
taken from the enemy, shall be brought into the Heralds office, by those
persons in whose hands they do now or shall happen to remain, to the end the
same may be registered and preserved in some convenient place there, and that
they may be known what they are, and when, and where they were taken, and that
William Ryley Esquire Lancaster Herald at arms, be solely entrusted with the
custody and safe keeping of them, and shall be answerable for the same upon
demand of both Houses, or either House of Parliament or of any Committee to be
appointed by them in that behalf.
