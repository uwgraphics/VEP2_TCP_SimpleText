GODS REVENGE Upon his Parliaments AND Peoples Enemies, by the examples of some
great Malignants, whom God has punished to give others warning.

Being a true Relation of four Citizens of London dwelling on Ludgate Hill,
that went to Oxford, and with others as ill affected as themselves, drank
healths to the confusion of the Parliament, as they came home, one of them
broke his leg, another broke his back, and the other two fell mad, all
remaining in a miserable condition: together with the like example of the Lord
Hopton at Madbury near Plymouth, and one M. Turner Vintner at the half Moon
at Oxford.

GODS Revenge against his Parliaments and Peoples enemies.
IT is made plain enough to those whose eyes are in their heads, that the
enemies of the Parliament are the enemies of the Lord; but the Devil, and
Papists, and a company of ill-affected people have blinded the eyes of many
amongst us, that they cannot see it, and therefore will not believe it: but
such is Gods goodness to this poor Kingdom of England, that he has wrought
by his Parliament wonderfully, and beyond the reach of natural reason, to
convince the enemies of the truth, and yet they will not believe; therefore God
has of late sent strange judgments upon some of them, to give the rest
warning: One M. Turner a Vintner in Oxford, that kept a Tavern at the sign of
the half Moon in the said town of Oxford, where (with other malignants that
came to him as guests to drink in his house, desired his company) amongst other
strange discourse which they had, they fell to drinking of healths, and amongst
the rest he began an health to the confusion of the Roundheads, and in a great
bravado drank off his glass of wine, and then leaped, and cut two or three
capers, praying for their confusion, but see the judgment of God, who sees all
the ways of man, and judges them according to the wickedness of their
inventions, he fell down and brake his leg, and he was carried home in great
pain, but he never recovered of it, it cost him his life; so that indeed the
confusion fell upon himself, a fearful example: I judge not his eternal
condition, for whether he repented or not, I cannot tell, I pray God others may
take heed by his example.

Another example did lately befall Sir Ralph, now made Lord Hopton, a
wonderful and remarkable judgment: The Earl of Stamford being in Plymouth and
keeping it for the King and Parliament, having done worthily in opposing him,
now at last the Lord Hopton being exceedingly puffed up with the vain glory of
being a Baron, forgot himself the more, and God too, drew up his forces for
Plymouth, and marched against the Earl of Stamford, assuring himself of the
taking thereof, and therefore he would first, with some of his Commanders, visit
the tavern in a little town called Modbury near Plymouth, and fell to drinking
of healths, they drunk the Kings health, I blame them not for loving the King,
I pray God bless His Majesty, all that love and honor him, not only in words,
but really from their hearts: but to proceed in my discourse, diverse other
healths they drunk, but at last the new made Baron began a health to the
confusion of the Roundheads, and made them all to pledge it: this he did in
great confidence of overcoming the Earl of Stamford, and taking Plymouth, where
he resolved to play the part of a true Cavalier-plunderer; to the confusion of
protestants, that stood for the king and Parliament, and having thus pleased
his own fancy with the promise of vain hope, and deceived expectation, he
departed the town with his fill of the juice of the grapes, and marching
nearer to Plymouth the Army was perceved by the Earl of Stamfords forces, who
beat an Alarm, and came against him with an undaunted courage, they played
their Canons and Muskets, and fought stiffly on both sides, but see what is the
event of drinking such healths, he got that day such an overthrow, as he is
never like to repair the ruins thereof, with the loss of diverse commanders,
hundreds of his soldiers, and it is reported that himself is dangerously
hurt, so that they to whom he wished confusion, their Army have brought him to
a miserable condition, God give him grace to call for mercy: he was so vain
glorious of this determination, that messengers brought word to London from
him, that he had taken Plymouth before the battle began but God disposed it
otherwise, let others take warning of the like attempt.

But to come to the last and chief part of my discourse, namely concerning
four Citizens of London, two of which are Habbadashers, and the other two
Hosiers all neighbors on Lud-gat hill, I forbear their names, in modesty they
are well enough known these four malignants resolved to go for Oxford,
pretending to put off some rich wares that they had this dead times which here
they could not, but to Oxford they went, and being there they found out
acquantance suitable to their desires, what other matters they did at Oxford, I
stand not to dispute, only it is reported that they with their Oxford
acquaintance went to the tavern, where they were very merry, and drank hard,
amongst the rest, they drank the Kings heal^h the Queens, Princes and Prince
Ruperts health, and (...) they drank an hellish, and devilish health, b^ from
hell, but now too often used by malign^^^s, (...) Cavaliers, they drank an
health to the confusion of the Parliament, and so parted, but mark what
f^^lowed, having stayed at Oxford so long as they thought fit; they repaired to
their Inn, and called for their horses, on which they mount and for London
they come, with hearts as base, and full of rankor against the Parliament as
before, but justice over took them, and smote them by the way: and they are
made examples for all malignants to look upon; one of them fell from his horse,
and by accident broke his leg most dangerously of whom the rest had the best
care they could, had him to a Surgeon and got him looked to, and had the
best means they could obtain, a second fell from his horse in such a grievous
manner that he broke his back, and all burised his body in most lamentable wise
in so much that it is thought he will hardly escape it. The other two seeing
these disasters, and being smitten in conscience for their drinking of healths
to confusion of the Parliament they began to be destracted which increased so
much by reason of the consideration of their great abuse to the King and
Parliament, and the fearful sights they had beheld of their fellows, they
were exceedingly destracted, and raged in a wonderful manner, in so much that
their brains were exceedingly broken, and they were indeed mad, in this
miserable condition were they all four brought to their own houses at Ludgate
hill, where they are all neighbors, and there they lie in a most miserable,
and deplorable condition, yet some of them, have found some amendment since
there coming home, and have expressed some appearance of sorrow and repentance,
only he who has broke his back is in most danger, as it is reported, to escape
it, God give him grace to call for mercy, and give us all grace to trust in
him, God bless the King and Parliament, and bless this poor kingdom, the Lord
remove all our troubles, deliver us from all our enemies, and settle us in
peace.

The Copy of a Letter of dangerous consequence, discovering the bloody Tragedy
to have been acted on Sunday the fifth of March, intercepted at one of the
Courts of Guard of the City of London.
Worthy Sir,
I Have defired at this time to make you acquainted with a secret work we have
now in agitation; which if it should be discovered we are all undone, but if it
take effect, we are all made for ever, for then three Kingdoms are as good as
our own: the thing is th^^ If you and your friends can but procure men enou^^
well armed on Sunday the fifth of March, to rise all (...) one hour, about
three of the clock after noon, an^ go in three parts, one to Saint Mary
Maudlins, one to St. Toolis, and one to St. Mary Overies, for at these Parishes
do the Roundheads meet; and when you come there slay man, woman, and child,
then let us alone for bringing the same thing to pass at the same hour in the
City, at the Dutch Church, at Tills A^church, at Sturries Walbrook, at S^msons
Thredneedle street, Calamies Aldermanbury Cordwells Lumbarstreet, Grays-In, and
diverse others which we have good intelligence of: Likewise without the City,
as at Westminster, where the Rebels meet, Evins Temple, bar, Stepney,
Whitechappell, and Aldgate, and by this time I hope they will be well shred. So
to conclude, I pray Worthy sir stay the messenger at yo^^ house a day or two,
and then send me word what you can do in this thing. One thing more to
encourage you and your friends is this: we have men come to is every day some
from France, and some from Ireland they come by 20, and 10, and 12, and 7, and
5 in a company, and two, and yet these Roundheadly Rogues cannot stay them: we
have friends in the Roundheads Army, both Commanders and Soldiers which makes
us hope for the day: There is Col. H. and two other which are our good friends,
therefore be not discouraged, but be vigilant in this cause, So in have I re^t.

FINIS.
