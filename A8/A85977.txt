A true and exact copy of Mr. Gibbons's Speech, which he intended to have
spoken immediately before his death, on the Scaffold at Tower Hill, AUGUST 22.
1651.
I Am brought upon the Stage, where I am a Spectacle to God, Angels, and Men;
an object of pity and compassion to my friends, whose eyes are come to behold a
man in the prime and flower of his years, in the height and excellency of his
strength, to be cut down by a violent stroke, as an unprofitable tree that
burdens the ground, therefore must stand no longer: it is nothing but Gods
ordinary way to suffer men to cast out, that he may receive: No sooner was the
blind man thrown out by the Pharisees, but he was received by Christ; the
three Children thrown into the fiery Furnace, are entertained and delivered by
God; it is no matter what the means is, if God take it into his hand, it shall
deliver his people: we have but one way into the world, but a thousand ways
out: could all the miseries of earth and hell be inflicted, if it leads to
Christ, a Christian must not go out of the way; how much more ought I to submit
to this my present condition, which God has chosen for me, as the best portion
I can possibly have! I bless God I come to this place with as much comfort as
ever the bridegroom received his bride: and though the passage be bloody, it is
the way to my crown: here my head is to be severed from my body, but my soul
shall be to all eternity joined to Christ; I wish that the present Power, and
that Court they have set up, have done themselves no more wrong, then they have
me, by their sentence of death, which is the means to bring me to the way, I am
now a going from earth to heaven, from friends, relations, and creature
comforts, which ere long I must of necessity have left, to receive the end of
my Faith, the reward of my Hope, the portion of the Saints, the perfection of
believers, the riches of eternity, the glory of heaven, which never can nor
shall be taken from me: Therefore farewell world, and all that I cannot keep,
and thrice welcome death, that puts me into the hands of a convoy of Angels,
that will carry me to my Fathers house, to receive an inheritance I shall never
part withal.

I do not come hither to tell a large story of my life, nor to make a discovery
of my sins, which I find upon the examination of my heart, to be so many and
wonderful, that nothing but eternity can be sufficient, to admire the
freeness of Gods grace, in receving me to mercy.

From my childhood I have seen affliction, I have seen a Father laid in the
grave, a Wife and Child in the grave, but never to this day could I put my sins
in the grave, which have been the great wounding of my heart; and this is
wonderful comfort to me, though I were to enjoy nothing else, that after this
day I shall never sin more. Ever since the time I can remember, I have set my
face toward heaven, and in the course of my life have endeavored to fence my
way with thorns, always desiring to go the most strictest, and straitest way
that might bring me to Christ.

In the Bishops time I did with a trembling soul behold the dying condition of
Religion, and then did often meet before the Lord to power out my soul and
complaints amongst others of Gods servants, for the great miseries and
oppressions that the Church and people of God lay under.

Ever since I had my knowledge, I have looked upon the Presbyterian Government
as the only most excellent Government, and have often thought it to be the
Chain spoken of in the Revelation, that shall bind the Devil a thousand years;
believing from my soul, that all the world is not able to find out a Government
that does so much advance Christ in his Throne, maintain Religion in its glory,
the Church in its rights, the people in their liberties, as that Government
does: and that no Government does so much curb profaneness, all sorts of
wickedness, errors and blasphemy, as the Presbyterian Government does; and
that no Government does so much cross corrupt nature, and call for exact
walking in all manner of holy conversation, as the Presbyterian Government
does. I am wonderfully confirmed it is of God, when I behold the multitudes and
universality of wicked men that oppose it, with the swarms of all sorts and
Sects, with all ranks and all manner of men, and old heresies that rise up
against it: I have always been for the Covenant, the force and ends thereof
upon Gospel principles. I have always ^one owning the ways of God and
Religion, when most clouded and despised, never daring to quit my principles
upon consideration or danger whatsoever, for the true cause of God, Religion
and liberty I have always been; upon these principles I have engaged, from
these principles I never departed; these are the principles in which I have
lived, these are the principles upon which I die, and do resolve by Gods grace
this day to seal the same with my blood, choosing rather a thousand times to
have my neck upon the Block, then to enjoy the most glorious life and liberty
with those that have most fearfully betrayed the cause of God, and Religion,
their own souls and consciences, by their most horrible Apostasy; to the great
dishonor of God, and scandal of Religion: let them put what dress or mask
they will upon it, when God shall rend and tear it off, discover and rip up the
intentions of their hearts, men will see, and themselves shall know what it
must cost to lose a good conscience. I never was without a trembling spirit,
nor a heart to lament while the Spouse of Christ was clothed in mourning. I
have always been so far from daring to make merry at such a time, that I
thought it not only my duty, but the least I could do, to lie in tears while
the Church was rolling in blood; it has been one of my greatest afflictions,
that I never yet could get a heart sensible enough to mourn, as I ought for the
great desolation, havoc and ruin that is this day made amongst all the
Churches of God. Lord deliver all those that fear thy Name, from the number of
such as can rejoice, keep days of Thanksgiving, and make Songs of triumph for
the number of those that are slain for the Testimony which they hold. I am at
last brought to suffer death as an enemy to the State, though a friend to Jesus
Christ, his Church and Members: The Jews told Pilate he was no friend to
Caesar, if he did let Christ go; the case is now altered, for whosoever
desires to keep Christ, his Truth and Laws, the Covenant and the ends thereof,
and let sin and wickedness go and stand in opposition to error and heresy,
are declared enemies to the State; and if there be no Law of God nor man to
condemn us, then like the Jews they find out a Law, and by that Law they tell
us we ought to die. I shall make no large discourse of the manner of of my
Trial, for I know there were both eye and ear witnesses, that will declare to
posterities following all the hard measure that I had, besides I have left
something behind to be printed, which will publish to the world upon what
slight grounds and slender Testimonies I lose my life; those that writ for me
had their books taken away, whereby I was cut off from all possible means from
making a defense when I came before them: I declared all this again and again,
most earnestly craved a Copy of my Charge, the Copy of the Depositions of the
Witnesses and Counsel assigned: when no Arguments nor means could move them to
grant me this, I did choose rather to submit to the mercy of the Court then
plead, so that all I could do, was to put up an appeal to the Court, being
denied means, could never make any defense, but my defense is of God, that
saves the upright in heart: the Court adjorned; the next time I came before
them I received the Sentence of death.

Here I must crave leave to discharge my conscience, concerning a Petition in
my name sent to Westminster, that acknowledged the Sentence to be just; I could
not withstand my friends persuasions, but according to their desires a Petition
was sent, the which I neither writ, nor would ever set my name for without
wounding of my conscience, I cannot say (to gain the world) it is a just
sentence, but am clear of an opinion, with that Gentleman that was both ear and
eyewitness of my Trial, and understood both the Laws and their Acts as well
as any, from his knowledge did declare, that he would not have had a hand in my
Sentence for as much gold as could lie in Westminster Hall, Let them declare,
write a thousand books to blind the world and justify themselves, if they do
not repent of this days work, both God, Angels, and Men, (with the blond that
is this day spilt) will witness against them: as I do verily persuade my self,
that before this time, never such a Sentence passed upon English ground, so
from my soul and conscience I do declare they have committed a horrible
murder, and without repentance make as sad an account to God for my blood, as
Cain must one day for Abels.

I do believe it would be more pleasing to God, if they did send the soldiers
to the prisoners Chambers, and cut their throats, then under a color to bring
them to a Trial before such a Court, that carries a face of Justice, when
there is nothing but murder and destruction to be expected from them.

I do not speak this from a bitter spirit, the Lord knows I do freely forgive
them, and desire from my soul they may have hearts to repent; for both in the
Sentence, and all other things, I read both the will and goodness of God; I
look upon them as a company of poor instruments, which God knows well enough
how to deal with; therefore it is both my duty, and the duty of all those that
love God, to pray for them, to pity their condition, and not envy it.

I would not leave this Scaffold to enjoy their lives, and have that account
they must make, for all the worlds glory; better to have my neck upon the
Block, then to have my conscience upon the rack.

As freely do I forgive the Witnesses, the Lord lay not the great sins they
have committed to their charge; I hope they will one day see it is better to be
in a suffering condition, then in a sinful; and that wrath and sin is more to
be feared, then any misery whatsoever; they have bought their life's and
liberties dear enough, therefore let none be angry, it is the will of God,
lament their estate and pray for them.

I am here brought to die for Treason and complotting against the State, and
such a plot have they proclaimed to the world, as the like has not been for
many years.

Here I do concur, and am of their opinion, that there is a very great plot,
and so great, that a plot must be pretended to beget greater plots; that is, to
destroy the Presbyterian Government, the whole race of the Ministry, and those
that desire to keep a good conscience, and truly fear God; this lies at the
bottom, whatsoever is held forth: for any plot that ever I had, or any of my
friends accused, and the Ministers had, I know none that I thought worth any
thing: I am sensible how many millions of sins I have committed, the which I
have seen before me, and on the right hand and on the left, every way piled up,
till they are swelled to such a magnitude, that they exceed the highest
mountains for greatness: so you see that I have not wanted sins to power out
floods of tears upon; but for this thing I am accused for, and now brought to
die, I cannot only plead my innocence, but put up my Appeal to the great God,
who is a most impartial Judge, (unto whose Bar I am now a going to receive a
righteous Judgment) that I never had any other end in all this business laid
to my charge, but the honor of God, his Gospel and Religion; all which were
so dear unto me, that when I saw the wonderful and horrible scandal that the
late actions of a generation of men had thrown upon the face of Religion and
Gospel. I told a Gentleman now with God, in the hearing of some living, that
so deeply did the honor of God suffer, the honor of the Gospel and cause of
Religion, in the eyes of all reformed Churches, in the eyes of Papists, in the
eyes of Turks and Heathens, that happy for England would it be, if any means
might be found to wash off the scorn, contempt, and stains cast upon the
Gospel and Religion; yea though it were with the blood of Ministers, it would
be cause of rejoicing in the eyes of all that fear the Lord. Who can tell but
this days work is the way unto it; all that I have mourned for was that
Religion suffered; all that ever I prayed for, was that Christ might have the
Government in his hand; all that ever I endeavored for, was to bring things
back into the channel where God would have them: all that I have done and
defired, was that there might be a restoration of the honor of the Gospel,
the truth of Religion, the Laws, Liberties and Privileges of the People: And
though I were but clay and spittle, I knew in the hands of God I might be
isntrumental, always thought it my duty to bring something, though it were
but a handful of goats hair, if any way I might be useful and contribute
toward the help of the Church, and the relief of Gods people from under their
great oppressions: this is all that I have done, and that I must this day die
for; what a thousand pens write is no matter, but what God and Conscience
write, that shall stand: I am most assured this days work will be written in
heaven, suffering for the Lord Jesus and his Truth: I have the testimony of my
conscience, for whatever I have done concerning this, and can die with
abundance of peace, and go to God with comfort: this you are to believe from
the mouth of a dying man, and not regard what a company of engaged men declare
to make for their interest, who go contrary to all rules of Conscience,
neither know how to show mercy to Christians while they live, nor to their
names when they are dead. I cannot but wonder that the men in power can look
any Christian in the face, and tell him of a plot, who have been the original
and foundation of those plots that have torn Nations and Kingdoms apieces, rent
asunder all Laws, Ordinances, Government, Liberties, Privileges, Proprieties,
and whatsoever is dear either to Christians or rational men, and thrown three
Kingdoms into that misery, that all the enemies in the world could not have
done the like without them; but rather how will they be able to stand and look
God in the face, when they shall come to reckon for this, and make Inquisition
for blood? unto whose doors will all the desolations, blood and ruin of
Scotland and Ireland return for these three or four last years? who amongst us
living, that knows not some three years since, we had the most glorious
promising bright morning that ever looked England in the face, all our heads
and hands listed up, and our hearts raised with expectations to receive the
reward of many years sufferings and prayers, and to be paid for the expense of
all the blood.

After all this how comes it to pass, we behold with our eyes such horrible
days of darkness, breaking and treading down, after such hopes of seeing
England clothed with glory and peace, and become like the garden of Edev; how
comes it to be an Aceldama, a Golgotha, a field of blood, and place of dead
men's sculls? after our Ship was thus brought to the harbot, with all the life's,
liberties, and safeties of three Kingdoms: Who were they that were the
instruments to throw it back into so miserable a stormy Sea, as the Lord knows
whether man or child living upon the earth shall ever see it get out again?
they which have done this are plotters indeed, plotters with a Witness; these
are the Egiptians that all the people of God, and all the reformed Churches in
Christendom groan under; these (like Nero) have set all on sire, and would
fain lay it upon the Christians, like as the Papists plot and contrive, lay
barrels of gunpowder to blow up King, Lords, and House of Commons, and when
they have done they intend to lay it upon the Puri^anes but God will not be
mocked, early or late he will find them out, and make them know what the lives
of innocents are worth, and what undermining of States, and all such actions as
those must cost.

Many delightful sights has Antichrist seen; the massacre of Paris was a
glorious sight in the eyes of Antichrist; the piles of wood that burnt so many
Martyrs in QMaries-time, and all the streams of blood that were then let out of
the hearts of Gods people, was a most beloved fight in the eyes of Antichrist.

The persecution in the Bishops time, the imprisoning and banishing of Gods
people and Ministers, the carriage of three Worthies to the Pillory, and
cutting off their ears, was a pleasing sight in the eyes of Antichrist: The
breaking asunder the Parliament, throwing down the House of Lords, tearing the
Members out of the House of Commons, putting the King to death, and
over-turning all the Laws and Government of the Nation, engaging all the people
as well in a necessity of sinning, as perishing, and then invade the Church of
Scotland; kill and slay the precious of the Lord; these, and such sights as
these are very rare in the eyes of Antichrist; the plucking down of Magistracy
and Ministry, the letting loose of the Chain of Error and Heresy, the
discountenancing of truth and faithful Ministers, tolerating of all manner of
false Doctrine and damnable blasphemers, is a most delightful sight in the eyes
of Antichrist; these and many such sights has Antichrist seen; but the most
joyful sight that ever his eyes beheld, is the late proceedings of the present
Power, in tearing Ministers from their Congregations, locking up both them and
many more of the Lords people in prison, for nothing but endeavoring to keep
that Covenant which they have made them to swear, representing their office and
persons under that contempt and scorn, that they serve for nothing else but
signs and wonders, being made a butt and mark for all invenomed arrows reproach
and scorn to be shot at, as the like was never seen by English eyes till now;
but yet a more joyful sight do the eyes of Antichrist behold, such a one (I
dare say) as he never saw in England before; that is a most faithful Minister
and blessed servant of God put to death by Protestants, and such as call
themselves the most pious religious people upon the earth. Next to him I am
brought upon the Stage to encounter with death, and fight the bloody battle:
the Lord knows how many may follow; I pray that I may be the last; but is not
Johabs hand in this? are not the hands of Papists and Jesuits in all this? I
need bring no arguments to persuade you to believe it; I think very few but are
convinced, that they both sit at the Stern, and are the chiefest actors:
therefore whatsoever they do must needs be very delightful in the eyes of
Antichrist; as they are joyful lights to Antichrist, so are they the most
saddest sights that ever Gods people beheld.

O blessed God, say they, is all the expense of our blood, and all our
mourning, fasting, and prayer come to this? after such hopes of healing, have
we such wounds made in our souls, such peircing swords put into our bowels? is
there nothing will serve the turn but the death of Gods Ministers, the blood of
his people? had it been any thing else I could have born it; but to see such
precious blood spilt like water upon the ground, it goes so near the heart of
me, that I see my self cut off from all that should be a comfort to me.

I go in to my closet, I can find no comfort there; if I go to my friends I can
receive no comfort from them; if I look upon my children; then my heart is
filled with woe and misery, to think what will become of them, and there I lie
down in sorrow, and rise up in sorrow, and know not what to do: I confess such
things as these, and such a sight as you have this day seen, is matter of great
lamentation, and bless God that you can mourn for it, for of this side hell, I
cannot think any more miserable, then those that can rejoice at such sights as
these. But have a care your mourning be not a discontented mourning,
quarrelling with God and his Providence; repining and murmuring at the
instruments; do you as Jacob did, look who stands upon the top of the ladder,
and (like Ezekiel) see who stands upon the top of the well, and do not look at
the hammer that smites, nor at the next stop of the ladder, but look up to God,
that orders and directs all, who is infinitely wise, and knows best how to
contrive and bring things about for the good of his Church and people: do you
your duty, and trust God; though you see all the Providence of God crossing
his promises, still wait; if you should never understand them here, stay until
you come in heaven, there you will know the meaning of every cross working,
and then see that none of all the Churches sufferings nor afflictions of the
Saints could have been spa^ed: while you are here alive and depend upon
promises, and not providence; do not forget, that when God is a pulling down,
he is a setting up; when he seems to make the greatest wounds, he comes with
the greatest healing; when he holds forth the greatest destruction, he intends
the greatest deliverances; he came to Jacob like an enemy, to destroy, when he
was resolved to show the greatest friendship. I am most confident, all that
your eyes have seen this day, is also for your good, and the way to your
deliverance, and that our bloods shall set the enemies a horseback, and pur
spur to their destruction: I am most assured some standing in this place shall
here, and to all eternity bless God for this days work: The most ^icked of
men may behold the sufferings of Gods people, but they cannot see the comforts
they have they may see their mournings and rears, but they cannot see the
Towell that Jesus Christ wipes their eyes withal: since the Creation to this
present day, there was never any suffered Martyrdom for the testimony of a
good conscience, but God came with strength and comfort according to their
condition, and now they are in heaven: I do fully persuade my self, these of
them that died the worst of deaths, would have died no other, nor have abated
any of their sufferings or reproaches for a thousand worlds: Were we but
sensible of the infinite glory God gets by the sufferings of his people, did we
but know how many flowers and precious pearls it adds to their Crown, we should
see men come running as fast to Martyrdom, as our eyes now see them running
from it; the very first moment that we behold the face of God, will be a
sufficient reward for a thousand times more, then ever we have, or can suffer
here, though there were nothing else to be enjoyed, but Christ owning their
souls at the day of Judgment, it were enough to engage a Christian to own
Christ here, though his sufferings were to be like the torments of hell, when
we come to know and taste of the infinite rewards that God has prepared for his
suffering people, it heaven were capable of shame, we would be ashamed we have
done and suffered so little for Christ; therefore give me leave to persuade
you; and let the last words of a dying man prevail with you, that you let go
all, rather then part with your Principles; better the heavens should fall, and
the whole world be set of fire, then that God should lose his honor, or the
least jot or tittle of the truth be parted with; fly from error, though it
come in the habit and dress of Saints and Angels, error is like barrells of
gunpowder, that will blow up States, Kingdoms, souls and bodies: whosoever
takes up error, draws a sword against Christ, his Truth, and Laws; if you do
but countenance one step, the least from the truth, you are in danger of
falling into a gulf that will swallow you up; ask but your own experience, and
that will tell you, many glorious Stars and Professors, that for some
self ends at the first did go but a little aside from the truth, but there they
did not stay, but run from one error to another, searching all the rooms in
hell to find out new ones: for never could any rest that follow error, it is
like hell without any bottom: how many Ministers have you seen heretofore, you
could have lived and died withal, gone but a little astray from the truth, by
which they have given a greater blow to the honor of God and Religion, then
all their Sermons and Preaching can do good while they live; did you ever see
any go aside from the truth, but he got a blot and dishonor upon his name;
Truth has called Kings and Emperors to honor, the meanest of persons
therefore, though you see thousand and ten thousand run to error, hold you to
the Truth, if you love your souls, bodies, land, est^^e, wife, children, part
not with the least of it, follow neither Christian nor Minister any further
then he follows Christ, not wonder it you see those that have appeared to be
the most eminent in knowledge and grace, go from the truth to error, for from
the beginning it has been so, and God does suffer the same to try his people.
I must needs acknowledge that error is now clothed with so smooth a dress,
that i^ makes my heart to bleed to think of the harvest the devil will have;
but in all Ages God has preserved a remnant, and so he does still, blessed be
God that there are a few, some of all sores both Ministers and people, that
have kept their garments unspotted, never yet stained with error. All you that
love God, be of the number of those few, though you suffer and die with them:
every Error is a Chain that binds your Soul and Conscience, that you cannot go
to God: every error is a Bar that makes fast the doo^ against Christ and his
Laws; therefore: hold and keep close to the truth: look upon Athanasius that
owned the truth when the whole world was against it: be like Amos, who kept
close to God when a whole Court was against him, or like Martin Luther, that
owned the truth of God alone, against all the power and force of Antichrist: in
all Ages, even in the most damnable apostatizing times, God has had some that
have dared to own his truth: if Baal be God, follow him; but if the Lord be
God, follow him: Naboths Vineyard is taken away, and his inheritance taken
possession of; but God is so far from approving of it, that he sends in Elisha
with an arrant of vengeance: have not our eyes seen, and our ears heard more
abominable practices in our times? the head of our Country, the breath of our
nostrills, the anointed of the Lord, by a violent death, is taken away from us:
so dreadful was this stroke, that it struck at the root of all Laws and
Religion, and murdered the honor and repute of the whole Race of the
Protestant Profession: so far are the sons of abomination from blushing, or
being ashamed at this, that they go on, take possession, and justify the same
before God and all the world; and when the Heir is coming, they combine
together and say, Come let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours for
ever. This does call upon us that fear the Lord, to wish their heads fountains
of tears, that they might power out rivers of sorrow. It have been to me
living, and shall be now dying, a great lamentation.

I do profess unto you all, I am so far from approying of any of the late
actions, that I would not have dared to have gone so far out of Gods way, to
have had the least hand in the death of the King, no not to have saved the
lives of all the three Kingdoms. That God that has written down all their
actions and intentions, will one day clear the Presbyterian Party, and
vindicate their Innocence before the face of all the whole world, and though
for the present their interest be lost with men, it is found in God, and there
shall be a most glortous Resurrection of all their names and integrity, when
God comes to reckon with those men that have made use of their honest
endeavors, to plow up the Lords Vineyard, and let in the wild Bore of the
Forest: this is now both a black and bloody day of Jacobs trouble; all the
Churches of Christ in the Furnace, the poor Church of Scotland, a bleeding,
fetching their dying groans. Is there none to pity none to help? nor none that
will consider my distress? was there ever any affliction llike my affliction?
I am smitten in the place of Dragons, I have my bowels torn out by those that
I have brought forth and maintained; the men whose hands I have strengthened
have slain my young men, by hundreds and thousands, and carried them away
captiffs: those who I have been isntrumental to save, have destroyed all my
peace and glory; and laid my honor in the dust; robbed me of my Jewels,
robbed me of my Ordinances, robbed me of all my riches, and treasury, and made
all the Land drunk with the blood of my slain; and that which is ten thousand
times worse, they have poisoned the souls of my people with error and Heresy,
every one of these have a noise crying in the ears of God and men.

I read of a bitter curse pronounced against those that came not out to the
help of the Lord against the mighty; God has given that poor Nation a bloody
Cup to drink; but most assured I am, all the dregs lie at the bottom, for all
those persons that come not forth with their prayers and tears to improve all
their interest both in heaven and earth, for the deliverance of that miserable
oppressed people; if it be terrible to all such as come not out with their
swords to help and rescue them; if God will be avenged upon all such persons as
stand looking on, what will the portion be of all such that do not only draw
their swords against that beloved people, but put them into their bowels, and
proclaim to all the world they do God good service; and when they have laid
heaps upon heaps, and died the Church with their blood, they do not only
rejoice and triumph, but hang up colors for monuments of their lasting glory:
such as these are Monsters with a Witness; therefore let all those that love
either bodies or souls, rather choose ten thousand times to live in a howling
wilderness, to be cast into a Den of Dragons, then either to countenance
encourage, or remain amongst the numbers of those men; throughout all the book
of God, amongst all the prayers of the Saints, you find none like David,
putting forth all his strength with the utmost of his vehemence, improving all
his interest to pluck down wrath and vengeance out of the hands of God; against
who was it, but a cursed generation of men that persecuted those whom the Lord
had smitten? the Sun shined upon Sodom, and presently after they were destroyed
by most terrible showers of fire and brimstone; all the prosperity and
flourishing estate of the wicked, is but like a watery Sun, that will end in a
dismal cloudy day: The people of God may sit a while in darkness, but they
are sure there will be light; the wicked may rejoice for a moment, it is not
long, but they will have an eternal stormy night of Gods displeasure, that
shall never be blown over: I know a child of God had rather have all the Lions
of the Wilderness roaring upon him, all the miseries in the world, and all the
devils in hell let loose, then to live under the frowns of God; how can thou
then envy the state of the wicked, though they did prosper as much as
Alexander, enjoyed as much peace and glory as Solomon, ride with as much state
as Caesar did through Rome, when thou know they are under the frowns of an
infinite God, that hates them with as perfect a hatred, as he does the devils
in hell, and knows well enough how and when it is seasonable to bring a most
terrible destruction upon them, that shall fly as far, and ring as loud in the
ears of all the Christian world, as their sins and abominations have done: The
bush may burn, but it shall not be consumed; the devil has been above this
five thousand six hundred years a breathing out flames and persecutions against
the Churches of God, and yet it remains; and so it shall be to the end of the
world; mourn for the sufferings of our dear brethren of Scotland, give them all
possible assistance by prayers and tears, and what else possible you may, but
never despair of their deliverance; for one look of God out of the Cloud can
break all the power of their enemies, and make a glorious Resurrection of them,
and all the Churches of Christ; mourn and lament with an exceeding bitter
lamentation for the reproach, scorn and contempt that the Ministry lies under;
pray mightily that they may be delivered from many and great temptations, and
the multitudes of traps and snares that the subtilty of the adversary has
laid, that they may destroy their offices and persons together.

You that make mention of the Lord, never give him rest, but cry and pray
mightily; for there are wonderful promises to be accomplished, wonderful
things to be done, the fall of Babylon with all the power of Antichrist; the
calling of the Jews, which will be the fulness of the Gentiles, the
perfecting and coming in of all the glory of the Churches of Christ, the
shaking of Nations and Kingdoms is the way to this; therefore be not
discouraged, for Jacob shall arise, God is never more in his way to bring all
this about, but when he seems to be most out of it.

Thus I have both endeavored to declare and discharge my conscience, I have
nothing now to do, but to take my leave of the world, where I do again forgive
all that have been the instruments to bring me to this place; heartily I desire
that they may have mercy and forgiveness at the hand of God, when they have
most need of it: I know it is the hand of God that has brought me to this
place, and that all things are under his Seal, that neither death, nor any
thing else can come without his Commission; it is not the death I am now to
think upon, but that which follows after: I am now presently to lunch into the
gulf of eternity, never shall come back more, to call over this life. I am
going with a naked soul to stand before God, whose eyes are ten thousand times
brighter then the Sun, that will never behold the least iniquity: the very
thoughts of this God would be as terrible as devouring flames of fire, did not
I behold him in the merits and mercies of a Savior, sitting at his right hand,
making intercession for me; his righteousness is more able to save, then all
the sins of men and devils can be to send to hell; had I all the
righteousness of men and Angels, woe and ten thousand woes be unto me, if I
had not an interest in the righteousness of my blessed Savior, and then had I
all the sins since the Creation of the world laid to my charge, it is as easy
for me to have a pardon in blood of Christ for them all, as for one vain
thought: all my righteousness is as filthy rags, sin enough there is in my
best prayers and performances, for ever to throw me out of the presence of God
into hell. I have scarlet crimson sins, sins of all sorts, but through faith in
the merits of my Savior I have a sure confidence, grounded upon promises, and
the Covenant of Free Grace, that I shall now suddenly rest in the Lord, and
enter into my Masters joy, where I shall never to all eternity to praise him;
blessed be God and blessed be his people for the benefit, help and support I
have had by their prayers; the archers have both grieved and shot at me, but my
bow has abode in strength, and the arrows of my hands have been made strong by
the hands of the mighty God the Lord, return a thousand-fold all the love and
kindness, with the reward of those prayers that have been made for me into the
bosom of his own people: the last prayer that Sampson made, was that the Lord
would remember him, and strengthen him, only once more, it is the last request
that ever I shall make unto you that are the Lords Remembrancers; therefore be
not wanting unto me now at the last act of my life, only help me this once, it
is the last time that ever you shall pray for me, the last sigh, the last tear
that ever you shall shed to do me good; stir and quicken up your graces, act
your faith in God, improve all your interest at the Throne of grace; take
notice who brought, and what was thrown into the Churches treasury, the eyes of
God run to and fro through the world, he looks upon every heart this day, and
sees who pities me, who prays and st^ives to help me through this bloody
passage; who use their utmost endeavors to strengthen my heart and hands io
encounter with death: it is usual for you to do the last things best, when you
give last, to give most: deal so with me this day, put out all your might and
strength to bring me safe off this Scaffold to my Fathers house, for it is the
last time that ever I shall need your prayers and help.

Most gracious God into thy hands I commit my Spirit, I was never yet in
distress, but thou did comfort me, never yet in want, but thou did
receive me, therefore I know thou will not fail to help me in this my needful
time of trouble. O blessed Savior! thou have sought after me when I was
running from thee, therefore I am confident thou will receive me now I am
coming to thee: Though death be my portion by sin, eternal life is my purchase
by thy righteousness: though my sins should exceed the number of millions of
Ages, yet I know thy merits and righteousness is ten thousand times more
exceeding; upon this rock do I anchor my hope, and with this assurance do I
die.

Mr. Gibbons's last Prayer, in the hearing of the People.
O Most blessed and glorious Lord God, a God of piercing eyes, and see me thy
poor creature thou know the intention of my heart; then hear the words of my
mouth, but thou know the intentions of my soul. O Lord put words into my
mouth what I should speak for my self; now is the last time that ever I shall
speak, till I come to speak and admire thee to eternity. O blessed God! O what
is a smile of thy face now! O one smile is more vvorth then ten thousand
worlds. O blessed God! before my head is severed from my body, let me be
assured that my soul shall be received into thy hands. O blessed God! let me
find now the benefit of all the prayers and tears, and desire of my heart.
Lord it is true, I have nothing to plead, I have not a handful of Goats hair,
I have nothing but a dead dull heart; but Lord, though I be broken and
distracted, thou looked'st upon Hezekiah with his chattering prayers, when he
chattered as a Crane'; blessed Lord, look upon the Lord Jesus Christ, and
whatsoever imperfections thou have seen in me pardon them, and vvash me from
them in his blood; Lord, though I had never sinned before I came to this
Scaffold, yet I have committed sin enough here to throvv me into everlasting
burning: but Lord, look for thy promise sake, for thy mercy sake, look over thy
bovvells of compassion, consult with them now, and with thine Attributes,
and whatsoever Christ and Mercy may speak, hear the cries this day.

Blessed God, there is no reason that thou should own me, but there is
reason thou should own thy promise, and own thy truth, and own thy Christ. O
blessed God! grant that this day all thy people may bless thee, and may go and
keep a day of Thanksgiving, that I have not carried my self any way unbecoming
a Christian; Lord, let me give thee the glory, I am but poor dust and ashes,
and clay, the unworthiest in the world, all my strength is nothing; I bless
God I am n^w coming where I shall need Faith no more, nor Hope no more, O (...)
let me act all the strength I have in thy Promise, and in the Lord Jesus Christ
s^e particular promise, O Lord show thy self, O one smile for the Lord Jesus
Ch^i^ts sake. I commend all unto thee, I lay my neck upon the Block, I give my
soul into thy hands, take my soul, it is no matter what becomes of my body, I
shall never more, never more hope for any thing, or desire any thing, but all
my soul shall be filled up; Lord hear me, and help me, and stand by me, and
strengthen me, and guide me, and pardon and forgive all my sins for the Lord
Jesus Christ's sake.

His prayer being ended, he put off his dubblet, and ask't for his Noble Friend
Dr. Bastwick, and embraced him: after that he embraced his Uncle, and others of
his friends on the Scaffold; then laying his head on the Block, Dr. Bastwick
came to him, and wished him to take off his Rings, which accordingly he did, by
ra^sing himself upon his knees, and gave them to his Uncle; which done, he laid
his head on the Block, and holding up his left hand, the Executioner at one
blow (and a small raze) severed his head from his body.

FINIS.
