IT is this day Ordered by the Committee of the House of Commons in Parliament,
concerning printing, that this book, entitled the Kingdoms Case) be printed
by John Wright.

LONDON, Printed for John Wright at the Kings head in the Old-bayley, 1649.

The Case.
FIve or ten thousand or more Persons, aggregate and assemble themselves
together, in a Warlike manner, with Officers and all provisions of War, and
go from Nottingham toward London, kill diverse of the Kings Subjects, rob,
steal, and take away the Goods of others, break into Towns and Honses by
force, and imprson diverse.

Upon this Case there are diverse Quaeres.

Quaere. Whether others of the Kings Subjects may not by the Laws of this
Kingdom of England, by all means whatsoever, whether by raising of Arms or
otherwise, endeanour to their uttermost, to apprehend, oppose, quell, and
vanquish, the aforesaid persons.

Answer. IT is not only lawful but commanded by the laws of this Kingdom,
that all persons able, should by all or any means whatsoever, endeavor to
apprehend oppose, quell, and vanquish the said persons, and if any present at
the aforesaid outrages, do not without command, or absent do not upon
command, endeavor to apprehend, oppose, quell, and vanquish the said persons;
they are punish able by the Laws of this Kingdom.

The Proof. 3 Edward 3. Itinere Northampton, Corone. 293. But by M. Lambert,

Much more, and a Fortiori, where the peace is broken, with a high hand, and in
such transcendent manner, as the present case is put; and every public Officer
as Sheriffs, Constable, etc. May and might to raise and leavie the power of the
County, Hundred, or Town, to repressed; or for the apprehending of Traitors,
Felons, etc. 3. Hen. 7.10. Dalton Office of Sheriffs, 136. And if they fail
in performance of their duties therein, they are to be fined and imprisoned; and
if any refuse to aid them therein, they are in like manner to be punished.

in terrorem populi Domini Regis, in amazement of the Kings Liege-People, and
so a riot, rout, and unlawful assembly. Now if the number of three or more
persons, assemble themselves together, to do an unlawful Act, all persons in
the County where the same assembly is, being able to travel, are to aid and
assist the Justices of the Peace and Sheriffs to resist, repel, and take such
offenders, and that under pain of imprisonment, fine, and pansome by the
statute 2 Hen. 5. cap. 8. a fortiori, where unlawful Acts are done, as in the
case put.

England, pasch. 39 of Eliz. of that multitude then assembled in warlike manner
to pull down Enclosures in those places, where they had no color to claim
Common, and so was adjudged by the whole Parliament, 29 Hen. 6. cap. 2 In Cades
Rebellion, that he was a Traitor, and the leavying of Arms within this
Kingdom in warlike manner without lawful cause, is Rebellion, and so Treason;
and so it is resolded, A bridgement of Dier 13. Eliz. 298.

Now by the Laws of this Land, all are bound to apprehend and take all Felons
and Traitors, under the penalties beforementioned; yea, I conceive, under
greater. For if A commit Treason, and B know it, and conceal it, it is
misprision of Treason, and he shall forefeit therefore all his goods, and the
profit of his Lands during his lite; and much more where he does ret use toasst
and in apprehending, and punishing the offenders* If the assemblers to pull
down Enclosures aforementioned, were adjudged Traitors, much more these Rebels
assembled to pull down the Enclosures, namely the fence of our Religion, Laws
and Liberties, viz. the Parliament, which is the only Fence and Guard we have
in this Kingdom, against ruin of Religion, Laws, and Liberties, the general
medicine, to cure all our grievances, the life of our lives and lively hoods.

And that this is the maine intention of this Rebellion appears, not only by
their own speeches, but also for that.









The principal Case, and all the other Cases in answer thereunto ate put, as
supposing the King not commanding, and then the conclusions thereupon are so
apparent, that all men that have their right senses will agree the same to be
the Common Laws of this Kingdom; therefore the Case is further put:

Admit that this Assembly is by the Kings command, and that others are
prohibited by the King to oppose them.

Quaere 2. What alterations are thereby made of the Conclusions aforesaid.

Answer. NOne at all.



And therefore His Majesty's command by word is not sufficient, but it must be
in all Cases to iustiste the party by or from some of his Courts of Justice, or
under some of His Majesty's Seals thereunto appointed, Co. Ma. Cha. 186. b.
187. for every His Majesty's Seals are appointed to each Court, as the Laws
of this Kingdom; have disposed, and every Seal will not serve in every case;
and therefore until the foresaid persons produce such warrant as is according
to Law, it is not only lawful but commanded by the Laws of this Kingdom,
that all persons able, should by all, or any means whatsoever, endeavor to
apprehend, oppose, quell, and vanquish the aforesaid persons assembled as
aforesaid, under the name of the Kings Army, which is proved by a familiar
Case, viz. a Capias issues to the Sheriff of S. to take A. ad respondendum,
etc. and before the taking, A. procures a protection or a Supersedeas, the
Sheriff of S. may justify the taking of him, until the showing of the
Protection or Supersedeas by A. unto him, and that the Protection or
Supersedeas do appear legal, both for the matter, manner, Court and Seal;
And if the Sheriff do not take him having fit opportunity, an Action of the
Case lies against him, he has broken his Oath, and is to be amerced,
notwithstanding these countermands concealed or kept in the pocket, and so in
the present case.



Because it is already proved, that this assembly, and demean or in it self
considered, is against Law in case the King command it not; now if a thing be
in it self against Law, the Kings command does not, nor cannot make it
lawful: For the Kings commands or prohibitions, against the known Laws of
the Kingdom are ipso facto void, and so says Bracton, Nihil aliud potest Rex,
quam quod de jure potest, and the rule is general as well in the Kings case,
as in the case of common persons, Quod contra legem fit, pro infecto habetur,
and the Actors and Erecutioners of these commands, are to be punished, as if no
such command or prohibition were.

For instance, The King commands A to arrest B without cause, (which is an
unlawful act) and A accordingly does arrest him; B may have an Action of false
imprisonment against A notwithstanding the Kings command, 16 Hen. 6. ^mrance de
faits, 182. So in like manner, if the King should command A to kill B. and he
accordingly should kill him, T. H. 8. Coron. 229.19 H. 6.63, etc. A may be
indicted at the Kings suit therefore, notwithstanding the Kings command, and
executed for the same, as if no such command had been.

In like manner, if the King should command A to kill a Judge of Assize, while
he is doing his Office, and he accordingly kill him, this is high Treason,
notwithstanding the Kings command, and the Indictment shall be contra
Legeanciae fuae debitum, against the duty of his Allegiance; for his duty of
Allegiance is only to obey the King in his commands according to Law, and not
contrary to Law: and if this be Treason, as it is by the Common Law, to kill a
Judge as before, then much more heinous Treason is it, to kill the Judges of
that Judge, which are the Lords and Commons in Parliament.

The same Law is, if the King command A to take away the Goods of B without
just cause, and A do accordingly, A shall therefore be punished, as if no such
command had been, as appears by the present experience of the late
Sheriffs, for taking away men's Goods for the Shipmoney; and by the Officers of
Monopolies, who have not in any manner been xcused for that they had the Kings
Command: and so is the ancient Experience of former times. 42 ass. 5.

If the Rebels in Ireland had, (as they pretend they have) the Kings Commission
for what they do, it would not in any manner abate or mitigate their offense,
but that it should be high Treason, and they to be apprehended and proceeded
against as if they had no such Commission: and the same Law is in the case put,
of the persons assembled here in England, in like Rebellious manner aforesaid.



As if the King grant a protection under the great Seal to I. N. directed to
the Sheriffs, and other Officers, commanding them that they shall not arrest
the said I. N. during one whole year, next ensuing at any man's suit, and this
per praerogativam nostram quam nolumus esse arguendam; yet if the Sheriff do
not arrest the said I. N. upon process against him, he shall be amerced, and
this command or prohibition of the Kings shall be no excuse to him; and so is
Co. Mag. Chart. 56. where particular cases are put to that purpose.

Quaere 3. BUt suppose the aforesaid persons, calling themselves the Kings
Army, were no Peace-breakers, Traitors, nor Felons, (as before we have proved
them to be) yet being so declared de facto, by the Judges of the Supreme
Court, viz. the Parliament: Whether are the Subjects of this Kingdom bound, by
the Laws of the same, to give credit to their Judgment, and so far to
believe them, as to endeavor to apprehend such persons so declared, and
proceed against them accordingly?

Answer. THey are.

quasi Jurisdictum, that is, the sentence or dictate of the Law, for the Court
is, as it were, the mouth of the Law, by which it speaks to all that are
within the jurisdiction of it; now we are bound to believe the sentence, or
dictates of the Law; when they are thus uttered unto us* without disputing or
examination; for that these Courts are entrusted by the Laws, to utter and
express their sense in the cases, that are within their cognizance and
jurisdiction.

Therefore if the Lords and Commons in Parliament Assembled, make an Ordinance
or Declaration, that is their Judgment, and binds all persons within the
Jurisdiction of the Court, until it be reversed, which must only be done in
Parliament, and so is the express book of 8 Hen. 4.14.



If I. S. a man free from all Felony, be outlawed for Felony, which is but a
Declaration by and before the Coroners, which are of the most inferior sort of
Judges of Record, in this Kingdom; every Subject i^ bound, so far to
believe, and credit the said Judgment to be true, that he is not to receive,
relieve, or comfort the said J. S. if he do, knowing the said Outlawry, or
living in the County where the said Outlawry was proclaimed, whereby he is
bound to take notice thereof, at his peril; he is accessory to the said
Felony, 12 E. 2. Coron. 377. which is cited 19 Eliz. die. 355. And the very case
of Attainder by Parliament is put, 1 Hen. 7.4. v. where diverse then elected as
Knights and Burgesses of the then intended Parliament, had been attainted by a
former Parliament, held 10 Rich. 3. in which book it is resolved by the Judges
there, that the persons so attainted, could not by the King, or otherwise be
discharged thereof, but by reversing it in Parliament, though it were done in
the time of an Usurper, and without any just cause: And no doubt, if any had
apprehended any of those persons, so declared Traitors, before the reversal of
the Attainder, or the said I. S. Outlawed as aforesaid, he might well justify
it, and was not any way for to be punished: Nay, had any refused to apprehend
any of those persons attainted, or I. S. outlawed as aforesaid, he should
therefore be justly liable to the punishment aforesaid.

The Law of England gives so much credit to every

And therefore it was lately held, by the Judges of the Kings Bench, in the
Lord Says Case for the Shipmoney; that it being resolved by the mayor part of
the Judges of England in the Exchequor Chamber, for the King; That that
Judgment standing in force, the same matter was not to be brought in question
again, nor to be disputed though betwixt other parties; and therefore refused
to hear the Lord Says counsel, except they had new matter not resolved
before: and some of the Judges then affirmed, that that, and every such
Judgment by all the Judges, is as it were an Act of Parliament to bind the
Subject, and is in as much force until the, same be reversed, which must be in
Parliament, and no where else as accordingly since, the said judgment in the
case of Shipmony has been so that as all men were bound up, by the said
Judgment, now by the reversall thereof all men are at large, and the King
thereby as much bound as the Subject was before; Whereupon we may see how
deeply it concerns the Subjects of this Kingdom, to have frequent
Parliaments, to review the Judgments of interior Courts, and also to have
honest and able Judges chosen into the places of Judicature; and that such of
them as offend may be punished according to their demerit, and that, that
punishment may not be dispensed with.

Hen. 4. to Gascoigne, his then Chief Justice and remembered 7 H. 4.14. which
was, That one kills another in the presence of the said Chief Justice, and a
third man which is not guilty, is by the verdict of twelve men found guilty;
what the law in that case were? to which the Chief Justice made answer, That
he ought to respite the Judgment therein, and petition His Majesty for his
pardon: so that the verdict does and must stand in force against both King and
Subject, and the Kings command by word or affirmation, to the contrary is of no
effect. And if the the said Judge had not had particular knowledge, who it was
that killed that man, then he ought to have given Judgment, without any delay;
or if he had given Judgment, and the party against whom such Judgment was
given, was apprehended or executed by any Officer that Officer, and all
assisting him therein, had been freed from all blame, and were not any way to
be punish^d: Nay, if the Officer had not done his Office, or others had not
assisted him therein, both he and they had been subject to punishment, in
manner aforesaid.

Co. 10.76. in the Case of the Marshall sea, viz. that where a Court has
Jurisdiction of the cause, but proceeded erroneously, or against Law, to a
Judgment that all Officers and others employed in execution of that Judgment,
are to be excused; and whatsoever they do therein is lawful, and justifiable,
and may not be admitted to dispute or question the illegality thereof; so that
upon the whole matter it appears, That the supreme and highest Court of
Record in the Kingdom, which has Jurisdiction over all Courts and Causes,
namly; the Parliament, Declaring the aforesaid Assembly to be disturbers of the
Peace, Traitors, Felons, andt. That their Judgment does and must stand in
force, until it be reversed; and all Officers and others are bound to further
the execution of that their Judgment, and to do their commands, and the
commands of the Law, touching the same, and are by the same Law justified
therein.

And hereupon it appears that Quacumque via data, the first conclusion
stands firm, viz. that it is not only lawful, but commanded by the Laws of
this Kingdom, that all persons able, should by all or any means whatsoever,
endeavor to apprehend, oppose, quell, and vanquish, the said persons assembled
in manner as aforesaid, notwithstanding the Kings Command or Prohibition,
Commune periculum, commune auxilium petit.

FINIS.
