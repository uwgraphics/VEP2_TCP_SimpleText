THis Apologeticall Narration of our Reverend and dear Brethren the learned
Authors of it, it is so full of peaceablenesse, modesty, and candor; and
withal, at this time so seasonably needful, as well toward the vindication
of the Protestant party in general, from the aspersions of Incommunicablenesse
within it self, and Incompatiblenesse with Magistracy; as of themselves in
particular, both against misreportings from without, and some possible
mistakings from within too: That however for mine own part I have appeared on,
and do still incline to the Presbyteriall way of Church Government, yet do I
think it every way fit for the Press.

AN Apologeticall Narration, HVMBLY SVBMITTED TO THE HONORABLE HOUSES OF
PARLIAMENT.

LONDON, Printed for ROBERT DAWLMAN. M. DC. XLIII.

AN APOLOGETICALL NARRATION OF SOME MINISTERS, Formerly in Exile: NOW Members
of the Assembly of Divines.
OUR ears have been of late so filled with a sudden and unexpected noise of
confused exclamations, (though not so expressly directed against us in
particular, yet in the interpretation of the most, reflecting on us) that
awakened thereby, we are enforced to anticipate a little that discovery of our
selves which otherwise we resolved to have left to Time and Experience of our
ways and spirits, the truest Discoverers and surest Judges of all men and
their actions.

And now we shall begin to make some appearance into public light, unto whose
view and judgments should we (that have hitherto lain under so dark a cloud
of manifold mis apprehensions) at first present our selves, but the Supreme
Judicatory of this Kingdom, which is and has been in all times the most just
and severe Tribunal for guiltiness to appear before, much more to dare to
appeal unto; and yet withal the most sacred refuge and Asylum for mistaken
and mis-judged innocence?

The most, if not all of us, had ten years since (some more, some less)
several settled Stations in the Ministry, in places of public use in the
Church, not unknown to many of your selves; but the sinful evil of those
corruptions in the public worship and government of this Church, which all
do now so generally acknowledge and decrie, took hold upon our consciences
long before some others of our brethren; And then how impossible it was to
continue in those times our service and standings, all men's apprehensions will
readily acquit us.

Neither at the first did we see or look further then the dark part, the evil
of those superstitions adjoined to the worship of God, which have been the
common stumbling block and offense of many thousand tender consciences, both in
our own and our neighbor Churches, ever since the first Reformation of
Religion: which yet was enough to deprive us of the public exercise of our
Ministeries, and together therewith (as the watchfulness of those times grew)
of our personal participation in some ordinances; and further exposed us
either to personal violence and persecution, or an exile to avoid it: Which
latter we did the rather choose, that so the use and exercise of our
Ministeries (for which we were borne and live) might not be wholly lost, nor
our selves remain debarred from the enjoyment of the Ordinances of Christ,
which we account our birthright, and best portion in this life.

This being our condition, we were cast upon a farther necessity of enquiring
into and viewing the light part, the positive part of Church-worship and
Government; And to that end to search out what were the first Apostolic
directions, pattern and examples of those Primitive Churches recorded in the
New Testament, as that sacred pillar of fire to guide us. And in this inquiry,
we looked upon the word of Christ as impartially, and unprejudicedly, as men
made of flesh and blood are like to do in any juncture of time that may fall
out; the places we went to, the condition we were in, the company we went forth
with, affording no temptation to by as us any way, but leaving us as freely to
be guided by that light and touch Gods Spirit should by the Word vouchsafe our
consciences, as the Needle touched with the Lodestone is in the Compass: And
we had (of all men) the greatest reason to be true to our own consciences in
what we should embrace, seeing it was for our consciences that we were deprived
at once of what ever was dear to us. We had no new Commonwealths to rear, to
frame Church Government unto, whereof any one piece might stand in the others
light, to cause the least variation by us from the Primitive pattern; We had no
State-ends or Political interests to comply* with; No Kingdoms in our eye to
subdue unto our mould; (which yet will be coexistent with the peace of any form
of Civil Government on earth) No preferment or worldly respects to shape our
opinions for: We had nothing else to do but simply and singly to consider how
to worship God acceptably, and so most according to his word.

We were not engaged by Education or otherwise to any other of the Reformed
Churches; And although we consulted with reverence what they hold forth both in
their writings and practice, yet we could not but suppose that they might not
see into all things about worship and government, their intentions being most
spent (as also of our first Reformers in England) upon the Reformation in
Doctrine, in which they had a most happy hand: And we had with many others
observed, that although the exercise of that Government had been accompanied
with more peace, yet the Practical part, the power of godliness and the
profession thereof, with difference from carnal and formal Christians, had
not been advanced and held forth among them, as in this our own Island, as
themselves have generally acknowledged. We had the advantage of all that light
which the conflicts of our own Divines (the good old Non-conformists) had
struck forth in their times; And the draughts of Discipline which they had
drawn; which we found not in all things the very same with the practices of the
Reformed Churches; And what they had written came much more commended to us,
not only because they were our own, but because sealed with their manifold and
bitter sufferings. We had likewise the fatal miscarriages and shipwracks of
the Separation (whom ye call Brownists) as Landmarks to fore-warn us of those
rocks and shelves they ran upon; which also did put us upon an enquiry into the
principles that might be the causes of their divisions. Last of all, we had the
recent and later example of the ways and practices (and those improved to a
better Edition and greater refinement, by all the forementioned helps) of
those multitudes of godly men of our own Nation, almost to the number of
another Nation, and among them some as holy and judicious Divines as this
Kingdom has bred; whose sincerity in their way has been testified before all
the world, and will be unto all generations to come, by the greatest undertaking
(but that of our father Abraham out of his own country, and his seed after
him) a transplanting themselves many thousand miles distance, and that by sea,
into a Wilderness, merely to worship God more purely, whither to allure them
there could be no other invitement. And yet we still stood as unengaged
spectators, free to examine and consider what truth is to be found in and
amongst all these, (all which we look upon as Reformed Churches) and this
nakedly according to the word; We resolved not to take up our Religion by or
from any party, and yet to approve and hold fast whatsoever is good in any,
though never so much differing from us, yea opposite unto us.

And for our own congregations, we mean of England (in which thorough the
grace of Christ we were converted, and exercised our Ministeries long, to the
conversion of many others) We have this sincere profession to make before God
and all the world, that all that conscience of the defilements we conceived to
cleave to the true worship of God in them, or of the unwarranted power in
Church Governors exercised therein, did never work in any of us any other
thought, much less opinion, but that multitudes of the assemblies and
parochial congregations thereof, were the true Churches and Body of Christ,
and the Ministry thereof a true Ministry: Much less did it ever enter into
our hearts to judge them Antichristian; we saw and cannot but see that by the
same reason the Churches abroad in Scotland, Holland, etc. (though more
reformed) yet for their mixture must be in like manner judged no Churches also,
which to imagine or conceive, is and has ever been an horror to our thoughts.
Yea we always have professed, and that in these times when the Churches of
England were the most, either actually overspread with defilements, or in the
greatest danger thereof, and when our selves had least, yea no hopes of ever so
much as visiting our own land again in peace and safety to our persons; that we
both did and would hold a communion with them as the Churches of Christ. And
besides this profession, as a real testimony thereof, some of us after we,
actually, were in this way of communion, baptized our children in Parishionall
congregations, and (as we had occasion) did offer to receive into the communion
of the Lords Supper with us, some (whom we knew godly that come to visit us
when we were in our exile) upon that relation, fellowship, and commembership
they held in their parish Churches in England, they professing themselves to be
members thereof, and belonging thereunto. What we have since our return
publicly and avowedly Mr. Cheynett. Rise and growth of Socinianisme.
made declaration of to this purpose, many hundreds can witness, and some of
our brethren in their printed books heartily do testify for us.

And as we always held this respect unto our own Churches in this Kingdom, so
we received and were entertained with the like from those reformed Churches
abroad, among whom we were cast to live, we both mutually gave and received the
right hand of fellowship, which they on their parts abundantly manifested by
the very same characters and testimonies of difference which are proper to
their own Orthodoxe Churches, and whereby they use to distinguish them from all
those sects (which they tolerate, but not own) and all the assemblies of them
(which yet now we are here some would needs rank us with) granting to some of
us their own Churches, or public places for worship, to assemble in, where
themselves met for the worship of God at differing hours the same day: As
likewise the privilege of ringing a public Bell to call unto our meetings:
which we mention because it is amongst them made the great signal of
difference between their own allowed Churches and all other assemblies, unto
whom it is strictly prohibited and forbidden, as Guiciardine has long since
observed: And others of us found such acceptance with them, that in testimony
thereof they allowed a full and liberal maintenance annually for our
Ministers, yea and constantly also Wine for our Communions. And then we again
on our parts, not only held all brotherly correspondency with their Divines,
but received also some of the members of their Churches (who desired to
communicate with us) unto communion in the Sacraments and other ordinances, by
virtue of their relation of membership retained in those Churches.

Now for the way and practices of our Churches, we give this brief and
general account. Our public worship was made up of no other parts then the
worship of all other reformed Churches does consist of. As, public and
solemn prayers for Kings and all in authority, etc. the reading the Scriptures
of the Old and New Testament; Exposition of them as occasion was; and constant
preaching of the word; the administration of the two Sacraments, Baptism to
infants, and the Lords Supper; singing of Psalms; collections for the poor,
etc. every Lords day. For Officers and public Rulers in the Church, we set up
no other but the very same which the reformed Churches judge necessary and
sufficient, and as instituted by Christ and his Apostles for the perpetual
government of his Church, that is, Pastors, Teachers, Ruling Elders, (with us
not lay but Ecclesiastique persons separated to that service) and Deacons. And
for the matter of government and censures of the Church, we had nor executed
any other but what all acknowledge, namely, Admonition, and Excommunication
upon obstinacy and impenitencie, (which we bless God we never exercised.)
This latter we judged should be put in execution, for no other kind of sins
then may evidently be presumed to be perpetrated against the parties known
light; as whether it be a sin in manners and conversation, such as is committed
against the light of nature, or the common received practices of Christianity,
professed in all the Churches of Christ; or if in opinions, then such, as are
likewise contrary to the received principles of Christianity, and the power of
godliness, professed by the party himself, and universally acknowledged in
all the rest of the churches, and no other sins to be the subject of that
dreadful sentence.

And for our directions in these or what ever else requisite to the manage of
them, we had these three Principles more especially in our eye, to guide and
steer our practice by.

First, the supreme rule without us, was the Primitive pattern and example of
the churches erected by the Apostles. Our consciences were possessed with that
reverence and adoration of the fullness of the Scriptures, that there is
therein a complete sufficiency, as to make the man of God perfect, so also to
make the Churches of God perfect, (mere circumstances we except, or what rules
the law of nature does in common dictate) if the directions and examples
therein delivered were fully known and followed. And although we cannot
profess that sufficiency of knowledge as to be able to lay forth all those
rules therein which may meet with all cases and emergencies that may or
sometimes did fall out amongst us, or that may give satisfaction unto all Queres
possible to be put unto us; yet we found principles enough, not only
fundamental and essential to the being of a Church, but superstructory also
for the wel-being of it, and those to us clear and certain, and such as might
well serve to preserve our Churches in peace and from offense, and would
comfortably guide us to heaven in a safe way: And the observation of so many of
those particulars to be laid forth in the Word, became to us a more certain
evidence and clear confirmation that there were the like rules and ruled cases
for all occasions whatsoever, if we were able to discern them. And for all
such cases wherein we saw not a clear resolution from Scripture, example, or
direction, we still professedly suspended, until God should give us further
light, not daring to eeke out what was defective in our light in matters Divine
with humane prudence, (the fatal error to Reformation) lest by sowing any
piece of the old garment unto the new, we should make the rent worse; we having
this promise of grace for our encouragement in this, which in our public
Assemblies was often for our comfort mentioned, that in thus doing the will of
God we should know more.

A second Principle we carried along with us in all our resolutions, was, Not
to make our present judgment and practice a binding law unto our selves for
the future, which we in like manner made continual profession of upon all
occasions. We had too great an instance of our own frailty in the former way of
our conformity; and therefore in a jealousy of our selves, we kept this
reserve, (which we made open and constant professions of) to alter and retract
(though not lightly) what ever should be discovered to be taken up out of a
misunderstanding of the rule: Which Principle we wish were (next to that most
supreme, namely, to be in all things guided by the perfect will of God) enacted
as the most sacred law of all other, in the midst of all other Laws and Canons
Ecclesiastical in Christian States and Churches throughout the world.

Thirdly, we are able to hold forth this true and just Apology unto the world,
That in the matters of greatest moment and controversy, we still chose to
practice safely, and so, as we had reason to judge that all sorts, or the most
of all the Churches did acknowledge warrantable, although they make additaments
thereunto.

For instance: Whereas one great controversy of these times is about the
qualification of the Members of Churches, and the promiscuous receiving and
mixture of good and bad; Therein we chose the better part, and to be sure,
received in none but such as all the Churches in the world would by the balance
of the Sanctuary acknowledge faithful. And yet in this we are able to make this
true and just profession also, That the Rules which we gave up our judgments
unto, to judge those we received in amongst us by, were of that latitude as
would take in any member of Christ, the meanest, in whom there may be supposed
to be the least of Christ, and indeed such and no other as all the godly in
this Kingdom carry in their bosoms to judge others by. We took measure of no
man's holiness by his opinion, whether concurring with us, or adverse unto us;
And Churches made up of such, we were sure no Protestant could but approve of,
(as touching the members of it) to be a true Church, with which communion might
be held. Again, concerning the great ordinance of Public Prayer and the
Lyturgie of the Church, whereas there is this great controversy upon it about
the lawfulness of set forms prescribed; we practiced (without condemning
others) what all sides do allow, and themselves do practice also, that the
public Prayers in our Assemblies should be framed by the meditations and
study of our own Ministers, out of their own gifts, (the fruits of Christ's
Ascension) as well as their Sermons use to be. This we were sure all allowed
of, though they superadded the other. So likewise for the government and
discipline in the Churches, however the practice of the Reformed Churches is in
greater matters to govern each particular congregation by a combined
Presbytery of the Elders of several congregations united in one for
government; yet so, as in their judgments they allow, especially in some
cases, a particular congregation, an entire and complete power of jurisdiction
to be exercised by the Elders thereof within it self; Yea and our own Master
Cartwright, holy Baynes, and other old Non-conformists, place the power of
Excommunication in the Elde^ship of each particular Church with the consent of
the Church, until they do miscarry, and then indeed they subject them to such
Presbyterial and Provincial Assemblies as the proper refuge for appeals and
for compounding of differences amongst Churches; which combination of Churches
others of them therefore call Ecclesiae ortae, but particular congregations
Ecclesiae primae, as wherein firstly the power and privilege of a Church is to
be exercised. And vvithall we could not but imagine, that the first Churches
planted by the Apostles, were ordinarily of no more in one city at first then
might make up one entire congregation, ruled by their own Elders, that also
preached to them; for that in every city where they came, the number of
converts did or should arise to such a multitude as to make several and sundry
congregations, or that the Apostles should stay the setting up of any Churches
at all, until they rose to such a numerous multiplication as might make such a
Presbyterial combination, we did not imagine. We found also those Non
conformists (that wrote against the Episcopal Government) in their Answer to
the Arguments used for Episcopal Government over many Churches, brought from
the instances of the multitude of Believers at Jerusalem, and other places and
cities, mentioned in the New Testament, to assert that it could not be
infallibly proved that any of those we read of in the Acts and elsewhere;
were yet so numerous, as necessarily to exceed the limits of one particular
congregation in those first times. We found it also granted by them all, that
there should be several Elders in every congregation, who had power over them
in the Lord; and we judged that all those precepts, obey your Elders, and them
that are over you, were (to be sure, and all grant it) meant of the Pastors
and Teachers, and other Elders that were set over them in each particular
congregation respectively, and to be as certainly the intendment of the holy
Ghost, as in those like commands, Wives obey your own husbands, Servants your
own governors, to be meant of their several Families respectively.

We could not therefore but judge it a safe and an allowed way to retain the
government of our several congregations for matter of discipline within
themselves, to be exercised by their own Elders, whereof we had (for the most
part of the time we were abroad) three at least in each congregation, whom we
were subject to: yet not clayming to our selves an independent power in every
congregation, to give account or be subject to none others, but only a full and
entire power complete within our selves, until we should be challenged to err
grossly; such as Corporations enjoy, who have the power and privilege to pass
sentence for life and death within themselves, and yet are accountable to the
State they live in. But that it should be the institution of Christ or his
Apostles, that the combination of the Elders of many Churches should be the
first complete and entire seat of Church power over each congregation so
combined; or that they could challenge and assume that authority over those
Churches they feed and teach not ordinarily by virtue of those forementioned
Apostolical precepts, was to us a question, and judged to be an additament
unto the other, which therefore rested on those that allowed us what we
practiced, over and above, to make evident and demonstrate (and certainly of
all other the challenge of all spiritual power from Christ had need have a
clear pattent to show for it) Yea we appeal further unto them that have read
books, whether until those latter wrytings of the two reverend and learned
Divines of Scotland set forth after our return, nor much more then two years
since, and others of no elder date from Holland, and one of our own Divines
more lately written with much learning and ingenuity; there has been much
settly and directly or with strength insisted on to prove that government; and
although assert and inculcate it they do as their opinions, yet the full
strength and stream of our Non-conformists wrytings and others are spent
rather in arguments against, and for the overthrowing the Episcopal
government, and the corruptions that cleave to our worship, and in maintayning
those several Officers in Churches which Christ has instituted in stead
thereof (in which we fully agree with them) then in the proof of a combined
classical Presbyteriall government as it is authoritatively practiced in the
most reformed Churches.

And whereas the common prejudice and exception laid into all men's thoughts
against us and our opinions is, that in such a congregationall government thus
entire within it self, there is no allowed sufficient remedy for miscarriages,
though never so gross; no relief for wrongful sentences or persons injured
thereby; no room for complaints: no powerful or effectual means to reduce a
Church or Churches that fall into heresy, schism, etc. but every one is left
and may take liberty without control to do what is good in their own eyes; we
have (through the good providence of God upon us) from the avowed declarations
of our judgments among our Churches mutually during our exile, and that also
confirmed by the most solemn instance of our practice, wherewith to vindicate
our selves and way in this particular; which upon no other occasion we should
ever have made thus public.

God so ordered it that a scandal and offense fell out between those very
Churches whilst living in this banishment (whereof we our selves, that write
these things, were then the Ministers) one of our Churches having unhappily
deposed one of their Ministers, the other judged it not only as too sudden
an act (having proceeded in a matter of so great moment without consulting
their sister Churches, as was publicly professed we should have done in such
cases of concernement) but also in the proceedings thereof as too severe, and
not managed according to the rules laid down in the word. In this case our
Churches did mutually and universally acknowledge and submit to this as a
sacred and undoubted principle and supreme law to be observed among all
Churches, that as by virtue of that Apostolical command, Churches as well as
particular men are bound to give no offense neither to Jew nor Gentile, nor the
Churches of God they live amongst. So that in all cases of such offense or
difference, by the obligation of the common law of communion of Churches, and
for the vindication of the glory of Christ, which in common they hold forth,
the church or churches challenged to offend or differ, are to submit themselves
(upon the challenge of the offense or complaint of the person wronged) to the
most full and open trial and examination by other neighbor Churches offended
there at, of what ever has given the offense: And further, that by the virtue
of the same and like law of not partaking in other men's sins, the Churches
offended may and ought upon the impenitency of those Churches, persisting in
their error and miscarriage to pronounce that heavy sentence, against them, of
withdrawing and renouncing all Christian communion with them until they do
repent; And further to declare and protest this, with the causes thereof, to
all other Churches of Christ, that they may do the like.

And what further authority, or proceedings purely Ecclesiastical, of one, or
many sister Churches toward another whole Church, or Churches offending,
either the Scriptures do hold forth, or can rationally be put in execution
(without the Magistrates interposing a power of another nature, unto which we
upon his particular cognizance, and examination of such causes, profess ever
to submit, and also to be most vvilling to have recourse unto) for our parts
we savv not then, nor do yet see. And likewise we did then suppose, and do
yet, that this principle of submission of Churches that miscarry unto other
Churches offended, together with this other, that it is a command from Christ
enjoined to Churches that are finally offended to denounce such a sentence of
Non-communion and withdrawing from them whilst impenitent, as unworthy to hold
forth the name of Christ, ( these principles being received and generally
acknowledged by the Churches of Christ to be a mutual duty, as strictly
enjoined them by Christ as any other) that these would be as effectual means
(through the blessing of Christ) to awe and preserve Churches and their Elders
in their duties, as that other of claim to an authoritative power
Ecclesiastical to Excommunicate other Churches or their Elders offending; For
if the one be compared with the other, in a mere Ecclesiastial notion, That of
Excommunication pretended has but this more in it, That it is a delivering of
whole Churches and their Elders offending unto Satan, (for which we know no
warrant in the Scriptures, that Churches should have such a power over other
Churches) And then as for the binding obligation both of the one way and the
other, it can be supposed to lie but in these 2. things; First, in a warrant
and injunction given by Christ to his Churches, to put either the one or the
other into execution; and 2. that men's consciences be accordingly taken
therewith, so as to subject themselves whether unto the one way or the other:
For suppose that other principle of an authoritative power in the greater part
of Churches combined to excommunicate other Churches, etc. to be the ordinance
of God, yet unless it do take hold of men's consciences, and be received
amongst all Churches, the offending Churches will slight all such
Excommunications as much, as they may be supposed to do our way of
protestation and sentence of Non-communion. On the other side, let this way of
ours be but as strongly entertained, as that which is the way and command of
Christ, and upon all occasions be heedfully put in execution, it will awe men's
consciences as much, and produce the same effects. And if the Magistrates power
(to which we give as much, and (as we think) more, then the principles of the
Presbiteriall government will suffer them to yield) do but assist and back the
sentence of other Churches denouncing this Non-communion against Churches
miscarrying, according to the nature of the crime, as they judge meet, and as
they would the sentence of Churches excommunicating other Churches in such
cases, upon their own particular judgment of the cause; then, without all
controversy this our way of Church proceeding will be every way as effectual
as their other can be supposed to be; and we are sure, more brotherly and more
suited to that liberty and equality Christ has endowed his Churches with. But
without the Magistrates interposing their authority, their way of proceeding
will be as ineffectuall as ours; and more liable to contempt, by how much it is
pretended to be more authoritative; and to inflict a more dreadful punishment,
which carnal spirits are seldom sensible of* This for our judgments.

And for a real evidence and demonstration both that this was then, our
judgments, as likewise for an instance of the effectual success of such a
course held by Churches in such cases, our own practice, and the blessing of
God thereon, may plead and testify for us to all the world. The manage of this
transaction in brief was this.

That Church which (with others) was most scandalized, did by letters declare
their offense, requiring of the Church (supposed to be) offending, in the name
and for the vindication of the honor of Christ, and the releeving the party
wronged, to yield a full and public hearing before all the Churches of our
Nation, or any other whomsoever, offended, of what they could give in charge
against their proceedings in that deposition of their Minister, and to subject
themselves to an open trial and review of all those forepassed carriages that
concerned that particular; which they most cheerfully and readily (according to
the forementioned principles) submitted unto, in a place, and state where no
outward violence or any other external authority either civil or
ecclesiastical would have enforced them thereunto: And accordingly the
Ministers of the Church offended with other two Gentlemen, of much worth,
wisdom and piety, members thereof, were sent as Messengers from that Church;
and at the introduction and entrance into that solemn assembly (the solemnity
of which has left as deep an impression upon our hearts of Christ's dreadful
presence as ever any we have been present at,) it was openly and publicly
professed in a speech that was the preface to that discussion, to this effect,
That it was the most to be abhorred maxim that any Religion has ever made
profession of, and therefore of all other the most contradictory and
dishonorable unto that of Christianity, that a single and particular society
of men professing the name of Christ, and pretending to be endowed with a power
from Christ to judge them that are of the same body and society within
themselves, should further arrogate unto themselves an exemption from giving
account or being censurable by any other, either Christian Magistrate above
them, or neighbor Churches about them. So far were our judgments from that
independent liberty that is imputed to us, then, when we had least dependency
on this kingdom, or so much as hopes ever to abide therein in peace. And for
the issue and success of this agitation, after there had been for many days
as judiciary and full a charge, trial, and deposition of witnesses openly
before all comers of all sorts, as can be expected in any Court where Authority
enjoins it, that Church, which had offended, did as publicly acknowledge
their sinful aberration in it, restored theit Minister to his place again, and
ordered a solemn day of fasting to humble themselves before God and men, for
their sinful carriage in it; and the party also which had been deposed did
acknowledge to that Church wherein he had likewise sinned.

Thus we have rendered some small account of those, the saddest days of our
pilgrimage on earth, wherein although we enjoyed God, yet besides many other
miseries (the companions of banishment) we lost some friends and companions,
our fellow laborers in the Gospel, as precious men as this earth bears any,
through the distemper of the place, and our selves came hardly off that service
with our healths, yea lives.

When it pleased God to bring us his poor Exiles back again in these
revolutions of the times, as also of the condition of this kingdom, into our
own land, (the pouring forth of manifold prayers and tears for the prosperity
whereof, had been no small part of that public worship we offered up to God
in a strange land;) we found the judgment of many of our godly learned
brethren in the Ministry (that desired a general reformation) to differ from
ours in some things, wherein we do professedly judge the Calvinian Reformed
Churches of the first reformation from out of Popery, to stand in need of a
further reformation themselves; And it may without prejudice to them, or the
imputation of Schism in us from them, be thought, that they coming new out of
Popery (as well as England) and the founders of that reformation not having
Apostolic infallibility, might not be fully perfect the first day. Yea and it
may hopefully be conceived, that God in his secret, yet wise and gracious
dispensation, had left England more unreformed as touching the outward form,
both of worship and Church government, then the neighbor Churches were, having
yet powerfully continued a constant conflict and contention for a further
Reformation for these fourscore years; during which time he had likewise in
stead thereof blessed them with the spiritual light (and that increasing) of
the power of Religion in the Practique part of it, shining brighter and clearer
then in the neighbor Churches, as having in his infinke mercy on purpose
reserved and provided some better thing for this Nation when it should come to
be reformed, that the other Churches might not be made perfect without it, as
the Apostle speaks.

We found also (which was as great an affliction to us as our former troubles
and banishment) our opinions and ways (wherein we might seem to differ)
environed about with a cloud of mistakes and misapprehensions, and our persons
with reproaches, Besides other calumnies, as of schism, etc. (which yet must
either relate to a differing from the former Ecclesiastical Government of this
Church established, and then who is not involved in it as well as we? or to
that constitution and government that is yet to come; and until that be agreed
on, established and declared, and actually exist, there can be no guilt or
imputation of Schime from it) That proud and insolent title of Independencie
was affixed unto us, as our claim; the very sound of which conveys to all men's
apprehensions the challenge of an exemption of all Churches from all subjection
and dependence, or rather a trumpet of defiance against what ever Power,
Spiritual or Civil; which we do abhor and detest: Or else the odious name of
Brownisme, together with all their opinions as they have stated and maintained
them, must needs be owned by us: Although upon the very first declaring our
judgments in the chief and fundamental point of all Church discipline, and
likewise since, it has been acknowledged that we differ much from them. And
we did then, and do here publicly profess, we believe the truth to lie and
consist in a middle way betwixt that which is falsely charged on us, Brownisme;
and that which is the contention of these times, the authoritative
Presbyteriall Government in all the subordinations and proceedings of it.

And had we been led in our former ways, and our removal out of this Kingdom
by any such spirit of faction and division, or of pride and singularity, (which
are the usual grounds of all Schism) we had since our returns again during
this intermisticall season, tentations, yea provocations enough to have drawn
forth such a spirit; having manifold advantages to make and increase a party,
which we have not in the least attempted. We found the spirits of the people of
this Kingdom that profess or pretend to the power of godliness (they finding
themselves to be so much at liberty, and new come out of bondage) ready to take
any impressions, and to be cast into any mould that has but the appearance of
a stricter way. And we found that many of those mists that had gathered about
us, or were rather cast upon our persons in our absence, began by our presence
again, and the blessing of God upon us, in a great measure to scatter and
vanish, without speaking a word for our selves or Cause.

But through the grace of Christ, our spirits are and have been so remote from
such dispositions and aims, that on the contrary we call God and men to witness
our constant forbearance, either to publish our opinions by preaching (although
we had the Pulpits free) or to print any thing of our own or others for the
vindication of our selves (although the Presses were more free then the
Pulpits) or to act for our selves or way; although we have been from the first
provoked unto all these all sorts of ways, both by the common
mis-understandings and mis-representations of our opinions and practices,
together with incitements to this State not to allow us the peaceable practices
of our Consciences, which the Reformed Churches abroad allowed us, and these
edged with calumnies and reproaches cast upon our persons in print; and all
these heightened with this further prejudice and provocation, that this our
silence was interpreted, that we were either ashamed of our opinions, or able
to say little for them; when as on the other side (besides all other
advantages) Books have been written by men of much worth, learning, and
authority, with moderation and strength, to prepossesse the peoples minds
against what are supposed our Tenets. But we knew and considered that it was
the second blow that makes the quarrel, and that the beginning of strife would
have been as the breaking in of waters; and the sad and conscientious
apprehension of the danger of rending and dividing the godly Protestant party
in this Kingdom that were desirous of Reformation, and of making several
interests among them in a time when there was an absolute necessity of their
nearest union and conjunction, and all little enough to effect that Reformation
intended, and so long contended for, against a common adversary that had both
present possession to plead for it self, power to support it, and had enjoyed
a long continued settlement which had rooted it in the hearts of men; And this
seconded by the instant and continual advices and conjurements of many
Honorable, wise, and godly Personages of both Houses of Parliament, to
forbear what might any way be like to occasion or augment this unhappy
difference; They having also by their Declarations to His Majesty professed
their endeavor and desire to unite the Protestant party in this Kingdom,
that agree in Fundamental Truths against Popery and other Heresies, and to
have that respect to tender consciences as might prevent oppressions and
inconveniences which had formerly been; Together with that strict engagement
willingly entered into by us for these common ends, with the rest of our
brethren of the Ministry, (which though made to continue but ad placitum, yet
has been sacred to us.) And above all, the due respect we have had to the
peaceable and orderly Reformation of this Church and State; the hopeful
expectation we have been entertained with of an happy latitude and agreement by
means of this Assembly, and the wisdom of this Parliament: The conscience and
consideration of all these, and the weight of each, have hitherto had more
power with us to this deep silence and forbearance, then all our own interests
have any way prevailed with us to occasion the least disturbance amongst the
people. We have and are yet resolved to bear all this with a quiet and a
strong patience, (in the strength of which we now speak, or rather sigh forth
this little) referring the vindication of our persons to God, and a further
experience of us by men; and the declaration of our judgments, and what we
conceive to be his truth therein, to the due and orderly agitation of this
Assembly whereof both Houses were pleased to make us Members.

And whereas our silence upon all the forementioned grounds (for which we know
we can never lose esteem with good and wise men) has been by the ill
interpretation of some, imputed either to our consciousnesse of the badnesse
and weakness of our Cause, or to our unability to maintain what we assert in
difference from others, or answer what has been written by others, we shall
(with all modesty) only present this to all men's apprehensions in confutation
of it. That what ever the truth and justness of our Cause may prove to be, or
how slender our abilities to defend it, yet we pretend at least to so much
wisdom, that we would never have reserved our selves for, but rather by all
ways have declined this Theater, of all other, the most judicious and severe,
an Assembly of so many able, learned, and grave Divines, where much of the
piety, wisdom, and learning of two Kingdoms are met in one, honored and
assisted with the presence of the Worthies of both Houses at all debates (as
often as they please to vouchsafe their presence) as the Stage whereon first
we would bring forth into public view our Tenets (if false and counterfeit)
together with our own folly and weakness: We would much rather have chosen to
have been venting them to the multitude, apt to be seduced, (which we have had
these three years opportunity to have done.) But in a conscientious regard had
to the orderly and peaceable way of searching out truths, and reforming the
Churches of Christ, we have adventured our selves upon this way of God, wisely
assumed by the prudence of the State; And therein also upon all sorts of
disadvantages (which we could not but foresee) both of number, abilities of
learning, Authority, the stream of public interest; Trusting God both with
our selves and his own truth, as he shall be pleased to manage it by us.

Moreover, if in all matters of Doctrine, we were not as Orthodoxe in our
judgments as our brethren themselves, we would never have exposed our selves
to this trial and hazard of discovery in this Assembly, the mixture of whose
spirits, the quicksightednes of whose judgments (intent enough upon us) and
variety of debates about all sorts of controversies afoot in these times of
contradiction, are such, as would be sure soon to find us out if we nourished
any monsters or Serpents of opinions lurking in our bosoms. And if we had
carried it so, as that hitherto such errors were not aforehand open to the
view and judgment of all, yet sitting here (unless we would be silent, which
we have not been) we could not long be hid. But it is sufficiently known that
in all points of doctrine (which hitherto in the review and examination of the
Articles of our Church, or upon other occasions have been gone thorough) our
judgments have still concurred with the greatest part of our brethren, neither
do we know wherein we have dissented. And in matters of Discipline we are so
far from holding up the differences that occur, or making the breaches
greater or wider, that we endeavor upon all such occasions to grant and yield
(as all may see and cannot but testify for us) to the utmost latitude of our
light and consciences; professing it to be as high a point of Religion and
conscience readily to own, yea fall down before whatsoever is truth in the
hands of those that differ, yea though they should be enemies unto us, as much
as earnestly to contend for and hold fast those truths wherein we should be
found dissenting from them; and this as in relation to peace, so also as a just
due to truth and goodness, even to approve it and acknowledge it to the utmost
grain of it, though mingled with what is opposite unto us. And further when
matters by discussion are brought to the smallest dissent that may be, we have
hitherto been found to be no backward urgers unto a temper (not only in things
that have concerned our own consciences, but when of others also) such as may
suit and tend to union as well as searching out of truth; judging this to be as
great and useful an end of Synods and Assemblies, as a curious and exact
discussion of all sorts of lesser differences with binding Determinations of
truth one way.

And thus we have nakedly and with all simplicity rendered a clear and true
account of our ways and spirits hitherto; Which we made choice of now at first
to make our selves known by, rather then by a more exact and Scholastique
relation of our judgments in the points of difference about Church government;
reserving that unto the more proper season and opportunity of this Assembly,
and that liberty given by both Honorable Houses in matters of dissent; or as
necessity shall after require, to a more public way of stating and asserting
of them. In the mean time from this brief historical relation of our
practices, there may a true estimate be taken of our opinions in difference,
which being instanced in, and set out by practices, is the most real and least
collusive way, and carries its own evidence with it. All which we have taken
the boldness together with our selves humbly to lay at the feet of your wisdom
and piety; Beseeching you to look upon us under no other Notion, or character,
then as those, who if we cannot assume to have been no way furtherers of that
reformation you intend, yet who have been no way hinderers thereof, or
disturbers of the public peace; and who in our judgments about the present
work of this age, the reformation of worship and discipline, do differ as
little from the Reformed Churches, and our Brethren, yea far less, then they
do from what themselves were three years past, or then the generallity of this
kingdom from it self of late. And withal to consider us as those, who in these
former times, for many years suffered even to exile, for what the kingdom it
self now suffers in the endeavor to cast out; and who in these present times,
and since the change of them, have endured (that which to our spirits is no
less grievous) the opposition and reproach of good men, even to the threatening
of another banishment, and have been through the grace of God upon us, the same
men in both, in the midst of these varieties; And finally, as those that do
pursue no other interest or design but a subsistence (be it the poorest and
meanest) in our own land (where we have and may do further service, and which
is our birthright as we are men) with the enjoyment of the ordinances of
Christ (which are our portion as we are Christians) with the allowance of a
latitude to some lesser differences with peaceablenesse, as not knowing where
else with safety, health, and livelihood, to set our feet on earth.
