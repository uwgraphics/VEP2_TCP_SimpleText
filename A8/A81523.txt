A DISCOURSE UPON THE QVESTIONS In debate between the KING AND PARLIAMENT.
HAving been a by-stander, and observing so well as I could, how this great
game has been played on both hands, between the King and Parliament: I have
wondered to find (considering the Declarations on both parts) that with great
expense of time and money they have made a shift to argue themselves into a
Civil war. And the wonder is no less to hear the variety of opinions;
some asserting his Majesty's proceedings, some the Parliaments, and some
affirming that the thing in variance belongs to neither, divided from the
other: for (say they) it is but who shall rule Arbitrarily, in cases to which
the Law has not fully, or not at all extended; which the King calls his
Prerogative, the Parliament (as matters now stand) theirs.

To take the better view of the present differences, look a little way back
upon the actions of precedent times. It has been the general belief of this
Nation (upon what reason I cannot judge) that the design of his Majesty's late
Father King James was to wind up this Government to the height of France, the
better to hold correspondence with foreign Princes, whose power increasing
their riches, and both together their reputation, it was a shame to be left
behind, but finding the times averse, and being the best Astrologer in the
world what the success should be of his own Actions, he betook himself to
the satisfactions of his age which he could acquire, and left the complement of
this to his Majesty that now is, in whose person were concurrent a title
indubitable, settled by a succession, and the activitie and glory that is
inseparable to youth, and the fresh assumption to the Throne of three Kingdoms.

The first dissolved Parliament (to stumble at the first step) seemed ominous
to some, others took it for a trial, and in pursuance of the design. And the
rather for that (his Majesty's Protestations to govern by the Laws, and his
late answer to the petition of Right notwithstanding) the exaction of Loan
money immediately following, the erection of Monopolies, and the forcible
taking of the Subsidy of Tunnage and Poundage, begat an universal diffidence
in the people of his Majesty's personal promises, and an opinion, that his
best resolutions were easily overthrown by the counsel of others, and so
consequently that his Actions were not his own: which opinion true or false,
when ever it got belief, has proved fatal to the Princes, or to the people
of this Kingdom: For the Nation has hated to be governed by many Viceroyes,
and resents no insolences in their Princes so much as defects, rapes,
murders, and particular depredations, being more tolerable, when the virtues
of the Kingly office have a happy influence and latitude upon the whole body
of the Commonwealth. And yet to speak a truth the same argument that
aggravates the violations in Government may be a reasonable excuse for his
Majesty (and the same that the reverence of the English Nation to their
Princes has ever used) those acts of injustice were not the Kings but his
Ministers: for what other opinion could the King retain, then what the Judges
delivered for Law, and the Divines for Gospel; for these had made a general
definition of a King, and applied it to all Princes, and those had made a
general day of judgment upon all the Laws, and subdued them to the will and
pleasure of those Princes: and being mindful of their own interest, and how
much it concerned them to make that King absolute, whom they had hope
absolutely to rule; they would needs make a King by the Standard out of Gods
Word, that his Subjects might be slaves for Conscience sake: And by examples
taken from the Kingdom of the Jews, they invested him with power essential
to his Office, to use at pleasure the persons, or estates of his subjects; of a
divine institution, incomprehensible by laws, if necessity require a
variation and under heaven no other Judge of that necessity besides himself:
And having placed him in the rank of Gods gave him the like Election, to
govern the world by second causes, the fit officers of nature, or by miracles
and wonders, effects of his immediate interposition; by the grand Councels,
Judges, and inferior Ministers of the Laws; or by Patents with non obstantes,
Proclamations, and a divine Prerogative.

But to say a truth his Majesty has of late admitted a better information of
this manner of Government; And has given many Assurances by Protestation to
innovate nothing, yet this satisfies not, and the reason would be examined; As
also what those difficult questions are, whereof the sword must needs make the
resolution.

The ill satisfaction the people receive, notwithstanding the Kings mighty
Protestations to govern by the Laws, to defend the Protestant Religion,
Privileges of Parliament, etc. springs out of this Jealousy, that if it come
into his Majesty's power to do otherwise, he will do so. For who can think
(say they) having the same maxims in his mind, and the same council in his
ear, that he has had, that he will do otherwise then he has done: That he
will after the ruin of this Parliament, refuse the fruition of that, which
has cost so much labor, when the danger is passed: who will believe he will
have recourse for aid and advice to Parliaments, when he shall remember to
what sad exigents he has been reduced by them (whereof that himself was any
part of the cause shall be hid from his eyes) how a verse they are in their
composition from the Genius of the Court, how apt to be misse-led by a few, how
unfit councillors in matters out of their usual cognizance, wanting abilities
to advise, and modesty to be silent, how slow and lingering the remedies are
for the maladies of the Commonwealth: who will not think how much better it
is for the King (if he can) to satisfy the people upon the word of a King, on
the word of a Gentleman, that their grievances shall be remedied as well
without a Parliament? who will not believe he will rather choose to be the
father of a Militia of his own, who receiving their livelihood out of his
Coffers, shall help to fill them; by whose hands he shall have power to mow the
fertile meadows of Britain as often in a Summer as he pleases. And what shall
hinder? the Law? no; there shall be the same imminent necessity that was
pretended before, and there shall not want both Divines and Lawyers, that shall
say the King and his private Council are sole Judges of that necessity, shall
the Kings Promises and Protestations hinder? I cannot tell, it may be so, I
wish the people of this Kingdom had such confidence in his Majesty's personal
promises: but if the King cannot himself tell, if no King nor private man can
tell, how his Councels and resolutions may change, when the state and condition
wherein he made them is changed: if humane nature easily relapse to those
things that it loves, and if the resumption of such illegal power, suggest not
only the sweetness of riches and Dominion, but by false arguments comes
apparelled with necessity of the kingdoms preservation, I know not whether
naked words subject to so much variety of construction will be of force to
resist so great temptation.

Hazael being but a private person thought himself much injured when the
Prophet made that cruel Character of his future behavior, Am I a dog? yet he
was so dogged, and few (perhaps) that knew him would ever have thought it.
Therefore if his Majesty will have those promises believed, let him not
apparently go about to place himself in such a condition, that he may break
them at his pleasure.

I know the Allegations for the manner of his Majesty's present proceedings
are, first the just vindication of his royal Prerogative (whereof it is
pretended violation has been made to the prejudice of himself and the people)
and wherewith he is trusted by God; which trust he may not desert, for Gods
sake, his own, and the peoples.

For the Prerogative of Princes (so much talked of, and so little known) it
may in brief be said, That all Princes have gained Dominion by force, or by
bargain, (For to say that Adam, if he had lived to this time had been King of
the whole world, and therefore the King is first in order before the people,
his natural Vassals; and production, is an Assertion invented to flatter
Princes, for all men know that the multiplication of Colonies in Regions far
distant from the first roots of Nations, must impell the necessity of erecting
many independent governments, and the necessity will be as great for the
independencie, as for the multiplicitie) therefore by force or by contract they
must commence; Dominion got by force, is kept by force, and styled Tyranny, or
else it dissolves into Government by contract, and so takes a lawful for me.
Therefore of the nature and latitude of the Prerogative that rests in the hands
of a Prince, that comes in by agreement with the people; is the now dispute. It
may be defined thus: A power to see the Laws put in execution, and to do that
which is good for the people in cases to which the Laws have not yet extended;
if there were no Laws (as perhaps there are not many in the first erection of
a Monarchy) but that all were trusted to the wisdom and goodness of the
Prince, yet by all the reason in the world the intendment of that trust was to
enable him to do good, not to do everything. Now, where the Laws are
positive the Prerogative claims no jurisdiction. The corruptions of Princes,
and the extravagancies of the people occasioned Laws, for bounds and limits to
both: and it is a thing out of all question, that the first contract would have
left no Prerogative at all; if all future needs and inconveniences of the
Government could at one entire view have been presented to the people; but that
being impossible, the discretion of all commonwealths meeting in their
representative bodies, have given a flop by Laws to the progress of any
inconvenience as it has been emergent.

His Majesty complains that he is divested of his legal prerogative. That
is, he is denied the power to execute the Laws, with his own sense and
exposition upon them: And the Lords and Commons in Parliament pray to have
reduced into a Law that Arbitrary power which he has of custom exercised, in
things to which the Laws do not fully extend: or to speak shorter, they are
not willing to trust him any longer with a power undefin'd, which they have
found employed to their harm, but desire to have it defined and limited; that
for the time to come it may be so no more; And this they expect from his
Majesty as a duty of his office to the people, who if they are incapable of
reason of state, yet are not incompetent Judges of what is good for themselves;
unless we shall maintain the Arguments of France in England, and to the same
end; That the people are altogether ignorant of their own welfare, That the
King only knows it; That it is best with an implicit faith to trust him, and
his Army, and Council, with the safety of the Commonwealth, and every man's
life and estate, That when France is free from fear of foreign enemies, the
subjects shall be discharged of the oppressions; In the mean time to make
himself and his Mamalukes formidable to his neighbor Princes he has
transformed millions of Christian souls into beasts, reducing them back to
the Elements whereof they were made, yet they must not complain nor defend
their Laws and Liberties, lest they seem to resist Authority: Nor supplicate
the supreme Magistrate to govern according to right, reason, and the Laws of
the Kingdom, lest they seem wiser than their teachers, to be short, I hope it
will never be so in England. And if the English Parliament be at sometime
mistaken (as it is not to be presumed that they will be) yet they are not so
much hurt by the inconvenience of that mistake, until the next Parliament
rectify, as they are, if they shall be disabled from all competencie to Judge
in matters tending to their own welfare.

For the other branch of his Majesty's Allegation that the streightning of his
Prerogative is prejudicial to the people: It is true a Prince of high and
magnanimous endowments cannot dispense with that liberty and the influence of
his excellent personal virtues, if he be too much bound up by the dead letter
of the law; for the actions of some have been transcendent to all Laws or
Examples; and pity it had been that they should have been confined. And
(indeed) the people do lose willingly of their liberties to such good Princes,
which proves unhappie to them, when worse make a title to the same liberty, by
such Examples; And there is no surer a sign of a weak Prince, than to contest
with the people upon these Presidents, rather seeking Examples for his purpose
amongst the actions of his Predecessors, than desirous to be himself an
Example to posterity. However those Princes that have surmounted all Laws in
their glorious actions have been very rare, a festival that comes but once a
year; which if it came every quarter, yet a good constant diet were much
better.

It is strange to find how defective some are in the right understanding of the
Mysteries they profess, what is it that a Prince would have, (that affects not
glorious vindications and conquests upon foreign enemies) to live safely,
plentifully, and beloved of his people, to dye lamented, rich, and of a blessed
memory; this is all that can accrue to the best of the sons of men: And if
Princes did not prefer their wills before their profit; if they did not shame
less to pick locks, pockets, and their subjects purses, than to say I thank
you; if they did not choose rather by force to justify injustice, rapine and
oppression, than to have any actions of themselves or ministers called by such
names, doubtless in a short time they could not choose but arrive at an almost
absolute dominion. For the arguments used to divert from honest accomodations
with the people, do not appear to me that ever they were intertain'd by those
Heroic Princes that have filled the stories of all ages with their high and
excellent glories, but by some of narrow and limited qualifications for
government, one argument is, That if the same ways of munificence and bounty
by which some Princes have ingratiated themselves, should for some descents of
Princes be pursued, the Crown, regal Authority, and revenue would be
destroyed, and nothing left whereby to oblige the people or wherein to be
liberal. It Is true, indiscrect prosution has consumed many Princes (and that
is indiscreet that is misimployed and lost) it never availed (that I have
heard) to the advancement of any, nor does it extend much further than the
Kings chamber; nor is it any Motive of affection in the people to hear that
the King is liberal of his purse to his servants and Favorites. A Princes
bounty shines in a little sphere, if compared with the peoples, as his estate
is small, compared with the revenue of the whole Commonwealth; His liberality
cannot extend to all his subjects, theirs may to him; it is not that virtue
that exalts him in the opinion of the people. And yet it is a liberality, but
not consumptive to his estate, nor destructive to his authority, but
accumulative to both, Liberality of Justice, where of the impartial
distribution has raised princes into the rank of Gods. And I am verily
persuaded if there should fall out to be so happy a race of Princes, who
deposing all particular interests, should advance only public Justice and
Utilitie; The Arms, traffic, and tranquillity of their people, the honor,
industry, and spirit of the nations under their command; that in a few
descents they would become absolute, and clearly acquitted from all obligation
to Laws, or at least the execution would be so long intermitted that with much
difficulty they would ever come in force, and the restitution seem as great
an innovation, as of late has been thought of Laws in force long-layed a side
for want of use; And in the times of such Princes we hear no talk of
prerogative, or liberty, the one is surrendered to the will of the prince, the
other employed to the advantage of the people, and it is an infallible sign of
great distempers in government when such disputes arise.

To conclude the Prerogative is a trust which (because no Laws are large enough
to meet with all accedents) resides of necessity in the person, or body
politic, where the Sovereignty resides: And it is true the King is trusted by
God with this Prerogative, as all in authority are in their degree to discharge
themselves piously toward him, honestly to those under their command: He is
also trusted by his Subjects, who do not say, they may resume their power upon
breach of trust, but say, they ought not to be denied when they desire those
breaches to be repaired and better fortified for time to come, and the trust
exemplified into a law as occasion shall require: Nor is it reasonable for any
Prince in the world to say, I have been trusted; and if I or my Ministers have
not in these and these particulars well discharged that trust, yet we will be
trusted still, and you shall believe that matters shall be better hereafter.

What the privileges of Parliament are, is another great question, if under
that term be comprised the King, the Lords and Commons, the question may be
better made, what is not within the power and privilege of Parliament, for
it is on all hands confessed that the commonwealth may dispose of it self; but
if the King be divided from them, what are then privileges? truly none at all,
if they cannot make a temporary provision to save themselves without the Kings
license; for take away safety, and privilege is gone; If they be safe, yet if
it be better known to their adversaries then themselves, and that the
continuance be at discretion and good pleasure of another, if any be a more
competent judge of their safety then themselves they have no privilege go at
all, say what they will. Nor can it possible be that both houses have power to
preserve the body of the Kingdom which they represent, if there be not an
inherent essential and underived authority in that assembly to preserve it
self (it is granted in the Princes minority, absence or incapassitie to govern,
the power to preserve and provide for the state, rests in the great counsel,
and their diligates, doubtless the case is the same, if it be on like manner
granted that the prince is divided from the body of his people by evil
counsel (to prove if the counsel be good or bad, examine the legalitie, it
appears in his Majesty's expresses: and that of most remarke, is to declare
law (which being denied to the great counsel, musts needs be taken to reside
in the King and his privy counsel) To have the sole managing of the Arms of
the Kingdom. And upon misprision of treason to sequester Members of Parliament
to trial in inferior Courts. If this counsel be legal, it is good. If his
Majesty were admitted the best Lawyer in the Kingdom: Yet if the laws of
this Kingdom have reserved the exposition of themselves to the Lawmakers and
not to the King the advice, to appropriate that power to himself is not good,
that they have done so, presidents are not wanting where the Judges have humbly
praid both houses to deliver their sense of a doubtful law, If these
commissions of Array and breach of privileges be declared illegal by them that
have only power to declare law in dubious cases, then the advice by which they
were done is not good, yet concerning this scruple of declaring law; It Is true
the Parliament cannot declare that to be law which is not: They cannot declare
it to be the law of the land that my brother by a second venture shall inherit
my land before my kinseman ten degrees off though thit were great reason, but
they can declare that there rests no power by virtue of any trust in any person
to convert the forces of the Kingdom to the destruction of it self. And they
may declare it Legal to stop the advenues and approches to such power if it be
attempted, His Majesty may Array, Arm and command his subjects against the
French and Spaniard not therefore to fight one against another, He may Array,
Arm, and command them to suppress Rebels so legally declared, not therefore
to oppress the Parliament, these are not very consequent to a reasonable man.

It is not strange, nor are the examples rare to find how much Princes may be
mistaken in their counselors friends and enemies; for how hardly can that man
be thought an enemy who studies nothing so much as to enlarge the power, and
advance the profit of his Prince, Yet the abundant services of some have done
more mischief to their Masters than foreign arms or combination ever could,
Was it not take for good service to invent a new revenue of 200000. l. per
annum to supply the wasted rents of the Crown. And would not he have been
esteemed rather a fool than no friend to the Kings profit that had advised to
lay that down after it was once or twice paid. Yet in his Majesty's own
Judgment that tax had better never been. And it had never been if the advice
had never been. And the advice had never been; or not been pernicious; If the
King had received the same from the greater council as he did then from the
less. I am of opinion though it rain not in Egypt, yet the inundations of
Nilies are caused by rain in another region. And the black Clouds that hung
over Scotland and their troubled waters made them think it rained somewhere,
and provide for the storm, for doubtless if the motion to absolute dominion
and ruin of all laws, had not been so visible and swist in England as it was;
The new Service book, had never brought so many thousands Scots over Tweed.

We may then conclude upon the whole matter; That that physic was not good
that brought the body of the Commonwealth into so great distemper; That the
people though a moveable body like the Ocean, yet never swell but when blown
upon by intemperate winds; That that council which has caused the King to
stake his Crown, and the kingdoms their safety, now the third time; That
has contested with the great Council for precedencie in the Kings Judgment,
and has obtained it; That broke the last Parliament by the King, and would
break this by the Kingdom: Is not good for us, nor for those discreet Gentlemen
(if they understood their own interest) that labor so much to support it. But
that in every case wherein the general state of the Kingdom is concerned, the advice that the body of the Kingdom gives, upon a view taken of it self is
not only least erroneous, but by the Law not presumed to err.

Neither can the suggestions made against this Parliament (indissouble but by
consent) any way avail to countenance a forcible dissolution, That they have
too much handled the flowers of the Crown, those that adorn the person, if not
constitute the office of the King; That they go about to crect a new
Aristocraticall Government, or rather a Tyrannical of 5. or 600. That this
Assembly is no Parliament, his Majesty dissenting; That the Major part of both
Houses are gone to the King, or have left the rest, the romnant are a faction.

To the first it is answered before; that those rights of the Crown which are
by the positive and express Laws of the Land vested in the King to uses, are
not questioned; except in case where it is manifest that the uses have been
perverted; And in that case no more is required but that the breaches be
repaired, and that the influences of his Majesty's Government may be
transmitted unto the people by better Mediums, which is no prejudice to his
Majesty, unless he imagine that he ought not to grant it, because it is
desired; That he is bound to relieve the people, but not at the peoples
request. We will take it for granted that in any case it only appertains to
our Sovereign Lord the King to defend wearing of Arms, The use of this power
vested in his Majesty is for defense of himself and subjects, and can have no
other intendment by Law and reason, but suppose by evi'l Council that may be
about a Prince (by his own unwise Election, or Gods appointment when he gives
Princes bad Councillors, or people bad Princes for scourges to wanton and
corrupted Nations;) this power is imployd to divide the Kingdom against it
self, one Faction sees this power lodged in the person of the Prince, but
never observes to what end, so sides with him. Another insist upon the end for
which he was trusted, and defend themselves by Arms: Faction begets Civil
war: Civil war dissolves the present Government; After follows a
sorraigne yoke, if our neighbor Nations be not fast asleep, or otherwise
employed: In this expectation, and in the very minute when this imminent
tempest is breaking upon our heads; the representative body of the Kingdom
prostrates it self at his Majesty's feet, and beseech him to change (not the
Government) but a few subordinate Governors, that he will shine upon his
people through transparant and unblemished crystal glasses, not through
Sanguine, Murrey, and Azure, which make the Air and Objects beheld to seem
bloody, and blue; Assuring him there is no other way to calm the Seas that
begin to rage, and to preserve from wrack the ship of the Commonwealth wherein
his Majesty is himself imbarqued, and is the greatest Adventurer. Now come in
the malignant Councillors and tell his Majesty that these humble
Supplications will (if he yield to them) turn to Injunctions: Ease them and do
them right (say they) but not at the request of Parliament; Which is no less
then to place him in a condition to do what he shall think to be right; That
is, what he shall be advised by them is right; That is (in many cases) what
ambition, hatred, covetousness, luxury, lechery, suggest to be right: That
is, flat tyranny, more absolute than the Turks.

For the Introduction of a new form of Government, the Arguments are, that if
the Parliament draw to it self the Jurisdiction of the maritime and land
forces, the power to name Councillors and Judges, or prescribe a rule for
their nomination, To make Laws (for it is all one, if the King may not deny
those that are presented to him by both Houses) to perpetuate the sitting of
this Parliament: The Soveraigntie has (if these be allowed) made no secret but
a very apparent transition from the person of the King into the persons of the
Parliament men.

The Subjects of this Kingdom have never had one Example of a Parliament that
has gone about to make themselves Lords over their brethren; And if they would
they cannot, for when they forsake the duty of their place, and the interest
of the Kingdom, the Kingdom will forsake them; and sometimes before: which
though the people have dearly repented, yet it serves to prove that the
subsistence of a Parliament is impossible if dominion, or any other end be
perceived then Reformation and preservation of the Commonwealth.

In the Minority and absence of former Kings, opportunity was far more
favorable for such a design then at this present, yet what prince was ever
hurt by his infancy or absence, when they were trusted both with his dignity
and revenue. And it is out of question, if his Majesty had been clearly
concurrent with this Parliament for the punishment of Delinquents, and
conservation of the peace, and Liberty of the Subject, they had never risen up
into so high requests; but take the Argument at the best, it follows not that
the Parliament intends to assume the Sovereign Authority, because when
Ireland is in Rebellion, England in combustion, Scotland scarce quieted, France
and Spain in Arms, they do humbly supplicate his Majesty to entrust, for a
short and limited time, the Militia under the commands of persons of Honor,
that the Lords and Commons (those whose blood and estates must defend the
State) may repose faith in: yet this is not to be granted, and the fears and
jealousies of his Majesty's best Kingdom and most obedient Subjects held so
unworthy of any regard or satisfaction, that they are esteemed and so published
for frivolous and false pretended, merely to obtain an unjust purchase out of
the Kings prerogative.

For the nomination of prime Officers, Councillors and Judges, I presume that
request results out of the precedent mis-government, and is intended only for
this time; And peradventure the temper will be better for the people, that the
King (being once environed with a wise and religious Council) appoint Judges
and public Officers, whom the people may if there be cause, accuse, and the
Parliament judge; nor would this branch of the Kings prerogative been reached
at by the people, if the Judges (who ought to be conservators of the laws, had
not been the distroyers; If the counsel of a few even in Parliament time, had
not involved the whole state in a common calamity; and contested with the Grand
Counsel of the Kingdom, assuming to themselves more zealous affection to his
Majesty, a greater care of the commonwealth, and a better dis^cerning what
was necessary and fit for both, Yet the election of public officers is not
without president in the times of former Kings; But I would not have those
Kings presidents to his Majesty, that such demands may not be president to us.

Concerning the perpetual dictatorship of the Parliament, It may be demanded,
why is the work prolonged by them, who ask why are you so long at work? why
are delinquents protected? by what means are difficulties objected? How comes
this Rebellion in Ireland? why does the Parliament spend time in providing for
their own safety? which ought to be spent in redress of public disorders
and vindication of the subjects from oppression? do they pretend fear, because
they would rule? let his Majesty render those fears apparently false, and
concur more heartily than they in securing the Kingdom, Let him grant
commissions for Ireland, let him grant Guards for the Parliament as well to
secure their fear as their danger, why should his Majesty confirm their
fears by discharging their Guards and attempting their persons, If he know
them to be safe, let them know it also, or confute their fear to the
understanding of the whole Kingdom, by granting their own ways of security,
the next way to detect those apparitions of fear if they be false. And when the
Religion of our church is vindicated; The, vigor of the Laws renewed; A Guard
of strength and terror provided for their future preservation; The Rebellion
in Ireland quelled; His Majesty's revenue examined and repaired; Particular
delinquents punished; The Court of justice reformed; The banks founded by the
industry of our Ancesters with so much blood and treasure against the
inundations of the prerogative, or malignity of private counsels repaired and
better fortified, then let us see what pretense will be made for continuation
of the Session still. The English Nation will not doubtless sell their birth
right for a mess of pottage, Nor change the government of a Prince (time nor
story remembering any other in these Kingdoms) of extraction so illustrious, of
a title so indubitable, to be ruled by their equal peradventure inferior
neighbors.

To that allegation that this assembly is no Parliament in the Kings absence;
If it be understood when he is not present, it is an opinion so ancient as
since his Majesty left the Parliament, for before I am persuaded it was never
heard of: And it must follow thereupon (as has been answered before) that by
the accedentall absence of the prince: or in sicknesses that induce
stupifaction, or in the first degrees of infancy, when the powers of the
reasonable soul have no latitude of operation, the state may be left without
means to preserve it self, which is a great absurdity to think, But if by
the Kings absence be understood the want of his voluntary concurrence in
confirmation of the Acts and Ordinances of both houses, and that in such cases
they are no Parliament, it may well be doubted if they have bin any Parliament
during this Session: For the acts that have passed his Royal assent (so much
amplified in his late declarations to the people) are shrodely suspected to be
with no great good liking of his Majesty, I am sure if they were voluntary,
they were not exhibited with due circumstances, for through that opinion, his
Majesty has lost much of the thanks due for such transcendent graces, which
no Prince, or inferior person, ought in discretion to loose. However that both
houses legally convened and authorized to sit, do not by the kings absence
loose the essence and denomination of a Parliament, appears by presidents of
former times, when in the absence of a Prince (further distant in body then his
Majesty is in mind I hope) the estates have assembled themselves (which is a
little higher then was yet in dispute) have administered oaths of fealty to
the subject, have named officers for public services, and as well to
superintend the peace of the Kingdom as the revenue of the King. And though
there was not, nor is any law authorizing the assembling of a Parliament in
such a case, yet was the legallity of that Parliament never questioned, nor
will, of any other upon the same or the like occasion, when the matter to be
treated on is the peace and safety of the Kingdom, whether the King be absent
in body or mind, it changes not the question much.

But that which is a short answer to all that can be said is: that by an Act of
all the estates, this Parliament is not disolveable, but by an Act of all the
estates, therefore a Parliament until that Act be passed.

To the other part of the allegation that Major part of both Houses have left
the rest, and are gone over to the King. It may be demanded why does not then
his Majesty send them up to adjourn the Parliament to Oxford or Cambridge, are
they so fearful of the Aprentizes of London, that they dare not appear to do
his Majesty so great a service by shouting a yea or no in the house of
Commons, how willingly would they adventure a battle that refuse to speak a
word in a crowd. Truly it were the way to put an end to all the controversy,
to reverse with ease the acts that have given so great cause of repentance, to
reduce the Parliament to terms of due obedience, to save a multitude of
offenders, to weed out of both houses those factious members that insist so
obstinately upon a trust reposed in them; to distill out of the delinquent
City of London much cordial water to save the labor, charge, and hazards of
war, to save the purses, persons, and horses of the willing Gentry, who
labor for those fetters (such is the understanding of this time) that their
fathers sweat to be rid from; For if arms be raised only against a small
malignant party, a faction of a few Parliament men: The Major number would
quickly deliver them up, and what place could afford safety for them against
the Ire of his Majesty and both houses of Parliament.

To such as put these Questions, What is the power and privilege of
Parliament, by what Law do they impose Orders upon the people without the
Kings Assent? they seem to me like them that dispute how legally the next
houses are pulled down, when the flame and winds make cruel vastation in the
beautiful buildings of a populous City: They are honest men, and would feign
be thought wise, but I doubt it is not in the orb of their understanding to
comprehend, what power resides in the vast body of the people, and how
unlimitedly that power operates, when it is animated by danger, for
preservation of it self. A man may make the same observation upon them that is
made upon Cato, who pleaded the Laws and usages of peaceable times, when the
liberty of that Commonwealth was at the last Gasp, and would not be drove
off it, till it was too late, his argument was this in effect; that the Authors
of laws for preservation of the Commonwealth, may not preserve it, but by
their own Creature. This was Cato's error and is so confessed by all men, yet
(I take it) he was a better statesman then these disputants. The King was
admitted Judge of the danger of the Commonwealth before the Parliament, and it
was apparent for no other reason, but the better to leavy money, shall the
Parliament sitting be a less competent Judge? As though a Physician that says
you are not well, though you do not perceive it, give me 5. or 10. pieces I Will
cure you, shall be better believed then the man that has been wasted with a
Quotidian Fever 16 years together. They talk what the Parliament may do, and
what not, as though this were the Parliament that made an Act for pavement of
an high way, and had little other work. Truly if regulation of a Trade, or
creation of a Tenure, or Erection of a Corporation were the Question in a
peaceable time, it were easily resolved, that the Kings demurre should stand
for a denial, but to say the Kingdom may not defend and secure it self, who
ever says to the contrary, is to fight against the oldest and best known Law
in nature, the Center of all Laws, and the inseparable right of all Kingdoms,
Corporations, and Creatures. But they say the Kingdom is in no such danger;
who is a better Judge then the representative body of the Kingdom it self?
not those that say so. Who like a man that standing upon the beach at Dover
will not believe that the Sea has any shore toward France, until he be
brought to the top of the Hill. It is not within their view to tell better then
the Parliament whether there be danger or not. His Majesty indeed has the
most eminent place to observe what Collection of Clouds are in any quarter of
the Heaven, and what weather it will be, but his calculations (supposed to be
made by others from a lower ground) are therefore not so well believed. But be
it in danger or none, it matters not much, the Laws have been in danger, (none
will deny) and were recovered by another danger or had been lost: If it be now
peace (as these men say) it is the better time to secure them, if it be not
peace, it is well to save the Commonwealth by any means whatsoever, and if the
King concur not so speedily as the occasion requires, the blame is not theirs
that go before for his preservation and their own.

To make an end, I wish an union of the three Kingdoms, under the same
Government, Ecclesiastical and Civil (if it be possible) that this Crown
having three such supporters, and surrounded with the salt waters, at Unity,
at Liberty, at Peace in it self, may not sear the whole forces of the
disjoynted continent of Europe, That his Majesty would understand his Interest
to be, to unite, not to divide his Subjects, and to remember with what manner
of Tropheyes the magnanimous Princes of former times have adorned their
Funerals and Fame. That he will choose rather to fight in the head of the
British Armies, for restitution of his Nephews to their lost Inheritance, than
employ them here to pillage and destroy his own subjects; That he will first
command the hearts, then the persons, then the Estates of his Subjects, and not
begin at the wrong end: That in the Parliament may reside a Spirit of that
Latitude and Nobleness which ought to dwell in an Assembly of so much Honor
and Gravitie, That just things be done for justice sake, without bowing less
or more for the raging of popular surges in the South, or for the cold winds
that blow from the North: That the conditions of peace may not be enhansed by
any prosperous success, but like the Noble Roman before and after the
victory the same: That his Majesty may be convinced of the Error of his
private Councels, by finding in the Grand Council a quiet repose and a stable
foundation of peace and plenty to his Royal Person and Family. And lastly
(since his Majesty and his people thus divided cannot be happy) that with
all convenient Expedition, such as have studied this division between the Head
and the Body, may have their heads divided from their bodies. So farewell.

FINIS.
