shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake.

Heb. 11.26. Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches then the treasure

LONDON, Printed in the Year of our Lord, 1654.

The fourteenth day of August at the general Assizes holden at Lancaster.
Judge Nudigate said openly in his charge at Lancaster in the face of the whole
County, giving reproachful language upon those people whom the world calls
Quakers, and many scandals and false aspertions he cast upon them in his
charge: and he spoke there publicly, and said, that the Principles that they
held, which is the light within, would lead into all manner of sin: and he said
further, that there was a man before them at Newcastle, which had committed
adultery with a woman, and when they asked him why he did so, he said, he was
moved of the Lord, this he affirmed in his charge at Lancaster, the truth of
which will appear as follows.

Newcastle seventeenth day of the month called September.
THese may certify all Friends, concerning the accusation of the Judge of me
Cuthbert Hunter of adultery and fornication, in the Town and Court of
Newcastle the second day of the sixth month called August, which is here
briefly, and simply, and plainly, as follows: An Information being red,
wherein I was accused of fornication, and adultery, and diverse other things, as
that I was not married, and I answered and said, that in fornication I deny,
for it is false, for I am married: He asked me where I was married? I said, I
took my wife seven miles from this place; he asked me if I was married with a
Justice? and I said no; he said I had broke the Law, for there was an Act that
all that was to be married was to be married with a Justice: I asked him, why
the Priests did marry? then he asked me when I was married? I said I was
married in the year 1653. the third month of that year, called May: he asked me
if I were married? with a Minister? and I said, no I was not; and he said, I
had broke the Laws of man and the Law of God, for which I was to be punished:
then I desired him to prove before that people wherein, and he said, take him
away and let him either find sureties or go to prison; and I said, I would
find none, for I said, I know no Law I had broken, but that which is contrary
to the Law of God: and then his Officers called of the Jayler to take him away
and these are the words which were spoken at that time.

As for that when he asked me, why I did so, I said, I was moved of the Lord,
is false, and was never thought non spoken by me.

Dear friends, this is to certify of the manner of my marriage, and when I was
married, and how I took to me a wife, according to the example I found in the
Scripture, that holy men of God did take to themselves wives, but I could not
find where ever any of the Ministers of God took money for marrying of any, as
these Ministers did then, therefore according to that example I found among the
Saints, we did bequeath to each other before witness, in the presence of the
Lord, before whom we shall give an account, the Father of the woman being
there, so I became to her a husband, and she to me a wife, and so I own her
before all people; this was in the year 1653. in the third month of that year,
called May, it was about half a year before I owned the Truth, as a testimony
of which I subscribe my name Cuthbert Hunter.

We whose names are here subscribed are satisfied that this is a true
testimony, George Arey, Tho. Arey, Agnus Ewbanck, Mary Arey, Tho. Turner,
Richard Ewbanck, Lamclet Warde^ll.

Whereas Judge Nudigate did say in his charge at Lancaster, that the light, the
principle which we hold in every one, does lead unto all manner of sin.

The light which comes from Christ Jesus, which he does enlighten every one
that comes into the world withal, is the condemnation of all sin, wickedness,
uncleanness and ungodliness, and the light, which is our principle, as he
calls it, in every man, will witness against the said Nudigate, who is called
a Judge, and does witness against sin, and the same Light will witness
Christ, and make every tongue to confess, and is the condemnation of all that
hate it, whose deeds be evil. Oh that ever such should be set up to be a
Judge, who utters forth such blasphemy, that to say (the light which he does
enlighten every man that comes into the world withal, John 1.9. to it in every
man, which we speak of, which is the light of Christ, which is the condemnation
of all sin and unrighteousness of all them that hate it) it should lead to
commit all manner of sin, as Judge Nudigate said in his charge: Here thou art
manifest to be no Judge for God, but judged with the just. And the light in
every man's conscience, which comes from Christ, will and does witness against
thee, that thy judgment is false, and speaks a lie, who is out of the truth,
and speaks of thy self, and the light in thy own conscience, which comes from
Christ, witnesses against thee: For to the light in every ones conscience,
Judge Nudigate, with it shall thou be proved, whether it leads into all manner
of sin, or whether it testifies against all manner of sin, let it in all
consciences, the judge, whether thou be a Judge for God yea or nay; that in thy
conscience shall be a witness against thee, and witness me, and be a witness
for God against thee. That which shows thee ungodliness and sin, and manifests
it, is light, and the light does not lead into the sin, but leads out of the
sin, and testifies against it: And this am I moved to give forth, who am a
witness to the light in all tender consciences, which is a witness against
all sin, whose minds are turned with the light toward Christ. And thou who
should be a Judge upon the evil, art found to be a Judge upon the good (the
light) let the light in all consciences bear witness against thee, which
witnesses against evil, and leads not into it, who here has manifested thy
self, that thou art darkness, and does not comprehend light, but at it
stumbles; and the Scripture is fulfilled upon thee, the saying of John, Light
shines in darkness, and darkness does not comprehend it: And if you walk in
the light you have fellowship one with another: and the blood of Jesus
cleanses from all sin: and here again thou may see how contrary to the
Scripture thou art, for in the light which leads out of sin is the unity, for
the Law of God takes hold upon them who act contrary to the light the light
witnesses the law, and the law witnesses the light, and the law is a Judge
upon them who walk contrary to the light, and it is not a Judge upon them who
walk in the light; here let the light in all consciences be a witness against
thee, the which light witnesses against all sin, and finds thee in the sin and
the blasphemy, who says, the light leads into all sin, which light is thy
condemnation, the light of him that does evil and hates the light, as you may
read John 3. And for the false accusation of the said Judge Nudigate, which did
accuse Cuthbert Hunter for adultery and fornication, because he took a wife
before witness, and was not married with the Priests of the world, which marry
people for money, and for giving of them a form of words for money, but took a
wife according to the manner he found in the Scripture (witnesses) the holy men
of God, and did not go to the Priests to give them money, but took before
witness, and denied the Priests for giving them money for marrying, for there
is no such example in the Scripture, that the Priests were to have so much for
marrying people. And this Judge Windham says, it is contrary to the Law of
God, and contrary to the Law of man, which all may see it is a false
accusation, for the Law of God witnesses the same, that which Judge Nudigate
calls adultery; so whom the Lord joyneth together let no man put asunder, the
marriage that is honorable, the bed that is not defiled, all the children of
the light does it witness, and honor it, but all marriages that are contrary
to the light, God does not join together; that marriage is not honorable, that
bed is defiled, all that is joined there in that nature contrary to the light,
together with that which is contrary to the light, all this is with the light
to be condemned, and not honorable, for there the bed is defiled, all
Covetousnesses, and the Whoremongers, and the Adulterers, such marriages,
contrary to the light, God does not join together, but is with the light seen
and condemned; the bed that is defiled is not honorable, and there is
hardness of heart, and putting asunder, but whom God joins together let no
man put asunder, and such whom God does join together with his Light, for God
is Light, and the children of light, which be in his Light, does witness his
joining, as the Scripture declares; and such does the world call Adultery: As
for example, Judge Nudigate, because they are not married with a Priest, or
joined together with a carnal Law, but takes one another before witnesses, as
the manner of the holy men of God was.

And though the said Cuthbert Hunter did take his wife after the example of the
Saints in Scripture, he was not then brought into the truth, for it was half a
year before he owned the truth; and as for saying to the Judge, that the Lord
moved him, that was another false accusation.

And all the children of light, which sees God and are of God, does the
marriage see that be honorable, and does them see whom God joins together,
let no man put asunder, and the marriage that is not honorable is with the
Light seen and judged, and all the Whoremongers and Adulterers, which is
contrary to the Light comprehended and condemned, in which light all the
children of light dwell, and have unity, praises, praises to the Lord God for
ever. And the said Judge that stumbles at the light, and said it led into all
sin, knows not the marriage that is honorable, whose condemnation is with the
light, the light in thy conscience is my witness; and all who are not joined
together with God are not moved of the Lord, and a condemnation must go upon
all the marriages that are not moved of the Lord, and joined together by the
Lord, for they are not honorable, and them that men or women join together,
contrary to the light, are with the light condemned, and sundred from the
honorable marriage in the defiled bed.

The examination of them the world calls Quakers at Lancaster.
WE are moved to declare the Triyall betwixt us, the prisoners of the Lord,
and Tho. Shaw Priest of Aldingam, who by his three Constables did apprehend our
bodies, and bring us to Lancaster, to answer such accusations as Priest Shaw
could lay to our charge. We were brought into the Court by the Priest and his
Constables, before the Judge there sitting: We coming single before him, cying
the Lord alone, and not man, with our hats on, they took them off our heads,
standing before him a little space; the Warrants against us was read before the
Judge: The Judge asked Priest Shaw what witness he had; Shaw answered James
Chambers. We answered to our names as we were called, and to committed into the
Jaylors hand too among thieves behind the bar, and said little, but that
Thomas Hatton told the Judge, he was moved of the Lord to speak against the
deceit in him; whereupon the Judge told Priest Shaw he might go and get his
Inditements drawn against us: whereupon the Priest went forth of the Court to
get them done against the afternoon, and in the afternoon we were brought
before the Judge again, and the Inditements which the Priest had drawn against
us was read; then the Judge asked the Priest if he had no more witnesses, the
Priest said, none but my self and James Chambers, whereupon they were both
sworn, that we came maliciously to disturb him.

And the Judge asked the Priest, what Waters Mires spoke to him when he was
preaching, the Priest answered the Judge, that he said come down thou liar: The
Judge asked the Priests man what he heard him speak, he answered and said, that
Waters Mires said come down thou foul beast, and they swore both, the Priest
and his man, that Waters Mires spoke these words the last New-yeares day:
whereupon the Judge asked Waters Mires what he said, to this that the Priest
and the man laid to his charge, Waters Mires answered, that he was not at Tho.
Shaw the last New-yeares day: the Judge said, was you not there, did you not
disturb him? Waters Mires said, I was there, but it was a year and a half
since: The Judge said unto the Priest, he confesses he was there, but it is a
year and a half since; whereupon Priest Shaw answered, he had other things in
his mind, he could not certainly tell the words: the Judge asked Waters Mires,
if he called him liar and foul beast, Waters Mires answered, that he called him
beast, but not foul beast, so that that was a lie: The Judge asked him, how he
could make it appear that he taught lies? Waters Mires answered, in acting
those things that Christ forbids, in taking the chiefest place in the
Assemblies, being called of men Master, and is a hireling, which Christ cried
woe against, and in taking Tithe: The Judge asked if he had any more to say, or
any for him?

Thomas Hutton answered, he was a covetous hireling, and took Tithe of those
that had their children going a begging, which Christ gave no such commission
to those he sent forth, but sent them forth without bag, or scrip, or two
coats, or a stick to defend them, but freely they had received freely give,
this is the commission, first and last, that Jesus Christ gives to those he
sends forth, if any know of another let them speak, but all was silent; but the
Judge said, them which serve at the Altar should live by the Altar; Thomas
Hutton answered no other rule but what the Apostle says, If any man plant a
Vineyard he may eat of the fruit thereof, and all was silent.

Thomas Hutton was called, to answer to the bill of Indictment laid against him
by Thomas Shaw: the Judge asked Shaw what witnesses he had, he said, James
Chambers and my self; and they swore, that Thomas Hutton came while he was
preaching, and said, he was a dtunkard, and a liar: whereupon the Judge asked
if he made a disturbance in the Congregation; the Priests man said yes, many of
the people went out with him, and had more mind to hear him then to stay in the
Church: Whereupon the Judge asked Thomas Hutton how he could answer these
things; the Priest said, my Lord, my neighbors knows I am no drunkard nor
liar: Thomas Hutton answered, I was moved of the Lord to cry against him for
deceiving the people, and in teaching lies, which was as a fire in my bosom
until I had delivered it, he made them believe this lie, that the
Steeple-house was holier than another place, by his old form of prayer, in
saying, how dreadful is this place, as if the Temple were up again, which was
a figure of Christ in his Saints; and further, that we may spend this sacred
day in this sacred place, and so deceives the simple, in making them believe,
that a house of wood and stone is the Temple or the House of God, which is a
horrible lie and deceit: the Judge said, did not Christ preach in the Temple,
and whip out them that bought and sold; Thomas Hutton said, the Temple was a
figure of Christ in his Saints, which they witness him to whip out all sin; so
Steven went into the Temple, and witnessed forth the Substance, and told them,
that God that made the world and all things therein, dwelt not in Temples made
with hands: And the Apostle says, ye are the Temples of the living God, as
God has said, I will dwell in you, and walk in you: And Christ told the woman,
that neither in this place, nor at Jerusalem, but they that worship the Father
must worship in spirit and in truth; And Thomas Shaw was telling the people,
that none could be perfect here, and yet his Text was, strive to make your
calling and election sure, whereupon Thomas Hutton told him before the people,
that election was perfect, and whosoever witnesses election witnesses
perfection, yea, sin and transgression finished: The Judge said, I wish we were
perfect: Thomas Hutton answered, he that is born of God sins not, but does
witness the birth to be perfect, the Temple holy and the Kingdom pure; and
further, Thomas Hutton told Thomas Shaw that he and the people sung lies to God
in singing David's conditions, which they could not witness, nor his Spirit:
the Judge answered, has not Psalms been sung in the Churches of England
continually? Thomas Hutton said, none ought to sing further than they can
witness his condition: And they asked him, how he could prove Priest Shaw a
drunkard: Thomas Hutton answered, he was drunk in sin, in covetousness and
pride, taking Tithe of those that have their children go a begging; so the
Judge said, we must go on according to Law.

Thomas Curram was called to answer to the bill of Indictment laid against him
by Thomas Shaw; the Judge asked Priest Shaw what witnesses he had? the Priest
said, none but himself and James Chambers, who said he could not remember what
Thomas Curram said, and yet afterward he was called again, and swore, that
Thomas Curram said, come down thou liar: The Judge asked Thomas Curram what he
said to it? Thomas answered, he spoke no such words: the Judge said, was you
not there? Tho. Curram said, I was there: the Judge asked him what he did say?
Thomas answered and said, he was a blind guide; the Priest said, Thomas,
wherein am I a blind guide? Thomas answered, God is to be worshipped in spirit
and in truth, but all thy preaching and praying, and singing is in forms.

At the last Assizes holden at Apulby August the tenth. I Henry Howsman was to
appear about two fellows there.
CAll Henry Howsman, says the Clark, Henry Howsman of Lupton come near, so I
coming nearer, the Officers cried, put of thy hat, but I not regarding much,
one took it off, and gave it me again; so going into the nearer room before the
bench, I put it on again, which caused many to cry out, put it off, and the
Judge began to be angry with me, and some of them struck it off: and the Judge
said, he would teach me what I did in that place; I said, I was in the presence
of God every day about my labors as well as then, and my conscience told me,
that I did work and had my hat on before the Lord; well, says the Judge, I
know that, and that I am no better than thou, neither think better of my self,
but I must teach thee to give honor here, hold him the book, said they, lay on
your hand and be sworn, says the Judge, concerning these two men: I am sworn
to speak the truth always and now also, and that book says, swear not all:
well, says the Judge, that is in your Communications, but when you are before
Authority you must swear the truth to end controversy: I said, I did witness
the life in measure that gave forth that book, which would witness against me
afterward if I did not speak the truth, as the Scripture says, I will be a
swift witness against the false swearer and the false accuser: says the
Judge, Fox tells you so, he has learned you that doctrine; and I stood quiet
and silent: come, says the Jude, lay on your hand, and others cried the same
thing, else the Jury cannot believe you; I said, I could not help it if they
were unbelievers: the Judge said, well friend, if you will not you will forfit
your Q^u nisants, for you are tied to prosecute the Law against these men, I
said I was, and as I heard done so I should do then, I was willing to hold up
my hand as a sign, which I hope is not contrary to the Law: well said he, you
had best take heed, for there are many false Foxes; but I was silent; and he
said moreover, that he would lay a fine upon my head for not prosecuting.

Christ Jesus says, swear not at all, who spoke with authority, and thou, who
art a Judge, says, when one is before authority he must swear the truth, and
here thy authority is contrary to Christ's, and who is in the truth is in the
doctrine of Christ, who says, swear not at all, and he that swears is out of
the truth, for Christ Jesus is the truth, the way and the life, and he says,
swear not at all, and thou says, this is but in their Communications, and yet
in this thy Communication thou would have him to swear, and all who are out of
the truth acts thus in confusion.

Thomas Ralingson being moved to go to Lancaster, and walking in the streets,
he that was the Sheriffs Trumpeter that sounded before the Judge, fell upon the
said Thomas Ralingson, that had been speaking to a Priest, and threw him down,
and struck him rudely, wickedly and desperately, and afterward run after him,
and got a stick and struck him before many people, and abused him that did not
give him any word: And another day he met the said Thomas Ralingson, and struck
him, and abused him, and drew blood on him.

Now you that be Rulers, Judge and Sheriff, who has no more rule over your
own men, but bring such peace-breakers and strikers in the highway, without
any molestation, here all may see, you that suffer such things, how you
strengthen the hands of evil doers, of strikers and bloud-shedders against the
innocent, and you suffer this to go unpunished: say you, they should keep
peace, and you keep a man to break peace, and the said Trumpeter went up to the
Goal, and threw a stone into the Goal among some prisoners, which have lain
in a year because they could not pay the Priest Tithes, and he broke therewith
the face of Richard Mire, one of the prisoners, and made him bleed sore,
shedding much of his blood, and of Thomas Raling sons before, this was the
Sheriffs Trumpeter, that sounded before the Judge, who after that went up into
the prison among the prisoners, and beat Richard Asburner in the prison, and
then opened a Coffer which was in the Goal, where the prisoners had things,
and took out of it many books and packs, and carried them away.

The word of the Lord to thee Nudigate, who goes by the name of a Judge, and
should take upon thee the seat of Justice, and in the execution of thy place
thou goes about to accuse the just, and to flander the innocent, and to speak
evil of things thou know not, and goes about to strengthen the hands of the
wicked against the people of God, and suffered them to be beat, and abused, and
persecuted by those that was under thy own authority. and that thou saw with
thy own eyes, but for which know assuredly, that the just and righteous God
will be avenged of all such unrighteous ones as thou, before him who is the
righteous God of heaven and earth shall thou, and all such as thou, be
arraigned to give an account for the thing done in the body, for all thy
actions is upon record before the Lord God of heaven and earth, that thou have
done and suffered to be done to the servants of the most high God, and the
Judgments of God thou shall not escape: Thou that should be a Minister of the
Law, and a Minister of Justice and equity over the people, but in thy place
thou have ministered untruths, scandals and reproaches and false accusations
upon the innocent, and has blasphemed the Name of God in saying, that the
light leads into sin: And whereas Christ Jesus says, I am the light of the
world, and does enlighten every one that comes into the world; And this light
every particular has a measure of, which, thou says, leads into sin, and this
is the condemnation of the world, the light, and such as thou loves darkness
rather than light, because thy deeds are evil, the light is thy condemnation;
and thou that says, the light leads into sin, has made it manifest, that thou
art not a child of light, but a child of darkness, for God is light, and in
him is no darkness at all; and in thy dark natural mind, which knows not the
things of God, which art in the envy and strife, which is out of the light,
which is with the light to be condemned; in this mind thou utters forth
scandals and reproaches upon the children of the light, which live in the
light, and walk in the light, which thou knows nothing of, but art an enemy
too, but to the light in thy conscience I speak, which shines in darkness, and
darkness comprehends it not, which light, if thou hearken to it which checks
thee, it will let thee see that thou ought not to lie, nor to stander, nor to
blaspheme the Name of God, nor to speak evil of things thou knows not; and if
thou would hearken to it, it would lead thee to Justice, Equity and
Righteousness, for the light of God in every ones conscience is just and
righteous, and leads to Justice, and Equity, and out of sin, and if thou would
hearken to it, it would let thee see thy gross darkness and blasphemy, that
thou should say, that leads into sin, which is pure and cannot sin, the light
which is and ever was the Saints Teacher, and it shall be thine eternal
condemnation, for all thy hard speeches that ever thou have spoken; Oh be
ashamed and tremble before the Lord God, that thou should utter forth such
untruths, and make thy folly so manifest in a place where thou ought to do
justice.

And a Warning to thee, and all that ever takes upon them that place, to beware
of speaking evil of things you know not, you may read your portion in Jude; and
the children of the light, who walk and dwell in the light, and bring their
deeds to the light, that they may be proved and tried, them you cannot touch,
and the scandals laid upon them by the children of darkness, are by the
children of light made manifest, and set in their own places where they ought
to be, and herein is the truth cleared, and false accusers of truth are made
manifest; and the light, which thou says leads into sin, shall stand, and make
manifest all works of iniquity, and by it thou art eternally condemned.

FINIS.
