England, being Elected after the death of the King, viz. * William Earl of
Salisbury * Henry Nevil Carew Rawleigh William Eyres Philip Jones Thomas Birch.


All those that are marked with the Hand, were the Kings Judges, and condemned
him to Death under their Hands and Seals; All those that are marked with the
Star, are such Members as did not sit after the Secluded Members admission into
the House.

THis is published by Command of a Member of the Long Parliament, to prevent
mistakes, and that the people of this Nation may see and know who have been
their Oppressors, and the fatal Betrayers of their Liberties, by erecting High
Courts of Justice, and acting many other Enormities etc. And that they may be
the better guided in their FUTURE ELECTIONS.
