blazon or coat of arms incorporating the Commonwealth Flag (1649-1651)A
DECLARATION OF THE Parliament of the Commonwealth of ENGLAND, for a time of
Public Thanksgiving, upon the Five and twentieth of this instant August, for
the great Victory lately vouchsafed to their Fleet at SEA.
IT having pleased the Lord, after those many signal Tokens of his presence
with his People in this Nation, in the several Straights and Changes, through
which he has by a mighty Hand and an outstretched Arm led them hitherto, Yet
again to manifest his wonted power and goodness to them in that late and great
Success of our Fleet at Sea, when it pleased the Lord at the end of July last,
so to bless the Forces of this Commonwealth engaged by the Dutch (who by
Advantages not a few, to humane Appearances, were likely to have prevailed) as
that after a most sharp and doubtful encounter, he Crowned us with Victory, and
made our Enemies to feel the Stroke of his Righteous Hand against them, who
have abundantly manifested it to be in their Intentions to have made us
(wearied by a long Intesttine War) a spoil to their Avarice and Ambition, by
their first unjust Invasion of us, and their earnest prosecuting since of a War
against us, notwithstanding all the endeavors used on our part to compose so
sad, and to us so unwelcome a Breach between the two Nations: We being desirous
to be deeply sensible hereof before the Lord, and bearing also in mind what
cause we have at all times to make mention of his Name in this Nation, with all
humble and thankful Acknowledgements, but especially when he has thus
seasonably made bare his Holy Arm in this late Mercy, before the eyes of all
the Nations round about us, Have thought it requisite at a particular time, and
in an especial manner to acknowledge the Hand and Goodness of our God to us in
this great Work which he has wrought for us; And we have therefore set apart
Thursday the Five and twentieth of this present August, for the end aforesaid.
And in regard the Mercy is general, and we hope will be of great advantage to
this whole Commonwealth, and to all that fear God in it; We do earnestly desire
them to contribute their help in this great Work of Thankfulness to the Lord,
and to suffer us to call upon them, to sing together with us unto the Lord a
new Song, He has dealt bountifully with us, for his mercy endures for ever;
and that as the Lord shall move and direct them, they would seriously set
themselves in his presence and praise him, together with us, that so we may all
with one Heart and Voice, offer up a free Sacrifice of Prayer and of Praise,
and all of us endeavor in our several Stations, to improve so great a
Deliverance to the alone Glory of our great God, and the good of his People
throughout the World.
