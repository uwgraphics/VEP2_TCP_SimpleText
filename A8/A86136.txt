A TRIUMPHANT PANEGYRIC In honor and Memory of King Charles the Second HIS
CORONATION.
LEt not Rome boast her Obelisks,
nor Caesar triumphs make:
If Albion her Prince to attend
in splendour undertake.
Their Chariots were with Tygres drawn
in days of greatest state:
But Charles is drawn with Cherubins,
the heavens attend his Fate.
Mention not Aegypts Pyramids,
nor Rhodes great colosse here;
W' admit of no such Pagentry
in this our Hemisphere.
Angels above, Kingdoms below,
that lean upon this Arm;
Cry touch not mine anointed now:
nor do my Prophets harm.
A Diadem of perfect gold
adorned with many a gem,
With all the wealth that India boasts
are sacrificed to him.
He that endured an Ostracisme
in many a foreign land,
Does now captiv'ty captive lead,
strokes Panthers tame with his hand.
The bloody Tents of Tamberlain
are turned to white again:
No crying, no complaining now
but Jubilates amain.
Those channels and those rivers too
that ran with blood and gore,
Flow both with milk and honey now,
as Canaan did before.
Medalls of gold and silver both
throughout the street are thrown:
The Altars reak, the Bonefires flame,
the Bells attend the Throne.
London with all her Companies
her Banners does display;
The Cities of the Nations round
in her their homage pay.
She Is now arrayed in loyalty;
her Trophies she does bring,
And lay them down as Tribute due
this day to Charles her King.
White Hall her candor re-assumes:
Westminster's loyal too:
Court, City, Country, Sea and Land,
each others strive t'outdo.
Cushan-Rushathaim that spread,
the Kingdoms ore and ore,
Lies shipwrackt now, and prostitute,
like Dagon at's own door.
Rebellion in's own chains is bound,
and Treason's stricken dumb;
The amazed world to see this change,
does here in numbers come.
Whole Hecatombs of Loyal hearts
are Holocausted here:
The great triumphal Arches of
the City make it appear.
They stand like lofty Pyramids
to out-dare the glaring Sun:
Adorned with Myryads, that to pay
Allegiance here do come.
The heads of all our Archontes,
and Nantes too, are found
With Chaplets all of Cynamon,
and Laurel to be Crowned:
Our Ephori, and Amphictiones,
together marshalled are:
With them march the Conipides,
sons both of Peace and War.
Here Is Gobria, and Gabatha,
great Counselors of State:
Here Is Jareb, and here is Elnathan,
on this Procession wait.
Here York and Lancaster are met,
the Red-rose and the White;
Our Lilies and our Lions join,
and heaven and earth unite.
The Prelate and the Potentate,
with all the Martial train;
The Lamb, the Lion, Fox and Kyd,
attend their Sovereign.
The Ball, the Scepter, and the Crown,
with Robes of Royalty:
By Nobles and by Princes born,
Ensigns of Majesty.
Moab a loathed washpot is
ore Edom's cast a shoe,
And Juda's still Gods Lawgiver,
against what the Devil can do.
Balam himselfe's forbid to curse,
and forced to bless this day:
The old and subtle Exorcist;
is taught from heaven to pray.
Blasted, and blister'd, be their tongues,
that practice not to sing,
In this our glorious festival,
God save great Charles our King.
Gloria in Excelsis, 'sung above,
while Conduits here below,
With all our costly Aquaeducts,
with French and Spanish flow.
The Pennons of the Seraphims
stretch ore his Royal Throne;
Cyrcling both Crown and Canopy,
of this our Solomon.
We burn no Oil but Balsamum,
within our Temples now:
Great Constantine in days of state
taught us the manner how.
This is great Englands Jubilee,
it sets all Prisoners free:
Proclaims a Manumission too
for all love liberty.
Accursed be the Bethlite now,
that shall attempt to build,
That Jerico whose walls did bow,
at Charles victorious shield.
With health, and wealth, and victory,
as tribute of the day:
The heaven of heavens preserve our King
let all the Nations pray.
By S. H. a Banstedian.
-- Mart majori
Maximus hic Rex est, and luce serenior ipsa,
Pax una triumphis
In muneris potior. --
Nunquam libertas gratior extat quam sub Rege Pio.
