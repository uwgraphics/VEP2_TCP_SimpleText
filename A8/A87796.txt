A COPY OF A LETTER Writ from Sergeant Major KIRLE, to a friend in Windsor.
SIR,
YOu were pleased to command a constant account from me, as the only requital
you would receive for admitting me an Officer in the Parliament Army; and
though diverse things have come from us, which have been either doubted or
contradicted, and seem to have no other credit then the close Committee; yet
what I am now about to tell you, shall run none of those dangers, but that with
a great deal of confidence you may report, both in public to the House, and
in private to my friends that I am now at Oxford; nor shall your wonder last
long for by that time I have declared upon what grounds at first I undertook
that service, and upon what reasons I have since deserted it, I shall without
doubt (where there is charity or reason) free my self from the imputation of
dishonor, and undeceive others that are as I was, seduced.

About the time these distempers began here, I returned from serving the Swede
in Germany, and the States in Holland, in both which Countries; I can without
vanity say, I did nothing to the dishonor of my own, as this absence made me
ignorant of the condition of the Kingdom; so it rendered me more inclinable to
receive an employment from the Parliament: for though neither my youth, nor
this profession are curious after the affairs of State; yet so common were the
grievances in that unhappy concture of time, when I went abroad, that I
retained the same impressions in me at my coming home, especially when I saw
the complaints remain, but did not know that the causes were taken away: thus
possessed with prejudice, it was no hard thing for me to believe, that the
pretenses of the war (in themselves so specious) and the employment therein,
to be full of Honor, Justice and Piety; and that there needed not the
importunity of my nearest friends, or an argument from the necessity their
former severity had cast upon me, nor an invitation from your self, to seek
for the preferment you speedily procured me.

How have I behaved my self, while I was of your mind, and in that service
will be best judged by those, that know that from a Lieutenant I was soon
preferred to be Captain of a Troop raised to my hand: and shortly after, to be
Sergeant Major to the Earl of Stamfords Regiment of horse: what prisoners I
took, what contribution I brought in, what places and Towns I secured,
appears by the testimony given of me, and the thanks I received from you. It
is not therefore Necessity has made me leave you to go to the King, from whom
you have taken not only his revenues which should give him bread, but the
benevolences (as far as in you lies) of his People that should maintain his
Army. It is not ambition, to forsake a certain benefit for an uncertain
employment, and (in justice) as doubtful a pardon: It is not malice for any
particular neglect or injury, for I must confess no man recieved greater
kindness from his superior Officers, or more ample thanks from your selves
then I hrve done; nocivill humane respect, but a perfect discovery of those
false lights, that have hithetto misled me, and the deep apprehension of the
horror which attends the persevering in such errors.

I must confess (though you would little think it) that Master Sedgwicke
Chaplain to that Regiment, first opened my Eyes, and moved me to that
refliction upon my self, which set me since in the right way; not by his
persuasions or conversion, (for I can assure you, you may still confide in him)
but by the spirit (not that pretended to of meekness and peace but) of fury
and madness; he revealed the misery of this war, and in his inspired rage,
brake the shell (Religion, safety of the King, Liberty and Propriety) and
showed us the kernel (Atheism, Anarchy, arbytrary government and confusion)
what was meant else by his saucy and impertinent talking to God Almighty, whom
he seemed rather to command then entreat? what was meant else by his traducing
the King, and cursing him, while he seemed to pray for him; and presently with
a tone as gentle as his language magnify the Worthies, the Estates assembled
in Parliament; what was meant else by encouraging violence, and sharing in
things plundered? not had one man given me a just prejudice of the cause, but
that I saw the whole lump of these pseudo-clergy, seasoned with the same
leaven, who hate (and so instruct the people) an innocent ceremony, but thirst
after blood, who abhor learning and Bishops, but adore ignorance and
devision, who while they are severe (and therein they do well) against
drunkenness and adultery, and they make robbery rebellion sacrilege and
murder, become virtues, because they are in order to effect their designs; and
truly I had not trusted my ears, if the same and much more had not been
confirmed by my eyes; for those few Regements then with us, were a perfect
model of the whole Army; and most certain I am, that all the Officers of no
one* Company were all of the same opinion what Religion they fought for: Some
loved the book of Common Prayer and Bishops, others were zealous for
extemporary prayers and Elders, another thought Bishops so many Elders, and
Elders so many Bishops, and therefore they fought to set Jesus Christ in his
throne (meaning) independency: Some liked the Chaplain of the Regement,
another thought his Corporal preached better; some had so much of the spirit
they wanted courage, and when they should fight, thought it better to pray, or
else declared it was revealed unto them they should be beaten, and to fulfill
the prophecy, threw down their Arms; and one would think, that every Company
had been raised out of the several Congregations of Amsterdam, who wanted not
Scripture for every mutiny, who plunder and call it Gods providence who if they
cannot prove any of quality to be a Papist, yet as he is a Gentleman he shall
want grace; and that is title enough to possess the estates of all that are
more richer then themselves: and in truth had it not been for this persuasion,
you might have made riots but not a war; for under the promise of Malignants
estates, are included, not only those that directly take part with the King but
all those too that shall not concur with you in all things; hence it is that
those were thought meritorious, who voted Bishops out of the House of Peers,
but are become Malignants, because they will not put them out of the Church;
hence some that contributed with a large hand to this war, received marks of
favor, but are become Malignants, because they will not give all that they are
worth; hence those that in tumults creid for justice were worthy of thanks, but
are become Malignants, because they will help to depose the King: I shall not
need to tell what dishonorable and indirect means have been used to these
ends, what burdens have been laid upon weak consciences of some men by
Divines, what preferment have been promised to some, what threatenings have been
used to others; the sending of Horses, money, plate, shall expiate for past
sins, or cover others which by their busy emissaries they have^ found out,
and will otherwise discover* he that has power in his Country and will use it
for you may oppress his neighbor, who must not sue him because he is in their
service, and if he would be revenged it is no hard thing, to procure a warrant
and the Sergeants man, and lay him up till he find an accusation, or produce
one he never means to prove. I could instance in diverse, who have been by
these alurements, invited to this war, and so to the ruin both of themselves
and families; nor can I forget that more obvious artifice, which has made the
press the fruitful Mother of many Bastards; when the taking three scouts in
an Alehouse, has been made at London, a Castle and the defeat of a Regiment,
and Cler. Parl. has made the pamphlet sell for a truth, when a defeat has been
voted a victory, and to muse the people an Order has been made, that God
should be thanked for it; and indeed the Officers at last found that to tell
truth when they had the worst; sometimes endangered their casheering, always
procured them an ill opinion; and when they saved the labor of doing the
contrary, they were the better used and therefore of late have justly wracked
betwixt this Scylla and Charibdis, while they rather complied with their humor
then obeyed Truth, so that Religion is but the reverent name for blood and
ruin; and it is most evident, it was only used as a disguise, that we might
with the more case devour one another, which nature otherwise would forbid us
to do.

Next to this, nothing wrought more upon me, then that strange mystery, that
fighting for the safety of the King, was shooting at him, as at Edgehill and
else where, where I thank God I was not; for sure the apprehension is ^o horrid
unto me, that had. I been in that action, the wounds of my conscience could
never have been healed; I am told the Laws are very severe, not ^ot only
against those that raise Arms against the Crown, and after violence ^o the
person of the King, but extend even to the intentions, words and thoughts;
certain I am Religion and Nature, rank treason and rebellion among the
fowlest sins, and follows them with the worst of punishments, and doubts
Ravailla might as well have excused his bloody fact, by saying the King was in
his way, when he stabbed him; as those that justify these late actions, by
saying His Majesty was among their enemies, when he was on his own ground, and
amongst his own Servants: And who ever shall consider what His Majesty has
done before this watre began, in reparation of these errors past, what
calumnies and reproaches he has suffered since (injuries not to be born by
private spirits) how beyond hope and expectation His Army rise from being
despised to be justly feared; and lastly, what royal promises, sacred
protestations he has so often and so solemnly made, cannot but renounce Charity
and Honor, or else he must believe and trust His Majesty, ressent His
sufferings, and acknowledge the miraculous hand of God in His preservation.

But I must confess the reason of complaining against you for using the King
no better, seems to grow less, whilst the Subject is in a much worse
condition. Laws we have indeed, but they are so little exercised, that shortly
they will be buried in the places of those late risen Fundamentalls, which no
man yet could ere discover where they lay; when for the liberty of the Subject,
there is such good provision made that whereas one Jail was enough for a whole
County, now there is more then one almost in every Parish; when the
superscription of a letter (and may be that fained too) the information of a
malicious neighbor: a fear, a jealousy, deprives many of their liberty, some
of their lives, most of their healths and fortunes; when the petitioning for
Laws established, and for peace (without which we can enjoy neither Laws nor
Truth) are become (with the crime of Loyalty) the only things punished; and
with such a severity that as no condition so spares, no age is spared; the
youth entering into the world and having undergone the labor of a prentiship,
instead of being made free of the City, are to serve again in a prison; and
those reverend Aldermen who have gone through the several Offices of London
with honor, stooping under the weight of many years, and the infirmities
thereof, have been drawn from their hospitable houses, (and some from their
beds, where extreme age had kept them many years before) to loathsome prisons,
from thence at midnight in cold and stormy we^ther, in a little boat to
Gravesend, and from thence to the unwholesome air of some port Town, that they
might not live long, to bewail that banishment from their dear wives and
children.

And herein I acknowledge the greatest justice, for Propriety has no priveledge
above Liberty; for being lately at London I found Prisons and plundering went
hand in hand and it is worth the observing how these disbursments like hasty
weeds, grew on a sudden to so great a height; as first a gentle benevolence,
then subscription, then sending in plate, next taxations by an order, at last
the twentieth part by an Ordinance, besides those smaller diversions of under
writing for Ireland, and spending it in this war, of gathering for the
distressed Protestants of that Nation, and bestowing that charity upon the
Ministers of our own, whose seditious Sermons, had brought a just poverty upon
them; of sequestring estates and benefices, of taking Portions and keeping the
Orphans upon public Faith, of seazing the Stocks of Churches, till by the
same public Faith, they build or repair the same; and doubtless were not my
thoughts more for the general, then my private interest, I might easily and by
authority grow rich with the spoils of that propriety you seem to defend, and
as others, be gallant with the overplus taken for the twentieth part; who
likewise by an Order take the Coach Horses of persons of quality, and use them
afterward in their visits and to Tavernes for the service of the Commonwealth.

I had not made instance in so many particulars, but to justify my self
thereby to all the world for what I have now done, which upon these
considerations will be rather approved then condemned, by any that have not
wholy given up their reason unto faction; for doubtless dishonor is fixed
upon levity, ambition, cowardice, upon the persisting in that course which by
conscience is declared unjust and irreligious. The breach of Articles renders
void all Covenants, much more when that which is contracted for, is not only
altered but subverted. They were but pretenses not realities I have hitherto
served under, and Justice and Honor commands me to leave them. Some Soldiers
take Honor in so large a sense, that if they took pay under the Turk they
would not desert him: The comparison is not amiss; but sure where there is
such an indifferency, as to serve any for pay, Religion is no part of their
Honor; but if they be of the Mohammedan persuasion, I shall not blame them to
be true to that service, no more then I do those here, if their consciences
tell them decency and order is Antichristian, and Authority and Magistracy
Heathenish: for certain I am, there is nothing more base and unworthy a
Gentleman and a Christian then to forsake the dictates of his own reason and
conscience to persist in an erroneous way, because he has already entered into
it: If this false opinion of Honor should be received as Orthodox, it will be
in the power of every subtle Sophister and cheating Mountabanke, to engage men
for ever in ignoble actions, because they brought them since to an opinion that
conduced thereunto. And lastly, whereas the end of war is peace, what hope can
there be of a reconciliation, or that those that have got the Regal and
supreme power into their hands, should ever leave that which they have userped,
to resume that which they were borne to, or that the Officers of that Army
should consent to a peace as long as they can have supplies of money; since
that then a great part from being Colonels and Captains, must again betake
themselves to their aprons and shops, and instead of receiving pay, must
bethink themselves how to satisfy their beguiled Creditors: for my part, I am
borne to no inconsiderable fortune, and as I abhor my name should be branded
with treason, or that forfeited by a confiscation, so am I as loath we should
ever be reduced to have a parity in either (which is aimed at) or have both
buried in the ruins of this miserable Nation.

I do protest had none of these promises wrought upon me, yet the very sight
of His Najesties Army, the discipline, unanimity, and exact obedience, thereof,
the excellent conversation of so many gallant, and noble personages who know no
other emulation then that of honor, who dare do any thing but what is base,
and (on my soul) daily express hearty desires of peace (not out of any defect
in the Army) but to prevent the ruin and procure the happiness of their
Country: to conclude, what English Gentlemen that ever heard of the ancient
honor of this Kingdom, or would preserve that of himself and family, can
tamely see our courage (terrible sometime to foreign Nations) basely
degenerate into a rebellion against our natural Prince, to whom malice it
self can object no crime, and therefore casts upon him the faults of others,
and since it cannot touch His Person, quarrels at His Crown: you see Him
powerful at the head of His Army, and may see him glorious in his throne of
peace, you ought not to doubt his justice, (and if you wlir) you may (as I have
done) obtain his mercy.

Sir, I have freely told you my sense, if it have any proportion to yours, and
so incline you to that effect it has wrought in me, I shall take it (next to
the condition I am in) as the greatest happiness, and if I be so fortunate,
since in these dangerous times you cannot safely convey it by letters, let me
know it, by your publishing this, whereby also you may happily benefit others,
and certainly oblige.

Your humble servant, R. K.
