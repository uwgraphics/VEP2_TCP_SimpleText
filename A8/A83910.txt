such, as will endure no delay; but unless You shall be graciously pleased to
assure to them by these Messengers, That You will speedily apply Your Royal
Assent to the satisfaction of their former desires, they shall be enforced for

the Authority of both Houses, in such manner as has been propounded to Your
Majesty; and they resolve to do it accordingly.
