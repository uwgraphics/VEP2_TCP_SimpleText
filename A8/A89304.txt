A PRISONERS LETTER To the Kings most excellent Majesty, and the High Court of
Parliament.

LONDON: Printed Anno Domini 1641.

To the Kings most excellent Majesty. AND To the High Court of Parliament, and
in them to the whole Kingdom of England.
Dread Sovereigne,
I Make a tender to your Royal Majesty (and in you, to the high Court of
Parliament, and to your whole Kingdom) of an illustrious example of the divine
providence, no less wonderful for admiration, then the discovery of Gods
judgments, made by the Prophet Daniel to King Nebuchodonozor, and Baltassar his
son; nor less behoofull for the good and welfare of your self, our gracious
Queen, your Royal offspring, and our whole Kingdom (if you will vouchsafe to
apprehend, and make use of it) then the discovery of the treacheries of
Bagathan and Thares, and of the pernicious devices of wicked Aman, made by
Mardocheus to King Ahassuerus, was for him and his people.

My course has been directed to your Royal Majesty, by Gods sacred, and
special appointment, ever since your first coming to your Crown, and before;
though I never addressed any writing unto you in special about this matter,
till now; because I was first to deal with Roman Catholics, and afterward
with some of your Justices, Judges, and other Officers; and finally to expect
in patience some events of the divine providence, succeeding thereupon, that
ascending to your Royal Tribunal by degrees, I might have more ample and
special matter every way to present, and not appear empty handed before you.

Now Gods judgments are grown to a great ripeness; or (to speak with
allusion to our Blessed Saviors expression in a like case) the Fig tree has
budded whereby men may know Summer is nigh. Wherefore, if your Royal Majesty,
and the high Court of Parliament, will be pleased to make a due inquiry and
examination of my course, whereby the matter of fact may be authentically made
known; and then cast a serious eye upon the public events of the divine
providence, which (succeeding in due conformity, and consequence these many
years, and parallel to the approved testimonies of Gods special judgments in
ancient times) are, as it were, the great broad Seal of Heaven, giving weight,
and authority to my words, and endeavors; besides that your Majesty may with
ease see, that there is a supernatural order of things, taught by
supernatural faith (which one not many years since in a public printed
book dedicated to your highness, has endeavored to evacuate) you may
moreover with like facility perceive, how the sacred decrees of Gods heavenly
providence, are drawn up, not only concerning the rest of the Christian world,
but also especially concerning you, and your Kingdom, and by conforming your
self to his holy will, decline the common mischiefs approaching, which
otherwise by no humane means can possibly be avoided.

Let not my meanness (who am but an unworthy instrument, and the least of your
Majesty's subjects) move your Highness, or the grave Assembly of Parliament, to
despise the offer which I make, but first enquire, and examine diligently (as
both Gods law, and man's reason do eq^ire) and then judge. There are some
dangers, which can neither be known, nor avoided, unless they be first
graciously discovered by some special favor, and oper^tion of the first cause
which is God himself, from whom nothing can be hid, and in such cases, though
his divine Majesty does many times employ men of great wisdom, and sanctity
(as he did the prophet Elizeus to discover to the king of Israel the
ambushments set to entrap him by the King of Syria) yet he dorh sometimes also,
not only use the most contemptible of men, as instruments to make the greatest
Potentats acquainted with his ways, and so enable them to avoid prepared
mischiefs, but moreover takes a brute beast for the like purpose, as in the
case of Balaam and his Ass.

Your Majesty's great Predecessor William the Conqueror thought it wisdom, in
a certain occasion, to hearken to the advertisement even of a natural fool,
as we read in our Chronicles: and long before his time, Alexander the Great
gave ear to a woman, who was thought distracted, as Curtius the Historian does
testify; by which happy credulity (God, who is all able to make fools and
mad men speak his wisdom, having discovered his divine knowledge and judgment
by means of those silly ones) those two great Princes avoided imminent danger
of death, and conserved their lives, and fortunes, for their great succeeding
victories. On the other side, the neglect of timely advertisements, has
brought many great Princes, and amongst the rest, that great Monarch Iu^ius
Caesar, to the loss of their Crowns and lives. He that will not hearken to God
in his gracious signs and forewarnings, must feel his heavy hand, when it
will be to late to avoid it.

For me I do not profess my self among the number of wise men, and if your
Majesty, or the great assembly of State now on foot, please, you may take me
for a fool, or a mad man (provided you acknowledge, that God almighty can by
his holy over ruling spirit, make a madness prodigious, and so use the folly
or madness of his creature, as an instrument to express an act of his divine
wisdom, providence, and power:) but what ever I be, foolish, or wise, or
however your royal Majesty, or the high Court of Parliament shall be pleased to
think of me, God is wise even in the fool and mad man, and his holy will is
to be searched out in all: which if it had been duly done more then thirteen
years ago (adhering close to the testimony of Divine and humane law, employed
in the reality of my whole course, with a due inspection of the counter-signes
extant even then in the seeds of those heavy events, which have appeared since
most plainly to the view of all in their own proper and perfect existence) when
before some of your Majesty's tribunals, I did publicly in GODS name, and in
virtue of his public laws, special right, and command, with due relation
likewise to the Laws of our Realm, and two of your royal Majesty's
Proclamations, invite your royal Highness, and your whole Kingdom, to a due
inquiry of Gods prepared judgments, and of the devices then in hatching to
entrap you, and your People; not only your Judges, and other persons of higher
rank, and note, who lie now exposed to the rod of Justice, might have been
freed from undergoing the danger now threatening them; but your Majesty also
might with ease and security have prevented those troubles, and mischiefs,
which turmoile at this present all your Realms, and threaten a desolation. So
much it behooves Princes and States to attend, and examine well, if God almighty
do but make even Balaams Ass bray forth some imminent judgments in his holy
name. For mischiefs arising from the power of man may by the power of man with
Gods ordinary concourse be extinguished or averted: but such as are threatened
by God Almighties special hand, and power, can by no means possible be
avoided, but by admission, and performance of such conditions, as his divine
Majesty is pleased to propose.

I have strove to keep silence now these many years, being loath to meddle any
more in a cause, which has cost me so much trouble, and affliction (though I
know not why I should be so handled by any for suffering God Almighty to
express in me, whether men will have it to have been by the intermediation
of wit or madness, a testimony of his divine providence toward his Church,
and people) but I da^e be silent no longer, being furnished now with such
illustrious evidence of fore-passed events proper to my cause, to confirm my
words, and the thing it self concerning so deeply your Royal Majesty, Our
gracious Queen, your Royal Offspring, and our whole Kingdom: lest God
Almighty should inflict upon me the judgment threatened against the Watchman
in the thirty third Chapter of the Prophet Ez^chiel; yet I will forbear to
trouble your Royal Majesty, with the specification of particulars, till I see
whether I be thought fit to be admitted to a free, and indifferent hearing, or
no. One thing I must crave pardon of your Royal Majesty, and the great
Assembly of Parliament; that I address my self thus to you in print, before I
have acquainted you with my case in a more private way. The reason I have done
so is: that seeing every man now prints, what he lists; and my cause has
been many years since public, and I suffered so much in mayntenance of it
under the view of many; I may either by the testimony of some at leastwise of
those many, be introduced to a free, and public audience: or else upon
compassion be voted, as a fool or madman, to be set free from prison, and
further trouble (seeing I never appeared in so many years extremities, either
furious, seditious, or turbulent) and so be committed to the care of my
friends, that I may end my old age in peace, and quietness; commending you,
and your Kingdom, to Gods merciful providence, care, and protection.

I humbly beseech God Almighty, to bless, and protect your Royal Majesty,
our gracious Queen, your Royal Offspring, and our whole Kingdom, and grant
that you may know his holy will, and faithfully perform the same to the glory
of the divine Majesty, and the common comfort, and good of all.

In the common Wards of the Fleet, the ninth of October, 1641. Your Royal
Majesty's loyal and lowly Subject, Edward Morgan.
