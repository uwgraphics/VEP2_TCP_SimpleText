COPY OF THE ADDRES: Of a Great Number of the Members of the Parliament of
SCOTLAND, Presented to the KING by my Lord ROSS, and the other Commissioners
with him at Kensingtoun, 11th of June, 1700.
May it please Your MAJESTY,
WE Your Majesty's most Loyal and Dutiful Subjects, the Subscribing Noblemen,
Lords, Barrons, and Burgesses, of this Your Ancient Kingdom of SCOTLAND;
Members of the same Parliament which happily settled Your Majesty's Government
over Us, And has ever since given Continued Proofs of Zeal and Affection, to
Your Majesty's Service in the several Sessions thereof; Do humbly Represent to
Your Majesty, that having according to Your Majesty's Royal Appointment, met
together in Parliament, with full Resolution to have Proceeded in the like Good
Intensions, for the Honor and Interest of Your Majesty, and People.

It is to Our Unspeakable Grief and Disappointment, that not only there has
been no Return given to the Unanimous Address of the last Session of
Parliament, Expressing the whole Nations Concern in the INDIAN and AFRICAN
Company; But also, after a Motion made in this Session of Parliament, for a
Resolve, That Our Colony of CALEDONIA in DARIEN, is a Legal and Rightful
Settlement in the Terms of the Act of Parliament 1695, And that the Parliament
would mantain and support the same. The Members beginning to Reason thereupon,
were Interrupted by an Adjournment, which We Humbly Conceive is not Agreeable
to the 40 Act of the 11th. Parliament of King JA, the 6 Where it is Promitted,
That nothing shall be done or Commanded, which might directly or Indirectly
Prejudge the Liberty of free Voting, And Reasoning of the Estates of
Parliament, or any of them in all time coming.

And there after by a Subsequent Adjournment, from the Thirtieth Day of May
instant, to the Twentieth Day of June nixt, the Parliament was not Permited to
come to any Resolution, in the pressing Concerns of the Nation; which we cannot
think consistent with that Article of Our Claim of Right: Whereby it is
Declared, That for the Redress of all Grievances, and for the amending,
Strengthing, and preserving of the Laws; Parliaments ought to be Frequently
called and allowed to Sit, and the Freedom of Speech and debate secured to the
Members

We do therefore in all Humility and Earnestness, entreat that Your Majesty
will be Graciously Pleased, to allow Your Parliament to Meet at the Day to
which it is now Adjourned; And to sit as long as may be Necessary for
Redressing the Grievances of the Nation, Asserting it is just Rights and
Privileges, as well at Home as Abroad, in its Colony of CALEDONIA, and for
Enacting such Laws as may be for the Advancement and Security of Religion; the
Honor of Your Majesty, and the true interest of this Nation. We are,

May it Please Your Majesty, Your Majesty's most Dutiful, most Loyal, and most
Obedient Subjects and Servants.
