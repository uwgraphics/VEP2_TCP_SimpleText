A Copy of the Petition presented to the Kings Majesty by the high Sheriff,
accompanied with many hundreds of Gentlemen and Freeholders of the County of
Rutland, as his Majesty passed through their County toward York: To which his
Majesty was pleased graciously to promise an Answer.
To the Kings most Excellent Majesty.
The Humble Petition of your Majesty's Loyal Subjects in the County of
Rutland.
Shows,
THAT as with all humble thankfulness they do acknowledge the many former and
late effluences of your Royal grace and goodness, whereby they were lifted up
with an expectation of happy days, wherein your sacred Majesty should have a
perpetual Throne of safety and honor, erected in the hearts of your loyal
people; higher then any your Royal Predecessors: So we cannot now but express
the greatness of our griefs, fearing all those hopes to be dashed, and the
joy of the whole land darkened by your Majesty's withdrawing your Sacred person
in these times of imminent danger from your great Council of Parliament, to
the raising of unexpressible fears in the hearts of all your loyal Subjects.

Wherefore in all humility your Petitioners do implore your sacred Majesty,
that out of the depth of your Princely wisdom and goodness, the beams of
your grace and favor may again break forth upon your Kingdom, in returning
and vouchsafing your Majesty's presence to the Parliament; whereby the fears
of your people may be dispelled, and a foundation laid of everlasting comfort
to this land, in the safety of your sacred person, and abundant increase of
honors and greatness upon your Royal Government.

To the Right Honorable, the House of Peers now assembled in Parliament.
The Humble Petition of the high Sheriff, Knights, Esquires, Gentlemen,
Ministers, and others of good Rank within the County of RVTLAND,
Shows.
THAT your Lordships concurrence with the House of Commons in passing the Bill
to take away the Votes of the Prelates: settling the Militia and Forts in such
hands as the Honorable House of Parliament may confide in; approving and
passing those noble propositions for the suppressing of those barbarous Rebels
in Ireland, and in many other Acts of great concernment is acknowledged by your
Petitioners, with all possible joy and humble thankfulness; yet we cannot but
(but with great grief accompained with fears) be sensible, That authority is
not yet given for putting the Kingdom into a posture of defense, That the
Votes of Popish Lords, and their proxies are still continued, humbly conceiving
it to be against reason, that Papists should Vote in points of that Religion
whereunto they are professed adversaries, or in matters of State, to which they
can be no fast friends, especially now, that so great a party of Papists are in
open Rebellion: That the Mass is still frequented: That Papists are so
superficially disarmed, to the great animating of them in their pernicious
practices: That superstitious innovating Ministers are not punished, who to
escape just censure, foment factions against the Parliament: That so speedy
relief of the poor distressed Protestants in Ireland (as their necessities
require) is not yet effectually acted, to the imboldning of the Papists and
malignant parties of this Kingdom to the like attempts: Wherefore your
Petitioners do humbly pray a speedy removal of these our grievances, with
their causes: And that your Lordships will be pleased still to join with the
House of Commons in all their pious and just proceedings.

And your Petitioners shall be bound in duty to pray for your Honors, and will
be ready according to their late solemn and general Protestation to assist
your Lordships in all just and honorable ways to the utmost of our powers.

To the Honorable, the Knights, Citizens and Burgesses of the House of Commons
now assembled in Parliament, The humble Petition and desires of the high
Sheriff, Knights, Esquires, Gentlemen, Ministers, and others of good Rank
within the County of Rutland,
Shows,
THat as we can never sufficiently bless Almighty God for his mercies and
protections toward you, nor express our thankfulness unto you for the great
works that have been done for the good both of Church and Commonwealth,
which will for ever rest upon Record through all posterities, to your
everlasting glory. So our humble desires are, that you will still be pleased in
the fear of God with courage to go on to the full accomplishment of all your
godly and honorable intentions: The present and expeditious putting the whole
Kingdom into a sufficient posture of defense both by Sea and Land: The fervent
and constant endeavoring to remove all Popish Lords out of the House of Peers,
or at the least to suspend their Votes: The securing the greatest and most
active Papists: The effectual executing of all Laws against Popish Priests
and Jesuits: The speedy and powerful relief of our persecuted brethren in
Ireland: The utter quelling the pride, insolency and tyranny of the Prelates:
The abolishing of all unfitting and unnecessary dignities out of the Church, by
whose superfluous estates and revenues, the deficient means of many Churches
in this Kingdom may become reasonably supplied: The regulating the
Universities concerning their looseness in government, whereby youth being
there first corrupted in conversation and Doctrine, become afterward
infectious, and of evil example to the Country: The injunction of stricter
sanctification of the Lords day, and restraint of all profanation thereof by
Wakes, traveling far or nigh, and other actions not warranted by Gods word;
And that the hearing and censuring may be speeded (in such time as to your
wisdoms shall appear convenient) of all those who have been in eminent
degree delinquents, especially in the Ministry, against whom there are
Complaints or Articles in this Honorable House depending: By the delay of
whose trialls, the malignant party is (as we humbly conceive) much encouraged,
the Orders of this Honorable House disobeyed, and publicly slighted, thereby
contemning the undubitable and ancient Authority of Parliaments.

And your Petitioners shall daily pray for you, and are ready according to
their late solemn and general Protestation, in all just and honorable ways
to assist you in your lawful endeavors, to the utmost hazard of our estates
and lives.

The two later Petitions were presented to both Houses on Tuesday the 29. of
March by Sir James Harrington, Knight, accompanied with diverse Gentlemen of
good worth; who after they were read, the Houses commanded the Lord Keeper, in
the name of the House of Peers, and Mr. Speaker, in the name of the House of
Commons, to render thanks unto the Presenters, and to intimate their kind
acceptance of the said Petitions, desiring them to return great thanks from
both Houses to their County, for their care of the preservation of the
Kingdom. And further, the House of Commons commanded Mr. Speaker then to
declare, that they had likewise taken notice of their Countries cordial
affections to the Kings Majesty, and the service of the Kingdom, by their
opportune delivery of a Petition to his Majesty in his journey toward York,
for his speedy return to his Parliament, for which they likewise commanded
thanks to be given to the high Sheriff and the County.
