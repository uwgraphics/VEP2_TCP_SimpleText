Christian Reader:
Having fore-written about the extent of the death, and sacrifice of Christ;
That it might be more usefully understood, I have here presented to thy view,
this following Tract, desiring, that is good, may be received; And, what
swarveth from Truth, that I may be lovingly informed thereof, which I spall
heartily accept at the hands of any; or, if evident truth be faulted, shall
with meekness give answer if I may be permitted; And that God may graciously
discover to us, and lead us into all truth; Is the desire of the least of his
mercies, and servants.

A DISCOVRSE ABOUT THE PRETIOVS BLOOD AND SACRIFICE OF JESUS CHRIST.
CHAP. I. The Preface.
COnsidering how our Savior, when he was about to leave his Disciples, whom he
so dearly loved; left with them by his institution, His Supper, in which they
might spiritually enjoy his presence; And then said to them: Do this in
remembrance of me, Luke 22.19. And that the Apostle says, That in so doing we
show forth the Lords death till he come, 1 Cor. 11.25.26.

And likewise; That the Apostle affirms, that as many as are baptized into
Christ, were baptized into his death, Romans 6.3. so that to be taught, and
subdued to the acknowledgement, and brought into the faith of Christ, and unto
conformity with him; Is to be taught, and subdued to the acknowledgement, and
brought into the faith of the death of Christ, and conformed to him in
fellowship of his death, as that wherein the virtue of his Resurrection is met
with, Romans 6.4.8. Gal. 2.20. Phil. 3.2.7.8.9. 2 Cor. 4.10.11.12. 2 Timothy 2.11.

And the Scripture affirms of all the Priesthood, Sacrifices, Atonement, and
Purifications under the Law; That they were but figures, types, and shadows of
that to be found in Christ; He being the body, Col. 2.17. And the truth of all
typed in the shadows found in him, Heb. 9.9.23. Chap. 10.1. And so that, there
was more virtue, Power, and Prevalency with God in Christ, his offering
himself, and presenting the virtue of his blood before his Father, than in all
the offerings of the other Priests, Heb. Chap. 10.14. And that there is more
Power, virtue, and prevalency, with, and in men for purgeing the conscience, in
the spiritual sprinkling of the virtue of the blood, and sacrifice of Christ
therein; than was in all those shadowing purifications, and sprinklings to
purify the flesh, Heb 9.12.13.14.

Yea those who in being taught of God, have experimented the truth hereof, call
the blood of Christ precious, 1 Pet. 1.19. And have professed in their
Preachings, not to determine to know any thing among their hearers, save Jesus
Christ, and him crucified, 1 Cor. 2.2. And not to glory, and rejoice, save in
the Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, Gal. 6.14. It gives me to conceive, that a
sober reader will be persuaded; that there is something in the blood, death, and
sacrifice of Christ, of infinite vallue, and worthy our hartiest, and deepest
consideration, most wiste view, best remembrance, and choice acceptance: and
so I am encouraged to present the same to consideration, and for more orderly
proceeding to consider.

1. What is comprehended in these terms, the sufferings, Blood, Death, and
Sacrifice of Christ? 2. The manifold ends of his suffering, Blood, Death, and
Sacrifice, as the Scripture distinctly sets them forth. 3. The necessity of the
sufferings, Blood, Death, and Sacrifice of Christ. 4. The Excellency, Dignity,
and worth of this blood, and sacrifice. 5. The virtue, operation, and
prevalency thereof, presented, and applied. 6. The usefulness of the same,
known, and believingly remembered.
CHAP. II.
What is comprehended in these terms? The Sufferings, Blood, Death, and
Sacrifice of Christ.

IN these together, and every of these terms, in Scripture is meant;

Sometime fully, and almost only, and always inclusively. The very suffering
of Christ it self; The shedding of his blood, and his death, Esa. 53.4.5.
Surely he has borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows, -- He was wounded
for our transgressions, the chastisement of our peace was upon him, Romans 4.25.
He was delivered for our offenses, 1 Cor. 15.3. Christ dyed for our sins
according to the Scripture, Gal. 3.13. Being made a curse for us, 1 Pet. 3.18.
Christ has once suffered for our sins, the just for the unjust, 2 Cor.
5.14.15. He dyed for All, Heb. 2.9. By the grace of God he tasted death for
every man.

2. Sometimes together with this former sense of the sufferings, the Bloodshed,
and Death of Christ it self; is meant, Also in the same terms of suffering,
Blood, and Death of Christ, the virtue, and efficacy of this suffering,
Bloodshed, and death of Christ as he is risen from the Dead, free, and just
from all our sins imputed to him, and a victor over all our curse, and death
imposed on him; As namely: 1. The fulfilling the truth of God in the death of
the sinner; for so we judge, if one dyed for all; then are all dead, and he
dyed for all, that they which live, should live to him, etc. 2 Cor. 5.14.15.
Genesis 2.17. 2. The satisfying Divine Justice, in that all have suffered the
curse in one public man being made a curse, and having overcome it for them,
Gal. 3.10-13. with Esa. 53.5. and 2 Cor. 5.19.21. 3. The satisfying, and
fulfilling the Law, accomplishing a righteousness for us, that Way may be made
for the righteousness of the law to be fulfilled in us, Gal. 1.4. Romans 8.3.4.
4. The overcoming death, and him that had the power of death, And so taking
out of the way, that which was in the way between God, and us; contrary to us,
2 Timothy 1.10. Heb. 2.14. Col. 2.14.


So as in him, mercy and truth are met, righteousness and peace have kissed,
Psalm. 85.10. such the virtue of the sufferings, blood, and death of Jesus
Christ, being risen from the dead.

And thus he is said to be risen for our Justification, Romans 4.25. And so is he
justified in the room of all mankind, that they are all in him as in the
public person, justified, Romans 3.23.24. All have sinned, and come short of the
glory of God; Being justified freely by his grace, through the redemption that
is in Christ Jesus, Romans 5.18. As by the offense of one unto all men, to
Codemnation, even so by the righteousness of one to all men to justification
of life; And he by himself, purged, (or made purgation for) our sins, and
then sat down, etc. Heb. 1.3. And so has taken away our sins by the
sacrifice of himself, Heb. 9.26. John 1.29. 1 John 3.5. And through death
destroyed him that had the power of death, Heb. 2.14. And all this, the virtue
and efficacy of the death, and resurrection of him that is risen from the dead,
1 Cor. 15. tot

3. Sometimes; together with both the former senses; by the suffering, blood,
death, and sacrifice of Christ, is meant, His offering, and presenting himself
in heaven before his Father, by and with the virtue of this his suffering,
blood, and death, as the price, the Ransom, the propitiatory-sacrifice for
atonement and purchase to God for men: So Heb 8.3. It is of necessity that he
have somewhat also to offer, Heb. 9 26. now once in the end of the world has he
appeared to take away sin by the sacrifice of himself, verse. 12. By his own
blood he entered in once into the holy place, verse 14. who through the eternal
Spirit offered himself without spot to God: see Heb. 10.1. -- 12. Tit. 2.14.
Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us, 1 Timothy 2.6. who gave
himself a ransom for all.

4. Sometime, together with all these former senses; by the suffering, Blood,
Death, and Sacrifice of Christ, is meant; The prevalency, and effectuallnesse
thereof, as presented to God with God for mankind, so as he has made peace,
slain enmity, obtained eternal Redemption, and received fullness of spirit to
make it known, and dispense it, Ephesians. 2.15. Having abolished in his flesh the
enmity, so making peace; verse 16. Having slain the enmity, Heb. 9.12. having
obtained eternal redemption, and Psalm. 68.18. Received gifts in the man, ( and
for men, Ephesians. 4.8.) even the rebellious also, that the Lord God might dwell
amongst them.

And this prevalency, and effectualnesse of his precious Blood, and Sacrifice
offered to his Father for men; appears in many things; especially.

1. In that the Father has accepted of him, and his Sacrifice, for the ends,
for which he offered the same to him, and has received, and exalted him with,
and at his right hand, Mat. 17.5. My beloved Son in whom I am well pleased,
John 16.8.10. The Spirit shall convince the world of righteousness, because I
go to my Father, and ye see me no more; That is, He is received, and his
Sacrifice accepted, and so sent forth no more to suffer, and offer Sacrifice
for sins, as he should have been, if he had not satisfied for all (Heb.
9.7.8.) And wrought a perfect righteousness, and so it is said, Heb. 1.3.
After he had by himself purged; (or made purgation of) our sins, he sat down
on the right hand of the Majesty on high Heb. 10.12. After he had offered one
sacrifice for sins for ever, he sat down on the right hand of God; yea the
Lord in Testimony of his well-pleasednesse with him, has said to him, Psalm.
110.1. Sit thou on my right hand till I, etc. Heb. 1.13.

2. In that the Father has released, and given over all to his Son, and
given all power, and authority into his hands, and made him Lord of all, so as
he shall judge all men; And he has filled him with Immeasurable fullness of
the Holy Ghost in the humane nature; to dispense to men, to make known his
grace, and that he may according to the Gospel absolve all that believe, and
condemn all that will not believe, Psalm. 2.8. I shall give thee, the Heathen
for thine Inheritance, and the utmost parts of the earth for thy possession,
Mat. 11.27. All things are delivered to me of my Father, John 16.15. All things
that the Father has are mine, Mat. 28.18. All power is given to me in Heaven,
and in Earth, 1 Pet. 3.22. Angels, Authorities, and powers being made subject
to him, Act. 2.36. God has made Jesus both Lord and Christ, Act. 10.36. He
(...) Lord of all, and this by virtue of his death, resurrection, and
ascension, Romans 14.8.9. And he is the Judge, John. 5.27. Act. 17.31. And is
filled with spirit to send forth in the means, Act. 2.32.33. Ephesians. 4.7.-12.
That so he may absolve and judge according to the Gospel, Romans 2.16. John 12.48.

3. In that the Holy Ghost in the Scripture avoucheth such full sufficiency,
compleatnesse and virtue in this precious Blood, Ransom, and sacrifice, as it
is by Christ, in presenting, and offering himself, presented, and offered to
the Father, and by him accepted, and received, that Jesus Christ is hereby
become, appointed, and accepted of God, even Gods salvation to the ends of the
earth, Esa. 49. Ioh. 4.42.
Act. 13.47. The Savior of the world, 1 John 4.14. The Mediator between God
and men, 1 Timothy 2.5. The great High Priest, Prophet, and Advocate for his
Church, Heb. 3.1.-6. and 7. 1 John 2.2.

4. In the appearing and forthcoming of love, and grace through the
effectualnesse, and fruitfulness of his precious Blood, Ransom, and
Sacrifice, as it has been, and is presented to God; from whom it procures
such Kindness, and grace to be extended to manward, that hereby, even by
Christ, and for his sake, and through the virtue of his Sacrifice;

1 The earth with the Inhabitants are upheld for men, and men's lives reprived,
and space afforded, even to Rebels, that they might repent, Psalm. 75.3. The
Earth and all the Inhabitants thereof are dissolved, I bear up the pillars of
is. Heb. 1.3. upholding all things by the Word of his Power, when he had by
himself purged our sins, etc. Col. 1.17. By him all things consist. Joh. 1.4.
In him was life, and the life was the light of men, Rev. 2.21. I gave her space
to repent, 2 Pet. 3.9. He is long-suffering to usward, not willing that any
should perish, but that All should come to repentance.

2. Patience, and forbearance is extended to men that are yet found sinning:
and bounty, and many mercies vouchsafed, which carry forth in them the
testimony of his goodness, and that to this end, To lead men to repentance,
Act. 14.16, 17. He in times past suffered All Nations to walk in their own
ways: Nevertheless, he left not himself without witness, in that he did
good, and gave us rain from Heaven, and fruitful Seasons, filling our hearts
with food, and gladness, Romans 2.4. The goodness of God leads thee to
repentance: And this riches of the goodness of God, and forbearance,
long-suffering, and fruits of mercy, being extended through the sacrifice
offered, and redemption obtained by Christ, and carrying in it the testimony of
his goodness, and leading to repentance, and that to this end, that men might
seek after the Lord, Act. 17, 26. It is grace, and free grace, and universally
extended, and that to a gracious end: And as the giving of Christ to be the
Savior of the world, 1 John 4.14. was a fruit of Gods rich mercy, pity, and
love to mankind, John 3.16, 17. So this is a fruit of the prevalency of the
sacrifice of Christ with God, And his kindness to manward for Christ his sake,
Tin. 3.4 And so far as it is to all men, it is general, and universal sure;
Matthew. 5.44, 45. Psalm. 17.14.

3 The giving of his Word, and oracles, with his ordinances to many men;
wherein the Savior with his peace, righteousness, and salvation is set forth,
That men might through him believe, and in believing have life. Joh. 1.4, 5, 7.
And so it is he that has made peace, That comes in the Word preaching peace,
Ephesians. 2.17. This was peculiar to Israel from Abraham's time, till Christ his
Ascension, Psalm. 147.19, 20. And since extended to the Gentiles, Ephesians. 3.5, 6.

4 The affording some light, and motion of his Spirit, in, and according to the
means vouch safed, whether in the Book of Creatures only, or the Book of
Scriptures also: For calling All men, Prove. 8.4 5. Isa 45.22. And willing them,
and striving with them at one time or other, 1 Pet. 2.12. Genesis 6.3. And so
Christ is the true Light, that lights every man that comes into the world,
John 1.9. And so in the works of Creation, It is said, Romans 1.19. That which
may be known of God is manifest in them, for God has showed it to them; And of
the preaching of the Gospel it is said, 2 Cor. 2.14. God makes manifest the
savor of his knowledge, etc. And such as resist the light, and motion in
either of these means, resist the holy Spirit, Prove. 1.23, 24. Act. 7.51.

The liberty of giving life to all that believe on him, 17. John 2. And all
these come through the efficacy and prevalencie of the Blood, and Sacrifice of
Christ presented unto God, and accepted of him; In which respect, The Gospel,
where it comes, sets him forth, as indeed he is; The propitiation for our sins,
and the Sins of the whole world, Romans 3.25 1 John 2.2. The upholder of the
world made by him, Heb. 1 2, 3. The laver of regeneration, or new birth, John
3.5.15. Tit. 3.4, 5. I he Fountain of leansing, and purificatioons for
defilements, 1 Job 1.7 Zach. 13.1. The Fountain of life, Psalm. 36.9. He in whom
God has given us eternal life, so as he that has him, has life, 1 John
5.10, 10, 11, 12. and as page 5. under this figure 3.

5 Sometimes together with all these four former senses, by the Sufferings,
Blood, Death, and Sacrifice of Christ so presented to, and prevailing with God,
is also farther meant the spiritual Discovery and Application of it to, and
prevailing efficacy in the hearts and consciences of such, as through the
appearance of grace are brought to believe, Heb. 12.24 To the blood of
sprinkling, 1 Pet. 1.2. Unto obedience, and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus
Christ, verse. 19. The precious blood of Christ, which indeed prevails with,
and and in those who in spiritual Discoveries are sprinkled, and washed
therewith, in, and with whom it is so powerful, and effectual, That it verily
pierces and melts the heart for all its sinfulness, and follies against
him, and all its hard thoughts, and oppositions wherewith it has pierced him,
Zach. 12.10, Acts 2.37. Reconcileth the heart, and powers in their inclination
to God, 2 Cor. 5.18, 20. Gives an escape from the intangling pollutions that
are in the world, and holding from God through lusts, 2 Peter 1.4. and 2.20,
Rev. 5.9. Speaks peace to the Conscience, so as the Believer receives
justification, and peace with God thereby, Heb. 12.24. Romans 4 25. and 5.1.2.
Purges the Conscience, Heb. 9.13.14. from the accusations of sin, and
charges of the Law, putting in fear, Romans 7.4.6. and 8.2.3, 34. from its
former corrupt way of dictating to seek peace, and righteousness with God, by
frames, and performances of its own according to Law. "And also from speaking
peace from such seize, Gal. 2.21. Phil. 3 3 7, 8, 9. Job. 9.15.32.

Purifieth the heart to a child-like love of God, and Christ, and his
Government, Heb. 9.14. Gal. 2.20, 21. And so renews it with spring: of ove ce
brethren, 1 Pet. 1.19, 21, 22. And omen, 2 Cor. 5.14. And inclinations to serve
the living God Tit 3 4.5. Conforming to Christ, 2 Cor. 3.3, 18.

Washes, and cleanses from such pollutions, as befall Believers, 1 John 2.7.

Seals to the Day of redemption, Exodus 12.13, with Ephesians. 1.13. and 4 30.

And gives boldness and courage in access to God, Rom: 5.2. Ephesians. 2.16 18
Heb. 4 16.

All which are the efficacies of the precious blood of Christ, spiritually
applied to, and sprinkled on the heart; And meant when the Blood is spoken of,
as Believers are said to be sprinkled (redeemed from the world, or vain
conversation) and washed with it, Heb. 12.24. 1 Pec. 1.19. Acts 20.28. Rev.
5.9. and 1.5.

6 Sometimes, by these terms, the Sufferings, Blood, Death, and Sacrifice of
Christ, is signified, encluded, and meant; The immense, rich, and free mercy,
love, or grace of God, in finding out a ransom, and giving his Son, That he
might show forth love, Job. 33.24. John 3.15, 16, 17. Ephesians. 2 4 5, 6, 7. And
so this love made known in the gift of his Son, and testified in the
application of the virtue of his blood, Rev. 1.5. and 5, 9. In forgiveness of
sins, Ephesians. 1.6.7. And there-through shedding abroad his love in the heart
by the holy Ghost, begetting love and confidence Rom: 5 5, 10. Uniting to,
comforting in, and conforming to Christ, writing his mind in the heart 1 Pet.
8.21, 22. 2 Cor. 3.3.18. And herein is love, That he loved us, and sent his Son
to be the propitiation for our sins, 1 John 4.10. and 3 16 And herein is love
communicated, That he has washed us from our sins in his blood, Rev. 1.5.

And so when we speak, or in the Scripture read, of the Sufferings, Blood,
Death, and Sacrifice of Christ, and the love of God to manward, and the hope,
and benefit set forth to all men thereby; we are to understand it as of the
blood of Christ: 1 That shed it, and dyed for our sins, 2 That overcame Death,
and rose for our Justification. 3 That by, and with the virtue of this blood,
did through the eternal Spirit effer up himself without spot to God, and has
thereby obtained eternal redemption; And 4 that thereby procures favor, and
means for the Sons of men, That they might believe, and in believing be saved:
And when the Scripture speaks of so much, and no more in any Proposition for
Faith, it speaks of it, as for the world, John 1.29. Mer, 1 Timothy: 2.6.
Sinners, 1 Timothy 1.15. And such like general terms it uses, 2 Cor. 5.19. But
when we speak, or in the Scripture read of the Sufferings, Blood, Death, and
sacrifice of Christ, as the virtue and efficacy thereof is found in any, And
the peculiar love, and choice privileges thereof affirmed of; Then we are to
understand it farther. 5 Of the virtue of that precious Blood applied to, and
working in the heart; And 6 of the rich and free love of God testified to, and
shed abroad in the heart thereby; And then, and so we are to understand it, not
only in the four former senses, but both in them, and these two latter also;
And so it is never spoke of in general for all men, but for the Church, Act,
20.28. Ephesians. 5.25.26, 27, Believers, 1 John 1.7. His called, and chosen ones,
Heb. 9.14 Revel. 1.5. and 5.9.

And so the same virtue, and grace of Christ by Spirit given and made
effectual.

1 In respect of Christ his dying for our sins, and in respect of his entering
into Heaven by his own blood, And in respect of his Application of it to the
conscience And in respect of the first effects of it speaking Peace, and
answering Lawcharges; it is expressed by Blood, or Death, Romans 8 34.

2 And in respect of the free, and rich love of God appearing there-through,
and entering the heart; with its cleansing, refreshing, and renewing operations;
It is expressed by water, clean water, living water, or water of life, Isa:
43.3. Ephesians. 3.23. Heb. 10.23. John 4 10. and 7.38.

And so the same washing is affirmed, as a fruit of his love, by his Blood,
Rev. 1.5. with clean water, Ezekiel. 36.25. and Christ is called, The Fountain of
living Waters, Jer. 17.13.

And as these terms of Blood and Water, are used to set forth the same grace
distinctly, in diverse and distinct respects; so one of these terms, sometimes
comprehends both; As Blood, in Rev. 1.5. and Waters, in John 3.5. Tit. 3.4, 5.

And so as Jesus Christ in respect of his sacrifice with the efficacy of it, as
offered to God; And by the efficacy of it, as applied to men, was shadowed,
figured, and typed out by Water, and Blood, Heb. 9.8, 12, 13, 14, 19. Even so
his first coming, and finishing the work, his Father gave him to do on Earth: 1
Because of the great, rich, and free love of God, in which he sent his Son into
the World; John 3.16. To be the Savior of the world, 1 John 14.14. By which he
tasted death for every man, Heb. 2 9. And in love laid down his life for us; He
is said to have come by water. 2 Because of the satisfaction he made for us by
suffering, and dying for our sins, 1 Cor: 15.3.4. 2 Cor: 5.21. Gal: 3.13. He is
said, to have come by Blood. 3 Because, by the eternal Spirit he rose from the
dead, ascended, and offered himself without spot to God, and so was justified
in the Spirit, To: 6.4. 1 Pet: 3.18. To: 1.4. 1 Timothy: 13.16. And by that Spirit
testifies of himself, John 14.26. and 15.26, 27. It is said, The Spirit
bears witness, 1 John 5.6. This is he that came by water and blood; not by
water only, but by water and blood, and it is the Spirit that bears witness,
because the Spirit is Truth.


And so as there is one God, and three Persons in one God: The Father who has
loved us, and given his Son for us, 1 John 4.10.

The Son who was made flesh, and so dyed for our sins, and rose for our
justification, John 1.14 Rom: 5.25.

The Holy Ghost, who proceeds from, and makes known the Father and the Son,
Matthew. 16.16. Ioh. 14.26. and 16.13. So it is said, 1 John 5.7. There are three
that bear record in Heaven; the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost; And these
three are one, and so the Record is the record of one God. 1 John 5.10.

And answerably, there are three that bear record on Earth to men, and in the
hearts of Believers.

The Spirit that discovers in, and through the Gospel this grace, and
enlightens the heart to see, and believe, and so begets a spiritual
disposition, bringing out of darkness into his light, Matthew. 16.16. John
16.7-15. 1 Cor. 2.9. -- 15.

The Water, even that rich, free, and immense love of God in the Spirits
exaltation of Christ's appearing, Isa 55.1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

The Blood, even the propitiation made, satisfaction given, redemption
obtained, righteousness wrought, and presented to God, and accepted of him,
and now applied for satisfaction to the Believer, Rom: 3.25, 26. and 4.5.24.25.
and 5.1. -- 11. And all these agreeing in one; And so it is said, 1 John 5.8.
There are three that bear witness in Earth; The Spirit, and the Water, and the
Blood, and these three agree in one: All these witnesses agree in one, and bear
forth one record, and the Spirit is he that bears forth the witness, and he
does it with Water and Blood, in discovery and application of the free grace of
God, and the virtue of the precious blood of Christ, Tit. 3.4, 5. And so the
whole record is the record of God, 1 John 5.10, 11, 12. And this is the record
that God has given of his Son, Tha God has given us eternal life, and this
life is in his Son; He that has the Son has life, and he that has not the
Son, has not life: And so by this whole Discourse, we may understand: That

1 When the Scripture speaks of grace, or free-love; though for the
clearness, purity, refreshing, and cleansing effects, it expresses it by that
metaphor of water; yet it means of that grace, and love, in which Christ was
given to be a ransom, and which is testified through Christ; who by his blood
shedding, and with the virtue thereof presenting, and offering himself a
spotless sacrifice to his Father, has obtained eternal redemption, and
procured favor to be dispensed, and the way of dispensation, 1 John 4.10. Rom:
5.5, 6.

2 And when the Scripture speaks of the Blood, Death, and Sacrifice of Christ,
or the redemption effected thereby: It means the Blood of Christ, which through
love or grace was shed, and presented to God for us, and is discovered to us;
and so the redemption through grace wrought, and in, and through which, grace,
or free-love appears, Rom: 5.8.-11. Gal: 2.20.

3 And so when the Scripture speaks of the teaching, witnessing, and
operation of the holy Ghost; It means, that teaching, witnessing, and
operation of the Spirit of Christ, which by virtue of his Sacrifice, Christ
sends forth from the Father, and in which he discovers, and witnesses the
things of Christ; and so with water and blood discovering free grace, through
the virtue of that precious Blood, John 15.26. and 16.7. -- 15.

And these things are well to be heeded, and digested in our hearts, as they
are comprehended, and meant; always the most of them, and often all of them,
in using these terms and expressions: The Sufferings, Blood, Death, Ransom,
and Sacrifice of Christ Jesus.

CHHP. III.
The manifold ends of the Sufferings, Blood, Death, and Sacrifice of Christ, as
the Scripture distinctly sets them forth.

FOr the right understanding the distinct ends of the Death, and Sacrifice of
Christ, according to Scripture sense, and expression: There are some things the
Scripture mentions to be fore-understood, and heeded of us.

1 Of Jesus Christ, according to his double mission from the Father into the
world; and also, according to his double business in leaving the World, and
offering himself to the Father. 2 Of Mankind: In respect of the double misery,
and enmity against God, they are through the first Adem fallen into. 3 Of the
Church: In respect of the double need they stand in, of the contiouall
helpfulnesse of Christ Jesus.
In the understanding, and distinct consideration of all these, the diverse and
distinct ends of the Death, and Sacrifice of Jesus Christ will appear clearly.

1 Concerning Jesus Christ, his coming into the world, and leaving the world.

First, in respect of his mission from the Father into the world, it was
twofold:

1 He came, and was sent into the world to be the Savior of the world, 1 John
4.14. To save finners, 1 Timothy: 1.15. That is, In the nature of man, subjected to
humane infirmities, Heb. 10.5. To be made under the Law, to redeem such as
were under the Law, Gal. 4.4. And so to bear their sins, Psasm: 40.12. And
suffer their Curse, Gal: 3.13. And dye the death of, and for All, 2 Cor: 5.14.
Heb: 2.9. And so dying for their sins, to rise for their justifieation, Rom:
5.25. And so he said, John 10.14. I have power to lay down my life, and I have
power to take it again: This Commandment have I received of my Father: And so
he dyed, and rose to the ends fore-shown, page 2 and 3. And in respect of this
mission, his death and sacrifice was to take away, and be the propiation for,
the sins of the whole world, Heb. 9.26. John 1.29. 1 John 2.2.

He came, and was sent into the world to bear witness to the truth, John 18
37. And so to be a Preacher of the Gospel, in the Declaration of this great
Grace, and Salvation, Heb: 1.2. and 2.3. And by his good works and miracles to
win men to the belief and receipt thereof, John 5.36. and 14.11. And to give
the promises of the New Testament, and of eternal life, to those that were
prevailed with, to believe on him, John 17.6, 7, 8. and 14.26. and 16.7. And of
his mission to this Ministration, it is said, Rom: 15.8. That Jesus Christ was
a Minister of the Circumcision (that is, of the Jews) for the truth of God,
etc. And of this mission, (when some came to him for some fruits of the
ministration thereof) it is, that he said, Matthew. 15.24. I am not sent, but
unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel. And larger Commission he gave not
to his Disciples, till he had finished his own course, Matthew. 10.5, 6. But then
he enlarged this mission for all Nations, All the World, Matthew. 28.19. Mark.
16.15. And sent them into the world, even as the Father had sent him into the
world. John 17.18. which can be understood but of this his mission for
ministration (for only himself is the propitiation,) Ioh. 20.21. And of this
ministration also he says, John 12 49, 50. I have not spoken of my self, but
the Father which sent me; he gave me a commandment what I should say, and what
I should speak, And I know that his commandment is life everlasting;
whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak,
John 14.10. And thus he dyed in testimony of obedience, love, and faithfulness
to his Father, Phil. 2.8. -- 10. And of love and faithfulness to his sheep,
that had been taught by him, John 10.15. And so to confirm the truth of his
Doctrine, 1 Timothy 6.13. And to give us an example to follow his steps, in
teftifying love, and faithfulness to God, and Brethren, John 15.12, 13. 1 Pet:
2.21. 1 John 3.16. Not to make propitiation for hem, for be it; but to confirm
the truth, and testifi^ love, and faithfulness, and give good example, Ephesians.
5.2.

But now, if we consider of Jesus Christ, according to both his Missions
together, as to make Propitiation; And in preaching the Gospel, to give the
Promises of the New Testament to his Disciples; Then we shall find also, that
he so dyed, to confirm, ratify, and seal the New Testament of precious
Promises, and so it was for his called and chosen ones, Luke 22.20. Heb. 9.15,
16. Gal. 3.15. And thus of his mission into the world.

2 In respect of his business, in leaving the world, and offering himself to
the Father; it was also twofold, as Scripture shows.

1 It was to present himself as the ransom, and sacrifice, with the virtue of
his blood to God for Mankind; and thereby to obtain, and receive to himself (or
into his own hands to dispose) as the public person in the room of Mankind,
remission of sins, justification, fullness of spirit, and authority, and to be
the Mediator between God and M^n, Heb: 9.12, 14.24 1 Timothy: 2.5. And so to be our
Peace, Ephesians: 2.14, 16. The propitiation for our sins, and the sins of the
whole world, 1 John 2.2. And Wisdom, Righteonsnesse, Sanctification, and
Reslemption for men, and to all that believe in him, John 1.4. 1 Cor: 1.30.

2 It was to take on him, and execute his office of Lord and Mediator, and high
Priests, etc. To send forth, tender, and dispense of the grace and Spirit,
which he, as the public person has received in the humane nature glorified,
to enlighten, convince, and draw even the rebellious, that they might believe,
etc. Psalm. 68.18. John 1.7.9. and 16.8, 9, 10. And to sprinkle and wash the
consciences of Believers, with the spiritnall application of his precious
blood, and shedding abroad in the heart of Believers, the free, and rich grace
appearing there-through, renewing, comforting, and leading them into all truth,
Heb. 12.24 and 9.14. Rev. 1.5. Tit. 3.4 5. Himself remaining a husband, and
Advocate for them, Ephesians. 5.25, 26, 27. 1 John 2.1. In both which appears a
twofold end of his blood, and sacrifice offered:

The one, the obtaining redemption, etc. to make known, and tender to men, that
they might believe, John 3.17. Ephesians. 2.5, 6, 7.

The other, The communication thereof too, and effectual operation in
Believers, John 17.3. Ephesians 5, 26, 27.

2 Concerning Mankind, in respect of the double misery, and enmity against God,
which by falling into sin, they fell into.

1 The first is, the misery and enmity in the very state and condition, into
which mankind by sin were fallen, which was such as stood cross to the
merciful God, to keep him back from showing any favor, or grace at all to
mankind; for the Truth of God requites the Death of man sin being entered,
Genesis 2.17. And the Justice of God requires the execution of the Curse on man,
that has failed of his duty, Gal. 3.10. And so, though God did not upon the
fall of man, turn enemy to mankind; But in his beart did pity him, Tit. 3.4.
And his bowels of compassion moved for mankind: so as he would not for that
fall, make him as the Devil and his Angels, (something like that said of
Israel, Hos. 11.6-9.) Yet Truth, and Justice stood against the showing forth of
this mercy, and extending of peace to mankind: yea, had not the nature of
mankind been polluted and filled with averseness and eumity against God upon
the fall (as indeed it was;) yet by reason of sin committed, though it had
been but once, and passed, leaving only guiltiness behind it, even that put
such enmity in the state and condition of mankind, and made such a pertition
between God and mankind, that Truth and Justice would not (without a
satisfaction) that any mercy should be showed, or peace given him, who had by
that offense sold himself from God to Satan, and thrown himself under guilt of
sin, and desert of Curse, and Death; so as it brought a necessity of
inflicting curse and death upon him; which if men suffer in their own
particular persons, they can never overcome; and without suffering, they can
have no remission, Heb. 9 22.

Now to remedy this misery, and take away this enmity in the state and
condition of mankind, Jesus Christ, by the will of God, even the will of his
Father, and his own free will, it being one, and the same, with the will of his
Father, has taken the nature of mankind, subjected to infirmities, and the
cause of mankind upon him; and in their stead, being made under the Law, under
which they were fallen, has borne all their sins, and suffered all their curse
and so dyed for All, That all were dead, and has risen again just, and free
from all their sins imputed to him; And a vict^rer over all their curse, and
death imposed on him, and so ascended, and offered up himself to God a
spotless sacrifice, and a ransom to God for all men, and God has accepted
it; so that for mankind in him, mercy, and truth are met, righteousness and
peace have kified, Psul. 85 10. And he is become the propitiation for the sins
of the whole world, 1 John 2.2. having slain the enmity, Ephesians. 2.10. Having
taken out of the way All that (was only between God, and us, and so) was
contrary to us, Col: 2.14. And so has given himself aransome for All to God,
and bought all men of God, 1 Timothy ^ 6. 2 Pet. 2.1. And here is the infinite
wisdom, and great love of God, in finding out this remedy for mankind; which
from the beginning, was in himself hidden in his own Bosom; And this he
brought to pass, so putting all to death, in the death of his Son, and setting
them in heavenly places in him, That he might show forth the riches of his
grace, Ephesians. 2.5, 6, 7. And so war God in Christ, reconciling the World to
himself, not imputing their trespasses to them, 2 Cor. 5.14, 19. And so has
made a way for himself, to show mercy to whom he will, And opened the door to
life, and immortality for mankind, 2 Timothy 1.10.

And thus has Jesus Christ, by shedding his blood, and presenting it to his
Father, redeemed all men of God, and taken the enmity out of their stateand
condition, and is become their Lord, Having wrought redemption, and salvation
in his own body for them, even for all men, 1 Timothy 2. 5. Sinners, 1 Timothy 1.15.
Ungodly, and his enemies, And that while they were such, Roan. 5.6. That he
might bring them to God, 1 Pet. 2.24. and 3.18. And yet unless he proceed to
do more for men, then all this, none of them will come into God, John 6.44, 45.
For,

2 There is a misery, and enmity in the nature of mankind through which he is
so averse to God; That though the enmity in the state and condition be slain:
And all that which was (between God and Mankind) contrary to them taken out of
the way, Ephesians. 2.16. Col. 2.14. yet will not mankind come into God, but remain
sinners, and ungodly still, foolish, disobedient, and deceived, living to
themselves, and after their own lusts, and so in enmity against God. Romans 3.10.
-- 19. Ephesians. 2.1, 2, 3. Tit. 3, 2, 3. And such (however ransomed by Christ:)
neither can, nor shall enter his Kingdom, nor have any inheritance with Christ,
1 Cor. 6.9, 10. Gal. 15.19, 20, 21. But if not brought out of this enmity
(which is as impossible to them to do of themselves, as to have ransomed
themselves) their condemnation will be more fearful, 2 These. 1.8.

Now to remedy this misery, and take this enmity out of the nature of man,
Jesus Christ ascended to Heaven, and with the virtue of that blood he shed for
mankind, having offered up himself a spotless Sacrifice to God, and obtained
eternal redemption, and received all fullness of Power, Authority, and Spirit,
as the public person in the humane nature glorified. Act. 2.31.32. Psalm.
68.18. Does send forth of that Spirit (in the means he uses) at one time or
other, to enlighten, and move at the hearts of men, John 1.9. To reprove, and
convince them of the sinfulness in themselves, and the vanity of all their
Idols, and all righteousness of their own working, and of the fullness of that
righteousness, and life in him, John 16.8, 9, 10. And so calls them, Prove.
8.4.5, 6. Isa 45.22. and 55.1, 2. That in their turning at his reproof, he may
power out his Spirit, and make known his words to them, Prove. 1.23. That so
through him they might believe, and be saved, John 1.5, 7. and 3.7. And though
all resist, and go out of the way, Romans 3.10. -- 19. And that this is the great
condemnation, when light comes, to love, or choose darkness rather, John 3.19.
And he might justly give them all up, and be righteous, Rom: 3.5, 6. yet for a
time, he uses patience, and striveth with them, Genesis 6.3. That they might
repent, Rom: 2.4. And to some he gives more abundance of his grace, and
overcomes them, as Bullocks unaccustomed to the yoke; Ier. 31.18, 20. Isa
30.18. And brings them in to believe, Ephesians. 2.7, 8, 9, 10. Phil: 1.29. And
these he redeemeth with his precious blood, by presenting, and applying it
close to their heart, sprinkling it thereon, and discovering such free, and
infinite riches of grace therethrough, that all things else, though never so
forethought of as gainful; appears to them as loss in comparison of this
grace, allureing to win Christ, and be found in him: And so (as we by of our
Children from their vanities to their books, Phil. 3.7, 8, 9.
etc. with gifts) he buyeth, and purchases us with his blood from our vain
lusts, hopes, and conversations, and from among men unto God, 1 Pet. 1.18.19.
Reu. 5.9. And then by the spiritual application of the virtue of his blood
purges the conscience from dead works to serve the living God, Heb. 9.14. And
so in his love, washes us from our sins in his own blood, Reu. 1.5. And those
whom he has not only bought of God, (as he has done all men, 1 Timothy 2.6.)
but also purchased them unto God from among men, and washed them in his love
from their sins, 2 Pet. 2.1. Reu. 5.9. and 1.5. John 13.8. These, and these
only are his Church, and pecular people, Act. 20.28. Ephesians. 5.27. In whose
soul and body he works salvation, through the application of that salvation
which the has wrought in his own body.

And in this consideration of the double enmity to God into which man fell, and
the re^^^cy in Christ appears three ends of the Sufferings, Blood, Death, and
Sacrifice of Christ: namely two ends of the presentation, and offering it to
God; one to take away the enmity that was in the State, and condition of
mankind, Ephesians. 2.16. The other, to receive spirit to send forth in the
declaration of this grace, to reconcile men to God, that the enmity in there
nature might be removed, Ephesians. 2.7. 2 Cor. 5.20. and one end of the spiritual
presentation, and applycation of it to the heart, and conscience of men,
namely, to purge the conscience, and wash them from their sins, and renew them
to God, Heb. 9.14. Concerning the Church of God on earth, in respect of the
double need they stand in of the continual helpfullnesse of Christ.

1. The believers, though made free in Christ, and their conscience purged,
their heart renewed, and spirit made alive for righteousness sake, John 8.36.
Gal. 5.1. Heb. 9.14. Ezekiel. 36.25. Romans 8.10. yet for the time of their warfare,
there is a remaining of the old Disposition, although unthroned from the heart,
and weakened yet working in all the powers, and faculties of the soul, and
parts and members of the body, lusting against the spirit, and to satisfy the
affections, and lusts of the flesh, and attempting to lead Captive to the law
of sin, and death, Gal. 5.17. Romans 7.14. -- 24. Besides the manifold
temptations from the world, by Customs, Promises, Threats, Asurements, Terrors,
1 John 2 16. And also from Satan taking advantage from the flesh, and the
world, and adding strength to the lusts, and temptations thereof, adding his
own fiery and he lish suggestions, etc. 1 Pet. 5.8. whereby it falls out,
that in many things, we (even Believers) offend all, James 3 1. 1 John 1.8 10.

Which remaining evil, and off nees overtaken, which do defile and make
unmeete to appear before God; and if they be not pardoned and purged away,
they will exclude from his presence, and bring to death again, Psalm 5.4, 5, 6.

Now the Blood of Jesus, and the grace therethrough extended, is the only
thing that can purify, and cleanse from these defilements, Heb. 9.14. Reu.
1.5. 1 John 1.9. So that here is still need of coming to Christ for his
cleansing herewith, Zach. 13.1. 1 John 1.9.

2 The believers having so many, and great enemies fighting against them Ephesians.
6.12. so many and great sufferings to undergo, Act. 14.22. 2 Timothy 3.12. And so
many, and great servises of love to go forth in, till they be wholly conformed
to Christ, Col. 2.6. and 3.12.-16. Phil. 2.1.-6. And they having no good thing
dwelling in their flesh. Romans 7.18. nor ability in themselves for a good
thought, as of themselves, 2 Cor. 5.5. so as unless he work all for, and in
them, there will be no abiding peace, Esa. 26.12.

Great need have they therefore of his continual presence, and sending forth
supplies of spirit to overcome their enemies, Mat. 10.19 20. Romans 16.20. to
support in sufferings, Esa. 43.1. 1 Cor. 10.13. to sanctify them throughout, 1
These. 5.23.24. And to comfort, teach, and lead into all truth, and to the
inheritance, Esa. 54 13.14. John 15.26 and 16.13.14.15. And so to perfect all
that concerns them, Psalm 138.8. And for this cause is he by virtue of his
precious Blood, and Sacrifice, an Advocate, and great High Priest, and
Mediator of the new Testament, at his Fathers right hand for believers that
are his called and chosen ones, 1 John 2.2. Heb. 3.1.-6. and 8. and 9.15.

And in this consideration of the Churches need of Christ, and his way of
supply, we may see one end of his continual presenting the virtue of his Blood
and Sacrifice before his Father, and applying it to the hearts and consciences
of his people both together, to keep them clean before his Father, and to
cleanse, purify, and conform them to himself, Rev. 1.5. And so in respect of
both his presentation of his Sacrifice to his Father, and his gracious and
spiritual application of the same to believers. It is said, Ephesians. 5-25,
26.27. Christ also loved the Church, and gave himself for it, that he might
sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water. by the word; that (as he
presents it in himself spotless before the Father, Coloss. 1.22. so) he might
present it to himself a glorious Church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any
such thing, but that it should be holy and without blemish, And in the right
understanding of these things, we may understand the ends of the Sufferings,
Blood, Death, and Sacrifice of Christ.

First, the ends of the sheeding his blood, and so of his suffering and dying,
was 1. To satisfy for the sin of the world, and so to fulfill the truth of
God, and satisfy Divine Justice, and answer the Law, and abolish death, as is
foreshewn, page 2. 2. To confirm and ratifle the new Testament of precious
Promises, for all that through the heavenly call believe on him, as is shown
page 14. 3. To testify obedience, love, and faithfulness in his Ministration,
and so to confirm his doctrine, and give all his Disciples an example, as is
shown, p. 13.


Secondly, the ends of the virtue of this his precious blood and death in
offering himeelfe a spotless sacrifice to his Father, Scripture shows to be
1. That he might be the Propitiation for the sins of the world, as page
3.4.6.7. 2. That he might obtain eternal redemption for mankind, and procure
some mercy, means, and patience to be used toward them, as pages, 5, 6, and
13. 3. That he might be the Mediator between God and men, as page 4.12. 4. That
he might be the great high Priest, Prophet, King, and so the Advocate for, and
of his Church, p. 15.16.12. 5. That through him by his Spirit there might be a
showing, declaration, and tender of the grace of God to men, to call them,
less clearly in his works of creation, and providence, and more fully and
clearly in the Gospel of salvation preached to men, as p. 6.12.14.


Thirdly, the ends of his spiritual discovery, tender, and application of his
precious blood, and sacrifice to men, Scripture shows to be, 1. To convince men
of sin, and the vileness of sin in themselves, and the vanity of all their
own wisdom, and righteousness to help them, and of the complete
righteousness that is in him; thereby to empty them, and pierce their hearts,
and submit them to himself, Zach. 12.10. Gal. 2.21. Phil. 3.7, 8. Joh.
16.8-10. Luke 2.34. 2. To purchase and redeem these convinced from among men,
and from their Idols, and vain conversation, unto God, Rev. 5.9. 1 Pet.
1.18.19. Act. 20.28. and 26.18. 3. To wash, and cleanse these his so purchased,
in the discovery of the freeness and abundance of his grace, through his
precious blood, enlightening, enlivening, comforting, sanctifying and preserving
them to the inheritance, Eoh. 5.25, 26.27.


And these things considered distinctly, as the Scripture sets them forth, lead
to the right understanding of the ends of Christ's death and sacrifice, when it
is spoke of in respect of his dying, and bloodshedding. And when it is spoke
of in respect of that, and also his presenting himself with the virtue of
that, to his Father; and when it is spoke of in both these former respects, and
also together therewith, in respect of his spiritual discovery, tender, and
application thereof to men; in which is variety of the extent of the sense and
signification.

CHAP. IV.
A Digression, showing how these things were shadowed in the Sacrifices and
Ordinances of the first Testament, or the Law.

A Perfect image made by a curing limmer may clearly present the visage and
complexion of him whose Image it is, though it have no life, and so neither see
nor breathe, etc. But a shadow, or the first rude draught will not do so much;
only may discover, that it is to be of a man, or a woman, and not of a beast:
but whether man or woman, or whom it shows not as the Image finished (in which
the shadow passes) does. Now the law had the shadow of good things to come,
but not the very image of the things: they were paterns and figures of heavenly
things for the time present, but not a full demonstration of them, Heb. 10.1.
and 9.9.23. Now, then, if we call to mind,

1. The offering for sin, to make Atonement, was first slain, and after that
the blood sprinkled at the Altar, and on the Atonement-day, before the
Mercy-seat; and the people afflicted in themselves, and blessed by the Priest,
Lev. 9. -- 15.22. and 16. per totum, shadowed; Jesus delivered to death for our
sins, and presenting himself with the virtue of his blood to the Father, to
make the Atonement, and obtain redemption for us; and his blessing us, in
sprinkling his blood on our hearts, melting and purging the conscience, Heb.
1.3. and 9.12.14.24. and 10.1. -- 19.

The Passover, a Lamb without blemish, and slain, and then the blood with a
bunch of hyssop dipped therein, sprinkled on the two side-Posts, and the upper
door Posts, that the striking Angel might passover, Exodus 12. And then the
flesh roasted with fire, eaten; Shadowed Jesus Christ the Lamb of God, that
takes away the sin of the world, John 1.29. Heb. 9.26. His dying for our sins,
1 Cor. 15.3.4. And by his Spirit sprinkling the virtue of his blood on the
believing heart, without which no safety, Heb, 12.24. and our feeding on him by
faith, without which no eternal life, John 6.35.36. so that bloodshed
presented to the Lord, and applied to such as come to the Sacrifices, are all
held forth distinctly, as distinct and diverse works.

3. For the people that came to these Sacrifices, for whom blood was not only
shed, but presented to God, and who had the atonement, and such reconciliation
as was thereby affoorded, there was yet provided a water of Purification to
cleanse them from defilements, when they befell them, and the defiled person
not cleansed with it, might not approach to the holy things without danger of
death: now it was not enough, There was for them a water of purification, and
it was right, nor that it was put in a vessel, and running water put thereto;
unless a clean person dip with a branch of Hissop, and sprinkle him that is
unclean, he remains unclean, and must die: by Sprinkling, is Cleansing.

And does not this shadow out Jesus Christ, the fountain of cleansing, and
Laver of regeneration, and purification right with with God, yet cleasing none
in their own hearts, etc. without application and spiritual sprinkling, Heb
9.13, 14. and 12, 24. Zach. 13.1. Tit. 3.4, 5. Ezekiel. 36.25. Consider and
compare the Scriptures, and say, 1, Did not the red Hyfer slain without the
Camp, and her flesh burnt, Numb. 19.2.3.5.
Numb. 19.2, 3, 5. shadow out Jesus that knew no sin, made sin for us, and
suffering without the gate: and after in the power of the Spirit, and fire of
his love, offering up his whole self a Sacrifice to God for us? 2 Cor. 5.21,
Heb, 9.14. and 10.12. and 13.12. 2. Verse. 9.
Did not the remainders, or ashes of the Heyfer, shadow forth the remaining
Records, Testimonies, and virtues of the death and sacrifice of Jesus, who died
for our sins, and rose for our justification, Verse. 4.
and presented his sacrifice to God, and applies it to us, (as was shadowed by
the blood sprinkled before the Tabernacle, 1 Corinthians. 15.1-4. Heb, 9.12.13.14.
And is not this the water of Separation, or Purification from uncleanness,
Ezekiel. 36.25. Rev. 1.5 3. Verse 9.
Did not the clean Place without the Camp, where these ashes were kept for a
purification for sin, shadow forth the Gospel of Christ, or word of grace,
which J. Christ by his Spirit has breathed, and caused to be written, and
therein declared and testified, and kept as in record, the truth and virtue of
the bloodshed, death and sacrifice of Christ, and the offering it to the
Father, and its prevalency with him, and for whom; and his tender and
application of it, and the virtue thereof, and in whom; Are not all the sayings
hereabout plain, 1 Cor. 15.1. -- 4.
2 Cor. 3.12.13. and 1.2. Faithful, 1 Timothy 1.15. True, 2 Pet. 1.16. -- 19. And
in righteousness nothing froward, perverse, equivocall, or wreathed in them,
Prove. 8.6, 7, 8, 9. and 22.20, 21. Eccles. 12.10. That we may rather take those
sayings as they express the matter, then any other sayings, or glosses, they
are very righteous and faithful; his word is very pute, Psalm. 119.138. The
inspiration of the Spirit of truth, 2 Timothy 3.16. 4. Did not the ashes of the
burnt Heyfer of Purification for sin, and running water put thereto in a
vessel, shadow forth the Word of Grace, setting forth the virtue of the death
and sacrifice of Christ inspired, and put in the hearts of the servants of God,
2 Cor. 5.18.19. and his free and rich grace, and love appearing therein, shed
abroad thereby by the holy Ghost in the heart of those, whom he has brought to
believe in Christ, and so united them to him, 1 Cor. 1.30. and so filled them
with his love, that it springs up like love in them, that constrains them to
declare this grace, and beseech others to accept it, 2 Cor. 5.14, 15.19. 1 Pet.
1.21, 22. for which cause they are called Stewards and Ministers of this grace,
1 Cor. 3.1. 2 Cor. 3.3. and said to have this treasure in earthen vessels, that
the excellency of the power may appear to be of God, and not of them, 2 Cor.
4.7. and so are called chosen vessels unto God, to bear his name, Act. 9.15. 5
Did not the clean person, taking Hissop, dipping it in the water, and
sprinkling the unclean; shadow forth Jesus Christ the just, who by his own
Spirit stirs this grace in the hearts of his servants, and gives them what
to speak, 2 Cor. 4.6. and 5.14. 1 Cor, 2.12.13. and gives proof of his own
speaking in their ministration, 2 Cor. 13.3. Making manifest the savor of his
knowledge by them, 2 Cor. 2.14. and himself by his Spirit turning the heart of
men to God, Acts 11, 21. and weighing his mind in the heart of these so turned
to believe in him, 2 Cor. 3.3. further minding and teaching them that they have
heard, John 14.26. and taking off the things of Christ, and showing to them,
John 16.14 and so sprinkling and washing them with this water of purification
(the virtue of the precious blood of Christ, and his infinite love streaming
there-through) melting, cleansing, comforting, renewing, etc, Heb. 9.13.14. and
12.24. Rev. 1.5. Ezekiel. 36.25. without which a man, (notwithstanding all the
former) remains unclean still.


In all this also is shadowed the several distinct ends of the death and
sacrifice of Christ, as presented to God, and as applied to men.

Fourthly, the Israelites needing, and having in their travels the Cloud, as
the testimony of Gods presence to guide them, and his mighty arm to lead them,
uphold and defend them, and Manna from heaven, and water out of the Rock to
sustain and refresh them, Exodus 13.21, 22. and 15.2.12. and 16.17. shadowed
forth our need of, and Christ his gracious vouchsafing to be our Advocate, (by
virtue of his sacrifice) at his Fathers right hand, from thence sending forth
his holy Spirit to continue his presence with us, and give in his promises, and
so to teach, guide, comfort and strengthen us against temptations, and to go
through all sufferings in alll services of love, etc. 1 John 2.1, 2. Heb.
9.14.15, John 14.14.26. and 15.26. and 16.14.

And so in this digressiu to see how things were shadowed, we may view the ends
of Christ's sacrifice forementioned, as also that which follows to be said.

CHAP. V.
The necessity of the Sufferings, Blood, Death, and Sacrifice of Christ. It is
shown in that already said.

FIrst, for Christ his shedding of his blood, and dying for us, it was
altogether necessary: for ( Heb. 9.22.) without shedding of blood is no
remission of sins. The truth of God makes a necessity for the sinner to die,
and without the death of the sinner cannot be fulfilled, Genesis 2.17. Ezekiel.
18.20. The justice of God makes a necessity for the sinner to suffer the curse,
and without the sinner do suffer, the curse cannot be satisfied, Deuteronomy.
27.15-26. Gal. 3.10. And as nothing without shedding of blood and death, can
fulfill truth, and satisfy justice: so no blood and death, but the blood and
death of Man, the very nature that sinned, can satisfy, Heb. 9.9. and 10.4.
And if particular men should suffer this curse and death in their own persons,
they could never overcome, but must perish in that suffering for ever, and so
can neither suffer for themselves nor for another, to procure a way for
remission of sins, Psalm. 49.7 8. neither indeed to make satisfaction for
others, will the Blood, and Death of any man serve, unless the same be a just,
and an innocent man that has no sin of his own to satisfy for, Heb. 9.26.27.
Yea even the blood of a just man, unless he be, as the first Adam before his
fall, a public man, Romans 5.12. And made (as all men by the fall became under
the law, Gal. 4.4. yea unless this man be also the Son of God, even
God-man,) it will not be sufficient Heb. 10.5-10. Mat. 1.21.23.

And this man, God-man, even Jesus Christ being come, and as the public person
made under the law, when he had lived thirty-three years, and upward an
innocent life, so as noman could accuse him of sin, John ^. 46. yea in all
righteousness, and holiness, and fullness of good works, and spent about
three years in ministration of the Gospel; yet would not all this his
righteous working, though accompanied with many miracles, and with frequent
fasting, prayers, and tears make satisfaction for the sin of mankind, without
his Death, and Blood; to instruct us wherein (and not in any unwillingnesse to
suffer according to the will of the Father, Phil. 2.8. Heb. 10.5.-10.) He
uttered this prayer, Mat 26.39. If it be possible; let this Cupp pass from me,
etc. And so that which the High Priest spoke not of himself, but by prophecy
concerning the nation of the Jews, John 11.50. It is true; for all mankind; It
was altogether, necessary for mankind, that Jesus Christ should dye, Gal.
3.10.13.

2 For Jesus Christ once dead to rise again, and ascend to the right hand of
God, and to present the virtue of this his own blood, in offering himself a
spotless sacrifice to his Father for mankind; This also was altogether
necessary: for, however truth had fulfilling, and justice had satisfying in
his bloodshed, and death; 2 Cor. 5.14. Gal. 3.13. Yet if he had not risen from
the Dead, and ascended with the virtue of his own blood into the Heavens, and
there offered himself a spotless Sacrifice to God for mankind; There could
have been no Justification, no redemption, no eternal life, and inheritance
obtained, and received by Christ into his own hands to dispense to men, nor any
door opened to show forth, and dispense this grace to men, that by repentance,
and faith they might come into Christ, and receive the same, nor could there
have been any resurrection of their bodies after Death, nor exercise of Christ's
Lordship over them, in absolving, or condemning according to the Gospel, Romans
4.25. He was raised again for our justification, 1 Cor. 15.17. If Christ be
not raised; ye are yet in your sins, verse 20. But now Christ is risen from
the Dead: Heb. 9.12. By his own blood he entered in once into the most h^ly
place: having obtained eternal redemption, verse 24. He entered into Heaven it
self, Reu. 1.18. I am he that lives, and was Dead, and behold I am alive for
evermore, 1 John 5.11. God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his
Son, 2 Timothy 1.10. who has abolished Death, and brought life, and mortality
to light by the Gospel, John 16.7. etc. It is expedient for you that I go
away; for if I go not away the Comforter will not come unto you: But if I
depart, I will send him to you; he shall reprove the world, etc. verse 18.11.
He will guide you into all truth, etc. verse 13.14.15. Psalm. 68. Thou have
ascended on high, thou have led Captivity Captive, thou have received gifts in
the man (for men, Act. 2.33. Ephesians. 4.8.) yea even for the Rebellious, that the
Lord God might dwell among them, Act. 5.30.31. Him has God exalted at his
right hand, to be a Prince, and a Savior to give repentance unto Israel and
forgivness of sins, Act. 13.30. God raised him from the dead etc. to verse
39. verse 47. I have set thee to be a light to the Gentiles, that thou
should be for salvation to the ends of the Earth, Mat. 12.18. And he shall
show Judgment to the Gentiles; If there be no resurrection from the Dead, then
Christ is not Risen, and if Christ be not Risen; then our preaching is vain,
and your faith is also vain, 1 Cor. 15.13.-20. But now Christ is risen from
the dead, and become the first fruits of them that sleep. verse 21. for since
by man came Death, By man also the resurrection from the dead, and verse 22.
etc. and Romans 14.9 to this end, Christ both dyed, and rose, and revived that he
might be the Lord, both of dead, and living, Act. 10.36. He is Lord of all, 2
Cor. 5.10. For we must all appear before the Judgment Seat of Christ, etc.
And of this he has given assurance to all men in that he has raised him from
the Dead. Acts 17.31.

All which shows the necessity of Christ's resurrection, and ascension, and
with the verrue of his own blood, presenting and offering himself to God in
the Heavens for men: to the ends fore-shown.

3 For Jesus Christ that has dyed, and risen, and with the virtue of his own
blood entered the Heaven, and by the eternal Spirit offered himself a spotless
sacrifice to God for men, Also by the same Spirit to discover this grace,
thereby to call, and draw in men to him, and then to sprinkle and wash them
with the presentation, and application of the virtue of his precious blood; And
by his grace there-through discovered to renew them, unite, and conform them
to Christ. This also is altogether necessary in respect of men^ ^eceit, and
enjoyment of justification, eternal life, and inheritance; for however, this
salvation which Jesus Christ has wrought, the redemption, justification, and
eternal life he by himself in his own body, as the Public man obtained for
men with God, be such, and so received by him for mankind, That it may be truly
said of him, and in respect of what he has, as the Public person done,
obtained received, and has in his own hands to dispense, that he is the
Saviout of the world, Ioh. 4.42. And has by himself made purgation of our
sins, Heb. 1.3. and 9.26. and obtained eternal redemption, Heb. 9.12.50. That
as Romans 3.23, 24. All have sinned, and come short of the glory of God, being
justified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,
and Romans 5.18. As by the offense of one, unto all men to condemnation, even so
by the righteousness of one, unto all men to justification of life; yea, 1 John 5.11. God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son: yet
notwithstanding all this, Unless this grace be so discovered by the Spirit to
men, that they be drawn in to Christ, and he by his Spirit sprinkle his blood
on their heart, and shed abroad his love therein, and so wash, and renew them,
they cannot in their own particular persons be justified, and partake of
eternal life, and receive the inheritance with him, Romans 3.25, 26. Tit. 3.4.5.
And this necessity of his sprinkling, and washing the Conscience with his
precious blood, may be seen true, in many respects.

1 In respect of sin, It suffices not for bringing men's particular persons
into the Kingdom of Heaven, That sin is satisfied, for by the sacrifice of
Christ, and so purged away by him as the public person, that he in the room:
of all mankind appear^t^ spotless at the Throne of God; But its requisite
also, that it be purged out of the Conscience, and out of the nature, and
conversation of such particular persons as enter that Kingdom; yea, and though
this work be not as the former, done at once in the very act of his
presentation, and offering himself to God, Heb. 1.3. and 9.12. and 10.10, 12.
But by degrees; yet those Degrees are according to the entrance, 2 Cor. 3.18. 2
Pet. 1.11. Romans 8.23. And so its said, Rev. 21.21. There shall in no wise enter
into it any thing that defiles, neither whatsoever works abomination, or a
lie, 1 Cor. 6.9. The unrighteous shall not inherit the Kingdom of God. Be not
deceived, neither Fornicators, nor Idolater, nor Adulterers, nor effeminate,
nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor Thieves, nor covetous, nor
Drunkards, nor Revilers, nor Extortioners, shall inherit the Kingdom of God,
Gal. 5.19, 20, 21. The work of the flesh are manifest, which are Adultery,
Fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred,
variance, emulation, strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, murders,
drunkenness, revilings, and such like, They which do such things shall not
inherit the Kingdom of God, Ephesians. 5.5. no Whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor
covetous man who is an Idolator, has any inheritance in the Kingdom of
Christ, and of God; so that such, unless they be washed, justified, purged,
and sanctified, they cannot enter; nor can any sorrows, tears, sacrifices,
works of righteousness of their own wash of the guilt, and take away the
venom of these sins, nor make their hearts and natures new, It is only the
precious blood and sacrifice of Christ, which by the eternal Spirit he offered
to God: by the same Spirit discovered to, and sprinkled on the heart, enabling
to believe, in which Peace is spoken to the heart remission of sins received,
and liberty by faith to reckon themselves according to Christ, and as they are
in him, who by his Spirit works his mind in them, and conformeth them to him
self, 1 Pet. 1.2. Rev. 1.5. and 5.9. Romans 3.25, 26. and 5.1. -- 5.1 C o 6.11. 2
Cor. 3.18. Tit. 3.4.

2 By reason of the blindness, darkness, and enmity, that by reason of sin
is the nature of man: For it suffices not for men's personal entrance into the
Kingdom, that in, and through Christ, God is light, and in him is no darkness
at all, unless men be brought into this light, and this light be in them that
they may walk in it, 1 John 1.5.7. and 2.8.9. 1 These. 5.4.5. nor yet is it
enough for men's personal entrance into the Kingdom, that the enmity in their
State, and condition be removed, unless also the enmity in their nature be
removed, Psalm. 68.21. neither is there any study, or labor of man in any
wisdom or works of righteousness of his own, that can bring him into this
light of God, and take this enmity against God out of his nature; but only the
spirit of Jesus Christ (which when he offered up himself a Sacrifice to God
for men, he received in the man, Psalm. 68.18.) Discovering and testifying of
Christ, and the virtue of his Blood, and the rich grace appearing therethrough,
that brings out of darkness into his marvelous light, and reconcileth the
heart, and powers to God, John 14.26. and 15.26. and 16.14.15. Col.
1.4.5.12.13. 1 Pet. 2.7.9. 2 Cor. 5.14 18, 19, 20. Tit. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

3 In respect of the first, and natural Birth, and that which men are by
propagation, and nature from the first Adam, whose Image they therein, and
thereby partake of, and bear, and so are by nature dead in sins, and
trespasses, Children of wrath, etc. Romans 5.19. 1 Cor. 15.46.48.49. Psalm. 51.5.
Job. 14.4. and 15.14. Ephesians. 2.1, 2, 3 So that however Christ as the public
person has wrought salvation in himself for men with God, and is justified,
and glorified at Gods right hand; yet unless a man be borne again, borne from
above, even of water, and the Spirit, the free and rich grace of God manifested
in the Application of the precious Blood of Christ to the heart, And that by
the holy Spirit of Christ in that Knowledge, and Application of the precious
Blood, giving him an escape from the Pollutions that are in the world through
lust, and making him partaker of the Divine nature; That so as he perpartooke
of misery by having his being from Adam, and partaking of his nature, he may
partake of justification and life, by having his being in Christ, and partaking
of his Divine nature; without this new Birth; he cannot enter the Kingdom of
God, John 3.3.5.6. 2 Cor. 5.17.20. 2 Pet. 1, 2, 3, 4. Tit. 3.3, 4, 5, 6, 7. And
indeed, till so borne from above, men are Aliens from God, and Christ, and the
life of God in Christ, Ephesians. 2.12. and 4.18. And however it be true, that in
Christ, and that he has done, obtained, and received, God has given us
eternal life, and this life is in his Son: yet this is also true, that
whoever of us has not the Son, the same has not life, life is received, and
enjoyed only in the receite, and enjoyment of the Son, 1 John 5.11.12. And
that is, when through his spiritual Discovery and sprinkling of his Precious
Blood, and Dispensation of his grace there-through to the heart, a man is
brought to believe on him; And so quickoned, borne, and renewed, Ephesians. 2.5.10.
Esa. 55.1. -- 9. And so such he gives the privileges of the Sons of God; who
to receive him, and are so borne, John 1.12.13. 2 These. 2.13.14. So that the
truth is, the necessity in respect of men's personal entrance into the
Kingdom, and being eternally saved, to be spiritually sprinkled, and washed
with the Blood of Christ; is so great, as there can be no greater, there being
no other way to the enjoyment of remission of sins, Humiliation for sin,
Justification before God, wisdom, righteousness, Sanctification, and
redemption, nor any fruitfulness that God will accept; But by this precious
Blood of Christ which he shed, and with the virtue thereof offered himself to
God by his spirit sprinkled on the conscience: And his rich, and abundant
grace, manifested through the same, by the same spirit shed abroad in the
heart, and so leading to God, in which respect Christ only is the way for all
access to the Father, and without whom there is no coming to God, nor doing
any thing he will accept: John 14.6. Romans 3, 25. Ephesians. 1.7. 1 Cor. 1.30. John
15.4. 1 Pet. 1.18.19. Ephesians. 2.17.18. Heb. 10.10. -- 19.

This necessity of Christ his sprinkling his Blood on the Conscience, the whole
Gospel, and all the writings thereof, and Testimonies and examples therein do
show, and so does the Law also rightly understand.

CHAPTER 6.
A digression, to show how the Law shows the necessity of this Bloodshedding,
Death, and Sacrifice of Christ:

BEfore, in Chapter 4. was shown, how the ends of the suffering, Blood, Death,
and Sacrifice of Christ was shaddowed in the leviticall law, and types of old,
and the necessity of the acting, presenting, and applying the same, now if we
view the moral law, even the law of works, the holy, and righteous law of
God; It also will show, and urge the necessity of the Death, and Sacrifice of
Christ, in all the respects aforesaid, and that every way: If we consider this
holy law, 1. In respect of it self, 2 In respect of the ends of giving it, and
3. In respect of the power it has in this life in the consciences of men till
set free by Christ.

1 The Law it self is holy, spiritual, and righteous: Romans 7.12. Mat.
22.38.39. 1 John 3.4. Romans 7.7. Iam. 2.10. Mail. 1.6.
It is a holy Law, pointing us all to live to God the holy one, and according
to his Will, and Commands, enjoining to love God with all our heart, soul, and
strength, and our neighbor as our selves, and to walk in that love of God,
and our neighbor, and so it forbids every sin, and commands every Duty:
And it is a spiritual Law, requiring the Inmost heart, and Spirit; And the
utmost and perfect obedience of the whole man; so as the least rising motion to
any evil it forbids and concludes it sin: yea and the least want of the
through, spiritual, and perfect performance of all, or any one point it
condemns for sin, and for that sin puts under the guilt of the breach of
the whole Law: And it is a righteous law requiring of man noe more then is due
from man to God, and which shall be the righteousness of a man before God, if
he fulfill it, so as the law find no fault in him, Romans 2.13. and 10.5. Gal.
3.10.12. Romans 6. Deuteronomy. 27.15-26.
and it promises life to the observers, and will perform it, that being the
righteousness of the Law, and it sentenceth to death, and curse every one that
sins against any point, or comes short of the least title it requires; so
that this Law is holy, spiritual, and righteous in its Commandments of Duty,
In its Justifying the doers of it, in its convincing the Transgressors, and in
its leaving Transgressors to the curse; And indeed so holy, spiritual, and
righteous is this law, that in their own persons, and performances, noe one man
since Adam fell, but only Jesus Christ our Lord has fulfilled it to every
Jota, or can be Justified, and have life by it: For.

1 Though a man had such knowledge of the Law, that he could see all his Duty
therein required, And had also such a heart to keep this Law that he had
respect to every Commandment in it, and did his utmost to avoid every sin,
and to perform every duty, and that constantly in all his conversation: yet if
he attain not to the utmost the Law requires, but fail of that, if it were
but once, and but in one point; the Law puts him under the guilt of sin, and
danger of Curse, and Death, Romans 6.23. the wages of sin is Death, and James
2.10. whosoever shall keep the whole Law, and yet offend in one point, he is
guilty of all, and Gal. 3.10. Cursed is every one that continues not in all
things that are written in the book of this Law to do them, and Romans 5.12. all
have sinned, James 3.2. In many things we offend all; so that by the deeds of
the Law shall no flesh be justified, Romans 3.20.

2 A man having once sinned, and fallen under the guilt of sin, and so into
the desert of death, and curse, as all men have, there is no
after-righteousnesse of his performance that can take away that sin; which
unless it be taken away, he cannot be justified before God, though in his
after righteousness he could answer the whole Law, but only for that one
offense: whence those sayings, Job. 9.15.20.21.22. nor can any tears,
confessions, or washing themselves with snow water, take off this sin that
they may appear righteous before God, Job. 9.30.31.32. Nor can any gifts or
sacrifices of Bulls and Goats, Heb. 10.4. nor of thousands of Rams, or ten
thousand Rivers of Oil, or the first borne of Beasts, or of a man's body,
satisfy for, and take away sin, Mich. 6.6.7.

3. Neither can there be any mangling, impairing, or abating, much less
abolishing of this holy and spiritual law that the Almighty will tolerate, nor
did Jesus Christ come to destroy this Law, but to fulfill it, Mat. 5.17.18.
Think not that I am come to destroy the Law or the Prophets, I am not come to
destroy, but to fulfill: For verily I say unto you, Till Heaven and Earth
pass, one jot, or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the Law, till all be
fulfilled, neither did Jesus Christ come to be an Arbitrator or Dayes-man, to
plead with God, and lay his hand upon him, that he might abate to men some part
of their duty required in the Law, and to lay his hand upon men to enjoin and
cause them to perform some part of their due to the Law, to give some
satisfying to God, and so make God and men friends that way, 1 Samuel 2.25. Job.
9.33. No such matter; but Jesus Christ himself in his own person while he was
here on earth, did perfectly fulfill this Law, so as no sin could be found in
him; but he was in respect of his own particular person, righteous and just,
even by that Law. And had he not been a public person in our stead, and so had
our sins; that Law could never have charged him, for he kept it fully, Heb.
7.29. Ioh. 8.46. 1 Pet. 2.22. Romans 3.19 Gal. 4.4. Esa. 53.2.6. 2 Cor. 5.19-21.
Gal. 3.13. Romans 4.25 2 Cor. 5.14. Romans 7.4. and 4.25.
But as the public person in the room of mankind. He was made under the Law
to redeem them that were under the Law; and so being under the Law for us, he
had all our sins that Law could charge us with, imputed to, and laid upon him;
and all the curse and death which Law could and did sentence us to, imposed
upon him. And so he suffered the curse, and died the death for our sins; yea
for us all, so as all are dead: And so he has satisfied the Law, that we are
dead to the Law by the body of Christ. And this Jesus Christ as the public
person is risen again for our justification, and has ascended to heaven, and
with the virtue of his own blood offered himself a ransom and sacrifice to
God, having obtained eternal redemption and life for men, Heb 9.12. Esa. 55.5.
John 16. Heb. 9.14. and 12.24. Reu. 1.5.
to dispense to such as believe on him. And now sends forth of that Spirit he
has received, discovering this grace, to draw men to believe on him: and in
the hearts of such as through grace believe in Christ, he by his Spirit
applies, sprinkleth and washes with that precious blood, so as he enableth
them to receive the satisfaction of the Law, which himself has made, and to
answer Law-charges therewith, Romans 4.24.25. and 5.2. -- 11. and 8 34. And to
receive and own to themselves as theirs by faith the righteousness that he is
become, and to rest on him, and approach in that to God, 1 Cor. 1.30. Phil.
3.3.7.8.9. and by the same Spirit in, and with the rich grace herethrough
streaming, he renews them, Tit. 3.4.5. and works love in them, 1 Pet.
1.18.21.22. yea, a more excellent love then Law discovered, in that it is a
love of God in and for Christ, 1 John 4.10. -- 19. and love of our brother as
Christ has loved us, Ioh. 15.1.2. And this love fulfils all righteousness,
yea from a better principle then law could have affoorded, Romans 13.10. the
Spirit in working this love, writing the law in the inward parts, 2 Cor. 3.3.
and leading to deny all evil, and live godly, etc. Tit. 2.11.12. and yielding
to and walking after the Spirit, a man shall neither fulfill the lusts of the
flesh, nor be under Law, Gal. 5.16.18. but have the righteousness of the Law,
(the life it promises, and cannot give yea a better life) fulfilled in him,
and have an abundant entrance into the Kingdom, Gal. 6.8. 2. Pet. 11. And thus
by Christ himself in his body, in all his conversation was the Law fulfilled;
and by him in his own body, as the public person, was the Law satisfied for
all it had against us: and by him through his Spirit applpying that
satisfaction to our hearts, he enables to believe and receive it; and in that
believing sheads abroad his grace in the heart, that leads to all
righteousness the Law requires, though from a better principle that will in
due season perfect the same, and he also will fill us with eternal life. And
without this coming, death, resurrection and sacrifice of Christ, the Law could
never have been fulfilled and satisfied: and without his spiritual application
to the heart, it will never be answered by us, or fulfilled in us; whence that
thanksgiving, or profession, Romans 7.25. and 8.1.2.3.4.

4. The ends of the making known, and giving this holy, spiritual, and
righteous law, was neither to justify those to whom it was given, nor to give
them life, nor to kill, and destroy from God for ever; for if it had been given
to give life, and justify, and bring to the inheritance; it had been against
the covenant and promises of God, and says therein; which to conceive, God
forbid, far be it from us, Gal. 3.18, 21. Romans 4.14. And if it had been given
to get righteousness by it, or to destroy from God for ever; ^t had been
against the grace of God testified in the Death, and resurrection of Christ,
and faith therein; which God forbid, and far be it from us to conceive, Gal.
20.21. and 3.11.12.13. Romans 4.13. -- 7.24.25. Heb. 2.9. Besides, the giving the
law in the hand of Moses a Mediator of the first Testament; shows, that it
was not given to justify; for then no need of a Mediator, nor was it given to
destroy from God for ever; for then he would not have given a Mediator, Gal.
3.17. And yet the law was given for good, holy, and merciful ends; For God in
his mercy having found a ransom, and given us life in him, and confirmed a
Covenant in him, John 1.4. 1 John. 1.1.2. which grace should have led men to
repentance, and faith in God, and living to him; But through blindness, Esa.
44.20. and 55.2. Gal. 3.19.
and hardness of heart; men slighted this great Salvation, and put confidence
in Idols, and superstitions, and lived in, and to themselves; And because of
Transgressions, the law was added till the seed should come, and this law to
discover that righteousness which is due from men to God:

1 To kill men in respect of themselves, of all that life which they have in,
and from themselves by any excellencyes, parts, endeavors, or workings of
theirs, in, and by themselves; By discovering their sinfulness, and the
Immeasurablenesse of it, and the curse, and wrath due to them, that so they may
charge themselves with it, which without the law, they would not do, Romans
3.19. and 4.15. and 5.13.20. By spoiling them of all hope of life by their own
workings, that they may say Amen to the curse, 1 Cor. 1.6.
and yield themselves as dead, and lost, and so receive the sentence of death
in themselves, Gal. 2.19. Romans 7.9. Deuteronomy. 27.26.

2 To occasion their submission to Christ, and so their high prizeing of the
grace, and righteousness, and life in him, that they may fall down before
him, and be quickened, and made alive by him, Romans 5.20. Gal. 2.19. who by
sprinkling his blood, and giving in his grace by his spirit, enliveneth them,
Heb. 9.14. Tit. 3.4.5. And so Romans 10.3. Christ is the end of the law for
righteousness to every one that believes, Gal. 2.20. and 3.22.24. which also
shows the necessity of the precious Blood of Christ, which he shead, and
presented to his Father for men to be by his spirit applied to men, without
which they can have no true peace, and freedom with God, John 13.8. and
8.32-36.

3 The power this law has in the consciences of men in this life, till they
know, and believe in Christ, and be set free by him, John 8.34-36. this holy,
spiritual, and righteous law, in respect of the spiritual affections, and
services therein required, was once in the heart of mankind; when God made man
in his own Image; And made him, and all men in him, as in the first public
person, righteous; then was it the natural bent of man to love God, and his
neighbor, and to walk in that love uprightly, Genesis 1.26, 27, 28. and 2.7.
Ecles. 7.29. And then while these righteous affections, and services were
naturally springing, and streaming in men; man was not under the power of the
Commandments thereof; with the promises and threats; But when man sinned, and
fell, He lost these righteous affections, and services out of his heart, and
inward, and natural bent; And became corrupt, averse, and full of enmity
against God, Genesis 3.10-13. Eccles. 7.29. Romans 5.12.18.19. And then fell under
the power of this law with its Commands, Threats, and Promises; And the effect
of this law as a spirit of Bondage entered into him: for such the power of the
work of God in his grace, both shown in the creation, and procured for men by
the Redemption, and extended to men for the redeemers sake, that it still
proclaims to men, and testifies, that it is man's duty and that he is hereby
bound to love God with all his heart, soul, and strength, and his neighbor as
himself, and to walk in that love, And the least short coming hereof is sin,
Ioh. 35.10.11. and 37.24. Deuteronomy. 5.6.7. 1 John 3.4. For though man by sin lost
his interest in God; yet God lost not his right and Authority over man, But
when man by sin, lost the inward and living principle of the law out of his
heart; Then through the Authority of God over man, and the power of God in his
works; man fell under the power of the law; And the effect of the law as a
spirit of bondage entered into his heart, and that with such force; that
according to the knowledge given him, whether by the works of God in creation,
and providence, or the law declared, and written, that it binds down, and
embondageth a man, that he can no otherwise have hope, or look to God for
acceptance and life, then as he conceives himself to keep this law, nor avoid
the fears of wrath, and Death, as he discernes himself a transgressor of it,
and as their conscience witness; so do their thoughts accuse, or excuse one
another, Romans 2.15. And so from the law, sin takes occasion to become often more
violent in its motions to sin, Romans 7.5.8. And from the law sin has its
strength to accuse, and terifie, Romans 7.11. 1 Cor. 15.56. And in desires of
avoiding danger, this spirit of bondage so laden with sin pollutes the
conscience to be dictating to seek peace in works of the law and to be
speaking peace there from, Romans 9.32. and 10.3. which still genders to bondage,
and leaves under the curse, Gal. 4.21.30. and 5.4. and 3.10. And this power
has law with its effect in the consciences of men in this life, till they be
set free by Christ; for the law can justify none that have at all sinned, nor
gives any hope for any repentance after sinning, nor any power or freedom for
coming in to God again, this is the work of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, to
justify from sin, and give repentance, and freedom to come in to God, John 8
34-36. Act. 5.31. So that only by Christ, by his spirit applying his pre^ious
blood to the heart, and streaming in his rich grace there through, the
conscience is purged from the accusation of sin, and from speaking, or seeking
peace by dead works; And gives in an inward living principle to serve the
living God, Heb. 9.14. And so washes from sin, Reu. 1.5. Renews, Tit. 3.4.
And sets them at Liberty for the things of the Kingdom, Gal. 5.1. enduing
them with the Spirit of adoption of love, power and a sound mind, Romans 8.15. 2 Timothy 1.7. And thus the law rightly understood in it self, and the ends of
giving it; And the power it has in the natural conscience shows the necessity
of the Precious Blood of Christ to be by his spirit applied to, and sprinkled
on the conscience.

CHAPTER VII.
Of the Excellency, and dignity of this Precious Blood of Christ that is
presented to the Father, and his Sacrifice being also presented to the heart.

FOR the Excellency, Dignity, and worth of the Blood, Death and Sacrifice of
Christ, presented, and offered to God for men, and presented, tendered, and
applied to men; It is beyond comparison or expression; yet we may understand a
little thereof, if we view, and consider it in four respects, 1. In respect of
the Sacrifice it self, 2. In respect of the appearance, and Declaration
thereof, 3. In respect of the glorious, and abundance of love herethrough
appearing, 4. In respect of the unvaluable, and inexpressible hope it gives to
all that receive it, besides the operation to be after spoke of.

1 In respect of the Presentation, and Sacrifice it self, it appears to be
of most excellent Dignitye, and worth in many notable respects, as to say.

1 In respect of the Priest that offered this Sacrifice, who was immediately
called of God, as Aron was, Heb. 5.4.5. And infinitely above and greater then
Aron, and all the Priests of his Order: for they had sins of their own also,
first to offer for, before they offered for the sins of the people, But this
our high Priest had no sin of his own to satisfy for, but his offering was
wholly, and altogether for us, Heb. 7.26.27. And their Highpriests were men
that had infirmities, and so dyed; But this High Priest, though the very man
that dyed for us, yet risen from the Dead, and alive for ever-more to
interceide for us, Heb. 7.23-25. and 5.5.6. Yea they were made Priests
according to the law of a carnal Commandment, But this High Priest after the
power of an endless life, Heb. 7.16.17. They without an Oath, this with an
Oath, Heb. 7.21. They the Sons of men, But this High Priest is the Son of
God; even God-man, Heb. 7.28. and 1 4-8. They went, and presented the Blood in
an earthly holy place, but this High Priest entered into Heaven it self, to
offer, and appear before God for us, Heb. 9.7.8.12.24. They though they
offered to God; yet they took no pleasure in their offerings, but this
High Priest offered to God, and he has accepted him, and set all his
wellpleasednesse in him, and set him at his right hand, and given all Authority
to him, Heb. 10.1-12. and 1.4.8. Oh consider how great an High Priest we have;
And how excellent then the Sacrifice that he has offered, and by virtue
whereof he interceideth, Heb. 1. and 3, and 5, and 7, and 8.

2 In respect of the Sacrifice it self which he offered; for every High Priest
is ordained to offer gifts, and Sacrifices; And it is of necessity that he have
somewhat also to offer, and that in the Heavens, Heb. 8.3.4. And so he has
offered a gift, a Sacrifice for satisfaction, for ransom, for propitiation,
and for a memorial, to intercede with for us; And this was not Gold, or
Silver, nor Bullocks, and Lambs, etc. nor the Blood of others, as the other
Priests offered, but his own most Precious Blood, his own most holy Body, even
that very Body in which he had borne our sins to the Tree, 1 Pet. 2.24. In
which he dyed for our sins, and rose for our Justification, Romans 4.25. Yea the
Body, which is the Body of the Son of God, John 1.14. In whom the fullness of
the Godhead dwells bodily, Col. 2.9. This is the gift, the ransom, the
Sacrifice; he offered himself, his own Body without spot to God for us, Heb.
9.12.14. and 10.5-10. Oh how fit, how satisfying, and of what infinite value is
this Blood, and Sacrifice of his!

3 In respect of the Altar on which this Sacrifice was offered, and by which it
was borne and carried up to God; The Altar of Gods appointment, whatever it be,
is greater then the gift, or Sacrifice, and Sanctifies the gift, Mat. 23-19.
Now those other Priests offered upon an Altar of earth, or earthly substance,
Exodus 20.24 But what is the Altar on which this High Priest offers this
excellent gift, that is greater then it, and sanctifies it? surely this can be
no other, but the Divine nature which is greater then the Humane; In respect of
which Humane, clad with our Infirmities he said; The Father is greater then I,
John 14.28. And by the power of this Divine nature he was supported in, and
through his sufferings Esa. 50.1-9. Raised from the dead -- Romans 4.24. and 6.4.
Ascended to heaven, Act 5.30.31. And offered himself to God: And so it is
expressly said, Heb. 9.14. he through the eternal spirit offered himself
without spot to God. And thus also was God manifested in the flesh, Justified
in the Spirit etc. 1 Timothy 3.16. And so by ransom of the union of the humane
nature, with the Divine in the person of the Son of God, one Christ, God-man;
This Blood, and Sacrifice, if it be rightly understood, may be truly called the
Blood, and Sacrifice of God, Act. 20.28. found by God, Job. 33.24. And offered
by God unto God, according to the will of God, though it was the Body, or
humane nature offere: for men: And this does sanctify, and dignifie the
offering, that it is of Infinite value and prevalency, Heb. 10.5-10-19. etc.

2 In respect of the Declaration, and appearance of this precious Blood, and
Sacrifice; And so of Christ, that by the eternal Spirit has offered it to God
for men, and received the same spirit to apply to men, and his gracious ends in
both the faithful, and plain declaration of this by such as by spirit have
received it, and as the Spirit has taught them, 2 Cor. 4.4.6. 1 Cor. 2.12.
Romans 12.3. Mat. 28.20. Declares this Precious Blood, and Sacrifice to be of
great excellency, worth, and Dignity: In that in such declaration (as he
promised.)

1 The holy Spirit comes along, and shows, and testifies of these things of
Christ, John 15.26. and 16.14. and manifested the savor of his Knowledge, 2
Cor. 2.14.15. And goes to the heart of men that they might believe, John 1.7.
Romans 10.7, 8, 9, 10. And writes the mind of Christ in the Believer, 2 Cor.
3.3. and 13.3 5. So that in the hearing of this Doctrine, and Object of Faith,
and in no Doctrine, or observation of any law of works, the Spirit of Christ
comes, and testifies, and is received, Gal. 3.1-5.

2 The free grace, and abundant love of God to mankind in the gift of his Son.
To be a ransom for all men, 1 Timothy 3, 4, 5, 6. And the Savior of the world,
And the propitiation for their sins, 1 John 4.10.14. That whosoever believes
on him might not perish, but have everlasting life, John 3.17. And his
acceptance of his Son for men, and taking his wellpleasednesse in him, Mat.
3.17 2 Cor. 5.14. Heb. 10.1-12. His filling him for men, Psalm. 68.18. Esa.
41.1. His readiness to receive in, and through his Son, and that his Son
shall give eternali life to all that in his Discovery, see, and believe on him
John 6.40. and 1.12. yea, even his peculiar, and delightful love, and well
pleasednesse in his Son, and all that by grace are made one in his Son, John
15.9. and 16.27. All this appears (and as living water streameth) In the
Declaration, and appearance of this Precious Blood, and Sacrifice, as it was
offered to God, And is applied to the heart, Romans 3.24 25. 1 John 5.6-12.13.

3 The great, and complete salvation, redemption, reconciliation,
Propitiation, and righteousness that is in him, and which he is become, which
by himself, 1 Pet. 2.24. 1 Cor. 15.3.4. Romans 4.25. 1 John 2.2.
and in his own Body he has wrought in dying and shedding his Blood for our
sins, and riseing for our Justification; And through the eternal Spirit
offering himself a spotless and unvaluable Sacrifice to God, in which he has
made Purgation of our sins, slain enmity, obtained eternal redemption, and
made such satisfaction in heaven, that he has thereupon received life to
dispense to men, Heb. 1.3. and 9.12.14. and 10.1-12. And the power, and
fitness of the same Precious Blood, and Sacrifice by the Holy Spirit applied
to the heart, to purchase, redeem, and reconcile to God from among men, and to
wash, purge, and renew the heart, etc. Act. 20.28. Ren. 1.5. and 5.9. Heb.
9.14. Tit. 3.4.5. And so work Salvation in men. All this appears in this
Doctrine, or plain faith-and spiritual Declaration of this Precious Blood,
and Sacrifice, so as therethrough from the threefold witness in heaven that
are one, there come these three on earth to men, the Spirit, and the water, and
the Blood, 1 John 5, 6, 7, 8-12. By all which this Blood, and Sacrifice
appears of infinite Excellency, and Dignity.

4 In respect of the rich, free, bright, and abundant love appearing in this
Sacrifice of the Son of God, for as it was the love of God to give his Son,
etc. as aforesaid; even so in all that he does to us, in mercy for his Sonns
sake, his love and goodness appears therein, Psalm. 136. And his goodness is
his glory, Exodus 33.18.19. and so:

1 His love, mercy, and goodness appears in this, that by Christ, and for
his sake, the earth, and the Inhabitants thereof are upheld, the Sunn to shine,
etc. continued, mercy shown, etc. All witnessing his goodness, and leading to
repentance, as is foreshewn, and so it is said, Psalm. 19. The heavens declare
the glory of God, etc. And thus, all his works praise him, Psalm. 145.8.9.10.
And thus for Christ his sake, his love, and glorious goodness appears to all
in his works.

2 Yet his love, mercy, and goodness, did more specially appear to Israel, in
giving them his Oracles, his Covenant, and Ordinances, and though but in
Promises, Prophesies, and Tipes of Christ, as then yet to come; yet his glory
appeared therein, and such special love, as it might then be truly said, he
had not dealt so with any Nation, Romans 3.2. and 9.4. Psalm. 147.18.

3 But now in this giving, and setting forth his Son, who has come, and dyed
for our sins, and with the virtue of his own Blood entered the heavens, and
offered himself a Sacrifice to God, and received Spirit, and sending him forth
in the word of Salvation which himself wrought, and first began to preach, and
so God speaking to him by his Son, who is the brightness of his glory, and
the express Image of his Person, Heb. 1.2.3. and 2.3. The wisdom of God, and
the power of God; yea, wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption
to them that believe, 1 Cor. 1-24.30. In which face of Christ, the light of the
Knowledge of the glory of God, yea, his face shines, and is beheld, 2 Cor. 4
6. and 3.18. Oh the Infiniteness of the Breadth, Depth, length, and height of
this love of God, appearing herein! Ephesians. 3.18.19. In which still the
Excellency, and Dignity of this Sacrifice appears.

4 In respect of the great hope this Precious Blood, and Sacrifice gives, and
engendereth in all that in believing receive the same: as.

1 Remission of sins, and acceptance into favor, and peace, Act. 10.43. Romans
5.1.2.

2 Purgation of Conscience, and Sanctification of the whole man, Heb. 9.14.

3 Seasonable victory over all enemies, and Temptations, 1 John 5.4.6. Romans
16.20. 1 These. 5.24.

4 The Holy Spirit to teach, guide, and conform to Christ, and so bring to the
Kingd ome, and inheritance, John 14.26. and 16.13.14. 1 Pet. 1.5.

5 And to say all in one word, eternal life, 2 Pet. 1, 23. 1 John 2.25. All
which show forth the Excellency, and Dignity of this Precious Blood, and
Sacrifice of Christ, besides the virtue, and power now to be spoke of.

CHAP. 8.
Of the virtue, operation, and prevalency of this Precious Blood, and Sacrifice
of Jesus Christ: And first. As offered to God.

THE virtue, operation, and prevalency of the Blood, and Sacrifice of Jesus
Christ is very great; so as that which was prophesied concerning him, is and
shall certainly be fulfilled; Esa. 53. When thou shall make his Soul an
offering for sin, He shall see his seed (so great a Generation, as none of us
can declare) He shall prolong his days (live ever, and cause his seed to live
for ever with him) And the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hands (his
works, and Judgments acceptable, and prosperous.) He shall see the Travel of
his Soul (even be the Lord of all, and be acknowledged Lord by all.) By his
knowledge shall my righteous Servant justify many (even all that believe on
him through his teaching.) And this is the ground; for he shall bear their
iniquity, therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall
divide the spoil with the strong (he shall have the Kingdom, and be the
judge, and give to each, their portion, and Doom.) Because he has powered out
his Soul unto Death, etc. All which is true in Christ, who is the truth; And
in a measure true too, and in all that believe on him, and shall one day
appear true to all men, 1 John 2.8. Phil. 2.7-11. And that the Truth of the
virtue, Power, and Prevalency of this Precious Blood, and Sacrifice of Christ,
may be rightly and profitably understood, and believed by us; let us consider
what is said thereof by the Spirit of truth, in the Scripture or word of Truth,
concerning the virtue, power, and Prevalency of this Precious and Sacrifice of
Christ.

1. As it was presented and offered to God: 2. As grace is therethrough shown
and tendered to men. 3. As it is spiritually applied to, and works in, the
hearts of those that through grace believe. 4. And as he testifies, and
exercises the power of it upon them that have persisted in obstinacy, and
refusing to believe. In all which its power and prevalency does appear, and
shall by all men be one day confessed.

1. As this precious Blood and Sacrifice was presented and offered to God; it
has so verily and mightily prevailed with him, that he has obtained and
received of the Father the first, next, and immediate end of his suffering and
Sacrifice; and also the Father has filled and fitted him for the second
ultimate and utmost end of his suffering and sacrifice. In both which, the
prevalency and effectualnesse thereof with God for men, is evident and
manifest: let be considered,

The first, next and immediate end of the suffering and Sacrifice of Christ, was
to work a salvation for mankind with God. And that himself might be the Lord,
the Savior, and the Judge, John 3.17. Romans 14.9. 1 John. 4.14. Psalm. 2 9. And
this first end contains, and may be comprehended in these particulars:

1. To put, or take away sin, even the sin of the world (that was in the way
between God and mankind, out of the way) by the sacrifice of himself, Heb.
9.26. Joh. 1.19. 1 John 3.5, as is fore-shewne, That so he that was made sin,
and a curse for all, might himself in the room of all, be justified as the
public man, with such a full and fruitful justification, that all may be so
farie justified in him, that whosoever of them are by his grace and Spirit,
brought in believing to be one in, and with him, shall also in their own
particular persons be justified in, with, and through him, Ephesians. 2.4. -- 10.
Joh. 3.15.16. Acts 10.43. And has not his Blood and Sacrifice offered to God,
prevailed with God for, and effected all this? does not the Spirit in the
Scripture affirm plainly and expressly, 1 John 3.5. In him is no sin, Heb. 1.3?
And that when he had by himself purged our sin, he sat down on the right hand
of, etc. with Heb 11.12? And does not God affirm him to be the just, 1 John
2.1? and the holy one, verse. 20? and his righteous servant, that by his
knowledge shall justify many, Isa. 53.11. And says not the Scripture
expressly, Romans 3.23.24.25? All have sinned, and come short of the glory of
God? being justified freely through his grace, through the redemption that is
in Jesus Christ, which God nath set forth to be the propitiation, through faith
in his blood for the remission of sins? And Romans 5.18. As by the offense of
one unto all men to condemnation, even so by the righteousness of one unto all
to justification of life. And then it follows as the fruit of this, verse. 19.
For as by the disobedience of one, many were made sinners, so by the obedience
of one many shall be made righteous; so is he justified, so has he by
sacrifice prevailed.

2. To remove, stay, and take away the enmity that (by reason of sin and death
entered and the dominion of the law) was between God and man in the very way,
and in the state and condition of mankind, standing as a partition, and Iron
Bar, to keep God from showing mercy to men, and men from any passage of coming
in to God. The removing of this was one end of the suffering and sacrifice of
Christ, as also the enmity occasioned between Jews and Gentiles, by the Law of
Ordinances, in rites and sacrifices, and so to make peace. And so it is
expressly said of his sufferings and sacrifice, Isai. 53.5. The chastisement of
our peace was upon him; and 2 Cor. 5.19. God was in Christ reconciling the
world to himself. And of his prevalency for this with God for men, does not the
Spirit in the Scripture affirm, Psalm. 85.10. Mercy and truth are met,
righteousness and peace have kissed; and that he, Col. 1.20. has made peace
through the blood of his cross, and Ephesians. 2.13-16? Now in Christ Jesus ye who
sometimes were far off, are made nigh by the blood of Christ; for he is our
peace, who has made both (those mentioned verse 1, 2, 3) one, and has broken
down the middle wall of partition between us, having abolished in his flesh the
Law of Commandments in ordinances, for to make in himself of twain one new
man, so making peace. And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by
the cross, having slain the enmity thereby or in himself. And this preceding
peace-preaching; and ye are become dead to the Law by the body of Christ, Romans
7.4. who has abolished death, 2 Timothy 1.10. and taken out of the way all that
was contrary to us, Col. 2.14. and so is affirmed to be (1 John 2.2.) the
Propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only, but also for the sins of
the whole world; such his prevalency with God.

3. To redeem and buy all of God, that they might not perish its that necessity
of perishing into which they had sold themselves, nor be judged to eternal
death by and according to that Law, under which they were fallen, nor carried
away by the Devil as their rightful Lord, by virtue of his first conquest
over mankind. But that they all might be released, and given over to his own
dispose, and so he be the Lord of all, as it is said, Romans 14.9. For to this
end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be the Lord both of
the dead and living. And so effectual was his sacrifice, and such the
prevalency of it with God for men in this respect, that he is affirmed to have
bought even those that deny him, 2 Pet. 2.1. And on this ground it is said,
whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lords, Romans 14.8. And he is Lord
of all, Acts 10.36. Yea God has made this same Jesus both Lord and Christ,
Acts 2.36. And in this particular end, many particular ends, as branches
thereof are included, for which also he has prevailed. As to instance some.

1. That he might uphold and preserve the earth, and the inhabitants thereof,
and the heavens for them till the end come: In which he has prevailed, and so
it is said, Psalm. 75.3. The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are
dissolved; I bear up the pillars of it, Col. 1.17. And by him all things
consist. And Heb. 1.3. He upholdeth all things by the word of his power, when
he had by himself purrged our sins, etc.

2. That he might for the time of this natural and dying life, remove and take
off from men so much of that sorrow, weakness, pains, and cursed terrors,
which the falling into sin did necessitate to be on men, as in his love and
wisdom he sees fit. And in this also he has prevailed, and so it is said,
Acts 17.28. In him we live, and move and have our being, Psalm. 145.8. The Lord
is gracious and full of compassion, slow to anger, great in mercy, The Lord is
good to all, and his tender mercies are over all his works, verse. 9.

3, That he might exercise patience, show mercy, and use such means as he
pleases to move and lead men to repentance, and seeking after him, and
submission to him, and in this also he has prevailed, and so it is said, John
1.4.5. In him was life, and the life was the light of men, and the light
shines in darkness, 2 Pet. 3.9. The Lord is patient and longsuffering to
usward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to
repentance, Romans 2.4. The goodness of God leads thee to repentance, Acts
14.17. and 17.26.27. that they should seek the Lord, and live to him, Romans
14.7.8. 2 Cor. 5.14.15.

4. That he may rule over all, and dispose of their ways, conditions, and
trials, etc. And in this also he has prevailed; and so the Father in
approbation of his Sacrifice, said, Ask of me and I shall give thee the Heathen
for thine inheritance, and the utmost parts of the earth for thy possession,
etc. Psalm. 2.8.9. And himself says, All power is given unto me in heaven and
in earth, etc. Matthew. 28.18. And the Spirit in the Scripture says, Psalm. 66.7.
He rules by his power for ever, Psalm. 103.19. And his Kingdom rules over all.

5. That after the end of this life he may raise all men from the first death,
and make them alive, and set them before him, that they may bow to him, and
acknowledge him Lord, to the glory of God. And in this also he has prevailed;
and so the Spirit in the Scripture says, 1 Cor. 15.21.22. since by man death,
by man also the resurrection from the dead: For as in Adam all die, so in
Christ shall all be made alive. And himself says, Joh. 12.32. And I, if I be
lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me. And even because of his
obedience in suffering, it is said, Phil. 2.9.10.11. wherefore God also has
highly exalted, and given him a name which is above every name, that at the
name of Jesus every knee should bow, etc. And that every tongue shall confess,
that Jesus is the Lord, to the glory of God. And so David confessed and
prophesied, Psalm. 86.9. All nations whom thou have made, shall come and worship
before thee, O Lord, and shall glorify thy name. Thus must all come before him
one day, and then he shall separate and dispose of them, Matthew. 25.32, 33.

4. Another particular end in this first, next, and immediate end of the
suffering and sacrifice of Christ offered to God, was, That he might show
forth to men this rich and abundant grace. Ephesians. 2.4.7. And so it was,

1. That this full Gospel, and therethrough repentance and remission of sins,
might be preached in his name among all Nations, Luke 24.46.47, And for this he
has prevailed, so as himself came and preached peace, Ephesians. 2.17. And first
began to preach the Gospel of this salvation himself, Heb. 2.3. and then left
the commission for preaching the same unto his Apostles and faithful Disciples
that by grace come to be united to him, and endued with spiritual gifts, John
17.18-21. 2 Corinthians. 5.18.19.20. 1 Pet. 2.3. -- 9. And left his charge to
preach it to all Nations, Mat. 28.19, 20. Mark 16.13.

2. And also that by his laying down his life in witnessing to the truth of the
Gospel he taught, and the Fathers acceptance of his sacrifice, the truth of the
Gospel might be confirmed for all that hear it, that they might believe, John
18.37. 1 Timothy 6.13. And in this also he has prevailed; and so it is said, he
spoke the truth which he heard of God, John 8.45. And the Apostles have said.
They spoke the words of truth, Acts 26.25. and that with great plainness of
speech, 2 Cor. 3.12. by manifestation of the truth, 2 Cor. 4.2.5. for says
Peter, 2 Pet. 1.16. We have not followed cunningly devised Fables, when we made
known to you the power and coming of the Lord Jesus Christ; but were
eyewitnesses of his majesty: for he received from the Father honor and glory,
when, etc.

3. And also that himself might be the prime motive, and example to us for
faith, and love, and walking in both conversation, and ministration in patience
and meekness through sufferings in hope to the death, 1 Pet. 2.21. John
13.1-15. And in this also he has prevailed, so as himself points to himself
for the prime motive and example, Joh. 15.12 --.20. And the Spirit in the
Scripture sets him forth to us for motive and example, Col. 3.12. -- 14. and
bids us look to him, and consider him, Heb. 12.2-7. and follow him, Ephesians. 5.1.2.

4. Yea and that he might ratify the New Testament of precious promises for
all that in the heavenly call are brought in to believe in him, that they
through the Spirit may wayt for the same, through faith, Heb. 9.14.15.16.
Matthew. 26.28. In which also he has prevailed, as Heb. 9.15. shows, with Gal.
3.15. -- 26. and 5.5. And so the whole Gospel is by the blood and sacrifice of
Christ confirmed and sealed for truth.

5. That he might also having life in himself, quicken whom he will, and so
give eternal life to all that believe on him, and leave, and give up such as
will none of his counsel and so persist in refusing to believe on him. In
which also he has prevailed, John 1.17. and 3.18.19 and 5.20.28. and 6.37.40.

6. That he may at the last judge all men according to the Gospel which himself
first began to preach, and then gave his servants to preach. And in this also
he prevailed, as is evident in that himself said, John 12.48. He that
rejects me, and receives not my words, has one that judges him; the word
that I have spoken the same shall judge him at the last day. And his servant by
the spirit said, Romans 2.16. In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men
by Jesus Christ, according to my Gospel. And so it is said of God, Acts 17.31.
He has appointed a day wherein he will judge the world in righteousness by
that man whom he has ordained, whereof he has given assurance (or offered
faith) unto all men, in that he has raised him from the dead. And so as Romans
14.9. to this end he both died and rose, and revived, that he might be the Lord
of both dead and living. So it is affirmed on that very ground, verse. 11, 12.
and 2. Cor. 5.10. We must all appear abefore the judgment seat of Christ, etc.
yea and such as come then to be condemned by him that so died for them, and
offered himself a Sacrifice and ransom for them; and used mercy and extended
means to call them to repentance, are charged with sin for that they have
not believed, John 16.8.9. and that they have trodden under foot the Soon of
God, counted the Blood of the Covenant wherewith they were sanctified, an
unholy thing, and offered despite to the Spirit of grace, at least that he
called and they refused. Heb. 10.29. Prove. 1 24. And this shall be their
condemnation, light came, and they loved darkness rather, John 3.19. They by
following lying vanities, have forsaken their own mercies, Iona 2.8. And lost
their own souls, Matthew. 16.26. And by denying the Lord that bought them,
brought upon themselves swift destruction, 2 Pet 1. and so are rightly called,
Jude 12
Frees twice dead. And the destuction and torment into which they shall be
cast, is called the second death, Rev. 20 6.14.

And thus mightily and verily has the precious Blood and Sacrifice of Christ
offered to his Father, prevailed with God, so as indeed Jesus Christ has
thereby put away sin, abolished death, removed enmity out of the condition of
mankind, bought all men of God, and obtained eternal redemption; so as he is
become the Lord of all, and has remission of sins, and life to dispense. And
through him the earth is upheld for men, mercy showed to, and means used
toward them to draw them to repentance, and faith, and they all given of God
into his dispose, and he has power and shall raise them all from the dead, and
judge them all according to the Gospel, such as have in believing been brought
to him, and abidden in him in the day of grace, he will sentence to eternal
life; and such as have through the day of grace persisted in refusing him, or
departing from him, he will sentence to a second death. And that men might have
knowledge hereof, and faith herein, to bring them in to him, and confidence to
abide in him, and be left excuselesse in their refusal; he has also sealed
and confirmed the Gospel for a certain truth, in the report of the
Propitiation, and life on believing for all men, and the New Testament for
believers. And all this true, whether men believe it, or no. And so far has
the sacrifice, as offered to God, prevailed: and yet further in his having a
fitness for that to be after said. And in respect of all hitherto said, the
light shines in the darkness, but the darkness comprehends it not, John
1.5.

7. And now to remedy this also, that the light may be seen and known through
the means used, there is yet another end of his Sacrifice offered; namely, that
he might fit at his Fathers right hand, and receive and be filled with the
holy Ghost in our nature glorified to send forth to the sons of men, and to
fill and lead his people: and so to be as in his own place, a reprover of the
world, and an advocate and comforter of his people. Himself when he was in the
world, did testify of it, That the works thereof were evil, John 7.7. And he
declared himself the Bread of life, John 6. the Son of God, and Door of the
sheep, John 10. yea the Way, the Truth, and the life, John 14.6. and did teach
his Disciples and keep them, and manifest his Fathers Name and Words to them,
John 17.6, 7, 8. and he being in that estate, and manner of ministration not
long to abide in the world, did promise to send them another Advocate and
Comforter to be in his stead with them for ever, Ioh. 14.16. and that this
holy spirit should bear witness of him. John 15.26. and convince for reprove
the world, John 16.8, 9, 10, 11. and guide his Disciples into all truth, John
16.13. mind them of his sayings, teach them all things, John 14.26. etc. yet
even when while Christ in his own personal body was in the world, he told this
for truth unto his Disciples, John 16.7. It is expedient for you that I go
away, for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you. But if I
depart I will send him unto you. And when he promises such portion of Spirit,
it was at that time said, The H. Ghost was not yet given, because Jesus Christ
was not yet glorified. John 7.39. Now in his ascending and offering himself in
Sacrifice to God for men, he has prevailed for this also, as appears in that
is said, Psalm. 68.18. Thou have ascended on high, thou have led captivity
captive, thou have received gifts in the man (that is in the humane nature, and
for men, to give gifts to men, Ephesians. 4.8.) yea the rebellious also that the Lord
God might dwell among them. And so where there was a performance-evident and
eminent, in visible descent, and divine operation through some to the
convincement of many, and drawing in many, Acts 2. totum. It is said, This
Jesus has God raised up, whereof we are all witnesses; therefore being by the
right hand of God exalted and having received of the Father, the promise of the
H. Ghost, he has shed forth this which ye now see and hear: and so the Spirit
of the Lord does rest on him, Isai. 42.1. and he is anointed with it, to
preach good tidings, etc. Isa. 61.1, 2, 3, 4. So that as himself has made
peace. so he has received Spirit to preach, and give peace, Ephesians. 2.14.16.17.
As he has procured means to be used to call men; so he has received Spirit
to send forth according to the means to breath and operate secretly therein
toward, and with men, Genesis 6.3. to enlighten every man, John 1.9. to manifest
the being and goodness. of God to them, Romans 1.19. to reprove their evils,
Pro. 1.23. to lead to repentance, Romans 2.4. that they might seek and find God,
Acts 7.26. and he opens his words and gives his Spirit to to them, Pro. 1.23.
And as he has himself preached the Gospel, and confirmed the truth of it with
his blood, and left it with his servants to minister; so he has received, and
is filled with Spirit immeasurably, Ioh. 3.34. to send forth in the
ministration thereof, to cenvince the world, Ioh. 16.8, 9. to bring down every
high thought, 2 Cor. 10.4.5. to discover grace to men that they might believe,
Ioh. 1.7. and come to Christ, Isai. 55.5. to purge the consciences of
believers, Heb. 9.14. and witness their sonship, Romans 8.16. And as he has
shed his blood, and presented himself with the virtue of it, in offering
himself a sacrifice to God for men, and so made a purgation of sins, and
wrought salvation, and righteousness, and obtained eternal redemption for
men; so he has received an office, and spirit at his Fathers right hand to
offer and call men to to the receite of the same, Pro. 8.4.7. Esa. 45.22. And
by the same spirit to apply the same grace, sprinkle the virtue of the same
Blood, and Sacrifice on such as believe, to wash, cleanse, sanctify, and
conform them to himself therewith, Esa. 61.1-5. Ephesians. 5.25.26. whence they
that come to Jesus are said to come to the Blood of sprinkling Heb. 12 24. And
to say in a word: As himself is the gift of God, John 4.10. and full of grace,
and truth, John 1.14. and eternal life is in him, and given us in him, that
whosoever has him has it, 1 John 5.10.11.12. So is he filled with the
abundance of spirit, to discover, and dispense this gift, grace, truth and
eternal life, Esa. 42.1-8. and 61.1-4. whence also, grace, mercy, and peace,
are mentioned for the Holy Ghost, coming down from the Father, and the Son
discovering, giving to, and effecting in believers, grace, mercy, and peace, as
is seen by comparing, Romans 5.1 5. and 1. John 5.6.7. with Romans 1.7. 1 Cor.
1.3. 2 Cor, 1.2. Gal. 1.3. Ephesians. 1.2. Phil. 1.2. Col. 1.2. And so in all the
Apostle Paul's salutations to the Churches, 2 Pet. 1.2. Rom, 4.5. And so, and in
every respect as a foresaid has the Precious Blood, and Sacrifice of Christ,
prevailed with God for men, and this set forth in the Gospel for men, as a very
truth, yea to, and for such as do not yet believe, but are yet impenitent, and
disobedient; that they might believe, and repent, it being the foundation of,
and Door to repentance, and faith.

And so of the first consideration of the virtue, efficacy, and prevalency, of
the precious Blood, and Sacrifice of Christ, even as it was offered to God, and
has prevailed with God for men. Now let us consider the efficacy in the three
following considerations.

CHAP. IX.
2. Of the virtue, operation, and effectualnesse of this Precious Blood, and
Sacrifice of Christ, As through its prevalency with God, grace, and mercy is
shown, and extended to men and how fit, and forceable to prevail with them.

IT is before shown; that through the prevalency of this Precious Blood, and
Sacrifice of Christ with God for men, mercy is shown, and means is used
toward men; And that though men are so dead in sin, that they have no power,
spirit, or will to discern God, or come into him by these means, yet Jesus
Christ by his Sacrifice has prevailed with God, and received of him in the
humane nature the spirit to send forth in, and according to the means, to
discover the grace procured by his Blood, and Sacrifice, and so to call, and
draw in men to God as is shown; And of the Prevalency of the Blood, and
Sacrifice of Christ with men toward God, in this Discovery of grace by his
spirit, is that here to be noted; not what humane studdies, artificial
knowledge, and forced motives effect, But what by virtue of the Sacrifice of
Christ; the secret, spiritual, and supernatural breathing, and motion of the
spirit of Christ effects in, and according to the means procured by his
Sacrifice; And so.

1 In his manifestation, and Discovery of grace, and mercy in those mercies of
God vouchsafed in his works of creation, and providence continued for Christ's
sake to the sons of men, is effected for, and to men.

1 Some Testimony that God is, Romans 1.19.20. And that notwithstanding men have
sinned, yet he is God, and merciful to them, Act. 14.17. And that he is a
rewarder (that is ready to show favor, and extend mercy) to them that seek
him, Heb. 11.6. And so the heavens declare the glory of God, Psalm. 19. And his
spirit striveth with men, Genesis 6.3. And he calls all, Pro. 8.4.

2 It gives secret reproves of evils found, Pro. 1.23. And secret moveings
to repentance of the evils reproved; And faith in his goodness discovered,
and motions to seek his favor, Romans 2.4. Act. 17.29.30.31. Esa. 45.22.

3 It effects a certain light, and disposition in men, that is some what
more then natural, even an inspiration from the Almighty, giving understanding
to discern something of God, and that with some inclination toward his
goodness, which because it has not got dominion in men, they are yet but
natural, though something be vouchsafed them that is more then natural, by
which a capabillity to hear some of the teachings according to God is for the
time given them, and so it is said, he enlighteneth every man that comes into
the world, John 1.9. And there is a spirit in man, and the inspiration of the
Almighty gives them understanding, Job. 32.8. And the spirit of man is the
Candle, (or Lamp) of the Lord (which he has set up and lighted) searching all
the inward parts of the Belly, Pro. 20.27. and this is the great fault of men
that they take not notice of this mercy, Job. 35.10.11. none says, where is
God my maker, who gives songs in the night, who teaches us more then the
Beasts of the earth, and makes us wiser then the fowls of heaven? And thence
come corrections olso, to hide pride from man, to seal his Instruction, etc.
Job. 33.16-19. to 29-30.

4 To such as do not willingly harden themselves against the reproofs and
speakings of this grace thus far extended, but turn thereby, he makes known
his words, by dreams, visions, or a rumor of the Gospel some way, so as he
works in them, some suitable repentance, and faith, and fear of him, and
merciful affections, etc. leading to himself, as is evident in his own
Testimony, Pro. 1.23. And the examples set before us, Job. 33.13-31. Act. 10.1,
2, 3. All which is the fruit of his free grace through the Sacrifice of
Christ, Romans 11.36. And such as harden themselves against his goodness, are
hereby left without excuse, Romans 2.4.5. And justly given over to wrath, as is
shown, Romans 1.18.24. And so far of the universal efficacy with all men.

2 In, and through the Gospel; when the spirit goes out in discovery of the
Precious Blood, and Sacrifice of Christ: And the grace therethrough procured
for, and tendered to men; the effects and prevalency with men is greater.

1 It begins to effect in all where the spirit does so come in the Gospel, some
reproof, or convincement of the vileness of sin, the emptiness in worldly
things, and the vanity of fleshly righteousness, and also of a fullness, and
sufficiency in Christ, and of sin for not believing on him, and also it
allureth to a love, and likement of the Doctrine of Christ, with some motions
to repentance, faith, and seeking the Lord, John 16.7, 8, 9.10, 11. and
2.23.24. and 6.34. Act. 13.42. and 26.28. And such, continuing in his words are
his Disciples, and shall know the truth, and the truth will make them free,
John 8.31-36. And if here they take occasion to stumble, and oppose, they may
be justly deprived, and given up, Act. 13.39-46. and 28.23-28.

2 It sinketh to the heart, effects farther in many, an inward, and piercing
sorrow for their former vileness, emptiness, and rebellion with weariness of
their old disposition, hopes, and ways, prizings, and longings after union
with Christ, and these desires accompanied with some tastes of his goodness,
and love to his people, Zach. 12.10. Act. 2.37. Nor will he fail or be wanting
to these abideing, to stablish them in due season, Hosea. 6.1.2.3. Esa. 61.1,
2, 3, 4. And when thus far brought; to depart from him cannot be less then
wilful sinning Heb. 9.26-29. And yet is this a common salvation where the
Gospel is believed.

3 This discovery of grace, and operation thereof abidden in, does yet proceed
farther, enabling the heart to part with its former hopes, and purposes, and to
believe in Christ: So as it receives remission of sins; And has the
beginnings of Confidence with love of the Brethren effected; And these are
believers, partakers of the heavenly Call, Romans 3.24.25. and 5.1. Heb. 3.1.6.
To whom that hope is now given, Heb. 14. and 9.15. And now in such a believer
so excellent is the force of this appearing grace, that it works an effect
like that mentioned, Phil. 3.7.8.9. And so in this second consideration, we see
a little of the virtue, and efficacy of the Precious Blood, and Sacrifice of
Christ, and its prevalency with men, as the knowledge of grace therethrough is
given to men; In which is discovered in the Gospel a heavenly motive, and cord
of love to call, and draw to Christ.

CHAP. 10.
3. Of the virtue, operation, effectualnes, and prevalency of the precious
Blood and Sacrifice of Christ, as it is spiritually applied to, sprinkled on,
and working in the heart of those, who through grace, are brought in to believe
in Christ.

When Jesus Christ by his Spirit discovering his grace, has brought on the
heart to believe on him, then does he by the same Spirit, mind them of,
instruct them in, and apply to them the virtue of his precious Blood and
Sacrifice, and the rich and free grace appearing therethrough: and so with the
spiritual shines of grace, and application of his Blood, and streaming in his
love, does he sprinkle and wash, and cleanse them, etc. So it was prophesied,
Ezekiel. 36.24.25. Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be
clean from all your filthiness, and from all your Idols will I cleanse you,
etc. And so it is affirmed of his love to the Church, that he gave himself for
it, that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water, by the
Word, Ephesians. 5.26. And it is testified of believers, of whom some had been
notoriously evil, But ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are
justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God, 1 Cor.
6.11. and so they have confessed of Christ, Rev. 1.5. He has loved us, and
washed us from our sins in his own blood. Whence all that by faith come to
him, are said to come to the blood and sprinkling, Heb. 24. And of the virtue,
power, efficacy and prevalency of this precious hlood and Sacrifice of Christ,
in and with believers, when in their believing it is thus spiritually applied,
it is that in this consideration we have to take notice of, and it is already
in some measure shown: which may be here recalled. And so 1. It verily and
indeed crucifieth the flesh, with the affections and lasts. Whence they that
believe are said to have done it, Gal. 5.24. It breeds inward sorrow for, and
loathing of ones sinfulness, Zach. 12.10. and takes down pride, breeding a low
estimate of ones self, as the sinner and cursed one for whom Christ was made
sin, and a curse, 2 Cor. 5.21. 1 Timothy 1.13.14 and it makes all worldly and
Pharisaicall excellencies appear contemptible, Phil. 3. 7, 8. and makes dead
to sin, Romans 6.4.11. and saves from the pollutions that are in the world
through Lust, 2 Pet. 1.4. and 2.20. 2. It also verily speaks, and gives
peace, yea even the peace of God, which passes understanding, and that will
keep and guard the heart and mind in Christ, Heb. 12.24. Romans 5.1, 2, 11. Phil.
4.7. And so freeth from the Law of sin and death, Romans 7.24.25. and 8.2. 3.
It verily redeemeth and purchases from among men to God, so as i^ prevails
with the believer to be the Lords; and for the Lord, and so makes him of one
mind with God and Christ, Acts 20.28. Rev. 5.9. and 1 Cor. 2.16. 4. It washes,
comfort, and renews the heart, and all the powers to be conformable to
Jesus Christ, Tit. 3.4.5. 2 Cor. 3.18. 5. It firmeth the heart in confidence in
Christ, and expectation of his giving in Spirit, according to his Promise, to
teach, comfort, preserve, and guide into all truth, Romans 5.5. -- 10. Gal. 5.5.
Romans 8.32. Gal. 2.20. 6. It inflameth with love to God and Christ, 1 Pet. 1.8.
1 John 4.19 and moves love to men, 2 Cor. 5.14.15.19. and especially to
brethren, 1 John 4.21. and 5.1. And in this charity it springs up joy,
patience, etc. Gal. 5.22.23. 7. It fits and makes ready to beat the reproach of
Christ, and to suffer for him and his people, 1 John 3 16. Rev. 12.11. 8. It
saves from falling, and gets victory in temptations, 1 Cor. 15.1-14. 9. It
preserves from vain glory, and makes fruitful in good words and works to
glorify Christ, Phil. 2.1.3. and 1.20.21. John 15. 10. It breeds humble and
great boldness to approach to the throne of Grace, and have access to God,
Heb. 4.16. and 10.19. 1 John 2.1.2. Romans 5.2. Ephesians. 2.16. 11. It fits the heart
for a sweet, humble and profitable receipt of spiritual visits, and
entercourses of love, and a profitable use in venting them seasonably. 1 Timothy
1.13. -- 16. 2 Cor. 4.7. -- 13 and 12.1. -- 10. 12. It leads to a holy use of
all Gods Ordinances, Creatures, and dealings with us, Heb. 10.12-24. 1 Timothy
4.4.5. Romans 8.32-36. 13. It prepares to enter through sufferings into glory,
and seals to the same, 2 Timothy 2.11, 12. 2 Cor. 1.5. Rev.. 14.15.


And these and such like are the efficacies of the spiritual application of
the precious Blood and Sacrifice of Christ, which efficacies are in believers,
and in none else, what ever appearances any frame to themselves.

CHAP. 11.
4. Of the virtue and operation of this precious Blood and Sacrifice of Christ,
upon them that have perished in Obstinacy, and refusing to believe.

JEsus Christ is the Son of God, and shall see of the travel of his soul, and
so the fruit of his precious Blood and Sacrifice, even upon them that would
none of him: The Lord Jehovah having in acceptance of his sacrifice given over
all into his hands and set his delight on him, so as all shall submit; and
those that will not willingly, shall yet be subdued to acknowledge him Lord, to
the glory of God, when also the virtue of his Blood and Sacrifice shall reflect
on them (like the heat of the Sun on sore eyes) to afflict them: So as all
his enemies shall be found liers, and made his footstool, Isai. 53.11, 12. Phil.
2.10, 11. Deuteronomy. 33.29. Psalm. 110.1. And this may be evidenced

1. By the greatness of the grace that was procured for them by this precious
Blood and Sacrifice of Christ, and received for them into his hands, to
dispense; as remission of sins, justification, eternal redemption, and life,
Romans 3.24. and 5.18. 1 Ioh. 5.10, 11. And that so verily, that in refusing,
they are by the Spirit that discovered grace through the virtue of this
Sacrifice, said Iona 2.8. to forsake their own mercies, Ma. 16.26. to lose
their own souls, 2 Pet. 2.1. to bring upon themselves swift destruction.

It was great grace at first to make man in the Image of God, and a world of
creatures for him, and to put him in Paradise, and to give him a tree of Life,
etc, and to depart herefrom, and sin against it, a great transgression.

But man fallen, to work redemption for him in such a way, and therethrough to
extend mercy, and means to win him in to partake of it, was much greater
grace; and so greater transgression to turn from it, and abuse the same, and
refuse the offers of it. These are the ungodly indeed in a high degree, 2 Pet.
2.1. Jude 4.5.

2 By the greatness of the wrath this sin provokes, and fire it kindles: It
did deserve death, and provoke wrath, when man first sinned, and fell from God;
but that wrath God executed on his Son in our nature, and herein dying for our
sins, and rising for our justification, and offering himself a Sacrifice to
God for us, has put away sin, and abolished death, and satisfied justice,
and so has appeased that wrath, and quenched that fire, 2 Cor. 5, 19.21. John
1.29. Heb. 1.3. and 9.26. 1 John 3.5. 2 Timothy 1.10. Col. 2.14. 1 John 2.2. It
does deserve death, and provoke wrath, and kindle a fire in judgments on men,
that by the mercies and means, by virtue of the Sacrifice of Christ procured
for, and extended to them men do not seek God, and by repentance and faith come
in to him, to live to him, but still go on after their own lusts, chosing their
own ways, and living to themselves, notwithstanding all his goodness extended
through Christ to them, to lead them to repentance, Act. 14.17. and 17.26-31.
Romans 2.4, 5. But this wrath is appeaseable, and this fire quenchable. And for
such as in the day of their visitation, when Spirit comes forth in the means,
do receive his reproves, and obey his call, and are prevailed with to belief
of his Testimony, repentance of their evils, and faith in his goodness, and
sabmission to him, to live to him; to such this wrath also is appeased, and
fire quenching, and will be altogether, Acts 10.43. Rom 3.25. and 5.1, 2. Isai.
54.1-10: in due season: But when God and Christ by his Spirit in the means
used, and through the redemption and purgation wrought by Christ, has been
visiting, enlightening, moving at their hearts, and striving with them, to
effect repentance and faith in them, and so to bring them to himself; and they
after the knowledge of the truth refuse, resist, or depart from it willingly,
and will none of God, none of Christ, will not be brought in to him this way,
to have all their life and confidence in his grace, and guidance by it; but
persist in their wilful refusal, or Apostasy, till he leave striving, and
give them up to their own lusts, and Satan: This deserves and kindles such
wrath, as will not be appeased, and such a fire as will not be quenched, Genesis 6;
3: Prove. 1.23, 24, etc. Psalm. 81.11. Ezekiel. 24.13. Matthew. 23.37, 38. Heb. 6.4,
5.2 Pet. 2. Jude totu^. And the execution of this is called, The wrath to come.
Luke 3.7. 1 These. 1.10. fire unquenchable, Luke 3.17. Mark. 9.48. hell fire,
Matthew. 18.9. Mark 9.47. the second death, Rev. 20.14.

3 By the greatness and inexcuseable folly, rebellion and filthiness of this
sin, it being an under-valuing, neglect, and refusal of so great salvation
and redemption first obtained, and then first preached by the Lord himself;
yea, a denying him that bought them, and so a treading under foot the Son of
God, Heb. 2.3. 2 Pet. 2.1. Heb. 10.29. a hardening the heart against the
mercies and means that through the precious Blood and Sacrifice of Christ was
procnred for, and extended to them, to lead them to repentance, and so counting
the blood of the Covenant an unholy thing, Romans 2.5. Heb. 10.29. a turning from
him that speaks from heaven and so resisting and offering despite to the
Spirit of grace that strove with them to bring them to God, Heb. 12.25 and
10.29. Act. 7.51. In a word, by their preferring darkness before light, when
light came, John 3.19. exalting their own wisdom, works, and choice, and
objecting, and taking offense at the means, Doctrine, and Spirit of Grace, and
turning from it after it has so far been extended to them; they crucify
again, make of no account and efficacy to themselves the Son of God, and put
him to an open shame, Heb. 6.6. A great ingratitude, and fearful rebellion
against so great and gracious a God and Savior, and Spirit, and so real an
offer and tender, Psalm 81.11. Great folly and madness to refuse so great and
real mercy and salvation and altogether excuselesse, they cannot say we fell
and were loft in Adam, and no redemption was wrought for us, whereby we might
have been saved Our Fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the childrens teeth
are set on edge; Ezekiel. 18.2. Romans 5.12 18.
for the later part of the plea is false, and God will punish it: for though
they were lost in Adam, and could no way redeem themselves, yet in Christ
redemption was again wrought for them: Nor can they say this mercy was
altogether hidd, and no means used toward them, that they might have sought,
and found him, Act. 14.17. and 17.26. nor will this pleasure; we had in our
selves no will or power to choose life; For though it was not in them, yet it
was in him; And his spirit by which he tendered grace wanted not power, Mich.
2.7. He does not look to gather where he has not sown, though wicked
Servants so say; But on his examination they will be dumb, Mat. 25.26. and
22.12. Sins of ignorance, and weakness, to which through the fall men are
necessitated, and for which yet there is a remedy, though they are directly
against the Father, and indirectly against the Son, and holy spirit: sins
against the means procured by Christ, and extended through him to lead to
repentance, and faith, and so against ordinary light, warnings, and motions;
are against the Father, and directly against the Son, yet all manner of these
sorts of sin shall be forgiven unto men, but the wilful and rebellious
sinning in refusing, and opposing the grace it self in Christ, and evidenced
by the spirit, after light obstinately refusing to have all life in, and
guidance by that grace the spirit discovers in Christ; But blaspheming the
same: This sinning is directly against the Father, and the Son, and the Holy
Ghost, and shall never be forgiven, Mat. 12.31. Mark 3.28.29.

4 By the evilnesse, and remedilesnesse of the state, and condition, such
sinning throws these men into; And that may be seen in two things.

1 That whereas they were once dead through Adam; and a ransom was given for
them by Christ, and life procured for them, and this set forth in the Gospel,
and in the means tendered to them with some quickening motions of the spirit,
and hope of life, there being no other means or Sacrifice; They having
wilfully cast aside this, have rent themselves out of this book of life,
renounced this life that was set in hope before them, and are become Trees
twice dead, and plucked up by the roots, so as there is no more hope for them,
Jude 12.

2 That whereas; when they were fallen in Adam, though truth and Justice
pleaded for their Death; yet mercy was for them, and found out a ransom in
which, truth, and justice did meet, and join with mercy nor their good; And
though Justice might have risen against them for their strayings in ignorance,
and unbelief; yet compassion, and mercy had patience, and forbearance to wait
for them, but now by his spirit he has been striving with them, and they will
none of Christ, but harden themselves against him, and oppose, and offer wrong,
and violence to Christ, and his word, and people; even mercy also with Justice,
and truth is turned against them; not that there is any change in God, but they
have put themselves into such a condition, that his mercy becomes cross to
them, the light is pleasant to the eye, and that it troubles the sore eye, the
change is in the eye, not in the light, so Gods love, and mercy is the same for
ever; His delight is in his Son, and his pleasure in his people made one with
his Son: yea, so great that when men harden their hearts against his Son,
the Gospel, and spirit of his Son, and turn to oprresse those that are
vessels of mercy; The more he loves his Son, and the dearer his people are to
him; the more does his mercy move him to plead their cause, and plague their
enemies, and so he smote Egypt, overthrew Pharoh, and his Host in the sea,
smote great and mighty Kings, etc. For his mercy endures for ever, Psalm.
136.10.20. Oh heavy when mercy stands against them!

5 By the greatness of torments, and punishments to be executed on such
sinners; which as the Scriptures sets it forth, is very terrible; for it is the
same that at first was prepared for the Devil, and his Angels, who sinned
freely, and without a Tempter, or any cause, Jude 6. Mat. 25.41. So it appears
that.

1 The Death on mankind for the first transgression was an Allenation from God,
a Death in sin, and a Death in punishments, and torments due to sinnings
against the grace of God manifested in the Creation: And had there been no
remedy, or prevention, this death and punishment would have been eternal; for
men in particular suffering it, could never have overcome it to get out of it
(only by reason of Gods preventing mercy, in keepeing man from cating of that
Tree of life, of which, if he had eaten, his Body had been immortal, and so
capeable of eternal sufferings) He should suffer eternally in his soalc; And
his body with the sting, and povson of sin, and curse should be always
suffering till it turned to rottenness, and so to dust again; and this is the
first death, which came on all men at first, Genesis 2.17. and 3.19. And this
Jesus Christ has in dying for our sins, and riseing for our Justification as
the public person overcome, 2 Timothy 1.10. and obtained of his Father power to
ease men in this life of so much pains of this mortalilty as he pleases, and
to raise them all from this first Death at the last, 1 Cor. 15.21.22.

2 The Death or punishments on men for sinning against the grace of redemption,
in hardening themselves against the Patience and bounty of God, and means
through Christ procured, to lead them to repentance, and so for their turning
herefrom, and going after their own ways; are afflictions, and troubles on
soul, and body, name, and estate, having some mixtures of m^rcy, and being to
hide pride from man, and force them to repentance, etc. Leuit. 26. Deuteronomy. 28.
Job 33. And these are called, wrath, Judgments, punishments, corrections, out
of which yet there is a way, and mean of escape, Job 33. Heb. 1.12. Esa.
27.4.5.

3 But the Death and torment for these that have persisted in in resisting, the
spirit in the means, and refusing this life in Christ, and to have him reign
over them, till they be given over to satan is more terrible, and is eternal,
on soul, and body raised and made immortad, and so capeable of eternal
suffering; And this is called the second death; Hell fire, The lake of fire,
unquenchable fire, and even that which was at first prepared for the Devil,
and his Angels, into which all these shall go, who by their wilful persisting
in rebellion against the truth, and walking in lies, and murders become of the
wicked one, the Children of the Devil, and the seed of the Serpent. And so
shall share of the same punishment, 1 John 3.12. John 8.41.44. Mat. 25.41.
only in the sting and tormenting worm, that never dies, but always
tormenteth, there is now this more to these miserable men, then to the Devils;
The remembrance of a Remedy since their first fall, which they have refused,
which will torment exceedingly, but that cannot be in the Devils torment.

6 And yet there is one thing more, in which appears the effectualnesse of
the Blood, and Sacrifice of Christ, on these rebellious refusers, and that
proves the appearance of the same, to be in all these 5. forementioned points;
And that is the judgment and condemnation of these Rebe's in that.

1 The Lord Jesus Christ that shed his Blood, and offered this Sacrifice, shall
even by virtue thereof be their Judge, even he that dyed, and rose, and revived
for them, to be their Lord, Romans 1.4 9.12. he that bought them, 2 Pet. 2.1.
even he shall be their Judge, and they shall appear before his judgment sear,
2 Cor. 5.10. yea even because he dyed for them, God has exalted him, and they
shall come before him to acknowledge him Lord, by whom they might have been
saved, and shall be judged righteously, Phil. 2.10.11. Esa. 45.23. And of this
God has given assurance, and offered faith to all men in that he raised him
from the Dead, Act. 17.31. And this is one efficacy of his Sacrifice on such as
refused him (in whom they might have enjoyed the comfortable efficacies) that
they shall acknowledge him Lord, and be judged by him, Romans 2.16. 2 Timothy 4.1.
And they shall yield it right, it should be so.

2 That which shall be laid to their charge in this Judgment, and that by
which their sins shall be evidenced, and agravated against them, their sins
that will be laid to their charge will be their ignorance of God, and not
obeying his Gospel, 2 These. 2.8. Their unbelief with all the fruits thereof,
John 16.8.9.10. Their Impenitency, and not profiting by, but hardening their
hearts against the means by the Sacrifice of Christ procured, and extended, to
lead them to repentance, Romans 2.4.5. Their evil thoughts, and hard speeches
of him, and his goodness, in his word, ways, people, Jude 15. and so for
every Idle word, and all their Idolatries, and unmercifulness, and ungodly
deeds, which through their disobedience to his goodness they have runn into,
Jude 15. Mat. 12.36. yea every secret thing shall then be manifest: That by
which the vileness of their sins, and justness of their Judgment shall be
evidenced, will be the put chase Christ has made for them, and they denied him
that so dearly bought them, 2 Pet. 2.1. The mercy extended to them, against
which they hardened themselves, Romans 2.5. And all the means, yea even the
Gospel sent to move them to seek the Lord, Mat. 11.16-24. yea the very blood
and Sacrifice of Christ, by which all the residue was procured for them, which
they have contemned, Heb. 10.29. yea and the Spirit of grace, with all his
spiritual hints of light, motions, reproofs, and allurements which they have
despised, Heb. 10.29. Prove. 1.24.25, etc. All which will then appear as
aggravations of their sin and judgment; and this is another efficacy of the
blood and Sacrifice of Christ, on such as have refused him, that when the day
of grace is past, it will occasion the evidencing and aggravation of their sin
and judgment.

3. The order, rule, law, or medium, by and according to which the judgment
shall proceed, and that is the Gospel; in which Christ had before been set
forth a savior for them, the propitiation for their sins, and full of Spirit
to send forth, and so inviting them to repentance and faith, with assurance of
renovation, remission, and life on believing, and warning that the issue of all
other ways would be death. This Gospel, as it is the word which Christ and his
Apostles spoke; so such is the truth and verity of it, that even the rejectors
thereof; it shall judge, and he shall judge them by and according to it, Joh.
12.47.48 49. Romans 2.16. And this is another efficacy of the precious Blood and
Sacrifice of Christ on such as have rebelliously refused it; that by the
declaration or word thereof, and according to that declaration shall be the
judgment, Romans 1.1.18.20. and 10.18. John 15.22.

4. That which shall convince of sin, and set home the sentence of sin, and
of judgment to the heart, and so kindle the fire that never shall be quenched;
is even the same Spirit of the Lord, which by virtue of his Death,
Resurrection, and Sacrifice, he in his ascension ( Psalm. 68.18.) received; and
in the day of grace was striving with them. Genesis 6.3. to have convinced them,
and began to kindle a fire that the^ would have consumed nothing but their
fleshly affections and lusts, Isa. 40.7. their carnal wisdom and confidence,
and then have healed them and given them life, Pro. 1.23.24 but they would none
of his reproves, but quenched this heat, and resisted this Spirit, till he
left striting with them. But now will this holy and Almighty Spirit from the
Lord that bought them, return again upon them, and contince them of sin,
because they have not believed on Christ etc. John 16.8, 9 10. and so set home
the sentence to their heart, that they cannotavoid it; and by his Almighty
breathing word, like a stream of Brimstone, kindle that fire that never shall
be quenched, Isa. 30.33. And this is another efficacy of the Sacrifice of
Christ on such as have rebelliously refused him; that the Spirit, he, by virtue
of his Sacrifice received to send forth to call men, shall yet set home the
sentence even on those that rejected him.

Oh then in that day, though to their woe, they shall see and confess (what
ever before they thought, or others told them) that Christ died for them,
though they perish; that Christ bought them, though they have denied him; that
he had wrought redemption for them, though they have sold themselves again to
vanity; that there was mercies for them in him, though they forsook them; that
he strove with them, to win them to him, though they resisted him; that his
word and ways were good, though they believed not: And now to behold him that
so dearly bought them, and graciously called them, and they rewarded him with
hatred for his love, to come in fury to judge them, and to perceive the Blood
and Sacrifice that once would have spoken peace to them, to rise up against
them; the Gospel that once declared good tidings to them from the verity of it,
to be a condemning word to them; mercy that once waited for them, to be now
turned against them; the holy Spirit that was once moving in them to draw them
from sin to God, to be now sentencing them under sin, and unto death: O
what a terror will this be! And how will the remembrance of the redemption
wrought by Christ, the mercy once shown, and the door to life once opened,
through which they might have been saved, now add to the terror, and the
remembrance of all the vanities, false Doctrines, and humane applause, for
which they have turned aside, will but increase the vexation, and (now while
they see those that embraced and followed Christ whom they despised, to go
into the joy of their Lord, into eternal life) to see their own sin, and
judgment in the height, and the terrible presence of the Lord driving them
into the lake of fire that burns ever, and out of which there is no escape!
Oh how great this terror! yea how easelesse, how tormenting, how intolerable,
unavoidable, and remediless! How endless will the eternal suffering in that
fire be, when the least drops of those merciful effects of the Sacrifice, that
are in this day tendered, and so refused, will not be vouchsafed; nothing then
but biting, gnawings, torments in every part of soul and body? Now consider
this ye that forget God, Psalm. 50.22. lest he tear you in pieces, and there
be none to deliver.

Those, that know and believe all these forementioned efficacies of the
precious Blood and Sacrifice of Christ, they know also this terror of the Lord,
and they are persuaded and reconciled to God, in belief of the reconciliation
God has wrought in Christ for the world, and they in witnessing the same, do
persuade and beseech others now in this day of grace, to be reconciled to God,
2 Cor. 5.10, 11, 19, 20. and 6.1.2. in which the comfortable efficacies will be
found.

CHAP. 12.
The usefulness of this precious Blood and Sacrifice of Christ, known and
beleevingly remembered.

THat we may have the better understanding of this, it is also to be
understood, 1. Of what the Proposition is. 2. Of what knowing is here meant. 3.
Of what faith it is here to be understood. 4. What remembrance is here meant.
And 5. what is meant by usefulness; that in all we may conceive according to
Scripture sense.

First, for the proposition, It is of the precious Blood and Sacrifice of
Christ, and that is to be understood both of it self primely; and of the
Doctrine of the Gospel in which it is set forth instrumentally: and that as is
before shown; concerning

1. The manifold sense in which those terms are used in Scripture, as for his
Death, His resurnection, His Presentation and offering to God, The prevalency
with God, the spiritual application to believers, and prevalency in them; and
the rich love of God, and satisfaction to God, and conscience and Spirit
appearing and streaming there through, as is shown Chap. 2.

2. The ends of this precious Blood and Sacrifice, and that in respect of
Christ, according to his double Mission into the world, and his double
business in leaving the world; and in respect of mankind according to the
double misery and enmity against God they were fallen into.

And in respect of the Church according to the double need she has of Christ;
and in all of them, the ends of the shedding his blood, the end of his offering
his sacrifice with the virtue of his blood to God, The ends of the discovery
and spiritual application of it to men, as is shown Chap. 3. and 4.

3 The necessity of this precious Blood and Sacrifice, both of his dying, and
resurrection; and of his presentation and offering it to God, and of his
spiritual discovery, and application to men, as is shown Chap. 5. and enlarged
by some consideration of the Law, Chap. 6.

4 The excellency and dignity of this precious Blood and Sacrifice, and that in
the Sacrifice it self, in respect of the Priest, the Sacrifice, the Altar: In
the Declaration, in respect of the three Witnesses, the Spirit, the Water, the
Blood: In the abundant grace, and the great hope appearing therein, as is shown
Chap. 7.

5 The virtue, operation, and prevalencie of this precious Blood, and Sacrifice
of Christ, as it was offered to God, as is shown Chap. 8.

And as through that prevalency with God, mercy is shown to men, as is shown
Chap. 9. And as it is spiritually applied to the heart of Believers, as is
shown Chap. 10. And as it will be laid to the charge of such as have rejected
it, as is shown Chap. 11.

And all this is to be understood about the precious Blood and Sacrifice of
Christ, and in the Doctrine of Christ; and so is the meaning of the Proposition.

2 For the knowledge, or knowing here meant, and of which the Scripture
means, when it speaks of the knowledge, and knowing of Christ, which he
gives to men;

1 It is not that knowledge, or knowing which is natural, Rom: 3.10. and
11.34. Truth it is, that as God through Christ, and for his sake for a time
preserves the natural life of man; so through Christ, and for his sake, he
gives, and preserves unto men for the time of this natural life, their
natural understanding, reason, judgmentaind conception, Job 35.11. Romans 1.32.
By which they may learn and understand some things in the works of God, Job.
36 24, 25. And some things in the Narration, or History of the Scriptures, or
Word of God, Rom: 2.17.21. Luke 10.26, 27. And it is also true, that God has
imprinted and manifested his wisdom, even some testimonies of his being and
goodness in his works of Creation and Providence, Psalm. 19.1-6. Act. 14.17.
Rom: 1.19, 20. and 2.4. And in the Scriptures or Word of God has set forth
Christ the wisdom of God, what he has done, what he is, and what he will do,
and does, 1 Cor. 1.24, Io. 5.39, 46. Rom: 4.23.25. And yet this is also true,
that in respect of all men that are but natural, and have but their natural
life and understanding, though preserved in mercy for Christ's sake; This light
shines in darkness and the darkness comprehends it not. John 1.5. Men by
their natural wisdom do not find out, or attain to know God in the wisdom of
God set forth in the books of Creatures, or Scriptures, 1 Cor: 1.21. The
natural man cannot know the things of the Spirit of God, which he teaches
concerning the things of Christ, because they are spiritually discerned, 1 Cor:
2.14. So that the natural man, with all his natural powers and parts, cannot
attain the right knowledge of the things of God in Christ, by all his search,
either in the Works of God, or in the Word of God, Eccles. 10.15.

2 It is not that knowledge which is both natural, and artificial, attained by
knowledge of Arts, in use of Arts, and artificial helps, whence that
interrogation, and challenge, Isa 33. where is the Scribe? etc. A truth it is,
that through Christ, and for his sake, God blesses men's industly in study of
Letters, Tongues, Arts, and Sciences, that are natural and honest; and also
their honest industry in use and exercise thereof; So as many thereby become
very knowing, wise, prudent, and skillful Orators and Disputers: In study of
the works of God, they may attain excellent knowledge about the variety of
soyles and seasons, the nature of Beasts, Birds, Plants, the nature,
dispontion, and manners of men, and so be very skillful for husbandry, trading,
and merchandise, Government of Commonweales, Isa. 3.1.4.
Laws, War, Physic, etc. And this is a great mercy to a Commonwealth and a
correction to want them: And in study of the Scriptures, such may attain
excellent knowledge, for translation of Tongu^s, understanding and explicating
Histories, discerning of Times and some Proprecies, and of the scope and
circumstances of places, and ety^^ologie of words, which is a mercy to the
Nation where they live (while they keep their bounds;) yea, and to the Churches
also, Matthew. 2.5, 6. Luke 12.54, -- 57, Isa 3.1, -- 4. But yet this is also
true, that the verity, excellency, depth, pretiousnesse, enjoyment, and
efficacy of the things of God in Christ, these Rabbis and Princes of the World
for wisdom and understanding, cannot by this wisdom find out, discern,
approve, or receive, though they read, and study the words in which it is
expressed; yet in those words it is hidden from them, and they by their wisdom
in all their searching cannot find out this mysterious wisdom of God in
Christ, 1 Cor: 1 20.21. and 2.7, 8, 14. Matthew. 11.25. Luke 10.21. So as
natural and artificial knowledge and wisdom cannot reach, or attain the
right knowledge of the things of God in Christ, Prove. 30.2, 3, 4.

So that the knowledge, or knowing here spoke of, is not natural or
artificial, but supernatural, as shall be shown anon.

3 Neither yet is this such a knowledge, or knowing, of which, nature is no way
capable of the receipt of it, or such as does destroy the natural or
artificial knowledge, or as if they could no way consist, and be together in
the same subject, Act. 18.24, 28. and 7.22, 23, Heb. 11.24, 25. The body or
humane nature of our Lord Jesus Christ, neither did, nor could raise it self;
yet was it capable of being raised, and was by the Divine Power not destroyed,
but raised; And yet the resurrection, though it was of the humane nature, yet
it was not at all by the humane, but by the divine nature, the very Spirit and
Power of God, that not the divine, but the humane nature was raised, Act. 2.23,
24, 30, 31. Rom: 4.24. and 6.4. The eyes of blind Bartemeus could by no
natural means attain to see, but they were capable of receiving sight by the
gift of God, Mark 10.46. -- 52. And for the better understanding this
business, we may consider, that it is appointed to men once to dye, Heb.
9.27. Eccles. 9.10. and when they do dye, and give up the Ghost, then all their
natural and artificial knowledge and wisdom dies together with them; And as
they shall be one day raised again by the Spirit and power of Christ; so then
the knowledge they have, shall not be natural or artificial, but only that
which they shall have from the power of God that raised them, 1 Cor. 13.11, 12.
And the members of Christ by virtue of their union with him, shall have all
knowledge tending to happiness from him by the divine nature filling them with
light, and leading both soul and body, 1 John 3.2. So that they shall then
know perfectly and see, as they are seen, and know as they are known; But here
in this life as their bodies, so their natural powers are spiritually humbled
and mortified, that they may in the regeneration be quickened by, Rom 8.10 11,
12.23.
and made serviceable to the Spirit, not annihilated, or slain; nor is the man
perfectly, and totally made alive in the regeneration here wrought, nor will
be, till perfectly and totally dead, in respect of all natural life; but the
Spirit is alive for Righteousness sake, 1 Cor: 13.9. And the Spirit quickneth
also the mortal body, and so he may as pleases him, The natural powers and
faculties, for such service as he pleases: 1 Cor. 1.29.
The to tall redemption of the body, being yet waited for, our knowledge yet
imperfect; so then, though neither natural, nor artificial knowledge, be the
knowledge of spiritual things, nor does, nor can attain it; yet the spiritual
knowledge may consist, and be together with them in the same subject, and
having humbled and slain the pride of them, may make such use of them in some
services as the Spirit pleases; and as it is a punishment or correction during
this life, to have the body by Diseases disabled from service, and tormented
with pain, Deuteronomy. 28.28. so is it to have the natural reason and understanding
made useless, or distracted; So that this knowledge, or knowing here meant, is
not such as slaies, or makes the other altogether useless: As for that doting
upon natural or artificial knowledge, the humane wisdom, or the wisdom of
the Rabbis and Prince; of this world, by which many so magnify it, as the
only, or necessary, or at least the best mean, to find out and discover the
things of God: It is a gross and Idolatrous conceit, and God has executed
judgment on that Idol, and stained the pride of that glory, and so will do
still, in that the wisdom of God is hidden from them, Matthew. 11.25. Luke
10.21. and they know it not, 1 Cor. 2.7, 8 14. And few of them are called to
it, 1 Cor. 1.26. And those that are, have their former wisdom befooled, and
they abased in the acknowledgment of the vanity of it, before they receive the
spiritual wisdom, 1 Cor. 1.19, 20. And the truth is, this magnifying of
humane wisdom and knowledge, is the very enmity of Christ, and the very Spirit
of Antichrist, Mat. 15.4.9. 2 These. 2.4. that moves to the building of Babell
to Idolatry or Superstition, to be as God, in the Temple of God, to appoint
Doctrines, Laws, Officers, and to persecute the Truth, and the Children of the
Truth: As for that saying, that this natural and artificial knowledge, this
humane learning and wisdom, is an Handmaid to Divinity: Though this be but the
Doctrine of men, and no where affirmed in the Word of God, yet if it be rightly
understood, it might by collection appear agreeable thereto; for if it should
be meant an handmaid or help to find out, and attain Divinity, that were rather
to be a Mother then a handmaid, and this is before proved false: And if any
object, in men sanctified, it may, that is also false, Job. 11.7, 8, 9. Prove.
30.2, 3, 4. He that has seeing eyes will not be befooled, to take a candle to
find out the Sun; And again, if by handmaid should be meant a guide, and help,
to limit, order, and better, the teaching of the Spirit, the divine light,
knowledge, and motions of grace, that they may be more profitable and
effectual; this is rather to be a Mist^is then a Handmaid, and if suffered in
this, it would soon corrupt from the simplicity of Christ. Prove. 30.22, 23.
And against this the Apostle has protested, 1 Cor. 2.1, 4, 5. But if by a
handmaid, be meant a handmaid indeed, that which is taken of its Throne, and
submitted to Divinity, even to the Divine Spirit, and grace of Christ, to use
as a Servant according to its pleasure, and divine wisdom, and motion, for
translating etymologizing, and discanting on words, for analyzing places,
comparing places, using Similies, etc. Then if keeping the servants place is
useful, as grace leads to the use of it; And in this sense I conceive some
godly men have used this saying, and where it is so used it may be included in
this saying, Psalm. 103. Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me
bless his holy Name.

4 But the knowledge, or knowing here meant is supernatural, spiritual, and
divine, and that appears in three things that are together in this knowledge,
though distinct, yet never separate in this knowledge, or knowing.

First, that the Giver or Teacher of this knowledge, is the holy Spirit, even
God in Christ, and the Spirit proceedin from both, Prove. 2.6. For the Lord
gives wisdom, and out of his mouth comes knowledge and understanding, Isa
48.17. I am the Lord thy God, which teaches thee to profit, Isa 54.13. All my
children shall be taught of the Lord, John 16.23. When the Spirit of Truth is
come he will guide you into all Truth, and this is in a heavenly manner, as the
Scripture shows.

1 By a divine, not bodily, but spiritual light, shine, or revelation, in
unbaring or manifesting to the soul, or mind, the things of Christ, Heb. 10.32.
In which after ye were illuminated, 2 Cor. 4.6. has shined in our hearts, the
light of the knowledge of the glory of God, Math 16.17. Flesh and blood has
not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven, 1 Cor. 2.10. God
has revealed to us by his Spirit. 2. By a divine infusion, or inspiration to
the heart of a Spiritual stream, motion, or evidence and persuasion of the
truth and goodness of that of Christ discovered, Isai. 44.3. I will power my
Spirit upon thy seed. Job 32.8. The inspiration of the Almigty gives them
understanding. Isai. 30.21. Thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying,
This is the way. Isai. 50.4. The Lord has given me the tongue of the learned
(says Christ) that I should know how to speak a word in season. Isai. 52.6.
They shall know in that day, that I am he that do speak, behold it is I. 3. By
a Divine power or Spiritual strength, so as he causes the blind to see, and
the deaf to hear, Isai. 29.18. and opens the heart to attend, Act. 16.14.
whence he is called, The finger of the Lord, etc. Mat. 12.28. Such is the
Teacher, and teaching, by which this knowledge is attained.
Secondly, the Object of this knowledge, That which the holy spirit teaches,
and glorifieth in teaching, is Christ and the things of Christ, as the verity,
ends, necessity, excellency, and virtue of Christ and his precious Blood and
Sacrifice, the infiniteness and freeness of Gods love appearing therethrough,
and the promises and hope given therein; yea Christ the wisdom of God, and the
power of God, and wisdom, etc. to us, 1 Cor. 1.24.30. John 16.14. He shall
glorify me, for he shall take of mine, and shall show unto you. John 15.26. he
shall testify of me, John 14.26. he shall teach you all things, and bring all
things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you. And so 2 Cor.
3.18. and 4.6.

Thirdly. the manner of knowing is likewise spiritual, and that is both, 1. By
that new light, disposition, and spirit he has put in the heart, which is as a
new and spiritual eye, to see spiritual things, which is not by a humane
discourse, collecting one thing from another, judging to know unseen causes
from some seen and sensible effects, like humane wisdom, and the spirit of the
world; but spiritual discerning in the very light, and of the very evidence of
the Spirit, 1 Cor. 2.12.16. so as they may prove the effects sound from their
knowledge of the cause, 1 John 4.19. So John 1.14. We beheld his glory, the
glory of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth, Psalm. 36.9.
In thy light we shall see light. And in this, as no man's humane wisdom and
learning does further his discerning, so no man's ignorance, or want thereof,
shall hinder, Psalm. 119.130. The entrance of thy word gives light, and gives
understanding to the simple. Matthew. 11.25. Thou have hid these things from the
wise and prudent, and have tevealed them unto Babes. 1 John 5.20. we know that
the Son of God is come, and has given us an understanding, that we may know
him that is true. 2. By a certain inward experience of the beauty, excellency,
and sweet savor of the things known; a pleasing delightful, and reviving taste
and savor, 2 Cor. 2.14 15.16. manifests the savor of his knowledge, a sweet
savor of Christ, a savor of life unto life, Phil. 3.8. For the excellency of
the knowledge of Christ, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and
do count them but Dung, that I may win Christ 1 Pet. 2.3. If ye have tasted
that the Lord is gracious, to whom coming, etc. And this is the knowledge here
meant:


A supernatural and spiritual knowledge of Christ, and the things of Christ
taught by the Spirit of Christ, with light, motion and power, giving an
understanding to discern, and heart to savor the things known. In which
knowledge as there are diverse degrees: so some are but Babes and Novices in it,
and so in respect of some others, unlearned and unskilful in it: others more
skillful; yea some Fathers, and very stable. And this is the knowledge the
Spirit in the Scripture speaks of when it speaks of the things of Christ
and his Spirit. 1 Cor. 2.1. -- 15. 1 Timothy 3.6. Heb. 5.12.13.14. 2 Pet. 3.16.
which whosoever wants altogether, whomsoever he has heard preach the Gospel,
what books soever he has read, and what knowledge soever he has attained in
the Scriptures, what degree, what office, or profession soever he has; yet he
has not seen the image of the Father, nor heard his voice, Heb. 1.3. John
1.14. and 5 37.38. etc. And so knows not the Father nor the Son, nor the
things of the Spirit, nor such as are born of the Spirit, 1 John. 3.1. John
15.21. 1 Cor. 2.12.14.15.16. And so the knowing here meant is supernatural,
spiritual, and experimental, be it little or much, more or less, and so yet
wavering or stable.

CHAP. 13.
3. Of what Faith it is here to be understood, and 4. of what remembrance.

3. FOr the Faith here meant, it is a Divine and Spiritual faith: for the
better understanding whereof, these seven things may be considered about it.
1. The object of it. 2. The Mover or Worker of it. 3. The nature and act of it.
4. The motion in, and of it. 5. The subject in which it is, and immediate
instruments in, and with which it moves and works. 6. The power, life, or
principle in in it. 7. The oneness of it in diversity of the degrees, and acts.

1. For the object that the eye of this Faith is set on, and on which it
looks, to which it runs, on which it leans and rests; This object is
Divine, and but one, even God. In the Lord put I my trust, Psalm. 7.1. and 11,
1. and 121.1. and 123.1. and 9.10. Cant. 1.4.

Yet this object is considerable in a threefold respect, viz.

1. In respect of the most inmost, and utmost object, for refuge, foundation,
and fountain of all help, safety and satisfying, and that is God himself, even
the divine Nature in his infinite wisdom, power, mercy love, truth, etc. Psalm.
42. God our refuge and strength. etc. Psalm. 18.2. Rock, Fortress, Deliverer,
etc. Psalm. 27.1. Light and salvation even God, Romans 4.24. that raised up Jesus
Christ our Lord from the dead, 2 Cor. 1.9.10. which raised the dead, who
delivered, etc. and does deliver, etc, 1 Pet. 1.21. By whom we believed. 1.5.5.
trusts in God, Heb. 2, 13.

In respect of the inmost and absolute Medium, through which this faith
discerns, etc. comes to, and fasteneth on God, and without which there can
be no discerning of, or coming in to God, or closing with him at all. And
this inmost and absolute mediate object, is Jesus Christ the Son of God, made
Man of the Seed of Abraham and David, who is the Savior of the world, and the
Head and Husband of the Church, Romans 1.3.4. 1 John 4.14. John 4.42. Ephesians. 5.32.
and 1.22.23. Christ says, John 14.6. I am the Way, the Truth and the Life, no
man comes to the Father but by me. Ephesians. 2.18. Through him we have both an
access by one Spirit unto the Father, John 1.7. that through him all might
believe, 2 Cor. 3.4. Such trust have we through Christ to Godward. Whence also
this faith is called, Col. 1.4. and 2.5. faith in Christ: and John 3.15.
believing in him. And so Christ Jesus is object of this faith; and that 1. In
respect of what he has done for us, in dying for our sins, and rising for our
justification, and offering up himself a Sacrifice and ransom to God, Romans
4.25. 1 Timothy 2.6. 2. In respect of what he is (through that he has done)
become for us; as namely, that nee is ( Ephesians. 2.14.) our Peace, 1 John 2.2. the
propitiation for our sins, 1 Cor 1.30. wisdom, righteousness,
sanctification, and redemption. Romans 1.3. our Lord and Savior. 3. In respect
also of what (through that he has done, and is become for us) he now does in
heaven for us; and that is, Heb. 9.24. appear in the presence of God for us.
And Heb. 7.25. ever lives to make intercession for us. And so Heb. 9 14.15. 4.
In respect of what he will do in and for all such as through grace believing
in him, accept that he has done, Romans 5.11. and depend on him according to
that he is and does, for that he will do in and for them; as namely, that he
will support and uphold them, Isai. 43.1, 2. and cause all to work together for
good to them, Romans 8.28. and send forth his Spirit from the Father to them, to
bear witness of him to, and through them, John 15.26.27. to mind them of his
words, and teach them all things, John 14.26. to take of the things of Christ,
and show to them, and so glorify him to them, and thereby comfort them, and
lead them into all truth, John 14.14 16. and 16.13.14.15. to make them
fruitful in their ministration, John 15.5.16. convincing the world, John 16.7
8, 9 10. calling in to Christ, 2 Cor. 2.14-16. and 3.3. and answering their
enemies, Matthew 10.20. and to sanctify and preserve them to the inheritance, 1 Thessalonians. 5.24. And thus is Jesus Christ the next and nearest object, and the
only absolute and inmost Medium, through which this faith fasteneth upon God,
or the Divine Nature, which is the most inmost and outmost object.


Thirdly, in respect of the Instrument, and outward Medium, through which
Christ, and so God in Christ, is beheld, believed, and trusted in: and this is
the word of God, that which declares Christ, and Gods love, and gracious mind
in and through him: and so the name or great report, and fame of the glory or
goodness of God in Christ, in his love, mercy, power, wisdom, etc. Whence he
is said to have magnified his word above all his name, Psalm. 138 2. and so this
faith is called, A believing the Gospel, and receiving his words, Mark 1.15.
John 2.22. and 5.47. And so this faith and trust is in praising God in his
Word, Psalm. 56.10. and glorifying his word, Acts 13.48. And so the object of
this faith is, God in Christ, in and according to his word.

The first next Isntrumental and outward mediate object of this faith, is the
word and Gospel, with the promises thereof, which discovers Christ, and God
in Christ, and that, in which, and for which we are to trust in him, Psalm.
119.49.50.

The second inward, inmost, and absolute mediate object of this Faith, is Jesus
Christ, in that which he has done, is become, does, and will do, which the
Word reports and assures, Phil. 3.3.

The last, inmost, and utmost object of this Faith, is God in Christ, in his
infinite wisdom, love, power, etc. which appears in, and through Christ, 1 Timothy 4.10.

And so the object of faith altogether in one, is, God in Christ, as discovered
in his Word by his Spirit. This, and this only is the object of this faith.

So that no Arm of Flesh, or device of men, not multitude of men, Ammunition,
or Forts; not riches, nor strength, nor wisdom, nor any self-wrought
righteousness, or works, can be in any sort the object of Faith, Jer. 9.23.
Job. 9.

1. Either the inmost, and utmost object of faith and trust, God only is that,
Mark 10.24. 1 Timothy 6.17. 2. Or the inmost and absolute mediate object, through
which men believe and trust in God; Christ Jesus is only that, Luke 18.19. 2
Cor. 10.4.7. -- 18. 3. Or the Isntrumental and outward mediate object, through
and according to which, men believe and trust in Christ, and in God in Christ;
his Word only is that, Psalm. 56.4.10.
As for prayers and endeavors in use of means, when they issue from, and be the
fruits of this faith and confidence in God in Christ according to his Word;
then in this confidence, blessing may be expected in them, 2 Samuel 7.27.29. But
they cannot be the object either as Rule, or Medium, or Object, as aforesaid,
Romans 9.32. and 10.2.3. The Word, the Rule: Christ, the Medium: God, the Object:
and so God in Christ, according to his word, is only and altogether the object
of this faith.

Secondly, for the Mover or Worker of this faith; that which produces it, and
in and by which it is raised and wrought; it is not the force of any humane
discourse, reasoning, or Argument, 1. Cor. 2.1.4.5. nor is it the issue or
birth of any fervent endeavors, or workings of men, in, and according to the
law of works, Gal. 3.2. yea though endeavored and done to get Christ, the
righteousness of God thereby, Romans 9.31.32. and 10.2.3.4. neither yet is it a
conclusion, or spring from the appearance of any inward or outward changes,
effected in a man by any such reasonings, or endeavourings, Luke 18.11, 12. 2
Cor. 10.7.12.18. But this Mover and effector verily is

1. The appearance of the grace of God, in and through the Gospel, even of that
free and immense love of God in the gift of his Son to be the Savior of the
world, and the satisfaction made by Christ, and the fullness of grace and truth
in him. This grace of God appearing in and through Christ, moves to believe,
encourages and draws thereto; whence this faith is called, The gift of God
by grace, and not of works, Ephesians. 2.8.9. and they that have it, are said to have
believed through grace, Acts 18.27.

2. The Spirit proceeding from the Father and the Son in discovery of this
grace, effects this faith; and so the hand of the Lord, that is, the Spirit
of the Lord, or the demonstration of the Spirit and power, is said to bring to
believe in God, Acts 11.21. 1 Cor. 2.4.5.

And in respect of both these, this grace and Spirit working faith, it is said,
After the kindness and love of God to manward, appeared; he saved us by the
washing of regeneration, and renewing of the holy Ghost, Tit. 3.4.5. And so the
believers are said to be borne of water, and of the spirit, John 3.5. And so as
the spirit works faith, so for working it, he does not glorify the works of
the Law, or any frames, or works of men. But he glorifies Christ, and Gods
rich grace in Christ, to beget faith, and hope in men, John 16.13.14. 1 Pet.
1.21. And so to say in a word; It is the spiritual appearance of rich grace,
in, and by which this faith is wrought; Grace is the mover.

3 For the nature, and Act of this faith; There be three things together
meeting in one, in this Act of believing, or this faith of which is here
teached, as Scripture, and experience of Believers shows; that is to say,

1 An assent, and credit-giving to the report, or Testimony of the Gospel, and
that which by the spirit is evidenced, and appears through the same report:
the want of which the Prophet complains of, Esa. 53. Who has believed our
report? which not-believing, the Apostle calls, making God a liar, 1 John
5.10. And this assent and credit-giving to the report of the Gospel, was in
those, Act. 13.48. They magnified the word of the Lord, (counted it good, and
true) and so received the Testimony, and so did the Thessalonians likewise, 2
These. 1.10. And this is the first Act, without which; no faith at all, John
5.47. and 8.24.

2 An inward, and hearty approbation of the goodness of that reported in the
Gospel, in respect of that Christ has done, and that he is become, and that he
does, and that he is ready to do. And in respect of the rich, free, and great
love of God appearing therein, so as all other Excellencies are but loss, and
Dung in comparison of it, 1 Pet. 2.7. Phil. 3.7.8 9.

3 Through this assenting and believing-approbation; there is an inward, and
hearty resting, and relyance upon Christ, and God in Christ, for the
dispensation of this grace, and perfecting that which appertains to him to do,
Romans 5.1.2.5-10.

First, creditting the savings of the Gospel; and through those sayings,
Believing Christ himself, and the spirits Testimony of him, and in that
believing, trusting in God in Christ, for that promised, and so believing the
sayings, receiving Christ, and trusting in God through Christ; is the nature,
and Act of this believing.

4 For the motions, orstrings in this believing or faith; they are,

1 An inward and hearty acknowledgement of, and submission to Jesus Christ, as
the Lord, and Savior, and so to this grace appearing in him, 2 Cor. 5.15. He
dyed for all, that they which live, should not henceforth live unto themselves,
but unto him that dyed for them, and rose again, and so Romans 14.8. Whether we
live, we live unto the Lord, and whether we die, we die unto the Lord, etc.
verse 9. and 1 Cor. 6.19-20. Ye are not your own, yet are bought with a price,
etc. Romans 6.17. Ye have obeyed from the heart, the form of Doctrine to which
ye were delivered. True it is, that all men shall one day be brought so far to
the knowledge of the truth, that they shall therein be brought to confess
Jesus the Lord to the glory of God, 1. Tim. 2.4.6. Esa. 45.23. Phil. 2.10.11.
But now, in this day of grace, from the appearance and force of his loving
kindness, in belief of his goodness to submit to, and acknowledge the
Lordship, and grace of Christ; is the motion, and string of this faith, Hosea
3.5.

2 An inward, and hearty acceptance, and receiving of Christ, and this grace of
God in Christ, for Pardon, Peace, righteousness, and life, so John 1.12. As
many as received him, etc. Col. 2.6. Received Christ Jesus the Lord, Act.
26.18. Receive forgiveness of sins, Romans 5.1. We have Peace, etc. verse 11.
We have received the Atonement, verse 17. Receive the Abundance of grace, and
of the gift of righteousness, 1 John 5.12 He that has the Son, has life.
And this accepting, and receiving; is another motion in this faith.

3 An approach, access, in coming, or nigh-drawing to Christ, and this grace
in him, and for farther oneness, and enjoyment thereof, he also herein
building farther upon himself, Romans 5.2. By whom also we have access by faith
into this grace, etc. Ephesians. 2.18. Through him we have both access by one
spirit unto the Father, 1 Pet. 2, 3, 4. Ye have tasted that the Lord is
gracious, to whom coming, as unto a living stone, etc. And this approaching is
another motion in this faith.

4 A hearty content, and well-pleasednesse taking in, and with Christ, and
this grace in him, which is a feeding thereon, Phil. 3.3. And rejoice in Christ
Jesus, Col. 3.4. Christ who is our life, Psalm. 16.5.6. I have a goodly
heritage, John 6.56, 57, 58.68 69. He that eats my flesh, and drinks my
blood, dwells in me, etc.

And thus does this faith move, in a submission to, and acknowledgement of
Christ, receite of the grace in him, approaching to God through him, and
well-pleasednesse, taking in him our Portion, Psalm. 15.5.9. Such the moveings
in, and of this faith.

5 For the subject in which this faith is, the Instrument with which it moves,
and works, in and to all this, beholding, assenting, believing, trusting,
acknowledgement, receite, approaching, and content-taking; It is the heart, the
principal, the choice, and inmost strength of the mind, will, and affection,
even the spirit of all, which is usually called the heart in Scripture, Romans
10.9.10. And shall believe in thine heart; for with the heart man believes
unto righteousness, Ephesians. 3.17. That Christ may dwell in your hearts by
faith, so that this faith is not in, or with the mind, or conception only, or
with a light affection; but in, and with the whole heart, Act. 8.37. And so it
is with.

1 The mind, and understanding highly prizing Christ, and this rich grace in
him, as the most excellent, precious, and choice Pearl, and Riches. Phil.
3.7.8. 1 Cor. 1.24. Col. 2.3.10.

2 The will resolutely choosing, receiving, and accepting Christ, and this grace
in him, as that which is most pleasing, and welcome, Psalm. 73.24.25. and
119.30.37.

3 The affections closing therewith, as that which is most desirable, and
satisfying, Psalm. 16.5, 6, 7. Cant. 1, 2, 3, and 2, 3, 4, 5.

4 A springing, and reviving apprehension of truth, and goodness of that
believing, however fainting before, Psalm. 116.10.12. As old Jacob, though
before fainting at the news, yet when he believed the report of Joseph's being
alive, Genesis 45.27.28. His spirit revived and he said, it is enough, my son
Joseph is yet alive, etc. And as Mary, Luke 1.46.47. My soul does magnify the
Lord, and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior, and as David, Psalm. 103.1.2,
3. Thus is this faith in the heart, and with the heart man believes (not only
righteousness, but) unto righteousness, and so with the heart, moves, as
aforesaid.

6. For the strength, power, and principle, in, and of this faith; It is the
divine power, and spirit of Christ, entering with his motion, or infusion,
effecting: and spiritual seed, or dispofition in the heart, in which, the
divine power, and spirit of Christ, that wrought this faith, operateth in and
with this faith, which faith is therefore rightly called, Col. 2.12. The faith
of the operation of God, who has raised Christ from the Dead: and the working
of his mighty power which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the
dead; is affirmed to work in those that by it, believe: Ephesians. 1.19.20. And by
reason of this spiritual disposition effected in the heart of the Believer; it
is called, The spirit of faith, 2 Cor. 4.13. And by this spirit of faith it is
that the believer in believing is enabled,

1 To behold, and discern the object of faith, Christ in his fullness and
beauty, and the rich grace of God in him, John 1.14.16.18. Mat. 16.17. 1 Cor.
29. 1 John 3.1.

2 Moved and overcome in the appearance of this grace to believe. 1 Pet. 1.21.
Tit. 3, 4, 5.

3 Enabled to assent to, and receive the Testimony, 1 These. 1.5. And to
believe, and accept the grace it self, 2 These. 2.13.14. And to depend on God
for all the hope to come. Romans ^.5.10. Gal. 5.5.

4 Prevailed with in the motions to the submission to, and acknowledgement of
Christ 1 Cor. 12.3. To receiving him, John 1.12.13. To approaching to God in,
and by him, Ephesians. 2.18. and to Content-taking in him, Col. 3.10.11.

5 Has the new mind, spirit, and heart effected, Ezekiel. 36.27. 1 John 5.20.
And the mind and law of Christ written therein, 1 Cor. 2.16. 2 Cor. 3.3.18.

6 The springs, fruits, and operations of love, joy, peace, etc. Rise up, Gal.
5.22.23. Diffusing the virtue, and operation, in all the powers and faculties
of he man, Mat 13.33. Purifying the heart unto unfeigned love of the Brethren, 1
Pet. 2, 22. Rasing up motions, and so springing forth in prayer, praise,
confession, works of mercy, etc. 2 Cor. 4.13.

And all notions about the Doctrine of faith, and Profession of faith where
this spirit of faith is wanting, is but dead faith, James 2.17.26. And all
works wrought by humane force, not produced by this spirit of faith, are but
dead works, Heb. 6.1.2. Tim. 3.5. but this spirit of faith is the life of
faith, and that which makes faith lively, in all that is said of it, Romans
8.2.4.14.

7 For the one-nesse of this faith, in the diversity of the Degrees, and Acts
of it; the Scripture shows,

That there are diverse degrees of this true, and Divine faith: the first Degree
is little and small, in comparison, as a grain of Mustard-seede, Mat. 13.31.
Luke 17.6. And called little, or weak in faith, Mat. 6.30. Romans 14.1. The
second Degree is stable, steadfast, or strong faith, abiding in Christ,
endeavoring temptations, and trials, Col. 1.23. and 2.5.1 These. 3.7.8. The
third degree, is effectual, and victorious, working faith, and overcoming, 1
These. 1.3. 1 John 5.4. Though there are diversity of measures, or Degrees, and
Growth therein, in each Degree, 2 These. 1.3. And in respect of the diversity of
Degrees in faith; some are called Babes; some, strong men; and some; Fathers, 1
John 2.12.13.14.

2 That the Acts, or Actings of this faith be diverse, and manifold, as to say a
areceiving Act, a springing Act, and a flowing, and streaming Act: as in the
Scripture, and experience; believers find.

First, a receiving Act, this faith wrought by the spirit of grace in the heart
receives the history, or record, and Testimony of God in the Gospel concerning
Christ, 1 These. 2.13. 2 These. 1.10. 1 John 5.9.10.11. The grace of God in
Christ testified, Romans 1.5. and 5.17. As remission of sins, Act. 10.43.
Justification, Peace, Sanctification, Liberty of access to God, and hope of
glory, Romans 5.1.2.3. Act. 26.18. Divine power, and strength of relyance on God,
Romans 5.5.10.11. And yielding up according to the leadings of grace, 2 Timothy 1.7.
2 Pet. 1.1-4. Whence also such exhortations to believers, as Romans 12.1.2. Phil.
2.1.2.12.13. and that 1 John 4.4. and 5.4.

Secondly, a springing Act, for from this faith wrought by the spirit in the
heart; springs up love of God, and Jesus Christ our Lord, and joy in God, 1
Pet. 1.7.8. Romans 5.11. And love of brethren, 1 John 3.23. and 4.21. and 5.1. 2
Cor. 5.14. and patience, and meekness, etc. Gal. 5.22. According to that is
said, John 7.38.

Thirdly, a flowing, or streaming Act, from the springs, the motions, flowing
to put forth accordingly, Romans 10.10. And this more ordinarily, to pray, give
thanks, declare his goodness, show mercy, etc. Psalm. 116.10. 2 Cor. 4.13. or
more extraordinary, in some miraculous operations, Mat. 17.20. Luke 17.6. Mark
16, 17, 18.

3 That notwithstanding the diverse Degrees in this faith, and the diverse manner
of Acting, and Acts of this faith; yet the faith it self is but one, and only
one, Ephesians. 4.4. As there is but one body, even one true Church, or Sanctuary
that is united to Christ, and shall be in, and with him for ever, Cant. 6.9.
And this Church one seed, Gal. 3.17. One Son, Hosea. 11.1. One Christ, one
body, though the members be many, 1 Cor. 12.12. And as there is but one head,
husband, and Lord of this body, and Church with all its members, which is Jesus
Christ the Son of God, and our Savior, Ephesians. 1.22.23. and 4.15.16. and
5.30. 1 Cor. 8.6. And as there is but one Baptism, whereby we are baptized
into this one Body, whereof Christ is the head, and that is by the spirit, and
with the washing of water, and the word; And this is into the Death; and unto
the resurrection of Christ, and so for conformity in one, and therethrough
conformity in the other, 1 Cor. 12.13. Ephesians. 5.26. Romans 6.3, 4, 5. Tit. 3.4.5.
And as there is but one God and Father, to whom we come, in coming to Christ,
and he the Father of Christ, and of every of us, Ephesians. 4.6. And as there is
but one spirit, proceeding from the father, and the son, effecting, and
breathing one spirit, mind, disposition, or heart, and that the spirit mind,
disposition, and heart of Christ, into which all that are baptized into Christ,
are made to drink, and so are one spirit, Ephesians. 4.4 even so likewise, (as in
the place forecited) there is but one faith.

True it is; The word Faith, in Scripture, is used diversely; sometime for the
object of faith, even the ground, and foundation of faith, and that which is to
be, and is believed, and believed in, and to that end to be preached and heard,
Romans 1.5. and 10.6. Gal. 1.23. and 3.5. Sometimes the word is used for the
grace of faith, Col. 1.4 and 2.5-12. Ephesians. 2.8. Sometimes for both the object,
and the grace united with the object together, Acts 13.8. Romans 4.11. and 9.30.
And yet however taken; there is but one faith. The object in every respect is
one. The Gospel, or word of grace, though it has many branches and uses, yet
is but one and the same Gospel. 2 Cor. 11.4. with Gal. 1.7.8.9. The Gospel,
Col. 1.5.23. Even so the Lord Jesus Christ set forth in the Gospel, though set
forth, as he is indeed, the Son of God, and the Son of Man; yea, God Man,
and declared in respect of what he was, and what he became for us, and what he
has done, and what he is for us, and with what he is furnished, and what he is
to us. And as he is the Savior of all men, especially of them that believe,
and the Judge of all, etc. yet he is but one, 2 Cor. 11.4. with 1 Cor. 8.6. the
Christ, John 4.42. Even so God the Father that is in Christ, is one God,
(though his works be manifold) 1 Cor. 8.6. Gal. 3.20. 1 Timothy 2.5. even so the
holy Spirit that proceeds from the Father and the Son, and discovers
Christ, and God in Christ, and bears forth the testimony, however his gifts
and operations be many and manifold; yet the Spirit is but one, 1 Cor. 12.4 11.
yea the Father, the Son, and the holy Spirit are, 1 John 5.7. one God, Mark
12 32.34. set forth in one Gospel. And so the object of faith is one; and so
faith also, though so taken.

The grace of faith, or the believing it self that is wrought in the heart by
the Spirit of grace, however there are diversity of degrees in the same, both
in the strength of believing, and also in the fullness of the discovery of the
object believed, and in the effects accordingly, and also the Acts manifold, as
is shown: yet the faith it self is but one. And this is evident in the
forenamed place, Ephesians. 4.4. where both faith, and the object of faith, and the
means, and the hope, and the people that receive it, are all mentioned
distinctly; so that the word faith there means, the grace of faith, and it is
expressly affirmed to be one, There is one faith. As for humane and worldly
faith, or a show and pretense of divine faith, and hypocritical profession
thereof, it is no faith at all in Scripture language: there is no virtue in
gtting or retaining it, nor danger in departing therefrom in respect of any
spiritual life. As for that belief of the report of the Gospel, and
profession thereof, which is destitute of the life and operation of the Spirit
of faith; it is no more faith then the body of a man is a man when the Ghost is
given up and departed, Jam. 2.26. So as there is no other true and living
faith, but one; the receiving the history, and record, the receiving remission
of sins, justification and sanctification, and power for divine operations or
miracles, the springs, the streams, the acts, as is shown, are all by one and
the same faith. And so it is one and the same faith, that in discovery of the
object is tendered, and to which called, and which by the divine testimony is
effected, and which in abiding is after confirmed, and which grows and
works by love: it is still one and the same faith, 2 Pet. 1.1. And this faith
closing with, and the believer therein united, and become one with the object
of faith; it is still one, and then stable and sure to abide, Heb. 4.2.3. And
this is the faith, Scripture speaks of.

Fourthly, for the remembrance here spoken of, it is not that humane exercise
of thoughts, in running over, and recording the words, stories, several
doctrines, reasons and uses, etc. that one has heard, and read, thereby to
habituate them in memory, that one may have them to think, and speak of at all
times, though there be a good use of such remembering, notwithstanding some
turn it to an evil, Mat. 27.63. But the remembrauce here spoken of, is a
believing remembrance, when in this faith, the death, resurrection, and
Sacrifice of Christ, with the virtue of its presentation to God, and of its
application to us, 1 Cor. 15.3.4. 2 Timothy 2.8. the love and power there-through
testified, and dispensed, the hope therein given, and that therethrough
tendered to be wrought, is believingly

1. In the discoveries, testimonies and sayings thereof noted, observed and
heeded diligently, as Jacob observed the saying, Genesis 27.11. and Lydia on the
opening of her heart attended to the things, etc. Acts 16.14. As Moses said,
Set your hearts to all the words which I testify, Deuteronomy. 32.46.

2. The grace, consolations, hope, and instructions tendered in their
discoveries, to accept and retain in the heart, with the choice estimate, love,
desires, and submission, Luke 8.15. Prove. 6.20.21, 22. as Mary kept the saying
in her heart, Luke 2.51. and David, Psalm. 119.11.16.24.72.

3 The motions and teachings of this grace, yield up to, and vent forth Romans
12.1.2, Phil, 2.1.2.12.13. Tit. 2.11.12. Gal. 5.24. as David, Psalm. 16.7.

4. The taking all occasions, and being minded by all occasions for the revived
remembrance of these things in and of Christ, Psalm. 16.8. By the creatures of
God, the heaven, the earth, and the inhabitants, which (being by sin dissolved)
are through the Sacrifice, mediation and power of Christ, upheld, Psalm. 75.3.
Col. 1.17. and so showing forth his glory, Psalm. 19.1-6.

2. By the particular mercies of God extended as a fruit of the Sacrifice of
Christ, and that life that is in him, John 1.4.5. carrying forth some testimony
of his goodness, Acts 14.17. and leading to repentance, Romans 2.4. These give
apt occasions to remember these things.

3 By the chastisements God lays on men, especially, the sufferings of
Believers for the Gospel, apt to mind us of him that bare all our sorrows, Isa
53.4. And has sanctified sufferings for us, to whom we are to be conformed,
and who is ready and able to do us good by them, and to deliver, etc. Romans 6.4,
5. Heb. 12.2-7.

4 The Word of God minding us of these things. In Moses writing, John 5.45. In
the Shadows and Sacrifices of the Law, Heb. 9. and 10. In the Prophecies, Act.
3.24. Romans 1.2, 3. In the Doctrine, Invitations, and Promises, Isa. 53.1-6.
with Act. 13.34. In the full and plain Narration, 1 Cor. 15.3, 4.

5 The Ordinances of God mind us of these things, as Preaching, 1 Cor. 2.4. and
15.1-4. 1 John 14.14. Writing, John 20.31. 1 John 1.1-5. Confirming, Jud.
20.21. 1 These. 4.18. and 5.10.11. Prayer, etc. The Door for which is opened by
Christ's sacrifice, and mediation, Heb. 10.19, 20, 22. and 4.15, 16.

6 The grace of God with the fruits thereof, given by the Spirit of Christ into
the believing heart, aptly minds of these things, Romans 5.1.5-11.

7 The beholding believers through grace brought out of the state and
fellowship of the world, into union and fellowship with Christ, and one another
in him, minds us, not only of the blood of Christ's shed, and his ransom given
for all men, by which he has bought all of God; but of the virtue of his blood
also by his Spirit discovered, and applied, and they there through redeemed,
and purchased from among men unto God, Act. 20.28. Rev. 5.9.

8 Yea, even the beholding men, as men, though in their natural condition,
does aptly mind of these things, Romans 8.3. 1 Timothy 2.6. Heb. 2.9. 2 Cor. 5.14.15
-- 20.

9 Yea, even the follies, disobedience, etc. of such men, are fit occasions to
put these things to remembrance, Tit. 3.2, 3, 4, 5.

10 Yea, even our own sins, being that for which he was crucified, Isa 53.6.
and the combats within, all freedom being given in, and through him, do give
occasion of remembrance of these things, as is seen, Romans 7.24, 25. and 8.1, 2,
3, 4. and so we might proceed.

So that in the believing the truth, and goodness of the things of Christ set
forth in the Gospel, with such a love retaining them in the heart, as by all
occasions to be stirred up to this receiving, attending, accepting, and
yielding up thereto, is the remembrance here meant. And to have the word of
Christ dwell plenteously in us, teaching, etc. Col. 3.16. The way to this
remembrance is, in the acknowledgment of our own weakness, and the vanity of
all humane helps, through the belief of his love toward us, and what he has
done for us when we were enemies, and his more special love, in making his
grace known to us, to depend on him for his spirit, to mind us of him, and his
words, Romans 5.6-11. Gal. 5.5. for which he has given us his promise, John
14.26. and 16.7. -- 15.

And this remembrance in the believing heart is profitable.

1 To preserve, and save from falling, 1 Cor. 15.2, 3, 4. 2 To return, and
raise out of falls, and decays, Rev. 3.3. 3 To meet with comforts, teachings,
etc. Psalm. 63.5, 6, 7.
And thus of the faith, and remembrance here meant.

CHAP. XIV.
Of the usefulness here meant, what, and how manifold it is.

THE usefulness of the precious blood, and sacrifice of Christ believingly
remembered; so as there-through God is depended on; Is in, and to the believer
twofold. 1 In respect of themselves. 2 In respect of others: and both ways
manifold.

First, In respect of the Believer himself, it is fourfold:

1 Receiving. 2 Springing up. 3 Streaming forth. And 4 waiting.

1 The first use is receiving: and so believing, and receiving, are used one
for another, John 1.12. And the receipt in believing view, and remembrance is
manifold, as is fore-shewn, namely, 1 Of the Word of Christ, the Record and
Testimony God gave of him, 1 Cor: 15.1.

2 In receipt of his testimony, is received the mind of Christ, so far as to
receive information, light, and discerning in some measure of 1 That which
Christ has done in his death, resurrection, ascension, and sacrifice offered
to God, what for all men, and what for all that by the heavenly call believe on
him, as is shown before. 2 That which (by virtue of this which he has done)
he is become, and that in general for all men, as that he is the propitiation
for their sins, 1 John 2.2. And the Mediator between God and them, procuring
for them patience, mercies, and some means for their Call, 1 Timothy 2.5. And
that in special for those that in the heavenly call are prevailed with to
believe on him, as that besides both the forementioned for all men, he is in
special manner for them an Advocate, 1 John 2.1. Yea, even the Mediator of the
New Testament, that hy his spiritual application of the virtue of his
sacrifice, they may receive the promised inheritance, Ephesians. 5.25, 26. Heb.
9.14, 15. Yea, he is their King, and Teacher, and the high Priest of their
Profession, and to them wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and
redemption, Heb. 3. and 7. and 8. 1 Cor. 1, 30. 3 That which by virtue of the
sormer he now does, and will do, and that both in general for all men, as the
extension of his procured patience, mercies, and means, to bring them to the
knowledge of the truth, Prove, 1.23. and 8.4 etc. and Psalm: 75.3. Act: 14 17.
And such as refuse light when it comes, he will one day bring them to
acknowledgment of the truth, and then judge them, Jsa: 45:23. Phil: 2.10.11.
Rom: 2.16 And also in special for those that through the acknowledgment of
truth in the day of grace believe on him, how he presents them in himself
spotless before God, Col. 1.22. interceding for them, Heb: 7:25. and will send
forth his Spirit to teach, comfort, and sanctify, uphold, lead, and preserve
them to the Inheritance, etc. John 14.1, 2, 3, 26. and 15:25 and 16.13, 14, 15.
1 Pet. 1.4, 5. Psalm: 138:8. 4 The great and rich love of God through all this
discovered, Ephesians: 2.4, 5. His general love of compassion to all men, John
3:16.17. Tit: 2, 11, 12. and 3.4. and his peculiar and special love of delight
to those in the heavenly Call united to Christ, Ephesians: 5:25, 26. Psalm: 149.1.
5. The great terror, and heavy inexcusable condemnation for all that when
light comes, set light by, and will none of Christ to reign over them, Hebr.
2:2: and 10:29. Luk 19:27. 2 Cor: 5.10:11.


And in this enlightening they receive a right judgment concerning God, and
Christ, and Man, and sin, and righteoesnesse, life, and death, etc, Phil: 3.3
-- 9. and so its said, we have the mind of Christ, 1 Cor: 2, 16.

3 In receiving this divine testimony and information, is received also an
encouragement of the grace it self testified in Christ, Rom: 1.5. as remission
of sins, etc. as fore-shewn, and the spirit of adoption with divine power, etc.
Gal: 3.2. Rom: 8:15. as before.

2 The second use is for springing up, as in believing-minding these things are
received; so from this received in the same believing-mindfulnesse of Christ,
springs up 1 A high estimate of Christ, and the things of Christ, and desire
of him, with a low estimate of ones self, and all ones own things, Phil: 3.7,
8, 9. 2 An inward sorrow for all ones evil thoughts of God and Christ, and
sins, against so gracious and loving a God, and Savior, Act: 2.37. Zach:
12:10. 3 A fervent love of God, and Jesus Christ our Lord, with peace toward
God, and joy in God. 1 Pet: 1:7, 8. Rom: 5.2, 5, 11. 4 Love of brethren, and
compassion toward men, 1 John 3.23. and 4:21. and 5.1. 2 Cor: 5.14. 5 Desires
of Gods glory, the Churches prosperity, and Men's conversion, and the coming
again of Christ. 6 Detestation of evil, with love of God, and so patience,
meekness, etc. Gal: 5-17, 22, 23.


And these, and such like spring up in believing-remembrance of the sacrifice,
and mediation of Christ, according to that, John 7.38.

3 The third use is for streaming forth; for as in believing-remembrance of the
sacrifice, and mediation of Christ there, are such receivings, and such
springs, as fore-shewn; so in the same believing-remembrance, the springs
arising from the receites do move, and stream to flow, and vent forth, and is
called a showing forth the virtues of him that called, etc. 1 Pet: 2, 9.
bringing forth good things, Matthew. 12.35. A working cut the salvation that is a
man's own in and with him, Phil: 2:12, 13. which is from the force of the
spirit, grace, and love of Christ received, springing up in the inwards, fruits
of zeal, charity, etc. forementioned, streaming, and boiling to flow forth in
motions and bowels, stirring thereto. And this, according to the channels
opened, and occasions given, Job. 32, 8, 18, 19, 20. 2 Cor: 5, 14, 15, 19, 20.
And grace received, 1 John 1, 2, 3. Act. 4.20.

1 To deny ungodliness, and worldly lusts, Tit: 2.11, 12. Gal: 2.16, 17, 21. 2
To oppose false doctrines, and ways, Revel. 2.2. Gal. 2.11.14. 3 To attend the
Ordinances of God, and seek his face therein. Psalm. 27.4. and 23.6. To pray to
him, and give him thanks, Psalm, 116.2, 10, 13. Recount his favors, and sing
his praises, Psalm. 145.1. -- 11. 4 To confess Christ Jesus the Lord and
Savior, in holding forth the word of life, exalting Christ, and yielding
themselves servants for Christ his sake, Romans 10.10.2 Cor. 4, 5, 13. Phil.
2.12.16. 5 To use equity and mercy, to give to every one his due for the Lords
sake, and to do good to all, especially them of the household of faith, Romans
13.10. Tit. 3.1-4.8. Gal. 6.8.9 10. whence for all these, the exhortations to
believers, run in such a strain suitable to the law of grace. Romans 12.1.2.
Phil. 2.1.2. 6. To confess it their finne, wherein soever they have shut up
these bowels (undervalued the grace believed, deaded the springs, or stopped the
streams, either by forgerfulnesse, or neglect of yielding to its motions, or
turning aside to any other motions) and seeking pardon and healing of the same
in returning to Christ, etc. 1 John 3.17. and 1.9. Mat. 26.75. Psalm. 32.15. 7.
In some, at some time, to some miraculous operations in respect of that which
is ordinary. Mat. 17.20. Luk 17.6. Mar. 16.17.18. And these and such like are
the flowings forth of the springs from the grace received in the
beleeving-Remembrance of the virtuous Blood, Sacrifice, and mediation of
Christ.
4. The fourth use is, for Patience, for as in believing-Remembrance of the
virtuous Blood, Sacrifice, and mediation of Christ, and Gods rich love therein,
such grace is received, such fruits do spring, and such streams flow forth:
so also (it being some time after believing, and walking in faith, before all
that is set in hope be received, and in that time, many thoughts, trials, and
temptations to be gone through, so that there is need of Patience, Heb. 10.36.
1 Pet: 1, 6, 7.) In this believing remembrance of the Sacrifice and mediation
of Christ, patience is stirred up, and effected in exercise, and preserved, so
as from that beheld in, and received from Christ, arises a sweet confident
expectation, and patient abiding, and waiting through all Trials, Sufferings,
and services for his performance of all his righteous Promises in his own
season, and so for his preserving us to the inheritance, and for his own
visible coming again, and receiving us to himself, that we may be with him, and
reign with him for ever, John 14:1, 2, 3. 2 Cor. 4.16, 17, 18. and 5.1 -- 6.
Tit. 2 11, 13. Heb. 11.26.

Secondly, for the Believer in respect of others, this believing-remembrance of
the virtuous Sacrifice, and mediation of Christ, is very useful, and
profitable, and that in three respects: 1 In respect of a right view, and
estimate of them. 2 In respect of a right demeanor in word, and conversation
toward them. 3. In respect of a right confidence concerning them.


1. In respect of a right view and estimate of them; the beleeving-remembrance
of the death, sacrifice, and mediation of Christ, leads and moves the judgment
and mind of the believer.

2. To esteem all that are only natural men, as those for whom Christ has
died, and given himself a ransom, and bought them, and is the propitiation
for their sins, and mediator between God and them, 2 Cor. 5.14. Heb. 2.9. 1 Timothy 2 5.6. 1 John 2.2. 2 Pet. 21, 2. And in this respect to be loved, pitied,
prayed for, and to have the Gospel declared to them, and to be served for their
good, 2 Cor. 5.11.14, 15, 20. 1 Timothy 1.15. to chapter 2.1. -- 6. Romans 1.14, 15.16.
1 Cor. 9.18. -- 23. and 10.33. And so to afford them all that honor and respect
of the place, the disposing hand of such a redeemer has put them in, 1 Pet.
2.16-19. 1 Timothy 6.1.

2. To esteem all that are not only so ransomed, but by the gracious
providence of our redeemer, put in our charge and tuition, as the price of his
blood graciously given, and committed to us by our Lord, to be brought up for
him, and nurtured in the knowledge and fear of him, the Lord of us both, Genesis
18.19. and 33.5. Ephesians. 6.4.9. Job. 13.14.

3. To esteem all that are through grace brought in to believe in Christ, as
the Sons and Daughters of God, Brethren and Members of Christ, and of us the
House of God, whose we are, and to whom we belong, fit objects for special
love and fellowship, so as Christ may be loved and served in them; and they
with special love and service for Christ his sake, John 1.12, 13. Romans 9.26.
Ephesians. 2.19, 20. Heb. 1.6. Ephesians. 5.30. 1 Cor. 12.12, 13. etc.

4. To esteem all of these called ones (that are not only redeemed of God by
bloodshedding, but unto God by his precious Blood spiritually applied, Rev.
5.9: 1 Pet. 1.18.19.) as we have been in any sort instruments by whom God has
called them, 2 Thessalonians. 2.13.17. or, are by his grace and providence, both led to
some special charge and oversight of them, 1 Pet 5.1.2. so as to those we are
more peculiarly related for more abundant care and service for them, Act. 20.28.

5. To esteem those who after light, and knowledge of the truth, have resisted
it, and departed from it, turning the grace of God into lasciviousness, and
opposing the power of godliness, persisting herein, till given up of God, as
ungodly, reprobate, and the feed of the Serpent to be contended with, turned
from, and ceased praying for, Jer. 6.6.16-30. Jude 4. -- 19. 2 Timothy 3.5. 1 John
5.16.

Secondly, in respect of a right demeanor, in word and conversation.

1. For words; it will mind us of right and true Gospel, and right words, which
we need not cloak, curtaile, or equivocate in delivery, nor be ashamed of; but
speak with boldness and plainness, Col. 1.13. Prove. 8.5, 6, 7. 2 Cor. 3.18,
and 4.1. 2. Romans 1.16. 2 Cor. 3.12. having that in them which is true, and meet
to be spoken to every man, Prove. 22.18. -- 21. to reprove and confute all false
doctrines, ways, and hopes, 2 Cor. 10.4, 5, 6. to instruct in the doctrine and
way of Christ, Romans 1.16.17. to press to convincement, Tit. 2.15. to comfort
the convinced, and to allure to good thoughts of God in Christ, and so to
believe, 1 Timothy 1.15.16.17. to encourage to abiding in the faith, Heb. 3.1-6.
to exhort and provoke to love and good works, Tit. 3.8. to set forth the
peculiar privileges of such as in believing are made one in Christ, Romans 8.2,
15, 26, 33. and to encourage them to constancy in their holy profession, and
fellowship, Heb. 10.1.19-25. And so to season all our words with grace, that
they may savor of, and administer grace to others, Ephesians. 4.20, 30. Col. 4.6. 2 Timothy 3.15.16.

2 For conversation; it will mind to be putting on bowels of mercy, kindness,
humbleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering, forbearing and forgiving, etc.
Col. 3.12. to bless them that curse us, etc. Matthew. 5.44.45. to walk in
wisdom, and blameless toward them that are without, Col. 4.5. Phil. 2.15.
And faithfully and fruitfully among the brethren, John 15.1:10. and so to pray
for good for all, 1 Timothy 2.3, 4. and peculiar good for believers, Phil. 1.8.9,
10.

3. For confidence; it will mind of that which will make confident in him, to
vouchsafe his presence by Spirit, so far as to manifest the savor of his
knowledge to others by us, for allurement, or convincement, 2 Cor. 2.14.17. and
so confirm his words spoke by us, that even the rejectors shall one day
confess the truth thereof, and be judged thereby, Isai. 44.25.26. Phil. 2, 10,
11. John 12.48. Romans 2.16. and such as receive them, shall have a proof of his
own gracious presence, and speaking there through, Matthew. 10.40 2 Corinthians.
13.3. so as we shall be fruitful, 2 Pet. 1.8.9.

And to conclude, the believing remembrance of the Death, Sacrifice, Ransom,
and Mediation of Christ, is useful for the receipt of all mercies,
chastisements, use of ordinances, and creatures, with purity, comfort, and
profit, Romans 14.14. 1 Timothy 4.4.5. Tit. 1.15.

And thus in viewing what the Gospel says of the precious Blood, Death, and
Sacrifice of Christ; in the sense of the words, the ends, the necessity, the
excellency and dignity, the virtue, operation, and prevalency, with the
afefulnesse of the knowledge, and believing remembrance thereof; we may see
that there was so great and good cause for the same to be made known,
believed, and remembered, and such a fullness in it, that we need not wonder at
it, That the Apostles should determine to know nothing else in their
ministration, as 1 Corinthians. 2.2. save Jesus Christ and him crucified; and that
they would glory in nothing else, ( Gal. 6.14.) save the Cross of Christ; and
that they should be so diligent to put believers in remembrance of these
things. And our Savior appointed the Word preached, Baptism, and the Supper
of the Lord, for the remembrance of these things: seeing these things rightly
understood, contain all things necefull to eternal life.

CHAP. 15.
Observations from this whole Discourse in all the fourteen Chapters, and now
for a litte further enlarging the usefulness; note these confirmations.

1. THat the doctrine of the Gospel setting forth Jesus Christ, Observe. 1. Act.
10.36. 1 Timothy 2.4.5.6 1 Ioh. 5.10.11 12. 1 Cor. 1.30. Psa. 68.18 Ioh. 16.7-15
Mat 28.18. Prove. 8. Heb. 5 9. Romans 14.2.12.
as now he has come in the flesh, and died for our sins, and is risen for
our justification, Romans 1. Heb. 9. and having offered up his own self a
Sacrifice to God for us, is received and exalted at Gods right hand, having
obtained eternal redemption, and so is become the Lord of all: the propitation
for the sins of the world: the Mediator between God and Men: Wisdom,
Righteousness, Sanctification and Redemption, and life in him, for all. And
he all this for, and to all that by the heavenly call believe on him, and for
them the Mediator of the new Testament, that they may receive the promises,
being immeasurably filled with the holy Spirit to send forth to men, even the
rebellious, that the Lord God might dwell among them, and to such as are
brought in to him, to lead them into all truth, having all power and authority
to call all the sons of men, that they might look, and live to him; to
absolve, and bring to eternal life, all that obey his call, and to judge and
condemn all that persist refusing, and will none of him.

This Doctrine, as it is now declared in the Gospel, it is the only necessary
doctrine to be taught, known, believed, and walked in, and it is a full
sufficient and complete Doctrine, or Law, and needs no other doctrine to be
added to it, either to go before, or follow after, or be joined with it, 1
Cor. 2.1-4. Gal. 1.7, 8, 9.

1. Either to convince the world of sin, or righteousness, or judgment, and
to empty a man of himself, John 16.7, 11. Phil. 3.3-8. 2. Or to call to
Christ, and so to repentance and faith, and there through to receipt of
remission of sins, renewing, and life in Christ, 2 Thessalonians. 2.14. 3. Or to
encourage believers to abide in the faith, John 15.1-10. Col. 1.5-23. 4. Or to
direct and lead Believers to sanctification and conformity with Christ in heart
and life, 2 Cor. 3.3.18. Tit. 2.10.11.12.14. 5. Or, for Believers exercise, to
preserve, and edify themselves, and one another in the faith and love of God
in Christ, and in the love of one another, through all sufferings and services
of love, till they come to the Inheritance, John 15.4 7, 8. 1 John 2.24, 25.
Jude 20. 6. Or to oppose all sins, and adversaries, and all false Doctrines,
ways, and hopes withal, 2 Cor: 6.4, 7. and 10.4.5, 6. Ephesians. 6.17.
Yea, this Doctrine of the Gospel, as it now sets forth Christ, and life in
him; is a complete, full, and sufficient Doctrine for all this, without
addition: And for better understanding the sufficiency of the Gospel; this is
to be heeded, That the life in Christ, the Redemption completed in his own
body for men, and the redemption in the Declaration thereof tendered to be
wrought in men, and by his Spirit in application of that in himself, wrought in
such as believe on him; ever from the beginning was, now is, and ever will be,
one, and the same, 1 John 1.4, 5, 9, 12. 1 John 1.1, 2, 3. Heb: 13.8. But the
fullness and cleernesse of the Doctrinall Declaration, and Dispensation, as
well as of the spiritual communication of Christ, and the life in him, has
had its diversity of Degrees.

1 There was some discovery of this life, even of the redemption wrought by
Christ in himself for men, and the power in him to make it known, and tender it
to men, and give it into believing men, even at first; And that then declared,
was Gospel, even the same, though not so full, and clear, as the word of the
beginning of Christ now, as appears by comparing Genesis 3.15. with John 1.4. 1
John 1.1-3. and 3.5-8.

2 After some time, God was pleased to give a more full discovery of Christ,
and this life in him, in opening to and making with Abraham, an everlasting
Covenant, to assure all the spiritual Seed of this life in Christ, and the
privileges thereof, by a sure and unalterable Covenant, Genesis 17. which was not
another; but the same Gospel more full come forth, and the same that now is,
though now more open, and clear, Gal 3.8, 16, 28, 29.

Yet till Christ was actually come; God saw it needful to add still something,
for the nurture, and guidance of his people, that they might estimate, seek,
and lay hold of Christ, and this life in him: which still they were apt to
slight and neglect, and ready either to extenuate their evils, or to magnify
some wisdom and righteousness of their own: wherefore God gave them a
Testament or Law by Moses his servant, one part whereof pointing out the
righteousness due from man to God, thereby to discover their sinfulness, and
make them say Amen to the Curse; And the other part, to type and shadow out
Christ, that they might, in observation thereof, look and wait for all grace
through him that was co come: And this Law or Testament was not the everlasting
Covenant, It was not the Gospel preached to Abraham, but a Law added, because
of transgression till the Seed should come: and so long was the teaching, and
pressing of this Law needful, and useful, as subservient to the Gospel, etc.
Gal. 3.19. to drive to Christ.

3 But when the fullness of time was come, God sent forth his Son made of a
woman, etc. Gal. 4.1, 4. And he being come in the flesh, and having suffered,
and being in our nature exalted at the right hand of God; he has given a new
Testament, which is a first fruits of the everlasting Covenant, and the
blessing of the Gospel, for the nurture of his people: and so the old
Testament decayed, and passed, 2 Cor. 3.11. Heb. 8.13. Gal. 3.24, 25.

And thus, though it was the same grace and life in Christ; yet in respect of
this full and clear dispensation that is now by the Gospel, it was hid in God,
and not so made known, as now since Christ came, it was to his holy Apostles
and Prophets by the Spirit, and by them in the Gospel, in which the same Spirit
still teaches, Ephesians. 3.2-9. Col. 1.26. 1 John 1.2, 3, 4. And so of the Gospel
as now declared, is the Affirmation in the Observation to be understood;
namely, That the Doctrine of the Gospel is the only necessary, and full
sufficient, and complete Doctrine to be taught, known, believed, and walked in,
etc. And this does yet further appear, in that 1 This Gospel is that Doctrine
which God gave Jesus Christ to preach, and sent him, and filled him with Spirit
to preach, and he preached it, John 12 49, 50 and 17.8, 18. with Isa 4.2.1. and
61.1, 2. Luke 4.18. Mark 1.14. 2 This Gospel is that Doctrine which Jesus
Christ has given to his servants to preach, and sent them into the world, and
endued them with spirit to preach, and given them in charge to preach it, John
17.8, 18. and 15.26, 27. 1 John 1.1, 2, 3, 7. 2 Cor. 5.18, 19. 3 This Gospel
is that Doctrine which the Apostles confessed to have received of Jesus Christ,
Gal. 1.11, 12. 2 Cor. 5 19. 1 John 1.5. To be sent to preach, 1 Cor. 1.17. And
for the preaching whereof, a necessity was laid upon them, 1 Cor. 9.16. 4. This
Gospel is that Doctrine which the Apostles did preach to all men, every where,
Luke 9.6. Acts 2. and 3. and 4 and 5. and 10. and 13. etc. and professed
themselves to have preached, 1 Cor. 15.1-5. and to determine to know no other
doctrine, 1 Cor. 2.1. -- 4. and have denounced the curse on all that shall
preach any other doctrine, Gal, 1.8.9. 5. Yea, the fullness, sufficiency, and
compleatnesse of this doctrine of the Gospel, does yet further appear many
ways,


1. In the Name of it, the Gospel, that is, a joyful message of good news, or
glad tidings from heaven, Isai. 52.7. with Romans 10.15. It is good news indeed,
in that it is truth ( Prove. 8.4.8.) from God; of peace and good will to men:
Nahum 1.15. Luke 2.10. for mankind; of salvation, 1 Timothy 2.4.5, 6. which is in
Christ, Isa. 46.9. and shall be given to all that in believing come in to him,
Joh. 3.16. 1 John 5.10, 11, 12. 2. In the Titles of it, which are all full of
truth, the Gospel of God, Romans 15.16. the Gospel of Christ, Romans 1.16. the
Gospel of the grace of God, Acts 20.24. the Gospel of Salvation, Ephesians. 1.13.
the Gospel of the Kingdom, Matthew. 4.23. the glorious Gospel, 2 Cor. 4.4. the
everlasting Gospel, Rev. 14.6. the Gospel of peace, Ephesians. 6.15. the word of
reconciliation, 2 Cor. 5.19. of life, etc. 3. In the sum of it, both in the
narration and affirmation, showing the Son of God to be come, and what he
became, suffered, and did for us, and what he is, and does, and what he will
do in, and for all that believe in him, as this whole Treatise has declared. 4
In the holy Spirit that is promised to be sent forth in the ministration of
this Gospel, by which Christ will continue his own presence with his servants
ministering the same, John 14.16, 17. and 15.26, 27. and 16.7. -- 15. Matthew.
28.19, 20. 5 The effects of the Spirit in the Gospel, forementioned, both
witnessed to be effected thereby, and examples of its efficacies set forth
therein, as Tit. 3.4. And to conclude all in one word.
In respect of the Medium or Doctrine; the Gospel is the Foundation to be built
on, Ephesians. 2.20. 1 Cor. 3.10.11. the way to walk in, Col. 2.6. 2 John 9. and the
Schoolmaster to guide, and lead in the way, Tit. 2.11, 12, etc. and how full,
and prevalent; this whole treatise has shown in particular.

And as God has given us foundation; so likewise one way, Jer. 32.39. and as
Jesus Christ is the foundation, the way, the truth, and the life, and the
Prophet and Leader, 1 Cor. 3.11. John 14.6. Acts 3.22, -- 26. and his Spirit
that by which he discovers, testifies, draws to, and builds on
himself, comfort, sanctifies, teaches and leads his children, John
14.26. and 15.26. and 16.13, 14, 15. Romans 8.2.14; even so the Doctrine of the
Gospel is the Medium or instrument through which, Christ by his does all this,
2 Cor. 3.18. and 4.4, 6. whence, all such as abide in the Doctrine of Christ,
are affirmed to have both the Father and the Son, 2 John 9.

Objection.

But some are ready to object: this magnifying the Doctrine of the Gospel,
makes void the Law, and takes away all use thereof;

Answer.

The truth is, It establishes the Law, and leads to the right usefulness
thereof, which is met with (not in law-teaching and pressing, but) in the right
teaching the doctrine of the Gospel: as may be seen, by comparing, Romans 3.21.
-- 31. with 1 Timothy 1.5. -- 11.

For, by the Doctrine of the Gospel setting forth Christ understood, and
believed; the holiness, righteousness, goodness, spirituality, and
perfection of the Law is known and seen, not abolished: but ratified, and
fulfilled in and by Jesus Christ, the Son of God. In that, 1. He came, and
fulfilled all the righteous affections, and services to the utmost, that it
requires. 2 He, as the public man for us, suffered the curse, it sentenceth
it too for all the sins it can charge us with. 3 He rose, justified, and
presented himself righteous before God in the behalf of us. 4 He received
spirit to send forth in the Declaration hereof, that men might believe on him,
and in believing on him; have him for their righteousness before God, and be
freed from being under the obligation of the Law: to be under the obligation of
grace, to depend on him, and so receive spirit from him, to conform them to
himself, and so raise up from a better principle. The righteous affections, and
services, law called for, and gave no strength whereby they might be produced,
and to give the life law promised, and could not give, Romans 3.10-27. and 8.2,
3, 4. Gal: 5.16, 18, 22, 23. and 6.8. as may be seen in that before said, in
the 6. and 14. Chapters.

In receipt of which grace in the doctrine of the Gospel; as the believer is
freed from the obligation of the Law: so he enjoys the goodness thereof, in
the right ends and uses of it, in that 1 They own themselves, as in, and of
themselves, the sinners, and cursed ones for whom Christ was made sin, and a
curse, and so are dead to themselves, their own strength, wisdom, and
righteousness, Gal. 5.24. and 2.19, Rom: 10.3, 4. 2 They see the mercy of God
in giving the law for such ends, and freeing them from the obligation of it,
Rom: 7.9-25. and 8.2. 3. They are in every thought of this Law, kept from
turning to it again for life of justification, sanctification, or glory: and so
occasioned to stick closer still to Christ for all, Rom: 7.9-25. Phil. 3.7, 8.
4 They, in remembering any good that law bound them to; count themselves much
more obliged for the grace of Christ to do it, 1 Cor: 8.8, 16. Ephesians. 6.1-4. 5
They have the commands, as coming from the Gospel, not to get life; but to
testify and exercise charity, 1 Timothy 1.5. 6 They can, in Christ, see all the
commands turned into Promises: so, as in harkening to him, he will effect all
in them, Psalm: 81.8, 9. and 138.8.


So that; the Doctrine of the Gospel contains all that is meet to be taught:
and does not abolish, but establish the Law.

Observation 2.

2 That the Doctrine of the Gospel contains both the Word, of the beginning
of Christ: setting forth what he has done; and received, and is, for all, and
has to bestow on them when they believe: And all the everlasting Covenant, and
new Testament setting forth, what he is to, and will in due season do for
those that in believing are made one with him, Heb: 6.1-4. and 8, and 9, as is
shown throughout this Treatise; The first of these is to be preached to all
men, as the foundation to repentance, faith, etc, Heb. 6.1-9.

The second is to be opened to Believers for the encouragement of their hope,
and for their edification, etc.

Obser. 3.

3 That the grace of God discovered by the Spirit of Christ in this Gospel,
and put in the heart of the Believer; is through the same Spirit, a sufficient
Prop and Schoolmaster for, and to the Believer: to witness peace, to comfort,
renew, teach, lead, and preserve; in waiting for the coming of Christ, Tit:
2.11, 12. Gal: 5.5, 16, 18.

Obser. 4.

4 That the believing-remembrance of this grace of Christ is the way of
Believers, drawing from Christ all receites, springs, and streams of
consolation, and fruitfulness in themselves and for others: as is fore-shewn;
it being the drift of this whole Treatise.

CHAP. 15.
A pointing to some Applicatory usefulness.

1 IN this fore-discovery of the Gospel setting forth Christ; is Ground of
Reproof, of

1. Those; that slander the Gospel of Christ, and of the grace of Christ, and
the doctrine thereof, as insufficient to prepare men for Christ, or to
sanctify Believers, or as if it were Antinomianisme, and a doctrine of fleshly
liberty.

2 Those; that confound things that are distinct, and make them one, and of
like large extent, which the Gospel distinguishes, setting forth the one as
more general; the other, as special: As, the Reconciliation wrought by Christ
in himself with God for men; And, the Reconciliation which by Spirit applying
the former, he works in men to God: His mission, to make propitiation, and
offer sacrifice; And His mission, to preach the Gospel; And to His laying down
his life, to satisfy Justice; And To confirm the New Testament; And To seal
his ministration, and testify love, and therein give us example.


3 Those; that put all receipt of eternal life, upon the very Act of Christ's
suffering, rising, and offering himself a sacrifice to his Father; whereas all
this did but procure it into his hands to bestow: and it is the spiritual
application to the heart, in which the receite is.

4 Those; that take faith, only for a persuasion raised by consequence, and
arguments from Scripture, and frames, or that think faith to be nothing else,
but a believing to be saved by Christ, or that one stands spotless before God.

All which follies and mistakes, are discovered in this Treatise.

2. Here is ground of Admonition, and Exhortation, to all that through grace
believe in Christ, diligently, and constantly at all times: and in all things

To heed the Gospels Declaration of Christ, and his grace there-through made
known: And

To abide, and walk in the acknowledgment, and faith thereof: And

To suffer the grace there-through moving, and teaching; to have its perfect
work in us, and to yield up thereto.

And, how it will work in us, save, sanctify, renew, comfort, and lead us; is
already shown: The experiment of the truth whereof, the Lord fill us with; As
prays

The unworthiest of all he has shown mercy to, Tho. Moore.
