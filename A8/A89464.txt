TWO SPEECHES DELIVERED, THE ONE BY THE EARL OF MANCHESTR AND THE OTHER BY
JOHN PYM Esquire, In Guild Hall on friday the 13. of JANUARY 1642.

LONDON, Printed for PETER COLE, 1642.

A SPEECH Delivered by the Earl OF MANCHESTER.
MY Lord Major and Gentlemen you of the City of London,
this Assembly can never be looked upon by any Members of both Houses of
Parliament; but there must be some offering of gratitude made to you, both of
thanks and acknowledgments for your former large-hearted expressions, both of
affection and care for the preservation both of the Parliament and Kingdom:
The occasion why my Lords, and these Gentlemen of the House of Commons are come
hither is this, They have read an Answer to an humble Petition of the Lord
Major and Common-counsell and Citizens of London to His Majesty; In which
Answer, They find many wounding aspersions cast upon persons of very eminent
Authority in your City, and upon others of very great fidelity and trust among
you; this Answer they do find as it is printed to agree with that which the
Gentleman from His Majesty has here read; And they owning themselves equally
interessed (in all things that concern you) with you, have commanded this
Gentleman to make some observations by way of vindication both of the
proceedings of both Houses of Parliament, and of the proceedings of the City,
with this assurance that they will never dissert you, but will stand by you
with their lives and fortunes for the preservation of the City in general, and
those persons in particular, who have been faithful, and deserved well, both
of the Parliament and Kingdom, and they will pursue all means both with their
lives and fortunes, that may be for the preservation of this City, and for the
procuring of safety, happiness, and peace to the whole Kingdom.

The Speech of this Noble Lord, being entertained with loud expressions of joy
and thankfulness by the Commons; and after some time of silence being made,
Mr. Pym that worthy Member of the House of Commons and Patriot of his Country,
gave the sense of both Houses upon the several passages of His Majesty's
Answer; expressing it in the next Page following.

A SPEECH DELIVERED BY JOHN PYM Esquire.
MY Lord Major, and you worthy Citizens of this noble and famous City of
London,
I am commanded by the Lords and Commons, to let you know, that in this Answer,
which has been published to you, they do observe many things of great
aspersion upon the proceedings of Parliament very scandalous and injurious to
many particular Members of this City, whereupon they think that it becomes
them, both in tenderness of their own honor, and respect to you, to take
away all those aspersions, and to let you know the truth of their proceedings,
which have been full of honor and justice, as they stand in relation to their
own duty, and full of humility, and obedience toward His Majesty, and of care
for the common good, and so shall ever be; And they have commanded me to let
you know the true Answer to most of those things that are imputed either to the
Parliament, or to the City, by observing some particulars of This book which
has been read to you and to let you know the proceedings in their own native
condition, clear from those misrepresentations which make them appear in a
quality much different from the truth: which before I enter into I am to
declare as the Sense of both Houses that your petition was so full of Loyalty,
Humility, and Obedience, that you might well have expected an Answer of
another kind.

The first Observation I am to make to you is this, that it is said here, That
His Majesty was enforced by tumults to leave the Parliament, and to go from
White Hall, and to withdraw himself into those courses, which now he has
taken.

In Answer hereunto, I am commanded to tell you, that there was no occasion
given by any tumults rising out of this City or the Suburbs which might justly
cause His Majesty's departure, and you may very well remember, that after His
violent coming to the Commons House of Parliament in that unusual and unheard
of manner (which was the beginning of these unhappy differences) that the very
next day His Majesty came into the City without any Guard, that He was present
in the Common Council, dined at the Sheriffs, and returned back again, with
manifold evidences of fidelity on the part of the City, and without any such
expressions as were unbeseeming the Majesty of a King, or the duty of Subjects;
that He resided diverse days at White Hall, and afterward at Hampton Court,
Windsor, and places adjoining, with small Forces about him, and yet never any
attempt made which might give Him any apprehensions of fear; by all which it
is manifest, that this is an unjust aspersion cast upon this City, that any
tumultuous carriage of yours, was your occasion of His Majesty's leaving the
Parliament and withdrawing himself to remoter parts.

It is affirmed, that the Government of your City has been managed by a few
desperate persons, and that they do exercise an arbitrary power.] In answer to
which the two Houses of Parliament gives you this testimony, that you have in
most of the great occasions concerning the Government of the City, followed
their direction, and that direction which they have given, and you have
executed, they must and will maintain to be such as stands with their honor in
giving it, and your trust and fidelity in the performance of it.

It is objected in the third place; That Contributions have been publicly
made, for the maintenance of that Army which did join Battle with the King,
and did by all the means that Treason and Malice could suggest, endeavor to
take away His Life, and destroy His Issue.] To this I am commanded to say, That
the design of bringing up the English Armies, the gathering together of the
Cavaliers about White Hall, the violent coming to the House of Commons, the
Kings going into the North, and raising Arms there, are clear evidences that
violence was first intended, and diverse practices were made against the
Parliament, before they took any course, or made any preparation to take up
arms for their defense; for the danger of His Majesty's person they were sorry
for it, and did by diverse humble Petitions labor to prevent it; And as
touching the royal issue, they have sufficiently declared to the world, their
good affections toward them, by the care they have taken both for the safety
and maintenance of those who are left here.

It is further expressed in this Answer; That the King demands the Lord Major,
Master Alderman Fowke, Colonel Ven, and Colonel Manwaring, to be delivered up
as guilty of Schism and high Treason.] Concerning which, I am commanded to
tell you, as the sense of both Houses of PARLIAMENT, That this demand is
against the privilege of Parliament (two of them being Members of the Commons
House) most dishhonorable to the City, That the Lord Major of London should be
subjected to the violence of every base fellow, be assaulted, seized on,
without due process or Warrant, which the Law does afford every private man;
and that you should be commanded to deliver up your chief Magistrates, and such
eminent Members of the City to the Kings pleasure, only because they have done
their duty in adhering to the Parliament, for the defense of the Kingdom, and
that it is against the rules of justice, that any men should be imprisoned upon
such a general charge, when no particulars are proved against them; and this
you are to take notice of, as the answer to those scandalls, and to that
disgrace upon my Lord Major, and the other Members of the City.

And I am further to tell you, that there is little cause for His Majesty to
make this demand, considering that He Himself does by force keep away many
accused in Parliament, as my Lord Digby, and many more impeached of high
Treason, besides diverse others great Delinquents, that stand charged there for
heinous crimes, all which by force are kept from the due proceedings, and
legal trial in Parliament.

It is alleged in this Answer, That my Lord Mayor, and those other persons
named, are countenancers of Brownists, and Anabaptists, and all manner of
Sectaries.] To this I am commanded to say, That hereof there is no proof; It
does not appear that they give any such countenance to Sectaries of any kind
whatsoever; and if it did, His Majesty has little reason to object it, while
notwithstanding the profession he has often made, that he will maintain the
Protestant reformed Religion, he does in the mean time raise an Army of
Papists, who by the principles of their Religion are bound, (if power be put
into their hands) to destroy and utterly to root out the Protestants together
with the truth which they profess.

It is affirmed, That men's persons have been imprisoned, and their houses
plundered, because they will not rebel against His Majesty.] To this I am
commanded to declare, that no men's houses have been plundered by any direction
of the Parliament, but that they have been very careful to restrain all such
violent courses, so far as they were able; and that they have never committed
any man, but such men as by due information they conceived to be seditious
persons, and like to trouble the peace of the State.

It is objected further; That the Property of the Subject is destroyed by
taking away the twentieth part by an Arbitrary power.] To this they say, That
that Ordinance it does not require a twentieth part, but does limit the
Assessors, that they shall not go beyond a twentieth part; and that this is
done by a power derived from both houses of Parliament; the Lords who have an
hereditarie interest in making Laws in this Kingdom, and the Commons who are
elected and chosen to represent the whole body of the Comminalty, and trusted
for the good of the people, when ever they see cause to charge the Kingdom: And
they say further, that the same Law that did enable the two Houses of
Parliament to raise forces to maintain and defend the safety of Religion, and
of the Kingdom, does likewise enable them to require contributions, whereby
those forces may be maintained, or else it were a vain power to raise forces,
if they had not a power likewise to maintain them in that service for which
they were raised.

And to this point I am commanded to add this further answer, that there was
little reason for this to be objected on his Majesty's behalf, when it is well
known that from the subjects (which are within the power of his army) His
Majesty does take the full yearly value of their Lands, and in some cases more
that not only particular houses, but whole Towns have been plundered by command
and design; and that by Proclamations men are declared to forfeit all their
estates, because they will not obey Arbitrary Commands, and this is commonly
practiced by His Majesty, and on his part, and therefore there was little
reason to charge the Parliament with so necessary and moderate a contribution
as the twentieth part.

It is declared, That the King expects to be kept from Tumults and Affronts.]
Upon which, I am commanded to observe, that His Majesty's expressions in His
Answer tend to the making of a division in this City, and to the raising of a
party, which may make some disturbance in that orderly government which is now
established, both which will certainly prove equally destructive to him and
both Houses of Parliament; and more prejudicial to his quiet abode here, then
any thing that has ever been acted by the Houses of Parliament, or the
present Governors of the City.

They observe further that in this Answer, His Majesty does profess that He
will seize upon the estates of those that shall contribute any thing toward
the maintenance of the Parliaments Army, and will put them out of His
protection, and by His Ministers in foreign States, will take such course,
that they may be proceeded against as enemies; that is, destroyed and spoiled.]
To which the LORDS and COMMONS do Declare, That this is an excess of rigor
and injustice beyond all example, that particular men should lose their private
estates here without law or judicial proceeding: And that our Prince who owes
protection to the Kingdom, as well as to particular persons, should suffer the
wealth thereof to be robbed and spoiled by foreign States; upon due
consideration whereof, they hope His Majesty will be induced by better Council
to forbear the execution, then that by which he has been persuaded to publish
such a Resolution.

Besides these Observations out of the Answer, I am to observe one out of a
narrative that was received from the Common Council, that the King did Declare
that he would send some messengers here to observe your carriage in the City,
and what was done amongst you, the Parliament have just cause to doubt, that
these will be messengers of sedition and trouble, and therefore desire you to
observe them and find them out, and that they may know who they are.

I am for a conclusion to commend to your considerations, that you see by the
proceedings to which the King is drawn by the ill council now about Him, that
Religion, the whole Kingdom, this glorious City, and the Parliament, are all in
great danger, and that this danger cannot be kept off in all likelihood, but by
the Army that is now a foot, and that the Lords and Commons are so far from
being frighted by any thing that is in this Answer, that they have for
themselves and the Members of both Houses declared a further contribution
toward the maintenance of this Army, and cannot but hope and desire, that you
that have showed so much good affection in the former necessities of the State
will be sensible of your own, and of the condition of the whole Kingdom, and
add (to that which you have already done) some further contribution, whereby
this Army may be maintained for all your safeties.

At the end of every period of this Speech, the applause was so great, that he
was fain to rest till silence was again made; and at last (the Company ready to
be dissolved) after some pause and consultation with the Committee of Lords and
Commons then present, and by their direction (silence being made) he closed all
with the words following:

Worthy Citizens, you have understood the sense of both Houses of Parliament,
concerning my Lord Major here, and those worthy Members of your City, that are
demanded; you have heard the Parliament declare, that they will protect them in
that which they have done by direction of both Houses; and they expect that you
should express it your selves likewise, that if any violence be offered to
them, you will secure and defend them with your uttermost force; and you shall
always find, that this protection of the Parliament shall not only extend to
these, but to all others that have done any thing by their command.

Which words were no sooner uttered, but the Citizens with one joint harmony of
minds and voices, gave such an acclamation as would have drowned all the
former, if they had been then breathing, which after a long continuance
resolved it self into this more articulate and distinct voice, We will live and
dye with them, We will live and dye with them, and the like.

So that in the managing of this days work, God was so pleased to manifest
himself, that the well-affected went away not strengthened only, but
rejoicing; and the Malignants (as they have been called) some convinced, others
silenced, many ashamed; it fully appearing how little power they had to answer
their desires of doing mischief: whilst in stead of dividing the City, they
were exceedingly united; in stead of a dissipation, thousands were unexpectedly
brought (as it were) into an unthought of Association, to live and dye in the
defense of these zealous and honorable Assertors of their peace and liberties:
All which we may sum up in that triumph of the man of God: In the thing
wherein they dealt proudly, God was above them.

FINIS.
