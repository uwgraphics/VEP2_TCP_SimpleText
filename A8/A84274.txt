An excellent Ditty called the Shepherds Wooing Fair Dulcina.
To a new tune called Dulcina.


AS at noon Dulcina rested,
In her sweet and shady Bower,
Came a Shepherd and requested
in her arms to sleep an hour.
But from her look
A wound be took.
so far that for a farther boon,
The Nymphe he prays,
Wherefore she says
Forgo me now, come to me soon,
But in vain she did conjure him
for to leave her presence so.
Having thousand means to assure him
and but one to let him go.
Where lips invite
And eye delight.
and cheeks as fresh as Rose in June,
Persuades to stay
What boot's to say,
Forgo me now, etc,
Words, whose hopes have now enjoined
Him to let Dulcina sleep.
Could a man's love be co^ned
or a maid her promise keep
No for her Wast
he held her fast,
as she was constant to her tune,
And still she spoke,

He demands what time or leisure,
can there be more fit than now
She says, men may say their pleasure,
yet of it I do not allow
The Suns clear light
Shines more bright,
quoth he, more fairer then the Moon,
For her to praise
He loves he says,
Forgo me now, etc.
But no promise nor profession,
from his hands to purchase scope,
Who would sell the sweet possession
of such beauty for a hope,
Or for the fight
Of lingering night.
forgo the pleasant tops of noon,
Though none so fair,
Her speeches were,
Forgo me now, etc.
Now at last agreed, these Lovers
she was fair and he was young,
If you will believe me I will fell ye
true love stred lasts long:
He said my dear
My love not fear
bright Phoebus beams out-shines the moon
Dulcina prays
And to him says

DAy was spent, and night approuched
Venus fair was Lovers friend,
She entreated bright Apollo,
that his Steeds their race might end,
he could not say
this Goddess nay.
but granted loves fair Queen her boon
the Shepherd came
to this fair Dame,
Forgo me now, come to me soon.
Sweet he said as I did promise,
I am now returned again,
Long delay (you know) breeds hunger
and to lovers breeds pain,
the Nymph said then
Above all men,
^i^ welcome Shepherd morn and (...),
the Shepherds prays,
Dulcina says.
Shepherd I doubt thou art come, to soon
When that bright Aurora blushed,
came the Shepherd to his dear,
Pretty Birds most sweetly warbled,
and the noon approached near,
Yet still away

At length she s^^^
Be not afraid,

With their of heart the Shepherd hasted
up the Mountains to his flocks,
Then he took a Reed and pipes,
Echo founded through the Rocks
thus did he play,
and wished the day. (noon
Were spent, and night were come er'e
the silent night
Is loves delight.
I^le go to fair Dulcina soon.
Beautions Darling, fair Dulcina,
like to Venus for her love
Spent away the day in passion,
mourning like the Turtle Dove.
Meloveously
Notes low and high.
the Humbled forth this doleful tune
Oh come again
Sweet Shepherd swain,
Thou can not be with me too soon,
When that Theirs in her Palace,
had received the Prince of light,
Came in Coridon the Shepherd,
to his love and hearts delight.
then Pan did play,
the wood-nymps they
did (...)p and dance to hear the tune
Hymen did play
it is Holy Day.
