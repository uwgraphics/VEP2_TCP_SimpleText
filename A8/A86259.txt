HIS NOBLE NUMBERS: OR, HIS PIOUS PIECES, Wherein (amongst other things) he
sings the Birth of his CHRIST: and sighs for his Saviors suffering on the
Cross.

HESIOD. (...).
(...).
LONDON. Printed for John Williams, and Francis Eglesfield. 1647.

HIS Noble Numbers: OR, His pious Pieces.
His Confession.
LOok how our foul Days do exceed our fair;
And as our bad, more then our good Works are:
Even so those Lines, penned by my wanton Wit,
Treble the number of these good I Have writ.
Things precious are least numerous: Men are prone
To do ten Bad, for one Good Action.
His Prayer for Absolution.
FOr Those my unbaptized Rhimes,
Writ in my wild unhallowed Times;
For every sentence, clause and word,
That Is not inlaid with Thee, (my Lord)
Forgive me God, and blot each Line
Out of my Book, that is not Thine.
But if, amongst all, thou find'st here one
Worthy thy Benediction;
That One of all the rest, shall be
The Glory of my Work, and Me,
To find God.
WEigh me the Fire; or, can thou find
A way to measure out the Wind;
Distinguish all those Floods that are
Mixed in that watrie Theater;
And taste thou them as saltlesse there,
As in their Channel first they were.
Tell me the People that do keep
Within the Kingdoms of the Deep;
Or fetch me back that Cloud again,
Beshiver'd into seeds of Rain;
Tell me the motes, dust, sands, and spears
Of Corn, when Summer shakes his ears;
Show me that world of Stars, and whence
They noiselesse spill their Influence:
This if thou can; then show me Him
That rides the glorious Cherubim.
What God is.
GOD is above the sphere of our esteem,
And is the best known, not defining Him.
Upon God.
GOD is not only said to be
An Ens, but Supraentitie.
Mercy and Love.
GOD has two wings, which He does ever move,
The one is Mercy, and the next is Love:
Under the first the Sinners ever trust;
And with the last he still directs the Just.
Gods Anger without Affection.
GOD when He Is angry here with any one,
His wrath is free from perturbation;
And when we think His looks are sour and grim*
The alteration is in us, not Him.
God not to be comprehended.
It Is hard to find God, but to comprehend
Him, as He is, is labor without end.
Gods part.
PRayers and Praises are those spotless two
Lambs, by the Law, which God requires as due.
Affliction.
GOD n'ere afflicts us more then our desert,
Though He may seem to over-act His part:
Sometimes He strikes us more then flesh can bear;
But yet still less then Grace can suffer here.
Three fatal Sisters.
THree fatal Sisters wait upon each sin;
First, Fear and Shame without, then Guilt within.
Silence.
SUffer thy legs, but not thy tongue to walk:
God, the most Wise, is sparing of His talk.
Mirth.
TRue mirth resides not in the smiling skin:
The sweetest solace is to act no sin.
Loading and unloading.
GOD loads, and unloads, (thus His work begins)
To load with blessings, and unload from sins.
Gods Mercy.
GODS boundless mercy is (to sinful man)
Like to the ever-wealthy Ocean:
Which though it sends forth thousand streams, it is never
Known, or else seen to be the emptier:
And though it takes all in, it is yet no more
Full, and fild-full, then when full-fild before.
Prayers must have Poise.
GOD He rejects all Prayers that are slight,
And want their Poise: words ought to have their weight.
To God: an Anthem, sung in the Chapel at White Hall, before the King.
Verse.
MY God, I Am wounded by my sin,
And sore without, and sick within:
Ver. Chor.
I come to Thee, in hope to find
Salve for my body, and my mind.
Verse.
In Gilead though no Balm be found,
To ease this smart, or cure this wound;
Ver. Chor.
Yet, Lord, I know there is with Thee
All saving health, and help for me.
Verse.
Then reach Thou forth that hand of Thine,
That powers in oil, as well as wine.
Ver. Chor.
And let it work, for I Will endure
The utmost smart, so Thou will cure.
Upon God.
GOD is all forepart; for, we never see
Any part backward in the Deity.
Calling, and correcting.
GOD is not only merciful, to call
Men to repent, but when He strikes withal.
No escaping the scourging.
GOD scourges some severely, some He spares;
But all in smart have less, or greater shares.
The Rod.
GOds Rod does watch while men do sleep; and then
The Rod does sleep, while vigilant are men.
God has a twofold part.
GOD when for sin He makes His Children smart,
His own He acts not, but another part:
But when by stripes He saves them, then it is known,
He comes to play the part that is His own.
God is One.
GOD, as He is most Holy known;
So He is said to be most One.
Persecutions profitable.
AFflictions they most profitable are
To the beholder, and the sufferer:
Bettering them both, but by a double strain,
The first by patience, and the last by pain.
To God.
DO with me, God! as Thou did deal with John,
(Who writ that heavenly Revelation)
Let me (like him) first cracks of thunder hear;
Then let the Harps enchantments strike mine ear;
Here give me thorns; there, in thy Kingdom, set
Upon my head the golden coronet;
There give me day; but here my dreadful night:
My sackcloth here; but there my Stole of white.
Whips.
GOD has his whips here to a twofold end,
The bad to punish, and the good t'amend.
Gods Providence.
IF all transgressions here should have their pay,
What need there then be of a reckning day:
IF God should punish no sin, here, of men,
His Providence who would not question then?
Temptation.
THose Saints, which God loves best,
The Devil tempts not least.
His Ejaculation to God.
MY God! look on me with thine eye
Of pity, not of scrutinie;
For if thou do, thou then shall see
Nothing but loathsome sores in me.
O then! for mercies sake, behold
These my irruptions manifold;
And heal me with thy look, or touch:
But if thou will not deigne so much,
Because I Am odious in thy sight,
Speak but the word, and cure me quite.
Gods gifts not soon granted.
GOD hears us when we pray, but yet defers
His gifts, to exercise Petitioners:
And though a while He makes Requesters stay,
With Princely hand He Will recompense delay.
Persecutions purify.
GOD strikes His Church, but it is to this intent,
To make, not mar her, by this punishment:
So where He gives the bitter Pills, be sure,
It Is not to poison, but to make thee pure.
Pardon.
GOD pardons those, who do through frailty sin;
But never those that persevere therein.
An Ode of the Birth of our Savior.
1.
IN Numbers, and but these few,
I sing Thy Birth, Oh JESU!
Thou pretty Babie, borne here,
With sup'rabundant scorn here:
Who for Thy Princely Port here,
Had for Thy place
Of Birth, a base
Out-stable for thy Court here.
2.
Instead of neat Enclosures
Of inter-woven Osiers;
Instead of fragrant Posies
Of Daffadills, and Roses;
Thy cradle, Kingly Stranger,
As Gospel tells,
Was nothing else,
But, here, a homely manger.
3.
But we with Silks, (not Cruells)
With sundry precious Jewels,
And Lilly-work will dress Thee;
And as we dispossess thee
Of clouts, we will make a chamber,
Sweet Babe, for Thee,
Of Ivorie,
And plastered round with Amber.
4.
The Jews they did disdain Thee,
But we will entertain Thee
With Glories to await here
Upon Thy Princely State here,
And more for love, then pity.
From year to year
We Will make Thee, here,
A Freeborn of our City.
Lip-labor.
IN the old Scripture I have often read,
The calfe without meal n'ere was offered;
To figure to us, nothing more then this,
Without the heart, lip-labor nothing is.
The Heart.
IN Prayer the Lips never act the winning part,
Without the sweet concurrence of the Heart.
Eare-rings.
WHy wore the Egyptians Jewels in the Ear?
But for to teach us, all the grace is there,
When we obey, by acting what we hear.
Sin seen.
WHen once the sin has fully acted been,
Then is the horror of the trespass seen.
Upon Time.
TIme was upon
The wing, to fly away;
And I called on
Him but a while to stay;
But he would be gone,
For ought that I could say.
He held out then,
A Writing, as he went;
And asked me, when
False man would be content
To pay again,
What God and Nature lent.
An houre-glasse,
In which were sands but few,
As he did pass,
He showed, and told me too,
Mine end near was,
And so away he flew.
His Petition.
IF war, or want shall make me grow so poor,
As for to beg my bread from door to door;
Lord! let me never act that beggars part,
Who has thee in his mouth, not in his heart.
He who asks alms in that so sacred Name,
Without due reverence, plays the cheaters game.
To God.
THou have promised, Lord, to be
With me in my misery;
Suffer me to be so bold,
As to speak, Lord, say and hold.
His Letanie, to the Holy Spirit.
1.
IN the hour of my distress,
When temptations me oppress,
And when I my sins confess,
Sweet Spirit comfort me!
2.
When I lie within my bed,
Sick in heart, and sick in head,
And with doubts discomforted,
Sweet Spirit comfort me!
3.
When the house does sigh and weep,
And the world is drowned in sleep,
Yet mine eyes the watch do keep;
Sweet Spirit comfort me!
4.
When the artlesse Doctor fees
No one hope, but of his Fees,
And his skill runs on the lees;
Sweet Spirit comfort me!
5.
When his Potion and his Pill,
His, or none, or little skill,
Meet for nothing, but to kill;
Sweet Spirit comfort me!
6.
When the passing bell does tole,
And the Furies in a shole
Come to fright a parting soul;
Sweet Spirit comfort me!
7.
When the tapers now burn blew,
And the comforters are few,
And that number more then true;
Sweet Spirit comfort me!
8.
When the Priest his last has praid,
And I nod to what is said,
'Cause my speech is now decaid;
Sweet Spirit comfort me!
9.
When (God knows) I Am tossed about,
Either with despair, or doubt;
Yet before the glass be out,
Sweet Spirit comfort me!
10.
When the Tempter me pursu'th
With the sins of all my youth,
And half damns me with untruth;
Sweet Spirit comfort me!
11.
When the flames and hellish cries
Fright mine ears, and fright mine eyes,
And all terrors me surprise;
Sweet Spirit comfort me!
11.
When the Judgment is revealed,
And that opened which was sealed,
When to Thee I have appealed;
Sweet Spirit comfort me!
Thanksgiving.
THanksgiving for a former, does invite
God to bestow a second benefit.
Cock-crow.
BEll-man of Night, if I about shall go
For to deny my Master, do thou crow.
Thou stop'st S. Peter in the midst of sin;
Stay me, by crowing, ere I do begin;
Better it is, premonish'd, for to shun
A sin, then fall to weeping when it is done.
All things run well for the Righteous.
ADverse and prosperous Fortunes both work on
Here, for the righteous man's salvation:
Be he oppos^d, or be he not withstood,
All serve to the Augmentation of his good.
Pain ends in Pleasure.
AFflictions bring us joy in times to come,
When sins, by stripes, to us grow wearisome.
To God.
I Will come, I Will creep, (though Thou do threat
Humbly unto Thy Mercy-seat:
When I am there, this then I Will do,
Give Thee a Dart, and Dagger too;
Next, when I have my faults confessed,
Naked I Will show a sighing breast;
Which if that cannot Thy pity woo,
Then let Thy Justice do the rest,
And strike it through.
A Thanksgiving to God, for his House.
LOrd, Thou have given me a cell
Wherein to dwell;
And little house, whose humble Roof
Is weather-proof;
Under the sparres of which I lie
Both soft, and dry;
Where Thou my chamber for to ward
Have set a Guard
Of harmless thoughts, to watch and keep
Me, while I sleep.
Low is my porch, as is my Fate,
Both void of state;
And yet the threshold of my door
Is worn by the poor,
Who thither come, and freely get
Good words, or meat:
Like as my Parlour, so my Hall
And Kitchin's small:
A little Butterie, and therein
A little Been,
Which keeps my little loaf of Bread
Unchipt, unflead:
Some brittle sticks of Thorn or Briar
Make me a fire,
Close by whose living coal I sit,
And glow like it
Lord, I confess too, when I dine,
The Pulse is Thine,
And all those other Bits, that be
There placed by Thee;
The Worts, the Purslain, and the Mess
Of Water-cresse,
Which of Thy kindness Thou have sent;
And my content
Makes those, and my beloved Beet,
To be more sweet.
It Is thou that crown'st my glittering Hearth
With guiltless mirth;
And giv'st me Wassaile Bowls to drink,
Spic'd to the brink.
Lord, it is thy plenty-dropping hand,
That soiles my land;
And giv'st me, for my Bushel sown,
Twice ten for one:
Thou make my teeming Hen to lay
Her egg each day:
Besides my healthful Ewes to bear
Me twins each year:
The while the conduits of my Kine
Run Cream, (for Wine.)
All these, and better Thou do send
Me, to this end,
That I should render, for my part,
A thankful heart;
Which, fired with incense, I resign,
As wholly Thine;
But the acceptance, that must be,
My Christ, by Thee.
To God.
MAke, make me Thine, my gracious God,
Or with thy staff, or with thy rod;
And be the blow too what it will,
Lord, I will kiss it, though it kill:
Beat me, bruise me, rack me, rend me,
Yet, in torments, I Will commend Thee:
Examine me with fire, and prove me
To the full, yet I will love Thee:
Nor shall thou give so deep a wound,
But I as patient will be found.
Another, to God.
LOrd, do not beat me,
Since I do sob and cry,
And swowne away to die,
Ere Thou do threat me.
Lord, do not scourge me,
If I by lies and oaths
Have soiled my self, or clothes,
But rather purge me.
None truly happy here.
HAppy's that man, to whom God gives
A stock of Goods, whereby he lives
Near to the wishes of his heart:
No man is blessed through every part.
To his ever-loving God.
CAn I not come to Thee, my God, for these
So very-many-meeting hindrances,
That slack my pace; but yet not make me stay?
Who slowly goes, rids (in the end) his way.
Clear Thou my paths, or shorten Thou my miles,
Remove the bars, or lift me over the styles:
Since rough the way is, help me when I call,
And take me up; or else prevent the fall.
I kenn my home; and it affords some ease,
To see far off the smoking Villages.
Fain would I rest; yet covet not to die,
For fear of future-biting penury:
No, no, (my God) Thou know my wishes be
To leave this life, not loving it, but Thee.
Another.
THou bidst me come; I cannot come; for why,
Thou dwel'st aloft, and I want wings to fly.
To mount my Soul, she must have pineons given;
For, it is no easy way from Earth to Heaven.
To Death.
THou bidst me come away,
And I Will no longer stay,
Then for to shed some tears
For faults of former years;
And to repent some crimes,
Done in the present times:
And next, to take a bit
Of Bread, and Wine with it;
To d'on my robes of love,
Fit for the place above;
To gird my loins about
With charity throughout;
And so to travail hence
With feet of innocence:
These done, I Will only cry
God mercy; and so die.
Neutrality loathsome.
GOD will have all, or none; serve Him, or fall
Down before Baal, Bell, or Belial:
Either be hot, or cold: God does despise,
Abhor, and spew out all Neutralities.
Welcome what comes.
WHatever comes, let us be content withal:
Among Gods Blessings, there is no one small.
To his angry God.
THrough all the night
Thou do me fright.
And hold'st mine eyes from sleeping;
And day, by day,
My Cup can say,
My wine is mixed with weeping.
Thou do my bread
With ashes knead,
Each evening and each morrow:
Mine eye and ear
Do see, and hear
The coming in of sorrow.
Thy scourge of steel,
(Ay me!) I feel,
Upon me beating ever:
While my sick heart
With dismal smart
Is disacquainted never.
Long, long, I Am sure,
This cannot endure;
But in short time 'twill please Thee,
My gentle God,
To burn the rod,
Or strike so as to ease me.
Patience, or Comforts in Crosses.
ABundant plagues I late have had,
Yet none of these have made me sad:
For why, my Savior, with the sense
Of suffering gives me patience.
Eternity.
1
O Years! and Age! Farewell:
Behold I go,
Where I do know
Infinity to dwell.
2
And these mine eyes shall see
All times, how they
Are lost in the Sea
Of vast Eternity.
3
Where never Moon shall sway
The Stars; but she,
And Night, shall be
Drowned in one endless Day.
To his Savior, a Child; a Present, by a child.
GO pretty child, and bear this Flower
Unto thy little Savior;
And tell Him, by that Bud now blown,
He is the Rose of Sharon known:
When thou have said so, stick it there
Upon his Bibb, or Stomacher:
And tell Him, (for good handsell too)
That thou have brought a Whistle new,
Made of a clean strait oaten reed,
To charm his cries, (at time of need:)
Tell Him, for Coral, thou have none;
But if thou had, He should have one;
But poor thou art, and known to be
Even as monilesse, as He.
Lastly, if thou can win a kiss
From those mellifluous lips of his;
Then never take a second on,
To spoil the first impression.
The New-yeeres Gift.
LEt others look for Pearl and Gold,
Tissues, or Tabbies manifold:
One only lock of that sweet Hay
Whereon the blessed Babie lay,
Or one poor Swadling-clout, shall be
The richest New-yeeres Gift to me.
To God.
IF any thing delight me for to print
My Book, it is this; that Thou, my God, art in it.
God, and the King.
HOw am I bound to Two! God, who does give
The mind; the King, the means whereby I live.
Gods mirth, Man's mourning.
WHere God is merry, there write down thy fears:
What He with laughter speaks, hear thou with tears.
Honors are hindrances.
GIve me Honors: what are these,
But the pleasing hindrances?
Styles, and stops, and stays, that come
In the way 'twixt me, and home:
Clear the walk, and then shall I
To my heaven less run, then fly.
The Parasceve, or Preparation.
TO a Love-Feast we both invited are:
The figured Damask, or pure Diaper,
Over the golden Altar now is spread,
With Bread, and Wine, and Vessels furnished;
The sacred Towell, and the holy Eure
Are ready by, to make the Guests all pure:
Let Us go (my Alma) yet e're we receive,
Fit, fit it is, we have our Parasceve.
Who to that sweet Bread unprepared does come
Better he starved, then but to taste one crumme.
To God.
GOD gives not only corn, for need,
But likewise sup'rabundant seed;
Bread for our service, bread for show;
Meat for our meals, and fragments too:
He gives not poorly, taking some
Between the finger, and the thumb;
But, for our glut, and for our store,
Fine flower pressed down, and running over.
A will to be working.
ALthough we cannot turn the fervent fit
Of sin, we must strive against the stream of it:
And howsoever we have the conquest mist;
It Is for our glory, that we did resist.
Christ's part.
CHRIST, He requires still, wheresoere He comes,
To feed, or lodge, to have the best of Rooms:
Give Him the choice; grant Him the nobler part
Of all the House: the best of all is the Heart.
Riches and Poverty.
GOD co'd have made all rich, or all men poor;
But why He did not, let me tell wherefore:
Had all been rich, where then had Patience been?
Had all been poor, who had His Bounty seen?
Sobriety in Search.
TO seek of God more then we well can find,
Argues a strong distemper of the mind.
Alms.
GIve, if thou can, an Alms; if not, afford,
Instead of that, a sweet and gentle word:
God crowns our goodness, when He sees,
On our part, wanting all abilities.
To his Conscience.
CAn I not sin, but thou will be
My private Protonotarie?
Can I not woo thee to pass by
A short and sweet iniquity?
I Will cast a mist and cloud, upon
My delicate transgression,
So utter dark, as that no eye
Shall see the hugged impiety:
Gifts blind the wise, and bribes do please,
And wind all other witnesses:
And wilt not thou, with gold; be ti'd
To lay thy pen and ink aside?
That in the mirk and tonguelesse night,
Wanton I may, and thou not write?
It will not be: And, therefore, now,
For times to come, I Will make this Vow,
From aberrations to live free;
So I Will not fear the Judge, or thee.
To his Savior.
LORD, I confess, that Thou alone art able
To purify this my Augean stable:
Be the Seas water, and the Land all Soap,
Yet if Thy Blood not wash me, there is no hope.
To God.
GOD is all-sufferance here; here He does show
No Arrow nockt, only a stringlesse Bow:
His Arrows fly; and all his stones are hurled
Against the wicked, in another world.
His Dream.
I Dreamt, last night, Thou did transfuse
Oil from Thy Jarre, into my creuze;
And pouring still, Thy wealthy store,
The vessel full, did then run ore:
Me thought, I did Thy bounty chide,
To see the waste; but 'twas replied
By Thee, Dear God, God gives man seed
Oft-times for wast, as for his need.
Then I co'd say, that house is bare,
That has not bread, and some to spare.
Gods Bounty.
GOds Bounty, that ebbs less and less,
As men do wane in thankfulness.
To his sweet Savior.
NIght has no wings, to him that cannot sleep;
And Time seems then, not for to fly, but creep;
Slowly her chariot drives, as if that she
Had broke her wheel, or cracked her axeltree.
Just so it is with me, who listening, pray
The winds, to blow the tedious night away;
That I might see the cheerful peeping day.
Sick is my heart; O Savior! do Thou please
To make my bed soft in my sicknesses:
Lighten my candle, so that I beneath
Sleep not for ever in the vaults of death:
Let me Thy voice betimes in the morning hear;
Call, and I Will come; say Thou, the when, and where:
Draw me, but first, and after Thee I Will run,
And make no one stop, till my race be done.
His Creed.
I Do believe, that die I must,
And be returned from out my dust:
I do believe, that when I rise,
Christ I shall see, with these same eyes:
I do believe, that I must come,
With others, to the dreadful Doom:
I do believe, the bad must go
From thence, to everlasting woe:
I do believe, the good, and I,
Shall live with Him eternally:
I do believe, I shall inherit
Heaven, by Christ's mercies, not my merit:
I do believe, the One in Three,
And Three in perfect Unity:
Lastly, that JESUS is a Deed
Of Gift from God: And here is my Creed.
Temptations.
TEmptations hurt not, though they have access:
Satan o'recomes none, but by willingness.
The Lamp.
WHen a man's Faith is frozen up, as dead;
Then is the Lamp and oil extinguished.
Sorrows.
Sorrows our portion are: Ere hence we go,
Crosses we must have; or, hereafter woe.
Penitencie.
A Man's transgression God does then remit,
When man he makes a Penitent for it.
The Dirge of Jephthahs Daughter: sung by the Virgins.
1
O Thou, the wonder of all days!
O Paragon, and Pearl of praise!
O Virgin-martyr, ever blessed
Above the rest
Of all the Maiden-Traine! We come,
And bring fresh strewings to thy Tomb.
2
Thus, thus, and thus we compass round
Thy harmless and unhaunted Ground;
And as we sing thy Dirge, we will
The Daffadill,
And other flowers, lay upon
(The Altar of our love) thy Stone.
3
Thou wonder of all Maids, li'st here,
Of Daughters all, the Dearest Dear;
The eye of Virgins; nay, the Queen
Of this smooth Green,
And all sweet Meades; from whence we get
The Primrose, and the Violet.
4
Too soon, too dear did Jephthah buy,
By thy sad loss, our liberty:
His was the Bond and Covenant, yet
Thou paid'st the debt,
Lamented Maid! he won the day,
But for the conquest thou did pay.
5
Thy Father brought with him along
The Olive branch, and Victors Song:
He slew the Ammonites, we know,
But to thy woe;
And in the purchase of our Peace,
The Cure was worse then the Disease.
6
For which obedient zeal of thine,
We offer here, before thy Shrine,
Our sighs for Storax, tears for Wine;
And to make fine,
And fresh thy Herse-cloth, we will, here,
Four times bestrew thee every year.
7
Receive, for this thy praise, our tears:
Receive this offering of our Hairs:
Receive these Crystal Vialls filled
With tears, distilled
From teeming eyes; to these we bring,
Each Maid, her silver Filleting,
8
To guild thy Tomb; besides, these Caules,
These Laces, Ribbands, and these Faules,
These Veiles, wherewith we use to hide
The Bashful Bride,
When we conduct her to her Groom:
All, all we lay upon thy Tomb.
9
No more, no more, since thou art dead,
Shall we ere bring coy Brides to bed;
No more, at yearly Festivalls
We Cowslip balls,
Or chains of Columbines shall make,
For this, or that occasions sake.
10
No, no; our Maiden-pleasures be
Wrapped in the winding sheet, with thee:
It Is we are dead, though not in the grave:
Or, if we have
One seed of life left, it is to keep
A Lent for thee, to fast and weep.
11
Sleep in thy peace, thy bed of Spice;
And make this place all Paradise:
May Sweets grow here! and smoke from hence,
Fat Frankincense:
Let Balm, and Cassia send their scent
From out thy Maiden-Monument.
12
May no Wolf howl, or Screech-Owle stir
A wing about thy Sepulcher!
No boisterous winds, or storms, come hither,
To starve, or wither
Thy soft sweet Earth! but (like a spring)
Love keep it ever flourishing.
13
May all shie Maids, at wonted hours,
Come forth, to strew thy Tomb with flowers:
May Virgins, when they come to mourn,
Male-Incense burn
Upon thine Altar! then return,
And leave thee steeping in thy Urn.
To God, on his sickness.
WHat though my Harp, and Violl be
Both hung upon the Willow-tree?
What though my bed be now my grave,
And for my house I darkness have?
What though my healthful days are fled,
And I lie numbered with the dead?
Yet I have hope, by Thy great power,
To spring; though now a withered flower.
Sins loathed, and yet loved.
SHame checks our first attempts; but then it is proved,
Sins first disliked, are after that beloved.
Sin.
SIn leads the way, but as it goes, it feels
The following plague still treading on his heels.
Upon God.
GOD when He takes my goods and chattels hence,
Gives me a portion, giving patience:
What is in God is God; if so it be,
He patience gives; He gives himself to me.
Faith.
WHat here we hope for, we shall once inherit:
By Faith we all walk here, not by the Spirit.
Humility.
HUmble we must be, if to Heaven we go:
High is the roof there; but the gate is low:
When e're thou speak, look with a lowly eye:
Grace is increased by humility.
Tears.
OUr present Tears here (not our present laughter)
Are but the handsells of our joys hereafter.
Sin and Strife.
AFter true sorrow for our sins, our strife
Must last with Satan, to the end of life.
An Ode, or Psalm, to God.
DEer God,
If thy smart Rod
Here did not make me sorry,
I should not be
With Thine, or Thee,
In Thy eternal Glory.
But since
Thou did convince
My sins, by gently striking;
Add still to those
First stripes, new blows,
According to Thy liking.
Fear me,
Or scourging tear me;
That thus from vices driven,
I may from Hell
Fly up, to dwell
With Thee, and Thine in Heaven.
Graces for Children.
WHat God gives, and what we take,
It Is a gift for Christ His sake:
Be the meal of Beans and Pease,
God be thanked for those, and these:
Have we flesh, or have we fish,
All are Fragments from His dish.
He His Church save, and the King,
And our Peace here, like a Spring,
Make it ever flourishing.
God to be first served.
Honor thy Parents; but good manners call
Thee to adore thy God, the first of all.
Another Grace for a Child.
HEre a little child I stand,
Heaving up my either hand;
Cold as Paddocks though they be,
Here I lift them up to Thee,
For a Benizon to fall
On our meat, and on us all. Amen.
A Christmas Caroll, sung to the King in the Presence at White Hall.
Chor.
WHat sweeter music can we bring,
Then a Caroll, for to sing
The Birth of this our heavenly King?
Awake the Voice! Awake the String!
Heart, Ear, and Eye, and every thing
Awake! the while the active Finger
Runs division with the Singer.
From the Flourish they came to the Song.
1
Dark and dull night, fly hence away,
And give the honor to this Day,
That sees December turned to May.
2
If we may ask the reason, say;
The why, and wherefore all things here
Seem like the Springtime of the year?
3
Why does the chilling Winters morn
Smile, like a field beset with corn?
Or smell, like to a Meade new-shorne,
Thus, on the sudden? 4. Come and see
The cause, why things thus fragrant be:
It Is He is borne, whose quickening Birth
Gives life and luster, public mirth,
To Heaven, and the under-Earth.
Chor.
We see Him come, and know him ours,
Who, with His Sunshine, and His showers,
Turns all the patient ground to flowers.
1
The Darling of the world is come,
And fit it is, we find a room
To welcome Him. 2. The nobler part
Of all the house here, is the heart,
Chor.
Which we will give Him; and bequeath
This Hollie, and this Ivy Wreath,
To do Him honor; who is our King,
And Lord of all this Revelling.
The Musical Part was composed by M. Henry Laws.
The New-yeeres Gift, or Circumcisions Song, sung to the King in the Presence
at White Hall.
1
PRepare for Songs; He Is come, He Is come;
And be it sin here to be dumb,
And not with Lutes to fill the room.
2
Cast Holy Water all about,
And have a care no fire gos out,
But 'cense the porch, and place throughout.
3
The Altars all on fire be;
The Storax fries; and ye may see,
How heart and hand do all agree,
To make things sweet.
Chor.
Yet all less sweet then He.
4
Bring Him along, most pious Priest,
And tell us then, when as thou see
His gently-gliding, Dove-like eyes,
And hear'st His whimp'ring, and His cries;
How can thou this Babe circumcise?
5
Ye must not be more pitiful then wise;
For, now unless ye see Him bleed,
Which makes the Bapti'me; it is decreed,
The Birth is fruitless:
Chor.
Then the work God speed.
1
Touch gently, gently touch; and here
Spring Tulips up through all the year;
And from His sacred Blood, here shed,
May Roses grow, to crown His own dear Head.
Chor.
Back, back again; each thing is done
With zeal alike, as 'twas begun;
Now singing, homeward let us carry
The Babe unto His Mother Marie;
And when we have the Child commended
To her warm bosom, then our Rites are ended.
Composed by M. Henry Laws.
Another New-yeeres Gift, or Song for the Circumcision.
1
HEnce, hence profane, and none appear
With any thing unhallowed, here:
No jot of Leven must be found
Concealed in this most holy Ground.
2
What is corrupt, or sowr'd with sin,
Leave that without, then enter in;
Chor.
But let no Christmas mirth begin
Before ye purge, and circumcise
Your hearts, and hands, lips, ears, and eyes.
3
Then, like a perfumed Altar, see
That all things sweet, and clean may be:
For, here is a Babe, that (like a Bride)
Will blush to death, if ought be spied
Ill-scenting, or unpurifi'd.
Chor.
The room is cens'd: help, help t'invoke
Heaven to come down, the while we choke
The Temple, with a cloud of smoke.
4
Come then, and gently touch the Birth
Of Him, who is Lord of Heaven and Earth;
5
And softly handle Him: y'ad need,
Because the pretty Babe does bleed.
Poore-pittied Child! who from Thy Stall
Bring'st, in Thy Blood, a Balm, that shall
Be the best New-yeares Gift to all.
1
Let Us bless the Babe: And, as we sing
His praise; so let us bless the King:
Chor.
Long may He live, till He has told
His New-yeeres trebled to His old:
And, when that is done, to re-aspire
A newborn Phoenix from His own chaste fire.
Gods Pardon.
WHen I shall sin, pardon my trespass here;
For, once in hell, none knows Remission there.
Sin.
SIn once reached up to Gods eternal Sphere,
And was committed, not remitted there.
Evil.
Evil no Nature has; the loss of good
Is that which gives to sin a livelihood.
The Star-Song: A Caroll to the King; sung at White Hall. The Flourish of
Music: then followed the Song.
1
TEll us, thou clear and heavenly Tongue,
Where is the Babe but lately sprung?
Lies He the Lillie-banks among?
2
Or say, if this new Birth of ours
Sleeps, laid within some Ark of Flowers,
Spangled with deaw-light; thou can clear
All doubts, and manifest the where.
3
Declare to us, bright Star, if we shall seek
Him in the Mornings blushing cheek,
Or search the beds of Spices through,
To find him out?
Star.
No, this ye need not do;
But only come, and see Him rest
A Princely Babe in's Mothers Breast.
Chor.
He Is seen, He Is seen, why then a Round,
Let Us kiss the sweet and holy ground;
And all rejoice, that we have found
A King, before conception crowned.
4
Come then, come then, and let us bring
Unto our pretty Twelfth-Tide King,
Each one his several offering;
Chor.
And when night comes, we will give Him wassailing:
And that His treble Honors may be seen,
We Will choose Him King, and make His Mother Queen.
To God.
WIth golden Censers, and with Incense, here,
Before Thy Virgin-Altar I appear,
To pay Thee that I owe, since what I see
In, or without; all, all belongs to Thee:
Where shall I now begin to make, for one
Least loan of Thine, half Restitution?
Alas! I cannot pay a jot; therefore
I Will kiss the Tally, and confess the score.
Ten thousand Talents lent me, Thou do write:
It Is true, my God; but I cannot pay one mite.
To his dear God.
I Will hope no more,
For things that will not come;
And, if they do, they prove but cumbersome;
Wealth brings much woe:
And, since it fortunes so;
It Is better to be poor,
Then so t'abound,
As to be drowned,
Or overwhelmed with store.
Pale care, avaunt,
I Will learn to be content
With that small stock, Thy Bounty gave or lent.
What may conduce
To my most healthful use,
Almighty God me grant;
But that, or this,
That hurtful is,
Deny Thy suppliant.
To God, his good will.
GOld I have none, but I present my need,
O Thou, that crown'st the will, where wants the deed.
Where Rams are wanting, or large Bullocks thighs,
There a poor Lamb's a plenteous sacrifice.
Take then his Vows, who, if he had it, would
Devote to Thee, both incense, myrrh, and gold,
Upon an Altar reared by Him, and crowned
Both with the Rubie, Pearl, and Diamond.
On Heaven.
PErmit mine eyes to see
Part, or the whole of Thee,
O happy place!
Where all have Grace,
And Garlands shared,
For their reward;
Where each chaste Soul
In long white stole,
And Palms in hand,
Do ravished stand;
So in a ring,
The praises sing
Of Three in One,
That fill the Throne;
While Harps, and Vlolls then
To Voices, say, Amen.
The Sum, and the Satisfaction.
LAst night I drew up mine Account,
And found my Debits to amount
To such a height, as for to tell
How I should pay, 's impossible:
Well, this I Will do; my mighty score
Thy mercy-seat I Will lay before;
But therewithal I Will bring the Band,
Which, in full force, did daring stand,
Till my Redeemer (on the Tree)
Made void for millions, as for me.
Then, if Thou bidst me pay, or go
Unto the prison, I Will say, no;
Christ having paid, I nothing owe:
For, this is sure, the Debt is dead
By Law, the Bond once cancelled.
Good men afflicted most.
GOD makes not good men wantons, but does bring
Them to the field, and, there, to skirmishing;
With trialls those, with terrors these He proves,
And hazards those most, whom the most He loves:
For Sceva, darts; for Cocles, dangers; thus
He finds a fire for mighty Mutius;
Death for stout Cato; and besides all these,
A poison too He has for Socrates;
Torments for high Attilius; and, with want,
Brings in Fabricius for a Combatant:
But, bastard-slips, and such as He dislikes,
He never brings them once to the push of Pikes.
Good Christians
PLay their offensive and defensive parts,
Till they be hid over with a wood of darts.
The Will the cause of Woe.
WHen man is punished, he is plagued still,
Not for the fault of Nature, but of will.
To Heaven.
OPen thy gates
To him, who weeping waits,
And might come in,
But that held back by sin.
Let mercy be
So kind, to set me free,
And I will strait
Come in, or force the gate.
The Recompense.
ALL I have lost, that co'd be rapt from me;
And fare it well: yet Herrick, if so be
Thy Dearest Savior renders thee but one
Smile, that one smile's full restitution.
To God.
PArdon me God, (once more I Thee entreat)
That I have placed Thee in so mean a seat,
Where round about Thou see but all things vain,
Uncircumsised, unseason'd, and profane.
But as Heavens public and immortal Eye
Looks on the filth, but is not soiled thereby;
So Thou, my God, may on this impure look,
But take no tincture from my sinful Book:
Let but one beam of Glory on it shine,
And that will make me, and my Work divine.
To God.
LOrd, I am like to Misletoe,
Which has no root, and cannot grow,
Or prosper, but by that same tree
It clings about; so I by Thee.
What need I then to fear at all,
So long as I about Thee craule?
But if that Tree should fall, and die,
Tumble shall heaven, and down will I.
His wish to God.
I Would to God, that mine old age might have
Before my last, but here a living grave,
Some one poor Almes-house; there to lie, or stir,
Ghost-like, as in my meaner sepulcher;
A little piggin, and a pipkin by,
To hold things fitting my necessity;
Which, rightly used, both in their time and place,
Might me excite to fore, and after-grace.
Thy Cross, my Christ, fixed before mine eyes should be,
Not to adore that, but to worship Thee.
So, here the remnant of my days I Would spend,
Reading Thy Bible, and my Book; so end.
Satan.
WHen we against Satan stoutly fight, the more
He tears and tugs us, then he did before;
Neglecting once to cast a frown on those
Whom ease makes his, without the help of blows.
Hell.
HEll is no other, but a soundlesse pit,
Where no one beam of comfort peeps in it.
The way.
WHen I a ship see on the Seas,
Cuft with those watrie savages,
And therewithal, behold, it has
In all that way no beaten path;
Then, with a wonder, I confess,
Thou art our way in the wilderness:
And while we blunder in the dark,
Thou art our candle there, or spark.
Great grief, great glory.
THe less our sorrows here and sufferings cease,
The more our Crowns of Glory there increase.
Hell.
HEll is the place where whipping-cheer abounds,
But no one Jailor there to wash the wounds.
The Bell-man.
A Long the dark, and silent night,
With my Lantern, and my Light,
And the tinkling of my Bell,
Thus I walk, and this I tell:
Death and dreadfulnesse call on,
To the general Session;
To whose dismal Bar, we there
All accounts must come to clear:
Scores of sins w'ave made here many,
Wiped out few, (God knows) if any.
Rise ye Debtors then, and fall
To make payment, while I call.
Ponder this, when I am gone;
By the clock it is almost One.
The goodness of his God.
WHen Winds and Seas do rage,
And threaten to undo me,
Thou do their wrath assuage,
If I but call unto Thee.
A mighty storm last night
Did seek my soul to swallow,
But by the peep of light
A gentle calm did follow.
What need I then despair,
Though ills stand round about me;
Since mischiefs neither dare
To bark, or bite, without Thee?
The Widows tears: or, Dirge of Dorcas.
1
COme pity us, all ye, who see
Our Harps hung on the Willow-tree:
Come pity us, ye Passers by,
Who see, or hear poor Widows cry:
Come pity us; and bring your ears,
And eyes, to pity Widows tears.
Chor.
And when you are come hither;
Then we will keep
A Fast, and weep
Our eyes out all together.
2.
For Tabitha, who dead lies here,
Clean washed, and laid out for the Beer;
O modest Matrons, weep and wail!
For now the Corn and Wine must fail:
The Basket and the Bynn of Bread,
Wherewith so many souls were fed
Chor.
Stand empty here for ever:
And ah! the Poor,
At thy worn Door,
Shall be releeved never.
3.
Woe worth the Time, woe worth the day,
That reav'd us of thee Tabitha!
For we have lost, with thee, the Meal,
The Bits, the Morsells, and the deal
Of gentle Paste, and yielding Dow,
That Thou on Widows did bestow.
Chor.
All Is gone, and Death has taken
Away from us
Our Maundie; thus,
Thy Widows stand forsaken.
4.
Ah Dorcas, Dorcas! now adieu
We bid the Creuse and Pannier too:
I and the flesh, for and the fish,
Dol'd to us in That Lordly dish.
We take our leaves now of the Loome,
From whence the house-wives cloth did come:
Chor.
The web affords now nothing;
Thou being dead,
The woosted thread
Is cut, that made us clothing.
5.
Farewell the Flax and Reaming wool,
With which thy house was plentiful.
Farewell the Coats, the Garments, and
The Sheets, the Rugs, made by thy hand.
Farewell thy Fire and thy Light,
That never went out by Day or Night:
Chor.
No, or thy zeal so speedy,
That found a way
By peep of day,
To feed and cloth the Needy.
6.
But, ah, alas! the Almond Bough,
And Olive Branch is withered now.
The Wine Press now is taken from us,
The Saffron and the Calamus.
The Spice and Spiknard hence is gone,
The Storax and the Cynamon,
Chor.
The Caroll of our gladness
Has taken wing,
And our late spring
Of mirth is turned to sadness.
7.
How wise wast thou in all thy ways!
How worthy of respect and praise!
How Matron-like did thou go dressed!
How soberly above the rest
Of those that prank it with their Plumes;
And jet it with their choice purfumes.
Chor.
Thy vestures were not flowing:
Nor did the street
Accuse thy feet
Of mincing in their going.
8.
And though thou here li'st dead, we see
A deal of beauty yet in thee.
How sweetly shows thy smiling face,
Thy lips with all diffused grace!
Thy hands (though cold) yet spotless, white,
And comely as the Chrysolite.
Chor.
Thy belly like a hill is,
Or as a neat
Clean heap of wheat,
All set about with Lillies.
Sleep with thy beauties here, while we
Will show these garments made by thee;
These were the Coats, in these are read
The monuments of Dorcas dead.
These were thy Acts, and thou shall have
These hung, as honors over thy Grave,
Chor.
And after us (distressed)
Should fame be dumb;
Thy very Tomb
Would cry out, Thou art blessed.
To God, in time of plundering.
RApine has yet took naught from me;
But if it please my God, I be
Brought at the last to the utmost bit,
God make me thankful still for it.
I have been grateful for my store:
Let me say grace when there is no more.
To his Savior. The New years gift.
THat little pretty bleeding part
Of Foreskin send to me:
And I Will return a bleeding Heart,
For New-yeers gift to thee.
Rich is the Jemme that thou did send,
Mine Is faulty too, and small:
But yet this Gift Thou will commend,
Because I send Thee all.
Doomes-Day.
LEt not that Day Gods Friends and Servants scare*
The Bench is then their place; and not the Bar.
The Poores Portion.
THe sup'rabundance of my store,
That is the portion of the poor:
Wheat, Barley, Rye, or Oats; what is it
But he takes tole of? all the Griest.
Two raiments have I: Christ then makes
This Law; that He and I part stakes.
Or have I two loaves; then I use
The poor to cut, and I to choose.
The white Island: or place of the Blessed.
IN this world (the Isle of Dreams)
While we sit by sorrows streams,
Tears and terrors are our theames
Reciting:
But when once from hence we fly,
More and more approaching nigh
Unto young Eternity
Uniting:
In that whiter Island, where
Things are evermore sincere;
Candor here, and luster there
Delighting:
There no monstrous fancies shall
Out of hell an horror call,
To create (or cause at all)
Affrighting.
There in calm and cooling sleep
We our eyes shall never steep;
But eternal watch shall keep,
Attending
Pleasures, such as shall pursue
Me immortalized, and you;
And fresh joys, as never too
Have ending.
To Christ.
I Crawle, I creep; my Christ, I come
To Thee, for curing Balsamum:
Thou have, nay more, Thou art the Tree,
Affording salve of Soveraigntie.
My mouth I Will lay unto Thy wound
Bleeding, that no Blood touch the ground:
For, rather then one drop shall fall
To wast, my JESU, I Will take all.
To God.
GOD! to my little meal and oil,
Add but a bit of flesh, to boil:
And Thou my Pipkinnet shall see,
Give a wave-offring unto Thee.
Free Welcome.
GOD He refuses no man; but makes way
For All that now come, or hereafter may.
Gods Grace.
GODS Grace deserves here to be daily fed,
That, thus increast, it might be perfected.
Coming to Christ.
TO him, who longs unto his CHRIST to go,
Celerity even it self is slow.
Correction.
GOD had but one Son free from sin; but none
Of all His sons free from correction.
Gods Bounty.
GOD, as He Is potent, so He Is likewise known,
To give us more then Hope can fix upon.
Knowledge.
SCience in God, is known to be
A Substance, not a Quality.
Salutation.
CHRIST, I have read, did to His Chaplains say,
Sending them forth, Salute no man by the way:
Not, that He taught His Ministers to be
Unsmooth, or sour, to all civilitie;
But to instruct them, to avoid all snares
Of tardidation in the Lords Affairs.
Manners are good: but till his errand ends,
Salute we must, nor Strangers, Kin, or Friends.
Lasciviousness.
Lasciviousness is known to be
The sister to saturitie.
Tears.
GOD from our eyes all tears hereafter wipes,
And gives His Children kisses then, not stripes.
Gods Blessing.
IN vain our labors are, whatsoever they be,
Unless God gives the Benedicite.
God, and Lord.
GOD, is His Name of Nature; but that word
Implies His Power, when He Is called the LORD.
The Iudgment-Day.
GOD hides from man the reckoning Day, that He
May fear it ever for uncertaintie:
That being ignorant of that one, he may
Expect the coming of it every day.
Angels.
Angels are called Gods; yet of them, none
Are Gods, but by participation:
As Just Men are entitled Gods, yet none
Are Gods, of them, but by Adoption.
Long life.
THe longer thread of life we spin,
The more occasion still to sin.
Tears.
THe tears of Saints more sweet by far,
Then all the songs of sinners are.
Manna.
THat Manna, which God on His people cast,
Fitted it self to every Feeders taste.
Reverence.
TRue reverence is (as Cassiadore does prove)
The fear of God, commixt with cleanly love.
Mercy.
MErcy, the wise Athenians held to be
Not an Affection, but a Deity.
Wages.
AFter this life, the wages shall
Not shared alike be unto all.
Temptation.
GOD tempts no one (as S. Aug'stine says)
For any ill; but, for the proof of Faith:
Unto temptation God exposes some;
But none, of purpose, to be overcome.
Gods hands.
GOds Hands are round, and smooth, that gifts may fall
Freely from them, and hold none back at all.
Labor.
Labor we must, and labor hard
In The Forum here, or Vineyard.
Mora Sponsi, the stay of the Bridegroom.
THe time the Bridegroom stays from hence,
Is but the time of penitence.
Roaring.
ROaring is nothing but a weeping part,
Forced from the mighty dolor of the heart.
The Eucharist.
HE that is hurt seeks help: sin is the wound;
The salve for this in the Eucharist is found.
Sin severely punished.
GOD in His own Day will be then severe,
To punish great sins, who small faults whipped here.
Montes Scripturarum, the Mounts of the Scriptures.
THe Mountains of the Scriptures are (some say)
Moses, and Jesus, called Joshua:
The Prophets Mountains of the Old are meant;
The Apostles Mounts of the New Testament.
Prayer.
A Prayer, that is said alone,
Starves, having no companion.
Great things ask for, when thou do pray,
And those great are, which never decay.
Pray not for silver, rust eats this;
Ask not for gold, which metal is:
Nor yet for houses, which are here
But earth: such vows nere reach Gods ear.
Christ's sadness.
CHrist was not sad, in the garden, for His own
Passion, but for His sheeps dispersion.
God hears us.
GOD, who is in Heaven, will hear from thence;
If not to the sound, yet, to the sense.
God.
GOD (as the learned Damascen does write)
A Sea of Substance is, Indefinite.
Clouds.
HE that ascended in a cloud, shall come
In clouds, descending to the public Doom.
Comforts in contentions.
THe same, who crowns the Conqueror, will be
A Coadjutor in the Agony.
Heaven.
Heaven is most fair; but fairer He
That made that fairest Canopie.
God.
IN God there is nothing, but it is known to be
Even God Himself, in perfect Entitie.
His Power.
GOD can do all things, save but what are known
For to imply a contradiction.
Christ's words on the Cross, My God, My God.
CHRIST, when He hung the dreadful Cross upon,
Had (as it were) a Dereliction;
In this regard, in those great terrors He
Had no one Beam from Gods sweet Majesty.
JEHOVAH.
JEHOVAH, as Boethius says,
No number of the Plural has.
Confusion of face.
GOd then confounds man's face, when He not hears
The Vows of those, who are Petitioners.
Another.
THe shame of man's face is no more
Then prayers repel'd, (says Cassiodore.)
Beggars.
Jacob Gods Beggar was; and so we wait
(Though never so rich) all beggars at His Gate.
Good, and bad.
THe Bad among the Good are here mixed ever:
The Good without the Bad are here placed never.
Sin.
SIn no Existence; Nature none it has,
Or Good at all, ( as learned Aquinas says.)
Martha, Martha.
THe repetition of the name made known
No other, then Christ's full Affection.
Youth, and Age.
GOD on our Youth bestows but little ease;
But on our Age most sweet Indulgences.
Gods Power.
GOD is so potent, as His Power can
Draw out of bad a sovereign good to man.
Paradise.
PAradise is (as from the Learned I gather)
A quire of blessed Souls circling in the Father.
Observation.
THe Jews, when they built Houses (I have read)
One part thereof left still unfinished:
To make them, thereby, mindful of their own
Cities most sad and dire destruction.
The Ass.
GOD did forbid the Israelites, to bring
An Ass unto Him, for an offering:
Only, by this dull creature, to express
His detestation to all slothfulness.
Observation.
THe Virgin Mother stood at distance (there)
From her Sons Cross, not shedding once a tear:
Because the Law forbad to sit and cry
For those, who did as malefactors die.
So she, to keep her mighty woes in awe,
Tortured her love, not to transgress the Law.
Observe we may, how Mary Joses then,
And the other Mary (Mary Magdalen)
Sat by the Grave; and sadly sitting there,
Shed for their Master many a bitter tear:
But 'twas not till their dearest Lord was dead;
And then to weep they both were licensed.
Tapers.
THose Tapers, which we set upon the grave,
In fun'rall pomp, but this importance have;
That souls departed are not put out quite;
But, as they walked here in their vestures white,
So live in Heaven, in everlasting light.
Christ's Birth.
ONe Birth our Savior had; the like none yet
Was, or will be a second like to it.
The Virgin Mary.
TO work a wonder, God would have her shown,
At once, a Bud, and yet a Rose full-blowne.
Another.
AS Sunbeams pierce the glass, and streaming in,
No crack or Schism leave in the subtle skin:
So the Divine Hand work't, and brake no thread,
But, in a Mother, kept a maidenhead.
God.
GOD, in the holy Tongue, they call
The Place that fills All in all.
Another of God.
GOD's said to leave this place, and for to come
Nearer to that place, then to other some:
Of local motion, in no least respect,
But only by impression of effect.
Another.
GOD is Jehovah called; which name of His
Implies or Essence, or the He that Is.
Gods presence.
GOD's evident, and may be said to be
Present with just men, to the verity:
But with the wicked if He does comply,
It Is (as S. Bernard says) but seemingly.
Gods Dwelling.
GOD's said to dwell there, wheresoever He
Puts down some prints of His high Majesty:
As when to man He comes, and there does place
His holy Spirit, or does plant His Grace.
The Virgin Mary.
THe Virgin Marie was (as I have read)
The House of God, by Christ inhabited;
Into the which He entered: but, the Door
Once shut, was never to be opened more.
To God.
GOD's undivided, One in Persons Three;
And Three in Inconfused Unity:
Original of Essence there is none
'Twixt God the Father, Holy Ghost, and Son:
And though the Father be the first of Three,
It Is but by Order, not by Entitie.
Upon Woman and Mary.
SO long (it seemed) as Mary's Faith was small,
Christ did her Woman, not her Mary call:
But no more Woman, being strong in Faith;
But Mary called then (as S. Ambrose says.)
North and South.
THe Jews their beds, and offices of ease,
Placed North and South, for these clean purposes;
That man's uncomely froth might not molest
Gods ways and walks, which lie still East and West.
Sabbaths.
SAbbaths are threefold, (as S. Austine says:)
The first of Time, or Sabbath here of Days;
The second is a Conscience trespasse-free;
The last the Sabbath of Eternity.
The Fast, or Lent.
NOah the first was (as Tradition says)
That did ordain the Fast of forty Days.
Sin.
THere is no evil that we do commit,
But has the extraction of some good from it:
As when we sin; God, the great Chemist, thence
Draws out the Elixar of true penitence.
God.
GOD is more here, then in another place,
Not by His Essence, but commerce of Grace.
This, and the next World.
GOD has this world for many made; it is true:
But He has made the world to come for few.
Ease.
GOD gives to none so absolute an Ease,
As not to know, or feel some Grievances.
Beginnings and Endings.
PAul, he began ill, but he ended well;
Judas began well, but he foulely fell:
In godliness, not the beginnings, so
Much as the ends are to be looked unto.
Temporal goods.
THese temp'rall goods God (the most Wise) commends
To the good and bad, in common, for two ends:
First, that these goods none here may over esteem,
Because the wicked do partake of them:
Next, that these ills none cowardly may shun;
Being, often here, the just man's portion.
Hell fire.
THe fire of Hell this strange condition has,
To burn, not shine (as learned Basil says.)
Abels Blood.
SPeak, did the Blood of Abel cry
To God for vengeance? yes say I;
Even as the sprinkled blood called on
God, for an expiation.
Another.
THe blood of Abel was a thing
Of such a reverend reckoning,
As that the old World thought it fit,
Especially to swear by it.
A Position in the Hebrew Divinity.
ONe man repentant is of more esteem
With God, then one, that never sinned against Him.
Penitence.
THe Doctors, in the Talmud, say,
That in this world, one only day
In true repentance spent, will be
More worth, then Heavens Eternity.
Gods presence.
GOD's present every where; but most of all
Present by Union Hypostaticall:
God, He is there, where is nothing else (Schools say)
And nothing else is there, where He Is away.
The Resurrection possible, and probable.
FOr each one Body, that in the earth is sown,
There Is an up-rising but of one for one:
But for each Grain, that in the ground is thrown,
Threescore or fourscore spring up thence for one:
So that the wonder is not half so great,
Of ours, as is the rising of the wheat.
Christ's suffering.
Justly our dearest Savior may abhor us,
Who has more suffered by us far, then for us.
Sinners.
SInners confounded are a twofold way,
Either as when (the learned Schoolmen say)
Men's sins destroyed are, when they repent;
Or when, for sins, men suffer punishment.
Temptations.
NO man is tempted so, but may overcome,
If that he has a will to Masterdome.
Pity, and punishment.
GOD does embrace the good with love; and gains
The good by mercy, as the bad by pains.
Gods price, and man's price.
GOd bought man here wtsh his hearts blood expense;
And man sold God here for base thirty pence.
Christ's Action.
CHRIST never did so great a work, but there
His humane Nature did, in part, appear:
Or, never so mean a piece, but men might see
Therein some beams of His Divinity:
So that, in all He did, there did combine
His Humane Nature, and His Part Divine,
Predestination.
PRedestination is the Cause alone
Of many standing, but of fall to none.
Another.
ARt thou not destined? then, with have, go on
To make thy fair Predestination:
If thou can change thy life, God then will please
To change, or call back, His past Sentences.
Sin.
SIn never slew a soul, unless there went
Along with it some tempting blandishment.
Another.
SIn is an act so free, that if we shall
Say, it is not free, it is then no sin at all.
Another.
SIn is the cause of death; and sin's alone
The cause of Gods Predestination:
And from Gods Prescience of man's sin does flow
Our Destination to eternal woe.
Prescience.
GOds Prescience makes none sinful; but the offense
Of man's the chief cause of Gods Prescience.
Christ.
TO all our wounds, here, whatsoever they be,
Christ is the one sufficient Remedy.
Christ's Incarnation.
CHRIST took our Nature on Him, not that He
'Bove all things loved it, for the purity:
No, but He dressed Him with our humane Trim,
Because our flesh stood most in need of Him.
Heaven.
HEaven is not given for our good works here:
Yet it is given to the Labourer.
Gods keys.
GOD has four keys, which He reserves alone;
The first of Rain, the key of Hell next known:
With the third key He opes and shuts the womb;
And with the fourth key He unlocks the tomb.
Sin.
There Is no constraint to do amiss,
Whereas but one enforcement is.
Alms.
GIve unto all, lest he, whom thou deni'st,
May chance to be no other man, but Christ.
Hell fire.
ONe only fire has Hell; but yet it shall,
Not after one sort, there excruciate all:
But look, how each transgressor onward went
Boldly in sin, shall feel more punishment.
To keep a true Lent.
1
IS this a Fast, to keep
The Larder lean?
And clean
From fat of Veales, and Sheep?
2
Is it to quit the dish
Of Flesh, yet still
To fill
The platter high with Fish?
3
Is it to fast an hour,
Or raged to go,
Or show
A down-cast look, and sour?
4
No: it is a Fast, to dole
Thy sheaf of wheat,
And meat,
Unto the hungry Soul.
5
It is to fast from strife,
From old debate,
And hate;
To circumcise thy life.
6
To show a heart grief-rent;
To sterve thy sin,
Not Bin;
And that is to keep thy Lent.
No time in Eternity.
BY hours we all live here, in Heaven is known
No spring of Time, or Times succession.
His Meditation upon Death
BE those few hours, which I have yet to spend,
Blessed with the Meditation of my end:
Though they be few in number, I Am content;
If otherwise, I stand indifferent:
Nor makes it matter, Nestors years to tell,
If man lives long, and if he live not well.
A multitude of days still heaped on,
Seldom brings order, but confusion.
Might I make choice, long life should be with-stood;
Nor would I care how short it were, if good:
Which to effect, let every passing Bell
Possess my thoughts, next comes my doleful knell:
And when the night persuades me to my bed,
I Will think I Am going to be buried:
So shall the Blankets which come over me,
Present those Turfs, which once must cover me:
And with as firm behavior I will meet
The sheet I sleep in, as my Winding Sheet.
When sleep shall bath his body in mine eyes,
I will believe, that then my body dies:
And if I chance to wake, and rise thereon,
I Will have in mind my Resurrection,
Which must produce me to that General Doom,
To which the Pesant, so the Prince must come,
To hear the Judge give sentence on the Throne,
Without the least hope of affection.
Tears, at that day, shall make but weak defense;
When Hell and Horror fright the Conscience.
Let me, though late, yet at the last, begin
To shun the least Temptation to a sin;
Though to be tempted be no sin, until
Man to the alluring object gives his will.
Such let my life assure me, when my breath
Goes theeving from me, I am safe in death;
Which is the height of comfort, when I fall,
I rise triumphant in my Funeral.
Clothes for Continuance.
THose Garments lasting evermore,
Are works of mercy to the poor,
Which neither Tettar, Time, or Moth
Shall fray that silk, or fret this cloth.
To God.
COme to me God; but do not come
To me, as to the general Doom,
In power; or come Thou in that state,
When Thou Thy Laws did promulgate,
When as the Mountains quaked for dread,
And sullen clouds bound up his head.
No, lay thy stately terrors by,
To talk with me familiarly;
For if Thy thunderclaps I hear,
I shall less swoone, then die for fear.
Speak thou of love and I Will reply
By way of Epithalamie,
Or sing of mercy, and I Will suit
To it my Violl and my Lute:
Thus let Thy lips but love distill,
Then come my God, and hap what will,
The Soul.
WHen once the Soul has lost her way,
O then, how restless does she stray!
And having not her God for light,
How does she err in endless night!
The Judgment day.
IN doing justice, God shall then be known,
Who showing mercy here, few prized, or none.
Sufferings.
WE merit all we suffer, and by far
More stripes, then God lays on the sufferer.
Pain and pleasure.
GOD suffers not His Saints, and Servants dear,
To have continual pain, or pleasure here:
But look how night succeeds the day, so He
Gives them by turns their grief and jollitie.
Gods presence.
GOD is all-present to what e're we do,
And as all-present, so all-filling too.
Another.
TThat there is a God, we all do know,
But what God is, we cannot show.
The poor man's part.
TEll me rich man, for what intent
Thou load'st with gold thy vestiment?
When as the poor cry out, to us
Belongs all gold superfluous.
The right hand.
GOD has a Right Hand, but is quite bereft
Of that, which we do nominate the Left.
The Staff and Rod.
TWo instruments belong unto our God;
The one a Staff is, and the next a Rod:
That if the twig should chance too much to smart,
The staff might come to play the friendly part.
God sparing in scourging.
GOD still rewards us more then our desert:
But when He strikes, He quarter-acts His part.
Confession.
COnfession twofold is (as Austine says,)
The first of sin is, and the next of praise:
If ill it goes with thee, thy faults confess:
If well, then chant Gods praise with cheerfulness.
Gods descent.
GOD is then said for to descend, when He
Does, here on earth, some thing of novitie;
As when, in humane nature He works more
Then ever, yet, the like was done before.
No coming to God without Christ.
GOod and great God! How should I fear
To come to Thee, if Christ not there!
Co'd I but think, He would not be
Present, to plead my cause for me;
To Hell I Would rather run, then I
Would see Thy Face, and He not by.
Another, to God.
THough Thou be all that Active Love,
Which heats those ravished Souls above;
And though all joys spring from the glance
Of Thy most winning countenance;
Yet sour and grim Thou Would seem to me;
If through my Christ I saw not Thee.
The Resurrection.
THat Christ did die, the Pagan says;
But that He rose, that is Christians Faith.
Coheires.
WE are Coheires with Christ; nor shall His own
Heire-ship be less, by our adoption:
The number here of Heirs, shall from the state
Of His great Birthright nothing derogate.
The number of two.
GOD hates the Duall Number; being known
The lucklesse number of division:
And when He blessed each several Day, whereon
He did His curious operation;
It Is never read there (as the Fathers say,)
God blessed His work done on the second day:
Wherefore two prayers ought not to be said,
Or by our selves, or from the Pulpit read.
Hardening of hearts.
GOD's said our hearts to harden then,
When as His grace not supples men.
The Rose.
BEfore Man's fall, the Rose was born
(S. Ambrose says) without the Thorn:
But, for Man's fault, then was the Thorn,
Without the fragrant Rose-bud, born;
But never the Rose without the Thorn.
Gods time must end our trouble.
GOD does not promise here to man, that He
Will free him quickly from his misery;
But in His own time, and when He thinks fit,
Then He will give a happy end to it.
Baptism.
THe strength of Baptism, that is within;
It saves the soul, by drowning sin.
Gold and Frankincense.
GOld serves for Tribute to the King;
The Frankincense for Gods Offering.
To God.
GOD, who me gives a will for to repent,
Will add a power, to keep me innocent;
That I shall never that trespass recommit,
When I have done true Penance here for it.
The chewing the Cud.
WHen well we speak, and nothing do that is good,
We not divide the Hoof, but chew the Cud:
But when good words, by good works, have their proof,
We then both chew the Cud, and cleave the Hoof.
Christ's twofold coming.
THy former coming was to cure
My souls most desperate Calenture;
Thy second Advent, that must be
To heal my Earths infirmity.
To God, his gift.
AS my little Pot does boil,
We will keep this Levell-Coyle;
That a Wave, and I will bring
To my God, a Heave Offering.
Gods Anger.
GOD cannot be wrathful; but we may conclude,
Wrathful He may be, by similitude:
God's wrathful said to be, when He does do
That without wrath, which wrath does force us to.
Gods Commands.
IN Gods Commands, never ask the reason why;
Let thy obedience be the best Reply.
To God.
IF I have played the Truant, or have here
Failed in my part; O! Thou that art my dear,
My mild, my loving Tutor, Lord and God!
Correct my errors gently with Thy Rod.
I know, that faults will many here be found,
But where sin swells, there let Thy grace abound.
To God.
THe work is done; now let my Laurel be
Given by none, but by Thy self, to me:
That done, with Honor Thou do me create
Thy Poet, and Thy Prophet Lawreat.
Good Friday: Rex Tragicus, or Christ going to His Cross.
PUt off Thy Robe of Purple, then go on
To the sad place of execution:
Thine hour is come; and the Tormentor stands
Ready, to pierce Thy tender Feet, and Hands.
Long before this, the base, the dull, the rude,
The inconstant, and unpurged Multitude
Yawne for Thy coming; some e're this time cry,
How He deferres, how loath He is to die!
Amongst this scumme, the Soldier, with his spear,
And that sour Fellow, with his vinegar,
His sponge, and stick, do ask why Thou do stay?
So do the Skurfe and Bran too: Go Thy way,
Thy way, Thou guiltless man, and satisfy
By Thine approach, each their beholding eye.
Not as a thief, shall Thou ascend the mount,
But like a Person of some high account:
The Cross shall be Thy Stage; and Thou shall there
The spacious field have for Thy Theater.
Thou art that Roscius, and that markt-out man,
That must this day act the Tragedian,
To wonder and affrightment: Thou art He,
Whom all the flux of Nations comes to see;
Not those poor Thieves that act their parts with Thee:
Those act without regard, when once a King,
And God, as Thou art, comes to suffering.
No, No, this Scene from Thee takes life and sense,
And soul and spirit plot, and excellence.
Why then begin, great King! ascend Thy Throne,
And thence proceed, to act Thy Passion
To such an height, to such a period raised,
As Hell, and Earth, and Heaven may stand amazed.
God, and good Angels guide Thee; and so bless
Thee in Thy several parts of bitterness;
That those, who see Thee nailed unto the Tree,
May (though they scorn Thee) praise and pity Thee.
And we (Thy Lovers) while we see Thee keep
The Laws of Action, will both sigh, and weep;
And bring our Spices, to embalm Thee dead;
That done, we will see Thee sweetly buried.
His words to Christ, going to the Cross.
WHen Thou wast taken, Lord, I often have read,
All Thy Disciples Thee forsook, and fled.
Let their example not a pattern be
For me to fly, but now to follow Thee.
Another, to his Savior.
IF Thou be taken, God forbid,
I fly from Thee, as others did:
But if Thou will so honor me,
As to accept my company,
I Will follow Thee, hap, hap what shall,
Both to the Judge, and Judgment-Hall:
And, if I see Thee posted there,
To be all-flayd with whipping-cheere,
I Will take my share; or else, my God,
Thy stripes I Will kiss, or burn the Rod.
His Saviors words, going to the Cross.
HAve, have ye no regard, all ye
Who pass this way, to pity me,
Who am a man of misery!
A man both bruised, and broke, and one
Who suffers not here for mine own,
But for my friends transgression!
Ah! Sions Daughters, do not fear
The Cross, the Cords, the Nails, the Spear,
The Myrrh, the Gall, the Vinegar:
For Christ, your loving Savior, has
Drunk up the wine of Gods fierce wrath;
Only, there is left a little froth,
Less for to taste, then for to show,
What bitter cups had been your due,
Had He not drank them up for you.
His Anthem, to Christ on the Cross.
WHen I behold Thee, almost slain,
With one, and all parts, full of pain:
When I Thy gentle Heart do see
Pierced through, and dropping blood, for me,
I Will call, and cry out, Thanks to Thee.
Verse.
But yet it wounds my soul, to think,
That for my sin, Thou, Thou must drink,
Even Thou alone, the bit^er cup
Of fury, and of vengeance up.
Chor.
Lord, I Will not see Thee to drink all
The Vinegar, the Myrrh, the Gall:
Ver. Chor.
But I will sip a little wine;
Which done, Lord say, The rest is mine.
This Cross Tree here
Does JESUS bear,
Who sweet'ned first,
The Death accurs't.

HEre all things ready are, make have, make have away;
For, long this work will be, and very short this Day.
Why then, go on to act: Here Is wonders to be done,
Before the last least sand of Thy ninth hour be run;
Or e're dark Clouds do dull, or dead the Mid-dayes Sun.
Act when Thou will,
Blood will be spilt;
Pure Balm, that shall
Bring Health to All.
Why then, Begin
To power first in
Some Drops of Wine,
In stead of Brine,
To search the Wound,
So long unsound:
And, when that is done,
Let Oil, next, run,
To cure the Sore
Sin made before.
And O! Dear Christ,
Even as Thou di'st,
Look down, and see
Us weep for Thee.
And tho (Love knows)
Thy dreadful Woes
We cannot ease;
Yet do Thou please,
Who Mercy art,
T'accept each Heart,
That gladly would
Help, if it could.
Mean while, let me,
Beneath this Tree,
This Honor have,
To make my grave.
To his Saviors Sepulcher: his Devotion.
Hail holy, and all-honour'd Tomb,
By no ill haunted; here I come,
With shoes put off, to tread thy Room.
I Will not profane, by soil of sin,
Thy Door, as I do enter in:
For I have washed both hand and heart,
This, that, and every other part;
So that I dare, with far less fear,
Then full affection, enter here.
Thus, thus I come to kiss Thy Stone
With a warm lip, and solemn one:
And as I kiss, I Will here and there
Dress Thee with flowrie Diaper.
How sweet this place is! as from hence
Flowed all Panchaia's Frankincense;
Or rich Arabia did commix,
Here, all her rare Aromaticks.
Let me live ever here, and stir
No one step from this Sepulcher.
Ravished I am! and down I lie,
Confused, in this brave Ecstasy.
Here let me rest; and let me have
This for my Heaven, that was Thy Grave:
And, coveting no higher sphere,
I Will my Eternity spend here.
His Offering, with the rest, at the Sepulcher.
TO join with them, who here confer
Gifts to my Saviors Sepulcher;
Devotion bids me hither being
Somewhat for my Thank-Offering.
Lo! Thus I give a Virgin-Flower,
To dress my Maiden-Saviour.
His coming to the Sepulcher.
HEnce they have born my Lord: Behold! the Stone
Is rolled away; and my sweet Savior's gone!
Tell me, white Angel; what is now become
Of Him, we lately sealed up in this Tomb?
Is He, from hence, gone to the shades beneath,
To vanquish Hell, as here He conquered Death?
If so; I Will thither follow, without fear;
And live in Hell, if that my Christ stays there.
OF all the good things whatsoever we do,
God is the AP, and the TELOS too.
