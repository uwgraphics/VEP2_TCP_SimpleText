Die Sabbathi, 2 die Septembris* 1643.
The Report from the Committee of the Safety, concerning the Earl of Denbigh.
THat upon full Examination and Consideration of the proceeding in the
Business concerning the stay of the Earl of Denbigh, The Committee conceives
they had just cause to send for the Earl for not obeying of the Order of the
Committee made in His Lordships presence, with His Consent as they apprehend.
But His Lordship upon His return affirming upon His Honor, that He did
mistake the Order of the Committee, And that if He had understood it to have
restrained His going out of Town with His forces and provisions He would have
obeyed it, The Committee thinks good to declare, that there is nothing appears
to them that does any way deminish their opinion of His Innocence and
Faithfulness to the Parliament and State, but He remains in their
Apprehensions untainted in His Honor, and so they desire He may be esteemed by
others.
