ELEGY On the untimely Death of the incomparably Valiant and Noble, FRANCIS,
Lord VILLIERS, Brother to the Duke of BUCKINGHAM.
Slain by the Rebels near Kingstone upon Thames, July the 7. 1648.
REader! who here lies dead, may give
Thee cause to weep for all that live.
Since in him, Courage, Beauty, Blood,
All that is Great, and Sweet, and Good,
All youth's contracted Glories, have --
(Weep, pitying Reader! Weep.) -- their (Grave.
That so it may be justly sed,
(These gone) the Living are the Dead.
But when the sadder voice of Fame
Shall to all this, add Villiers Name,
And my unwilling Pen shall tell
That by a Rebel hand he fell;
What Soul, will not his Fate engage
At once with Pity, and with Rage:
So in his height of youthful Pride
Fore Troy the beauteous Memnon died.
Nor with such tears bewailed was he,
Though wept for by a Deity.
But you, brave souls! whom the same sense
Of Honor moves, the same Pretense,
Shrink not to see his sadder fall.
But (whilst to mind others recall
His hopeful virtues, and his years
Cropped in their bud, lament with tears,
Whilst some perhaps, whose Form might move
His noble Heart, sigh for his Love.
Others his early valor sing,
And Loyalty unto his King)
Let the example of his Fame
Your Bloods to great Attempts inflame.
And a Resolve to every Heart
As high as your high Cause impart.
Hark! from his Grave his Martial sprite
Your Loyal Valors does excite.
On! 'till a Death like that I found,
Each of your conquering Swords has crowned,
And my glad Ashes then shall rise,
And triumph in your Victories.
There is no salve can cure again
Your Honors wounds: think not you then
Gain Life, when you by flying, yield;
But when you dying, win the field.
This unto future Times make good,
Or bear the guilt of his lost Blood.
FINIS.
