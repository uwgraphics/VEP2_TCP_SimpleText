HOUSEHOLD OBSERVATIONS NECESSARY FOR THESE TIMES.
IF thou, my Servant, wilt thy Master please,
Thou must observe and keep such Laws as these;
BE true and trusty, let thy hands be clear:
And to purloyne thy Masters goods forbear.
I hate a Liar, and a Saucie Knave:
And in a Gaimster I no pleasure have.
I Hate the Man that has a vanting Vain:
And Him, that loves another fame to Stain.
I like not Him, that is unapt to Learn:
Nor Him, that Grudging, does his wages Earne.
The Churlish, and the Envious man I hate:
And Him I love not, that does sow Debate.
Sly Knaves, that would my Secrets overlook:
Proud Fools, nor talking Fools; I cannot brook.
I trust not Him, that would with Fauning please:
Nor Him, that loves his Belly and his Ease.
The false, deceitful man I hate as Hell:
Only with Me the honest man shall dwell.
He Is Gentle, Faithful, willing to Obey:
And well deserves, to Rule another day.
