BALTAZAR GERBIER KNIGHT TO ALL MEN THAT LOVES TRVTH

BALTHAZAR GERBIER KNIGHT. To all men that Loves Truth.
THe Divine p^ecopts of Christ forbidd men to Judge one annother, Judgment
belongs to God, and to none else; for he says IVDGMENT IS MINE:

It pleases God to suffer my Parents to fly the bluddy persecutions in France
against those which the Roman Catholics called then (...) My said Parents
left and lost all for that cause;

My Father Anthoine Gerbier was a genthleman borne, and had a Baronnie in
Notmandie; My Mother was Radegonde, daughter jn Air to the Lord of Blayet in
Picardie;

I was borne; at Middelbourg in Zelandt, whence I was (by one of my
Brothers) transported into France, and thence returned; and about (...) tuinty
one past (in the company of Noel Caron then Holl^ndt Ambassadeur) into England;
where I applied myself to George Villiers, newly become fauorit to King
Ieames, the said George Villiers, being immediately after Baron, Viscount Earl,
and afterward created Marquis and Duke of Buckingham.

My attendance was pleasing to him, bijcause of my several languages, good
hand in vvriting:, skill in sciences, as Mathematics, Architecture, dravving,
painting, contryuing of scenes, Marquis, shovvs and entertainments for great
Princes, besides many (...) which I had gathered from diverse rare persons, as
likvv^e, for making of Engines usfull in war, as I made those which might
blow up the Dike that stopped the passage to the Town of Rochell, for it
was on the same Model of that of the Prince of Parms when the attempt was
on Antvverpe;

He did puts to me first, the contryuance of some of his habitations, to chouse
fort him rarities, books, medals, marble ^ of money, of which I never would
hane the managing.

I did keep his Cifers with his jntelligences abroad, was sent by him
(with the king his Masters aprobation) in secret Messages;

No sooner were those marks of trust observed, butt malicious Ignorant
persons made glosses thereon, according the places were I was sent:

My first public inployment abroad was a journey into Holland, to meet
their an Eminent person from Brabant who was to make ouuertures from Spain
and Germani^e for the restitution of the Palatinat; I went at that same
justant jnto Tessei and assisted Sr. Sackville Trevers, to get clear from the
Eastindian Company their dessigne which was to stay him with the Shipp
called the S. Esprit, where vviht he made afterward for England:

My second jmployment was jn France, to expostulate vviht the Cardinal de
Richelieu, concerning large promises France had made to assist Count Mansfelt,
when king Ieames was mouued to engage him self on their fai^e promises
againts Spain; which assistance prouued at last butt bare Cabinet
discourses, and no real engagement of that king nor Ministers of state: which
seemed to vexc Count Mansfelt art my return to Dover* and seemed to mouve him
to desire that I should say to King Ieames, that he had keijes to make his one
passage through France, if the king would give him leave, though it was a
question whether Count Mansfelt meant it, for he never had any o^ttaine
promise of a real conjonction nor assistance of the french: his Tresorier
then (for show) only did pass aquittances to the french; thereby to persuade
king Ieames that the jntended vvare for the Palatinat should not wholy lay on
his charge:

I was afterward jmployed again jnto Brabant, where I was commanded to
comune with the Marquis Spinola about the reconcilliation betvveene the
Crown of England and Spain, on which secret conference the treaty was set
on foot; and pursued until it was braught to a conclusion:

I was jmploied jnto France to remonstrate the great jnconueniencies of
their countenancing of the Spanish trade, for that their shipping did
transportte all the Spanish Merchandise, and thereby frustrated the king of
England of those hopes (during the breach betvveene the two Crowns after the
desoluing of the two Treaties of the Spanish match, and that of the Palatinat)
the Spaniards might have been pu^t to it, and thereby mouued to give fit
satisfaction on the point of the Palatinat:

I was likvveise employed by the King to remonstrate to the French King and to
the then Queen Mother, the mistakes of the French Ambassador Monsieur de
Blinuille; when his men used violence on the Kings Officers, Constables and
others that did their Duty, to hinder the scandalous resort of English Papists
at Durham house:

I did then deliver to the Cardinal des Richelieu a letter of the Duke of
Buckingham, which was by some taken for the cause and beginning of
mis-intellgences between the two Crowns of England and France, because
those two great fauorits did then declare their ressents; which were so
violently uttered on the Cardinal de Richelieu side, as that he accompanied
them with unciuill glosses, who gave ground to some licencious discourses,
which did so little vvorck on me (that had not other Northstarre then his
Majesty's services and my duty) as mouued me to proceed as befitted a person
sent on good grounds, and to make apparent to the haughty spirit of that
Cardinal that threats were to vveake to drive me from my byas, nor could his
compliments afterward work any other effect on me (when he desired my
toturne) then to mouue me to hear him, and to relate his vtterances which
concluded with compliments that he contented himself to know the fame of a
fauorit so great as the Duke of Buckingham was, but for him only to act the
part of a single Minister of state; who did admire the power of the Canon of
an English Admiral, but that he him self did remain in the humility of the
Canons of that Church whereof he was a Disciple, and as those vtterances
where indeed butt flovvers of Rethorice, they coueted serpents, for he caused
men to follovv me to the very port of Bollogne* where the foldiers were
appointed to cease on all my papers, butt he was disapointed, for I got safe
into England:

I was afterward commanded toward Spain, on an invitatin^ from that King
and a Pass sent for my safe Landing* In any (...) of CANTABRIA, it was to
proceed to the intended Treaty of reconcilliation between the two Crowns;
butt an Irish blee^d Eyd Papist Priest was set on by Mr. Endimion Porter to
make the Duke of Buckingham believe that the Conde-Duch d'Oliuaras the king of
Spaines fauorit desired the said Mr. Porter to be sent on that Treaty, which
prouued but a plot of the said Mr Porter, as apeared by his proceedings, for
after he got the Duke of Bukinghams consent to go allong with them and the
Abot d'Escaillie (then Amb^ssad from the Duke of Savoye) no sooner were we
arrived at Bruxels butt the said Mr. Porter (with out knowledge of the said
Abot d'Escalie, less of m^e) repaired secretly to the Arch Duchess Infame
Isabells, and to Don Carlot Colom^^, to contrice his disguised passage into
Spain, without the said Abot d'E^caille and my self which he undertook
after he left me on my way from Bruxelles to N^mur, and his return to
Bruxelles, though he had neither Commission nor any letter of Credence, for I
did pocesse them, therefore his said secret journey into Spain prouued most
ridiculous, and his appearance to that Court was taken by the Conde-Duca as an
argument of weakness in those that had sent him* that had no letters of
credit.

It was from that instant that I became an Eyesore to the English Spanish
faction which was maintained by the Lord Cot^inghton; some of them caused a
most malicious and horride asperssion to be cast on me supposing by their
letters to the Lord of Carlisle (his Majesty's extraordinary Ambassador in
Itallie in the year 1628.) that I was sent that way about (on a pretense to
go to Spain) only to kill him by the way; of which horrid asperssion the said
Lord of Carlille was pleased to give me notice; and on my just ^essent
declared in his Majesty's presence, that he never had any cause to credit that
foulle report: yet did the Authors thereoff continue their malice against me
by their ill Offices during my Bleuen years Residency in his Majesty's
service in the Court of Bruxels; returning copies to the Spanish ministers off
all the of most Important advertissements which I did sent to the King and
State.

And as those malicious persons seemed to aim to have me and mine distroyed in
that Residency, they endeavored no less than the destruction of his Majesty's
service, his Interest honor; that of the Nation, and the interest of the best
and most assured Friends and Allies of the State of England.

This they did on diverse notable occasions: First, when by their maintayning
the Spanish, scarce any of his Majesty's subjects could get Justice in the
Admirallitie Courts of Brabant and Flandres, when diverse of his Majesty's
subiets might have been timly releast, their perssons and goods freed from
destruction, diverse of them suffered therein by the insolency of their aduersse
parties favored by the Spanish faction in England.

Secondly, They crossed many fair occasions concerning the Palatinat, by
returning to some of the ill disposed Spanish ministers of state such secret
aduertissements as I had sent into England and which I had in confidency from
the Emperors Resident, the Du^k of Neevv^^^g, the Prince Elector of Treue^* and
the Resident of Collen: The said English Spanish affected, aduertissed the
Marquis d'Ayton^ that the Infanta Isabella Arch-Duchesse had honored me with
a secret declaration that she would put Franckendall into the Queen of
Bohemias hands. This they returned by one John Taylier (an English Papist, who
formerly had been by the English Spanish faction, employed into Germany) by
which auertissements the Infants for her good will toward the Queen of
BOHEMIA was braught into question, and that business utterly distroyed,
which then I did manifest to Old Sir John Coke, then Secretary of State: and
that I had vvitnesses how the said John Tailor confessed his fault for having
conferred with the said Marquis dAyton^, Contrary to his Instru^^ions,
received from the King and the Secretary of State* which he confessed a month
after his arrival at Bruxels, that he had kept sir John Cokes letter to me
in his pocket until the said business of Franckendall was distroyed, he said
that the Cottintoniens had forbid him to go a long with me to the Spanish
ministers.

Thirdly, They returned to the Court of Bruxels the Copy of a great dispatch
wherein I manifested to the King and to the Secretary of State all what the
Catholic States (both Spiritual and Temporal) had resolved in their trance,
that those Provinces were in hazard to be conquered.

By which cetu^ne of Advertissement was wrought the destruction of the
famillies of the Duke of Ascot, Prince of Espinoy, Barbanson, Duke or (...) and
o^ Count Egmond: One Iean de Viualde (that had been Secretary to van-Malle for
the Space of 1^ years in England) beheaded on the Marquet place at Bruxels, on
the return of such aduertissements as I had sent unto the State? His sentence
in Dutch, bearing the words, Vitz. For having given aduertissments to a
public ministers of a Neigbour Prince.

All which being become publix, the COTTINTONIENS ceased not to countenance
instances done for my recall from that Residency; which the Marquis de Velad^
and Don Alonzo de C^^denas did vigourously pursue, though his Majesty did most
graciously reject their motions, and with matkes of extraordinary exteeme of
my fidelity, for he answ wared, it was not his custom to disgrace those that
dit serve him will

Like ill VVillers as the COTTINTONIENS did likvvelse countenance many
complaints against me made by factiona^ls about Queen Mother. The Duke
d'Elboeuf, and others who would pass into England against his Majesty's
will, when the words of my Instuctions (signed by the Lord Dorchester, then
Secretary of State) dit bear, that my (...) was in the Sca^l^e if any one of
those dit pass to trouble the English Seas. As it seemed to be indeed which
way it went, since the factionaris about Queen Mother had those in the
English Court, as well of the French (...) of the Spanish faction (and of
others God knovvith) vvllo did stir an inteconciliable hattered against me
for hindering so great a Princess as Queen Mother, to repair in time where
she might breath (at rest) the last of her days: In fine it proved that to
free Queen Mother from such aduertissements as I could and did give from the
place of my Residency (...) factionaris about her ledd her away about into
Holland, whore my confractor Sir William Bosvvell could not stop her, though
no ruin fell on him for her said passage into England, where (...) self
being returned I met a Sea of ill (...) of diverse factions, who duting my
Eleven years Residency at Bruxels, had taken occasion to except against my
aduertissements which spared none, nor of Church, nor State, for what was
manifested to me and by me found true on the place I did plainly set down,
without mincing any thing for fear of (...) nor for allurements, resolved to
take things as God ^evould have (...) (...), and to make due exteeme of the
wise saying* Nolite cansidere Principibus, neque filiis hominum in quibus non
est Salus. His Majesty indeed was often graciously pleased to approve my
endeaviours, to express his satisfaction thereon, and I may say, (without
vanity) a truth, as a mark of my gratitude, that his Majesty was so gracious,
as to say in public, that of all those that did then attend His service abroad
none was more diligent; this was written to me by my predecessor Sir John
Finet, who attended the King at His dinner, when the words were uttered.

Nor could I think so meanly of my endeavors, blessed by Gods assistance in
the discovery of many things, which peradventure diverse others would have bin
incapable off for want of Languages, but that I might have bin thought worthy
of a better revvard; and better considered even by the best friends of the
State of England, since diverse of my advertissements to His Majesty's
principal Secretaries of State, did bear particulars whereby his best
friends could be warned to look to themselves, when four hundred thousand
Crounes were disposed for the betraying of Mastricht, that engines were
prepared against Be^gopzom. That one Triboulet, a Bourguinnon, was dispatc^t
from Braban^ to kill the French King Louis the XIII. All I got for my pains
was a check from old Secretary Coke; to have named in my public dispatch the
Duke of Bullon, though his name and the thing became afterward public in
the streets of Bruxels, the check, I (...), was not old Sir John Coke, but
came from the English Spanish faction, who then constrained Sir John Cokes pen
to vvritte as they would have it. On the second, the man being discovered by
the French King himself, a Gentleman belonging to the Duke de Chevreule was
^ent to me, with thanks, nor did I look for more since what I could deserve
was to put on that masters score, who I had the honor to serve. And who in
conclusion was so gracious to me as to confirm his satisfaction of my
service in my letter of credence to the late French King, by the words, V^z. I
Do RECOMMEND THIS GENTLEMAN (...) MASTER OF MY CEREMONIES TO YOUR PARTICULAR
PROTECTION, FOR THAT HE HAS DONE ME LONG AND FAITHFUL SERVICE.

This Letter of Credence I sued for, when I was persuaded that I could no
longer breath where the Cottintoniens had any credit, since I did feel the
continuance of their ill offices without intermission That it was most
knavvishly sustained to the King that I had de^^^ved to be heinged by my legs,
for having to the Lords in Parliament (when I was charged by them of my
Consience) declared the names of those that did bettray the Kings affairs in
foreign parts, though God knovveth I said no more then I could prove, and did
but answer to the Question, for I never tutcht the string of others, and
whose rest It was not my design since to trouble; though my Iournals did
bear whose Pensionnaries they were reputed to be, and what Popish Priests
were theirs. That it was likewise most knavishly represented to the King
(when the Prince Elector Palatin to the hearing of Colonel Linzey was
pleased at Yorckere the Standart was let up to request for my License, that I
might be dismissed of my Office to shift for my self in some other part of the
world) That I had been untrue to my first master the Duke of Buckingham, and
this on a most bace, ridiculous and false pretense. Which no doubt was
forstalled by a person, who in the Duke of Bukinghams time would once put me
ill with the said Duke, and even at the same instant that he entreated me to
get him preferred to a more near attendance to his person, it was one Master
John Asbornham, since one of the grooms of the Bedchambre, it was for him I
spoke, the Lady Duchess (at his earnest suit) required me to do it; I did it
in her presence, that she was a bed with the Duke, who mistook my speech
and distickt it, for now I ^ust declare the truth (on which I take God to
witness) it was when the Duke had told me in private that he would have me
in that place, Sir Sackville Crovv being then on point to be preferred to the
place of Tresorier of the Navy. This office in favor of Master Asbornham,
though to my one prejudice then, proved so little advantageous to me, as that
it was supposed to the Duke of Buckingham that I had taken the Lady Porbecks
part, to save her from the Officiers that would have carried her to prison,
from a house in the Strand next to the Venetian Ordinary, were then the Savoye
Ambassador did lay, and where by accident I then was. It being in those days
that the misunderstanding between the Duke and me was fomented, God of Heaven
knovveth (to whose Tribunal I do appeal on that subject and to answer for
all what is contained in these Lines) that I had no to-respondence at all
with the Lady Porbeck, nor bad seen her since the days that she lived in
amity with the Duke and all the family of the Villiers. Not had the Abot
d'Escaille any premeditated dessigne with her, nor to contribute to her
escappe; as was supposed on a vvanton (...)-Loosnesse, which was acted on a
suddayne, without any premeditation when one of the Pages of the Ambassador
was dressed in a vvon as close Monsieur Bron^^, Sir Theodor Mayetnes brother in
Law being then present and the said Page put in a Coach by the Abott
d'Esrailles men, who finding the house where the Abott d'Escaillie their
Master lay to be abused by a number of men that brake in to g^^^ over a pall^
of his guarden into a next house, where the Lady Po^bech was said to Lodge,
proposed to the Abott (being at dinner) to rid his house of annoyance, for
that his said men did conceive that all the crew would run out of doors to
stopp the Coach wherein the Page was putt, who was found to be a Page in
effect, as foone the Coach was overtaken the length of a street, which did
not at all contribute to the escappe of the Lady Po^beck, since the house
wherein she was remained pocect with Sergeants and store of people.

All which being examined and found true mo^^ed the Duke of Buckingham to
reconcile himself with the Abott d'Escaille, and to desire that the feast of
reconcilliation should be at my house; where the Duke was pleased two days
after to beseech his Majesty's to come with the Queen, to accept like
entertainment because the manner thereof was pleasing.

The imposture, therefore, that I should have been untrue to the Duke being
Manifest, could not butt with two much Audacity and busnesse be represented
to the Kings most Royal (...) twelve years after that it was clereed, and
his Majesty had many proofs of my fidellity and constancy to his service, for
which I have many letters of his Royal hand to shue, and wherein as before
said his Majesty's has been most graciously pleased to express his
satisfaction.

I was thus contained to sue for my remove from the presence of a great King,
in whose service and in that of the State) I would have thought my self
happy to end my days; yett my license was refused to agreate Prince; who (in
mere compassion) inclined to speak in my favor, when all means of
subsistence were taken from me, that the Secretary of State then Lord Fackland
had hindered some Bishops of paying such monnie to me as had been by Tallies
struck on them a year before, and for which I had paid the fees in the
Exchequer at westminster.

Being thus in an Instant deprived of all livelihood and also frustrated of
desbo^^ssments made both for the transpottation of Queen Mothers train from
London to Dover, and during the time of my attendance in the office of Master
of Ceremonies (after I had consumed my self in his Majesty's service during my
eleven years Residency in the Court of Bruxels* great part of my arreares
being (...) paid) No vvouder that I took then hold on the occasion to pass
into France, when I had obtained the letter of Credence as aforesaid* which
being about the time that a question was moved on as intercepted letter sent
from London to Oxford fathered on me (though no man could proure the caracter
to be mine not to have his sent directly nor indirectly by me my said departure
then did not (as it seems) satisfy all those that heard of the said letter;
not some that have bin pleased to vent glosses thereon; Though, I had to plead
on that subject first, not guilty:

Secondly, That I was charged with a letter of Credence to pass a Compliment
with a King who was acere the Angonies of death, as it proved; since ere I
landed at Callis he was deceassed.

Thirdly, that I had a pass from the Parliament, declaring my liberty, to
attend his Majesty's service, and this without limitation of place; when his
Majesty had full power on me to command me to go or to come; That my
dependency was Manifest and public; my attendance but a Coremoniall part,
without any relation to the dicipline of vvarres.

Fourthly (...) my going from London I was in no constraint nor under any
guarde.

Fifthly, it was ten the ClocK in the morning when I did embarke my self in
the ordinary packett boat at Dover whereof one Master VVhi^ was master who
had Known me many years before, I paid the duties, which the Officers
there demanded of me: all men that were there did see my face, which was
not disguised by falce hear nor peruix. Master whit was at the starren of
the Boat and I never went under deck to hid my self.

Sixthly, that if the letter could have been proved to be mine, yet could it
not have argued me to be a dangerous man, since I had no voice in chapter
with either parties; that I was no instrument of the unhappy difference
between the King and his People for which I shall praise God vvhille I live;
and di^^rs of my public dispatchs (which I have made to the King and State
during my Residency at Bruxels, as my Iournals can manifest) will prouve that
I did faithfully relate how little the world did reflect on His Majesty's
power, so long it was not seasoned by an Harmonious concordance of
Parliaments; Which was often cast in my teeth, When I did incist (as my duty
was, and my Instructions did bear) on the point of the restitution of the
Palatinat; Which endeauours (besides the pursuance of His Majesty's interests)
lost me with some of the Spanish Ministers, as namely with the President
Role, who when I did demand Justice for His Majesty's subjests, and such
possitiue answers as I was commanded to put to him insolently questioned
vvhetber the King had an Army of fifthy thousand man at his back: Which he
^^eered with disrespectfull Words, whereon I made a just complaint to the
Infant Cardinal, who did blame the said President Rose for it.

No men will vvonder (as I do conceive) that I did at last sue for my recall
from that imploiment; as I did when I had so long withstood the violence and
malice of the Cottintoniens, who by these great Intelligence with the most
depraved Ministers the King of Spain had (some of which the said King has
been constrained to shake of) all the good and solid Orders sent to me by His
Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State, were of no force; and all good
endeavors destroyed* to the prejudice of His Majesty's Service, Honor, and
the real good and greatness (...) the State of England.

No vvonder also, that I did sue for my said recall, when the Kings ennemies
made use of Spirits of Dil^^ion to attempt on the Souls and minds of the first
of my family, a perfecution which (without comparaison) Job never felt, for
his calamity did not follovv him from one Country to another: As sirst it
begun against me in Brabant* It continued at my return in England, and
follovved me into France, as feemes to finish where it begun with my
Predecessors.

For no sooner had I gotten in France a Surintendance of an Office which
would have proved vvorth to me many thousand pounds a year; but was pursued
by factionnaries, who did boldly maintain in Petitions presented by the
Bishop du Puis to the Queen Regent, that She was Ipso facto excommunicated,
for having conferred such an Office on an Heretic, as they term all that are
not of the Church of Rome: This was pursued by libels and mischie^^^^
contrivances; in which English Papists had part, as especially those who
impudently, and most falcoly, did sustain me to be the man who crossed all the
King of great Britains affairs abroad, alleging (...) other ground for their
utterances, but what I had openly declared to the Lords in Parliament
concerning the Lord Cottington; and ha^ during my being at Paris, one Sir
Thomas Dishington had free access to me That the said Sir Thomas Dishingt on
should have said that it was I who disuaded the Queen Regent from sending any
Ambassado^r into England that had not left a good esteem there; that the Queen
Regent, being graciously pleased to ask my opinion what person seemed most
fit for that Embassage, I said in answer (to her most gracious commands) that
to me the Mareshall de Bassompie^^e seemeed the fittest, being a peaceable,
grave; good, and wise noble man, who having once reconciled the two Nations,
might perhaps prou^ a fit Minister for the reconciliation betvveen the King and
his people. That the said Sir, Thomas Dishington had said, that the Lord
Lanthian had departed as ill satisfied from the French Court as any man ever
could; If I had not represented to the Queen Regent, and to the Cardinal
Mazarin the true condition of that Lord; That I had likewise procured a
present of a golden chain to the said Sir Thomas Dishington, and presented him
to the Cardinal Mazarin, before his going for England, which was in the
year one thousand six hundredth forty four.

VVeake Objections indeed, and vveake grounds for Master William Crafts to
proceed on, for the utter destruction of my familly, and to take hold on any
other occasion to do me mischief, as was intended with a report that I had
since my being in France corespounded with some that are not in good
intelligence with the French: On which point I was not bound to answer to
any man living, for as I am a free man borne in Zeeland. It was free to me
(being not engaged in any service to correspond with whom I would) Yes
cannot any man doubt of my Integrity, and Maxime^ considering the profession I
have made during many years, my experience and the cruel persecutions which
I have suffered by those that are no real friends to the State of England,
with whom I would correspond (both in public and private) if thereby I
could do good to the said State; because I and my familly have lived there
thirty years; that I am of the same Religion that the Church of England does
profess; and that I have a particullar affection to the Nation.

For the bruited correspondence in it self, who, does it concern?

IT may concern the satisfaction of th^se that have (...) this (...) (if they
please to confirm themselves in what I do maintain which is TO TELL TRVTH,)
to take the pains to read the copy of a letter which (...) written so me,
at my going from Paris, where I have now these nine months, troubled my (...)

contrary to the Laws of God, of Nature, the Fundamental Laws of the Land;

Her Se^e, and condition) (...) disobedience of Children (...) Patents, etc*

COPY AND TRVE TRANSLATION OF A LETTER WRITTEN TO ME BY JACQUES D'ELDIMS,
dwelling in the street S* Leu behind La Rue (...) Ours, a V^nneger house,
dated 4 Apprill 1646, Puril.
SIR,
I have thought fit to let you know, that Monsieur des Champs is come to me,
from Monsieur de la Bernadiere and consorts, (Confrators of the Holy Sacrament
as they term themselves to be employed to convert Huguenots and has told me
that if you will become a Roman Catholic, Reconcile your self to the Queen
of England, and cast your self at her feet, it shall be procured that all
your affairs will succeed according to your desire.

It behooves you to know whether your desires and contentments can be assured
by this means; and if you do believe that your peace is easy to be compassed
with the Queen your Mistress; for my part I do give you this advise as it is
put to my charge, to let you know the same, praying you to vvritte thereon
what you think fit, and your intention, that I may make Known to have
acquitted my self of this commission, so Kissing your hands, I rest for ever

SIR.
COPY AND TRVE TRANSLATION OF MY ANSWER TO THE LETTER.
SIR,
I do answer to your Letter of aduis, for which I thank you, though I stand
not in need of any other Confraternity then that of Christians, who have two
Sacraments Instituted by their Chief Christ Jesus, It Is for that profession my
predecessors have shed their blood (...) in the (...) of Monsieur (...), as you
may read: and for me I have suffered for the same from my mothers Womb,
who fled during the persecutions against those of our profession.

And for what concerns the particular title of Roman Catholic, I do answer,
that the Christian says all. That of Roman properly belonging but to him
that'll borne at Rome, from vvheno^, as said, seldom good men (...)

The proposed reconcilliation to the Queen of England seems as strange to me
as the proposed (...), having never offended her in thoughts, words, nor
deeds; so that those who have obliged you to notice their propositions are
wholy mistaken in these two points yet will I not forbear to vvish them
all good, and to commend you for your good will, which obliges me to tell
you that I am the more SIR,

Paris 6 of April 1646.
The Reader being come thus far, may (if he please) remember again what is
said in the first lines of these leaves. Judgment belongs to God and to none
else, for he says Judgment is mine.
And a^ by so doing, he will free himself of that just censvver which those
deserve that judge arnisse, so will he (by the reading of the follovving
lines) be thoroughly informed of the just cause that justly moved me thereunto,
and that I could not (without proving criminal to my self) obmit to mention
the passages contained in the former lines* For an Anatomist cannot proceed to
the demonstration of the figure of the heart of man except he rips up the skin
of the body.

Some kings and Princes (who are abused by pernicious) Counselors) will not
stick to the Observation of the Laws which they themselves have made, not to
those to which they were sworn, Butt abandonne them selves unto a
Licenciousnesse to dispose of the Lives and pocessions of men: But none of them
can dispose of the motions of the heart, nor of any man's good fame.

If their be any peculliar Prerogative in this world sure self defense in
the least questionnable, it is the first Law of nature. Therefore all men are
bound to conclude that those who do vvilfully assaille it do make them selffe
unvvoorthy of the benefist of the Laws of God, the Laws of Nature, the
fondamentall Laws of Empires, and of Nations.

To the heart I have been vvounded, and attempts have been made to my soul,
and therefore no vvonder that I have begun these Lines with the names of my
Parents, their birth, and their profession, likvveise with my birth, and
profession; and consequently with some passages that must argue what I have
professed, vvhiest in effet is the ripping upp of the first skin: On which
Spirist of Darkness and Diluzion have of late endeauioured to put such an
infamous stayne, as neither Antiquity nor Modern times can afforde amore^
horride example.

All which the said Spirits of Darxnesse factionnaris and adherents to
Cottintoniens have been contracted in the persson of Mr. William Crafts, who
undertook his task, to pocesse diverse Noble Famillies in Paris, with a most
false opinion that my Daughters (detained from m^ in the Nunnery) belong to
others: This the Eldest has declared under her own hand, and that when the
said abominable false-hood was uttered by the said Master Craft, she desired
a friend to reprove him, he ansvvered it was to make her a fortune.

A fortune indeed, which the most wicked among the Headens would on such
condition reject, and would for ever banish the word Fortune from their
remembrance.

My self and a virtuous Mother proclaimed the Keepers of these Children, to
have spent their means, belonging to others, horride Monsters, that kept
children from endeavoring their Salvation; and in conclusion by the said
Master Craft's most false relations) become in the Opinion of number of Deluded
persons a Monster, that should have been capable to do that for which I should
justly deserve to be forsaken by God, and abhorred of all mankind; better had
I never been borne, than to be coupable of such a crime; better had I lived all
my days among brute beasts, and not in sight of the Courts of Princes.

My life has been without stain, no man ever savv me pocest with wine, and
sure no man can say that the place of my birth was destroyed by fire and
Brimstone, and that I was driven with my family in a Cave: No man can say of
me (as the World has just cause to maintain of the said Master Crafts) to
have svvarued from the Religion in which I baue been borne and bredd, nor for
any vvorldly preferments; Means to vveake to work on a Christian settled
m^nde; I shall rather chouse to abandonne the Society of mankind, all vvorldly
conforts; Nay, burry my self alive, than to yield to disordinate powers; And
had it not been the hopes to do some good on my poor seduced Children, I
would not have been moved neither by promises of SUFFICIENT ENTERTAINMENT
answerable to my condition, nor by assurances of Royal favors, subscribed by
Eminent Signatures, which Monsieur Brasset the French Resident at the Haghe
did peruse ere I vould stir from thence in August last 1645 to return into
France.

Where (as said before) all my labors on my seduced Children have proved like
the washing of Black mores, my cares and pains having produced to me but some
letters written by those blinded Virgins, but penned by their blind Leaders,
for so their arguments proves them to be, since they have set under their
one hand that they could not hazard to imitatte Joseph when he rane to his
father Jacob to gossen to do their last duty, but with hazard off their
SALVATION, and therefore sent only to me (at my departure) a work Stilled,
DISCOVRSE OF AMABLE BOVRZET, a Priest, who had dedicated a pack of moldy
ordinary tailles, (a nest of Cob-vvebs) to Prince Edward Palatin, Allas
deluded Prince! as if those Lines were to prove as fatal as the vvound
Achiles received in his heel, and (though vvhithout comparaison of quality)
consequently to stay me, that I might be vvraught upon, or constrained to
render my Soul into the snarres of Monsieur Bourzet, who teaches a most
damnable doctrine, as disobedience of Children to Parents, especially in things
in different; which is to see and to hear Parents in a neuther place,
according the Laws of the Land, Which do ordain children to see and consulte
their parents ere they take any religious orders.

All which being finally seconded by the letter written by Iacques d'Eldime
(who dvvels as said before at a Vinnegar man behind Saint Leu, La Rue aux Ours
in Paris) proved a most brutish farvvell; and a souer comfort, to the vvounded
heart of a Father*
