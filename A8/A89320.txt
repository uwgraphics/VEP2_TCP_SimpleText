A New Method of CRYPTOGRAPHY, Humbly presented to The Most SERENE MAJESTY OF
CHARLES the II.

By SAMVEL MORLAND Knight and Baronet, and one of the Gentlemen of His
MAJESTY'S Privy Chamber in Ordinary. 1666.

THE two Correspondents having provided themselves with a sufficient number of
printed Papers delineated and shadowed conveniently for the purpose:

1. They must first of all by a mutual consent, complete their Numerical
Alphabet and Clavis Vniversalis, in like manner as is done Page 5. placing in
the Numerical Alphabet what Letters they please, (some Capital, others small)
from an Unite to 34. and transposing the Numbers contained in each Marginal
Number of the Clavis Universalis, in any broken Order whatsoever, each of them
reserving a Copy.

2. They must agree in what kind of Figure to write to each other; For by those
few Schemes, Page 2, and 3. it is evident, that the various Figures, in which
any Writing of a considerable length may be inscribed, are very numerous.

3. They are to resolve what Number of Nulls they will either prefix, adjoyn,
or intermingle with that Writing; and where those Nulls shall be placed.

4. It is necessary to be concluded, whether they will transcribe what they
intend to Conceal, in Upright Columns, or else by way of Diagonalls, or
otherwise? as likewise whether the Transcription shall be ascending,
descending, Alternate, or Retrograde?

An Example or two will clear all Doubts.

Let A. and B. be Two Correspondents:

1. Let their Numerical Alphabet, and Clavis Universalis, be the same with that
Page 5. 2. Let it be agreed between them, to write to each other in a
Parallelogram, such as is Page 2. Fig. I. 3. Let the Number of Nulls before the
Writing be evermore 3, and after the Writing 4. 4. Let the way of Transcription
be in Upright Columns, and descending.
This done, A. writes to B. the following words: viz. This Way of Writing is of
all other the most facil and expeditious, as well to unlock, as to conceal.

The Method of Hiding.
That is to say, First, He inscribes it in one of the printed Papers delineated
and ready for the purpose, as Page 2. Fig. I. only every other Word (or
thereabouts) he begins with a Capital Letter, for the ease of B. in
Discovering. 2. Then he finds by the small Figures over the Parallelogram,
that his Writing has advanced 9 Columns. 3. Therefore he seeks for 9 in the
Margent of the Clavis Vniversalis, and in the same Row finds (6, 5, 9, 1, 4,
7, 2, 8, 3.) which he places in the void Squares over the said 9 Columns. 4.
This done, he takes the Paper in which he intends to write, and according to
the Agreement aforesaid, prefix 3 Nulls, viz. ( s t l) After that, to let his
Correspondent know, that there are just 9 Columns in the Writing, he puts down
(N) which by the Numerical Alphabet signifies 9. and next to that, another (N)
to signify that there are just 9 Lines; As likewise the following Letter ( d)
to notify, that there are 2 Nulls to complete the Figure; and the next Letter
to that, viz. ( n) that there are 4 Nulls at the latter end. 5. Lastly, He
transcribes all the Columns, beginning first with that which is (1,) and to
that adjoyns the Column over which is (2,) and so to the end; to which he adds
4 Nulls, and sends the Writing to B. thus: s t l N N, d n s t l e l i e c c y g
t t s d o t s l f s e F x s, U o d W i l M a t l k, c h r f T c e s l o T W O r
a p A n c a n o o n i l A a o i h t E u o t p i i a h i d w o n f o a k.


The Method of Discovering.
When B. receives this Writing, First of all (according to the aforesaid
private Agreement) he cancells 3 Letters at the beginning, and 6 at the latter
end, for Nulls; then he finds by the 4th and 5th Letters, viz. (N) and (N)
that the Writing is composed of 9 Columns, and does contain 9 Horizontall
Lines.

Therefore he immediately repairs to his Clavis Universalis, and out of that,
over the head of 9 Columns of one of his printed Papers (delineated and
shadowed for the purpose) he transcribes the following Numbers, viz. (6, 5, 9,
1, 4, 7, 2, 8, 3.) and then, having divided the Writing by a Prick, Line, or
any other Mark of Distinction between each 9 Letters, as is hereafter done, he
inscribes the first 9 Letters in that Column over which is the Figure (1) and
the next 9 Letters in that Column over which is the Figure (2) and so on, till
all the Columns be filled and completed; (where is to be noted by the way,
that He who writes, if he has written all his mind, and there yet remain any
odd blanck Squares, he fills them, and those Letters (such as are ( p d) in
the Example) are always to be Nulls of course.) Which done, the Writing
discovers it self to be the very same with that Page 2. Fig. I. To which there
are also adjoined diverse other different Figures, containing the same form of
words.

Of all the foregoing Methods, this last is the most intricate, and for ought I
know, the most useful and (sure I am) applicable to any Figure whatsoever.

Various Methods of Transcribing the Words conteyn'd in Fig. I. Page 2.
The First Method reads and transcribes the Writing (as before, Page 1.) in
Upright Columns, and descending according to the Numerical Alphabet, and the
Clavis Vniversalis.

ascending, alternately.

descending, (and that in their natural Order, as likewise do all the following
Methods!) not respecting the Numerical Alphabet, or Clavis Vniversalis.

descending, beginning with the first Letter [ T] in the Dexter Point.

ascending, beginning with the the same Letter [ T] in the Dexter Point of the
Figure.

and ascending alternately, from the same Letter [ T.]

and descending alternately, from the same Letter [ T.]

o a i w l c o o e t n s h s e t d i l c n c k l o E F x u t A e a s o s U t l p
o d. By these few Methods of transcribing this first Figure, the Ingenious and
learned Reader will easily perceive, that it may yet be read and transcribed in
a very great number of other different ways and Methods, and that without
altering the Transpositions of the 9 Columns. Now, if this first Figure afford
such variety of Transcriptions without new Transpositions, the other different
Figures afford each of them as many more; And by the Clavis Universalis, Page
5. composed from the Table of Permutation, Page 7. it is evident, that every
such Figure containing but 9 Columns, admits of no less than Three Hundred
Sixty two Thousand, eight Hundred and eighty different Transpositions; And
others of them, as Fig. VI. and VII. containing 18 Columns, admit of Six
Thousand four Hundred and two Millions of Millions, of different
Transpositions; More by Three Hundred seventy three Thousand, seven Hundred and
five Millions; More by Seven Hundred twenty and eight Thousand; And there being
in the Writing 81 Letters, they make an Oblong containing 27 Columns and three
Lines; And consequently such a Figure will admit of
10888869450418352160768000000 distinct Transpositions.

But forasmuch as Examples edify the Reader much better than bare Words, I
have in the 6th Page inserted a longer Writing than the former, in a plain
Parallelogram, consisting of 34 Upright Columns, and containing 20 Lines,
excepting only 2 Nulls at the latter end to complete the Figure.

The Words of the Writing are in French, viz.

Enter les plus belles and admirables Inventions qu' ait jamais produit
l'esprit de l'homme, sans doubt que celle des Chyffres n'y tient pas le dernier
lien, puisque par son moyen nous trauestissons nos pensees, and les desguisons
en sort, qu'elles passent inconnues dans les Pays Ennemis, and sont quelque
fois mieux venues, en Pays de cognoissance, and plus cherement accueilles de
nos Amiss, habilles a l'estrangere, and dans ce desguisement, que si else y
paroissoiens sans Voile, and a la descouuerte. Et veritablement c'est une
raison qui la doit fair beaucoup estimer, comme scauent assez tous ceux qui
font profession de gouuerner en la Politic, ou commander en la Militaire,
lesquels seroient en dainger de voir souuent leurs desseins trahis par
l'infidelite d'un Messager, and leurs pensees descouuertes par la surprise de
leurs Ennemis. tables of cryptographical numerical alphabet The Numerical

I Am not ignorant that there are some Virtuosi of this Saeculum, who vainly
persuade others, and (I believe!) deceive themselves, by pretending that they
are able, by I know not what Analytick Art, to unfold all Mysteries of this
nature whatsoever, and that no Secret can be made so to wander in any Paper-
Labyrinth, But they will find an Ariadnian Clue to trace it in, and fetch it
out.

I must confess, as to the ordinary Methods of Cryptography, (vulgarly termed
Writing in Cipher) where they are weakly contrived, or carelessly written, it is
very possible, with much pains and industry, to gather the Contents; (I have
often done it my self, and seen it done by others!) But where a Cipher is
dexterously composed, and made use of warily, There let any such Pretender show
his ability in making the least discovery, -- and erit mihi Magnus Apollo!) In
the mean time, if he please, he may contemplate the following Reflections upon
the foregoing Method.

1. The foregoing Method is comparatively with others, wonderfully facil and
practicable, forasmuch as it requires very little more pains than a double
Transcription of the Letter to be written, (which is no more than what all
Statesmen do, whether they write in Cipher or no!) And to uncypher or open,
one single Transcription does the Business. 2. Let him consider in how many
Parallelograms, Triangles, and other mixed Figures, any Writing may be
inscribed. 3. The various ways, windings, and turnings by which any Writing
may be transcribed out of any such Figures. 4. The many places each Line
affords for inscribing Nulls, besides the beginning, and latter end; as
likewise whole Columns, which may, by a private accord, be reserved. 5. Into
how many Millions of Millions, of Millions, of Millions, of Millions, of
Millions, of distinct Orders, both the Numerical Alphabet, and Marginal Numbers
of the Classis Universalis, may be transposed, as in the following Table; for
an Explanation whereof, I refer the Reader to Clavius, Kircherus, and others.

Learned Tacquet in his Arithmetic, lib. 5. c. 8. affirms, That the
Permutations of 24 Letters are so numerous, that a Thousand Millions of able
Clerks, in a Thousand Millions of Years, (and that neither sparing Dominicals
or Festivals) were not able to transcribe them! And Guldinus asserts, That the
Books which might be compiled of the variety of 23 Letters only (accounting
500 Pages, or 1000 Faces to each Volumne, and 100 Lines to each Face, and 60
Letters to each Line, and not any two Words in any of those Volumnes the same!)
would do more than twice cover the whole Superficies of the Earth and Sea. Nay
further, he seems to be of opinion, That the Paper of those Volumnes, laid
singly Sheet by Sheet, would cover the very Firmament. Now, if the
Transpositions of 24 Letters be so numerous, what are those of 34 (which are
yet of greatest use in this Method)? The last Sum of the foregoing Table is a
Number consisting of 39 Places, and that for the bare Transpositions of 34
Letters or Numbers: But when each of those shall come to be altered,
intermingled with, and transformed by all the various Figures of Inscription,
Methods of Transcription, and Nulls; I am bold to assert, that the Sum. Tot.
would be greater than that of Archimedes in his PSAITS, whereby he would
express the Number of Sands, which would do more than fill the cavity of a
Sphere equal to the Orb of the Fixed Stars, according to the dimensions of the
Celestial Bodies determined by Aristarchus Samius.

To apply this more closely to the purpose, suppose the Writing, as it lays
hid Page 6. were given to the ablest Cryptograph-Analyst in the World, to open,
or Uncypher; and grant that he knew, that it was written according to some of
the Rules of the foregoing Method.

1. It is impossible for him to divine the Number of Nulls, or where they are
placed.

2. It Is as impossible (without being privy to the Numerical Alphabet) to know
certainly how many Columns, or how many Lines this Writing consists of, or
where those Indicial Letters are placed.

3. Admit he should (which is never to be imagined!) accidentally guess at the
Number of Columns, Lines, Nulls, and Indicial Letters; yet still he is to seek
in what Figure it is inscribed, that is to say, whether in a Parallelogram,
Triangle, Trapezium, Rhomboides, Polygon Simple, Polygon Central, or some other
mixed Figure, or Figures?

4. Put case he knew that it was (as it is) in a Parallelogram; He is but
little nearer his ends than before, unless he knew whether the Transcription
were in Upright Columns, or Diagonalls? And that Descending, Ascending, or
Retrograde? Or whether in Circular, Serpentine, or Horizontal Lines?

5. But imagine he had all these: As likewise that he knew in what Language it
were written, (for that also is no small Difficulty!) He has yet another Task,
which is, to find out the true Transpositions of these 34 Columns, by often
trying, and comparing Columns with Columns; where there are no less than
295288899039603018847618609643519999999 false ways, and but only one, which
is exactly true. Now how any Mortal should hope in all his life time, (were he
sure to live Quadrillions of Trillions, of Billions of Methusalem's years!) to
hit upon so many Heterogeneous Quasita mentioned in the Premises, for which he
has in a manner no Data, it cannot enter into my Understanding. And I leave the
Ingenious Reader to Judge, whether the rolling of Sicyphus his Stone up the
Hill, be not a Labor as likely to succeed as His? But if all this will not
satisfy, Then let such a Pretender give me leave to lead him yet a Step
further, where he will quickly see, what false footing all his Zetetick and
Analytick devices are like to find upon these Steganographical Quicksands: And
that it will be as easy for him to discover the way of an Eagle in the Air,
and to mark out precisely, where that subtle Element has been divided and
closed up again; as to trace a Secret through all the turnings, windings, and
dark Passages of so many Cryptographical Maeanders, Unless he work (and that
most profoundly!) by the Black Art, or else an Angel from Heaven, in kindness,
reveal it to him.

CRYPTOGRAPHIA CRYPTOGRAPHICA duplex, triplex, quadruplex, etc. in infinitum.
LET the Correspondents A. and B. mutually agree, in all Matters of great
importance, to write to each other by a Cryptographia Cryptographica Quadrupla,
for which they have some private Mark. And suppose A. desire to send B. the
following Intelligence:

Sir, Look to your Self; for this Night your Person is to be seized, And the
Castle to be deliverd up to the Enemy by your own Soldiers. 1. It is accorded
between them, that whatsoever they write, must be inscribed in 4 distinct
Figures: the first whereof is to be a Rectangle Parallelogram, as Page 9. Fig.
1. The 2d Figure a Rhomboides, as Page 9. Fig. 2. The 3d a Rectangle Triangle,
as Page 10. Fig. 3. And the 4th a Trapezium, as Page 10. Fig. 4.

2. These 4 Figures are to be inscribed, and read as follows:

The First Figure is to be inscribed in Horizontal Lines, and to be read in
Upright Columns, and descending (according to the foregoing Precept) by the
Numerical Alphabet, and Clavis Universalis. The Second Figure is likewise to be
inscribed in Horizontal Lines, and to be read in Upright Columns; that is to
say, The first Upright Column of the First Figure, makes the first Horizontal
Line of the Second Figure. And so the second Upright Column of the First
Figure, makes the second Horizontal Line of the Second Figure; And so all the
Columns of the First Figure is to be inscribed into the Second Figure one
after the other in their Order.

The Third Figure is to be inscribed in Horizontal Lines, that is, The first
Upright Column of the Second Figure makes as many, or as few Horizontal Lines
of the Third Figure, as it falls out to be longer or shorter, (beginning with
the Vertex or Rectangle of the Third Figure.) Thus of ( o r n u s e e) the
first Letter ( o) makes the first Horizontal Line of the Third Figure; and ( r
n u) make the second; and ( see) make a part of the Third, which ( i r) the two
first Letters of the second Upright Column of the Second Figure make good; And
the following Letters ( s C D e o o s) make the fourth Horizontal Line; And so
on, till the Third Figure be fully completed.

But now the Third Figure is to be read, (not in Upright Columns, but) in
Diagonal Lines, according to the following Method, That is to say, Beginning
with the Diagonal Line ( r b e t t n y, etc.) from Numb. (1) under the
Hypotenuse of the Figure; And so ascending to the Letter ( o) at the Vertex,
and from thence descending to ( a) which answers to Numb. (2); Then again
beginning with the Letters ( n n e e t y, etc.) of the Diagonal Line answering
to Numb. (3) and ascending to ( n) in the Angle, and from thence descending to
the Letter ( i) which answers to Numb. (4). Then repeating the same Thing from
Numb. (5) to Numb. (6), Then from Numb. (7) to Numb. (8); And so on, till the
Figure be as it were wound off to nothing.

The Fourth and last Figure is to be inscribed in Alternate Diagonals, Thus,
namely of the Letters [ r b e u t n y s s r o] of the first Diagonal Line of
the third Figure, A. places the first Letter [ r] in the Dexter Point of the
fourth Figure. Then, leaving the two next Squares void, he fills the third
Diagonal with the 3 next Letters [ b e u] After which he leaves another
Diagonal void, and the fourth Diagonal he fills with the Letters [ t n u s s]
And so he proceeds, till the whole Writing be inscribed.

This done, A. might fill the void Diagonals with Nulls; But supposing him to
be in the Enemies Country, and fearing his Letter may fall into their hands,
and he be constrained to open the Writing, he fills the void Diagonals with
another Discourse altogether different from the former, viz.

Dear Cousin, I do not a little wonder at your long silence, and am exceeding
fearful, that some accident has befallen you since your arrival. After which
Writing he puts six Nulls [ p l s a d d] to fill up all. But of this more at
large in the Method of Opening, or Discovering the forementioned Intelligence.

3. This fourth Figure is to be read in Upright Columns, according to the
foregoing Method, by the Numerical Alphabet, and Clavis Vniversalis, and so
transcribed fairly, as it ought to be sent to B. leaving only room for 13
Letters at the beginning of the second Line.

4. Of the 13 Letters at the beginning of the 2d Line (which are to serve for
Indices, or Exponents!) the first three serve to expound the first Inscription
or Figure, the three next, the second Figure; the three following serve for the
third Figure, and the last three for the fourth: That is to say,

The first Letter [ T] gives B. to understand, that the first Figure consists
of 10 Columns; The next Letter [ f], that there are in it just 11 Lines; The
third Letter [ d], that there are two Nulls to complete the Figure.

The fourth, fifth, and sixth Letters [ k T s] let B. know, that the second
Figure has 20 Columns, 10 Lines, and no Nulls to complete it. For [ s] and all
other Letters that are not found in the Numerical Alphabet, may be used at
pleasure, to signify Negatives; as here [ s] signifies that there are no Nulls
to complete the second Figure.

The seventh, eighth, and ninth signify, that the Base of the third Figure
contains 21 Places, the Lines thereof are eleven, and the Nulls to lengthen out
the last Line eleven, viz. [ s p k m d a s w x n a.]

The tenth, eleventh, and twelfth denote, that the Columns of the fourth
Figure are 27, the Lines 11, and the Nulls 3. viz. [ n f n.] And the thirteenth
and last Letter [ G] serves to inform B. that there are 6 Nulls at the latter
end of the Writing, as A. sends it to him. All which may be seen by the
respective Figures, in which are the 4 Transcriptions.

The Method of Discovering what is before, by a Quadruple Inscription, hidden.
1. WHen B. receives the Writing, The first thing he does, is to draw a Line
under, or to put some other Mark of distinction upon the 13 first Letters of
the 2d Line of the said Writing, which he knows to be Indices of the 4 Figures.

2. That done, by the 10th and 11th of those Letters, [ H f] he marks with
pricks, as here underneath is expressed, the first Figure of Transcription,
(which by the forementioned Accord, he knows to be a Trapezium!) And then
transcribes the Writing into that Figure, till it be completed; as it is, Page
10. Fig. 4. omitting only a certain Number of Nulls, which are easily known by
the 13th and last of those Indices, viz. [ G]

3. In the next place, he dashes out all the alternate Diagonal Lines of that
Figure, commencing from the Letter [ r] in the Dexter Point of the Figure
exclusive, which by the same private Agreement were destined for Nulls, (or at
least for Disguises) And then transcribes the remainder into a
Rectangle-Triangle, of whose Height and Hypotenuse, the 7th and 8th Letters of
the 2d Line of the Writing, are sufficient Indices, only a certain Number of
Nulls, denoted by the 12th Index, viz. [ n] are omitted.

In the 4th place, having, by the 4th and 5th Indices, with points or pricks,
determined by limits, the 3d Figure of Transcription (which he knows is a
Rhomboides) he fills and compleats it out of the Rectangle-Triangle, omitting
only so many Letters for Nulls, as [ f] the 9th Letter of that 2d Line,
indigates.

Lastly, By the first, 2d, 3d, and 6th Letters, he determines and fills the 4th
and last Figure of Transcription, (which was the first Figure of Inscription)
and consequently he has before his eyes what he sought for, which I do not
believe the Understanding of any Mortal man were, by any other means than by
being privy to the forementioned Accord, ever able to discover.

I have here underneath inserted the Scheme of that first Figure of
Transcription, (or 4th Figure of Inscription,) that so by it, the Reader may
plainly discern the manner of performing all the rest.

But forasmuch as those who write much in a Crytographical Method, have often
times occasion to hide a Word, or short Sentence, and not a whole Page, or
Letter, I have thought it convenient (besides those Printed Papers which I have
provided of all sorts) to publish the Description and Use of a small portable,
and low-priz'd Machina, very useful for that purpose.

A Description of the MACHINA CYCLOLOGICA CRYPTOGRAPHICA.
THe lower part of the Instrument consists of two Circular Plates, the one
turning round on a Center within the other, And in that which turns there are
25 small holes or Foramina at an equal distance. And both above, and beneath
those 25 foramina, there are 25 Letters, as Page 12. Fig. I.

The upper part or lid is a Circular Plate, the inner part whereof is curt
away, and upon the inner Limb thereof 25 Letters graved, and in it a small
hole or window. And those 25 Letters in any broken Method whatsoever, ( vid.
Fig. II, III, IV, and V.) only the two Correspondents must have each of the
same Alphabet, in the very same Order, Letter for Letter: For Example, let
their Alphabet be this, viz. h q f r e i s d k s v l c t m y b x n w o z g a p.

The Use of this Machina.
Let the Correspondents A. and B. agree,

1. That one of those 25 Letters shall be their Key, suppose ( m).

2. That a certain number of Nulls (suppose 3) shall be placed between the 3d
and 4th Letter of the Writing, and another number of Nulls ( viz. 4.) at the
latter end.

Then, let A. write to B. these words:

Your Brother betrays you. The Method of Hiding.
First, A. with the Digital Index (which is to be put on the third Finger of
the Right hand, that so he may not be constrayn'd to lay down his Pen, at every
motion, vid. Fig. VI.) turns the Letter ( m) which is the Key, under the Window.

2. He puts the small end of the Digital Index into the foramen or hole under
the Window, and turns about the moveable Plate, till the small end of the Index
stand over against the first Letter of what he is to hide, and the Letter that
appears through the Window is ( b), which he sets down; This done, he puts the
Index again under the Window, and turns it over against the 2d Letter of the
Writing, viz. ( o), and then ( f) appears, which he sets down likewise; And
thus he repeats the same thing till the Writing be finished, only between the
3d and 4th Letters he intermingles 3 Nulls, viz. ( p w x), and adds 4 Nulls,
viz. ( n p s o) at the end; And then the Writing stands thus, viz.

table of cryptographical transcription Y o u r B r o t h e r b e t r a y e s y
o u b f d p w x y t z d t i h k s q d y m b l n o s l n p s o



Here by the way it is observable, that of this Writing, as it is hidden, the
Letter ( d) is thrice found; in one place it stands for u, in another for o, in
a third for t. Thus l, for e and u; and s, for o and b; and t, for b and t. In
fine, the nature of this Machina is such, that in long Writing each Letter of
the Alphabet may stand both for it self and all the rest, which makes the
Intrigue a thousand times more difficult, and leaves the Discoverer in infinite
Doubts, and Uncertainties.

The Method of Discovering.
When B. receives this Writing, he immediately knows where the Nulls are, and
cancells them; then placing the Key ( m) in the Window of his Machina, he turns
it about, till the first Letter of the Writing, as it is hidden, viz. ( b)
appear through the Window, and look what Capital Letter in the Cover, answers
to the small end of his Index (which he is not to take out till he has
observed!) That is the first Letter of the given Intelligence. Again, he puts
the Point of his Index in the hole under the Window, and turns it about till
the 2d Letter of the same Writing, viz. ( f) appear, and That is the 2d Letter
of the Intelligence; And this B. repeats, till the whole be discovered; and
then it stands thus:

table of cryptographical transcription b f d * * * y t z d t i h k s q d y m b
l n o s l * * * * y o u r b r o t h e r b e t r a y e s y o u



AND THAT this Method may not appear to be less secure than the other, I shall,
to satisfy the Reader's curiosity, show him how it may be hidden doubly,
trebly, etc. in infinitum.

For Example,

Let the Writing singly hidden stand as underneath, and a 2d Key being
foredetermined between them, suppose ( p), A. places it under the Window, and
then turns it about till the Point of the Index stand against the first Letter
of the simply-hidden Writing, viz. ( b), and in the Window appears ( g), which
he sets down for ( b): And thus for ( f) he finds ( b) and so to the end,
putting between the 3d and 4th Letters 3 Nulls, and 4 at the latter end.

After this very manner may this also be hidden by a third and different Key,
and Alphabet, For so is the Machina contrived, that any Alphabet may be
inscribed and shifted, at pleasure, either in the moveable Plate, or the Cover,
vid. Fig. 2d, 3d and 4th.

And for a clearer proof of what has been asserted, The very same Sentence
which is here underneath, by the help of that Machina, concealed, is also
expressed Word for Word, and Letter for Letter; And which is most of all,
without any Nulls or insignificant Characters; To see, if there be any Artist
in the World who is able, by any lawful means, or certain Rules, to give the
true Genesis, and Analysis of that, or any such Cryptographical Writing; And to
discover the Original Alphabet, of each respective Permutation, by determining
the several Stations and Aspects of the Literae Exemtiles, and their Nova
Clavis; and from what Foramina they are to be turned on and off by the help of
the Digital Index, and consequently how each Superior Letter is signified by
its Inferior, and no other.
