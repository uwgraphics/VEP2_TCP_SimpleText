A Funeral Elegy upon the most Honored upon Earth, and now glorious in Heaven,
His Excellency Robert Devereux Earl of Essex and Ewe, Viscount Hereford, Lord
Ferrers of Chartly Bourchier and Lovaine, late General of England.
What do our sighs and tears when Essex dies,
They are for him but petty Obsequies.
For when such Hero's use to fall a sleep
The drops of rain show that the heavens weep;
And those huge storms, which since his death have fell
Say that the world with very grief does swell.
As heavy breathings are thrown all about
Puffing at what is left for what is out.
What then do lines, why do the Muses try
To groan out, not to speak thy Elegy;
And why does each profane hand to thy hearse
Presume to offer up a mourning verse?
Grief makes men cry, and each Plebean head
Does scan his sighs with pains not scanteled:
The more we see, the more we see our loss;
When all affairs are now upon the toss.
Thy birth was Noble, but thy virtue more,
Which in the house of fame has laid a store
That will endure whilst that a pen can run,
Or mortal threads of life by fate be spun:
Thy theme will Volumes fill, and thy fair shade,
Of making books will urge a constant trade:
Sorrow strikes dum, in this we all are laid,
I can say nothing, but I would have said.
Henry Mill.
