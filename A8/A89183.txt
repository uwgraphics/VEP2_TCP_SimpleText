Mr William Prynn his Defense of STAGE PLAYS.
Or a Retractation of a former book of his called Histrio-Mastix.
WHereas this Tyrannical, abominable, lewd, schismatic, haeretical Army,
are bent in a wilful and forcible way to destroy all Lawful Government; and
to compass those ends, have lately infringed the Privileges of Parliament,
being a thing contrary to all Customs, Laws, Statutes, Examples, Pecedents and
precepts, as I have at large discoursed in my last book, and brought a whole
Army of proofs against them; (Origin, Philo Iud. Tertullian, Lactantius,
Eusebius, Ambrose, Gregory, Augustine, Cyprian, Hieronimus, Basilius,
Nazianzen, Athanasius, Chrysostomus, Barnard, Tho. Aquinas, Hook Eccl. Calvin,)
for it is easy to be proved by the Fathers, and all Christian Writers, That
Authority Lawful is to be obeyed; I cannot yet be silent in a thing of so
great moment; but must make known to the People of England, and to all the
world, to all sorts of men, nay, to men and Angels, those exorbitant courses in
which they persist still: It is not long ago, and therefore too lately to be so
soon forgotten, how Colonel Pride and diverse others of the the Army did stop
the Members of Parliament from doing of their duty in a most forcible,
unlawful, seditious, mutinous, unexampled, and unparraleld way; among that
multitude of faithful Patriots and Parliament men, they seized also upon me,
carried me away by force, and restrained me of my liberty, for no offense, but
only endeavoring to discharge my conscience, which is a thing I shall always
do, without fearing any man, any arm of flesh, any Potentacie, Prelacy,
superintendency, or power terrestiall or internal; and have done, witness my
often sufferings from the Court, from the Lords, and from the Prelates, when I
durst maintain the truth without fear of either King, Lords, Prelates,
Presbyterians, or Independents. But I let this pass, having already at large
written about that injury; but now there is another fresh occasion, which has
incited my just indignation against this wicked and Tyrannical Army, they did
lately in a most inhumane, cruel, rough, and barbarous manner take away the
poor Players from their Houses, being met there to discharge the duty of their
callings; as if this Army were fully bent and most traitorously and maliciously
set to put down and depresse all the Kings Friends, not only in Parliament but
in the very Theaters; they have no care of Covenant or any thing else, but
being most faedifragous would deprive the King of all his Rights and
Prerogatives, which they are bound by the Covenant to maintain; and was it not
always an allowed Prerogative to Kings and great Princes to have Players for
their Recreations, which I am verily persuaded they are as little able to
answer for considering their Covenant, as for their other illegal action
toward us in the Parliament.

But now I know what the malicious, ill-spoken, clamorous, and obstreperous
people will object against me; namely, That I did once write a Book against
Stage Plays, called Histrio-mastix, for which I underwent a cruel censure in
the Starchamber. I confess it is true, I did once so, but it was when I had
not so clear a light as now I have; and it is no disparagement for any man to
alter his judgment upon better information, besides it was done long ago, and
when the King (whose virtues I did not then so perfectly understand) governed
without any control, which was the time that I took the better to show my
conscience and courage, to oppose that power which was the highest, but had I
truly known the King, I must confess with sorrow, I should not have compared
him to Nero the most wicked of the Roman Emperors (as I did in that book) for
loving of Stage Plays; nor have given the Queen those bitter and cruel words
of whore and strumpet, for playing a part in Mr Montagues Pastoral, but I have
suffered for that long ago, and am now ready to suffer, in discharging my
conscience, under what power so ever is now set up to Martyr me.

But that Plays are lawful things, and are to be allowed as recreations for
honest men, I need not quote many Authors to prove it, it will serve the turn,
if I do but tell you that many good men have been Authors of Comaedies and
Tragaedies; and many of them Christians (Buchanon, Grotius, Hensius,
Barclaius,) there are also many ancient Comaedians and Tragaedians among the
Heathen, which were men of no ill note, (Menander, Soploches, Aeschylus,
Euripides, Aristoplanes, Terentius, Plautus, Seneca) and whereas I did quote
many Fathers and other Ancient Christian Authors against Stage Plays, I
confess I was not perfectly advised in all the circumstances belonging to them,
being not such Plays as were written and acted in England of late, for the
Recreation of our most gracious King and Queen, and many of their best friends:
and therefore distinctions ought to be used in those cases; for all Plays are
not of one nature; and virtues, magnanimity, chastity, sobriety, temperance,
justice, modesty, goodness, etc. may be taught in Plays, and many men have been
made the better for seeing of them. And whereas diverse objections have been
made against Stage Plays, for that many of them are profane, many of them have
swearing and blaspheming in them, many of them have cozening, cheating,
legedemain, fraud, deceit, jugglings, impostures, and other lewd things, which
may teach young people evil things, and corrupt good manners, I do also my self
speak against such Plays, and will not at all maintain them, much less would
I be content to suffer in such a cause as that were. But that honest Plays may
be tolerated, and not to be forbidden by any Army under heaven, I do maintain
before all the world. It is true that some have objected against Stage Plays,
that there is an unlawful thing used in them, which is against a place in the
Old Testament (and is urged by Dr Reinolds and other reverend men against
Plays) namely, that men or boys do wear the apparel of women, being expressly
forbidden in the Text. To this I answer, first, that if this be all, it is a
fault may be easily amended; and we may do in England, as they do in France,
Italy, Spain, and other places, where those which play women's parts, are women
indeed; and so there no offense against that place. But then again it may be
objected, That that is more wanton then if boys acted women's parts, and more
apt to engender loose thoughts; and I my self am of that opinion, And therefore
do desire rather to maintain that tenent, That men's putting on of women's
apparel is not again the Scripture in a plain and ordinary sense; for it had a
farther meaning, as one of the Rabbis affirms; for it was a custom of men in
those days, when they prayed to Rimmon who was Mars, that they put on women's
apparel, to seem like to Venus, and so to please that false god; and women,
when they prayed to Ashtaroth who was Venus, put on men's apparel, to seem like
to Mars, and so to please that goddess. And therefore I think, because this
scruple is satisfied, I may conclude that good Plays, which are not profane,
lewd, bad, blasphemous, or ungodly, may be acted; and that this wicked and
tyrannical Army ought not to hinder, to impede, let, prohibit, or forbid the
acting of them; which I dare maintain to all the world; for I was never afraid
to suffer in a good cause.

FINIS.
