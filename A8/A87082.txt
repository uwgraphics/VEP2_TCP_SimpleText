A HYMN Called Englands Hosanna to GOD, for the Restoration, and Coronation of
Charles the second, In Imitation of that Song, sung by the Angels, Glory be to
God.
Stan. the first.
THou that did first employ this Quire,
With such a Spirit me inspire;
Make me the Organ, but the breath
Be thou, or else my life is death.
My soul cannot thy, Glory give,
Unless by thee, it move, and live.
Soul of my soul, some pity take
On me, that Call for Jesus sake;
Else how shall I give thee Glory,
That am so sinful Transitory!
Do thou in me make thy abode,
Then Glory shall I give my God.
Stan. 2.
It Is now I feel a holy flame,
I am all fired to praise thy Name;
The Altars Coals new kindled are,
And high Perfumes fetched from a fur:
Strong Fragrant smells they cast abroad
In Glory of the Lord our God;
For Joys within, and Joys without,
We David-like do dance about;
And cause we have to dance and sing,
Thou have brought home, and Crowned our King.
Then Glory to thy Name, O Lord,
Who have our King, and Church Restored.
Stan. 3.
Oh that thou would each soul invite
Communicants to this delight,
Then shall our Harmony surpass
All Quires that are or ever was.
Vollies of glory shall we give
To thee, that do for ever live.
We glory give for that our birth
Is high from Christ, though low from Earth:
We glory give for that again,
The bones do live that seemed slain:
Then glory to thy Name, O Lord,
Who have our King Crowned and restored
Stan. 4th.
Triumphant Arches we do rear,
Exceeding all that ever were:
And it becomes us so to do:
Thou gave us life and sav'dst us too.
Our honor was trod in the dirt,
We stripped were unto our shirt.
A bondage laid upon our soul
By them that knew how to control;
Our Joys exiled and ravished,
And Charles our life lay murdered;
Then glory to thy Name, O Lord,
That Charles have Crowned and restored.
Stan. 5.
Let us this to our Children tell,
And so Re-print this Miracle,
That it may never be forgot,
That we now are, which erst were not;
Like Lazarus in Grave we lay,
Little differing from cold Clay.
We durst neither act, nor speak,
Though our Hearts were like to break:
From Foreign coasts at last was brought
Him which with tears was so long sought.
Then glory to thy Name, O Lord,
Who have our King Crowned and Restored.
Stan. 6.
Ashes our bread, and drink our tears,
Our hopes all darkened by our fears;
The heavenly Manna Locked up,
And Poison given us to sup.
The Clergy were the very scum,
That never near a Text could come;
What God gave, was not our own,
We into loathsome Gaols were thrown,
The Land oppressed, the King exiled,
The Father armed against his Child;
But thou have caused us to accord,
By Crowning of great Charles our Lord.
Stan. 7.
Deprest a long time we did lie,
Cause England did in England die;
Gracious Kings when they do fall,
Nations in them have Funeral:
Albion in our Charles did bleed,
Good Kings, great Kingdoms do exceed;
To GOD we therefore praises give,
Cause England does in England live:
How can a body but be dead,
That destitute is of a head?
Decollated we were, O Lord,
Till thou our Charles Crowned and restored.
Stan. 8.
Oh that three Kingdoms then would raise
Unto thy Name all fitting praise,
And offer up their Incense, till
They did thy blessed Nostrils fill,
That thou a savor sweet might find,
From every good, and grateful mind;
That so under the Pious wing
Of Charles the Good, we long may sing,
With Wisdom Crown this mighty Lord,
Given us of thy free accord.
Thus glory to thy Name, O Lord,
That Charles the second have restored.
