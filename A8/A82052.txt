TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE FRANCIS, Lord Willoughby, Lord Lieutenant of the County
of Lincoln, and of the City of the County of Lincoln.
Showing,
THat considering the many unhappy distractions lately grown in the Church and
Commonwealth, through the malicious practice of a Malignant party, laboring
to breed Jealousies between the King and his People; we are enforced to
express in this our humble Declaration, our desires and Resolutions, to spend
our lives and estates, in defense of his Majesty's Person, the true Protestant
Religion, the peace of the Realm, the maintenance of the Rights and
Privileges of Parliament, the Law of the Land, and the lawful liberty of the
Subject according to our late Protestation against all such as shall attempt to
separate his Majesty from his great and faithful Counsel of Parliament, and
by that means to alienate his Majesty's affection from his loyal Subjects,
and this our Declaration, we humbly desire your Lordship to Represent from us
to the high and Honorable Court of Parliament.

June 24.
