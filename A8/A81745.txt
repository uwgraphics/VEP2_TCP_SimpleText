THE EPISTLE to the READER.
Reader,
I Am once more come upon on the Stage, not without a Blush; yet not because I
am unwilling to have my Doctrines brought to Light, (as G. W. G. W. voice of
wisdom, p. 3.
would make thee believe.) For I am so far from being ashamed of them, that
could the whole world be brought within the reach of my voice, upon a due call,
I would make a Confession of my Faith. Nor yet because I am conscious to my
self, of wronging the Quake^s* in my relation of the Disputes between us;
either by laying down things in their Names, which they never spoke, or
diminishing from their words, or making false constructions (to use the very
words of G. Whithead's Charge) For let any understanding man peruse the Book,
In Epist to the Reader.
(which occasions this Reply) and he will find, that either I am charged with
falsehood, in such passages as have many and credible witnesses to attest the^r
truth; or else in particular words, as in putting Sanct^fic^tion for
righteousness w thin, by which alteration (if any such there were) no wrong
was done to their meaning. And as for any false construction of their words, if
thou think it worth the while to compare my false, and this man's true
construction, either thou see not with my eyes, or thou will see that they
have no cause of complaint. I have followed my present Antagonist step by step,
and omitted nothing that has the least color of Scripture, or ^eason, (unless
where I make a reference to my former Book, to avoid repetition) lest he should
say, that like a child, I Skip what I cannot read. Only I confess, I am not
able to match him at his Billingsgate Rhetoric, nor wo^ld I with Jonah, be as
hot as the Sun that scaldes me. For I make account (as once a Learned man said)
that so much as there is of undue passion, so much of nothing to the purpose
For there Reason spends upon a false sent, and forsakes the Question started. I
trust that thou will be more confirmed in thy bad opinion of the Quakers, and
that the dust which they raise with their feet, I shall blow away, I mean,
cross their endeavors to hide their meaning in doubtful words, either out of
ignorance, not being Masters of their own Notions, or (which I rather believe)
out of design, it being true of them, which Job speaks of the Thief, If one
know them, they are in the terrors of the shadow of death, Job 24.17. I hope
thou will not be biased by their seeming humility, for pride may be the root
that bears that Branch. The Apostle speaks of a voluntary humility, which was
the effect of being vainly puffed up by a fleshly mind, Col. 2.18. And sure I am,
that if one part of the character which the Bishop of Alif in the Council of
Trent, gave of the Protestants, (viz.) that they had Orthodoxos Mores, i. e. an
Orthodox Conversation, be as true of the Quakers, as it was of the Protestants;
yet the other part, (viz.) that withal they had Haereticam Fidem, i. e. an
Hetorodox or Heretical Belief, is as true of these men, as it was false of
those. And thou will find, In the ^^^ep.
that particularly G. W. lays the most innocent Truths under the odious
imputation of Antichrists deceits.

That thou may not know the depths of Satan as they speak, Rev. 2.24. But
may hold fast that Doctrine which thou have already, v. 25. is the Prayer of

Thy Servant in the work of the Gospel Tho. Danson.
Sandwich, Aug. 15, 1659.
QUESTION 1. Concerning the Light of Christ.
THO. Darson says, the Lights mentioned, viz. natural and supernatural are
two, and though all have the one, yet but few have the other.


G. W. Ans. The life of Christ is the Light of men, and that is not natural,
but spiritual, and thou might as well count the Life of Christ natural, as
count it (the Light) so.


T. D. Reply 1. The distinction of natural or supernatural or spiritual Light
we have, Rom 1.17, 20. Where the revelation of righteousness in the Gospel is
opposed to the knowledge of the Godhead, which men attain to by the Creation,
Ch 2.14 The Gentiles are said by nature to do the things con^ained in the Law,
and are said to be a Law to themselves; when yet withal it is affirmed that they
had not the Law (viz. revealed) or the Oracles of God, for they were committed
to the Jews only at that time, chapter 3.2. 2. And to that silly Argument, that I
might count the life of Christ natural, as well as the light, I answ^r, that
there is a life of Christ natural, ( viz. whereof Christ is the author as God)
as well as spiritual (whereof he is the author, as God-man) John 1.3. All
things were made by him, with all their qualities and properties, and
whatsoever goes to the making them what they are, which so far as it intends
life, may be explained by Acts 17.25. He (God) gives to all life and breath.
Or if there be not such a n^^ural life, then Plants, Bruits, and all Man^^nd
have a spiritual life (an absurdity to gross to lodge in the brain of any
other man, but a Qua^er.)


T. D charged R.H. with saying the true Light has not come over and
comprehended thee.


G W. Ans. That Is false, he said no such thing, for the Light has comprehended
thee, but thou art not come into it, nor have comprehended it


T. D. Reply. My credit will go further than thine, G W. R. H did say as was
related, but perhaps he meant as thou say, that I was not come over to
c^mprehend the true Light.


Tho. D. charged us with consenting that the knowledge o^ the Gospel is
vouchsafed to every man.


G.W. Ans. No such thing d^d we consent to, but that there were some in
darkness, so that their ignorance of the Gospel does not argue that they had
not that light in them, that was able o b^ing them to know the Gospel but
rather that they disobeyed the l^ght of God in them, and liked not to retain
God in their k owledge.


T.D. Reply. My words are, If you meaning be that the Gospel is vouchsafed by
Christ to every man, I expect your proof: And R. H. by silence consented tha^
that was their meaning, Quak^rs Folly, p. 2. If your mean^ng be that all men
have the Lig^t of the Gospel w^thin them, only all do not obey it, it is
contrary to the Scripture. Ephesians. 5.8. H opposes the state of darkness in which
they were, to their present state of light; or if you^ meaning be (for the
words are doubtful) that all men have a spiritual capacity to understand the
Gospel when preached to them that is false, as appears by 1 Cor. 2 14 The
na^ural man receives not the things of the Spirit o^ God, neither can he know
them, etc. no more than the blind eye can discern a visible Object.


T. D. brought Psalm. 147.19, 20. and that by the statutes and judgments are
meant the supernatural light or knowledge of the Gospel.


G.W. Ans. That makes for what I said, for that may be showed to a people which
they know not: And this Priest has confuted himself, for if these statutes
were the knowl^dge of the Gospel, Why did I^rael not know them who had them?


T.D. Reply. If the Intent of the phrase, showing, be no more than that the
Gospel was preached, yet even that the Gentiles wanted at that time. The light
of the Gospel did not shine to them (as we may suppose the Sun might do, if all
the world were bl^nd) He has not dealt so with any Nation, (i. e. not showed
them as to Israel) Psalm 147 20. To the Question, Why Israel did not know the
Statutes, who had them? I answer, Ignorance of them is not here attributed to
the Jews, but to any other Nation except them. The Relative they has for the
Antecedent any Nation, not Jacob and Israel.


T.D. says, Romans 2.15. is spoken of natural light opposed to the knowledge of
the Jews.


G. w. Ans. It Is spoken of the work of the Law, which Law was written in their
hearts, and this Law was spiritual, and not a natural light.


T.D. Reply. Seeing you do not understand the difference between the Law, and
work of the Law in the heart, I Will teach you: By the Law in the heart, is meant
an inward and spiritual conformity thereunto, which is called the Law, as the
impression of the Seal upon a Letter or Bond, is called the Seal; which
conformity lies in these, among other things; viz A consent to the Law that it
is good, Romans 7.1^. A read^n sse to obedi^nce, Heb. 10.9. And a bringing into
captivity ^very thou^ht to the obedience of Christ, as the Apostles exp ssion
is, 2 Cor. 10.5. But by the work of the Law is m^ant, the knowl^dge of sin,
which is by the Law, Romans 3 20 And the eff^cts of that knowl dge in Con c^ nce,
viz. a t^stimony to t^eir obedience or disob^dienc^ together w th approbation
or censure, Romans 2 15 And hough the Law b^ spiri ual, yet the work of it in the
Gentiles is but natural, v. 14. The Gentiles do by nature (ma^k the exp
essenesse of the phrase) the things co^^^ned in the Law.


T. D. Christ was not to be a light to the Gentiles till his coming in the
flesh.


G.W. Ans. What then was Christ's presence in the flesh among all the Gentiles
whom he did enl^ght n? What darkness is this? Seeing h^s outgoing h^ve b ^n
from of old. And what became of all the G ntiles that died before the days of
Christ in the Flesh? Were they condemned because they had no light of Christ
given them, or because they disobeyed the light which they had?


T. D. Reply. 1. Till the time of Christ in the ^^^sh, the Gospel was not
preached to the G^ntile-world; but I did not say (as you ^mply) that Ch^^st did
preach it in his own person to them: Christ did honor the Ministry of the
Apostles above his own, by the larger extent of their Commission. As for
Christ's outgoings from of old, that passage taken out of M cah 5 2. intends
Christ's eternal ge^e^ation and e^^rnal designation to the Office of Mediator,
not any knowledge of Ch is it vouchsafed throughout all ages to the whole world.
To your last Question I answer, that the Gentiles before Christ perished for
disobeying the L^ght they had, Romans 2.12. But yet their ignorance of Christ was
the occasion of their condemnation for that disobedience, Acts 4.12. Neither is
there salv^tion in any o her, for there is none other Name under Heaven given
among men, wher^by we must be saved. Their disobeying that light d d damn them,
but their obed^ence to it could not have saved them without Christ, and Christ
saves n^ne but those who know him.

[What follows in p. 11, 12, 13, 14. of G W. Books, is nothing but what has b
n answered in Qu. Folly, and therefore I shall omit them]


QUESTION 2. Of the Doctrine of Perfection.
T.D Says, p 9. your Doctrine of Pe^fection is against the Tenor of the
Scripture, and to prove it, he b^^ng^ Job 9.20 and he says, p 11. the
Perfection Paul d^nies is the state of the resurrection, which is to be wi h^ut
sin.


G.W Ans. Here he has wronged the Scriptures, for they do not say that
Perf^ction is against the Tenor of them, for God commands Pe^fection. And Paul
denied not the state of the resu^rection, for he said, If you be risen with
Christ, etc And he denied not freedom from sin, Romans 6.18, 22. Job 9 20, 21
proves not, that Job was not without sin, when God had delivered him out of
that affliction, wh rein he had said, If I say I am perfect, etc. but after
this Job was perfect.


T.D. Reply. All the Scriptures which require repentance and mortification
during this life, do deny the possibility of Perfection. For they and it are
incompatible. As for the commands they are the measure of our duty, not of our
ability to obedience. There Is no reason to the contrary, but that Gods commands
should run in the old style, though we are unable to fulfill them. As for Col.
3.1. which he quotes, it is plain that that resurrect, with Christ, was
consistent with sin, v. 5. Mortify therefore your members which are upon the
earth; By members we are to understand inordinate desires, motions and actions
of corrupt nature (such as are reckoned up in the verse) By mortifying them, a
c^nstant endeavor to repress and subdue them. And the Argument to enforce the
duty of mortification is drawn (as from their death with Christ, and life with
him,) so from their first and spiritual resurrection with him. But the state of
the resurrection which Paul denies, is of that perfection of holiness (as I
told you G.W.) which accompanies the last and bodily resurrection. As for Romans
6.18 22. I answered it in my Book, p. 47. The Apostle explains himself, that he
means from the dominion of sin, v 14. And for Job it is plain enough, that the
Character given of Job, viz. a perfect man, was before his affl^ctions, and not
after (as G W. would make the Reader believe) for Gods commendation of him for
his perfection and uprightness, v. 8. was the occasion of the Devils desiring
leave of God to afflict him, v. 11. and of Gods grant, (that his words might be
found true) v. 12.


T.D. p. 12. A Believers person with his works are accepted with God, though
his works be not perfect.


G.W. Ans. Here he would have believers like the Priests, who sin in the best
of their performances (as they confess) But I say the Believers works are
wrought in God, and God works them in them, and these works of God are perfect.


T.D. Rep^y, As for our confeossin, it is agreeable to Scripture, Eccles. 7.20
There is not a just man upon earth, that does good, and sins not, i. e. that
sins not in doing good. Exodus 28.38. In^quity of holy things is there spoken
of, Duties which are holy for the matter, are in^quity for the manner of
pe^formance. Your argument does no more conclude for the perfection of Grace,
than it does that every child should be a man the first day of his birth, for
that is one of Gods works, as well as Grace. As for Saints, they may be said to
be perfect in regard of parts (as a child is a perfect man) 1 These. 5.23.
Sanctified in soul, and body, and spirit, and in regard of their aims and
intendments, but not as to degrees of Grace. Sin and Grace in this life are
together in the same subject, as Esau and Jacob in the same womb. As for the
name of Priests, which throughout you give me, and other Ministers of Christ, I
count it no disparagement (however you intend it) seeing Christ is called by
the Holy Ghost, the High Priest of our Profession, Heb. 3 1.

[The answer of G.W to Eccles. 7.20. is no other than what M. Fish r gave,
which is v^ry absurd, and not worthy any further reply, see Qu^k ^s Folly, p.
13.


T.D. We (the Saints) are one body with them in Heaven, and have the same title
with th m in possession, p 14, 38.


G.W. Ans This confutes his former words, for they that are one body with them
in Heaven, are members of the Body of Christ which is perfect, and its members
c^m^leat, ^ol 2.10 Ephesians. 3 15


T D. Reply. The Body of Christ is not yet perfect, for the e are great numbers
of elect belonging to it, yet u bo n. Christ gives a commission to preach, and
a promise of b^^ssing to the Apostles, and their successors, M^t 28.19 20. And
the Apostle says, that Pastors and Teachers are for the edifying of the Body
of Christ, till we all come in the unity of the Faith, etc. Ephesians. 3 12, 13. Put
both places together, and they inform us that Christ's Body is not built up ( i.
e. all the Elect not converted, and so not actual members of Christ's body, for
such men are by Faith) till the end of the world. As for Col. 2.10. it is plain
enough that the Apostle calls the Saints complete, in reference to the Doctrine
of Christ, which showed them all things necessary to salvation, so that they
needed not the addition, which natural reason, humane tradition, or Judaical
ceremonies could make. As for circumcision, we find expressly that it was urged
as necessary to salvation, Acts 15 1. This the Apostle denies. They are also
said to be complete in Christ, in respect of Ordinances, and outward
privileges, as particularly of Baptism, which rendered ci^cumcision useless,
because it signified the same thing which circumcision did, in a more large and
emphatical manner, v. 11, 12. As for Ephesians. 3.15. There Is nothing in that v. to
his purpose, but I suppose he means v. 19 That ye might be filled with all the
fullness of God. Fullness of God intends not equality, but quality, a divine and
spiritual fullness. And the Apostle prays that they might be filled with it
all (and so they should be in Heaven) but he asserts not that either they were,
or should be filled in this life.


QUESTION 3. Concerning Justification.
T.D. Whereas S. Fish ^ spoke of our good work being a m^^ to ^ou cause of our
justification, this P^iest has M^^l^ much ado to p ove that S. F. (...) a rank
Papist, and ^^i^h our good works are but imperfectly good, and Isa 64.6. All
our righteousn^ss^s are as filthy rags


G. A^s. S. F. never affirme^ that imperfect works and the righteousness which
is as il hy rags do dese^ve Just^fication, as this P^^ has w^^nged him, but
good works which are the fulfilling of th ^aw


T.D. Reply. Whether I have w^^nged S. F I leave to the Readers judgment, that
shall peruse Qu^kers Folly, p. 14, ^5. I urged against him, ^^r though our evil
works did cond^mn, yet ou^ g^^d work^ could not justify; because none of ou^
good wor^^ ^n this life are perfect, and so not the fulfi l^ng of the Law, as
evil works are the violation or breaking of the Law. And to prove the
imp^rfection of our righteousness. I brought Isa. 64 6. To which G.W. has
nor, nor indeed can ans^er. It Is an express place, The Chu ch c^^par^s all her
righteousnesses to the garments of a person legally unclean, which by the Law
were unclean, and to be washed, because his body had touched them.


T.D. has confessed, p. 15. that ^ood works which are the fulfilling of the
Law, deserve salvation, and that the desert of obedience arises from the
dignity of the Subject, by which it is performed.


G.W. Ans. So then this makes for what S.F. declared, for here it appears then
that obedience to God is deserving.


T.D. Reply. I did not directly affirm that good works which are the fulfilling
of the Law deserve salvation, but that from the rule of contraries (which Mr.
Fisher urged) we might so argue. For upon supposition that any mere man could
fulfill the Law, yet he could not be justifi^d, unless he had undergone the
penalty of his former disobedience, and so made reparations to the Justice of
God for damages sustained. And again, though I asserted the desert of obedience
from the dignity of the Subject, yet withal I affirmed that the Subject must be
an infinite person, and one from whom no obedience is due, Quakers Folly, p. 15.


T D. gives the explication of 1 Cor. 6.11. Where by the Spirit of our God, is
interpreted of the Spirits application, i^ referring to Just fication, or else
it may relate to Sanctification, spoken of in the former clause.


G.W. Ans. He would divide the Spirit of God, from the Name of Jesus; when as
his Name and Spirit are one. And where does he prove that justified by the
Spirit, (which he ignorantly calls the third Person in the Trinity) is not the
work of Grace? Here he would divide the Grace of God from the Spirit, for the
Saints were just^fied freely by his Grace, which was one with the Spirit.


T. D Reply. Though Jesus and the Spirit are one God, yet they have distinct
operat^ons, or manner of working about our Justification. It Is Jesus alone, and
not the Spirit (nor the Father) who merits and makes satisfaction for our sins.
The Spirit gives Faith to lay hold on Christ for Justification, and seals the
souls interest when obtained. I have proved that we are not justified by the
work of Grace, or good works, in the discourse upon Justification, Quakers
Folly, p. 15. etc. And so that the work of Grace cannot be meant in that place
(if by Spirit must be meant the meritorious cause of Justification, as you
assert) I do not divide the Grace of God from the Spirit. But I affirm, that
the G ^ce wrought in us by the Spirit is no meritorious cause o^ Justification.
As for that passage, justified fre^ly by his Grace, which is in Romans 3.24. It
intends not grace (...) us, but the grace or favor of God in giving Christ for
our propitiation, v. 25. As for your accusation of ignoran^e, I value it not,
but look upon it as a justifiable ground (...) account you a blasphemer, for
it is an implicit denying of what I expressly affirmed, (viz) Persons in the
Godhead.


T. D. p. 16. The Apostle asserts ^he holiness of man's nature as a work of the
Spirit confo^ming it to the Law, to be the meritorious cause of our f^e^dom
from sin.


G.W. Ans. And yet he has d^al d good works of obedience to be a deserving
cause o^ justification. What is not justification a freedom from in? Acts
13.39. And where does he prove the holiness o^ man's nature is a merito^ious
cause of our freedom from sin?


T D. R ply I see G. W. thou art so far from perfect, that thou want moral
honesty. Thou should have added, what I did in the same period, to make up my
sense? but mark withal, it is not that [holinesse of man's nature] which is in
us, but in Christ. And then thou might have answered thy own Questions. The
righteousness of Christ's humane nature or active obedience, as we usu^lly call
it, in opposition to passive, is asserted to be the cause of our freedom from
sin and death, Romans 8.2. But not righteousness inherent in the same nature, as
it subsists in our persons. As for Acts 13.39. I find nothing to the purpose;
it asserts not your Popish Doctrine, that justification is sanctification, or
that the righteousness whereby we are justified, is infused or inherent. The
words are, And by him all that beli^ve are justified from all things, from
which ye could not be justified by the Law of Moses, And it proves that by
Faith men are freed from the guilt of all their sins. And what of that?


T. D. says, Romans 8.4, 5. It impo^ts the end for which God sent Christ, that
his righteousness might be imputed to us, as if it had been inherent in our
selves.


G. ^. Ans. If the Apostle had not meant the righteousness of the Law
fulfilled in their own persons, he would not have said, fulfilled in us,
neither would he have counted Christ's righteousness inherent in themselves, if
he had not counted it ^^ him, nor needed he to speak of the ^ighteousnesse of
the Law being ^o be fulfilled in Christ (as if it had not been fulfilled in him)


T. D. R^^ly. Bold man! Who art thou that teach the Apostle how to speak,
who can not speak sense thy self? (as appears by the middle clause of this
thy answer.) If thou did understand thy self, thou would say that the
Apostle would not account that righteousness in the Saints, which was not in
them. Nor indeed do^s the Apostle so mistake, but he asse^ts that the
righteousness of Christ redounds to their benefit, as if it had been their own
inherent righteousness As the principal is discharged from the debt, when the
surety paid it, though the cred^tor cannot, nor does say that the principal did
make payment. Nor does the Apostle speak of Christ's fulfill^ng the Law as i^
he had not done it, but he tells of what Christ ha^h already done, and to what
end, (viz) that we might have the benefit of it, as if it had been our personal
act.


T. D. Supposed S. F. to mean, when he acknowledged degrees among Believers,
that some of these (Bel^evers) have a mixture of sin with their Grace.


G.W. Ans. This is a false supposition, grace is pure, the mixture of sin is in
that which goes from the grace.


T.D. Reply. Reader, If thou do not judge this latter clause in the answer to
be unintelligible nonsense, thy judgment and mine must part her^. Mixture does
suppose at least two ingredients, but what that is which goes from grace to
mingle with sin, I cannot divine. He should mean, that when grace decreas^s,
corruption increases, and gathers strength. As for my words, they intended but
that sin and grace are in the same subject, or in each faculty of the soul, not
successively, but together, at the same time, which Paul expresses by anot^er
Law in his members, rebelling against the Law of his mind, Rom 7.23.

[Reader, G.W. quotes a passage, p. 18. l. 17. of my Book, wherein he says, I
wronged S. F. But I ref^r you to the place, where you may read it, and judge as
thou see cause.]


T. D. says, p. 19. Conscience in the Saints being but in part cleansed, as a
witness it te^tifies falsehood ^o them also.


G. W. Ans. This man lays falsehood and badness to the charge of the Saints
Consciences, ^he^eas they witn^ssed truth to them, Sanctification throughout, 1
These. 5.23. and holiness perfect^d in the fear of God


T. D. Reply. I do still affirm that no faculty in the Saints ^s sanctified
wholly, but only in part (And that place you bring, 1 These. 5.23. is a
distribution of the subjects of Grace, it intends not pe^fection of deg^^es in
each subject) And if no faculty, ^he^ no^ C^nscience, As for 2 Cor. 7 1. which
you f^^m ^o quo^^, y^^ w^ong that Scripture. The words are not (...) s^^
p^^f^cted, but perf^cting holiness And the Apostle ^o not suppos^ their
holiness to be perfected, but exho^^ them to end^avour after degrees of Grace,
nearer perfection, which he expresses by cleansing from all filthiness of
flesh and Spirit, in the former clause of the verse, which supposes that there
was filthiness remaining in both, and then in Conscience, for that is partly
intended under Spirit, See Quakers folly, p. 19.


T. D. says, p. 21. As Christ was made sin for us, so are we the righteousness
of God in him, but the former was by imputation, not inherence, and therefore
so the latter.


G.W. Ans. If our being made the righteousness of God in Christ be but like
Christ's being made si^ for us, then this Pr. might as well say, that we shall
have no righteousness in us at all, for Christ was made s^n for us, who knew no
sin.


T.D. Reply. There is not the same reason G.W. for saying the one, as for
saying the other. For 2 Cor. 5. ult. asserts such a proportion as I mentioned,
but no Scripture such a one as you vainly suppose. Yet this I say, that as
there was no necessity of inherent sin in Christ, in order to the imputation of
our sin to him, so nor of inherent righteousness in us, to the imputation of
his righteousness to us. But our Just^fication is as independent upon our
inherent righteousness, as if we had none. The Surety (though he never
contracted penny of the debt) is as much obliged to payment as the Princ^pal;
and the Principal is as truly discharged by the Su^ety s payment, though he pay
nothing out of his own estate.


T.D. said, do you think that the righteousness which the Apostle calls his own,
was not Christ's?


G.W. Ans. He might as well say, that the Apostle desired no^ to have Christ's
righteousness, which is but one.


T. D. Reply. The Apostle asks a question which implies an affirmation? Who
makes thee to differ from another? and what have thou that thou did not
receive? 1 Cor. 4.7. And it is as true of righteousness inherent, as of common
gifts, which are there spoke of. The righteousness of his personal conformity
to the Law Paul desired not to be found in, but in Christ's imputed to him. But
I have said enough, which G.W. takes no notice of, because he cannot reply to
it Quakers Folly, p. 21. ^2.

[Note Reader, that G.W. spends two Pages, 27, 28. of his Book, about my
explication of Col. 1.26. and the distinction I make between Christ personal
and myst^cal; for answer whereto, to save the trouble of repetition, I refer
you to Quakers Folly, p. 22, 23. Only whereas he replies to the distinction,
that Christ is but one, I say so too, yet the Name of Christ is applied
sometimes to the Head, and at other times to ^he Body. And they are though one
in respect of Union, yet of distinct consideration in the business of
salvation, Ephesians. 5.23. Christ the Head is the Savior, Christ the Body the
Saved.]

And whereas G.W. denies, that he said, we are justified by Sanctification, I
am confident that was his word, however, if it was righteousness within, it
comes all to one: It Is evident that the d^ift of his discourse was to maintain
that assertion.


QUESTION 4. Concerning the Scriptures.
T D THE Scriptures are the Word of God and the said R^le of Faith and life,
and that there is n^ oth^^ st^n^ing R^le b^t the Sc^^ptu^es.


G ^ Ans. What then was their Rule who spoke (...) the Sc^iptu^es? And what was
the Gentiles Rule? And what must be their R^le who cannot read the ^criptures?
M^st they be condemned, because they cannot read them? The Word o^ God is in
the hea^ts of Believ^rs, and of this Word the S^riptures are a true declara^^on
but a^t not the Word


T D. R^^ly I must ag^in refer the Reader for an answer to th^^ Qu^^ie^, to
Qu^kers Fo^^y, p. 29, 30, 43, 44. And (...) matter c^n^a^ned ^n the Scriptures
is a Rule to (...) (so for as it is revealed to them) and was (...) ^^^re it wa^
put into w^iting. And so much of it as (...) upon the hearts of Heathens, is a
rule to th^^ R^m 2.12 And since they a^e in a body presented (...), the whol^
o^ him are our Rule. And for those who c^nnot r^a^, though they shall not be
condemned for a ^^^ur^l ^ncapacity, yet they shall for not walk ng acc^rding to
the Scriptures, as they a^^ain the knowl^^ge of them by some other way a^
hea^^ng, etc. To that Not on, tha^ the Sc^ p^ures are but a true d^claration of
the Wo^d of ^od ^n the h^a^ts of Beli^vers. I rep^y, that the ^^^p u^^s are
al^o a d^claration of what ought to (...) the hea^^s of Bel^ev^^s, and
unbe^^evers. If you m^^^ (a^ most of you do) that they are only a declaration
of their conditions who spoke them, read, 1 Pet. 1.10, 12. and that place alone
will confute you.


T D. John 20.30, 31. Suppose we had the signs faithfully r^co^ded, yet were
they not our Rule, because God did not g^ve order for them, but ha^h assured us
as much as is ^uffic^ent to create and preserve Faith in the Gospel which we
have.


G ^. Ans. Faith is the gift of God, not created and preserved by the
Sc^iptures, but by Christ the author of Faith And again, this Priest in
affirming no other Rule, but what we have in Scr^pture, has contradicted
himself, p 44 he says, that those things that were not written, migh have ^een
useful, if they had been written, for they were done for the very same end,
with those (signs) which are l^ft us. So then many things that are not written,
might have been as useful, as that which is written in the Sc^^ptures.


T. D. Reply. I see thou art a man of depth, G.W. to make an opp^sition where
there is ^ subordination, between the efficient and instrumenta^ cause. The
second creation does not exclude (though the first did) instruments or second
causes, James 1.18. Of his own will begat he us with the (...) of Truth. Romans
10.17. Faith comes ^y hear^ng, and hear^ng by the ^o^d of God. Which Word is
the repo^t o^ the Gospel. v. 16. I am not sensible of any contradiction in the
passages G^^ quotes. Q. Folly, p. 26. I told Mr. F sher, Sermons have the same
common end with the Scriptures, yet they are not a Rule any furth^r than they
ag^ee with the Scriptures, And hence the Bere^^s are commanded for ^xam^ning
Paul's sermons, by the Sc^iptures, Acts 17.11. Yet God blesses them so far as
that the Word preached is the usua^ means of conversion, whereas the written
Scriptures ar^ more rarely such. You add, as useful, which I did not affirm,
for that which was delivered to us by Divine Authority, has Gods promise of
blessing, that it shall be instrumental to beget a Divine Faith, John 20.21.
These [signs] are written that ye might believe, etc. But from such signs as
are handed by humane autho^ity only an humane Faith may be expected, which is
useful in its kind to prevent or take off prejudice against what is of Divine
Authority, which the carnal reason of man is apt to cavil at^ ^f you say (as
you seem to do) tha^ if all the signs were done for the same end, then being
written they must reach the same end. I deny the cons^quence, for the
difference lies in Gods arbitrary dispensation. H^ w^ought them all for the end
mentioned, but has thought fit to transmit only some s^w by writing to
po^^erity, and they shall be in stead of all the rest.


[G.W. cavils at my denial o^ their infallibility, which I judge answered
suffic^ently, Qu Folly, p. 39. l. 20.]


T. D. As for our want of infallibllity, it is no valid plea against our
Ministry, p. 33. and the Spirit of God may accompany a Ministry, and the
Minister not have the Spirit. See for proof, Acts 20 30. Mat. 23.23.


G.W. A^s. They that want infallibility are out of the Truth. The Scribes and
Pharisees that spoke perverse things against the Ap^stles, the Spirit did not
then accompany what they m nistr^d.


T. D. R ply. Why do you not reply to Acts 20.30. Which proves clearly that the
Gosp^l-Ministers are not infallible? As also 1 These. 5.19, 20, 21. Which I
improved, Q. Folly. p. 33. we may m^s^^ke in some things, yet ordinarily we
preach infallible Truths. Hence the Church is called the Pillar and Ground of
Truth, 1 Timothy 3.15. Pillar, non se^su a^c^i^^ctonico, sed forensi; as upon the
Exchange in London, are Pillars upon which hang Tables of Proclamations. And
Ground, (...), Seat of Truth, or place of its residence, and the gates of Hell
shall no more prevail against the publication, than the profession and practice
of infall^ble Truths in the Church universal, though they may against
particular Ministers and Churches, by damnable Heresies (such as yours, G.W.)
And as for your instance of the Scribes and Pharise ^s. I answer, that though
the Spirit did not ^ccompany their Ministry, when they spoke against Chr^^t yet
h^ d d accompany it, when they taught the people to ^b e^v^ such things as
Christ enjoyn^d And this they d^d o^^^ntimes, as I showed, Mat. 23.3. What they
hi^ you observe, that observe, and do. Christ did then approve of their
Doctrine in those things wherein he would have it practiced. And if so, then
the Spirit was in their Minist y, and yet he was not in themselves, for they
sa^^, and did not, (i. e. practiced not their own Doctrine.)

[Reader, note that G.W. having answered after his fashion some o the a^guments
in ^he Dispu^e, he pretends also to reply to s^veral things, which I wrote
against R.H. but G. Whith^^^s replies are so ^ j^ne, that I need but desire you
to compare them (if you judge them worth your reading, for I shall not stand to
transcribe them) with the places in my Book, to which I shall refer you, and I
dare stand to your judgment.

[ G.W. p. 34. T. D. p. 35. G.W p. 35. T. D p. 36, 37. G.W p. 37. T. D. p. 40,
41. G W. p. 40. T.D. p. 44.]

Only four passages I shall bri^fly reply to.


T. D. The righteousness which God works in us, is but finite, as well as other
effects, p. 39


G.W. Ans. And yet this Pr p. 37. has owned that the righteousness wh^reof
Christ is the subject, and that whereof he is the efficient are of one p^cies
or kind; then I say, the righteou^ness which God e^f^cts in us, is not finite,
but infinite, for Christ is Gods righteousness, and Christ is formed in us.


T.D. Reply. A pitiful cavil! The righteousness in Christ which I asserted to
be of the same kind with that in us, must be understood of the righteousness of
Christ's humane Nature, John 1.16. and of his fullness have we received Grace
for Grace, (viz.) As the essential and integral parts of the child answer to
the Parents, or as the Paper receives the impression of the stamp. Christ
indeed is Gods righteousn^ss, in respect of Gods donation and acceptance of him
for man's righteousness, 1 Cor. 1.30. Who (Christ) of God is mad^ unto us
righteousness. But the righteousness of the Divine Nature or Godhead is not our
Justification. No, but the righteousness of Christ's Humane Nature, as it
receives an infinite value from the Divine Nature, to which the Humane is
united in one person.


T D said, the Spirit was not wont to be effectual without the Letter of the
Word, and gave instance, Romans 10.17.


G.W. Ans. He might as well have said, the Apostles Ministry wa^ not wont to be
effectual, for P^ul was not a Min^ster of the Letter (or writing) but of the
Spirit, or thing declared of. 2 Cor. 3.6. Romans 10.17. is against his principle,
for there is a difference between the Word and the Letter, for the Word abides
for ever. 1 Pet. 1.23. So does not the Letter. How would Pr. convince Heathens
of Christ, i^ the Spirit be not effectual without the Letter*


T. D. Rep^y. I had thought Paul had been a Minister of the Letter, (if you
mean the writing) for did not he minister (as you phrase it) many Epistles to
the Churches, and command the Letter to be read, Col. 4.16. 2 Cor. 3.7. intends
that Paul did not only show them their duty, and the happin^ss to be had in
Christ, but his Ministry was a means of conveying strength to do it, and
putting them into an happy estate. Your d stinction between Word and L^tter is
frivolous, the Letter abides for ever in the s^n^e there intended, ^^z. in the
impressions of it upon the hearts of the regenerate, v. 2, 3. It Is not true of
the new creature, that he is bo^n to die. To your fond Question, I answer, The
Apo^tle makes preaching ordinarily necessary to the conversion of Heathens,
Romans 10.14. How shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard?
Preaching, without the Spirits efficacy, brings but the Letter of the Word, yet
it is as necessary by Gods ordination, as plowing, with the influence of the
Heavens, to make the earth bring forth.


T. D. The Gospel gives life upon imperfect obedience.


G.W. Ans. And yet before he denied our good works to be a deserving cause of
justification, when now it is so far deserving, that the Gospel gives li^e upon
it.


T. D. Reply. Fair and softly goes a great way in a day, G W. you make too much
have to have good speed, to find out a contradiction where there is none. I did
not say that imperfect obedience deserves life, though I did, that the Gospel
gives life upon it. Thus your Catholic Brethren, when J mes says, This man
shall be blessed in his de^d, Jam. 1.25. cry out, here is a clear place to
prove, that we are blessed for our d^eds, but alas, they ma^k not the wariness
of the Scripture phrase, which is not for, but in his deed. Our deeds may be
Arg^ments or Evidences of our blessed state, but no deserv ng cause. And had
thou had any ingenuity, thou woul^st have taken in the who^^ period, which was
necessary to understand my meaning, which was thus, Thoug^ the Law gives not
life without perfect obedience, the G^sp^l gives it upon imperfect obedience,
i. e. Thou^h the L^w exac^s per^ect personal obedience to Justification, (...)
the Gosp^l does not, but by believing we obtain int^^^st in Christ's
righteousness for that end.


T. D. David was not free from the b^ing o^ sin in this life, but a sad
instance of the power of it in real Saints, and yet he is made a pattern to
New-Testament-Saints, Zach. 12.8. p. 48.


G.W. Ans That Scripture proves his Doctrine false, for the words are, He that
is f^e^^le among them shall be as David, and the House o^ Dav^d shall be as
God, as the ^ngel of the Lord before them. So that David and the
New-T^stament-Saints were free from sin, for in God is no sin


T. D. Reply* The words are intended in the Letter, of the H^^o^ch Fort^tude
and S^rength which the people should have in ^he t^me of danger, like to
David's. And of ^e ^ngelik^ and Divine pitch of both, which the Ruler^
(intend^d by the House of David, which was the Royal Fam^^y) should be rais^d
to through Faith in Christ. And so they give us two sizes of strength and
for^^tude, and not one only (as G^^ interpre^s them.) Some shall be as David,
and others as God. Now look as Omnipotency is not Literally promis^d to David's
House, but by an ^x^^sse of spe^ch, or Hyp^^bole, a greater measure of strength
than others against bodily enemies, so nor can we understand it (sp^ritua^ly)
b^t of a greater measure of spiritual strength against ^p^^itu^l enemies.

To conclude this discourse, I shall not refuse to imitate an adversary (though
I shall be more ingenuous than to wrong him as he has done me) but shall
b^i^fly sum up his principles, and assertions, with the place in his Book,
where they are to be found.

The Spirit was eff ctual among the Gentiles, who had not the Letter of the
Word, p. 39.

The works of God which true Believers witness, are perfect, p. 18.

He (meaning my self) would have the Believers like the P^^ests who sin in the
best of their performances (as they conf sse) p. 18.

That our good works are the meritorious or deserving cause of our
Justification, p. 19.

G. W. finds fault with me for holding that the Scriptures are the Word of God,
and the only standing Rule of Faith, and life, p. 29.

Those Teachers that want infallib^lity, are out of the Truth, p. 33.

G. W. calls it Ignorance in me, to call the Spirit the third Person in the
Trinity, p. 22.


FINIS.
A NARRATIVE.
Reader,
MY Rejoinder to G.W. having been finished a good while since (as the date of
the Epistle will inform thee) and the Bookseller having thought fit to delay
the publication, after it was off the Press, (upon a consideration not
necessary to be mentioned) I have been persuaded by some worthy Friends to
annex a Narrative, the materials whereof lay by me; and are of undoubted
credit. To most of them thou shall have the Witnesses names (persons of much
integrity) and where they are wanting in the rest (the Witnesses not judging it
advisable in some respects to be publicly named) I shall be accountable to any
man that desires it for a punctual proof. Thou can not be so much a stranger
in England, as not to know how frequently the Quakers decry the present
Ministry, with their Doctrine and Worship, under the Notion of Antichristian.
But how little reason have they so to do? considering how much themselves do
symbolize with Antichrist, particularly in that grand Doctrine of Justification
by works, which as they hold in the Principle, they reduce it to Practice.
Witness. Mr. Davis Min. of Dover.
For one of them lately at Dover, when he came to die, upon the question put to
him, made answer, that he expected salvation only by his own works, and not by
Christ. And dying men may usually be presumed to speak their hearts. And I am
out of doubt that they are acted by the antichristian Faction. A Gentleman of
good credit assured me that he met with an English Jesuit in London, the first
Lords day in June last; one who was bred in Cambridge, and had been formerly of
his acquaintance, who after some shynesse to be known, at length confessed that
he came over to propagate the Romish Faith, and told him, that there was a good
honest people called Quakers, whom we jeered at, that did their work at the
second hand; and he boasted much of the numbers that turned Catholics
immediately, or medily, by becoming Quakers. And another Gentleman that came
this Spring from St. Omars, did avouch that he saw the Jesuits there, about
four a Clock every evening throw off their Gowns, and put on aprons, and betake
themselves to the exercise of Handy-craft callings; some played the Shoomakers,
others sat at the Loom, others killed and dressed sheep, and they did not
stick to boast, that under the disguise of such callings (working as
Journeymen, and changing place as they listed) they served the Romish Church.
And the Head of the College told him, that England never was in so fair a way
of return to the Romish See, since it broke off, as now. And what hopes the
Papists can have, unless from the increase of Quakers, I leave Reader to thy
determination. And the truth is, the Quakers now d^clare their intentions to
propagate their persuasions by the sword, whereas they were w^nt to pretend to
so much meekness and peaceablenesse* that they would bear neither staff nor
sword. At ^^^t Meeting of the Quake^s, in Hurst-Peir-point in Sussex, he that
undertook to be the Speaker, called out to the Min^ of the Parish (who then
accidentally passed by) saying, We will have you all down, for now our day is
come* and another Quaker in the Parish of Nuthurst in the same County, did say
to a Godly person of good quality in that Parish, that he no more cared to kill
one of the Priests, (as he styled the Ministers) then he would to kill a dog.
And another Quaker waylaid the Minister of Covewold, (a very worthy and
reverend man* at his return from a Fast) and justled him upon the high way, (as
he kept it; having his Wife behind him) and drew out a sword, which he had by
his side, about half way, which was a shrewd presumption that he intended the
Minister mischief; but that some Neighbors that came from the Fast, coming up
to them, prevented it. And they do usually give out threatening speechs against
the Ministry, and their Friends. Mr. Wingfield.
One Instance you may take, as it was formally attested to me, under the hand
of a Godly minister of a Town within one mile of Sandwich.

I do testify that Luke Howard of Dover Quaker, did say in my hearing on the
25 day of July 1659. upon the rode, near Dover Castle, that it was revealed to
him by the eternal God that the Priests shall be destroyed, and by the people
who are called Quakers. In testimony whereof, I set my hand, Aug. 3. 1659.
Will. Wingfield. Min. at Word.


And in a late Pamphlet, called a Word of advice to the Soldiers, by E.B.
Quaker, p. 2. (he speaking to the Soldiers, of the Ministers) uses this
passage, Oh give the Priests blood to drink, for they are worthy. I my self
read the whole Book through, and can therefore attest it upon personal
knowledge.

And what affronts these wretches offer to the Worship of God, is notoriously
known: On the Lords day (being the 18 of Sept. 1659.) one Will. Naylor Brother
to James Naylor, (a Quaker) came into the Savoy Church, when Mr. Hook was in
the Pulpit preaching, and made such a bellowing noise, that it seemed to be
rather the Devil speaking within him, than his own natural voice; insomuch that
the Minister was necessitated for a time to hold his peace; and many of the
people were sadly affrighted at the dreadfulnesse of the noise, that some ran
one way, some another, to secure themselves from the danger which they
apprehended was near them. This is testified by credible Witnesses, as Mr. and
Mrs. Hook, and diverse others.

And at Aldermanbury, on a Lords day, June 12, 1659. whilst the Psalm was
singing, a Quaker gat up into the Pulpit, with his Hat on his head, and setting
his Breech upon the Cushion, fell to sewing. Anoth^r example as remarkable as
the former, was in Christ-Church, October. 6, 1659. It being a Day of public
Thanksgiving, the Parl. L. Major, Aldermen, Com. Coun. and Officers of ^he
army, being there met together, to hear Dr. Homes and Mr. Caryl, who were
appointed by the Parl. to preach before them. Mr. Caryl being the last that
preached, it so fell out, that when he was in his last Prayer, there were two
Quakers made a very great disturbance in the public assembly, in the very
presence of authority: This will be testified by many Witnesses that were
present. And they seem to regard their own Worship as little as they do ours.
For March 6 1659, one Mary Todd of Southwark, Quaker, at the Bull and Mouth in
Aldersgate Street, an usual Meeting place, whilst her Friends (as they call one
another) were speaking, pulled up all her clothes above her middle, Mr. Tho.
Cress^t, Surgeon.
exposing her nakedness to the view of all that were in the Room, and walked
so up and down a while, using several expressions about her practice, as
suitable to a state of innocence and perfection: This I had from an eye and
ear-witnesse who is named in the Margin: and what a beastly and abominable
practice this was; especially in a woman, besides the unseasonablenesse of it,
being in the time of their Worship, (such as it is) I leave to thee to judge.
And whereas it is an usual thing for the Quakers to call Ministers of the Gospel
Liars, it is well enough known, that besides the Lies of their Doctrine, they
have not so much moral honesty, as to speak Truth in matters of Fact.

In May last, there having been some discourse one day between one Howard of
Dover Quaker, Mr. Russel, Min. in the Marsh.
and a Minister in Rumney Marsh, the next day was appointed for further
discourse between them two, but overnight the said Howard sent his horse and
man for Mr. Fisher (sometime a Minister, now a Quaker, and suspected to be a
Jesuit.) and going with him to the place of meeting, told the people, that
seeing S. Fisher came accidentally thither, he would now leave the discourse to
him; whereupon one among the people stepped out, and told Howard that he lied,
for he did see his horse and man go out overnight, and see the said Fisher
ride into the Town on the morning upon the same horse, by which it was manifest
that he sent for him on purpose. All that they could say in justification of
themselves, was, that the said Fisher came accidentally in respect of the
people or Minister who was to discourse, they knowing nothing of his coming. To
conclude, I desire thee Reader, to peruse the Quakers answer to certain
questions proposed to them, hereto annexed, wherein thou will find them denying
the Scriptures to be the Rule for judging matters of Faith; asserting that they
should have had knowledge of God sufficient to salvation, if they had never
heard of the Bible; and their words and writings are as infallible as the
Scriptures; and again, denying the Persons in the Godhead, the Humane, Nature
of Christ, and that Christ is a distinct Person from the Saints, and that there
has been a true Church since the Apostles, till now, and that one day is more
holy than another. And surely by these Principles in conjunction with the rest
which thou have an account of in the Book it self, to which this Narrative is
annexed, the Quakers have for ever forfeited the name of Christians, and are to
be reputed Heathens.

Sandwich, October. 10 1659.
Questions proposed to, and answered by Joseph Fuce, Quaker.
Quest Whether the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testament be the Rule of
trying and judging all matters of Faith and obedience toward God?

Answ. And now I shall set down these Proofs to prove the Scriptures are not to
be the Rule for to try and judge all things or matters of Faith, John 5.22 etc.

Q. Whether the Light within, you so much speak of, be suffici^nt to guide you
to Salvation, if you had never heard of the Bible?

Ans. I do believe if I had never seen the Bible, yet believing the Witness
which God has given, which is Christ, the Light and hope and Glory in us,
which we so much speak of, and preach freely as we have received, to the
offending of those deceivers that preach for hire, and so make merchandise of
the people, I say, I should have attained to the knowledge of God, if I had
never heard of the Bible.

Q Whether the teachings or writings of any of your way be infallible or of
equal authority with the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament?

Ans. I say, we do not err in speaking or writing the Truth as it is in Jesus,
and that of God in all Consciences shall one day witness this to be true and
infallible: and the Scriptures and our writings has and will most certainly
come to pass.

Q. Whether the Father, the Word, and the Spirit be three distinct Persons in
the self-same Godhead?

Ans. As for thy words, three distinct Persons, that I deny, till thou provest
them by plain Scripture. It is like the Bishops in Rome may own thee in them,
for that is some of their unfruitful works of darkness.

Qu. Whether Jesus Christ has a Divine and Humane Nature in one person?

Ans. Thy words, Humane Nature, I return them with those words, Three Persons,
into the Pit of confusion, from whence they came.

Qu. Whether Jesus Christ remains for ever a distinct Person from all the
Saints?

Ans. But as for being a distinct Person from all the Saints, he is not.

Qu. Whether the true Church has failed upon earth since the death of the
Apostles of Jesus Christ, mntil these times? if not, in what age or ages, or
among what people has it continued?

Ans. He caused all both small and great, rich and poor, bond and free, to
receive a mark in their forheads, or in their right hand. Read, Rev. 13. And
thus the true Church ceased or failed upon earth, since the death of the
Apostles of Christ, until ^he raising up of Gods own seed out of the earth, to
stand a witness against wicked murderers, and Persecutors of the Saints, and
true Church of Christ.

Qu. Whether the first day of the Week be more holy than any other day of the
Week.

Ans. All the days of the Week as the Lord created them, are holy unto the
Saints, who are redeemed from observing days and months, and times, and years.

These things are expressly asserted and subscribed by

Joseph Fuce.
