WHereas the Counties of Norffolk, Suffolk, Essex, and the other Associated
Counties, out of their loyal respect to his Majesty, their pious disposition
to the peace and happiness of this Kingdom, in obedience to the orders of
Parliament, have raised and maintained, to the number of foureteen thousand
Horse, Foot, and Dragoons, or thereabouts, And with them, within five months

Forces, and in keeping several Garrisons, making and erecting of
Fortifications, Magazines, courts of Guard, and other things requisite and
necessary, for the defense and safety of the said Association, against the
Incursions of the Enemy. By all which means, the said Association is become
much indebted, and without the speedy raising of large and considerable sums
of Money, proportionable to their bast expenses, cannot long subsist in a

several weekly sums of Money, hereafter in this Ordinance mentioned, shall

hundred seventy five pounds, upon the County of Norffolke, and City of Norwich,
the weekly sum of one thousand eight hundred seventy five pounds, upon the
County of Hartford, the weekly sum of six hundred seventy five pounds, upon
the County of Cambridge, the weekly sum of five hundred sixty two pounds ten
shillings, upon the County of Huntington, the weekly sum of three hundred
and thirty pounds, upon the County of Lincoln, and City of Lincoln, the
weekly sum of one thousand two hundred eighteen pounds fifteen shillings,
and upon the Isle of Ely, the weekly sum of two hundred twenty one pounds
five shillings, And the said weekly payments are to begin from the first day
of January instant; and so to continue weekly for four months next ensuing
from the said first day of January.

And be it further Ordained, That every person or persons that were to be
Assessed or Taxed, by any former Ordinance of Parliament, shall be Assessed and
Taxed by this Ordinance, and shall be liable to as great Forfeitures and
