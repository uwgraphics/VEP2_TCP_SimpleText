E. M. A long imprisoned Malignant, HIS HUMBLE SVBMISSION TO THE COVENANT and
DIRECTORY: With some Reasons and Grounds of use to settle and satifie tender
Consciences. PRESENTED IN A Petition to the Right Honorable the LORDS
assembled in Parliament, in Whitsun-week, in the Year, 1647.

Eurip. (...).

Printed in the Year, 1647.

To the Right Honorable the Lords assembled in the high Court of Parliament,
The humble Petition of E. M. Prisoner in the Right Honorable the Lord Peter's
House in Aldersgate Street.
Shows,
THat whereas your Lordships humble Petitioner (upon Remonstrance of his case,
that he has been these five years Prisoner to this Honorable House, in which
time having suffered the often Plunder of his goods, to the very clothes on his
back, and Sequestration from any benefit of livelihood or maintenance, and
being unmarried, is thereby excluded from plea to so much as any fifth part)
did thereupon prefer his humble Petition, that your Lordships would be pleased,
either to allow him some necessary sustenance out of his own Estate, or such
liberty (upon Bail to appear before this Honorable House upon any term to
be limited by your Lordships) whereby he might be enabled to seek, and find
some end of his extreme misery, either by some poor honest life, or death:
In answer to which Petition, your Lordships were pleased to return, that for
maintenance out of his own Estate, it was not in your Honorable power to
allow it; and for liberty upon Bail, your Lordships were ready to grant it,
but only upon condition of his taking the Covenant beforehand.

Hereupon your Lordships humble Petitioner makes request, first of all that he
may present to your Honorable Remembrance, that there was a Convocation of
this Church representative summoned, and called by the same Authority, together
with this present Parliament now sitting, and that the Members of that
Convocation (by the Statute of 8. Hen. 6.) are to enjoy the same immunities (as
touching their Persons and personal Attendants) from imprisonment, that any
Peers in the House of Lords, or Members of the House of Commons (for
themselves and theirs) do challenge to that effect: May it then please your
Lordships to give your humble Petitioner leave to present to your honorable
Notice, that himself is actually at this time a Member of that Convocation;
howsoever he shall not insist any further upon this, then your Lordships
please, but submits both this, and the law, and Statute it self to your
honorable arbitrament and pleasures, how far it is to be regarded or
superseded; and craves only leave of your Lordships, that he may without
offense express his sense and mind in certain considerations upon the sole
condition whereon his liberty and livelihood at this present depends.

1. First, he finds this Covenant (for many intrinsecall inordinations in the
same, which by diverse learned men have been worthily and weightily pressed, and
may further be amplified and noted, as your Petitioner is ready to declare,
whenever by your Honors he shall be thereunto required) so opposite to his
Religion, Faith, and all his duties to God and man, that daily he does humbly
beseech Almighty God to strengthen him with grace, that he may endure and
embrace any extremity of torture, or death, rather then in any sense of his own
or others, take, or seem to have taken that, which for ought he can any ways
inform himself (and other means of information in this long and strict
durance he can have none) must needs run him into a desperate hazard of all
the good he can hope for in this or any other world.

2 Next, he desires to present to your honorable considerations, that those
Recusants in this Kingdom, who profess themselves of the Communion of the
Church of Rome, are very seldom (if at all) pressed or urged by any House or
Committee (to their great commendation be it ever mentioned) to that Covenant;
upon supposition, that they are so far honest and true to their own souls
and consciences, that they will never swear that which is inconsistible with
their Faith. May it then please your Lordships to consider, that the Church of
England, as it stood established by divine and humane Laws, and still stands
(to all those men upon whose consciences Laws have any obligation) wherein
your humble Petitioner was made a Member of Christ, and has received such
sensible impressions of Gods grace, as obliges him to perseverance therein
against all the temptations of the World, the Flesh, or the Devil. May it
please your Honors to consider, and assuredly to beleve, that this our Church
of Christ may by Gods Grace breed and nourish men every whit as honest and true
to their souls and consciences, and as constant to their Faith and Principles,
as your Lordships conceive the Church of Rome does, (where notwithstanding
Dispensations and mental Reservations, we are sure we may say without offense
to any man, are more impetrable and allowable then with us;) And therefore may
it please your Lordships to vouchsafe that Christian men of this our Church
(wherein your very Lordships have held and professed Communion) may find so
much credit and countenance from your Honors, as those of the Church of Rome
daily do; and may be thought possibly so far true and fast to their
Principles and Faith, that they cannot admit their souls into a Sacrament and
Covenant, wholly destructive to their Religion, and indeed more individually
and immediately penned, meant, and intended by the Authors of it against their
Church, Doctrine and Government, then against the Church of Rome; there being
no mention therein of any singular thing proper to the Church of Rome, but
either common to us with them, or proper to us alone.

3. May it likewise please your Honors to consider, that all our late
Parliaments in England (and, most of all, this wherein your Honors are now
sitting) have professed always great severity, and made strict inquisition
against all men that should intend, practice, or endeavor by word, or writing,
any alteration of Religion, or Innovation in Doctrine or Worship, as a capital
offense: (and indeed what fantasy can be more derogatory and contrary to all
Christian Religion, then that men should be of any Religion that in these last
days is to be set up?) wherefore when your Petitioner daily sees and considers
men that endeavor, profess, Print, and practice Innovations and Alterations
in the Church, Doctrine, Worship, and Government, in the very Creed, in the 39.
Articles of our Confession, in all the Ecclesiastical Canons, Muniments,
Ceremonies, Sacraments, and in the whole substance of Religion, the Public
Service of God, and Liturgy of the Church, sealed in the blood of so many
Martyrs, and settled by the sanction of so many Parliaments: And when he sees
such men go about every where, not only with indemnity, and without question,
but also rewarded with Preferments, Immunities, Privileges, for their
Apostacy from that Faith which they have so often subscribed, preached,
practiced, and whereunto before God, Angels, and men, they have plighted their
troth: When he sees again men constant to their Religion, and to their
Foundation, persecuted and brought to naught (himself especially) not only
with total and final Sequestration, but also with a destiny of perpetual
Imprisonment, without all necessaries, even to famine, unles he will for swear
and renounce that his Religion (to which if he were not by his own
inclination, education, breeding (but chiefly by the fear of God) obliged, yet
the severe proceedings of all Parliaments (this especially) against the
introducers of Innovations in Religion, were sufficient to keep him, and awe
him, or any man else to his Rule and Conformity: When he sees such a time of
Jubilee and Indulgence on the one side, and when he beholds such a time of hot
persecution on the other side: he cannot entertain a more honorable opinion
of your Lordships, then to conceive, that your Lordships in a zealous prudence
(as Jehu once served Baals Prophets) have a desire to sift and winnow this
populous Kingdom, and by such a seeming distribution of rewards and
punishments, do intend only to find out, and to root out all those worshippers
of Baal, those false, hypocritical, adulterate pretenders to a Religion, who
manifestly give sentence upon themselves, that either they have all this while
formerly (notwithstanding all their subscriptions, Oaths and Professions)
lived, and gone in a wrong way, or else that they will now swear themselves
into a wrong way for their advantage: Neither can your Petitioner any ways
believe, that it can possibly be your Lordships will, and Honorable pleasure,
that either he or any constant Christian (who cannot but abhominate such
hypocrisy, false dealing, and Merchandise in Religion) should by perjury seem
to be what he is not.

4. Besides, may it please your Lordships, to give your Petitioner leave to
mention that too, which your Honors know and understand best of all; that
there is a great deal of difference between Christian and Pagan Allegiance:
Pagan Allegiance is a virtue actuated out of the habit of prudence and Moral
goodness, acceptable to God, and most commonly rewarded with the temporal
goods only, and benefits of this life, but cannot of it self alone prefer a
man any higher.

Christian Allegiance is a virtue incorporate in the other good works of a
Christian Faith, wrought out of the supernatural principles of Gods Grace and
Word. A pagan may be loyal to his King, because the rule of Prudence and Moral
virtue prescribes him so to be. A Christian must be loyal to his King above
all men, because the Word of God (above all rules of Moral prudence) commands
him so to be: And so it comes to pass that Christian Allegiance issuing from
the supernatural powers of Gods Word, Spirit and Grace, is an act and work of
Faith in Christ, and efficatious to prefer the Subject to a supernatural
happiness in life eternal. Now your Petitioner being obliged by Sacrament no
less then 14. several times to this Christian Allegiance and profession of
his Kings Supremacy overall persons in England whatsoever, or howsoever; and
having likewise as often declared upon Sacrament of Oath, that he does not
believe that any Dispensator in the world (no not the Pope himself, the
greatest pretender that way that he ever yet heard of) is able to free, or
absolve him from that obligation: Now this Covenant quite dissolving that Bond
of Christian Allegiance, and obliging him clean contrary ways, though he will
not judge, much less condemn other men; yet if he should take it, all
circumstances considered, he could not but judge and condemn himself
apostatized from his Christian Allegiance, which is a great part of that
Christian Faith, in which he has hitherto lived, and wherein he desires God to
grant him strength and grace to dye.

5. Moreover, may it please your Lordships seriously to consider, how
detestable to all posterity the memory of those Gunpowder Traitors is, who took
the Covenant to extirpate our Religion, root and branch, by taking away our
King, Queen, Prince, Royal issue, Lords, Commons, Archbishops, Bishops,
Deanes, Deanes and Chapters* Archdeacons, all the rest of our Ecclesiastical
Hierarchy, and all persons in whom our Religion was conserved: There was
nothing in the persons destined to destruction, (neither Blood Nobility, nor
any other Malignancie) offensive to the Covenanters and Conspirators, but the
Doctrine, Worship, and Government of this Church; and that only of this Church,
not that of Scotland, Geneva, or any to be set up, for those were not in any
being here at that time, but prohibited, and proscribed by the same Laws and
penalties, whereby that of the Church of Rome was eff^ned; and our whole Nation
by a solemn Decree has devoted already to God Almighty the perpetuation of
the 5. of November, throughout all Generations, to an Anniversary Thanksgiving
for that his preservation of this Doctrine, Worship and Government in these
blessed persons, without whose conservation, Posterity had never come to see
this light; and in this Thanksgiving all men of this Church for these 42 years
have engaged their souls to Almighty God, either cordially, or at least
hypocritically (your humble Petitioner for his part professes cordially) with
what face or heart then can he possibly swear to the extirpation of that
Religion, for the preservation whereof before men and Angels, he has so often
given God hearty thanks?

Or with what devotion can he ever again upon the 5. of November enter into
Gods House, to give God thanks and praise for the preservation of that
Religion, which God sees him entered into a Covenant to extirpate? Nay, your
humble Petitioner appeals only to your Honorable Lordships, whether the blood
of our Forefathers and Ancestors, shed, and ready to be shed in Martyrdom,
for the Profession and maintenance of (...) Faith, Worship, and Government (and
not that of Scotland, or Geneva) would not cry to Heaven for vengeance against
their Posterity, that should now justify their Persecutors, and swear
themselves into the Office to extirpate all, without any exception of King, or
Parent, if addicted to that Religion, for which they so readily laid down their
lives? And whether the blood of those Gunpowder Conspirators can be silent
against these men that enter into Covenant now adays to extirpate that
Religion, for the attempting whereof, the mouths of the new Confederates even
to this day give sentence upon those Gunpowder Covenanters, that they justly
deserved those shameful deaths and executions, which by legal judgments came
upon them? Your Lordships Petitioner is therefore confident, that in your
Honorable and Noble Bloods there cannot be any desire, that either he, or any
true Christian Englishman should give the world an instance of such degenerous
unworthiness.

6. Last of all, seeing that your Lordships humble Petitioner after the loss
of all in this world, at your Honorable pleasure has passed the probation of
5. years in 6. Gaoles, by land and by water, with plunders, Sequestrations,
necessities, want of all means and support, save (that only which at this
blessed time we solemnly celebrate) the mission of God the Comforter into the
hearts of faithful Christians; (the public commemoration of that too by the
consequence of this Covenant (should your Petitioner take it) he must swear
for ever hereafter to abandon;) and seeing that all these Sufferings have not
been of force to impugn that grace of God, by which only (and not by any
strength or ability of his own) he professes himself to outstand.

May it therefore please your Honors, that this 5. years probation of
extremities, may suffice to give your Lordships indubitable satisfaction, that
your humble Petitioner cannot by any means of life, or death, be moved to
enter into this Covenant; and therefore that your Honors would be pleased to
think of any other course for the expiation of your Lordships displeasure upon
him, rather then to order him to perpetual imprisonment, even to death, and
that by want and Famine too, only for the preservation of that Faith, in which
he has with unspeakable comfort engaged his Soul to Almighty God.

And Your Petitioner shall pray, etc.
