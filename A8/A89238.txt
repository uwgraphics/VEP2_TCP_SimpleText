A MAGAZINE OF SCANDAL.

OR, A heap of wickedness of two infamous Ministers, consorts, one named
Thomas Fowkes of Earl Soham in Suffolk, convicted by Law for killing a man,
and the other named John Lowes of Brandeston, who has been arraigned for
witchcraft, and convicted by law for a common Barrettor.

Together with the manner how my Lord of Canterbury would put and keep them in
the Ministry, notwithstanding the many Petitions and Certificates from their
Parishioners, and others, presented to him, they being the head and most
notorious of the scandalous Ministers within the County of Suffolk, and well
may be said of all England.

And against whom as chief of the scandalous Ministers the County of Suffolk
have petitioned to the Parliament: And desired to be seen by the Parliament,
because herein is something mentioned, which is conceived, that one of these
scandalous Ministers have abused the authority of the Lords in Parliament.

And he that kills any man shall surely be put to death:

A Magazine of Scandal.
IF I should go about to declare all the devices and evil practices that
could be said concerning these two, namely, this common Barretor, and this
man-killer, it were an endless piece of work, and labor without end; but
having an intent to shoot at some few, which the least of them are too
notorious and too intolerable to be suffered in the Church of Christ. I will
avoid prolixity, and therefore omit in particular the many vexatious troubles
and suits that these two have troubled their parishioners and Neighbors in the
towns about them, how many they have undone and beggered to the terror of many
others: I will forbear to tell you how many were every Court day tossed and
tumbled at the Commissaries Court, so as the common proverb was, that they had
made a more beaten road and footpath to the Commissaries Court, then any
market path in all the County; I will not tell how many desperate deboist base
and vild persons, and some that have been three or four times arraigned for
felony were their dependants, and went with them from Court to Court, from
Assizes to Assizes, and from Sessions to Sessions, to act, accomplish, and
perform any unlawful and desperate devises, either by their false oaths or
desperate forces and violences, and many times some of them by pretense of being
Bailiffs to arrest men, have entered into men's houses, and taken away their
goods, nothing escaped if it were not too hot or too heavy; I will not publish
in what desperate manner these two have joined with these deboist Bailiffes
Conjunctim and divisim iojntly and severally in their desperate oaths to
accomplish their evil ends, and how they have shared in their booties which
these their dependants have so unlawfully purloined* I will not express the
many wrongs, suits and controversies, they labor and seek after to oppress
others and work thereby their own profit and advantage, as namely in
inquiring after broken titles and buying of them but never pay for them, in
hiring and entering upon any lands where there is any controversy, and so to
occupy the same for a very small matter, or for nothing at all, which is
unlawful in a Minister to occupy any temporal lands at all, and if neighbors
parishioners be at any controversy with his Minister for his tithes, then one
or both of these are the Antagonists and Champions to buy these tithes, and
will be sure to terrify the poor parishioner that he must fas or nefas, due
or not due pay what is demanded. To speak how these bend their shoulders to
uphold one another in their practices, and concur and hang together, it were
too tedious: And severally how they use their several postures and qualities
apart, the first, I mean the Mankiller setting all thought of his function
aside as no part of his calling, does in as ample husbandlike manner as any
husbandman whatsoever go to his labor (when other practices fail) as to
ditch, plowe, thresh, carry muck, dress his horses, and especially on Sunday
mornings, and comes to Church with his coat full of horse hairs, for he keeps
a teame of horses, and goes by the rode to carry timber to Woodbridge and
Ipswich, or any other carriage as duly as any carter by the Rode whatsoever,
being one indeed cut out for such a purpose rather then for the place he has
been suffered to hold, being likewise of a desperate condition, his hands
having been in blood, have threatened diverse of his adversaries to hurt or wound
them, and to that end has carried about him a most dangerous sharp weapon
comprehended closly in a staff, diverse others he has with violence beaten and
wounded, yea rather then he would be out of action he will beat his own wife
who has had a feeling in this cause, he has so feared diverse of his parish
and others with suits for no cause, most certain it is that he has extracted
and drawn diverse several great sums of money both from the able and unable,
rather then they would endure his vexations, and upon every occasion threatens
my Lord of Canterbury his warrant and great punnishments from my Lord of
Canterbury, and who but my Lord of Canterbury, upon whose presumption he was so
audacious that he durst do any thing, yea in the very act of receiving the
Communion, in the presence of near a hundred persons, most of them kneeling at
the Railes, in the Chancell, where he forced them to come, some of them having
received the Sacrament and others ready to receive it, in a most scandalous and
irreligious manner railed and used most menacing speeches, threatening my Lord
of Canterburies warrant, and therewith would fetch them up, using foul
terms, and would not administer the Sacrament to the rest that sat there
kneeling and ready to receive it as aforesaid, but in reproching terms turned
them away: And further his impudence is so great, that during the time of this
present Parliament in Michaelmas term last, and diverse times since he has
confronted the authority of the Lords house of Parliament, as upon the
declaration the honorable house will judge one Margaret Borret widow, having
gotten an order by petition from the Committee for Petitions from that
honorable horse, which did reflect upon this Thomas Fowkes, this Fowkes to
cross that order made a most strong affidavit, of which he will never be
wanting if need require, and thereby got an order in some sort opposing the
former order, but with this he must have his order (as he said) under the
authority as well of the Lords spiritual as temporal, or else is was nothing
worth, and so had and has often boasted that this order from the Committee was
nothing worth, because it wanted the authority of the Lords spiritual, and
that his order had the Lords spiritual mentioned therein, and the order from
the Committee had not, as by the several orders now remaining in the said
Lords house appear, and so maks by his speeches and reports the said order of
the Committee to be of no validity, because it wants the authority of the Lords
spiritual as his has, and in these and many the like, I might go on and have
no room left for an end. I will also give you a taste of the other, I mean the
common Barrettor; this title shows him of a pragmatick disposition, he is
nimble as a dancer, he will trip it from market to market, yea to London (being
a great Solicitor both at common law and spiritual) and enters into every man's
business that will have him or employ him, and takes upon him to advise more
then all the Counsel in those parts, and declares himself to have more
knowledge in the laws of the Kingdom then the best Lawyer of them all, and
indeed it has proved something to that purpose, for he has advised many to
their undoing: I will tell you of one excellent point of learning he practiced,
that is, he would press to be an arbitrator for men in many causes, persuading
both parties thereunto, promising either party to do what should be required,
but to be sure he served his own turn, and takes money of both parties, but he
that gave least was sure to be soundly crushed if not undone, probatumest. A
pretty conceit he had to bring a poor tailor within compass of the law, to
whom he ought a spleen, whose honest condition was not suitable to his, being a
man of such sobriety and constancy that this pragmatick Barretor could not in
the space of two years find occasion to vex him, at last making himself
familiar and loving to the tailor, sent for him upon a Sunday morning to come
unto him, and being in his bed desired the tailor to mend his briches
presently, for he was to put them on, which the tailor very simply did, but
before the that day after which was the next Court day, this Barrettor cited
him to the Court, and made the poor tailor know it was not lawful to mend
britches on the Sabbath day. I can tell you this Barrettor or pragmaticke is
also a brave Physician and Chirurgian, and can do more hurt in one hour then
the best Physician can do good in a year, he has much practiced this art;
And for a soldier he could have conquered more by his art and military skill,
then ever General Lesly or Spinola, or any other great Commander in the world,
for he can build castlos in the air, and he much wondered (as he said) why the
King did not send for him when the Isle of Rees vioage was, who could have
prescribed a way to have saved the lives of all the Commanders, and won all
the Country; what should I say of these two that are permitted to be in the
place of pastors and teachers of the people but as, Tully said of Cateline,
nullum scelus nisi per te, nullum facinus nisi per te, nullum flagitium sine
te, for there is scarce an evell project thereabouts but is hammered upon their
Anvile. Their Religion is either none, or else as the wind blows: If the
ceremonies be tending to Popery, none so forward as they, and if there be
orders clean contrary they shall exceed any Roundhead in the I Will of great
Britain; they both daily have frequented the company of known popish
Recusants, entertained some of them, and lodged them, nay which is more, they
have had the help, advise, and assistance of popish Recusants in many their
vild and abominable actions, and have had them for their greatest and chiefest
confederates, agents, and counselors to procure themselves the unjust getting
and obteining of money, goods, and other advantages. This Barretor (to make
short): has been so vehemently suspected of witchcraft, that he has been
twice indicted, and once arraigned for witchcraft.

Whether it be so or not, it is most certain that many have so accused him
upon their deaths, and it is most certain that he has used the society and
help of those that have been convicted and executed for witchcraft; for whom
he protested he would pawn his soul for theirs, and his body for their
bodies, and has had the society and daily frequentation of diverse others that
are vehemently suspected for witches, and without doubt has had the help of
such to work his intended purposes, and to further his dear brother in
iniquity the man killer, as brethren which comply together to destroy all their
opposers. And has declared that if he were prosecuted by his Parishioners, and
that they obtained their wills against him in putting him out of his Benefice,
then quoth he, there are some of their houses on fire about their ears, two
hundred miles hence is as good for me as here. Quis audivit talia horribilia?

One having lost certain silver spoones, the Barrettor sent post horse and man
to one Woolward a notorious reputed Conjurer, to help him to the said plate,
reposing (as it seems) trust in the devil to help him to what he desires. Now
these two brethren in iniquity dwell within a mile or little more one of
another, and are concomitants, fellow Coach-horses, and draw just together.
These went to Lambeth Fair together, and bought much of the trinkets that have
been reported there to have been sold; and I believe they paid well for them,
for they have had special Popish ware, and they have made as good use of their
ware as any within the kingdom of England.

What should I say? all this, and mill talia, which might have been declared,
were but talk and bare accusation, if proofs did not appear. Therefore (in a
word) I will tell you, the one is by law convicted for killing a man, being a
very some act, and so declared by Judge Crook, for he did beat out a man's
brains: and the other has been arraigned for Witchcraft, and convicted by
Law for a common Barrettor, both lately tried upon their several traverses at
Bury Assizes in Suffolk; the common Barrettor before Mr. Justice Barkeley, the
man-killer before Mr. Justice Crook, as by the several Records appear, and
one of them for the common Barrettor exemplified, against which Records there
is no averment or denial. And these are the two for which the Petition of
Suffolk against scandalous Ministers is chiefly and principally grounded. And
thus I doubt not these things appearing to be true, which are ready at all
times to be shown, some remaining on Record, and all the rest to be deposed
by many witnesses, will give satisfaction of the truth herein.

And now I come to show you how my Lord of Canterbury would and did hold and
support these two precious servants of his scill in the Ministry.

The manner how my Lord of Canterbury would keep them in the Ministry
notwithstanding the many Petitions and Certificates from their neighbors and
others presented unto him, they being the head of the scandalous Ministers,
against whom the County of Suffolk have petitioned.
AFter the former taste given of the outward comportment of these two rare
birds, I would that it might be a little understood of the inward matter they
are endued withal* I mean as touching their ability of learning and divinity,
for I make account by the former discourse that they cannot have much inward
grace, for they never sought for that at Lambeth fair, neither do I think that
any was thereto be sold, therefore I will apply my self to the other, I mean
their learning because you may understand what good cause my Lord of Canterbury
had so strongly to keep them in the Ministry: it may be thought that it was
their great learning; Indeed as for that, they had learning enough to preach
against them that would not pay treble their tithes and to enveigh against such
as they bore malice, and that in many unfitting terms out of points of
learning or divinity, but I would know first whether they can read well or no,
for I am sure that neither of them can write true English, yet they endeavor
to read their sermons, which I would not condemn if they were penned conducing
to the interpretation of the Scriptures, and not from any malicious spirit:
Scholars they are I confess, and had need to go to school still, for one of
them being demanded what Microcosmus was, which by interpretation signifies a
little world, answered that it was Latin for a mist or fog; the demandant
replied again it was true, for it was more then a mist, for sure he was in a
great cloud of darkness: and one of them at another time being demanded what
Plerophoria signified, which signifies, fullness of faith, he answered that he
did not like that word, because (as he thought) the Papists did attribute it to
the names of pictures and relics; and the demandant replied again that he
thought he did not like that word indeed, and believed, that he would never be
brought to like it, but quid moramur in istis? let us follow our text, and tell
you how my Lord of Canterbury would not by no means be informed nor persuaded
to hear any thing against these two for diverse of the neighbors having
desired their Solicitor to present diverse petitions and certificates to his
Lordship against the said Fowkes, and of his conviction for killing the man,
and also to inform him of the said Lowes, how he was convicted for a common
Barretor, amongst many other of the foul actions of them both: And it must be
understood that this Fowkes was ipso facto out of his function upon his
conviction, until the Lords great grace of Canterbury took great care to put
in great good Ministers, and so put him in again, and gave him a dispensation;
but before his dispensation, the said Solicitor presented under the hands of
his, the Fowkes, his neighbors and diverse others, a Certificate of his
scandalous life, and of his little desert both in life and doctrine, which was
at that time received by Master Dell his Secretary, and my Lords Grace took
special notice thereof, and kept it, and still has it, which to any man's
judgment had been enough to induce any Bishop in the Christian world not to
have dispensed with a man whose hands were in blood, and convicted for killing
of a man, which had been much if he had received a Certificate of the said
Fowkes honest life, and conversation; but howsoever there was something weighed
well with my Lord or Master Dell, or both, to induce my Lord to give him a
dispensation: But to the Ministry my Lord did restore him, by what Law or Canon
none can warrant, for none whose hands have been in blood ought there to
remain, which being heard and known, to the astonishment of many well
governed and able Ministers, as other laymen and religious people, conceived at
first that my Lord of Canterbury was abused, presuming he would not have done
it, and thereupon at the like request of the parishioners and others, the said
Solicitor addressed himself with new petitions from time to time, but now none
would be accepted, read, or heard, many of which are still to be seen: And the
said Master Dell his countenance was changed, the Solicitor received nothing
but rough speeches, yea threats sometimes, and told him we might have remedy in
the high Commission, and no answer could be had, but, go to the high
Commission: And my Lord of Canterbury being once pressed by the same Solicitor,
said, Away, would you have me undo a man for an unlucky blow? whereas nothing
was required but that he might be put ab officio, but not a beneficio, only
aiming to have him suspended from so holy a function, that with quiet minds his
parishioners might come to Church to serve God without brawlings and railings
on the Sabbath days, yea in the time of receiving the Communion, with which
they were daily vexed and troubled by him the said Fowkes, but my Lord did
excuse the matter and alleged, that he had Certificate from diverse of the
Judges, that his cause was to be pitied, and that he should kill a man in
kindness, or something to that effect as he said, which no man will ever
believe that any Judge will excuse any man after a conviction by law; but it is
most certain that Master Justice Crook before whom he was tried, never would
give the least countenance either in word or writing to extenuate so foul a
fact, and none else could (but before whom the trial was) declare how the case
deserved: And so after many repulses, and rejections, the parishioners and
others were forced (volens nolens) to cease their just complaint, and so rest
until it was conceived that my Lord of Canterbury might better consider of his
former passages, hoping he might be humbled by his restraint in the Tower, and
to salve such things as before he had done; they were advised to repair to
him there, and at their said request the Solicitor did repair to him in the
Tower, who then seemed to incline and to give ear to their request, and seemed
as if he would countermand his former dispensation, so as they could procure
something under Judge Crook his hand of the true and just desert of the fact,
whereupon the said Judge being spoken withal to that purpose, answered, that
what would my Lord of Canterbury have a better satisfaction then a conviction
by law, and if that were not sufficient it must be questioned whether the said
Fowkes had a lawful trial or not; whereupon a little before Michaelmas last,
the said Solicitor again repaired to him in the Tower, and because all matters
of objection might be taken away? viz. the alleged certificate from the
Judges, and his pretense that he did nothing but upon good grounds, the said
Solicitor presented him with this petition and information, with an affidavit
annexed herein, after mentioned, and there withal showed him the
exemplification under seal of the Conviction of the said Lowes of common
Barrery, requiring him (sede vacant) that he would not suffer such in the
Ministry, yet it seems he could not dispense with the weight that did hang so
heavy on the other party, but raited a new excuse, and answered the said
Solicitor, that by reason there was an act of Parliament that the high
Commission was taken away (which seemed to stick hard in his stomach) the had
no power to put out any out of the Ministry, were they never so bad, with other
allegations; but the said Solicitor answered, that he hoped although that the
high Commission was taken away, yet as long as he was Bishop of Canterbury his
power was not taken away to do the Church right in suspending scandalous
Ministers, or at least to countermand that his dispensation which was conceived
not to be justly done, and likewise to put out a common Barrettor, so convicted
by law, as by the Record which was then showed unto him under seal did
appear, which was an evidence of it self without further proof or witnesses:
but nothing would prevail, neither could his Lordship give any reasons to
avoid this said ensuing Petition or Information, which will more plainly set
forth the substance of his wilful perseverance in retayning such wicked and
profane persons in the Church, the tenor whereof follows, with an Affidavit
annexed in these words, verbatim and literatim, he himself receiving the
Original, with the Affidavit, under Master Page his hand, one of the Masters
of the Chancery, and does keep them until this present. Diverse other
material matters depending upon this cause could be manifested, if they might
be examined. But I hope this will suffice to expel these two scandalous
consorts, that infect both Church and Common wealth, and all such that are of
like condition.

Here follows the Petition and Information with the Affidavit, presented
verbatim to the Archbishop.
To the Right Reverend Father in God William Archbishop of Canterbury.
The humble Petition and Information of some of the Inhabitants of Earl Soham
in Suffolk, and diverse other neighbors adjoining.
Shows,
THat whereas your Grace has given dispensation to Thomas Fowkes of Earl
Soham aforesaid, Clerk, after he was convicted by Law for felony and
manslaughter, your Grace alleging you did it upon good ground, having a
Certificate from Judges and Justices: We therefore, being advised by Council,
do offer your Grace these reasons to the contrary, to be no ground, nor safe
for your Lordship.

1. First, for that by lawful trial at an Assizes he stands convict of the
fact, which is enough, if no more were said.

2. Secondly, that no Certificate from either Judge or Justice ought to be by
your Lordship admitted, whereby you should do any thing against any Judgment
or Confiction by Law.

3. That if it were allowable that any Certificate either from Lords or any
great personages whatsoever, should set a man right after conviction by Law, no
man would ever want a Certificate by one friends means or other, which would
be even the overthrow of the Common Laws of the Kingdom, and they that allow
so do no less.

4. Fourthly, if the King himself should be persuaded, or rather seduced to
cause your Lordship, or any other, bearing authority under him, to do any
thing against any Judgment or Conviction of Law, it should be your Lordships
part and duty to persuade the King to the contrary, and not to do it, being
the Law has passed.

5. Fifthly, it does not appear to what end the Certificate from the Judges and
Justices was obtained, for if it had been to do any thing against a
conviction they would never have granted or done it, but it seemed the said
Fowkes made the best use of it.

6. Sixthly, Judge Crook has been spoke withal to certify of the offense,
whose answer was, If a conviction at law were not a Certificate enough of the
fact: Then it must be questioned whether the said Fowkes had a lawful trial
or no.

It will be alleged against your Grace that you urged this cause against your
predecessor Archbishop Abbot, whose cause was far more to be tolerated then
this.

It will be urged and proved what free access the said Fowkes had to your
Grace and to your Secretary, with diverse conferences, and what rejections have
been to your Petitioners and their Certificates and Petitions from time to time
proffered, but never accepted, and your Lordship being once pressed upon, your
Lordship very angerly answered, that you would not undo a man for an unlucky
blow.

Neither was it or is it desired to have him undone, but only that he may be
taken ab officio, but not a beneficio, having only our ends to be quiet in the
Church, having often threatened us with punishments your Lordship should
inflict, even in the time of receiving the Communion, and many other matters
which by Certificate may appear most irreligious, but never were admitted to
be seen before the said Fowkes made means to your Lordship. Master Dell
gently did receive one Certificate, which still he has, but never after would
suffer any to be seen.

Please your Lordship to call to mind whom you have put out of the Ministry,
and whom you keep in.

Please your Lordship to see the affidavit annexed.

Please your Lordship to see a Record exemplified under seal, that one John
Lowes of Brandeston in Suffolk, Clerk, is convicted for a common Barrettor,
and to do with him (sede vacant) according to Law, it is evidence of it
self, and there is no averment against a Record, so likewise in the former
cause.

We desire not to trouble your Lordship nor our selves no further, if it shall
so please your Grace.

Here follows the Affidavit annexed.
A.S. of Woodbridge in the County of Suffolk Gent. makes oath that he knows
and has seen John Lowes of Brandeston in Suffolk, Clerk, twice indirected,
and once arraigned for witchcraft, and knows him to be convicted by law for a
common Barettor upon a full trial at the Assizes in Suffolk, as by record
under seal appears: he makes oath also that Thomas Fowkes of Earl Soham in
Suffolk, Clerk, is of a very scandalous life, and has heard many of his
neighbors and others complain of him, and have set their hands against him
for diverse scandalous matters concerning his life and conversation, and more
especially for railing and threatening often them with my Lord of Canterbury,
even in the time of receiving the Communion upon Easter day, and another day:
and moreover this deponent knows that he has been very conversant with Popish
Recusants, and knows and have been the greatest instruments for him to effect
and bring to pass some of his desired ends and practices. And he stands
convict upon a full trial at the Assizes in Suffolk for the killing of a man,
and was then conceived very foul against him, and was so proved by witnesses
in this deponents hearing.

Iur. 4. die Augusti 1641. John Page.
