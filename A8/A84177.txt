EVERY MAN'S CASE, OR, A brotherly Support to Mr. WILL. LARNER, Prisoner in the
New-Prison in Mayden-lane, LONDON. Also another Letter from a Prisoner, to Mr.
Larner.
BY Reason of your Sufferings, I am much grieved, especially to consider, that
good men should still be subject to the Tyranny of the late High Commission
Promoters, and Informers, the Stationers, through whose malice, both You and
your Servants are thus Imprisoned: We have known and observed them a long
time, how they have been a naughty and vexatious people to all Good Men, as
mischievous as any Pattentees in England: In the Bishops times, they were like
Setting-Dogges, to hunt Good Men and Women into the Star Chamber, and
High Commission Netts; and we see, it is to little purpose to put down those
Courts, and not Punnish those wicked men; for they hate all that are honest in
their hearts, because they that are honest, are against their Patent: and
therefore they studdy night and day how to undo them, and are like Mothes in
the State, creeping into employment, upon pretext of doing great service, but
indeed, being corrupt themselves, endeavor to make others so too, and mislead
them that give care to them, into such courses, as will in time make them
odious to the World, so true it is, that those that touch Pitch, shall be
defiled therewith.

And such as they have been, such they continue; for without doubt, they are
the principal cause why this inhumaine course of examining men upon
Intergatories is continued, especially in criminal causes, notwithstanding it
has been so cried out upon by Parliaments, by Martyrs, Ministers, and all true
Christian Lawyers, as a thing against the Laws of God, of Nature, Nations, and
of this Kingdom, (as was faithfully pleaded the other day in Colonel Lilburns
case, at the Lords Bar,) in which Case, and likewise in another of greater
moment, about a Petition rejected by their Lordships, their Lordships have
dealt so Nobly, and Worthily, as has put their Honors past all hurt or
blemish, From such Paperpellets, as have unhappily occasioned your sufferings:
And if all other Parties, intimated in that Paper, (Londons last Warning,)
prove when they are tried, as their Lordships have done, the Author will have
cause to repent his too hasty Zeal. And certainly their Honors had past it
over, and had not insisted thus upon you, but upon the Stationers instigation,
and misinformation; and will not persist to examine Free Commoners, ex Officio,
nor Servants against their Masters, against their Wills: all sorts of People,
great and small, ought to do as they would be done by; and God by his
Providence fails not first or last, to render measure for measure; Therefore
I hope, their Lordships will give care no longer to the malicious suggestions,
and insinuations of wicked men, but upon consideration of your faithfulness to
the Parliament, the affliction of your Wife, and family; and that a small time
of imprisonment may undo you and them, they will not retain you longer, but
set you free, and look upon the Stationers, as Cankers of the Commonwealth,
and destructive to all true Honor.

However, you do well to stand in the Liberty, wherein God, and the Law of the
Land has made you free, and not to be entangled with any yoke of bondage; the
greatest whereof, is for a man to be bound to Accuse himself, or another: and
next thereunto, is to be enforced, to be Tried otherwise then by his Peers or
Equals, in both which, you have carried your self like a true Englishman,
choosing rather to suffer imprisonment, and great affliction, then betray your
native Liberties, and the Liberties of your Country, for which, all good People
will ever love and respect you, and all others, who have done, or shall do, as
you have done herein.

Pilate is the first we read of, that endeavored this cruel distorting of the
mind, saying to our Blessed Savior; I charge thee by the Everlasting God, tell
us who thou art; a bad President for Christians to follow: and strange it is,
it should be owned by any but Star Chamber, High Commission, or
Pattentee-Christians; far be it from any that would truly deserve that holy
Name, to own so unholy a practice, and if any favor thereof, be to be found
in any of our Legal Trials, though it be but to Answer Guilty, or not Guilty,
as it came, and crept in by Tyranny, (for those who know the Truth, know it to
be so,) so ought it to be totally excluded by those, who would be esteemed true
Christian Lawmakers, or Reformers.

The Lords, by the instigation of the Stationers, have taken offense against
you, wherein themselves are Partees, and if there were no other Reason, it is
most unequal, they should be your Judges: But the Law of the Land is express,
That you a Commoner, are not to be adjudged of Life, Limb or Liberty, but by
Commoners, who are your Peers, and that upon sufficient Testimony of honest and
faithful Witnesses, face to face, in open Court. Friend, you are upon a sure
ground, for these things are so essential, to the Freedom of the People, as
Parliaments will never alter them; nor I hope, act contrary to them.

And therefore, however the Commons in Parliament, have (upon misinformation,)
delivered you up to the Lords, to be tried by them, yet may they as well
transfer all the Power they are entrusted with, by the generality of all the
Commoners of England, and refer the whole Government, to the sole disposing
of the Lords. And indeed, they have done little less in this act, then
delivered us all up to the Lords, for there is the same equity for their trying
and Imprisoning me, and so of every man, as for their trying and imprisoning
you; So that your case in this particular, Is every man's Case, though
generally, men are so sottish, as to be sensible of the lash, then, only when
it falls upon their own backs, not considering, That they may suffer to morrow
that misery and calamity, which today their Brother groans under. I hope
therefore, upon better consideration, the House of Commons will take you to
their own Protection, and deal with you, as is justly due to every Commoner,
and not hold you in Prison, unless by faithful and credible Witnesses, they
find by the Law of the Land, you are guilty of a crime deserving the fame.

And that must be no small one, for believe it, our Forefathers esteemed
Imprisonment no small Punishment. Frequent Imprisonment, is an effect of
exorbitant Power, by which, sooner then by any other means, plain and mean
People are brought to stoop to the Wills of the Mighty: it being the way to
destroy them, their Wives, and Families, by keeping them from their trades,
husbandry, and other Callings: and has served more then any one thing to break
the Spirits of the people: being a subtle politic punishment, that makes, and
keeps men tame, and fit for slavery, whereas all other punishments, if
injurious, makes people wild, and therefore this has been practiced by those
that have most encroached upon the Liberties of the English, as will appear by
Proceedings of forty or threescore years last past in Court, City, and all
Countries, every trifle has been sufficient to procure an Imprisonment, and
the Land groaneth under this intolerable burden still. But of all other
Testimonies of our Bondage, Close Imprisonment is the most manifest: where a
man shall be kept from the sight of his Friends, and Comforters in his bonds,
and in a ghastly apprehension of he knows not what mischief may befall him, as
has formerly happened to diverse great men, (that might be instanced in,) by
means of the advantage wicked men have taken from the opportunity of safely
doing mischief to a Close-Prisoner. Next to the Rack, and Torture, certainly
this is the most unchristian, unmanly, and irrational usage of Freemen, and
will, we hope, in this time of Reformation, be utterly banished out of this
Land: Never had Parliament such an opportunity as this has; Nor are we to
doubt, but they will perform the same: and I should be glad to see some fruit
thereof in their bearing toward you. And that they would look back upon the
Stationers, (and all other Monopolizers,) and remember them, when they shall
make suit to have the Printing of the Bible, or for other favors, that they
have dealt treacherously with the Parliament, and have ministered occasion of
much trouble and vexation to them, and many of their most faithful Friends,
being as the Amalekites were to the Israelites, in their Passage from
Aegyptian-Bondage, to the Freedom of Canaan. God, I trust, will at length
remember them, and will also, I trust, deliver you out of the power of their
malice, and recompense you a hundred fold for these your Sufferings. The
Commons in Parliament have a right in you, which they cannot disclaim; other
Judges you have not; it is most unequal you should have other, as I could in
few lines demonstrate, past all denial; but I will not do it now, and I hope,
I shall not have further occasion to visit you in this kind; I do not desire
it; I heartily wish you at home with your Family, as knowing a little longer
imprisonment, may prove your utter overthrow: which would very much afflict the
Spirits of your faithful Friends, and would not be for the honor or profit of
any. However, comfort your self in GOD, and be well assured, he will never
leave you, nor forsake you; And when the memories of those Officious men, that
solicit against you, shall be odious to all good men; you will be remembered,
as one that knew and maintained the just Liberties of England, and shrunk not
in time of Trial.

Another LETTER, from a Prisoner, to Mr. LARNER, Prisoner in Mayden-Lane.
ALthough this Kingdom has been long vassallaged, and kept under an Arbitrary
and inslaved Power of evil Governors, and corrupt Judges, and so far have
the Counsels of some prevailed, that for the freeing and recovery of our just
LIBERTIES, we have been necessitated to engage our selves in this costly and
uncertain war against the common enemies of our Laws, wherein the
Free-People have not spared to approve themselves, in pouring out their blood,
and spending their estates, neither have fainted in the worst of extremityes,
but with all cheerfulness have undergone all hazards and difficulties,
proposing to themselves no other end, nor expecting any other reward, then to
restore our Laws to their former vigor and strength, to recover, and leave
the same to their Posterity and Children, as a Portion and Inheritance; in
pursuance whereof, our endeavors have had such good success, that when we
seemed to be cast down, and given for lost, and irrecoverable, of a sudden,
even to admiration, we were unexpectedly raised again, and as it were restored
to new life, and victorious Trophyes gained over our Enemies, of late have been
so many, and great, that few Ages or Histories can parallel the same, so as we
conceived, all lets and hindrances were taken out of the way, which might any
ways prevent us from enjoying the benefit and comfort of these our good Laws,
and just Liberties, formerly trampled under-foot, yet so it is, that of Late,
by misinformation, and cunning underhand dealing, some under fair and
colorable pretenses, have attempted to bring us under a servitude, more
dangerous and destructive to our Laws and Liberties then the former, whereby
the Spirits of the People begin to be much dejected, their affections changed,
and many brought into a dislike of the present Government under the Parliament.
For daily, by abused Authority, one or other of late have been cast into
Prison, for no other thing then their clayming, and holding to their peculiar
Interests in the Laws, and for not consenting to betray their own Liberties;
But now, (Dear Friend, and Fellow-sufferer in bonds for the Common-Liberties,)
we shall not I hope any longer be deceived in our expectation for the fruition
of our long desired liberty; for the presentative body of this Kingdom, in whom
the high Powers of this Kingdom reside, have declared, We shall no longer be
denied Justice, neither otherwise proceeded against, but according to law; for
this is agreeable to their own words, laid down in their Declaration of the 4.
of April, 1646. which says, We declare our true and real intention and
endeavors, to be to maintain the Ancient and fundamental government of this
Kingdom, and to preserve the Rights and liberties of the Subject: what more
full then this for the vindication of our Liberties; what can we desire or
expect from them further, then for manifestation of their true intention, but
this, That their Actions and proceedings for and against us, to be suitable and
correspondent to their Expressions and Declarations, which until we find the
contrary, let us not doubt of, but with boldness put our selves forth, and
require of them the benefit of the good laws they have made and confirmed; and
I doubt nothing, but these Noble Lords will in this concur with the house of
Commons, and no longer be carried away through the subtle insinuation, and
sinister Practices of your Adversaries, and cease to prosecute or proceed to
further Trial against you before them, but will allow you that liberty which
in Justice they cannot deny you, to make your legal defense; and if you have
offended, (as in all criminal causes it ought to be,) they will not hinder, nor
prevent the Law, but give way, and consent, that your Trial be by your
Equals, and fellow- Commoners, according to the Fundamental Laws of this
Kingdom, and will cause you to have full and ample reparations for the great
losses and sufferings sustained by this their hard and in just Imprisonment of
your self and Servants; which being duly examined by the Letter of the Law, and
Magna Charta, will plainly appear to be so: For by Magn. 9. H. 3. cap. 29. it
is Inacted, and Declared, That no Freeman shall be taken or Imprisoned, or
otherwise destroyed, nor will the King pass upon him, nor condemn him, but by
the lawful judgment of his Peers, or by the Law of the Land: Justice and
Right shall not be denied, or deferred to any Man: As you are a Freeman, so
the law is your Inheritance, which you have stood and suffered for, and now, I
hope, both you and I shall receive the benefit thereof, according to their own
Declaration, and be no longer Restrained of our Liberties; which is desired of
him who is your Friend, and Partner in the same afflictions with you, for the
Common Liberty.

POSTSCRIPT.
Courteous Reader,
Certain Passages in the late Relation of the Illegal Proceedings against Mr.
Larner, were through some casual mistake omitted, which for the further
satisfaction of those who are desirous to be acquainted therewith, are
hereunder annexed. Viz.

That the uprightness and fidelity of the said Mr. Larner, to this present
Parliament, the ancient Immunities, Birthrights and Freedoms of the People,
ever has been such, as envy it self is not able to prove any thing against
him, to render him guilty; and though in his debursements for the common good,
he may not in the predicament of quantity, be numbered with the mighty and
wealthy, yet in quallity, he may challenge precedence from many such, even so
much, as the poor man's Mite sometimes exceeds the rich man's Treasure; for from
his own voluntary Freedom, he has abstracted from his Necessities, to make
an Offering for the Redemption of our Native Freedoms, which in Equity, is more
estimable, then ten times more, spared from redundant superfluity: yet
(notwithstanding his continued fidelity to the State), it is his unhappiness,
from the hands of such, who should rather cherish, honor and countenance him,
and all such who are so faithful to the Commonweal of this Kingdom, then to
suffer him or them to be still subjected to the malice of such fraudulent
Varlets, and but lately Episcopal Arbitrary Catch-poles as Hunscott and his
Confederates, who thirst after his blood; for it is Hunscots desires, (if his
tongue may give evidence to his thoughts,) that Mr. Larner might be whipped once
a day, for six weeks together, and then to beat Hemp other six Weeks, and
then to be hanged.

Hunscott by this (dear Friends,) tells his own fate,
Who well deserves a As well as a Thief may, etc.
Halter, from the State.
Such measure as he metrs another, ought (in equity) to be met to him again.

Such as are desirous to be further informed concerning the Native Freedoms of
this Nation, let them peruse the litte Treatise, Entitled Englands
Birthright, and the Book called, Another word to the wise. Where they may find
much worthy Information, and great satisfaction.

FINIS.
