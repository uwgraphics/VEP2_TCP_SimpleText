A Solemn and Seasonable Warning, to all estates and degrees of persons
throughout the Land; By the Commissioners of the General Assembly, Edinburg 17
December. 1646.
THe conscience of our duty, and of the great trust reposed in us, suffers us
not to be silent, nor to connive at the present dangers which may justly be
apprehended and expected from the enemies of this Cause and Covenant; Who
although they cannot in this coniuncture of time appear in the same manner as
formerly they have done; yet having retained the same principles (while they
seem to lay aside their former practices) do in a more covert and dangerous way
still drive at their own ends; And as Satan is neither sleeping nor idle,
though he appear not always as a roaring Lion; So these who are inspired and
acted by him, have their wheels still moving, though sometimes they make no
great noise. Wherefore that we may truly and faithfully contribute what is
incombent to us, for preventing or removing any occasions of new troubles or
differences between the King and his people, in both, or either of those united
kingdoms, or between the Kingdoms themselves; And least the Church of Christ,
and the true reformed Religion be again tossed with another, and perhaps a
greater tempest in the depth, after we seemed to be near the harbor; We have
found it, not only competent to our place and calling, but necessary for us
(according to former laudable presidents both old and late) To emit this new
Seasonable Warning to the people of God in this Land, and to all Estates and
Degrees of men therein; Whom we exhort, That first, and above all things, They
apply their thoughts to make peace with God, To take notice of the remaining
and renewed tokens of divine displeasure against the Land, To tremble at the
remembrance of former, and appearances of future judgments, To lament after
the Lord, To lie low before the Throne of Grace, To cry mightily to heaven for
dispelling that cloud of sin which separateth between our God and us, and for
turning away that cloud of wrath which hangs over our heads. There is cause
to be humbled and to repent, as for all our iniquities, So for the too little
assistance which has bin given to such as have born the heaviest burden, and
suffered most in this Cause; And for the too much compliance with, and
indulgence to many who have been active in the late execrable Rebellion. We
know that none can reach the perfection of their duty, neither will the Lord
reckon with his People according to his Justice, but spare them who walk in the
integrity of their Spirits, as a man spares his own son, So that they may
rejoice in his mercy, notwithstanding of their short-comings, wherein they do
not allow themselves; But wilful neglects are just grounds of a great
controversy on the Lords part, and of deep humiliation on ours: And we
conceive that the failings of many are such, because the Word of the Lord is a
burden unto them; And though they walk in the ways of their own heart, yet
they say they shall have Peace; We would have none that are thus guilty to
account light of it, and say, Is it not a little one? Every duty whereto we are
obliged in the Covenant, is of great consequence, and breaches even in smaller
things prove inlets unto more grievous revoltings.

When we consider how many who were once open opposers or secret underminers,
being received to the Covenant, yet remains disaffected to the ends of the
same; We cannot but think that we walk in the midst of snares, and that
mysteries of iniquity work amongst us, which may produce most sad and
lamentable effects, unto the prejudice of our Religion and Liberties.
Therefore, Because God has no greater quarrel against a Nation then that of a
broken Covenant; Let all who fear an Oath, remember the vows of God which are
upon them, Watch and Pray, and take good heed that they be not cheated nor
charmed into a violation of all, or any of the Articles of that Sacred and
Solemn League and Covenant; And let these especially be observed and avoided,
who do, or shall endeavor a division and breach between the Kingdoms, or the
making of any factions or parties contrary to the Covenant, under pretense of
preserving the King and his Authority, whilst they do not constantly and
sincerely prosecute and press our frequent desires of his subscribing the
League and Covenant, and giving satisfaction in all things to the just desires
of both Kingdoms; Which underhand dealing can prove nothing else, but an
abusing of His Majesty for men's own designs: We wish that none suffer
themselves to be deceived by any false glosses of the Covenant, under which
some may possibly urge the keeping of it, so as to draw us into a certain
breach thereof, and press the defense of the Kings Authority and of Religion,
to engage us in those ways that would tend to the ruin of both: We are not
now to press the want of full satisfaction in the much desired work of
Uniformity, as the ground of a breach between the Nations; Though we still
conceive, this Nation will never be wanting to prosecute that work to the
uttermost of their power in all lawful ways, according to the League and
Covenant.

These Kingdoms, after many fervent Supplications and faithful endeavors of
all the Lovers of Truth and Peace, have been happily united into a League and
Covenant, which to this day has been kept inviolably, notwithstanding of all
the opposition of open Enemies, and plotting of secret Underminers; And we are
confident, that none but such as have hearts full of Atheism and Treachery,
will attempt the violation thereof, in whole, or in part; And that if any shall
do the same, they shall expose themselves to the Curse of Almighty God, who
will be avenged upon all that Swear falsely by his Name. We know that men of
perverse minds, wanting the fear of God, and measuring all things by their
own ends, may conceive of it as alterable, or at least, that all the Clauses
or Heads thereof are not so to be stuck upon, but that some one or mo may be
dispensed with upon civil advantages: But we have not so learned Christ or his
Word; Both Nations have Covenanted with God, and each of them with another, in
things most lawful and necessary for the preservation and good of both,
without any limitation of time: And therefore we and our posterity are obliged
before God unto the observation thereof, as long as the Sun and Moon shall
endure. The sense of these things ought to be so deeply engraven upon the
hearts of all that are in trust, That as they should from their souls abhor
every thought of a breach with England; So should they carefully and wisely
study to avoid every thing that may prove a snare and tentation unto the same.
Amongst other things, If his Majesty shall have thoughts of coming to this
Kingdom at this time, he not having as yet subscribed the League and Covenant,
nor satisfied the lawful desires of his loyal Subjects in both Nations, We
have just cause to fear that the consequences of it may be very dangerous,
both to his Majesty and these Kingdoms; Which therefore we desire may be
timely prevented.

For so long as his Majesty does not approve in his heart, and seal with his
hand the League and Covenant, we cannot but apprehend, that according to his
former Principles, he will walk in opposition to the same, and study to draw us
unto the violation thereof, and the dissolution of the Union so happily begun
between Us and our Brethren, To weaken the Confidence and trust, and to
entertain Jealousies, and make divisions amongst our selves; Neither is it
possible, But that our receiving Him in this present posture of affairs, will
confirm the suspicions of (...) English Nation, of our underhand dealing with
him before (...) coming to our Army; And make them, not without cau^ to think
That We purpose to dispose of him without their consent, and to their
prejudice; Which is contrary to the Profession of these that were in trust at
his Majesty's first coming to the Scots Quarters, and overthrows all the
Arguments that have been used by the Commissioners of our Parliament in their
Papers concerning The disposing of His Majesty's Person by the joint advice and
common consent of both Kingdoms given in to both Houses of Parliament in
England; Nor do we see how we can vindicate such a practice from a direct
breach of our engagements to them by Covenant and Treaty; Which were not only
to expose us into the hazard of a Bloody War, but to involve us in the guilt of
Perjury. And what greater disservice could be done to His Majesty and his
Posterity, then to give way to a course that might prove prejudicial to their
interest in the Crown and Kingdom of England.

Our carriage now for many years past, in the midst of many tentations, has
put us beyond all suspicion in the point of our Loyalty; Nor have we the least
thoughts of deserting the Kings Majesty in a just and good cause, being bound
by our Covenant in our several vocations to endeavor with our estates and
Lives, to preserve and defend His Person and Authority, in the defense and
preservation of the true Religion and Liberties of the Kingdoms; And so far
as His Majesty shall be for these, We really are, and we trust the rest of his
Kingdoms will be for him: Yet we cannot deny, but openly avouch it, That if His
Majesty (which the Lord forbid) shall not satisfy the just desires of His
People, Both Nations stands mutually obliged b^ that inviolable Covenant to
pursue the ends therein expressed (which cannot be divided) against all lets
and impediments whatsoever. It is therefore our most earnest and longing
desire, That as these who are in trust with the public affairs of this
kingdom have heretofore with all earnestnes and care in all their addresses
dealt with His Majesty, with much strength of reason and vehemence of
affection, so they would still deal with him, to grant his Royal consent to
the desires of both Kingdoms, for settling Religion according to the Covenant,
and for securing a perfect and durable Peace (which we look upon as the only
hopeful means of preserving himself, His Crown, and Posterity) That His
Majesty may return to His Houses of Parliament in England as a reconciled
Prince to satisfied Subjects; And that acclamations of joy may be heard in all
His Majesty's Dominions, and no sound of War heard therein any more, except
against the bloody Irish Rebels, under whose barbarous and cruel persecution,
our distressed Brethren, both in this Kingdom and in Ireland, are still
groaning and crying out to us and to our Brethren in England, Be at peace among
your selves and come to help us.
