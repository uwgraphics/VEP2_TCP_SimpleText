A DISCOVERY Of Certain Notorious STVMBLING-BLOCKS Which the Devil, the Pope,
and the Malignants have raised to put Nations at Variance:

Together, With some zealous Wishes, that such Stumbling Blocks as prove
prejudicial unto the COMMONWEALTH of ENGLAND might be removed.

A Discovery Of certain Notorious Stumbling Blocks, which the Devil, the Pope,
and the Malignants have raised, to put Nations at variance.
THE Devil apprehending the increase of Christ's Kingdom, has insinuated a
capacity into the Sea of Rome, to suspect a Hircanum from the Northern parts;
And therefore has provisionally engaged its conclave, and has induced the
same to enjoin the Clergy of Spain, not to permit Justice to be done on those
who murdered Mr. Ascham, the Agent which this Commonwealth sent to Madrid; to
the end, that the procrastination of that expected Justice, might at least,
afford the Portingals time to give this State some satisfaction; conceiving
that by their so doing, the friendship of Spain might be slighted, if not
totally waved.

Moreover, that thereby Spain might be enforced to keep the longer
correspondence with the Hollanders, during which time, the Pope dispaires not
to gain many thousands of Vassals; for that since the last Pacification,
between the said King and the States General, of the United Provinces, many
thousand families in North Holland are said to have turned unto the Romish
Belief.

The said stratagem (hatched by an Italian Devil, Fostered by the Antichristian
Father the Pope, and fomented by a world of Malignants to boot) has another
reach in it; which is not only to stir up those North-Holland blades, but
also the several inhabitants of the other Provinces, to stand upon
Impossibilities; and to pretend that the Parliament of England has not only
been ill informed, concerning the advantages which might ensue unto the English
by the Act of prohibiting Importations; but that the Parliament ought to wave
their Act; when as the maintaining of the said Act, is conceived to be, not
only a Justice which may be expected from their grave and unalterable decrees
(less to be violated then the Parthian or Median Edicts) but also an effect of
the Parliaments tenderness and care of the public good and welfare; far
from a particular intent (as some Malignants have forestald) to undo their
neighbors, and especially the Netherlanders, for whose making and subsistence
so much of the English blood has been spilt, and such vast Treasures have been
exhausted.

On which particular, that, ever to be remembered Queen Elizabeth of England,
replied thus, unto a Solemn Embassy of those States when as they were in a
dismal condition) I will (said she) spend even to the last drop of my blood
for to maintain your People; reflecting on them, as on one of the Tribes of
Israel; and that she conceived also their cause to be Just: Nor do any true
godly reasonable English men conceive otherwise of them; so far forth as
concerns their fought for Liberty; when as they had bin tyrannized by such as
would enslave them; force them in the profession of their Belief; bereave them
of their lives, means, and laws. Far less, that any godly English had, or has
any intent to destroy that tribe; which has cost them so much blood and
treasure to defend.

Moreover, as the Devil and his arts Master the Pope (together with the
Malignants his firebrarnds) have on the subject of late Mr. Ascham forestalled
an Impossibility for Spain to give that Satisfaction on his particular, as has
ever since he was murdered been expected by this Commonwealth of England: So
likewise have they cast such a stumbling block in the Hollanders way, as to
mistake the said Parliaments Act of Importation, purposely to thwarft the
resolves, on the settling of a good and firm amity, between this Commonwealth
and them; for that otherwise, they full well knew, how that a difference (more
or less) for the reparation of the Amboina business, or for a due
acknowledgement of the Seas Right, ought not to be able to cause a breach of
Amity, between two such Potent Nations, who are of one Profession in matters of
Religion; of one and the self same strength by Sea; and who being in Peace may
counterpoise all the other parts of Europe.

Nor could they imagine that either party should be so overmastred by
firebrands (who only seek to fish in troubled waters) as to be hindered from
their shaking of hands, and from the fooling of the Devil who would needs
involve them in a cruel and bloody war, (which may be justly termed so,
should it come to such a pass) for that the displeasure of friends does
usually pass even unto extremes, and when as such extremes would even change
the name of a Narrow sea into a red Sea of blood, cause a cruel slaughter of
men, many widows and orphans when as finally many souls (which would be
separated from the bodies of enraged men in their hot blood) would run hazard
to find themselves knock at a wrong door in the next world, when as it must not
be supposed that as the Hollanders cannot presume to aim at a Conquest of the
English Soil, (which is so well guarded and defended by Saints) So likewise is
it not conceived that the godly English busy their minds with any thoughts
contradicting a Christian brotherly love nor that any of them do conceive it to
be possible so to drain the seas, as that the Hollanders should not be able to
make sailover them with their fleets, and consequently to encounter such as
would be minded to dispute the case by canon Law, for that the English must not
expect less, in case they should stand upon impossibilities, (putting the
Hollanders to pay vast sums of moneys beyond a possibility) but that the very
turf and fish wives amongst them would not only add to the number of those
who might even rise against their own Magistrates for to enforce them to wave
the furnishing of such vast sums and Treasures, as might be demanded of them;
but that they would also expostulate the case with their arms a kimbo, and
exaggerate the business with a Mine Here our Bugomasters, rather then we will
suffer this, we will venture our best Ghevoyert Nerssien off, that is our furred
coats, nay onse best pack, that is, our Sundays garments, and if that will
not do, you shall have onse silvere slentel reemen, our silver key chains,
rather then you should want of such a stock as may be demanded of you; But by
your leaves you shall not part with it, for that we will rather try whether we
shall not be as able to fight the English, (if it must come to it) as we have
withstood the Castilian and Austrian powers for the space of threescore and
twelve years together, and why should we not? since we may justly expect to be
backed by the Danes, the Swedes, the Spaniards, the French, the Polanders, and
who not?

In this manner ill humors chance to be raised by the Devils power, by the
Popes craft, and by the malignants drift, and not by the threatening effects of
this Months Eclipses forestalled by the present Almanac makers.

All which conduce only to the involving and intangling of several States
unto so endless a war, as that thereby, both the English and Hollanders may
be debarred from the reaping of the benefits of a Peace; and from the approving
of themselves to be two of the best tribes of Israel,

And that it may be the more apparent, that these our accomplices apprehended,
lest the Devil might at length be fooled indeed; Let us but observe how the
Romish firebrands themselves do cast apples of discord among our next
neighbors, and by how far a fetched reach they aim at the compassing of their
ends; even under the cloak of plausible pretenses; as for instance, on the
maintaining the Royal Diadem on the head of one, who is a Successor to a
second Saint Lewis, and Son to a termed Just Lewis.

So likewise on the other side, let us but reflect on the stumbling block which
the Devil has cast in the way, and how he has forestalled an
inreconciliability between those who profess one and the self same thing; for
that the liberty and welfare of all people, (the which he endeavors by all
possible means to thwart, could he compass the same) is not in any wise
consistent with the interest of a Favorite, and of a stranger to boot, such a
one as the Cardinal Mazarine is.

And to the end, that the Devils game may have the better event; why, as then
he moves the Papal Firebrands to debar that favorite from entering his
Territories; who in regard thereof, could not choose but prove to be the
isntrumental Stumbling Block, and the essential cause of an
irreconciliabilitie; all which he backs with a second far fetched reach, viz.
That by the means of the said conflict and contention, the conquering power
(either the French royalists, or that of the Princes) might be sure to compass
a peace between the French and the Spanish Nations; and that by the conjunction
of such a triumvironatical power, (of Bell, Book, and Candle trinkets;) their
forces might be the more formidably bent against, and their swords sheathed in
the bowels of Gods people, viz. One of the Tribes of Israel, which is but too
much left unregarded: that so by the same means, they might also (with the
greater ease) proceed to attempt on the Tribe of Israel, which is on this side
of the English Jordan; it being doubtless the Center whereunto all the lines
of the Papal and devilish crews compass do tend. That so they may by their
own power (and not by the influences of any Ecclipses either of the Sun or
Moon) attain unto their wicked ends; nor do they
