A DECLARATION OF THE MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT, Lately Dissolved by Oliver
Cromwell, Esquire:
ALthough we are turned out of doors, and threatened for endeavoring to put
some limitations upon the power of our mighty Conqueror, OLIVER CROMWELL,
Esquire, for the freedom, ease and settlement of our native Country,
according to our duties, and the Trust reposed in us, yet we cannot acquit our
selves to God and Man, without a protestation against the Usurpation,
Oppression, Cruelty and Falsehood of the Tyrant, and an information of all the
well-affected People of the three Nations, of their (too manifest) present
miseries, and future dangers, with our sense of the duty and necessity that
lies upon them for the prevention of the same.

And to pass over his Cruelties and Oppressions of particular persons, of all
sorts and factions, with his frequent transgressions of the Law, (for which
more eminent persons then himself have lost their heads, of late years;) We
cannot but with grief and horror remember his unparallelled striking at the
root of all our Laws and Freedoms together, by the frequent violencrs offered
to the Lawgivers, and the reasons that moved him unto it.

And to begin with the long Parliament: We know no other reason why the Army
was brought to Town, to drive away the major part of the Members then Sitting,
but because they inclined to a settlement of the Nation upon our excellent old
Foundation of King, Lords and Commons, which would totally have excluded his
Ambition, Rapine and Cruelty: For the King was reduced to the Parliaments
Terms, and if he were not Fit to be trusted, we know no reason why one of his
Sons might not; nor can all the world show a better Government, then that of
King, Lords and Commons, where we look upon the Lords as Mediators between the
King, and Commons, to hinder the encroachments of either upon other, if the
King should incline to tyranny, or the House of Commons to perpetuate it self,
and meddle with the distribution of Justice, in a corrupt and factious way,
when they should only make Laws and punish evil Ministers; And for the
MILITIA, to secure all this, if it be only trusted in persons hands of such
known integrity, as all the three Estates shall agree upon, We should be as
certain of a continual and secure enjoyment of our Liberties, as God will
permit us to be of any worldly thing, who by his providence overthrowes our
best Conceptions whenever he pleases to punish Us.

And the wisdom of that Parliament foresaw that we could never long be secure
from civil wars, and the danger of invasions, in behalf of the Family of the
Stewarts, considering their right, and the affections of the people to them, if
any other family or Government were settled, though it were a better: And for
that reason were they to be hunted away as enemies to his synister aims, and
the worser and smaller number left, whom he hoped to have made as servile as he
could wish them: but he found some English Spirits still amongst them, who
would not be brought to offer one of their equals the throne he so wrongfully
aimed at, and therefore he forced them out of the Parliament House by his
Soldiers, with many insolent reproaches, as men not worthy to be his slaves
any longer, and so fell the last remainders of our well built Government; Laws,
and Liberties, into the hands of our Infydell Grand Seigniour and his
Ianizaries, after all his hypocritical vows and protestations to live and dye
a faithful Servant of the Parliaments.

And to make it the more manifest, That this Conquered Nation had utterly
forfeited all its rights, he took away the Liberty of Election from the People,
and imposed a thing called a Parliament upon them that was to choose succeeding
Parliaments, like it self to act those things for him that he was ashamed then
to own, though now his impudence is well increased; but to say truth, was
sufficient then to take away that Fundamental Privilege of Election, which
none of our Conquerors ever durst think of before him.

But even those beasts of his own breed disdained such a rider, but when they
could not throw him, they let him alight and turn them to grass; and then he
had again (by his own confession, in his second Speech to this Parliament) an
unlimited power to do what he pleased with his poor slaves of the three
Nations; and he tells us that some Gentlemen whom he names not (but we suppose
he means his great officers, whom he only fears) did srame the instrument of
Government, and put limits to his power: else he good man could have been as
well contented to have been an unlimited General, as a limited Protector; and
this is evident by his well observing the limits they set him, and that he
swore to; for though they restored to the people the freedom of the Election
of their Members which he had taken from them, yet he stroke out many of those
chosen that he thought were not like to be his vassailes. but when we met, he
told us we were a truly free Parliament, that he assumed no dominion over us,
but intended to be a fellow Servant with us, and he often called God to
witness of his desire to divest himself of all power, and yet (after a second
purge of us) he has divested us of all our power, for questioning his in those
particulars that are more intollerably burdensome and unlimited, than ever any
Conqueror imposed upon the Nation: but we know not what the world will think of
us for ^o tedious a compliance with the unjustest Usurper, and the greatest
Murderer and Robber, that ever England had, but we shall only answer, that we
were desirous to give our Country some ease of their burthons since it was so
difficult to restore them to their liberty and security: but the Tyrants heart
is hardened, and out Ta^es must be again increased, according to his Lawless
will, upon pretense of the providing for the Army, which (he says) we have
neglected, when it is well known that the very customs and excize, without any
other imposition, would pay the Army, were it not for his excessive avarice,
and the chargeable pomp of his Family, but he will find another way of
providing for the honest party in the Army, if he be let alone: for since
Scotland and Ireland will not consume them, there must be more honorable
pretenses found to send them to some part of the Indies, there to perish
through want, or the intemper^ (...) of the air: and if any survive, they must
there end their days in a perpetual banishment, as the sour thousand already
sent under Venables are like to do, wh^ were so disposed of before he was so
angry with them as now he is, and they were the only people he was invective
against, in his first speech to this Parliamen^ Page 7. by the name of
Levellers, though he knew nothing of their design then; the truth is, he
will do any thing for his interest, and that will lead him to destroy them by
whole Sale, since their Spirits are not imbased by his former murthring of them
in parcels: there is no doubt, but he fears them the most of any people and it
is as unquestionable that those he fears most, he will hate most; and for the
Cavaleere and Presby^erian, let them judge of him by what they have (...) from
him, both in England and Scotland, the truth is, his demerits make him fear
and hate all people of any principles, and therefore he imprisoneth them upon
bare suspicions contrary to Law, and threatens to force out their very
thoughts, to make them accuse themselves and other innocent people, that they
may loose theit lives by no better a rule than his High-Courts of injustice,
and it is certain, notwithstanding his hypocricie that he must suppress all
sorts of people but Athiests, because no others will cut throats for him, if
they think nor themselves obliged to his destruction, which for our parts we
think the whole Nation has the most conscientious Obligation to, that ever
mortal men had for their Religion and Liberties; if then out oppressions and
dangers are still g^ing upon us as fast as he can invent occasions both at home
and abroad to increase them for his interest, what should deter us (since we
can have nothing worse) from joining with our Country men of any principles,
common interest, in the destruction of this devourer of all our security and
happiness,
