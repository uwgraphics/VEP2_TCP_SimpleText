A few words to the people of England, who have had a day of visitation, not to
slight time but prize it, least ye perish.
O England, England, many precious days of visitation has the Lord thy God let
thee see, Oh that thou had but known it: the Lord thy God has been very
gracious unto thee, O England, above manny Nations of a long time, he that
created the Heavens and formed the Earth, has made manifest his love unto
thee; to that in the conscience of thee (thou people of England) I speak, who
am also a witness of the Lords dealings with thee. I am the light of the world,
said Jesus Christ, which has lightened every one that comes into the world:
with which light O people of England, thou have seen the deceits that people in
thee and other Nations have lived in, and by that in thy conscience (O people
of England who was of late but little in thy own eyes) have thou seen the
deceits of them that were in Authority before thee, both the Bishops and their
Prelates, and their Prelaticall Authority, and the persecutions they used over
the people of God, and their usurped Authority they used over tender
consciences, that then were living in thee; thou wast not ignorant, nor it was
not unknown to thee, O thou people of England, how the Bishops with their
Prelaticall Authority and usurped power did fine imprison banish and lay wast
thy people O England, who for conscience sake could not bow down to his
Idolatrous worships, as thou then rightly calledst it: And O people of England,
it was not hid from thine eyes, neither was thou ignorant, how others who were
called civil Governors, and had the Authority of Majestracy in thee O England,
did usurp Authority over men's persons estates and consciences; And to thee O
people of England it was discovered, what corruptions those and all other in
Authority lived in, that then were heads of the Nation; and then thou could
have cried, The Judges judge for reward, the Prophets Prophecy falsely, the
Priests bear rule by their means, and my people love to have it so, but what
will ye do in the end thereof; was not this thy cry in that day when thou wast
in distress O people of England? to that in thy conscience I speak; Was it not
a grief to thee when thou wast kept low? yea the grief of thine heart to see
people persecuted, mocked, and imprisoned, or banished under names and titles
given them by their enemies, wherewith to cover their bloody enterprises? and I
call that in thy conscience to witness, if thou did not languish under their
tyranny in those days? and how many prayers and tears has it cost some, and
how much imprisonment others, and how much banishment others; and in these thy
languishing days of sorrow have thou with tears and prayers, and with hands
lifted up entreated the Lord that he would be pleased to pull down that
Authority which did then usurp and bear rule over tender consciences in this
Nation, and them that did uphold it? and how many vows promises and engagements
did thou make in thy lownes and distress, if ever the Lord would give thee
power and strength to overthrow the Tyrants that then bare rule, and if ever
the Lord would bring those Tyrants and their laws into thy hands, thou would
utterly destroy persecution out of England for ever, and make England a free
Nation; was not this thy engagement and promise O people of England, when thou
wast under, and in distress? to that in thy conscience I speak, O that thou
would give it leave to answer me, that thou might come to see where thou
have been and repent, for here thou wast that in thy conscience will witness
for ever.

And now O people of England, the Lord God by whose hands the Heaven and the
Earth was made has granted thy request to the full, the Lord has not been
slack but has given thee what in tenderness thou did desire; What dare
thou charge the Lord with, that he has witholden from thee, which in freeness
in thy days of sorrow thou did desire? the Lord has brought under thy feet the
necks of them that did oppress thee, and the Lord has brought into thy power
their Authority and their Laws, and subdued them all under thee, to the full
request of that which then breathed under did desire; to that which condemns
the d sobedient do I speak, which is an eternal witness to thy face before
the Lord, how thou have performed thy Covenant, which thou made with the Lord
in the day of thy calamity: Consider, take heed to that in thy conscience,
return, the living witness for God will not be mocked with words nor shows, to
the light of Christ in thy conscience look, and it will let thee see, that the
same Laws which thou in thy adversity and lowness did promise to pull down
are standing still; are not oppressive Laws to compel men to pay Tithes, to
the maintaining of coveteous hirelings and tithe-mongers, standing in as great
force as ever? and many of their outward estates spoiled by these oppressive
Laws which thou promised to take away? and this is not done by an enemy of
thine, but even by thee who did profess to be faithful in performing thy
Vows to the Lord: Thou fair professing people of England who have made so
many fair promises to take away oppressions, to the light of Christ in thee I
speak which will witness me and condemn thee, for holding up these things
which thou promised to the Lord thou would pull down, except thou repent with
speed, and let the light in thy conscience judge if these persecuting Laws
under names and titles be not standing yet in as great force and power as ever
they were in thy forefathers days, which the Lord by thy hand has destroyed,
and thou do now exceed thy forefathers in persecuting the innocent under
names and brands which thou do put upon them, that the truth may appear
odious, and that persecutions done by thee may be supposed to be punishing of
errors, as thy forefathers ever did, as at this day is plainly made manifest
in many places of thy Land, O fair promising people of England; and many
people tender and dear to the Lord in in many a Town and City of thy Nation is
imprisoned without any Law or cause at all, nay not so much as Queen Mary, the
Papists Law to allege against them; was there ever such things done by thy
forefathers which I have destroyed before thee? have thou already forgotten
that the Lord pleaded the cause of the innocent with thy forefathers and
overthrew them? O call to remembrance what the Lord has done to thy
Predecessors in former time (who persecuted the innocent and tender hearted
ones) who hardened their necks and would not regard the counsel of the Lord,
which was and is the light in all consciences, which light once shone in thy
conscience, by which thou saw them which lived in persecuting and oppressing
the seed of the Lord in its arising and appearance; and people that in thy
conscience is witness against thee, that thou art left without excuse, and
also that in thy conscience the light is witness against thee, that thou have
built the Sepulchers of the Prophets, and garnished the Sepulchers of the
righteous and whited them over with fair words and promises, and thou say
if I had been in the days of my fathers, I would not have been partaker in the
blood of the Prophets, and yet thou art filling the measure of thy fathers
iniquities, and the same wrath, curse, and judgments of God waits to be
poured upon thee, except thou repent, and be warned in time; many warnings have
thou had from the Lord (that in thy conscience can witness) by the hand of
them that are and have been persecuted by thee and imprisoned by thee, but thou
have cast them behind thy back, as all the persecutors in all ages have done
before thee, who by the power of the Lord were destroyed; and now O fair
saying people of England, by the same power thy destruction comes for truce
breaking with the Lord, and let that in thy conscience judge, if thy judgment
from the Lord be not just upon thee, which will appear in the day of thy misery
and overthrow, though thou for a while tread above it; but if thou have not
totally put out the light, and if any spark of light be in thee thou may see
thy self going the way of all bloody persecutors into perdition, for ever and
ever, except thou repent, and remember that thou art once more warned, and no
more warning can I promise thee, whether thou will choose or refuse. And again
hear the word of the Lord thou people of England, if thou will not be warned
nor repent, but wilt harden thy neck against the tender Lambs of my pasture:
Thus says the Lord, because of the Cry of the oppressed, and the many
prisoners which contrary to my Law thou have imprisoned for no other Cause but
because they cannot worship thy Idol Gods which thou have set upp, and the
Idol Gods which thou have set upp are many, for thou have promised many fair
promises to take away Idolatry, Superstition and Oppression, and all Laws over
the Consciences of men, that I the Lord might be worshipped according to my
own will, which I have made manifest in my Childrens Consciences, and that my
Gospel, even the word of eternal life, might have free passage through thy
Land o England, but now I see the sins of Jeroboam which caused Israel to
sin, are held up by thee, Yea the high places which are in thee o people of
England, and the Priests of thy high places bear witness before my face
against thee, which thou have set upp contrary to my Will, which I have made
manifest in every man's Conscience; and for what end did Jeroboam set upp these
high places, and those Priests, was it for this end that he was afraid that the
people of Israel should return to the Temple at Jerusalem to worship, which
then was Commanded of God for his people to worship at.

And now O people of England, thus says the Lord, who pitied thee when thou
little in thy own eyes, and put a sword in thy hands to cut down Idulatry,
high places, usurping Priests made of the basest of the people, and corrupt
Laws, wherewith they did tyrannize over the Consciences of my people, and
pride and respect of persons, which then I let thee see to be before
destruction, and thou wast bearing, but now have turned thy sword against them
who are brought out of those things, and witness against them; and now I the
Lord thy God in visitting thee, and thy work, have found unfaithfullnesse, in
what thou promised to me in the day of thy Calamity, and unfaithfulness in
thee in what I looked for at thy hand, for now I see that thou O people lifted
up, do hold up the very same high places, and as bad a generation of Priests
as thy forefathers did, and the same usurped Law over men's Consciences, and
the same persecuting Laws, even the Laws of Papists, wherewith to imprison my
servants, yea not respecting persons is made a Law for thee to imprison many of
my servants, and many of my servants are imprisoned by thee, because they
cannot break the Commands of Christ, and many of my dear Children are
imprisoned by thee, because they cannot pay Fees for being imprisoned and kept
many months without any just Law broken, as at this day there are many
Witnesses of my dear servants, whose witness thou do refuse, because they
abide in my Doctrine, and dare not swear at all, but their witness have I
received against thee, because I know their sufferings, and their Cry is come
before me, and this is the Cause why thou hold up these things, even the
sins of thy forefathers, which made England sin, for which I will plague
thee with all my storms; Thou people of England art afraid, that if liberty be
granted to worship me according to my Will which I have made manifest in my
Childrens Consciences, that then the hearts of people which thou would have
to serve thee, and feed thy lusts, will be turned unto me, and then thy
covetous hireling Priesthood which in all ages I have cried against, will fall
down, and thy pride will famish, and wither, and thy oppressions will cease,
whereby a great part of thy wickedness is upheld, and thy honor will depart
from thee, and return to me, and thy respect of persons which thou art so mad
on, which I have and for ever forbid and deny, and for fear that those and
the like things should come to pass upon thee (to that in thy Conscience which
is of me which thou hate do I speak, which will witness me and condemn
thee for thy stiffe-neckednesse) that this is the cause that thou do so
torment my tender Lambs, and because thou do these things, and will not be
warned, but wilt still provoke me to jealousy by thy Idols, I even I which
plagued thy forefathers, will proceed against thee by my sword, I will plead
with thee by and with the fire of my jealousy, till thou that would not
obey my Council which I did give in thy Conscience be utterly laid wast and
desolate, and I will blott out thy name, as I have blotted out the name of thy
forefathers who held up the same thing that thou do, and I will get me
honor in destroying thee, as I got me honor in destroying thy fathers before
thee, and thou shall know that I am the Lord God, whose hand is not shortened
but is strongly stretched out to destroy and slay all that will not that I
should reign over them; therefore expect my plague, for it is near at hand to
come upon thee, and my hand will I hold no longer, for because of the Cry of
the oppressed and the many prisoners who unjustly suffers, my heart is moved
with pity toward them, that I can hold my hand no longer, but suddenly power
forth my hott displeasure upon thee, for I will not always strive with thee
but will come quickly; the Cup of thy fornication is full, and the Cup of my
wrath is full also; and now expect fullness for fullness, this is thy portion,
wrath for pleasure thou shall receive, I the Lord have spoken it, whose word is
without repentance; and now people thy time is short and draws very nigh,
except thou will be warned.

This was I moved of the Lord to write in the name and power of the Lord, to be
a warning to all who love to see Jesus Christ's reign, that either have done,
or countenanced the hard-hearted Generation of persecutors; Now I have cleared
my Conscience to thee in the sight of the Almighty, not desiring the death of
any, but rather that thou would turn and be saved, in love I rest a Friend
to that which the proud and selfe-exalted Lords over, and for my love to them,
by them in scorn am I called a Quaker, whose earthly name is Christopher Fell.

A warning to all the Rulers in these Nations.
ANd now o Judges, Rulers, and Heads of the people in these Nations, you may
read your Cloud of Witnesses who are your example, who persecute the Innocent,
and turn aside the needy for a thing of naught; You may read in the Scripture
what they were, and what manner of Princes, Kings, and Rulers they were, who
were persecutors in all Generations, and do not you say in your hearts you are
Christians, and walk in the same footstepps of them who persecuted the
Prophets and them that were sent early and late to forewarne them, and stood in
the gate and declared in their Towns and Cities against the abominations that
were committed; and Jeremy they put in the Dungeon that his feet sticked in
the mire, and put his feet fast in the stocks; and Micha in prison, and
Daniel in the Denn of Lions, and Herod and Pilate were made Friends in the
persecuting of Christ, and they set him at naught, and the Priests and the
Rulers conspired against him, and sought to entrap him in his words; and the
Apostles they put in prison, in the stocks, and whipped them and scourged
them, and commanded them to depart out of their towns and villages and Cities,
and called them seditious, and pestilent fellows, and said they bred tumults
in the Cities, when as they were tumultuous themselves, and persecuted, and
mocked, and shamefully entreated: And now you that are found acting in those
practices are found acting the same, you may read your Cloud of Witnesses and
your example, and be ashamed o England, England, and Ireland, is this the
fruit of the great profession you have made so many years, and now when you
are proved the best of you is as a brier, and the most upright sharper then a
thorne-hedge. What is become of the promises you made in the day of your
Calamity, when sorrow and fear and oppression compassed you about on every
side? Has the Lord broken the yoke from all your necks, and is your finger
becoming heavier then their loins? Was there so great oppression and cruelty
acted among the Bishops and Prelates? Was prisons so filled, was there such
ginnes and trapps laid for the Innocent when their High Commission Court was
upp?

O shame shame! that ever it should come in the ears, or be reported in other
Nations, that ever you should requite the Lord thus for all his love and
mercies; that he should break the yoke from off your necks, and scatter your
enemies on every side, and cut them off in his wrath, and has given you their
habitations to dwell in, and the power into your hands. Shall the axe boast it
self against him that hewes therewith? and will ye requite the Lord thus for
his love? Surely these things are come before the Lord, and a book of
remembrance is written; and all these things shall stand as witness against
you when the book of Conscience is laid open: But you, may be, will say, you
know no such that suffers for Conscience sake; Turn but your ear and listen
but to every Goal and prison in every County, and there may you see many of
your poor Brethren stopped upp in holes among murderers, and thieves, and
transgressors, even they who have borne a part with you, in the sufferings with
the Nations in the heat of the day, and if you say they have transgressed any
Law, why do you not execute it upon them, but some kept in prison two or three
years, and never called to know what is the matter. But friends know this, many
suffers now for the transgression of no known Law, but may be have cried out
in your Towns against iniquity, or have declared against the blindness and
ignorance of some who go in the way of the false Prophets, and in the error
of Balaam; O the Land is full of such Deceivers as have flattered the people
and her Princes, till the Lord bathed his sword in their blood, and now they
are flattering you, and sowing pillowes under your arme-holes; If you say as
the Pharisees said, We have a Law, and by our Law he ought to dye, if you
execute those Laws and stand to those Laws which were made by them that
oppressed you, the same shall come upon you, as came upon them, and God will
break the yoke from off the necks of the oppressed, and the yoke shall be laid
upon yours who makes a man an Offender for a word, and therefore consider, a
warning to you all, and be you warned from the Lord God, to cease from
oppressing the Innocent, nay you are left all without excuse, for I know you
are not ignorant of these things; and further I say unto you, uphold not them
by your power who are flattering the Nations, and crying peace, and daubing the
people with untempered mortar, and telling them they are Christians when they
are Heathens, and live in that nature that puts Christ to open shame, for the
hand of the Lord is against them, and prophanes has gone from them, those
Teachers that use their tongues and say, he says, when the Lord has never
spoken to them, and therefore the people are lost for lack of knowledge, and
there is not one among them that is able to turn any from his Iniquity; and
therefore I say unto you, stint not nor limitt not the Lord by your wills, nor
your Laws made in your wills, for if you do he which rents the heavens, and
makes the earth reele as a Cottage, will break you and your Laws together,
and there shall be none that shall be able to deliver you out of his hand who
is pure and holy just and true, and will not give his glory to another, for he
alone works and who shall let, and will bring his own work to pass, and
none shall hinder; and therefore take heed you strive not against the Lord, and
so be broken upon the stumbling Stone to pieces. A lover of righteousness and
a Friend to all just power.

A warning to all the World.
WOe woe unto all the Inhabitants, for the Lord God of power is coming in Power
and great glory with ten thousand of his Saints to judge the Earth, and to make
a desolation, and an utter overthrow, and a Consumption shall come upon all
flesh, and its glory shall be stained, for all flesh has corrupted its way and
gone a whoring after other Gods, and has committed fornication with strangers,
and whoredoms with the uncircumcised, and the Land is filled with monsters,
and the living God is departed from, the Lord is grieved, the Lord is weary
with forbearing, and will no longer forbear; Now is he arising to execute his
Judgment in the Earth, and to sift the Nations, and all shall now be put into
an even balance, and the wicked shall be as dust and as chafe which the wind
blows away, and shall be scattered and never more gathered, for a fire is come
out of Sion, its before the Lord of Hosts, and its tempestuous round about him;
Coals of fire are kindled by the breath of his nostrills, to burn upp all the
stubble and chafe, even by the breath of his mouth the Lord has uttered his
voice before his Army, for his Camp is great, as a Lion and is greedy of his
prey as a young Lion, he will not spare but devour and destroy all the
uncircumcised, and cut off from the Earth even all the abominable: Tremble,
tremble, O Earth before the Lord, and all ye careless Sons and Daughters
that live at ease in the flesh, in wantonness and in mirth, a day of howling
is coming upon you, a day of sorrow and lamentation; Howl howl and weep ye
that spend your days in vanity, in lust and pleasure, killing the Just; ye
Drunkards your throats are as an open Sepulcher, your throats shall be dried
upp and parched with the flame of the Lords indignation, the Lion shall be
famished; Dives end is your portion you covetous greedy Deceivers, oppressors,
liars, swearers, proud, envious, contentious quarrellers, ye vain aerie light
minds, ye are as dust, and will have your portion in the lake that burns;
Tophet is prepared, Hell has enlarged her self, the grave stands open to
receive you, the Pit has opened her mouth, the Deep shall swallow you upp,
ye rebellious and stiff-necked Generation, who fears not the Lord, but adds
sin unto sin, behold the day is coming, ye shall wish the Mountains to fall
upon you, and the rocks to cover you, and shall seek death, but shall not
find it, the Arm of the Lord is stretched out, the band of the most High is
against you, you fruitless trees that cumber the ground, you shall be cut upp
by the roots and cast into the fire, ye liars, swearers, cursed speakers, ye
proud and covetous, double dealers and hypocrites, which say in word what you
are not in deed, and make a profession of the name of God, but departs not from
iniquity; the trumpett of the Lord is blown out of Sion, the Alarm is sounded
out of the holy Mountain, let all the Inhabitants of the Earth tremble, a
noise of war and rumor of war is heard, his sword is furbished and
brandished to make a great slaughter, and the slain of the Lord shall be many;
O ye potsheards of the Earth, will ye strive against the Lord, will ye set
briars and thorns in battle against him, who shakes the Heavens, and makes
the Earth reele as a Cottage, which dryes upp the face of the deep, and cutts
off all the fresh Springs, and makes the Cedars fall, and powers down snares
upon the wicked, fire and hayle, storm and tempest, and pillars of smoke,
this shall be your portion to drink, the mouth of the Lord of Hosts has
spoken it; O foolish people and unwise, when will you seek after Wisdom,
Wisdom has lift up her voice in the streets, but you have stopped your ears
as deaf Adders, and say in your hearts, we will not have righteousness to
rule over us, but we will walk as our Fathers, and worship as other Nations
do, and as them whom the Lord has cut off out of these Nations as untimely
fruit, and are perished with the uncircumcised: Fear fear, tremble tremble,
ye Careless ones, ye hard hearts, ye rocks shall be broken, ye Cedars shall
fall, ye strong Oaks shall be cut up by the roots your root shall perish, ye
Mountains shall melt, ye wild savage Creatures, that are as wild Asses upon
the mountains, a month is coming wherein you will be found, And a day is at
hand wherein you shall see him whom you have peirced, yea, behold the Judge of
all the World stands at the door, even of the quick and the dead, and he comes
in the Clouds with power and great glory, and every eye shall see him, and
every heart shall melt, and all faces shall gather palnes, and all knees shall
smite together, and every tongue shall confess his Judgment just, when he
shall execute his wrath upon you, and sweep you into the pit, and blow you
away with the whirlewind of his wrath, and then you shall be judged out of the
book of your Consciences, therefore fear fear and repent, repent and prize
your time while you have it, and mind the light of Christ Jesus that shows you
your Iniquities and sins, and it love and it will turn you from sin and
unrighteousness to Christ Jesus, from whence the light comes, and it love and
it will judge all your vain actions, and bring condemnation upon all the
deceit, and lead you to true confession and forsaking, and to know the Lord is
pure and holy, and nothing that is evil can dwell in his sight; and so
remember you are all warned in your life time, least you be swept away into the
pit, and perish for ever and ever, and there be none to deliver you, and unto
you this is the word of the living God, whether you hear or forbear.

A Lamentation over all England, who are yet under the curse, and are yet in
their first nature, and shut out from the presence of the Lord.
THere was a time when Christ wept over Jerusalem, so do I even lament over
thee O England, for the same nature bears rule in thee now as was in Jerusalem
then, for thou art persecuting them now, Mat. 23.37, 38. Luke 13.34.
who are sent to forewarne thee of the evil of thy doings O England, how would
the Lord have gathered thee together as a hen gathers her chickins under her
wings and ye would not, but have gone on contrary to the light in the
conscience, therefore your habitations shall be left unto you desolate; Woe be
unto you Scribes and Pharisees hypocrites, for you build the Tombs of the
Prophets and garnish the Sepulchers of the righteous, and you are saying, Mat.
23.29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34.
if we had been in the days of our fathers we would not have been partakers
with them in the blood of the Prophets, and so you are witnessing that you are
the children of them that murdered the Prophets, and ye are fulfilling the
measure of your fathers, O serpents the generation of vipers how shall ye
escape the damnation of hell? behold I send unto you Prophets and wise men, and
of them shall you kill and crucify, and of them shall you scourge in your
Synagogues and persecute from City to City; and in thee oh England is this
Scripture now fulfilling, O England, England, that thou did but know the
judgments that hang over thy head because of thy disobedience, and because of
thy going on still contrary to the light in thy conscience; O England be
obedient unto the Lord in this day of thy visitation, O that thou had an eye
to see where thou stand, for thou stand upon a slippery standing, Romans
15.2.
as a Sea of glass with fire, ready to fall into destruction thou art for thy
disobedience unto the Lord thy God. O return, return all you that are in the
first nature, going on in your sins, in lying, swearing, scoffing, jearing,
pride, coveteousnesse, backbiting, envying, cozening, cheating, and all manner
of wickedness, Genesis 3.24.
O you are shut out from the presence of the Lord, and the flaming sword is
turning every way to cut you down, Rev. 12.12.
so that you cannot come to the tree of life; Woe be unto the inhabitants of
the Earth and of the Sea, for the Devil is come down unto you having great
wrath, knowing that he has but a short time; therefore return unto the Lord,
and seek him whilst he may be found, for this is the day of the Lords love unto
your souls, now while you have time prize it, least ye be cast into utter
darkness, there shall be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth, and there
sinners that dye in their sins shall be tormented for ever.

Mat. 25.30.
I cannot choose but lament for thee O England, O that mine head were full of
water and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep for thine
inhabitants O England, who proceed from evil to worse, and they have not known
me, says the Lord, But let every one take heed of his neighbor, and trust ye
not in any brother, for every brother will use deceit, and every friend will
deal deceitfully, and every one will deceive his friend and will not speak the
truth, Jer. 9.1.
for they have brought their tongue to speak lies, and take great pains to do
wickedly, their feet are swift to shed blood, their throat is an open
Sepulcher, under their tongues is the poison of Aspes, their habitation is in
the midst of Deceivers, because of their deceit they refuse to know me, says
the Lord; Therefore thus says the Lord of Hosts, Behold I will melt them and
try them, for what shall I else do? for the daughters of my people their
tongues shute out and speaks deceit, one speaks peaceably to his neighbor
with his mouth, but in his heart he lays wait for him: O I lament for you to
see the miseries that are coming upon you without ye repent; therefore,
return, return, O England, unto the Lord and he will heal thy backslidings
and love thee freely; Return, says the Lord, and I will not let my wrath fall
upon you, but thou have rebelled against the Lord thy God, and have scattered
thy ways unto strange Gods under every green tree, but ye would not obey my
voice, says the Lord; Jer. 13.6.
O ye disobedient children return again, for I am your God, and I will take
you one of a City and two of a Tribe and will bring you to Sion if you be
willing and obedient: Therefore O England yield up obedience unto the Lord and
he will make three the glory of the Nations; wash thine heart clean from
wickedness, and hate the evil, and love the good, and establish righteous
judgments in thy Gates, and the Lord will be merciful unto the Remnant that
has escaped the dark and cloudy day, for the long night of Apostasy is over
and gone, and the bright morning Star is risen in the hearts of the Sons and
daughters of the most high, praised be the Lord that it was his good will and
pleasure to leave a seed in thee O Englnnd: O return, return, repent, repent,
why will ye dye O house of Israel; Now there are many that desire the day of
the Lord as they call it, the laying down of their flesh in the earth, and they
are yet in their sins, and they think they shall be purified after death, but
there is no remembrance of thee in the pit, Eccles. 11.3.
there is no calling on thee in the grave, for if the tree fall toward the
South, or toward the North, in the place the tree falls it shall lie:
Therefore woe to such that desire the day of the Lord, what have ye to do with
it? Amos 5.18, 19
the day of the Lord is darkness and not light, as if a man did flee from a
Lion and a Bear met him or went into the house and leaned his hand upon the
wall and a Serpent bit him: O therefore you that intend that your souls may
live or enjoy the presence of the Lord, yield up obedience to the pure light of
Christ in the conscience, and return with speedy repentance, for the day of
the Lord it is nere hastes greatly, even the voice of the day of the Lord the
strong man shall there cry bitterly, that day is a day of wrath, and a day of
trouble, and a day of heaviness, and a day of destruction, and a day of
desolation, and a day of obscurity and darkness, Ephesians. 1.14.
a day of clouds and darkness, a day of the Trumpet and alaram against the
strong Cities and the high towers, against those that are strong in their
fleshly wisdom, and high in their earthly imaginations; Jer. 30.7.
for the world by wisdom knows not God, neither indeed can it because it is
spiritually discerned. O England thou have long been led by thy blind guides,
Joel 2.11.
which have told thee that the steeple house is the Church, but they are l ars,
the Church is in God; O turn you, turn you; turn your minds within to the pure
light of Christ in your consciences, that so you may come to witness a
separation between the precious and the vile in you, Cor. 2.14.
so you may come to have the old heart taken away and a new heart given you
that may bring forth the righteous, then shall you come to say with David, thou
have made me wiser then my teachers; there you will come to see the inhabitants
of the Earth houl, These. 11.
and low places of the Earth rore, for the company of Merchants are destroyed,
all they that bear Silver are cut off, so with the light of Christ within you
you may come to witness your Jerusalem searched with his light within you, These.
1.11.
so you may come to see your barren ground to be broken up which has long layn
fallow, in steed of Grapes has brought forth wild Grapes; O England thou have
long lost thy key of knowledge; O now repent and do thy first works, thou wast
created holy but through thy disobedience to the light in thy conscience thou
have been shut out from the presence of the Lord, because thou have not walked
humbly before him: O break up thy fallow ground and sow not amongst thorns, be
circumcised unto the Lord, and take away the foreskin of your hearts, for of
man as he is in his first nature is deceitful above all things, and desperately
wicked, and who can find it out? Therefore now return your minds within and
seek no more the kingdom of Heaven in outward observations, prove your selves
whether you are in the faith, examine your own selves; know ye not that Jesus
Christ is in you except ye be reprobates; therefore now see by that light that
is within you, see who it is rules within you, and come to see whether that
small seed be not buried within you, which lies low, even in the dust; for the
kingdom of Heaven is compared to a small thing, even to a grain of
musterdseed, which is said in the Scripture to be the least of all seeds; now
be ye obedient to this small seed which lies low within you, and therein it
will grow to be the strongest of all seeds, so keeping your minds stayed upon
it, to wait upon the Lord to be guided by his counsel.

Christ, Tho: Wooddrove.
