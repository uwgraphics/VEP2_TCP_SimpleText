The Epistle Dedicatory to His Excellence the Earl of ESSEX.
MAy it please Your Excellence, to accept the affectionated tender of your
humble servant, for why your Noble and Iuditious Honor has still been held a
Patron of the Muses, a Lover of Arts, and Artlike Siences, and all good Arts
ingenious man attaines to; Let not me then despair, though the first dip of my
weak forward Pen ascend unto so high a Dedication, I gently crave it might not
meet refection, because it is my love, if so, it would quite kill my hopes
prepared journey, and that sacred Mount I now am laboring up, fall from't, and
perish, and made a scorn unto the Laurel tree, in my desire to touch it, but
noble Nature mixed with gentill Spirits, ascends like Mirrh unto the saving
Heavens, and gives the same desire to you on earth, from whose favors warmth,
I hope my spring flourish, and these few mixed Poems here in Prose and Verse, he
mildly sensured; and my obedient Service, with my love thought free from
flattery, to whose Noble and Iuditeous sensure I recommend them unto Your
Excellencies view.

And desire to be found, Your Excellencies most humble Servant, William Cook.

The true description of a Noble General: In Prose and Verse.
A Noble General, by the general assent of the high voice of great Authority,
being handed to the Piramide of Honor, over whose top the golden Truucheon,
and the Verdant Wreath, his worthiness as worthily receives, should be just
such a man as has it: In which discretion showed her Masterpiece in calling
such a Pillar of the State to their securer and more State supportance, for as
the lightning cleeres the troubled Air, when hot contagion mixeth amongst the
Clouds, and gives the Earth a healthier temperature: so choosing of a man whose
noble mind in all his actions, was his Names expressor, The peoples loves, in
whose hearts he was wrapped in, chose themselves forth to be his followers,
forsook their wives, their children and their sttates, And when his Drums
beat up old Englands March, and waving Ensigns cut the fleeting Air, Their
Airey spirits backed their mettled steeds. whose hot disdainful pride champing
their burnish't bits, foame snow'd the earth, as scorning it should bare them:
So diligence still waits upon love, And as a General in all his state, the
very Pageant of Collosius war, being heavens great man, should so be heavens
good man, as questionless he is that wears this charge, for when Mars calls
him to his maled throne, and with the Plumes of honor crowns his head,
acquaints him with his whole artillery, shows him the rules and husbandry of
War, brings him through all the cunn^ng laborinthes, tells him his Statutes,
Laws, Edicts and Counsels: with it the Christians Conscience, and the care,
the golden Plummets of the hearts even ballence, where pure integrity from
hearts corrupt, reigns Monarch of the whole Celestial frame, shaping his life
so clean, so white so good, that he defies all stratagems against him, though
hell should for him make a Machivill, whose own hot brain contains the
quintiscence of all that ever from that man^ion leapt: Yet the just Soldier
spurns at him, and that; were all the dangers from the Corners brought, wrapped
up in Whirl-windes, on an Earth quake mounted, and every danger ushered with
new death, according to the nature of each terror? yet all this to the Noble
Martialist, makes not fears breath so strong to shake the smallest hair upon
his head, There is the confidence of honesty, whose Hoaste reigns under his
command, with love: And where his love leads on with good discretion, not
justled by vain glory, thorough the applause of wide-mouthed rumor, popularity
but knows true Martial distance to an Inch, how to bring on with courage and
with care, And with the same care to bring often again, to husband lives to
cheri^^, and repair the ruins that red war makes breaches thorough: not he
that in a tempest hurries men like violent thunder, bursting through the
Clouds to set his Soldiers at a doubtful stake, and at one cast to win or
loose the set to fill the fields with groans of dying men, and City
Hospitalls with halting Criples, making their deaths and maymes his
recreation, and with hosterities overruling sway, com^and the^r Loves
obedience, tho^ough fear to say He this and that did by his Valor, his fame
like terror shouting through the ears of those that gives the names of
Enemies, such Soldiers are, and men of great esteem and praise, though there
be difference in equality: Yet where sweet mildness swayes it is the best, and
shows him most a Gentleman, to whose known deserts, brave worthy Sir, in all
things (sance flattery) I give you but your due.

The same in Verse.
WHo mount will to the top of Golden honor,
And there display bright fame, and fortunes banner,
Must be discreet, and all his Actions such
Envy may tremble his fair Name to touch:
It Is not to say I have been here and there,
In Holland' against the Spaniard or elsewhere;
Where testimony of his valors so,
He took a Town, yet no re struck a blow.
How he was shot in scaling such a Fort.
And how came off, making his pain his sport;
How he was threatened by the States to be
At least an Ensign for his Chevalrie
Such gilded motes, but dance in Soldiers beams,
Whose praise is like a bubble full of Dreams,
To this truths history of man says so,
They wear the name of Soldier but, for show,
But shadows banish, for I now discry
The rising of the Sun, whose glories high
There needs no more addition then thy Name
To get our loves, yet thou have gotten fame,
With it a Title of High Excellence,
Which does so well become thee in my sense,
That it is far more honored in thy wearing,
Then is thy goodness by the Titles bearing:
Great Son of War and Love, put on thy Bays,
Expel Romes Idols, bring home Haltian days,
That thy bright Fame in this Exchange of War.
May ESSEX Name convert into a Star,
And may it to those (...) thee not appear
A Meteor to or'e-whelme their hearts with fear,
By goodness I hate flattery, and yet my love is so,
I must run thus whether I will or no;
I should with Injury abuse thy Worth,
Giving thy High deserts abortive birth,
If I not write my thoughts,
For if all that loves thee could or would thus do,
What volumnes could be dedicate to You:
If it were otherwise Great Sir, be it known,
People have hearts that would not thus be shown,
For two Conditions guides thee, popular state,
Either pure Love, or else deteste^ hate.
Bigg swells the sails where the strong gale blows full,
But a still silence where affections dull;
Honor winnes Fame, either for state or wars,
But he most merrits venters his for scarres.
Boeatus spread not forth her brazen wing.
F^rther then fame, the name of Soldier sing,
Which Name the Tented field bestows on Thee;
The Gule dipped war: and brave Artillery:
The Fife the Drum and shrill Bellonaes noate
Of war (great Captain has given thee the vote,
The Name thy Father had survives in thee,
His Love, His Virtue is thy Legasie.
The Description of Envy.
ENVY, a monster who leapt out of Hell, being a brother of the deadly seven,
can no contentment find upon the earth, for still his agony increases here so
that even the local pit from whence he up ascended, affords him not worse
torment then the earth, the hissing consort of his Snakeweath'd head, shows
him a brother to fell Medusa, who as his charmed power, turns into astone and
on the sudden freezeth flesh and blood into the hardness of a Statue, so would
he blast and sting to death all living goodness, that he knows or hears of:
for if a nature* sweet as the perfume, the heavenly spring breathes ore the
Bryery budds give ^^e sunk eyes of Envy such a visit, how he flings
scorching lightning after it, That had his Power entranoe to his will, he would
melt the very marrow through the bone, so thick his forkt Artillery shes after
it, Let virtue whiter then the Planners path, meek as the Dove and harmless
as the sleep of tender Babes, though all the graces hung like stately lemmes
to deek the outside of this edifice, and the three steps unto eternity, the
outward sign Wart, for the parties knowing, yet what would this avail, o^
ever sweeten bitter envy, gaul, but straight he shootes reproaches after them,
arms, hearts and hands against them like his own, spotting with infamy that
silver roabe, that wore a tincture like the morning light, before Aurora
blushed at Tytans rising springs beauty, with the mixture of those flowers
that ever strove for superiori^y, the spreading Lilly, and the blooming Rose
yet this foul Canker, both il^hew'd and scented, would suck the juice of
Hemlock from the weeds, mixed with the rancour of her own foul lungs, from her
more foul tongue to blast perfection, wearing her eyes so fiery bloodshed with
her indignation, that where she not prevails, she turns that hatred on her
hateful self, and feeds upon her own detested Name, Envy, who from the
breaking of the worlds first day, brought her Consumption even along with her,
still bringing with it, till time make his stop, and all destroying death meet
her destruction. Let honor, whose ever grafted flock sprung forth such
branches, be possessed with Natures whole en^rease assisted with the adition of
rich Arts be his Helm, steered by the highest hand, and all his Actions
leavyed by a line squared out of the hand of equity, stand he betwixt the
Compasses two points, supported by the Gospel and the Law, were his deserts by
highest powers compeelld to advance up to the Alps of State, plumed Honor,
were he Commander of more lives then hair^s, and had of every life a care, as
great as the preserving of those blood-branch'd Veins, that issue from the
crimson Conduit-head, the bodies fountain, where the thoughts sit crowned, even
his own heart, yet Envy would spit at him, and muster up ill thoughts to fight
against him, contempts, ^eproaches, infamies and scorns, Though goodness
dwells at the sign of greatness, and heavens white finger point him out a
man of Saint-like disposi^ion and of sufferance, a smiler on his injuries with
forgiveness, whose inward ^oncave is a school of pity, the Master good
Discretion, and his hands both ^word and Balance swayes, Justice with equity,
yet all this with his whole ^ife guard of heart-loving friends, such as would
emptey all their veins dry from him, and call new life to as^ist t^em (had
they power) can make no bullworke to keep Envy out, but he will call his
Council up against him. the ^wift-wing'd malice armed with lasting hate, with
all the Synod of Anatomies whose Skellitons of skin-o're-covering bones can
wear no flesh, but bloods, their nourishment. Authority and power his hate
pursues, grinnes at the pomp and state of Potent Kings, derides all Scepters,
Rule or Covernment, and most ^p^ene belcheth where there is least cause, yet
seldom dares this Caniball be seen, he is of so base a coward disposition, but
lurkes in corners* where he may obscured reign over his disturbed self alone
Monarch of fretts, of self-devouring hate, if factions seed he sowes, brings
forth no fruit, so that of all envies the poorest, and paies himself worst
wages, is basest of all evils, and most despised by goodness.

The same in Verse.
Swell Envy till thou burst: a good man's fence
Dare stand thy power and Hell with Innosence,
I sit above thy Ire, let all thy spleen
Po^son thy arrows, make thy point so keen,
That fortitude nor Fates fell hand,
Can ward or Check the power of thy command.
What pity Lewdness shows thy hell-borne mind,
To be so very brainelesly inclinde,
To war against thy self: for wise men knows.
Thou often strikst, but oftener feelst the blows.
Thou art ever poor ever unfortunate,
Nay, be it then, when thou triumphst in state,
Having thy ends: Here Is that the world will say,
It Was Envy did it, give the dog his day.
Thou dare not look the bold man in the face,
But Sculk in corners with thy actions base,
And there in secret fight against his Name;
Wounding his credit, and his worth defame
Where still the Noble is, thy base aspect
Foames out thy venom, and does hate direct
To poison the clear spring, for Envy still
Forsakes the valleys, and climbes up the hill;
Shru^bs he regards not, it is the Cedar tree,
Heel either shake, or scorch with infamis:
The low grounds lie secure, the mountain top,
The stormy clouds does up in tempest wrap,
Hell is all envy, yet nor them nor thee,
With all their fiery L^gions can blast thee.
Fix Pelion and Ossa, on whose high top,
Once more let envy into hell down drop,
Blow him about in winds, or let blue fire;
Pay Envy for his envy, Hells hot fire
Take him from amongst us, for it is he
With Englands blood, writ Englands tragedy;
Sink him for ever to the depth of Bisse,
For robbing us of our firm peaceful bliss;
O once again may the fair Olive tree,
The Parliament untte vith Majesty:
His Majesty with them, that broils may cease,
And welcome England to her former Peace;
That Romes high Babell, with her triple Crown,
May fall to raise the Protestants renown,
That envy ever may forsake this Glime,
And each man live under his f^uitfull Vine.
^INIS.
