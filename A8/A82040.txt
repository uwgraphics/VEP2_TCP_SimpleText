The Declaration of the Protestant Army in the Province of Mounster.
WE have formerly testified unto the World by our constant sufferings in this
Cause, and sedulous endeavors in the service, how firmly we stood devoted to
the obedience of the KING and Parliament in the prosecution of the Common
Enemy, against whom, the several successes wherewith our weak Attempts have
been seconded, has as well testified the divine Providence over us, as
attracted the approbation of men upon our actions, until a growing party of
Independency sprung up in the Houses and Army; who finding an unaptnesse in us
to receive the impression of their designs, have on that consideration
contrived our subversion. In order whereunto they had no sooner prevailed to
place the Lord Lisle in the Lieutenancy of this Kingdom, but in short time
there was advanced 180000. pound for the service thereof; a sum so
considerable, that had it been effectually employed to the use whereunto it was
designed, might have reduced most of this Kingdom to Obedience; but 10.
Months of 12. being spent on Preparations, and the moneys detained, lest it
should come to our unconfiding hands, whilst our Soldiers starved in the
streets; the Lord Lisle in February 1646. arrives with 25000. l. of the
aforesaid sum, which, with the whole Contribution of the Country was
exhausted in eight weeks space, 5000. l. in money, and a few provisions only
excepted; the only services performed by the expense of so much treasure were
the taking of Cork, Kinsale' and Youghall out of those hands who had long and
faithfully held them for the service of the KING and Parliament, and placing in
them confidents of their own, to secure unto themselves their own resolutions,
which were so fixed upon the suppression of both KING and Parliament, as that
they endeavored to postpone a Commission (from both) under the true broad
Seal of England to a paper-warrant of their own, and howbeit to give
Countenance and enforce obedience to that new contrived Authority they had
drawn the head Garrison into Arms, laden their Muskets with Powder and Ball,
shut up the Ports and drawn in part of the Lord Brohels Regiment of Horse to
the Lord Presidents door, yet finding the Officers generally (a few
particularly obliged persons only excepted) to adhere unto the Parliaments
authority in the Lord Presidents person, and nothing moved with their
apparition of force, they desisted from further prosecution of that design,
and departed the Kingdom, giving testimony of the good affections they had for
the service thereof upon their landing, by laboring to foment a Petition
amongst the Horse Forces then lying ready at the waterside to imbarke for this
Province, whereby they desired to decline this Service, unless under the
command of some of their Faction. But that (with many other) provoking too
weak a practice to accelerate our ruin, they labor to retard or divert all
Supplies for the carrying on this War; For the better accomplishing whereof it
has been suggested; That the wants of this Army are not so great as they are
frequently represented, but that here is a competency upon the place to support
us; though to take away that supposition (being of somewhat a long standing) it
has been often most earnestly desired that a Committee might be sent over to
improve whatsoever may arise upon the place, and dispose of what shall be
transmitted thence: But as there is a suggested sufficiency of means, so there
is a supposed deficiency in the Officers which must give ground to deteine all
supplies, till they can be sent by such as have sufficient prejudice to this
Army. As a practice to this purpose we must necessarily look upon the
endeavor used by some Independents, to take off the Reputation of our late
Engagements with the Rebels at Knocknonosse, calling it (on the open Exchange)
a Project to draw on the Adventurers (then convening to advance moneys for our
relief) and for the greater disparagement of the action, substracting from the
numbers of the Rebels, both alive and slain, lest the considerablenesse of the
Service should induce any proportionable relief, which the Houses did not with
more alacrity grant, then others labored to retard; It could not otherwise be
that of 10000. l. Voted so long since, and re-Voted on the advertisement of
that action, there should be only 2500. l. advanced and remitted, or that of
the Ordinance for 20000. l. per Men's. Voted four months since, and to continue
but for six. We should yet find no effect, the passing of which Ordinance did
not more comfort us with the contemplation of a settled competency, then with an
expectation that the leavies made for us distinguished from any mitxure with
other taxations, would come clearly and entirely to us without the accustomed
misapplication, whereby the relief of Ireland was made but a stale to collect
great sums by for other uses; It being generally observeable, and many of us
eyewitnesses thereof, that the Impositions laid in City and Country for the
relief of this distressed Kingdom, were paid in with the greatest alacrity and
readiness of any other taxes, which occasioned the name of our relief to be
inter woven in all assessements.

We doubt not but many will be ready to object an impossibility that any man
can be so unchristian to obstruct or divert the supplies of this bleeding
Kingdom, to the support whereof all so highly pretend; And yet the detaining
most part of the train of Artillery with its Carriages and Utencils, for which
the Lord Lisles account stands charged with above 12000. l. and for
transporting whereof 1000. was imprested to Sir John Veale, could not hate
passed with impunity if some did not contrive the retarding the work of
Ireland; The reproachful usage of those Gentlemen who in Conformity to the
Ordinance of Parliament disbanded and subscribed for the service of Ireland;
The suffering of many men desirous to come for Ireland to lie upon free quarter
in the West, till they had eaten as much as would have maintained them here a
twelvemoneth, and were at last disbanded; The strict course taken (by the
interposition of some particular persons) to deprive us of all hope of relief
from the shipping, by reprizals taken at Sea upon our Coasts and even in our
Harbours-mouthes (an expedient that has formerly often preserved us in our
greatest Exigencies) savoureth of no mean endeavors to retard the relief of
Ireland; And the words of a powerful Member of the Army, to a late servant of
the Lord Lisles declaring our starving condition for want of food and raiment,
( That if we in Munster were not poor enough, they would make us so) have been
in a great measure verified; But we do the less wonder that it should be their
endeavor to make us so, when we consider the arguments raised by Col: Lambert
and others of the Army, against the Justice and lawfulness of this War on our
parts, and justifying the actions of the Rebels; It having been avouched to
some of our Faces, that the English interest were better in the hands of the
Rebels then in ours; And there has not been wanting those of the Lord Lisles
own retinue, who have openly professed that they made no distinction betwixt
the Rebels and those of the Protestant party, which they found upon the place,
his Lordships domestique Chappellane at the same time diffusing words of the
same sense in the Pulpit, whiles other Orthodox Divines were not admitted to
preach. But we shall sum up all their practices to obstruct our relief, in
this one instance of their late seizure upon the moneys brought in upon the
Ordinance of 20000. l. per Men's. and taking the same out of the hands of our
Treasurers; so as that it may be feared, That to have the War finished here
before the perfection of their designs in England, would prove to them the
greatest dis-satisfaction in the world, by means whereof many of our poor
Soldiers have been aready swept into a miserable miserable Grave; for whose
lives, as these men stand justly accomptable, so will it be difficult for them
to be freed of the guilt of all that blood which has been shed in the service,
which, but for their practices had been long ago foreclosed.

And yet their confidence is remarkable; for though these things have been
visibly practiced in our eyes, yet we find the cry raised aloud against the
KING, the eleven Members involving the Lord President for obstructing the war
of Ireland; and the Independents putting on as sober countenances, as if their
hands were innocent of our blood, and that it were just that they should pass
by plausibly unblameable; And for this end they make that Criminal in some,
that they allow to be commendable in others; If we importune Relief, declare
against Innovations in Government, profess a readiness to serve and obey the
Parliament, we must at least sue forth an Act of Indemnity, and it is held for
a special lenity that two of our Officers were not executed on that score; But
if the Army in England refuse to disband at the appointment of an Ordinance of
Parliament, or to obey the major Votes of the Houses, and march up to the City
of London with Banners displayed, it shall not only be approved, but made
penal to us, or any other that dare mention it with dislike, though as being
Englishmen and Subjects, we esteem our interest and propriety in the Law of
the Land, and liberty of the Subject proportionably as good as theirs.

Though these their private practices were sufficiently notorious unto us, yet
we were resolved to struggle with all difficulties, and to maintain the
Protestant interest in these parts successively to the last man, rather then by
any Cessation with the Irish, or otherwise to give a jealousy of forfeiting
the least trust which was imposed in us by that authority which imlpoyed us
hither; while they continued in the Government we would not decline our
obedience for the greatest hardships; But now at last discovering the
Resolutions of our Adversaries to cast off all obligations both to KING and
Parliament, rather then to fail in their intendments, We conceive we are
obliged by the Law of God and of the Kingdom not to assent unto their
requirements whom Power, not Justice has seated in those places of Authority;
It is, and was ever a main Principle whereon all our Resolutions were grounded
to contend for the safety of His MAJESTY'S Person and Prerogative, for the
freedom and privilege of Parliament, and liberty of the Subject, as they were
interwoven and had a clear and mutual Dependency each upon other: And it was
long before we could entertain any suspicion of a design to engage us
further, until the practice of the Independents party grew more obnoxious, and
that we saw His MAJESTY in effect deposed, made Prisoner to the closest
confinement: The freedom of the Parliament highly invaded, and their
inclination and assent to a personal Treaty with His MAJESTY (the only
expedient of a happy Peace) made frustrate by the over-powering awe of the
Army; the Liberty of the Subject, and Propriety of Interest totally suppressed,
and all other the genuine Immunities of that once glorious Nation, made
arbitrary at the pleasure and determination of the Armies dictations: And
though while these things were in our eye and observation, we had still quiet
desires of sitting silent, and intent upon our own engagement here, and the
Prosecution and conduct of our charge in this Kingdom, yet we came at last to
discern, that if we would no be involved and engaged in the same practices
with those who were resolved to trample under foot, the subject matter of our
National League, that we should be made partakers of their ruin, whom he had
sworn to support; of which besides other evidences, we had that signal
Testimony of the Vice-Admiralls demand (in this Armies absence in the field) of
certain persons committed to close custody for contriving the Armies ruin, of
his blocking up our Harbors thereupon, and meanacing us with a Declaration of
being enemies to the State, and with the access of great Powers to suppress
and suddenly swallow us up (though nothing considerable in twelve months space
came to support the war against the Rebels) unless we did declare for those
who acted contrary to our and their own engagements, of seducing and
encouraging our fugitive and mutinous Soldiers abroad, for the accomplishing
the most wicked end of necessitating us, to submit to famine or Cessation with
the Irish: All which we could not imagine he would presume to act, without
direction and authority from that part of the Parliament which is soly guided
by the pleasure of the Army, (for the doing whereof he now avoucheth Authority
at the same time, that the Committee at Derby house assures us of the Houses
confidence in our integrity;) And did therefore esteem it absolutely
necessary, at a general Rendezvous upon our return out of the field, to
declare and manifest our Intentions and Resolutions to the Soldiery, as well
to give them a clear understanding of our intendments, as to confirm them
against the practices of seducers, against whose charms we resolve to arm our
selves with these ensuing resolutions. That we will not be involved by Consent
or Cooperation in any Actions which shall tend to the violation of our public
engagements to the KING and Parliament, nor prostrate our selves to a
misguidance with those, who (with grief of heart) we observe to be under the
coercive inforcement of the Independent Power, from which, as we shall labor
to restore them to their proper freedom, so we shall not during their
continuance under these Pressures, esteem our selves obliged to the Observance
of any Injunctions, which by the usurped Authority of the Independents they
shall labor to lay upon us, under the Notion of Parliament, but the ensuing
Protestation do declare,

First, to improve our utmost endeavors for the Settlement of the Protestant
Religion according to the example of the best Reformed Churches.

Secondly, to defend the KING in his Prerogatives.

Thirdly, to maintain the Privileges and freedom of the Parliament and the
Liberty of the Subject.

And that in Order hereunto we shall oppose to the hazard of our lives, those
Rebels of this Kingdom, who shall refuse their Obedience to His MAJESTY upon
what terms soever He shall think fit to require it.

And we shall endeavor to the utmost the suppressing of that Independent
Party, who have thus fiercely labored the Extirpation of the true Protestant
Religion, the ruin of our PRINCE, the dishonor of our Parliament, and the
Vassalidg of our Fellow Subjects, against all those who shall depend upon them,
or adhere unto them.

And (that this our undertaking might not appear obnoxious to the trade of
England, but that we desire a firm union and agreement be preserved betwixt
us) We do likewise declare, that we will continue free traffic and commerce
with all His MAJESTY'S good Subjects of England: And that we will not in the
least manner prejudice any of them that shall have recourse to our Harbors,
either in their bodies, ships, or goods, nor shall we take any thing from them
without payment of ready money for the same.

It may happily be judged by some, as an act of Imprudence, that we should take
this unseasonable time for this Remonstrance, wherein the KING Himself is in
confinement, His Party nothing; the moderate party of the Houses (or most of
them) either in retirement or banishment for the preservation of their lives,
and only those in power and authority against whose proceedings we make this
our public Protestation: All which we cannot but with much sorrow acknowledge
to be too true, and that these inconveniences are to be resisted, but not
avoided: Had we been ascertained heretofore, that their intentions were (as now
we find them) to introduce an Anarchy upon us, and by the destruction of the
Fundamentalls of these Kingdoms to advance a Government of their own
Imaginations: We had long ere this time approved our duty to KING and Country
by opposing them; which in all probability we might have done upon more
advantageous terms, both to our persons and undertakings, had we not been
drawn on in an expectation of a fair composure of all differences as not able
to discern (beyond suspicion) the clear drift of their designs through those
various pretenses which they put upon them, till they had gained the whole
power of the Kingdom into their hands: Yet these difficulties must not be
admitted into the balance with Honesty; Though it may not come within the
compass of our abilities to serve our KING and Country as we would, (which we
shall never decline upon the least occasion) yet we desire to approve our
integrities to both, by this manifest of our Resolution.
