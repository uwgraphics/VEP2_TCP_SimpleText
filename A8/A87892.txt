A Necessary and Seasonable Caution, concerning Elections.
THe miserable dissettlement of this Nation, arising principally from Abuse of
Trust, practiced by those Persons, whom we chose to Represent the People; it
concerns us now at last, to provide warily against future Inconveniences, by a
more diligent Examination, and Knowledge of those we elect for the time to
come. We find the Nation Impoverished; the Government both of Church and State
dissolved; and all the Supports of a Public Magistracy devoured, by those
very people, who instead of Freeing us from small and few miscariages, have
notoriously exercised over us (themselves) the greatest oppressions Imaginable.
For prevention of the like evils hereafter, we are to be very wary how we
chose; -- 1. Such Persons as Preach without a Call, and deliver the Delusions
of Satan, for the Inspirations of the Holy Spirit; (We may know the Tree by its
Fruits.) 2. Such as either out of Fear, or Interest, Sacrifice the Public
Good to Passion, or Benefit, shifting from Party, to Party; This Day, for the
King and Parliament; the next, Pensioners to the Protector; the Third for the
Rump; the Fourth, for any thing that comes next. Under this notion, I comprize
such as make use of a Parliament-Privilege to elude Creditours, to detain
ill-gotten Possessions, and to put themselves out of the Reach of the Law;
thereby hindering the due course of Proceedings against them. 3. And lastly,
take heed of choosing any Persons that have already falsified their Trust, --
by engaging in Illegal Close Committees: -- In any Relation whatsoever of
Malice toward the Late King -- in Purchasers, or Sellers of the Public
Revenues: -- In Usurped Impositions upon the People. In short, such, as have at
the Price of an Universal Ruin, enriched themselves; and laid the Foundations
of their New Babel, in Sacrilege, Perjury, Murder, and Treason.


This may suffice for a Caution to all such, as are not resolved upon Beggary,
and Bondage.
