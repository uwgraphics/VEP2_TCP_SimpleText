EDW. NORGATE,



Printed at OXFORD, January 30. By LEONARD LICHFIELD, Printer to the
University. 1643.

My Lord,
HIS Majesty having by His Proclamation of the 22. of December (upon the
occasion of the Invasion threatened, and in part begun by some of His Subjects
of Scotland) summoned all the Members of both Houses of Parliament to attend
Him here at Oxford: We whose names are under written are here met and assembled
in obedience to those His Majesty's commands. His Majesty was pleased to invite
us in the said Proclamation by these gracious expressions; [That His Subjects
should see how willing he was to receive advice for the preservation of the
Religion, Laws and safety of the Kingdom, and as far as in Him lay to
restore it to it is former Peace and security, (His chief and only end) from
those whom they had trusted, though he could not receive it, in the place where
He appointed.] This most gracious invitation has not only been made good unto
us, but seconded and heightened by such unquestionable demonstrations of the
deep and Princely sense which possesses His Royal heart of the miseries and
calamities of His poor Subject in this unnatural War, and of His most
entire and passionate affections, to redeem them from that sad and deplorable
condition, by all ways possibly consistent either with His Honor, or with the
future safety of the Kingdom, that, as it were impiety to question the
sincerity of them, so were it great want of duty and faithfulness in us, (His
Majesty having vouchsafed to declare, that He did call us to be witnesses of
His actions, and privy to His intentions) should we not testify and witness
to all the world, the assurance we have of the piety and sincerity of Both; We
being most entirely satisfied of this truth, We cannot but confess, that,
amidst Our highest afflictions in the deep and piercing sense of the presents
miseries and desolations of our Country, and those further dangers threatened
from Scotland, We are at length errected to some cheerful and comfortable
thoughts, that possibly we may yet (by Gods mercy, if his justice have not
determined this Nation for it is sins, to total ruin and desolation) hope to
be happy Instruments of our Countries redemption, from the miseries of War,
and restitution to the blessings of peace, And We being desirous to believe
your Lordsships (howsoever engaged) a person likely to be sensibly touched with
these considerations, have thought fit to invite you that part in this blessed
work, which is only capable to repair all our misfortunes, and to boy up the
Kingdom from rune; That is, by coujuring you, by all the obligations that have
power upon Honor, Conscience, or public Piety, that laying to heart, as we
do the inwardly bleeding condition of your Country, and the outward more
menacing destruction by a foreign Nation, upon the very point of invading it,
you will cooperat^ with us to it is preservation, by truly representina to, an^
faithfully and industriously promoving with those by whom you are trusted, this
following most sincere and most earnest desire of ours; That they joining with
us in a right sense of the past, present, and more threatening calamities of
this deplorable Kingdom, some persons be appointed on either part, and a place
agreed on, to treat of such a Peace, as may yet redeem it from the brinke of
desolation.

This address we should not have made, but that His Majesty's summons by which
we are met, most graciously proclaiming pardon to all without exception, is
evidence enough, that his mercy and clemency can transcend all former
provocations, and that He has not only made us witnesses of his Princely
Intentions, but honored us also with the name of being security for them.

God Almighty direct your Lordship, and those to whom you shall present these
our most roall desires, in such a course as may produce that happy Peace and
settlement of the present distractions, which is so heartily desired and prayed
for by us, and which may make us.

From Oxford the 27. January, 1643. Your affectionate Friends.
