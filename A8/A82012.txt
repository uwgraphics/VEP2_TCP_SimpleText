Certain GODLY RVLES Concerning Christian Practice.
1 EVery morning so soon as thou awakest, Psalm. 63.45.6.
remember the Lord early in thy bed, and let thy Soul send by the wing of
Faith, a thanksgiving as the first fruit of the morning: let this be done upon
the instant of thy waking, Pal. 50.23. 1 Samuel 2.30.
before thy soul be stained with sin: See therefore thou observe and do
this: For them that honor me, I wi^^ honor says the Lord.

2 Being now risen out of thy bed, make haste to offer unto God thy morning
sacrifice of Prayer, and thanksgiving (with this care that no one of thy family
be wanting.) In which Sacrifice remember thou give hearty thanks to God for all
his mercies and benefits bestowed on thee, 1 These. 5.
whether Spiritual or Temporal, and forget not to be thankful for thy late
preservation this night past: and making an humble confession of all thy
sins, see thou sorrow for them: and if thou can not sorrow, be troubled
then in spirit with grief, because thou can not mourn. Heb. 10.22.
And after an earnest desire of pardon, ask those necessaries fervently, which
are requisite either for thy soul or body; as also desire a blessing upon thy
labors the day following. And having made an end of this thy duty, see thou
rise up in the assurance of Faith, that God for his Christ's sake has a^^^pted
of thy sacrifices, and has put away all thine offenses: stand then, and hold
thee still by Faith, For without Faith, Heb. 11.6.
it is impossible to please God.

3 In what place soever thou art, be fully persuaded in thy mind, Ier. 23.24
Pro. 15.3. 2 Cor. 2.17.
that thou art in the presence of the living God: let the remembrance hereof
work in thee reverence to his Majesty, love to his Children, Act. 13.33
and fear of offending.

4 Make conscience of idle, vain, Deuteronomy. 4.12 Ier. 4.14. Mar. 7.21.22.23.
unhonest, and ungodly thoughts: for these are the roots whence sin has its
first being, for which cause suffer not these to grow in the garden of thy
souls Paradise, but speedily pluck them forth, that so God may delight to rest
and walk in thee not only at Even-tide, Genesis 6.5.6.7
but all the days of thy life: See therefore no care be lacking to prevent
sin before it come to action: for wicked thoughts were a cause, that the
wrath of God came upon the children of disobedience.

5 Be fully persuaded in mind that thy present estate is best for thee, Luke
12.22.23.24.
whether prosperity or adversity whether poor or rich, because it is of the
good providence of God, and without his will nothing befalls his children,
let this be the staff of thy soul, lean thou still on the Lord by Faith. Mat.
10.29.30.31. Heb. 13.5, 6.
For he has said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.

6 put away jesting, Ephesians. 5.4.
with foolish talking, remembering this thou keep thy tongue from evil, and thy
lips, Psalm. 34.12.13. Prove. 10.19. and 17.27. and 18.21. James 3.
that they speak no guile, for in many words there cannot want sin;
therefore to refrain is discretion: and when thou speak, to speak the truth
is wisdom, for death and life are in the power of the tongue* and they that
love it shall eat the fruit thereof; Matt. 12.36.
for by thy words thou shall be justified, and by thy words thou shall be
condemned.

7 Endeavor to have fervent love* for the gift thereof is sweet, 1 Pet. 4.8. 1
John 4.7.8.
it covers a multitude of sins: for this cause love thine enemy, Mat.
5.43.44.45. R^m. 12.14.17.18.19.20.21.
for so thou art commanded, and if he worng thee, wrong not thy self by
revenging, (for it is written, Vengeance is mine, and I will repay says the
Lord: learn therefore and observe that to hurt thiue enemy is to do him good,
and in so doing thou shall heap coals of fire upon his head: Be not therefore
overcome of evil, but overcome evil with goodness.

8 Take head of Anger, Eccle. 28.12.
for if ^auseth strife: a soft answer appeaseth wrath: For as a fire (man's
nature if thou blow it it will kindle, Prove. 14.29.
but if thou spit on it, it shall be quenched: but if patien^^^ ^anting, this
fire will ^^a^ (...) ^eek peace then with all men, if possibly thou can for
change of words gendreth strife: therefore silence as water) is fittest for
this heat: for note the wrath of man does not accomplish the righteousness of
God,

9 To do good and to distribute forget not, Heb. 13.16.
for with such sacrifice God is well pleased. Wherefore stop not thine ear at
the cry of the poor, Romans 12.13.
lest thou likewise cry, and God will not hear, and when thou do good
remember this, Pro. 21.13. Pro. 17.5.
use no discomfortable words, neither railing speeches (as the manner of some
is:) for judge ye, is not a good word more acceptable then a great gist? Eccle.
18.14.16.17.
and a gracious man gives them both, but a fool reproves charlishly
forgetting this whatsoever you would that men should do to you, even so do ye
to them, for this, is the Law and the Prophets. Mat. 7.12.


10 Se^ ^^^t in word and convarsation of life thou become a president for
others to imitate; Pro. 15.16
let this be done without hypocrisy, and forget not in all things to keep a
good conscience, Psalm. 3.37
for this will bring a man peace at the last.

11 Practice in thy life true humility, 1 Pet. 5.5.
for God resists the proud and gives grace to the humble. Iam. 1.16.17.
For what have we which we have not received? Oh what is dust that we should be
proud? Learn therefore meeknes by the example of our Savior Christ, Phil.
2.7.8. Mar. 11 29.
who though he were God, yet took he upon him the shape of a Servant, in which
form he said learn ye of me that I am meek and lowly in heart.

12 If at any time a good motion do rise in thy mind suffer it not to go forth
unblowed, Rev. 3.20. Cant. 5.4.5.9. 2 Cor. 3.5. 1 These. 5.19.
but cherish it either by reading meditating or praying, for this is a spark of
Gods grace now the means to make this spark become a fire, is chiefly Prayer.

13 Whenever thou fallest into a sin, Ephesians. 4.26.27. Heb. 3.12.13.14.
speedily recover thy self again by repentance, and lie not therein with the
dead, but rise again by Faith in Christ as being alive to God.

14 Whatsoever thou take in hand remember thine end so shall thou never do
amiss, Eccle. 7.36. Deuteronomy. 32.29.
if at all times thou esteem the day of thy life, as the day of thy death: for
there is nothing so certain as it, Psalm. 39.4.
and there is nothing so uncertain as the time of it: Mar. 13.35.36.
be therefore sober and watching, that Christ at his coming may find thee
waking: and for thy better watch let this sound be always in thine ears:
Arise ye dead, and come forth to Judgment.

15 So spend the Sabbath all thy life, Exodus 20.8. and 31.14.15.16.17. and
35.2.3.
that thy soul at death may rest in bliss: no work therein see thou do save
works of honor approved by that day as to feed the hungry, Mat. 25.34.35.36.
Ier. 4.14.
cloth the naked, visit the sick, comfort the afflicted: do this, and thy
Soul shall live. Have a care thou taste from sin, for holiness becomes the
Day, as well in thoughts as in word, as well in word as in action, Ier. 17.21
22.23.
and think it not enough that your self can do thus, but also have a care
that your Family be like minded, Neh. 13.15.16.17.18.19.
together hear the word with reverence, pray publicly and privately, spend
the day in holy conference: and let thy soul swim in heavenly meditations;
so shall thou never be alone, for God is with thee

16 The night being come, Prove. 28.13.14.
call thy self to an account, how thou have spent the day past, thy misdoing
repent with this resolution in thy self to spend the ramainder of thy life
after a better manner, and with a better conscience) then heretofore thou have
done: let this be the whole course of thy life, and forget not to be thankful
to God for those good duties, which by his assistance thou have performed the
day past.

17 Sleep not at night, before thou have commended thy self (and thy whole
Family) by prayer into the hands of God, and that not lazily upon thy bed, (as
the manner of some is:) But humble thou thy Soul before the Lord, kneling
meekly on thy knees, having our Savior Christ for an example, Mat. 26.39.
that not only in this, but in all things else we may be found followers of
him) for what know thou (if being fallen asleep) whether ever thou shall
rise again to life or not? Eccle. 11.3.9. and 12.14.14.
take heed therefore, for as the tree falls, so it lies; as death leads
thee, so shall judgment find thee.

18 Walk as the Children of light, Ephesians. 5.8.
and pass the time of your dwelling here in fear, 1 Pet. 1.17. 2 Pet. 3.10.11.
knowing that the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in the
which the heavens shall pass away with a noise, and the Element shall melt
with heat, and the earth with the works therein, shall be burnt up. Mar. 24.42.
Seeing therefore that all these things must be dissolved, what manner of
persons ought we to be in holy conversation and godliness? Mar. 13.33.
For we know not the time neither the hour when our Lord will come: be ye
therefore sober: Watch and pray, (and blessed is that Servant whom his Master
at his coming, Mar. 24.46. and 13 47.
shall find so doing) now those things that I say unto you, I say unto all men,
Watch.
