TRUE IVDGEMENT, OR, The Spiritual-Man Judging all THINGS, But he himself
Judged of NO MAN.

To them who are growing up into discerning and Judgment: And to them, who
cannot endure sound Judgment.

TRUE IVDGEMENT, OR THE Spiritual-man Judging all THINGS: But He himself Judged
of no MAN.
I Am moved to write forth a few things for the simple ones sake, who are
growing up in Judgment, and the light is springing, by which they do see; to
the staying their minds upon the living God, to the intent they may look into
the world, who are ignorant of the Letter, the Prophets, Apostles, and Christ's
condition; showing themselves to be in the generation from God, which the
Apostles spoke against, and Christ.

First, You show your selves that you cannot endure sound doctrine, in telling
you where you are, and what you are, what you hold up, and what you worship.

Secondly, You show your selves to be those that have not salt to savor
withal; and he that has not salt to savor withal, is good for nothing, but
to be trodden under foot of men.

Thirdly, You are amongst those false Prophets, and Priests, that bear rule by
their Means, and prophecy for money; which speak smooth things, and sow
pillows under your Arm-holes; who speak a Divination of their own brain, and
not from the mouth of the Lord: The Lord sent his Prophets to distinguish and
judge, to put a difference betwixt the holy, and profane, betwixt the precious
and the vile.

Fourthly, You are amongst them that seek for their gain from their quarter,
and spend your money for that which is not bread; so call evil good, and good
evil; and put light for darkness, and darkness for light; such were in their
generation formerly, such are in your generation now, in nature; so you are
lofty and haughty, and do oppress the Innocent and Just: here the Prophet, and
Prophets, were able to judge, to make a difference between the precious and the
vile, the clean and the unclean; and said, this is the man whom the Lord
regards, who is of an humble and broken heart, and trembles at my word; here
is true Judgment: and the same Prophet said, all the children of the Lord, are
taught of the Lord, and established in righteousness, which the Prophets of the
world deny.

Fifthly, You are amongst such, and follow such as seek for the Fleece, who
make a prey upon you, and cloth themselves with the wool, and are wandering
abroad in the cloudy and dark day: the Lord sent the Son of man, which was the
Prophet to Judge them, Judge them a Son of man, who was to put a difference
between the holy and profane.

Sixthly, You are amongst them, and follow such as are Hirelings, which the
Lord sent his Prophets to cry against, who bite with their teeth, and cry
peace, peace, if you put into their mouths; if not, they prepare war against
you, as you may see by your Teachers.

Seventhly, You are such as hold up the Idols Temple, in the outward, which the
Lord sent his Prophet Hosea to cry against; so you have many fenced Cities, but
the Lord will send a fire to consume them; here was a savor and discerning of
them, who had forgot the Lord; then they builded Temples: here was true
Judgment upon them that had backslided and forsaken the Lord God; do not think
your selves wiser in your generation then your forefathers, but sottisher, as
the Prophet says, Sottish children.

Eighthly, You are amongst them, and follow such Prophets as walk out of the
commands of God; as I shall make it appear hereafter, whose blessings are
cursed, whose seed is corrupt; the Lord will spread dung upon their faces, who
call the proud happy, and in this generation you are Priests and People; he had
true Judgment that Judged this; and discerning and salt, who spoke of a people
that feared the Lord, and thought upon his Name, and met often together, and
they shall be mine says the Lord, in that day that I make up my Jewels: And
this we witness to be true, as the Scripture speaks: And you are in that
condition, holding up the Songs of the Temple, which the Lord sent Amos to cry
against, saying, that their songs should be turned into howling; and of all
their unjust dealings, who when he was questioned what he was, he said he was a
Heardsman; such an one now would be an abomination to you, he had a spirit of
discerning.

Ninthly, You are amongst them, and hold such up as are called of men Masters,
stand praying in the Synagogues, love salutations in the Markets; which lay
heavy burdens upon the people, and devour widows houses with a pretense, making
long prayers; which our Lord Jesus Christ forbad and denied, and cried woe
against. And this spoke he to the multitude, and to his Disciples, and bid them
beware of the Scribes, and Pharisees, and their doctrine; and yet you profess
Christ, and make him your cloak, and yet you hold up the doctrine of the
Pharisees, which Christ cried woe against; showing your selves to be in that
generation which persecute the Truth, as they did.

Tenthly, You are in that nature that they were in that stoned Stephen to
death; when he came to be examined before the Priests, they said he spoke
against the holy Temple, and the Law; and when he denied the Temple, and showed
the figures they lived in, they run and gnashed upon him with their teeth, and
stoned him to death; you have made it openly appear in England, in diverse
places, in halling out of your Temples, and stoning, and striking; bunching,
beating, and imprisoning, but the mighty power of the mighty God preserves his
Lambs from blood suckers, and this blood-thirsty generation a seed of evil
doers.

Now do not call this r^sh Judgment, its Scripture language, you are amongst
them that run after Balaam, and go in the way of Cain, who erred from the
Truth, and he that erred from the Truth, lived in envy (so do you still) who
sought to murder the righteous where ever it was brought forth, as your
generation does which has erred from the truth, in the way of Cain, to murder
and destroy the righteous where its brought forth, who walks out of the
commands of God and the Prophets; here they had savor and true Judgment, and
salt in themselves; and did exhort to true Judgment, and to have salt in
themselves, to savor withal; the false Prophets, the false Apostles, the
Antichrists, they have not a discerning, they have not a savor, and do not
speak from the mouth of the Lord; But the true Prophets, Apostles, and Christ,
these had all savor and discerning, to Judge between light and darkness, truth
from evil, as they grew up in the truth, and measure; and they saw who was the
beast, which all the world wonders after, and who had their names written in
the book of life; here was Judgment and distinguishing, which the false
Prophets had not, nor have not now; they knew election, reprobation, and
condemnation, which none of the false Prophets of the world knew; and they saw
who was without the truth, and some they called beasts, some dogs, and some
they called swine, some wolves, some they called Lions, some as fed horses,
neighing after their lusts, and neighbors wives, some as wild Asses, snuffing
up their noses in the Air, some as tall Cedars, some as strong Oaks, some as
fat Bulls, some full of poison, some a generation of vipers (yet such would
confess Abraham) and some as deaf adders; some are called the children of the
devil; they are called the children of the devil, which are not the children
of God, and all these natures are amongst you, you cannot deny it, in your
generations, which holds up the outward worship, Priests and People,
Professors, Rulers, and Magistrates, so called. Now do not call this railing,
its Scripture language, given forth by the eternal spirit, true figures upon
that nature, and generation which was from God, having an eternal Judgment:
Now to call a dog a Lamb, it were a lie; and to call a horse a sheep, were a
lie; or to call a serpent a dove, were a lie; but the true servants of God had
true Judgment and discerning, to speak these names in their places, to its
nature; but you in your generation, give these names upon them which are in the
same nature that gave them forth, for that is false Judgment, which cannot
abide reproof, nor sound doctrine: God is come, and coming to put a difference
betwixt the clean, and the unclean, and between the profane and holy, and
between those that serve him, and those that serve him not; this is Scripture
language, which the wicked cannot bear in practice, and life, nor to hear their
conditions in words spoken to them.

This was I moved to write forth to them that are without, and them that are
within, that are growing up into Judgment, and to them that do not understand
Judgment, that their minds may be informed to examine where they are, by the
light of God within them; the Lord is making a separation, whether you be
separated from God, or to God, the light within will tell you, and that which
should exercise your conscience, will tell you, hearkening to it; but that
generation is separated from God, I do know, in which lodges persecution, and
all the righteous blood has been shed by this generation, that now is standing
in nature, who drink the blood of the Saints, and make war with the Lamb, but
the Lamb shall get the victory; praises, praises be to the Lord God Almighty.

Thou art blind that can not discern betwixt Jacob and Esau; and thou art
blind that say Jacob is Esau; and thou art blind that say Cain is Abel;
and thou art blind that say Ishmael is Isaac; and thou art blind that say
such as are called of men Masters, stand praying in the Synogogues, lay heavy
burdens upon the people, are the Ministers of Christ, which Christ cried woe
against: And thou art blind are foolish, Ier. 5.
that hold up such Priests, as bear rule by their means; and thou art blind,
and art made a prey upon, that hold up such shepherds as seek for the
Fleece, and cloth with the wool, which the Lord sent his Prophets to cry
against; and thou art blind that say, such as seek for their gain from their
quarter, and run greedily after the error of Balaam, for gifts and rewards, are
the Ministers of Christ; And the Scripture will testify against thee it self;
and thou ownest not the Prophets and Apostles, but art against them, and so
into the ditch thou must go, into destruction (who art blind, and led with the
blind) except thou speedily repent.

Christ's sheep know his voice, and they know the voice of a stranger: the true
Prophets knew who spoke from the mouth of the Lord, and who spoke a divination
of their own brain; so it is now; the Saints that are seasoned, have salt in
themselves, have savoury to discern of others; and to some is given the gift of
discerning of Spirits; And the spiritual man judges all things, but he himself
is judged of no man; he that cannot endure sound Judgment, is not of the
truth, for Zion is redeemed through judgment, and they that sew pillows, are
false Prophets: therefore every one own your judgment and your Portion, and
such a name as belongs to your nature, and deceive not your selves nor others,
for the Saints know that they are of God, and that the whole world, Priests,
People, and Professors, who have not the life of what they do profess, lie in
wickedness.

FINIS.
