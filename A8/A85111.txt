Phancies Phoenix. OR. The Peerless Paragon of the Times.
Being a young Gallants description of a Lady which he has settled his
thoughts on, resolving never to change, not to love any other Beauty or Face in
the World.

And is persuaded if there be.
A Phoenix in the world, it is she.
To an amorous new Tune.


COme all you Batch^lors so brave
that spend your time in Cupids Court
And with your complements do ^r^ve,
with many Ladies for to sport:
I am contrary to your mind,
I court but one, and she (...),
She Is virtuous chaste, and if there be,
a Phoenix in the world it is she.
I little thought I ever could,
by any beauty e're be won,
Nor ca^^ now if that I would,
remove my mind on any one:
No wealth, no beauty, nor no face,
no fire^ thoughts from her disgrace,
She Is virtuous, chaste, and if there be,
a Phoenix in the world it is she.
I Must confess: I am in Love
although I th^ught I never should,
But sure she was sent from above
and made of Natures chiefest mould:
So pure so fair, and all Divine
I Will quit the world to make her mine:
She Is virtuous, chaste and if there be
a Phoenix in the World it is she.
Do you not see the Stars retreat
when Sol salutes the sky so clear
So must all (...) so great
shrink and with (...) appear;
So brighte, so clear, that a^ must say
it is fair Roselia ^laim^ the day,
She Is virtuous, chaste, and if there, etc.
Her bashful Cheeks with blushing sweet,
cast such a rich ve^million dye,
That Rose and (...) ere does meet
each striving for the victory:
So rare, so pure, you'^ scarce believe
dame Nature could such c^lors ^ive
She Is virtuous, chaste, and if there etc
Her eyes like spar^s of Diamonds clear
such glances cast in me ry sort
No wanton^ess ^n them appears
yet Cupid say here keeps his court
'Twas from her Eyes be shot his da^t
y^ ^hus has pierc'^ m^ l^ve-si^k heart
She Is virtuous, chaste, and if there, etc.
But stay my Muse what need have I
to praise her beauty in such sort,
When as her fame abroad does fly
more then I can of her ^epor^:
We^e she to me as kind as fair
then might I live and not des^air
But sure I think if that there be
a Phaenix in the World it is she
For she desires to be alone
and never to participate,
Her l^ve she faith to any one
but single livs without a mate,
Such thoughts I think in few remain
yet does in her the mo^es my pain
Then sure I think if that there be, etc.
Cruel she is to none I hear
no more she is not unto me
Nor proud she is not that is rare
you will say in women for to be
She Is courteous, lovely, chaste, and fair,
it is few that can with her compare
For sure I think if that there be, etc.
Then if she Phenix-like will live
and dye alone I am content
My heart to her i will freely give
unto no other i will consent
But in her flames my heart shall burn
and Phoenix like to ashes turn,
For it is her and none but she
by whom I must revived be.
And if she will not yield at last
but still her resolution hold,
I will not think my time ill spent
nor yet my love shall never wax cold
To stay for such a one as she,
I think no time there lost will be.
I Would better with my fancy wed
then lodge some women in my bed.
I that you needs would know of me
whereas this Phoenix does abide
For that I must excused be
yet near the Strand she does reside
No other notice will I give
to any one whilst I do live,
And if she does a Phaenix dye
look in her ashes there am I.
You roving Batchellors that be
resolved for to spend your time,
In several Maiden^ company
when as their beauty are in prime,
Beware, beware, let virtue guide
th^e to a Maid to make thy Bride:
Let not her beauty tempt your eye,
least virtue too in her you spy.
I must depart time calls away
I cannot now express my mind,
This Song is long enough you will say
unless that she did prove more kind
She Is virtuous, chaste, and therefore
re^^'d to love her t^^ I die.
For sure I think if that there be,
a Phoenix in the world it is she
