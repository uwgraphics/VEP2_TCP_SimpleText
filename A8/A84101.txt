WHereas it is found, That great inconveniences have ensued, for want of a

Lords and Commons in Parliament assembled, That from henceforth the Officers
and Soldiers of the said Army may not expect any further forbearance of such
punishments to be inflicted on them for any their offenses, as shall be due
unto them by the said Laws and Ordinances; But that the Lord General may and
ought to punish them by death, or otherwise, according to their demerits.

Ordered by the Lords and Commons in Parliament, That this Declaration be
