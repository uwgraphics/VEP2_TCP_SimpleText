blazon or coat of arms incorporating the Commonwealth Flag (1649-1651)A
PROCLAMATION OF THE Parliament of the Commonwealth of England, Declaring CHARLES
STVART and his Abettors, Agents and Accomplices, to be Traitors, Rebels and
Public Enemies.
WHereas diverse of the Scottish Nation, and some English Fugitives, being lately
come out of Scotland into England with their Leader CHARLES STUART, Son to the
late Tyrant, do here Leby War against the Commonwealth, and commit many
Outrages, Spoils and Murders upon the people of this Nation; And the said
Charles Stuart has caused himself by the said Men of Scotland and English
Fugitives to be Proclaimed King of England, and by Declarations proscribing
some who have performed great and excellent Service to the Public, and
offering his Indulgences to others, would draw Adherents to him in his wicked
and traiterous Practices, particularly by Letters in his Name directed to the
City of London, and spread abroad by some of his Clandestine Agents, he labors
to court them to his Party, by boasting his own Condition, and by endeavoring
to annihilate the Honor and Esteem of the Parliament and their Forces, who
through Gods Mercy have been so often Instrumental to Chastise him and his
Confederates, and will, through Gods Blessing we trust, still prove a
burthensom Stone unto them; Hoping it seems in the mean time, That that famous
City (whose Faithfulness and eminent Services in behalf of Religion, Laws and
Liberties are ever to be acknowledged) and that others of this Land and Nation,
into whom by his Cunning and Flatteries he would thus insinuate, can forget the
Horrid and Bloody War raised by the late Tyranthis Father, and the Devastations
attending it, and by his Delusions and Impostures be persuaded to betray
Themselves and their Liberties again into Vassalage and Bondage, which through
the Goodness of God, and at so great an Expense of Blood and Treasure have been
vindicated from the Pride and Tyranny of that Man and his Fathers House: Which
laborious Fraud and Falsehood of him the said Charles Stuart has hitherto
notwithstanding, through the Favor of God to his People, proved of small or no
effect but to aggravate his own Guilt, he being a Traitor of a former Date, and
to render Himself and his Accomplices more and more obnoxious to the Penalties of
the Laws of England, Declaring and Adjudging High Treason, wherein they are so
deeply and desperately involved: And whereas by a late Act and Declaration of
Parliament, All persons have been Warned and Commanded not to give any
Countenance or Assistance to the said Charles Stuart or his Party, but to Oppose
them, and to Assist the Forces of this Commonwealth for the apprehending of
them, to which a most cheerful and general Obedience has been given by the
People according to their Duty, wherein the Parliament does humbly acknowledge
the Goodness of God to this Nation, and shall not fail to manifest their good
Acceptance of the Peoples Affections herein; All which the Parliament of
England having taken into their serious Consideration, although they cannot
conceive that any true Englishman can be debauched from the Duty and Fidelity
which they owe to their Native Country, upon such Deluding and false Pretenses
as the Enemy has used, and that therefore it is not necessary to make any
further Declaration herein; Yet for the more Notoriety of the Fact to all
persons concerned to take knowledge of the same, and to avoid all pretense of
Ignorance in any touching the Condition of this Man and his Followers, Have
thought fit to Publish and Declare, And do hereby Publish and Declare the said
Charles Stuart to be a Rebel, Traitor and Public Enemy to the Commonwealth of
England, and all his Abettors, Agents and Accomplices to be Rebels, Traitors and
public Enemies to the Commonwealth of England; And do hereby Command all
Officers Civil and Military, in all Market Towns and convenient places, to
cause this Declaration to be proclaimed and published.

Monday, 25th August, 1651.
ORdered by the Parliament, That this Proclamation be forthwith Printed and
published.
