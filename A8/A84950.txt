A Full ACCOUNT of a most Tragycal and Inhuman Murder, That was Committed
lately in Holland, at Sevenbergen, 3 Hours Walk off the Brill, by One CLAES
WELLS; Who murdered his Father, Henry Wells and his Mother; with 3 Brothers
and one Sister: And after sat the House on Fire, for which he was Executed,
within 3 days after.
If ever there were a Subject that was capable of attracting the Wonder and
infuting Amazement to all Mankind, I think this present Occasion, will afford
as large as ever happened in this World; and I am persuaded, deserves a most
serious Consideration both of too severe Parents, and too disobedient and
extravagant Sons. This dismal Story being the effect of both those sad Errors,
though indeed, even Nero' s Cruelty is not comparable to that of this Monster,
nor the most exquisite Torments, sufficient to expiate such a barbarous and
unnatural Action, as will presently appear.

THIS Claes Wells (by what I could learn) had received as large Education as
his Father could possibly give him; and endowed him also with a sufficient
Wealth to live happily, and was for some time in a fair way of being a Comfort
to his Aged Parents: But alas! Falling into bad Company and by its Temptations
and Allurements, consuming his Patrimony, he lost the Favor of his Friends;
and for 4 years past, would not receive nor admit him in their Sight, till
lately, when in Humility, approaching and entreating his Mother, with Sighs and
Tears, and a pretended Sorrow for his Offense, she harbored him again; and
used her utmost Efforts upon her Husband, but in vain, being by no Entreaties
to be prevailed upon; His Brothers and Sisters Embraced him with a Joy not to
be expressed, mingling with their Endearments a thousand Kisses, and confirmed
their Brotherly Affection by imploring on their Knees a Reconciliation with
their Father; and that he would condescend an admission to his presence, but
his Anger was too inveterate, and their Prayers proved ineffectual: So he was
conveyed up Stairs, and being told of it, fell immediately into a Fit of
Distraction. However, being qualifyed and Silence engaged, lest his Father
should have known he was in the House, and thereby incurred all their Ruin;
when his Father went to Bed he came down, and Eat his Supper with a seeming
Satisfaction; about ten, going to rest with his elder Brother, (they little
thinking of his Design) at 12 a Clock, and being fast asleep, he cut his Throat
first; and having a Dark Lanthorn; entered next unto the other Chamber, where 2
more of his Brothers lay, where he cut their Throats also; then he went into
his Sisters, and cut here is; and lastly come to his Father and Mother, that
received him, and cut her Throat, who struggling, and awaking his Father, he
Cried out, Son, let me live, I Will give you all I have, but could not be
prevailed upon; so stabbed him, and after, sat Fire to the House, which,
allarming the Inhabitants, who securing the Draw-Bridges of the Town, search
was made, and finding him; knowing the Grudge; charged him with it; which not
having power to deny, was immediately conveyed to the Goal, where behaving
himself with all the Outrages of a terrified Conscience; as Cursing his whole
Family, and crying out for Damnation; The whole Confession in his most sober
Intervals were only, That his Father was the Cause; When he came upon the
Scaffold, and saw the Fate he was to suffer, he laughed at first, then Raved;
the manner of his Execution being thus; It is the Custom in Holland to execute
in the middle of the Town upon a Scaffold before the Stadthouse; where was
placed a large square Hearth of Bricks, and a Fire being kindled, this
Malefactor was hanged up by his left Leg upon an Iron Gibbet, at some small
distance, and was wasted until he expired; The Spectators of this Tragedy,
rather upbraided than pitied him, and the Tumult could hardly forbear tearing
him Piece meal

This sad Catastrophe may be a warning to Children, first to be Obedient, and
keep within bounds; but more particularly, to avoid bad Company, which was the
destruction of This, and is of many more Youths in England and elsewhere; And
Secondly, to Parents, not too much by Severity to expose their Children to
Want, and provoke them to Wrath; both being the Causes of such direful Effects,
it is hoped this Paper will be a Means to Cure the Licentiousness of the former,
and the Inveteracy of the latter.
