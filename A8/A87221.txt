It is humbly proposed on the behalf of the PURCHASERS OF BISHOPS, and DEANS
and CHAPTERS Lands.
WHereas his late MAJESTY of blessed memory, in his Concessions upon the Treaty
at the Isle of Wight, did grant, That the Purchasers of Bishops Lands should
hold the same for 99 years; and did also declare his Judgment and
Condescension for the alienating Deans and Chapters Lands in Fee, for such uses
as should be afterward resolved on:

It is humbly proposed, That the Purchasers of the said Lands respectively, may
hold the same for 99 years, paying one fourth part of the first Purchase-money;
or to be confirmed to them in Fee, paying one third part of the said
purchase-money; one Moiety thereof within two months after an Act of
Parliament shall be passed for that purpose; and the other Moiety within six
months then next following: which is conceived will amount to about six
hundred thousand pounds, for that the said Lands were sold for about three and
twenty hundred thousand pounds; and paying a twentieth part of the present
improved Rent to his MAJESTY, or such other use as by Act of Parliament shall
be appointed; which, with the Remainder of the Possessions unsold, will raise a
greater yearly Rent then formerly.

Hereby, a considerable sum of money for his MAJESTY'S service, will be
speedily raised; the Kingdom so much eased, and discharged of so great a debt
as three and twenty hundred thousand pounds, for which the said Lands were
sold; the Honor of Parliaments, and the Public Faith given for the same,
repaired; as great a Revenue as formerly to his MAJESTY, or the Church,
continued; the Purchasers satisfied, their Possessions quieted; Industry and
Improvements encouraged; no Sales, Settlements or Securities disturbed, and
infinite Suits prevented.
