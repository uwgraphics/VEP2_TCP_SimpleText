A BRIEF OF THE STATE OF THE CASE OF WALTER ELFORDS COMPLAINT Against Sr
SACKVILE CROW, which is to be reported to the PARLIAMENT.
THE English Factory at Smyrna in Asia being divided, in December, 1643. some
of the party disaffected to the Parliament, secretly and underhand informed Sr.
Sackvile Crow, then Ambassador at Constantinople, that Elford had concealed a
licentious discourse or dispute had between two English men at his Table,
concerning the Parliament, and the late King; which in truth he not only
reproved, but timely revealed: whereupon Sr. Sackvile like an Inquisitor
concealing (as he does to this day) the Accusers names and the Accusation,
causes Elford to be closely imprisoned 30. months (even till news came of the
Parliaments victorious successes) mean time he was put by the exercise of his
profession as a Factor, whereby he (before that restraint) gained above 1000
li. per annum.

That being not literally discharged from prison, but only verbally enlarged,
the said Elford for fear of anew relaps into restraint, hastily departed from
Smyrna, leaving his af fairs there in a confusion, in so much, that he is now
necessitated to repair thither to put them in order.

Now it is observable, that had not the Parliament then prevailed, Elford
(notwithstanding his innocence) had been sent into England as a Malefactor and
Traitor, to answer this imposed and feigned crime, wherewith the said Sr
Sackvile by his Warrant of restraint had most injuriously stigmatized him.
