only) rise and Original of all the grand grievances, and Obstructions of Piety
and Justice, over the whole KINGDOM.

Together with a Sovereign Salve, and precious Plaisture, for the
Unquestionable Cure thereof (by Gods blessing) if it be seriously and
seasonably applied, according to direction herein, humbly prescribed.

and Religious Presbyterian Members of Parliament.

EZECHIEL 13.22. With lies, ye have made the heart of my people sad, whom I
have not sadded, And strengthed the hands of the wicked, that he should not
return from his wickedness. MAY. 18, 7. We unto the World, because of Offenses,
it inevitably will be that Offenses come, but woe to that man (or those men) by
whom the Offenses do come. GALAT. 1.7, 8. There be some that trouble you and
would pervert the Gospel of Christ. But, though I, or an Angel from heaven (or
one like an Angel, for pretended purity and Saint-ship) preach any other Gospel
(or broach any other damnable destructive opinions) than that which I have
preached unto you, let him be accursed. LONDON, Printed in the year. 1648.

The Impiety of Impunity.
WHen the Lord, the most righteous Judge of the whole world, and the most
potent and prudent Moderator of all things in heaven and earth, began, first,
to settle the Commonwealth of Jsrael, and to give those his people good Laws,
and holy and wholesome Institutions, which, if a man do and perform he shall
even live, ye happily, live, in them, Ezech. 20.11. He then also gave them
special Cautions and Commands to keep and do them, as is most clear, Levit.
19.15. Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, thou shall not respect the
person of the poor, nor honor the person of the mighty; but in righteousness
shall thou judge thy neighbor. And remarkably excellent (for all that sit in
seats of judicature) is that, Deuteronomy. 1.17. Ye shall not respect persons in
judgment, but you shall hear the small as well as the great; you shall not be
afraid of the face of man, for the judgment is Gods. So that (hence) it is
evident, that it is not enough for a people to have good Laws and pious and
provident Precepts, but there must also be a special care had to a just and
impartial judging of Gods people according to those Laws, neither to pervert
or wrest them ( Deuteronomy. 16.19.) according to men's Schismatic humors; nor to
slight or neglect them for want of a righteous and severe execution of them;
which, indeed makes Magistrates and Judges, but mere Scare-Crows in a
Commonwealth, and just like the sign or picture of George on horseback with
his Sword brandisht and flourisht over his head, but never striking with it;
whereas it is the exact and impartial execution of Laws, indeed, which is the
life and luster of Laws, and the firm establishment of States and Kingdoms.
Now, then this being thus only in brief hinted; now for application of these
premises to our present purpose. It is most undeniably true, that (by Gods
great mercy) England has as good and wholesome Laws and Ordinances, both old
and new, for the well and orderly regulating of al things both in Church and
State, I believe, as any Nation in the World: Nay, may we not (with holy David)
say most truly, God has not dealt so, almost with any Nation under heaven, as
with us, and as for his judgments, they have not known them, as we have, both
in the power, purity, and plenty of them; O that we had hearts enough
practically thankful for so rich and rare a mercy! But, may not that question
be put to too many of our Judges and Magistrates, yea, even in our High and
Honorable Supreme Court of Parliament, which the foresaid kingly Prophet
David did put to the Judges of his days, Psa. 58 1, 2. Do ye, indeed speak
Righteousness, O ye Congregations? Do ye judge uprightly, O ye sons of men? yea
rather, in heart and tongue, ye work wickedness. So, may not I be humbly
bold, in the bitterness of my Soul, to sigh out this very same most sad
complaint of the Prophet (not, as those late audacious Incendiaries, those
Jesuiticall-spirited and murmuring Masters of misrule, who plead most unjustly
for Liberty (or rather for Licentiousnes) of Conscience, I mean those
spiritually proud Sectaries and fiery Salamanders of Contention, Master John
Goodwin, together with his most seditious brother John Lilburne, Overton, and
diverse others of that rotten rout, unworthy the naming, who swelter and
swagger, with their restless spirits and pens, against any Authority,
Dominions and Dignities, save only such as themselves would wickedly set up to
please their own seditious and pernicious Palates: But, as the Lord, the most
righteous Judge, and only searcher of the hearts and reigns of his Children
knows, in the spirit of meekness, sorrow, and sobriety) may not I (I say) too
justly, thus complain against some of our Parliamentary Judges, in these our
days, and of these I mean (mainly, and specially) diverse disaffected
Schismatic Members of both Houses of Parliament, who (being got or crept in
among our other most famous and faithful Parliamentany Worthies, whom from my
heart, I highly honor and love, but by what means they have thus crept in, I
know not, but it were singularly worth the serious search and Scrutiny to know
how they came in, and by what right they sit as Judges and Senators there) who
do most unjustly and partially (for their Schisms sake, and other most
unworthy Selfe-ayms, and Interests) wrest the judgments and Ordinances of the
Land, yea of the Lord God himself, and accept the persons of most bold
blasphemous Sectaries, Anabaptists, Antinomians, Anti-Scripturists, Seekers,
and (who closely and craftily include and embrace all those others in their
bosoms) disorderly and dissembling Independents; whereby they extremely
strugle in upholding these, to withold and hinder (if not totally to
overturne, eradicate and ruinate) the glorious work of our Parliamentary
promised, yea our Covenant plighted thorough Reformation, especially in matters
of our Religion, and godly Church Discipline (for which I mainly complain and
plead in this discou^se) calumniating and disgracing it, with the most
opprobrious titles, and injurious terms of a bloody, tyrannical, and
Antichristian Deformation; and most falsely and fraudulently magnifying (yea,
even deifying) their own sandy Congregationall way with the specious Epithites
and Encomiums of Milkie-paths (forsooth) glorious ways, Christ's Kingdom and
such like most loud lying and eluding glosses; Thus, wilfully (I fear)
forgetting that which the holy Spirit of God says, by Solomon the wisest King
that ever was; Prove. 24.24, 25. He that says to the wicked thou art righteous,
him shall the people curse, and Nations shall abhor him. But, to them that
rebuke him shall be delight, and a good blessing shall come upon them. Now,
that our slye and subtle Sectaries and Independents (every where) are most
deeply dyed, even in grain, with this foul and faulty spot, which is not the
spot of Gods Children, but ( Deuteronomy. 32.5.) of a perverse and crooked generation,
let these following testimonies, fallen out (besides their manifold former
Calumnies and Slanders, by them cast upon the pious Presbyterian
Church Government, and upon the Reverend, and pious Pastors and faithful
friends and furtherers of it, published in their most wicked printed Pamphlets,
and recited by Reverend and religious Mr Edwards in the third part of his
Gangrana, p. 200, 201, 202, 203, etc.) and whereof I my self, together with
many other religious and substantial Citizens of London, were eye and ear
witnesses at Westminster) be sufficient to demonstrate and make evident to any
impartial and unprejudiced Christian, or, that is not wickedly obstinate and
wilfully incredulous, which were as follow.

I being (on Tuesday, February 2. 1646. and on the Thursday following, Febr.
5th. in the afternoon) at the Commit for Complaints, to hear the examination
of one Kiffin a Glover, a sly and sottish Mechanical preaching Anabaptist, and
one Mr. Knowles, another of his Anabaptisticall brethren, which last, had cast
off his former regular Ordination in the Church of England, as being sinful
(forsooth, as himself then confessed) and had a pretended Ordination from a true
reformed-Church (as he falsely termed it) in a private House, by a company of
Sectaries, there disorderly assembled: Together also with one Gorton, another
Nonsense Anabaptisticall Preacher, forsooth, and a most notorious base fellow,
and audacious Malefactor in New England, who had there been fettered in Irons,
and whipped, and was like to have been hanged for his most impious and audacious
blasphemies and misdemeanors; upon occasion of the mentioning whereof, in that
Court, I heard an eminent Independent Gentl. of that Committee, say openly in
the face of the Court, I (says he) ye may see how they begin already, what
think ye, will they not do hereafter, if they get power and may be suffered?
And with the said Gorton, was then also examined one Patience a Botcher, or
Tailor; ordained also (forsooth) to be a Preacher, in a true reformed-Church
(as he also falfly and foolishly termed it) in a House in Bell-Alley in
Colleman-Street, by the Saints, forsooth, of that Church, Men and Women
(Hee-Saints and Shee-Saints, and all of them it seems, Church Officers with
them) upon trial of his gifts, by these Saints, as thus he also himself
confessed. At the hearing of whom examined, my heart was (at the first) affected
with no little joy and comfort, to hear and observe, even all along, the
Christian Courage, and godly Zeal of that ancient and pious Patriot Sir Robert
Harlow religious and renowned Major General Massey, Colonel Hollys, Mr. Tate,
Mr. Baynton, and some other worthy Presbeterian Members of the House, then
present at this Committee (as formerly at another sitting, I observed the
singular zeal of my most highly honored good friend, Mr. Grimstone, much
honored Colon. Harvy, and others) both in their frequently and fervently
speaking and pleading for the Cause of God, then in agitation before them. But
when I on the other side saw and observed, in this Committee, very many known
and professed Independents, to sit as Judges there, and too frequently and
fiercely (me thought) to act and plead for, yea and to put words into the
mouths of those Delinquent Sectaries, and (though all of them were, I say,
known adversaries to our pious Presbyterian Church Government, intended, as we
steadfastly hope, by the better-part of the honorable Parliament, yet these I
say) to sit as Judges there, and to speak such encouraging words (and that in
open Court) to the Delinquents, and then also to have power to Vote on their
behalfes; and contrawise also, to observe and hear them use such discouraging
carriages, and dishearting expressions to the honest and pious Covenant-engaged
and Ordinance animated Prosecutors of the Offenders. This made me fetch a deep
Sigh, indeed, as being much amazed at it, and I must confess, my heart was
very much daunted and damped with grief to see and observe such a most
unequal and palpably injurious mismanaging of so great and godly a work as we
hoped and expected this would and should have been unto us. And it was indeed
unto me a wonderful and strange Paradox of Prudence and Justice (as I humbly
conceive) that the apparent and professed enemies of the Presbyterian-Cause and
Reformation, should thus sit as Judges and Parties to affront us, and frown
upon us, for our loyal, religious, and just actings against such crafty and
accursed adversaries of the Truth. Which made me begin seriously to consider
with my self, how improbable (if not almost impossible) it was for us in such a
case and condition of times and things, ever to expect a full and free course
or current of justice against them. And hereupon, indeed, my sad thoughts began
to reflect backward, and to think upon the by-past-times of the tyrannical
Prelates, when pious and peaceable Professors were (under the names and
notions of factious and Scismaticall) cited in their High-Commission-Courts,
and there judged by those known enemies of their causes; where, indeed I
confess, they were all professed adversaries (but here, our truly seditious and
Schismatic Delinquents, and the honest prosecutors of them also find an
unhappy mixture of Foes with Friends) whereby though the pious Professors
themselves could there find, indeed, neither expect any justice; yet the wicked
Apparators and Persecutors of those true Saints and Servants of the Lord, were
countenanced and encouraged by those their Prelaticall Masters, yea and
liberally rewarded by them: But, here, in this Committee for Complaints, where
the cause being far otherwise, the case is also in some sense clean contrary,
and (if I may be humbly bold to speak plain English) in some respects, with us
much worse, and more unjust, when the most pernicious and audacious
Schismatic offenders are familiarly much countenanced and encouraged, and
the honest and Covenant-Conscientious Prosecutors of them are disgraced,
flouted, frowned upon, yea and imprisoned for their pious pains, and religious
actings for God and his most righteous Cause: whereby, I say, our Case is thus
like to be far worse than that of the Prelates days (comparatis comparandis)
and our grievances, yea I say, our Soul grievances, so far (we fear) from being
redressed, that they are like to be much more increased, if this most unjust
course of judicature should (which God forbid) be continued, and that Sectaries
be thus suffered (both in Parliament and country-Committees) to sit, as
uncontroleable Judges, who are so far from either doing or suffering justice to
be done upon the most seditious and factious disturbers of our pious Peace and
unquestionable Truths of God, and of all godly ecclesiastical and civil
Order; that they both countenace (at least as much as in their power and policy
consists, and truly that is not little now adays) and very greatly encourage
them in their unsufferable Schismatic impundencies and blasphemous
impieties, both against God and Man, and all under base and abusive pretenses
of tenderness of Conscience, forsooth, and Christian Liberty to speak and do
whatsoever they list, without control; otherwise, they cry out of
Antichristian Persecution. But mark here (good Reader) what wise King Solomon
most pertinently says to this very purpose, even touching Impunity to be the
grand cause of the great growth of Impiety, yea and of Impudency also therein,
Ecclesiastes 8.11. Because sentence against an evil work is not speedily
executed; therefore the hearts of the sons of men is fully set in them (mark
this notable and emphaticall expression) to do evil. And certainly (if ever)
this Scripture is now adays to the full confirmed, to the unexpressible grief
of our Souls be it spoken.

But now to come to a more particular manifestation of the truths which I only
in brief have mentioned before, concerning the most irregular and
extrajudiciall and inequitable carriage of things by our Sectarian Judges in
the Court of the Committee for Complaints, at Westiminster, to the palpable and
apparent heartning and animating of the most notorious Schismatics in their
most blasphemous and impious pranks and practices; and to the most strange, and
almost incredible disheartning (as much as in them is) of the pious
Presbiterian-Partie, from their just zeal and commendable activity in the Cause
of GOD, and forwarding the work of Reformation. Witness first, (therefore I
say for confimation of these my affirmations) the most unequal and
unwarrantable miscarriage of things by some of the disaffected party of the
foresaid Committee, at the examination of an old and bold blasphemous
Schismatic, commonly called the Chicken-man; who after this notorious Sectarie
had made a repetition (whereunto he was commanded by the Court) of his Sermon,
forsooth, which he had Preached (or rather prated) in a private house, for
which he was complained of, and when he had and a ciously delivered, even in
the face of the Court diverse very dangerous and most false opinions of his; yet
was so far and free from punishment, or so much as any bare discouragement (for
ought we yet can hear or know) that one of the said Committees was heard to
say to one of his disaffected brethren of this Committee, sitting by,
concerning this beggarly Chicken-man and his impious preaching; here is Gold in
an earthen vessel. And the said Chicken-man himself confessed (as will be
testified) that he had 5s. given him by some of the said Commit, for his
brave boldness (it should seem) in thus affronting the authority of
Parliament. Witness likewise the great encouragement and countenancing of the
Schismatic impiety, and disorderly audaciousnesse of those two foresaid
Anabaptists, Mr. Knowlis, and Kiffin the Glover, at their examination
forementioned, at the very beginning whereof an eminent disaffected Member of
the Committee stood up, and the Court being set, and the pious Chairman in his
place, be spoke very much (in the first place) to the Chairman, and very
affectionately in those Schismatics behalf (whereby they might easily see and
know before haud, they had at least, one fast friend in the Court) for a fair
proceeding for them, in their examination; which I humbly conceive and verily
believe was never denied them, or otherwise intended toward them. And when
Kiffin, in particular, was closely examined for his disorderly and
Schismatic private preaching (as never having been duly ordained thereunto)
another of the Committee did in my sight and hearing, even as it were check the
religious Chaire-man, learned and much honored Colonel Leigh, for justly
endeavoring strickly to examine the said Delinquent. And this same Gentl. to
the said Anabaptists farther great encouragement, at the same time, apparently
justified (and that in the face of the Court) those audacious fellows, in
their unordained and irregular preaching, even contrary to the Parliaments own
Ordinance, using these words, or the like, in effect. That the Parliament did
not intend, nor was it (as he conceived) the sense of the House, by that
Ordinance, to hinder guifted-men from Preaching, this being one thing (...)
which many had fought, and spent their blood, and ventured their ^ives; but it
was mainly to restrain Prelaticall and Jesuitical ^reaching, which was a
means to encourage the Cavaleers and Malig^ants against the Parliament. And
when some of the honest and religious Witnesses gave in their testimony against
the Delinquent, diverse of the audacious and unruly Anabaptists and other sorts
of Sectaries (whereof there were very many then in the Court, and so use to be,
to affront and floute the Presbyterian Citizens with unsufferable scoffs and
jeeres to their faces) fell a hissing and to loud laughing at the Witness, to
the great offense and disturbance of the Court (which I my self heard and saw
round about me) and noble Sir Robert Harlow most zealously and justly finding
much fault with their so uncivil and unmannerly miscarriage of themselves, and
expressing much displeasure at it; One of the disaffected Members of the
Committee put a smooth jeere upon it, and said, He conceived it was rather an
acclamation or applauding of the witness, than any disparagement to him.
Which, how likely hissing and laughing mixed together, can make up such a sense
let any judicious man judge.

Witness, here also, that most licentious and illegitimate abuse offered to
the Liberty of the freeborn Subjects and Citizens of London, in that palpable
and most worthily punishable affront, and illegal imprisonment of those 3.
worthy, religious, discreet, and conscientiously active Gentl. and Citizens of
London, Captiane Wigmerpoole, Mr. Patrick Bamford, and Mr. Valentine Feige, who
were all three, at one instant, most injuriously imprisoned, for only acting
about a most honest Petition and Remonstrance, which was to have been
recommended by the Citizens, to the Lord Major and Common Council of London,
to be, by them presented to the Parliament, in the name of the whole City; and
all this in such a regular and modest manner, as had been by the Parliament it
self ordered and prescribed to them; yet notwithstanding (I say) for this
honest and orderly acting of theirs, these 3 aforesaid Gentl. were imprisoned,
by some Sectarian Parliament-Members, contrary to the intention, and order of
Parliament, as that whole Committee for Complaints publicly acknowledged in
Court, and worthy Sr. William Strickland (who then sat in the Chair) protested
against it as unlawful, and none of his act or consent. And those
Schismatic Members that commanded this most unlawful imprisonment; being,
since that, discovered who they are. And shall the Sectarian Party complain (as
in Teuledaye's seditious cause they did) of wrong done to them, in the
obstructing and hindering their most pernicious and seditious petitions, and
dare they most abusively impeach 11. worthy Members of the House of Commons,
for this very thing* as one soul fault and offense against the subject; but
indeed mainly, because they are faithful Presbyterians? And shall not these
Sectarian-Members be much more justly impeached of most illegal and injurious
infringement of the Subjects Libertyes (equally as precious to us, as
Parliament Privileges are to them) and be enforced to give just repairations
to those injured Gentl. for their false imprisonment? And, truly, I much
marvel, that they themselves are so silent, all this while, in this their
own so just vindication of themselves therein. And (which, though here in the
last, yet not in the least place, but which deserves to be in the first and
prime place, as being first acted. Witness, in a special manner, the most
impious and slanderous abuses cast upon the whole Assembly of venerable
Divines, both formerly, and still to this very day (and that without all fear
of punishment on the offenders part) in most scurrillous and scandalous
Pamphlets, by the pernicious Pens of blattering and barking Sectaries of all
sorts: But more notoriously in that most high affront, and great
discouragement, yea and disparagement too (as much as in them was) intended to
be put upon the said reverend, and religious Assembly, by the Sectarian
disaffected party, in the House of Commons, it felse, by whose means the
Assembly of Divines were most unjustly denied permission by the Authority of
that House to vindicate their Integrity against an all over most slanderous
Remonstrance, published in print against the whole Assembly by 7 of the most
Capital and Cardinal Schismatics of the same Assembly; yea, though our
Divines had most earnestly petitioned the House of Commons, yet were denied
this most just favor from them, and were, thereupon, enforced to fly unto the
most honorable House of Peers, for justice therein, and, there, by Gods good
providence, most honorably obtained it, to their unterminated and indelible
honor and praise, be it ever mentioned. And truly (Christian Reader) if these
things were not too apparently thus, viz. That the very Fountain and Spring of
all the sad and bad obstructions of the work of Reformation were not at this
Conduit-Head, the Parliament; and that all sorts of Sectaries, and their
Boulsterers and Abbettors (notwithstanding all Petitions and Complaints against
them) were not, There, strongly and strnagely countenanced and encouraged; how
durst Mechanics, Soldiers, and Troopers in the Army, and al Sectaries both in
City and Country, so audaciosly and disorderly take upon them to Preach without
Due-Ordination, yea and to re-Baptise men and women, youths and maids, so
frequently and familiarly, yea and obscurely too, naked in Rivers, and that in
cold weather, sometimes with great danger of death, yea death it self, in
some, so plunged overhead and ears in the water? How durst many, both
Commanders and Common-Souldiers in the army (yea, that army of Saints, for
sooth, so magnified, and cryed-up, for Piety and Civilty) so audaciously in
high contempt of the Authority of Parliament, scorn and cast away Ordinances of
Parliament, produced for the protection and safeguard of godly and grave
Ministers, abused, beaten, and with great violence kept out, yea and sometimes
pulled out of their Pulpiss by those sainted Soldiers and Commanders? Yea, how
durst some of them be so bold, so impious, so blasphemous against God and his
Christ, as (horresco referens) to bring a Horse into a Church, to piss into the
Font, and with that piss (in high and horrid contempt of that sacred Ordinance
of Christ himself for Baptizing of Infants) to baptize the horse in the Font,
to sign it with the sign of the cross, to have Godfathers and Godmothers for
it, and to name it Baal-Esau (an act alone, if there were nothing else in the
Army, enough to bring Gods wrath upon them most deservedly) all this being
strongly justified by reverend Mr. Edwards, Gangr. pt. 3. p. 17.

Nay, more, How durst that base and bold traitorly Tailor, loyce, so
impudently, and independently (it seemd) assault (as we all know of late, he
has done) the Kings Person in his bed, together with his armed traitorous
Troops, and most audaciously wrest and wring his Majesty out of the
Parliaments hands, forcing noble Colonel Graves to fly away, and so
imprisoning both the King himself and the Parliaments Commissioners in their
Harpiean paws and power; And in all this their traitorous actings and
proceedings, their General, Sir Thomas, Fairfax to be silent, and at most, to
plead ignorance thereof, and (notwithstanding that, now, he sees and knows it,
yet) suffers that traiters head still upon his shoulders, and executes not
Marshall-Law upon him, and some of the other prime Actors therein (which, I
humbly conceive, by the rules of Martial discipline, he might and should have
done) the best way, I suppose, to purge his own innocence therein, and to
clear his integrity to the Parliament, and to make all honest men to believe
he had no hand therein, and gave no consent thereunto. And yet, in all this, I
cannot but mightily admire and wonder at the most strange stupidity, and
enchanted besottednesse of the Malignant party, also, that they should be so
bewitched by that Hypocritical and most dissembling Army of Saints, forsooth,
as to believe that they do all this in honor to the Kings Person and dignity,
whereas, they and we all know it is one of these Schismatics prime principles
(as Lilburne, and all his desperate adherents hold and publish in print)
utterly to cast off Monarchy and Magistracy. And I my self can justify that
one of the principal Colonells now in the Army, and a Member of the House of
Commons, and one of them that had his hand in print with the others, that by
name, impeached the eleaven Members: Yea, I say, one of the most smooth-mouth'd
Saints in that whole Army, having not long since, had conference with me in
London, and I at that time pleading with him, in the behalf of the King,
professing it was my mind and judgment, that all good and godly courses were
to be used to work His Majesty (if possible, by Gods gracious help) to true
repentance and godly reformation with us; but, he answered me presently, That
the King was a a man of blood, and must be brought to justice for it, unless
he could clear himself. And do these men, then (think our Malignants)
intend any good to the King or his posterity. Yea, (to go on) and were it not
for our Parliament Sectaries, how durst our audacious Sectaries and
Schismatics pen, print and publish (even almost without control, I am sure
without just and mightily merited punishment in the most of them) such base,
blasphemous and notoriously seditious books, such as lying Lilburnes base
Pamphlets, Goodwins abhominably blasphemous Hagio Ma: against GOD and all sound
power of Godliness, against the King, and the Lords and Commons in Parliament,
to stir up the hearts of the people (if it were possible for them, and that
the over-powring hand of God did not most mightily and mercifully cross and
confound their most devilish and desperate design therein) to rise up in
rebellion against them all, and so to bring all things both sacred and civil,
into a most unexpressible and woeful Chaos and confusion? which how near they
are come to it, at this time (by all the strangely grasped power which the Army
has now got into their clutches) we all see and stand amazed and wonder at.
And, how durst the (of late) degenerous Gentry of that unconquered County of
Kent, who (formerly) began so bravely, but afterward I say, turned their backs
so unworthily upon Piety and Justice, as to endeavor to bring that people into
one of the greatest and basest Yoakes of slavery and arbytrary Tyranny that
ever any people endured, or, indeed, could endure, viz. Not so much as to dare
to grown out their griefs, no not in a modest way of petitioning for ease of
them; and so to make that an accursed leading-case to all the Counties and
Committees over the Kingdom? And, were it not that the Sectaries in the
Parliament, and their nauseons neutrall Sidemen, were so potent, politic and
confident to carry on any design suitable to their self-aymes and interests,
especially, their damnable Diana, an intolerable toleration of Liberty of
Conscience; how durst a certain company of them (in most high affront to the
famous City of London (which has deserved so well of the Parliament) and
apparent injury to their famous and faithful late Lord Major, Alderman Adams
in the time of his renowned Majoralty) suddenly enter his house at 12. or 1. of
the Clock at night, forcing him out of his bed, at that time of the night, and
(as it was generaly reported) searching his house, yea and his very pockets of
his wearing clothes, as if he had bin a very Traitor, and all this but only
out of mere Chymaera's, conceits, and jealousies of him, being a most pious
and zealous Presbyterian, but, they were not able to find ought against him,
to lay to his charge (such was his intact integrity, and unspotted loyalty) for
which so injurious dealing with him, and thus affronting him in his peaceable
house and bed of rest, had he presently clapped them up in prison, in the City
(as, it is believed, he might, they so illegally assaulting him, the Cities
supreme Magistrate) he had done most worthily, but we hope time will call them
to account for this and the rest of their most ungrateful dealings with so
renowned and honorable Citizens, who have by their persons, lives, blood, and
almost incredible sums of treasure, (next under God) been the main
preservers of the Parliament to this very day; yet, which has, I say, with
such black and gross ingratitude, rewarded all their cost and kindness, by
discountenancing and retarding their justest desires, calling and counting
their most famous and faithful Petitions and Remonstrances, seditious and
candalous papers; and now of late especially, abusing the whole City (to please
a rebellious Army) as touching their Militia, and by an Ordinance of the
Sectaries and their Sidemen (for, none else, certainly would or did assent unto
it) of both Houses, condemning the Citizens most honest Petition, and
necessitated Reingagement to stand to their Covenant, of high Treason, and the
Authors thereof and Actors therein to be Traitors (to a most disloyal Army)
thus, making our sacred Covenant, so solemnly commanded by both Houses, taken
over the whole Kingdom, a most dangerous snare unto us all, and hereby
bringing all honest and Conscientious Covenanters into a most intricate
Labyrinth and dangerous Dilemma, viz. That, if they will not (in the present
and most eminent emergency of the Church and States great danger) act according
to their Covenant, they are accursed, as forsworn Perjurers to their great
God; And if they do act according to it, they are proclaimed Traitors, to the
Parliament or Army, rather. O inauditum and infandum-nefas! And if these things
were not thus, how durst those mercenarie-Scriblers of the weekly Diurnalls,
and that botching Moderate-Intelligencer (as now adays he terms himself,
being by his own fear and shame whipped out of his former title, the
Parliament-Scout, forsooth, and the rest of their brazen-faced brethren, the
other mendacious News-mongers, the undoubted hirelings and pandors of
Independents, and all other sorts of Sectaries, how durst these, I say, so
audaciously stricke with the fist of slander, one week; and stroke with the
fingers of flattery, the next week, the untainted integrity and resplendent
reputation of our most loyal and loving Brethren of Scotland, as they have
done? making their incomparable fame and faithfulness to stand or fall, every
week, at the reversion of the beggarly shreds of their botching pens and
pleasures; yea notwithstanding, that those our most dear Brethren had
heretofore requested the Parliament to punish, or, at least, to restrain or
silence their insolences, in thus using and abusing them, as indeed they do to
all others of the Presbiterian-party, on whomsoever their saucy humors please
to spit upon, and all this without the least appearance of punishment or
restraint? Yea how, I say, durst all these, and more than these most gross and
grievous enormities and foul deformities in Government thus boldly break-out
among us, were it not that such a company of disaffected Members did thus sit
Judges, as aforesaid in the Parliamentary Committee for Complaints at
Westminster, yea and in the very body it self of the whole Parliament, both
Lords and Commons, whether, all the Schismatics and Sectaries over the whole
Kingdom, both City and Country, do too well know all their business are at
the last and utmost exigent to be transacted and heard, and where they are sure
such a company of their fast friends, shall sit as their Judges, and therefore
whatsoever Complaints are made against them, they do but laugh in their sleeves
at us, and contemn all our threats or menacings of them, as being well assured
that by these their Patrones means, either our complaints shall be totally
stifled, as abortive-Embrio's; or if heard, so pinch't and pined with most
tedious-tyrings and languishing delays, that we weere (for the most part)
better sit still in silence, and groan under our grievances, than torture and
turmoile our selves with remediless wrestlings, to little or no purpose. Which
things (and many more to these effects, too tedious here to be cited) being
thus, alas, to what end is all this noise of our so hoped and longed-for
Reformation, in the serious Suppression of Blasphemies, Schisms, and Errors,
and in the substantial settlement and completing of our promised
Presbyterian-Government? Why do the honest-hearted, active and religious
Covenant-engaged Citizens of London, thus toil and tire themselves, day by
day, with too lank and empty hopes, and pining expectations of redress of al
these high dishonours of almighty God, and great grievances on the hearts and
consciences of his people, in bringing seditious Sectaries, as Delinquents and
bold Affronters of the Supreme Court of the Kingdom, the Parliament, to this
Committee, where they continually find such a company of their Jndependent
friends sitting as Judges of those Offenders whom these very Judges (as being
known Parties with them in Judgment and Opinion) do ardently love and like,
yea hug in their hearts, and as much as possibly they can, do labor to
maintain, countenance, commend, and encourage in their most erroneous, yea
blasphemous and seditious practices. witness, blasphemous Best, that bold and
abominable Beast, indeed, not worthy to live; seditious, lying Lilburne,
Overton, and such like turbulent trash; who (though some of their persons are
(I confess) or have bin (but, with no little struggling) only imprisoned, where
truly, they are (just as the Romish Jesuits were) better maintained, than
abroad, yet) are still strangely permitted to foment and scatter in scurrillous
Pamphlets, their most blasphemous opinions, and pernicious practices; yea, and
are most unworthily and wickedly justified and commended, even by very many of
our Sectarian disaffected Members of Parliament? Alas, what is become, now
adays, of the pristine power, dignity, equity, gravity, and awefull and
lawful severity of our former ancient English-Parliaments? Heretofore it was
as terrible, criminal, and punishable to speak (especially to write) against
the justice, acts and edicts of the Parliaments of England, as to speak or
write treason against the Person, or Crown of the King. But that now, in these
our days, every base and ignoble Sectarie should be thus permitted
presumptuously to speak, write and preach against it, and that, with the most
false and ignominious acrimony of spirits and pens, that possibly may be, I am
confidently persuaded, it is not to be paralelled by any bypast ages or
Histories. What? has amiable Astraea quite forsaken our Parliaments on earth,
and is impartial and Majesticall justice no where to be found? for if not
there, where shall we find it? Shall honest, peaceable and humble hearted
Presbyterians be thus, enforced (which God forbid, and which, as yet, we
heartily abhor) to fear and suspect that those audacious and contumelious
aspertions, and (we hope and believe) most slanderous Calumnies of seditious
lying Lilburne and the rest of his rebelliously railing and scribbling Comrades,
are like to prove too true assertions? and all because of such delatory
obstructions, yea, even vicious violations and infringements of the course and
current of justice, and the Subjects hereditary just Liberties, equally as
precious to them, as due privileges are to the Parliament: God forbid, I say,
we should have continued cause to fear it. But, if it be otherwise; How, then,
comes it to pass, that the wheels of the glorious work of a deeply desired,
and most duly promised and long expected Reformation turn and roll so slowly
and heavily? How is it, that Votes and Ordinances for the advancement of pure
Religion, the power of godliness and our Covenanted Presbyterian Church
Discipline, are so extremely delayed, and with such admired difficulty, even as
it were, but, pedetentim, or guttatim, obtained and produced; and when any do
come forth, how is it that they are so void of expected and necessitated
strength and corroboration for their work intended (or rather, by some, but
deceitfully pretended? But only by reason (as it is Vox populi, which men
commonly say, is Vox Dei.) that those disaffected Members especially of the
Honorable House of Commons do so craftily and vigilantly watch their own
seasonable opportunities (by the improvident and sometimes, I confess,
necessitated absence, and thereby paucity, too often, of the honest and truly
pious and zealous, Presbyterian party, either to null them, or at least, to
delay, obstruct, and invalidate them, and to make them of little or no solid
use, when they come forth unto us? Wherein, also, (which fetches a most just
and deep figh from my soul) the known Independents are not a little, backed and
abetted (a most foul shame to be spoken of them) by many who formerly (at
least in show) were clearly for us; but, now a-dayes (though we believe; not
properly principled the Schismeticall-way yet) are mightily biased, wheeled
and blown about (I know not by what unhappy fate, or flate of wind, unless,
as I hear and (...) a Golden-ayre or Silver-blast) in voting and acting for
the (...) almost, on all occasions; who they are, I spare to name, though I
could, many of them, Et digito monstrare quod his est; but, they themselves
best know, and are conscious to their own hearts of this their great evil of
so unworthy doubling Tergiversation; and though we pity and pray for their
Souls, yet they may and must be assured, we look upon their persons with very
sore-eyes and sour faces. Great and grave Senators of England (I speak to the
truly pious Presbyterian party thereof in both Houses) I beseech you, for the
Lords sake, think often and earnestly on that faithful (for, heaven and earth
shall perish before one jot or title of Gods Word shall not come to pass) yea
think upon, even with trembling, that fearful threatening of the Lord our God,
Jerem. 48, 19. (which also, I have formerly made serious use of in another
piece of mine, entitled, Instices Plea.) Cursed be he that does the work of
the Lord negligently (or, deceitfully, as some translations notably render it)
and cursed is he that withholdeth his sword from blood. Yea, I say, from blood,
when the Lord requires it, even the blood of Blasphemers, and bloody
Malignants, especially in these our late and most lamentable lawless Wars, on
the Royal Party; for then, to spare, is so far from Piety or pity, that it
is egregious impiety to God and our sacred Covenant, and Diabolical cruelty
against men; yea and a most dangerous hazarding of the ruin of your own lives,
if not of Parliament, State, and the whole Kingdom, as Ahab for sparing
Benhadad, and Saul for sparing Agagg, found it too true; and we may justly
fear the like, when such (whom God has appointed to death) live so confident
(and that, not without cause) that the bitterness of the fear of death is
over past with them; and all by reason of the strange Impunity of the bloody
Impiety, even of grand Offenders of all sorts to this very day. There was a
time (I must and do ingeniously confess) when the great (and, then very just)
apology and plea of our great and wise Parliamentary Master- Builders, why the
work of Reformation, in Religion (for I desire mainely to harp upon this
string, as the summum, though I will not say, Vnicum necessarium) and speedier
building of Gods House, Church Discipline went not on more soundly and
seriously, was, That the prudence and providence of the Parliament must, first,
see to the very being, before the well being of the Kingdom which then indeed,
was in continual hazard of ruin and destruction by the great hostile powers
on the Kings party; True, I easily and willingly grant this: But, now that the
Lord has most graciously banished those our great and just fears, has like
dust, dispelled our enemies, and given us opportunity (even ever since the
ruin of Sir Jacob Ashleys forces, and the rendition of Oxford) to build our
own houses in most sweet security (and which we do indeed, with both hands,
but scarcely care to build Gods House with one hand) O what, now hinders this
best and most blessed work? but, only and unquestionably, these Parliamentary
Schismatics, these our mere pretending Master Builders, who prove indeed, the
main-molesters of it? And, dare they indeed, call and count themselves Master-
Builders, and yet, still, are the principal causes that Gods house must either
lie wast (as much as in them is) as being most unwilling (some of them) that we
should have any Government at all; or at best, now and then permit it to be
patch't up with such poor pieces (as I touched before) as rather amaze us with
sorrow to see, than animate us with any just comfort to enjoye; whereof, I said
before, truly, I know no greater ground, or unquestionable cause to complain
(next to our gross ingratitude to God for so great a good as is Opportunity,
now so long and so fairly offered us, but so loosly and lazily, if not lewdly
abused by us) than the intolerable (I had almost said the inexpiable) impiety
of the impunity of our unsufferable Schismatics and Sectaries, especially the
admitting and tollerating of men disaffected to Church discipline, at the
Fountain head, whereby all the streams of justice and equity, thence issuing
into City or Country, are lamentably poisoned and polluted (a thing most worthy
of unexpressible punishment) and thus suffering Independents to sit in such
prime places of Judicature, and in Parliamentary, and Country Committees, to
the most strange and strong obstruction and impeding of all our hopes or
happiness from our most renowned Parliament, in general, even the pious
Presbiterian-party thereof in both the most Honorable Houses. Well, though
these our disaffect Pretenders smooth up themselees, and wipe their lips with
an All is well with them; yet let them give me leave to tell them one thing'
to their just shame and sorrow of Soul (if it may be) and that is; what a
Heathen Prince has pronounced against them, and it is backed also with Scripture
authority and approbation; viz. That honest-hearted King (of a Heathen,) King
Darius, into whose heart, the Lord having put a resolution to forward the
building of Gods House at Jerusalem; Ezra, 6. Which work had been much opposed
and impeded by the enemies thereof, yet, now I say, the King having resolved
that the work should be seriously set upon, and that none should hinder it; the
Text says, ver. 11. He made a Decree that whosoever should go about or
endiavour to alter the Kings word, therein, the timber of his house should be
pulled down, and a Gibbet should be made thereof, and he to be destroyed and
hanged thereon; and that his house should be made a jaxe, or dunghill, for
this; even for daring to be so bold and impious as to offer to hinder the work
of building of Gods House. Mark this, O all ye Schismaticall-spirits, who, now
adays, so impiously and audaciously have so long and lewdly endeavored to
hinder the building of Gods House, among us in England, even the glorious work
of Reformation in Religion, the settlement of the purity of Doctrine, and of the
godly order and holy harmony of Church Discipline. Hear it, I say, and tremble
at it, and be ashamed to hear a heathen-King so zealous for God (and you to
be so cold) and so justly to pronounce your deserved punishment; and take heed
least the Lord, the righteous judge (if too long and impenitently provoked by
you) even for this, this great Sin of thus impeding and opposing the blessed
work of a thorough Reformation among us be most severely revenged on you. And
let me tell you al my dear brethren in general, both one and another, and my
self too; never let us think it is possible that our temporal affairs of full
trading, paying of the Kingdoms debts, ease of excise, and other tedious
taxations, freedom from fears of new wars and commotions among our selves, the
total disbanding of our Armies, dismantling of Garrisons, and sueh like
desired national comforts shall thrive and prosper or answer our hopes and
expectations, so long as Religion in its power and purity is so slighted, Gods
faithful and painful Ministers are so wickedly denied, not only honorable,
but even competent maintenance, and are, besides, so scorned and abused, and so
long as Gods House, Church Discipline, is so strangely neglected and delayed,
and all sorts of Schisms, Erronrs, Heresies, and most blasdhemous Opinions are
with such accursed and most impious impunity permitted among us, and
especially, I say, that horrid and kingdom confounding sin of, thus, most
fearfully violating our sacred and solemn Covenant with our God, wherein, with
deep attestations and protestations, holding up our hands and lifting up our
hearts to the high God of heaven, we vowed the utter ruinating and extirpating
of all those forementioned sores, evils, and plague provoaking crying-crimes,
yea, and whatsoever else was contrary to the power of Godliness. Touching
which Covenant, hear me but one word more (o all ye of the Schismatic
generation, in general) concerning your most unconscionable and double
dealing, and deluding of us therein also, and then I shall hasten to the maine
thing I aim at in this discourse, which is, that having so conspicuously and
evidently laid open the heart grinding and grieving Sore and Core of the
kingdoms present and pressing sorrow; I may also humbly make bold to tender
the application of a Plaisture, which (I humbly conceive) is most likely (by
Gods blessing) to make an undoubted comfortable cure thereof; but, to the thing
in hand.

In the days of rare Queen Elizabeth, of ever blessed memory, and so along, to
later times, we all know, or have heard, how the crafty Romish Jesuits, having
found by long experience, that their tying up of the Consciences of their
Popish-Proselytes from taking the Oath of Supremacy, and from receiving the
Sacrament of the Lords Supper with us Protestants (whom, you know, they called
and counted Heretics) proved a great prejudice to the progress and growth of
their great design, Universal Papall-Monarchy: at last, they grew so cunning
and crafty, that, for the advancement and propagating of the Catholic Cause
(as they called it) they would give dispensations, (by the Popes indulgences)
to take that Oath, and to Communicate with us, in the Lords Supper also, if
they were put unto it, rather, I say, than to hinder their other dark and
devilish design. And is it not just thus with our palpable and
Jesuiticall-Spirited Independents and Sectaries, that generation of Iuglers (if
ever there were any in the world) now adays among us: I mean mainly the
subtle Seducers, and learned Ringleaders of them; for, was there not a time
(and that, not long time agone) when their novell and most nauseous
upstart-Schisme began, first, to rise and grow up among us; that, O, then,
for an Independent, a Separatist, or Sectary to be put to the taking of our
sacred and solemn Covenant, O, it was most tart and terrible, and would by no
means be endured by them, but they startled at it, and flew from it, as from a
hideous Hobgobling, or a Noli me tangere. But, now, of later times, and in
these our more moderene days, they also having like the Ingling Jesuits)
craftily and cunningly found by practice and experience, that this Bolt was
like to shut them out of the Parliament, Conutry-Committees and other eminent,
gainful, graceful, and over-awing places, both Martial and Majesteriall:
they now, therefore (just, I say, like the Jesuits of Rome) for the propagation
of their Cacolick Cause also, I mean, Tolleration of All-Religions, and
diabolical and accursed Liberty of Conscience, alias, most profane
Libertinisme; do most dissemblingly, falsely and fraudulently using the said
Sacred Covenant, as those Jesuits did the Sacred Scriptures, only as a Nose of
wax, or a Sailors Breechs, to help them in a storm, or at a dead-lift) give
selfe-dispensation of Liberty to their Consciences to submit to the taking
thereof, as well, and readily (to see to) as the best of us all, but, still,
with the Jesuits old tacite-trick of Equivacation or mentall-Reservation,
taking it in their own-sense, as most malevolently hating the litterall and
genuine sense thereof, and the positive and plain intentions and ends of the
Parliament in general, in the Covenant; as is, and long has been apparent by
their practices and professions also both by word and pen, among us, not only
in the Parliamentary and Country-Committees, but also, and most especially, in
the Army, where, most Insolently and audaciously (as was touched before) the
Commanders, Officers, and Soldiers slight, reject, and scorn all Ordinances of
Parliament, yea and the very Covenant it self, as it relates to
Church Government, especially, and suppression of Errors, Schisms, and
Blasphemies; yea not withstanding that some of them pretend they have taken the
Covenant, which must needs show and assure us most undoubtedly in what sense,
and with what Conscience, and to what ends they took it. The serious
consideration whereof makes me, here also, to fetch another deep sigh for his
Excellency Sir Tho. Fairfax, who of late, has not a little overclouded and
eclipsed the former radiant luster, and most specious splendour of his (then)
justly merited Fame and Honor, both by some late strange miscarriages in the
Army in general, and also in so improvidently, and (doubtless) insnaredly
admitting and entertaining, as his chief Chaplains for the Army, two dangerous
and audacious Soul-seducing Schismatics, as Mr. Dell, and Mr. Saltmarsh,
together with their bold and blustering brother Peter's, who are most pernicious
and pestilent instruments to infect and poison the whole Army, if it be
possible, with their seditious and damnable Doctrins: by which deceitful
design of theirs, (I say) forementioned in thus taking the Covenant, they most
Satanically keep-up, and drive-on their own hopeful and underhand mischeivous
Machinations, and thereby also mightily molest, obstruct and retard, almost all
our pious Presbyterian-Actings accor: ding to our Conscience and Covenant, as
the fear of the Lord (whose vows are upon us) do most importunately command
us, and our fervent and deeply obliged love to Truth and Peace does constantly
constrain us. And thus we see (to our sad sighing, indeed,) that no bands,
nor bounds will hold or keep in these vild and wild Beasts, but that most
craftily and unconscionably they break through all, and we have now (therefore)
but one only way (under God alone) which is the last and maine thing I aim at
in this discourse, to help our selves out of the tearing and tyring troubles of
these Briars and Brambles, our Sectaries and Schismatics; and that (I humbly
conceive) is only this, and it is backed also with a fresh and experienced
pregnant example among our selves, some few years past, which is, as follows.

There was (as we all well remember, at the beginning of this present
Parliament) a great Complaint (and that, not without great and just cause)
against Popish Lords and Prelates, sitting in the House of Peers, and of
rotten-hearted Malignant Members in the House of Commons, who, in those times,
mightily molested and obstructed the most weighty and great affairs of the
Parliament, and so consequently perturbed the good of the whole kingdom,
especially, then also, in matters of Religion, and due execution of Justice
upon offenders: whereupon the most famous and ever to be honored and renowned
City of London bravely began to Petition the Parliament for the expulsion of
them out of both Honses, and immediately thereupon, almost all the
well-affected Counties of the kingdom followed their worthy example, and most
eagerly and earnestly fell a petitioning against them, and continually came
flocking up to London to the Parliament in most numerous and mighty multitudes,
to that purpose, yea and so importunately pressed their desires therein, till at
last, by Gods wonderful providence, and the Parliaments most favorable
acceptance of their Petitions, and (so far, then from calling or accounting it
a breach of Privilege of Parliament, that) they gave them all great thanks for
their Love and Zeal therein: And all these things thus concurring together
struck (as it was apparent) such terror and amazement into the hearts of the
Popish-Lords, Prelates and Malignants in both Houses, that speedily upon it
(partly by the Prelates own remarkable pride and folly, and partly by an
univerfall Conscience-accusing fright and terror at these things) both Houses
of Parliament were most admirably freed of them; and all things, thereupon,
presently after, were carried on most prosperously, and with singular smooth
success, to the great comfort and universal high content of the whole
kingdom, (and so continued a long time after) until these present crafty
Sectarian Mombers unhappily crept into the house of Commons, and others have
since been poisoned by them. And have not We (my dear Presbyterian Brethren,
for, to you, now I apply this my main and most earnest desire) in these our
days, as great and just cause (considering all I have already said before, and
much more that might be said therein) as ardently and earnestly to complain,
protest, and petition against some disaffected Lords in the House of Peers,
and against many Independent Members in the House of Commons, who (next to our
own sins) are the main, if not only, restless Remora's, and most dangerous
disturbers and delayers, yea mockers and deluders of our Covenantengaged
Reformation, to Gods most high dishonor, the most justly incensing of his
devouring-wrath against us, and the deep heart-wounding grief and sorrow of
all the truly pious and peaceable people throughout the whole kingdom, by
reason of their hopes thus unhappily damped and delayed, yea, I say, jeered and
abused by those Sectaries and Schismatics in the House of Commons. Slight not
(I beseech you, my dear Presbyterian-Brethren, both in City and Country) this
my serious, and I hope seasonable advice, by supine security in regard of the
present seeming serenity of things, which has been the bane of many famous and
flourishing States and Commonweals; and yet (all things considered) we have
little cause to conceit so of the present times. But, if they were so, yet know
that I have read, long since, in Plutarch's Lives of a Governor of Thebes or
Athens (if my memory much fail me not) to whom a faithful friend of his sent
a Letter wherein was the discovery of a dangerous plot against him and his
City, which was intended to be attempted on him that very ensuing night on
which his Letter came to him the immediate evening before to have prevented the
danger of it, had it been timely taken: But he (being a deboyst drunken Prince,
notwithstanding that the messenger told him his Mr. desired the speedy reading
of it, and return of his answer) presently put the Letter into his pocket, and
only returned this answer; Res seriae ad crastinum; Weighty matters to morrow.
But, that very night the Design was set upon, his enemies suddenly brake in
upon him, slew this Prince in his bed, and surprised his City. Take heed
timely, therefore, I say, and beartily pray you, my dear Brethren, of
slighting this my coun sell; our danger is, undoubtedly, very great, and I know
not how near it is (yea and who knows what a day or a night may bring forth)
though for the present, things seem fair and clear about us, as here you
heard it in this foresaid pertinent and applicable example. The King, himself
(Proh dolor) stands out still (and for my part, I cannot much wonder at him,
therein, he being so mightily animated thereunto by Sectaries and Schismatics
who pleading for Liberty of Conscience, stand out boldly against the
Parliament, and will use what kind of worship and serving God they please, yea
and are extremely connived at, and to lerated therein: And why may not King
Charles also plead for and be permitted the Liberty of his Conscience, and be
tolerated to have his Prelaticall Chaplains (as now also the Sectaries in the
Army have already begun pretty fairly to give the King all this, and promise
and pretend much more, till they have their wills of him) and allowance of his
Common Prayer Book, and refuse to be directed, in Gods worship, by our
Directory, and resuse to hear our pious preachers, as well as our Sectaries and
Schismatics, who familiarly resuse both, yea, almost, all of ours; running
into houses and corners to practice what they please in matters of Religion?
Why may not King Charles, I say, expect thus much liberty of Conscience, and,
as I said before, be, thus, hardened by our means to stand out stillmost stiffly
against us; besides, Malignant-Royalists grow thick and numerous within our
City and adjacent Countries round about us; bloodyminded Anabaptists, and such
like seditious Schismatics, as cruelly as craftily, yea as vigorously as
viruently do drive on their designs among us, especially that of intolerable
Toleration, and accursed Liberty of Conscience, against all godly Government
and religious Order, wherein the most desperate Atheists and Malignants (for
the present) join and combine most eagerly with them; yea, our own hoped
friends, within us, grow mightily disconetnted, and mutinously-minded (witness
Smithfields late firy-uproare at the strange miscarriage of things in the
Parliament, and continued taxations on the poorer sort of people; and thou, o
loyal London, the Kingdoms most famous and magnificent Metropolis, art in as
great danger of sudden distress, as ever, if occafion (which the Lord in his
great mercy forbid) be mischeivously offered, thy grandest Guard (under God)
the City Militia, being for the greatest part of it (notwithstanding all thy
petitioning about it) even to this day (according to that Apologue of the poor
Sheep Mastives committed to the keeping and custody of Wolves and Foxes) I
mean, in known Sectaries and notorious Schismatics and Neutralls hands and
commands, in whom thou can not with any clear safety trust or confide. And
therefore again and again, I humbly and heartily beseech you, whom it, thus,
mainly concerns, timely to look about you, and to be advised, as you tender
your lives, Wives and Children, Peace and Prosperity; yea, your All that is
most precious to you, even your pure Religion especially, your sacred Covenant,
Countries Liberties and just Freedoms; and speedily take some honest, lawful,
and laudable importunate course by Petitioning, and soliciting even without
denial, for the timely calling into the House of Commons, of all the pious and
loyal Presbyterian Members, and especially of the insufferably abused, because
most injuriously and slanderously accused 11. Members, if they be not come in
already, and for the serious expunging and expelling of known and pernicious
pragmaticall Sectaries out of both Houses of Parliament, as being the maine, if
not only causes (as I have most abundantly shown) of all our present and most
pressing, yea oppressing fears, and growing and groaning Calamities.

Object. But, here, if any object (as, indeed, it has been objected to me
already, upon occasion of this very motion of mine, in private) that, though
Sir, we acknowledge your counsel is good and pertinent to our condition; yet,
we believe it is not (now) so feazable and seasonable in regard of the times and
the general disaffectednesse of most men, and the present policy and power of
the Independents in the Parliament and elsewhere?

Answ. To all which I answer, first, who drove out the Popish-Lords, Prelates,
and other Malignant-Members (far more firmly fastened and rivetted in among
us, even by a Law, although Such (which Independents are not, as Such) both in
Parliament and in all other parts of the Kingdom, than these our Parliamentary
Jndependents are, or, I trust, ever shall or can be) who, I say, thrust and
threw these out of both Houses of Parliament? Was it not the Lord God himself,
by his special blessing on the unanimous confluence of importunate
Petitioners, protesting against them from all parts of the Kingdom? Even the
Lord our God, who is yesterday, and to day, and the same for ever, and can any
thing be impossible for him to bring to pass, who, within these six years
last past, has all along, done, almost, all things miraculously for us, which
we knew not how to have done for our selves? Take but this one example hereof;
did not the Lord beyond our expectation (even to our just admiration) make the
Prelates themselves (in a special manner) by their proud Protestation against
the Parliaments just proceedings, and their Petitioning to the King for his
protecting of them against the power of the Parliament) to overthrow and throw
themselves out of the Parliament, even into imprisonment in the Tower of
London? And are not our Sectaries of these days, think you, as spiritually,
yea and carnally proud and ambitious too as ever the Prelates were in their
generation? and are they not every way as pernicious and pestilentiall to
Church and State, and many of them most illegally and abusively elected and
shuffled in to be Members of the House? Secondly, for our great, yea, exceeding
great encouragement herein, has not the Lord (upon occasion of the late solemn
Fast over the whole kingdom, against Heresies and Schisms, voted in Parl.
Feb. 4, 1646, and religiously performed and kept accordingly March 10th, then
next ensuing) put into the hearts of the most religious and renowned Lords and
Commons in Parliament, to renew, and as I may say, revow, and publish to the
whole world (to Gods high honor, and our unexpressible comfort) their cordial
and zealous detestation of Heresies, Schisms, and Blasphemous Opinions,
together with their religious resolution peremptorily to proceed agaidst them;
and for fuller satisfaction herein, I will give the Reader, their one words, in
that most excellent Ordinance of theirs, worthy to be engraven by us in fair
Characters of Gold; which were, as follows.

Die Jovis, Febr. 4, 1646.
An Ordinance of the Lords and Commons in Parliament assombled, concerning the
growth and spreading of Errors, Heresies, and Blasphemies, setting apart a day
of publik Humiliation, to seek Gods assistance for the suppressing and
preventing the same.
THE Lords and Commons assembled in the Parliament of England having entered
into a solemn-Covenant, to endeavor, sincerely, really and constantly the
Reformation of Religion, in Doctrine, Discipline, and Worship, and the
extirpation of Popery, Superstition, Heresy, Schism, Profaneness, and
whatsoever shall be found contrary to sound Doctrine, and the power of
godliness; and having found the presence of GOD wonderfully assisting us in
this cause, especially since our engagement in pursuance of the said Covenant:
Have thought it fit (least we partake in other men's sins, and thereby be in
danger to receive of their plagues) to set forth this our deep sense of the
great dishonor of God, and perilous condition that this kingdom is in,
through the abominable blasphemies (mark their zealous expressions here) and
damnable Heresies vented and spread abroad therein, tending to the subverssion
of the faith, contempt of the Ministry, and Ordinances of Jesus Christ: And as
we are resolved to employ and improve the utmost of our power that nothing be
said or done against the Truth, but for the Truth; so we desire that both our
selves, and the whole kingdom may be deeply humbled before the Lord, for that
great reproach and contempt which has been cast upon his Name and saving
Truths, and for that swift destruction which we may justly fear will fall upon
the immortal souls of such who are, or may be drawn away by giving heed to
seducing Spirits. In the hearty and tender compassion whereof, We the said
Lords and Commons do order and ordain that Wednesday being the 10th day of
March next, to be set apart for a day of public Humiliation for the growth and
spreading of Errors, Heresies and Blasphemies, to be observed in all places
within the kingdom of England, and dominion of Wales, and town of Berwick, and
to seek to God for his direction and assistance for the suppression and
preventing the same. And all Ministers are hereby enjoined to publish this
present Ordinance upon the Lords day preceding the said 10th of March.

See, hence, then may dear Presbyterian Brethren, first, as I touched before, if
here be not singular encouragement unto you all in City and Country, to set
seriously and speedily upon this work of modest and lawful petitioning, as a
foresaid. Secondly, whether you are not most likely to receive kind acceptance,
in so doing, and thanks for your pains and care therein. And thirdly, (if the
Parliamentary Independents hinder not, as they are most likely to be the main,
if not only, obstacles therein) what unquestionable good and desired success
(as by this excellent Ordinance may easily be gathered) is likely to follow
thereon. And fourthly, and lastly, consider from all the foresaid premises,
thus, now put together, whether all truly pious Protestants and Presbyterians
over the whole kingdom have not as great and just cause to bend all their
zeal and combined power of Petitioning aginst the Sectaries and Schismatics
in Parliament (as the unquestionable causes of the great growth of all the
Errors and Schisms among us; and as the most unhappy obstructers and
hinderers of the most long and zealously desired building and settlement of the
Presbyterian Church Government) as ever they had against Papists, Prelates, or
Royall-Malignants? Which, if they see not, certainly they are wilfully blind,
or if seeing, yet are basely content, willingly, to yield to a most ignominious
and slavish security and Laodiceanluke-warmnesse to the unexpressible misery
that inevitably accompanyes the being justly spued out of Gods presence and
protection of love, by most lewdly allowing a most abominable Toleration of
all religions, and so by an unquestionable consequence of having no religion
among us, and then also no God to help us. O, then, that it would please the
Lord to put into the hearts of his honest and heroic Servants both in City and
Country, now again, most stoutly and strenuously to show their godly zeal and
faithful fervor of Spirit against those enemies of our Covenant in this the
Churches as great necessity and importunity, as ever it was in, with a joint
and unanimous consent (as then they most happily and honorably did, and that
with singular approbation and commendation of both Houses of Parliament, and
with desired success too) to petition Both Houses (in a warrantable, modest,
fair, and befitting manner) for the removeall of the persons of such
Parliamentary Independents out of their Houses, as are the known fautors and
favorers of all Schismatic Covenant-contemners and Ordinance violaters, in
reference to their contempt and obstructing of the Presbyterial
Church Government and power of godliness, even as perniciously and impiously
(though more clandestinely and craftily) as ever the Popish Lords, Prelates or
Malignants formerly were in their way; and therein most invincibly to endeavor
the just exonerating of our souls of the kingdoms great and groaning
spiritual grievances (the best way of all others to remove all our temporal
disturbances also) in the unsufferable abuses both of God and man among us,
even the intolerable growth and spurious spreading of blasphemies, heresies,
errors, and schisms, together with the most abominable impunity of the
Broachers and Abettors of them, and for the holy and happy compassing and
completing of one of the maine ends of our sacred Covenant with our God, and
with our most loyal and loving brethren of Scotland, namely, the solid and
substantial settling of the Presbyterian Church Discipline, according to the
word of God, and the example of the best Reformed-Churches. And, O that it
might please the Lord, (who has the hearts of all men in his hands, and who can
most easily turn them as the Rivers of water) to put into the hearts of our
most renowned, noble, and precious Patriots, the unbyassed and honorable
Presbyterian friends of Truth and pious Peace, in Both Houses of Parliament,
who (cordially and christianly casting away all ignoble selfeseeking aims and
interests) do religiously and conscientiously cohere and correspond, with sound
and settled judgments and resolutions, to set up Christ's kingdom, according
to the Apostolical institution in Gods word, to be happy and honorable means
(for the more smooth and certain carrying on of this said blessed business)
to purge (if it be possible) Both their Houses in general, and inparticular,
of al Committees, from such incompetent and unequal judges as Sectaries and
Independents are (who ever they be) from sitting in such seats of Judicature,
to hear, overrule, vote and determine such weighty Causes, as are matters of
Religion and Church-Reformation, as, wherein, they themselves are so faulty and
offensive, yea devoted enemies to the Church and Children of God, in point of
Godly-Government and Church Discipline: wherein, that the Lord, the great God
of wisdom, the only guider of every good action, and the only giver of every
good gift, would direct and erect the hearts of our truly pious Parliamentary
Patriots and sound Presbyterian Lords and Commons, with profound wisdom,
impregnable fortitude of Spirit, and invincible Christian Courage, impartially
and efficaciously to vote, act, and execute (in pursuance also of their most
excellent and religious Ordinance against the growth of damnable errors and
blasphemies, forementioned) in the first place, to remove those sorely
offensive rubs and Remora's out of their Houses, which thus have and do (and
till they be removed, unquestionably will) most sadly interrupt, impede and
retard the so much and so long desired glorious work of Reformation, it is, and
ever shall be a special part of my most serious and incessant prayers: That,
so, this being at length holily and happily effected, Judgment may run down
in our streets like waters, and Righteousness as a mighty and strong stream.
That, so, our God may [in Christ] take pleasure in us, and delight to do us
good, all our days, and to our succeeding Posterity after us, Amen.

A Postscript.
CHristian Reader, I have thought fit (in this last place) to desire thee to
take serious notice (but not without a most deep sigh from thy Soul) that
whereas the Parliament intended (as we then hoped) to have done some great and
remarkable work, for the just impeding of the growth of blasphemous Errors,
Schisms, and Heresies among us, as is most abundantly evident by that most
excellent Ordinance of the 4th of March, 1646, forementioned; yet
(notwithstanding that Ordinance, and the solemn day of Humiliation kept over
the whole kingdom the 10th. of March following) nothing has been done
therein, ever since, which is now above 5. Months past; but, contrariwise a
most foul and filthy greater growth and increase of them, in all parts and
places of the kingdom, without the least control or restraint by any
authority. O consider, I beseech thee (good Reader) in the fear of the Lord,
what a horrid and hideous face of most abominable hypocrysie and dissimulation
does this neglect therein represent to the Lord our God, and the whole world,
unto our everlasting indelible shame! And, whence, my Christian Brethren, can
you possibly conceive this most black sin has its rise and original, but
mainly, if not only, from the Sectaries in our Parliament, who, as we have
apparently seen, all along, have, without all question, most strongly and
strangely, and yet most craftily and cunningly crossed and crushed all motions and
means of carrying on this or any other weighty work of Reformation among us?
And will not our God be avenged on such a genearation as this? And, shall they
prosper, shall they escape, or shall they be delivered that do such things, and
that (thus) break their Covenant with their God? Ezekiel, 17.15, 16.

FINIS.
