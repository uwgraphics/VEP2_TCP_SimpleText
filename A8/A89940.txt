The New ART of THRIVING Or, The way to GET and KEEP MONEY: Being a Seasonable
Caution against the Extravagances of these Times, Containing sixteen Excellent
Rules and Observations for Promoting Good Husbandry, and Banishing Idleness and
Profuseness, the certain Parents of Poverty; with a Table of Expenses:
Principally intended for an Admonition to Youth but necessary to be practiced
by All Persons in these hard Times, and to be set up in every Family.
THough Complaints of Poverty and Scarcity of Money are unhappily become no
less general than lamentable; so that wherever we go, our Ears are assaulted
with the sad Rhetoric of Beggary; and our Eyes with deplorable objects of
pity: yet must it be acknowledged, That we rail Impertinent^y at the hardness
of the Times, since it is our selves that make them ^uch; men generally by Sloth
or Vanity, Pride, Negligence, or Ex^ravagancy, twisting those Chains of
necessity wherein they lie En^angled; wherefore since Diseases are not cured
with our Cries, nor Miseries redrest by Lamentations, let every one wipe his
Eyes and make use of his Head and his Hands to preserve or recover himself but
of the Quagmire of Want: It being certain that still every man in Health and
Strength, may forge himself out a Fortune by Industry and Frugality, and obtain
(though not a splendid yet) a comfortable Subsistence.

The general Cause of Poverty, is either Profuseness, or not Improving those
Talents God has lent us: Of the first kind, we may reckon up,

I. One to be Gaudy in Apparel, and we will rank it first, because it is most
visible; How do many Shipwreck their Credits and score vast sums in Silk-mens,
Mercers, Drapers, Tailors, or Semstrisses Books; only to follow some foolish
New Fashion, and make hemselves rediculous Apes; or at best but like the
Cynamon Tree, whose bark is more worth than its body: when a thrifty wise
person can accouter himself with good, decent and creditable Apparel for half
or a third part of the others charge. Can our best-studied Fashion-mongers tell
us what use there is of Perriwigs or Lace^ands of six, seven, or eight pounds,
nay forty or fifty pounds a ^and? Or of such dawbing of Coats or Petticoats
with Gold Lace, ^^r Silver Points of Five or Eight pound the dozen, merely to
dan^le at their Knees? Persons that have the Kernel of Wisdom and Magnanimity,
seldom give much regard to the Shell of Gaudy Apparel; and a Gentleman in a
plain Cloth Suit, well made, may de^ently appear in the presence of the
greatest Monarch in Christen^ome.

II. A Liquorish Tooth, or Extravagant Diet: What waste do ^^ur young Gallants
make at their Treats at Tavern or French Or^^^aries? I have known three or four
of them spend Forty or Fifty ^^illings a piece, for a Dinner or Supper; when
two dishes of seven (...) eight shillings price, had been as pleasant, and much
more nou^^shing and wholesome. No less vain is extravagancy in ordinary
Housekeeping, variety of dishes does but oppress nature and di^^urb digestion:
the belly never balances Accounts. What madness (...) it therefore to keep
such a stir to gratify it? especially where all ^^^ngs are to be bought in by
the penny, and Servants are trusted (...) be our Purveyors.

III. Drinking, or (as they nickname it) Good fellowship, is not ^^ly a shrewd
drainer of the Purse, but a great Consumer of Time, ^^ereby causing neglect of
business, and many times rendering one in^^pable of doing any thing some days
after: besides it weakens the ^ody, impairs the Intellectuals, brings into Ill
company, ruins ones ^^edit, and leads to a thousand inconveniences: for what
folly, mis^^ief, or villainy will not a man engage in when he is drunk? See
(...) to Drunkards.

IV. Courting of Women; Experienced Solomon calls a Whore a ^^ep ditch, and
certainly who ever follows her Enticements, though ^^s way seem paved with
Delight, treads to paths of Destruction: ^^d though he have never so plentiful
an Estate, shall in short time, ^^d emptiness in his Purse, rottenness in his
bones, horror in his ^onscience, and infamy entailed upon his memory: Nor is it
any ^her than a foolish vanity to treat any Women often at Extraordi^ary
Expenses; for if they be Virtuous, they will not expect it, if otherwise, they
do not deserve it.

V. Gaming, is the Highway to Beggars Bush; a bewitching ^anity; that will not
suffer a man to keep his money in his pocket; ^^thout putting it to the hazard
of a Throw, whether it shall conti^ue his own, or be another. I have known a
poor Citizen so besot^^d with this itch of Shaking the Elbow, that no sooner
could he (...) Half a Piece or a Piece, but away he must go, till he had played
it ^y every farthing; though his poor wife and half a dozen small ^^ildren were
ready in the mean while to starve for want of bread: (...) himself glad to
drink water or Small Beer, for a fortnight after.

VI. Suretiship, has been an Eminent Gulf to swallow fair E^^s; so much the
more lamentable, because it falls upon persons ^he best nature; easily
inveigled by Crafty Knaves to Engage for ^^r own Debts, which they never intend
to pay themselves. That (...) Emblem I have seen, was very significant in such
Cases; of a ^^k gallant young Heir, sliding down the great end of a Hunters
^^rn with ease; but cruelly pinched and tattered at the coming ^^h at the small
end; with one of his brother foolls standing hard (...) laughing at him; and
this Motto, Facilis desensus Averni,
At revocare gradum, etc.
It Is easy into Hell to fall,
But to get back from thence is all.


VII. Trusting to servants, We use to say, The Eye of the master ^^kes the
Horse fat; Sure I am, the not having an Eye to Servants, ^ll make his Purse
Lean, what with Idleness, Waste, and Embezle^ents, he will find a sensible
Consumption in his Estate if he do not well examine their accounts, and
continually suspect their doings.

VIII. In short whoever would Thrive, must continually have an eye to
Frugality, a virtue that is the Root of all Liberality: For that by retrenching
unnecessary Expenses, avoiding much Buying, continual borrowing, superfluous
buildings, vexatious Law-sui^s for trifles, chargeable Recreations, and
expensive Studies, as the Philosophers Stone, or the like; preserves and
maintains a plentiful Estate: which not only renders the owners life
comfortable, but also serves as a Spring, whence he can send forth streams of
Bounty upon any necessary occasion; which Prodigality would soon dry up, and
leave him miserable in himself and useless to others: Thus sings the witty
Randolph,

Spare not, nor spend too much, be this thy care,
Spare but to spend, and only spend to spare:
Who spends too much, may want and so complain;
But he spends best, that spares to spend again.
IX. Defects of Improving what we have, are either by Sloth, one of the
greatest baits the Devil has to all kind of wickedness; He that will not work,
deserves not to eat, by the Apostles Rule: Remember the end of the Sluggard is
miserable Beggary. Be curious sometimes to see the morning Star draw the
Curtain of the day, or behold the Sun in Summer scatter glories as he climbs
over the Eastern Hills. What a shame it is to spend half ones lifetime in
Dreams and Slumbers; Leave your bed therefore when first sleep has left you,
lest custom renders your body sluggish; or (what is worse) your mind a Cage of
unclean thoughts.

Account no labor slavery,
If honest gain accrue thereby.
X. Man is born to labor, as the sparks fly upwards; says Job: And as he
shall only fill his throat with Air, that sits lazily expecting Fortune to drop
an Estate from the Clouds into his mouth, when it can only be attained by the
care of a Vigilant Head, and sweat of a laborious brow; so it is a most foolish
proud humor, to continue in a wretched, sharking, necessitous condition,
rather than embrace any honest Employment, that might be adventagious, merely
because it is not so neat and genteel as he would have it: just as if a
condemned Malefactor should refuse a gracious Reprieve, because it is not
brought him in a silver box, or by the hands of a Privy Counselor.

XI. The Serious Spanyard when he would bestow the bitterest Curse upon an
Enemy, is wont to wish, he may be a Beggar when he is old. And truly there can
scarce be a greater misery in this life, than to be then in want, when all the
faculties both of mind and body being disabled to labor for supplying our
necessities; leave us not so much as hope ever to raise our selves again. The
consideration of which, should effectually warn All, whilst Youth and strength
last, not to trifle them away in Vanity or Debauchery: but endeavor to lay up
something as a Reserve for Gray Hairs, or a Bed of Sickness: not to speak of a
thousand other Cross Accidents that happening suddenly, may utterly ruin a
person, if he be not a little before hand in the world. Most true is the
Proverb, In Summer of Youth, take pains with the Ant,
Or in Winter of Age, live poor and in want.


XII. The general means of Thriving, are for a man to be diligent, Nulla dies
sine linea, always employed in some honest Calling, or designs suitable to his
condition, advantagions in themselves, and feasible for him to accomplish; to
be vigilant, and way-lay opportunities: there being undoubtedly some offered in
the course of every man's life, that they may make him reasonable happy, if he
have but the wit to nick them luckily. Add to this a wariness in his Expenses
and Bargainings, buying if possibly with ready money; preserving his Credit, by
keeping touch when he appoints any payments: Affability and obliging Carriage
to all in matters that cannot damnifie him: but to avoid engagements for any to
his prejudice; nor to concern himself in others matters; not to go to Law but
upon necessity; then first to take good advice on his case, and afterward to
prosecute it with all imaginable Vigor; that so the success may make others
afraid to contend with him unjustly. Besides all this, discreetly for to wive,
Is held by wisemen a main help to thrive.


XIII. I am not ignorant with what clamor the Libertines of the Age decry that
Sacred Institution; but those that think Wedlock so insupportable a Yoke, may
fancy their Garters to be Shackles, and their Bands Halters. I fear not many
have received so fully the Gift of Continence, as to observe a Single life with
a pure and inviolated Chastity (thrice happy are those that can) but if they do
fly out, most certain I am, besides the wounds to their Soul it is no small
prejudice to their Estates and business, having always esteemed a Mistress a
more chargeable convenience than a Wife, the first having still an Eye to her
own profit, lest her Gallant should prove unconstant; whereas the interest of
the last is inseperably twisted with that of her Husband: Nor is she of small
advantage to him in the management of his Affairs: Hear old Tusser on the
point, The care of the Husband enricheth the Hutch.
The eye of the Huswife avails as much.
What he does provide with Money his Drudge
She still must look to which way it does trudge.


XIV. As to the choice of a Wife, having little experience my self, let me
advise you in the words of the same Poet, Though love be in choosing far better
then Gold,
Let love come with somewhat, the better to hold.


It Is the most Critical action of a man's life; not only his own happiness or
ruin, but his relations and posterity are concerned in it; and since it can be
done but once, it concerns us to consider more than twice before we undertake
it: the fear of God, consent of Parents, and a fitness between the parties for
each other, are requisite: A true mutual affection above all things should
precede; for nothing can be a greater torment than a loathed Bed. Yet since
Love is a flame, it is convenient it should have some fuel of Estate, lest damps
of necessity extinguish it. He that weds merely for money, turns Marriage into
a Bargain and Sale; and he that marries one wholly portionless, does the worst
of Drugeries for nothing. I would take the Woman for her own sake; but welcome
a Bag or two as good additions, considering Wealth in relation to her, as
Ciphers in Arithmetic, which though signifying nothing themselves, do yet much
vary the signification of those figures wherewith they are joynd.

XV. Another way whereby some ruin themselves, is folly, undertaking things
impossible or dangerous, or suffering themselves to be cheated and rook'd of
what they have: For the prevention whereof there is no better way than to deal
as securely with all men as if they were the veriest Knaves; then let them
prove as they will, you are safe. If a man impose on you once, it is his fault;
if twice your own: Always suspect the smoothest tongues and fairest
pretenders. In this sense many a man is saved by his Infidelity.

XVI. Above all to thrive, be very punctual in your Accounts; Register all
Receipts and Disbursements, and delight often to balance them; never slight
little advantages, nor contemn small expenses: The Scotch Proverb says well,
Every little makes a mickle; and the wiseman tells you plainly, That he that
contemns little things, shall fall by little and little. What vast sums do
some men trifle insensibly, Hangt, one Pint with such a friend, the other pot
with such an Acquaintance; it is but twelve pence, it is but two pence: whereas if
these superfluous expenses had but been laid up together, they might have paid
the Rent at the years end; or stopped some other gapp: for which now perhaps
thy goods are like to be seized, or thy person haled away to Jail. That none
may pretend ignorance, for want of Arithmetic; we shall here insert, A Table
of Expenses or Wages, whereby knowing what is for one day, you may see what it
is in a Week, Month, or Year.

This Table is so plain: the meanest capacity cannot but understand it: Find
the sum of pence or shillings spent in one day, in the first Column on the left
hand, and just against it you have the sum in pounds, shillings, and pence,
which it makes by the Week, by the Month, or Year, according to the respective
Titles above.

Hereby it appears, That one penny a day comes to one pound ten shillings and
five pence in a year; and therefore in 21 years it will come to 31 l. 18 s. 9
d. only by the saving thereof. But if you also employ this, so that you may
gain after the rate of Ten in the Hundred; it will amount to above Fourscore
and six pounds, in the said time: which may be a good Portion for a Man's Child.

A penny is a small regardless sum,
Yet in a while we see to pounds twill come,
He then that carelessly his pence does spend
Will quickly bring his pounds unto an end.
But to conclude, take these words of Advice,
First Worship God, his blessing to obtain;
For without that, man toils and moils in vain.
These Lessons approved, if wisely ye note,
May save and advantage you many a Groat:
Which if you can follow, occasion found,
Then every Lesson may save thee a pound.
Spare in thy Youth, least Age should find thee poor.
When time is past and thou can spare no more,
No coupled misery so great in either,
As Age and Want when both do meet together.
