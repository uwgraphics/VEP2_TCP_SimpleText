OR, A Looking-glass, wherein His Majesty may see his NEPHEWS Love;

Who secretly under pretense of Assisting Him, to gain an absolute Prerogative
or Arbitrary Power, will disthrone Him to set up himself.

An Item to His MAJESTY Concerning Prince RUPERT, and his CAVALIERS.
Whilst His Majesty is forcing a way through Laws and Parliaments, by seeking
to eradicate the one, and overthrow the just privileges of the other, to gain
an absolute Prerogative, and establish Arbitrary power, by which he and his
posterity is disesteemed, and His loving and loyal Subjects may be enslaved,
he plainly runs the hazard of a double destruction, and ruin to Himself and
Posterity.

The one is by endeavoring to abolish the ancient Fundamental Constitutions
of this Kingdom, established upon Laws and Parliaments, Himself being the top
Bough and highest Branch, which must needs therefore have the greatest fall, if
this long flourishing Tree be dug up by the root. And here I pray, His
Majesty would deliberately Consider; 1. That the Root and Body may flourish,
when as the top Branch being nipt with evil blasts, may be deprived of the sap
that may remain in the Root and Body, and so may fall, or if not fall, it may
be cut off as being not fit to remain thereon, lest it bring destruction to the
rest being so infected with the blasts of evil Counsel. Far be it from me
to desire it, the Lord grant it may be prevented, lest this Breach from the
Root and Body be not of worser consequence in a civil respect, than the
cutting off of the Jews, by reason of their unbelief in a spiritual; who
though they were broken off, yet may at last be grafted in again; and if the
Laws and Parliaments be the Root which His Majesty has confessed in His
Coronation Oath, in putting Himself to be guided by them; then let Him
consider that He bears not the Root, but the Root him, and though He be the
Head as is confessed, yet if it be separated from the body, it cannot long have
life. But

Secondly, Be pleased to consider, That the Laws and Parliaments are as
properly the peoples, if not more, yet of greater concernment than either the
Land-markes or Naboths Vineyard, the one of which being removed, the other
taken away, did not only bring a heavy curse, but also laid a sad foundation of
a ruin both to a King and his Posterity, 1 Kings 21. And truly the King of
kings, the God of Justice Will do justly; regarding in this respect the persons
not of any, but has provided Tophet of old, for Kings as well as beggars if
they offend him. Therefore, dear Sovereign (for whom my soul bleedeth) be
pleased to take the kingly Prophets advice, Be wise now therefore oh ye Kings,
be instructed ye Judges of the earth; Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice
with trembling, Kiss the Son lest he be angry, and ye perish in the way,
when his wrath is kindled but a little, Blessed are all they that trust in him.
And remember the Honor of a King consists in a multitude of people; but where
will that honor be if the sword continue to devour; but it may be the ground
of all this before will not be so easily believed, because His Majesty may
persuade Himself, that either by the Transportation of Himself into another
soil, or by altering the nature of that soil, upon which and by which He most
naturally stands (that is by changing from Parliamentary, to Arbitrary) may
cause Him to grow the better; but not only the Statists does, but I hope
experience may teach both His Majesty and us, That alterations are dangerous,
especially Fundamental ones, both to King and people; and if neither may be
believed, yet Scripture may, in which Rehobohams case stands Recorded; not
only for this, but also for his harkening to ill Counsel, who may seem to
have greater color for what he did, than those Kings which are only so by
compact, and are as really bound to their people, as the people to them, in the
fulfilling of those Laws agreed to by both; unless as King James said, They
will cease to be Kings and turn Tyrants, which I hope harbors not in your
Majesty's breast; and if we should step lower, and look at reason, it assures
us that no one man's will, though it were the same that Adam had in innocence,
is so safe to govern by, as is the counsel of many, with the consent of all.

The other danger His Majesty runs, is more close, and less discerned, lying
hid under an open show of friendship, and siding with Him against His supposed
enemies, by His Nephew Prince Rupert, one of the Blood-Royall, and not so far
from the Crown, but if once the course of Law and power of Parliaments be
extinguished, he may bid as fair for it by the sword, as His Majesty, he having
possessed himself of so much power already, under color of serving the King,
and by his German manner of plundering, and his active disposition in
Military affairs, having won the hearts of so many thousand Soldiers of
fortune and men of pray; he is already their Chieftain and Prince, and if
hereafter the power be transferred from civil to Marshall, he is like enough
to be their King, and if theirs, then the peoples, if once subdued; for the
King having lost their hearts, and the Law having lost their force, he that
has the best sword, and is likeliest to do most mischief, will be sure to gain
the greatest party, and subdue the most to his subjection. We may remember how
it fared with the Romans, so soon as the Legions or Military power was too
strong for the Senate, they chose the Emperor: when Law lost his force; the
Emperor lost his right; so when Parliaments are over borne with Cavaliers, the
King will be subject to every wind of violence, and they that now pretend to
set Him above His Parliament, will then set themselves above him, and will
retort upon Him the same language He now uses against the Parliament; for when
as He shall plead the Law against violence, for His being rightful King, it
will be demanded of Him, what Written. Law He can produce to make Him King of
England? if He make Answer, that the Fundamental Laws put Him in that Office;
it will again be told Him, That His own position is, that those Fundamental
Laws must be known Laws, explicit and written, else not to be trusted or urged
in Plea; and then if no Law make Him King, Conquest may without wrong to Him,
prefer another to the Crown, who is no stranger in blood, and much more
deserving by the sword, this whole War being managed by his skill* labor and
industry; insomuch, as already if the King command one thing and he another,
the Prince must be preferred before the King; witness Banbury, which was
secured from plundering by the Kings own hand; but that was slighted, and the
Town plundered by Prince Rupert, vilifying the Kings Authority and Fidelity,
making it a fault of His unexpertnesse; Saying, his Uncle knew not what
belonged to War. This may be sufficient to demonstrate what he intends, but
expressions newly vented may confirm, in which there was little civility, and
less Loyalty; but what can be expected from scholars taught by such a Master,
they coming to perform a piece of service for their Mr (and no doubt by his
commands) that they might give him the earnest to assure him of the full
possession of the whole kingdom; set upon Henley; who no sooner was entered
within the Town, but they cried out (as thinking it sure) God dam us, the Town
is Prince Roberts, but they reckoned without their host, and it would be well
for them they could miss of Damnation, which they so often desire, and may
justly expect, especially desiring of it so near death, that it may be
questioned whether they had time left to repent; as it happened with some of
those that fell at that time, and I hope if they mend not their manners, their
Master and the rest will be paid home in the same coin; now how unfit both are
to be taken to assist a King (in an unjust War against Loyal Subjects) who
labor to disthorne them and enslave the other, let the World judge; for he
that dare already so far to take upon him, will doubtless when time serves,
and then be but one throw for 3 Kingdoms, will put home for all, and so turn
Tables with His Majesty, putting Him and His to their Pensions, as himself now
is and may be worse, and than it will be too late for the King to think His
Parliament and those that adhere to them, His best subjects, when the Sons of
Serviah are too hard for Him; neither will Prince Rupert want abbettors and
sharers in this cursed design; for many of our young deboyced and Low-fortun'd
Nobility and Gentry suting therein so naturally with this new Conqueror will
make no bones to shoulder out their old King, to set up such an one, as shall
make them for making him: As for those of the graver and more sober sort, some
of which have been looked at as good Patriots of the Commonwealth, I admire
they do not bethink themselves, and get off betimes, and endeavor to help
the Lord against the mighty; knowing this, what side soever prevails, they may
come sadly home in some case or other, though worse on Prince Ruperts part than
the Parliament; witness the imprisonment of my Lord Savill and the Sheriff of
Yorke-shire, who now are imprisoned for this saying (and that upon just ground)
The Papists bore the greatest sway in my Lord of Newcastles Army, and none
suffered to bear offices but such; that they would not fight against Religion
and their own conscience, whatsoever else may be pretended. And such a
stratagem may be laid for them, when they may speak less matter according to
their conscience and judgment; as for the other which do hope for advancement
by their Countries ruin, they may come to fall short, as Esops dog, who
snatching at a shadow lost the substance; and marvel not that I put these
amongst those that will raise their Master P. R. for they that are not
faithful to their Country, can never be Loyal to their King, but as the
wind blows best for them, so they will sail: But for the preventing of this,
I beseech the Lord to open the eyes of His Majesty, that he duly and truly
considering, what otherwise may come upon Him and His Dominions, may join
Himself to His great Council, that so He may flourish, and His Subjects may
enjoy Peace and Truth.

FINIS.
