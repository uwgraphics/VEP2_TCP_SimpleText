Aldermen, and Common Council of the City of London, on Friday, March the 12.
1657.

Concerning the new Attempts and designs of Charles Stewart and his party both
at home and abroad, to imbroile this Nation again in a new War, and to imbrew
it in blood.

To which purpose he had employed the Lord of Ormond, who had three weeks bin
in this City to promote the design by encouraging and engaging all he could in
and about the CITY.

And that in order to this Invasion he had quartered eight thousand men in
Flanders near the water side, and had hired two and twenty ships to transport
them into England,

Together with the settling of the Militia of London in the hands of pious and
faithful men, who may carry on the work with alacrity and discretion, and be
in a condition to suppress Tumults and Insurrections.

The Great Discovery made by his Highness the Lord Protector on March the 12.
1657.
TO speak of princes is a task of as much difficulty as danger; Their wrath is
said to be like the roaring of a Lion which makes the wilderness to tremble;
Or like the dreadful Summons in the A^re when the Clouds do break, and the
Battle of the thunder is reported: Their prudence and providence is compared to
the eye of an Eagle, or to the restless Intelligences that do move the
heavenly bodies. Their eye is like that of the sun, over all Lands both to
foresee and to prevent dangers as soon as they are meant. When we thought we
had no vissible enemy but our own Ingratitude for misprizing ye great blessing
of Peace, which other Nations cannot obtain

His Highness (whom God has set over us for our Protector) and whose waking
is our sleep, has discovered the new designs of the old Enemy Charles Stuart
and his party who are watching all opportunities to fill the Land with blood,
and to destroy the flourishing of the Gospel amongst us, which we have enjoyed
in a purer way then was ever in the days of his Father, or any of his
Predecessors: For although men do fail in their practice, the Gospel certainly
was never more purely taught then is at this present: His Highness to give unto
the City a knowled^e of what so happily he had discovered, and so provide a
remedy to prevent the great danger that did threaten to ensue, was pleased to
give order that the Lord Mayor the Aldermen, and the Common-Counsell of this
City should attend upon him on Friday, March the 12. who in obedience
thereunto did make their appearance, and in so great a number that the like
has hardly been before: for they al knew that they owed both their lives and
Liberties to his Highness Protection, and it being whispered abroad that some
dangers were on foot, they would feign understand from him the straights into
which they were like to be reduced, and the means to provide a remedy for it.

The Lord Mayor, the Aldermen, and the Common-Councill of the City being come
in a full number to attend his Highness at White Hall on Friday March the 12.
they found there many of the Commanders and Officers of the Army, who were all
admitted to his Highness presence, who in a large Speech did represent unto
them the great deliverances which God has vouchsafed to this Nation during the
whole course and progress of the late wars, from the violence of their
implacable Enemies, and their combinations both public and Domestic: He
represented unto them how eminently God had ownd and prospered him in ye great
work in which he stood interested for the establishment of Righteousness and
peace, and at this present he could not but declare unto them the eminent
danger in which both the City and the whole Nation was like to be involued by
reason of the contriuements of Charles Stuart and his party, both at home and
abroad, who secretly have used the utmost of their endeavors to Imbroyle the
Nation and this City (the principle place at which they aim) in a new war,
which suddenly would appear, as soon as ever their Intented Invasion should
take effect.

To make the truth of this discovery more apparrent, His Highness insisted
that he knew it to be true, and not only by Letters of his, and the Cities
adversaryes which were intercepted, but by certain Inteligence from several
other hands beyond the Seas of their proceedings, as also by information from
the mouths of such persons, who had promised to Engage themselves to comply and
act with them.

And to make this yet more manifest, he Informed them that the Lord of Ormond
(whom by his own Party is now called the Duke of Ormond) had been in person in
this City for three weeks together being come out of Flanders on purpose to
draw all unto him that possibly he could by encouraging and Engaging them to
forsake all other interests to adhere unto the Cause of his Master: His
Highness did also acquaint them that he having used his uttermost endeavors to
promote the Cause for which he came, be departed privately from London on
Tuesday March the ninth.

But what was above all, he declared that in order to this Invasion, Charles
Stuart was waiting in Flanders having got together an Army of about Eight
thousand horse and foot, whom he had quartred in several comodious places near
unto the Sea side, as Bruges, Brussels, Ostend, and other places, and that
withal he had contracte^ for two and twenty ships, who were in readiness to
Transpor^ his Army and only waited for the opportunity of some dark ni^ht to
slip by the English Fleet, when the Mist had covered the face of the Sea and in
being ships of no great bu^then he represented that the ships of the Enemy had
some advantage over our ships, who were of a great burden and drawing much
water, and therefore not able to ride upon the Flats.

He concluded that seeing the dangers was so apparent and so near at hand, and
that the safty, and the peace of the City, and the whole Nation was highly
concerned in it, he desired the City to be sensible of it, and laid open to
them how deeply it concerned them to provide for their own security, and the
security of the whole Nation.

He therefore recommended to the Lord Mayor and the Aldermen, and
Common-councill of the City there assembled the settling of their Militia; and
that it might be established in the hands of faithful and pyous men, and such
as were well affected to the present Government, and such as are free from all
discontent, and faction to put the City in a posture of defense, that they may
be ready to suppress all Tumults. and Insurrections designed by the Enemy
against the peace and safty of the City.

This and much more to this effect His Highness represented as to the
Transaction of the Affairs of State from the beginning of the wars unto this
present, and ths happy Propagation of the Gospel in these three Nations.

The Citizens departed with great cheerfulness and satisfaction, and going home
they might revolve with themselves their honorable Atchievments they acquired
at Newbury Redding* Grafton-house, and several other places when they returned
with songs of joy in their mouths, and Laurels in their hands, and make ye same
Adresses in their representation to his Highness as the Commanders of the Army
have done before them. showing that amongst the Officers and Soldiers of the
Army, they for their parts have not been altogether negligent in laying near
unto their hearts the great providence which God has been pleased to set his
seal to the righteousness of that cause wherein they have engaged with his
Highness, In which it has pleased God to make him an eminent Instrument of
much good to the three Nations in General, and to the City in particular, and
it has pleased God after all these great hazards and labors to call his
Highness to the Government of this Commonwealth which as they look upon to be
the work of the great God, so do also acknowledge it to be a very seasonable
mercy to these distracted, and divided Nations, which seemed to be inclining to
u^ter confusson, had it not pleased God to raise up his Spirit to undertake a
work of so great a difffculty in which his Highness has been exposed to so
much Ermity even of those persons from whom he might justly have expected the
greatest Concurrence and assistance.

That they have observed also his Highness pyous Endeavors for the propagation
of the Gospel of Truth in the purity and the glory of it, and the Establishment
of the Spiritual Lib^rtyes of all good Christians, (though differing in
Opinions) and his great care of securing Propriety, and the Civil Rights of
these Nations, and in preventing their probable Ruin and destruction, For
which mercyes they must most sinceerly confess that they have infinite cause to
bless God. And therefore they cannot but in humble duty represent unto his
Highness, that they are resolved with the hazard of their lives and utmost
fortunes to own, and stand by him in the pursuance of those ends for which he
has so fully declared, And that (by the assistance of the Almighty) They will
faithfully attend their duties in the several places in the City, and else
where, for ye defense of his Highness person, and the Preservation and Peace
of this City, And of the whole Nation

This indeed would be a great and Univocall Expression, they might also ad unto
it* That by reason of the many secret plots and Combinations threatening further
trouble and confusion in these Nations by strengthening and encouragment which
the common Enemies receive by the advantage of our Intestine discords to
promote their design, which if accomplished will be unvoydably of that cause
and Interest, for which his Highness has so often and so fully declared for,
and in which God has so eminently owned him and prospered him, that for the
blessed effects thereof which they enjoy they have abundant cause to bless the
Almighty.

They are therefore fully resolved to attend his Highness commands in the
faithful discharge of the duties of their places. for the defense of his
person and the Security of the Commonwealth, In the pursuance of which great
Interest, They will Engage themselves to the utmost hazard of their lives
against all Tumultuous Insurrections that may hereafter be raised by the
Enemies of his Highness, and the peace of the City, and the Nation, and that
he may assure himself that the same presence will attend him from on high which
formerly has apeared in his Atchievments in so many fields for the
accomplishing of that great work so happyly begun to the glory of God, and the
rejoicing of the hearts of all the people in this City and Nation.

These are the honorable and pyous Resolutions In which the City will join with
the Commanders of the Army to the mutual preservation of each
othershappynesse, and the Terror of all their Enemies whatsoever,

The Resolution of the Lord Mayor, and Common-Councell-men of the City of
London, upon the aforesaid discovery.
THe Lord Mayor of London, with the consent of the Court of Aldermen, and the
Common Council of the said City upon their return from his Highness, taking
into their serious consideration the weightinesse of the Reasons then proposed
unto them, and withal considering how much their own safty was wrapped up in
this serious Discovery, did immediately like true Patriots to their Country
resolve to act something that in such a Juncture of time might render them
famous to Posterity, and to that end they immediately issued out their Orders
to the Commanders of the several Regiments in the City of London, to summon in
a the inhabitants in their respective devisions which either formerly have or
now are in a Capacity to be listed for the present safty of the City, the peace
and quietness of the whole Nation, who very cheerfully appeared and declared
their honest resolutions to maintain the Government now established, with the
hazard of their lives and Fortunes against any Malignant party or discontented
Faction whatsoever. And I do believe within a few days ther^ will be as
gallant an Army of truehearted Citizens, really to maintain what they have
Verbally promised as London could have shown this many years.

FINIS.
