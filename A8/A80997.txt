TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE PHILIP, Earl of Pembroke and Mountgomery, Baron
HERBERT of Cardiffe and Shirland, Lord PAR and ROSSE of Kendall, Lord Fitzhugh
Marmion, and Saint Quintine, Lord Warden of the Staneries, in the County of
Devon and Cornwall, Lord High Steward of the Duchy of Cornwall, Chancellor of
the University of Oxford, Lord Lieutenant of the Counties of Kent, Cornwall and
Wilts: Lord Chamberlain of his Majesty's most Honorable Household, Knight of
the most Noble Order of the Garter, and one of his Majesty's most Honorable
privy Counsel.
Upon his Lordships Election of Chancellor of the University of Oxford.
MY LORD,
WHen Studies now are blasted, and the times
Place us in false lights, and see Arts as Crimes,
When to heap knowledge is but thought to fill
The mind with more advantage to do ill*
When all your honored Brothers choice and store
Of Learned Remains with sweat and charge fetched ore,
Are thought but useless Pieces: and some trust
To see our Schools mingled with Abbey dust.
That now you dare receive us, and profess
Your self our Patron, makes you come no less,
Then a new Founder; Whilst we all allow,
What was Defense before, is building now:
And this you were reserved for, set a part
For times of hazard; as the Shield and Dart
Laid up in store to be extracted thence,
When serious need shall ask some tried Defense;
And who more fit to manage the Gowns cause
Then you, whose even life may dare the Laws,
And the Lawmakers too: in whom the Great
Is twisted with the Good, as Light with Heat;
What though your sadder cares do not profess
To find the Circles squaring, or to guess
How many sands within a grain or two
Will fill the World, these speculations do
Steal man from man; You Are he that can suggest
True Rules, and fashion manners to the best:
You can preserve our Charters from the wrongs
Of the untaught Town, as far as now the tongue
Does from their understanding, You can give
Freedom to men, and make that freedom live;
And divert hate from the now hated Arts,
These are your great endowments, these your parts,
And it is our honest boast, when this we scan,
We give a Title, but receive a man.
Your Lordships most Honored humble Servant, WILLIAM CARTWRIGHT.
