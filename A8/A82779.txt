August, 1. 1647.
FOR the better satisfaction of the Kingdom, The City of London, (who has
been the Principal maintainer of the Army) now advancing against them, is for
Peace, and has omitted nothing to show their desires to maintain a good
understanding with the Army; What the City does in standing upon their Guard,
is for their own defense, and not to engage in a new War, but to put a speedy
period to the Kingdoms troubles, and hasten Irelands relief; They profess
they have, and shall always endeavor to procure the Soldiers indemnity, and
that they may have their Arreares paid them; and have no other end but that God
may have his glory, the Kings Majesty settled in his just Rights, the Parliament
enjoy their Privileges and Freedoms, and the Subject their fundamental Laws
Liberty and Peace; And this being the resolution of this City, they are
confident no Person of Honor, good Conscience and lover of their Country will
draw sword or use violence against them, but rather stand for their defense and
safety.

Ordered by the Committee of Lords and Commons for the safety of the King,
Parliament, City, and Kingdom, And also by the Committee of the Militia of the
City of London and parts adjacent, that this Declaration be Printed and
Published.

Tho. Partington Cler.
