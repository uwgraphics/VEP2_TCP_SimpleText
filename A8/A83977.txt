The tune is, O man in desperation.


AWake, awake O England,
sweet England now awake,
And to thy Prayers speedily
do thou thy self betake,
The Lord thy God is coming
within the Say so clear,
Repent therefore O England,
the day it draws near,
The dreadful day of vengeance
is shortly now at hand.
When fearful burning fire,
shall wast both Sea and Land
And al men's hearts shall fail them
to see such things appear.
Repent therefore, etc.
The worldly wise and prudent
shall fa^l bestdes their wits,
And wish the hills to cover them
in these their franticks fits
No succor help nor comfort,
for them shall then appear.
Repent therefore, etc.
The Seas and rivers Running
shall roar in grievous wise,
The B^ast^ in Pastures feeding,
shall st^ain forth grievous cries,
The Skies shall flame with fire,
the Earth wall burn so clear,
Repent, etc.
The glorious holy Angels
shall then their trumpets sound,
The dead shall hear their voices,
as they lie in the ground.
Then all the graves shall open,
and dead men shall appear.
Before the Lord in judgment;
the day it draws near.
The Devil will be ready then.
each creature to accuse.
And show how in their lifetime
they did themselves abuse,
And every man's own consciences
for witness shall appear.
Repent, etc.


The works of every creature
their thoughts and deeds I say,
Shall follow them together,
in that most dreadful day.
And no respect of persons
shall at that day appear.
Repent therefore O England,
the day it draws near,
But such as have done justly
shall wear the Crown of life
The wicked shall be damned,
to sorrow, pain, and grief.
In boiling brands of brimstone.
with doleful heavy cheer,
Repent, etc.
But woe unto that woman,
which then with child shall go
And to the silly Nurses,
which do give such also,
When as the day of Judgment,
so grievous shall appear.
Repent, etc.
And pray with tears most constant
unto the Lord of might,
That in the frozen winter,
you do not take your flight,
Nor that upon the Sabbath
that peril do appear.
Repent, etc.
Let all good Christian people,
repent therefore in time,
And from their hearts lamenting,
each former grievous crime.
Prepare themselves with gladness
to watch when Christ shall come,
The trumpet shall sound on sudden
and no man knows how soon,
For all things are fulfilled
which Christ before had told.
Small faith is now remaining,
and charity's grown cold.
Great sights and wonders we have seen
within the Earth and Sky.
Repent, etc.
Why do thou put thy confidence,
in strong and stately Towers,
Why take thou such pleasure,
in building sumptuous Bowers
Rejoicing in thy Pastures,
and Parks of follow D^r,
Repent, etc.
Why seeks thou deceitfully,
to purchase treasure great,
Or why do thou through usury.
the bread of poor men eat.
Why does thy life and living,
so filthily appear,
Repent, etc.
Wherefore let all good people,
upon their knees proceed,
I making earnest prayers,
for never was more need.
That God may spare these punishments
even for his mercy mere.
And give us grace to bear in mind,
the judgment day is near.
