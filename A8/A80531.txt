A Copy of the Petition delivered to the King at Newark, in His Majesty's
passage to York, by diverse of the inhabitants of the County of Lincoln.
To the Kings most Excellent Majesty.
The humble Petition of Your Majesty's loving Subjects in the County of
Lincoln.
IN all humility representing, as our thankefullest acknowledgments to God, and
to Your Majesty, of the gracious blessings which we have for these many years
enjoyed under your Majesty's Government, and particularly the blessed fruits of
this present Parliament, by Your Majesty's Wisdom and Goodness assembled,
Whereby many wholesome Laws have been enacted for the great honor of Your
Majesty, The relief of Your People, The prosperous Government of this
Kingdom, and happy settling of the late troubles in both Kingdoms. So also our
saddest regreat for any the least misunderstanding and differences which have
happened between Your sacred Majesty and the said Parliament, or any of the
Members of the same, with our many distractions thereupon, and fears of the
utter ruin of Your Majesty, Your Royal Posterity and Kingdoms, by the
malicious and insolent designs of the Popish Party, and the advantage that
foreign Enemies may take thereby.

Humbly prostrating our selves at Your Majesty's feet, Do most affectionately
pray, That Your Majesty and Parliament may by all good means be firmly
reunited, and for that purpose, That you would graciously please to Reside
near, and listen unto the faithful Counsels of your said Parliament;
Whereby, Romish Idolatry and Superstition may be extirpated, The Church and
Commonwealth duly Reformed, The true Religion, and all things settled in a
blessed Peace under your Majesty's Government And we shall still have further
cause to continue our cheerful Aids, both of Persons and Estates, for your
Majesty and your Kingdoms prosperity and honor.

And ever pray for your Majesty's long and happy Reign over us, etc.
