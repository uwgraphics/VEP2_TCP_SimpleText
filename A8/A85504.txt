A TRVE RELATION Out of IRELAND, Of All The Passages, and Overthrowes Given to
the REBELS, from the 1 of June until the 10 of July, 1642.

Sent in a Letter from Captain JOHN GOWER, And Ordered to be Printed.

London, Printed for Richard Best, 164^.

Sir,
I May be bold to assume thus much to my self, that I have not ommitted any
occasion wherein I might serve you according to your commands, I have formerly
sent you the relation, the good service my Lord of Inchiquin has done to the
state, and this Country; Ever since our arrival he has commanded in chief as
General of these Forces by being vice President to his Father in Law during
the time of his long sickness, in which service I'may modestly say he has
expressed himself, the only Terror to our Enemies, the greatest comfort to the
Kings good Subjects, and the most absolute (next under God, and your cares)
protector of this Province; for no man can more certainly relate (his
continual care of our distessed, and beleagur'd friends, his nightly
excursitions and incursions upon the enemies quarters, his extraordinary
Sedulity in procuring spies, and intelligencers in all parts of the enemies
Countries) then my self, who had the honor to be employed in some of these
expeditions; but what will now happen unto us we are both ignorant, and have
just cause to fear, for the Lord President is now departed this World, and our
Enemy hopes, and we fear, an alteration of our chief Commanders, for we
cannot hope for any in his place, so fit for it as he is himself, he being
acquainted both with the condition of the people, speaking their own language,
and so knowing in the Country, that he is of the whole Army the best guide
himself, I will not detract from any of our ancient Officers here, for we have
Sir William Oagle, Sir Charles Vava^^ur, Sir John Paulet, very gallant men and
old Soldiers, and so have expressed themselves in these affairs, but I am of
that opinion, that they do find this kind of service something new to them,
for our chiefest expeditions come by camisadoes in the night, or sudd^n
surpris^lls upon some certain intelligences of the enemies re^lls, which
seldom happens, but my Lords spies do discover, and it has hitherto prooved
to the ruin of all, or most of them, as did appear in the business with Sir
Edward Fitzharris, and the overthrow which he gave to the Lord Roch, and the
Quond^s, and in our last conflict where we got the victory (...) thousand five
hundred The, and Horse, with about six hundred and fifty of ours, where we slew
four hundred of the enemy, took five Colors, some pri^oners, all their
baggage, and many arms, as the relation here enclosed does further express.
The former of these expeditions were absolutely his own, and in this later Sir
William Oagle, and Sir John Paulet, with part of their Regiments were with him;
yet if I do ascribe that likewise to him, it is no more then their own act,
because this I must speak of mine own knowledge, That when we stood in batalia
opposite to the Enemy, they seeing the number of the Enemy so far exceeding
ours, they were unwilling to consent that we should fight, and told my Lord
that they would do their Offices as Colonells, but the act should be his own,
upon which my Lord commanded to charge, and got the victory without the loss
of two men, nor do I imagine but that these Colonells advised my Lord very
well, considering what service they had formerly been in, where one Army
equally armed, equally valiant had fought: this ods of number had been
dangerous to us, but my Lord by his intelligence, certainly knew all the
proceedings of their Army, how they were Armed, how strong in foot, how in
horse, and was very certain that we far exceeded them in the strength of the
horse, which was the maine ground that made him in my hearing give this reason
why he would fight, that with the strength of his horse and the largeness off
the plain he was able to releeve the foot and bring them off when he pleased.
This relation I only make to conduce to that I formerly said, that though we
have many brave Commanders yet I conceive I cannot detract from any of them in
supposing him the most fit man for this war. I hope and I make no question
but you shall hear, that we shall go forwards a pace in our victories so long
as he that now commands does continue in his place, for he has wrought his
intendments almost to a full ripeness considering the small forces that we
have, being not able to march two thousand into the field, But thus I will
conclude with you, and value my Iudg^ment accordingly in other things if it do
not happen according to my sense, that the alteration of our chief Officer be
not the greatest Remorah to our proceedings that can happen, but I question not
if that greedy beast Ambition be not amongst us, our Colonels and great
Officers will Petition you for that which we the inferior officers, and the
rest of the Army so much desire: I have my self had my share in all these
businesses, it was my fortune to take a Leiutenant prisoner in the last he is
able to pay enough for his ^ans^ if I might be(...)it, but I believe he will be
hanged ere you receive this Letter: if I have done any thing more then ordinary
you shall have the relation from

Your Servant John Gower
Donaroyall July 3. 1642.
THE OCCURRENCES Enclosed in the letter aforesaid.
THe Lord Inchiquin marched over the mountains with his troops and 80 footmen
to pillage the Country, and took some Castles that would annoy us, but in his
return, Sir Edward Fitz-harris came down with his Army and waylaid them, so
my Lord fell upon them, beat them out of their holds, slew about one hundred
and forty of them, and came safe home with his prey without the loss of one
man. Upon holy thursday our forces marched into the L. Roch his Country: but
the Quondames who are notable rebels, and the Lord Roch had heard of his
coming and were drawn into battalia, but my Lord fell upon them, routed them,
and killed betwixt two and three hundred, and brought away the prey home safe.
The week after Whit sunday Sir Charles V^saur with his regiment, and Captain
Gepsons troop beleagured a place called Drumaneeue, and battered it the first
day, with 2 pieces of ordnance, made a breach in the Wall of the Court, and
entered the breach with the soldiers, but were beaten off it with the loss of
five or six men: the wall being hollow, the enemy sets fire on it, so that
they could not assault there any more: next day my Lord appointed me to wait on
him thither, where they had drawn their approches to the gate, but those guns
would not bite: so that they were constrained to send to Cork to fetch a
greater, which came in two or three days, so they battered it all that day,
all the next, and in conclusion took it by composition, that they should depart
with their lives and their clothes on their backs. The next day my Lord sent
me with forty horses through the Roch his Country, into the Quondams where we
saw the enemy, took away their cowes, sheep, and horses, so we brought them
all home safe, they never once offering to assault or hinder us: within two
days my Lord Inchiquin drew the horse and foot together and sat down before
the Lord Roch his Castle, and battered it all that day and that night, the next
day they begd quarter, which my Lord denied. I was sent with my Lords troop to
pillage round about, I brought above a thousand sheep and three hundred
cattle: that night our troop was commanded to lie at the foot of the mountain
to stop any relief from coming to the Castle we lay there two nights, which
has bred a great sickness amongst them I brought out of Yorkshire, all this
whole night and day the Castle was battered and no quarter would be given them,
until such time as news was brought, that the enemy was gathered together and
fallen upon our quarters at Dona-royall, so that we were forced to give them
quarter, and turn them out of the Castle with their lives, and to haste to our
own Town, which we did, we took great store of Corn, many Arms, and much
other provision in the Castle, there were seven or eight hundred people in it
besides old women and children, who fled into the mountains, where we shall be
sure to have them the next Castle we take, and then they may certainly expect
a general hanging. The 27 of June about 12 of the clock at night my Lord
Inchiquin sent me out with forty horse and fifty foot to relieve Liscarroll and
Newmarket, which I did, and drove the Cattle away from the Castle Anno and beat
300 of their men from the prey and came safe home. Upon Saint Peter's Eve, my
Lord Inchiquin received intelligence that eighteen colors were come from the
county of Limbrick, and were set down before a place called Castle Dodd, in the
hands of one Master Munck a friend unto our Army, and a good subject, my Lord
as he has been always ready to relieve such, advised with Sir William Oagle
and Sir John Paulet, who suddenly concluded to march: which we did betwixt
eleaven and twelve a clock that night, and found them not there, but heard
they were gone: unto a place called New town alias Shaudrum, in the County of
Cork, from whence they intended the next night with other forces to fall on our
quarters according to their pretense: they had heard of our coming by that
time we marched toward them, for most of our neighbors here are Traitors, in
the same condition with the rebels, we found them at the end of a Champiane in
Battalia, a little bog being between them and us, the troops just behind
them, and under the town a great morosse and wood: we presented them battle,
but they immediately drew out of the plain into the lanes, and the a soresaid
towns, so that our horse could no way help us or offend them, upon which we
drew up the musketeers, who disputed the business with them, for an hour,
until such time as the horse found out a little way through the wood and
encompassed the enemy round, which as soon as they perceived, they retreated,
but in such, disorder, that our horse having some convenient ground to charge
them, fell upon them, and so absolutely routed then whole body; the business
after that was nothing, but the execution I believe was as great as any has
been since these wars began: the number could not be certainly known,
because the execution was so dispersed, and the enemy throwing down their
weapons and running, gave us encouragement to fight disbanded, so that the
slaughter was over all the fields, both bogs and ditches; the general vote is,
that there were slain about four or five hundred men, but if you will have my
opinion, having the command of the horse that day, and saw what were slain,
both by the horse and foot, there was slain six hundred; we took sive
colors, some prisoners, whereof I took my self a Lieuetenant prisoner, we
took all their baggage, and many arms, two days after this battle my Lord
President died, and without question poisoned by the popish Doctors.

Yours John Gower.
