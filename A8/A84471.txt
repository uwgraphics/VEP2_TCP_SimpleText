By the Council of State. A PROCLAMATION.
WHereas several Officers Reduced and Disbanded, within the space of a Year
last past, do now remain in and about the Cities of London and Westminster, and
frequently resort thither, who may be justly suspected (in these times of
danger) to be inclineable (through the influence of their discontent with the
present posture of affairs) to Foment Dissatisfactions, and to combine amongst
themselves, and with others of the same Principle, for disturbance of the
public peace: The Council of State having a due resentment hereof, and in
tender respect to the Safety of the Commonwealth, have thought it necessary,
That all and every such Reduced and Disbanded Officer and Officers, do on or
before the Twenty Fifth day of this instant March, depart out of the said
Cities of London and Westminster, and the late Lines of Communication, to
their respective dwellings and places of abode in the Country. And they do
hereby charge and require them, and every of them to depart accordingly, and
not to return till the First of May next, unless upon satisfaction received of
their peaceable Spirits and Demeanor; Or that they have no dwellings and
places of abode in the Country, and notice left with the Clerks of the Council,
or one of them, of the Places of their Residence in and about the said Cities,
or either of them, they shall obtain leave from the Council of State there to
continue till further Order. Herein the Council will expect, from all persons
concerned, a punctual Submission and Conformity at their Perils.

Saturday the 17 of March 1659. At the Council of State at Whitehal
ORdered that this Proclamation be forth with Printed and Published.

WILL. JESSOP, Clerk of the Council.
