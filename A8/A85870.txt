XI CHOICE SERMONS, Preached upon Several Occasions.

With a CATECHISM Expounding the Grounds and Principles of Christian RELIGION.

By WILLIAM GAY B. D. Rector of Buckland.

LONDON, Printed for Humphrey Moseley, and are to be sold at his Shop at the
Princes Arms in St. Paul's Churchyard. 1655.

TO THE HONORABLE Sr Henry Frederick Thin, Knight and Baronet, continual
increase of Honor and Happiness.
SIR,
THese following papers have long been designed to kiss your hand, where (if
they now find acceptance) I shall conceive them the better able to weather those
storms which they may expect to meet withal abroad; You are not ignorant, how
the injurious malice of some men, (which though diverse years are past, has not
sufficiently evaporated its malignity) has subjected the Author to an hard,
and yet honorable suffering; his innocence may perhaps be the more conspicuous
to ca^did judgments, when these his meditations shall appear under the shelter
of your honored Name: and (his opposers) may be less forward to blast his
memory: It was his intention to have presented it with his own hand, but death
prevented it, and providence has cast this as a necessary duty upon me; all
his ambition was to acknowledge to the world his many deep obligements, hoping
this might remain as an undoubted testimony; that his earnest desires to honor
and serve you could not expire but with his breath: and mine shall be no other
then to have the honor to be esteemed

Sir Your devoted Servant W. G.
Sep. 27. 1654.
A CATECHISM.
The First Section: Of Catechizing.
1. Quest.

WHat is the title of your common Catechism?

A. An Instruction.

2. Q. What does it concern?

A. The Principles and Grounds of Religion; and it is therefore called the
laying of the foundation, Heb. 6.1.

3. Q. In what manner or kind is it?

A. By Questions and Answers; and it is therefore called Catechism, which
signifies resounding or answering again.

4. Q. Who must be the Learners?

A. Children, whether they be so in age, Prove. 22.6. or in understanding, 1
Cor. 14.20. Heb. 5.12. 1 Pet. 3.15.

5. Q. Who must be the Teachers?

A. Masters to their Families, Ephesians. 6.4. Genesis 14.14. and 18.19. but especially
Ministers to their flocks, 1 Cor. 3.2.10. Acts 5.42. and 20.20.

6. Q. What reason can you show that this work belongs to Masters of families?

A. Because they are bound to provide for their Families corporally, 1 Timothy
5.8. therefore spiritually.

7. Q. Have women any part or share in this work?

A. No doubt they have, whether they be Wives or Widows, Tit. 2.3, 4. Prove.
31.1, 26.

8. Q. Is Catechizing to be preferred before Preaching?

A. Yes for order, though for honor Preaching excels it, as the complete
habitation excels the foundation.

9. Q. What learn you out of all aforesaid?

A. To love this exercise, because it is instruction, Prove. 15.32. and the
foundation of building me up to God, and the surest way for Teacher and Learner
to understand one another.

Sect. 2. Of our spiritual danger or misery.
1. Q. WHat are the chiefest parts or points of this foundation?

A. The knowledge of our danger; of our remedy; of our receiving the remedy;
and of the proof of our receiving it.

2. Q. What is our common danger in our spiritual estate?

A. That we are by nature subject to Gods wrath, Ephesians. 2.3.

3. Q. What is the especial effect thereof to us?

A. A threefold death, Genesis 2.17. Romans 6.23. viz. a natural, Genesis 3.19.
spiritual, Ephesians. 2.1. eternal, which is called the second death, Rev. 2.11. and
20.6. and eternal damnation, Mar. 3.29. and eternal judgment, Heb. 6.2.

4. Q. Can you declare and express what that second death is?

A. No more then its opposite, or contrary (the joys of heaven) can be
expressed, 1 Cor. 2.9. But it is summed in poena damni, and poena sensus, both
everlasting, all included, Mat. 25.41.

5. Q. How comes this (so infinite) punishment to be due to us?

A. For Adams first sin, and for every sin of our own.

6. Q. How (in point of Justice) for Adams sin?

A. Because we were then all in him, not only as the root from which we were to
spring, but as the body in which we were included and represented; he being
(though but one man, yet) that public one that stood for all, so that both his
receipt, and breach of the Covenant was ours, 1 Cor. 15.22. Romans 5.18, 19.

7. Q. How (in point of Justice) for every sin of our own, seeing to us many
sins seem light and small?

A. Because God is infinite, therefore every sin being the transgression of
his will, 1 John 3.4.) deserves infinite punishment, Romans 6.23.

8. Q. How came Adam by sin? was he created sinful?

A. No, but by Satan's temptation to the Woman, and by her to him he fell into
it, Genesis 3.1. 2 Cor. 11.

9. Q. Who, or what was Satan, and how came he to be sinful?

A. Satan is a name implying, and including all, and every of the Devils, who
being (with infinite other Angels, created in glory, and Angels of light) of
themselves, and through their own frailty and presumption fell in sin, and
became eternally reprobated Angels of darkness, Joh. 8.44. 2 Pet. 2.4. Jude 6.

10. Q. What can you gather out of this doctrine of our danger, and fall of the
creatures?

A. 1. That there is but one unchangeable Essence, one God, Deuteronomy. 6.4. Jam.
1.17.

2. That we should not be proud of ourselves, nor scornful of others, 1 Cor.
4.7. Romans 14.10 Gal. 6.1, 2.

3. That we can never be too watchful or careful of ourselves, 2 Pet. 3.11.

4. That we have no help in our selves, but must look it without us, Romans
7.14.18. 2 Cor. 3.5.

Sect. 3. Of our Remedy.
1. Q. BY, whom are we delivered from our foresaid danger?

A. By Jesus Christ, Romans 5.9. 1 These. 1.10.

2. Q. How did he deliver us?

A. By making satisfaction to God for us, 1 John 2.2.

3. Q. How did he make satisfaction for us?

A. By his sufferings, Is. 53.5. 1 Pet. 2.24. and by his doings, Jtr. 23.6. 1
Cor. 1.30.

4. Q. What needed any satisfaction, seeing God is merciful?

A. Because he is also just, and cannot deny himself, 2 Timothy 2.13.

5. Q. But how could Christ's doing, and suffering (in Justice) stand and pass
for ours?

A. Because he was our voluntary surety, Gal. 1.4. our head (answerable to the
first Adam) Romans 5.18, 19. Col. 1.18. our husband, Ephesians. 5.23, 24.

6. Q. But how could Christ's satisfaction be sufficient for all men?

A. Because he was God as well as man, therefore the virtue and value of it was
infinite, Acts 20.28. Acts 3.15. 1 Cor. 2.8.

7. Q. What follows for our instruction in point of practice, out of this
doctrine of our redemption by Christ?

A. Great provocation of our love to God, to our self, and our neighbor.

8. Q. Why to God?

A. Because we are not our own, but his; bought with a price, 1 Cor. 6.20. and
that a precious one, 1 Pet. 1.19.

9. Q. Why to our self?

A. Because God has prized us so highly we should not disesteem, or slight
our selves, but carefully pass the time of our dwelling here in fear, 1 Pet.
1.17, 18, 19.

10. Q. Why to our neighbor?

A. Because God has so dearly loved us, 1 John 4.10.

Sect. 4. Of our receiving our Remedy.
1. Q. HOw do we receive the remedy which Christ has wrought for us?

A. Only by Faith, Ioh. 1.12. Ioh. 3.16. Romans 10.4.

2. Q. But does not faith work by love? Gal. 5.6.

A. Yes, outwardly to the world, and inwardly to our self, in point of its own
probation, but not upwardly to God in point of our justification; there Works
are shut out, Romans 3.28. Ephesians. 2.9.

3. Q. But though our Works have no hand in receiving our Justification, yet do
they not help to make us acceptable to God?

A. No more then the wiping with a filthy ragge would cleanse our faces, Is.
64.6.

4. Q. But is there no worth or virtue in our Faith, for which it receives our
justification?

A. No, for we are said to be justified, or saved by Faith, Romans 3.28. and
through Faith, Ephesians. 2.8. but never for Faith; for the price is only Christ's
satisfaction, Act. 4.12. Is. 53.5. And to say we are justified by Faith, is but
a Figurative speech: for Faith does justify us no otherwise then our hand does
feed us; and that is but as a receiving, and an applying instrument.

5. Q. And do you (by your particular faith) receive your own justification to
your self?

A. Yes, or else my faith were no better then the Devils, I am. 2.19.

6 Q. But is it not enough (at least for the ignorant) to believe as the Church
believes, in implicit Faith?

A. No, for the just shall live by his faith, Heb. 2.4. And in the Creed we are
taught, and required every one to profess, and confess the particulars of our
faith.

7. Q. And have you any assurance in your particular Faith?

A. Yes (though in much weakness, Mark 9.24. and reluctation of the flesh,
Gal. 5.17.) For Faith is the ground of things hoped for, Heb. 11.1.

8. Q. How can you have particular assurance, having no particular warrant, or
promise to you by name?

A. Because the Covenant of Grace was made indefinitely to all believers, every
believer may, and must take, and apply the same unto himself in particular, as
Job 19.25. Job. 20.28. Gal. 2.20.

9. Q. What follows, or may be gathered out of this doctrine of our
justification by Faith only?

A. Humiliation, and Confirmation.

10. Q. How, or why Humiliation?

A. Because in our justification we are mere and bare receivers, and have
nothing to boast of, 1 Cor. 4.7. Luke 17.10.

11. Q. How, or why Confirmation?

A. Because we build not on the sand of our own merits, but on the foundation
of Gods knowledge, 2 Timothy 2.19. Gal. 4.9. and on the rock of Christ's
perfection. 1 Pet. 2.6, 7, 8.

Sect. 5. Of the proof of our Faith.
1. Q. WHat need is there of proving our faith?

A. None in respect of God, for he knows what is in man, Ioh. 2.25. and
works whatsoever is good in man, Iam. 1.17. but in respect of the Church, and
of our selves.

2. Q. What is the proof of our faith outwardly to the Church?

A. Its good fruits, Gal. 5.6. 2 Cor. 5.17. Iam. 2, 18.

3. Q. How necessary is that good fruit (Obedience) to true faith?

A. As necessary as the soul is to the life of the body, I am. 2.26.

4. Q. What reason can you show for this?

A. Because love is of the nature of fire.

5. Q. And what do you infer from that?

A. That the fire of Gods love (wheresoever it is received by faith) will
inflame, Ps. 39.3. and purify Act. 15.9.

6. Q. What inward proof is there to our self, and our own conscience?

A. The testimony of Gods Spirit, Ioh. 4.13. Romans 8.16.

7. Q. How is that wrought, known, or found?

A. Descendendo, by showring down comforts, Ps. 72.6. and ascendendo, by
exhaling Graces, Gal. 5.22. for so Jacobs dream, Genesis 28.12. is fulfilled in
Christ, Ioh. 1.51.

8. Q. What follows (for instruction of our practice) out of this doctrine of
the necessity of good works?

A. That we must take heed of denying God our selves, Tit. 1.16. and of setting
others awork to blaspheme him, Romans 2.23, 24. 2 Samuel 12.14.

Sect. 6. Of the helps of our Faith.
1. Q. WHat special help have you of, or to your faith?

A. The Sacraments, for therein Christ is offered to us both by word and action.

2 Q. How long have Sacraments been in use?

A. From the beginning.

3. Q. What Sacraments had Adam?

A. The tree of Life, pawning life to his obedience, and the tree of knowledge
of good and evil, pawning death to his disobedience, Genesis 2.9.

4. Q. Had these any relation to Christ and the covenant of Grace?

A. No, for there was yet no need, because no sin.

5. Q. When began the Sacraments of Grace?

A. Circumcision began by Abraham, Genesis 17.9. and the Passover by Moses, Ex.
12.3.

6. Q. Why are these ended, and taken away?

A. Partly because Christ was the end of the Law, Romans 10.4. and the body of
those shaddows, Col. 2.17. and partly because God fitteth his Church according
to its age and quality, with spiritual (as the Nurse does her child, and the
Physician his patient with corporal) food and Physic.

7. Q. How many Sacraments has Christ ordained in his Church?

A. Two only as generally necessary to salvation, that is to say, Baptism, and
the Supper of the Lord.

8. Q What say you then to those 5 which the Church of Rome will have also to
be Sacraments, Confirmation, Penance, Extreme Unction, Orders, Matrimony?

A. That they be not Sacraments: First, because Christ did neither partake nor
ordain them. Secondly, because they be not all alike common to all; for Orders
can belong but to one profession. Thirdly, because they cross and oppose one
another, as Orders, and Matrimony, which cannot agree together (as they
suppose.)

9. Q. What meanest thou by this word Sacrament?

A. I mean an outward visible sign of an inward and spiritual Grace, given unto
us, ordained by Christ himself, as a means whereby we receive the same, and as
a pledge to assure us thereof.

10. Q. What do you show or touch in this answer?

A. The nature of a Sacrament, that it is an outward sign of an inward grace.
The Author, that it is from Christ. The Effect, that it does conveigh, and
assure the Grace which it signifies.

11. Q. Does then the outward sign always give, and confirm the grace which it
signifies?

A. Not properly of it self, and by the very action, but instrumentally where
it pleases God to make it effectual: for Simon Magus was in the gall of
bitterness after Baptism, Act. 8.13.23. Whether Judas did communicate is
controverted.
and Judas after the Lords Supper (if he received it) was a lost child of
perdition, Joh. 17.12.

12. Q. Why then does your common Catechism say, that in Baptism you are made a
member of Christ, the child of God, and an inheritor of the kingdom of Heaven?

A. To teach me what I should believe, and endeavor to make good.

13. Q. What do you learn out of that aforesaid of Sacraments for your practice?

A. First to be thankful to God for his gracious affording me such helps.

Secondly to rejoice in the use of them.

Thirdly to abhor the Doctrine of the Romish Church, which does add so many
of their own inventions to Gods Ordinances.

Sect. 7. Of Baptism.
1. Q. WHat is the outward visible sign or form in Baptism?

A. Water, wherein the person baptized is dipped, or etc.

2. Q. Is water alone sufficient without salt, spittle, oil, etc.

A. Yes, for we read of nothing else used in the first Institution, Mat. 3.16.
Act. 8.36, 37.

3. Q. And what is it to be dipped, or sprinkled in the name of the Father,
Son, and Holy Ghost?

A. It implies the grace of the Author, and the bond of the Receiver; to wit,
that by divine right we are created into the grace and favor, and bound to the
obedience, and service of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.

4. Q. Who must baptize?

A. Only the lawful Minister; for the Ministry of the Word and Sacraments was
one joint Commission, Mat. 28.19, 20. And no man is to undertake it without
lawful calling, Heb. 5.4. 1 Samuel 13.11. 2 Samuel 6.6.

5. Q. And who must be baptized?

A. Converts that are of age, and can, and will make right confession of faith,
Act. 8.36.37. and Infants of the Church, Act. 2.29.

6. Q. To what end then are Sureties or VVitnesses, if the covenant belong to
children of the church?

A. Because the child cannot offer it self, therefore the Sureties in its own,
and its parents behalf do offer it to the Church by confession and profession,
and in own, its Parents, and the Churches behalf do offer it to God by
covenanting.

7. Q. But do not the Sureties go too far in covenanting for the child?

A. No, for they do not meddle with Gods secret will and counsel, but with
his ordinance, whereto they have calling, Mat. 19.14. and covenant, Act. 2.39.

Secondly, their covenant is not to bind themselves to what shall be, but to
bind the child to what should be, 2 King. 11.17. 2 King. 23.3.

8. Q. What is the inward and spiritual grace in Baptism?

A. A death unto sin, and a new birth, etc.

9. Q. Is then sin fully taken away by, or in Baptism?

A. By the virtue of Christ's blood we are cleansed from the guilt of sin, 1
Ioh. 1.7. and by the power of his spirit we are freed, though not from the
disposition, and inclination to sin, yet from the body, reign, and dominion of
sin, Romans 6.6.12.14.

10. Q. What may be gathered out of this aforesaid of Baptism for practice?

A. 1. That Infants baptism must be hastened, and not needlessly delayed, Mat.
19.14.

2. That the performance of it be in all points reverently observed.

3. That we should not rest satisfied with our outward Baptism, but labor to
find, and show the inward Baptism of the Spirit.

Sect. 8. Of the Lords Supper.
1. Q. WHat is outwardly to be received in the Lords Supper?

A. Bread and Wine.

2. Q. Why might not our eating the Bread suffice to signify our receiving the
body and blood of Christ, seeing the Bread signifies the Body, and the Body
contains the Blood?

A. Because our remembrance and comfort, is of, and in Christ's blood shed out
of his body.

3. Q. But does not the dignity of the Minister require, or allow that he keep
the cup to himself?

A. No, for the dignity of the Minister is in the office of ministering, not in
the right of receiving.

4. Q. But is it not better the Wine should be forborne of the multitude,
rather then the spilling of it should be hazarded in carrying it about?

A. No, for if the Wine be spilt, it is a breach of decency, not a loss of
Christ's blood; but the wilful forbearing of the Cup (being a breach of Christ's
Ordinance) is both.

5. Q. How much must be eaten and drunken?

A. So much Bread as is delivered, and so much Wine as may show and prove
drinking.

6. Q. May none of the Bread be kept to sanctify the keeper, the fire, the
pot, the house?

A. No, for such use is not only beyond Christ's institution, but against the
nature of a Sacrament.

7. Q. What is the inward part, or thing signified in this Sacrament?

A. The Body and Blood of Christ.

8. Q. Are Bread and Wine then turned into the Body and Blood of Christ?

A. No, they keep still their own kind and nature, 1 Cor. 10.16. 1 Cor. 11.28.

9. Q. Why then does Christ say, This is my body, this is my blood, Mat. 26.26.

A. It is a Figurative speech common to the Sacraments: Circumcision is called
Gods Covenant, Genesis 17. 13. and the Lamb is called the Lords Passover, Ex.
12.11.21. and it is by Christ expounded spiritually, Jo. 6.63.

10. Q. Who may, or must receive this Sacrament?

A. None but they that are already by Baptism initiated members of the Church,
and are of age and reason to discern or make difference of the Lords Body, 1
Cor. 11.29. and are (at least) professors of faith and repentance, because holy
things must not be given to dogs, Mat. 7.6. and are more then one or two at
once, because it is a Communion.

11. Q. What may be gathered out of this aforesaid of the Lords Supper, for our
practice.

A. That we have need to prepare our selves before we receive it, and to be
intent in faith and zeal when we reecive it, and to be careful to show our
growth in grace, strength, and comfort after we have received it.

Sect. 9. Of the Creed.
1. Q. WHere do you chiefly find the sum or doctrine of your Faith?

A. In the Apostles Creed.

2. Q. Why is it called the Apostles Creed?

A. Because it is the sum of the Apostles doctrine.

3. Q. What needed then other Creeds to be added, or to come after?

A. To explain and confirm it against new Heresies, especially concerning the
Unity and the Trinity in the Godhead.

4. Q. What do you then when you say the Creed?

A. I make my confession of the Christian Faith.

5. Q. It it not a prayer?

A. No.

6. Q. How may that appear?

A. By consideration, first of the nature of it in its original use, which was
for converts to answer being questioned, What do you believe?

Secondly of its object, for it speaks not to God, but to men.

Thirdly of its subject, for it does neither ask, nor give thanks.

Fourthly of its gesture, or manner of utterance; for we kneel in prayer, but
stand up in confessing.

7. Q. And why so?

A. To show our humbleness in speaking to God, and our boldness in speaking to
men.

8. Q. But may it not be used in, or with our prayers?

A. Yes, by way of meditation, and to the purpose of our spiritual
confirmation, and consolation.

9. Q. And what is the sum of the several parts, or points of this Creed?

A. The confession of one God in three persons, and of the Church with its
prerogatives.

10. Q. Why do we speak particularly in the Creed (I believe) whereas in the
Lords Prayer we speak plurally, Our Father?

A. Because Charity does require us to pray one for another, but we cannot
believe, nor confess one for another.

11. Q. Why not believe one for another?

A. Because spiritually, as well as corporally each one must live by his own,
and not by another food and physic, Hab. 2.4.

12. Q. Why not confess one for another?

A. Because no man knows what is in another heart, 1 Cor. 2.11.

13. Q. What may be gathered for practice out of this aforesaid of the Creed?

A. That every one ought to learn it, and to labor, and desire rightly to
understand it, and to make diligent, and right use of it.

Sect. 10. Of the first Article.
1. Q. HOw many Articles be there in the Creed?

A. Twelve in common account, though not alike distinguished and expressed by
all men in the total number, or the particular enumeration.

2. Q. What is the first Article?

A. I believe in God the Father Almighty, maker of Heaven and Earth.

3. Q. What is it to believe in God?

A. It is to believe the being of God, that he is; and the truth of God, that
he is true; and the love of God to me, that he is mine, and I am his.

4. Q. What makes you believe there is a God?

A. 1. His power, both visible outwardly in the creation, Romans 1.20. and
sensible inwardly in every conscience, Romans 2.14.

2. The instinct of nature ever working in the heathen to make them rather take
any thing for God, then to have no God at all.

5. Q. What is God?

A. I may rather tell what he is not, because he is infinite, and cannot be
expressed.

6. Q. But how has he revealed himself in his Word?

A. That he is a Spirit, Joh. 4.24. and that he is of himself, Ex. 3.14.

7. Q. If God be a spirit, how is man said to be created in his image?

A. Not in regard of bodily shape, but of spiritual faculties, especially
knowledge, Col. 3.10. and holiness, Ephesians. 4.24.

8. Q. What mean you by God the Father?

A. I acknowledge the first person in Trinity.

9. Q. Is God then more then one?

A. He is one in substance or essence, yet three in person, 1 John 5.7.

10. Q. How is God Almighty?

A. Because he can do all works of power, Dan. 4.35. and cannot do any works
of weakness, Tit. 1.2. 2 Timothy 2.13. and because all rule is his, Romans 13.1.
and because all might is his, Act. 17.28.

11. Q. What mean you by Heaven and Earth?

A. All things that are visible, and invisible.

12. Q. How did God make them?

A. Immediately of, and by himself, without matter, means, or instrument, Psalm.
33.6. Heb. 11.3.

13. Q. What follows out of this aforesaid of the first Article for
instruction to our practice?

A. That as I know God by his Works, so I must acknowledge him in all the use I
make of them, and abuse none of them.

Secondly, I must depend and trust on him for my preservation and salvation (in
every kind) of whom I had my creation.

Thirdly, that I must fear him, knowing that he who has power to create, has
also power to destroy.

Sect. 11. Of the second Article.
1. Q. What is the second Article?

A. And in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord.

2. Q. What word is wanting here?

A. I believe: For I must believe in God the Father, God the Son, and in God
the Holy Ghost.

3. Q. What does the name Jesus signify?

A. A Savior, Mat. 1.21.

4. Q. Whom does he save?

A. As many as do receive him by faith, Joh. 1.12.

5. Q. What does the name Christ signify?

A. Anointed.

6. Q. How does this belong to our Savior?

A. By special excellency, he being (as none else ever was) a King, Mat. 21.4.
a Priest, Heb. 5.6. and a Prophet, Act. 3.22.

7. Q. Does the name Christian imply the like in us?

A. Yes, that (spiritually) we are Kings to reign over our corruptions, Rev.
5.10. and Priests to offer spiritual sacrifices, 1 Pet. 2.5. and Prophets to
provoke and to exhort one another, Heb. 10.24, 25. and to distribute our
received graces, 1 Pet. 4.10.

8. Q. How is Christ the Son of God?

A. By an unspeakable manner of everlasting generation, Is. 53.8.

9. Q. But how is he Gods only Son, when as we also are called Gods Sons, Gal.
4 6, 7. and the Angels likewise, Job 1.6. and 38.7?

A. We are Sons by Adoption, the Angels by Creation, but Christ is the only
natural Son of God, Heb. 1.5.

10. Q. And how is Christ our Lord?

A. As he is God, because he has created us, and as he is God and Man, because
he has redeemed us, Act. 2.36.

11. Q. What learn you (for practice) out of all aforesaid of the second
Article?

A. To be comforted and strengthened in Faith, and in Prayer, Heb. 4.15, 16.2
Tim. 1.12. Secondly, to obey Christ, Mal. 1.6. Thirdly, to imitate him. Joh.
13.13.

Sect. 12. Of the third Article.
1. Q. WHat is the third Article?

A. Which was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary.

2. Q. What means this, Conceived by the Holy Ghost?

A. His miraculous, and supernatural Creation in the womb of the Virgin
(Incarnate) says the Nicene Creed. Secondly his sanctification, Luke 1.35.
Thirdly, his union with the divine nature, Joh. 1.14.

3. Q. Why was Christ conceived by the Holy Ghost?

A. That he might be without sin, 2 Cor. 5.21.

4. Q. Why must he be without sin?

A. Because he was to be united to the Godhead, and because he was to redeem
sinners.

5. Q. Was this conception and birth of Christ true and proper, or was it
only a miraculous passing of a miraculous, and heavenly body (as some have
thought?)

A. It was true and proper, though supernatural (as aforesaid) for the words
are plain in the Creed, and Is. 7.14. and Luke 2.6.

6. Q. When where, and how was Christ born?

A. In the fullness of time, Gal. 4.4. At Bethlehem the appointed place, Mal.
2.5. In a stable, and laid in a manger, Luke 2.7.

7. Q. Why was Christ born of a Virgin?

A. That he might be without sin (as aforesaid.)

8. Q. Is not Virginity hereby honored above Wedlock?

A. No, for this Virgin was a Wife, Mat. 1.20, 24.

9. Q. What then is hereby honored?

A. The sex of Womanhood, because as man's fall so also his recovery was
thorough a woman: And a one woman was of a man alone, so one man is of a woman
alone.

10. Q. Did Christ's Mother continue still a Virgin?

A. It is a point of Piety, though not of Faith so to think.

11. Q. How comes that Christ's mother has no other titles here but Virgin
Mary?

A. Because the Scripture gives her no other, Mat. 1.18. Luke 1.27.

12. Q. Do we then owe her no more honor then so?

A. Yes, we are bound to honor her, in praising God for her, in reverent
estimation, and memory of her, and imitation of her Virtues and Graces, but
without any trusting in her, or worshipping of her.

13. Q. What learn you (for practice) out of this aforesaid of the third
article?

A. That seeing God has so honored my nature, as to unite it himself, I must
take heed of dishonouring it in my self or in others.

God) God became Man.

Sect. 13. Of the fourth Article.
1. Q. WHat is the fourth Article?

A. Suffered under Ponce Pilate, was crucified, dead, and buried. And some do
add to this (as part of Christ's Humiliation) He descended into Hell. Others do
refer it (as part of his Exaltation) to the fifth Article.

2. Q. How could Christ suffer being God?

A. He was also man, and suffered in his humane nature; and so are those places
to be understood, Act. 20.28. Act. 3.15. 1 Cor. 2.8.

undergo the curse of the Law for us, Gal. 3 13.

8. Q. Was Christ's burial part of his suffering?

A. Not properly, but (being part of his Humiliation) it is an appurtenance of
his suffering.

9. Q. What needed his burial, seeing death could not hold him long?

A. Besides the charitable respect both of dead and living (always had of all)
in use of burying, it helped to prove and confirm the truth both of his death
and resurrection.

10. Q. What is Christ's death and burial to us, seeing we dye nevertheless?

A. It has taken away the proper nature of death that is, cursednesse, Hos.
13.14. 2 Timothy 1.10. and has turned it into a blessing, and the grave into a
bed o^ rest, Rev. 14.13.

11. How is this interpreted, He descended into hell?

A. Some take it for the local descension of Christ soul, and some for the
hellish pains he suffered in the Garden, and upon the Cross.

12. Q. What is out of question, and of all sides confessed in, and concerning
this?

A. That Christ did suffer nothing after his death for at his death he said, It
is finished, Joh. 19.30. and he fulfilled whatsoever was necessary to redeem
us, 1 John 2.2. Heb. 1.3.

11. Q. What do you gather (for practice) out of all aforesaid of the fourth
Article?

A. 1. That I must be ready to suffer for Christ whatsoever extremity, and
under whatsoever authority, seeing he so suffered for us, Romans 8.17.

Secondly, that I must not fear death, nor the grave, seeing Christ has taken
away the curse and shame thereof, Ps. 4.8.

A. Besides his many appearances, the Jews did prove it by their own lie, Mat,
28.13.

4. Q. What especial proofs did he himself show?

5. Q. Was his body then still a natural body?

A. Yes, in respect of substance, though spiritual in ^espect of accidents and
qualities, 1 Cor. 15.44.

6. Q. And were his wounds still to be reserved?

A. Some think so, that they shall be for convictio^ of the wicked at the last
day, Rev. 1.7. Others think they were but for present purpose to confirm the
Disciples; as (no doubt) his eating only was.

7. Q. Why did not Christ rise till the third day?

A. To confirm the truth of his death, Mat. 18.16. and to fulfill the Figure
foreshewed in Jonah, Mat. 12.40.

8. Q. What use is now made of Christ's rising day?

A. It is ordained to be our Sabbath, as appears both by the use of it, Act.
20.7. 1 Cor. 16.1, 2. and by the name of it, Rev. 1.10. For it is plain that
Christ rose the first day of the Jews week, Mat. 28.1, 2.

9. Q. What benefit have we by Christ's Resurrection?

A. We have the first Resurrection taught us, and the second warranted us.

10. Q. What mean you by the first Resurrection?

resurrection, Romans 6.3, 4.

12. Q. What mean you by the second Resurrection?

A. The rising again of our bodies from the Grave.

13. Q. How is this warranted to us?

A. Because Christ being our Head, and we his Members, we are sure to partake
of all his benefits, and therefore to follow him in the resurrection, 1 Cor.
15.12.

14. Q. What learn you (for practice) out of this aforesaid of the fifth article?

A. To feed spiritually, and not carnally in the Sacrament, because Christ's
body (being still substantial) cannot be in many places at once, therefore not
really in the Sacrament.

Secondly, to use the Sabbath to the honor of the Son of righteousness, Mal.
4.2.

Thirdly, to dye unto sin, that I may rise unto righteousness.

settling of his Church in things pertaining to the order and government thereof,
Act. 1.3.

6. Q. How did he ascend?

A. No doubt in glory and triumph.

7. Q. How may that appear?

A. Partly (as it is probable) in the attendance of the raised bodies, Mat.
27.52. but especially in that he led captivity captive, Ephesians. 4.8.

8. Q. Is there need of sitting, or use of seats in Heaven?

A. No, for glorified bodies are not subject to weakness, 1 Cor. 15.43. Rev.
21.4.

9. Q. Why then is Gods throne, and his sitting thereon mentioned, Dan. 7.9.
and Rev. 4.2?

A. To set forth God to our capacity by the similitude of a Judge.

10. Q. Is not then the right hand of God here properly to be understood?

A. No, for God is a spirit, Joh. 4.24.

11. Q. What means this then, And sits on the right hand of God?

A. It is a borrowed, or figurative speech, signifying his supreme dignity
above all creatures, and his government over his Church, Ephesians. 1.20, 21, 22. and
his mediation, Romans 8.34. and his power over his enemies, 1 Cor. 15.25.

in conversation, Phil. 3.20.

triumphed over the Kingdom of darkness.

godly nature, 2 Pet. 1.4.

the holy Ghost?

A. No, he works many other works common to the reprobate in faculties both
temporal (as courage, Iud. 6.34. and 14.6. and artificial skill, Ex. 31.3.
and also spiritual, as understanding the truth, Mat. 7.22: and rejoicing in
it, Mat. 13.20.

9. Q. But is the work of regeneration alike in all?

8. Q. But does not the plurality of this, and the words following, direct, and
invite us to pray with company?

A. Yes (no doubt) else Christ would not have so approved it, as Mat. 18.20.

9. Q. May I not then call God my Father?

A. No doubt I may in my particular faith, but Christ here sets my Faith awork
in the word, Father, and my Charity in the word, Our.

10. Q. Is God only in heaven?

A. No, but every where, 1 King. 8.27. Act. 17.27.

11. Q. Why then do we say (which art in heaven?)

A. Because there specially he reveals, and communicates himself, Is. 66.1.

12. Q. What do you gather (for practice) out of all aforesaid of the Preface
of the Lords Prayer?

A. That we ought to perform the duties of children to God, because we call him
Father, and the duties of brethren one to another, because we call him, our
Father.

Secondly, that always (especially in prayer) I must be heavenly minded,
because I profess my Father to be in heaven, Phil. 3.20. 1 Pet. 1.4.

Sect. 24. Of the first Petition.
1. Q. HOw many Petitions be there in the Lords Prayer?

A. Six.

2. Q. How may they be divided?

A. Into two equal parts; the first three concerning Gods due, the latter
three concerning our own need.

3. Q. Which is the first Petition?

A. Hallowed be thy name.

4. Q. Has God any proper name sufficient to express him?

A. No, for his nature is infinite.

5. Q. What may we understand here by his name?

A. Himself, and whatsoever does declare him to us.

6. Q. Why do you say himself?

A. Because he answers, and puts his nature for his name, Exodus 3.14.

7. Q. And what especially does declare him to us?

A. His Titles, Ex. 6.3. Deuteronomy. 28.58. Secondly his Attributes, Ex. 33.19. with
34.6. Thirdly, his Ordinances, as Word and Sacraments, Act. 9.15. Fourthly his
Works, Romans 1.20.

8. Q. Can God receive any addition to his holiness?

A. No; for he is absolute and perfect in himself, Job 22.23. Ps. 16.2.

9. Q. How then must Gods name be hallowed?

A. By all creatures in their kind, Psalm. 145.10. and Psalm. 148.8.

10. Q. How are we for our parts to hallow it?

A. With our tongue, Ps. 57.8. with our heart, 1 Pet. 3.15. and with our hands,
Mat. 5.16.

11. Q. Is then Gods name only to be hallowed?

A. Yes, for holiness is to the Lord, Exodus 28.36. and becomes his house for
ever, Ps. 93.5.

12. Q. What then do you ask in this petition?

A. Grace for my self, and all people rightly to glorify God.

13. Q. What do you specially learn (for practice) out of all aforesaid of the
first petition?

A. First to prefer Gods respects and service always before mine own.

Secondly, to direct, and intend all that I ask or do to Gods glory, 1 Cor.
10.31.

Thirdly, to think all that I am, and have, too little for this, 1 Cor. 6.20.

Sect. 25. Of the second Petition.
1. Q. WHat is the second petition?

A. Thy Kingdom come.

2. Q. What is here meant by thy Kingdom?

A. The spiritual Government of the Church Militant. Ps. 1 10.2.

3. Q. Who is King of this Kingdom?

A. Christ, 1 Cor. 15.25.

4. Q. Who are the subjects?

A. The Saints, Rev. 15.3.

5. Q. What are the Laws?

A. The Scriptures, Is. 8.20. Luke 16.29.

6. Q. Who are the enemies?

A. Satan and all his Instruments, Ephesians. 2.2. and 6.12.

7. Q. What do you ask then in saying, thy Kingdom come?

A. The preserving, advancing, and fulfilling of the Church Militant, Ps. 122.6.

8. Q. How, or wherein?

A. In the general spreading of the Gospel, Mat. 24.14. and in the particular
reigning of the spirit in every one, Luke 17.21.

9. Q. Is not the coming of the Kingdom of glory here also to be understood?

A. In general (no doubt) it may, as Rev. 22.20. and the fulfilling of the
Church Militant implies it.

10. Q. But must we not here understand our own death for speeding us to glory?

A. We are not here bound to it, for it is lawful to preserve our own life,
Mat. 10.23. and to pray for the same, 2 King. 20.2, 3, 4, 5. and the restoring
of health is Gods mercy, Phil. 2.27.

11. Q. How is the coming of this Kingdom effected?

A. By the Ministry of the Word, Mat. 9.37, 38.

12. Q What do you learn (for practice) out of all aforesaid of the second
Petition?

A. First, to acknowledge the true author of all grace, help, and comfort, Jam.
1.17.

Secondly, to do my endeavor to help to build, and not to pull down this
Kingdom, 1 These. 5.11.

Thirdly, to abhor the Popish Headship, and Government of the Church, in the
title of General Vicar.

Sect. 26. Of the third Petition.
1. Q. WHat is the third Petition?

A. Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven.

2. Q. Is it not idle to pray Gods will may be done, which will be done whether
we will or no? Psalm. 135.6. Dan. 4.35.

A. No, for we do not pray for God in respect of his absolute will in working,
but for our selves in respect of his will in relation to us in commanding, or
requiring.

3. Q. And how far may we understand this will?

A. Both in what he will do to, or with us, and in what he will have us do
to, or for him.

4. Q. How do we ask the former to be done?

A. That by faith and patience we may bear whatsoever his will is to lay upon
us, as Mat. 26.39.

5. Q. How do we ask the latter to be done?

A. By our fulfilling the rules of his revealed will.

6. Q. Where are those rules revealed?

A. In the Scriptures, which are therefore called Gods Testaments, Gal. 4.24.

7. Q. And what are those rules?

A. They are two especially; the one of Faith, Ioh. 6.40. the other of
holiness, 1 These. 4.3.

8. Q. But how can Gods will be done in earth being changeable, as it seems by
that of Abraham, Genesis 22. and of Balaam, Number. 22?

A. Gods will was not changed, but fulfilled to, and by Abraham: for it was but
the trial of his Faith, which he fulfilled, Heb. 11.17. Neither was it changed
to Balaam, for God withstood not simply his going, but his loving the wages of
unrighteousness, 2 Pet. 2.15, 16.

9. Q. Do we not pray against our selves, and the forgiveness of our sins when
we pray, his will be done, seeing he is just?

A. No; for we pray to him as to our Father, and for the fulfilling of his
Fatherly will in grace.

10. Q. Why do you say, as it is in heaven?

A. Not for equalities sake, to match the Saints and the Angels, but for
similitude, that we may imitate them in spiritual worship, Joh. 4.24.

11. Q. In what particulars?

A. Freeness, readiness, sincerenesse, unpartialnesse, constantnesse.

12. Q. What do you learn (for practice) out of all aforesaid of the third
petition?

A. First, to deny mine own will, that I may fulfill Gods.

Secondly, to search and enquire into my heavenly Fathers will.

Thirdly, to being heaven upon earth, worshipping God in spirit and truth, Ps.
3.20.

Sect. 27. Of the fourth Petition.
1. Q. What is the fourth Article?

A. Give us this day our daily bread.

2. Q. What do you understand here by Bread?

A. 1. All temporal and corporal necessaries.

2. Gods blessing upon them.

3 Q. How do you bring all temporal and corporal necessaries under the name
of Bread?

A. Because that is the chiefest, Genesis 28.20. Is. 55.2.

4. Q. How do you bring Gods blessings under the name of Bread?

A. Because Bread unblest has no strength or nourishment, Ps. 78.30, 31. Hag.
1.6. Luke 12.15.

5. Q. Why do you ask Bread to be given?

A. Because we do not inherit it, we cannot earn it, nor of our selves provide
it.

6. Q. Why do we not inherit it?

A. Because in Adams fall we have lost our right, 1 Cor. 15.22.

7. Q. Why can we not earn it?

A. Because that doing all that we are commanded is but our duty, Luke 17.10.
Genesis 32.10.

8. Q. Why can we not of our selves provide it?

A. Because God alone creates and prospers, and we cannot make one hair
white or black, Mat. 5.36.

9. Q. How then may Bread become ours?

A. By Gods free gift, through our Adoption in Christ, Heb. 1.2. 1 Cor. 3.22.
and through his blessing upon our lawful calling, 2 These. 3.12.

10. Q. Is it not lawful to provide Bread for to morrow, seeing we say, our
daily bread?

A. Yes, for Joseph in plenty stored for Famine, Genesis 41.48. and we must
provide for our household, 1 Timothy 5.8.

11. Q. Why then do we so speak?

A. To show our moderatenesse in our selves in respect of our caring, Mat.
6.25. and our confidence and dependence upon Gods renewing his blessings every
morning, Lam. 3.23.

12. Q. What do you learn (for practice) out of all aforesaid of the fourth
Petition?

A. First to apply my self chiefly to God for my having of Bread, Jam. 1.17.

Secondly, to apply my self to means of labor, and not to think to have it by
bare asking, 2 These. 3.10.

Thirdly, to be thankful for having it, and not to forget the giver, Deuteronomy.
6.11, 12.

Sect. 28 Of the fifth Petition.
1. Q. WHat is the fifth Petition?

A. And forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against us.

2. Q. What do you understand by Trespasses?

A. Both the fault, and the punishment of our sins:

3. Q. How do you gather this?

A. Because Mat. 6.12. it is said ( debts) which must needs be punishments: For
we owe to God, not sins, but suffering for sins; but Luke 11.4. it is said (
sins) which plainly signifies the act or fault.

4. Q. What do you understand in the word, forgive?

A. Both parts of our Justification, viz. the not imputing our sins to us, Romans
4.7. and the imputing of righteousness to us, ver. 5.

5. Q. Are we to ask forgiveness of sins only in general?

A. No, for we are directed also to particular confession, Prove. 28.13.

6. Q. Who may forgive sins?

A. None but God, Mar. 2.7.

7. Q. Must we not then forgive one another?

A. Yes, as concerning our own wrongs, Mat. 18.21.

8. Q. But does not Christ give power to the Ministers to forgive sins? Mat.
18.18. Joh. 20.23.

A. Not properly to forgive sins, but to pronounce, and declare it; as also in
the Sacrament, not to give, but to sign and seal grace; as also the Levitical
Priests had power to pronounce, but not to make clean, Lev. 13.

9. Q. Must we say (as we forgive) or (for we also forgive?)

A. Either of both; for the former is given us, Mat. 6.12. and the latter, Luke
11.4.

10. Q. Do we compare with God in the former?

A. No, but we show our selves ready to imitate and obey him, Luke 6.36.

11. Q. Do we in the latter plead cause of Gods forgiving us?

A. No, but do comfort our selves in his promise, Mat. 6.14.

12. Q. Must we then forgive all wrongs and injuries?

A. Yes, in respect of malice, and private revenge, Romans 12.19.

13. Q. What ground then have private quarrels and duels?

A. None but natures corruption, as in Cain, Genesis 4.

14. Q. But did not David undertake a duel, 1 Samuel 17.

A. Not in his own cause, nor out of a private spirit, nor by ordinary motion.

15. Q. What do you learn (for practice) out of all aforesaid of the fifth
petition?

A. First, to confess my sins to God, for that is employed in asking
forgiveness.

Secondly, to forsake them, Prove. 28.13.

Thirdly to abhor Popish Pardons, and Auricular Confession.

Sect. 29. Of the sixth Petition.
1. Q. WHat is the sixth Petition?

A. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.

2. Q. Is God the author of temptation?

A. No, for God tempts no man, Jam. 1.13.

3. Q. How then does he lead into temptation?

A. Diversely in respect of the Elect, and of the Reprobate.

4. Q. How in respect of the Elect?

A. He does tempt or try them, by suffering them to fall into diverse occasions,
Jam. 1.2. yet so as his grace is still sufficient for them, 2 Cor. 12.9.

5. Q. Why does he do this to them whom he loves?

A. For their outward probation, 1 Pet. 1.7. as in Abraham, Genesis 22.1. and in
Job, Job 1. and for their inward confirmation, and consolation, Romans 8.28.

6. Q. How in respect of the Reprobate?

A. By withdrawing his grace, Exodus 7.3. and by giving them up to their own
hearts lusts, Romans 1.24. and to Satan's power, 2 These. 2.11.

7. Q. Cannot Satan then tempt us without God?

A. No, for he could not touch Job, nor the Swine till he had leave, Job 1.12.
Mat. 8.31.

8. Q. What is meant by deliver us from evil?

A. It is the exposition of the former part of the Petition: for then he
leads into temptation when he does not deliver from evil.

9. Q. Is there deliverance wrought only to, and with us?

A. No, but rather in us, by both parts of Sanctification, viz. Mortification,
and Vivification which go together, Romans 8.10.

10. Q. Is evil then here only to be taken for sin?

A. No, but also for the author of sin, Mat. 13.19. and for the effect or issue
of sin, that is punishment, Am. 3.6.

11. Q. What do you learn (for practice) out of all aforesaid of the sixth
petition?

A. First, to watch for temptations, and not to live securely, 1 Pet. 5.8.

Secondly, to put on all the armor of God, Ephesians. 6.11.

Thirdly, not to trust to my self, but to seek and rely on Gods help that
strengthens me, Ps. 44.6. Ps. 121.1. Phil. 4.13.

Sect. 30. Of the Conclusion of the Lords prayer.
1. Q. WHat is the Conclusion of the Lords Prayer?

A. For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever, and ever,
Amen.

2. Q. Is this any part of the prayer?

A. Yes.

3. Q. How can it be, seeing it asks nothing?

A. Because it is a thanksgiving, which is a kind or species of Prayer, 1 Timothy
2.1.

4. Q. How can you show this to be a Thanksgiving?

A. Because it acknowledges and rendereth to God his right and due.

5. Q. Have not men also their kingdom, power, and glory?

A. Yes, but not (as God) generally, properly eternally.

6. Q. What mean you by generally?

A. In, and over all creatures the kingdom, the power, the glory.

7. Q. What mean you by properly?

A. That it is without dependence on any other (thing.)

8. Q. What mean you by eternally?

A. That in these God has neither beginning, nor ending (for ever.)

9. Q. Is there then nothing herein but thanks giving?

A. Yes, it is also a ground or confirmation of our asking?

10. Q. How so?

A. Because as we begin the prayer with mention of Gods lovingnesse in the name
of Father, so we conclude with his ableness in acknowledging his kingdom,
power, glory.

11. Q. What mean you by the word Amen?

A. It is my setting to my seal in point of believing to receive what I ask,
Joh. 3.33.

12. Q. How may this appear?

A. Because it is a word not only of wishing, but of assurance, 2 Cor. 1.20.
Rev. 3.14.

13. Q. How far may we take assurance in our prayers?

A. That they shall be heard and granted directly, and indirectly.

14. Q. How may our prayers be granted indirectly?

A. By delaying, Mat. 15.22. by exchanging, 2 Cor. 12.9. by denying, I am. 4.3.

15. Q. What learn you (for practice) out of all aforesaid of the Conclusion of
the Lords Prayer?

A. First, to pray with humility because of Gods greatness.

Secondly, to pray with confidence, because of Gods ableness.

Thirdly, to pray with constancy, because of both.

Sect. 31. Of the Law in general.
1. Q. YOu have set forth Prayer for the prime fruit of Faith, and the chief of
good works, what more fruit has faith necessary for the proof of it?

A. Obedience to the Moral Law.

2. Q. Why not to the Ceremonial and Judicial Law which the Jews also had?

A. Because the former being an ordinance of religious service, consisting most
in Types of Christ, was was ended in his coming; and the latter being an
Ordinance of Politic Government for the Jews Commonwealth, is dissolved with
it.

3. Q. How do these differ from the Moral Law?

A. 1. In direction, or extent; that was for all, these but for the Jews. 2. In
duration, that was for ever, these but for a time. 3. In dignity, these yield
and give place to that, Mat. 12.3.

4. Q. What then is the Moral Law?

A. A brief sum of the whole duty of man?

5. Q. How can this be the sum of all, seeing it is called but ten words, Ex.
34.28. Deuteronomy. 10.4.

A. Though they be but ten words or heads of matter, yet they be exceeding
large ones, Ps. 119.96.

6. Q. How may the largeness of them appear?

A. By five rules especially.

7. Q. Which is the first?

A. In each Commandment affirmative, is contained the contrary negative, and
in each negative is contained the contrary affirmative, Mat. 25.42.

8. Q. Which is the second?

A. When any thing is commanded, or forbidden, all means or occasions thereto
are likewise commanded or forbidden, Mat. 5.22.

9. Q Which is the third?

A. The breach of one Commandment is the breach of all, Jam. 2.10.

10. Q. Which is the fourth?

A. The Commandments require perfection of obedience inward and outward, as
Adam before his fall, Deuteronomy. 6.5.

11. Q. Which is the fifth?

A. In every breach of the Commandments the Accessory is guilty with the
Principal.

12. Q. How may one man be accessory to another sin?

A. Many ways, especially by furthering, and by suffering it.

12. Q. May the guiltiness of the accessory acquit the agent?

A. No, for such excuse is vain, Genesis 3.12, 13.

14. Q. But if a man take occasion of evil from me, when indeed it is not
properly occasion of evil, shall his taking it make me guilty?

A. No; for though David in his humility confesses the occasioning of the
death of the Priests, 1 Samuel 22.22. yet he is justified therein, Mat. 12.3.

15. Q. What learn you (for practice) out of all aforesaid of the Law?

A. First, to pray, open mine eyes that I may see the wondrous things of thy
Law, Ps. 119.18.

Secondly, to love and delight in every part of it.

Thirdly, to take heed of being partaker of other men's sins, 1 Timothy 5.22.

Sect. 32. Of the Preface of the Law.
1. Q. WHere and how does the Moral Law begin?

A. Exodus 20.1. And God spoke all these words, saying, I am the Lord thy God
which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.

2. Q. What do you find in this beginning?

A. A double Preface; one of Moses (And God spoke all these words saying)
another of God (I am the Lord thy God which brought thee out of the land of
Egypt, out of the house of bondage.)

3 Q. What do you observe in the former Preface?

A. Four circumstances.

1. The time (and, or then.)

2. The Author (God.)

3. The manner of delivery (spoke.)

4. The sum (all these words.)

4. Q What observe you in the first circumstance?

A. That the Law is holy, Romans 7.12. for God was careful to hallow the people
for the receiving of the Law, by a great deal of preparation, as appears
chap. 19.

5. Q. What observe you in the second circumstance?

A. That the Moral Law has no less then Gods own Authority.

6. Q. What observe you in the third circumstance?

A. That God teaches men especially by the ear.

7. Q. What observe you in the fourth circumstance?

A. That each Commandment has alike strength and bond upon us.

8. Q. Is the second place (aforesaid) pertaining to the whole Law?

A. Yes, Lev. 19.36, 37.

9. Q. Is it not rather the affirmative part of the first Commandment?

A. No, for it commands nothing, and it is needless to express both parts,
by the first of the aforesaid five rules.

10. Q. What observe you further in it?

A. That God presses the people to obedience by his power (I am the Lord) and
by his love (thy God) and by their experience of both (which have brought thee
out of the land of Egypt.)

11. Q What is this to us?

A. The same, or as much as it was to them, because he is still the same Lord,
and our God, and has brought us out of the spiritual Egypt of sin, death,
hell, paganism, papism.

12. Q. But does not St. Paul say, Romans 6.14. Ye are not under the Law?

A. But he expounds himself, Gal. 3.13. that we are freed from the curse of
the Law, not from the rule and bond of it, Mat. 5.17.

13. Q. What learn you (for practice) out of all aforesaid of the Preface of
the Law?

A. First, to prepare my self always to the receiving of God word.

Secondly, to rejoice in the use of the ear, and to abhor imagery in Gods
service, Deuteronomy. 4.12, 15.

Thirdly, to fear the breaking of that which had a glorious ordination, Psalm.
4.4.

Sect. 33. Of the first Commandment.
1. Q. HOw many Commandments be there?

A. Ten, Ex. 34.28. Deuteronomy. 10.4.

2. Q. How are they divided?

A. Into two Tables; the former containing our duty to God in the four first
precepts, the latter containing our duty to our neighbor, in the six last
precepts.

3. Q. How then does the Romish Church make three precepts in the former Table,
and seven in the latter?

A. They do wrongfully confound the two first into one, and divide the last
into two.

4. Q. How may this wrong appear?

A. 1. Because in that which they make one precept, there is distinct different
matter; viz. First, who must be worshipped, and secondly how.

2. Because the tenth Commandment (which they divide) runs in one and the
same word, and is so summed, Romans 7.7. and 13.9.

3. Because Exodus 20.17. house is put foremost, and wife is between house and
goods; but Deuteronomy. 5.21. wife is put first, therefore the lust of neither of them
alone forbidden can be the ninth Commandment.

5. Q. What then is the first Commandment?

A. Thou shall have no other Gods before me.

6. Q. How many parts be there in this Commandment?

A. Three.

1. A Negative.

2. An Affirmative.

3. A Reason.

7. Q. What is the Negative part?

A. It forbids our having any false God.

8. Q. How may a false God be had?

A. Outwardly by corporal Idolatry, or inwardly by setting up an Idol in our
heart, Ezekiel. 14.3.

9. Q Is nothing here forbidden but having of a false God?

A. Yes, all degrees of infidelity, and other issues of original corruption in
our thoughts of God.

10. Q. What is the Affirmative part of this Commandment?

A. Thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy soul,
etc. Deuteronomy. 6.5. Mat. 22.37.

11. Q. What is the reason hereto belonging?

A. It is in the words (before me) because nothing can be behind him, nor out
of his sight, Heb. 4.13.

12. Q. What do you learn (for practice) out of allaforesaid of the first
Commandment?

A 1. To take heed of joining any partner with God, I must have him solely, Is.
42.8.

2. To take heed of barring God in any thing I am, or have; he must have me
wholly, Luke 14.26.

3. To acknowledge his presence always, Ps. 139.3.

Sect. 34. Of the second Commandment.
1. Q. WHat is the second Commandment?

A. Thou shall not make to thy self any graven Image, nor the likeness of any
thing, etc.

2. Q. How many parts be there in this Commandment?

A. Three, a Negative, an Affirmative, and a Reason.

3. Q. What is the Negative part?

A. It forbids false worshipping of God.

4. Q. How is it here expressed?

A. By the use of Images.

5. Q. Is all use of Images then unlawful?

A. No, for skill in such workmanship is of the spirit of God, Ex. 31.1, 2, 3.

6. Q. How far then is the use of Images unlawful?

A. The use of any Image as an help in Gods service, Hab. 2.18. Is. 44.10. and
the making or having of any Image or likeness of God, Is. 40.18. is unlawful.

7. Q. What is the affirmative part of this Commandment?

A. That we worship God according to his will.

8. Q. How is that?

A. In spirit and truth, Joh. 4.24.

9. Q. What is the reason here added?

A. For I the Lord thy God am a jealous God.

10. Q. How is Gods jealousy expressed?

A. By punishing the breakers, and blessing the keepers of this Law.

11. Q. How punishing?

A. The sins of the Fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth
generation.

12. Q. How can this be just?

A. It is here expressed (in them that hate me.)

13. Q. How blessing?

A. In an unlimitted measure (unto thousands in them that love him.)

14. Q. What learn you (for practice) out of all aforesaid of the second
Commandment?

A. 1. To abhor Romish bowing to, and before Images.

2. To worship God after his will, and not after mine own will.

mercy.

Sect. 35. Of the third Commandment.

A. All abusing it to ill purpose (as charming, cursing, mocking) or to idle
purpose, as vain talking, or swearing.

6. Q. Is all swearing then unlawful?

A. No, for we must swear in truth, in judgment, and in righteousness, Jer.
4.2.

7. Q. What is required to, and in the truth and righteousness of an oath?

A. That it be of a true thing, and truly.

8. Q. What mean you by a true thing?

A. In respect of the time past, that nothing be affirmed which is not, or
denied which is; and in respect of the time to come, that nothing be sworn or
vowed that is either wicked, as Act. 23.12. or uncertain, as Jud. 11.30. Mat.
14.7.

9. Q. What mean you by truly?

A. 1. That it be not vainly, nor idly, Jam. 5.12. Hos. 4.1, 2.

2. That it be not with false meaning to deceive the hearer; for an oath is
called the givers, Genesis 24.8. Jos. 2.17.20. because the sense of it (before
God) is as the giver, or hearer of it (and not as the taker) understands it.

3. That it be by the true God, Deuteronomy. 6.13. Is. 65.16. Jer. 5.7. and 12.16.
Psalm. 63.11. because he alone knows the heart, and is able to answer all
truth and falsehood.

10. Q. What is the reason added to this Commandment?

A. For the Lord will not hold him guiltless that takes his name in vain.

11. Q. What do you learn (for practice) out of all aforesaid of the third
Commandment?

A. 1. To fear an oath, Deuteronomy. 28.58.

2. To hallow Gods name in all things, Col. 3.17.

3. To abhor Popish equivocations.

Sect. 36. Of the fourth Commandment.
1. Q. WHat is the fourth Commandment?

A. Remember that thou keep holy the Sabbath day, etc.

2. Q What are the parts in this Commandment?

A. An Affirmative, a Negative, and a Reason.

3. Q. What is the Affirmative part?

A. That which is expressed, viz. That the Sabbath day must be hallowed.

4. Q. What is the Negative part?

A. That which is also (partly) expressed, that the Sabbath day must not be
profaned.

5. Q. Is our Sabbath the same day of the week as it was from the beginning?

A. No, it is changed from the seventh to the first day of the week in honor
of Christ's Resurrection.

6. Q. By whom was it so changed?

A. By the Apostles, Act. 20.7. 1 Cor. 16.2. And it is probable it was by
Christ himself; for they observed his commission, 1 Cor. 11.23. 1 Cor. 15.3.
and it is called the Lords day, Rev. 1.10.

7. Q. How could that be changed which was in the Moral Law commanded?

A. The seventh day was to the Jews typical and ceremonial, but a Sabbath is to
all men moral.

8. Q. How does the morality of the Sabbath appear?

A. First, because it was (at first) ordained in time of innocence.

Secondly, because it was published in, and with the Moral Law.

Thirdly, because it is the employment of the Ministry.

Fourthly, because it is the Law of nature to have a time set apart for own
rest, and for Gods service.

9. Q. What then is here specially required?

A. Remembering the Sabbath, which implies our preparation; and hallowing it,
which implies our holy resting to godliness, and not to idleness or sin.

10. Q. Who are herein bound?

A. Every one for himself, and every householder for all that are of, or in his
house.

11. Q. Is labor then unlawful absolutely on the Sabbath day?

A. No, not in cases of piety, and of charity, Mat. 12.5, 12.

12. Q. What is the reason pertaining to this Commandment?

A. It is double. First of equity, because God has given us six days.
Secondly of authority, because he hallowed the seventh.

13. Q. What learn you (for practice) out of all aforesaid of the fourth
Commandment?

A. 1. To forecast forecast for this days service, that I may attend it when
it comes.

Secondly, to observe it conscionably as a Moral precept.

Thirdly, to look to all under my charge for their observing it.

Sect. 37. Of the fifth Commandment.
1. Q. WHat is the fifth Commandment?

A. Honor thy Father, and thy Mother that thy days, etc.

2. Q. How many parts are there in this Commandment?

A. That which is expressed in the words, Honor thy Father, and thy Mother.

4. Q. What is the Negative part?

A. That which on the contrary is necessarily employed, Thou shall not dishonor
them.

5. Q. Are we here to understand only our natural parents?

A. No, but also spiritual Fathers, as Ministers, 1 Cor. 4.15. and political
Fathers, as Magistrates, Genesis 45.8. and oeconomical Fathers, as Masters, 2
King. 2.12. and 5.13. and Matrimonial Fathers, as Husbands, Ephesians. 5.22.

6. Q. And are we then only to honor our superiors?

A. Nay, but also our inferiors, our equals, and our self.

7. Q. How may this appear?

A. Because they that will receive honor must deserve it by respective
yielding to every one his due, and because St. Peter bids, honor all men, 1
Pet. 2.17. and Christ extends the second Table to our neighbor, Mat. 22.39.

8. Q. What is then the honor that we are here bound to perform?

A. It is diverse according to the difference of parties to whom it is due.

9. Q. Is (Mother) here added to signify the Catholic Church?

A. No, but to quit women of contempt, 1 Pet. 3.7. and to prevent childrens
ungraciousness, who are apt to turn the Mothers indulgence to their shame, Pro.
10.1, 15, 20. and 29.15.

10. Q. What is the reason added to this Commandment?

A. That thy days may be long in the land, etc.

11. Q. What force has this reason, seeing our life is full of miseries?

A. Because life is acceptable to nature, and God is able to make it a
blessing, Ephesians. 6.2, 3.

12. Q. But does this promise always hold?

A. It holds generally, and for the most part in comparison of the wicked,
who do not live out half their days, Ps. 55.23. and if it fail, it is in
exchange for the better, Is. 57.1.

13. Q. What learn you (for practice) out of all aforesaid of the fifth
Commandment?

A. First to give to every one his due, Romans 13.7.

2. To be careful of mine own honor, that I may not fail to, and in others
honor.

3. To trust in my heavenly Fathers regarding me, whiles I have right regard of
my earthly Fathers.

2. Q. How many parts has it?

A. Two; a Negative, and an Affirmative.

3. Q. What is the Negative part?

A. That which is expressed in the words, Thou shall do no murder.

4. Q. What is the Affirmative part?

A. That which is employed, and necessarily follows on the contrary.

5. Q. Does this murder concern only man's life?

A. Yes; for the bruit creatures are given us for nourishment, Genesis 9.3.

6. Q. And does it bind only us to, and concerning other men?

A. No, but (as all the second Table does) especially to our selves.

7. Q. Is he taking away of man's life then absolutely unlawful

A. Our own self-killing must needs be so, but not the taking away of others
life, in case of judgment, just war, and self-defence.

8. Q. Is nothing here forbidden but killing, and proceeding to death?

A. Yes, even all degrees and means of wronging, or impairing our own, or our
neighbors livelihood.

9. Q. And is the bodily life here only to be understood?

A. No, but also the souls, which is much more precious.

10. Q. But how can the soul be killed?

A. Not properly, and naturally, Mat. 10.28. but spiritually by sin, Ephesians. 2.1.

11. Q. Though there be no reason here expressed, yet may there be none
rendered for the equity of this precept?

A. Yes, because we are Gods Image, Genesis 9.6. and because one with another we
are naturally one flesh, Is. 58.7. and mystically one body, 1 Cor. 12.27. Ephesians.
5.30.

12. Q. What do you learn (for practice) out of all aforesaid of the sixth
Commandment?

A. 1. To be careful to avoid all degrees of bloodguiltynesse.

2. To be ready to sustain and comfort life natural, and spiritual.

Sect. 39. Of the seventh Commandment.

4. Q. Is nothing for bidden here but Adultery?

A. Yes, also Fornication, and all acts of unchastity.

5. Q. Are only the acts of unchastity forbidden?

A. Nay, but also all sinful thoughts, Mat. 5.28. 2 Pet. 2.14. and all means,
occasions, and helps to it, 1 These. 5.22.

6. Q. What is the Affirmative part of this Commandment?

A. All that is contrary to that aforesaid, the sum whereof is, that we
possess our vessels in holiness and honor, 1 These. 4.4.

7. Q. Is not marriage here employed in the Affirmative part?

A. It is appointed for a remedy against unchastity, 1 Cor. 7.2. but not
absolutely commanded, for Christ allows single chastity, Mat. 19.12.

8. Q. Is it not as lawful for Ministers to marry as for others?

A. Yes, for Marriage is honorable among all, Heb. 13.4. and to forbid
Marriage is a doctrine of devils, 1 Timothy 4.1, 3.

9. Q. But is there no restraint of marriage to any?

A. Yes, the respect of degrees of consanguinitie, Lev. 18.6. and of
precontract, Mal. 2.15. and of parents consent, Genesis 24.49. and of the parties
own consent, Genesis 24.57.

10. Q. What reason may there be to show the equity of this Commandment?

A. Because our bodies are the Members of Christ, and Temples of the holy
Ghost, 1 Cor. 6.15, 19.

11. Q. What extraordinary reason can you show to fright men from Adultery?

A. First, because (above other sins) it has certain and grievous punishment
in this life, Prove. 6.26, 32, 33. Eccl. 19.3.

2. Because it is a self punishment of other sins, and an effect of Gods
rejecting, and giving men up to sin, Prove. 22.14. Eccl. 7.26.

12. Q. If God give up the wicked to this sin, then it follows that he
preserves godly from it, as also it appears in that Text, Eccl. 7.26. can
you then show any instance hereof?

A. Yes, Sarah (though through her own, and her husbands weakness, she ran into
great hazard of this sin) yet by God was preserved, Genesis 20.6.

13. Q. But is every one then falls into this sin absolutely rejected of God?

A. God forbid; for he may rise and recover by repentance, as ( David did) 1
Cor. 6.9, 10, 11.

14. Q. What do you chiefly observe and learn in all before said of the seventh
Commandment?

A. That (seeing not only the acts of unchastity, but also all occasions, means
and helps thereto are forbidden) I must therefore take heed of giving occasions
of it to others; and of taking occasions of it from others, and of being guilty
of the means of it in, and to my self by idleness, 2 Samuel 11.1. or by
drunkenness, Prove. 23.33.

A. 1. By idleness, Prove. 10.4. and 18.9. and 20.4.

2. By prodigalness in his own estate, Prove. 21.17. Luk 15.13.

3. By miserableness, in denying our self the comfort of our labor, Eocl.
2.24. and 3.12, 13. and 4.8.

4. By indiscreet meddling with others estates, 1 These. 4.11. Prove. 6.1.

7. Q. How may this Commandment be broken concerning our neighbor?

A. Directly, or indirectly.

8. Q. How directly?

A. 1. In things taken by force or by fraud, 1 These. 4.6.

Psalm. 37.21. Joh. 12.6. if they be wronged, or not restored.

3. In things neither taken, nor received, but wrongfully detained in whole, or
in part, whether they be things found, Lev. 6.1, 2, 3, 4. or due by promise,
Psalm. 15.4. or by any other right, Romans 13.7.

9. Q. How indirectly?

A. When we eat not our own, but others bread, by idleness, 2 These. 3.12. or
unlawful calling or practice, as Sorcery, Exodus 22.18. Act. 19.19. and 16.16.
or Usury, Deuteronomy 23.19. Ps. 15.5.

10. Q. Is there yet no other kind of thief?

A. Yes, of the heart in coveting, Mar. 7.21, 22, and of the tongue in lying
and flattering, 2 Samuel 15.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

11. Q. Are we bound by this Commandment to help and relieve our neighbor?

A. Yes, Mat. 25.42. 1 John 3.17. according to our ability, Act. 11.29. 1 Cor.
16.2.

12. Q. What reason may there be rendered for the equity of this Commandment?

A. Even that aforementioned in the sixth Commandment, viz. because naturally
we are one flesh, Is. 58.7. and mystically we are one body, 1 Cor. 12.27. and
also because we cannot live one without another help.

13. Q. What do you especially observe in all aforesaid of the eighth
Commandment?

A. 1. That (for keeping thereof) first I must shun all wilful wronging mine
own estate, Eccl. 14.5.

neighbors estate.

3. That I must not only forbear hurting, but also be ready in helping my
neighbors estate in what I may.

A. The requiring of truth.

5. Q. How may a man bear false witness against himself?

A. By simulation, in making a show of that to be which is not, as 1 Samuel
15.13. or of that which is, to be more then it is, as Mat. 6.1. Luke 18.11. Is.
58.3.

And by dissimulation in concealing that which is, whether it be in evil, Pro.
28.13. or in good, Job 27.5. Joh. 12.42.

8. Q. How out of cause, or matter of judgment?

A. Before his face, or behind his back.

9. Q. How before his face?

A. By flattering him, Prove. 29.5. or by mocking him, 2 Samuel 6 20.

10. Q. How behind his back?

A. To other men, or to our self.

11. Q. How to other men? A. By speaking, Genesis 39.14. or by writing, 1 King.
21.9. or by making signs, Pro. 6.13.

12. Q. How to our self?

A. By wrong suspicion, 1 Cor. 13.5, 7. or by harkning to slanders. Ps. 101.5.

13. Q. But is not an officious lie lawful when it is intended only to do
good?

A. No, for lying is evil in the fountain, Joh. 8.44. therefore in every
stream, Ephesians. 4.25.

14. Q. But are not the Egyptian Midwives commended and rewarded for lying in
this kind, Exodus 1.20.

A. No, but because they feared God, ver. 21.

15. Q. What say you then to the Parables, Hyperboles, and figurative speeches
common in the scriptures?

A. That in them there is truth of meaning, and of sense, though not of matter
and of words, and that (at first sight) they plainly intend not deceiving, but
informing of the reader, as in that Parable, Judge. 9.8. and that Hyperbole,
Deuteronomy. 9.1. and that Metaphor, Rev. 3.16.

16. Q. What reason may be given for the equity of this precept?

A. The same as before in the 8th Commandment: for that is also by the Apostle
applied hither, Ephesians. 4.25.

17. Q. What learn you (for practice) out of all said of the ninth
Commandment? A. 1. To be (in my self) that ^

2. Not to lie for any advantage of my self, or others; for no evil may be
done that good may come of it, Romans 3.8.

Sect. 42. Of the tenth Commandment.
1. Q. WHat is the tenth Commandment?

A. Thou shall not covet thy neighbors house, thou shall not covet thy
neighbors wife, etc.

2. Q. How many parts has it?

A. Two: a Negative, and an Affirmative.

3. Q. What is the Negative part?

A. That which is expressed, forbidding inordinate desires.

4. Q. What is the Affirmative part?

A. That which is employed, requiring purity, and integrity of thoughts,
desires, and wishes.

5. Q. How far do you extend inordinate desires?

A. Even to the first motions of concupiscence, Genesis 6.5.

6. Q. What reason and proof have you that the first motions of concupiscence
and original corruption are here forbidden?

A. 1. Because consented lust is before forbidden in the seventh and eighth
Commandments, therefore there is somewhat more in this, or else this is
superfluous tautologie.

2. Because the Decalogue shows what man should be, and requires his
original perfection, and first purity.

3. Because resisted lust is called sin, Romans 7.7.17.

7. Q. Are then all thoughts of evil here condemned?

A. Yes, all that are conceived in us, though not all that are apprehended by
us, or enforced to us, as Mat. 4.3, 6, etc. Job 2.9.

8. Q. And is lust absolutely evil in every kind?

A. No, for these be lawful kinds of lusting.

1. Spiritual against the flesh. Gal. 5.17.

2. Corporal, for meat, drink, clothing, so it be moderate in respect of
quantity, Genesis 28.20. and of quality, Numb. 11.4, 5, 6.

3. Temporal for worldly wealth, so it be by, and in course of honest labor,
or lawful trading, Ephesians. 4.28.

4. Natural, for children; so as it be in course and state of marriage, 1 Cor.
7.2. Heb. 13.4.

9. Q. Why then was Esau taxed of profaneness, Heb. 12.16. for desiring food
little in quantity, homely in quality, Genesis 25.29?

A. His desire was inordinate to the contempt of his birthright, Heb. 12.16.

10. Q. Why was Ahab punished for desiring Naboths Vineyard upon valuable
consideration, 1 King. 21

A. It was inordinately wilful in him, and against the will of the owner, 1 Timothy 6.9.

11. Q. Why was Sechems desire of Dinah in marriage condemned, Genesis 34?

A. It was inordinate, not forbearing to defile her.

12. Q. How does this Commandment differ from the first, seeing therein also
you said original corruption is forbidden?

A. It is here forbidden in such parts and points as do immediately concern
God, but here in such as do immediately concern our neighbor.

13. Q. What reasons may there be rendered for the equity of this Commandment?

A. 1. Because (as aforesaid) man is chargeable and requirable for that
original perfection which he has lost.

2. Because God is a spirit, and his Law spiritual, Romans 7.14. Heb. 4.12.

3. Because man is a spirit in his better part, and if he be not therein bound,
he is but half bound.

14. Q. What learn you (for practice) out of all aforesaid of the tenth
Commandment?

A. 1. To purge my heart as well as to cleanse my hands.

2. To take heed of using lawful desires unlawfully.

3. To hate the Romish doctrine which denies concupiscence to be fin without
consent.

Finis Catechismi.
Trino-uni gloria.
WILLIAM GAY, Rector of Buckland, his Sermon Preached the first Sabbath day
next after his settling entrance there, May 19. 1633.
Text. JOSH. 1.2. Moses myservant is dead, now therefore arise. [And ye may
add (Joshua) for to him the speech is made, and so read or understand it.]
Moses my servant is dead, now therefore arise Joshua.


HE that is Almighty, by whose power we have our being, he is also Wise,
All-good, All-gracious, and by his providence we have our well-being: Neither
was his Wisdom, Power, Goodness, Love determined and concluded in the worlds
Creation, but it is continued and extended, and still exercised in preserving,
ordering, and disposing the same even from the Stars unto the Sparrows, from
the greatest to the smallest creatures: From the Stars; for he tells the
number of the Stars, and calls them all by their names, Psalm. 107.4. To the
Sparrows; Are not two Sparrows sold for a farthing, and one of them shall not
light on the ground without your Father, Mat. 10.29. How much more then (at
least in our own eye; for with God there is not magis and minus, his
infiniteness admits no degrees of comparison) how much more, I say, is his
providence exercised concerning that World of Worlds (his Church) wherein every
Member is a little World renewed, or made new? And how much (most of all)
toward those who are the Stars of that World, I mean the Ministers who are
ordained to shine not only in glory hereafter ( They that turn many unto
righteousness, shall shine as the Stars for ever and ever. Dan. 12.3.) but also
in grace here; for they are the light of the World. Mat. 1.14. Yea Stars
already; The seven Stars are the Angels of the seven Churches, Rev. 1.20.

This that I have said is plainly expressed in this Text now read, wherein is
showed Gods great care and love toward his Church in fitting them with
Ministers ( Moses and Joshua) to guide and lead them. I call them Ministers;
for though they were not properly Priests in Sacrificing, yet they were
Ministers in teaching; they were Ministerial Magistrates, Teachers as well as
Governors. Gods providence toward them (and theirs in them) appears in two
parts of the Text, viz. In his approbation of the one deceased ( Moses my
servant is dead) and in the ordination of the other to succeed ( Now therefore
arise Joshua.)

His approbation of Moses is, in taking, and giving notice of his life, that he
was his servant; and of his death, that he was dead.

1. He takes notice of his life; for he calls him his servant. Note here,
God is watchful over men, and specially over special men.

1. He is watchful over men, even generally over all; for he can neither
slumber nor sleep, Psalm. 121.4.

It was a mockage of the false God, It may be he sleeps, 1 King. 18.27. But
the eyes of the Lord in every place behold the evil and the good, Prove. 15.3.
Yea, and that not only for actions, but for words and thoughts; Thou art about
my path, and about my bed, and spiest out all my ways; for lo there is not a
word in my tongue, but thou, O Lord, know it altogether, Psalm. 139.3, 4.

This teaches us to beware of hiding both before hand, and after hand.

Before hand, in respect of practice; Woe unto them that seek deep to hide their
counsels from the Lord, Is. 29.15. And so do all that practice evil: For every
one that evil does, hates the light, Joh. 3.20. But in vain, for the darkness
is no darkness with him, but the night is as clear as the day; the darkness and
light (to thee) are both alike, Psalm. 139.11. He that planteth the ear, shall
not he hear? or he that made the eye, shall not he see? Yes, all things are
naked and open to his eyes, Heb. 4.13. Walk with God then as in his presence,
since out of his presence thou can not go. And after hand likewise beware of
hiding, and not confessing: For have thou been shameless and fearless in doing,
and will thou be ashamed and afraid to confess what thou have done? Do thou
not see it is one wrong to God to transgress his will, and another to think
thou can deceive him by hiding it? Forget not thy self then so much at any
time as to practice the works of darkness, as if God did not see thee, but if
thou have so forgotten, O remember at last thou wast mistaken, and freely open
what thou can not hide: For he that hides his sin shall not prosper, but who
so confesses and forsakes them shall have mercy, Prove. 28.13.

2. But God is especially watchful over special men, generally his Elect; The
eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open to their
prayers, Ps. 34.14. And specially to the special ones, the heads and
principals; and that in his Donation, Protection, Offense, Acceptance.

1. In his Donation, to whom he gives greater place, to them he gives greater
grace, that he may prepare them to greater glory. Solomon having a great
government had a great gift of wisdom, 1 King. 3. I say must have his lips
touched with an hot coal from the Altar, Is. 6.6. Moses has a word of warrant;
I will be with thy mouth, and will teach thee what thou shall say, Exed. 3.12.
And the Disciples; I will give you a mouth and wisdom, where against all your
adversaries shall not be able to speak, or to resist, Luke 21.15.

My use of this shall be to my self: I trust God will make this good in me;
that with my greater place I shall receive greater grace, gift of Ability as
well as of Employment: and the Lord grant it, not for mine, but for his own
honor and glory in the good of you whom he has given me.

2 In his Protection; Touch not mine Anointed, and do my Prophets no harm,
Ps. 105.15. The Disciples are warranted, there shall not one hair of your head
perish, Luke 21.18.

Beware then of opposing Gods Ordinance, and offer no despite nor despising to
the Magistrate, or to the Minister, think not to prevail by stubborness; for ye
shall therein but imagine a vain thing, Ps. 2.1. Why do the heathen rage, and
the people imagine a vain thing? Yea ve shall be found but fighters against
God, Act. 5.39. He that resists the power resists the Ordinance of God, and
they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation, Romans 13.2.

3. In Offense: For they are the apple of his eye, Zach. 2.8. He that touches
you touches the apple of his eye, Ps. 17.8. Keep me as the apple of the eye;
their blemishes as well as their touches are his great offense; see it in his
reckoning with David, 2 Samuel 12.7. and with his people, Mic. 6.3.

Beware then of playing the wanton with God, turn not his grace into
wantonness, let not his favor imbolden thee to sin; for the more his kindness
is unto thee, the more unkindly he takes thy sin. Therefore grieve not the good
Spirit of God; for the more he loves thee, the more offense he takes at thy
lack of love to him.

4. In Acceptance: For though the Lord is generally gracious, and merciful,
loving unto every man, nigh unto all men that call upon him, Ps. 145. Yet some
men's calling upon him is of special acceptance with him; yea not only for
themselves, but also for others, insomuch that some are commanded to make use
rather of their, then of their own calling; Abraham must pray for Abimelech,
Genesis 20.7. and Job for his friends, Job 42.8. Yea God has ordained, and set an
order and function of men to be petitioners for others (even the Ministry) with
promise of special acceptance, Jam. 5.14.15. And while Moses held up his bands
Israel prevailed, but when he let down his hands Amaleck prevailed, Exodus 17.11.

Learn therefore to love them whom God so accepts: Now we beseech you
brethren to know them which labor among you, and are over you in the Lord, and
admonish you, and to esteem them very highly in love for their works sake, 1
These. 5.12, 13. For if you love them for their work sake, then ye will love
them for their own sake, because they are workers, and for Gods sake, because
they are his workers; and for your own sakes, because the benefit of their work
extends to you temporally, spiritually, eternally: For bodily exercise
profits little, but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise
of the life that now is, and of that which is to come, 1 Timothy 4.8. Yea love
them for their presence and companies sake; for much is the benefit that
secretly you may receive thereby; God blessed Laban for Jacobs sake, Genesis
30.27. and Potiphar for Joseph's sake, Genesis 40.5. yea he gave Saint Paul the
lives of all his fellow passengers in that desperate danger of shipwreck, Act.
27.24. And if ten righteous could have been found in Sodom, all the multitude
of miscreants, even all the whole city should have been spared for their
sakes, Genesis 18.32. And what know thou whether the company and acquaintance,
the society, and near neighborhood of one of Gods favorites may be unto thee,
and all thine, both a prospering in good, and a defense from evil.

But what is the notice that God gives, and thereby shows that he took of Moses
life? Even this, That he was his servant.

Behold then, God is no ungrateful Master, no man can serve him for naught: He
observes as diligently thy obedience to approve and reward it, as thy
disobedience to reprove and punish it; yea though it be in secret he will
reward thee openly, Mat. 6.4. yea though it be but little and of small value
that thou do; for a cup of cold water shall not lose its reward, Mat. 10.28.
The Widows Mite is not disdained but extolled, Luke 21.1. Yea he keeps a book
to register every word, and a bottle to preserve every tear that true
repentance shall bring forth: Put my tears into thy bottle; are not these
things noted in thy book? Psalm. 56.8.

O then be not weary of well doing; for in due time ye shall reap if ye faint
not, Gal. 6.9. And say not, it is in vain to serve God, and what profit is it
that we have kept his Commandments: and walked humbly before the Lord? Mal.
3.14. But be ye steadfast and unmovable, always rich in the work of the Lord,
for as much as ye know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord, 1 Cor.
15.58.

But does God give no other notice of Moses then that he was his servant? No,
this was the height of his honor; for the Law afforded but Servantship, it is
the Gospel that brings Sonship, the time of Sonship was not yet come.

For even that Heir (the Church of Israel) differed nothing from a servant,
though he were Lord of all, but was under Tutors and Governors; yea in a kind
of bondage under weak and beggarly rudiments, Gal. 4. But when the Son became a
Servant, then servants became sens: He made himself of no reputation, but took
upon him the form of a servant, Phil. 2.7. From thence forth that was fulfilled
to us, Thou art no more a servant but a son. Now if thou be a son, thou art
also the heir of God through Jesus Christ, Gal. 4.7.

Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ has made us free, and be
not entangled again with with the yoke of bondage, Gal. 5.1. The yoke of
bondage of the Ceremonial and of the Moral Law.

Of the Ceremonial Law, as touch not, taste not, handle not, which were shaddows
of things to come, but the body is in Christ, Col. 2.21.

Of the Moral Law: For even that also may prove an entangling yoke of bondage:
Namely, if we stick to the Covenant of Works, and presume on our own meriting.
Beware then (with the Dog in the Fable) ye lose not the substance by catching
at the shadow: That ye go not about to establish your own righteousness; not
submitting your selves to the righteousness of God; for Christ is the end of
the Law for righteousness, Romans 10.3. in him we must seek it, or else we shall
never find it.

It may prove also a yoke of bondage, if we stick to the covenant of it the
contrary way, namely by dispairing, yielding to the force, and sinking under
the burden of the curse of it, taking no hold on that Anchor of hope which we
have in Christ, Heb. 6.19. For Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the
Law being made a curse for us, Gal. 3.13.

In all these respects therefore stand fast in the liberty wherewith Christ
has made us free: for the son having made us free now are we free indeed,
Joh. 8.36. even of servants we are made sons.

But how? are we made lawless sons, and has the Law indeed no more power over
us? Not so; the curse of it is taken away, not the force of it, the killing
letter is blotted out, not the binding Letter: We are freed in respect of
vengeance from God, not in respect of obedience to God, so that still we must
do all that ever we can, but when all is done, we must say, we are
unprofitable servants, we have done that which was our duty to do, Luke 17.10.
As free, and yet not as having your liberty for a cloak of malitiovsness, but
as the servants of God, 1 Pet. 2.16. For brethren you have been called unto
liberty, only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve
one another, Gal. 5.13. For how much more privilege God affords us, so much
more duty we should afford him, acknowledging his service to be perfect freedom.

And so much of Gods notice taken and given of Moses in his life.

Of his death also he takes and gives notice, Moses my servant is dead, showing
that even Gods servants also must dye, from that none can be privileged: By
Adams sin death went over all men, Romans 5.12. It is appointed to all men once
to die, Heb. 9.37. Yea though Christ has taken away his Fathers wrath in the
curse of death, yet he has not taken away his Fathers word concerning the
course of death: he has turned the curse of death into a blessing, because he
is merciful: He will not always be chiding, neither keeps he his anger for
ever; Psalm. 103.9. but he has not stopped the course of death to stay it from
proceeding, because he is just and true: Heaven and earth shall pass away, but
his word shall not pass, Mat. 24.35. All must dye.

Let every man therefore, from the meanest to the greatest, from the worst to
the best watch and wait, yea provide and prepare for death as unavoydable: thy
poorness cannot hide thee, thy greatness cannot protect thee, thy holiness
cannot privilege thee: Moses Gods servant dyed, and so must thou.

Again this shows, that God takes notice of the death as well as of the life
of his servants, and that they who live to him cannot dye from, or without him:
Right dear in the sight of the Lord is the death of his Saints, Ps. 165.15. he
dearly regards it, he does not slightly neglect it: Lazarus was carried by
the Angels into Abraham's bosom, as Christ testifies Luke 16.22. and Moses his
dead body was protected and defended against the Devil by an Angel, yea by
Michael the Archangel, as St. Jude testifies, Jude 9.

Behold then your happiness all ye that serve God: for when, or where, or
howsoever death shall find you, God does not then lose you, your soul and body
shall be parted, but neither of them parted from God; the one goes to joy ( the
soul flees to God that gave it, Eccl. 12.7.) the other to rest: Blessed are
they that die in the Lord, they rest from their labors, Rev. 14.13. by
whatsoever casualty or cruelty therefore thine own, or thy friends death
comes, grieve not, lament not, despair not, fear not; for not only the
souls of the righteous are in the hand of the Lord, Wisd. 3.1. but their whole
persons; All Saints are in thy hand, Deuteronomy. 33.3. Tyrants cannot kill the soul
at all, nor yet the body without Gods observance, nor yet destroy it past his
preservance, but every faithful one in every kind of death may comfortably
yield himself unto God as unto a faithful Creator, 1 Pet. 4.19. with David's
assurance of safety, Psalm. 4.8. I will lay me down in peace, and take my rest,
for thou Lord only make me dwell in safety. And thus much for the first part
of my Text, Gods approbation of Moses.

Now for the latter part; his ordination of Joshua; Now therefore arise. Ye may
understand Joshua's name; for it is to him spoken.

Note that God calls Joshua, and whereto he calls him.

1. That he calls him, and that Joshua stirs not without bidding: For
Great places must have great and strong calling: Moses was afraid to undertake
his charge, yea even contended with God by urging his disability, Exodus 4.
Jeremiah cries out, Behold I cannot speak, for I am but a child, Jer. 1.6. And
of the Priesthood it is said, No man takes this honor to himself, but he that
is called of God as was Aaron, Heb. 5.4. Yea who is sufficient for these
things? 2 Cor. 2.16.

Woe be then to the corruption of our times in rising to places: Do they come
without calling? No, for they call themselves; I have not sent these Prophets,
says the Lord, yet they ran, Jer. 23.21. But let unlookt for Guests beware of
that unlookt for question, Friend, how came thou in hither? Mat. 22.12. Do
they rise without bidding? No, but it is in a contrary kind to that which
should be; for instead of Gods bidding them by the motions, and bidding for
them by the gifts of his spirit, they bid for themselves by gifts and sums as
the place is worth in a wordly eye: But woe be both to the receivers and givers
of such biddings. To the receivers; for what difference is there between
Balaams going, and their setting others to go for reward? Or what difference
between Judas his betraying Christ, and their betraying the Church the body of
Christ for money? May not all such taking be justly called the wages of
iniquity? To the givers: for God has ordained that spiritual things shall
buy temporal: If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing
if we reap your carnal things, 1 Cor. 9.11. Not that temporal shall buy
spiritual; they that offer that, are in the gall of bitterness, and in the
bond of iniquity, Act. 8.23. They may boldly say to their people, Dearly
beloved brethren; for their charge cost them dear; it was a dear bargain, dear
to their purses, dearer to their consciences, but dearest of all (without
repentance) to their souls: That is the right golden hook they fish withal.
And yet indeed they speak falsely in calling the people Dearly beloved; for it
is not the people but the profit that they love: They cannot say with Saint
Paul, I seek not yours but you, 2 Cor. 12.14. But contrariwise, I seek not you,
but yours.

So much of Joshua's being called.

Now whereto he is called, Arise: This implies Honor and Labor.

1. Honor: For

Great places yield honor to the possessors: Joshua was (at first) Moses's
Minister or servant, now he be the peoples head or governor; Therefore he
must arise, that is, take greater degree of honor. Hereto agrees that speech
of lifting up, He lifts up the beggar from the dunghill to set him among
Princes; 1 Samuel 2.8. Thou art the lifter up of my head, Psalm. 3.3. and this is
confirmed by that 1 Pet. 2.17. Honor the King; and by the Commandment, Honor
thy Father and Mother. Let Superiors honor then be maintained by themselves,
and by others: By themselves; the higher they are raised, the more they are in
the peoples sight, the more care they need to take of themselves, they are the
light of the world, and as a City set upon a hill that cannot be hid, Mat.
5.14.

By others: For we must give every man his due, custom to whom custom, fear
to whom fear, honor to whom ye owe honor, Romans 13.7. For God is not the
author of confusion, 1 Cor. 14.33. But he will have every man known and
acknowledged in his degree to the fulfilling whereof he requires a kind of
strife and contention who shall do most: In giving honor prevent or go before
one another, Romans 12.10.

2. Labor: For

Great places require great labors: To arise, argues no sleepy idleness, but
painful practice; honos and onus cannot be divided; every honor has its
burden: the words sound alike, and there is not much odds in the letters, nor
in the number of them, but one which is an aspiration, the peoples breath: his
rising here is not as Exodus 32.6. The people sat down to eat and drink and
rose up to play. It is no play game, but a matter of laborious consequence; he
must arise and go over Jordan. It was labor in leading, more in ruling, most
in fighting, It is said of Christ, Is. 9.6. The government is upon his
shoulders: and Exodus 28.12. Aaron likewise must bear the names of the twelve
Tribes upon his two shoulders. And it is generally true, that Government is a
shoulder work, a burden requiring strength and industry.

Let every one therefore, from the highest to the lowest, that has had any
rising above others, look to his labor and charge therein: for even the
meanest Master or Father that is risen to be over a Family, is therein risen to
labor: He has others to answer for as well as for himself: Duxit uxorem,
altera cura; nati liberi, altera cura: If he have married a Wife, he has
another charge: if he have children, he has another charge, the greater his
charge, the greater his place is, the greater is his labor, and therefore the
greater should be his care: for he may be sure his account will be greater,
and his reward will be greater if he account well, and his punishment greater
if ill: For to whomsoever much is given, of him much shall be required, Luke
12.48.

And now I conclude with Application.

This Text fits well with this time and place, at least in the forepart of it,
Moses my servant is dead.

That my Predecessor lately dead was a Moses, and Gods servant, it is needless
for me to tell you, that can tell so well, and do tell me so much: even such a
memory of him, as that a better cannot be wished: so that I fear to speak much
of him, lest my much should be too little, lest I should fail in speaking so
much good of him as others do. I will say all then in that which may serve as
an Epitaph to set upon his grave, even that Eze. 2.10. (as the vulgar Latin
reads it, and as I may construe it to my purpose) Lamentationes, carmen, and
vae. To his death belongs lamentation, and song, and woe: Lamentation to you,
and to all his friends from whom he is parted: a song to him, who having
finished his course, has received (no doubt) the end of his faith, the
salvation of his soul, and is gone into that place of heavenly singing
Halle-laiahs, songs of praise to God with the Quire of Angels: But woe to his
Successor, for as much as his Worth was so great, and his Memory is so good,
that there is little hope left to another to match so much desert, or to find
such an acceptance.

And in the other part also the Text is not unfit: For though I arrogate not to
my self the name and worth of Joshua, yet now I must profess my self to be
your Joshua, your Leader into the heavenly Canaan, your Guide and Captain in
your spiritual Warfare. I profess also to have had like calling with him
hereunto, even to arise.

I profess like calling, though not by an audible voice from heaven (which now
we must not expect, Miracles being ceased) yet by a fair and free calling as
ever was any: For never did any (that asked at all, make less suit or asking
then I have done for this: And if offers, gifts, services, friendship, kindred,
could have prevailed, I could not have sped: So that you must take me as at
the Lords sending what ever I am, and I must say, It is the Lords doing, and it
is mavelous in my eyes. I profess also my calling to be to arise, as in
honor, so in labor: Which profession that I may fulfill and practice, I
desire you every one from the oldest to the youngest, as many as can pray to
help me by your prayers, not only weekly here in public, but daily at home
in private: For if you lack wisdom, you must ask it of God not of me: for it
descends from above, Jam. 1. And if ye think it not worth the asking, ye
make your selves unworthy of receiving: Ask therefore, and you shall receive,
that your joy may be full, Joh. 16.24. Which the Lord grant, etc.

Finis.
Maii 19. 1633. Trino-uni gloria. Per me Gulielmum Gaium.

A SERMON preached at Longleat at the Baptism of the late hopeful Spark (too
bright for this World)
Mr. THEOPHILUS THYNNE.
Text, 1 PET. 3.18. For Christ also has once suffered for sins.


THis Text does give me occasion to tell you a doleful tale, very strange, yet
not more strange then true: very like in some respects, and yet also in some
other respects very unlike to that Tragical story of the death of Absalom,
recorded 2 Samuel 18.

1 In some respects it is like it: For Absalom (there spoken of) was the son of
David, a great and mighty King; and Christ of whom I am to speak, was the Son
of God, the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.

2. Absalom was the beloved son of his Father, else he would never have made so
great lamentation for him as he did, crying, O my son Absalom, my son, my son
Absalom: and Christ was the beloved son of his Father, else he would never
have given so great commendation of him as he did, saying, This is my beloved
son in whom I am well pleased.

3. Absalom was excellent in corporal beauty, from the sole of his foot to the
crown of the head there was no blemish in him; and Christ was absolute in
spiritual beauty, there was no spot or stain of sin to be found upon him.

4. Absalom died hanging up in the air on the bough of a tree, and Christ dyed
lifted up between heaven and earth upon the cross.

5. Absalom was thrust through with darts, and Christ's side was pierced with a
spear.

6. Absalom being dead was taken down, and cast into a pit, and a great heap of
stones laid upon him; and Christ being dead was taken down, and laid in a
sepulcher, and a great stone rolled against him.

7. Concerning Absalom there was one soldier that answered Captain Ioab,
Though I should receive a thousand sheekels of silver, yet would I not lay my
hand upon the Kings Son: and concerning Christ, there was one woman that sent
unto Lieutenant Pilate, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man.

8. When Absalom was slain, his Father withdrew himself from the cruel
Captains, and showed them no grace nor favor but displeasure; and when Christ
was slain, his Father withdrew himself from the murdering Jews, and to this
day they have his wrathful indignation according to their own imprecation, His
blood be upon us and upon our children.

But to make this Tragedy of Christ more pitiful and lamentable then that of
Absalom, behold also here great difference and dissimilitude.

1. Absaloms Father had many more children, but Christ was the only begotten
son of his Father.

2. Absalom was a rebellious and disobedient son, and wilfully ran upon his
own death, contrary to his Fathers good will: but Christ was so loyal and
obedient a Son, that he would not so much as avoid death without his Fathers
good will; for so he spoke, Not my will, but thine be done.

3. Absalom did not only himself flee from his Father and rebel, but he drew
others away with him: but Christ did both yield himself unto his Father,
saying, Into thy hands I commend my spirit; and with himself he drew others
also, saying to the Thief upon the Cross, This day shall thou be with me in
Paradise.

4. Absalom dyed unwillingly notwithstanding he suffered no punishment but his
own deservedly due unto him: but Christ dyed willingly, notwithstanding the
punishments due unto all the world, were undeservedly laid upon him.

5. The hair of Absaloms head fastened in the bough of a tree was strong enough
to bear the weight of him: It is probable that his great bush of hair hung in a
bough, 2 Samuel 14.26.
but Christ was laden with so insupportable a burden, that his hands and his
feet nailed to the body of the Cross were little enough to hold him.

6. Absalom hanging by his hair felt pain and torment no where but in his head,
till Ioab came with his darts to dispatch him: but Christ both before he was
crucified, and while he was crucified, was tormented and tortured in all his
body.

7. It was but an Oaken bough wherein Absaloms head was entangled; but it was a
sharp thorny bush wherewith Christ's head was wreathed.

8. In a word; Absaloms story was a right Tragedy; for it began merrily; he
invited his brethren to a Feast, but it ended mournfully, he and his followers
were put to the sword; but Christ's story was more, and worse then tragical;
for his birth, his life, his death, began, continued, ended with no mirth at
all, but with continual mournful misery.

But that I may proceed orderly in this my discourse, I propose these three
chief parts or points of the Text to be observed.

1. The sufferer (Christ.)

2. His sufferings (has suffered.)

3. The cause of his sufferings (for sins.)

Concerning the sufferer we are to consider who he was, and what he was, who
in his person, what in his office.

The former the Prophet plainly shows, Is. 9.6. Unto us a child is born, and
unto us a Son is given. Parvulus a Child, that notes his humanity: Filius a
Son, that notes his Deity: Parvulus a Child, even man of the substance of
his Mother born in the World: Filius a Son, even God of the substance of his
Father begotten before the World. Parvulus a Child, behold his humility; She
brought forth her first born Son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid
him in a manger, Luke 2.7. Filius a Son, behold his dignity: When he brings
in his first begotten Son into the world, he says, and let all the Angels of
God worship him, Heb. 1.6. That he was man there is proof: It is enough to the
purpose to say (seeing it is a saying undeniable) he was born, he lived, he
dyed. That he was God, there is proof; St. Peter says, They killed the Prince
of life, Act. 3.15. and St. Paul says, they crucified the Lord of glory, 1
Cor. 2.8. Yea, that God has purchased his Church with his own blood, Act 20.28.

That he should be man there was reason: For man had sinned, therefore man must
be punished: By a man came death, therefore by a man must come the resurrection
of the dead: Man was the offender, therefore man must be the satisfier. Angels
could not do it, they had no bodies to suffer; the bruit sensible creatures
could not do it, they had no souls to suffer: The insensible creatures could
not do it, they had no sense to suffer; therefore man having body, soul, and
sense must do it; for he had sinned in all, and he could suffer in all.

That he should be God, there was reason, yea double reason: First, that his
sufferings might be sufficient; and again, that his merits might be
sufficient.

That his sufferings might be sufficient: For the sin of man was infinite (I
mean infinitely punishable) If not infinite in number (infinite offenses) yet
infinite in nature, every offense infinite, because against God, who is
infinite. No creature could therefore satisfy for it, but the sufferer must be
God, that so his infiniteness might be answerable to the infiniteness of man's,
yea all men's offenses.

And again, that his merits might be sufficient, he must be God: for
sufficient merit for all Mankind could not be in the person of any mere man;
no not in Christ himself considered only as a man: For so all the grace he had,
he did receive it, and all the good he did, he was bound to do it: for he was
made of a woman and made under the Law, Gal. 4.4. therefore in fulfilling it
he did more then that which was his duty to do: he could not merit by it, no
not for himself, much less for others (considered only as man) therefore he
must also be God, that the dignity of his person might add dignity, and
virtue, and value to his works. In a word, Deus potuit, sed non debuit; homo
debuit, sed non potuit; God could, but he should not; man should, but he could
not make the satisfaction; therefore he that would do it must be both God and
Man: Terris crutus ab igne (as the Prophet speak h Zac. 3.2.) Is not this a
firebrand taken out of the fire? In a firebrand there is fire and wood
inseparably mixed, and in Christ there is God and Man wonderfully united. He
was God, else neither his sufferings nor his merits could have been sufficient:
And if his could not, much less any man's else: for all other men are both
conceived and born in original sin, and also much and often defiled with
actual sin.

Away then with all such doctrines of prayers and Masses for the dead, and
whatsoever other merit or satisfaction of man: for no man may deliver his
brother, nor make agreement to God for him; for it cost more to redeem their
souls, so that he must let that alone for ever, Ps. 49.7.

He was man; even God became man by a wonderful, unspeakable, and
unconceivable union. Behold God is offended by man's affecting and coveting his
wisdom and his glory (for that was the Devils temptation to our first Parents,
ye shall be as Gods) and man is redeemed by Gods assuming and taking his
frailty, and his infirmity: Man would be as God, and so offended him, therefore
God becomes man, and so redeemeth him.

Away then with all pride and disdain, scorn and contempt of our brethren:
despise not, hate not, revenge not him that compares himself unto thee, or
lifts himself above thee, pursue him not with fury, prosecute him not with
rage, but rather seek to reconcile and win him with kindness, meekness, and
humility: so did God deal with man his proud daring, and too too high comparing
creature: Because man in pride would be a God, therefore God in love became a
man.

And so you have one particular concerning the sufferer, namely, who he was in
his person, God and Man.

Again (as aforesaid) we are to consider what he was in his office; the Text
does yield it in the name Christ. This name or title Christus was wont to be
given to three sorts of dignities or degrees: Namely, to Kings, Priests, and
Prophets, and that because the signification of that name (that is, Anointed)
did belong to them: for those three degrees were wont to be consecrated and
confirmed with the ceremony of Anointing; so was Aaron Anointed to be a Priest,
Jehu to be a King, Elisha to be a Prophet: And of them all the Psalmists words
may be understood, Psalm. 105.15. Nolite tangere Christos meos, Touch not mine
Anointed. But never was this name so properly given to any as to him of whom my
Text speaks: For if any were Anointed with material oil, he was Anointed
with spiritual oil (the oil of gladness) if any were Anointed abundantly, he
was Anointed superabundantly (above his fellows) if any were Anointed
temporally, he was Anointed eternally, Thou art a Priest for ever, says the
Psalmist: Whose Kingdom shall have no end, says the Nicen Creed: If any were
Anointed for any of those three dignities or degrees, it was for one of them,
or but for two at the most: Samuel was a Priest and a Prophet, Melchizedek was
a Priest extraordinary, though not of any kindred known, Genesis 14.18. Heb. 7.1.
etc. Et Aug. quaest. 46. ex vet. Test. Denying Samuel to be a Priest,
confesses him a Levite. Et de civ. dei lib. 17. c. 4. says, Samuel officio
functus Sacerdotis and Iudicis.
Melchizedek, a Priest and a King; David a King and a Prophet: only Christ was
all three together, a King, a Priest, and a Prophet: That he was a King there
is proof, Rejoice O daughter of Jerusalem, behold thy King comes, Zac. 9.9.
which words are applied to Christ, Mat. 21.4. That he was a Priest there is
proof, Thou art a Priest for ever after the order of Melchisedek, Ps. 110.4.
which words are applied unto Christ, Heb. 7.17. That he was a Prophet there is
proof, The Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet, Deuteronomy. 18.15. which
words are applied unto Christ, Act. 3.22.

That he should be a King there was reason, his people are obnoxious to much
weakness, many dangers, mighty enemies, who else could be able to protect and
guard them? he must be their defender. That he should be a Priest there was
reason, his blood was precious ( the blood of Christ, says St. Peter) who else
could be worthy to have the offering of that sacrifice? he himself must be the
sacrificer. That he should be a Prophet there was reason, his mysteries are
unsearchable ( the unsearchable riches of Christ, Ephesians. 3.8.) who else could be
able to teach and instruct, to direct and inform his Church? (...), Who is
sufficient for these things? he must be their Doctor. See how well the name
Christian (in some good measure) may also agree with thee that do profess
it.

Be thou a King to subdue and conquer thy corruptions, and to reign and rule
over thine inordinate affections, lusts, and passions: And think not this a
base Kingship, or mean rule; for he that rules his own mind, is better then
he that wins a City, Prove. 16.32.

Be thou a Priest to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus
Christ: The Calves of thy lips (as the Prophet Hosea speaks, Hos. 14.3. The
sacrifices of praise (as the Apostle expresses it, Hebr. 13.15.) even prayers,
and praises, and thanksgivings.

Be thou a Prophet to exhort and encourage to virtue and goodness, to dehort
and discourage from sin and wickedness; Let the word of Christ dwell in you
plenteously in you in all wisdom, teaching, and admonishing one another in
Psalms, and Hymns, and spiritual songs, Col. 3.16. Let us consider one another
to provoke unto love and good works, and let us exhort one another, Heb. 10.24.
Otherwise if instead of reigning and ruling over thy corruptions thou suffer
them to reign and rule over thee, making thy will thy Law, and following thine
own hearts lusts even with greediness. If in stead of offering holy acceptable
sacrifices to God by Jesus Christ, thou offer the uncleanness of thy heart,
the profaneness of thy mouth, the wickedness of thy hands: If in stead of
abetting virtue, and abating vice, thou back vice, and beat down virtue, then
(whosoever thou art) thou do but usurp the name of Christian, and in the
mean time provest thy self to be Antichristian, because thy practice is
contrary to Christ's profession.

And so much for the first general part or branch of the Text, the sufferer
Christ, both what he was in his person (God and Man) and what he was in his
office, Christ, the Anointed King, Priest and Prophet of his Church.

The second general part or branch is, his sufferings (has suffered.)

The Apostles words here do seem to me like to a Riddle, Christ has suffered;
as if he should say; a-read thou if thou can what he suffered: And why Saint
Peter? thou that did follow him farther then others, can not thou tell us?
or thou that did love him more then others, wilt not thou tell us what he
suffered? Surely I doubt not, thou can tell his sufferings, but they are so
many, that in this thy short Epistle thou will not: It may be also thou
would tell his sufferings, but they are so grievous, that in thy passionate
love thou can not; therefore thou do content thy self thus abruptly to
deliver them in this unperfect broken speech, Christ has suffered: And how
then, alas, how then shall I, Infandum renovare dolorem, renew this
unspeakable grief, or utter this unutterable sorrow? Or (if I could do it)
Quis duri miles Ulissi temperet a lacrymis? What hard hearted Son of hard
heartning Satan could refrain tears, or abstain from weeping? What woes and
lamentations, what cries and exclamations, what complaints and sorrows, what
wringing of hands, what knocking of breasts, what weeping of eyes, what wayling
of tongues belong to the speaking and hearing of this doleful Tragedy?
Horresco referens and vox faucibus haeret, Even in the prologue I tremble, and
at the first entrance I am as at a non plus, that I know not with what woeful
gesture to act it, with what moanfull voice to pronounce it, with what
mournful words, with what patheticall speeches, with what emphaticall phrases,
with what interrupted accents, with what passionate compassionate plaints to
express it. The multiplicitie of the plot, and the variety of the acts and
scenes is so intricate, that my memory fails to comprise it; the matter so
important, and the story so excellent, that my tongue fails to declare it: the
cruelty so savage, and the massacre so barbarous, that my heart fails to
confider it, wherefore I must needs content my self (with the Apostle here) to
speak but unperfectly of it, and think this enough to say, Christ has suffered.

And well may I think this enough; for behold what perfection there is in this
seeming unperfect speech: For to say indefinitely he suffered, without any
limitation of time, what is it but to say that he always suffered without
exception of time? And so indeed the Prophet speaks of him, namely, that he was
a man full of sorrows, Is. 53.3. Full of sorrows as if no part of his life were
free from suffering. Again, to say only, he suffered, and nothing else, what is
it but to say, that he always only suffered, never resisted, never rebelled?
And so also of him it is said, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter, and as a
lamb dumb before the shearer so opened he not his mouth, Act. 8.32. And when he
was reviled, he reviled not again, when he suffered he threatened not 1 Pet.
2.23. And again, to say precisely, he suffered, what is it but to say, that he
was a right and proper sufferer? namely, that he suffered not constrainedly
what he could not choose (which is not suffering, but compulsion) but
voluntarily what he might refuse (which properly is to be termed suffering)
that he suffered himself to suffer, and suffered the Jews to make him suffer,
having power to quit himself if he would and not to suffer? Indeed such a
true, and proper sufferer he was; for so himself confesses, I lay down my
life, no man takes it from me, but I lay it down of my self, I have power to
lay it down, and I have power to take it again, Joh. 10.17. And again, to say
plainly he suffered, what is it but to show his innocence, that he had not
offended? For if he had been a malefactor or offender, it should have been
said rather, he was punished, or he was executed. And so it is most true, for
so it follows in the next words of the Text, the just for the unjust. And
again, to say peremptorily he suffered, what is it but to set him forth by the
way of excellency for the chief and archsufferer? and that not only in respect
of the manner of his sufferings that he suffered, absolutely so as never did
any, but also in respect of the measure of his sufferings, that he suffered
excessively so much as never did any: And so also we may well understand and
take it: For to him does well belong that lamentation of the Prophet, Lam.
1.12. O vos omnes qui transitis, attendite, and videte, si dolor est ullus
sicut dolor meus: O all ye that pass by, attend and see if there be any
sorrow like to mine.

Behold then, in saying nothing else but Christ has suffered.

1. He implies that he always suffered, constantly without intermission.

2. That he only suffered, patiently without opposition.

3. That he properly suffered, voluntarily without compulsion.

4. That he innocently suffered, wrongfully without just condemnation.

5. That he principally suffered, excessively without comparison.

And is it not enough then that he says, Christ has suffered, but will ye yet
ask what? Nay, but I pray you be satisfied, and rather of the two ask what not?
For what sufferings can ye think on which he suffered not? Sufferings in birth?
he suffered them: Sufferings in life? he suffered them: Sufferings in death? he
suffered them: Sufferings in body? he was diversely tormented: Sufferings in
soul? his soul was heavy unto death: Sufferings in estate? he had not where to
rest his head: Sufferings in good name? he was counted a Samaritane, and a
devilish Sorcerer: Sufferings from heaven? he cries out, My God, my God, why
have thou for saken me? Sufferings from the earth? he finds for his hunger a
fruitless Fig Tree: Sufferings from hell? he is assaulted and encountered with
the Devil himself: He began his life meanly and basely, and was sharply
persecuted: he continued his life poorly, and distressedly, and was cruelly
hated: he ended his life woefully and miserably, and was most grievously
tormented, with whips, thorns, nails, and (above all) with the terrors of his
Fathers wrath, and horrors of hellish agonies.

Ego sum qui peccavi: I am the man that have sinned, but these sheep what have
they done? So spoke David when he saw the Angel destroying his people, 2 Samuel
24.17. And even the same speech may every one of us take up for our self, and
apply to Christ, and say, I have sinned, I have done wickedly, but this sheep
what has he done? Yea much more cause have we then David had to take up this
complaint: For David saw them die whom he knew to be sinners; we see him dye
who (we know) knew no sin. David saw them dye a quick speedy death, we see him
die with lingering torments. David saw them dye who (by their own confession)
was worth ten thousand of them: we see him dye for us, whose worth admits
no comparison. David saw the Lord of glory destroying mortal men, we see
mortal men crucifying the Lord of glory, 1 Cor. 2.8. How then have not we
more cause then David to say, I have sinned, I have done wickedly, but this
innocent lamb what has he deserved to be thus tormented? But let us not go on
with David's words to add (as he does there) Let thy hand I pray thee be
against me, and against my Fathers house. Let us not desperately offer our
selves to condemnation, when we see redemption fairly, freely, fully offered
unto us; rather let us sing Mary's Magnificat; My soul does magnify the Lord,
and my spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior. Let us take heart of grace,
courage, and comfort in faith; for Christ has blotted out the handwriting
that was against us, and has nailed it to his cross, and has spoiled
Principalities, and Powers, and made a show of them openly, triumphing over
them in the same cross, Col. 2.14.

And so much for the second general part, or branch of the Text, his
sufferings ( has suffered.)

The third and last part is the occasion of his sufferings ( for sins.)

Look how largely he spoke before of his sufferings in a general word ( has
suffered) meaning all sufferings, so largely he also speaks of the occasion
of his sufferings in a general word ( for sins) meaning all sins. But take
this ( all) with this restraint, namely, for all men's sins: And let this ( all)
again be thus expounded, for all men's sins competently and sufficiently, but
only for all the Elects sins actually, and effectually.

For first, it appears that he suffered for no sins of his own; for the
Text here denies him to have any, in that it calls him just (the just for
the unjust) And it is also plain that he suffered not for lost Angels sins; for
he in no sort took the Angels, but he took the seed of Abraham, Heb. 2.16. And
why not them as well as us, seeing they were the more noble, and excellent
creatures? They were celestial spirits, we earthly bodies, dust and ashes: They
were immediate attendants upon God, as it were of his privy chamber, we
servants of his lower house of this world, farther remote from his glorious
presence: Their office was to sing Haleluiahs, songs of praise to God in the
heavenly Paradise, ours to dress the Garden of Eden, which was but an earthly
Paradise: They sinned but once, and but in thought (as is commonly held) but
Adam sinned in thought, by lusting, in deed by tastting, in word by excusing:
Why then did not Christ suffer for their sins as well as for ours? or if for
any, why not for theirs rather then ours? Even so, O Father, for so it pleased
thee, Mat. 11.26. We move this question not as being curious to search thy
secret counsels, but that we may the more fill our hearts with admiration of
thy goodness toward us, and be the more tankfull for thy favor, joyful in
thy mercy, and cheerful in thy love, acknowledging ourselves more bound unto
thee for that we have received more bounty from thee then even thine Angels,
thy noblest creatures.

So then, Christ has suffered for the sins of Mankind only, and that (as
aforesaid) of all Mankind (if we respect the sufficiency of his sufferings) so
that if any be not benefited by it, the defect, and fault is not in it, but in
their not apprehending and applying it: Else why is it thus largely said in
this indefinite speech ( Christ has suffered for sins, excepting no sins) but
that every one should have liberty to infer, conclude, and say, for my sins.
Art thou a young sinner? Christ has suffered for sins: Art thou an old sinner?
Christ has suffered for sins. Art thou a Jew sinner? Christ has suffered for
sins: Art thou a Gentile sinner? Christ has suffered for sins: Art thou a bond
sinner? art thou a free sinner? art thou a male sinner? art thou a female
sinner? art thou a great sinner? art thou a grievous sinner, Christ has
suffered for sins: Who ever thou art, or whatever thy sins be, here is no
exception to thee, or to them, but thou may safely infer, and say, Christ
has suffered for sins, therefore for my sins.

Only let thy sins be sins, and think them not to be virtues: say not, All
these things have I kept from my youth up: say not, I fast twice a week, I give
tithe of all that I possess: say not, I have no sin; for then what have thou
to do with the sufferings of Christ? be suffered for sins: The whole need not
the Physician, but they that are sick: He came not to call the righteous but
sinners. Therefore excuse not thy sin as Adam did, saying, The woman which
thou gave me: Neither color it, as Judas did, saying Hail Master: neither
deny it, as Gehazi did, saying, Thy servant went no whither: neither defend it
as Jonah did, saying, I do well to be angry: But freely and penitently
confess it as David did, saying, I have sinned against the Lord: For then as
David was, so shall thou be answered, The Lord has put away thy sin, thou
shall not die; and then thou may comfortably lay hold on the sufferings of
Christ, and apply them to thine own soul, else thou have no part or portion in
him or them; for Christ has suffered for sins: For sins (I say) in general;
all and of all: Mr. Theoph. Thynne at Longleat.
And therefore also of this Infant whom our present business does concern: For
all the seed of the Faithful are within the Covenant of Grace, as is proved
Romans 4. to wit, that the promise is made to Abraham, and his seed, as well
spiritual as natural; even to all the faithful; yea and to their seed also,
Act. 2.39. And though Infants have not actual faith themselves, yet being
presented by the faithful, they are accepted as faithful, De liber. arb. lib.
3. cap. 23.
as says St. Augustine, Pie recteque creditur prodesse parvulo little fidem a
quibus consecrandus offertur: It is godly and rightly believed that the Infant
(in Baptism) is profited by their Faith by whom it is offered. And again, De
ver. Apo. Ser. 10.
Accommodat illis matter ecclesia aliorum pedes ut veniant, aliorum cor ut
credant, aliorum linguam ut fateantur. Our Mother the Church does lend unto
them the feet of others, that they may come, the heart of others that they may
believe, Ser. 3. de Annun.
the tongue of others that they may confess. And St. Bernard, Supplet munus
gratiae quod in eis habet natura minus possibile. The work of Grace supplyeth
in them that which in nature is impossible. Yea they are said (in some sort) to
have faith, in as much as they have the Sacrament of Faith: Aug: Bonifacio
Epist. 23.
And as the same Augustine speaks, Sacramentum fidei fides est: Respondetur
fidem habere, etc. The Sacrament of Faith is to them Faith: It is answered,
they have faith in respect of the Sacrament of faith: Ipsius fidei sacramentum
fidelem facit; the Sacrament of Faith makes the child faithful, Non rei ipsi
mente annuendo, sed ipsius rei sacramentum percipiendo, not by assenting to the
matter it self, but by partaking the Sacrament thereof: Doubt ye not
therefore, but earnestly believe that this Infant also has his part in Christ's
sufferings, which is thus general for sins.

And thus I have briefly run thorough the three chief parts or points of this
Text, the sufferer, his sufferings, and the occasion of his sufferings.

Now considering the majesty of the sufferer, the extremity of his sufferings,
and the vileness of the occasion, I cannot let all this so slightly pass, but
I must needs draw out of it some further use and instruction. And first, it
does justly drive me into admiration of Christ's wonderful love to us. When
David heard of the death of his dear friend Jonathan, he was so rapt with
passion, and so ravished with admiration thorough the remembrance of his love,
that he calls it wonderful: Woe is me (says he) for thee my brother
Jonathan, very kind have thou been to me, thy love to me was wonderful, 2 Samuel
1.

But now (O David) let me tell thee thy wonder was nothing, it was but a
shadow to this love of Christ which we have to wonder at: For Jonathan loved
thee, for that thy carriage and behavior both toward him and his Father did
deserve it, but Christ loved us notwithstanding our carriage and behavior
deserved his and his Fathers hatred. Jonathan loved thee well, for that he much
enjoyed the present, and much more expected the future requital of thy love to
him, but Christ loved us when he enjoyed our present enmity, and had no hope of
any future recompense. Jonathan bewrayed his love to thee in that he clothed
thee with his ornaments ( his robes and his garments, 1 Samuel 18.4.) and armed
thee with his own weapons ( his sword and his bow) but Christ bewrayed (I had
almost said betrayed) his love to us in that he not only clothed and armed us
with his own spiritual robes, and weapons, but also took our rags of
corporal infirmity, yea our sins upon himself. Jonathan loved thy life and
safety well, but yet he loved his own better, for when his father for anger
against thee cast his spear at him, he avoided and fled, and would not abide
his Fathers fury, but Christ loved our life and safety so well, that for it he
was content to lose his own, and did not shrink his own side from the spear. If
ever therefore (O David) thou had cause to call Jonathans love wonderful,
much more cause have we to give the same title to the love of Christ, and to
say to him, very kind have thou been to us, O sweet Savior, thy love to us was
wonderful. Yea needs must his love be wonderful, seeing he himself is
wonderful, for so the Prophet speaks, Is. 9.6. He shall call his name
wonderful. Wonderful then is his name, and wonderful is his love; for behold
what wonders it works: It caused the second person being God to take our
nature, to become flesh, and to unite two natures (God and Man, Joh. 1.14.) in
one person: behold a wonder. It caused a Virgin to conceive, breed, and bear a
son, and to be at once a mother, and a maid, behold a wonder: It caused an
innocent person to give his life, and shed his blood not for his friends but
his for his enemies: behold a wonder: It caused the Lord of life to be billed,
as St. Peter speaks, Act. 3.15. and the Lord of glory to be crucified, as St.
Paul speaks, 1 Cor. 2.8. Behold a wonder; yea it is so wonderful, that it is
supra omnem creaturam, ultra omnem mensuram, contra omnem naturam, above all
creatures, beyond all measure, contrary to all nature. Above all creatures; for
it is above the Angels, and therefore above all others: Beyond all measure, for
time did not begin it, time shall never end it, place does not bound it, sins
does not exceed it, no estate, no age, no sex is denied it, tongues cannot
express it, understandings cannot conceive it. Contrary to all nature; for
what nature can love where it is hated? can forgive where it is provoked? can
offer reconcilement where it receives wrong? can heap up kindness upon
contempt, favor upon ingratitude, mercy upon sin? Well therefore (and much
more justly then David) may we make use of that speech, and say to Christ,
Very kind have thou been to us, O dear Savior, thy love to us was wonderful.

And now I can no longer stand in admiration of this wonder, for behold another
wonder offers it self to take me off from this, and that is the wonderment of
our lack of love to him; for his so wonderful loving us, does make this also to
be a wonder, that we should lack love to him. The Scripture says, that in
doing works of love unto our enemy, we do heap coals of fire upon his head,
Romans 12. Love is compared to fire, in heaping love we heap up fire: Now the
property of fire is to turn all it meets withal into its own nature; fire
makes all things fire, the coal makes burning coals, Prove. 26.21. And is it
not a wonder then that Christ having heaped such abundance of the fiery coals
of his love upon our heads, we should yet remain key-cold in love to him? what
metal are we made of, that Christ's fiery love cannot work upon us, or inflame
us: Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burnt? or can a
man go upon coals, and his feet not be burnt? Prove. 6.27. And is it not a
wonder then that we can take the fervent fire of Christ's love into the bosom
of our memories? that we can remember it, and pass over it with the feet of
our cogitations; that we can think upon it, and yet receive no heat or
inflammation from it? Moses wondered why the bush consumed not, when he saw it
all on fire, Exodus 3.3. but behold I show you a greater wonder, we walk (like
those three children in the fiery furnace, Dan. 3.) even in the midst of
Christ's fiery love flaming round about us, and yet (alas) how little true
smell of that sweet fire is there to be felt upon us?

But there may be some reason rendered of this wonder, namely because we are too
much overwhelmed with the love of the world; for as love is compared to fire,
so the world is compared to the sea. Now the sea is a contrary element to the
fire, and does hinder the working of it: So long then as we lie soked in the
love of the world, the love of Christ cannot inflame us.

Let us therefore rouse our selves, and shake off from us this waterish worldly
love, that so we may be fit matter for Christ's fiery love to work upon, that
our hearts being hot, and the fire being kindled within us, it may break forth
continually in our tongues, and in our hands, in our words, and in our works,
to his praise and glory.

Thirdly, the consideration of Christ's sufferings; does move us not only to
admire his love to us, nor only to be ashamed of our lack of love to him, but
it does also move us to love those that are like him in suffering; the poor and
needy, the miserable and afflicted are lively images and resemblances; and
therefore also should be remembrances to us of Christ: When we meet a man that
is like some friend of ours: we rejoice to do him all the love and kindness
that we can for our friends sake whom he does resemble: And shall we not also
rejoice to show love and kindness to the afflicted and miserable, seeing they
do so lively resemble their chief and best, yea indeed our only true friend
Christ? Yea they do so lively resemble him, that he speaks of them as if they
were himself, and puts himself in their stead; I was hungry and ye gave me
no meat, thirsty, and ye gave me no drink; for in as much as ye did it not to
one of the least of these my brethren ye did it not to me, Mat. 25. It is then
a great presumption, and a shrewd suspicion that we never took Christ for our
friend, or that now we have forgotten our friendship, if we show no love or
respect to those who are so well like him: And if we show our selves so
forgetful of him here, as to take no notice of him in his so lively images, it
will be just that he also forget us hereafter, and answer us with Nescio vos,
I know you not.

Fourthly, the consideration of Christ's sufferings, does move us, not only to
admire his love to us, nor only to love him again, nor only to love those
that are like him in sufferings, but further also, to love and embrace his very
sufferings themselves, cheerfully and comfortably to entertain misery and
affliction, seeing it was the special ornament wherewith Christ was swadled at
his birth, clothed in his life, and crowned in his death. We use to make much
account of those robes and ornaments which our loving friends were went to
wear; therefore some do superstitiously worship the relics of Christ, and of
his Saints; but behold, misery and affliction is the chiefest relic that
Christ has left behind him; for with it he clothed himself at his birth, as
with a garment, and wore it all his life, and never put it off until he dyed:
It was the first, and the last thing that he wore; he never slept, nor waked
without it. If then we love, and make account of Christ, we will also love, and
make much account of this relic which he has left behind him, and will think
it rather a grace then any disgrace unto us. Never was Jacob more gracious, and
acceptable to his Father Isaac, then when he stood before him clothed in the
garments of his rough brother Esau: then the Father smelling the savor of the
elder brothers garments, said, behold the smell of my son is as the smell of a
field which the Lord has blessed, Genesis 27. And never are we more gracious and
acceptable to God our heavenly Father, then when we stand before him clothed in
the rough garments of Christ's miseries and afflictions; for then especially we
become noisome to our selves, and to the world, and therefore then especially we
are as a fragrant field unto the Lord.

I speak not this to persuade any man wilfully to make himself miserable; for
our Savior himself has pronounced it to be A more blessed thing to give then
to receive. Neither do I speak to commend, or justify the counterfeit zeal of
those that mock the world with a false show of wilful poverty, whiles
(shutting themselves up in a Cloister, that they may seem to forsake the world)
they do indeed enjoy it in all superfluity: Or at the least the worst of their
misery is no more then that which that holy man prays for, Pro. 30.8. Give me
neither poverty nor riches, feed me with food convenient for me. If they have
no excess, they are sure to feel no want, but to be sufficiently provided for,
both for back and belly so long as they live there; and are they not then very
zealous think you in binding themselves to such a misery? But my speech is to
hearten all those with comfort on whom God has laid affliction, that they may
be so far from impatience, as rather to rejoice in tribulation, Romans 5.3.
because it was their Masters common lot and portion; for the Disciple is not
above his Master, nor the servant above his Lord; it is enough for the Disciple
to be as his Master, and the servant as his Lord.

Yea not only the afflictions of life, but death it self, and the grave should
be welcome and acceptable to us; for Christ also has passed them, and by
suffering has sanctified them unto us: so that the curse of death is turned
into a blessing, and the grave is become a bed of rest, Rev. 14.13. and that
Prophecy, Is. 11.8. is fulfilled, The sucking child shall play upon the holt
of the Asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand upon the Cockatrice hole.
There is now no danger to Gods children in the hole of death, that is, the
Grave; for death has lost his sting, and cannot hurt us; so that we may
triumph and say, O death where is thy sting, O Grave where is thy victory? The
sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the Law, but thanks be to God
which has given us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ, 1 Cor. 15.

In the last place, let us learn, not only to admire Christ's love to us; nor
only to love him again; nor only to love those that are like to him in
suffering, nor only to love his sufferings themselves, but withal to hate sin
which was the occasion of his sufferings. Sin was the occasion of Christ's
sufferings: for had not Adam sinned, Christ had had no cause or need to suffer:
If therefore we love him, we cannot choose but hate that which was to him the
occasion of such a miserable life, and such a shameful, painful, and cruel
death. David, 2 Samuel 23. being an high Captain, though he longed for the water
of Bethleem, yet would not taste it when he had it, because it cost his three
soldiers the hazard of their lives thathe might have it. Much more (we being
servile soldiers) though our souls long for the sweet waters of sin, yet
should we forbear to taste it, because it cost our high Captain Christ not the
hazard, but the very loss of his life, that we might not have it.

God showed Moses a tree wherewith he might make the bitter waters sweet, Exo.
15.25. but behold I show you a tree, wherewith ye may make the sweet waters of
sin to become bitter. Look upon the tree of Christ, remember his Cross, and the
pains he suffered thereon, and the false sweetness of sin will quickly vanish,
and ye shall rightly relish the bitterness of it. If the delight of any sin
offer it self unto you, cast Christ his Cross into it: do but remember his
sufferings for sin, and all sin will presently grow distasteful: For how can it
choose but be hateful to us, if we consider how hurtful it was to him.

The Jews would not put those thirty pieces into their Treasury, because they
thought them to be the price of blood, Mat. 27.6. but therein I must say they
were deceived: for Judas for that money did rather sell himself, and his own
soul, then Christ or Christ's blood: For Christ was sold before, even God had
sold him before to death for the sin of man: For when in the fall of man the
devil offered sin unto God, then did God threaten Christ unto him, namely, That
the seed the woman should break the serpents head, Genesis 3. And had not Christ
been so sold before to death for sin, not all the treasure in Jerusalem, nor in
all the world could have bought him.

Seeing then that Sin was the true and proper price for which Christ was sold,
how unworthy are we the name of Christians, yea how much worse are we then
Jews, if we suffer this price of blood to come into the treasury of our hearts?

If therefore any motion of pride arise in thy mind, answer, and tell it, thou
art the price of blood: If any temptation of lust be offered to thine eyes,
answer, and tell it, thou art the price of blood: If any provocation of anger
or revenge be urged to thy hands, answer, and tell it, thou art the price of
blood: If any greediness of gain move thee to wrong or oppression, answer, and
tell it, thou art the price of blood: And whatsoever sin thou art tempted to,
answer, and tell it, thou art the occasion of my Saviors death, thou art the
price of Christ's blood, thou may not therefore come into the treasury of my
heart.

O blessed Lord, and sweet Savior, we do even with astonishment admire thy
passing great love toward us; we pray thee also by the fervent fire of thy
great love that is upon us, to kindle in us true love to thee again; yea to all
that are like thee in thy sufferings; yea to thy sufferings themselves, that we
may patiently bear them whenever they befall us. But make us truly to hate
sin that was the occasion of thy sufferings. We believe, O Lord, that by thy
blood thou have washed us from the guilt of sin; we beseech thee also make us
more and more effectually find and feel that by thy spirit thou do purge us
from the love of sin, that so our consciences may be comforted in all our life,
and especially in our death, and our souls and bodies eternally saved in the
life to come, by and thorough thy all-sufficient sufferings and satisfactions:
For which unto thee, with the Father, and the Holy Ghost, three persons, one
eternal God, we render all possible praise, and thanksgiving, and desire all
honor and glory, might and majesty may be ascribed for ever and ever, Amen.

A SERMON preached at the Visitation held at Campden, May 4. 1636.
Text. JOH. 13.17. If ye know these things, blessed (or happy) are ye if ye do
them.


WHEN Moses was to bring his brethren the Jews into the land of Canaan, he sent
spies before him to search and survey the land, and to bring him notice both
what the goodness of the land was, and what was the strength of the people
that did possess it: And those spies (when they had gone thorough the land,
and surveyed it) returned, and brought of the fruit of the Country; a great
bunch of Grapes, which was so big, that they were fain to put it upon a bar,
and carry it between two of them: And they brought news also of mighty enemies
that possessed and defended the Country, the sons of Anack, the Canaanites, the
Jebusites, as you may read in the 13th Chapter of the book of Numbers.

Not much unlike to this, Christ Jesus, our Moses, our Captain, our Deliverer,
being about to bring his brethren both Jews and Gentiles into the spiritual
land of Canaan, the celestial Jerusalem, and being himself Prince of that
Country, and therefore well enough acquainted with it, he sends not spies to
search it, but Messengers to certify us of it, and to guide and conduct us
into it.

And in this verse (now read) he sends two Porters or Messengers, bringing
of the fruit of the Country between them with a bar upon their shoulders: The
foremost Porter that goes before, is knowing (If ye know) The hindermost that
comes behind, is doing (If ye do) The fruit that they bear between them is
Blessedness (Blessed are ye) The staff or bar whereon they bear it, is These
things; If ye know these things, blessed are ye if ye do them.

And they bring news also of mighty enemies that do oppose and resist us, and
hinder our entrance into that good land: The foremost Porter or Messenger that
goes before (that is knowing)(If ye know) that does seem to warn us of that
subtle Gibeonite the Devil, who does catch and snare us in his subtle slights;
therefore we have need of knowing (If ye know) The hindermost Porter or
Messenger, that is doing (if ye do) that seems to warn us of that
Sea-bordering Merchant the Canaanite (that is the World) whose ware and
traffic is Milk and Honey, sweet, but swelling meat; ye may soon take too
much of it: And of that wanton tempting Moabite, that is the flesh; and of that
high inhabiting Amerite dwelling upon the Mountains, that is Pride: Of which
three Enemies St. John speaks, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes,
the pride of life. These three enemies, not only with deceit and subtilty, but
with open violence do stop the way of the tree of life. Therefore we had need
not to be idle, but to be doing, If ye do them. And as those spies of Moses
brought not all the fruit of the land of Canaan, but only a taste, so these
Messengers of Christ do not bring all the fruit of the kingdom of heaven, but
only a taste of it: Blessed are ye; but how? Inchoative non consummative, by
inchoation, not by consummation; ye shall have the first fruits of it here for
a taste (peace of conscience, and joy in the holy Ghost) but not the full
harvest till ye come thither.

And again, as that fruit which those spies brought unto Moses was too heavy
for one of them, and therefore they put it between two of them, so that it hung
equally on them both; so this fruit which Christ sends by these two
Messengers is too heavy for one of them: Knowing cannot bear it alone, Doing
cannot bear it alone, therefore he puts it between them, so that it hangs
equally on them both: If ye know these things, blessed are ye if ye do them.

And again, as those spies of Moses in bearing that fruit of Canaan did bear
both with one staff, though not both at one end of the staff, but the one
going before, and the other coming after, so these Messengers of Christ in
bearing this fruit of Blessedness, do bear it both with one staff; that is
(these things) For that which reaches unto knowing (know these things)
reaches also unto doing (do them) that is, the same things: (...) and (...),
all is but these and the same things. Neither can they bear both at one end of
the staff, but knowing must go before and lead the way, and doing must follow
and come after; If ye know these things blessed are ye if you do them.

And again, as in carrying that fruit of Canaan, if either the foremost man
should be too hasty, or the hindermost man too flow, their burden then would
fall down between them, and they would both of them lose it: or if the
hindermost man should strive to go foremost, it must needs be that by their
winding; and turning about they must both go backwards. So here, if either
Knowing that goes before should be too hasty, and run away too fast, or if
Doing that comes after should be too slow and drag behind, the burden must
needs fall down between them, and they must both of them lose it: Or if Doing
should be so hare-brain'd as to strive to go before Knowing, it might well be
called a going backwards, which is preposterous in reason, and monstrous in
nature, but if they both go soberly and orderly together, then the burden will
be most easily, and most safely, and surely born, If ye know these things,
blessed are ye if ye do them: But similitudes go not without their
differences; therefore seeing I have showed you one part here, let the other
also appear.

First, those children of Israel in carrying that fruit of Canaan could not
both of them look upon their burden, but of necessity he that went foremost
must needs turn his back toward it; but here these children of the holy Ghost
( Knowing, and Doing) do both look toward; and have both their faces turned
toward their burden of blessedness; for why should ye know these things?
because blessed are ye: And why should ye do them? because blessed are ye:
They do both look toward Blessedness. If ye know these things blessed are ye
if ye do them.

Again, those enemies that kept the children of Israel out of the land of
Canaan were in possession of the land, and did inhabit it; but this cursed
crew, and rebelling rabble that do keep us out of the kingdom of heaven, that
is, that Gibconite the Devil, which deals with us by subtilty, against whom
Knowing does seem to be opposed: and that Canaanite the World; and that Moabite
the Flesh, and that Amorite Pride, which deal with us by violence, against
which Doing does seem to be opposed; these enemies (I say) are not possession
of our promised land, nor inhabiters of it, but are borderers, or rather
outlaws, living by the spoil of men ( without are dogs, Rev. 22.15.) who
being kept out themselves, would keep out all others with them.

But to come more directly to the matter. I observe in this Text these five
points.

First, that knowing is required (If ye know.)

2. That doing is required (if ye do.)

3. What we must know and do (these things.)

4. That neither knowing alone, nor doing alone, but both together are required
to make us blessed: Not blessed are ye if you know only; nor blessed are ye if
ye do only, but both, If ye know these things, blessed are ye if ye do them.

5. The reward of our knowing, and doing, that is blessedness (blessed are ye.)

For the first, that knowing is required.

Ratio and Oration (says the Heathen man) Reason and speech are the principal
things that do make men more excellent then beasts: And it is Reason
especially that makes the difference: For if a man speak without Reason, what
does his voice differ from the voice of a beast? David says, Man being in
honor has no understanding, but is compared to the beasts that perish: Why is
he compared to the beasts? Not for his want of speech, but for his want of
understanding: For though a man have speech, he is nevertheless a beast if he
want reason; and if he have reason, he is nevertheless a man though he want
speech. And if we go further, and make comparison in other things, whether they
be bona corporis, or bona fortunae (as he calls them) goods of the body, or
goods of fortune, as health, strength, beauty, peace, plenty, and the rest, in
these things the beasts are equal, if not superior to us, only it is that
same bonum animi, that intellectual faculty of the soul, apprehending things
past, present, and to come, that does set us before them, and makes them come
short of us. Therefore when Solomon had the wish of his heart given him, he
desired none of those outward things of the body, or of fortune, but the only
thing that he desired was the inward good of the mind, wisdom and knowledge,
because he knew that other things were common to beasts as well as to man, but
only wisdom would make him more excellent then beasts, and most like unto
God. Yea his wisdom indeed did make him not only more excellent then beasts,
but also more excellent then men: For as reason differenceth men from beasts,
so wisdom differenceth men from men; according to that in the Comedy, Homini
homo quidpraestat, stulto intelligens quid interest? What difference is there
between man and man, what odds between the wise and the foolish? A poor child
that is wise (says Solomon) is better then an old foolish King, Eccles. 4.13.
Here is childhood and poverty for wisdoms sake preferred before age and
dignity. Again, he says Prove. 3.35. Fools have dishonor, though they be
exalted. Before, wisdom was honored in poverty, and here folly is dishonored
in dignity: Fools have dishonor though they be exalted.

But what do I lighting a candle before the Sun, and casting water into the
Sea? Why do I commend that which no man does mislike, and why do I exhort you
to go, when as ye are voluntarily ready to run, yea (if it were possible) to
fly? For there is scarce a man to be found, I say not so void of grace, but so
monstrous in nature, that does not desire knowledge: If we look among the
wildest savages for a man that affects ignorance, and does not in some sort
desire knowledge, we shall nodum in scirpo quaerere, we shall hardly find this
error in the nature of man: What ventures by sea? what travels by land? what
studies by day? what watchings by night do men undertake and endure in the
search and pursuit of knowledge, some in one kind, and some in another? It was
not for naught then that Christ threatened him with hell fire that called his
brother fool; for there cannot be a more odious reproach given then fool; for
very nature does abhor to be ignorant. Yea so so much do men abhor ignorance,
that every man does profess himself not to be a searcher and seeker of wisdom
and knowledge, but to be a keeper and possessor of it, not a student, but a
master, not to seek it, but to have it, and think it a shame to be thought to
want it, and will take it in great scorn to be told he has it not. Every man,
I say; for even the basest are ready to brag of it, as Solomon observes, The
rich man is wise in his own conceit, Prove. 28.11. And the slothful man is
wiser in his own conceit then seven men that can render a reason, Prove. 26.16.
Seeing therefore that men of all, yea even the worst conditions, are thus
stored and furnished with knowledge, I have more need to commend it in all,
then to commend it to all. But as St. Paul in another case, so may I say in
this, Shall I praise you in this? I praise you not: For this knowledge which is
so common and general is only in conceit, it is not in truth: And what shall
I say then? that it is knowledge? Nay, but rather that it is mere ignorance,
and folly, which St. Paul proves, 1 Cor. 8.2. If any man think, he knows any
thing, he knows nothing yet as he ought to know. If he know nothing, then it
must be granted that his knowledge is mere folly; yea his conceited knowledge
is not only folly, but it is worse then folly, Prove. 26.12. See thou a man
that is wise in his own conceit: there is more hope of a fool then of him; his
knowledge is worse then folly; yea it is not only worse then folly, but it is
a cursed folly, there is a woe goes with it, Is. 5.21. Woe unto them that are
wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight. Will ye know then what
knowledge is, and what it is to be wise? St. Paul advises him that would be
wise to turn fool, 1 Cor. 3.18. If any man among you (says he) seem to be
wise in this world, let him be a fool, that he may be wise. This is strange
doctrine, must wise men be fools? how is that possible? yes, they must be
fools in the estimation or account of the world; they must embrace him who is
to the Grecians foolishness: that is, Christ: They must follow the foolishness
of Preaching, and they must conform themselves to that foolishness of God; for
so the Apostle (in the name and person of the World) calls it, 1 Cor. 1.25.
They need not be ashamed to be fools in such kind, and in such company: but
especially they must be fools in their own opinion, having an humble conceit
of themselves: Alii melius de te quam tu sentiant, and tibi minima videantur
quae feceris, ut majora quotidie possis, says Lipsius: and Solomon does
plainly construe him, Prove. 27.2. Let another man praise thee, and not thine
own mouth; a stranger, and not thine own lips. Knowledge then appears to be
necessary, and by Christ here to be required; yet in knowing we must not know
(I mean in our own opinion) we must have an humble and meek conceit of our
knowledge, and say with David, Lord I am not high minded, I have no proud
looks, but I refrain my soul, and keep it low like as a child that is weaned
from his mother, yea my soul is even as a weaned child.

And so much for the first point of the Text, viz. that knowing is required, If
ye know. The second is that doing is required, If ye do.

It is said of our Savior, Act. 1.2. that he did do, and teach; not teach
only, but do and teach. And when the Disciples of John came to ask him, Art
thou he that should come, or look we for another? he satisfied them by showing
them his doings and works: The blind receive sight, the halt go, the Lepers
are cleansed, Mat. 11.

And when he would make himself known to his Disciples, he showed them his
hands and his feet (he did not show them his head) Luke 24.39. As Christ made
himself known to be Christ, so should we make our selves known to be
Christians: We must show our hands, and our feet, the works we do, and the
ways wherein we walk: For as a tree is known by his fruits, so is a Christian
known by his works. Therefore Moses gives it in charge to the people to bird
the Law to their hand, Deuteronomy. 6.8. He does not bid them slightly lay it to
their hand that they might shake it off when they would, as St. Paul shakt off
the Viper, Act. 28. as if it were a Nolime tangere, but bind it to your hand,
that ye may do it, and continue doing it.

But some perhaps may say to me, why do you tell us of binding the Law to our
hands? You should rather tell us of binding the Gospel to our heads; tell not
us of Fac hoc and vives, Do this and thou shall live: but tell us rather of
that whosoever believes in him shall never dye, Joh. 11.26. What need we take
thought for doing when as Christ has done all for us already? He is the Lord
our righteousness, Jer. 23.6. Thus do many deceive themselves with a dead
faith, as if Christ had redeemed us unto idleness, nay unto wickedness. But
though Christ has redeemed us, yet St. Paul bid us, work out our salvation
with fear and trembling, Phil. 2.12.

Simon did not begin to carry the Cross out of Jerusalem, nor Christ did not
carry it throughout unto Mount Calvary; to teach us, that as without him we
cannot begin our salvation, so without us he will not end it. Not that
Popishly we should be comeritors with Christ, but only co workers with his
grace, for the peace of our own consciences, the good example of our neighbor,
and for the satisfaction of the Church.

But if Christ had left out this latter clause of words (if ye do them) yet he
had spoken enough for doing in the former words, only in requiring knowing;
for by knowing sometimes in Scripture is understood doing, to know does imply
to do, as Joh. 17.3. This is life eternal, that they know thee to be the
only true God: Where that knowing does imply doing, it appears by that, 1 John 2.3. Hereby we are sure that we know him, if we keep his Commandments. He
that says, I know him, and keeps not his Commandments, he is a liar, and
the truth is not in him: Here ye see that knowing does imply doing, to know
God is to keep his Commandments. And in this sense it is said of Christ, 2
Cor. 5.21. That he knew no sin, that is, that he did none: And of God, Mat.
25.12. I know you not, that is, I have nothing to do with you: For he has
nothing to do with the stool of wickedness, Psalm. 94.20. Seeing then knowing
does imply doing, it had been enough (I say) to set us awork, and make us be
doing, if he had said no more but this, If ye know these things, blessed are
ye, though he had left out, If ye do them. But seeing he has set down that
also in plain terms, how much more are we to consider it, to remember it, and
to practice it? But I hasten forwards, and come to the third point, viz. What
we must know and do (these things.)

If ye ask me what is here meant, and what is to be understood by these
things? I answer, that if you look back into the forepart of this Chapter, ye
shall find unum necessarium one thing for all, which if ye know, and if you
do, I may say unto you, Blessed are ye: It is the example of examples, the
example of Charity, which the Apostle says, is the fulfilling of the Law;
Filius Dei tam sese humiliter abjicere atque prosternere, ut pedes discipulorum
lavet, stupendum est charitatis exemplum, Dr. Plaifore.
says an eloquent Doctor of late time, That the Son of God should so abase and
prostrate himself, as to wash his Disciples feet, it is an astonishing example
of Charity. This is that example we have here, namely, of Christ's charity in
washing his Disciples feet: Wherein we have matter of learning for our
knowing, and matter of example for our doing: Matter of learning for our
knowing: For whereas (no doubt) he sat uppermost, or in the chief room, he
rises and leaves his place, and puts off his upper garment, there is his
descension and humiliation; he girdeth himself with a towel, there is his
Incarnation; he powers out water, there is the shedding of his blood, and the
effusion of his spirit; into a basin, into all the world; peace to them that
are afar off, peace to them that are near: He began, there is his own
inchoation; to wash or cleanse, there is outward mortification; the feet,
signifying the affections, there is inward sanctification; of the Disciples,
there is election; he wipeth them with the towell wherewith he was girt, there
our filthiness cleaves to his flesh, he is made sin for us: And having done,
he takes his garment, and his seat again, there is his Ascension, and Session;
and being set he teaches his Disciples what he has done, there is his
continual guiding of the Church by the spirit of truth: And all this is for
our knowledge and speculation.

Again, for our practice and imitation: the Master does a good work to his
servants, there superiors have an example of charity: Peter is reproved for
refusing, there inferiors have example of obedience. He does the work before
them, therefore we must teach by our actions and examples: Having done, he
tells of it, and exhorts them to follow it, therefore we must teach by our
instructions, and exhortations: He does it, and tells it to his Disciples,
therefore we must have discretion to know where to bestow exhortation; for we
may not cast pearls before swine, nor give that which is holy unto dogs, Mat.
7.6. And in all the whole work we have example of so great charity, meekness,
and humility, as is ever to be imitated, but never to be matched.

But because he says (these things) in the plural number, I will not
therefore restrain our knowing and doing to this one last action and
instruction of Christ, but rather refer them to all his actions and
instructions, yea to all the will of God revealed in his word: He that does
the will of my Father which is in heaven, says Christ, Mat. 7.21. The matter
(I say) wherein our knowing and doing must be exercised, is Gods revealed Will,
his Will revealed in his Word: And in a word, I may refer you for the total of
it to that of the Psalmist, My hands will I lift up to thy Commandments,
there is work for his hands; and my study shall be in thy statutes, there is the
same work for his head. It is Gods Commandments and Statutes, Gods Will
revealed in his Word that we must know and do: If ye know these things, blessed
are ye if ye do them.

Here therefore some go too far, and some come too short: Some go too far; for
they will not be contented with Gods revealed will, but they must needs dive
into his secrets, as into the incomprehensible mystery of the Trinity, into
the unsearchable counsel of Reprobation, into the secret and hidden time of
general judgment. But in these, and the like things we should not enquire,
but admire, and stand amazed with David and say, such knowledge is too
wonderful, and excellent for me, I cannot attain unto it, Psalm. 139. and cry
out with St. Paul, How unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past
finding out, Romans 11. For secret things belong to the Lord our God, but things
revealed to us and to our children, Deuteronomy. 29. We must know, and do revealed
things, but leave secret things to God, and not meddle with them, no more then
David did; I do not exercise my self (says he) in great matters that are too
high for me. Again, on the contrary part, others there are that come too short;
for they will have nothing to be the revealed will of God, but what is so in
plain terms, and proper words expressed, or what their private spirit
interprets, or conceiteth to be employed: But if they would stand to the rule,
they should lose the use of many things, because there be no plain words for
them in the Scriptures, which yet nevertheless they do, and may lawfully use,
and with a good conscience, because though not in plain words, yet by
sufficient consequence the Scripture does approve them. Non nostrum est tantas
componere lites, I cannot think to stint this great strife, yet I may presume
to give my advise as one that has also obtained mercy, 1 Cor. 7.25. And that
is, that we be not so afraid of the shadow as to lose the substance, nor
stand talking so much of the proportion of the doors and windows, as to forget
to build the house: Nor to make our selves like to the Picture of Justice, that
is, to have ears and mouth, but no eyes nor hands, to be all for hearing and
speaking, and yet be blind in knowledge, lame in good works. Or if we have
eyes, that we be not like the Idols that have eyes, and see not: Nor be so
troubled with the beam of blind zeal, or with the motes of dissension, or with
the scales of self-conceit, as to be pore-blind, and to see but unperfectly, as
he that saw men walking, and could not discern them from trees, Mar. 8.24. And
if we have hands, that they be not hands that handle not, or else withered
hands that handle without feeling; or else (such hands as the soldiers were,
Mat. 27.27.) busied in nothing but renting and tearing the body of Christ (that
is, the Church) with wounds of Schism and dissension: And our learning and
knowledge be not such as St. Paul says puffs up: And what knowledge is that
that puffs up? ye may see it 1 Timothy 6.3. If any man consents not to the
doctrine that is according to godliness (he says not, to the express words of
Scripture, but to the doctrine that is according to godliness) he is puffed up.

Finally, that we think the judgment of our betters to be better then our
own, and that we owe much to the consent and authority of the Church: Knowing
this first, that no prophecy of scripture is of any private interpretation, 2
Pet. 1.20.

The fourth point observed is, that neither knowing alone, nor doing alone
suffices unto blessedness, but both are required; If ye know these things,
blessed are ye if ye do them.

We are mixed creatures compounded of the four Elements, not all of the light
ones, nor all of the heavy ones, but indifferently of both: we must not
therefore be all levitie to ascend, nor all gravity to descend, but of both
indifferently mixed: Not all of the fire aspiring beyond the Moon, hot and dry,
hot in knowledge, dry in works: Nor all of the water, cold and moist; moist and
fluent in works, but cold in knowledge: Not all of the air, nothing but a
subtle lightness of knowledge; nor all of the earth, nothing but a gross
massy heap of actions; but having faces looking upward to heaven, we should
ascend up to God in knowledge; and having feet treading upon the earth, we
should descend to our brethren in our actions: For it is not enough to know
only, nor to do only, but both must go together to make us blessed, If ye
know these things, blessed are ye if ye do them.

First, that knowing is not sufficient, I told you before that knowing (if it
be right) does imply doing: And that knowledge indeed is a believing, and
therefore a working, and therefore a saving knowledge, and therefore it is
sufficient. But knowledge (according to the common acceptance) is such as the
Devils have, I know thee who thou art, says the Devil to Christ, Mar. 1.24.
And this is an unbeleeving, therefore an idle, therefore a condemning
knowledge: Scientia quae illuminat intellectum non accendit affectum; A
knowledge that does lighten understanding, but does not inflame the affection:
And of this knowledge ye may read Romans 1. That it did them no good that had it;
for when they knew God, and did not glorify him as God, God gave them up to
their own hearts lasts. Nay so far is such knowledge from being sufficient,
that it will rather accuse, then excuse us, and make our condemnation the
greater. He that had five Talents delivered him, had more to answer for, then
he that had but one: For to whomsoever much is given, of him much shall be
required, and to whom men much commit, the more of him will they ask, Luke
12.48. Therefore Solomon says, He that increases knowledge increases sorrow,
Eccl. 1. because the more a man knows the more he must do, and the more he
has to answer for if he do it not. Therefore also St. Peter says, It had
been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, then after
they have known it to turn from the holy Commandment, 2 Pet. 2.21. Therefore
St. Augustine prays, Sic doce me ut agam, non tantummodo ut sciam quid agere
debeam. Teach me, O Lord, so that I may do, and not only to know what to do.

And if knowing alone be not enough, what shall we say then for doing? that
may seem to be of it self all-sufficient; for if a man do the will of God, what
can be more required?

Yes, it is required also that ye know it as well as do it, and if thou do it,
not knowing it, thou do but lose thy labor: For it is an infallible rule,
that without faith it is impossible to please God; and it as infallible, that
without knowledge it is unpossible to have faith: For, how shall they believe
in him of whom they have not heard? Romans 10.13. Without knowledge therefore
there can be no faith, without faith no pleasing of God; and so it follows
necessarily, that without knowledge there can be no pleasing of God, and that
he that does the will of God, not knowing it to be Gods will, he does but beat
the air, and labor in vain; yea so far is he from pleasing God, that he does
directly displease and offend him: for whatsoever is not of Faith is sin, Romans
14.23. If faith does not draw it from the will of God as the original cause,
and direct it to the glory of God as the final cause, it will prove no better
then sin, Quia non actibus, sed finibus pensant ur officia (says Mr. Calvin)
because our performances of duties are not weighed by the actions, but by the
ends. Therefore St. Augustine calls the good works and virtues of the heathen
(splendida peccata) sins that make a fair show: And Cyprian writing on the
Creed, wishes rather to do sinful works being a faithful Christian, then
virtuous works being a faithless Pagan: for whatsoever is done without faith
and knowledge turns unto sin. Therefore, as at first, If ye know these
things, blessed are ye; but how? not unless ye do them; so again, If ye do
these things, blessed are ye, but how? not unless ye know them. Neither
knowing alone, nor doing alone can be sufficient to make us blessed, but both
must go together: If ye know these things, blessed are ye if ye do them. And
if it be not sufficient to have one of them alone, how much more insufficient
is it to want them both? Some perhaps may think that it is no matter for works
so long as they have no knowledge, and that the want of the one shall excuse
the want of the other, that their ignorance shall excuse them? Indeed Christ
excuses the Jews by their ignorance; They wot not what they do: but yet he
plainly intimates, that they were not innocent, or guiltless, in that he
prays his Father to forgive them; Father forgive them, they know not what
they do. And St. Peter testifies of them, that that through ignorance they did
it: but yet he does not therefore hold them innocent; for he bids them, amend
their lives and turn, that their sins may be put away, Act. 3.17.

But this you may say was wilful obstinate ignorance, hear therefore that
which may be understood of invincible ignorance, Luke 12.47. That servant that
knew his Masters will, and prepared not himself to do it, shall be beaten with
many stripes: His knowledge shall condemn him: but he that knew not, and did
commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes, his
ignorance shall not excuse him: Or at the least, if it do somewhat excuse him
in that he shall be beaten but with a few stripes, yet it shall not quite
clear him, for he shall be beaten with stripes. It shall be easier for Sodom
and Gomorrah (says Christ) in the day of judgment then for that City. Easier:
their ignorance may somewhat excuse them: but yet hard enough, and little ease;
for they suffered (no doubt) the flashes of hell in their consciences living,
the fuel of hell in their bodies dying (the Lord rained brimstone, and fire
upon them from heaven, Genesis 19.) and the flashes, fuel, and fire of hell in
their souls departed; for so St. Jude testifies of them, they suffer the
vengeance of eternal fire: And from such easiness good Lord deliver us.
Though therefore it be easier in the comparative degree, yet it is not so much
as easy in the positive degree; the word easier spoken there comparatively and
relatively, is not so much as the word easy spoken positively and simply. It
was but little ease then that their ignorance brought them, even such as belong
to them that know not God, that is, Christ shall come in flaming fire, and
render vengeance to them, 2 These. 1.3. Ignorance then is as far from making
innocent, as knowing alone, or doing alone is from making blessed: Ignorance
cannot excuse us, knowing cannot suffice us, doing cannot suffice us, but
ignorance being put away, knowing and doing must both come together, If ye know
these things blessed are ye if yo do them.

Here are those two Sisters so loving to, and so beloved of Christ, Martha and
Mary: the one studying to know, if ye know these things, the other earnest to
do them, if ye do them: the one stuffing her head with Doctrine, if ye know
these things, the other filling her hands with practice, if ye do them: the one
diligent in speculative contemplation, if ye know these things; the other as
busy in practique operation, if ye do them.

Here is Jacobs Ladder, touching heaven with the top, if ye know these things,
and reaching earth with the foot, if ye do them.

Here is Aaron the Priest, If ye know these things, holding up the hands of
Moses the Law, if ye do them.

Here is St. Paul for Faith, if ye know these things, shaking hands with St.
James for Works, if ye do them.

Here is the Philosophers Arbor transversa, a Tree turned upside down; the root
upwards, if ye know these things, the fruits downward, if ye do them.

Here are those two, not Meteors, but true lights, Castor and Pollux, which
when they appear together are surely prosperous to all that sail in the sea of
this life.

Here is calor and humor, the heat of Faith, the moisture of Works, both of
them so necessary to the life of the soul, that if either of them do fail, or
exceed the other, it breeds death, or dangerous sickness.

Here is Oleum and flamma, the flame of Faith, the oil of Works, if either of
them be wanting, or superabounding, the light of your conversation will soon
go out.

Here is Urim and Thummim, light and perfection, eyes and hands, faith and
works, the two Cherubims, knowing, and doing, turning both their faces toward
the Mercie-seat of blessedness; If ye know these things, blessed are ye if ye
do them.

Blessed are ye, which is the reward of our knowing and doing, and is the last
thing that I have before observed in the Text. (...), which I crave leave to
read (blessed) for the Translators do allow it, in as much as (though here
they render it (happy) yet nine times together they read it blessed, Mat. 5.

Blessed are ye for your knowing, because ye do what ye know: and blessed are
ye for your doing, because ye know what ye do: blessed are ye internally, for
the peace of your consciences is unto you a continual feast; blessed are ye
externally; for your light shines before men, that they may see your good
works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven: Blessed are ye supernally,
for God is not ashamed of you to be called your God; for he has prepared for
you a City: Blessed are ye in things temporal, in things spiritual, in things
eternal. In things temporal, read the 28. of Deuteronomy. Blessed shall thou be in
the City, and blessed also in the field, blessed shall be the fruit of thy
body, and the fruit of thy ground, and the fruit of thy cattle, blessed shall
thou be when thou come in, and blessed when thou go out. In things
spiritual; for your understandings shall be illuminated, your wills rectified,
your affections sanctified, your old man mortified, your new man quickened, and
ye wholly made accepted in the beloved. In things eternal; for there is an
inheritance immortal, undefiled, and that fades not away reserved for you in
heaven, where ye shall have joy without sorrow, health without infirmity,
pleasure without satiety, life without death, and indeed I cannot tell you
what, but this I may warrant, all that ye would, and nothing that ye would not,
as appears Psalm. 16.11. In thy presence is the fullness of joy: and Psalm.
17.15. When I awake up after thy likeness I shall be satisfied with it.

Blessed (are) ye in the present Tense (which I add as a vantage to the former
Notes, as being indeed the special of all) even now already ye have obtained
it: Now whiles ye dwell with Mesech, and have your habitation among the tents of
Kedar: now whiles ye live in this vale of tears, in this sea of glass, in this
dungeon of the flesh, now, even now blessed are ye. Blessed are ye in the
unchangable decree of God the Father, who has elected you, in the Incarnation
of God the Son who has redeemed you, in the effectual operation of God the
holy Ghost who has sealed you. Blessed are ye in the knowledge of God, who
has called and justified you, in the knowledge of the Church, who has
received and acknowledged you, in the knowledge of your selves, your own
consciences testifying, together with Gods Spirit bearing witness with your
spirits that ye are the children of God. Blessed are ye: for though ye shall
not take possession of it till your souls be parted from your bodies, Eccl.
12.7. and though ye shall not have the complete perfection of it till your
bodies be raised again, and reunited to your souls, Heb. 11. yet even in this
life ye have the pawn and pledge of it, 2 Cor. 1.22. (Arrham spiritus) the
earnest of the Spirit, a pure heart, and good conscience, and faith unfeigned,
1 Timothy 1.5.

And now concerning the present business, Of the Visitation.
which is the occasion of our meeting, and of my present speaking, I need say
nothing of it; for my Text has said all already: If ye know these things,
blessed are ye if ye do them.

To, or for our quickening to this, or any other duty, what need more be said
then this, that our professed burden of blessedness, our hoped weight of
glory depends equally on our knowing, and doing our duty. Neither can I judge
any of you my hearers to have need of more application of this unto you. This
assembly consists especially of three sorts, Churchwardens, Ministers,
Visiters: And each of these (concerning the business in hand) I hope I need
question no otherwise then Saint Paul questioned Agrippa; Beleevest thou the
Prophets? I know thou beleevest. So I now to you; Are ye prepared and ready to
do your duties? I know ye are prepared.

To the Churchwardens why should I make other question, seeing the business is
not new, but very ancient, and of frequent use, and seeing they are taught
their lesson not by rote, but by book, having Articles to direct them whereof
to consider, and whereto to answer.

To the Ministers why should I make other question, seeing their lips are to be
the preservers of knowledge, Mal. 2.7. and their foreheads the stamps of
holiness, Exodus 28.38. I may say therefore for them, as the parents of the born
blind man answered for their son concerning his blindness and recovery, He
is old enough, ask him, he shall answer for himself, Joh. 9.20. To the Visitors
what need I make other question? seeing they cannot be ignorant that he who
says to them, I have said ye are Gods, adds also immediately, but ye shall
die like men: yea and in another place professes himself to be the Visiter of
Visiters: Namely, that in case of forsaking his Law, and not walking in his
Judgments, he will visit such offenses with the rod, and such sin with
scourges, Psalm. 89.31. What need I then say any more of this business? yet I
remember a passage of Mr. Latimer (that man of the worn-out-age) being
challenged, and taxed for somewhat spoken by him before, and concerning the
King, he answered, Would ye have me preach before a King, and say nothing of a
Kings duty? This made me to think it unfit for me to preach at a Visitation,
and say nothing thereto properly belonging. To avoid this therefore, I offer to
your consideration, and reformation two abuses, which I take to be no small
ones; for they touch our coppyhold (as I may say) or rather our Freehold, the
honor and dignity of our Sacraments.

The first concerns the former Sacrament, Baptism; and namely in this, that
it is grown a common custom to keep children from Baptism till the month be up
for the Mothers churching sake: some for state, some to save charges. But if
the child be dead bom, the parents grieve to look upon it, and speedily
commit it to the earth, and shall not the apprehension of spiritual death be
also grievous, and make us speedily seek the remedy? to bury that death in
Christ's death? Circumcision was a bloody and cruel, a tedious and grievous
Sacrament, as may appear by that forty years forbearing of it for journeying
sake, Josh. 5.6. and by the prevailing of Simeon and Levi, two men (for there
be no more mentioned) to the Massacre of all the Males in a whole City, being
newly circumcised, Genesis 34.25. Yet that Sacrament might not be omitted past the
eighth day. But our Sacraments (as St. Augustine observes, Aug. Ep. 118.) are
numero pancissima, observatione facilima, few, and easy, and shall we presume
then to delay Baptism (which is to us in stead of Circumcision) till the month
be up? The Minister is required to be speedy in ministering it in case of
danger: And does not this also bind the people to shun delay, and to prevent
danger? Yea the Common Prayer book in the beginning of private Baptism
injoyneth, that Baptism be not delayed past the first Sunday or Holy day,
without cause approved by the Curate: And is it not a shame that an abuse
should grow to a custom, which every curate may remedy? When Demetrius called
in question the dishonor of Diana, and the despising of her magnificence (as
he calls it) the multitude made an outcry no less then two hours long, Great
is Diana of the Ephesians, Act. 19.27. And shall we see the dishonor of God,
and the despising of his magnificence and munificence (in that Image which is
not from Jupiter, but of Jehovah) grow into a custom, and shall we keep
silence? Enough of this, for I know to whom I speak.

The other abuse (which I complain of) is to the dishonor of the other
Sacrament. Namely, it is (as it seems) a custom or fashion in these parts, to
bring Joy sops (as they call them) cups of Wire and Sops to the Communion table
at the time of Weddings, and to fill the same table with pots and cakes
immediately after the end of the marriage, that the Bridegroom and Bride and
their company may eat, drink, and be merry: But what has carnal eating and
drinking to do with that table which is provided only for the souls fast?
Yea the Canon forbids any Feasts, banquets, or drinkings to be kept in the
Church, Chapel or Churchyard, much more at the Communion table, except the
Communion feast only proper thereto. Yea in the Common Prayer book the
Communion is appointed to be ministered and celebrated in, or with the Marriage
business, and the Bridegroom and Bride are then also enjoined to receive the
same. It is no good fashion then that Christ's cup should give place, and be
forgotten for Joy sops sake, and that this should come in use instead of that,
is a soul mistake. These abuses I desire may be reformed; yet withal I crave
favor that I may not be in this as an informer to bring any one in question at
this time for any thing past, but that upon this warning there may be future
reformation: wherein if I speed, then I have not said nothing concerning a
Visitation. The rest I leave to God and you, beseeching the Lord so to
enlighten our heads, and sanctify our hearts, and strengthen our hands, that
we may both know and do our duties effectually to the obtaining of everlasting
blessedness thorough Jesus Christ, etc.

Finis Sermon. 3.
Trino-uni gloria.
Three SERMONS here put together in one continued Tract upon Mat. 13.47, 48.
The Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a Net that that was cast into the Sea, and
gathered of every kind, which when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat
down and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.

IT is said of our Savior Rev. 3.7. that he has the key of David, and
opens, and no man shuts, and shuts, and no man opens. And it seems
he did this much (in his time) by Parables: For in them he was most frequent
and familiar, as appears here ver. 34. All these things spoke Jesus unto the
multitude in Parables, and without a Parable spoke he not unto them. And the
end and reason he shows ver. 11. namely, for opening to his disciples, but
for shutting to others: Therefore his Parables are in this Chapter especially
concerning the Kingdom of Heaven.

Now the Kingdom of Heaven is diversely taken; sometimes for the Church
Triumphant, and state of glory, as Mat. 5.20. Except your righteousness exceed
the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, ye cannot enter into the
Kingdom of Heaven. Sometimes for the Church Militant, and state of Grace, as
Mat. 19.14. Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of
such is the Kingdom of Heaven. Sometimes for the gathering of the Church, the
Ministry of the Word, the very Kingdom of the Gospel, as Mat. 21.43. The
Kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation that shall bring
forth the fruits thereof. And so it is in this, and most of the other Parables
of this Chapter: Lutz Har. Evang.
Regnum coelorum in praesenti non significat vitam and faelicitatem beatam, sed
totum mysterium, five negotium Evangelii: The Kingdom of Heaven in this place
does not signify the life of blessedness, but the whole business and mystery
of the Gospel. Theophylact.
Sagena est doctrina piscatorum: The draw-net does signify the Doctrine of
Christ's Fishermen.

Here then we have an excellent description, and expression of the publishing
of the Gospel, the very Ministerial work of Preaching. It is expressed by its
dignity and honor (it is the Kingdom of Heaven.)

2. By its property or effect (it is a draw-net cast into the sea) for so the
word may be read, Sagena a drawnet.

3. By its end, upshot, or issue; it has first its fullness (which when it was
full) and then its trial (they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the
good into vessels, but cast the bad away.

The first part of this description of the Ministerial work is by its honor or
dignity, it is the Kingdom of Heaven: Behold its honor, yea indeed its double
honor. It is a Kingdom, and it is a heavenly Kingdom.

First, it is a Kingdom; For it has been the work of Kings, and it is still a
work that works upon Kings.

It has been the work of Kings; for Melchisedeck a King was also a Priest, and
David a King was also a Prophet, and Solomon a great King affected, and adopted
to himself the name of a Preacher. And it also works upon Kings even to
subdue, and conquer them, and in a sort to depose and put them down; not
temporally from their seats or thrones according to Popish presumption, but
spiritually from their sins, according to Gods ordination: Not peremptorily in
pride commanding (as if a Priest might beard a King) but meekly in reverence
exhorting, as in the message of the King of Kings. And that it has this force
in this nature to subdue Kings, witness the many Kings and Kingdoms that have
been drawn from heathenish superstition to Evangelicall profession by this
silly net of simple Fishermen. All which together do cry the truth of that
which the Prophet spoke concerning the Church Is. 49.23. Kings shall be thy
nursing fathers, and Queens shall be thy nursing mothers: and of that Psalm.
72.11. All Kings shall fall down before him, all nations shall do him service.

Yea not only it has this power in this kind to put down, but also in the
same nature to set up, and make, to invest, and to ordain Kings; I mean
spiritually, to make spiritual Kings: so that by means of this our Ministry,
that also is fulfilled and brought to pass Exodus 19.16. Ye shall be unto me a
kingdom of Priests: and that Rev. 5.10. Thou have made us unto our God Kings
and Priests, and we shall reign on the earth.

This is armor of proof unto the Ministers, and touch of proof unto the people.

It is armor of proof unto the Ministers, to defend them against the piercing
of others obloquie, and against the pinching of their own industry; against
outward shame, against inward pain: For seeing their calling and employment is
so high and excellent, so great and honorable, as not only themselves to be,
but also to make others Kings; and in this sort to depose the spiritual kingdom
of darkness, and to set up the kingdom of grace: what cloud of shame, what storm
of pain can be sufficient to dazzle the light, or to abate the heat of this
sun-shining honor? or with what difficulty objected or conceited may we be
dismayed? seeing God has so honored us, as not only to be his workmen, but
co-workers with him, 2 Cor. 6.1. Yea to stand in his stead, and to act his
part; We are Ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you through us;
we pray you in Christ's stead that ye be reconciled unto God. Yea and has so
far imparted himself unto us, as to affirm, He that hears you, hears me,
and he that despises you despises me, Luke 10.16. This therefore may well be
our sufficit, our sufficient satisfaction against all discomforts, and
discouragements, and make us say, The lot is fallen to me in a fair ground, yea
I have a goodly heritage, Ps. 16.6.

Secondly, it is touch of proof to the people, to tell what metal they are,
whether current or counterfeit: For if they be as they should be, and receive
this work of ours effectually, then they are informed in knowledge, reformed in
wickedness, conformed in holiness, they are strengthened to strive with
nature, and elevated to the strain of grace: They are no more slaves to lust
and pleasure, but even in all tribulation more then conquerors, Romans 8.37. they
beat down their body, and bring it into subjection, 1 Cor. 9.27. They crucify
the flesh, with the affections and lusts, Gal. 5.24. they are born of God, and
do overcome the world, 1 John 5.4. they are made Kings. Yea not only they
shall find this alteration and exaltation in themselves, but we shall also
find a change of their affection and disposition toward us (for it is
unpossible that this great work should be wrought in them, but they must
acknowledge the instruments and workers) their contempt will be turned to
reverence, their neglect to respect, their spite to love, their grudging and
murmuring into freewill offering, liberal contributing: Esteeming us as the
Ministers of Christ, and Stewards of the secrets of God, 1 Co. 1.4.1. Even so
far forth, as not only inwardly to conceive, but even outwardly to express
that acclamation, How beautiful are the feet of them that bring glad tidings
of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things? Romans 10.15.

And so ye see the honor of this work in respect of what it is. A Kingdom.

Secondly, the same also appears in regard of its quality, considering of
what kind it is (an heavenly kingdom.)

It is said to be of heaven for its Kings sake, and for its kinds sake. For its
Kings sake, who only is Christ the Son of God, the heavenly King. This kingdom
has no King but that Caesar who only is semper Augustus, the King of Kings,
and Lord of Lords. And for its kind sake also, being no natural rule, or
temporal regiment, but supernatural and divine. This therefore must needs be
great addition to that former point of honor. It is a kingdom to make men
Kings: It is an heavenly kingdom to make them good Kings, which of all works is
the best and greatest. Man is called a little world, yet the rule of himself is
greater then of the great world; for he that rules his own mind, is better
then he that wins a City, Prove. 16.23. Alezander having subdued the great
world, or at least a great part of the world, where was his honor when he
failed in that little rule of himself? Surely he then being in honor had no
understanding, but might be compared to the beasts that perish. It is therefore
more honor to have our hearts thus crowned spiritually, then to have our heads
invested with a temporal crown, even as much as it is more to be a good man
then a great man, or as the soul is more worth then the body, or the body and
soul more worth then the world, or heaven more worth then the earth. And such
is the nature of this kingdom, so does it inthrone and crown us, spiritually,
not temporally, heavenly not earthly: My kingdom is not of this world (says
our Savior, Joh. 18.36.)

And here both sellers and buyers, both Ministers and receivers, both Priests
and people may see what kind of commodity they have in hand, and learn how to
deal therein. It is a heavenly traffic, they may not be earthly or carnally
minded in it.

The Minister, he may not make merchandise of the Word of God, or at least no
other then free merchandise, as the Prophet Isaiah does, Is. 55.1. Ho every one
that thirsts come ye to the waters; and ye that have no money come buy and
eat: He may not begin it with what shall I give for it, as if the gift of God
might be obtained with money: for that was Simons sin, who thereby showed
himself to be in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquttie, Act.
8.18. Nor yet with what shall I have with it? as if Christ were to be sold at a
price, for that was Judas his sin, who therefore hanged himself, and burst
asunder in the midst, Act. 1.18. Not but that he may rejoice in his labor, and
take his portion, Eccl. 2.24. and 5.17. For that in all degrees is the gift of
God. And in this particular, the labourer is worthy of his hire, Luke 10.7. And
thou shall not muzzle the mouth of the Ox that treads out the corn, 1 Cor.
9.9. but it must be done willingly, and of a ready mind, not for filthy lucre
sake, 1 Pet. 5.2. His work is heavenly, his aim and end likewise must be
heavenly and holy, and void of earthly respect.

The people also must take it as it is a spiritual, not a carnal commodity, and
therefore be contented to be discontented, and pleased to be displeased, and
think it their honor to be dishonored as concerning the flesh and the outward
man, accounting the faithful wounds of a lover better then the pleasant kisses
of an enemy, Prove. 27.6. And Gods precious balms (though they break the head
Ps. 114.5) yet (because they heal as soon as break) more acceptable, more
comfortable, more estimable then the old serpents apples offered from the
forbidden tree, because though they delight the eye, and please the taste, yet
in delighting and pleasing at once they also kill and destroy.

And so much of the first part of the description of the Ministry of the Word,
namely by its dignity, and honor, the Kingdom of Heaven.

The second part or point is its property, practice, or effect: It is a
draw-net cast into the sea, which gathered of every kind.

The sum of all this together is to express it to be a very catching craft,
a very Fishermans work, a catching of men, as Mat. 4.19. Follow me, and I will
make you Fishers of men: of men, that is, of souls: For animus cujusque est
quisque the soul is the man even in heathenish account: And in the Scripture
phrase soul is usually put for person, so many souls for so many persons, Genesis
46.27. Act. 27.37.

But the particulars of this sum may be thus sorted.

1. Its secrecy, simplicity, and unity, in that it is a Net.

2. Its force, and its lenity, in that it is a draw net.

3. Its powerfulness and danger, in that it is cast into the sea.

4. Its general capacity, in that it gathers of every kind.

First, it is a Net, and here is secrecy, simplicity, and unity.

1. Secrecy; for the use of Nets generally is secret, whether it be in
fishing, fowling, or hunting: Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of
any bird, Prove. 1.17. But especially in fishing it is so secret, that the
Fisher himself takes he knows not what, but even what the wind and tide brings
in. Such secrecy is in this spiritual Net of the Gospel: I mean not in secret
laying (for it must be openly spread) but only in regard of secret taking, we
take we know not what: For the Net may be spread in vain, if the fish come not
in; witness St. Peter's lost labor all night, till assaying again at his
command who commands winds, and seas, he enclosed a great multitude, Luke
5.5. Little did St. Peter know what motion drew that shoale of fish into his
Net: No more then the Israelites knew what wind blew that heap of Quails about
their camp: and yet the Text says, There went forth a wind from the Lord, and
brought Quails from the sea, and let them fall by the Camp round about, Number.
11.31* The same Lords holy wind it is likewise that brings fish into our Net:
The wind blows where it lusts, and thou hear the sound thereof, but
can not tell whence it comes, or whither it goes, so is every one that is
born of the spirit, Joh. 3.8.

If then it be thy lot to come within the compass of this Net, though it draw
thee contrary to thy course, and straiten thy desired liberty, yet strive not,
struggle not, snarle not, defile not the Net, bite not the Fisher, but rather
humble thy self under the mighty hand of God, Jam. 5.6. acknowledge the
all-disposer, it is his secret work.

Again, in that it is a Net, here note simplicity: Here are no false enticing
allurements, but plain taking, plain dealing: Hooks are covered, and hid with
bait to allure the fish to be taken, but in Nets there is no baiting, no
coloring, no deceiving; especially in the draw net, no skill but plain
drawing. So is it in this our spiritual Net, no cosening, but a plain cast of
fore-right drawing; no pleasing, but rather displeasing baits: Take up the
cross, Mar. 10.21. Suffer affliction as the good Soldiers of Jesus Christ, 2 Timothy 2.3. Only this is all, it promises safety to the taken, but loss to the
not taken; For whosoever will save his life shall lose it, and he that shall
lose his life for Christ's sake, the same shall save it, Luke 9.24. Look not
then for baits, hearken not for pleasures, this Net does not yield it, here is
no such kind of taking, if thou will be taken, thou must be crossed even to the
full denying of thy self.

And again, in that it is a Net, here note unity. The draw net consists of
many lines, plummets, thrids, knots, yet all make but one Net: Yea so in this
place, it is set forth singularly (a Net) whereas elsewhere there is often
mention made of Nets in discourse of Fishing, or Fishers in the scriptures;
Mending their nets, Mat. 4.21. Washing their nets: Let slip your nets, Luke
5.2, 4. But here it is (a net) expressing unity. Such is our spiritual
Fishing-net, always one, though diversely composed, diversely disposed. One in
respect of the author; These all works one and the self same spirit
distributing to every man severally as he will, 1 Cor. 12.11. One in respect of
the matter; Ye are called in hope of your calling, one hope, one baptisne, Ephesians.
4.4. One in respect of the end; for the gathering together of the Saints, for
the edification of the body of Christ, Ephesians. 4.12.

O then blessed are they that build on Christ, and after his level; for he is
the corner stone, making unity, two walls to be but one, and that is
strengthening, and enlarging; for peace and plenteousnesse go together, Psalm.
122.7. But woe be to them that build Towers of Babel, that is division; for that
also is confusion: Every kingdom divided against it self shall be brought to
naught, Mat. 12.25. And blessed are they who being gathered by this net, are
also united in it: For, the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then
peaceable, Jam. 3.17. But woe be to them that have bodies and souls united in
place and means, but heads, and hearts, and hands divided in life and manners:
For if ye have bitter envyings, and strife in your hearts, rejoice not, neither
be ye liars against the truth, this wisdom descends not from above, but is
earthly, sensual, and devilish, Jam. 3.14. Endeavor therefore to keep the
unity of the spirit in the bond of peace, Ephesians. 4.3. The unity of the spirit,
that is in faith; In the bond of peace, that is in life. Fulfill ye my joy that
ye be like minded, having the same love, being of one accord, and of one
judgment, Phil. 3.1. That ye be like minded, that is for opinion; having the
same love, that is for affection; being of one accord, that is for manners; and
of one judgment, that is for doctrine: For this no doubt is the intent and end
of that prayer of Christ, that they all may be one, as thou, O Father art in
me, and I in thee, that they may be also one in us, Joh. 17.21.

And so much of the particulars observed, in that it is said to be like a Net.

In the second place I observed its force, and lenity, in that it is like to a
draw-net; for so the word is, Sagena, the great net, the drag, tramel, or
draw-net, and the sense implies it: For it is said here to gather, It
gathers of every kind, therefore it is not a net laid to lie still, but such
a one as takes by drawing: Herein therefore I note both force and lenity:
Force, for it draws, there can be no resistance; Lenity, for it but draws,
there is no great violence: Fishes are caught as well with the Angle as with
the Net; but in the Angle there is stronger tugging, suddener hoysing;
therefore the Angle takes but one at once, but the Net goes leisurely, and
gently along, so as the Fish have also their swimming, even in their taking,
and so crescit eundo, it takes whole multitudes at once. So is it in this our
spiritual Net: Here is force; for it is the power of the Word that first
works the will, and then also works upon it: It is he that works both the
will and the deed, Phil. 2.13. It is Gods power that both begins and
continues all our motion in grace; for no man can come to me (says Christ)
except the Father draw him, Joh. 6.44.

And with this force here is also lenity; for this draught is neither violent,
nor sudden.

Not violent, but mild and gentle: My yoke is easy, and my burden is light,
says our Savior, Mat. 11. I drew them with the cords of a man, even with
bands of love, Hos. 11.4. There is indeed constraint; for, whatsoever the Lord
pleases, that does he in heaven, and in earth, in the sea, and in all deep
places, Ps. 135.6. even in the deep of man's heart: But yet withal there is
liberty, even the glorious liberty of the sons of God: even as the fishes are
drawn, but not without their own swimming. Neither is this drawing sudden, but
moderate, and by degrees. Some indeed are (as it were) angled up to heaven even
by sudden motion; effectually called, as Paul from a persecutor to a Preacher,
Act. 9. and the thief from a reviler to a confessor, Mat. 27.44. Luke 23.40.
But this is but by ones, now and then, rare examples. But the more ordinary way
of Gods calling, and taking, is by leisurable knocking; I stand at the door and
knock, Rev. 3.10. Gods Word is likened to an hammer that breaks the stone,
Jer. 23.29. Yet it always breaks not the stony heart at the first blow, but
by degrees; Gutta cavat lapidem non vi, sed saepe cadendo: The drop of rain
holloweth the stone not by force, but by often falling. And so does Christ
usually prevail by his spirit: He shall come down like the rain, even as the
drops that water the earth, Ps. 72.6.

Learn here, first to be humble, to deny natural strength and freedom of
will, and to acknowledge Gods power in drawing thee; The hour comes and now
is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear it
shall live, Joh. 5.25. Thou art but a dead thing till this voice does quicken
thee. St. Paul says in another case, Boast not thy self, and if thou boast,
thou bear not the root, but the root thee Romans 11.18. It may be truly also
said in this case: Boast not thy self, and if thou boast, thou drawest not the
net, but the net thee. It is Christ that makes this beasting, and justly; for
why? we have compelled him (even so to stop our presumption) to take it wholly
off from us: Let him be true therefore, and every man a liar: for thus he
boasts, I when I am lift up from the earth, will draw all men unto me, Joh.
12.32. There Is the primus, and the ultimus motor, the beginner and ender of
this draught, the author and finisher of our faith, Heb. 12.2.

Secondly, learn also here to be careful and diligent, and think not that the
force of this draught does privilege thee to be idle: Thou art drawn indeed by
a superior force, and so, as (like the fish in the net) thou haste thy
swimming, thine own motion: Thou art first dead, but Gods voice shall pierce
thy deadness and make thee hear, and then thou shall not be dead still, but
live, that is, have thy motion. God works thy will indeed, but not to make it
idle, but to set it on work: Work out your own salvation with fear and
trembling, Phil. 2.12. Take therefore the Churches resolution Can. 1.4. Draw
me, and we will run after thee: and that of the Psalmist, I will run the way of
thy Commandments when thou have set my heart at liberty, Psalm. 119.32.

Thirdly, learn here also to be fearful, be not high minded, but fear, Romans
11.20. Blessed is the man that fears always, Prove. 28.14. Thou must not think
thy self to be caught at the first pull; much less may thou presume on thy
taking when thou have yet felt no pulling, or tugging, or drawing at all, but
with much patience thou must endure, and with perseverance expect the
accomplishment of Gods work upon thee: Giving diligence to make thy calling and
election sure, 2 Pet. 1.10. Proving thy self whether thou art in the faith or
no, 2 Cor. 13.5. The sprouting blade of corn upon the house top comes to no
timely harvest, it fills not the mowers hand, nor the binders bosom, Psalm.
129.7. And they that are most rash and sudden in profession, commonly prove to
have no root, and to endure but a season, Mat. 7. For as not every calling to
the Lord-doth make repentance, Not every one that says to me, Lord, Lord,
shall enter into the Kingdom of heaven, Mat. 7. So neither does every calling
from the Lord make faith; Samuel was called the fourth time before he was sped
of his errand, 1 Samuel 3. Yea Judas, after all his illumination proved but a
lost child, Joh. 17.20. Be sober therefore in the beginning, that thou may
hold out unto the ending, and so run that thou may obtain, 1 Cor. 9.24. for
the hasty runner commonly is soonest out of breath. St. John did outrun St.
Peter, and yet went last into the sepulcher, Joh. 20.4. The work of the spirit
by the Ministry of the Word, is no violent, or sudden hoysing (like to Elijahs
whirlwind, 2 King. 2.11.) but a moderate drawing, like to a draw-net.

And so much of the particulars observed, in that it is compared to a draw-net.

3. In the third place I observed painfulness, and danger, in that it is said
to be cast into the sea.

First, painfulnesse: For the word (cast) implies not only the bare casting in
but also the drawing, and the whole managing of the work of Fishing, which is
the main matter of the Fishers labor: For though it costeth him a great deal
of pains to knit his net, and to contrive it in its fashion (for he is no right
Fisherman that cannot knit his own net) yet is it much more pains and labor
to exercise it in the sea, without which all is in vain. And this also is the
main matter of our calling, even this very labor and exercise of spiritual
fishing, I mean the very exercise of Preaching, it is laborious, as well in
practicing, as in preparing: Yea without this, all skill in contriving, all
art, all learning, all knowledge, is all (shall I say) nothing? yea worse then
nothing, instead of honoring us, it will but condemn us: For, not to be able
to labor is miserable, but not to be willing, is punishable; therefore St.
Paul confesses, Necessity is laid upon me, and woe is me if I preach not the
Gospel, 1 Cor. 9.16.

Let no man therefore that undertaketh this Net, think that he takes a
cushion, or couch to sleep on, a soft means of sweet ease, but rather a labor
of little ease, a work that will require the straining of all his strength, the
striving of all his power, even such a burden as St. Bernard says, Ser. 2. de
Asc. Dom. is Angelicis humeris formidandum, too heavy for the Angels shoulders;
and as St. Paul makes question, Who is sufficient for it? 2 Cor. 2.16.
Presbyteri officio perfunctorie acto nihil facilius, sed apud Deum nihil
tristius: recte autem acto, nihil laboriosius, sed apud Deum nihil beatius,
says St. Augustine (August. Valerio Epist. 148.) Nothing is more easy then
the Ministers office if it be slightly handled, but in respect of God nothing
more heavy: and being rightly done, nothing is more laborious, but in Gods
sight nothing more blessed.

And if this were generally well understood, it were unpossible that our
calling should find so much contempt, and our labor so much begrudging of
recompense as commonly it does. Patrons would not give that which is holy unto
dogs, Mat. 7.6. (rob Churches to maintain expenses) Neither would the people
receive holy things as dogs, turning again against the Minister, and all to
renting him in his credit with their tongues, in his profit with their hands,
but rather all injuring would be turned into pitying, if not for our labor
sake, yet for our reckoning sake, for the burden we bear, if not for that
we do discharge.

2. Again, with painfulnesse observe also danger, in that it is said to be like
a Net cast into the sea: For no less danger then labor appears herein: For
the Fisherman though he goes not far to sea, yet goes in great danger, having
but a tottering boat, easy to be overturned with the winds, apt to be filled
with the waves: Besides, even the Fishes themselves many times do endanger him,
when he meets with strong and sturdie ones, Sea Monsters; they tear his net,
and tilt his boat, and take him in stead of being taken by him, and make him a
prey to the prey he seeks. Such is also our condition of danger in our
spiritual fishing: Our Doctrine (which is our boat we fish in) is subject to
contrary winds, so that except we keep very upright, and steer very strait, we
are apt to totter, yea to be tilted over-boord: our boat is also subject to be
annoyed with the waves of our own lusts, the floods of our own concupiscence,
or unclean conversation: For we also are flesh, and many times, though sitting
in Moses chair, and teaching things to be followed, yet do we things as much
to be avoided, and so our ill life pulls down more then our good learning and
labor can build up, which turns to our own danger: Besides, the Fishes
themselves whom we seek to take, often times do en langer us: For it were well
sometimes if we could say with St. Peter, Master, we have labored all night,
and have taken nothing, Luke 5.5. For worse then nothing (too often) we take
carps, mocks, taunts, jestings, deridings. This was Ezekiels lot; My people sit
before thee, and hear thy words, but they will not do them, for with their
mouths they make jests, etc. Eze. 33.31. Yea and sometimes we meet with such
sharks, and sturdy jacks that do strive as much to take us, as we to take them.
This was Christ's own lot (besides many of his followers) who were taken and
destroyed by those whom they labored to take and save. Which may well make us
wary, but not weary in our work: We must be wise as serpents, but innocent as
doves, Mat. 10.6. Thou son of man be not thou rebellions like this rebellious
house: thou son of man fear them not, though briars and thorns be with thee,
and thou doefi dwell among Scorpions. We may not fear them which kill the body,
but we must preach the Word, be instant in season, and out of season, improve,
rebuke, exhort, with all long suffering, 2 Timothy 4.2. Yea rather this may
comfort us, and bring shame and fear upon the world, that yields such
Monsters. If ye were of the world, the world would love his own, but because ye
are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the
world hates you, Joh. 15.9. How long may we labor before we take such a fish
as St. Peter's was? one that has money in his mouth ready to discharge our
debt, Joh. 15.4. or such a one as Tobias was? one that comes up voluntarily,
and offers himself to be taken, yea yields his heart and liver to be broyled on
the coals of zeal, as an incense for us; yea his very gall to be medicinable
unto us, Tob. 6. Or such a one as Jonahs was? one that is ready (when storm and
tempest is upon us) to receive us, and that not on his back (as Arions Dolphin
in the Fiction) but in his very bowels to bear us safe to land, and to set us
on safe ground, Jon. 1. No, no, the world is a sea, and worldlings are great
Leviathans taking their pastime in spoiling: But the Lord shall punish such
Leviathans with his sore, and great, and strong sword, Is. 27.1. And smite the
heads of them in pieces, Psalm. 74.15. Yea there is another deeper sea, that is
hell, and another greater Leviathan, that is the Devil, of whom all devourers
may justly fear to be devoured: For we to thee that spoylest, when thou shall
cease to spoil, thou shall be spoiled, Is. 33.1. But as for us, if we be not
weary of well doing, in due time we shall reap if we faint not, Gal. 6.9. And
when the chief Shepherd shall appear, we shall receive an incorruptible crown
of glory, 1 Pet. 5.4.

And so much of the particulars observed in the word (cast into the sea.)

4. In the fourth place I observed the general capacity of this Net, in that
it is said to gather of every kind.

There is ready reason of the name or title (Catholic) given to the Church. It
signifies general, or universal: And so the Church is, not only in respect
of time, having its beginning continual from the beginning, but also in respect
of place (for Christ says, the Gospel shall be preached throughout the world,
Mat. 24.) and in respect of persons; for he bids his Disciples Go preach the
Gospel to every creature, Mar. 16.15. To every creature? This speech seems so
Catholic as to include all things: No, the sense cannot bear it: For it were
in vain that any creature should have it that is not capable of it. To every
creature then must go with this limitation, namely, to whom it shall belong,
and be available. And who is that? Only mankind: For the reasonless and
senseless creatures cannot partake of it: And for other reasonable creatures
besides man there are none but Angels, and to some of them it is needless,
they being already confirmed not only in grace but in glory (the elect Angels,
1 Timothy 5.21.) And to the other some it is speedlesse, they being reprobated in
sin and judgment, Irreparabiliter (as St. Bernard.) Reserved in everlasting
chains under darkness, unto the judgment of the great day, as St. Jude
speaks, Jude 6.

To every creature then must needs be only to every of Mankind, who indeed is
every creature, both in respect of kind, and in respect of end. In respect of
kind: for he is instar omnium, as having the kind of every thing in himself: He
has the being of lifelesse things, the growing of vegetables, the sense of
animals, the reason of Angels, and is therefore not unfitly called (...) a
little World, as having in him the Idea or model of the great World.

And as in kind so likewise in end man is every creature: For every creature
has his end of being (in some sort) in man. Not only in subordination and
subjection (thou have put all things under his feet, all sheep and oxen, and
the beasts of the field, Ps. 8.) Yea though he were made a little lower then
the Angels, yet in this union with the Son of God, and in the person of Christ
he is exalted far above all principalities and powers, and might, and
domination, Ephesians. 1.21. but also in obedience and service, use and ministry; all
things have their end of being in man: For the Sun is to rule the day, and the
Moon and the Stars to govern the night, Psalm. 116. And to be for signs and
seasons, and for days and years. What is this but to man's use and service? yea
the Angels are all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for their sakes
that shall be heirs of salvation, Heb. 1.14.

And shall I speak it? has every creature only its end of being in man? May
it not be said that it has also its end of well-being in some sort included
and employed, though not concluded and determined in man? For it seems their
perfection depends on ours: For our fall was their fall; Cursed is the earth
for thy sake, says God to Adam, Genesis 3. And our recovery is also theirs; For
the fervent desire of the creature waits when the sons of God shall be
revealed -- Because the creature shall be delivered from the bondage of
corruption into the glorious liberty of the sons of God; for we know that every
creature groaneth with us also, and travelleth in pain together unto this
present, Romans 8. Yea the very Angels perfection (though it be not I say
concluded in us) yet it seems much to depend upon us: for both by our
conversion their joy is enlarged (there is joy in the presence of the Angels
for one sinner that converteth, Luke 15.10.) and also by our Ministry and
Preaching their knowledge is perfected; for now unto principalities and powers
in heavenly places is made known by the Church the manifold wisdom of God, Ephesians.
3.10. And the things which are showed by our preaching the Angels desire to
behold, 1 Pet. 1.12.

O honorable excellency of mankind! (let me digress a little that I may
admire it.) Man is every creature, all were created for him, all are included
in him, all are restored with him, all are perfected through him, yea and
(above all) all are reconciled by him; for it pleased God by him (even by that
man Christ) to reconcile all things to himself, Col. 1.20. and to gather
together in one all things both which are in heaven, and which are in earth,
even in Christ, Ephesians. 1.10. Where then is our holy ambition answerable to this
excellency? why is not all carnal, and earthly pride swallowed up in this
which is so divine and heavenly? why do we not endeavor to walk worthy of
this high calling, possessing our vessel in holiness and honor? And seeing
God shuts up all in us, making us the only fish of his net, the only mark
whereto all his works of power, and mercy are tended and bended, that we may be
all in all to him, why do we not likewise shut up all in him, and make him the
only object of all our desires, and hopes, that he may be all in all to us,
even that God may be all in all? To every creature; then I say must needs be to
every of Mankind. But how then shall that other charge be taken, Go not into
the way of the Gentiles, and into the Cities of the Samaritanes enter ye not,
Mat. 10.5. That charge was given in and for the time of the Jews, while their
Synagogues stood firmly founded on Moses ceremonies: For Christ was a Minister
of the Circumcision, to confirm the promises made unto the Fathers, Romans 15.8.
His time was not yet come to be published to the Gentiles: Therefore to
fulfill, and to hasten his work, he confineth himself and his to the Jewish
Church: But when (by the consummatum est) the foundation of Ceremonies was
razed, then the partition wall was broken down, the vail of the Temple did
rent, all separation was removed, and then was this charge given, Go preach the
Gospel to every creature: and then also was the Holy Ghost given in such plenty
and variety, as might suffice unto the fulfilling hereof, Act. 2. We see then
that though the Jewish privilege was great, yet it had an end, it was cut off
at last: Which may well check them that boast of infallibility, and perpetuity,
and may well warn all to beware of hardness and obstinacy: For (it is St.
Paul's warning) through unbelief they are broken off, through faith thou
stand: be not high minded but fear; for if God spared not the natural
branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee, Romans 11 20.

Well then be it so: To every creature; that is, to every of Mankind, according
to my Text, It gathers of every kind. Here is the general capacity of this
Net: Here is no sex, age, state, condition or nation excepted or excluded, but
all is fish that comes to this Net; it draws all that it reaches, it
gathers of every kind: For of a truth (says St. Peter, Act. 10.34.) I
perceive that God is no accepter of persons, but in every nation he that
fears him, and works righteousness is accepted with him.

And if God make no difference of us, why do we make difference one of
another? or any one of himself? One of another in proud disdain, or partial
estimation? Having the faith of our glorious Lord Jesus Christ in respect of
persons, having respect to them that wear gay clothing, being partial in our
selves, and judges of evil thoughts: Hearken my beloved brethren, has not God
chosen the poor of this world that they should be rich in faith, and heirs of
the kingdom which he promised to them that love him? but ye have despised the
poor: so speaks St. James (Jam. 2.) upbraiding our uncharitableness, as if
therein we did (...) fight against God, opposing his will, and frustrating his
ordinance.

And why does any one make difference of himself as if he did not belong to
this Net, nor it unto him? Is it because of thy meannesse and poverty? why? the
Gospel is preached unto the poor, Mat. 11.5. The meashes of this Net are not
knit so wide, as to let the small fry go, but it holds and draws all; It
gathers of every kind.

Or is it because of thy greatness, thou think to escape this Net? Why? it
is not made of cobwebs, to catch small flies only, but rather of iron, to hold
the strongest, to bind their Kings in chains, and their Nobles with links of
iron, Psalm. 149.8.

Or is it because of thy great wisdom and learning that thou think thou
have no need of this net? why? It is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the
wise, and will cast away the understanding of the prudent: where is the wise,
where is the scribe, where is the disputer of the world? has not God made the
wisdom of the world foolishness? 1 Cor. 1.19.

Let every one therefore submit himself to this easy yoke, and yield to this
drawing net, lest he hear Christ complaining and threatening against him all at
once: How often would I have gathered thee as the hen gathers her chickens
under her wings, and ye would not, behold your habitation shall be left unto
you desolate, Mat. 23.37.

But it seems this generality of gathering, and drawing is specially here
intended to this, that it gathers as well the bad as the good: For this
Parable agrees well with the other before of the tares and the wheat: for in
both is showed the joynt-tenancy of good and bad in the Church until the day
of separation.

They therefore that will have a pure Church without any spots, do make
themselves wiser then God: They that will have all wickedness presently judged,
do make themselves juster then God: they that will abide no ill company in the
use of holy things, do make themselves holyer then God. In a word, this secret
will and work of God may indeed teach us not only warynesse in our life, to
walk wisely, and to beware of men, Col. 4.5. Mat. 10.17. but also weariness
of our life, to say, Woe is me that I am constrained to dwell with Mesech, and to
have my habitation among the tents of Kedar, Psalm. 120.5. Yea, and that not
without some vexation: (For just Lot was vexed with the uncleanly conversation
of the wicked, 2 Pet. 2.7.) Yet so, as with all meekness to abide Gods
pleasure, and to stay his leisure; for he has appointed a day in which he will
judge the world in righteousness, Act. 17.31. Be patient therefore brethren
unto the coming of the Lord, Jam. 5.7.

And so much of the second general part of the Text, viz. the property of the
Church Ministry; It is like a draw-net which was cast into the sea, and
gathered of every kind.

The third and last general part is its end or upshot; In which I have noted
its fullness (which when it was full) and its trial (they gathered the good
into vessels, but cast the bad away.)

First for its fullness: which when it was full they drew to shore. God, who in
himself is infinite, has set a date and stint upon all his Works; a date of
time, a stint of measure; their bounds which they shall not pass: Thou have
ordered all things in measure, number, and weight, Wisd. 11.17. Yea because
himself is infinite, therefore indeed every thing else needs be finite; for
there can be but one true infinitum in rerum natura. And though he will have
this work of this draw net especially above others to be constant, and
continual, yet it has its fullness, which when it was full.

Conclude then, that all things have their end, and their end for ever
determined with God.

First, all things have their end, yet not one and the same end, but diversely:
There is an end corruptionis, of corruption, which belongs to the bodies of
men, and of all mixed creatures; When thou hidest thy face they are troubled,
when thou take away their breath, they die, and are turned again to their
dnst, Ps. 104.29. There is an end perfectionis, of perfection, which belongs
to the souls of the Elect; Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation
of your souls, 1 Pet. 1.9. There is an end destructionis, of destruction, which
belongs to the reprobates, whose end is damnation, Phil. 3.19. And there is
an end consummationis, of consummation, which belongs to all the works of God
and man: I see that all things come to an end, Psalm. 119.96. And this is that
which my Text speaks of: Sic erit in consummatione seculi, So it shall be in
the end of the world, ver. 49.

Well then be it so, even as indeed it is, yea as it must be, so let it be, let
every thing have its end: Let every thing have its end as well in and to thee,
as in, and to its self: In thy intention, in thy application, in thy
estimation, in their preparation let all things have their end.

1. In thy Intention, do nothing without an end, bethink, forecast, plot, and
propose the end of what thou do before thou begin it, take nothing in hand
without a right end intended: Whatsoever thou take in hand remember the end,
and thou shall never do amiss, Eccl. 7.36. Otherwise in your best works, even
in your holy meetings, ye may be like those of Ephesus, The assembly was
confused, and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together, Act.
19.32. Or like him who (for want of forecast of the end) subjected himself unto
a mock; This man began to build, and was not able to make an end, Luke 14.30.

2. In thy Application: Let nothing bt done in vain unto thee: all Gods works
of Mercy and Judgment done unto thee, or before thee, let all have a right end
in thee. Rob not God of his glory, thy self of thy comfort, thy neighbor of
his benefit in any thing: For Natura nihil facit frustra, Nature (and much more
the God of Nature) does nothing in vain: God has his end in every thing,
therefore receive not the grace of God in vain, in what kind soever it comes,
but make some good use of every thing: So (and not else) shall thou attain to
David's gladness: Thou Lord have made me glad through thy works, and I will
rejoice in giving praise for the operations of thy hands, Ps. 92.4.

3. In thy Estimation: Deceive not thy self in valuing the things of this world
as lasting things to build thy joy and comfort on as they do that think their
houses shall continue for ever, and call their lands after their own names,
Psalm. 49.12. but esteem them as they are mutable and uncertain, vain, ane
transitory, subject to end; for the fashion of this world goes away, 1 Cor.
7.31. Therefore let us take heed of abusing it, that so (rightly seeing, and
acknowledging the momentany nature of these ending things) we may be lifted up
to the excellency of that eternal weight of glory: and have our conversation in
heaven: Looking (with Abraham, Heb. 11.10.) for a City, having a foundation,
even a firm foundation, Immortal, undefiled, and that fades not away, 1 Pet.
1.4.

4. In thy preparation; be thou prepared for thine own end, because (in that)
all things of this world are ended to thee; for when thou art gone, all is
gone: Thou fool, this night will they take away thy soul from thee, then whose
shall those things be which thou have provided, Luke 12.20. Be thou therefore
crucified to the world, and the world to thee. Crucified? not nailed, and
firmly fixed to it, that thou can not leave it, but dead unto it in regard of
thy willingness to leave it; that so being always in a readiness, and like a
diligent servant waiting for his master, thou may say with the Apostle, I dye
daily; yea I desire to be dissolved, and to be with Christ.

Again, as all things have an end, so an end for ever determined with God.
Determined; for this work of the draw-net has its fullness ( When the fullness
of the Gentiles shall come in, Romans 11.25.) For ever determined: Known unto God
are all his works from the beginning, Act. 15.18. For God sees not as man
sees, by succession of time, and by uncertain change ( with him is no
variableness, Jam. 1.17.) but he is I am, Exodus 3. Having all time for ever
present, and by one eternal act, seeing, and disposing all things: He has
chosen us before the foundation of the world, Ephesians. 1.4. Why then do the heathen
rage, and the people imagine a vain thing? Why do any grudge, or murmar, or
complain against God for his works? for his calling of some, and rejecting
others; for judging some, and sparing others; for crossing some, and prospering
others? Is it not lawful for him to do as him lists with his own goods? Is
thine eye evil, because he is good? Has not the Potter power over the same
clay to make one vessel unto honor, and another unto dishonor? Shall the
thing formed say to him that formed it, why have thou made me thus? No, but
rather cry out as Romans 11.33. O the deepness of the riches both of the wisdom,
and knowledge of God, how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past
finding out!

Or why is any man impatient in his own sufferings, or afflictions: Shall there
be evil in the City (that is, evil of affliction) and the Lord has not done
it? Am. 3.6. I form the light, and create darkness, I make peace, and create
evil, I the Lord do all these things, Is. 45.7. Cannot a sparrow light on the
ground without God? And do thou think that any thing that belongs unto
thee (thy life, thy health, thy wealth, thy credit) can fall to the ground
without God? Are not the hairs of our head all numbered? and are we not of more
value then many sparrows? And if it be Gods wisdom and providence that
disposes of every thing, why then art thou grieved at any thing? He may do
what he will in respect of his power: Whatsoever the Lord pleased that did he,
Psalm. 135.6. He will do nothing for thy hurt in respect of his love: We know
that all things work together for the best to them that love God, even to them
that are called of his purpose, Romans 8.28. Say therefore with comfort in all
things, thy will be done, as well in regard of thy sufferings as of thy doings:
Whether the Lords immediate hand be upon thee, say with David, I became dumb,
and opened not my mouth, for it was thy doing, Ps. 39.10. Or whether he make
some limb of the Devil his instrument, say also with David, Suffer him to
curse, for the Lord has bidden him, 2 Samuel 16.11. Or whether he let loose
Satan himself as his executioner upon thee, say (as in such case Job did) The
Lord gives, and the Lord takes, blessed be the name of the Lord: Yea
howsoever thou art crossed or afflicted, let Eli's words be ready in thy mouth,
It is the Lord, let him do whatsoever seems him good, 1 Samuel 3.18.

Yea, why are we not also far from grudging against God in our own, or others
behalf, as rather ready to give him praise and thanks in all things: Praise,
else we be worse then all creatures: Thanks, else we be no better then all:
for, All thy works praise thee, O God, and thy Saints give thanks unto thee,
Ps. 145.10. All praise him in their being, we should thank him in our speaking:
For he that is Lord over all, is rich unto all, Romans 10.12. He has made all
things beautiful in their time, Eccl. 3.11. In wisdom has he made them all,
the earth is full of his riches, Psalm. 104.24. O that men would therefore
praise the Lord for his goodness, and declare the wonders that he does for the
children of men, that they would offer unto him the sacrifices of thanksgiving,
and tell out his works with gladness Ps. 107.21.

And so much of its fullness: Which when it was full.

The other point (which is the last of all) observed in the end or upshot of
this spiritual Net, is its trial, or examination; They drew it to land, and
sat down, and gathered the good into, etc.

When the fullness of Gods time is come that this work shall cease, it shall
have its trial as well as its end. Its trial doubly; in it self as well as in
its effects, the work as well as the things wrought, the net as well as the
draught, the fishers as well the fishes: For not only in general it is said,
Every man shall be judged according to his works, Rev. 20.13. but of his works
also in particular, Every man's work shall be made manifest, for the day shall
declare it, 1 Cor. 3.13. And we watch for your souls as they that must give
account, Heb. 13.17.

Which may well unite both Ministers and people here in affection, seeing they
shall be so united there in condition. And may well take away all strife and
contention, all judging, and censuring, all scorn and envying from among them:
Why do thou judge thy brother? or why do thou despise thy brother, for we
must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, Romans 14.10.

But to the purpose; this trial and examination, here is expressed by way of
separation, and three things herein are set forth.

1. Who shall be separated.

2. By whom.

3. To what.

First, who shall be parted: It is plain here, the good and the bad; and
before, ver. 30. the tares and the wheat, and chap. 25.23. the sheep and the
goats: for there shall enter there no unclean thing, neither whatsoever works
abomination, or lies, but they which are written in the lambs book of life,
Rev. 21.27. for without shall be dogs and enchanters, and whoremongers, and
murderers, and idolaters, or whosoever loves, or makes a lie, Rev. 22.15.

This is a terror not only to all Gods open Enemies, but to all his feigned
friends and false servants: Many under the vail of profession abuse Religion:
But what though God endure their mockery, and suffer them to profane his
mysteries for a while, the time will come when he will make a separation of
them, and make them known as they are. They are taken here for good men, but
there they shall be taken from good men: For God will lighten things hid in
darkness, and make the counsels of the heart manifest, 1 Cor. 4.5.

Christ discovered one traitor in this world by giving him a sop; but God
usually covers rather then discovers hypocrites, by giving them sops of
spiritual, as well as of temporal blessings; but though he feed them with the
childrens bread for a while, yet he cuts them off at the last, and gives them
their portion with hypocrites; yea, the devil, who helps to hide them here,
will do his best to open them there; for though he be the father of falsehood,
yet he differs from false men in this: they keep light and counterfeit pieces
to shuffle them in, in great payments. But he, though he falsify Gods coin
here in the particulars as much as may be, yet in that great and general Audit,
he will not have one counterfeit go undiscovered: And if he would, he could
not; for all the covering wherewith he clotheth them will not hide them: For
many (says Christ) will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have not we by thy
name prophesied, and by thy name cast out devils, and by thy name done many
great works: And then will I profess to them, saying, I never knew you, depart
from me, ye that work iniquity, Mat. 7.22. Therefore, whiles we have time let
us do good: Let us be good; for as that time finds us, so it will take us: If
it find us not good, it will not make us good. Now is the time of growing; to
day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts: then will be the time of
gathering ( And gathered the good into vessels, etc.)

2. The second thing observed in this separation was, By whom it is: That is
expressed in the exposition of this Parable, namely, that it is the Angels,
ver. 49. The Angels shall go forth and sever the bad from among the just: So
before ver. 39. in the Parable of the tares, the Reapers be the Angels, The son
of man shall send forth his Angels, etc. And so Mat. 24.31. He shall send his
Angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his
Elect from the four winds, and from the one end of heaven to the other. And no
marvail that they have the gathering of us at the last, who have the guarding
of us at the first: For that charge (no doubt) concerns not only Christ, but
all that are in Christ, He shall give his Angels charge over thee, Ps. 91.11.
And that not only in our life, but in our death. In our life; for, the Angel of
the Lord tarrieth round about them that fear him, and delivers them, Psalm.
34.7. whereof we have many examples in the Scriptures. In our death; for
Lazarus his lot (I doubt not) shall be the lot of all the faithful, his soul
was carried by the Angels into Abraham's bosom, Luke 16.22. Which excellency of
power, and exactness of knowledge in their so general guarding here, and
gathering there the elect of God, though it does not express any such
infiniteness in the Angels as to make us worship them; for I doubt not this so
absolute knowledge is not theirs properly, and always by creation, but
received for the present by special illumination: For I read, The Lord knows
who are his, 2 Timothy 2.19. but I read not that any Angel knows who are his:
Yet the consideration of this their general Ministry yields us a great deal
of fear, and a great deal of comfort.

A great deal of fear in our conversation, considering their watchfulness over
us, and their frequent presence: for what fear, and shame, what reverence and
holiness, what purity and cleanness may be sufficient for us in the presence of
such holy, blessed, and glorious creatures? For if St. Paul propose a rule of
modesty to women because of the Angels, 1 Cor. 11.10. why should not the same
rule hold to all upon the same reason, even because of the Angels. It may be
they come to guard and defend us, as they did unto Elisha, 2 King. 6.16. It may
be to converse with us, as unto Abraham, Genesis 18.2. It may be to pluck us out
of some ill company, as unto Lot, Genesis 19.15. It may be to rid ue of some
captivity, as to the Apostles, Act. 5.19. It may be to try or to exercise our
strength, as to Jacob, Genesis 22. It may be to bring us some good news, as to
Zacharias, to the Virgin Mary, to the Shepherds: Howsoever, seeing they are
ministering spirits, and have frequent commerce with us, let us fear always to
commit uncleanness that may annoy them, and seeing God thus gives us heaven
upon earth in regard of the Angels ministering, let us so pass the time of our
dwelling here in fear, that we may also on our parts make heaven upon earth by
our holy conversing.

Again, without fear, here is also a great deal of comfort offered us, in that
the Angels are our continual guardians: for though the great dragon, the old
serpent the devil be come down upon the earth, and has great wrath, Rev. 12.
and walks about as a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour, 1 Pet. 5.8. And
has many Angels of his own kind, and instruments of our kind to annoy and vex
us, yet what of that? This is Gods host, says Jacob, when he saw the good
Angels, Genesis 32.2. And if Gods host and strength be with us, no strength shall
be able to hurt us: Therefore let nothing in all our life terrify us, no nor
yet in our death: For Gods Angels are ready, not only to conveigh our souls to
heaven, but even to conduct our bodies to the earth, as appears in that Moses
body was defended and protected against the devil by the striving of Michael
the Archangel, Jude 9. Yea, as they guard us to our lying down in the grave, so
will they gather us at our rising up from thence, and therefore against the
fear of death, and the grave, and the corruption thereof, we may say with
comfort, I will lay me down in peace, and take my rest, for it is thou Lord
only that make me dwell in safety, Ps. 4.8.

3. The third and last thing observed in this separation, is to what end it is:
And gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.

Here is a plain difference, and dissimilitude (as in most Allegories commonly
there is) for the casting away of the refuse fish into the sea again, is their
desired life and safety; and the gathering of the good fish into vessels is
their death and destruction: Yet contrariwise the bad fish cast away do here
signify the reprobate condemned, and the good fish gathered do signify the
elect saved: And gathered the good into vessels, that is, to good use and
purpose, to be reserved and saved; as before in the Parable of the Tares, Gather
my wheat into my barn, but cast the bad away, that is, to utter destruction and
condemnation, as it follows in the exposition, And shall cast them into a
furnace of fire. Briefly the sum is, that here are two several ends proposed,
and answerable to the twofold condition of the subjects; the one of safety (and
gathered the good into vessels) that is, into everlasting habitations, as
Christ speaks Luke 16.9. the other of destruction (but cast the bad away)
that is, into everlasting condemnation, into the furnace of fire, as the
exposition shows.

Of which two estates or ends how shall I speak, seeing I cannot understand?
how shall I utter that I cannot comprehend? for the eye has not seen, nor the
ear heard, neither has it entered into the heart of man that which God has
prepared for them that love him: and consequently, neither that which he has
prepared for them that hate him: For (which may somewhat save my labor) the
greatness of the one sets forth the greatness of the other: the one is the
fullness of joy, therefore the other must needs be the fullness of woe; the one is
the enjoying of all things in the enjoying God, the other is the losing of all
things in the losing God; the one is everlasting life, that is perfection of
excellency, the other is everlasting death, that is perfection of misery: yea,
the happiness is double considering the escape of misery, and the punishment is
double considering the loss of felicity.

And what then? is there any need of use or application of this to be made unto
you? will ye look for my sparing it? has it not life enough to speak it self?
will ye expect my pressing it? is not the weight of it sufficient to press and
oppress your consciences? When Paul disputed of judgment to come, it made
Felix (an Infidel) to tremble, so that he could not endure the hearing of it;
and shall not all Christian hearts shake and tremble, and be astonished at the
very thought of it? If you will have any use or instruction of it, take it of
St. Peter, The day of the Lord shall come as a thief in the night, in which the
heavens shall pass away with a noise, and the elements shall melt with heat,
and the earth with the works that are therein shall be burnt up. Seeing
therefore that all these things must be dissolved, what manner of persons ought
ye to be in holy conversation and godliness, looking for, and hasting unto the
coming of the day of God, by the which the heavens being on fire shall be
dissolved, and the elements shall melt with heat: Wherefore beloved, seeing
that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace
without spot and blameless, 2 Pet. 3.10. He speaks by way of exhortation, but
the wise man speaks by way of threatening, Rejoice, O young man in thy youth,
and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways
of thy heart, and in the sight of thine eyes, but know that for all these
things God will bring thee to judgment, Eccl. 11.9. As if he would (as it
were) dare any man to fin, having but the remembrance of this judgment before
him. Wherefore let us not dare to heap up wrath against the day of wrath, but
walk circumspectly, not as unwise men, but as wise, redeeming the time, because
these days are evil, especially because that day is so evil: And so abide in
him here, by true faith, and the fruits thereof, love and fear, that when he
shall appear, we may be bold, and not be ashamed before him at his coming;
which the Lord grant to us all, etc.

Finis Sermon. sive tract. 4.
Trino-uni gloria.
TWO SERMONS preached at the Feast of the Nativitie of CHRIST, and here set
forth in one continued tract.
Text. JOH. 1.16. And of his fullness have all we received grace for grace.


THis time is a special time of Grace, both exhibited and returned: Of Grace
exhibited, from God to man, in, and through Christ: Of Grace returned, from man
to God in piety, from man to man in charity; from man to God in piety;
sanctifying days to Gods public service, in hearing, praying, communicating;
from man to man in charity, alms to the poor, inviting neighbors, visiting
friends, hospitality to all.

And well do we apply our selves to the practice and exercise of these two
special duties, for this special time and business sake, this solemnizing,
and celebrating of the coming of Christ: For these, Piety and Charity are twins
of the Holy Ghost, never begotten one without the other: for true faith works
by love, Gal. 5.6. And true love must be with faith unfeigned, 1 Timothy 1.5.

What then? It is right and fit that we present him with this joint issue of
the spirit, from whom jointly with the Father the spirit proceeds, and upon
us descended; that he should be honored by the effects and works of the
spirit, by, and from whom we receive the gift of the spirit: When the comforter
is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the spirit of truth,
Joh. 15.26.

Again, Piety and Charity are the two feet of the soul, whereon it stands,
wherewith it walks; though feet of different nature, and diverse quality,
even like those feet of Nebuchadnezars Image Dan. 2.33. part of iron, part of
clay; part of iron, strong to Godward in the duties of the first Table (so is
Piety) part of clay, pliable to man in the duties of the second Table (so is
Charity) What then? we can do no less then extend these footsteps in both
kinds, whiles we intend the meeting, or entertaining of him that comes in both
kinds: We necessarily express our right respect at once to both natures for the
honor of him who comes at once in both natures in one person to visit us; for
in him God was manifested in the flesh, 1 Timothy 3.16.

Again, Piety and Charity are the two hands of the soul: by the hands the body
holds, by these the soul holds. For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision
avails any thing, nor uncircumcision, but faith that works by love, Gal.
5.6. And these are well like the Spiders hands mentioned, Prove. 30.28. For
though they work weakly, yet are they so ambitious as to take hold in the Kings
Palace, yea even in the Palace of the King of Kings. What then? Now especially
is it convenient for us to stretch forth these hands, and to exercise this hold
in the heavenly palace, because the heavenly King (to fetch us thither)
vouchsafes to descend, not to a palace, but to a vile place, his humiliation
opportuneth, importuneth our exaltation, our exultation: For, Behold (says the
Angels to the shepherds, Luke 2.) I bring you glad tidings of great joy which
shall be to all people, that is, that unto you is born this day in the City of
David a Savior, which is Christ the Lord.

Again, Piety and Charity are the two wings of the soul, whereon it mounteth
even as high as heaven: For though worldly men mind earthly things, yet our
conversation is in heaven, Phil. 3.19. And though so long as we lie among the
pots, and dwell in houses of clay, these wings want not earthly pollution, yet
when our earthly house of this tabernacle shall be dissolved, then they shall
be argent, Or, lux oriens, Perer. in Genesis 1.3.
yea orient, full of luster and splendour, even as the wings of a dove which is
covered with silver wings, and her feathers like gold, Psalm. 68. In the
expectation whereof David (as rapt and ravished) cries out, Psalm. 55.6. O that
I had wings like a dove, for then would I flee away and be at rest. What then?
Very seasonably and conveniently do we now clap both these wings together,
that so with all the flock of innocent doves; with all the Elect, which from
all quarters fly unto Christ, as the doves unto their windows, Is. 60.8. we may
address our selves to make one flight in the meeting, and congratulating of
our Savior, for as much as our true Dove (the holy Ghost who is not only the
leader, but the breeder of all this brood) has descended and lighted upon his
head, giving us therein our true aim and mark to what rock we should repair; Lo
the heavens were opened unto him and John saw the Spirit of God descending like
a dove, and lighting upon him, Mat. 3.16.

In a word, Piety and Charity is the sum of our obedience, the total of the
Law, Thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy
soul, and with all thy mind, this is the first and great commandment, and the
second is like unto it, thou shall love thy neighbor as thy self, on these two
Commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets, Mat. 22.37. Well and wisely
therefore do we now present him with this sum of our obedience during our
celebration of his first coming, that so he may make up our account, and
perfect our reckoning by bringing us a quietus est ready drawn at his second
coming: For in him indeed, the sum of our righteousness, and the total of our
obedience consists: For Christ is the end of the Law for righteousness to
every one that believes, Romans 10.4. Yea, this is the name whereby we are
taught to call him, the Lord our righteousness, Jer. 23.6.

Wherefore that these duties now so solemnly pretended may be rightly, and
truly, that is understandingly, and conscionably, with the head, and with the
heart intended and attended, and so both the receipt and the return of those
graces may truly appear in us, I have chosen this Text, which shows the
Fountain, the Stream, and the Banks of Grace: From whence, and how, and in what
measure Grace does flow.

1. The Fountain (of his fullness.)

2. The Stream (have all we received.)

3. The Banks (and grace for grace.) that so, being known how, and whence it
comes, it may be rightly received (namely, with joyfulnesse, and
thankfulness) and rightly returned (namely) with humbleness and holiness.

1. Part. The Fountain is this, Of his fullness.

It is our Savior Christ, the Son of God, the Son of Man, God and Man, the
Redeemer of Man who is here spoken of, as plainly appears in all the
foregoing narration of the Evangelist: In the beginning was the Word, and the
Word was with God, etc. Of his fullness have we all received.

Of his fullness.
This Text suteth very well and agrees with other answerable Scriptures which
do set forth the gifts of Grace, the effects of the Spirit by the emblem or
instance of water, which we find very frequent and common: and no marvel, the
comparison being very right and proper, very emphaticall and significant: For,

1. Water never (naturally) ascends, but descends, and Grace proceeds not
from Man to God, but from God to Man: Every good and perfect gift is from
above, and comes down from the father of lights, Jam. 1.17.

2. Water fills the lowly valleys, so Grace replenisheth humble minds: For,
God resists the proud, and gives grace to the humble, Jam. 4.6.

3. Water purifieth, and multiplieth, or increases by running, but putrifyeth,
and decreaseth by settling: And Grace by diligence is improved, but by
negligence impaired: Thou evil and slothful servant, thou ought to have
put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received
mine own with vantage, or usury, Mat. 25.27. Therefore the water of life that
Christ gives, is said to be springing, not settling, Joh. 4.14. A Well of water
springing up unto everlasting life. And the waters that came from under the
Temple, Ezekiel. 47.1. were first to the ankles, then to the knees, then to the
loins, and became a River that no man might pass over.

Many more particulars of resemblance might be instanced in this Allegory, but
this one may go for all, as being indeed, Instar omnium, the sum of all: Namely,

Water washes, and cleanses the filth of the body, and so Grace cleanses and
purges the filth of the soul: Wash me thoroughly from my wickedness, and
cleanse me from my sin, purge me with hysop, and I shall be clean, wash me, and
I shall be whiter then snow, Psalm. 51.

Let us then make some application of this to our selves, that we may not pass
it without some benefit. And to that purpose let us apply it by way of trial,
making the trial to be of the cause by the effect, of our washing by our
cleansing: Whether we have received or not received; or at least whether we
have in vain received the Grace of God or no? For indeed that we have received
it, we all profess, and we would take scorn to be denied it; yea, if we would
deny it, God and his Church will affirm it, that we have received it even
litteral and mystical washing in the Sacrament of Baptism: Show then the proof
of it in thy cleansing: For certainly Gods Church is like a flock of sheep
going up from the washing, Can. 4.2. They tell where they have been, they tell
their washing by their cleanness. Be it so then indeed with us, let our
cleansing prove our washing: Learn of David, I will wash mine hands in
innocence, O Lord, and so will I go to thine altar, Psalm. 26.6. Learn of St.
James, Cleanse your hands ye sinners, and purge your hearts ye wavering minded,
Jam. 4.8. Learn of St. Paul, Let us cleanse our selves from all filthiness of
the flesh and spirit, 2 Cor. 7.1. That so we may be indeed (like the sheep
coming out of the water) fair and clean: Not like the black Moor coming out of
the water, never the whiter for all his washing: And if thou art come to any
degree of cleansing, O then especially beware of fouling, fall not again into
that which thou have forsaken, but say with the Spouse, Can. 5.3. I have put
off my coat, how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet, how shall I defile
them? And return not with the dog to the vomit, or with the sow to thy
wallowing in the mire; for else thy washing will not be according to that
proverb Aethiopem lavare, the washing of a black Moor, which is but lost
labor, and does neither good nor harm, but according to that laterem lavare,
the washing of a brick, which turns to the worse, even to defile the washer
himself, and to make the washed fouler then before: for, it had been better
for them not to have known the way of righteousness, then after they have known
it to turn from the holy Commandment, 2 Pet. 2.21. And when the unclean spirit
is gone out of a man, and returns again, the end of that man is worse then
the beginning, Mat. 12.43. It is a kind of despite to the spirit of Grace, and
(as much as in him lies) he defiles his washer.

But let us come to the point: Of his fullness.

All waters (how diverse soever in their rising and flowing) have one common
original from whence they flow, that is the sea; Unto the place from whence
the rivers come, thither they return again, Eccl. 1.7. And all Grace, how
different soever in gifts, have one common original, that is God himself the
unmeasurable sea of goodness; God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; for opera
Trinitatis ad extra sunt indivisa, the works of the Trinity toward the
creature are undivided, Grace flows from the Trinity: And though Creation be
appropriated to the Father, Redemption to the Son, and Sanctification to the
Holy Ghost, yet that is but to express the distinction of persons, not to make
any division of nature, or separation of work in the Deity: But the Holy God
indeed most properly is the fountain of Grace, as being not only ex natura,
but ex officio (if I may so speak with reverence) the Paraclet, the comforter,
the sanctifier, the spirit of sanctification, Romans 1.4. And yet is Christ's
fullness here properly enough made the fountain of Grace unto us, both because
all fullness is his, or in him, and because only by, and through him it
descends unto us.

First, because all fullness is his; or in him, both as he is God, and as he is
Man.

1. As he is God, in his divine nature all fullness is his; for so the holy
Ghost himself is his: not only in respect of unity of nature; for such as the
Father is, such is the Son, and such is the Holy Ghost, but also in respect of
proceeding of person, for the Holy Ghost is of the Father, and of the Son,
neither made nor created, nor begotten, but proceeding. Yea indeed as he is
God, he rather is Fullness of Grace then has it: It is not so properly said to
be his, as to be himself: For whatsoever is in God, it is essentially so, he
therefore is Fullness it self.

2. As he is Man in his humane nature all fullness of Grace is his: So Gorran
will have it taken here, namely, his fullness to belong to his humane nature
united to his Godhead: And so is it said Col. 1.19. It pleased the Father that
in him all fullness should dwell. All fullness? Yes all: Fullness of Prophesies
that were concerning him, fullness of Offices that were upon him, fullness of
Obedience that was in him.

1. Fullness of Prophecies; for he came in the fullness of time, Galat. 4.4.
when all that was to foregoe, and foreshew him was fulfilled: And in his time
the fulfilling of the Scriptures is diligently noted in the discourse and
passage of the Gospel, but most plainly Acts 13.29. They fulfilled all things
that were written of him: and verse 32. The promise made unto the Fathers GOD
has fulfilled.

2. Fullness of Offices, jointly, and severally.

Jointly; for he had (as never other man had) those three great Offices
together, a King, a Priest, and a Prophet.

Severally; for he was a Prophet full of knowledge, Col. 3.2. In whom are hid
all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.

He was a Priest, full of favor, compassion, merit.

Of favor; This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased, Mat. 3.

Of compassion; In all things it became him to be made like unto his brethren,
that he might be mercisull, and a faithful High Priest, Heb. 2.17.

Of merit; for his blood was precious: Ye are not redeemed with corruptible
things, as silver and gold, but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb
undefiled, and without spot, 1 Pet. 1.19.

He was a King full of Authority, of Power, of Magnificence, or Munificence.

Of Authority: Thou have made him to have dominion of the works of thy hands:
thou have put all things in subjection under his feet, Ps. 8.6.

Of Power: All power is given to me in heaven and in earth, Mat. 28.18.

Of Magnificence, or Munificence: He ascended up on high, he led captivity
captive, and gave gifts unto men, Ephesians. 4.6.

3. Fullness of Obedience both Passive and Active.

Passive: For he was a man full of sorrows, Is. 53.3.

Active: Thus it becomes us (says he) to fulfill all righteousness, Mat. 3.15.

In a word, his particular actions were so many Emblemes of his fullness: there
was an expressing of his fullness in them: He bade, fill the water pots with
water, that he might fill them with wine, Joh. 2.7. He drew a full draught of
fish, so full, that it brake the Net, and filled both ships that they sunck
again, Luke 5.6. He filled first five thousand bellies, and then twelve
baskets, with five loaves and two fishes, Mat. 14.19. He filled his Disciples
with the Holy Ghost: For first, he promised, I will send the promise of my
Father upon you, Luke 24.49. and then he fulfilled it; And they were all filled
with the Holy Ghost, Act. 2.4.

From hence we may draw use both of Invitation, and of Imitation.

1. Of Invitation; for besides that Christ by word inviteth, making
proclamation of his fullness, Ho every one that thirsts come ye to the
waters, Is. 55.1. His very fullness it self sufficiently inviteth us. The
Proverb is, Good wine needs no bush; but this wine of Christ is both good in
quality, and much in quantity, it inviteth therefore to it self. Every man
delights in fullness: Dulcius ex ipso font bibuntur aquae, It Is best
drinking where we may drink our fill: Suave est ex magno tollere acervo, It Is
good taking where we may take enough. O then let us not mistake so much as to
seek our fullness of content any where else but only here in Christ, where it
is truly to be found. The world has a threefold supposed Deity, Profit,
Honor, Pleasure; which make show of fullness, but cannot yield it: For Solomon
the wisest of men (speaking not only out of his judgment, but out of his
experience) concludes the world, and all therein, to be so far from fullness
of content, as to be mere vanity, and vexation of spirit. But what good soever
in the world we falsely intend, or is falsely pretended to us, that in Christ is
truly and fully to be found: Would we have wealth? his riches are unsearchable,
Ephesians. 3.8. Would we have health? he gives water of life, Joh. 4.10. and bread
of life, Joh. 6.48. Would we have liberty? If the Son shall make you free, then
are ye free indeed, Joh. 6.36. Would we have honor? It is he that has made us
Kings and Priests even to reign on the earth, Rev. 5.10. Would we have
pleasure? In his Garden there is Mirrh and spice, honeycomb and honey, wine
and milk, and he bids us eat, O friends, drink and make you merry; bibite
and inebriamini, drink and be drunken, O welbeloved, Cant. 5.1.

If therefore we look for fullness any other where, we commit a twofold evil;
one in refusing of truth, another in choosing of falsehood, as it is Jer. 2.13.
My people have committed two evils, they have forsaken me the fountain of
living waters, to dig to themselves broken pits that can hold no water. Again,

2. With Invitation here we have also Imitation offered, not only that we take
of his fullness, but that (in our measure as much as may be) we be full as he
is full: Christ is our pattern, we must learn of him (as in other things, so in
this) even to be filled with the spirit, Ephesians. 5.18. To grow up into him which
is the head unto a perfect man unto the measure of the age of the fullness of
Christ, Ephesians. 4. That we may be filled with all fullness of God, Ephesians. 3.19. Our
natural Parents would not have us dwarfs in nature, our heavenly father will
not have us dwarfs in grace: For he will have us hunger and thirst after
righteousness, Mat. 5.6. And bids us open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it,
Ps. 81.10.

But why do we not Imitate Christ's fullness of Grace? why do we not desire
it? why do we not thirst after it? No doubt because we are filled other
ways: for who despises honey but he that is full? The person that is full
despises an honey comb, Prove 27.7. The reason then why we long not for Christ's
fullness, is, because we have some other fullness, either of worldliness, or
else of windiness.

Of worldlynesse: so are they filled, who when they have heard the Word, the
cares of the world, and the deceitfulness of riches choke it, and make it
unfruitful, Mat. 13.22.

Of windiness: so are they filled who boast themselves like the Pharisee Luke
18.11. and does that they do for their own love, and self-conceit, to be seen
of men, not for Gods love, in truth and sincerity, and therefore are but
sounding brass, hollow windy vessels, Is. 26.18. And though they travail as a
woman with child, yet do they bring forth naught but wind.

Be therefore empty from such fillings, that thou may be filled with Christ's
fillings: for indeed, Nihil est vacuum, if God fill thee not, the Devil will:
Discas non diligere, ut discas diligere, funde ut impleris: Learn not to love,
that thou may love, empty thy self that thou may be filled (says St.
Augustine, in Ps. 31.26.) Fast therefore as Gluttons do when they are bidden to
a feast: yea purge as patients do when they prepare for physic: Macra cavum
repetas arctum quem macra subisti: Thou came into the world naked and empty
(corporally, temporally, spiritually) thou must be born again then, and come to
thy first scantling, and empty condition: so, and not otherwise shall thou be
capable of Christ's fullness. And so ye see all fullness is in Christ.

2. Now secondly, that all our fullness, all our measure descends only by, and
through him.

All is his in regard of possessing, all is his in regard of conveighing, all
is his originally, all is his mediately: All is both of him, and by him, from
him, and through him: All is ours in regard of his communicating, our
participating: All ours is his in regard of our deriving, his abounding: He is
not only the Fountain that yields, but the Pipe that conveigheth, and
leads every drop of Grace that runs into our souls: For the Church
concludes all her Prayers and Thanksgivings, through Jesus Christ our Lord,
making him the only Jacobs Ladder whereon God descends unto us, and we
ascend unto him, Jo. 1.51. He is not only the root that feeds all his
branches, but the trunck that deriveth the sap of life to every one, according
to its measure and capacity: I am the vine, my father is an husband man, every
branch in me that bears not fruit he takes away, and every branch that
bears fruit, he purges it, that it may bring forth more fruit, Joh. 15.1.

Well then, all our fullness is derived to us as well by him, as from him. All?
yes, as well of being, as of well being.

Of being, even our substance, and existence. Ours? Yea all creatures: for all
things were made by him, Joh. 1.3. By him? yea, by him, and for him were all
things created, Col. 1.16. By him: for he is that essential operative Word of
God, By the word of the Lord were the heavens made, Psalm. 33.6. For him; for,
he made him heir of all things by whom he made the worlds, Heb. 1.2. So that he
may be said to be originalis, instrumentalis, and finalis causa, the original,
isntrumental, and final cause of the being of all things.

And as of our being, so of our well being also, and that both in grace and in
glory.

Our well being in Grace is by, and through him; both our capableness and our
fullness.

Our capablenesse is by him, even that we are Vessels: Vessels we are indeed by
nature, but vessels of wrath; We were by nature children of wrath, Ephesians. 2.3.
How do we then become vessels of mercy prepared unto glory? Romans 9.23. Even
through that adoption of Sons, which we have in our redemption; which work is
only, and wholly his: Thou have redeemed us to God by thy blood, Rev. 5.9. He
has by himself purged our sins, Heb. 1.3.

It is by him then that we are made capable of heavenly water, of our selves we
are broken pitchers, and cannot hold: for our bursting in Adam was like the
bursting of a potters pot that is broken without pity; so that in all the
mass of mankind, there was not left one sheard to take fire out of this
hearth, or water out of this pit (the fire of the Spirit, the water of Grace)
but our capablenesse is restored by Christ.

And as our capableness, so likewise our fullness is by him, even all our
measure of Sanctification, and Justification; Ye are washed, ye are sanctified,
ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, 1 Cor. 6.11. Christ Jesus is
made unto us wisdom and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption, 1
Cor. 1.30.

And as in Grace, so also in Glory our fullness is by him; for this is the sea
whereto that stream does lead, Whom he called, them he justified, whom he
justified them he glorified, Romans 8.30. And by whom? only by Christ: The gift
of God is eternal lafe by Jesus Christ our Lord, Romans 6.23. So that Christ is
still our means: Christ in you the hope of glory, Col. 1.27.

Well then may we conclude, that this is that Fountain that is opened for sin
and for uncleanness, Zach. 13.1. and that there is not salvation in any other;
for among men there is given none other name under heaven whereby we must be
saved, Act. 4.12.

Learn therefore here to shun all false means of Grace and Mercy, and earnestly
to seek Christ, who only is the truth.

1. To shun all false means, namely, which are not subordinate him: for he has
his subordinate means which must be sought, that he also may be found: As the
Ministry and use of the Word and Sacraments.

He is the Fountain of Grace, yet has he his Ministers to draw out his waters,
and to sprinkle his garden therewith; I have planted, Apollo watered. 1 Cor.
3.6. He is the foundation whereon that house of living stones is builded, yet
has he his workmen to set it up: As a wise Master builder I have laid the
foundation, and another builds thereon, 1 Cor. 3.10.

He is the root and stock, the true tree of life into which we must be graffed,
yet has he his Gardners by whose industry we must be graffed, that we may
grow, and pruned that we may bear: In Christ Jesus I have begotten you through
the Gospel, 1 Cor. 4.13. (there is our graffing) The whole Scripture is
profitable to teach, to improve, to correct, to instruct, 2 Timothy 3.16. (there is
our pruning) Let us then apply our selves unto such helps as may help us unto,
yea even into Christ, but let us take heed of such as are averse from him, or
adverse to him: such Drawers as in stead of sprinkling the heavenly water of
the Word, do sprinkle water made holy in name, but unholy in truth by
superstition, and abominable conjuration: Such builders as build Babel, the
Tower of confusion, Genesis 11. such as build with untempered mortar of their own
inventions and traditions, Ez. 13. Such Gardners whose Vine is the Vine of
Sodom, and of the Vines of Gomorrah, their grapes are grapes of gall, and their
clusters be bitter, their wine is the poison of dragons, and the cruel gall of
asps, Deuteronomy. 32. These be they that teach us to make many Mediators by their
Doctrine of Invocation of Saints; that teach us to make many Redeemers by their
doctrine of Merit and satisfaction of Works; that teach us to receive Christ
visibly by the eye in the use of Crucifixes and Images; and corporally in the
Sacrament by material Transubstantiation. But we know there is one Mediator
between God and man which is the man Christ Jesus, 1 Timothy 2.5. We know that
there is one satisfier, who his own self bare our sins in his body on the tree,
1 Pet. 2.24. We know that God must be worshipped in spirit, God is a spirit,
and they that worship him, must worship him in spirit, and in truth, Joh. 4.24.
and that Christ must be received spiritually by Faith: He that comes to me
shall not hunger, and he that believes in me shall never thirst, Joh. 6.35.
Therefore let us renounce all such false helps and helpers as do wait upon
lying vanities, and forsake their own mercy, Jonah 2.8.

2 And let us seek Christ, who only is the truth; I am the way, the truth, and
the life, says he Ioh. 4.16. Seek him for our childrens sake, seek him for our
selves.

For our children, in the speedy use of Baptism: The fountain is opened, let us
not be slack to come to it. We take care to preserve natural life in the
birth, shall we not much more to recover spiritual life in Baptism? Shall we
grieve to see a child born dead in nature, and shall it be no grief to see a
child kept dead in sin?

And for our selves also let us seek Christ; for what are we without him?
Branches of the wild olive tree, children of wrath, dead by sins, aliens from
the commonwealth of Israel, strangers from the covenant of promise, having no
hope, without God in the world, Romans 11. Ephesians. 2.

Seek Christ therefore; for he is our peace, Ephesians. 2.14. How shall we seek and
find him? by Faith: for we walk by Faith, not by sight, 2 Cor. 5.7. And how
shall Faith be obtained? Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of
God, Romans 10. And how shall it be proved? By obedience, Show me thy Faith by
thy works, Jam. 2.18. Seek Faith then by all good means; hearing, praying,
communicating; Ask and ye shall have, seek and ye shall find: And show faith by
all good fruits, Show forth the virtues of him that has called you out of
darkness into this mavelous light, 1 Pet. 2.19. We have had our graffing
already in the Sacrament of Baptism, but let us not deceive our selves therein
to rest satisfied, it may be insufficient to us; for growing does not
necessarily follow every graffing, though never so orderly done, some graffes
starve and dye; Every plant which my heavenly father has not planted shall be
rooted up, Mat. 15.13. There is Baptisma fluminis, and Baptisma flaminis, the
Baptism of water, and the Baptism of the spirit, God tyeth us to the one, we
cannot tie him, neither does he tie himself to the other; for he has mercy on
whom he will, Romans 9.18. And the wind blows where it lusts, so is every one
that is born of the Spirit, Joh. 3.8. Let us then show our graffing by our
growing, Grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus
Christ, 2 Pet. 3. As new born babes desire the sincere milk of the Word, that
ye may grow thereby, 1 Pet. 2.2.

And so much of the first part of the Text, The Fountain of Grace: His fullness.

The second general part is the Stream (have all we received.) Every fountain
naturally and necessarily sends forth a stream: It is so in nature, it must
needs be so in grace. The proverb may be turned, and stand true both ways,
Bonum quo communius eo me lius, bonum quo melius eo communius; Every good thing
the commoner it is the better it is; the better it is the commoner it is: This
fountain therefore of goodness, or rather this sea of goodness, or rather this
essential, substantial goodness, which is God himself, ever had its
streaming, and never was contented, restrained, or limited in, or to it self,
but always flowed. Always flowed? But how could it flow out of him when as
yet nothing was without him? To whom, or where could it run when there was not
a who, or a where to receive it? Where was this streaming before there was any
creating? Why, besides that ineffable, and unconceivable eternity of the
Fathers begetting, and the holy Ghosts proceedings that communicating of
nature, that existing of personality, and the issuing of the properties
thereof, that communion of love, joy, peace, and all perfection of goodness
which for ever flowed in the Trinity, intensive, and ad intra, as immanent
actions, (the sea flowing in it self) there was also for ever, and
everlastingly an ext ensive and distributive flowing of goodness from God even
unto us, even before we were. How? not actually to us because of our not being,
and yet actually in him because of his decreeing: not actually in regard of our
participating, yet actually in regard of his determining and disposing, and by
purpose and decree actual exhibiting: For Gods grace was given us in Christ
before the world began, 2 Timothy 1.9. And he has chosen us in Christ before the
foundation of the world, Ephesians. 1.4. And he has loved us with an everlasting
love, Jer. 31.3. No doubt both ways everlasting as well without beginning, as
without ending. And what shall I need to show the continual flowing and
streaming of his goodness, when as we cannot be ignorant, that in him we live,
and move, and have our being, Act. 17.28. Yea that by him all things consist,
Col. 1.17.

O come hither and bring forth your goodness all ye that profess to have it,
show it by this light, measure it by this rule, try it by this touch, namely,
whether it has any flowing, or streaming or no: For what goodness was there
ever locked up, or buried in it self? The Heathen concluded virtus in action,
that virtue consists in action; let not us Christians then talk of goodness
without action or expression, but let it have its course according to its kind,
let the stream appear both temporally and spiritually. Temporally; for though
Charity begins at home, yet it is not bounded, nor ended there, but rather
there takes the rule and measure of its extent, namely, thou shall love thy
neighbor as thy self. Spiritually; for though we must worship God in spirit,
and serve him in secret, yet not without both lighting, and drawing others: Not
without lighting others; for our light must so shine before men, that they may
see our good works, Mat. 5.16. Not without drawing others; for we must consider
one another to provoke unto love; and to good works, and to exhort one another,
Heb. 10.24.

What then do those Monopolists, those inclosers of good? the Laick Cofferer,
the Clerick cloysterer, who resolve to live only to themselves, the one for
this worlds sake, the other for the next: What do they but invert the order,
and pervert the nature of goodness, and make it run ordine retrogrado, the
quite contrary way, nothing outwardly, but altogether inwardly to themselves:
What are they but barren trees, which suck up the substance, and the sweet
juice and moisture both of earth and heaven, only to increase their own sap,
but not to bring forth fruit? and therefore deserves that censure of the
fruitless tree, Cut it down, why cumbreth it the ground, Luke 13.7? What are
they but savage monsters, and of that cruel Lions kind, of whom it is said,
omnia te advorsum, spectantia nulla retrorsum: He entertained all comers into
his den, but let none come forth again. Yea (in a word) Judas may be a
sufficient glass to both kinds of ingrossers, they may see themselves in him,
and fear his punishment; he received much both temporally, and spiritually, he
had both kinds of income, but wanting vent, and having no right use or
utterance, it brake him at the last, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his
bowels gushed out, Act. 1.18.

But what is this stream of this fountain here expressed?

Have all we received.
Note here the Nature, and the Objects; how, and to whom it runs.

1. The nature how (Received) It is not Inherited, it is not purchased, it is
not earned.

1. It is not Inherited; for in Adam all dye, 1 Cor. 15.22. We are by nature
the children of wrath, Ephesians. 2.3.

2. It is not purchased: For who has given to him first, and he shall be
recompensed? Romans 11.35.

3. It is not earned; for when we have done all that ever we can do, we must
say we are but unprofitable servants, we have done but our duty, Luke 17.10.

What is it then? The true property of a stream is here in Grace: It runs not
compelled, not procured, but freely and voluntarily, all men (even the best
men) are but receivers: so is the Text, All we have received.

It is not of our selves, but altogether of God: It is not in him that wills,
nor in him that runs, but in God that shows mercy, Romans 9.16. We are as
merely passive in the first receipt of Grace, as the earth is in the receipt of
the running, or overflowing, or dropping water, as merely passive in our new
making, as in our first making: not like the half dead man, Luke 10.30. who had
some motion in him to help himself, but like Lazarus so stark dead as even
become stinking ripe: You has he quickened that were dead in trespasses and
sins, Ephesians. 2.1. The dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that
hear shall live, Joh. 5.25.

Where then is our piety? where is our humility? where is our charity?

Where is our piety toward God both in tongue and hand, in word and deed, in
thankfulness, and in all holiness? What shall I render unto the Lord for all
the benefits he has done unto me? I will take the cup of salvation and call
upon the name of the Lord, I will pay my vows unto the Lord even now in the
presence of all his people, Ps. 116.12.

Where is our humility in our selves, inwardly, and outwardly toward God, and
toward man, in respect of corporal, temporal, spiritual, eternal goods and
riches, prerogatives and preheminences? that no man presume above that which is
written, that one swel not against another; for who separateth thee, and what
have thou that thou have not received? If thou have received it, why boastest
thou as thou had not received it? 1 Cor. 4.6.

Where is our charity toward our neighbor? for If God so loved us, we ought
also to love one another, 1 John 4.11. His free dealing with us is for our
imitation to exercise it one to another; Be merciful as your heavenly father
is merciful, Luke 6.36. Freely have ye received, freely give, Mat. 10.8. Not
grudgingly, or of necessity; for God loves a cheerful giver, 2 Cor. 9.7.

Secondly with the nature (how) note also the objects to whom this stream of
Grace does flow (all we) here is a certainty (we) and yet a generality (all) A
general certainty then, or certain generality (if ye will) ye may call it.

First certainty; for (we) implies a certain number, it has relation to some
express company. This certainty may be taken both ways, both on Gods part,
and on our own, both to God, and to our selves.

To God; for he is not subject to any ignorance, therefore not such ignorance,
as to give he knows not to whom. No, but the foundation of God remains sure,
having this seal, the Lord knows who are his, 2 Timothy 2.19. Whom he knew
before them he predestined, Romans 8.29. Therefore to whom God affords not
this stream of Grace, them he is said not to know, Mat. 7.23. I never knew you,
depart from me ye that work iniquity.

To us also ye see this is a certainty; for St. John puts in himself (we)
taking himself certainly for one: And though he says (all we) speaking for
them that are to come, as well as for them that are past, yet for certainties
sake he speaks in the time past (as the Prophets use to speak of things to
come) have all we received. And why not? for God not only has his seal, but
affords us to have ours: We are sealed with the holy spirit of promise, Ephesians.
1.13. There Is his: He that has received his testimony has set to his seal,
Joh. 3.33. there is ours; yea our certainty indeed depends upon his, even
because of his immutability; because whom he loves unto the end he loves
them, Joh. 13.1. and because the gifts and calling of God are without
repentance, Romans 11.29. and with him is no variableness, nor shadow, or
turning, Jam. 1.17. Therefore the Apostle says, Ye know God, or rather are
known of God, Gal. 4.9. And he labors to apprehend that for which also he
is apprehended, Phil. 3.12.

And is there indeed a certainty to be had? why then do we not labor to
attain it? why do we not give diligence to make our calling and election sure?
1 Pet. 2. why do we not lay hold on eternal life? 1 Timothy 6. why do we not
edify our selves in our most holy faith, Jude 20. that we may be rooted and
grounded in love, that we may have boldness and confidence by faith in him,
Ephesians. 3. And be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might, Ephesians. 6. No
doubt but this may be done, for we see it here, and Gal. 2.20. I live by faith
in the Son of God, who has loved me, and given himself for me: Yea no doubt
but it must be done; for without faith it is impossible to please God, Heb.
11.6. Yea no doubt but it is done of every one that believes; for what is
faith else but the ground and evidence even of our particular hopes? Heb. 11.
For if it be not particular to our self, then it is but joint and common to,
and with the devil: Thou beleevest there is one God, thou do well, the
devils believe, and tremble, Joh. 2.19.

Woe then to them that deny us the possibility of this comfort, the particular
certainty of Faith: for herein they kill the very life of Faith (which indeed
is comfort) they make so deadly a wound therein, that all their Pardons, and
Indulgences, Satisfactions, and Merits can never recover, and heal it up again.

And with certainty here is also generality (all we.)

But may some say, if so, what needs then care, or labor for certainty? for if
all receive, then there is no doubt to any.

The word (all) may be taken either at the largest, or in a restrained and
limited sense. If we take it at the largest, that all have received, then we
must distinguish upon their receiving (to wit) that all do receive and partake
of Christ outwardly in respect of the ear, and the outward calling, No doubt
their sound went out into all the earth, and their words into the ends of the
world, Romans 10.18. The Gospel shall be preached throughout all the world, Mat.
24.14. And so that may be taken, 2 Timothy 2.4. God will that all men shall be
saved, namely, by his revealed will, he gives the precept, the command, the
outward calling unto all.

Whereby we may see that Christ is sufficient for all, and there is no defect
in the receipt, but in the receivers: And if we will put off the defect from
our selves to God, because he gives not the inward as well as the outward
calling, the effect as well as the offer, why here is his clearing, Eccl. 7.29.
God made man righteous, but they have sought out many inventions. He made us,
he is not bound to new-make us, he gave grace, he is not bound to restore it:
If we had been all left in Adams perishing without any measure of mercy, yet
God should be justified and clear, when, or howsoever we should presume to
judge him.

But here (no doubt) the Text speaks of the effectual receipt of Grace, and
therefore the word (all) must be restrained, and limited. And that St.
Augustine does in his Enchirid. ad Laur. speaking of that 2 Timothy 2.4. And he
restrains it doubly. First, God will have all to be saved, that is (says he)
all that are saved God will have to be saved, and none are saved without, or
against his will. And so it may be here taken. All that do receive Grace do
receive it of Christ's fullness, there is no other fountain, pipe, or stream,
from, or by which it flows: He is fons perennis, a living, lasting spring:
Labitur and labetur in omne volubilis aevum, his running has been and shall be
from the beginning to the end of theworld. For he was that lamb slain from the
beginning of of the world, Rev. 13.8. whose goings forth have been from the
beginning and from everlasting Mic. 5.2.

No doubt then that Doctrine is but a dotage and a mere fancy that affirms
Christ to have been insufficient to the Fathers and Patriarks, and other
faithful before him; in this point, namely, that they could not be admitted
into Gods presence and into the fulness of joy, before Christ was actually
offered, and his sacrifice accomplished, but were kept in limbo, in a place of
banishment: This I say must needs be a fancy: For seeing all have received
Christ, even they as well as we, as it is plain, 1 Cor. 11.3. They did all eat
the same spiritual meat, they did all drink the same spiritual drink, for
they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them, and that Rock, was
Christ, therefore no doubt they had the same end and issue and benefit of their
faith as we have, even the salvation of their souls, and that in present
fullness of joy immediately after their dissolution, and not so tedious a
banishment, and so long as some of their deaths were bebefore Christ.

The other restraint and exposition of Saint Augustine is, that the word (All)
must be taken for all sorts of conditions, sexes and ages, states and degrees.
And this is the common received construction, that the word (all) in such
speaking is to be taken, non pro singulis generum, sed pro generibus
singulorum, not for every of all kinds, but for some of every kind; for there
is no respect of persons with God: he made all, and he disposes of all, he
made all: It is he that has made us, and not we our selves: Ps. 100. He
disposes of all, The Lord makes poor and makes rich. 1 Samuel 2.7. And as at
first in the creation he found no fault with his works, but all was very good,
Genesis 1. so still in his providence he has no fault to find but all is good,
therefore does he despise the work of his hands in neither kind, but he that is
Lord over all, is rich unto all, To. 10.12.

This may humble us, this may comfort us, this may unite us.

1. This may humble us: for God makes no difference of us in the best things;
let not us therefore be proud of our difference in the worst things. God will
have differences and degrees in his Church militant for orders sake (for he is
the God of order, not of confusion) yea in his triumphant Church too (no doubt)
degrees of glory: For one Star differs from another Star in glory, so is
the resurrection of the dead. 1 Cor. 15. Let not then this order make disorder,
presuming in superiors, murmuring in inferiors; there it cannot be because of
their fullness, for every one is filled alike because he is fulfilled, their
filling is alike, though their measures differ; And here it should not be
because of our emptiness, we are alike empty of grace by nature, till God
affords us several degrees of filling. And if we will boast of worldly
fulness, how little cause have we to be proud of it, when as here we see the
stream of grace runs alike to all sorts and degrees?

2. This also may comfort us, that this stream runeth unto all, for therefore
it cannot fail to us, neither can we fail to it.

It cannot fail to us by length or largeness of running the spring is the same
how many soever do drink of the stream: we cannot fail to it, by our high or
low being, for it finds out all estates, it runs unto all. Despair not
therefore on Gods part, his Fountain cannot be drawn dry: despair not on thine
own part, for (whosoever thou art) thou art not debarred the stream of grace:
this comfort abounds whatsoever fails, all sorts partake of grace, it
runs unto all: All we have received.

3. Thirdly, this may unite us: why? God does equal us in the best things, his
grace runs unto all: what stronger bond can there be of union? Have we not
all one Father? why do we transgress every one against his brother? Mal. 2.10.
Endeavor to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace, there is one
body and one spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling, one
Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and father of all, Ephesians. 4.3. And so much
of the second general part of the text, viz. the stream. All we have received.

The third and last general part is the banks, And grace for grace. Every
Fountain has a stream, every stream has its banks: therefore the Evangelist
here shows not only the Fountain from whence, and the stream how, but also
banks and bounds, how far forth, and in what measure grace does flow: And
grace for grace.

Some will have it taken prorata portione: that there is a proportion of grace
in us answerable to that in Christ; Namely, that he imparteth to his Church
every of his graces, because Christ is the head, and the Church is the body,
and caput in membra redundat, between the head and the body there is communion
of influence, and can be no stoppage: And so (grace for grace) is, that we have
a grace in us, for every grace grace that is in Christ, and so that we also
have our fullness answerable to his: And so indeed the Church is called his
body, the fulness of him that fills all in all. Ephesians. 1.23. So that then
this is true, (being truly taken, and rightly understood, the banks observed,
our measure kept) Christ communicates unto us whatsoever he has, even grace
for grace, his fullness becomes ours; And that is not only by way of
imputation, he is made unto us wisdom and righteousness; and sanctification
and redemption, 1 Cor. 1.30. but by the way of influence and participation,
because as he is, even so are we in this world, 1 Jo. 4.17.

But his fullness is ours only according to our measures proportionable to our
capacity: In us it is plenitudo sufficiens, sufficient to every man for his own
salvation. The just shall live by his faith, Heb. 2.4. by this, that is, his
own faith. But in him it is plenitudo superabundans, fulness abounding to
others salvation, the precious ointment upon our Aarons (our high priests)
head, runs down to his beard, and to the skirts of his clothing, to all his
parts and members. In us it is plenitudo vafis vessell-fullnesse, we have this
treasure in earthen vessels, 2 Cor. 4. but in him it is plenitudo fontis,
fountain-fullnesse, They have forsaken me the fountain of living waters. Jer.
2.13. In us it is plenitudo comparata, compared-fullnesse, respective to each
subject, or continent. My grace is sufficient for thee. 2 Cor. 12 9. But in him
it is plenitudo absoluta, absolute fulness, without all respect or measure,
for God gives not the spirit by measure to him, Jo. 3.34. In a word, there is
plenitudo apta, plenitudo aequa, plenitudo superfluens, an apt, an equal, and
an overflowing fullness.

1. An apt fullness: as when a house, or Town, or Country is said to be full of
people, meaning well filled, aptly or competently full: So the house of Baal
was said to be full from one end to the other, 2 Kings 10. and yet Jehu bad his
80. men go in and slay them: It was full then, and yet there was room for 80.
more: Such is our fullness here in this life, we are aptly and competently
filled with grace, so much as may suffice us, but so as there is still room for
more, more may come in: for we must still grow in grace. 2 Pet 3. And multiply
graces, faith virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, godliness, brotherly
kindness, love: 2 Pet 1. And this is like the Israelites gathering of Manna in
the desert of sin: He that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered
little had no lack, every man gathered according to his eating: Exo. 16. God
gave them their portion competent for natural life, and so he does give us our
portion competent to each for spiritual life: none of the elect has too much,
none too little, but every one sufficient, just enough to serve his turn.

2. There is plenitudo aequa, an equal fullness, as when a vessel is so
top-full that there is nihil vacuum, no part of it is empty, no room for more.
So were the waterpots filled up to the brim, Jo. 2. so full that they could
hold no more. And this is proper to the Saints in Heaven: In thy presence is
the fullness of joy, Ps. 16. they are top full and have no more room for grace,
their measure is fulfilled.

3. Thirdly, there is plenitudo superfluens, an overflowing fullness: such was
that of the widows pot of oil that never ceased running so long as there were
any empty vessels to receive it: And this is Christ's fountain, the stream
whereof flows unto all: Of his fullness have all we received, and grace for
grace. So th^n we receive grace for grace with Christ, an answerablenesse of
his graces, proportion of his fullness: how? to our competency and sufficiency:
And therefore it must needs be a doctrine of devils to teach that a man may
fall away from saving grace and justifying faith, and be broken off from
Christ: No, no, Christ has warranted his sheep shall never perish, Jo. 10.28.
And that the gates of Hell shall not prevail against his Church, Mat. 16.18.
They went out from us 1 Jo. 2. (says St. John) but they were not of us; for if
they had been of us, they would have continued with us: Our portion (we may
say) is according to his: (grace for grace) yet not in equality to him, but in
sufficiency to us, so that it cannot fail us.

But Chrysostom and Theophylact, and others will have Grace for grace here to
be the grace of the new Testament for the grace of the old: so that (for)
should signify (in stead of) And understanding grace for grace to signify the
Gospel in stead of the Law: And this they gather out of the next words,
because it follows, for the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth come
by Jesus Christ.

And this also wants not ground nor truth. For indeed the Law was grace, for
it was given by Moses, gratis ergo gratia; free given, and therefore free
grace: For was it not grace that God should covenant with man? that the Creator
should in any sort or upon any terms or conditions oblige himself unto his
creature? So then the very killing letter of the Law, the very covenant of
works was grace. 2 Cor. 3.6. It was gratia illustrans or illuminans, a glass
to show us what once we were, and what still we should be: It was gratia
stimulans, a goading or spurring grace, to set us on to good: It was gratia
franans, or restringens, a curbing grace to restrain us from evil: But in all
this it was but gratia jubens, it was not gratia adjuvans; It was but a
commanding, it was not an assisting grace, and so indeed but a very killing
grace, the very indictment whereby we stood all condemned; For it was that
every mouth might be stopped, and all the world become guilty before God; for
by the Law is the knowledge of sin, To. 3.19, 20.

Therefore God was not content with the gift of this grace, but out of his
fullness he streameth another: the Covenant of faith for the Covenant of works:
So God loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, to the end that
all that believe in him him should not perish, but have everlasting life, Jo.
3.16. He takes away the first, that he may establish the second, Heb. 10.9.
Takes it away? how? not the body of it, but the rail of it; not the strength
of it, but the sting, not the blood, but the penalty, not the observation, but
the condemnation; Christ has redeemed us (not simply from the Law, but) from
the curse of the Law. Gal. 3.13. so only we are said not to be under the Law,
but under grace. Romans 6.4.

What then? Saint Paul's use may be here applied, Gal. 5.1. Stand fast
therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ has made us free, and be not
entangled again with the yoke of bondage: he has freed us from the Covenant of
penalty, let us not stick still to the Covenant of recompense; we are brought
from the one, let us therefore renounce the other, as Saint Paul does. Phil.
3.7. Those things which are advantage to me, the same I accounted loss for
Christ's sake, etc. that I may win Christ and be found in him, not having mine
own right cousnesse which is of the Law, but that which is through the faith of
Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith. For Dei justitiam
ignorantes, and suam constituere volentes, non nomine quidem, sed errore
Judaizant, says St. Augustine ( Aug. Ep. 200.) they that are ignorant of Gods
righteousness, and do set up their own, do play the Jews, though not in name,
yet in error.

But Saint Augustine is the best measurer and determiner of these banks, he
will have it to be, not grace for (that is, according to) grace in proportion
and correspondencie, as in my first exposition: Nor grace for, that is instead
of grace, or by way of exchange, according to my second exposition: but grace
for, that is is in rewand of grace, one grace to crown another: so he says,
Deus dona misericordiae suae coronat, God does crown his own gifts of mercy,
one grace with another: so it comes to pass that we have the grace of glory in
reward for the grace of faith: Ipsa fides gratia est, and vita aeterna gratia
est pro gratia. says he, Aug. in Jo. 1.16. Faith is grace, and life eternal
is grace for grace. And to this acute Gorran consents, Gratia retributionis
pro gratia justificationis, gratia patriae pro gratia viae: And this indeed is
the strongest bank of our stream, even as the sea bank, a bound which our
greatest waters may not pass: Hitherto may we come and no further, and here
our proud waves must stay. Job 38.11. we can boast no further, for Qui tibi
enumerat merita sua, Aug: conf. li. 9. ca. 13.
quid tibi enumerat nisi muneratua? he that tells of his merits, what does he
tell but Gods gifts says Saint Augustine. And Saint Bernard confesses, Ser.
1. in Annun. merit a omnia Dei dona sunt, and it a homo propter ipsa Deo
debtor est, non Deus homini: Our merits are Gods gifts, which do make us in
debt to him, not him to us. And to this exposition that place agrees well,
Romans 8.29. whom he knew before, them he predestined, whom he predestined,
them he called, whom he called, them he justified, whom he justified them he
glorified. Here is no reason or cause of our calling, but Gods predestinating
us: no reason of our justifying but his calling us: no reason of our
glorifying, but only his justifying us, he does the one because he has done
the other, he proceeds from grace to grace, still crowning his own gifts. So
that indeed grace is both Fountain and Stream and bank unto it self, God is
both the author and finisher of our faith, Heb. 12.2. all the degrees of our
happiness from first to last, all is grace; our election is grace, He has
predestined us according to the good pleasure of his will, Ephesians. 1.5. Our
vocation is grace. Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth. Ja.
1.18. Our justification is grace. We are justified freely by his grace, Romans
3.24. Our glorification is grace. Eternal life is the gift of God through
Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 6. So that we can find no other bank or limit
whereby to bound this stream, but even it self.

In the measuring of banks there must needs be taken longum, latum and
profundum, length and breadth, depth and height: And so indeed here in this
there is length, for it reaches from the beginning to the end: there is
breadth, for it overspreadeth all the world: there is depth, for it extends
from heaven to earth: But with what line or plumet shall we measure or take
these dimensions? hear Saint Paul Ephesians. 3.18. when he had prayed for the
Ephesians that they might be able to comprehend what is the breadth and length
and depth and height, he adds as the sum of all, what? And to know the love
of Christ: so that there is no measure of Gods love, but his love, no cause,
rule, or reason of his will, but his will, He has mercy on whom he will have
mercy, Romans 9.15. he loved Israel, only because he loved them, Deuteronomy. 7.7.

Talk not then of universal grace, or power of will in all men to repent and
believe, to begin, to hold, and to break at their pleasure: Talk not of
inherent grace of our own, which does gratum facere, that our own
righteousness does make us accepted, and has part in the work of our
justification: Away with all such conceits, for we see here the current of
grace runns as it were within it self: It is grace in beginning, and grace in
proceeding, and grace in concluding, Gods will and work still and not our own.

It begins no small measure, the seed of the word, the first fruits of the
spirit, but at length pro ripis littorae pulsat, It becomes an unmeasurable
Sea, which eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor can enter into the heart of
man: Wherefore let us resolve here to set up our rest, saying with David, This
shall be my rest for ever, here will I dwell, for I have a delight therein. Ps.
132. And seeing we cannot search or measure this fountain, this stream, these
banks ( for the love of Christ passes knowledge, Ephesians. 3.19. Aristoteles non
capit Euripum, Euripus capiet Aristotelem.
) let us cast our selves wholly into it: seeing in following this stream of
grace we are come to the Sea of glory; now in our meditation, let us rest and
dwell therein constantly by our contemplation, until our souls (be loosed from
these bonds of flesh) be carried with full wind and tide into the full fruition
and eternal possession thereof. Which the Lord grant to us all, etc.

Finis Tract. 5.
Trino-uni gloria.
THere is a sermon set forth in print upon this same last text, Jo. 1.16.
preached by that learned and reverend Divine Mr. Dr. Preston: which Sermon (God
knows) I never saw or heard of till long after this was finished: Neither am I
any whit the more ashamed of this, notwithstanding in some few things we have
met, and hit on the same or very like notes or touches.

W.G.

Three SERMONS here set forth in one continued Tract or discourse upon Act. 2.
ver. 1, 2.3.
And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in
one place: and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven, etc.
WHatsoever is difficult and hard to be understood and apprehended, the same is
more hard to be expressed and uttered: For the apprehension of things is the
souls immediate work, she does it her self: therefore therein she is more full
and free. But the expression of things is her secondary and mediate work,
wrought by Organs, Instruments and means: therefore therein she must needs be
more scant and weak. Tusc. quest. li: 1.
Therefore Cicero (a free and fluent speaker) says, Fieri ante potest ut recte
quis sentiat, and id quod sentit polite eloqui non possit. A quick apprehension
may be weak in expression; Now there is not any thing, no not the things that
are most common and familiar to us, that do not yield some difficulty and
hardness to be understood, and more to be uttered: Thine own things, and such
as are grown up with thee can thou not know, says the Angel to Esdras,
concerning the wind and the fire and the day, 2 Esd. 4.10. For even in the
creature the Creator has so involved himself, that we cannot look readily
upon those visible things, but our eyes must needs be dazeled with his
invisibility. And if the Sunbeams be so resplendent, what eye then can behold
the body of the Sun it self? If the nature of the creature be so unsearchable,
how shall we be able to think of him who is the Creator of all? And if to
think be so transcendent, how much more to speak rightly of him is it
impossible? Wherefore Cornelius Mussus calls it, Concio. in ser. 2. Pent.
Antiquum and a maximis theologis celebratum adagium, an old and common adage
amongst the greatest Divines, what? De deo dicere verum periculosum: To speak
truth of God is a dangerous thing. And if this be true, indefinitely taken and
in general, how much more specially and in particular? Namely, concerning his
personality? And if of the Trinity absolutely it may astonish us to think or
speak, how much more respectively of this third person? For if that mystery of
Father and Son be so ineffable and above relation, that the Prophet says, Who
shall declare this generation, Is. 53.8. Notwithstanding we have the words
begetting and being begotten, to help to express it, does not the being of the
Holy Ghost seem more incomprehensible, seeing neither to be made, created, nor
begotten, belongs unto him but to proceed? It may so seem, but in it self it
cannot so be. For we may say there are three who are incomprehensible, the
Father, the Son, the Holy Ghost) but not three incomprehensibles, but one
incomprehensible: therefore not different in degree. We may not through our
infirmity, tax God of infirmity, to make him subject to magis and minus: as if
one person were greater or less then another, for they are Coeternall together
and Coequal.

Be it so then: In themselves they are and must be one; and yet (unto us) I may
presume with reverence to say this revelation of the third person is the
special revelation, This feast continued after Christ. 1 Cor. 16.8. Act.
20.16. at least suffered, and morals survive Ceremonies.
and this feast of Pentecost, the special feast of the Church.

First it it is the special reveration: For we could not be able to behold
that ilustrious mystery of the Trinity but by the inlightning help of this
third person. That is the body of the Son, this the special beam to guide us
thereunto. Or rather (If I may dare so to spaek, for fearful ye see it is to
speak herein) the special mean or medium through which we may look thereon. I
say especial, not in regard of God, in whom there is no difference, but in
respect of us, to whom his works do differ. Especially then, (to us) the
revelation of the Trinity is perfected in and by this third person, the Holy
Ghost.

First in him: for without him there were not a Trinity: God in revealing him
has fully revealed himself. The Father was revealed by the Creation, the Son
by the Incarnation: but till this fullness of time came, God to us was not
fully come. For now and not before did his servants receive his full name in
their foreheads, being baptized in the name of the Father, of the Son, and of
the Holy Ghost. And now (being made known to be (...) his triple unity revealed
(...) by way of special excellency) he is become to us a King, and we to him
a Kingdom: For now especially he has vouchsafed to specify his Church by the
name of his Kingdom. Mat. 11. He that is least in the Kingdom of God: that
is in the state of his Church, after this third revealing of himself. This is
the complete mystery of godliness, God is manifested in the flesh, justified
in the spirit. 1 Timothy 3.16.

And as In him, so also By him (to us) is the Trinity especially perfected: For
this God of order allwaies observes order, as ad intra, in his personal
proprieties, so ad extra, in his outward works: The Father creating, the Son
redeeming, the Holy Ghost sanctifying. And what had the former two works been
without this third? The Son of God had his twofold marriage: one personal
with his flesh, the other mystical with his Church: and in each, the Father
was the Donor and the Son the Receiver: there wanted not Bride or Bridegoom, or
giver: But who could be worthy to be the minister in these holy conjunctions?
None but the Holy Ghost: He was the Minister in the personal marriage: For the
word was made flesh: but how? he was conceived of the Holy Ghost: Conceived:
the flesh supernaturally formed, the Word hypostatically united. And in the
mystical marriage likewise he is the Minister. For if any man have not the
spirit of Christ, the same is none of his: But as many as are led by the spirit
of God, they are the Sons of God: For this is that spirit of adoption by whom
we cry Abba Father: Romans 8. He works the application of Christ unto us by
faith, and of us unto Christ by love, and so is that marriage made. The father
is our Physician, the Son our Physic: But the Holy Ghost is that blessed
Apothecary, which applies of this salve to every sore, and administreth
portions of this portion, distributing to every one severally even as he will.
1 Cor. 12.11. The Father was the sacrificer, the Son the Sacrifice, but where
was the fire? Wis. 16. This charitas Dei, this loving spirit, this love of God,
Tit. 3.4. or rather this God Love ( for God is love 1 Jo. 4.8.) was that
heavenly fire wherein this sacrifice was finished: For God so loved the world
that he gave his only begotten Son, Jo. 3.16. And through the eternal spirit
Christ offered himself without spot to God, Heb. 9.14. The Son is the arm, the
Holy Ghost is the hand: the Father the body from which they issue, or are
derived: And as in the body natural, the eye cannot say to the hand I have no
need of thee, 1 Cor. 12. Yea the feeble members are so necessary, that to the
less honorable members we give more abundant honor, so in this body of bodies,
this fountain of beings (the holy deity) the plurality of persons is no ways
needless, but their perfection consists, not less in their Trinity, then in
their unty. And lest we should think the Holy Ghost (because he is the third in
order) to be the third in honor, behold what abundant honor we are to give him:
The arm and hand work together, and at once with the body, and in and with the
same strength: yet the perfection, and consequently the honor of the work, more
immediately belongs to the arm, and most immediately to the hand. This Holy
Ghost is the holy hand of God, by which all the works of God are to us most
immediately perfected. With a mighty hand a stretched out arm, he brought his
Israel out of corporal bondage: And with that stretched arm, the redemption
of the Son, and this mighty hand, the operation of the Holy Ghost, he
brings his Israel out of spiritual bondage. I cannot show you all the
fingers of this hand, for they abound, yet not superfluously like that
monstrous creature, who had six upon each hand, 2 Samuel 21. but richly as it
becomes the Creator, (being Lord of all) to be rich unto all: Let it suffice
that some of these fingers are expressed in the Scriptures. Exo. 8.19. Pharaohs
inchanters spoke concerning the plague of lice, This is the finger of God:
there is medius, the strong finger of Power: Exo. 31. Moses received the two
Tables written with the finger of God: there is Index, the pointing finger of
wisdom, Lu. 11.20. Christ says, If I by the finger of God cast out Devils:
there is medicus, the healing finger of mercy. These are not those writing
fingers in Belshazars vision, Dan. 5. they write no fearful indictment: but
they are those dropping fingers, Can. 5. which drop down pure myrrh, blessed
distillations of grace and mercy, to blot out the old handwriting that was
against us. Yea, this hand enableth them on whom it rests, to prevail with
God by holy wrestling, as Jacob did, Genesis 32.28. and to make violent entry by
force into the Kingdom of Heaven, Mat. 11.12. No marvel that Christ says, It
is expedient for you that I go away, Joh. 16.7. Why? that the third person
might take his course and turn: that God unto usward might be perfected. In
him, in respect of revelation. By him, in respect of application and operation.

Again, this feast of the coming and appearing of the Holy Ghost, is to us the
feast of feasts, the special feast. We may compare it, yea, (with reverence be
it spoken) we may prefer it to the feast of the Nativity, in the former
respects: Namely in our own behalf, this being the consummation of that unto
us, the Catastrophe, the last scene of that divine act of the blessed Trinity:
In that feast God (unchanged in himself) descended unto man: In this man
changed and renewed from himself, is lifted up unto God. In that, God became
partaker of the humane nature, in this, man is made partaker of the divine
nature. In that, one man was made the Temple of God: 1 Cor. 6.19. in this every
one of the faithful, is made so feverally, and all-together jointly Ephesians. 2.21.
That was begun secretly in the Virgins womb, and accomplished obscurely in a
stable: This was done openly and publicly, at a great feast, and a solemn
assembly. In a word, as the beginning without the end were vain, so the end
would not be without the beginning: Therefore let no man put asunder that which
God has joined together: Yet exitus acta probat, unto us the end and
consummation is all in all.

Be it so then: and let Saint Bernards player teach us the use of it, Ser. 3.
in Pent. (that I follow it not further:) Solemnitatem praecipuam hodie
celebramus, utinam devotione praecipua. We celebrate a special feast to day,
God grant we do it with special devotion: that God having now given himself
wholly to us, we may also give our selves fully and wholly unto him: That, that
which was the true success of this feast in the Apostles (though wrongfully
objected) may be verifyed in us: What? They are full of wine. Act. 2.13. Jam
enim fuerat magnus ille botrus calcatus. Aug. Ser. 2. in 2. fer. Pent. and in
Ps. 63.8.
This is that wine that flows from that heavenly Vine the Son of God: I am
the true vine Joh. 15.1. He is the true Vine, and this is the true wine, even
which truly makes glad the heart of man. It is the true Vine, and it is the
new wine, whereof that old bottle (the Jewish Synagogue) was not capable: With
this holy wine (the influence and affluence or rather the superfluence of the
holy spirit) were the Apostles drunken: and so should we endeavor to be. God
has fulfilled his promise, Inebriabuntur (as the vulgar has it) they shall be
drunken, or abundantly filled with the plenteousnesse of thy house, and thou
shall give them drink of thy pleasures, as out of the River, Ps. 36.8. It
behooveth us then to fulfill this precept, Comedite amici, bibite and
inebriamini charissimi: Eat O friends, drink and be drunken, O well beloved,
Can 5.1. Drink and be drunken? how? Be not drunken with wine wherein is excess
(says the Apostle, Ephesians. 5.18. but be ye filled with the spirit: I may add
wherein is no excess. No excess? No: for Amoris in Deum modus sine modo sit:
the measure of our love to God must be without measure. Rise up early therefore
to follow this drunkenness, and continue till night, till this wine does
inflame thee. Is. 5. Be mighty to drink this wine, be strong to power in this
strong drink: Look upon this wine, because it is red and shows its color in
the cup, and goes down pleasantly. For Quicquid boni in malo falso
quaeritur, in Deo vere reperitur. Aug. co. li. 2 ca. 6. What good soever men
falsely seek in sin, in God it is truly to be found. Here your Carowses will
be true healths; health of soul, eternal health, and that both to the giver
and to the taker; and therefore the more it is used, the more truly it will
prove you to be true good-fellowes. Suck therefore, and soak your selves in
this Divine Winecellar of grace: by invocation, by gratulation, by
contemplation, by all holy devotion, until the signs of true spiritual
drunkenness do appear in you: For it has also its signs: and though they be
supernatural, yet may they go under natural names; and namely these:
Vomiting, stammering, reeling.

1. Vomiting, for there is a holy vomiting belongs to this heavenly
drunkenness. Namely of sin: For if thou eat at the table of the evil man,
thou shall vomit thy morsells, says Solomon, Pro. 23.8. And that we all do:
In many things we sin all. And this surfeit is so strong, that a little portion
of this heavenly wine of grace, a little measure of this holy drunkenness,
will quickly turn our stomachs and set us a vomiting: By confession, by
contrition, by reformation, by restitution (which implies all the rest.) So
Zachee, when that heavenly Vine, the Son of God, had dropped a little of this
his juice into him, he presently fell into this happy fit: Behold Lord the half
of my goods I give to the poor, and if I have taken any thing from any man by
false accusation, I restore him fourfold. Lu. 19.8. And if thou take not this
spiritual, then beware of that natural vomit, which arises from the surfeit
it self, for that is a bursting one, as that of Judas, which proceeding, not
from this divine, but from his natural, or rather from the infernal spirit,
made him overstrain himself, and burst asunder in the midst, Act. 1.18.

Secondly, the stammering, or faultering, or idle talking, or failing of the
tongue, is a necessary token of our spiritual drunkenness: And it is showed
sometimes in fear, sometimes in joy, sometimes in fervencie of zeal. Sometimes
in fear; as in Hezekiah. Like a Crane or a swallow, so did I chatter Is. 38.14.
Sometime in joy, as in St. Peter Master (says he) let us make here three
Tabernacles, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias; And wist not
what he said. Lu. 9. Sometimes in fervencie of zeal: As in Moses, first making
a stop to his words. If thou will pardon their sin: and then a greater stop
to himself, but if thou will not, I pray thee-raze me out of the book which
thou have written, Exo. 32.32. Such another kind of holy idle talking was that
of St. Paul, Romans 9.3. Pro Christo velle anathema esse a Christo: wishing for
Christ's sake to be separated from Christ: I could wish my self (says he) to
be separated from Christ for my brethren. And no marvel that this diverse
failing of the tongue should appear in our spiritual drunkenness, for St.
Paul (ravished in the spirit) heard, (conceived, apprehended) (...) unspeakable
words not possible to be uttered, 2 Cor. 12.4. And the spirit makes request
(as for us, so no doubt in us) gemitibus ineffabilibus, with sighs and groans
which cannot be expressed, Romans 8.26.

3. A third token to be showed of our spiritual drunkenness, is Reeling; not
of the body, but of the mind: when between grace and nature, yea between grace
and grace, the love of God and of our neighbor, we cannot go steadfastly
without reeling; sometimes to heavenward, sometimes to earth-ward; sometimes
to our own advantage, sometimes to our masters and fellows advantage: sometimes
wishing our work were done, that we might receive our reward, sometimes (for
the greatness of the reward) rejoicing in the doing and continuing of our work.
Such a reeling was St. Paul possessed withal Phil. 1. being in a strait between
two, and not knowing what to choose; desiring to depart, and to be with Christ
which is far better, yet having confidence to abide and continue for the good
of his people. They that sail at sea are subject to reeling: but how? Not
unless the winds do blow; in the calm they feel it not; for at his word the
stormy wind arises, which lifts up the waves thereof; then they are carried
up to the heaven, and down again to the deep, they reel to and fro, and stagger
like a drunken man, and are at their wits end. This world is our sea, and we
are all sailers in it: And so long as we are becalmed of grace, we feel no
reeling, but we are as one that sleeps in the midst of the sea, like him that
sleeps on the top of the mast, Prove. 23. But when that holy wind does blow,
then we are up and down, we know not whether heaven or earth should hold us.

All this while I have but stood at the door of my Text; and no marvail that I
have stood so long, having so glorious a fabric to behold: Now let us
reverently enter, as into the house of God: For we may truly use Jacobs words
here, and say, This is none other but the house of God, and this is the gatef
heaven, Genesis 28.17.

Two things we may especially observe in the Text; the matter, and the manner;
the substance, and the circumstance of the business here related.

The matter and substance is the coming and appearing of the Holy Ghost in
sensible forms. The circumstance is manifold, chiefly it may be referred to the
time when, and the persons to whom this apparition was made. With these points
of the circumstance I will begin so to make way to the substance of the matter,
which is the larger and weighter point and part. First then for the time: And
when the day of Pentecost was fully come.

This day (as it is commonly held) was the day of the publishing the Law upon
Mount Smai: In memory whereof the Jews kept a solemn feast which they commonly
called The feast of weeks, Deuteronomy. 16.10. It got also this name Pentecost,
because of the number of fifty; being fifty days after their Pascha: the
fiftieth day after their coming out of Egypt they received the Law, and that
day they kept this holy feast in remembrance thereof. And this day was the
fiftieth after Christ's resurrection: For it is plain that Christ suffered on
the Jews preparation day of their Passover, and that the Passover that year
fell on the Sabbath, which is therefore called An high day, or the great
Sabbath, Joh. 19.31. and that they reckoned their fifty days from the first
of, or after the Sabbath, Lev. 23.11, 15. which was Christ's rising day, the
first day of their week. So then this Pentecost was the fiftieth day from their
Passover exclusively, and the fiftieth from Christ's resurrection inclusively.
What then?

Behold the truth answerable to the figure; that shadow fulfilled in this
substance. As on the fiftieth day after their Passover, and their deliverance
from corporal bondage under Pharaoh, they received Legem timoris, the Law of
fear upon Mount Sinai, so on the fiftieth after day the accomplishment of our
Passover (the Lamb of God slain and risen) and our deliverance from the
spiritual bondage under Satan, we received Legem amoris, the Law of love upon
Mount Sion: For Christ also is a Lawgiver, even the giver of a new Law, as he
himself speaks Joh. 13.34. A new commandment give I you: What? That ye love
one another. Which yet is not a new, or another Law, but the fulfilling, and
consummation of the old. Love is the fulfilling of the Law, Romans 13.10. The end
of the commandment is love, 1 Timothy 1.5. This Law was given when the Holy Ghost
was given: For, the fruit of the spirit is love, Gal. 5.22. The love of God is
shed abroad in our hearts by the holy Ghost, Romans 5.5. God has not given us
the spirit of fear but of love, 2 Timothy 1.7. This is that Law of liberty
wherewith Christ has made us free, Gal. 5.1. Free in regard of the outward
man, because the inner man is accepted: In my mind I serve the law of God,
though in my flesh the law of sin, Romans 7.25. Free; not in the tie of obedience
which is still upon us, but in the tax of disobedience (that is punishment)
which he has taken from us: Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the Law,
being made, a curse for us, Gal. 3.13.

Well then brethren, ye see your calling; the sum of all is love; Love the Lord
thy God with all thy heart; love thy neighbor as thy self: the sincerity of
the inside, Truth in the inward parts, Psalm. 51.6. For he is an Israelite
indeed in whom there is no guile, Joh. 3. 47. Truth of heart supplyeth defect
of hand; for, ye are called into liberty, Gal. 5.13. The law of the spirit of
life in Christ Jesus has freed us from the law of sin and death, Romans 8.2. And
where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty, 2 Cor. 3.17. Stand fast
therefore in this liberty of love, Gal. 5.1. As free, and not having the
liberty for a cloak of malitiousness, but as the servants of God, 1 Pet 2. Not
usin your liberty as an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another,
Gal. 5 13. For indeed Love is the bond of perfectness, Col. 3.14. binding not
only us one to another (for, the unity of the spirit is in the bond of peace,
Ephesians. 4.3.) but binding us unto God, and God unto us: For, he that dwells in
love dwells in God, and God in him, 1 John 4.16. and that not for a time, but
for ever: For this Law is not written with ink, or in tables of stone
corruptibly, but in fleshly tables of the heart, yea in the immortal table of
the soul incorruptibly: For though tongues cease, or knowledge vanish away, yet
love never falls away, 1 Cor. 13. Now abides Faith, Hope, Love, but the
chief of these is Love: For Faith apprehends the promise, hope attends the
matter, but Love seals and assures, confirms and strengthens both.

Again; this coming of the Holy Ghost was the fiftieth day after Christ's
Resurrection, and therefore the tenth day after his Ascension; for he ascended
not till the fortieth day, Act. 1.3. and then he made his last promise of this
which he now performed; Ye shall be baptized with the holy Ghost not many days
hence. Act. 1.5. He deferred it till the tenth day, and on the tenth day he
fulfilled it.

He deferred it till the tenth day, that they might be exercised with
expectation, and whetted with delay: For Gods delays are nothing else but
whettings: His delay of judgments to the wicked is a whetting of his anger:
For, if a man will not turn, he will whet his sword, Psalm. 7.13. Yea, he will
fourbish it that it may consume, Ezekiel. 21.28. But his delay of grace to his
children is a whetting to their zeal: For the Physician by restraint of diet
gains stomach, health, and strength unto his patient: And God (who best
knows what is best for us) by denying, or by deferring grace, oftentimes
gives grace unto his children. Else why did not St. Paul's threefold petition
prevail for his deliverance from that buffeting messenger of Satan, but that
he might receive a sufficiency of grace to strengthen him? 2 Cor. 12. And else
why did the prayer of the woman of Canaan suffer likewise a threefold repulse?
but even to whet her importunity and constancy, that at the last she might
receive that acclamation, O woman, great is thy faith, Mat. 15.28.

Again, as until the tenth day, so no longer then the tenth day did Christ
defer his promise, but on that day he did fulfill it: for, God is not slack, as
some men count slackness, 2 Pet. 3.9. Not so slack as to forget his promise:
Has he said, and shall he not do it? has he spoken, and shall he not
accomplish it? Numb. 23.19. No, but heaven and earth shall sooner pass away,
Patientia est non negligentia. Aug. de ver. ap. ser. 20.
then one jot or tittle of his word shall fail. He is slow to anger, and long
suffering to the wicked, to exercise his own patience. He may be also slow in
comforting and rewarding his children, that he may exercise their patience: He
may be long sometimes, but he is always true, sure, and certain in his longest
delay. Fear and tremble therefore thou that art forborne in sin, thou do
but heap up wrath against the day of wrath. God has leaden feet, but iron
hands: he is slow to punish, but severe in punishing. But be not afraid in the
day of grace and mercy: for, blessed are they that hunger and thirst after
righteousness; for they shall be satisfied, Mat. 5.6. He that has begun this
good work in you will perform it, Phil. 1.6. In due season ye shall reap, if ye
faint not, Gal. 16.9.

But the especial cause (no doubt) for this time taken for this great matter
(the coming of the holy Ghost) was, because of the greatness of the feast, and
muchness of the assembly; to the intent that the greater good might be done,
and with the greater speed. This was Christ's common practice; he was born in
private, and so indeed he lived for a while; but when his time of revealing
himself was come, he frequented the solemnest assemblies, and thrust himself
into the thickest throngs. What feast was there which he went not unto? Ye will
say he went not up openly but privately to the Jews feast of Tabernacles, Joh.
7.10. True, yet not with intent to hide, but to proclaim himself there; for,
when half the feast was done, he went up into the temple and taught, ver. 14.
And in the last, and great day of the Feast he stood and cried, saying, If any
man thirst let him come unto me and drink, ver. 37. He suffered at the feast of
Passover, and had his title written over him in three languages for public
notice sake. He sent the gift of the holy Ghost at the feast of Pentecost, one
of the three solemn feasts of the year, when all the males must appear before
the Lord, Exodus 23.17. that his Gospel might be suddenly, and largely spread.
Thus Wisdom cries without, and utters her voice in the streets, Prove. 1.20.
The Wisdom, the Word, the Son of God takes all occasions to gather many unto
him, and to do public good.

Let not this love then want acceptance, neither let his example want
observance; let not his love want acceptance, but as he freely calls, so let
us freely come and flee, and flock unto him, as the Doves unto their windows.
Is. 60.8. And let not his example want observance, To do good, and to
distribute forget not, Heb. 13.16. Whiles we have time let us do good unto all
men, Gal. 6.10. Not seeking our own profit, but the profit of many, that they
may be saved. 1 Cor. 10.33.

So much of the time. The other circumstance is the persons or parties; They
were altogether with one accord in one place. We may note their quality who
they were, and their exercise, whereabout they were.

1. Who they were: It appears in the whole passage of the former Chapter:
Namely the Apostles and Disciples, who were to publish the Gospel, and to be
pillars and foundation-stones of the Christian Church: Ye are built upon the
foundation of the Apostles and Prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief
corner stone, Ephesians. 2.20. Behold their exaltation; behold their humiliation.

Behold their exaltation: Their calling is high; They are laborers together
with God, 1 Cor. 3.9. Their indowment also is high, they are endowed with God,
they have a visible receipt of God the Holy Ghost: Kings do command bodies,
states, lives: yea even of these that are so eminent (I mean the priestly
order.) For the King is supreme, 1. Pet 2.13. Therefore they are crowned with
crowns of Gold, enriched with gemms: But these were to rule, yea, to raise and
revive souls, and therefore are crowned with such a Crown as never was any but
the King of Kings, even the visible Crown of the Holy Ghost. The Prophet Elijah
was carried up into Heaven by fire; whether natural or supernatural, true or
seeming, it may be doubted: But these Priests, even upon earth, both were
carried by, and did carry the true celestial fire, the holy Ghost. God was the
portion of the Leviticall priesthood by way of inheritance and remuneration:
And the Holy Ghost is the portion of the Christian priesthood, by way of
existence of exhibition, of inhabitation, and of operation. Behold their honor
then, and deny not that the elders that rule well are worthy of double Honor.
Yea though any of us (in himself) deserve dishonor, yet let our calling be
honored for this prime honors sake.

Again, behold their humiliation: For, that they might minister, they are first
ministered unto: that they might give, they do first receive. They have a
commission, but they may not put it in execution until it be sealed. They were
to give and minister the Holy Ghost, by predication, Go preach the Gospel to
every Creature, Mar. 16.15. by ordination. I left thee in Creet that thou
should ordain Elders in eevry City, Tit. 1.5. by absolution; Whose sins ye
remit, they are remitted, whose sins ye retain, they are retained, Joh.
20.23. Therefore that they might minister in this eminent manner, they must
receive this excellent measure: they must have their mission filled, and their
commission sealed with that great broad seal of Heaven. And therein is their
humiliation: For it teaches them not to run before they are sent, nor (like
Ahimaaz, 2 Sams 18.) to be importunate to be sent, when they have no word put
in their mouth, nor any tidings to tell ( For no man takes this honor to
himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron, Heb. 5.4.) but rather to
say with Moses, who am I that I should go? Exodus 3.11. and with Saint Paul,
who is sufficient for these things? 2. Cor. 2.16. and with Isaiah, to expect
some of that heavenly fire, A cole from the Altar, to touch their lips, before
they say, Here am I, send me. Is 6.6. And it may teach both them, and others
for them, to acknowledge that they are but sawes and axes, instruments in the
hand of the workman. And that neither he that planteth is any thing, nor he
that waters, but God that gives the increase, 1. Cor. 3.7. Yea, that we have
this treasure in earthen Vessels, that the excellency of that power might be
of God, and not of us. 2. Cor. 4.7.

And so much of their quality, who they were.

Secondly, note their exercise whereabout they were; They were all with one
accord in one place.

Here is no business expressed, but no doubt it was not for idleness, much
less for ill exercise that they were together, but for that which did belong
unto their calling; as is mentioned, ver. 46. But especially (no doubt) their
business was, the expectation of this which now was fulfilled, even to observe
that charge that was given them, that they should not depart from Jerusalem,
but wait for the promise of the Father, Act. 1.4. And in this business they
sat, and the Holy Ghost came, and sat upon each of them. Behold then there is
Unity, Quietness, Diligence, Fidelity, Constancy.

First, here is Unity one with another: They were all with one accord in one
place: Behold the spirit of Unity rejoices in Unity: The spirit of wisdom is
loving. Wisd. 1.6. And the first fruit of the spirit is love, Gal. 5.22. This
loving spirit therefore, descended upon them that were united in love; to show
if that we dwell in love, we dwell in God, and God will be ready to dwell in us.

Secondly, here is quietness: They were in no commotion or hurly burly, but
quiet in themselves, and one with another: They sat; therefore the spirit of
rest, here takes up his rest. The spirit of trouble delights in trouble, he
is a compasser, he compasses the Earth: Job. 17. he takes no rest, neither
does he desire to find it: but delights, in compassing heads, and troubled
minds, that do weary themselves in the way of wickedness. But where the
spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty: Peace, Quietness, and freedom from
trouble. The Dove could find no rest for the sole of her foot, while the
troubled waters endured: but the raven continued going and coming, from her
first going forth, Genesis 8. For the carcasses and carions tossed in waters were
her fittest rest. Now the wicked are the raging waves of the Sea foaming out
their own shame, Jude 13. They are like the raging Sea that cannot rest, whose
waters cast up mire and dirt, Is. 57.20. therefore on them the golden feathered
Dove of Heaven setleth not, but the black devouring vulture of hell sets up
his rest.

Thirdly, here is diligence: They give not themselves to sleepy or idle rest,
but to such exercises as belong to their calling; therefore they receive the
hope of their calling, Ephesians. 4.4. For as God is an austere man to idle and
unprofitable servants, so to the vigilant and diligent, he is not only
liberal in honoring. Lu. 16.21. Euge, Well done good and faithful servant;
and in rewarding: Enter thou into thy masters joy. Mat. 25. but also kind and
loving in ministering: He will gird himself about, and make them sit down to
meat, and will come forth and serve them. Lu. 12. Blessed therefore are both
these, and all those servants whom their Lord when he comes shall find so
doing: even exercised in the charge that their Master shall give them.

Fourthly, here is Faithfulness: They had a charge given; to that they are
obedient; they had a promise made; In that they are confident. Therefore
according to their Faith, so is it unto them: And as they believe, so do they
receive. Faithful is he that promises, Heb. 10.23. God is faithful, 1 Cor.
10.13. Faithful therefore also must he be that receives: Men must be faithful,
He that comes to God must believe, not only that God is, but that he is
arewarder of them that seek hm, Heb 11.6. He that will receive, must ask in
faith and waver not. Jam. 1. And he that will be received, must be received in
Faith. So Philip answered the Eunuch, when he would be baptized. If thou
believe with all thy heart, thou may. Act. 8.36. For Christ both in his
word and in his work, is unavailable to the unfaithful. He is the end of the
Law for righteousness: How? to every one that believes, Romans 10.4. He could
there (in his own Country) do no great works: Why? not because his giving hand
failed, but because their receiving hand failed. Because of their unbelief,
Mar. 6.5. For in giving and ministering there must be also receiving, they are
relative works, and cannot be one without the other.

Fifthly, here is Constantness: For (as asoresaid) this was the tenth day of
their expectation and had it been tenfold ten, no doubt it had been but as one
to them, they would have bidden without grudging unto the end; both for their
loves sake, and for their trusts sake.

For their loves sake: For every Jacob thinks two apprentiships (one of the
body and soul above ground, another of the body under ground) to be but a
little while, for the love of his Rachel, his desired happiness.

And for their trusts sake; because they knew that that the Lord is not slack
concerning his promise, Pet. 3.9. but that all his promises are, yea and Amen.
2 Cor. 1.20. And without repentance, Romans 11.20. Therefore they run not as at
an uncertain thing: their labor is not in vain in the Lord: Their constancy is
crowned at the last.

Be patient therefore brethren unto the coming of the Lord: behold the
husbandman waits for the precious fruit of the Earth, and has long patience
until he receive the former and the later rain. Be ye therefore also patient,
and settle your hearts, for the coming of the Lord draws near. Jam. 5.6. And
let us not be weary of well doing, for in due time we shall reap if we faint
not. Gal. 6.9. Remember Lots wife, and look not back. Lu. 17. For no wan that
puts his hand to the plough, and looks back, is apt for the Kingdom of
Heaven. Lu. 9. But he that continues to the end shall be saved. Mat. 10. Be
faithful unto the death, and I will give thee the Crown of life. Rev. 2.10.

So much of the circumstances of this business, the Time and the Persons, or
Parties.

The second chief part or branch of this text, is the substance or matter of
the business related: that is the coming of the Holy Chost in sensible forms.

The coming of the Holy Ghost? why? was not the Holy Ghost come till now?
Indeed it is said, Joh. 7.39. The Holy Ghost was not yet given, because Jesus
was not yet glorified. Yet it cannot be denied, but that the Holy Ghost was
given before: For in old time holy men of God, spoke as they were inspired by
the Holy Ghost. 2 Pet. 1.21. But he was not come or given in comparison of this
coming or giving. Why? Not in like manner: Not in like measure: Not to like
end.

Not in like manner: For before, he was given inwardly, but now outwardly:
before, secretly, now openly. Before invisibly, now visibly: Before quoad
potentiam and efficaciam, in respect of power and efficacy, now quoad
praesentiam and apparitionem, in respect of presence and appearance. Before
suddenly, now upon promise and expectation: So that Christ's words inverted, may
be hither applied. The kingdom of God is come with observation. Lu. 7.20. So
that now men might say, lee here, or lo there. For the Kingdom of God is not
only within them, but without them and upon them, totally possessing and
compassing them.

Not in like measure: For before, it was here and there, to one or to a few at
once, but now to a multitude, and in a multitude, or magnitude. To a multitude:
For there were 120. together, Chap. 1. ver. 15. In multitude: for they were all
filled. Chap. 2. ver. 4. yea so abundantly filled, that each one was able to
fill multitudes: For by Saint Peter's preaching the same day there were added to
the Church about 3000. souls, ver. 41. Thus this heavenly fire (hid since the
world began, and from all ages. Col. 1.26.) now breaking forth, shows most
heat and light. Thus our Zacheus (for that name whether you expound it Just or
Pure, may well stand for him who is the fountain of all Justice and purity)
recompenseth his former hoording and sparing, by giving fourfold. Thus the holy
and precious oil of gladness, powered upon the head of the Church, runs
down to the skirts of his clothing, even to all his members and parts. For
(says Saint Peter here, ver. 16.) This is that which was spoken by the Prophet
Joel: And it shall be in the last days (says God) that I will power out of my
spirit upon all flesh. And this is that which is cited. Heb. 8.11. They shall
not teach every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know ye
the Lord, for all such know me, from the least of them to the greatest.

Thirdly, not to like end, was the Holy Ghost before come or given. For before,
he was given to foretell things to come, and to be done, now to tell and
declare things done and finished. Before, to set forth the shadow of good
things to come, now to minister the substance of the things themselves. Before,
to teach men, but now (we may say in some sort) to teach Angels. For now unto
principalities and powers in heavenly places, is made known by the Church the
manifold wisdom of God. Ephesians. 3.10. And in the ministry of the Gospel, the
things are now showed which the Angels desire to behold. 1. Pet. 1.12. Before
it was to prepare the bride for the marriage of the Lamb; Now it is to keep the
keys of the bridechamber door, to bind and loose, open and shut. I will give
thee the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, and whatsoever thou shall bind on
Earth shall be bound in Heaven, and whatsoever thou shall loose on Earth shall
be loosed in Heaven, says Christ to Saint Peter. Mat. 16.19. For which causes
(I doubt not) it is, that the least of the Kingdom of God; that is (as
aforesaid) after this third and full revelation of the Trinity, is said to be
greater then John the Baptist, whose time was but a little before it. Mat.
11.11.

What follows then for our instruction, out of this enlargement of the holy
Spirit to us? but this, that we also be enlarged in the holiness of our
spirits unto him, that as he has abounded unto us, so we may abound unto him,
and that as he to us, so we to him be renewed. In our manner, Not with eye-
service, as men-pleasers, but heartily as to the Lord. Col. 3.23. In our
measure, Rich in faith, rich in good works. In our end, Not minding earthly
things, but having our conversation in heaven, Phil. 3.20.

But how was this new, and great coming of the Holy Ghost? It was in, or under
signs and figures, types and emblems: For the Son came to take our nature,
because he was to stand in our room, to act our cause: therefore his coming
must be hypostaticall; he must be that he seems to be; The Word was made flesh,
Joh. 1. But the Holy Ghost was to renew us into his nature, that we might be
partakers of the godly nature, 2 Pet. 1.4. therefore it suffices that his
coming be symbolicall, not becoming, or being what he shows, but showing what
he is, his properties and effects: As excellently here he does in three
notable symboles or signs: Namely, Wind, Fire, and Tongues: And suddenly there
came a sound from heaven, as of a rushing and a mighty wind, etc.

To seek all the agreements between these shaddows, and their substance, were
to attempt that impossibility 2 Esd. 4.5. Weigh me the weight of the fire, or
measure me the blast of the wind. Expect not all then, but be content with
some. And first of the wind.

The Wind has two especial properties, Secretness and Activeness.

First Secretness, and that both in its arising, and its working.

1. Secretnesse in its arising; It is so secret that it cannot be known: for I
will rather believe Christ who tells me that I cannot tell whence it comes,
or whither it goes, Joh. 3.8. then I would yield to the wisdom of man, if all
Philosophers could (as indeed they cannot) agree together, to tell me from
whence it comes: God brings them out of his treasures, Ps. 135.7. No doubt
out of those treasures of light and and might, knowledge and power; the light
which no man can attain unto, 1 Timothy 6.16.

And secondly it has Secretness in its working too: for it unsensibly pierces
the sensible joints and bones, Zephyrus, quasi (...): vitam ferens.
and works sensible refreshing on the unsensible herbs and plants. And to the
Holy Ghost also is secretnesse proper, both in his beginning, or arising, and
in his working. In his beginning; for we say he has a beginning of
personality, though not of nature: A beginning from the Father and the Son; not
in time (being coeternall) but by proceeding: Whereof, the proceeding of the
stream from the fountain, of the heat from the fire, and of the light from the
sun, is all too short and weak expressions; and yet these in time we are still
together.

And in his working also he is secret, Entering in to the dividing asunder of
the soul and the spirit, and the joints and the marrow, Heb. 4.12. And (as the
true Zephyrus) breathing breath of lives upon all the plants which the heavenly
father has planted; and that unsensibly (as the wind) blowing when, and where,
and how he lists.

The former secrecy is for our admiration; the greater it is, the farther we
must stand from it: For, qui scrutatur majestatem, opprimetur a gloria: He that
searches Gods majesty, shall be oppressed of his glory: It is enough to cry
out, O the deepness of this secret.

The latter is for our examination: for, we must prove our selves whether we
are in the faith or no, 2 Cor. 13.5. If we live in the spirit, we must walk in
the spirit, Gal. 5.25. And as many as are led by the spirit of God, they are
the sons of God, Rom 8.14.

Again, Activenesse also is another property of the wind: It is active
constantly, strongly, subtly, variously.

1. Constantly; for it is always in motion, its being consists in action:
for it is not wind if it do not blow: And though it be not in all places
always alike perceived, yet never can it be said to be in no place at all.

2. Strongly: for it bends the pliant plants, but breaks or overturneth the
stiff and sturdy oaks.

3. Subtly; for it finds the chafe in the midst of the wheat, and
purges and scatters it quite away.

4. Variously; for it brings, sometimes lightning, sometimes rain; sometimes
from the East, sometimes from the West, sometimes from the North, sometimes
from the South. It always cools, and for the most part clears the air. And
this activenesse is also proper to the Holy Ghost in all these kinds.

He works first Constantly: for what is true of the Son, is also true of the
Holy Ghost, My Father works hitherto, and I work, Joh. 5.17. For in all works
( ad extra) the Trinity is undivided. He was active in the Creation; The spirit
of God moved upon the waters, Genesis 1.2. He is active also in the Regeneration,
Joh 3.5. Except a man be born of water, and of the spirit he cannot enter into
the Kingdom of heaven.

2. Strongly; for he plyeth the humble to the bent of his will, and breaks
the stubborn from the strength of their own will: Is. 42.1. I have put my
spirit upon him: What then? A bruised reed shall he not break: He shall but
bend the humble: yet he shall bring forth judgment unto victory: he shall
overthrow the stubborn. This wind breaks the Cedars, even the Cedars of
Lebanon, Ps. 29.5.

3. Subtly; for he purges both the companies, and the consciences of men:
evil persons outwardly, evil desires inwardly are the chafe which this wind
scatters away: His fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly purge his floor,
Mat. 3.12.

4. Variously: for he brings sometimes flashes of elevation, Elijahs Chariot:
sometimes showers of humiliation, Peter's tears: He brings forth the lightning
with the rain, Ps. 135.7. He blows with his wind, and the waters flow, Psalm.
147.8. Sometimes from the East, by opening the bloody rising of original sin:
sometimes from the West, by reflecting the bloody setting of the Sun of
righteousness: sometimes from the South, through the warm and calm gale of
peace and prosperity: sometimes from the North, thorough the blustering blasts
of persecution and trial. It cools, and refreshes the conscience by
quenching the scalding heat of concupiscence, and clears it from clouds,
mists, and fogs of sin, and from ignorance, the cause, and from fear the effect
thereof, by bringing in true light the Sun of Faith, the Moon of Hope, the
Stars of Charity.

O hearken then for the motion of this active wind: It is not idle in it self,
let it not be idle unto thee: Receive not the grace of God in vain, but rather
cry and call, Arise, O North, and come, O South, and blow upon my garden, that
the spices thereof may flow forth, Can. 4. that so awaiting, and desiring it,
thou may not only hear the sound of it, but be carried away in the force of
it; yea be turned into it (for that which is born of the spirit is spirit) That
thou may be made active as it is active: Constantly, that thou be not weary
of well doing, Gal. 6. Strongly, that in all things thou be more then
conqueror, Romans 8. Subtly, that thou try all things, and choose that which is
best, Phil. 1. Variously, that thy love may abound yet more and more, that thou
may sow liberally, and reap also liberally, 2 Cor. 9.

And so much of the first sign or symbol; The wind: the second is the Fire.

As in the wind, so in the fire also I observe two properties well agreeing to
the Holy Ghost, namely light, and heat.

First, Light, is a natural property of the fire, of our common fire: For
indeed the elementary fire in its own sphere shines not because of its
subtilnesse, and the infernal fire of hell shines not because of its
grossnesse: yet our fire (being of a mixed nature) has light as well as heat:
Light to show it self to us, us to our selves, others to us, us to others, and
to discover and manifest all.

And this also is proper to this Heavenly fire: even Light. The holy Spirit
(though in his own sphere he is so subtle) in his own nature so pure, that he
cannot be visible, for No man has seen God at any time, yet is he come down to
us in light, and has brought us Lumen superius, Interius, Exterius, Upper,
Inner, Outward light.

1. Lumen superius: light to see God, that is Faith. The natural light can
show to the eye but colors or superficies, not substances. But this light
shows to the Soul him that is the substance of all things, In whom we live,
and move, and have our being. Act. 27.28. In whom all things consist. Col.
1.17. For by this light Moses saw him who is invisible. Heb. 11.27. and by this
light all the godly do walk: We walk by faith, not by sight. 2 Cor 5.7.

2. Lumen interius, Inner light: that is Conscience. Ye were once darkness,
but now are light in the Lord. Ephesians. 5.8. Why? The reason goes before, there
ver. 5. for this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous
man, who is an idolater has any inheritance in the Kingdom of Christ, and of
God. Ye were darkness when ye knew not that, now are ye light, now ye do
know it. This is that light which God sent by Saint Paul. To open their eyes
that they might turn from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to
God. Act. 26.18. This is that rejoicing light. 2 Cor. 1.12. Our rejoicing is
this, the testimony of our Conscience. This is that humbling light that shows
the vileness of our condition natural. Dust thou art, and to dust thou shall
return. Genesis 3. And the miserableness of our condition spiritual: I was
shapen in wickedness, and in sin has my mother conceived me. Ps. 51.

3. Lumen exterius, Outer light, that is, charity: He that says he is in the
light, and yet hates his brother, is in darkness until this time: he that
loves his brother abides in the light. 1. Joh. 2.9. This light makes us see
all men alike, so that we have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ in
respect of persons, Jam. 2.1. that we be ready to honor all men, and to despise
none. This light helps us to see the necessities of our brethren, that we may
relieve them, Charity is bountiful, 1 Cor 13.4. To take notice of the
infirmities of our brethren, that we may bear them. Restore such a one in the
spirit of meekness, bear ye one another burden. Gal. 6.1. To observe the
faults of our brethren that we may reprove them: Have no fellowship with the
unfruitful works of darknsse, but even reprove them rather. Ephesians. 5.11. Yea,
this light will guide us so to look on, and to follow the foremost, that we
our selves shall become lights and leaders of the hindmost: Phil. 3.17. Shining
as lights in the world, and holding forth the word of life. Phil. 2.13. Yea,
this light will keep us from glosing and coloring, and make us shine clearly
and truly, even to be indeed what we seem in show: For all things when they are
reproved of (this) light, are manifest, for it is (this) light that makes all
things manifest. Ephesians. 5.13. What then? Seeing that this light is come into the
world, let us not love darkness more then light, Joh. 3.19. Ye are all the
children of the light, and of the day, we are not of the night, neither of the
darkness. 1 These. 5.5. Where then is our Lumen superius? our knowledge of God?
Are we not either like owls, hiding us from this light, or like flies playing
with it, or presuming too near it? Where is our Lumen interius? our knowledge
of our self? Are we not like the blind Sodomites groping in our own streets?
Genesis 19. like the blind Aramites, that went they knew not whither,
notwithstanding, the Lords Prophet did lead them? 2 King. 6. Where is our Lumen
exterius, our knowledge of our neighbor? May not St. Paul's words be inverted?
Henceforth know we no man after the flesh. 2 Cor. 5.16. May we not invert it,
and say, Hitherto have we known no man but after the flesh; with fleshly
affections to carnal ends, and temporal turns. O beloved let us not make so
much abuse of light, but walk while we have light, lest darkness come upon us.
Joh. 12.30. For the night comes when no man can work. Joh. 9.4. the night of
persecution: the night of loss of outward senses, the night of loss of inward
senses, the night of age, the night of death, the night of judgment. Diverse
kinds of night do hang over our head, we know not how soon our light may be
put out in obscure darkness. Pro. 20.20. Only this we know that no darkness
can hide us from God; for the darkness and the light with him are both alike.
Ps. 139.12. Yea we niay well fear that if we turn his light into darkness
now, he will again turn our darkness into light, he will lighten things hid
in darkness, and make the counsels of the heart manifest. 1. Cor. 4.5. And
that is enough to our shame before men, by the present light and fiery trial of
the spirit and of the word. Every mark shall be made manifest, for the day
shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire. 1 Cor. 3.13. but
especially to our confusion before men and Angels; When the Lord Jesus shall
show himself from heaven with his mighty Angels in flaming fire, rendering
vengeance to them that know not God. 2. These. 1.7.

Again, Heat also is another property of the fire, and that of diverse kinds and
uses. 1. Heat reviving. 2. Heat consuming. 3. Heat hardening. 4. Heat softning.
5. Heat drying. 6. Heat moistning. 7. Heat increasing and decreasing by the
wind.


All these are kinds of heat and proper to the fire, and are well agreeing
also to this our Heavenly fire, the Holy Ghost.

1. He yields heat reviving. Does not the fire revive frozen creatures? and
what cold so strong as the death of sin? And yet from that, by this heat of the
spirit men are revived. You has he quickened which were dead in trespasses and
sin Ephesians. 2.1. Gehazi with his masters staff could not revive the Shunamites
Son, 2 King. 4. For the staff was dead it self and cold, and had no warmth in
it: But the Prophet himself coming, and his warmth applied, the child revived;
which is allegorized thus: that Moses by the Law could not, but Christ by the
spirit does revive sin; dead mankind. Yea indeed Moses made but the smoke of
this fire: The smoke must go before the fire. The smoke smothereth, the fire
quickneth. So the Law must go before the Gospel; that stroke us dead, but this
reviveth us again. The letter kills, but the spirit gives life. 2 Cor. 3.6.

2. Heat consuming: The fire consumes and turns all into ashes, and by ashes
it is preserved, and out of ashes again revived. And the heat of this heavenly
fire consumes all worldliness and fleshlinesse, and makes all as ashes by the
memory of death. For this was Abraham's confession: I am dust and ashes, Genesis
18. Yea, this was David's meditation. I have eaten ashes as it were bread. Ps.
102.9. And by this ashes, is this fire preserved, and out of it again revived,
even as the Phoenix out of her own ashes. The fires heat consumes drossy, and
dry things; yet so as it refineth and purifieth the precious metal: And this
our God the Holy Ghost is a consuming fire. Heb. 12.29. How? To purge the
corruptions of nature, I will purely purge thy dross, and take away thy tin.
Is. 1.25. and to refine the perfections of nature, that they may shine as Gold
in the furnace. Wis. 3.6. and as silver seven times tried in the fire. Ps.
12.6. This is that fire that burns only the bonds of Gods Children, and
makes them (like those three in the fiery furnace, Dan. 3.) of bound become
free, and to walk at liberty, even in the glorious liberty of the sons of
God. And this Divine fire purges that hellish fire of the tongue. Jam. 3.6. As
Phaetons inflammation was said to be quenched by lighting: Et saevis compescuit
ignibus ignes: one fire was stricken out with another.

3. Heat hardening: Does not the fires heat harden the potters ware, and make it
of weak and limber clay to become stiff and strong, to serve the uses of the
house? And we are Gods clay, and he is our Potter: Is. 64.8. and through the
fervent heat of this Heayenly fire, we of weak are made strong: Heb. 11.34.
Even vessels of honor sanctified and meet for the Masters use, and prepared
unto every good work. 2 Timothy 2.21. even serviceable to the most honorable use
of the house, even to hold in martyrdom. For so Saint Peter, before the
sending down of this fire was weak clay, easily molded (unmoulded rather) from
his profession by the objection of a silly maid: But he and his fellows (after
this fire had past upon them and thoroughly seasoned them) became so strong,
that they rejoiced that they were counted worthy to suffer for Christ's name.
Act. 5.41.

4. Heat-softning: Does not the fire soften the hardest metal, iron, and
steel, and make it yield to the hammer, and to be pliable to the workmans
purpose? yea to become liquid to melt, and run like wax or water? And the heat
of this Heavenly fire mollifyeth the hardest hearts, that they may be wrought
by the hammer of the word, yea, makes them even like wax that melts in the
fire: I am powered out like water (says David) my heart is like wax, it is even
molten in the midst of my bowels. Ps. 22.14.

5. Heat drying: Does not the Suns heat dry the fields, and make them choppe
and cleave, and gape for rain? And this Heavenly descending from above, makes
our souls dry, to thirst after righteousness: to be athirst for God; Even like
a barren and dry land where no water is: until we receive the former and
latter rain. My soul gaspeth after thee (says David) even as a thirsty land,
Ps. 143.6.

6. Heat moistning: Does not the heat of the Sun exhale moist clouds from the
Earth and Waters, and dissolve the same again into showers and dewes? And does
not the heat of the limbeck, make water drop out of such things; from which
(otherwise) it could hardly or never be extracted? And this celestial heat
that exhaleth clouds of water into the head, and distilleth them in tears:
even such clouds as drop fatness, and are as the dew of Hermon which fell upon
the hill of Sion, and come down like the rain into a fleece of wool: Even like
that rain upon Gideons fleece which was to assure him of the Victory, Judge. 6.
This exhalation, this distillation (no doubt) have many of the Saints felt: As
Peter, who went forth, and wept bitterly, Mat. 26. Mary Magdalen, who washed
Christ's feet with her tears, Luke 7. And David, who every night washed his bed,
and watered his couch with his tears, Ps. 6.

7. Heat increasing, and decreasing by the wind. Does not the fire increase or
abate by the wind, respectively according to the nature or quality of the
subject or matter wherein it is? sometimes blown in, sometimes blown out by one
and the same kind of blast. And so indeed this fire of the spirit is sometimes
increased, sometimes decreased by the Word. The Disciples going to Emaus
hearing Christ, their hearts did burn within them, Luke 24.32. there it was
kindled by the wind. But Ahab hearing Michaiah, hated him, 1 Kings. 22. and the
Jews hearing Stephen, were cut to the heart, Act. 7.54. there it was quenched
by the wind.

And why? the fire works not alike in every subject, therefore the same Word
that is the savor of life unto life, is also the savor of death unto death in
diverse men, 2 Cor. 2.16.

O heat unsearchable in faculty, incomprehensible in variety, irresistible in
efficacy: What pains should we take in seeking it? What joy should we make in
finding it? what care should we show in keeping it? For what comfort can we
have inwardly, or yield outwardly? what growth, what health, what life can
there be without it? Woe be then unto us if we have no sense or feeling of it,
or but falsely in a wrong kind, and the quite contrary way: Namely, if in what
we should be revived, hardened, dried, increased, even in that we be consumed,
softened, moystned, decreased: or, if instead of gaining the heat, we have only
stolen the light of this fire, to shine only instead of burning, and that but
in the dark like gloworms, meteors, rotten wood. Then such lack, or abuse of
heavenly fire here, will but prepare and entitle us to hellish fire hereafter.
If ignis fatuus, hypocrisy, be our practice here, ignis furens, tormenting
fire, shall be our portion there. If light without heat content us here, heat
without light shall discontent us there; even unquenchable fire in utter
darkness.

3. But how does this fire appear? In the form or shape of cloven tongues: This
is the third symbol: And there appeared unto them cloven tongues.

Tongues.

Tongues cloven.

First, Tongues. Very notably and excellently does the Holy Ghost express and
exhibit himself in the figure of a Tongue, whether you respect the work, or the
instrument of that work which he now intends.

1. The work? what is it? The work of Regeneration, the making of new man,
which is the making of true man. For man though true made at first, was now
marred, and had need to be new'd, and (as I may say) tru'd again. What then?
behold a lively figure of this holy work. What? A Tongue. A Tongue the figure
of a true man? Yes, a more lively one cannot be devised: For, wherein
consists the truth of a man but in his tongue? whether ye take truth properly
in its natural sense, or for the perfection of any other good: For truth it
self, where is it if it be not in the Tongue? And where else also is the
perfection of any good? Take the four Cardinal virtues, Prudence, Temperance,
Justice, Fortitude, where is the perfection of each of them but in their
expression? and where is that but in the tongue? Ye will say, they all
(especially Fortitude) seem rather to belong to the hand. No, no, the hand is
but the tongues servant, and but a blind one too, it does nothing but by
command and direction from the tongue. And what act so strong or great was
there ever performed by the hand, which has not been matched or excelled by the
tongue? Cyneas plures dicendo qua m Pyrrhus dimicando subegit.
Cedant armatog, concedat laurea linguae: Strength must yield to eloquence, the
faculty of the hand to the faculty of the tongue. Bring man to the touchstone,
search his substance to the quick; Is it not in his tongue? For what
differenceth man from beast? Ratio and oration, reason and speech: and speech is
the flower of reason, without speech reason is but a dumb show. Yea what
differenceth man from man but speech? Stulto intelligens quid interest? What Is
the difference between a wise man and a fool? Ask Socrates, and he will say,
Loquere ut te videam, speak that I may see thee: he will find a man's substance
in his tongue. Ask Solomon, and he will say, A fool when he holds his peace
is counted wise, Prove. 17.28. He knows no difference but in the tongue. In a
word, does not David reduce a man's whole perfection to his tongue, when he
calls it his glory? Ps. 59.7. Awake up my glory. If therefore all the Magi of
the East, all the old Egyptian and Chaldaean Wise men were alive again to
exercise their Hieroglyphick art, to make holy Sculptures, dumb shows and
figures, speaking signs to tell their eye their meaning, they could not devise
a more fit character to signify a man then a tongue. A tongue is a lively
hieroglyphick of a man, because by his tongue a man's substance is expressed.

Behold then this holy workmaster by this figure shows what work he intends,
he comes to renew man into his perfection, he comes therefore in the likeness
of tongues.

O come hither and consider this all ye that abuse your tongues to lying and
falsehood, to vanity and sin: What are ye? not men but monsters, devils
incarnate: Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil? Joh. 6.20.
Good men's tongues are sparks of heavenly fire, but wicked men's tongues are
sparks of hellish fire: The tongue is a fire, it is set on fire of hell, Jam.
3.6. Is not every man distinguished by his tongue, and known what country man
he is? And do not our tongues also discover us whether we belong to heaven or
hell? Away then thou profane swearer, thou false liar, thou ribald talker,
away from Christ, and from his spirit: Have thou nothing to do with that just
man: Thou art none of them; for thy speech bewrays thee. Say shibboleth:
Learn the language of Canaan, speak edifying words that may minister grace unto
the hearers. Can thou not so pronounce? then thou art a rebellious
Ephraimite, thou art to be cut off from the congregation of Israel. And may I
not here especially, and most properly speak to the Doctors of equivocation,
even in the invective words of St. Stephen? Ye stiff-necked, and of
uncircumcised hearts and ears, ye have always resisted the Holy Ghost, as did
your fathers, so do ye, Act. 7.51. The holy Ghost intends to make new men,
and true men, therefore he comes in the shape of tongues; for he intends
truth: But ye make true men false men, religious men liars: your woolfish
proselytes, to maintain their walking in sheeps clothing amongst us, and your
foxes their lurking in our vineyard, under the covert of equivocation. The
Apostle says, An oath is for confirmation, an end of all strife. Heb. 6.16.
But ye teach men to take oaths without any confirmation, and so to continue
the strife. What then? will ye plead succession from Saint Peter, who was here
sealed with an heavenly fiery tongue, an emblem of truth? No, no, ye are of
your father the Devil, for he is a liar, and the Father thereof. Joh. 8.44.

Again, as in regard of the work intended, so also the instrument of the work
considered, the Holy Ghost fitly appears in the shape of tongues. For by what
instrument is this heavenly work of regeneration wrought but by the tongue? How
shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? Faith comes by hearing,
and hearing by the word of God. Romans 10. This was the grand Commission that the
Holy Ghost came now to seal: Go ye into all the World, and preach the Gospel
unto every creature. Mat. 16.15. Seeing therefore he came to set tongues on
work, and to work by tongues, how could he more fitly, or properly appear, then
in the shapes of tongues? Well then, ye may see here the Ordinance of God
concerning man's happiness: how does he obtain it? even by his ears. God made
him at first by his voice; He spoke the word, and they were made, he commanded,
and they were created. Ps. 148. The same order he observes in the
regeneration, he effects it by a voice. It pleased God by the foolishness of
preaching, to save them that believe. 1 Cor. 1.18. There is indeed vox realis,
as well as vox vocalis: A real as well as a vocal, a visible as well as an
invisible voice: A voice that speaks to the eye, that is the visibility of
the creature: Their sound is gone out into all lands, and their words into the
ends of the World: There is neither speech nor language, but their voice is
heard amongst them. Ps. 19. But this voce does but make without excuse: The
invisible things of him from the creation of the World are clearly seen, being
understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead, so
that they are without excuse, Romans 1.20. This voice witnesses rather against
then with the Gentiles: For God left not himself without witness, in that he
did good, and gave us rain from Heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our
hearts with food and gladness, Act. 14.17. But the effectual saving voice, is
that which sounds to the ear, in the preaching of the word: Receive with
meekness the word that is grafted in you, which is able to save your souls.
Jam. 1.21. 1. Here is a strain beyond Philosophy. 2. A point against Popery.
3. Comfort to the blind. 4. No discomfort to the deaf. 5. Shame and confusion
to the obstinate and scornful, that stop their ears, or hear to mock.


1. A strain beyond Philosophy, for that will have seeing to be the most
excellent of the senses: And so indeed (in nature) it is. But if you come to
grace, and to the height of man's excellency and perfection, then the ear bears
the bell away, in as much as God has made that the prime and special
instrument of saving health to men's souls. Though therefore the eye excel in
quick apprehending, in total comprehending, in certain informing; yet it
concerns but nature and natural things, and has to do with colors, not
with bodies or substances (as the Philosophers themselves confess) But the ear
has to do with spiritual and eternal things, that are truly substantial,
and available to the present and future good of the soul. And where then is the
wise, where is the disputer of this world? has not God made the wisdom of
this world foolishness? 1. Cor. 1.20. Yea has he not taken the wise in their
own craftiness? 1 Cor. 3.19. Whiles they most honored the eye, has not God
done them most honor by the ear? They thought only of their eyes: But God (the
mean while) caught them by their ears, and by their ears light, cleared their
eyes light: (for before they were blind, but now they see:) The Holy Ghost by
tongues has given them eyesight, and made them see.

2. Here is a point against Papistry: For that (even in spiritual things)
prefers, or at least gives too much unto the eye, especially amongst the
ignorant: For they teach that Images are laymens books. But God in revealing
himself and his will, has employed the ear, and (in a manner) silenced the
eye, and barred the use of it in especial acknowledging of him and exercise of
his worship. Adam in Paradise had conference with God, and heard his voice: But
what use of his eyes? What did he ever fee? Moses (having a curious desire to
see God) was he not taught to see best by his ears? did not God express
himself unto him more by proclamation then by vision? Exodus 33.18, 19. and
34.6. And did not Moses warn the people to beware of eye-work, because they had
only carework in the receiving of the Law? Take good heed unto your selves,
for ye saw no image in the day that the Lord spoke unto you in Horeb. Deuteronomy.
4.15. Yea when God sent his Son visible in the flesh, yea, when he made him
most conspicuous in the transfiguration, whether did he commend him to the ear
or to the eye? Not to the eye, but to the ear: This is my beloved Son in whom I
am well pleased, hear him: It is hear him, not see him. Mat. 17.5. Away then
with all teaching of Images, they be teachers of lies. Hab. 2.18. The Holy
Ghost appeared in tongues, to signify kind of teaching he intended, namely of
the ear not of the eye. God will have no appearance from the dead, therefore no
dead appearance to teach us, but this to be alsufficient for all. They have
Moses and the Prophets, let them hear them. Lu. 16.29.

3. He is comfort to the blind: Why? For the happiness of the Soul comes by
the ear, not by the eye. Their loss therefore of bodily sight does not deprive
them of spiritual light, but the ear may suffice for that. So long then as
they have the benefit of hearing, the loss of sight should not be grievous. In
this they lose vanity, but in that they obtain verity, this gain may very well
drown that loss. The Prophet prays, O turn away mine own eyes lest they
behold vanity. Ps. 119.37. And if in stead of being turned away, they be quite
taken away, the odds is not great, seeing all in the world that they behold is
vanity: Yea the odds may be great advantage to the Soul, even to make the ear
(her especial organ) the more attentive to receive, the more intensive to
conceive, the more retentive to keep. For the less the eye has to see, the
more leisure and pleasure the ear should have to hear. Which is a good Item
(by the way) to old men and women, to teach them to be the more, both exercised
and satisfied with their ears, when their sight begins to fail: Exercised, for
their need is the greater, their speed is the easier: Satisfied, for the Holy
Ghost appeared in tongues, not so much intending for that present to be seen,
as for ever to be heard, and to make the care the alsufficient mouth to feed
the soul though eyes be wanting.

4. Here is no discomfort to the deaf (as at first sight it may seem) For
though the Holy Ghost appeared in the likeness of a tongue, yet he is a
spirit. He is a spirit in substance, a tongue but in appearance: therefore
though ordinarily he enter by the ear into the soul, yet extraordinarily, he
can enter though the ear be shut; even as Christ ordinarily (because he was
man) did enter by opened doors, but extraordinarily (because he was God) even
shut doors did not bar his entrance, Joh. 20. He spoke the word, and they were
made: Gods word prevailed in the creation, when as yet there was not an ear to
hear: And shall it not likewise prevail in the regeneration, even of him who is
deaf and cannot hear? Yes doubtless; for ejus dicere est facere, Gods work and
his word are so one, that if he speak the word it must needs be done. He that
made the ear shall he not hear thee? Yes (no doubt) though thou speak never so
softly. Therefore also I may say, he that made the tongue shall not thou hear
him? Yes, though thou hear never so hardly: though thy soul be dead, much more
though thine ear be dead, thou shall hear him that speaks to that purpose: For,
the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear it shall
live, Joh. 5.25. The Holy Ghost is become a Tongue, to signify his ordinary
entrance by the ear, but he is a fiery tongue, a spiritual tongue, a divine
tongue, he can enter though there be no ear. There is not therefore so much
discomfort in deafness as may seem: For though God has tied us to means, yet
himself is above means. He is an almighty tongue, and can work as well without
the ear as with it.

5. Here is shame and confusion to them that will not hear, or that hear but to
mock. Such a generation are fore-prophecied to come in the last days, stopping
their ears, as the Adder does hers, with the ground, and with her tail, so they
theirs with worldliness and fleshliness: proving oxen, seeing farms, eating
and drinking, marrying, and giving in marriage: or else filling their mouths
with mockings, and setting at naught the Ministry of the Word as a mad
business: As Jehu his companions spoke of the Prophet, Wherefore came this mad
fellow to thee? 1 King. 9.11. And as Festus took Paul for a mad man, Act.
26.24. Such were there in Ezekiels time (and therefore no doubt will be in all
times) With their mouths they make jests, and their heart goes after
covetousness, Ezekiel. 33.31. And especially in the last times; for it is so
prophesied, 2 Pet. 3.3. There shall come in the last days mockers. But let all
such know, that the Holy Ghost came in tongues, showing his intent to work by
tongues: It is not therefore ye that speak, but the spirit of your father that
speaks in you, says Christ, Mat. 10.20. They have not cast thee away, but
they have cast me away, says God to Samuel, 1 Samuel 8.7. He that despises,
despises not man but God, says St. Paul 1 These. 4.8. What then? Resist not
the Holy Ghost: For they that resist, shall receive to themselves damnation,
Romans 13.2. He that speaks against the holy Ghost shall never be forgiven in
this world, nor in the world to come. Mat. 12.32. Let every man therefore be
swift to hear, slow to speak, Jam. 1.19. Let the spirits gracious speaking
prevail, and our ungraciousness be put to silence.

But what manner of tongues are they that do here appear? Cloven tongues. This
is the last note, but not the least; for it implies manifold mysteries, which
may be thus summed and contracted. It implies Division; it implies union:
Division from God in respect of gifts and graces to be given: Union to God in
respect of people and nations to be called. Division in the instruments that
were to work; Union in the subjects that were to be wrought upon.

1. Division: They were to be divided in the total sum, and in the severals,
all one from another, and each one in himself.

First in the total: They were to be divided in place, in degree, in gifts.

1. In place: The holy Ghost said, separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work
whereunto I have called them, Act. 13.2. Crescens is gone to Galatia, Titus to
Dalmatia, 2 Timothy 4.10. They were to go into all the world, and to teach all
nations, and for expeditions sake to go severally.

O strange expedition! Single men, and simple ones too, even silly Fishermen,
are called and sent to set upon Cities, Towns, yea Kingdoms and Countries, and
that but with their tongues. See man's strength in God, see Gods strength in
man. Man's strength of boldness: they feared not the faces, nor yet the hands of
Kings and tyrants: Why? If God be with us, who can be against us? Romans 8.31. I
have put my trust in God, I will not fear what flesh can do unto me, Ps. 56.11.
And see Gods strength of ableness; The Lord saves not with sword, nor yet with
spear: for the battle is the Lords, 1 Samuel 17.47. It is not hard to the Lord to
save with many, or with few, 1 Samuel 14.6. I will give you a mouth and wisdom,
where-against all your adversaries shall not be able to speak or resist, Luke
21.15.

But (no doubt) their separation was for multiplications sake: they were
singled to several places, that the more abundant fullness of the Gentiles
might the more speedily come in. Saint John preached in the lesser Asia, Saint
Andrew in Scythia, Philip in the higher Asia, Thomas in India, Bartholomew in
Armenia, Matthew in Aethiopia, Simon the Canaanite in Mesopotamia, Thaddaeus in
Arabia, James in Jerusalem, Peter at Rome: So does Panigyrola range them.

The Fathers of the former ages were permitted and tolerated in Polygamie: to
have many wives, for spedy multiplications sake, that they might fill the world
apace. But the Apostles are singled (as much as may be) every one to a several
charge, even for the same end, even for speedy increase of spiritual issue:
God grant then that the spiritual Polygamie of our times, be not the cause of
barrenness: that the curse of Ephraim come not upon it, Give them a barren
womb and dry breasts. Hos. 9.14. That the more Churches several ministers do
contract, betroth and espouse to themselves, the fewer souls they do not beget.

Secondly, They were to be divided in degree: For though there be no Popish
supremacy granted to Saint Peter, And though it be granted that the twelve
(for their time) challenged no superiority: Yet it will not follow that there
was no superiority or difference acknowledged amongst them. For Saint Paul does
mention, Chief Apostles, 2 Cor. 12.11. and gives this title ( Pillars) to
Peter James and John. Gal. 2.9. And it is most plain, that differences of
degrees amongst the ministers, is an ordinance not humane but divine. For God
has ordained some in the Church, first Apostles, secondly Prophets, thirdly
teachers: then them that do miracles: helps, Governments. 1 Cor. 12.28. And
even of old in Readiness time, the company of Prophets, In the new Test. 12.
Apostles. Lu. 6: 70 Disciples Lu. 10.1.7 Deacons. Act. 6.3.
had Samuel the Prophet appointed over them. 1 Samuel 19.20. And ever since there
was a Priesthood, there has been inferiority and superiority therein.

They therefore that will have no superirrity or difference of degrees in the
ministry, will have the God of order to be the Author of confusion. They show
not the spirit of meekness in avoiding state, but of pride in seeking it, and
striving each one himself to have it.

Thirdly, They were to be divided in gifts. There are diversities of gifts, but
the same spirit, wisdom, knowledge, healing, prophecy; etc. And all these
works even the self same spirit, distributing severally, to every one, even
as he will. 1 Cor. 12.4.

Behold then, diversity of gifts in men, is of necessity, God will have it so:
For it is no small expression of his infiniteness, to make diversity in all
kinds of things. Where do ye see two faces alike? or hear two voices alike? or
find two constitutions of body, or two dispositions of mind alike? or two men's
handwritings alike? What then? will ye have all preaching to be alike? Why, it
is impossible. For every man has his proper gift: unus autem sic, alius autem
sic: one after this manner, another after that. 1. 1 Cor. 7.7. Diversity and
multiplicity of gifts, shows the riches of Gods grace, and redoundeth to his
glory.

Require not not therefore all to be alike, lest ye be found fighters against
God: Neither call one only method of preaching sanctified: For (no doubt)
every man's method is sanctified to sanctify hearers: To the clean all things
are clean: And nothing is to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving:
The Holy Ghost appears in cloven tongues, for the Apostles were to be divided
in the total, in place, in degrees, in gifts.

Again, as in the total sum of them, so also in the severals, they were to be
divided, even each one in his own speaking: For ( tongues) employed their
intended speaking, but ( cloven tongues) their diverse and various speaking.

They were to speak diversely in respect of the objects or parties to whom, and
in respect of the subject, or matter what they were to speak.

In respect of the parties, they were to speak diversely: Namely to God, and to
man. To God for man; to man for God. To God for man in praying, to man for God
in preaching: The Apostle Saint Paul professes and proves both. The former,
Romans 1.9. God is my witness whom I serve in my spirit, that without ceasing I
make mention of you always in my prayers. The latter, 2 Cor. 5.20. We are
ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you thorough us, we pray you
in Christ's stead, that ye be reconciled unto God.

Sometimes they speak to God, sometimes to man: For Omnia tempus habent: to
every thing there is an appointed time, Eccl. 3.1. The Ministers tongue must be
divided, sometimes to plead for his Master, sometimes for his brethren,
sometimes to act Gods part, sometimes man's part: For we are bidden, pray
continually, 1 These. 5.17. And (in effect) preach continually: for it is Be
instant in season and out of season, 2 Timothy 4.2. But the continuance of both
required, argues that neither of them alone can be continued but by turns, so
as there be no thrusting out, nor yet disgracing of either by the other, but
that they be (as the two hands) one to cleanse, and to strengthen the other.

And if the Minister be thus to be divided between God and his people, even (as
a Factor) to carry out their confessions and petitions, and to return his
blessings, and to stand (as a Moses) in the gap of every difference: O what a
strong bond of love and unviolable knot of affection should this make between
every Minister and his people? What care should he have of them? what desire
should they have of him? what comfort and consolation should they find and take
mutually and reciprocally in each other? St. Paul was willing to deal unto his
people not only the Gospel of God, but also his own soul, because they were
dear unto him, 1 These. 2.8. And his people were ready, if it had been possible,
to have plucked out their own eyes, and to have given them to him, Gal. 4.15.
He received hie people as his joy. What is our hope, or joy, or crown of
rejoicing? are not even ye it, in the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ at his
coming? yes, ye are our glory and our joy, 1 These. 2.19. And his people
received him as their joy: For they received his preaching not as the word of
man, but as the word of God, 1 These. 2.13. And they received him as an Angel of
God, even as Christ Jesus, Gal. 4.14. He professes his fatherhood to his
people; We exhorted you, and comforted you, and besought every one of you, as a
father his children, 1 The. 2.11. And he testifies his peoples sonship to him:
As my beloved sons I warn you, 1 Cor. 4.14. Here was true trading; this Factor
was happy in his work. He felt (like that good huswife, Prove. 31.18.) that his
merchandise was good. Good every way: good to the seller, God; he gained glory:
Good to the buyers, the people, they were enriched with faith and works: Good
to the Factor, St. Paul, he got both favor and reward of each party, both of
the buyer and of the seller, on the one side temporal, on the other side
eternal.

But (on the contrary) if instead of the Ministers dealing his own soul to the
people, and their plucking out their own eyes for him, he be careless of their
souls, and they ready to pluck out his eyes: If instead of crowning each other
with joy, they brand one another with shame: If instead of the near and dear
relation of Fatherhood and Sonship, there be no kin but couzenage between them,
he couzening them of their spiritual, and they him of his temporal rights and
dues, then this must needs be the devils own only market, all the gains must
needs come home to him.

Again, as in regard of their objects; so likewise of their subject or matter,
they were each one to be divided in himself.

Their matter? how? I do not mean, materia prima (as I may call it) their
first matter, the ground and foundation of their work; for in that every one
must be semper idem, no changling: For, there is one Faith, one Baptism, Ephesians.
4.5. Other foundation can no man lay then that which is laid, which is Jesus
Christ, 1 Cor. 3.11. Jesus Christ yesterday and to day, and the same for ever,
Heb. 13.8. But I mean their matters of discourse, and treatise, their several
buildings upon this foundation. In that, diversity is required according to
differences of times and places, companies and occasions. Namely, to comfort,
and to threaten: to speak learnedly, and plainly, properly, and fitly as their
audience shall require. The Apostle bids Timothy, Reprove, rebuke, exhort, 2 Timothy 4.2. These be diverse works: And he prescribes milk for babes, and strong
meat for the strong, Hebr. 5.13. These be diverse meats: And he knows how
both to abound, and to be abased, Phil. 4.12. these be diverse measures. And to
be made all things to all men, that by all means he may save some, 1 Cor. 9.22.
these be diverse manners.

Ye see then we are not still to be tied to one strain, but to divide our
tongues, and to use our liberty in the spirit of discretion, to all purposes:
And the learned may not despise our plainness, for the ignorants sake, nor the
ignorant begrudge our learning, for the learneds sake, but bear one another
burden for Christ's sake: And not marvel if sometimes ye hear the Law as well
as the Gospel; for the Holy Ghost came in cloven tongues, intending thus to
cleave and divide the Apostles tongues to several purposes.

So much of their division.

But no doubt the most proper and direct purpose of those cloven tongues was,
to signify the gift of diverse tongues now to be bestowed upon the Apostles:
that they should be endued with diverse tongues, enabled to speak diverse
languages, which presently appeared to be fulfilled. And this (as before I
noted for my last point) implies Union: Namely, the gathering of all Nations
unto Christ, that there might be one field, and one husbandman, one flock, and
one shepherd: For to that end the Gospel must be preached through the whole
world. And for the speeding thereof, the Apostles are instantly furnished, if
not with all, yet with the most languages. What then? look how the Nations were
at first divided, by the same they were now to be gathered, Genesis 11. By
division of tongues they were scattered and made diverse people: By division of
tongues they are to be gathered, and made one people; and to speak one
language, the language of Canaan, the profession of the Gospel. What then?
Note that God works by contraries, and he works upon contraries.

1. He works by contraries: that he may unite, he divides: that he may
gather, he scatters: that he may exalt, he brings low, as in Joseph: that
he may bring low, he exalts, as in Haman. He gives prosperity to some to
befool them, Thou fool this night will they take away thy soul from thee, Luke
12.20. And he takes away riches from some to make them wise. It is good for
me that I have been in trouble, that I may learn thy statutes, Psalm. 119.71.
Yea, he chooses the foolish things of this world to confound the wise, 1 Cor.
1. Yea, he makes the means of salvation to be to some the means of
condemnation, even the savor of death unto death, 2 Cor. 2.16. And only to
serve to make them to know, that there has been a Prophet amongst them Ezekiel.
2.5.

Beware then that ye measure not Gods works by outward appearance: For, no man
knows either love or hatred of all that is before him, Eccles. 9.1. Presume
not in prosperity, despair not in adversity, but pray for the right use and
end of both, that whether it be rod or staff it may comfort thee. And be not
content with outward things, no not with outward hearing, but take heed how ye
hear, lest ye make your condemnation the greater: For God works by
contraryes, even gathering by division.

Lastly, God works upon contraries: to turn evil into contrary evil: And
again, to turn evil into good.

1. He turns evil into contrary evil, sin into punishment. A wicked union
was turned into a cursed division: the greatest conspiracy into the greatest
confusion: Namely, the builders of Babel by division of tongues were scattered
upon the face of the whole earth.

That Simeon and Levi (all brethren in evil) may know what the portion of
evil union is, namely, division, and separation: I will divide them in Jacob,
and scatter them in Israel, Genesis 49.7. Yea that all rebellious practisers
against God may know, that there is neither wisdom, nor understanding, nor
counsel against the Lord, Prove. 21.30.

But the last is the best of all, to wit, that he draws good out of evil,
and turns cursing into blessing.

What evil was there ever so great, wherein Gods goodness has not appeared?
The very sin of Adam, what abundance of goodness has it drawn from God? The
malice of Joseph's brethren, what a deal of good did God work by it, to him,
and them, and to their families? The cruelty of the Jews to Christ, did not
God turn it to the accomplishment of man's salvation? That cursed confusion of
Tongues at the building of Babel, is it not now recompensed with a blessed
division of Tongues, whereby to make a spiritual building of living stones, an
holy temple unto the Lord our God?

What then? Let us not contend with GOD for his suffering, or for his punishing
of evil in us, but let us glorify him for that he has made every thing
beautiful in its time, Eccles. 3.15. Yea, that his mercy rejoiceth over his
justice: He will not always be chiding, neither keeps hebis anger for ever:
Yea, that as all natnrall motions are strongest at last, so likewise his
goodness increases with continuance (like the Moon) till it come to the full.
Old curses are turned into new blessings, Behold all things are become new.

The Old Testament ends with cursing, Malach. 4.6. but the New with blessing,
Revelat. 22.21. God has fully revealed himself in grace, and shall shortly in
glory. In that therefore let us settle with glory to him, and joy to ourselves,
even in that Amen of the Gospel, which gives grace, and promises glory: Even
so Amen, come Lord JESUS.

A SERMON against HYPOCRISY.
Text. Luke 12.1. Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees which is hypocrisy.


OF Truth and Righteousness God is the only Author, but deceit and falsehood
spring from the corrupted heart of man: Only lo this have I found (says
Solomon, Eccl. 7) that God made man righteous, but they have sought out many
inventions. God made man righteous; and while that garment lasted, he needed no
other covering: For having not as yet by any abuse dishonored his body, or any
part thereof, he had no need to be ashamed thereof; for all was holy. But
Satan's thorny temptations having rent his robe of righteousness, and made him
sinful, he presently became shameful; and then he seeks other coverings:
Fig Tree leaves, slender coverings for his outside: Shifts and excuses (more
slender coverings for his inside. So was simplicity turned into subtilty, and
the clear stream of sincerity (perspicuous to the bottom) mudded with the
filth of false and foul hypocrifie. So began it in him, and so it continues in
all us. In all us; for so says St. Bernard, super Cant. sermon. 82. Omnem
posteritatem hereditarium hypocrisis virus infecit: The hereditary poison of
Adams hypocrisy has infected all his posterity. Quem dabis (says he) de
filiis Adami qui quod est, non dico velit, sed vel patiatur videri? Whom can
thou show me amongst the sons of Adam, which has (I say not a will) but so
much as the patience to be seen as he is. And (if his witness be not enough)
hear what David also says, namely, that All men are liars, Psalm. 116.10. Thus
wretched man is fallen from his honor, and has lost his understanding, and is
made comparable to the beasts that perish: For as the beast that is taken in a
snare, hampereth and strangleth himself the more by his own struggling to get
loose, so man ensnared in sin, the more intangleth himself therein, by
endeavoring to make evasion: for when he sins he is trapped, but when he
hides or excuses his sin, then he is wrapped in the snare of Satan, and in
the wrath of God. In the former he disobeyeth, but in the latter he mocketh and
derideth God, as if he might be deceived. But be ye not deceived; for God is
not mocked, he knows all our deceivings: And as he knows them, so he hates
them: Yea, it has a twofold degree of his hatred, because it is a twofold sin.
Therefore Christ gives many sharp reproofs thereof in the Gospel. Among which
this Text is one: Take heed to your selves of the leaven, etc. Which though it
be but one single precept, yet for orders sake we may consider it in two parts.

The first is a warning, Take heed to your selves.

The second is, the thing forewarned, the leaven of the Pharisees, which is
hypocrisy.

First, for the warning it self: Beware ye, or take heed to your selves.

This may be doubly taken, or admit a double construction: the one passive, the
other active: the one of suffering hurt, the other of doing hurt: the one of
being infested, and molested outwardly, the other of being infected and tainted
inwardly: Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees: that is, that they mischief
not you by it. Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees; that is, that ye
mischief not others by it. Take heed of it both in respect of their practice,
and of your own.

The former construction I gather from the premises, or precedence: Namely,
because in the end of the former Chapter, the malice of the Pharisees is
expressed, how they laid wait for Christ, and sought to entangle him: whereupon
this precept following so immediately to the Disciples implies (no doubt) that
they should be careful to avoid that danger.

The other construction I gather out of the consequence, or words next
following: For there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed. Whereby it
appears that Christ's warning is, that they should take heed of doing or
saying any thing which they would not have to be revealed.

And the rather may I presume upon this double interpretation, because it
suteth with that which Christ elsewhere utters: Namely, Mat. 10.16. Be ye wise
as serpents, and innocent as doves. Wise as serpents, that ye take no harm:
Innocent as doves, that ye do no harm. Wise as serpents, that ye be not
beguiled by others. Innocent as doves, that others be not beguiled by you. Wise
as serpents, to shun offense that may be offered to you. Innocent as doves to
shun offense that may be offered by you.

From which interpretation do arise two doctrines to be observed.

First, we may see that it is not an unlawful, but a necessary and needful
thing for Christians to provide for their temporal estate, and worldly
wel-being, both by shunning of evil, and seeking of good.

1. By shunning of evil: this the Text expresses (being so understood as
aforesaid) Namely, as a warning against temporal danger. And Mat. 10.23. Christ
bids his disciples, when they are persecuted in one city to flee to another.
And Prove. 22.3. A prudent man sees the plague and hides himself, but the
foolish go on still and are punished.

2. By seeking of good. This follows out of the former; for the shunning of
evil implies and includes the seeking of good; for one cannot be done
without the other. And yet more plainly, Romans 12.17. Provide things honest in
the sight of all men.

Here then the heresy of the Familists that would have no propriety, but all
things common, is reproved: We are taught to love our neighbor as our self;
therefore we must love our self, and provide for our self. The Scripture
plentifully exhorts us to giving, and that implies a necessity of
possessing: there can be no giving where there is no owning. A man cannot give
that which he has not. What though the Disciples in time of persecution had
all things common? their community did not extinguish propriety: Or if it did,
it was but voluntary, not of necessity: For St. Peter tells Ananias, that his
land before he sold it pertained unto him; and the price after he sold it was
in his own power, he might have kept it if he would, Act. 5.4.

2. This condemns also the superstitious conceit of Popery, that makes
wilful poverty a work of perfection, yea of superfection (if I may so speak)
that is, of supererogation (as they call it) We have many exhortations and
precepts to make us exercised in giving, but none to move us to make an
exercise of receiving. Yea Christ has pronounced it to be a blessed thing to
give rather then receive, as it is witnessed Act. 20.35. What though he bade
the young man sell that he had, and give unto the poor if he would be perfect;
that was to discover to him his imperfection in having, not any perfection in
wanting of riches. What though he affirms it to be easier for a camel to go
thorough the eye of a needle, then for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of
heaven: That is to show us our great corruption, that we cannot of our selves
make them good in our using, not to prove any such corruption in them, as if
they could not be made good to us by Gods blessing. No, the contrary to that is
cleared by Gods giving them (as to many others) so expressly to Solomon, in the
name and nature of a blessing, 1 King. 3.13. and by that general charter made
unto godliness, entailing to it the promises, as well of the life present, as
that which is to come. 1 Timothy 4.8

3. This also condemns the idleness of the sluggard, who hides his hand in
his bosom, and it grieveth him to put it again to his mouth, Prove. 26.18. And
thinks one handful better with rest then both the hands full with travel,
Eccl. 4.6. Christ urges the example of the Lilies, not to weaken, but to
hearten us to labor: For, if God so cloth the grass of the field (which
labors not, nor can use means) how much more will he cloth you? (which do
labor and use means) for we are not otherwise to take it, as if he would
preserve us by miracle. No, but he ordains the contrary, namely, that the
sleeper shall be clothed with rags, Prove. 23.21. Yea, that he that will not
labor should not eat, 2 These. 3.10. Yea, he ordains, that each man should
labor not only for his own sustenance, that he may eat his own bread, 2
These. 3.12. but for others sustenance also, that he may have to give to him
that needs, Ephesians. 4.28.

4. Lastly, this also condemns the wastefulness of careless unthrifts, who
of all Solomon's lessons do think but one worth the learning, that is, that it
is comely to eat and to drink, and to take pleasure in all our labor, Eccl.
5.17. Yea this they have so overlearned, that they draw it to the Epicures
conclusion, Let us eat and drink, for to morrow we shall die: as if all their
labor were but for their own mouth, and that but for the present. What though
Christ bids, care not for to morrow, yet he forbids not providence but
diffidence, doubtful distrust. As for honest provision it is requirable of us
both for our selves and others: If there be any man that provideth not for his
own, and namely for them of his household, he denies the faith, and is worse
then an infidel, 1 Timothy 5.8.

But I may not omit a second doctrine which (before) I noted to be here
observable, that is the great corruption and depravation of man's nature, not
only in the particular practice of malice, but in the general inclination to
all sin. Christ bids his Disciples Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees.
Behold the Pharisees (Doctors of the old Church) subject to teach mischief, and
the Disciples (Doctors of the new Church) subject to learn it. Moses disciples
in the highest nature (so were the Pharisees) apt to show evil examples. And
Christ's disciples in the highest nature (so were the Apostles) likely enough to
follow them. The Disciples in taking heed to the Pharisees must take heed to
themselves.

1. For the particular infection of malice, that it is bred (as I may say) in
the bone of man's nature: If the Pharisees condition, and the Disciples danger
be not a glass bright and big enough to show it, then hear the Wisemans
outcry, Prove. 20.6. Who can find a faithful man? And the Prophets complaint,
Jer. 9.4. Let every one take heed of his neighbor, and trust you not in any
brother; for every brother will use deceit, and every friend will deal
deceitfully, and every one will deceive his friend, and will not speak the
truth. And Mich. 7.5. Trust you not in a friend, neither put confidence in a
Counselor, keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lies in thy bosom, for
the son revileth the father, the daughter rises up against her mother, the
daughter in law against her mother in law, and a man's enemies are the men of
his own house. What mischief was there ever so great, what cruelty so savage
which the brains of men have not hatched, and their hands exercised one toward
another? David chooses rather to be punished by the immediate hand of God his
creator, his judge, his offended angry avenger, then by the hand of man, with
(whom happily) he might have pleaded both equality and comparative innocence;
Let us fall (says he) into the hands of the Lord, for his mercies are great,
and let me not fall into the hand of man, 2 Samuel 24.14.

Let me turn Use and Application here, into Expostulation, and Exprobation,
that we may be every one ashamed of this monstrous unnaturalness. Why should
we break that law of nature which the brutish savages do observe? savis
inter se convenit ursis, the savage beasts are sociable and succourable, why
should we be hurtful and banefull one to another? The Stoic acknowledged all
things to be for man, and homines hominum causa, that man is especially for
man's sake and behalf: Why then should we frustrate that purpose which nature it
self observes and intends? We would not, yea indeed we cannot live one
without another, why then do we live one against another? The saying is true (
intention by intent and purpose) Homo homini deus, Ps. 82.6. I have said ye
are Gods: O let us not make the contrary true ( action by performance) Homo
homini demon: Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil? Joh.
6.20.

As for our general inclination to evil (which is indeed the main point of
natures corruption) If this warning here to the disciples (wherein our common
weakness is argued) be not enough to prove it, then hear St. Paul's confession,
Romans 7.14. I am carnal, sold under sin: And the Disciples inquisition upon
themselves concerning that horrid sin of treason, Master, is it I? Mat. 26.22.
And David in both kinds speaking Ps. 19. Who can understand his faults? Cleanse
me, O Lord, from my secret faults. All which places both jointly, and severally
do prove, that Facilis descensus Averni, Hells passage is an easy, and
downhill way, we are naturally apt to run it.

This is a strong meditation (if at least we would strongly meditate it) both
to humble and to quicken us. To humble us; for how can pride possess us, or
self-conceit so much as touch us, when as we see our nature is the seed-plot of
sin, the sink of iniquity, the very common shore into the which the devil
emptieth all hellish uncleanness, and out of which he produces the same again
in most lothsom and noisome issues? What good thought can we entertain of our
selves, when as we must confess, we are not of our selves sufficient to think
a good thought, 2 Cor. 3.5. but that all the imaginations of the thoughts of
our heart are only evil continually? Genesis 6.5.

And this is strong also to quicken us. What wakeneth the sluggard, what
hearteneth the coward but extremity of danger? But what care, what diligence,
what providence can be sufficient to match our danger? What guard strong
enough? what watch strict enough? what search deep enough? what confession
large enough? what contrition tart enough to serve our turns? How should we
wrestle with flesh and blood to beat it down? I beat down my body and bring it
into subjection. 1 Cor 9.27. and with Satan to resist him, Resist the Devil
and he will flee from you, Jam. 4.7. And with God to get a blessing from him, I
will not let thee go except thou bless me. Genesis 32.26. Preciseness is a
common reproach to vilify men, but let us answer it with David's resolution; I
will be more vile then so. 2 Samuel 6.22. even for Saint Peter's conclusions sake,
What manner of persons ought ye to be in holy conversation and godliness? 2
Pet. 3.11.

And so much of the former general part of the text, the warning it self,
Beware ye, or take heed to your selves. Now for the latter part, that is, the
thing forewarned or spoken of against; The leaven of the Pharisees which is
Hypocrisy. This is here doubly set forth. 1. Figuratively by a similitude, The
leaven of the Pharisees: then literally by its own proper name, which is
Hypocrisy. The later is fit first to be considered: First what it is, and then
what it is like.

First what it is, Hypocrisy. Saint Augustine does thus describe it, de temp.
ser. 59. Hypocrita Graeco sermon, simulator, interpretator, qui cum intus
malus sit, bonum se palam ostendit: An Hypocrite is nothing else but a
dissembler, who would seem to be what he is not.

If I should go about to describe unto you this evil to the full, and to set
out all the parts of it, I should not only exceed my hour, but go beyond my
self, and undertake what I could not perform: It is so copious and various,
that it has more colors then the rainbow; what pensill can paint it? more
shapes then Proteus, what knot can hold it? I may compare it (for
fruitfullnesse) not to Danaus who had fifty Daughters (a breeding brood) but to
that many headed monster which could supply the loss of every head with sudden
issue of many in the room of it. But (that I may contain my self within my
times limit and mine own measure) let me bring all the particulars of it into
2. sums: Simulation and Dissimulation, faming of good, and hiding of evil.
These be two in name, but one in practice: like Janus, they have two faces but
one body. To us they are distinguished, but in themselves never divided: For on
the one side, good can not be pretended falsely showed, but it argues defect
of what should be: and that is dissimulation. And on the other side, evil can
not be covered but by pretense and show of good: and that is simulation. Every
false show of good is a hiding of evil: and every hiding of evil is a false
show of good: So ye see what necessary relation and dependence there is
between them, Mutuo se ponunt and auferunt: the one cannot be without the
other. Though therefore many have taken worthy and profitable pains in
handling them severally, yet let my present pains for your profit be to speak
of them jointly: And as it is said of those whom God has united, Let no man
put them asunder: so let me say of these which Satan has united, for this time
let them go together.

Briefly then, the sum of all here is, that Christ here forbids his
Disciples, all falsehood: and therein shows, that sincerity is the practice of
a Christian, yea, the perfection of a Christian: For he strikes not at a
branch, but at the root of sin: he speaks not here against against any
single or several evil, but against that which is Lernamalorum, the sum of
all evil: that which truly turns good into evil, and falsely makes good of
evil: So that in avoiding hereof, a man may seem to have attained his
perfection. For it is indeed only Christ's perfection to be free both from
sin and guile ( who did no sin, neither was there guile found in his mouth. 1
Pet. 2.22. But it is a Christians perfection to be free only from guile.
Behold an Israelite indeed in whom there is no guile. Joh. 1.47. And therefore
it is that David is said to be a man after Gods own heart, and that Noah, Job,
Lot, Zachary, and Elisabeth, are said to be perfect, just, righteous, or the
like, not because they were no sinners, but because they were no dissemblers:
For what does God require? Lo (says David) thou requirest truth in the inward
parts Ps. 51.6. This is Gods portion: My Son give me thy heart Pro. 23.26. For
if there be truth within, there may be failing and falling, but not falsifying
without.

O then how strongly should we strive hereunto? and how fearful should we be
to fall into the contrary? For seeing on the one side, by obtaining we reach
the height of our perfection, it must needs follow, that by failing on the
other side, we fall into the depth of imperfection: For as sincerity is to God
most acceptable, so hypocrisy is to him most abominable: Witness the earnest
passion which Christ expresses in inveighing against this evil more then any
other, as in many places, so especially, Mat. 23. denouncing eight woes
immediately one after another upon it, and not so content, concludes yet more
bitterly; Ye serpeats, ye generation of vipers, how should ye escape the
damnation of Hell? Serpents and Vipers? why? are there no other creatures that
may resemble the hypocrite but these? Yes many. The swan is always washing her
feet, yet never makes them white: And though she be white in feather, yet her
flesh is black to the eye, bitter to the taste, and heavy to the stomach: so the
hypocrite is alwais waving in the water of fair profession, and yet his lays
are never the cleaner; ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge
of the truth: And though his appearances be white, yet are his performances
black to the eye, if ye look upon them, bitter to the tongue if ye speak of
them, and cloying to the conscience if ye follow them. The fox is a subtle
creature, and so running to hide himself, that he will not be found without
labor, and when he is found, he yields nothing but a stinking savor: except
it be his case, which indeed is better then his body: neither is there any use
to be made of him, but only to take his stink, which is accounted medicinable
for the shaking grief: And such is the hypocrite, cunning to hide, hard to be
discovered: And if you find him, he yields you nothing but noysomnesse, except
his case, his covering, his profession: that is all he is worth: Neither is
there any use to be made of him, but only to take his stink, that is, to hate
and abhor him. For that is medicinable, to stay the shaking of faith, hope and
love. Of love. 1. Joh. 3.18. Let us not love in word, nor in tongue, but in
deed and verity, truth makes love strong. Of hope. Job 8.13. The hypocrites
hope shall perish, therefore the sincere man's hope shall stand: truth makes
hope strong. Of faith, Ephesians. 6.14. First, gird your loins with verity, and then
take the shield of Faith: Truth makes faith tstrong.

The Crocodile faineth weeping when he intends murdering: So the hypocrit
makes long prayers to devour widows houses. Mat. 23. Ishmael entertained
those with tears, whom by and by he put to the sword, Ier. 41.6.

The Basilisk kills if he first espy, not if he be first seen; so the hypocrit
does mischief whiles he is undiscryed, but not if he be first discovered.

The Camelion that changes his color: The Silkworm that changes his shapes.
Many other creatures might fitly resemble and rightly express the hypocrite.
But Christ insisteth upon none but only the Serpent and the Viper. Astutia
eorum non est bono sed in malo. Chrysostom. oper imperf. in Mat. 23.
sed in malo, the the wittiest in evil does best set forth the wickedest in
evil. The Viper, the most monstrous of all creatures, both in their ingendring
(which is at the mouth) in which act the female suffocateth or strangleth the
male: And in their procreating, for the young ones eat their way thorough their
damms belly, and so come to life by the death both of their begetter and
breeder. Their teeth are hidden in their gumms, and yet the least touch of
their biting is present death: as may appear by that, Act. 28.6. when the
Barbarians saw the Viper on Paul's hand, they looked for his sudden falling
down dead, which because they could not see, they said he was a God.

Behold then what emblems our Savior uses to set forth the hypocrit: even the
most hateful things to set forth the hatefullnesse of the evil. Wherefore let
it be as hateful to us as it was to him: or at least so hateful, that he may
not hate us for not hating it.

The Israelites were forbidden to wear Linsey-Woollsey, garments made of linen
and woollen: there is (no doubt) a mystery in it: The linen is of the earth,
which may signify uncleanness, the woollen is of the sheep, which is an
emblem of innocence. Greg. Mor. 8. Per lanam simplicitas, per linum subtilitas
designatur: the wool figureth simplicity, the linen subtlety. And again, the
wool is a covering and hiding to the linen that it can hardly be seen. All is
for our instruction, that our conversation should be one and the same in
substance and in appearance: No covering of sinfullnesse with holiness: No
dsfiguring the face that we may appear holy: For disfiguring the face is worse
then painting the face, for this is but the mocking of nature, and that but in
seeking to mend it: but the other is the mocking of grace, and that in seeking
to mar it. Chrysostom. in Mat. Ho. 45. Si bonum est esse bonum, ut quid non vis
esse quod vis apparere? Si vero malum est esse malum, ut quid vis esse quod non
vis apparere? Nam quod turpe est apparere turpius est esse: quod autem formosum
est apparere, formosius est esse: ergo aut esto quod appares, aut appare
quodes. If it be good to be good, why will thou not be what thou will appear to
be? But if it be evil to be evil, why will thou be that thou will not appear
to be? For that which is foul in seeming, is fouler in being: And that which is
fair in seeming is fairer in being: Therefore either be thou what thou
appearest, or appear that thou art. So does Saint Chrysostom upbraid the
hypocrites of his time.

But we have another evil in our time, as much if not more to be cried out
upon: which is another extreme, not in too much, but in too little hiding:
Hyporcisis non est quae latere prae abundantia non valet, prae impudentia non
quaerit: That is not hypocrisy which cannot be hid hy reason of abundance, and
will not be hid by reason of impudence says Bernard, Super Cant ser. 33.
Absolon put down his brother Amnons lust in punishing it, but he more put it
down in practicing it: For Amnon betrayed his sister secretly in his own
Chamber. 2. Sam 13.6. but Absolon went in unto Fathers concubines openly in the
sight of all Israel. 2. Sam 16.22. Such is the outrage and madness of many,
that what they condemn in others, hiding it, the same they boast in themselves,
showing it: So that (as Stella says, in Lu. 12.1.) Opus est ut ad hypocrisin
invitemus, we have need now adays to invite men to hypocrisy, and to persuade
them to hide their sins. For the hypocrit (though he does allwaies hurt
himself, yet sometimes he does good to others, by show of good, giving good
occasions and provocations. But by open, impudent and boasted evil, no good but
much hurt is ever done; Yea, he that is come to that degree, to boast himself
in sin, he has no other degree nor farther step to tread forwards but into
hell.

And so much of this sin in general, as it is here literally set forth in
its proper name Hypocrisy:

Now for the figurative description of it, The leaven of the Pharisees.

Leaven is diversely taken and used in the Scriptures: sometimes on the bad
part, sometimes on the good, Mat. 16.6. It is put for false doctrine, Beware of
the leaven of the Pharisees: The Disciples (after Christ's reproof of their
mistaking him) do at last understand him by leaven to mean the Doctrine of the
Pharisees ver. 12. But Mat. 13.33. It is put for true doctrine, the doctrine of
the Gospel; The Kingdom of Heaven is like unto leaven which a woman took and
hid in three measures of meal till all was leavened. And here in my text it is
put for Hypocrisy, which concerns rather the evil of practice then of
Doctrine: And so 1 Cor. 5.8. The leaven of maliciousness and wickedness. Now
there is one reason may stand for all: Namely, that as leaven (though it be but
a little) diffuseth and imparteth it self into a great quantity, and cease
not its secret working, until it has filled all the heap about it, with its
own nature; so a little falsehood whether in life or in doctrine, and likewise a
little sincerity grows and steals (as it were) by degrees into a great
quantity, and cease not to work whiles it has any thing to work upon. A
little leavea leaveneth the whole lump. 1 Cor. 5.6. that for evil. A woman
hides leaven in three measures of meal till all be leavened, Mat. 13.33.
that is for good.

From whence we may learn not to despise small beginnings, whether in good or
evil. Not in good, for the greatest fires begin of small sparks, Behold how
great a matter a little fire kindles. Jam. 3.5. When (therefore) the hammer of
the word, striking thy stone heart shall fetch some sparks out of it, neglect
them not, but cherish them, that they may grow unto a melting heat that thou
may be mollified; unto a refining heat that thou may be purified; unto an
exhaling heat that thou may be elevated; unto a sacrificing heat that thou
may be accepted. Noe, nor let the means be neglected, though perhaps it be
but mean and small: No matter with what cattle the field be plowed, whether
with the Ox or the Ass, the clean or unclean beast, so that the ground and
the seed be good. God taught Balaam by an Ass before he taught him by an
Angel. Number. 22. And the sowing upon or beside all waters (that is in all lowly
grounds) is blessed, whether the feet of the Ox or of the Ass be driven. Is.
32.20.

And as not in good, so neither in evil should small beginnings be neglected
or pass unregarded. For the serpents body is so shaped, that it will all
easily slip after his head: Give him but his inch and he will quickly have his
whole ell. Ahab first looked, then liked, then lusted, then sickned for Naboths
Vineyard. David not checking his first view, proceeded to affecting, effecting,
accumulating lust with murder. Saint Peter first following a far off, and
shrinking, grew to denying, cursing, forswearing. The vastest grants Giants are
at the first small embryoes: the foulest sins even the Children of Babylon,
begin in weak imaginations: Blessed therefore shall he be that takes all those
children Ps. 137. (even in their first conception) and dasheth them against the
stones.

But some in stead of dashing them do defend them: For they will not have lust
to be sin until it be ripe and ready to fall. But Christ says, Out of the
heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries. Mat. 15.19. And Genesis 6.5.
The imaginations of the thoughts of the heart are said to be evil. And what is
evil to or with God but sin? All his works are good, and he makes all but
sin: therefore that which is evil with him, must needs be sin: Sin is
sin as well in the first conceit, as in the last consent. The Cocatrice is
venomous in the egg, as well as in the bird: Take heed therefore of hatching
it: the egg is laid low, thou may crush it with thy foot, but the bird will
mount up over thy head, and above the reach of thy reformation.

The spiders first thread is a very slender one, yet being drawn, it holds the
frame of all her work: And our first motions are commonly weak and slender, but
being once firmly fastened, they quickly grow to a whole web of mischief: let it
be therefore their and not ours which is objected. Is. 59.5. They hatch
Cockatrice eggs, and weave the web of spiders.

But besides the swelling and spreading, leaven has also another property,
and that is sowring: which indeed is most proper in this place, where it is
stronger to in the evil sense. For of all evils none is stronger to sour
good, and to make it turn the stomach of almighty God (If I may so speak) then
this one of Hypocrisy. For (to show how he loatheth it) it pleases God to
threaten the punishment of it, in such kind of loathsome phrase, even that he
will spue the hypocrit out of his mouth. Rev. 3.16. For the hypocrit is fitly
compared to a brazen vessel: For brass is apt to sour the liquor which it
holds. And such is the hypocrite: the Poets sincerum befits him best: it is a
word most proper to living vessels. Sincerum est nisi vas quodcunque infundis
acescit: If the vessel be not sincere, whatsoever you power into it, it
sowreth. Whatsoever? yes whatsoever. For though I have prophecy and all
knowledge, and all faith to move Mountains: and all bounty to give all my
goods to the poor, and all patience to give my body to be burned: And though I
speak with the tongues of men and of Angels, and have not love, (good
affection, truth in the inward parts) I am but as sounding brass: that is but
a sowring Vessel. 1 Cor 13. But (that I be not tedious) let me leave the Genus
of this metaphor in Leaven, and fall upon the Species or particular of it, as
it is here expressed, namely in the Pharisees: The leaven of the Pharisees.

It will not be much material to make question or discourse of the order,
calling, condition, or profession, of these Pharisees: It may suffice that
Saint Augustine tells us, they were Nobiliores and doctiroes, the nobler and
the learneder sort of the Jews: which is confirmed Ioh. 5. where Nicodemus the
Pharisee is called both ruler of the Jews, ver. 1. and also A master or
teacher of Israel. ver. 10. The most do fetch their title from division or
separation: And that not only Habitu, they were several and divided from
others in their habits, but Observantiis too, they were singular in their
performances: which Saint Paul's speech implies Act. 26.5. where he calls
this profession the chiefest sect of their religion. In a word, the Jews were
Populorum separatissimi a the choicest of all people: and the Pharisees were
Iudaeorum separatissimi, the choicest of all the Jews.

Note therefore here the vanity of worldly state and dignity: Not many mighty,
not many noble are called. Note the insufficiency of learning and knowledge:
Where is the wise, where is the disputer of this world? Note the debility of
free will and natural strength: It is not in him that wills, nor in him that
runs. Note the deficiencie of all strictest outward observance. He is not a
Jew which is one outward. But especially to the purpose, note, that the
strongest wine makes the sharpest vinegar: the sweetest things in smell and in
taste are most loathsome and noisome in their putrefaction. The tongue (if it be
good) is the best member, but if it be naught it is the worst. Strength in a
lion is most outrageous: Wisdom in a serpent is most mischievous: knowledge in
an hypocrit is most pernicious. The Pharisees (those precisest separatists)
were most abominable hipocrites. They were noble, and so was their hypocrisy
too; even Nobilitata: by by Christ himself fet forth to be most notorious. And
that especially in these 4. particulars: To wit, that their justice or
righteousness was 1. verbalis 2. formalis, 3. partialis, 4. vane gloriosa: It
was verbal, formal, partial, and vainglorious. Either they did but talk: or
if do; it was but outwardly, or if inwardly, it was with foolish partiality,
and preposterous difference: And in all it was with much pride and vain glory.

First, their righteousness was Verbal, in word only: they were good
speakers, they could talk well, but bad doers, they did live ill. Whatsoever
they bid you observe, that observe and do, but do not ye after their works,
for they say and do not. Mat. 23.3. A very dangerous evil both ways, both
inwardly and outwardly, both to themselves and to others.

Inwardly to themselves: For he that speaks well bears witness against
himself for doing ill: that out of his own mouth shall the evil servant be
judged without farther witness: They give evidence against themselves, and
make up their own condemnation before God, as the messenger of Readiness and of
Ishbosheths death did before David. 2 Samuel 1.16. and 4.10.

Outwardly also to others it is dangerous, for it makes men afraid of
goodness. For by speaking that which thou do not do (says Saint
Chrysostom, Ho. 38. ad pop. de humilitate and quiet.) opus mihi reddis
impossible: thou make me think it impossible to be done. For I cannot think
but if it were possible to be done, thou who art so earnest in speaking of it,
would not fail in performing it. Yea, it makes men hate goodness, and
blaspheme the author of it: Thou that makes thy boast of the Law, thorough
breaking the Law dishonorest thou God? for the name of God is blasphemed among
the Gentiles thorough you. To. 2.23. Indeed we should be all teachers: Let the
word of God dwell in you plenteously in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing
your own selves in Psalms and Hymns, and spiritual songs. Col. 3.16. Let us
consider one another to provoke unto love and good works, and let us exhort one
another. Heb. 10.24. But facilior est per exempla quam per praecepta docendi
via, the easier, the stronger, and indeeed the more (generally) required way of
teaching is by examples, rather then by precepts. Fire and water are said to be
good servauts, but bad masters: Now fire and water are emblems of the holy
spirit: whose work if it make thee docible in respect of obeying to be a good
servant, it is to thy profit and and benefit: But if it make thee docible only
in respect of commanding, only to be a good master, it is to thy hurt and
damage. The Pharisees were good masters, requiring much of others: They bind
heavy burdens and grievous to be born, and lay them on men's shoulders. But
they were bad servants practicing little themselves, They themselves will not
move one of those burdens with one of their fingers. Mat. 23.4. They turned
the work of the holy Ghost the quite contrary way: they were not like Christ,
who did both do and teach, for they taught much and did little: Their
righteousness was Verbal.

2. It was also formal, only in outward appearance, woe be to you Scribes and
Pharisees, hypocrites, for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the
platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess. Mat. 23.25. This must
needs be a heinous evil and highly offensive unto God, for as much as it goes
about to mock and deceive him: which is impossible, because he sees the heart
as well as the hand: and therefore in vain do we cleanse our hands if we do not
also purge our hearts from wickedness. The Apostle forbids eyeservice to be
done to our bodily masters, but happy are we if to our heavenly master we
rightly perform it: For then we will do it with heart as well as with hand,
because his eye is equally on both.

The Syrians thought the Israelites God to be the God of the mountains, and
not of the valleys. 1 Kings 20.23. Belike they thought he could not see them
there. Yes, he sees the lowest valleys of the heart ( Thou understandest my
thoughts long before. Ps. 139.) as well as the loftiest mounting of the hand (
According to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight. Ps. 18.24.) Yea as a
curious prayer regards not the matter or form of the window through which he
looks, but only the business that is done within, so God may be said to
look carelessly on the outward appearance, in comparison of his earnest
observation of the substance: For many times he takes no notice of outward
uncleanness, when he sees inward cleanness: As also certainly never any other
notice of outward cleanness, when he sees inward cleanness, For God sees not
as man sees, for man looks on the outward appearance, but God regards the
heart. 1. Sam. 16.7. Strive therefore rather that thy leprous hand may be
cleansed then thy clean hand lepred by putting it into thy bosom. Exodus 4.6.
The lack of this inward truth makes the Hypocrit that he can endure no trial;
For he makes a fair show in the fair sunshine of of prosperity, but is blown
away (like chafe) before the wind of affliction: And why? he has no root,
therefore he cannot endure the Cross: Or, if he bear it, Lu. 23.26. it is but
(as Simon) either for another to suffer, or but half way: he will bear it, but
not be fastened to it: he is a good doer, but a bad sufferer: he can be patient
when he hears no reviling, thankful when he endures no crossing, humble (even
to despair himself) when other men honor him: but sincerity is patient in
reproach, thankful in loss, semper idem, even like mount Sion which cannot be
removed; Else (alas) what do we but beat the air? It is not the good fight of
faith when we fight without opposition. A whited wall is not thoroughly
discerned till it be dug: Ezekiels digging the wall brought him to see the
inner abominations. Ez. 8.8. The hypocrites keep their conscience like Isaiahs
closed book. Is. 29.11. It is sealed no man can read it: but the time will
come, when the books shall be opened, and the dead shall be judged according
to things that are written in the book, Rev. 20.12. Yea when Isaiahs sealed
book shall be turned into Zachariahs flying book, filled with the curse of God,
Zac. 5.1. Jacob got a blessing by counterfeiting his elder brother Esaus hands:
but beware of counterfeiting our elder brother Christ's hands, for God is not
blind (as Isaac was) therefore it will surely bring a curse upon us, and not a
blessing. We may (with the Gibeonites) beguile the Church for a while with a
show of old bottles (ripeness of wisdom) Clouted shoes (reformation of
affection) Old clothes and moldy bread (humbleness and abstinence in
conversation) as if our Kingdom were not of this world, as if our conversation
were no nearer then Heaven, when (notwithstanding) our hearts are nearer then
our heels unto the Earth, when we are of the earth earthly, and wholly earthly
minded; and so we may be spared for a while, and keep a room in the Church, but
only as hewers of wood, heapers up of wrath against the day of wrath,
increasers of fuel for that flame of Tophet, the burning whereof is fire and
much wood, the breath of the Lord like a river of brimstone does kindle it. Is.
30.33.

Thirdly their righteousness was partial, with nice and and foolish and
preposterous difference: For they did not only call some commandents little,
as may be gathered by that, Mat. 5.19. whosoever shall break one of the least
of these Commandments: And by that, Mat. 22.36. Which is the greatest
Commandment? But farther (contrary to all sense and reason) they made least
account of the greatest, and greatest of the smallest matters: Ye tyth, mint,
and cumin, and have left the weightier matters of the Law, Judgment, mercy and
faith. Mat. 23.23. Behold their hypocrisy in both.

First in the former: For can any thing be little that concerns him who has
no measure? Can the offense of his infiniteness be liable to less the nan
infinite punishment? Or can he love God that stroketh him on the one cheek, and
strikes him on the other? or that imbraceth his body and spurneth his feet?
No, no, but Quicquid propter Deum fit, aequaliter fit: He that serves God
aright, serves him with an equal mind, and says with the Psalmist, I have
respect unto all thy Commandments. Ps. 119.6. and resolves with Saint James,
that he who fails in one point of the Law is guilty of all.

But in their later falsehood ye may behold and wonder that they should be
precisest in smallest matters: O but there was great skill and cunning in that;
for thereby, they stayed the world from looking after their greatest
businesses: For it could not be easily imagined or suspected, that they who
were so conscionable as to tyth herbs, yea, the basest and vilest of their
herbs, would be unconscionable in the greatest matters of judgment and mercy:
that they which did strain at a gnat, could possibly swallow a Cammell. Let the
discovery of this evil be enough (of it self) to make us not to learn it but
to loath it, and to learn that of Christ, This ought ye to have done, and not
to have left the other undone. The greatest duties are first to be respected,
and the least after not to be neglected.

4. Lastly, their righteousness was vainglorious: Yea, this was that whereof
all their other services did relish, and whereby, their imperfections were (as
it were) perfected and made up: For why was their righteousness verbal? why
formal? why partial? but for vainglory sake. And if this sauce sowreth the
best service (as indeed it does) how tart then did it make their services which
were every one so harsh in themselves? and how fulsome a mess did they make,
being all put together. Yea, in their vainglory we may observe (which indeed
is natural to all pride) not only the advancing of themselves: but the
abasing of other. This I say is prides property: for every ascent is by
pressing or treading somewhat down. This no doubt the Pharisees were guilty of,
else Christ would never have taxed and charged them with such a boasting, as
Lu. 18. to set them forth, speaking so proudly (to the contempt and condemning
of all others) I am not as other men are. Whereupon Saint Augustine, De ver.
Dom. ser. 36. Diceret saltem sicut multi homines: Quid est caeteri homines nisi
omnes praeter ipsum? He might have said, not as many men: but now he says, not
as other men, what is it but that he condemns all men? And that not in a few
or light things, but many and great: Extortioners, Unjust, Adulterers. Yea he
is not content with indefinite or general speaking, but dares touch upon
particular, saying, Or even as this Publican. Whereupon again Saint Augustine,
Insulat non exultat, Hom. 44. He does but insult upon his fellows, he does
not rightly rejoice in himself. There is a holy rising of the soul, a rising by
humility (as the Eagle is said to rise highest out the lowest Valley) So the
virgin mothers rising was: My soul does magnify the Lord (says she) and my
spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior, for he has regarded the low linesse of
his hand maiden: but the Pharisees rising was both presumptuous and
contemptible, to rise by trampling on the necks and crowns of others.

Thus ye see how still they dip their souls in a double die of sin,
breaking the rule of faith, which says, Christ came into the World to save
sinners, of whom I am chief. 1 Timothy 1.15. And breaking And breaking the rule of
of faith, which wills that every man esteem another better then himself.
Phil. 2.3. Acquitting where they should condemn, I know that in me, that is in
my flesh dwells no good thing. Rem. 7.18. and condemning where they should
acquit; Charity thinks not evil, believes all things, hops all things. 1
Cor. 13. Beware therefore as of double sin in every kind (for in one sin shall
thou not be unpunished) so especially of this swelling and trampling pride. For
every one that exalts himself shall be brought low, and he that humbles
himself shall be exalted.

Two SERMONS upon Ps. 8.4. The former of them (for a Funeral farewell to the
late Honorable the Conutesse of Manchester) preached in my place in Manchester
house in Canon Row, Westminster, in a Right Honoable presence Ian. 8. 1653.
Text. Psa. 8.4. What is man that thou art mindful of him!


IT is a natural thing to natural men to affect knowledge, therefore our
first parents in Paradise could not be content with all the trees in the
Garden, but they must needs have a taste of the tree of Knowledge, though God
himself had forgiven them. But it is a supernatural thing to regenerate men to
affect the Knowledge of themselves. Therefore though the heathen men had that
excellent saying among them, (...) know thy self; Yet they had it as from the
Oracle of Apollo, and they held it for no humane but for a Divine precept.
Therefore also when Adam forgetting himself, desired that high Knowledge which
was forbidden him, God himself came and told him his own, and what he was. Dust
thou art, and dust thou shall return. Upbraiding his pride and condemning his
folly, that he would presume to desire so high Knowledge, which was too
wonderful and excellent for him, and in the mean time neglect that Knowledge
which was more proper and suitable to him, namely the knowledge of himself.

Indeed Saint Paul says, Knowledge puffs up, 1 Cor. 8.1. but (no doubt) he
means outward Knowledge of things without us, which is called Scientia: as
for the knowledge of our self, which is rather to be called Conscientia (if it
be right and true) it can not puff us up, it will rather beat us down and
humble us. For he that knows himself, knows that he is a creature,
therefore that he has a creature; that he is not of himself, nor by himself,
nor for himself; but that his creation is from God: his preservation by God,
and his whole being in God: And so the knowledge of a man's self brings him to
the knowledge of God. So that as Saint John says of Love. 1. Joh. 4.2. How can
he that loves not his brother whom he has seen, love God whom he has not
seen? So may I say of Knowledge. How can he that knows not himself whom he
has seen, know God whom he has not seen? Hugo lib. 3. de Anima. Frustra
cordis oculum erigit ad Deum, qui nondum idoneus est ad videndum seipsum. He
does in vain lift up his eyes to see God, who is not yet fitted to see himself.
Chrysostom. Est primum hominis sapientiam affectantis contemplare quod ipse sit. It
is the chief property of a man that affects wisdom, to contemplate what
himself is.

Wherefore this holy Prophet David was very careful in seeking for this
knowledge, and very diligent in searching the state and condition of himself:
And howsoever (no doubt he studied other faculties, and acted other exercises,
yet in the Psalms we find him very frequent in the meditation, and
contemplation, and examination of man's estate and condition, which indeed was
the knowledge of himself. And it seems, he had studied this point so far,
that he was gone beyond himself in it, and had learned more then he was able to
utter. But he does set it forth as far as possibly he can, and as far as words
may significantly express it. For in the 144th Ps. ver. 4. he says, Man is
like unto Vanity. And in the 39th Psa. ver. 5. he goes farther, and says,
Every man at his best state is altogether vanity. And yet farther in the 62.
Psa. ver. 9. he goes farther, and spares neither high nor low, but says,
Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie: to be
laid on the balance, they are altogether lighter then vanity. Like vanity: At
the best altogether vanity. Altogether lighter then vanity. And yet farther and
beyond all, in this Psalm, and in this verse of the Psalm, he goes farther;
for he does not here say what man is, but he makes a question of it, he brings
it to a question: As if he could not tell what to say of it, as if it were a
thing not possible to be told, What is man that thou art mindful of him?

This passionate exclamation of the Prophet, concerning man, grows and
arises from his considering, the Heavens, the Moon, and the stars, as
appears in the verse next foregoing. And it so arises necessarily, and by
good consequence. For in those admirable and excellent creatures, whether he
considered their place and situation, or their influence and operation, or
their uncessant and untired motion, or their long undecaying durance and
continuaation, very just cause had he to say, What is man? And on the other
side, whether he considered that they are all made for man's use and service,
the Sun to rule the day, the moon, and the Stars to govern the night. Psa.
136. or whether he considered that man shall one day be placed higher then
they, and be advanced in glory above them all, very just cause had he then to
add the other words also, and say, that thou art mindful of him.

Here therefore (I take it) we have three things offered to our consideration.
1. The vileness or baseness of man. 2. The unworthiness of man. 3. The
providence of God. For in that, out of the consideration of the heavens, the
moon and stars, he raises the question, What is man? we may gather that he
intimates man's vileness in respect of their excellency. And in that he makes
the question with mention of Gods providence, we may gather that he aims at
man's unworthiness, in reference to Gods goodness and mercy. And in that he
makes mention of Gods mindfulnesse, we may plainly see he sets forth Gods good
providence to man, notwithstanding, his vileness in himself, and his
unworthiness toward God.

To begin with the first: man's vileness or baseness.

This will be discovered in a twofold consideration, namely, of what we are, or
belongs unto us in our corporal, and what in our temporal state and
condition; each of them again have a double reference or respect.

First for our corporal state and condition: our vileness therein will appear
in respect both of our beginning and of our ending. First for our beginning: If
I should speak of our next and nearest natural beginning (I mean our conception
and birth) I fear I should then make it too plain, and more offend your ears
then edify your souls: I should scarce (I doubt) find words modest and civil
enough to bring me off with good manners: It is a subject so unseemly for
discourse, that it may be enough (if not too much) for my present purpose only
to have named it. Passing therefore that, let us look I pray you on our first
and primary beginning, namely in Adam; or rather on Adams beginning. For though
he was the beginning of all us, yet he was not the beginning of himself: No, he
had his beginning as well as other men. And whence was it? ye may see, Genesis
2.7. The Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground. Lo then here is our
noble parentage, our high descent of dignity, our honorable house. Yea, this is
the very foundation of the house: we dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation
is in the dust. Job 4.19. And what can be more vile and contemptible then the
dust of the earth? which is trodden under foot of all creatures, which is
scattered abroad of every blast of wind: which bears no herb, nor fruit;
which serves for no use to any creature, unless for meat to the most cursed
creature, that is the serpent: Thou art cursed above all cattle, upon thy
belly shall thou go, and dust shall thou eat, says God to the serpent, Genesis
3.19.

But if any man or woman in the pride of their beauty or other excellency,
will not apprehend their vileness by considering from whence they came; yet
let them apprehend and own, and acknowledge it by considering whereto they
shall shortly return. What can be more odious to a living man then the carcass
of a dead man? what can be more loathsome to his slight? more noisome to his
smell: more infectious to his body? And yet such we all are: I may say we are:
For indeed we are so by natures judgment, disposition and inclination. I may
say such we are: for certainly such we shall be: and only God knows how soon;
such must every man and woman's body be: be it never so strong and able, never
so sound and healthful, never so fair and beautiful. And as the generation of
man originally was from the dust, which is serpents meat, so (for farther
express of our vileness, as some naturalists note) the corruption of a man is
the seed or generation of a serpent: For so they write, Ex spina humana
corrupta; out of the corrupted Carcas of a man is engendered a serpent. And Aug.
de morib. Manic. ca. 17, says, Scarabaeus ex fimo, aper ex bove, anguis vel
scorpio ex homine, other things and other corruptions, but of man's corruption
comes a snake or scorpion. I may therefore well cry out with the Son of Sirach,
Why is Earth and ashes proud? For when a man is dead, he shall inherit creeping
things, beasts, and worms. Why does not this teach us rather to be humble and
lowly, and not to have so proud a conceit of our bodies (as too commonly we
have) nor to be so excessively curious in the delicate feeding and pampering of
them, in the soft and tender lodging of them, in the superfluous trimming and
adorning of them: For it is but dust, for the feeding whereof so many creatures
suffer death: It is but dust, for the lodging whereof we spend so much time in
building tabernacles: It is but dust, for the clothing whereof we tear both
surface and bowels of the Earth, we flea the backs of beasts, we pluck the
plumes of birds. And when we have searched both sea and land for dainties to
feed it, at last it self must be meat for worms. And when we have built
stately Castles wherein to lodge it, at last it must lie in a narrow grave or
stinking toomb: And when we have robbed all creatures for rich ornaments,
wherewith to cloth it, at last it self must put on corruption.

If then (with the Peacock) we would turn our eyes from our plumes, and behold
our black legs, that is, consider our foundation, or if with that proud King,
Dan. 2. we would take notice as well of the clay feet, as of the golden head,
and silver body of our image, we should easily perceive that it is subject to
falling, and that all our glory and pride must come down to the dust.

And so much of the first consideration expressing man's vileness, namely, the
consideration of his corporal estate or condition, both in respect of his
beginning and of his ending.

Again, man's vileness also appears in consideration of his temporal estate
and condition, and that both in respect of the miseries of his life, and also
of the shortness of his life. First, for the miseries of his life, they be so
many, that I cannot propose to speak of them all: I will but touch upon his
defects, wants, and failings, in the chief supplies of life; that is food and
raiment, which will the more appear, if we compare our selves with the bruit
and unreasonable creatures. For in both those kinds of things, how easily and
readily are other creatures sped and furnished? and how hardly does man get
them.

First for food: Consider the Ravens (says our Savior) they neither sow nor
reap, they have neither storehouse nor barn. Lu. 12.24. But this is man's
portion, Genesis 3.19. In the sweat of thy face thou shall eat bread. He must
sweat for his bread before he has it; he must plow before he can sow, and sow
before he can reap, and reap, and thrash, and winnow, and grind, and Bake, and
all before he can eat. Such a world of work has he with a little grain of
Wheat, before he can make it fit sustenance to his body. And for his raiment,
the case is much alike: For whereas all other creatures are naturally clothed
every one with his own coat, some with wool, some with hair, some with fur,
some with feathers, only man (poor naked creature) has nothing of his own to
put on, but must be ber holding to other creatures for every thing that he does
wear: to the earth for his linen, to the sheep for his woollen, to the worms
for his silks, to the birds tails for his choicest and daintiest feathers
that come so near the incest noses. And indeed if every bird should take his
own feather, if every creature should exact and take from us what we have taken
from them, the sheep his woollen, the Earth its linen, and so the rest, then
should man be left like Aesops Crown: Moveat cornicula risum furtivis nudata
coloribus. All creatures may laugh at our nakedness, when we are stripped of our
borrowed feathers. Neither do we only borrow our clothing of other creatures,
but we must take a great deal of pains with that which we do borrow, before it
will be fit for our use: as may appear in the wool (our most ordinary wearing)
which requires as great plenty and as much variety of labor before it comes to
our backs, as the wheat does before it comes to our mouths. Thus is man born to
labor as the sparks fly upward. Job. 5.7.

To which difficulties of getting, if ye will add the consideration of the
hazard of keeping, and the disquietnesse of losing, which all are subject to in
all temporal things, then I doubt not but ye will be ready to subscribe to
that of the preacher, Eccles. 1.14. I have seen all the works that are done
under the Sun, and behold all is vanity and vexation of spirit.

Use 1. And (that we pass not this without some use and benefit) let us in the
first place consider, what should be the cause thereof, and what has brought
man so much below other creatures: for in his Creation he was the King of
creatures, and therefore no less happy then they: what then should be the
cause of this alteration? It was sin (beloved) it was sin (that cursed
offspring of hell) that was the bane of all our blessedness: It was sin that
made a separation between God and us: It was sin that tumed our glory into
shame, our joy into sorrow, our quiet into trouble, our happiness into misery,
our immortality into mortality. For as soon as Adam had sinned, the curses came
over his head like waves in a stormy Sea: Cursed is the earth for thy sake, in
sorrow shall thou eat of it all the days of thy life, thorns also and
thistles shall it bring forth unto thee; and dust thou art, and to dust thou
shall return. Thus ye see that sin was the mother of all our mischief, sin was
the bane that poisoned us, sin was the serpent that stung us, even unto death;
for the wages of sin is death. Romans 6.23.

And yet (such is our foul folly and monstrous madness) we are not yet out of
love with this ugly monster of Hell, that has wrought us all this woe and
misery; We are more foolish then the silly sheep, for though they feed upon
their own bane, yet they do it ignorantly, not knowing that it will poison
them; but we draw on sin with cart ropes. Is. 5.18. and drink iniquity like
water Job. 15.16. and yet we know it is most deadly bane and poison to our
souls. We are more mad then Aesops Husbandman, who finding a snake in the cold
weather frozen in the field, brought it home and warmed it it at the fire; For
he did it before he was stung or had received any harm. But we do not warm and
revive, but hatch and cherish, not a snake, but sin that is a serpent worse
then Hydra, not at our fires, but in our breasts and bosoms, not that only will
sting us, but that has already stung us (as aforesaid) unto death. They say,
that burnt children fear the fire: and yet we ripe enough in age, yet too
childish in understanding, cannot beware of the fire of sin which has already
burnt down the house of our happiness, and consumed our glory, and laid all
our honor in the dust: but (like the frantic Satyr) we be in love with this
fire, and fall to embracing it: (like the foolish fly) we play with this flame
till both our wings of faith and love be scorched, and our souls fall headlong
into Hell. Flee therefore and avoid all manner of sin, for it is the bane that
poysoneth us, it is the serpent that stingeth us, it is the fire that will
utterly consume us, unless it be quenched by the tears of repentance, and the
blood of Christ.

2. Use. Again, seeing our miseries are such in our temporal condition, in
respect of getting, keeping and losing, why then I may justly say, what is
there in this vale of tears that may deserve our love, or be worthy of our
affection? Vanity of Vanities, all is Vanity, says Solomon, and we our selves
know that we are certain in nothing here, but in an uncertain course of things,
and a continual interchange of joy and sorrow. Why then should these vanities
and vexations (like so many bewitching Cirees) transform us into swinish
quality, that we should delight rather to ly wallowing in the miry mudde and
puddle of worldliness, then to be translated into the glory and bliss of
Paradise? why should they (like so many Sirens) with their deceitful music
and melody, stop our course and stay our journey, when we should be traveling
into our own country? why should they entice us to lie floating on the
troublous and dangerous waves of this world, when we should be striving to get
into the Haven and Harbor of rest? why should they so much deceive us, as to
make us make this our Paradise where we find nothing but misery? and here to
settle our hearts where there is nothing that can satisfy our desire? Love not
the world (says Saint John) nor the things of the world, if any man love the
world, the love of the Father is not in him. Here is the privative use, here is
that we must not do? what is the positive use, what is that we must do? Our
Savior teaches both together Mat. 6.19. Lay not up for your selves treasures
upon Earth, there is that we must not do: but lay up for your selves treasures in
Heaven: there is that we must do. It is Heaven that is our Country and
inheritance, on earth we are but pilgrims and strangers: It is Heaven where we
shall have the fullness of joy, there all our comforts are crossed with cares.
Learn therefore of Saint Phil. 3.8. to count all things loss, and to judge them
to be dung that we may win Christ. Or if ye can not reach that perfection to
despise the world, yet at least labor and strive that ye may be able to use
the world as though ye used it not, and to have your conversation in Heaven.

And so much of the discovery of man's vileness, out of the consideration of his
temporal estate and condition, in respect of the miseries of his life.

The same also will appear in respect of the shortness of his life. For man's
dignity and honor in his creation, was in his being the Image of God: and that
was (partly) in his immortality, whereof (during his innocence) he was
capable: Potens non mori, having a possibility not to die. His immortality
therefore, and length of life being then his honor and excellency, it must
needs follow (by the rule of contraries) that his mortality and shortness of
life is his dishonor and vileness.

But out of the Scriptute also it may be shown, that long life is an honor,
and short life a dishonor, a reproach and vileness unto man. For in the
ninteenth of Lev. ver: 32. it is said, Thou shall rise up before the hoary
head, and honor the face of the old man. And in the Commandments, Ex. 20. the
only promise of reward (expressed) is that of long life: That thy days may be
long in the land, etc. And as this is a reward and honor, so (on the contrary)
short life is a punishment and dishonor. For, 1 Samuel 2.32. when God would
execute judgment and justice upon Eli, one of his greatest punishments was,
that there should never be an old man in his house, but his seed should be cut
off before it should be ripe. And often in the Scriptures we find long life as
a blessing to the god, ly and short life, as a curse to the wicked, on the one
side promised, on the other side threatened. Let us look then upon the
shortness of our life, and consider the vileness of our condition therein.

Ye know Moses his account. Ps: 90.10. The days of our years are threescore
years and ten, and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet in
their strength labor and sorrow. He accounts it the utmost of our age but a
little: For to that purpose he closes therewith this, for it is soon cut off,
and we fly away. It is soon cut off; as if he should say, It is a time of no
considerable endurance. But as touching the shortness of man's life, the
heathen man, Tully, by the twilight of nature, could see to say thus, Lib. de
senect. Quid est in vita hominis diu? what length is there in the life of man?
Mihi quidem ne diuturnum quidquam videtur in quo est aliquid extremum: me
thinks there is nothing long or lasting which has an end. For indeed when that
is once come, then it is all nothing. But Saint Augustine goes farther and
says, ( Conf. lib. 11. cap. 15.) that the life of man is neither long nor
short, but that it is not at all. Quo pacto illud longum est aut breve, quod
omnino non est? How can that be long or short which at all is not? Praeteritum
enim jam non est, and futurum nondum est: For the time past is not now, and the
time to come is not yet: So that then we can count our life nothing but the
same to (...) that same instant present moment of time (Now) which the
Philosophers make an end of the time past, and the beginning of the time to
come: which is indeed so near to nothing, that we can hardly make any thing of
it. For, now we live, and now again that time is past: And again, Now we live:
and now again that time is past. Dum loquimur fugit invida aetas, says the
Poet: whiles we speak, our envious time flies away. Yea, sooner then we are
able to pronounce that one syllable (Now) it is a hazard, a doubt and question
whether we live or no. So short and swift, and slippery is that time which we
may boldly venture to call our life, that it is gone before we can speak it,
yea before we can think it; It is even swifter then conceit. And therefore (to
show the shortness and swiftness of our life) the Scriptures do set it forth
by the shortest and swiftest things: as namely a weavers shuttle, Job 7.6. a
Post, Job 9.25. a tale that is told Ps. 90.9. And yet these shadows and types
(short and swift as they are) they are too long to measure the shortness of
man's life. For though the shuttle flies swiftly, yet sometimes it lies still
before the quil of yarn be quite spent: though the Post rides or runs
speedily, yet sometimes he baits and rests before he comes to his journies
end: though a tale pass quickly, yet it has some stops and pauses before it
comes to the last full point. But the life of man flies swiftly, and never
lies still till the quill of breath be quite wasted: the life of man posteth
speedily, and never baits nor rests till it comes to its last Inn of death:
the life of man passes quickly, and admits no stops nor pauses, till the
last gasp make a full period.

For when the shuttle lies still, the weavers life flies on: when the Post
baiteth, his life keeps on its journey: when the tale-teller pauseth, it is
no stop to his life: Nay, when time, or at least the measurers of time, the sun
and moon stood still in the days of Josuah, yet then there was no stay in the
course of life, but many men's death were hastened, and they ran to their ends
faster then they could run from their Enemies, as ye may read in the tenth of
Jos. Nay, when the sun went backwards in the days of Hezekiah, even then no
doubt men's lives went forward. 1 Kin. 20. for we not read that God brought
back any man's man's life when he brought back the shadow; he did only add
some time to Hezekiahs life: he gave him a longer journey to go, he did not
give him leave to go it at his own leisure and pleasure, but it was with
Hezekiah as it is with all men's else, there is no manner nor measure of stop or
stay in the course of life, but whether we wake or sleep, eat or drink work or
play, still our glasses run, and every moment we draw nearer and nearer to our
ends. My life is but a wind, says Job, Job 7.7. Thou have made my days as it
were a span long says David. Ps. 39.5. What is your life? it is even a vapor
that appears for a little time, and then vanishes away says St James, Ja.
4.14. And herein (I doubt not man's vileness is also much discovered, namely in
the shortness as well as in the miseries of his life.

And from hence I pray take out a twofold use: First, somewhat concerning God,
then concerning our selves.

1 Use. Concerning God: we have here a discovery both of his mercy and of his
justice. I say of his mercy as well as of his justice; for though indeed
shortness of life came upon man at the first, Nomine poenae in the name of a
curse, yet now (Rebus sic stantibus, the case standing as it does) the children
of God may take it for a blessing. For they endure many crosses and afflictions
in this world, but let them be comforted, their life is but short, they shall
not endure them long, and hereis Gods mercy. Again, for the wicked they
prosper and flourish, but let them fear and tremble: their life is but short.
They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave, Ps.
1.21. And here is Gods justice. The godly are Pilgrims and strangers upon
Earth, but they have an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and that fades
not away, reserved for them in heaven 1 Pet. 1.4. therefore their life is but
short that they may not long be kept from it. Behold a work of mercy. But (on
the contrary) the wicked have their portion here, and all their felicity in
this world (as they are set forth speaking, Wisd. 2.9. Come let us enjoy the
good things that are present. For this is our portion, and our lot is this)
therefore their life is but short, that they may not long enjoy it. Behold a
work of justice. And I hold it to be worth the observing, that as the strength
of sin has increased, and the times grown worse and worse, Aetas parentum
prior avis, etc. our fathers age worse then our grandfathers, ours worse then
theirs; so the age of man has decreased and grown less and less. In so much
that now adays we do scarce reach to the tenth part of the time that the
Fathers in the first ages did live. To the end that the more iniquity does
abound, and the more sin, mischief, and evil there is in the world, the less
the Saints of God might be encumbered with it, and might not be constrained to
dwell with Mesech, and to have their habitation among the tents of Kedar: Ps.
120: therefore the age of man is shortened: and here is Gods mercy. Again, the
more that wicked men do solace themselves in sin, and take pleasure in
unrighteousness; the less time they might have to delight and rejoice
therein. And here is Gods justice, Mercy and truth are met together,
righteousness and peace have kissed each other. Ps. 85.10. In this one action
of setting so short a date and stint upon the life of man, both the hands of
God ((...) may so speak with reverence) his mercy (...) justice are exercised
together. And so ye have (...) concerning God. viz. the discovery of his
mercy, and justice.

2. Use. Again, concerning our selves. Seeing our life is so short, swift and
slippery, that it flies faster then imagination. O then, I may cry out unto
you in the words of Saint Peter, what manner of persons ought we to be in holy
conversation and godliness? what a monstrous madness is it for men still to
live as if they should never dye? and never to prepare for the entertaining of
death, until they hear him knocking at their doors. Indeed it is true, death is
a great man, and a guest of Kings: and therefore commonly he sends one of
his harbingers before him (sickness or old age) to take up his lodging: But
yet many, yea very many times, he rides alone (like an ordinary guest) and
comes unlookt for: yea (like a thief in the night) at an hour when we are
most secure and unaware. And therefore it cannot be denied, but that it is a
good and godly prayer, which we were wont to have in our Letanie: From sudden
death good Lord deliver us: though indeed properly in it self death cannot be
said to be sudden to them that ore of ripe age: For how can he be said to die
suddenly, who having lived 50. or 40. or but 20. years has had all or most of
all that time to make himself ready? death therefore cannot be said to be
sudden, unless it take us in our infancy, before we have had any time to
prepare and make us ready; for the very short and swift condition of our life
is, or should be a sufficient Item, warning or notice of death. Let us
therefore remember the fearful censure and judgment pronounced upon that
servant that said in his hetar, my master will defer his coming: That servants
master will come in a day when he looks not for him, and in an hour when he
is not aware, and shall cut him off, and appoint him his portion with
hypocrites, there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. Mat. 24.48. And now my
hour being out, and requiring an end of my present discourse, I pray give me
leave to press upon you the duty of preparing for death, by the sad occasion
that is now offered to us, and is so strong upon us, namely the death of our
late honorable Lady. We little thought (but a little before the beginning of
this festival of the Nativity) that we should have kept it in so sad colors as
we have done. But God has much fulfilled on us that threatening Am. 8.10. I
will turn your feasts into mourning, and your songs into lamentation. I have
there-fore now produced this text of mortification to conclude and close our
festival (as suitable to our occasion) that I may bring you to that, Jam. 4.9.
Be afflicted and mourn, and weep, let your laughter be turned into mourning,
and your joy into heaviness. Yet not in reference to her that is gone, but to
our selves: according to that of our Savior (which we may apply as spoken by
her) weep not for me, but weep for your selves. And I also think it my duty
(though her funeral be already past) to give her this funeral farewell: yet
not to engage to her praises (as in such services the manner is) For that is
simply needless, and especially in this place where she was so well known and
so much honored. I will give her no more praise then that which St. John gives
to that Lady to whom he writes his second Epistle, whom he calls the elect
Lady. So might our late honorable Lady also have been called, for her life and
death did plentifully confirm it: And truly if that title were set upon her
tomb, it would be no scant or slight epitaph, for the height of all honor is
in being the elect of God. But I may not insist in her praises: yet (though I
may not praise her) I may praise God for her: And therein I pray you to join
with me Praise God both for giving her and for taking her; For giving her, to
be a mother both natural and spiritual. A mother natural: for she was given to
two Honorable husbands (in their turns) for fulfilling of that blessing, Ps.
128.3. Thy wife shall be as the fruitful vine, etc. so that she has seen two
honorable houses set up, and well filled by two sons of her own body: and a
third house of honor planted with two hopeful plants of her daughters body:
and has left a possibility of a 4th house to be set up in Gods good time by
her third and youngest son. And I may say also that she was given to be a
spiritual mother as well as a natural mother, even a mother in Israel: though
not in that sense, as some dames, even madames in this our age make themselves,
by taking on them the ministerial work of preaching; yet in some degrees
beyond that of winning of souls by conversation, recommended to women by Saint
Peter, 1 Pet. 3.1. For not only to her family, but upon all occasions to all
comers and visiters (who were not a few) she had always in a readiness words
edifying, and ministering grace unto the hearers: being able by the light of
Orthodox truth, to dazzle and quench false lights (now too common) as often as she
met with them. And she might be called a spiritual mother, in that she was a
fosterer and cherisher of the spiritual fathers and ministers: as many as had
any relation to her, or occasion to be known of her (they were not a few) yea,
she did not only foster and cherish them with her purse, but also encourage
by her presence, in visiting the public congregation, at least once every
sabbath day: By which constancy of her (it seems) her heavenly master whom she
served, took occasion to take her off from her work, and to bring her to her
wages. For (not forbearing on a cold foggy day) she was stricken with cold, or
some ill air, or both, so strongly, that she soon apprehended it to be her
last summoner. And accordingly it proved: for in a few days it brought her to
her end.

And as for giving her, so also for taking her; God is to be praised. For
taking her in a good time: not in that sense as is said of many, he died in
good time, when all the world were willing to be rid of him: but she died in
that good time when all that knew her would have been glad to have enjoyed her.
In a good time, even in a time of gohd old age, she having lived to her 72
year. In a good time when she knew her masters calling, and was in a right
readiness to open and come unto him, not taken suddenly, nor with any violent
distempering disease. In a good time: even in a time of peace. It was a
blessing to Josiah that he should not live to see the evil of wrath and
judgment upon his nation, but should be gathered to his grave in peace, before
trouble began. 2 Chronicles. 34.27, 28. but this our good Lady has had a greater
blessing, even to outlive troubles, and to be preserved through times of wrath,
and to die in peace, and to leave all hers in prosperous peace and safety. But
how shall we praise God for her? truly not in word alone, but in work and life
also. Awake up my glory says David, Ps. 157.8. he sets his tongue a work, but
with condition that his whole self shall not be idle: For so it follows
there: I my self will awake right early: True praising God is not a bare word
matter, but a life matter, a whole self matter: And truly we cannot better
praise God for this our deceased Lady, then in applying and conforming our
whole self to her, our whole life to hers: our eyes to her eyes, our mouth to
her mouth, our hands to her hands (as the Prophet Elisha did his to the
Shunamites son, 1 Kin. 4.34.) I mean in point of imitation. Not for any intent
to revive her, (as that prophets intent was to that dead son) but to the intent
of quickening our souls, as the lot was of that dead man who was cast into the
sepulcher of Elisha. 2 Kin. 13.21. that so living the life of the righteous
(which it seems Balaam forgot, for he made no mention of it, Number. 23.10.) We
may also die the death of the righteous, and our last end may be like hers.

And so much of the first genenerall part or branch of this text, namely the
baseness or vileness of man. In that out of the consideration of the Heavens
the moon, and the stars; this question is raised. What is man?

The second SERMON upon the same text, Ps. 8.4. concluded in the same place and
presence, Jan. 15. 1653.
THE first chief part or point of this text being before spoken of, I come now
to the second: which is man's unworthiness, which I gather here to be employed,
in that the question (what is man?) is made and moved in and with reference and
comparison to Gods mindfulness. What is man that thou art mindful of him?

This point (of man's unworthinsse to Godward) may be discovered by a twofold
consideration: namely of his indisposition to good, and his disposition or or
proneness to evil: each of which are such and so great, that it may be said,
The best man cannot do one work perfectly good, but the best man does many
works absolutely evil. I say the best man: For if it be true of the best, then
it must needs hold true of all the rest. And though Saint August. (upon this
Psalm) by man (in the first place) does understand the old man, the natural
man. And by filius hominis, the Son of man) does understand the new man the
regenerate man; yet (his purpose being far enough from mine, and yet not
contrary to mine) I may safely enough take man in the former place, at large
and indefinitely, so as including all men even the best man. And yet though I
say, the best man. I do not include our Savior Christ, to whom I know this
text is applied, and of him understood. Heb 2.6. he was more then a man; God
and man: but I speak of man naturally and properly: the best mere man cannot
do one work perfectly good: the best man does many works absolutely evil.

First, the best man cannot do one work absolutely or perfectly good. This may
sufficiently appear, by the many expressions which the scripture has to that
purpose, as that Ps. 143.2. In thy sight shall no man living be justified: and
that Ps. 62.9. surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are
a lie: and Romans 3.11. They are all gone out of the way they are altogether
become unprofitable, there is none that does good, no not one. And Romans 7.18. I
know that in me, that is in my flesh dwells no good thing. But that one place
is instar omnium, Is. 64.6. we are all as an unclean thing, and all our
righteonsnesses are as filthy rags. This Isaiah was a Prophet, and therefore if
not the best man, yet to be ranked and reckoned in the number of the best: And
yet his works, yea his best works, his righteousnesses, yea not only his, but
all other men's we may take here to be included. All our righteousness, he
affirms to be defiled, and so defiled that the translators have (for modesty)
have waived that foulness which is in the propriety of the original, and have
given it but that indefinite expression of filthy rags.

And to this plain evidence of scripture, reason it self must needs subscribe.
For all our good works and righteousness do arise and flow from our faith,
hope and love: But our faith, our hope, and our love, being (in this life) but
in part and unperfect. 1 Cor. 13.9. It must needs be that all that proceeds
from them must be likewise unperfect. And howsoever the holy Ghost (who is in
himself most perfect) be the original Author of all our goodness, yet is our
goodness in it self but unperfect. For as a young scholar in his writing
discovers his own defect and unskilfulnesse, though a skilful master holds
his hand, so we in all our righteousness, do discover our own imperfection,
though the Holy Ghost (that perfect workmaster) be our Author and guide. And as
water proceeding out of a pure Fountain, and passing through a filthy channel,
loses its purity, and becomes defiled, so our holiness and righteousness
(though it proceed from the pure fountain of grace) yet passing through our
corrupt will and affections, does lose its purity, and becomes defiled:
according to that, Job. 14.4. who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?
not one.

I shut up this point therefore with the saying of Saint Augustine, Aug. conf.
lib. 9. ca. 13. vae etiam laudabili vitae hominum si sine misericordia
discutias eam: Woe be even to the laudable life of man, if thou (meaning God)
should search and examine it. Which saying is confirmed and made up by that
of the Psalmist, Ps. 130.3. If thou Lord should mark iniquities, O Lord who
shall stand?

Again, our unworthiness to Godward appears, as our indisposition to good, in
that we cannot do one work perfectly good, so also in our disposition to evil,
in that the best man does many absolutely and truly evil, many sins.

If I should go about to make proof of this, I should but light a candle to
the Sun, or cast water into the Sea, I should take but a needless work in
hand, So plentiful and pregnant is the Scripture in this case, and so
powerful is every ones conscience, (even as a thousand witnesses) that we have
every one cause enough to cry out with Manasses in his prayer, I have sinned
above the number of the sand of the Sea, my transgressions O Lord are
multiplied, my transgressions are exceeding many. And with David, Ps. 38.4.
Mine iniquities are gone over mine head as an heavy burden, they are too heavy
for me. And with Saint Paul, Romans 3.23. All have sinned and come short, or (as
some read it) are deprived of the glory of God: deprived of glory, and invested
with shame: for to us belongs confusion of face. Dan. 9.7.

Use. This may make us all to start at the fight of our selves, as of the most
terrible and fearful thing: for what can be more terrible then to be under the
power of sin, and consequently of death and condemnation. And such an one shall
the best man see himself to be, if with a single eye he look simply on
himself: And at his best, he cannot see himself clean without sin. For who
can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin? Prove. 20.9. The
holy man Job, because of the grievous sores that were upon his body, cried out,
factus sum mihimet ipsi gravis: I am become a burden to my self, Job 7.20. And
shall not we (being all overspread, not in body only, but also in soul, not
with sores, but with sins) shall not we much more cry out and say, I am
become a burden to my self? Did the leprosy of his body make him so grievous
to himself, and shall the leprosy of our souls nothing disquiet us? Was he so
oppressed with a pestred carcass, and shall we feel no weight of a festred
conscience? His body was not himself, yet he says, the sores of that make him
a burden to himself: our soul is our self, (Anima cujusque est quisque, every
man's soul is himself) and shall not we say, the sins of that do make us a
burden to our self? Fly therefore from thy self, and run away from thy self:
and never leave running till thou have run out of thy self, and run into
Christ: till thou have lost thy self and found Christ; till thou have put off
thy self, and put on the Lord Jesus; till thou have gotten thy worthiness of
hell, laid upon his Cross, and his worthiness of Heaven laid upon thy back.
So Saint Paul in doing what he would not, and willing what did not, became a
burden to himself, and cries out, Romans 7.24. O wretched man that I am, who
shall deliver me from the body of this death. And so running out of himself,
he runs into Christ, saying, I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord.

And so I come to the third and last general part of the text, viz. Gods
providence toward man, notwithstanding his vileness, notwithstanding his
unworthiness. That thou art mindful of him?

That old and well worn sentence so often used in oratories, was never more
justly taken up by any then now it may be me, Rerum copia verborum inopem
facit, plenty of matter makes me scanty of words: I have a feast here set
before me furnished with such varieties, that I know not which to taste first. A
subject so large, a discourse so copious, that I know not how either to begin
or end it. For how shall I begin that which has no beginning? or how shall I
end that that has no ending? The time would fail me, yea my wits and
understanding too, if I should go about at full to declare it. But somewhat I
must say of it, that ye may see it, though but as in a glass darkly, and that
ye may know it, though but in part and unperfectly. Thou art mindful of him.

Gods mindfulnesse of man was before time; Is in time; It shall be after time.
It was before time in electing him. It is in time many ways; in creating him,
in preserving him, in redeeming him, in raising him: It shall be after time in
eternal and everlasting glorifying him.

First it was before time in electing him. Before time? yes, before time real.
Nunc initiativum times beginning as to the creature. There was imaginary time
for ever, which was Gods eternity. But our time real began (with the Creation)
to have its notion to us, and its distinction and constitution by the motion of
the celestial luminaries, Genesis 1.14. And before this our time I say, was God
mindful of man in electing him. For we have it. Ephesians. 1.4. He has chosen us in
him (that is in Christ) before the foundation of the world. Before the world or
any creature therein, was God mindful of man: And so mindful, that he not
only purposed to make man, but in his infinite alknowledge foreseeing, that
man being made, would mar, destroy, and cast away himself again, he chose
some whom he would save, restore, and recover out of that mass of perdition
and confusion.

He chose therefore, but not according to works foresseen: for that had not
been (properly chosing) if there had been any preexisting cause or provocation,
for choosing is a most free action. And if God had chosen according to works
foreseen, he must needs have chosen all or none at all: For all) once lost in
Adam) were alike in disposition, or rather in indisposition to good works: God
could see no more of good in one then in another. He may be said to (...) all
beings, as well past, and future, as present. Ye^ (in a notionall sense) he may
be said to see in himself many works that never were or shall be, but only
might be if he so pleased to work, for he knows (and he only) the extent of
his own power. But to say God sees (in the creature) that which is not, is a
contradiction. And what good was or is there in Adam, or any of his children
fallen? Even as much good (that is as much of spiritual life) as is of
natural life in a dead body. For, In Adam all die. 1 Cor. 15.22. Now if a man
should go into Golgotha, a place of dead men's sculs, or could go down into the
bottom of the Sea to look among the drowned bodies in a sunk ship, in which
of those sculs or bodies should he find more disosition to to life then in
another. Indeed the resurrection shall raise them all: And God by the first
resurrection does raise whom he will. But there is no more disposition to the
first in the dead soul, then is to the second in the dead body, but God in each
acts powerfully and freely. And so may be concluded in his electing also to
have done. According to that, Ephesians. 1.5. Having predestined us according to
the good pleasure of his will.

Again, He chose some, a few, a small number, a a little flock. Not simply, but
comparatively in reference to the greater number of the reprobate: O let us
admire his mercy, that he would vouchsafe to choose any (all being lost) let
us not call his justice in question, why he would not choose all. For he has
mercy on whom he will have mercy, Romans 9.15.

Again, he chose, not indefinitely, or at peradventure, but a certain number of
certain persons: A certain number, for he will not make them mere or less. Of
certain persons: for he will not alter or change them. And because he will
not, it may be said he cannot: having once decreed, he cannot deny himself, 2 Timothy 2.13. With God there is not yea and nay, 2 Cor. 1.20. but his foundation
remains sure. 2 Timothy 2.19. It is not to be altered. His name is Jehovah: his
name is, I am; names of conscience, names of continuance, names of perfection:
Yesterday and to day, and the same for ever. Heb. 13.8. with whom is no
variableness or shadow of turning. Ja. 1.17

Again, he chose them whom he did choose, not to beidle, not to be secure, not
to think it needless for them now to take care how they live, because of the
infallibility and immutability of their choosing, but he has chosen us that we
should be holy and without blame before him in love. Ephesians. 1.4. And that we
should be conformed to the image of his form. To. 8.92.

From hence (as from a fountain) do flow all the other works of mercy. For why
were we created? because we were elected? why were we redeemed? because we were
elected. Why were we called? why are we sanctified? why are we justified? why
shall we be glorified? because we are elected.

O fountain of grace! O welspring of life! O unspeakable mercy! What is man O
Lord, that thus beforetime thou were mindful of him!

Secondly, God is mindful of man in time, and many ways. I have named four.
In creating him: In preserving him: In redeeming him: In raising him.

First, in creating him. He made all things, but man in a special manner: he
made man (as I may say) with a witness: other things by his word, He spak the
word and they were made, he commanded and they were created; but man was made
by his counsel, faciamus hominem, let us make man, Genesis 1.26. And no marvel:
for the reason there follows, he was to be a special piece, he was to be
Gods image: Let us make man in our image. He made him in his own image, in
knowledge, in righteousness, and true holiness. In his own Image: for he gave
him a body potens non mori, and a soul non potens mori, (in respect of his
decree) a body that might, a soul that must live for ever. In his own image,
for the soul is three in distinct properties or faculties, vegegation, sense,
reason, and yet but one in her unseparable essence. In his own image: for the
soul is in man, the Microcosme, the little world, somewhat alike as God is in
the great world: Totum in toto, and totum in qualibet part: whole in the
whole, and whole in every part, and yet not In loco, not included in place.

2. Again, (in time) God is mindful of man, secondly in preserving him: For
God is not like a Shipwright or Carpenter, who leaves his work or building to
it self as soon as he has set it up: but God is mindful of man, as well in
preserving as in creating him. Yea, this also (to the express of Gods
perfection) may be said that he cannot do, he cannot make any thing to be or
subsist of it self, without him. For so there should be something where at his
power should be limited, and whereto his strength should not extend: And so he
should not be infinite, he should not be almighty, he should not be himself: he
should not be God: therefore it is of necessity that to every work which God
makes, he add also a butteresse, a prop, or supporter of his of his power to
sustain it: which whenever he takes away the work (what ever it be) soon
decays and perishes: For in him we live, and move, and have our being. Act.
17.28. And when thou hidest thy face, they are troubled, when thou take away
their breath they die, and are turned again to their dust. Ps. 109.29. And in
that Psalm, we have a large discourse of the mindfulnesse of God toward man
in providing him wine that makes glad the heart of man, and oil to make him a
cheerful countenance, and bread to strengthen man's heart. Yea, his providence
extends to the least things that do concern us: There cannot a tear fall from
our eyes, but he does bottle it up: Put my tears into the bottle. P. 56.8.
there cannot an hair fall from our heads, but he does take notice of it, for
even the hairs of our head are all numbered. Luke 12.7. Yea, (which is of us
more considerable, because to us more terrible) there cannot a word fall from
our mouths, but he does register it, for every idle word that men shall speak,
they shall give account hereof in the day of judgment. Mat 12.36.

3. Again, God is mindful of man, thirdly (in time) in redeeming him. And this
work has many parts; too many for me to speak of at this time: I can but name
them. His miraculous incarnation, his charitable life and peregrination, his
painful and shameful death and passion, descension, resurrection, his
ascension. And hereto also pertains his calling us, his sanctifying us, his
justifying us, and his pawning and pledging everlasting life unto us.

4. Again, fourthly and lastly, God is mindful of man in time, in raising him,
he is mindful even of our very dust and ashes, when we be dead and rotten.
For (says Job) I shall see God in my flesh. Job. 19.26. And he shall change
our vile body, and make it like to his glorious body says Saint Paul, Phil.
3.21. And this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put
on immortality. 1 Cor. 15.53. And then shall Ezekiels mystical or parabolicall
vision be literally fulfilled, Every bone shall come again to his bone, and the
flesh and sinews shall grow upon them, and the skin shall cover them. Ezekiel.
37. And Saint Aug. de Genesis ad lit. lib. 3. ca. 17. is very punctual and
emphaticall upon this point. Quasi vero quicquam intersit ad nostram utilitatem
ista caro jam examinis per quos transitus eat, etc. As though (says he) it
were any thing considerable what becomes of our body being dead, seeing that by
whatsoever passages it shall go; It shall thence be drawn out again by the
almighty power of the Creator to be new formed. And again in another place,
Enchirid. ad Laur. cap. 88. Non autem perit Deo, terrena materia de qua
mortalium creatur caro, the earthly matter of man's body is never lost to God:
sed in quemlibet cinerem pulveremve solvatur: but into whatsoever dust or ashes
it be dissolved: In quoscunque halitus aurasve diffugiat, Into whatsoever,
spirits, or airs it fly away: In quorumcunque aliorum corporum substantiam vel
in ipsa elementa vertatur: Into whatsoever substance of other creatures (be it
into the very elements) it be turned: In quorumcunque animalium etiam hominum
cibum cedat unto whatsoever food of other creatures (be it of mankind) it be
converted: Illae humanae animae puncto temporis redit, It shall at last in a
monent of time return to that soul: Quae illam primitus ut homo fieret
cresceret, viveret, animavit: which did at first it that it might be made a
man, and live and grow.

3. As before time, and in time so also 3ly. and lastly after time, God is or
shall be mindful of man, in or by eternal and everlasting glorifying him.
After time I say, after nunc finiens or terminationum, the end or consummation
of created time. For the day of judgment is called the last day. Jo. 6.39, 40.
and Rev. 10.6. the angel swears that time shall be no more. Yet then I say
when all distinction of time shall grow up into one perfect constant day of
eternity, then shall God be mindful of man in bringing him to, and preserving
him in the fullness of joy and pleasure for evermore. For, we shall be caught
up in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so shall we be ever with the
Lord. 1 These. 4.17. O infinite love, O unmeasurable mercy, O beginlesse, O
endless providence, what is man, O Lord, what is man, that thus before time,
in time, and after time, thou art mindful of him?

I shall include this point (and so the whole text) with a brief touch of a
twofold use. This last Doctrine of Gods mindfulnesse of man, teaches us to be
thankful: and it teaches us not to be careful.

1. Use. First it teaches us to be thankful. For seeing Gods providence is
such and so great toward us, and it is all Gratis. It is but our thankfulness
that he requires for all (for he says) who so offers praise, glorifieth
me. Ps. 50.23. And David says, My goodness extends not to thee, Ps. 16.2.)
what a shame will it be for us then to be found unthankful? Praise him
therefore for thy soul, and for spiritual blessings: praise him for thy body,
and for temporal blessings: according to that Ps. 101.1. Bless the Lord O my
soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy name. Bless the Lord O my
soul and forget not all his benefits; which forgiveth all thine iniquities;
there is for the soul and for spiritual things; And ver. 5. which satisfies
thy mouth with good things, so that thy youth is renewed like the Eagles:
there is for the body and for temporal things.

2. Use. Again it teaches us not to be careful. This is our Saviors teaching,
Mat. 6.35. I say unto you, take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or
what ye shall drink etc. And why? ver. 26. behold the fowls of the air, they
sow not, neither do they reap, etc. And ver. 30. If God so cloth the grass of
the field, shall he not much more cloth you, Oye of little faith? He argues a
majore ad minus, from the less to the greater. I may therefore doubtless in
this argue a majore ad minus, from the greater to the less. He does the lesser
(says Christ) therefore he will much more do the greater (may I in my sense
say) therefore he will much more do the lesser. He provideth for the soul
spiritual things here, and eternal things hereafter. And if he deal so freely
and liberally in those greater matters, shall he not much more do the same in
these viler earthly things? what man having received wine of his friend, will
be doubtful whether he would afford him water or no? What man seeing his
friend send his son to help him, will make question whether he would spare him
his servants or no? What man seeing his friend offer his life for him, will
suspect or be jealous whether he would impart unto him his goods or no? And
seeing God has given us the wine of spiritual joys, shall we be doubtful
whethether he will afford us the water of temporal comforts? Seeing God has
sent his son to help us, shall we make question whether he will spare us his
servants, his creatures to serve us? Seeing our Savior has given his life to
redeem us, shall we be jealous that he will not impart to us his goods, his
corn and wine, and oil to sustain us? No, no, but cast all our care upon him,
because he cares for us. Yet cast it in humility, acknowledging our vileness,
acknowledging our unworthiness. For so humbling our selves, we shall be sure
to be exalted.

FINIS.
