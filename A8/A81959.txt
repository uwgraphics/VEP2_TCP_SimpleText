June 1650.

DYVE as relating to the Business He treats of From the Hague 10./20. July 1650.

HAGVE, Printed by SAMUEL BROUN, English Bookeseller. 1650.

MY LORD,
NOt long after my arrival at the Hague, intimation was given me by a noble
friend (upon some casual discourse with him of the affairs of Ireland) that
your Lordship had a great desire to be satisfied as well in some particulars
touching the conduct of that business since my Ld. Leiut. last went thither,
as in what condition the Kingdom stood at the time when I came from thence;
Whereupon not knowing whether the necessity of my occasions, (or indeed the
usual thwartnesse of my fortune in what I most covet) would allow me so great
a hapiness as personally to wait upon you before I left this country, I held
it my duty in that case to leave some testimony behind me of my obedience, and
readiness to serve you, wherein rather then fail, I have adventured to engage
my self in this relation, though conscious of mine own disability to perform
it in such sort as the subject requires, the unpollished rudeness of so plain
and course a style, affording no luster of ornament, or beauty that may render
it worthy to be presented to a person of your eminency; which may the easier in
my behalf admit of excuse, whose profession, and practice has all ways bin
accustomed rather to use a sword then a pen: the only plea I have therefore to
offer to your Lordship for this presumption is the candor, and integrity where
with it is written, which I have religiously observed through the whole body of
the discourse, endeavoring to vindicate truth, which I find highly suffering
by the world, either through the malice, and malignity of these unhappy times,
or for want of clear, and impartial information: which I am confident your
Lordship, and all who rightly know me, will expect from my hands, and which
sincerely I promise to afford, without suffering the Biasse of any passion, or
private respect, or interest whatsoever to sway me in the least circumstance
contrary to truth; unless by misaprehension, and want of judgment, or by the
misrepresentation of the ablest, and best knowing persons, I may unhappily have
bin misled. But, that I may the better do it, it will be necessary a little to
look back, and take a short view of the desperate time, wherein his Excy. the
Marquess of Ormond, under took this work; and to reflect upon the sad face
that was then upon His Majesty's affairs in all his three Kingdoms.

In England as your Lordship may well remember, the King was not only made a
close prisoner, his Crown, his life, and the succession of his posterity
declared against, but also all those parties that stood for him there, or had
declared in his behalf, and taken arms for his rescue, were wholly dispersed,
and subdued: yea and all other men, whose parts, honesty, or public interest
made them worthy of a suspicion, either imprisoned, banished, or utterly
disarmed.

In Scotland the army raised for the freedom, and restoration of the King,
having bin unfortunatly lost (under the leading of Duke Hamilton in
Lankashire,) all that acted by the Kings commission were not only compelld to
lay down arms, but after being declared incapable to sit any more in
Parliament, or to have any share in Government, some of them proscribed, and
expelled the land: whilst Cromwell for having countenanced them in these
proceedings, was saluted at Edinburgh, Preservator of the nation; thus you see
there are two Kingdoms, wherein is neither Garrison, nor army left at the Kings
devotion; nor any person scarce at liberty, that durst own either him or his
quarrel.

Ireland only remains to be considered, and that God knows a woeful
spectacle, cantonized into several sundry factions, drawing all diverse ways,
and driueing on several interests; there was Jones, Monk, and Coote playing
an Independent game as eagerly as might be; there were the Scots Patronizinge
the Covenant, and Presbitery; there was O Neale, and the Nuntiated party of the
Clergy, that with might, and maine (under the color of Religion,) were
promoteing a foreign interest, in case they could not make a Prince at home;
there was the counsel of the confederats, together with all the ancient
English, and some of the Irish their adherents (who being more moderat, and
averse to such desperate courses, awakened also with the miseries that oppressed
them already, and the ruin that menaced them out of England) made fresh
applications into France, unto the Queen, and the Prince his highness, that
my Lord Leiut. and the Kings Authority might again be sent amongst them;
whereupon these two factions grew to so great a fewde, that the latter were all
excomunicated by the first; and the first proclaimed Traitors by the latter.

Besides all these, there was Inchiquin, who having recollected himself at
last, and dislikeing the revolutions in England, had prevailed with his party,
to declare for the King. Whereupon he made a cessation with the counsel of the
confederats, in expectation of my Lord Leiuts, coming over; which cessation
being violently opposed, both by the spiritual, and temporal sword of the
Nuntio, and O Neale, induced finally my Lord Marquess of Clanricard, (who from
the time of my Lord Leiunts. going to sea from Dublin, had retired himself,
and his family to a place convenient to ship away: as soon as he should
despair of being able to serve the King by his further stay) to take arms,
and draw together his army to countenance the cessation, and to make way for
my Lord Marquess of Ormond with the Kings Authority; to which he did highly
contribute, by awing, and curbing the town of Galloway, at that time the seat
of the Nuntio, and the principal receptacle of the most factious people in the
Kingdom; as also by his succesfull reduceing of Fortfaukland, Athlone, James
town, and the greatest part of the Province into his power; But to the end
that you may see with what steadiness that Honorable Person in the depth of
all these revolutions has still adhered unto the service of the King and the
Interests, of the Crown even against those that colored al their designs and
practices over, with the artificiallest and most deludeing pretenses of
Religion (since it is an example fit to be recommended to posterity and truly
worthy your lordships knowledge) you may please to read the particular conduct
of this his undertakeing in the Copy of a Letter (I send you herewithall) writ
from the Marquis himself to Mr. Walsingham then in France.

In this posture was Ireland when my Lord Leiut. came again upon the stage;
with his hands in effect empty of arms, and his purse of money, without the
countenance, or assistance of any foraigne state, whereby to unite this
distracted people, and recover unto His Majesty this divided Kingdom; before
Cromwell were at leisure, to make an expedition thither, which as yet either
the murder of the King not yet perpetrated, or the unsettlement of that
misshapen cub of his new common wealth detained him from.

Yet notwithstanding all these disadvantages of having neither arms wherewith
to awe, or money wherewith to buy men into their duty, or any party ready to
embrace him (my Lord of Clanricard only excepted) but upon the rack of screwed
conditions; yet at length by Gods blessing and his own prudent management of
affairs, joined with the great interest he had in that people, he ordered
matters so, as in few months to sowlder most of these factions together; and
make a peace, whereunto all but O Neale, and the Independent party did willingly
submit. O Neale complained that the conditions were neither safe, nor large
enough, as to the concernments of Religion, and the Province of Vlster: and the
Independent party exclaimed that the Protestant Religion, and the English
interest forsooth were both betrayed by it: so oposite were, then, these two
parties in their public quarrels, about the peace, who you shall see not
long after shake hands behind the curtain against the Kings Authority, which
indeed is the block they both stumble at; for as to the pretense of Religion
in the first, it is manifest how vain it was, for you shall find that party
embrace the peace herafter upon the very same conditions; And as to their
Provincial concernments, they were even then well enough satisfied that my
Lord Leiut. could in no sort be blamed, he being put upon the choice whether he
would accept of the rest of the confederats, and the English party in Monster
upon the terms in the printed articles, without any further concessions unto
Owen O Neale, and the Vlster army: or else in yielding to their demands, loose
both the other two; which may suffice to justify my Lord Leiut. in that peace
against their complaints. The invectives of Coll. Jones, and his party were
urged with far greater art, and fallacies, which being industriously published
in print, were received, I fear, with too much applause by many of the people
of England, that either were unwilling, or unable to judge a right; and being
fortified by a national animositie, had too great an influence, even in
Ireland it self, upon the English army under the command of my Lord Inchiquin;
wherein sundry of the principal Officers were so averse to a conjunction with
the Irish, that dureing the time of the treaty they conspired to have surprised
both my Lord Leiut. and the Lord President, and to have delivered them up to
the Parliament: which in all probabillity had then taken effect, had it not
bien accidentally prevented by their unexpected departure from Caricke, upon a
petition, or representation from the counsel of the confederat Catholics to
His Excy. that he would remove thence to his own house at Kilkeny; as a place
more fit for the conclusion of the treaty: Now whether those sons of Zerviah
were so strong, and powerful in the army that they could not be called to an
account, or whether it was conceived more conducible for the advancement of His
Majesty's affairs to reduce them with time, and gentleness to a right
understanding, then to loose so many persons of abillity, and authority, I know
not, only I fear their impunity was either the sole, or concurrent cause of
the general revolt, and apostasy of those garrisons since. But for a full, and
satisfactory answer to all objections, that can be made by either of the
parties upon that subject, I have taken the boldness to send your Lordship
together with this, the copy of a letter (I found lying by me) that was writ by
Mr. Walsingham, in return to the last of Jones his printed papers, (after it
was thought fit by my Lord Leiut. to reply no more as from himself) which
speaks so much truth, and reason, that though it came to Jones his hands, he
was well content to give over his paper war; in that letter your Lordship may
find the peace so firmly asserted, and both the justice, and necessity of what
was don so well demonstrated, as wauing all arguments of mine own in that
behalf I refer you Lordship thither for an entire satisfaction.

Only I shall take leave to tell your Lordship this, that his Excy. in
associating the Irish and my Lord of Inchiquin together, and in making up of
this peace, has what in conditions to the one, and to the other, so bound up
himself, as he may well be said to be Lord Leiut. but upon curtesy, until the
time of Parliament; having granted unto my Lord Inchiquin the sole command, and
ordering of those forces, and garrisons he brought with him to the Kings
obedience; and having oblidged himself unto the confederats to authorize only
those Officers, and to march in the head of that army which their Commissioners
should present unto him. By this your Lordship may perceive the necessity unto
which His Excy. was brought, but it could not be avoided, either these things
must be assented unto by him, or the peace must not be made.

And in this sort my Lord Liunts. hands were manacled in effect as to the
militia, he having no more to do, but only to go in, and out before an army of
several factions, and religions much averse to one another: the Officers
whereof though never so much disliked by him he could not but admit of; if
either the one party, or the other insisted upon their conditions; it cannot
therefore seem strange, (when rightly considered,) that Inchiquins, and the
Irish forces were never incorporated together, nor indifferently intermingled
in all the garrisons; neither why the army was either so ill disciplined, and
officerd, (as in truth it was,) since what has bin said is a full answer, as I
conceive, to that objection.

The difficulties His Excy. also had, to make these several Factions
understand either him, or one another, were very great; witness the printed
Declaration the Mounster forces extorted from him before the conclusion of the
peace, and those many diffidences, and demurs the Irish made thereupon; both
which parties he must of necessity humor, and comply with, or else mutinies,
and defections could not be avoided. The case being such, your Lordship (who
have commanded great armies, and had experience in some measure of these
inconveniences) very well knows, that the skill must needs be great in a
General so to devide himself amongst them, as to keep them in obedience, and
contented. My Lord Lieut. by the gentleness, and affability of his
disposition, and his great prudence in foreseeing, and preventing evils,
wrestled a long time succesfully, with all these inconveniences, tuneing all
these discords into harmony; and at length as soon as money could be got to
move withal, or the ground affoorded grass for their horse, a part of the
army is drawn together under the command of the Earl of Castle-haven (general
of the horse) whose prevaileing against several of O Neales, and Jones his
garrisons joined to the voluntary coming in of many of their soldiers, and
surrender of their holds, gave very much credit, and reputation to the Kings
army.

All the time that this is in doing my Lord Leiut. was busied in treating with,
and courting Jones, and Owen O Neale unto the Kings obedience; the first of
which (being as is believed) corrupted by Cromwells bribes, and large promises,
positively declines my Lord Leiuts. favor, as apeares by their printed
letters: the latter having at last waued all things concerning religion, more
then what was granted in the peace, insists finally upon the command of 6000.
foot, and 800. horse, together with those other conditions that since were
granted him; the Commissioners will permit my Lord Leiut. to allow him no more
but 4000. foot and 600. horse, which number they obstinatly refused to exceed;
denying him also several other of his lesser demands, whereupon O Neale seeing
them willing either to leave him quite out, or to have him come in upon such
terms as he judged inconsiderable, (they peradventure thinking themselves able
to do the work without him) makes present application unto Monk, and Jones,
either to be revenged, upon the Commissioners, my Lord of Inchiquin, the Scots,
and all the rest, that he conceived to oppose him, or else, as he afterward
said, to make himself more considerable, and thereby facilitate his conditions
with them.

Whatsoever his motive was, at last Monk makes an agreement with him, in the
name of the Parliament;) though they very tamely upon Cromwells motion did
afterward think fit to disclaim him) upon which score, howsoever, he
assisted them all he could, undertaking the releife of Derry, which he
afterward effected; and notwithstanding that his Excy. dureing all this time
was very sencible of the great consequence of Owen O Neales coming in, or
standing out, in order to the service, or disservice of the King, and that he
looked upon the dispute of denying him the command of 6000. men, when they were
content to entrust him with 4000. as a strange kind of oversight in the
Commissioners, and the rest concurring with them, the rather, because he knew
that by his standing out, that accursed quarrel between the Kings, and the
Nuntios party, (not unlike that of the Guelphs, and Gibbelines in Italy) was
kept on foot, the refractory Clergy were countenanced, and upheld in credit
with the people, and the great Cities were animated to refuse guarrisons, to
deny the payment of impositions, and to disrespect both the Lord Leiut, and the
Commissioners: yet was it not in his power to help it by any means; unless
he would have broken conditions with them, which no consideration of any
advantage, how great soever, could induce him to do, so tender has he bin ever
of his faith and engagements given: The business being grown past remedy, he
gives the treaty over, and the season inviteing him to take the field, his army
being drawn together, he bends his thoughts wholly now upon the reduction of
Dublin, yet meets with a very unexpected rub in the beginning of his march,
for the English forces of Mounster would not move, neither would the Vlster
Scots unanimously submit before my Lord Inchiquin be declared Leiut. General
of the army: which command had bin imediatly upon the peace conferd on my Lord
Marquess of Clanricard (now upon his march toward Slego) but this demur was
also overcom by his Lordships being content, to part with that command, rather
then the Kings service should suffer through any concernment of his: soon after
my Lord of Castle-haven, upon my Lord of Inchiquins horse refuseing to obey his
orders, quits the field in distaste, and retires to Kilkeny; which his Excy.
seemed willing for avoiding greater inconveniences to suffer, giving the Earl
of Castlehaven the charge of seeing the contributions brought in, and the Command
of the country in his absence.

These difficulties overcome, His Excy. makes directly for Dublin, all the
garrisons in his way (but Ballisonan) by force, or fair means surrendering to
him, yet is he set forth so slenderly provided with money, that near Kildare
the army is ready to mutiny, and fall to pieces for want of a very small sum,
had not a worthy person (that was there but accidentally) supplied them in that
extremity; this straight also being overpast, and my Lord of Inchiquins forces
being come wholly up, they hold on for Dublin, and compel Jones that was drawn
out as far as the Naas with what strength he could make to interupt them, to
retire into the town; whither being come at last, and finding it competently
well fortified, and plentifully manned both with horse, and foot, in so much
that it was judged no ways fit to hazard the army upon a desperate assault, and
being not as yet a number able to invest the place, especially whilst O Neale,
and Monk, together with the garrisons of Drogheda, and Trim lay so convenient
to attempt upon them; it was resolved that my Lord Leiut. should with the
greatest part of his army encampe at Finglasse, from thence to awe, and
distress the town, and be ready to countenance any stirs, or revolts within,
whilst my Lord of Inchiquin with a great body of horse, and above 2000 foot
endeavors to take in Trim, and Drogheda; all this time His Excy. found great
wants to encounter with, his provisions, and contributions coming in so slowly,
and disproportionably to the necessities of his army; and many factions to
compose, and temper, the Mounster, and the rest of the English forces murmuring
against the liberty the Irish had there in the exercise of their religion, and
the Irish again repining to see themselves murmured at; but more especially to
see the English Mounster forces (though they were fewer in number, and had
contributions of their own) to swallow up both their pay, and provisions also;
which though the rest of the army did petition against, His Excy. could in no
ways remedy, being constrained to humor, and comply with that party, as being
a people so ticklish, and unsteady, that, if disgusted, might probably either
side with Jones, or retireing to their own garrisons, compel the army to with
draw, from Dublin by declaring themselves for the Parliament.

Sr. Tho. Armstronge, and my Lord Moore being come in to my Lord Inchiquin;
Coll. Mark Treuors (that was but newly declared for the King) having got notice
of a choice party of O Neales, sent to Dundalke to convay thence such arms,
and ammunition as Monk had undertaken to suply him withal, invites my Lord
Inchiquin to intercept them, who came so oportunely thither, that he gained O
Neals suplie of ammunition, with the utter defeat of his party; whereupon soon
after the gaining of Drogedah, which ensued imediatly upon O Neales defeat;
Dundalke it self being summoned, the soldiers compelled Monk to a surrender,
and themselves took arms for the King.

Imediatly after this defeat of his party, O Neale hastneth toward the releife
of Derry which was the only town in that Province untaken, all the rest being
already reduced by the Lord of Ards, Sr. George Monro, and Coll. Treuors, who
were now hindered only by O Neales army, and the Siedg of Derry, from bringing
up a considerable body of horse, and foot to the leaguer of Dublin. Where may
be observed how great a prejudice the faction of those men (who desireing out
of animosities, and ends of their own, to staue of O Neal and his party from
the benefit of the peace; stood chaffering with him about his command of 4000,
or 6000. men, and other trifles) have don to the Kings service, and to the
whole Kingdoms in deprivinge themselves thereby, not only of the forementioned
assistance of the Scots, but also of the possession of London Derry, together
with so considerable an addition of forces as O Neale could then have brought;
whereby not only the whole Province of Vlster would have bin secured to the
King; but Dublin it self either reduced, or so strongly furrounded, that it
would have bin impossible either for Jones to relieve himself, or Cromwell to
invade the Kingdom: which, notwithstanding all these fore mentioned
disadvantages, was, upon the matter, even gained already, and would have bin
entirely, without any manner of question, if it had fortuned that His Majesty
had feasonably come thither himself in person, which by all parties was
desired with infinite passion, but especially by those whose prudence made them
best able to judge how effectual his presence would be, not only for the
animating of his own loiall party, but also suppressing of all factious humors,
and uniteing all interests cheerfully, and unanimously to go on against the
common enemy: which must soon have put a period to that war, and made his
authority absolut in that Kingdom, without dispute; for as upon his arrival
His Majesty should have found Mounster entirely in the Irish, and my Lord of
Inchiquins possession, Vlster all reduced, but the fort of Culmore, and Derry
into the hands of the Scots; Conaght by the Marquess of Clanrieards fortunate
gaining the strong fort of Slego (with what else the enemy had then remaining
in that Province) wholly cleared: in Leinster nothing left for rebellion to
nestle in, but Dublin and Ballisonnan; both which were so well attended upon,
that the defendants had but little pleasure to air themselves without the
circuit of their works; so by his coming he would undoubtedly have diverted
Owen O Neale (who would imediatly have submitted unto the person of the King
from releiving London Derry, and thereby have secured both that town, and
Province, with Dublin also as it is thought) for they that had reason to know
Jones his mind apprehended that his leaving the Kings party did proceed from a
Pique either against my Lord Leiut. or Sr. Robert Byron about a Leiut. Colls.
place, which was conferd over his head upon an other; and that then the scene
being altered in England, and his old friends out of authority there, his new
terms with the Independents also yet unmade, he had himself come over, if the
King had bin there in person; or if not, yet his party would have all deserted
him; and the work had bin don one way, or other; that Kingdom wholly reduced
without ablow; all factions, as I said before extinguished; and His Majesty had
an army of above 20000. men to have employed where he pleased.

However, thitherto you see my Lord Leiut. (having cemented together so many
differing parties, and mastered almost incredible difficulties) has with
prudence, and success conducted the business, and is hindered only by the
wilfulnes, and faction of some of his own party from completing the work.
After the taking in of Trim (which followed soon upon the surrender of
Dundalke,) my Lord of Inchiquin brings up his forces, now much improved in
number, to the army before Dublin whereupon His Excy. leaving a part of his army
at Castleknock under the Command of my Lord Dillon of Costelo (a person of much
gallantry) to keep them in on that side the water, removes his Camp to the
other side the town, to distress the enemy that way also, which, whilst they
are endeavoring to do, (upon intelligence that Cromwell was ready with an army
to embarke himself for Ireland, and that he intended to land in Mounster) my
Lord of Inchiquin thought it fit that he should with a good party of horse go
down into those parts to secure his garrisons and provide for the worst.

His Lordship was no sooner gone, but my Lord Leiut. designing to shut up the
enemy within his works, and quite impede as well their getting in of hay, as
the graseing of their cattle without their line; gave order to Patrick Purcell,
Major General of the foot, to march with a sufficient party of men, and an
Engineer to Baggot-Rath there to possess himself of that place immediately,
and cast up such a work as had been already designed: Sr. William Vaughan
Commissary General of the horse, had order likewise to draw together most part
of the troops that were on that side the water and to keep them in a body
upon a large plowed field looking toward the Castle of Dublin, there to
countenance the foot whilst the works were finishing, and to secure them in
case the enemy out of the town should attempt to interrupt them. These (my
Lord) were the orders given, but not executed, for notwithstanding it did not
much exceed a mile, whither the foot were to go, yet through the ignorance, or
negligence of the Officers, that were to conduct them many hours were spent,
ere they came at the place: Whither when they were come they found the work so
wretchlesly advanced by Mr. Welsh the Engineer, (and to help all) themselves
kept such negligent guards, that many judged it was done on purpose; and that
these neglects proceeded from those lurking seeds of discord between the Kings
and the Nuntios parties: for it is certain that about that time upon an
apprehension that things went on too prosperously with my Lord Leiut. there
were Letters written to Owen O Neale, about broaching a new war, in case
Dublin had bin taken; what ever the grounds of these faileings were, the enemy
never stood to examine, but being much troubled to see a fort designing there,
(where, with so much ease they might not only be kept, from all forage, and
succor by land, but intercourse with the sea also:) and perceiving the posture
they were in, destitute of horse, to guard them, resolves upon a desperate sally
to disturb this work, which they happened to make about eight of the clock in
the morning, when His Excy. who had bin on horseback most part of the night (as
his constant custom was since his coming near Dublin) was newly laid him
down in his tent to take his rest.

The enemy found the new fortification so slight, and the resistance there so
weak, that they soon became masters of the place, from whence seeing the Irish
fly in such fright and disorder, (contrary to their first intentions,) they
pursued them up to the avenewes of their Camp, where finding the soldiers
also that were in guard with great security, and unconcernment looking on, they
laid hold on the advantage, charging briskly in, and in a trice beat them of
their posts, which if they had defended (as a far less number then they were,
might very easily have don) the Camp being no way accessible toward the
town, (excepting by those few avenewes which there purposely had been left
open, nay some of them thrown open contrary to orders for the convenience of
the soldiers) could possibly have run no hazard.

But these passes being thus lost, and abandoned, and more men coming out of
the town to reinforce those that were already so succesfull, the whole army in
the greatest terror, and confusion that might be, falls a running every one a
several way, and in this condition were all things brought before my Lord
Taaffe then General of the Ordinance had awaked my Lord Leiut., who presently
taking horse together with my Lord of Castle-haven (who was now returned back
to his command) and Coll. Milo Power; made toward the enemy taking all such a
long with them as they could either by force, or fair means persuade to face
about, with intention to beat them back, or at least, by making head a while,
to stop their progress till some considerable part of the army could be
rallied, and brought up again, to oppose them: but by that time they came
near the enemy, their followers were grown so thin, that His Excy. (after the
having exposed himself to much danger, and received a shot upon his arms in a
brusk charge that he made upon the foremost of the enemies troops,) was feign
to retire at last, and seek to recover his army that was gone before; Sr.
William Vaughan being already killed, his brother Coll. Richard Butler taken,
and the whole camp in effect abandoned except by those that could not get them
ready, or wanted means of flyinge.

Thus besides the slaughter that was made, and the prisoners that were taken,
one of which was the lot of most of the English that were under the command of
Coll. Woogan (whose behavior that day deserves much commendation) who having
gotten together into a small body defended themselves so gallantly and with so
much resolution against the whole power of the enemy, as at last, after a great
slaughter, the rest made conditions for themfelves before they could be
enforced to yield, or lay down arms:) the total plunder of the camp, with
all the artillery, tents, and baggage fell into the enemies hands, most of my
Lord of Inchiquins foot, that at first made some resistance, seeing the day
lost, upon this disaster changed sides, and revolted to the enemy. All this was
don in so short a space, and with so little noise, that my Lord Dillon, and the
rest of the forces that were on the other side the river of the Liffy, knew
nothing of what was don till the business was over, and some scattering
runawaies brought him word of it; the Irish that got of, made such have every
one toward his home, and with such distraction, that it was impossible for my
Lord Leiut. to draw any body of them together; and therefore (having met with
the news of the surrender of Ballisannon that very day into the hands of his
forces that lay before it) he rested at Caterlo that night, and went the next
day to confer with the Commissioners of trust, and my Lord Inchiquin at Kilkeny.

When this great disaster is well considered, scarce any other sound reason can
be given for so sad a misfortune, but the good pleasure of Almighty God. who
(if it be lawful to look so far into the judgments of heaven,) knowing the ill
intentions and designs that were in the hearts of many both of the Irish and
English there, in case Dublin had bin taken, saw them unworthy of that
blessing, and took that time, for their punishment, and humiliation; not only
in this but a torrent of other crosses following in the neck one of another;
for besides this mischance before Dublin, to the ruin of so great an army,
about the same time O Neale releives Coot in London Derry, to the immediate
loss of that Province, and the future scourge of his own followers; not long
before likewise the plague was brought by a ship out of Spain into Gallway,
and besides the havoc it made in that town, so dispersed it self over all the
Province of Conaught, that my Lord Marquess of Clanricard; being deprived
thorough the Calamities that were upon that town, and country both of money,
and means, to march withal, could not for many months draw his army together,
either to act any thing alone, or join with any other, for fear least by that
means the plague, that made such spoil while they were asunder, should mow
them down when they were all together.

This Route at Dublin, the releife of Derry, and the plague might be thought
competent afflictions to be cast upon a people so impoverished, and a Kingdom
so wasted before; yet this suffices not, there are heavier losses yet to
follow, and a worse pestilence to land shortly at Dublin, that will sweep away
their men, and towns together; but here your Lordship may justly interrupt me,
and say, that though it must be confessed, that whatsoever befalls us in this
vale of misery is to be attributed to the hand of heaven, or the permission at
least of the devine providence, (into the reasons of whose secret, and hidden
counsels, our weak capacities are unable to search) yet nevertheless those
visible causes, whereby we draw misfortunes upon our selves, by such, who
through neglect of their duty, and disobedience to their superiors, are
apparently the authors thereof, ought not to pass unpunished, and therefore you
see no reason why those were not called to an account that deserved it both by
their cowardice, and so shamfull omission of their duty, as could admit of no
excuse.

But when your Lordship shall be pleased to reflect upon what I said before,
that my Ld. Leiut. comands this army, and indeed the Kingdom but as it were
upon courtesy, all his authority in effect consisting in the aweing one faction
with another, the best of which he found to be on so uncertain, and unsettled,
terms; that you will I doubt not when you reflect upon it easily grant, that
my Ld. Leiut. could not in prudence do an act that was likely to give so great,
and general a distaste as indeed to have proceeded against the Major General
would have bin to the confederats, amongst whom he had so many alliances, and
friends: and the running away of the rest was so universal a fault, that it
was hard to discover who deserved punishment most; and harder to find a Court
of war to censure them.

Dureing this short residence at Kilkeny, His Ex.cy: having taken order with
the Lord Inchiquin to bring up what forces he could possibly make, and with the
Commissioners for the recruteing, drawing together, and arming, their dispersed
forces as soon as could be, to the end they might be sent after him, who speeds
away himself in the company only of 20 or 30 horse toward Trim, and Drogheda,
as the places both nearest the enemies attempts, and likeliest to totter back,
if not secured in time: at Tecroghan (a house of Sr. Luke Fitzgarretts) he
makes a stay, till those several bodies that he then expected were com up, and
upon notice of their coming removes to Trim; where he meets with news of Jones
his being before Drogheda, who soon after, upon intelligence that my Lord
Leiut. was at Trim, and suposeing his forces, to be greater then indeed they
were, drew of in the night, and returned Imediatly to Dublin.

The next day His Excy. went through to Drogheda, where a party of the Scotch
horse, and foot under the Command of the Lord of Ards, and the Lord
Clanbrazill. Came up unto him, but, whilst they are consulting what to do, they
receive assurance of Cromwells landing with very considerable forces: Whereupon
concludeing that town necessary to be kept to entertain the enemy before
whilst they made up their army, as they hoped to do very considerably, and
soon enough to come to the releife of the place; of which if they should
fail, no question was made, but after the gaining of time, which was then
precious, they in the town should be able to make honorable conditions for
themselves; whilst Cromwell is refreshing his own men in Dublin and reducing
Jones's, there is put into Drogheda a garrison of 2500 foot, and 300 horse,
which was thought sufficient: and so having furnished it with provisions, as
well as that short time would give them leave, His Excy. commits the charge of
that place to Sr. Arthur Aston, as a person whose experience, courage, and
approved fidelity did worthily deserve the highest trust. These things thus
ordered His Excy. returns to Trim, and from thence he dispatched away Coll.
Daniell O Neale then Governor of that place, (with a Commission to set on foot
the treaty again with Owen O Neale, if it were possible, and to endeavor the
reduceing of the Vlster army even upon any conditions;) a person esteemed by
all, best qualified for that employment, as well in regard of his singular
abillitye, and approved fidelity to the King as the great interest he was
supposed to have in his Uncle, who managed the business with that dexteritye,
as he won his Uncle to harken again, unto an agreement; whereupon. Sr. Richard
Barnewell, and Sr. Nicholas Plunkett are sent after to make an absolute
conclusion with him, though by the way this may not be unworthy of observation,
that those persons who were formerly most opposite to this agreement, were now
become the greatest sticklers to promote it with His Excy, being grown
sencible of the imminent, and aproaching danger that now threatened them.

Tecroghan is the next stage His Excy. removes unto, (where I had the honor
first to kiss his hand after my arrival in Ireland,) here he makes a stand,
as being the most opportune place to draw his army together in, and lyeing most
convenient after that was don, to relieve Drogheda, or make any other attempt
upon the enemy: Where besides the remains of the Irish army, already some what
recruited, there joined unto him a good regiment of my Lord Marquess of
Clanricards of above 1000 foot, together with 300 horse; likewise that party
of the Scots before mentioned; Sr. Thomas Armstrong, and Coll. Treuors,
together with what forces my Lord Inchiquin could bring out of his precincts;
these being got together, and daily additions being still expected to the
making them up a more considerable body, then they were at Dublin; my Lord
Leiut. received several advices from Sr. Arthur Aston to precipitate nothing:
for he doubted not of finding Cromwell play a while, as certainly he had done
had not Coll. Walls regiment after the enemy had bin twice bravely repulsed;
upon the unfortunat loss of their Collonell in the third assault bin so
unhappily dismaide, as to listen before they had need unto the enemy offering
them quarter; and admitted them in upon these terms; thereby betraying both
themselves, and all their fellow soldiers to the slaughter; for Cromwell being
master of the town, and told by Jones that he had now in his hands the flower
of the Irish army, gave order to have all that were in arms put to the sword:
Where besides the gallant Governor Sr. Arthur Aston, Sr. Edmond Varney, Coll.
Warren, Coll. Fleminge, and Coll. Birn, Leiut. Coll. Finglasse, and Major
Tempest, together with many other excellent Officers, and Gentlemen, there were
butchered near 3000 soldiers, and those truly reputed the best that Kingdom
affoorded: in whose fall, there is sadly observable, how great a number of them
were guilty of the unlucky breach of that solemn agreement, made about two
years before between the Lord Marquess of Clanricard and the Leinster army
at Sr. Nicholas Whites Castle of Lexleap; several of those that survived
having perished since; and few, or none of them escaped some remarkable
affliction, or other. This massacre at Drogheda having lopt of a principal
limb of my Lord Leiuts. army; and the loss of that town, letting the enemy
loose, caused his Excy to remove his army from Castle Jordan down toward the
Counties of Wexford, and Kilkeny, there not only to lie secure, till General O
Neales army came up unto them (with whom now at last he having bin rejected by
the Parliament, and the Commissioners whipped to reason with adversity, there was
an agreement made, and he submitted to the Kings Authority) but also ready to
be drawn into either Wexford, or Kilkeny, as there should be occasion, for
upon one of those places after the enemies retreat from Drogheda to Dublin, it
was concluded they would fall next. For which reason His Excy. for many days
courts the town of Wexford to take in a Garrison, Kilkeny having received one
already, but they (affirming they were able to defend their town themselves)
would never be brought to admit of one till the enemy was at the Walls, and
then tumultuarily Sr. Edmond Butler with near 1500 men was received in, as
Governor; whom to reinforce, after the enemy was now set down before it my
Lord Leiunt comes with new supplies with in sight of the town, and had put
them in, to the infallible preservation of the place, if James Stafford then
Governor of the Castle had not upon terms of advantage to himself before His
Excies eyes shamefully betrayed it, and the town into the hands of a most
cruel, and faithless enemy, who butchered there also after they were admitted
in, above 2000 more.

There was nothing now remainning to be done, the Vlster army being not yet
come up, and several troops of my Lord Inchiquins being since the seidge of
Drogheda run away to the enemy) but put a Garrison into Rosse which was sent in
under the Command of Luke Taaffe with orders (for the place was judged scarce
tenable against so powerful an enemy) to make conditions when they saw
themselves able to resist no longer, as at last they did when the breach was
made, and the enemy ready to give an assault, having terms to march away with
their arms.

About Graigge and Thomas Town His Excellency houered with his horse, and the
small remainder of his foot, until the comeing up of the Vlster army. Under
the Command of Leiutenant General Farrell, (the General himself lying then a
dying:) This new Conjunction with Owen O Neale, and so great an accession of
Forces bringes my Lord Leiutenant into a Condition not only of putting a stop
upon Cromwells hasty progress, but even of gaining ground upon him, as
questionless he would have done, had not another misfortune greater then any
of the former interveened to frustrate all; which was this, my Lord of
Inchequin having as I said before conditioned to have the ordering of those
Garrisons, and forces that he brought in with him to the Kings obedience left
wholly to himself out of desire (as is believed) to keep himself still
considerable upon a bottom of his own; would never hearken unto any
Proposition of admitting a proportion of Irish into any of his towns, Kingsale
only excepted into which place at the importunity of Prince Rupert he at last
admitted some: Being confident that the English forces under his command having
served under him so so long upon several scores; all, or the most of the
Officers where of being either Creatures of his own, or men obliged, and
indeared unto him upon a long account, would never separate themselves from his
fortune, or abandon his service. But his Lordship it seems took wrong
measures, for the most part of them being steared wholly by self interest, and
knowing the way already, how for advantage to serve against the King (whose
business they saw so much declining, that no more was likely to be got that
way) whilst Cromwell was full of money, and success; Conspired together how to
possess themselves of my Lord of Inchiquins person, together with the towns
under his Command, that they might make a surrender of all at once unto the
enemy: Youghall begins the dance, and taking occasion to mutiny against the
English Cavaliers under Woogans Command that were quartered there, imprisoned,
and disarmd them all, and afterward stood upon their guard.

Whilst my Lord of Iuchiquin is by all Gentle means endeavoring to reclayme
back this town, several of his Officers combine to seize upon him, (then
lying secure at Leiutenant General Barries house of Castle Lions) but they,
and their design being discovered to his Lordship by one of their own
accomplices, were so far prevented as to be seized all upon themselves. Whereupon
the town of Youghall seeing Cromwell yet at too great a distance, and the time
of his coming into Mounster uncertain, offered to submit upon assurance of
indemnity, the release of the imprisoned Officers, and removal of the
Cavaliers; which his Lordship either wanting the means to compel them, or
being willing with kindness, and fair means to vvin upon them, and keep them
in order assented unto. After which, having visited his Garrisons, and
believing all things so secure, as not to require either his further stay
there, or the bringing any proportion of the Irish into those other towns, he
returns unto his charge in the army. And now Cromwell having newly received
an affront before Duncannon, through the courage and gallantry of Wogan vvirh
those English Gentlemen, that were put in with him upon that occasion, was
retired back to Rosse there under the Protection of the town to make a Floting
Bridge over the river to the end that by having a passage to the other side, he
might at his pleasure either compel His Excy to devide his army, to attend
upon his motions and so give him an opportunity of setting upon one part, or
other of it; Or, at least, if it kept together, of getting a Passage into
Mounster, where he expected, to find a general Revolt of those Garrisons under
my Lord of Inchiquins Commands, as it afterward happened.

My Lord Taaffe was sent with a part of the army to hinder the work; But what
through want of powder, (and indeed all sorts of ammunition) which was now
grown exceeding scarce, extremity of foul weather, distempers amongst his men,
and other ill concurring accidents, he was not able to effect it. My Lord
Leiutenant through Cromwells sudden retreating in the night, from before Dun
Cannon, having lost the opportunity of fighting him, (as he was then resolved
finding his army cherfully desire the occasion) had nothing left him now to do,
but wait upon the enemies motion, and endeavor to cut of his provisions,
(which the country people allured by the orderlinesse of his soldiers, who
had money to pay for what they took, and command it seems to do so) brought
them in as fast as could be; whilst His Excellency having no money to pay his
army, nor indeed a competence of bread to give them, was constrained to let
them take their sustenance where they could find it.

During this intermission of action, Cork, Youghall, and all the English
towns of Mounster (even through the incitation of those Officers, that were
but lately released) being openly revolted, and the Lord Broghall with some men
landed in those parts; Very many of my Lord Inchiquins party, both horse, and
foot deserted my Lord Leiutenant, and ran daily over to the enemy: In so much
that both the Commanders, and soldiers of the Irish (not without reason) grew
very jealous of the rest that remained behind, fearing that if ever they came
to engage against the enemy, they would turn upon them, and betray them, there
wanted not diverse also (though doubtless very unjustly) that extended their
jealousies unto my Lord of Inchiquin himself grounding their accusations upon
his Lordships not punishing the Conspirators when he had them in his power,
upon so fair a warning, and just an occasion, as then was given him, his not
putting Irish into his Garrisons; Upon his wife, his family, plate, and goods
being sent him safely out of Cork into the Irish quartars, upon his not
consenting to the dismounting, and disarming, of the rest of his men, when some
of the Commissioners pressed the doing of it, upon his delivering his advice in
Council (as they heard for his Excellencies coming to conditions with
Cromwell, and making this an argument for it, that his men would fight no
longer; and lastly upon an impertinent accusation without head, or tail
(appeared when he came to be examined in the business) brought against him by
the Marquis of Antrim, for holding correspondence, and having made conditions
under hand with the enemy.

Upon these foundations, and such as these, did many of the Irish represent
unto my Lord Leiutenant the necessity of discharging my Lord Inchiquin of his
Command, and securing his person; which his Excellency being more tender of the
Kings honor, and his own, then upon bare surmises, and suspicions to deal in
that manner with a person that had but lately deserved so well both of the
King, and him; would not be brought unto: Choosing rather to run any adventure,
then to be guilty of breach of conditions with him, which he must needs have
been, if before a conviction of apparent treachery he should upon the score of
my Lord of Inchiquins oversights, or the uncertain jealousies of the Irish;
have condescended unto either of the things proposed.

This temper and justice in my Lord Leiutenant (in not suffering himself to be
led by the clamors and importunity of the people, and soldiers) involues him
also at last under their displeasure, and mistrust: so that out of want of
confidence in their chief Commanders, and out of diffidence in one another,
the army was now falln into a very unfit condition of hazarding a battle with
the enemy, if an occasion should offer it self: and to make it worse the Scots
that were there (being tired out with the necessities, the whole army suffered,
and receiving news of the enemies prevalence in their Country) desired leave
to return into the North which after great importunity at last being granted
them, they immediately with drew their forces, and hasted homewards; where they
were no sooner come, and Sr. George Monro joynd unto them, but they received so
sore a blow from Coote with so much loss, and dispersion of their men that
they were never able to make head in Vlster since.

Cromwell now finding the army so much weakened, by the desertion of so many of
my Lord Inchiquins men, and the departure of the Scots, and likewise knowing
that it was in such disorder through the distrust, and animosities that were
amongst them, so that in reason he was like to have much the advantage if they
should fight him, adventures over his bridge at Rosse into the County of
Kilkenny; where by facing my Lord Leiutenants army, and moving after it up, and
down, he amuzed the Irish; whilst Jones, his Leintenant General, with parties
took in the Castles of the Country, and had Carrick given into his hands
wretchedly by Martin that Commanded there; Upon notice where of Cromwell
hastens thither, to pass his army over into Mounster, which was now his
business; for notwithstanding his purse to buy provisions of the Country, and
his ships that wherever he went waited continually upon him, his army through
the unseasonablenesse of the weather, and want of quarters, was so much
harassed, and wasted; many of his men falling sick, and dying daily, that if he
did not hasten to his Winter quarters, he would in probability have perished
without a blow, which nevertheless, to make sure work, my Lord Leiutenant
(whose army also was quite tired out with wants, sufferings, and continual
marches) hearing that he was gone toward Carrick intended to bestow upon him
before necessity forced him to disperse his men, and to that end his Excellency
marched speedily after the enemy with design to set upon him whilst he was
either engaged before Carrick, or else encumbered at some other pass upon the
river; but after all this diligence when my Lord came near the town he then
learnt that the place was lost before, and that Cromwell leaving a competent
Garrison therein, had only past his army over, and was gone toward Waterford,
which town during Cromwells Residence at Rosse, though the persuasion (as it is
said) of Geoffry Baron, and Hugh Rochford had underhand begun a treaty with
him, for the delivery of the town unto him; Which treaty only stuck upon the
free exercise of their Religion, and the Churches denied unto them by Cromwell.

The knowledge of this caused my Lord Leiutenant now to hasten thither, with no
small danger to his person to press them to admit of a Garrison, which being a
long time denied, and my Lord of Castlehaven, with diverse others, that his
Excellency propounded, being utterly rejected by them; yet at last they were
content to admit of Farrell, and the Vlster men, who accordingly were sent
immediately unto them. After Farrells admittance, he upon notice of the enemies
motion that way, fearing some commotion in the town, and thinking himself not
strong enough to resist the enemy without, and master them within writes unto
his Excellency for a supply of men; And these his Excellency (seeing Cromwell so
unexpectedly got over into Mounster through the treachery of the Garrison of
Carrick) intends now to conduct himself out of hand into Waterford, before
which the enemy was supposed to be; Thereupon some Principal Officers of the
army desired leave that they might in the Interim attempt the regaining of
Carrick, against whom his Excellency objecting the want of materials necessary
for such an enterprise, was assured they had enough to serve their turn for
that work, yea, and some of them positively undertook the taking of the place
that night; Wherefore leaving them to their business my Lord bends his Course
for Waterford, where he arrived when it was late; upon notice where of Cromwell
despairing of doing any good upon that town, and finding many of his men fall
sick, and die of the flux, which then raged amongst them, draws of in the
night, and hastens toward his Winter quarters at Cork and Youghall, in which
march as he gaind Dungarvan, so he lost Jones his Leiutenant General.

During my Lord Leiutenants absence, the army at Carrick assaults the place,
the foot falling on with extraordinary galantry, and resolution, where after
the loss of many of them, they faild of carrying the place only for want of a
few pickaxes, and spades which being called for were no where to be found, which
necessitated the poor foot, after having done so handsomely, and stood under
the walls some hours, to quit the business, and draw of; when extreme want of
food (they having eaten nothing almost for two days) enforced them to march
away toward Clonmell, all the Country betvixt Carrick, and Kilkenny Being
totally spoild already.

The remouall of the army hence without sending notice of it to my Lord
Leiutenant had like to have put his Excellency into the enemies hands, for he
making full account of the regaining of Carrick upon the former assurance that
was given him, was upon his way directly thither, (where the enemy had 300
horse, and he not forty in his Company) when Colonel Milo Power by good
fortune found him out, and told him of the ill success of the enterprise, and
the motion of the army thence, whereupon he altered his Course another way. And
then considering that the enemy was now retired into his Garrisons, that the
weather was bitter, and unfit for action, the Winter being now come on, or if
it were not so that he had neither meat, nor money wherewith to keep his men any
longer together, having since the revolt of Mounster (which deprived him of the
greatest share of his Contributions, and Provisions) been along time already
forced to live upon the spoil of the rest of the Country; he concluded upon
dispersing his army into quarters also, which (because the Principal towns
refused to admit them in) he was fain to scatter over all the Kingdom. The
greatest part of the Vlster forces were sent into their own Province there to
Choose a new General according as their conditions allowed them. Luke Taaffe,
and Morogh, O Flahartye with their men were sent back into Connaght to my Lord
of Clanricard; my Lord of Inchiquin with the remainder of such as belonged unto
him, went over into the County of Clare; my Lord Dillon with his, into Mead,
and toward Athlone, all the rest were scattered several ways; Only Major
General Hugh O Neale was admitted with about 1500 Vlster men into Clonmell as
Governor, and Kilkenny received also a Competent Garrison to secure them
against so ill neighbors as Rosse, and Carrick were.

Here your Lordship beholds a summary of what past in the field, since the army
first set forth until their going to their Winter quarters; in all which time
how ill soever the success has been, nothing can with any color of reason be
laid to my Lord Leiutenants charge, except the not punishing those many
failings, treacheries, and disorders that were committed during this Summers
expedition: Yet as to the disobedience, and neglects in the seidge of Dublin I
gave you reasons why that was past over before; And those that were committed
since were for the most part by men of that condition, and Interest, that it
was neither safe, nor fit (all things considered) to call them to an account;
as for treacheries, most of the authors of them took care to secure themselves
and in time get out of reach; Only Crosby that betrayed Kingsale, after he was
designed to die, by my Lord Leiutenant, upon my Lord of Inchiquins coming to
town, was, I know not for what considerations, repreived and saved; The want
of money to pay the soldiers, and the exigences they were for the most part in,
after the mischance at Dublin, did so much authorize their disorders in the
Country that if they had not been past by, and connived at, there had been no
means of keeping them together. There was no Officer in all that army, that
will not likewise confess that my Lord of Ormond did too often, and too freely
expose himself to danger by going upon every little expedition; and that he did
take more toil, and pains then became a General, by descending frequently to
play the Major General, the Quartermaster, the Provost Marshall, or any
thing; which yet the unremediable negligence, and insufficiency of many of his
Officers obliged him unto.

Out of all which it is very evident that it was neither want of conduct,
courage, or vigilance in him that brought those sad successes upon the Irish,
but (next after the immediate hand of God) those factions, that he had neither
power, nor means of mastering, those treacheries, which no man's Prudence could
prevent, and those wants, that his empty purse and deep engaged fortune could
not supply. For I dare boldy say, that had it not been for the aversion of the
Commissioners, my Lord of Castlehaven, my Lord of Inchiquin, and the Scots, to
Owen O Neale, he had been reduced in time; Both Derry, and Dublin would have
fallen into my Lord Leiuteuants hands, and no landing place have been left for
Cromwell unsecured: Nay, I have many reasons to believe, that notwithstanding
the defeat at Dublin, and success upon Drogheda, Cromwell with all his great
army, his fleet, and store of money, had been lost, and sunk to nothing, if the
Castles of Wexford, and Carrick had not been so fowly betrayed; Nay, and after
that too, if those towns, and forces in Mounster had not so treacherously
revolted.

But how innocent soever his Excellency were, by this time, some leaders of the
factious part of the Clergy, and people (thinking now they had got a fair
occasion of lifting him out of the saddle, and thereby of slipping their own
necks out of the collar of obedience again,) begin to exclaim aloud against my
Lord Leiutenant for their ill successes; they blame his conduct of the army, as
if he had misguided it on purpose; his disposing of their contributions, as if
he had defrauded them; his Kindness, and Countenance to the English Gentlemen,
was a sign he wished our Nation, better then his own; and an inference of his
not being fit to be trusted longer by them; for to confirm which they coined a
thousand arguments, and scattered industriously amongst the people opinions,
that my Lord of Ormond was guilty of the greatest treacheries, and miscarriages
that had been committed. To make which probable, they called to mind afresh the
surrender of Dublin to the Parliament, rather then to them, They instanced also
his present supporting my Lord of Inchiquin, though suspected so deeply by
every one; Nay, out of his standing so hard with them in all past treaties upon
concessions of Religion, and out of his steadiness in his own Profession, they
framed arguments of his unfaithfullness to them, and aversion to theirs: So
that now you could speak with few amongst the common soldiers, or the
peasants that would not either say, they could not look to prosper under the
Command of a Protestant, or else tell you, that it was no wonder their armies
were beaten, and their towns were lost, since their chief leaders betrayed
them.

Thus did the knavery, and malice of a few steal away the hearts of the
generallity of that undiscerning simple people from my Lord Leiutenant, few of
them being able to judge at all of the Prudence and integrity of his conduct;
or to consider that the army that was in the field the foregoing Summer would
have required four times the Contribution that was raised, without leaving any
surplus either to be hoarded up, or sent beyond seas: From which his Excellency
was so far, that on the other side, he frequently offered to engage at a very
low rate all that remained unmorgaged of his Princely estate for the support of
the army.

These people could not reflect how much right, and honor he did their Nation
in his Civillities, and Nobleness to those English Gentlemen, that were in
want, and Bannishment only for their faith unto the King, and who, if ever the
Royal Interest recovered, were many of them like to become so capeable of
acknowledging those favors with advantages back unto them; wherefore his
Excellency, as well out of their common concernments, as his own goodness,
bewailed nothing more, then that his own private, and the Kingdoms public
necessities limited his bounty; and that the ill nature, and indiscretion that
reigned amongst many of the Irish would not suffer them to hide their
repininges, at his favor toward these Gentlemen.

The surrender of Dublin truly had been made unto the people of Ireland by the
arts of those, that were at that time in Government amongst them, a most odious
thing; though those very persons knew well enough, it was themselves and not my
Lord Leiutenant, that was in the fault; by twice fowly violating their public
faith with him, first in breaking a peace made, and solemnly published both at
Dublin, and Kilkenny, (the respective seats of the Kings Leiutenant and the
Council of the Confederates) and in seconding that act (after having
imprisoned the Lord Muskerij, Sr. Robert Talbott, Sr. Lucas Dillon, Mr. Brown,
Mr. Belings, and the rest of their Supreme Council, that had made the peace,
and still stood honestly to what they had done) with bringing their armies
before Dublin, where having caused the burning, and destruction of those
quarters, the town it self must have been lost unto them, if upon overtures of
a treaty with the Parliament they had not sent men and supplies to rescue it.
And next in the breach of that solemn engagement made between them, and the
Marquess of Clanricard, as soon as (upon belief of their resolution to return
unto their duty) the treaty was broke of, and the forces of the Parliament sent
home again; Could it be expected, that after two such acts as these any wise
man would trust, or treat with the Irish any more, whilst the Government was
still in the same men's hands; Who after all this wrought the whole Assembly to
declare they would never have any Protestant Governor more, and namely not my
Lord Leiutenant; and who were not ashamed at the same time, both to anull the
Peace, and yet acknowledge that the forementiond Gentlemen that had been makers
of it, and suffered in justification of it, had neither exceeded their
instructions, nor done any thing misbecoming honest men.

These kind of proceedings at Kilkenny joynd to a new expedition designed
against Dublin, as soon as the season of the year would suffer them to march,
were, it must needs be Confessed Provocations sufficient to have justified my
Lord Leiutenant (if he had received no such instructions from the King as he
did) finding himself unable to keep the place any longer, in the surrender of
it: (rather then to so faithless a people, as those were, that then swaied
there, and who were driving on a foreign Interests with might and main) into
the hands of the Parliament (who were at that time in treaty with the King)
upon conditions of giving him free access to His MAjESTY, and of repaying unto
him those moneys, which he during the troubles of his Government (the Kings
Exchequer failing) had out of his own purse lent unto the army. Whether His
Excellency did in this case like a man of honor, and as became him, let the
late General O Neale be judge, who (if he be not much wronged) did affirm unto
a confident friend of his, that if he had been entrusted from the English
Nation, and with the Interests of the Crown of England there, as my Lord
Leiutenant was, he would have done just so, as His Excellency then did.

His supporting my Lord Inchiquin then sinking in the General opinion, if it
had been duly waighd, should have been an argument of much comfort, and
satisfaction to this jealous people to see his Excellency so tender of the
Kings honor, and his own word; so just in his freindships, and so exactly
careful to observe conditions; Out of his wariness in all his treaties with
them, they might also have pleased to infer (rather, then what they did) these
two things; first that like a faithful servant, he endeavored to make as good
a bargain as he could for the King his master; and secondly that without
designs of cheating them into their duty (like those, that some others had) he
was resolud to assent unto nothing, but what His MAjESTY, and he might justly
own, and safely make good unto them: Finally his steadiness in a religion,
that from very tender years he had been imbued with, and his firmness in his
loialty, in having stood for many years all those batteries, that either with
arguments or incredible offers of advantage, they had often made to win him to
their party; in so much, that they might see that nothing but the hand of God
and the convinceing of his judgment could alter him in the first, nor any
thing in the world corrupt, or shake him in the latter, might at least have
been an assurance to them, that he would never become a Proselite to a Religion
far less rational, and alluring, then theirs was (I mean Independancy) and
that having refused to become their Prince, he would not betray so eminent a
loyalty, his Country, his friends, and so noble a fortune as his is, only to
become a Vassal unto Cromwell; from whom he could not possibly promise to
himself (if a security for the performance, or permanence of it could be given
him) any thing of honor, or advantage equal to what he did already enjoy, and
might hereafter justly promise to himself from the King.

Thus went those kind of Spiders about making poison out of every thing, where
with having now either allienated, or infected far the greater part of the
Kingdom, by abusing them at home, they have attempted also to do the same
abroad, and most particularly at Court, by their letters, and sneaking
emissaries such as Hugh Rochford and Fitzmorris, who, under pretense of great
devotion to the King, by impudent corner suggestions, and malicious whispers,
have laid all the foregoing accusations to His Excellencyes Charge, and
endeavored so to blast him there, that his MAjESTY might have been enduced to
remove him from the Government, which on my soul if he had done, or should do,
whilst these distractions continue, it were the ready way to ruin all his
Interests in that Kingdom; for my Lord of Clanricard wauing it, as (especially
upon that score, and such a conjuncture) without doubt he would have done,
Irland afforded not another person, who for all respects was able, and fit for
that trust; and no stranger could have been sent, whose want of knowledge in
that Nation, and want of interest amongst them, should not have laid him open
to so great disadvantages, as he should have done nothing else but loose
himself, and the Kings business. Which is the Real end, which these base
informers, and their abettors drive at, and the lurch they ly at for the
broaching of a new Rebellion; the impossibility of setting which on foot,
whilst so wise, and experienced a person, and one of so great an alliance, and
interest in the Kingdom is at the helm: and their utter despair of ever being
able to bring my Lord of Ormond to their bent, are the only true reasons of all
their persecutions of, and aversions to him.

Whom, as I remember, (before this long, yet necessary digression) I left at
Kilkenny, where having in vain endeavored to qualify the universal
discontents, and observing how fast (notwithstanding the admonitory Declaration
of all the Bishops from Clonmaenosse to the contrary) the people being
alienated with the rauaging, and disorder of their own armies, and allured with
the successes, and smooth invitations of Cromwell, ran headlong into him for
Protection, and under Contribution; as also, how great numbers of the Irish
soldiers, some frighted with the plague, which now began to spread into the
other Provinces of the Kingdom, and others for want of livelihood, as having
neither meat, nor pay, flockt in unto the enemy. He goes into Conaght to confer
about carrying on of the public business, and the remedy of these disorders
with the Marquis of Clanricarde at his Castle of Portumna about the end of
Christmas; who being a person of that eminent merit toward our King, and
Nation, and deserving so much honor from all honest men; I shall, I believe,
do a thing very pleasing to your Lordship to give you a breife Character of him.

The Story of his Charity, and Protection to such multitudes of distresst
English, and Protestants in the time of those Tragical Massacres, and Rapines,
that at the beginning of the war were acted in Irland; and his Civillities,
and Nobleness to those of our Nation, whose honesty deserved his favor ever
since has so many Liveing Relators, that I need not meddle with it; likewise
for me to give a particular account with what integrity, and wisdom he has
preservd his Loyalty, through all those straits, and troubles that have hedgd
him in, free from the guilt of the least compliance with either the Parliament,
or Confederates, though menaced, and courted incredibly by all, not only the
Nuntio and O Neale, but even by Sultan Cromwell himself (as looking upon his
Lordship for the person likeliest now to give him the greatest opposition, and
to contribute most to the preservation of what was left) all which assaults he
has stood out with the greatest constancy, and modesty in the world, would
make me too tedious upon this occasion.

Wherefore I shall content my self to tell your Lordship in short, that he has
conducted his own, and that share he has had of the Kings business, with the
greatest prudence, and honesty the freest from faction, or ambition, and with
the clearest neglect of self interest, and private advantages, that has ever
yet falln under my observation; in fine I will assure you, he is a subject as
well worthy of a Princes favor, and as fit for his Counsels, that he is as
real, and hearty in his freindships, and has a soul as full of justice, and
honor as is any where to be found.

Upon his coming to Portumna, my Lord Leiutenant meets with Sr. George Monro,
who was posted thither out of the north to make some Proposalls in order to the
reduction of Vlster to His Excellency and my Lord of Clanricard, (who had the
Summer before assisted him toward his Vlster expedition with a Regiment of
foot 100 horse, and 1000 pounds in money out of the Province of Conaght;) and in
case those overtures of his were not approved of, to demand his pass, that he
might leave the Kingdom; But what he propounded, was so plausible, that in
case money, and arms could be had in time, and in proportion to what he
demanded, (as the infection of Galloway out of which town chiefly both were to
be had, made it very difficult) they judged it a very likely expedition;
Whereupon my Lord of Clanricard, desirous to keep so able a commander as Sr.
George in the Kingdom, furnishes him with what money he could at the present,
and sends him Northward to lay, and prepare the business before; promising to
do his uttermost endeavors to procure him those supplies of money, ammunition,
and arms by the time appointed; as also to bring his army up as far as Sligo,
there to countenance Sr. George in his undertakings, and be ready for any fair
occasion, that should present it self for the mastering of the Country.

After four, or five days stay at the most, His Excellency took his leave,
and hastened toward Kilkenny, obligeing my Lord of Clanricard to come after
him, to be present at a meeting he had appointed there, for the procuring of a
good understanding between the Clergy, the Commissioners, and himself, and for
taking the best order they could for the raising, and maintayning an army
against the next spring: But though they met, nothing at that time could be
done, or agreed upon; Wherefore my Lord of Clanricard returns into Connaght to
take order for his Northren expedition; which out of the great difficulties of
getting his men together, arising out of the universal distractions, that were
then in the Kingdom, the hard season of the year, the Pestilence, the want of
moneys, and provisions; he could not possibly go through with, against February
which was the time designed; Nor even then, when he did, without very great
necessities, and inconveniences to himself, and his army, as I can well
witness, having had the honor to wait upon him most part of that journey.

This failing in Point of time, and a great part of the moneys promised him,
(which nevertheless as things stood no man's Industry could have remedied) Sr.
George Monro complained very much of, affirming that their opportunity was lost
thereby; especially now they being come, the army was able to move no further,
through extreme want of Provisions (kept from them by foul and contrary
weather) for which, and the residue of the money, together with hopes of an
accord between my Lord Leiutenant; and the Commissioners some days were spent
in Expectation, but nothing coming in the end, except only a letter from my
Lord of Ormond summoning my Lord of Clanricard, suddenly away; his Lordship
was forced to leave his army, and the Northren business to the hazard, and
return back to meet my Lord Leiutenant, and the Commissioncrs at Loghreogh:
Whereupon Sr. George Monro beleiving now that my Lord Leiutenant would leave the
Kingdom, seeing the divisions amongst the Irish grow daily greater, and giving
all for lost, and lastly finding the impatience of his own party to treat with
the enemy, (as he had often before publicly declared he would) retires
himself to Eniskillin, and having made Conditions for himself, the remainder
of his Party, and his Officers that were in prison, gave up that place to the
enemy, and departed the Kingdom. Very soon after whose retirement, my Lord of
Clanricards army for extremity of want was forced to return from Sligo back
toward the County of Galway.

Where I will leave it, and come back unto his Excellency, who being left by my
Lord Clanricard lately in Kilkenny, after having caused Captain Tickle to be
executed for a design he had of betraying that town unto Cromwell; was by the
breach growing daily wider between him, and the Kingdom, and through the
increase of the sickness now come thither, at the joint request of the
Commissioners, and Officers, induced to remove toward Lymerick, where being
negligently received without the accustomed respect used to the Kings
Leiutenant, he after a short stay departed thence into the County of Clare.
Immediately thereupon, the enemy having refreshd his men, and increased his
army, with a great accession of old soldiers, that had formerly served under
my Lord Inchiquin and my Lord Leiutenant, takes the field, and falls a
summoning Castles, and bringing the Country under Contribution, wherein he had a
general success, most of the Castles surrendering upon appearance of a party of
horse, except Kiltenan, which gave him some resistance.

His Excellencies army through the forementioned obstinacy, and disobedience of
the towns against receiving Garrisons, was so far dispersed, that there was
no means of drawing them together; Neither, if that were done, of keeping them
in a body, for the Country was destroyed, and wast, so that it could not supply
him; besides during these disagrements between my Lord Leiutenant, the Clergy,
and the Commissioners there were few, or none of the Irish soldiers (if there
had been Provisions for them) that would obey his Excellencies Orders. Of all
which Cromwell was well aware, and therefore went securely, and with confidence
to work, carrying all before him: A among other of his successes, Ballisonan
is sold unto him, and Cahir Castle (then the dwelling house of Master Mathewes
a young youth, and half Brother to my Lord Leiutenant) given him contrary to
those strict orders left by his Excellency with Master Mathewes for the keeping
of it; who was so conscious of his own misdoing in the act, that he refused
upon several summons, and invitations to appear before my Lord, and stayed
still in the enemies quarters to secure himself from His Excellencies
indignation. But nevertheless this act of Mr. Matthewes is made aground of new
suspicions, and fresh clamours against my Lord himself by the Irish, who all
this while run on in their extravagancies, intent only upon their disputes in
hand, as if there were no such man as Cromwell in the Kingdom; in so much, that
seeing so many several meetings assigned, and so much time spent to so little
purpose, His Excellency concludes that those people would never be brought into
order by him, and therefore resolves to withdraw himself from the Government,
if not to depart the Kingdom, and to commit the mannagement of all unto the
Marquis of Clanricard, which was the reason of his Lordships being sent for
back from Sligo.

The enemy in the mean time having the Castles of Gowran, and Laghlin,
together with the Officers commanding in them delivered into his hands by the
common soldiers, sets at last upon Kilkenny; Whence a while before the Earl
of Castle-haven, (who was now left with chief command in Leinster) was drawn
out with his forces, by reason the sickness raged so, leaving Sr. Walter
Butler, and Major Walsh with about 50 horse, and some 400 foot in the place,
where a breach being made, and the enemy assaulting, they were bravely
repulsed, leaving 600 arms behind them; after which check, they resolved, to
march of, and are sending their artillery away silently before, whilst the
townsmen convey a drummer privately over the wall, and upon I know not what
accord, let the enemy in, unknown to the soldiers, who were then forced to
retire to the Castle, and make their terms, which being granted them, they
march away.

Kilkenny being gained by him, let us leave Cromwell at Cashell for a while
amongst his Committee men, and return into Connaght, where the Clergy, and
Commissioners seeing that my Lord of Clanricard having refused to take the
Government upon him was resolved in case, they continued disobedient unto my
Lord Leiutenant (least the Kings Authority should be exposed to further
disobedience and contempt) to leave the Kingdom together with His Excellency,
and considering what a certain ruin their departure would be unto them all;
are now courting my Lord Leiuteuant to stay, and offer to come to composition
with him: who demands assurance from them that the respective towns of
Lymerick, and Gallway shall receive sufficient Guarrisons, and that themselves
with all the soldiers, and people shall hereafter readily obey him; Which they
undertake unto him, upon condition that all the English what soever under his
Excellencies command might be disbanded, and sent away; that the Bishops of the
Kingdom might have a share in Council, and the mannagement of things; that the
Receiver General (which was Sr. George Hamilton Brother in law to my Lord
Leiutenant a person of great parts, honor, and merit) might give in his
accounts; all which his Excellency, out of his great desire to satisfy, and
unite the people thereby to preserve the Country, and the Kings Interest (if it
were possible) at last assents unto.

This agreement being made, the English were accordingly (to free the Irish of
their jealousies, who either were, or would seem to be equally suspicious of
the Cavaliers, as of those, that had served the Parliament before) disbanded,
and since there was no further employment for them, nor means of getting away
by sea, they had leave to make their conditions with Cromwell, to pass through
his quarters out of the Kingdom, which being granted by him, all the small
remainder of my Lord of Inchiquins men, (except a few that Colonel Buller was
to Carry for Scilly) went under the conduct of Colonel John Daniell into the
enemies quarters; so did my Lord of Ardes, and after him, Sr. Thomas Armstrong,
with whom went also Mr. Daniell O Neille upon the Score of carrying a Regiment
into Spain, There remained none behind, that was permitted to bear any
charge, but Leiutenant Colonel Treswell, at my Lord of Ormonds particular
instance to command his Guards of horse; only my Brother John Digby, Colonel
Henry Warren, and Colonel Hugh Butler staid to wait upon his Excellencies
Person, and bear him company in his adventures.

But before I go on, I must not omit to tell you, how Dean Boil, who was sent
to treat with Cromwell for the English, that were disbanded, being offered it,
as he says, by Cromwell, and imagining, as himself affirms, to do a service
to my Lord Leiutenant, and my Lord Inchiquin, in it, adventured of his own head
to take passes from him, for their departure out of the Kingdom; Whereof, as soon
as ever Dean Boil was gone, he makes use to debaush the Irish Garrisons, to
take conditions from him, assuring them my Lord Leiutenant had received his
pass to depart the Kingdom, as appears by a letter that the Governor of
Rosse writ (it seems by Cromwells order) unto General Preston commanding in
Waterford; the Copy of which Letter, with that of Cromwells pass, and three of
Dean Boiles Letters concerning it, together with his Excellencies to Cromwell,
when he sent him back his pass by a trumpet of my Lord Clanricards, (having
procured them for my own satisfaction) I herewithall send your Lordship, that
you may see how absolutely without my Lord Leiutenants privity, or license
these passes were accepted, and with what indignation resented. Emer Mac Mahon
Bishop of Cloghor, who had been chosen General of the Vlster army, having a
good while since received his commission from my Lord Leiutenant, was now
gathering together his army, which in ad short time after (before my leaving
the Kingdom) he had made up to be about 6000 men, wherewith having taken
several little Castles in his way, he was marched up into the Claneboyes, and
become master of the field.

The next enterprise Cromwell went in hand with, was, to take Clonmell which
was kept by Major General Hugh O Neale, who behaved himself so discreetly,
and gallantly in defending it, that Cromwell lost near upon 2500 men before it,
and had notwithstanding gone away without it, if they within had had store of
powder; but their small proportion being spent, the Governor with his
soldiers was fain to go out of the town on the other side of the river by
night toward Waterford, and leave the townsmen to make conditions for
themselves; which they did the next morning, the enemy not knowing but the
Garrison was still in town, till the conditions were signed. Thus the loss of
this place, and several other Garrisons, for want of ammunition, was another
effect of the disobedience of the towns; In so much, that had it not been for
a little magazine, that my Lord of Clanricard had providently made before hand,
and wherewith, since the loss of Drogheda, his Excellencies army, the Scots,
the Vlsters, and most of the Garrisons were surnished; All might have gone to
an irrecoverable ruin, whilst the walld towns like free States looked on, as
unconcernd, denying to afford it to them.

This being true, no body that has heard of any injuries, or injustice in
point of trade, or prizes here, can blame the King, or my Lord Leiutenant for
it, neither of whom they did obey, further then they pleased themselves, but now
having received Garrisons, (as I make no question they have) I dare be bold to
assure any body, that trafficks that way, of all equity, and justice from my
Lord Leiutenant hands. About the time of the seidge of Clonmell, David Roch
having raised above 2000 men in the Counties of Cork, and Kerry, and beginning
to make head with them, received a small brush from my Lord of Broghall, which
only dispersed his men for a few days, his loss being not considerable for
any thing, but the Bishop of Rosse, who being taken was hanged with two other
Priests by Cromwell, for being found in arms (as they said) against the Right
worshipful the State of England.

Soon after the gaining of Clonwell, Cromwell, upon letters out of England,
inviting him thither, goes to sea, and leaves Ireton in chief command behind
him, to subdue the rest of that miserable wasted Kingdom, whilst himself went
about the conquest of new Empires, more worthy of his presence; But since he is
gone, I cannot but here observe, that of all those thousands, that either came
with him thither, or were sent after, there are now few hundreds surviving,
either to reap the benefit, or report the stories of their Victories; his army
upon his departure being sunk to a very inconsiderable number, especially in
foot, and near three parts of those consisting of either Irish, Jones, or my
Lord of Inchiquins men, who only are able to undergo the woeful incommodities
of that Country, now groaning under a universal plague famine, and desolation,
to that degree, that if they knew but half the misery that expects them there,
I am confident that no threats, nor flatteries, could persuade men out of
England thither, in hopes of reaping the fruits of their fellows labors in
that destroyed Kingdom. Which, as low as it is brought, may chance to cost
Cromwell a second expedition, and another army, and yet go without it.

For they have Waterford, Galloway, and Limrick three of the strongest, and
most considerable towns of the Kingdom still untaken, any of which, if they be
well Garrisond (as questionless now they are) will be near a summers work to
reduce; The forts of Duncannon, and Silgo, the Castles of Caterlo, Athlone,
Charlemont and Neauagh are not easy puachases; the Province of Connaght is
still preserved entire by my Lord of Clanricard, who will be able to bring 4000
men of his own into the field, now that Galloway and his Country is somewhat
cleard from the infection of the plague; which begins to rage greatly in the
enemies quarters, as Cork Youghall, Wexford, and Dublin it self; Kilkenuy,
Clonmell, with several places there abouts being left desolate with it. The
County of Clare in Mounster brought unto my Lord Leiutenant at a Rendezvous
just upon my coming away, above 2000 men wherewith his Excellency being invited
by the Magistrates was ready to march into Limrick for to Garrison the place,
and to make it his residence

What Forces the Irish had in Vlster, and toward Kerry, I have already told
you, as likewise what Connaght, and the County of Clare afforded: I must add
that Hugh Mac Phelim had in Wicklow, and toward Wexford, hard upon 2000 men,
and at Waterford. General Preston and Hugh O Neale had little less; to
conclude besides all this the Lord Castlehaven, the Lord Dillon, and the Bishop
of Drummore, made account they should draw together a considerable body in
Mead, and the rest of Leinster to join with the Marquis of Clanricard
toward, the releife of Tecroghan, then beseidged by Colonel Reynolds. Thus
your Lordship may see that (provided they be united amongst themselves) (as
truly I left them) and that means can be found of keeping them in bodies
together, there are men enough in arms yet to dispute the business with an
enemy, that is not half their number, and whose quarters are pestered likewise
with the plague, and famine, as well as theirs, especially these having such
strengths, and fastnesses, still in their hands, as are almost inaccessible to
Cromwells soldiers. Who after having mastered the greatest part of Mounster,
and Leinster, and their supplies from England coming in but slowly ^ have made
bold at last with the people they flattered with before, and altered their
manner of proceedings, taking from them by force what they pleased, and
violating their protections given; making not nice to tell them, they suffered
them to possess their estates but during pleasure, and till they could have
planters to put into their rooms; by which kind of clear dealing they have so
lost, and made desperate the natives, that lamenting their former too ready
compliance with the enemy, they now call for my Lord Leiutenant again, and
taking arms in their hand begin to rise in all quarters of the Kingdom, so
that it is impossible for a greater power then Ireton has there to attend to
the suppression of them all.

In this posture left I that Kingdom, it being very probable, that if the
enemies recruites, and provisions out of England did fail through any other
diversion, and the Irish receive but any moderate supplies from abroad, they
would not only make good all that was left them, But also recover upon the
enemy considerably this Summer, which really I wish with all my soul they may,
Principally for His Majesty's sake, and the present engagement of the Kingdom
of Scotland, to both which the preservation of what is left, or the regaining
of what is lost in Irland, must needs be, if well considered, of high
concernment; And in the next place for the sake of many worthy families amongst
them, some of which were never involved in the association, nor had any hand in
the war, and many of the rest, through the menaces and strange kind of
proceedings of the Parliament against the whole Nation upon the Insurrection,
and the villainous practices of Parsons, and Burlacy, the then Lords Justices
who desired to make them all forfeit their estates, were frighted and forced
into Rebellion. All which are now to suffer equally, and by Cromwell with out
distinction designed for ruin, together with those, that were the Original
authors of the first Rebellion, and those ugly massacres, that were committed:
which indeed deserves commiseration, since very many of the Nobility, and
gentry, with the body of the people wish the King as well, and have as great
dispositions to his service, as can be desired, having been abused who^ into
those offenses they have committed, by a few malicious ill affected persons,
craftier then most of the rest; Who ha^ with great art, and industry acquired
unto themselves the opinion of wise, religious, and honest men: Whereby they
mislea^ that credulous, and for the most part unwise Nation, upon pretense of
the advancement of their Roman Religion, and preservation of their Country, to
what they please.

Having been able to persuade them, that all these afflictions, and misfortunes
they suffer under, are come upon them for their admitting of a cessation, and a
peace indisobedience to the Nuntio, and for their joining with Heretics; Not
suffering them to consider rightly, that it is their disobedience to the
lawful King, and the blood, and murder they are guilty of that, makes them so
unfortunate, that is their breaches of public faith in compliance with the
Nuntio, the rapine, and want of justice, that reigns amongst them, that has
brought upon them these heavy punishments, and given them over to be scourged
by the hand of so faithless, and Bloody an enemy. And surely whosoever shall
recollect how first, after the double breach of the former peace, they were
immediately punished with the defeat of two considerable armies, one after
another; with the desolation of the flourishingest part of their Country; upon
which a famine ensued, that devoured near 20000 souls, then how the plague,
that has since over spread the Kingdom, began first at Galloway the place that
did most, and longest countenance those ill proceedings of the Nuntio, and O
Neale, of any other in the Kingdom; where it swept away about 5000 souls, and
those only of the common, and meanest sort of people, who were they, that
contrary to the inclinations of the principal persons (being most of them
moderate, and well disposed men) carried all things their violent way.

Next how the Vlster army, which I hear have received a great defeat since my
coming away) who were the beginners of the rebellion, the breakers of the first
Peace, the opposers of the second, and the releivers of Derry, are now come to
fall under the hands of Coote, and those men, who, if it had not been for them,
had certainly been destroyed; And lastly how the Bishops of Tuam, and Cloghor,
who had so deep hands in the contrivance of the war, and were guilty of so
much blood, have both fallen (if the printed relation concerning the last of
them be true) upon the edge of the sword, together with their armies The
Bishops of Rosse, and Down also, (the first of which had, not many weeks
before his own miscarriage, appeared very unhandsomely in the persecution of
the Protestant Lord Bishop of London Derry, a person of great worth,
moderation, and prudence, and one; Who, as he had meritted highly from the King
for his loyalty, and constant services, so, also was he very far to my
knowledge, from deserving ill from that Kingdom; The second, one, who had ever
cherished stirrs and factions, and both of them notoriously averse to peace,
and to the Government, coming to perish ignominiously in the hands of those
enemies, (that by staving off a timely submission to the Kings Authority, and
hindering the settlement of the Country) they may be said, after a sort, to
have brought into the Kingdom. He must needs, as I do, admire the order of Gods
Chastisements, with submission acknowledging that he is just, and that his
judgments are right.

Through whose fault, or through what miscarriage, Tecroghan is lost after it
has been so long and gallantly defended by Sr. Robert Talbot, and the lady
Fitz-Garret, and the Vlster army defeated, I cannot undertake to say, since
they are accidents after my coming to sea, Though I do much fear that the
first was occasioned principally through the relics of those unhappy
emulations and backwardnesses that dwelt in some of the great ones against
others who were like to reap too much honor and advantage from the enterprise
in case that place had been releived and preserved.

What ever the matter were I confess those mischances have much altered the
case from what it was, but yet I despair not of the business in giving all for
gone, but hope Gods justice having been in some measure satisfied, and the
people being become more humble, and more united, that by Gods blessing they
may weather this storm, and preserve themselves with that Kingdom to the King.
However I am confident this late defeat of the Vlster army under the conduct of
the Bishop of Cloghor by so small a party will convince the people, that these
misfortunes are not entailed unto either my Lord of Ormonds person, or
religion, and conduce much to satisfy them, that his Excellency has neither
betrayed the Kings Interest, nor them into this low condition they are brought
into; Of which being once persuaded, they will turn their hearts, and fix
their hopes wholly upon the Kings Leiutenant; Who, believe me my Lord, is as
Wise, as Honorable, and Gallant a Person as is any where to be found, and as
excellent a subject, as any Prince in the world can boast of; Yea and one who,
I assure your Lordship, (if ever he shall think it fit to give the world an
account of his actions) is able with modesty, and truth to say so much for
himself, and for what he has done, as will wring a confession out of the
mouth of envy herself, that he has behaved himself so prudently, and so
uprightly in the place he now holds notwithstanding all these forementioned
misfortunes, that no man has ever out gone him in loyalty to, or merit from
the Crown and Royal house of England, of which a better argument needs not be
given then that most Excellent Speech (for the eloquence, and subject of it
deserving an Eternal Memory) delivered by his own mouth unto the General
Assembly of the Confederates upon the conclusion of the Peace wherein you will
find the Principles he goes upon, so Loyal, and so Vnbyassed; The Treasons,
Defections, and Impaciencies of the people that have fallen out since, through
the national animosities particular factions and pressures of the war so
prudently foreseen, and so Prophetically foretold, that those persons (of what
Nation soever they be) must be as blind as they are Malicious that shall
attribute any of those misfortuns that have ensued, either to want of Abilities
or Fidelity in my Lord Leiutenant.

Wherefore I Lordship (if any where it seem less clear, and satisfactory, then
you could wish) not to look upon this short account I have given, as upon all
that might have been said upon the subject, for these being only reflections of
my own, and delivered in such have, it is no wonder, if some things be
mistaken, and more forgot, by him that is with all the duty and affection in
the world:

My Noblest Lord Your Lordships most devoted humble servant LEWIS DYVE.
From the Hague July the 10. 1650. 20.
THE COPIES. Of the several LETTERS Mentioned by SR. LEWIS DYVE In the
foregoing Discourse.
A Letter of the Marquis of Clanricard to Mr. Walsingham Secretary to my
Brother the Lord Digby concerning his Lordships taking arms In defense of the
Cessation-mentioned. PAGE 6.
WORTHY COVSEN,
THough at a late hour, accept of my thankful acknowledgements for the
frequent intelligences and advises I have received from you; though the
obstructions they met within their Passage to me, and their finding me
engaged in the remotest parts of the Kingdom, did not afford me opportunity to
keep the like Correspondence with you, nor reap the full benefit of your
advertisements: which a more quick and seasonable convayance might have
produced. But now, not knowing what, or whether any right information has gone
from hence of our past proceedings, I hold it not impertinent (having met with
so sure a messenger) to entertain you with some breife notions of them,
Conceiving your friendship and respect to me, will take of the Scandal of any
vanity or ostentation in me to be the true relator of my own story unto you
in these disastrous times.

Upon my Lord Lieutenants and my Lord Digbyes departure (having divested my
self of that small power then remaining with me, and sequestered my thoughts
from ingageing in any business) I retired to some Castles of mine near the sea
side, with an intention together with my family to ship for France; but not so
settled in that resolution as not to be inclined to weather out the storm, as
long as I could discern any probability of safety in that solytary retirement,
in which I remained until my Lord of Inchiquin declared for the King, and that
intelligence was brought me of my Lord Lieutenants arrival in France; and the
probability of his return hither in his former Command.

Then upon Consideration of the Condition of affairs in order to the Kings
service, (though the distemper of this miserable age could not afford me such
authorities as might secure my undertaking) I thought it a seasonable and
becoming duty in me to appear abroad, and make some trial how the people
stood affected toward a setlement: Whereupon finding many friends well
disposed, and willing to run any hazard with me rather then admit of my
departure out of the Kingdom: I put on a resolution to appear in arms in
opposition to General O Neales, and the Nuntios faction, who were then grown
very strong and resolved both to break the present government, and overthrow
all overtures toward a peace.

In breife after I had framed and published a declaration (which I am confident
you have seen ere this, and therein observed the streights I was put unto to
keep my self within due limits, and to make it likewise satisfactory to those
parties whose assistance was necessary for me.) I procured my Lord Taaffe and
a party of my Lord of Inchiquins to come and join themselves unto those forces
I had raised; whereupon we advanced toward Owen O Neale then at Athlone, who
though he exceeded us in number marched away through the counties of Roscommon
and Letrim clearly out of Conaght: Whereby I recovered the strong castle of
Athlone (formerly as you know so destructively and so unseasonably lost) James
Town a very considerable place, the Mote, Elphin, and several other holds of
strength and consequence; by which means, and by the committall of some
principal factions persons, having settled the lower parts of the province. I
returned homewards; where some rebellious persons and others of the county of
Mayo associated with the town of Galway, and taking the advantage of my absence
had surprised some Castles of mine, and stopped the arms and ammunition I had
contracted for at Galway. But after having blockt up that town I brought them
to a submission within three weeks, and to pay a considerable sum of money:
Besides all which J would have forced them to take in a Gurrison but that I was
necessitated to hasten away, and attend Owen O Neales motions; who having
fetched a great compass was gotten into Ormond, and had surprised the Neanagh
(a strong Castle of my Lord Lieutenants tenanted by young Sr. George Hamilton)
after which he took the Birr in the Kings County, and then Fort falkland; a
fort of the Kings which had a dangerous Prospect toward me; giving him
passage over the River within seven miles of Portumna.

But by the time I was drawn of from Galway and gotten home, I received
intelligence from my Lord of Inchiquin that he was in pursuit of Oneile and
had by storm regained the Neanagh, and likewise Birr; And finding him desirous
of the assistance of my forces to attempt Fort falkland, I repaired immediately
unto him, with a considerable party of horse and foot: When being ready at last
to fall upon the fort, my Lords Officers tired with foul weather, and long
Marches after Oneile would not be persuaded to stay: But whilst this was in
dispute (most luckily as it fell out) Owen O Neale with 7000. foot, and 500.
horse clapped down hard by us in astreight of Bogge and wood and thereby utterly
obstructed our passage back; so that our army being forced to stay I prevaild
that my men with my Lords Battery should attend upon the fort, whilst my Lords
army did face Owen O Neale: Whereby after a day or two battering, the fort was
surrendered to us; and O Neale who thought ^o starve us had that lot himself,
being, forced to steal away in the night; and then I having plentifully
supplied the army by boat out of the county of Galway) his Lordship had a free
passage back, leaving me in the possession of the fort much to my advantage and
security. Soon after which to perfect our Good Success, we received certain
notice of my Lord Lieutenants being landed at Cork, which concludes this story.

I shall not need to enlarge my self upon the happy concluding of the peace,
and the great difficulties we overcame; they will come fully represented unto
you by several ways. J shall only express my confidence that we are now
secured from any second revolutions amongst these people, though the Marquis of
Antrim and Owen O Neale have not yet submitted, for I conceive they are not so
considerable but they will be soon suppressed if they continue obstinate. I judge
it likewise very possible that this summer Dublin may (if God so please) be
recovered either by force or treaty. And now believing I have tired you with
this tedious imperfect relation, I shall with brevity and much truth give you
assurance that you shall constantly find me.

Your very affectionate Cosen CLANRICARDE.
Kilkenny Castle the 26. of January 1648.
A Letter of Mr. Walsinghams to Colonel Jones Governor of Dublin in
justification of the peace of Yrland, and in reply to his second answer to my
Lord Lieutenant. Mentioned, PAGE 8.
SR.
HAvinge been at last so much beholdinge to your vanity, as some days since to
meet with those papers in printe that I long before heard were transmitted
between my Lord Lieutenant and your self; which I perceive his Excellencies
modesty and scorn would have still concealed, had not your itch to have your
confidence, and clearkeship known, transported you so far beyond discretion as
to snatch at the occasion of publishing my Lord Lieutenants letters (though
such indeed as if your care and prudence in manageing the cause you plead for,
were not far inferior to your own vaineglory you would industriously have
smothered) to the end you might not want some pretense to intrude upon the
world together with them, those manifest Cavills, and lean discourses of yours
that are stuffed with nothing singular but insolence, and malice. And finding
that his Excellency with a generous neglect both of your person and
impertinence (with whom his public zeal, and duty to the King and Kingdom
had enduced him to take thy pains, and descend so low) had now as one unworthy
of so much honor, and incapable of so much reason as was pressed upon you, given
you over.

Notwithstanding as well for justice sake that you might not want the right of
an encounter from a more equal hand then my Lord Lieutenant, as also for that
possibly there may be (as I believe there are) some men so weak and so willing
to be deceived, that your impudence and fallacies shall pass for reasons with
them if not replied unto; I thought it fit that your last voluminous and
peremptory Letter be not let pass unscand, and brought unto the test by a more
familiar pen; that may with decency deal roundly with you, and give you (what
you cannot receive from his Excellency) the confusion of an foil.

Though for man to think either with reason or language to contribute to the
satisfaction of any discreet unprejudiced person, much less to the rectifieing
your mistakes after my Lord of Ormond has gone before: is a sottishness as
great as yours, who after two addresses from his Excellency so civil, so full
of prudence, and unanswerable truth, had the face to tell him you were nothing
satisfied therewithal, nor any way convinced in judgment thereby.

By which affirmation of how much impudence and malice you are convicted by
your self, I leave you and the world to gather out of what I shall hereafter
say; which I am confident will convince other men as well as you (that know it
well enough already) that your judgment was drowned in ambitious, and self
interests so absurd, and so ill biased, that since reason and justice were
inconsistent with them, you had no will to be rectified.

For if you had, surely you would never have produced arguments to coulor your
persisting withal; that well examined perswad point blanck against, and may be
returned with a double force upon you; (unless you did it out of so invincible
a simplicity (as to deal painely with you) is not compatible with that
hipocrisy and sophistry your unmannerly epistle swells withal; as I now come to
instance particaliarly unto you.

In the first place you hold forth the protestant religion for a baby to the
people, and alas good man your compassion and care of it is very great, as well
becomes the son unto a Bishop, and one imbued both by education and many
years profession with it, you say you see not how it can be advanced by an
army of Papists, nor how it can be secured in the peace no provision being made
for it therein: yet that it is no such miracle (they being secured of their own
liberty of conscience) that an army of Catholics, subjects to a protestant
King, and lead by a protestant General, may in order to the restoreing their
opressed sovereign, and to the supression of such a Turco Iudaisme as is now
on foot be induced unto it; and that it is no new thing in the world for men to
be engaged so, nay (where they have no ties of duty, nor other such powerful
motives as these men have) directly against the interest of their own
religion, you need but look into the, Othoman armies where you shall find
thousands of Christians fighting daily against Christianity it self, and under
the ensigns of France and Spain many regiments of protestants fighting in
quarrels if you will believe the princes themselves purposely set on foot for
the advancement of the Roman Catholic faith: which if waighed makes it
neither impossible nor strange that the Irish should be content to concur with
any body, and almost upon any terms to the destruction of that Wild Bore who
having already rooted up and overturned all government and religion in England,
is now preparing to do the like in Irland.

Now as for the provision the you find unmade for the protestant religion in
the peace, I believe you urge that only to show your own dexteritye in finding
out objections: for you are rational enough to know where his Majesty's
authority is once restored his laws return to their vigor; and you should be
lawyer enough to know that there are laws enough provided in this last
fourscore years for the securitye of the protestant religion, all which the
Roman Catholics will willingly submit unto except such penal statutes as
deprive them of the free exercise of their religion, that are indeed by the
peace to betaken a way, and which being laid aside, take not any thing from
the security of the protestant.

The Roman Catholics are not the givers but the cravers here; they desire
only to secure their own, not to usurp upon the liberty of othermens
consciences; as is evident both by their daily professions, and the whole
transactions of the peace, what absurdnes then it is for any one to think a
new provision necessary; or to expect it in this case, that very condition for
that army of sixteen thousand foot, and two thousand five hundred horse, with
the deputation of those Trustees for to secure them of pardon for their past
offenses, and of liberty of conscience, with those other promised graces and
immunities against the severitie of the laws in force, until all were
confirmed in Parliament: to any man endued with but Common sense is a sufficient
argument; to say nothing of the apprehensions (though vain) still amongst them
that they are yet not for all this secure enough.

And what cause they had to insist upon this army and these commissioners, do
you but look into your own Conscience and laying your hand upon your heart
imagine so well of your self as that it were your own case, and J am sure you
will tacitly confess it is a provision but very reasonable. Nay let a looker
on consider the time these men took to submit to his Majesty's authority, when
he had neither means to punish, nor protect them left; and he will certainly
commend their duty, and be far from discommending either the king or my Lord
Lieutenant for any thing that in the peace is granted unto them; not excepting
against either the number of that army, or power of those Comissioners you make
your self so scandalized withal.

His Excellency has been already pleased to tell you that as to the army the
supreme command thereof is in the Kings Lieutenant; the ordering of which, and
disposing of all future commands wherein so it consist of, and be to Roman
Catholics will in effect be left to him; now that there are very many of that
Religion inseparable from their duty to the King, both the confederats and the
Parliament have to their great cost and trouble had a plentiful experience;
witness the prudent and generous Marquess of Clanricard, Whose eminent piety
and constancy in his profession, joynd to his irreprehensible allegiance to the
King will remain to the glory of his Nation and Religion a great and lasting
example to future times of a firm and united Loyalty both to divine and humane
Majesty; as it has serud the present already for a pattern unto several Other
considerable persons in Ireland to follow. And you have no reason but to think
there are a good number of those in this army which will somewhat lessen the
groundles danger you fancy to your self: especially if you take also into
consideration the frequent ways and dispensations that have bin found for
entertaining very many protestants into several employments in this army; and
how both these parties (to say nothing of those in the north that have
submitted to the Kings authority) added to that remnant army as you call them
in mounster consisting of about six thousand men, led by an able and succesful
commander (who being undeceived at last by the public villainies in England
have betrayed themselves (it you will have it so) again into their duty will
balance any thing of ill that may be pretended in the case, I leave it to any
one that is but capable to judge in such a matter.

This dangerous argument being once removed how little remains of hazard in
that other of the power of the commissioners, is very evident by the articles
of peace; where it is plain that their power is absolute in nothing but the
levies to be made upon their own and that part of the peoples free holds which
formerly acknowledged their Jurisdiction, and who now had entrusted themselves
into their hands: whilst in all the other cases so industriously quoted by you
(though to no other end but take up paper, and amuze the readers) they limit
him as little as formerly the counsel table did; He being able to determine
nothing without their advise or Consent, nor they to actuate any thing without
his Commission and authority: which circumscription should you still affirm to
be too much, would entirely vanish should his Majesty com in person hither
(as it is both hoped and believed he will) there being no condition in the peace
that limits him.

But suppose the hazard and prejudice of the protestant religion by the peace
were as great as you affirm it is, whether must be in fault the King, or those
men that pressed him to that extremity that he was only left to choose whether he
would drown, or take hold of a brier to save himself; whether he would utterly
abandon his interest in all his Kingdoms to those that were rebels against his
person, his posterity and Kingly power, or by giving the Irish whose rebellion
could in the nature of it bear nothing so ill a Construction those not much
unreasonable conditions they so positively insisted upon) repossesse himself
of one of his three Kingdoms again, and thereby become enabled to dispute for the
other two.

Thus far have I discoursed for the satisfaction of other men, with your self
I might deal more briefly, and tell you it is gross hipocrisy for you to
pretend so much solicitude for the security and advantage of the protestant
religion on this side; and yet can find them both sufficiently provided for by
an army of Sectaries on the other side (without any protestant superior to
moderate them as these have) that have not only quite pulled down the whole
building of that Religion but almost leveld the walls of Christianity it
self? by providing a liberty for all opinions and religions in the world the
Catholic and protestant alone excepted because they conceive them forsooth to
be more destructive to the great ends of their republique then any other, the
first, as being too Monarchique, too full of Majesty, and pleading prescription
amongst Christians, with too much authority; and therefore likely to gain
overmuch ground upon them in a time when all order and religion were of the
hinges, and the people so much at a gaze; and the second as being for decency
and order not only overpopish but also from its birth too much interwouen with
the interests, of this Crown and royal family.

Can any thing be more ridiculous then, that you who derive your power from the
Commanders and Commissioners of this army of saints, and who are by your
Commission (if I be not mistaken) incorporated into it, having likewise set
aside the profession, and exercise of this protestant religion (misconceive me
not) that Religion which for near a Century of years has been practiced and
established in the church of England, and accommodated your self clearly to
Mr. Cromwells Cut (though such a one as you or scarce himself if Cathechized
can give an account either of the tenants or constitutions of) should become so
great a patron of, and so much concerned in, the interests of a religion that
either out of Change of judgment, or out of ends (no matter which in this
case) is abandoned by your self already.

After the protestant religion comes the English interest; a consideration
indeed if urged to a person whose trust from, and concernment in it were
somewhat less then my Lord Lieutenants, fit for you that are of English blood,
and whose sword and pen are both by nature, and the laws obliged to the
service of that crown (in which only, and the colonies of English here, the
English interest of this Kingdom is included) but what this English Interest
is when we shall have once examined your fright concerning it will soon be
over; it appears to me to be nothing else but that the right and authority of
the crown of England over them should be acknowledged by all the subjects of
this Kingdom; and those Colonies of English, as well as the native Irish, be
thereby protected and secured in the possession of such fortunes, and estates,
as either by the sword, the royal gift, or purchase have bin lawfully acquired
unto them. Beyond this the English Interest is an unknown-land to me; and how
far this Interest thus stated is secured by, or Consistent with that peace you
blame so, I leave it to any third unpreiudiced person to determine.

Who I am certain will find them square so well together, that he shall have
reason to believe the English interest taken in your sense infers an obedience
to you, and your independent masters abstract from all relation to the crown:
an establishment of your Tetrarchy here, till your ambition were wearied out,
and you with your corrupt and hungry family had ungratefully glutted yourselves
in the blood and fortunes of those noble persons whose smiles and patronage in
your mercenarie pleading days were the top of your ambition; that so by this
consequence, the lives and estates of all that have been here in arms, may
beleft a prey to worse rebels then the worst of these have ever been.

This is an English interest indeed that the peace securs not, and which I
cannot blame you for pleading for with so much passion as to affirm, that were
there neither king nor parliament you would maintain it; neither for averring
that my Lord Lieutenants transporting a considerable part of the English army
hence, was destructive unto: but as to the true English Interest I mentioned
before, it was very suitable to that, that my Lord Lieutenant should without
dispute ^omply with the Kings commands: from whom only he had his commission
and derived his authority, and whom both himself and that army in all
relations both of honor and duty were obliged to obey. Besides his Excellency
knows well enough how much he was concerned in the support of that cron^ne that
gave him and all the English in this Kingdom the title to what they possessed
here; nothing of which could be long secure unto them, and the crown at home
in danger.

In the next place I do not know whether the Parliament is more beholding to you
for asserting their infringed authoriti^; or the Irish themselves in your being
so generous as to let them see the invalidity of this peace they are abused
withal: for to prove both which you bring noworse an argument then an English
act of Parliament; which underfavour your own skill in the law (if you have not
forgot it) will tell you can be of no force here, until received by a
Parliament in Irland: which asserts a power as just and absolute to it self,
as the Parliament of England can; else should the ancient conquerors of this
Kingdom, and their free posterity, unjustly undergo the dominion of those, to
whom neither Interest, nor merit has given any right or footing here, or
privilege over them.

Besides you shall have others which will tell you, and make it good, that a
Prince cannot give a way the Jurisdiction of his people to one that has no
title to it (as the Parliament of England has none to Irland) without their own
consent: yet grant for argument sake that these people by taking arms
unlawfully had put themselves into that condition that might as well enable as
induce the late King of ever glorious memory to invest the Parliament of
England with such a power over them as that act involues; yet can it not be
believed that the King ever intended to trust them with managing the war of
Irland against himself: as by what they have don in England it is evident they
would have done; but let us also suppose it possible that the royal power can
be so convayed unto another, as that contrary to the intention of the King it
may be converted to his own destruction (which is a possition I am sure that no
Sophister less accute, and learned then your self will be able to make good)
yet must this power surely needs revert to its firfl original the crown:
through the death both of the King that gave it, of the Parliament it was
conferd upon, and that (since that the Kings death is out of dispute) this
Parliament has for this seven years at least wanted both a King and freedom
which being the head and heart of that body are two things most necessary to the
life and essence of it, nay that, that breathless headles carcass of a
Parliament, has by those Independent vermin that bred out of the putrifacton
of it; been anatomized and quite dismembered since, there is no man that is not
deaf and blind that can be uninformd.

Now that such a martird mooncalfe canstil be a living Parliament I am sure
there is no man wakes that can be so persuaded; especially the King that called
it being dead, which both the law and custom tells you, that a Parliament could
never yet survive: upon which conclusion you must needs grant that his present
Majesty (who has already confirmed by his; both my Lord Lieutenant, and all
that his Excellency has don by his Royal fathers Commission) has now
indisputably reverted to him the power to manage a war, and conclude or
con^irme a peace in Irland except that you will still maintain that the
authority of the late Parliament is by I know not what legierdemain translated
into those usurpers, that have not only destrojed that Parliament but also
declared that they intend there shall never be any more; and this non
consequence if you still insist upon, I will conclude you are cracked as was
that Spanish gallant and leave you in your quest of Windmills.

But if you can prevayle with your self to be so ingenuous as acknowledge the
preceding truths, I will hold on still, and endeavor to remove out of your
tender conscience your last and greatest difficult of breach of trust: indeed a
scruple very suitable to a man of honor such as I would willingly take you
for; and to begin the work I must tell you that the premises are very
convinceing that in your compliance with my Lord Lieutenant there is no trust
broken either with God, or King, or Parliament (who are all you can pretend to
owe a faith unto) by deserting those villainous impostors, who have supplanted
religion subverted Monarchy, murdered the King, violated the Parliament
annihilated the laws, trampled upon learning and nobility, and left neither
worth nor justice unopprest within their reach; which kind of perfidious people
surely to deceive right reason it self tells you there is no deceit.

Yet had you no such assurance I should think it strange, that you who have
stretched your Conscience so often and so far already, as first to break your
trust with the King when by several oaths both as a gown man and a swordman
you had oblidged your faith unto him; then with religion which considered with
your education, parents, and a long profession, we may say (and not improperly)
that it was even by nature convayed into you; after, with that late carcass of
a Parliament from whom you took both Commissions and employment; and lastly
with that presbyterian Senate that preferred you hither as a proselite of theirs,
should I say now make a scruple of breaking with these wretches, to whom you
can pretend no other tie, but a Confraternity in treachery and mischeife.

It is not your repetition of Rebels and bloody Rebels will serve for your
excuse, since that you your self are engaged with those rebels that have
waded deeper into blood, and committed murder even with the sword of Justice
upon not only innocent but Royal blood; more impudently, and more in humanly
then any people how barbarous soever that as yet have breathed under the face
of heaven.

It Is true there has been much barbarity and cruelty acted in this Kingdom
since these unhappy tumults in the midst of confusion and disorder, but nothing
done under the form of a mischeivous law or the color of abused Justice,
against any body; much less against the life, or person of a King, and the
best of Kings, such as those whom you will needs profess a faith unto have
butchered on a scaffold, with a hitherto unequalld villainy, which without all
doubt heaven to convince the world that there is a divinity and justice there,
will certainly when his indignation toward us is in some measure satisfied, at
last see Notoriously punished upon them, and all their abettors with scourges
as much transcending ours, as do their crimes.

And in order to this just revenge it will be virtue in the King and my Lord
Lieutenant (which as your self confesses will be a sin in you circumstances
considered) not only to forgive but court Father Reyley (and if there be any
others of his party less pardonable and less avowable then he) unto their
duty whom you can pretend to do nothing with in your Intrigues but either
confirm them in their present, or engage them in a new rebellion worse and
more malicious then that they are already plunged in, and which they (being a
trampled and abused people, of another nation and religion from their
Sovereign) leapt at first into, out of a general fear, and sense of their
particular wrongs from, and aversions to those, who frequently misused upon
them both their own power and the Kings authority.

For the restitution of whose just Sovereignty, and the preservation of whose
life, my Lord Lieutenant (whom you expres a shamlesse impudency to accuse with
any guilt of his destruction has run greater adventures in his person, made
more prudent essaies, and under went the hazard of a better fortune then any
subject in the three Kingdoms had to loose besides; against whom your inference
is very strange, that because by the Kings own direction and Commission he
endeavored to set on foot the Royal interest again, he musts need be guilty
of, what was acted by those that (before he left France, or appeard the second
time here about it) had already robbed the King of his liberty, and actually
declared against his life.

But they having since ravished from his Majesty his life as well as liberty,
and taken away both his Crown and Royal head together, so contrary to your
then declared opinion (delivered as your self confesses to my Lord Lieutenant
when the army first Seized on the person of the King who as you there professed
to believe intended nothing else but to secure him from attempts and danger)
must needs be a motive sufficient either to Convert you from adhering longer
unto them, or an argument at least to convince me and all the world, that you
both approved of, and consented to, what ever they have done: how foreign
soever you seem to make it to your charge, in a City where, and at a time
when, if you should own it you might well fear to pull the indignation of the
people, and a certain destruction upon your own head.

Yet surely you would much more have played the man of honor to have laid aside
these grosser cheats and Mummeries, and dealing plainly to have avowed the bare
faced Truth (as your great masters in England have found the courage and the
confidence to do) that it is neither your care of the protestant Religion, or
English Interest, neither your duty to the Parliament, nor tenderness in breach
of trust, that holds you from submitting to the King and my Lord Lieutenant but
your over consciousnesse of your own past unfaithfulnes and ingratitude to
those you had so many ties unto, your despair of a full and free forgivenes,
your observation that villainy now a days is only prosperous, and your
conception that the course you are in suits more with your mistaken Interest
and wild ambitions then returning to your duty would; lastly your desire to
continue yourselfe and that Sr. Politic, your most reverend brother, there A
Moses and Aron to the Irish Isralites to conduct them safe out of the boggs and
woods of their fortunes and estates through the deserts of delinqnency; until
they stripped of all those cumbersom impediments were ready for the land of
promise, and you laden with their Egiptian spoils, and a good old age were fit
to be transplanted from Dublin to the government of the new Jerusalem.

But let me now at last before it be too late prevayle with you so far as to
persuade your self that it is never too late to mend, that both the King and
my Lord Lieutenant have mercy and generosity enough to forgive and forget all
your past transgressions, that fortune (how hopefully soever she seem to look
upon you) has neither leased out her wheels unto your Chariot, nor victory
intailed her self unto you Ensigns so, as to encourage you to that confidence
and presumption you do put on; forgetting that God Almighty does frequently
lull in security and besot with their past and present prosperities those that
are designed for a headlong destruction: and lastly that (how succesfull soever
it may be for a time) there is a fulness of iniquity which men being once
arrived unto, Gods judgments are never long behind. Which exuberance of sin if
any people ever attained unto, surely it is they that have been either actors
in, or abettors of, the murder of the King: of the guilt of which horrid
crime, that you may clear your self, and prevent the hevy judgment that
infallibly attends it by a seasonable submission and returning to your duty, is
all that he aims at, who has dealt thus freely with you; and who on that
score will be most really.

Sr. Your very humble servaunt. EDWARD WALSINGHAM.

The several Papers concerning Cromwells Pass to my Lord Lieutenant.
Mentioned PAGE 48.
Dean Boyles, Letter to my Lord Lieutenant touching the transactions with
Cromwell in behalf of the disbanded English.
May it please your Excellency
BEing now returned from the enemies quarters, I am bold to give your Lordship
an account of what we have done there; we were two days held in suspense by
General Cronwell whether he would descend to any capitulation upon those
articles we delivered him, dureing which time, his arguments were few, but his
persuasions many, to come in upon a Clear score without any articling for
conditions, and that he said would put the whole party into a Condition of
being trusted by the Parliament, which their insisting upon articles would
deprive them of; But we, wholly waving the force of his persuasions, told him
that we were limited by instructions, and to decline them in any particular,
were very unfaithful, and beyond our Commission, we therefore desired his
positive resolution, whether he would ascertaine them of their securities, or
the like, or no, that so we might return with an account to them that sent us,
whereupon ireton objected that by those proposals, which we gave in to them,
our design might be to contract for the Lord Inchiquint estate, as well as
others, he being under your Excellencies command, to which I made him this
answer, that indeed it was much the desires of the Officers to serve him in
that particular, but that I had peremptory directions from his Lordship to
signify unto them that it was not your Excellencies intent, or his Lordships to
Capitulate with then at all, or to be comprised under any general Conditions,
whereuphn Cromwell then made answer, that if that were our purpose he would not
a jot the more decline the business; There were many hours wasted in debate.
before we came to any issue, at last the result of all determined in these
enclosed conditions, wherein your Excellency may he pleased to observe, that
there lies no obligation at all on our parts, but all on theirs, so that your
Excellency may dispose of your men, or any number of them, as you shall think
fitting, notwithstanding any engagements from us, only thus much we are obliged
to, that our party under the covert of those articles, do not prejudice them in
the surprisal of any of their guarrisons, or the like, which emboldens me to
beseech your Excellency, that Sr. Thomas Armstrong may take notice of it, and
send his engagement hither, for Sr. Robert Sterlings, and Lieutenant Colonel
Daniells security, and mine, this enclosed to him I held it my duty to present
open to your Excellency, before I sent it to himself. My Lord Dureing my
being there, I had many opportunities, and hints given me by General Cromwell,
and Ireton whereby I might plainly understand that if I would move any thing
from your Excellency, or the Lord Inchiquin they would willingly hearken to it,
but I waved them all so far that they at last in plain English asked me what
your Lordship intended to do, if this party came of: I said I was not
acquainted with your resolutions, But that I beleeud you would endeavor to
form the army there into a considerable body, if upon the comeing off of the
English party, you did not find their behaviors to be such, as might give you
no great confidence of them, and so enforce you to desert them, if you were not
necessitated to tarry with them for want of convenient transportation; to which
they insinuated unto me, that I might have a Pass for your safe going of, if
you had a mind to it, and that I desired it; my reply was that I had no
commission to that purpose, but on the contrary had positive directions not to
ask any thing in your Lordship, or the Lord Inchiquins behalf, yet if they
would deliver me any such passes for your Excellency, and the Lord Inchiquin, I
would reserve them by me, and if I had any opportunity, make use of them; the
Passes I have here to dispose of as your Excellency shall appoint My Lord
Inchiquin does exceedingly dislike my bringing them at all, and the rather, be
cause there is not included in them a liberty for the ship it self, and all
others to go with you, that have an intent to wait upon you: But J find if
your Excellency have any inclination to make use of such a Pass, it might
easily be gained for any, that shall desire it, either for my Lord Muskery; or
my Lord Taaffe, or any other officer of quality; They say they are very much
concerned for the Marquis of Clanricard and if he would but desire any thing
that lies in their power to serve him, he should find that the State of England
would not be unmindfull of those many good offices (they were informed) he had
done for the poor Protestants in that country. They gave me likewise a hint
concerning Sr. Georg Hamilton, and the Castle of Nenagh, but I took no notice
of it. Upon discourse with General Cromwell, he said that he had no interest
at all in your estate, nor any design upon it: he pretends to be a great
servant of your ladies, and much to pity her condition, the estate which she
brought your Lordship, they openly profess, shall not be given to any from
her. The day before I came from thence, there came a packet, which gave them
some seeming disturbance, upon the observance whereof, I used means by one of
their own party to discourse with the captain that brought it, who certifyed
him that the news was very bad, and that Montrose was landed, or certainly did
intend to land in Irland, with 12000. men, something of consequence there is in
it, but whether this be the Certainty thereof, or no, it is not yet known. I
must beg your Excellencies pardon for this tedious, and rude diversion, which I
could very much lengthen by several other passages, but I fear I have
transgressed too far already, which submitting to your Excellencies Charitable
interpretation, I remain.

My Lord, Your Excellencies most faithful and most humble servant, M. BOIL.
Clare 30. April 1650.
Cromwells Pass unto my Lord Lieutenant.
By the Lord Lieutenant of Irland,
THese are to require you, and every of you, to permit and suffer his
Excellency the Lord Marquis of Ormond, and his family (not exceeding the number
of twenty persons) with three horses, and also their clothes, household stuff,
and other goods (not being merchandise) quietly, and safely to take shipping at
any place within the river of Shannon, or at Galloway, or to Pass to Kinsale,
and take shipping there, and from such place of their shipping to be
transported to any parts beyond the seas, (except to England, Wales or
Scotland) without any violence, injury or molestation, as you will answer the
Contrary at your perils. Provided they take shipping, and depart from Irland
within the space of two months after the date hereof, and that in the mean
time they, or any of them do not act any thing to the prejudice of the
Parliament, or Commonwealth of England. Given under my hand, and seal the
seventh day of May, Anno Dom. 1650.

O. CROMWELL.

To all Officers soldiers and others under my command, and to all Captains
and commanders of any of the shipping under the obedience of the Parliament.
Dean Boyles second Letter to my Lord Lieutenant to justify himself concerning
the fore mentioned Pass,
May it please your Excellency.
REflecting upon the present sad Condition of those, who have adhered unto his
Majesty's service, I assumed to my self very much satisfaction (above many
others) in the Clearness of my deportments therein, which hitherto has
always justified me in the opinion of those, who have been entrusted in the
mannagement of his affairs; But I find by some Letters of your Excellencies to
my Lord Inchiquin that I now ly under some hazard of being blasted in your
Excellencies esteem, by a severe charge laid on my discretion, and a greater
wound upon my integrity, as if I had exceeded the limits of my Commission, in
this last, (and I may justly call it unfortunat) transaction: My Lord, my
pretense is so slender to the first of these, that I can very easily digest
any thing, that is objected me on that score, being much more sensible of my
own weakness, then any other man can be, though J cannot yet convince my self
of any sin against the rules of reason: for apprehending When I left your
Excellency, that it was your resolution to depart the Kingdom, and finding the
intentions of the enemy to block up that Harbor, by their shipping, from
whence you purposed your departure, I esteemed it a special piece of
providence for the preservation of your person, and your honor, that they by
an accidental discourse should offer that of themselves, which I suspected you
might have been necessitated to make suite for; As for that clause in the Pass
obligeing you not to act any thing to their disadvantage, during your remainder
here, though I must confess that to be no way suitable to your Excellencies
condition, yet I conceive it may justly excuse my acceptance of it, I not
making it at all my business to seek it, and might therefore appear
impertinent, and indeed injurious to your Excellency to except against it,
which I the rather past over out of an opinion that your Excellency would have
declined the service here, by the time of my return out of their quarters. But
for this particular as it intrencheth only upon (that which I cannot own)
discretion; I submit it wholly to your Excellencies better disquisition, having
this sanctuary at last to be my refuge, that if I have transgressd therein, it
had no other design in it, but your Excellencies preservation, and honor. But
as to the other particular of exceeding, my Commission, I must beseech your
Excellencies leave a little to justify my integrity, the rather in that I look
upon my self out of any Capacity to serve you hereafter, whilst I ly under the
justice of that reproof, dishonesty being an offense which J abhominate
toward the most ordinary person, much more toward your Excellency, who have
laid so many obligations upon me; I had nothing in Charge from your Excellency
in the transaction of that business, but to declare your refusal of comeing to
any conditions with them at all, or of having any inclinations there unto,
which I did oftentimes not privately, or to the meanest of them, but
publicly, to the chiefest amongst them, Cromwell and Ireton. Which I conceive
to he a perfect discharge of what was entrusted to me by your Excellency, and
as for my bare reception of the Pass, as it proceeded not at all from my
demand, so it cannot certainly, without very much severity, be interpreted a
breach of my Commission.

This poor party being very suddenly to be dispersed to their several
destinies, I know not what providence intends me for the future, but for the
present I am like to be necessitated to the same misfortune with them, and by
this great mistake of my essays for their service, to be enforced to desert
the persons whom I honor, and to retire amongst those, who are, and have been
my most professed enemies. I know not when I shall have the opportunity to
wait next upon your Excellency, and have therefore assumed the confidence of
giving your Excellency the trouble of this my just excuse; if it may prevayle
to reestablish me in your Excellencies good opinion, it will afford me many
peaceful thoughts, while I continue in my banishment. However, as I was your
Excellencies most faithful servant, before you placed and of your favors on
me, so no misinterpretation of my actions shall make me a whitt decline my
unalterable resolution of avowing my self.

My Lord, Your Excellencies most obedient and humble servant. M, BOIL.
Cloenraud May 9. 1650.
The Governor of Rosse his Letter to General Preston commanding in Waterford.
My Lord.
HAving had experience of your Lordships honor, and civility, and considering
the condition of the place under your command, what by contagicusnes within
your city, and the sword about it, and the regardles inconfiderablenes of your
party for your releife, induces me to sympathize with your Lordship, J having
now a seasonable opportunity to offer such conditions to your Lordship, as may
befit such a person of honor to accept hereof, and blemishes; and objections
being removed, you have no less presidents then the Lord of Ormond, and the
Lord of Inchiquin; Their Commissioners, and the Lord Lieutenant General
Cromwell for each, and in behalf of both parties have concluded for their
Coming in to the Lord Lieutenant General Cromwell, and to take up arms that
will, others to go beyond seas, with their equipage within two months. This
was confirmd, and ratifyed last Friday at Fetherd. And I would not tell you a
false thing for Rocks of pearl; If you please to be so fortunate to your
self, and family, as to adhere to this offer here enclosed they shall be
confirmd under the Lord Cromwells hand, and seal, upon the capitulation, and
agreement betwixt your Lordship, and my self, for the surrender of the City
to the use of the state of England; If you please, I shall meet you for a
personal treaty, where you shall appoint for better satisfaction, and during
our meeting, or going from it, no acts of hostility to be committed on either
side, of which I assure to your Lordship if your Lordship promise the like to
me; And for the Citizens they shall have the same conditions, as Rosse had,
which is now a Flourishing place. In tenderness to your Lordship, and the City,
that both may be preserved, and in a happy condition, I did prevayle to make
these overtures, and negotiation, desiring your Lordships answer I remain.

My Lord, Your Lordships humble servant. D, AXTEL.
Rosse April 30. 1650.
Dean Boyles Letter to Cromwell about the Passes he received from him.
My Lord,
I presume your Lordship remembers upon what score the Passes for the Lord
Lieutenant, and Lord Inchiquin were received by me from your Lordship upon a
suspicion I had there might fall out some unhandsome carriage toward them, upon
the departure of these English out of the quarters; which opportunity of
serving them, I was not very unwilling to embrace, conceiving it an honorable
expedient for their security, in case they should be necessitated thereunto.
But I find His Excellency it not at all satisfied with me therein, I having no
Commission to that purpose, and upon intimation sent his Lordship that I had
such a thing, he commanded me to return it with civility to your Lordship; But
finding by the Copy of a Letter to the Governor of Waterford (which I here
enclose) that there is some use endeavored to be made thereof to his exceeding
prejudice, and dishonor, he has commanded metosend it to himself least the
return of it should be perverted to his prejudice, as the acceptance was; I
have hereby returned your Lordship the Pass for the Lord Inchiquin, and from
both have received very slender thanks for bringing them. Your Lordship knows
I made no engagement for any thing no either of their behalfes, but on the
contrary in the discussion of those proposaIls, which I presented to your
Lordship from the Officers, did declare, that I had positive commands to except
the Lord Marquis of Ormond, and Lord of Iuchiquin, from having any benefit of,
or relation unto any thing, that was comprised in that treaty, so that the
suggestions of M. Axtell to the Governor of Waterford, though they are nothing
a greable to the conditions we received from your Lordship, yet they give a
very great dissatisfaction to many here of my integrity, as presuming me to act
some thing under hand, either by design, or beyond Commission wherein if your
Excellency, would be pleased to afford me the justice of some kind of
vindication, it would extremly oblige me in a very grateful resentiment.

My Lord, Your Excellencies humble servant. M. BOIL.
Cloneraud May 3. 1656.
My Lord Lieutenants Letter to Cromwell when he sent him Back his Pass.
SR.
DEan Boil having brought me a Paper signed, and sealed by you, seeming to be
a Pass for me to transport my self beyond seas; I did much wonder from
whence, or for what reason it was, that you either gave, or he accepted it;
since he was directed to declare to you (if it came in question) that I had no
intention to treat with you for a Pass, or any other thing; And though I am
yet to seek a reason for his part of that transaction, yet yours appears to me
in Axtells Letter to General Preston; I have by this Trumpetter returned you
your Paper, and for your unsought courtesy do assure you, that when you shall
desire a Pass from me, and I think fit to grant it, I shall not make use of
it to corrupt any that commands under you, I remain.

Your humble servant. ORMONDE.
Kogh reogh the 17, May 1650.
The Speech of his Excellency the Marquis of Ormond unto the General Assembly
of the confederates in Irland upon the signing of the peace, in answer to the
Oration of Sr. Richard Blake Chairman of the Assembly. Mentioned. PAGE 55.
My Lords and Gentlemen.
I Shall not speak to those expressions of duty and Loyalty, so eloquently
digested into a Discourse, by the Gentleman appointed by you to deliver your
sense, you will presently have in your hands greater and more solid Arguments
of His Majesty's gracious acceptance of them, then I can enumerate, or then
perhaps, you your selves discern, for, besides the provision made against your
remotest fears of the severity of certain Laws, and besides many other
freedoms, and bounties conveyed to you, and your posterity, by these
Articles, There is a door, and that a large one, not left, but set open to
give you entrance, by your future merits, to whatsoever of honor, or other
advantage, you can reasonably wish, so that you have in present fruition what
may abundantly satisfye, and yet there are no bounds set to your hopes but you
are rather invited, or, (according to a new Phrase, but to an old and better
purpose) You seem to have a Call from Heaven, to exercise your Arms and
uttermost fortitude, in the noblest, and justest Cause the world has known;
for let all the Circumstances, incident to a great and good Cause of war, be
examined, and they will befound Comprehended in that which you are now called
warrantably to defend; Religion, not in the narrow circumscribed definition of
it, under this, or that late found out distinction, but Christian Religion, is
our Quarrel, which certainly is as much and as fatally struck at (I may say
more) by the blasphemous License of this Age, then ever it was by the rudest
Incursions of the most barbarous and most avowed Enemies to Christianity. The
venerable Laws, and fundamental Constitutions are trodden under impious, and,
for the most, part Mechanique feet. Judge reader if these be the words of one
that intends to betray the Kingdom and Kings interest to Cromwell.
The sacred person of the King (the life of those Laws) under an ignominious
imprisonment, and his life threatened to be taken away by the Sacrilegious hands
of the basest of the People that owe Him obediences, And, to endeare the
Quarrel to you, the fountain of all the benefits you have but now
acknowledged, and of what you may further hope for by this Peace, and your own
merits, is now in danger to be obstructed by the execrable murder of the
worthjest Prince that ever ruld these Islands. In short, Hell can add nothing
to the desperate Mischeife now openly projected.

And now judge, if a greater, or a more glorious field was ever set open to
action; and then prepare yourselves to enter into it, And receive these few
Advices from one thoroughly embarked with you in the Adventure.

First. Let me recommend unto you, that to this, as to all other holy Actions,
you would prepare yourselves with perfect Charity, a Charity that may
obliterate whatsoever Are not here the factions.
of Rancours a long continued Civil war may have contracted in you against
any that shall now cooperate with you in so blessed a work, and let his
engagement with you, (who ever he is) be, as it ought to be, a Bond of Unity,
of Love, of Concord, stronger then the nearest tie of nature.

In the next place, mark, and beware of those that shall go about to renew,
or create Iealousies.
Iealousies in you, under what pretense, soever, and account such as infernal
Ministers, employed to promote the black Design on foot, to subvert Monarchy,
and to make us all slaves to those that are so to their own avaritious Lusts.

Away, as soon and as much as possibly may be, with those distinctions And
national animosities fore seen and forelold that since have ruind all.
of Nations, and of Partys, which are the feilds where in the seed of those
Rankor weeds are sown by the great Enemy of our Peace.

In the last place, Let us all divest ourselves of that preposterous, that
ridiculous Ambition, and self Interest, which rather leads to our threatened
general Ruin, then to the enjoyment of Advantages unseasonably desired.

And if at any time you shall think yourselves pincht to near the bone by
those Taxes, and Leavyes that may be imposed on you for your defense, Consider
then, how vain, how foolish a thing it will be, to starve a Righteous Cause
for want of necessary support; to preserve yourselves fat and gilded
sacrificies to the rapine of a merciless Enemy.

And if we come thus well prepared to a Contention, so just, on our part, God
will either bless our Endeavors with success and victory, or Were there ever
nobler or more generous expressions of loyalty then these.
Crown our sufferings with honor, and patience; for what honor will it not
be, if God have so determined of us) to perishwith a long glorious Monarchy?
And who can want patience The people of Irland have found the truth of this by
a lamentable experience.
to suffer with oppressed Princes? But as our Endeavors, so let our prayers be,
vigorous, that they may be delivered from a more unnatural Rebellion then is
mentioned by any story, now raised to the highest pitch of success against
them.

I should now say something to you for my self, in return to the advantageous
mention made of me, Or greater modesty.
and my Endeavors to bring this settlement to pass; but I confess my
thoughts were wholly taken up with those much greater Concernements; Let it
suffice, that as I wish to be continued in your good esteem and affection, so
I shall freely adventure upon any hazard, and esteem no trouble a difficulty
too great to encounter, if I may manifest my zeal to this Cause, and discharge
some part of the obligations that are upon me to serve this Kingdom.
