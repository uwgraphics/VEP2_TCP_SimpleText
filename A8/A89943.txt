A NEW BALLADE, To an Old Tune. Tom of Bedlam.
MAke room for an honest Red-coat,
(And that you'^l says a wonder)
The Gun, and the Blade,
Are his Tools, -- and his Trade,
Is for Pay, to Kill, and Plunder.
Then away with the Laws,
And the Good old Cause,
Never talk of the Rump, or the Charter,
It Is the Cash does the Feat,
All the rest 's but a Cheat,
Without That there is no Faith, nor Quarter.
It Is the Mark of our Coin, GOD WITH US,
And the Grace of the Lord goes along with it,
When the Georges are flown,
Then the Cause goes down,
For the Lord is departed from it.
Then away, etc.
For Rome, or for Geneva,
For the Table, or the Altar,
This spawn of a Vote,
He cares not a Groat --
For the Pence, he is your Dog in a Halter.
Then away, etc.
Though the Name of King, or Bishop,
to Nostrils pure may be Loathsome,
Yet many there are,
That agree with the May^r,
That their lands are wondrous toothsom.
Then away, etc.
When our Masters are Poor, we Leave 'em,
It Is the Golden Calf we bow too:
We Kill, and we slay,
Not for Conscience, but Pay;
Give us That, we'll fight for you too.
Then away, etc.
'Twas That first turned the King out;
The Lords, next: then, the Commons:
'Twas that kept up Noll,
Till the Devil fetched his Soul;
And then it set the Bum on's.
Then away, etc.
Drunken Dick was a Lame Protector,
And Fleetwood a Backslider:
These we served as the rest,
But the City's the Beast
That will never cast her Rider.
Then away, etc.
When the Mayor holds the Stirrup,
And the Shreeves cry, God save your Honors:
Then, it is but a Jump,
And up goes the Rump.
That will spur to the Devil upon us.
Then away, etc.
And now for fling at your Thimbles,
Your Bodkins, Rings, and Whistles,
In truck for your Toys,
We'll fit you with Boys:
('It Is the Doctrine of To the Butchers wife.
Hugh's Epistles.)
Then away, etc.
When your Plate is gone, and your Jewels,
You must be next entreated,
To part with your Bags,
And strip you to Rags,
And yet not think you are cheated.
Then away, etc.
The truth is, the Town deserves it;
It Is a Brainless, Heartless Monster:
At a Clubb they may Bawl,
Or Declare at their Hall,
And yet at a Push not one stir.
Then away, etc.
Sir Arthur vowed he will treat 'em,
Far worse than the men of Chester:
He Is Bold, now they are Cowed,
But he was nothing so Loud
When he lay in the ditch at Lester.
Then away, etc.
The Lord has left John Lambert,
And the Spirit, Feak's Anointed,
But why oh Lord,
Have thou sheathed thy Sword?
Lo, thy Saints are disappointed.
Then away, etc.
Though Sir Henry be departed:
Sir John makes good the place now,
And to help out the work
Of the Glorious Kirk,
Our Brethren march apace too.
Then away, etc.
While Divines, and Statesmen wrangle,
Let the Rump-ridden Nation bite on it,
There are none but we
That are sure to go free,
For the Soldier's still in the right on it:
Then away, etc.
If our Masters w'ont supply us,
With Money, Food and Clothing:
Let the State look to it,
We'll find one that will do it,
Let him Live, -- we'll not damn for nothing.
Then away with the Laws,
And the Good old Cause,
Never talk of the Rump, or the Charter,
It Is the Cash does the feat,
All the rest 's but a Cheat,
Without That their's no Faith, nor Quarter.
FINIS.
