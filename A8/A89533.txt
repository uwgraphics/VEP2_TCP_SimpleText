South-entrance into the Royal Exchange, 1651.

TO THE READER.
IN above twenty years practice as a Notary Public, for Outland and Inland
affairs, which I do yet Exercise at the Royal Exchange in London, I have had
diverse Cases propounded unto me by diverse and sundry Merchants, and others
whom I have from time to time Resolved concerning Bills of Exchange, And now
that I might he helpful in some measure unto others, who do not so well know
the Custom, and that the same may be more generally known for their
Direction, chiefly I have taken this task in hand; And have here briefly given
my Opinion and Advice in the several Cases hereafter mentioned, Directing the
most usual and safest course to be followed in matters of Bills of Exchange,
some Customs of Merchants concerning the same, How to know when any Bills of
Exchange will fall due, What the Exchange of Money will amount unto in Sterling
Money, and some short Directions to keep true Accounts, A public benefit by
the knowledge hereof being desired by

John Marius.

Advice on Bills of Exchange.
EEchange is nothing else, but to give, or take up Money in one town, to have
again, or to restore the value thereof in another town.

Pair, or Money for Money.
PAir (as the French call it) is to equalize the Money of Exchange from one
place to another, according whereunto is found out the profit and loss which
is made in the parcels drawn or remitted: And it is likewise termed delivering
Money Au pair, when there is received in one town just as much money as was
delivered by Exchange in another town, which is done by the loss of time.

How the Exchange is valued.
THe price of Exchange from London, for Antwerpe, Amsterdam, Middelbrough,
Hamburrough, Lile and Rotterdam, is usually accounted or valued on the pound
Starling; the Exchange from London for Paris and Rouen is valued on the French
Crown; the Exchange from London for Venice is valued on the Ducat, And the
Exchange from London for Ligorne is valued on the Doller or piece of Eight.

Hamburrough style.
NOte that in Hamburrough they do write the same style with us here in
England, namely old style: but in all other parts beyond the Seas, generally
they do write new style, which is ten days before us.

Venice and Hamburrough Usances.
NOte also that Usance from Venice to London, is usually three months from the
date of the Bill of Exchange, And the price current from London to Hamburrough
is usually valued at double Usance, or two months after date.

No three Days for acceptance.
WHen any Bill of Exchange is sent unto you from beyond the Seas, to cause to
be accepted, I would advise you to present the Bill as soon as you can to the
party to whom it is directed, and request him to accept the same; if he refuse
to do it, you may presently cause a Protest to be made for non-acceptance: for
there is no three days allowed (by custom of Merchants in London) for
acceptance, but only at time of payment.

24. Hours for acceptance.
BUt if the party to whom the Bill of Exchange is directed, be a Merchant well
known unto you, and that he shall desire time to consider on it, and so shall
desire you to leave the Bill of Exchange with him, and to come to him the next
day, (provided the Post do not go away in the interim) and that then he will
give you an answer, herein he does demand nothing of you but what is usually
allowed: for according to custom of Merchants he may have four and twenty
hours to consider whether he will accept of your Bill or not; But that time
being expired, you may demand of him your Bill of Exchange which you left with
him to be accepted if so he pleased. If he then say that he has not yet
accepted it, and that he would desire you to call some other time (the four
and twenty hours being expired) it is at your choice to stay any longer or
not; And you may then request a Notary to go and demand the Bill of Exchange of
him, accepted or not accepted, and in default of delivery thereof, you may
cause Protest to be made in due form.

But though this may be lawfully don, yet notwithstanding amongst Merchants
which do know one another, they do not usually proceed so strictly, but do
leave their Bills with the parties to whom they are directed, (to be accepted)
sometimes two or three days, if it be not to their prejudice, as namely if the
Post do not depart in the interim; but if the post is to depart within the two
or three days, then it is a very reasonable thing, (and which men that know the
custom will not omit) to demand their Bill, accepted or not accepted, that so
they may give advice thereof by the first Post (after the receipt of their
Letters,) unto their friend beyond the Seas, who sent the Bill, or delivered
the value thereof: for it is to be noted by the way, that advice of the receipt
of Bills of Exchange, and of the acceptance and payment thereof, ought to be
given by the first Post, that thereby the deliverer may know the better how to
govern himself.

Bill drawn on two persons.
IF any Bill of Exchange shall come directed unto two or more persons, in these
terms, to A. and B. Merchants in London, both A. and B. also ought to accept
the same, or else if but one of them do accept it, and the other will not, that
Bill may be protested for want of due acceptance.

But if the bill come directed thus, to A. and B. or to either of them; Or
thus, to A. or in his absence to B. In such case the Bill being accepted by A.
or by B. namely by but one of them, it is sufficient, and may not be Protested
for any want of acceptance, in regard it is accepted according to the tenor of
the bill.

Verbal acceptance.
IF a Bill of Exchange (being presented to be accepted) to the party to whom it
is directed, And he give you an answer thus, Leave your Bill with me and I will
accept it, or thus, call for it to morrow and you shall have it accepted, or
such like words; Such an answer is bynding, and amongst Merchants is taken for
an acceptance of the Bill; And if afterward, he to whom it is directed shall
refuse to set his Name to the Bill, and write under it accepted by me R. as is
usual; The party to whom it is payable may content himself with such an
acceptance if he have sufficient witness thereof,) until the time of payment:
And then if payment be not made by the party so accepting it, the party to whom
it is payable has his course in Law against the party so accepting, provided
the Bill be first Protested for non-payment; And surely such a Verbal
acceptance is good; for upon such an answer given, The party to whom it is
payable, or to whom it was sent to be accepted, may peradventure have written
to his Friend that sent him the Bill, and advised him, that he is promised
acceptance, who will accordingly take notice thereof; And if it were not so,
namely that such a Verbal acceptance were binding, there might happen great
inconveniences in matter of Trade between Merchant and Merchant, where their
word is, or ought to be as their Deed.

Accept for part.
IF the party to whom your Bill is directed say unto you when you present him
the Bill to be accepted; That he will accept it for part, in regard he has no
more provision in his hands from the party for whose account the bill of
Exchange is drawn, or other the like reasons best known to himself; Then you
may take that his acceptance for part, and presently go to a Notary, and
Protest the Bill for want of acceptance for the whole sum therein mentioned,
and send away that your Protest, to have security for the remaining sum; And
so likewise at the time when the Bill shall fall due, you must go and receive
the sum for which it was accepted, and you may make a receipt for the same on
the backside of the said Bill, using these words, Received in part of this
Bill, etc. and then protest again for nonpayment of the remaining sum,
according as you formerly did for non-acceptance.

Note on your Bill the time when it will fall due.
WHen you have presented your Bills of Exchange, and received them accepted,
then presently reckon when they will fall due, and note the same in short on
the backside of your bill close at one end thereof, with the just sum which you
are to receive at the time by the tenor of your bill, to the end that at any
time when you would desire to know what moneys you have to receive, and when,
you may presently see and know the same on the backside of the Bills, which you
will find to be much ease, convenience, and indeed Merchant like.

Keep or return Bills accepted.
YOur Bills thus accepted, if payable to your self, you may lay up by you
until the time of payment be expired, but if payable to him that delivered the
value, or that sent it you to cause to be accepted, then you must therewith
follow his Order either in keeping it by you until the time it be due, or in
returning it back to be Endorsed, and it may be to take up the value thereof
himself, and so assign it to an other, or else deliver it to some other person
here, who may have the second Bill Endorsed payable unto him.

The Deliverer is Master.
FOr you are to know that the party which first delivered the money on the Bill
of Exchange, (if the moneys which he delivered were for his own Account,) is
rightly and properly Master thereof until it shall fall due, and he can
prohibit the party to whom it is directed, not to pay the same at the time,
unto him to whom the Bill is first made payable, (supposing him to be a Factor
for the deliverer) although the party on whom the Bill is drawn, have already
accepted the Bil; which prohibition is called a Countermand, and ought to be
don in due form, and but upon special sure ground. As for Example, if the
Master or Principal do make over moneys by Exchange payable to his Servant or
Factor, and do hear by certain advice given him, that his said Factor does take
ill courses, whereby the moneys and effects which he has in his hands for
account of his Principal may be in danger of being misspent, or wasted; Then
and in such Case the Principal may send his Countermand, forbidding the party
to whom the Bill is directed, not to pay the money to that Factor, but to some
other, or to keep the same in his hands until further Order; Which Countermand
is good and lawful according to custom of Merchants, and ought to be obeyed
accordingly, if the same be notified in due form and time, by a Notary, to the
party which has accepted the Bill, before it be due; but if the time be
expired, and the money orderly paid before the Countermand come to hand, in
such Case there is nothing to be don for prevention of danger, the Bird being
already fled.

Usances.
A Bill of Exchange made payable at Usance, double Usance, or treble Usance, is
to be understood by Usance if from any part beyond the Seas (except Hamborrough
and Venice) one month next after the date of the bill, and the like of double
and treble Usance, two or three months to be accounted still from the date of
the bill; I say Usance is one month next after the date of the bill, let the
month fall out how it will, whether it be a month that has in it 31 Days, 30
Days, or 28 Days, each month is a full and perfect Usance, and you must not
count every 30 Days a Usance, as some imagine, but a month by denomination; As
for instance, A Bill of Exchange dated in Amsterdam the 20th. December new
style; which is the 10th of December old style, will be due the 10th of January
old style; A bill dated the 15th June new style, which is the 5th of June old
style, will be due the 5th of July old style; And a bill dated the 10th. of
February new style, which is the last of January old style, and made payable at
Usance in London, will be due the last of February old style; and in like
manner is to be accounted from any other date for Usance, double Usance, or
treble Usance.

Days sight.
A Bill payable at so many Days sight, is to be accounted so many Days next
after the said Bill shall be accepted, or else Protested for non-acceptance,
and not from the date of the Bill, nor from the Day that the same came to hand.
And therefore if a Bill so made payable be omitted to be presently Protested
for non-acceptance, all that time between the presenting of the Bill, and the
Protesting thereof, is lost time, and not to be accounted as part of the number
of days mentioned in the Bill of Exchange.

An accepted Bill lost.
IF an accepted Bill of Exchange be lost by the party to whom it is payable,
when the time comes for him to go for the Money, that is to say, when the Bill
is due, the party which had accepted the Bill, is not freed from payment of the
Money, because the Bill is lost. Only thus, the party to whom the Bill was
payable, must give Bond or other Writing to the content of the party that did
accept the Bill, to save him harmless from the accepted Bill which is lost,
and to discharge him from the sum therein mentioned; And then the party that
did accept the Bill ought to pay the same, for otherwise the party to whom it
was payable must send a Notary to make demand of the said sum upon the same
offer of giving Bond to save harmless; And then if payment be refused, the
Notary will make Protest, and the party that accepted the Bill is liable to
make good the damage and cost.

No revoking acceptance.
IT happened one day that a young Merchant though a middle-aged man, came to
me, and told me, he had few hours ago accepted a Bill of Exchange, and
delivered it back to the party to whom it was payable, but that just now he had
received letters of advice, that the party for whose account it was drawn,
namely the drawer of the Bill, was failed of his credit, and therefore the
Accepter would, (if he could) unaccept the Bill, or make void his acceptance
thereof, and desired me to advise him how he ought to do it. To whom I made
answer merrily, Sir, pray go to the party that has your accepted Bill, and
tell him as much as you have told me, (if he know it not already,) and if he
will give you leave to cancel your acceptance of the Bill, (which he ought not
to do) then you may be free from your engagement, but for my part I know no
other way, for if you cannot recall your Word, in such a Case, much less can
you make void your Deed, without mutual consent.

Acceptance for longer Time.
IF a Bill of Exchange be made payable at 30 Days sight, and the party to whom
the said bill is directed will not accept it but at 60 Days sight; Or if the
bill be drawn at double Usance, and the party upon whom the same is drawn will
not accept it but at treble Usance, or the like, that is to say, if the party
upon whom the Bill of Exchange is charged will not accept it to pay according
to the time therein limited, in such Case the party to whom the Bill is made
payable, or his Assigns, must cause Protest to be made for want of acceptance
of the said Bill, according to the tenor thereof, and then he may take the
acceptance offered; or if the Bill of Exchange be left with the party to whom
it is directed, to be accepted, and he do accept it for a longer time, or for a
lesser sum than is mentioned in the said Bill, in either of those Cases the
party unto whom the said Bill is made payable, or his Assigns, must go with
the said Bill of Exchange to a Notary, and cause Protest to be made for want of
acceptance of the said Bill for the whole sum therein mentioned, or according
to the tenor thereof, as aforesaid; And when the bill is due according to the
time therein limited, the party to whom the said bill is payable, or his
Assigns, must demand payment thereof accordingly, and in default thereof a
second Protest must be made for non-payment; And then he may (in sending away
the Protest, but keeping the bill by him) receive the Money for which it is
accepted, or at the time it is accepted at, Unless he have order to the
contrary from the party which did remit the Money, which order he ought to
follow.

Receive part.
ANd if the bill be accepted to pay part of the Money mentioned in the bill,
but not all, or that it be accepted for the whole sum, but when it is due the
whole sum be not paid, then he may receive so much as will be paid thereof, and
may make a receipt on the bill for so much as he has received, in part of
payment thereof, and he must Protest for non-payment of the remaining sum,
according as is already here before declared.

Bill accepted by an other Man.
MOreover, if a Bill of Exchange be drawn on A. and he refuse to accept it, or
if A. be out of Town and have left no Order for acceptance thereof, but C. a
Friend of the Drawers will accept the bill for honor of the Drawer; In either
of these Cases the party to whom the said bill is payable, or his Assign,
ought first to cause Protest to be made for non-acceptance by A. and then he
may take C. his acceptance, for otherwise the Drawer may allege that he did not
draw the bill on C. but on A. and therefore according to custom of Merchants,
diligence ought to be used toward A. first, or else Order and Commission is
broken, and so the damage which may happen will be put upon him that breaks
Commission: for you ought to respect your Friends good as your own.

How to reckon the Time.
A Bill of Exchange dated the second of March, new style, which is the 20th. of
February old style, (except in leap-year) payable at double Usance in London,
will be due the 20th of April old style, and not the 22th of April as some do
erroniously imagine, who would deduct the 10 Days (to reduce the new style to
old style) at the end of the double Usance, and so they would go backwards 10
Days, when of right they should go forwards from the date, and reckon the
double Usance from the very date of the bill, thus, A bill dated the 2 March
new style is the 20th of February old style (February having but 28 days, for
the 20th of February old style, is the second of March new style even to the
very day of the week) so from the 20th of February, to the 20th of March is one
Usance, and from the 20th of March, to the 20th of April there is an other
Usance; And so in like manner if a bill of Exchange be dated the 10th of March
new style, which is the last of February old style, payable at treble Usance,
will be due the last of May in London, and not the 28th of May as some do
imagine, because February has but 28 Days; for you must always count your
Usances from the very date of the bill as I have already said; And I have seen
diverse bills of Exchange which have bin sent from beyond the Seas, wherein the
Drawers have written the old style and new style both, in the date of their
bills, one above an other, thus; Amsterdam adj. 3/13 Feb. 1650/51 Middel. Adj.
15/25 March 1650/51 Adj. 27/6. Mar. 1651. in Liver. Adj. 27/6. Apri. 1651. in
Liver.
and the like, which is very plain and commendable in those that do so write,
thereby to make things plain to the capacity of the weakest, and to avoid any
further disputes thereupon; And I conceive I have herein so clearly evidenced
the truth and reason of my Opinion, that it cannot but convince those that are
of a contrary judgment, of their error and mistake, except they will be
wilfully blind, and then none so blind, or that they can give me any better
reasons for their contrary Opinion, and then I will submit unto them: for all
Bills (as I have said before) that are made payable at Usances must be reckoned
directly from the date of the Bill, which if it be new style and payable in
London, the date must first be found out in the old style, and then count
forward, and you cannot mistake.

Half Usance.
Half Usance is always reckoned fifteen days, neither more nor less,
because there is not any Month in the year which has in it above 31. days,
15. being the half of 30. and the odd day cannot be divided. So that if a
Bill of Exchange dated the 3. February: new style and payable in London at half
Usance; to know when this Bill is due, you must first (as before) look to the
date, and you shall find that the 3. of February new style, is the 24. January
old style; to which add 15. days, and it will fall due at half Usance on the
8. of February following: And if that Bill dated the 3. of February new style
be made payable at Usance and half, count from the 24. January old style, to
the 24. February old style, the Usance, and from thence to the 11. March
(except in leapyear) is 15. days or half Usance, on which 11. March the
Usance and half will expire, and on that day your Bill will be due.

Three days after due.
YOu are to take notice that the day on which any Bill of Exchange does fall
due, is always to be accounted as part of the time limited in the Bill of
Exchange as included therein; So that the day on which any Bill of Exchange
does fall due, does belong to the party which is to make payment thereof; And
three days next after that day are usually allowed in London, for him to whom
it is payable, to procure payment thereof, and for him on whom it is drawn, to
pay it, unless it be a Bill of Exchange drawn from France, and that the French
Post shall happen to depart on the second day after it be due, or that the
third day be a Sunday, or no working day, in any of those Cases the Money must
be paid the second day after the Bill falls due, or else Protest must be then
made for non-payment, that so lawful diligence may be used within the three
days, and that advice thereof may be sent away by the very first Post after the
Bill falls due; for although three days are usually allowed after a Bill is
due, yet it is with this proviso, that the same be not to the prejudice of him
to whom the Bill is payable, or of his correspondent, or the Drawer; for if the
Protest be not made within the three Days next after the Bill falls due, and
that there should happen in the interim any misfortune to the party on whom the
Bill is drawn, that he should be non-solvent, or the like, those in France
concerned therein will sooner take advantage thereupon, than they will do who
take up Moneys by Exchange in Holland, or other parts; How ever this is a
general rule, namely, that according to custom of Merchants in London the
Protest ought to be sent away by the first Post next after the Bill falls due,
be it for what place soever.

Protest must be made though the three Days are expired.
BUt if Protest for non-payment be not made within the three Days after a Bill
of Exchange falls due, and that through negligence, or otherwise, it be forborne
four, five, six, or more Days after the time limited in the Bill of Exchange,
yet nevertheless even then it must be Protested for non-payment, although the
three Days are expired; for you cannot take any course in Law against the party
which has accepted the Bill, until you have made a legal demand of the Money
by a public Notary; Neither is the party that drew the Bill bound (according
to custom of Merchants) to repay the same unto him of whom he has received
the value, until such time as there does appear a Protest made for
non-payment, to prove that the party who accepted the Bill, or on whom it was
drawn, has not paid the Money; But I would never counsel any body to omit
Protesting a Bill of Exchange the third Day after it is due; for if it be not
Protested before the three Days are expired, and the party which has accepted
it shall then happen to be non-solvent, as I said before, It may be alleged
that the party to whom it was payable has neglected his diligence therein, and
the party that drew the Bill (especially if it be a French Bill, that is to
say, a Bill made in France) may happen to delay the repayment thereof upon that
account; for although the Drawer is bound to the Deliverer until the bill be
satisfied, yet Protest ought to be made in due time, that so he may not suffer
through neglect of the party to whom it is payable. It is good to deal
securely, there is no danger at all in Protesting within the three Days after a
bill of Exchange is due, but there may be danger in forbearing to Protest
within that time. Wherefore my advice is (let the party upon whom the bill is
drawn, be never so good a man) if he do not pay within the time accustomed,
cause the bill presently to be Protested for non-payment.

Bill payable at a prefixed Day.
A Bill of Exchange made beyond the Seas, where they usually write new style,
which is ten Days before our English style, being old style; And such a bill
being payable on such or such a Day, of such or such a Month, that very Day of
the Month according to our style must be expired before the bill will be due,
and it is not to be understood on such or such a Day new style (except
particularly expressed) but old style, according to the style of the place
where it is made payable; As for instance, if a bill of Exchange be made thus,

Laus deo in Amsterdam the 20th of March, 1651. 200 l. Sterling.
ON the first of May next, pay by this my first Bill of Exchange unto A. B. or
his Assigns, the sum of two hundred pounds Sterling for the value received of
C. D. and put it to account as Per advice.

To M. G. H. Merchant in London.
Yours, C.F.

THis Bill of Exchange is not due until the first of May English style, and it
is not to be accounted due (as some would have it) on the 21 April our style,
which is the first of May new style, for it relates to the style of the place,
where it is made apyable, and not to the computation of the place where it is
drawn; for suppose now A. B. should demand payment of this Bill on the 22, 23,
or 24 of April old style, and G. H. should answer that he would pay it, after
the first of May our style when due according to the tenor of the Bill, and
not before, I would feign know how any Notary can make a legal Protest for
non-payment before the first of May old style be expired; for if he dates his
Protest for non-payment before the first of May old style, according to the
computation of the place where it is payable, he will make his Protest bear
date before the bill is due, and so will be illegally made, as does evidently
appear.

Acceptance by Wife, or Servant.
A Man's Wife, or Friend, or Servant, cannot accept a Bill of Exchange for an
other man, without sufficient authority from him by Letter of Attorney for the
doing thereof: for it is against reason that any man should be bound to the
payment of any sum without his own consent; And that to be made appear under
his Hand and Seal.

A Bill drawn on one place, and payable at an other.
IF a Bill of Exchange be drawn upon a man living at one place, and payable to
a man living at an other place, the Bill may be sent to the place where the man
lives, to accept thereof, and so returned to the party to whom it is payable,
who when it is due must enquire for payment at the house, or in the place where
it is payable, and in default thereof he must there cause Protest to be made in
due form. As for instance, if a Bill be directed to A. B. Merchant at
Southampton, and payable to S. E. or Assigns in London, this Bill may be sent
down to Southhampton to some Friend, to present to A. B. to accept, and upon
his refusal may either Protest at Southampton for non-acceptance, or else may
return his answer of refusal by Letter to London, upon which Protest may be
there drawn up; And when the Bill is due, you must then only endeavor the
payment at London, according to the tenor of the Bill, and if no order be
there given for payment, you must cause Protest for non-payment to be made in
London, as accustomed.

The Taker bound to the Deliverer, and the Acceptor bound to the party to whom
payable.
YOu are to take notice, That in all Bills of Exchange, the party that draws or
under-writes the Bill, is bound to the Deliverer, or to the party of whom the
value was received; And the Acceptor, or party that does accept the Bill, is
bound to the party to whom the Bill is made payable: for although as well the
Taker (or Drawer of the Bill) and also the Acceptor, are both bound in the
Bill, yet they are not both bound to one man; So that if there be occasion to
commence a suit in Law against the Drawer, it must be entered in the name of the
Deliverer; And in like manner if a suit be commenced against the Acceptor, it
must be prosecuted in the name of the party to whom the Bill is made payable;
for the party (happily) that draws the Bill takes no great notice to whom it
is made payable (he being thereunto directed usually by the party that does
deliver him the value.) Neither does the party which accepts the Bill take much
cognizance of the party that did deliver the value, but only of the party that
drew it, and of him to whom it is payable.

Better Security.
IF a Merchant which has accepted a Bill of Exchange, shall happen to be
non-solvent, or publikly reported to be failed of his credit, and to absent
himself from the Exchange, in the interim before the Bill of Exchange by him
accepted be due; you must then presently cause Protest to be made for want of
better security, and to be sent away by the next Post, that so security may be
given by the party which drew the Bill; And when the Bill is due, you must
Protest again for non-payment.

Protest in the Daytime.
IF you have occasion to make Protest on any Bill of Exchange, either for
non-payment, non-acceptance, or better security, be sure still to cause the
same to be made in the Daytime, namely any time of the Day between Sunrising
and Sunsetting, but tarry not to the last hour if you may do otherwise.

Protest returned.
WHen any Protest is returned unto you for non acceptance, or for better
security, you must presently repair with the Protest to the party to whom you
delivered your Money, and he is thereupon to give you security to your content,
and therein the custom is, that the Drawer must procure an able man, a friend
of his, to underwrite the Protest, in these, or the like words. I here
underwritten do bind my self as principal, according to custom of
Merchants, for the sum of Money mentioned in the Bill of Exchange, whereupon
this Protest is made.

London, this Per me, A. B.

Bill of Exchange lost, left to be accepted.
IF a Bill of Exchange be left with a man to be accepted, and he happen to
have lost the Bill, or that it be misdelivered, that is to say, delivered by
him, or any of his Servants, to a wrong party, or in any case that the party
which left the Bill to be accepted cannot have his bill redelivered unto him,
accepted, or not accepted, according to custom; In this case the party that
lost the bill, namely he on whom it was drawn, ought (if he intended to accept
the bill, or had accepted it) to give a note under his Hand and Seal for the
payment of the Money to the party to whom it is payable, or to his Assigns, at
the time limited in the bill, upon the second bill, if it come to hand within
the time, or else upon that note at the same time. And in case the party that
lost the bill do refuse so to do, He that presented him the bill to be accepted
must cause Protest thereupon to be made in due form; And in case there be such
a Note made, and that at the time limited the second bill shall not be come to
hand, you must endeavor the receipt of the Money upon that Note, according to
the contents thereof, and in default of payment you must Protest upon that Note
for non-payment, as if you had the accepted bill, or the second bill come to
hand, and not paid at the the time.

Bill indorsed in blanke.
IF a bill of Exchange be made payable to one beyound the Seas, and he
subscribe only his Name on the backside thereof, leaving an empty place above
his Name, and do so send it over to a Merchant to receive the Money of the
party on whom it is drawn, (as it is usual so to do) in this case when the
party shall go for the money when the Bill is due, he may either receive the
Money himself, or send his man for it; if he go himself, he may either make an
assignment in the empty place above the Name on the backside of the Bill, to
himself, and then a receipt underneath in his own Name for so much Money
received, or else a receipt in the empty place above the Name; And if he send
his man with the Bill to receive the Money, the man may upon receipt of the
Money either deliver up the Bill as it is without writing any thing upon it, or
else fill up the empty place with an assignment payable to his Master, and then
make a receipt underneath for so much Money received in full of that Bill for
his Masters use, according as the party that shall pay the Bill shall direct,
for either way is good and warrantable according to the custom of Merchants
used in London.

Accept for Account of Drawer.
IF a Bill of Exchange be drawn by A. on B. for account of C. and B. will not
accept the bill for account of C. but would willingly do it for account of A.
the Drawer; In this case B. may so accept the same, but he must first come, and
declare so much before a Notary public, who must make an Act thereof to be
sent away by B. unto A. that so he may have speedy advice thereof, and then he
may accept the bill, for account of A. and according to custom of Merchants,
A. is bound to make the same good again unto B. with Exchange and re-exchange
and costs; But B. must be sure to make such his Declaration before he do accept
the bill, for otherwise if he should first accept it, and then that it might be
lawful for him at any time afterward to alter the property thereof, and
charge it for account of the Drawer at the Acceptors pleasure, the Drawer might
be much prejudiced as in relation to C. by whose order (it may be,) and for
whose account A. drew the same bill.

Bill paid upon Protest.
IF a bill of Exchange be drawn upon a Merchant here in London, and he refuse
to pay it, and thereupon Protest being made, an other Merchant do appear, and
declare before a Notary that he will pay it for honor of the Drawer upon
protest, and accordingly does pay the same, and cause an Act to be thereupon
made; My advice is that he take a receipt for the Money upon the Protest, and
not upon the Bill, that so he may still keep the Bill free, as not being
satisfied by those whom it particularly did concern; And let him return the
Protest and Act, with receipt thereupon, but keep the accepted Bill here to be
ready upon all occasions.

Put Bill in Letter Case, or Almanac.
IN regard Bills of Exchange are writ upon small pieces of Paper, which are
subject to belost, especially if you carry them about you, therefore I would
advise you for prevention thereof to keep a letter Case, or (which is better) a
pocket Almanac, or small pocket Paper-booke with Clasps, and carry your Bills
of Exchange in such a book, that so they may be kept clean and whole, and less
subject to be lost.

Inland Bills may be Protested as well as Outland Bills, they being both of one
and the same kind.

Bill must not be paid before due.
IF a Bill of Exchange be made payable at Usance, double Usance, or at any
longer, or shorter time, and when the Bill shall be presented to the party on
whom it is drawn, to be accepted, he to whom it is Payable shall desire to have
the Money paid him (by way of anticipation) before it be due by the tenor of
the Bill, and shall offer to rebate for the time, or that the party to whom the
said Bill is directed, shall offer him to whom it is made payable, to pay him
the Money presently before the time in the bill be expired (upon discount, or
in allowing him something for the time,) The party which shall so pay any Money
upon any bill of Exchange before the time, does run in some danger, in not
observing order; for if the Money remitted be properly the Parties which
delivered the same to the Subscriber of the bill, and made payable to a Factor
for the use of the Deliverer, and that he should (before the bill is due,) send
a Countermand, not to pay it to the party to whom it was payable by the tenor
of the bill, but to some other; In this Case, he on whom the bill is drawn
ought to be liable to the payment thereof accordingly; for as it is not
properly in his power to prolong the time of payment, neither can he
warrantably shorten it, or agree with the party to whom it is payable, to pay
the Money before it be due (Although this Case does not ordinarily happen, yet
I have known it come to pass, and the like may be again;) Wherefore, I would
never advise any to pay Money on bills of Exchange before it be due.

Second Bill with an Assignment.
IF a Second Bill of Exchange be sent unto you from the party to whom it is
payable, with an assignment on the backside thereof to pay unto your self; You
must present the same to be accepted (unless you have the first bill already
accepted.) If the party on whom it is drawn do refuse to accept the second
bill, pretending that he has formerly accepted the first bill, to an other
man, unknown, and if you cannot be actually possessed of that first accepted
bill, you ought to cause Protest to be made for non-acceptance of that second
Bill, that so upon sending away the Protest, security may be given to your
Friend beyond the Seas that the Money shall be paid unto you at the time, for,
the party to whom the bill is directed, is not bound by the bill to the payment
of the Money, until he do accept of the bill of Exchange according to custom of
Merchants; for although as well the Subscriber of the bill of Exchange, as the
party which does underwrite the assignment for the value received, and likewise
the Acceptor of the bill are all of them bound in the bill of Exchange, yet
they are not all immediately bound either to the Deliverer, or to the party to
whom it is payable, but each party is bound to the other with whom he does more
immediately correspond, as I have more particularly here before declared.

Party dead which accepted.
IF the party to whom your bill of Exchange is directed, do accept the Bill,
and in case he shall afterward happen to decease, and depart this life before
your bill is due, you must at the appointed time of payment, demand the Money of
his Executors, or Administrators, at his mortuary House, or last dwelling
House, and upon their refusal, or delay of payment, you must Protest in the
same manner as you would have done, if he had lived, and not paid at the time.

Party dead to whom payable.
IF the party to whom a bill of Exchange is payable be dead at the time when it
falls due, and that his Executor or Administrator have not yet proved the Will,
or taken out Letters of Administration, yet nevertheless you must not omit to
make demand of the Money at the just time limited, and if you offer security
to save harmless against the Executors, and Administrators, and that it be
refused, you must Protest for non-payment.

Bill without an assignment.
IN like manner if you have a bill of Exchange sent unto you to get to be
accepted, payable to an other man, And (the bill being accepted and due) you
have not an assignement on the Bill from the party to whom it is payable
according to custom of Merchants, you must make demand of the Money, with offer
to give security to save harmless against the party to whom the same is
payable, and all others, and if your proffer be refused, you must Protest for
non-payment.

No such man to be found.
IF your Bill of Exchange be directed to N. Merchant in London, and that you
shall have enquired on the Exchange, and other parts of the City for such a
Merchant, and shall not be able to find him out or, that indeed there be not
any such man of that Name in London, you must carry your Bill to a Notary
publik, and he must Protest thereupon in due form.

No body at home.
IF when a Bill of Exchange is sent you to get accepted, and there be no body
at home at the House of the party on whom it is drawn, you may cause Protest to
be made at his dwelling house in his absence, as well as presence: for you
cannot be bound to make the party on whom it is drawn to abide at home, but in
reason he is bound to attend his own business.

No avoiding a Protest.
ANd the truth is, if no protest could be made legally, but in speaking to the
party himself, a Protest might be prevented at pleasure; but it lies not in the
power of the party on whom a bil is drawn, to hinder the protesting of the
bill, if not accepted, and paid according to the tenor thereof.

How to bring French Crowns into Starling Money.
IF you have a Bill of Exchange sent you from France to be received in London,
and your Bill be remitted to pay so many Crowns, at such or such a price, as
it is usually so to do, To know how much you must receive here in Sterling
Money, you must first bring your French Crowns into Pence Sterling, at the
price or rate set down in your Bill, and then bring your pence into pounds, and
you will have your desire. As for example, If your Bill be drawn to pay 250
Crowns at 56 d per Crown, first multiply the 250. Crowns by 56d. and it will
make 14000 pence, whereunto add for the, 62 d (because 62 is the part of 250.)
and it will make 14062 d Sterling, and divide the 14062 by 240d (because 240d
makes a pound Sterling) and it will make 58l. Ster. and there will remain 142d.
which divide by 12d. and it will make 11s and there will remain 10d, then add
the d remaining of your multiplication, and it will be together 58-11-10, as
for Example, 250 56 1 1 1500 244 20 1250 14062 (58. 142 (11.10 -- 62 2440 l. s.
d 122 14062 2 58-11-10 1

BY the same* Rule you may reduce Duccats, Dollers, or Pieces of Eight into
Sterling Money, when you know how many pence Sterling the Duccat, Doller, or
Piece of Eight is valued at for the Exchange thereof.

in two parts, namely, first the Goods must be made Debtor for the whole sum,
and the person of who^ they are bought creditor: secondly, as much as is paid
in ready Money you must make the Person Debtor, and Cash Creditor.

8. Goods sold one part for ready Money, and the rest at Time.

Goods sold one part for ready Money, the rest at Time, first you must make the

must make the cash Debtor for so much as you receive in ready Money, and the
Person Creditor for the rest.

9. Money paid for goods before it is due.

When you have bought any goods at Time, and afterward you agree with the
person which sold you the goods to pay your Money before it is due, with
rebating, or discount, then you must make the Person Debtor as follows, viz.
to Cash for so much as you pay him; And to Profit and Loss for the rebatement
of allowance for the discount.

10. Goods sold in barter for others.

When you sell goods in barter for others, then you must make the Goods which
you receive Debtor to the Goods which you delivered.

IN the first Column of of this Table I have put the New style, (or the Roman
Account which is all one) in regard it is 10 Days before ours, and the English
Account, or Old style in the second Column, and so again the New style in the
third Column, and our English style in the fourth, and so forwards; every other
Column which has the Month named at the topp thereof is New style, and those
Columns which have not the Months writ on the topp, are Old style; And by this
Table it appears that the 1. January New style, is the 22 December Old style,
The 1. March New style (except in leap year) is the 19. of February Old style,
and so of the rest, which in regard it is (as I conceive) so plainly set down,
I shall forbear any farther explanation.
