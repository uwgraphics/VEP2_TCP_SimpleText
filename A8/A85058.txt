By his Excellency the Lord GENERAL.
WHereas Complaints have been made, that diverse soldiers most unconscionably
have broken into men's Gardens, Orchards, and grounds in the Counties of
Middlesex, Surrey, Kent, and have thence stolen great store of fruit, Turnipps,
and other Roots, which if not prevented, will endanger the undoing of many
Gardiners, and for time to come obstruct their industry in Planting and sowing
of Roots and other provisions, which have heretofore afforded great relief,
especially to the poor. These are therefore to require all soldiers after
Publication hereof, that they presume not to enter the grounds of any Gardener,
or thence carry away any their Roots, or other goods, as they will answer the
contrary at a Court Martial. And all Officers upon notice given of any Offender
or offenders herein, are forthwith to take a sufficient guard with them, and
apprehend such soldiers, and them deliver to the Martial General to answer
their offenses.

Given under my hand and Seal, the 24. of July 1649. To be Proclaimed by beat
of Drum in London, Westminster, and Southwark. T. Fairfax.
