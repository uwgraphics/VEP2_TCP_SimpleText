By the Protector. A PROCLAMATION Signifying His HIGHNESS Pleasure, That all
men being in Office of Government, at the decease of his most dear Father,
OLIVER late Lord Protector, shall so continue till His HIGHNESS further
Direction.
WHereas it has pleased the most wise God in his providence to take out of
this world the most Serene and Renowned Oliver late Lord Protector of this
Commonwealth, the most dear and beloved Father of His Highness Richard now Lord
Protector, by whose decease the Authority and Power of the most part of the
Offices and Places of Jurisdiction and Government within these Nations did
cease and fail, the Sovereign Person failing from whom the same was derived:
And thereupon through doubtfulness or want of Authority in such persons as were
Invested in the said Offices and Places, the settled and ordinary course of
Justice, and of the Affairs of State (if remedy be not provided) might receive
disturbance and prejudice by discontinuance and interruption; His Highness the
Lord Protector in his Princely Wisdom and Care of the State (reserving to his
own Judgment hereafter, the Reformation and Redress of any Abuses in
Mis-government, upon due knowledge and Examination thereof) is pleased, and
has so expressly signified by and with the Advice of the Council, That all
Persons that at the time of the decease of His late Highness his dearly beloved
Father were duly and lawfully Possessed of, or Invested in any Office or Place
of Authority or Government either Civil or Martial w^thin these Nations or any
other the Dominions or Territories thereunto belonging, And namely, all Judges,
Justices, Sheriffs, Justices of Peace, and all others in Place of Government,
either Meaner or Superior as aforesaid; And all other Officers and Ministers
whose Interests and Estates in their Offices are determined or ceased by the
means aforementioned, shall be, and shall hold themselves continued in the said
Places and Offices as formerly they held and enjoyed the same, until His
Highness pleasure be further known.

And that in the mean while, for the preservation of the Peace and necessary
Proceedings in matters of Justice, and for the safety and service of the State,
all the said Persons of whatsoever degree or condition, every one severally
according to his Place, Office or Charge, do proceed in the performance and
execution of all Duties thereunto belonging as formerly appertained unto them
and every of them while His late Highness was living.

And further His Highness does hereby Will and Command all and singular the
good People of this Commonwealth, of what Estate, Dignity or Degree they or any
of them be, to be aiding, helping, assisting, and at the Commandment of the
said Officers and Ministers, in the performance and execution of the said
Offices and Places, as they and every of them tender His Highness pleasure, and
will answer for the contrary at their utmost perils.

And further His Highness Will and Pleasure and express Commandment is, That
all Orders and Directions made or given by the Lords of the Privy Council in
the lifetime of His late Highness, shall be obeyed and performed by all and
every Person and Persons, and all and every thing and things to be done
thereupon, shall proceed as fully and amply, as the same should have been
obeyed or done in the life of the late Lord Protector, His Highnesses most dear
and entirely beloved Father.

Given at White Hall this Fourth of September, in the year of our Lord God, One
thousand six hundred fifty and eight.
