AN ACT For the Observation of a Day of Public Fasting and Humiliation.
THe Parliament acknowledging from the bottom of their Hearts the abundant
Mercies of their good God continually heaped upon this Nation, Notwithstanding
their great Unworthiness and unproportionable Returns of Thanks in their Lives
and Actions; And being sensible withal of those new Dangers which this Nation
seems to be threatened with, and has most justly Deserved, Have thought fit to
have recourse to the same God by public Humiliation and Prayer, for averting
his Judgments, and removing those Sins which otherwise may call for those
Judgments, and for obtaining a Blessing upon the Councels and Forces of this
Commonwealth both by Sea and Land: Be it therefore Enacted by this present
Parliament, and by Authority thereof, That a day of solemn Fasting and
Humiliation be set apart to be observed on Wednesday the Ninth of June, One
thousand six hundred fifty two, in the Cities of London and Westminster, and
within the late Lines of Communication and weekly Bills of Mortality; and upon
Wednesday the Thirtieth of June following, in all other Cities, Towns and
places within England, Wales, and the Town of Berwick upon Tweed: And that the
Ministers of the respective Parishes and places aforesaid, be and hereby are
required and enjoined to give notice hereof on the Lord's Day next preceding the
day so to be observed: To the end the people may more diligently attend the
public Exercises of Gods Worship and Service on that Day; And for the better
observation thereof, The Parliament does inhibit and forbid the holding or use
of all Fairs, Markets, and servile Works of men's ordinary Callings on the
respective Days aforesaid: And all Majors, Sheriffs, Justices of Peace,
Constables, and other Officers, be and are hereby enjoined to take special care
of the due Observation of the said Day accordingly.

Friday the Fourth of June, 1652.
ORdered by the Parliament, That this Act be forthwith printed and published.
