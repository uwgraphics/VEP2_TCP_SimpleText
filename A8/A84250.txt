Exceeding Joyful Nevves FROM SCOTLAND.
THe Lords and Commons lately conveneed in Scotland (as in all their former
actions) have declared themselves both truly noble and virtuously religious,
all their aims and ends tending to the preservation of that gordian knot Which
naught but a final dissolution ought to cancel, wherefore finding that the
great and manifold distempers of this Kingdom (occasioned by a malignant party)
must (if not timely prevented) prove dangerous and destructive to the peace of
their own Kingdom, both Kingdoms running an equal hazard, likewise casting an
eye of pity on the distressed estate of bleeding Ireland, to whose succor they
have lent their brotherly assistance, our own Kingdom being so much busied at
home, all that we can do, being little enough, to prevent the active and
malicious designs of those who seek the ruin of the Kingdom. And as to Ireland
they have lent assistance, so now they are resolved to lend us their brotherly
assistance, vowing to venture both their lives and fortunes in the just defense
of the King and Parliament against the malignant party of this Kingdom whose
endeavors, plots and stratagems, power and policy, has always been bent to
ruin both England and Scotland. As may appear in this ensuing discourse, when
Load was made B. of Canterbury, he began to bring into the Church superstitious
Ceremonies here in England, and when his Majesty went into Scotland, Laud
attending on him, he found great fault with the government of the Church,
striving to bring in the same superstitious Ceremonies into their Church, but
finding opposition, he by several stratagems, heaped oppressions on
oppressions, incensing his Majesty against them, striving to maintain that by
force which Justice could not abet to his aid, he summoned all the Papists of
this Kingdom, all the Prelates, all the Projectors and Monopolizers of the
Kingdom, these by their power, and with the money which they had robbed the
King and Subject of, maintained an Army which they carried against Scotland,
adding several oppressions, stealing their cartell, pillaging the houses of
the poor Subjects, to the utter ruin of many poor families, spoiled whole
fields of corn, with many unspeakable sufferings and oppressions, causing the
Kingdom of Scotland to raise an Army for to defend themselves from the
intestine malice of these inveterate enemies: By Gods Providence and
unspeakable mercy they were that year defeated. His Majesty in His gracious
disposition concluding upon certain Articles of Peace, promising them Justice
and an equal hearing and redress of all their grievances, Commissioners was
chosen and sent for England, being arrived, they were put off from time to
time, afterward disgraced, one of them imprisoned, and a greater addition of
their oppressions and miseries.

A 2. Army was rised and brought into the bowels of this Kingdom, New castle
was delivered up, by which means a second Parliament was called, and a new
treaty of Peace concluded, all their grievances was scanned in a parliamentary
way, and the Authors of their grievances was apparently known, some of them
brought to condign punishment, others imprisoned, which were found the
principal Authors, but the manifold oppressions that lay heavy on the Kingdom,
by reason of the many projects and taxes that were granted, and the corruption
of the Laws and Courts of the Kingdom, Both Bishops Courts and others, took up
so much time that before the High Court of Parliament could take order for the
infliction of a just sentence on the chief Authors, and make a strict enquiry
who were their assistants, the aforesaid malignant party had fomented many
lealousies and Fears between his Majesty and his Parliament, making
differences of Prerogative and Privilege, and having failed in their ends in
Scotland, they now began to work the destruction of England.

Having raised a difference thus between his Majesty and Parliament, they
further persuaded his Majesty to withdraw himself from his Majesty, His Person
not being secure during his residence so near them (nay it is apparently
manifest, that to further their plots some of the chief Actors in this design
did come into the City, and encourage the Prentices and others to repair to
Westminster in a tumultuous manner offering affronts to several of his
Majesty's servants, which act of theirs they fathered upon the Parliament,
telling his Majesty that such tumults were encouraged and countenanced by the
Parliament. Having by this means drawn his Majesty from the Parliament, they
framed many scandalous Declarations and Messages, which they sent to the
Parliament, as from his Majesty; by that means busying the Parliament in
framing Answers (which they were forced to do to clear themselves of these
ignominious slanders, which they had cast upon them.) In the mean time they
underhand furnished themselves with provision for war; to be short they caused
his Majesty to levy a war against his Parliament and (as in Scotland) so now
to proclaim them traitors: At the difference that is between the proceedings
of the malignant party in England and Scotland, one was Ecclesicsticall
Ceremonies, the other His Majesty's Prerogative, both being made but as
Instruments by which they cunningly endeavor to ruin both Church, King and
Kingdom.

All which timely weighed, I really believe that there is not one man that is
either master of reason or truly religious, that will be an assistant to these
seditious Shimeons and Eleazars, who delight in naught but rapine and
destruction; surely I must of necessity condemn that man, as guilty of his own
destruction that shall take up arms against himself. And let all the world
Judge what security, he can have that puts his life into their hands.

Let every man consider seriously what oppressions were heaped on this Kingdom
by these Prelates and Projectors, before the beginning of this Parliament, when
their actions were limited by Authority, and they may easily discern how
boundless their actions and oppressions would be, if now they should prevail
and get the Law in their own hands

They that would then without scruple, take half and pretend right to it,
would if they could prevail, seize the whole and give you Law for it, they
having destined Law King and Kingdom to be at their disposal. Therefore let all
men that desire either to enjoy the Protestant profession, or to declare
themselves true subjects to his Majesty, and faithful servants to the
Parliament, take up the resolution of the Lords and Commons in Scotland, my
life for my Religion, King and Country. Let us fight valliantly, our cause is
Just, and doubtless the Lord of Hosts will fight for us, and we shall obtain a
glorious victory.

FINIS.
