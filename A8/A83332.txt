An Ordinance or Declaration of the Lords and Commons assembled in Parliament.
THe Lords and Commons in Parliament having taken into their serious
Consideration the sad condition of the Realm of Ireland, and of what ill
consequence the loss of that Kingdom would be to this, both in respect of
Religion and otherwise; have lately by their Declaration of the sixteen of
June one thousand six hundred forty three, in particulars set forth and
declared unto the world the extreme wants and necessities thereof; And finding
many well-affected persons both Adventurers for Lands in Ireland, and others,
very ready and willing to apply themselves by all good means for to bring that
great good work unto perfection. And forasmuch as the subscriptions upon the
several acts of Parliament heretofore made this Session do not engage a third
part of the Land designed to be applied to that work by those Acts, and the
times in them limited for under-writing being elapsed, and to make up what was
wanting in the former subscriptions, as for to raise considerable sums of
money for maintenance of the Armies there on foot, and relief of the poor
distressed Protestants there, the reducing of those Rebels to their obedience
and settling of the state of that Government in peace again, Have now Ordained
and declared, That whatsoever person and persons, Corporations, and Bodies
Politic, which at any time or times heretofore have subscribed, and p^yd in
any sum or sums of money, for an Adventure of Lands of the said rebels Lands
in Ireland forfeited and to be forfeited, and confiscate, according to all and
every, or any the Act and Acts of Parliament as aforesaid, therefore made and
enacted upon the late Ordinance of Parliament of the thirtieth of January, one
thousand six hundred forty two, made for new loanes and contributions, for the
relief of Ireland, And that shall now again subscribe and pay in to Mr. James
Bunce, Mr. Thomas Foot, Mr. John Kendricke, of London Aldermen, and to Samuel
Avery Esquire, Treasurers appointed for that service, or their Assigns, so
much money as shall amount unto a full fourth part of such sum and sums of
money, as they or any of them have formerly subscribed and paid in upon any the
said former Acts and Ordinance, in manner and form following, viz. One third
part thereof within ten days next after they shall so subscribe, the said
fourth part one other third part within one month then next ensuing, and the
other third part thereof within two months then next and immediately
following, so as the whole adventure is to be paid in within three months; And
the said sum or sums of money now to be thus underwritten and paid in to
the Treasurers aforesaid, as aforesaid, being added to and reckoned up together
with the said sum and sums of money which they have so formerly
underwritten and paid in upon the said Acts and Ordinance or upon both or
either of them shall have a double proportion of Lands for the whole, twice so
much Land as he or they were formerly to have had, by and according to the said
Acts or Ordinance, and Irish measure, viz. every Acre thereof to consist of
eight score Pearches or Poles, and every Perch or Pole to consist of one and
twenty foot; And under the same rents and services, conditions, limitations
and provisions, and in as large and b^n^ficiall manner and form, to all
intents and purposes whatsoever, as in and by the said Acts of Parliament and
Ordinance aforesaid is limited and expressed; And the Acquittance and
Acquittances under the hands of the said treasurers, or any two of them, shall
be sufficient and effectual to enable the said subscribers, and every of them,
their heirs or assigns, to demand, have, and enjoy, the full fruit and
benefit of their said subscriptions, and shall be a good and sufficient
discharge for the receipt of all and every such other payments, sum and
sums of money, as shall be made and brought in by and upon any other
Propositions, ways, or means, for the relief or maintenance of the said Army.

And if any such person or persons, Corporations, or bodies politic, who have
thus formerly adventured, for Lands in Ireland, and shall underwrite, and pay
in any more or other sum or sums of money then the fourth part of his
former adventure shall amount unto; or if any other person or persons as well
of the English, Scottish, or Dutch Nation, under the government of the Lords
and States of the united Provinces, that shall now de novo subscribe and pay in
any sum or sums of money, for Lands, of the Rebels Lands, forfeited and to
be forfeited as aforesaid, shall have a like double proportion of Lands for the
same, to be assigned and set out unto him and them in manner and form in all
things, as the Adventurers aforesaid, in the immediate foregoing Proposition
are to have theirs.
