A CORDIAL Elegy and Epitaph UPON The much l^mented Death of that incomparable
Prince HENRY Duke of Gloucester, Brother to our Sovereign Lord the KING, the
most perfect and accomplished Prince of his years the Christian World could
boast of; And a Royal Cedar endowed with as many great Virtues as mortality
could receive; A Prince of such Fortitude abroad and wisdom at home, vastness
of wit and understanding, that no Prince could parrallel, always steadfast in
Religion, and a Prince who, if we compare his Valor with his Meekness, his
Knowledge with his Innocence, and his Religion with his Youth, no Prince can
equalize; Deceased the 13th of September 1660.



LONDON, Printed for GEORGE HORION, 1660.

A Cordi^ll ELEGY UPON The much lamented death of that most hopeful young
Prince, HENRY Duke of Gloucester, deceased Thursday the 13th of September, 1660.
PArdon O Heavens, just God wherein have we
Transgrest against thy Glorious Majesty,
Were we ungrateful for thy bounty when
Thou gave to us these Princes; we to them
And to a happy State did us restore
From out the bondage we were in before,
O no great God, we from our selves confess
Thy Mercies: Angels be our Witness.
What Cause O Muse? Is God profaned? or why
Sustain we still perpetual misery?
Has Grief no end, and must we ever go
Whilst Earth remains Concomitants with woe.
Was It not enough by Ttaytors Tyranny,
To loose bles't Charles of glorious me nory:
And then to languish so extreme a while,
Dureing the time of their most sad exile:
In boundless misery; but again this loss!
(We could not been redeemed without the Cross)
Proves bitter to our sweetness; Gloucester's gone,
That hopeful Prince, this ages Paragon:
That blessed Image of our Martyred King,
Lop't in the prime of his most happy spring:
So short an age, and with such trouble past,
Concludes his life was but a Winters blast:
So many doleful hours in which he viewed
Rampant Rebellion Rigorously intrude
Upon his Fathers Kingdoms and invest
With Barbarous fu^y our most peaceful rest:
Thus he no sooner having made the earth
More happy by his most Illustrous Birth:
But straight all Hells enraged; each fury sits,
And for distraction bend their Cursed wits,
Envy Dissension, disobedience frames,
And black disloyalty our Realms enflames:
Blood, Monstrous Treason, Murder and debate
With Ravenous Wolves possess our peaceful state:
Since and before ethe Murder of our KING,
His life is a continual suffering:
Which yet with more than manly fortitude
He bore, nor suffered horror to entrude
Upon his Valiant soul; his Royal breast
Was ever filled with glory that expressed:
He was the Race of Heaven; and soared as high
Upon the wings of pleased Alacrity:
But now! O when the Heavens most sacred Grace
Had smoothed the terror of his dreadful face
To pleasing smiles converts his angry frowns,
Our bleeding Kingdoms mercifully Crowns
With sweet Tranquillity blessed Henry he
Comes only and surveys our vanity:
And back to Heaven retyres whence first he came
To bless the world with his Illustrious name:
Like to a Moses he became our guide,
He brought us to our Canaan, and then died:
But stay me thinks I hear a voice from Hell,
Adamn'd Phantique Thunders forth a Spell;
Long since condemned the Eternalls doom to bear
With hideous language thus Inchants the ear
Of his yet living Brethren, and informs
Them with a Volley of most horrid Storms,
That this on us a fatal judgment was
For trampling down forsooth their Good Old Cause:
To which the Heavens reply; if so it be,
Tht it is a judgment, Charles his Clemency:
Occasions it; in suffering such to breath,
Whom Gods decree had justly marked for death:
See Saul the Almight yes favor was denied,
Whilst Murtherous Agag good Indemnify'd:
And Ahabs life a satisfaction gives
For Isreal's sin because Benhadad lives.
Pardon dread Sovereign sorrow cannot hold,
If that my zeal has made me overbold:
Not that we tax your mercy, but our fear
For this our loss augments a doubtful tear:
Least our blessed Martyr Charles, his blood has cried
to Heaven, and Heaven remains unsatisfied:
O may they soon receive their fatal due,
Least what is but now our fear, may prove too true.
O Envious Fate that with such dread appears
To put a period to his bloomeing years:
With what a mournful face have thou beset
Three drooping Realms with palefull Cypress; wet
In Stygian streams (our Gloucester being dead)
Where late the lively Laurel flourished:
Though newly sprung, yet with a potent grace
Did both protect and glorify the place,
Which now appears like to an unquoth Cell,
Where only Pilgrims and sad Mourners dwell
Our Country, City, Potentates, and Court,
All Clad in Sables mournfully report.
Our mis'rable misfortune to the skys,
With doleful hearts and sad lamenting eyes;
But O if this such dyre dejection bring
Unto the people, how resents the King
And Duke, this Priceless loss in whom we viewed
Three glorious bodies with one soul endu'd:
O how it pierces their Heroic souls,
How outward woe and inward grief controules:
their Royal natures, striving to outvy
our sacred Sovereign in Majesty:
Needs must the saddness of our Land be great
When sorrow solely swa^es the regal seat:
When Yorks most Valliant Duke these tidings hears
It like a Mandrake sounds in his ears:
Of which his Princely Sister bears a part,
That thrills like lightning through her tender heart:
The last of all the indulgent Mother oh,
How quickly's all her joy's now turned to woe:
She who beheld her tender branches tossed
By boisterous storms of Persecution; crossed
By barbarous Torrents of Rebellious Elves,
Daily repulst upon the dangerous shelves
Of War and Treason; now which hope revived,
Seeing her happy Sons which joy received:
In glad assurance trusts to see again,
Her Children in a glorious Triumph Reign:
With plentuous blessings and a Land Tranquil,
That may persuade her Charles is living still:
But O when she to England shall resort,
Her dearest GLOUCESTER's missing from the Court:
This only comfort left, he is gone to see
His Father Crowned with Heavenly Majesty.
There rest most Glorious blessed Soul with his,
The eternal sharer of his boundless bliss:
Whilst we thy absence mourn, and deck thy Hearse
With Cordial briney Tears, and Tragic verse.
EPITAPH.
H ere lies Gloucesters fairest flower,
E nglands joy in one blessed hour:
N ewly sprung; yet soon from hence,
R ap't to eternal Residence:
Y ou that at his Tomb appear,
D uly pay devotion here,
U nto these Holy Ashes, for
K nown when he died there fell a Star:
E arly as his year; the fall
O f which proves Epidemicall:
F alse Earthly joys appeared for him,
G loryes to base in Heavens esteem:
L ifted up above the Skies,
O n Angels wings to Paradize:
V ertue in his Royal breast,
C ontinuall flames of wrath possessed:
E nvious Time his glorious name,
S hall never destroy; his loud Tongued fame:
T his pious Marble still declares
E ncompast with a Sea of Tears
R eplenisht daily from his eyes
Of constant Loyal Votaryes.
