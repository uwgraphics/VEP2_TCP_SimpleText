A most Excellent and Remarkable SPEECH, Delivered by that Mirror and Miracle
of Princes, Queen Elizabeth, of famous memory, in the Honorable the High Court
of Parliament. in the seventeenth year of her Re^gne.
My Lord,
THis present Session of Parliament gathered together by Our command, for the
good of Our self and the prosperity of Our, Subjects, We wish may be as
fortunate to them as conducing to Our intents, which shall still guide
themselves to the advancement of Our peoples welfare. We are not ignorant of
the imbecility and unablenesse of Our sex to govern such a powerful and
mighty Kingdom as this is, strong in faction, through reason of diversity of
Religion now reigning in it, foreign Princes, especially the Pope and the
King of Spain, Our inveterate enemies, in regard of the profession of the
Gospel, who, both by practices abroad, and incitations of Our Subjects at
home, have sought all means to deprive Us of the royalty of this Our
Hereditary Kingdom; such and so bloody (...) of the (...) lo^^ the true
Worship of God, that they never cease, like roaring Lions, to go about day and
night, seeking whom they may devour: but though fear be naturally incident to
Ou^ sex, it is banished from the condition of a Prince; as We^ a^^ a woman. We
may fear to fall under their malice; as We are a Prince, the Sovereign of
this Kingdom, We cannot dread their attempts, knowing that the awe which is
intailed upon Majesty, has power to strike dead all such enterprises of the
most desperate traitors that are; and for Our own part. We shall no ways be
careless of Our own security: but as you, my Lords, and Our honorable the
House of Commons, have been well and judiciously advised in enacting good and
wholesome laws against these inhumane and barbarous traitors, the Recusants of
this Kingdom, so shall We without regard or fear of any, see they be put in
execution. We have made it always Our principal study, my Lords, to be well
experienced in the duty of Princes toward their people, and by the
instructions both of the Divine and Humane laws, We find that Princes have as
near a relation, and as strict an obligation to their Subjects, as Subjects
have to them; secundum morem principis, after the manner which a Prince can be
engaged or obliged, that is, by the bond fealed to the people at the
Coronation; every Prince covenants with the people, to defend them from all
injuries, domesticke and foreign, to institute and ordain good and wholesome
laws for their security, from oppressions one from another, and from the
Prince himself, who by the unlimited power and prerogative of his royalty, may
only, and yet more grievously afflict the people then the people can any way
injure one another; the people being equal one with another, and obliged to
the same laws, the Prince being above them. And surely wrongs from equals are
easilier righted then from superiors, the eminence of power often eithes
blinding the Eagles eyes of equity.

A Prince should therefore be toward the people, as that great Prophet Samuel
was toward the Israelites, whom, when he had judged for many years, he
boldly challenged the whole Congregation to attest against him whose Ox, or
whose Ass he had taken, or from whom he had received any bribe to pervert
Justice.

This, my Lords, have We in Our consideration and resolution, set down as Our
president in the government of this Our English Israel, whom Gods mercies have
notified his peculiar people, and this we shall ever accomplish, the due
administration of Justice. Princes as they are Gods on earth in title, should
be so in their actions: and We call you all to witness, my Lords, this day,
that in this seventeenth year of Our reign over you, We have never performed
any act preduciall to the liberty, or opposite to the known laws of the land,
which have been confirmed to them by so many Kings, Our Royal Progenitors; and
surely what Monarch of England that shall at any time go about to alienate the
property of the Subject, or impose on their immunities any innovation, or
diminishment, can never boast himself to be absolute Sovereign of this
Kingdom, nor to enjoy His Crown and dignity, with the well wishes, and
affections of his Subjects; for so large is the charter of the English Subjects
liberty, which the piety of Our Royal Predecessors have granted them, and the
merit of their own ancestors purchased, that they are a free people, if
compared with other Nations, who groan under the yoke and heavy burdens laid on
their servile necks by their Sovereigns, custom in suffering, making them
undergo their sufferings with-patience.

But the nature We know of all Englishmen to be such, that fair words and
gentle usage may sooner overcome and inslave their huge stomachs and great
spirits then any force or foul means whatsoever. There lives not in the whole
world a more obedient people to their Sovereign then Ours are, so long as they
continue; the Prince studies to defend and preserve their liberties, but if
once they fall off from that opinion, either by the over severity, or too much
neglect of their Sovereign in the managing the affairs of the Commonwealth:
They are of all other Subjects most violent and implacable, which We conceive
proceeds out of the extraordinary affection they bear their King, grieving
inwardly, and taking from hence more to heart any indignity offered them then
any Subject whatsoever.

But you my Lords, and you Our house of Commons, of this Our high Court of
Parliament, to you the principal care of Our people by Us has ever been
committed; We are so well assured, both by your own integrities, and the
presidents which you have given in former ages, both to Our Royal Father, and
others of Our renowned Ancestors, of your loyalties, that We should esteem it
an uncivil defect in Our judgment to doubt thereof: We know it was the Act
and wisdom of Parliament that united those two long jarring Royal Families
of York and Lancaster, both in Our self incorporated, by the marrying of Our
Grandmother and Grandfather of famous memory. It was the power of Parliament
that assisted Our said Grand father against all those conspiracies of Warbecke,
Lambert, and others, and tendered him victorious over all of them. It was the
wisdom of His supreme Council, the Parliament, guiding and counselling His
actions as well as His own natural prudence, that made Him be accounted the
very Solomon of his time throught all Nations; and surely it cannot be denied,
but it was the same genius of Parliament that in Our Royal Fathers time
produced such admirable effects, as were the denying the Antichristian
Supremacy of the Pope, and the dissolutions of those Seminaries of sloth and
vices, the wealthy Abbeys and Monasteries, which had gotten into their
possession the very fat of this Land, flowing with milk and honey, and did
also assist Him with aids of money in all his wars abroad, rendering His name
terrible to other Nations. It has been the justice of Parliament that has
settled the indubitate right of this Kingdom in his children, Our Brother,
Sister, and last of all, Our self, who must acknowledge that the Parliaments
congregated by Us, have been happy and fortunate, both to Our Self and people;
they have augmented: and settled Our Royal Revenue, discovered and punished all
dangerous conspiracies against Us, making and providing sharp and fitting
laws for the determent of all desperate wretches from practicing ought of
violence-against Our Person. The Parliament has by Our consent, reduced coin
throughout Our Kingdom of England, and Principality of Wales, to its just and
staple value. Finally, the Parliament is the mediator betwixt the Sovereigns
of this Kingdom and the people thereof, the best inheritance and supportment
of the royalty of the one, and the liberty of the other.

To you therefore Our Lords and Commons, assembled in this Our present
Parliament, to treat and manage the difficult affairs of this Kingdom, We do
most willingly commit and commend the care of them, We believe so many noble
and wise men, as here are gathered together, cannot be recreant from the virtue
of their Predecessors, who have obtained and ordained so many wholesome and
profitable laws for the weal of the Subject, but be as industrious and
zealous in the business of the Commonwealth, as they have been careful
husbands of their properties and patrimonies: they expect from you the
confirmation and augmentation of their liberties; and for Our own part, We are
so confident of your well meanings to Us, that We will freely entrust you with
all the differences, or controversies between Our Self and people, if any such
there be, that you may rectify and reform them: Our people are as Our Self,
and whatsoever ill or injury happens to them, either by the too much rigor of
the laws, or iniquity of the Judges. We shall judge as cast upon Us; look
severely to this business, and to all other that shall either concern the
people, or the true service of God, and you shall always find Us ready and
willing to correspond with your votes in any thing.

We have only one thing to admonish you of, which concerns Gods true
Religion, and Our self and people nee^ly, to wit, the power and still
increasing number of Popish Recusants in this Kingdom; the Pope and Our
English Fugitives sending over from beyond Seas daily new Emissaries of untruth
and sedition amongst Us; these must either be prevented, or as illegitimate and
dangerous sons of the Commonwealth, cut off, use in it your own discretions;
We are confident Our Parliament has as great a stock of wisdom as the grand
Council of any Kingdom whatsoever, that the wisest of the Kings Our
Progenitors have relied upon their prudence, well then may We, a poor weak
woman put all Our confidence in your discretions, which we shall ever as well
as at this present time, beseech the God of Heaven to increase and bless, that
the Land may be happy in the pendence of your Councels, and We rejoice and be
exalted and beloved of Our neighbors, to the peace of Our Kingdom and Our
own increase of happiness.

FINIS.
