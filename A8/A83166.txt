An Ordinance of the Lords and Commons in Parliament, for the calling of an
Assembly of Learned and Godly Divines.
WHereas amongst the infinite blessings of Almighty God upon this Nation, none
is, or can be more dear unto us then the purity of our Religion, and for that
as yet many things remain in the Liturgy, Discipline, and Government of the
Church, which do necessarily require a further and more perfect Reformation,
then as yet has bin attained, and where it has declared and resolved by the
Lords and Commons assembled in Parliament, That the present Church Government
by Archbishops, Bishops, their Chancellors, Commissaries, Deanes, Deanes and
Chapters, Archdeacons, and Ecclesiastical Officers depending upon the
Hierarchy, is evil and justly offensive and burdensome to the Kingdom, a
great impediment to Reformation and growth of Religion, and very prejudicial
to the state and government o^^ this Kingdom, and that therefore they are
resolved that the same shall be taken away, and that such a government shall be
settled in the Church, as may be most agreeable to Gods holy Word, and most apt
to procure and preserve the peace of the Church at home, and nearer agreement
with the Church of Scotland, and other reformed Churches abroad, and for the
better effecting hereof, and for the vindicating and clearing of the Doctrine
of the Church of England from all false calumnies and aspersions, it is thought
fit and decessary to call an Assembly of Learned, Godly, and Judicious Divines,
to consult and advise of such matters and things touching the premises as
shall be proposed unto them by both or either of the Houses of the Houses of
Parliament, and to give their advice and counsel therein to both or either of
