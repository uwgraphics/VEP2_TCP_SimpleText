A Message from a Committee of both Houses of Parliament, to the Spanish
Ambassador, to make stay of Ships at Dunkerk, intended for the supply of the
Rebels in Ireland.
THE Lords and Commons have commanded us, to intimate to the Spanish
Ambassador, the advertisement that they have received of certain Ships lying in
Dunkerk, layded with Ammunition ready, to take sale, intended for the relief of
the Rebels of Ireland: This they hold contrary to the Articles agreed upon, in
the Treaties of Peace between the two Crowns; And therefore the Ambassador is
to be moved from both Houses, to send speedily to Dunkerk, and to all other His
Majesty's Dominions, and unto the King his Master, to make stay of those, and
all such Ships, as may carry any supply of Men, Victuals, Money, or any other
aid to His Majesty's Subjects, that at this present are in Rebellion in
Ireland; Which otherwise will be understood to be a Breach of the Treaties,
between the Crowns of England and Spain, and so resented by the Parliament.
