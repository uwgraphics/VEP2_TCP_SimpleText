A Seasonable Caution, FROM The North to the South* BY
A Plain Country Man, Inhabiting amongst the Northern Hills, from whence the
Lord sent forth many of his Servants into the Nation, with the Message of the
Gospel, in our Day, whose Going Forth was as the Morning, their Light springing
forth as the Day who has Lived to see the Finishing and Dissolution of many of
them, and the Vail of Darkness and Apostasy coming on again, as the Practice
and Deportment of many, in diverse Public Meetings in several Parts of this
Nation (Who have contended for Form) have sufficiently demonstrated, contrary
to the Practice of the True Church in her Purity.

The Consideration of which drew him to write these following Lines, though in
a plain and simple Style, being most agreeable to his Capacity, and not
inconsistant with Truth.

Desiring the Reader to observe, when he speaks of the Church's Apostasy; that
he means, of that Ruling, or rather Overruling Party, with their Proselites,
who call themselves, The Church, that have Judged the Faithful to God, out of
Unity, the True Church understanding no cause for such a Censure, except they
want submitting Friends Affairs to their written Rules: which I take to be a
Mark of Apostasy.

Gods Great Appearance broke forth in our Day,
Whose Messengers to this Effect did say;
A Witness in each Conscience God did place
By the Inshinings of his Light and Grace,
Did show to each one, when they went astray
Which if obeyed, would lead them in the way
Of Life Eternal, which should never dye,
In which, all is Happy to Eternity.
But if against this Light we did Rebel,
Horror of Conscience and the Pangs of Hell
Would seize our Souls, and heavy on us lie,
And be our torment to Eternity.
Thus has the Lord laid open to each view,
And The Way of Life and Death unto all show
Wherein his Justice greatly does appear,
And when he comes to Judgment, will be clear
And each one's Blood required at their own hands,
Who having Knowledge, and broke his Commands.
But this has been a Mystery
Through Ages, in Apostasy.
But the Night of Darkness nearly spent,
His Messengers with his Word he sent,
That God his Will to Man imparts
By's Light in secret of their hearts;
Touching Gods Worship they inform
In Spirit and Truth we must perform;
All feigned, formed Worship here must fall,
Inventions, which some, Worship call.
Thus Gospel-Trumpeters he sent
Out of the North, which Clouds did rent,
And by their Trumpets certain sound,
Many awaked which lay bound
In The Grave of Sin, to Glorify
His Omnipotent Majesty:
So powerful was this Voice and Call,
Terror on Young and Old did fall;
And when his Presence did appear,
Faces turned pale, hearts struck with fear.
This dreadful and yet joyful Sound,
Did through these British Isles abound:
Many to seek God then inclined,
That knew not the Light in Darkness shined
This Pearl lay hid long under ground,
Though sought for, yet by few was sound;
But in the Lords appointed Time,
The Light out of Darkness did shine,
And then out of Obscurity
Break forth with great Celerity;
And when the Darkness thus declined,
Son amongst the Northern hills did shine,
And in such splendour to behold,
The Fame thereof in the South was told;
Whose Rising was to Admiration,
Which was confirmed through this Nation,
From which Illuminating Rays,
Both North and South his Name may praise.
Then Reformation did begin,
And the New Creation known within,
Then of New Heavens and Earth could tell
Where Truth and Righteousness do dwell:
The Deserts then came for to yield
More Plenty than the Fruitful Field.
God in his Servants by his Word,
Wrought this effect, which thus occurred;
Being with Righteous Armor clad,
And Gospel-Preparation shod,
Whose Vessels he did Sanctify,
That they his Name might Glorify;
He choosed the plainer sort of Men,
Which he prepared for's Preachers then,
Who were not Learned Rabinical,
Yet taught of him who did them call:
Some Call*d from Wife, and Children small,
Who in Obedience gave up all;
And in the Faith and Power they went
To unknown Place and Faces sent,
And the Saving-Gospel to them Preached,
Which in his Name and Power they Teach't,
And through it many a Conscience Reached.
Others he Raised in younger Years,
Who Faithful Witnesses appears,
And from their Fathers House did take,
And Skilful Preachers likewise make,
For to divide the Word aright,
Who in his Counsel walked Upright:
Both Young and Old who kept their Station,
Prophets and Preachers to their Nation:
And what I here do testify,
Both North and South may verify.
Their Godly Labors he did bless,
Unto the Churches great Success;
Who then came Flocking in apace,
Turned Inward to Gods Light and Grace;
To which his Servants did direst,
Knowing 'twould Righteousness effect;
In less than half an Age of Time
Thousands did flock to Gods Ensign
Of Light, his Ministers held out,
Which People gathered then about:
And in short time our Eyes did see
Church-Gather'd numerous to be;
And in more Beauty now appears
Than She had done hundreds of Years;
Her Lights did shine, their Lamps did burn
Which showed her Wilderness Return:
So obvious in the World was She,
Described then by Innocence,
Adorned with Virtuous Ornaments,
Perfumed with Odoriferous Scents,
That 'twere great Pity that e're She
Again to the Wilderness should flee.
'Twould many a Spirit wound and goar,
Considering this Estate before,
In this same Age and Time to see,
Entering again Apostasy;
And when that we do call to mind
How Good the Lord has been, and Kind,
And that in Her Revealed has been
What Good Men wished, and have not seen:
It rests upon them as a Seal,
That Is true to Israel's Commonweal;
Remembering those joyful Days,
Resembling Years of Jubilees:
When She did keep a Holy Day,
Like as the Sacred Writ does say,
Then from her Labors She does cease,
Resting in Him who gave her Peace:
How unto Her did People hye,
As Doves into the Window fly,
Most amiable to behold
Flocks Gathered, Resting in the Fold,
Sweetly in Him taking Repose
In Innocence, fearing no Foes,
Nor in the Fold was pushing any,
Though into it were gathered many,
Which then came flocking far and nigh,
To hear her Wisdom from on high:
No jarring then there did appear,
The Great Shepherd of the Flock was there:
Each one in Peace possessed his Vine,
Her Ministers amidst her shine,
Which did the Heavenly Image show
Most pleasant in the Church to view:
Many strong Pillars in her stand,
Supported by the Almighties Hand.
Then in those glorious Gospel-Rays
Was seen on's Throne the Ancient of Days,
And great and little Stars appear,
Shining in order in their Sphere:
Then in the Church Sincerity,
Was prized above Formality;
And Praise ascends as with one Voice,
Together the Morning Stars rejoice,
And then in her the Light did shine.
Opening deep Mysteries Divine;
Such sacred things revealed has been,
As Vultrous Eye has never seen,
When I look back for to aspect,
These Days, my Soul, greatly affect,
My Spirit, they almost inspire,
And on my Altar kindle Fire,
Who knew these things, and yet forget,
May for the Kingdom prove unfit.
Then the Church of Glory wore a Crown,
But now, alas! her Sun goes down;
She in great Splendour then did shine,
But now her Beauty does decline;
Once clothed with comely Ornaments,
Dis-robing now sends forth ill Scents;
Some that in her as Light shined clear,
Now growing dim, like Clouds appear:
But woe unto that Man or Place,
That brought upon Christ's Church, Disgrace
Better 'tad been, if they, or he
Had sunk in the bottom of the Sea.
How happy had She been this day,
If She had kept in the Ancient Way,
The Nation for her sake been blessed,
And She her Peace in God possessed;
Then had she still wore Glories Crown,
Her Sun had not been going down.
This former Glory is past and gone,
And Tyranny in the Chuch comes on,
When Ancient Pastors mostly sleep,
Who into the Fold gathered the Sheep;
Whose sense of loss of them is deep,
Which cause their Flocks in secret weep,
When Conscience must to Slavery
Men's Rules Imposed to walk by:
This Faith and Conscience does invade,
Which Truth and Reason should persuade;
When we the Gospel did receive,
Our Conscience witness to it gave:
Is It Gods, or Men's Way that is changed now,
That of this Test she will not allow;
The Truth, it will the Test endure,
And the more it is tried, appears pure;
But I do take it for their Pride,
Who on ambitious Wings do ride,
Who would have Faith pined on their Sleeves,
That say, Believe, as the Church Believes.
Yet if they will right Distinctions make,
We Will grant it, and for Truth it take;
But if She Will make Laws, and compel,
And out of her all such expel,
And cast out of her Unity
Who with her Rules cannot comply,
As such, in Her we cannot believe,
Nor pin our Faith upon Her Sleeve.
But in this Practice Sbe has been,
Our Ears have heard, and Eyes have seen:
Therefore let none offended be,
We say, This is Apostasy.
Will she prescribe a Form wherein he must remain,
That the Heaven of Heavens of old could not contain?
No such Commission yet we have,
Obeying Her, New Laws can save.
And since these things in the Church took place
Daily on her has come disgrace;
And greatly there is cause to fear
The Wolves again the Flock may tear.
Her late Procedur's not the way
That the Flocks into the Fold did draw,
Nor like his Voice, nor like his Call,
Who is great Shepherd over all.
The Pretended Church usurping Power,
Gives Satan advantage to devour:
Drawing from the Life of Restoration,
To practice Excommunication
Of those who do true witness bear
Unto the Truth of God in Fear;
This is not the Spirit which is free,
Ordained for Captives Liberty;
Who have Gods Messengers Rejected,
They and their Message disrespected,
And sowing of Divisions Seed,
Have made the Churches sorely bleed;
It Is they that brought her to this State,
That Brethren Excommunicate:
By Innocence how is she known,
Whose Practice has such Rigor shown,
And yet can give no reason why,
But Her Prescriptions not walked by;
And this has caused Her thus to Rage,
Like as some did in former Age:
Mother Ignorance, though old, I fear
May yet Conceive, and Children Bear:
But yet I hope there thousands be,
That serve God in Sincerity,
What e're Assemblies may decree,
Can to Inventions how no Knee,
Whose Faith and Hope in God does stand,
Fears not Excommunications Brand:
But looking back, still think upon
The Glory of those Days are gone,
Compared with these present Times,
Might cause my Pen write pensive Lines,
When those who had the Gospel to preach,
Have not been suffered it to teach.
This often sounds in my ear,
That Famine of the Word draws near,
The greatest Judgment that can fall
Upon a Poople, Great or Small.
Then such too late may call to mind,
How to Gods Servants they were unkind;
And since to them they lend no ear,
They from the Lord no word may hear,
And this there is more cause to fear
Than the sharp smiting Sword or Spear.
And for to see the Churches Rent,
In gathering which many were spent.
This is none of the meanest Crimes,
As may be known in future Times,
And Children unborn may weep,
When the Gospel Planters fall asleep;
If in this Land Christ be not found,
Nor to be heard the Gospel Sound,
Then doubtless woeful Days come on,
When once the Gospel Sound is gone,
People may wander far and nigh,
And Springs, Fountains, shall be dry,
Then withered shall be their Goard,
When there is a Famine of the Word:
But God deliver us, I pray,
We never see this woeful Day:
A wounded Spirit would us grieve,
When there is no one to Believe.
Sad Symptoms of these things appear,
This Judgment may be drawing near;
When as the Church so busy be,
To Compel to Conformity:
When written Rules must be our Guide,
Which the Spirits Leadance lays aside:
And when Church Orders must take place,
Above the Inward Truth and Grace:
Else to what end do they decree
To sentence out of Unity,
Only for Nonconformity:
Forcing to Practice (is blind Zeal)
That which the Lord does not Reveal:
Her Practice shows if she had Power,
She Would force her Cup like to the Whore:
Then from the greatest to the Least,
None buys nor sells, but the Mark o'th Beast
Yet's hoped there is many would not sup
Of the Abomination Cup;
But such Procedure may procure
True Church for to remain obscure:
The Whore would then great painting make,
And for the Spouse her self will take,
And many by her be misled,
True Church to the Wilderness being fled:
These things these Times too much concern,
Although some may against it spurn,
Yet I their Censures do not fear,
Nor frowning Countenance austere:
All Judgment to the Son commit,
Who Judge of Quick and Dead shall sit.
Further it is in my Mind to say,
And witness bear to the ancient way,
The Light of the Sun which God had sent,
Did and does Summon to Repent;
No other way he has made known,
Which leads to Salvation,
Subjection to this Light within,
True Reformation does begin;
It calletb for Sincerity,
And to walk in Integrity,
To serve God with an Upright Heart,
And from each evil way depart;
This is that Ancient Way and Path,
Through Ages walked the Righteous has;
And yet the New and Living Way
God has revealed in our Day;
No Devil into this Transform,
Though call in the Church for Uniform,
Into Imposed Formality
May enter greatest Hypocrisy,
And into Ceremonial Rites
May enter greatest Hypocrites;
But into the Light and Grace within,
Hypocrisy never enters in:
No Outward Forms preserib'd can save,
Nor Ransom any from the Grave;
Therefore there ought great care to be,
To what is prest-Conformity:
Conformity avails no whit,
But to the Mind of Christ submit:
Grant this, why is their laid such stress
On Outward Rules, Conscience to press*
If not obeyed, then out they cry,
The Church with you has no Unity.
It is a weakly Unity
That consists in Conformity,
Stronger's the Bond, Surer's, the Tie,
Where Truth is Cords of Unity;
Gathered Assemblies understand
Conscience's not bound to your Command,
Neither to you does appertain
To Compel Conscience, or Restrain
In point of Worship it is not fit
Men's Rules decreed should govern it;
It appertains to God on high,
Who Rules on Earth and above the Sky.
Conscience it is a Receptacle
What God to Man does preach,
And in Man, that is his Tabernacle,
Who his Statutes does teach.
Therefore who does this Place assume,
They are Usurpers and presume
His Throne for to ascend,
And greatly God offend,
Who through his Spirit of Truth and Grace,
For himself sanctifies this Place.
This I would add e're I give over,
Not knowing where I may write more;
For Time seems short allotted here,
When we be gone, and disappear;
Gods Servants do haste off the Stage,
The Lord seems to cut short this Age;
Though he by them great things has done,
Their Time was swift, as Posts that run,
Whose Course seemed Run before ripe Age,
Which something may to us presage,
Though as a Secret it be sealed
From all but to whom God Reveal't:
Many who have the Vineyard dressed,
Now in the Fathers bosom rest:
And from their Labors now do cease,
In full Enjoyment of Heavens Peace;
And lasting Joys, which never fail,
Whilst we their Absence here bewail:
But their blessed Memory makes us glad,
Mixing our Joys with Sorrows sad.
And that which further satisfy,
Death could not break our Unity.
And when our Pilgrimage is at an end,
Hope to partake with them, Joys that transcend:
And in the interim do cast in this Mite,
Them to make known to future age delight.
Heavenly was their Society,
Great Patterns of Piety,
Meeting together to converse,
Would many heavenly things rehearse,
Making deep Mysteries appear
Unto our Understandings clear,
Opening to us the Heavenly way,
Clear as the Light is at Noon Day.
It Was no small Mercy, may we say,
That we were brought forth in their Day,
Nor the least Mercy that we see,
A Remnant of this Stock yet be,
Who the Gospel Truth do still aver,
And from the Ancient Path not err:
In contemplation of this deep,
Both Heart rejoice, and Eyes do weep;
And Matter still it does indite,
'Twere endless for my Pen to write,
For that a Depth there does remain,
Which Tongue nor Pen can never explain:
And yet I faint to think upon
The danger of the Flock when they are gone;
Though God is able to supply,
If they alone in Caves should lie,
Then on his Graces sufficience:
Let Us all have our Dependence.
Here I shall rest and make an end,
And all unto this Grace commend;
Council that is ancient and profound,
And through this Nation once did sound.
Being inclined thus to rehearse
These solid Truths in simple Verse,
Needing no flourishing Elegance,
The Subject of it self's, Substance.
