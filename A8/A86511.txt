LONDON, Printed in the Year, 1648.

The Honest Soldier, OR, A Vindication of the Reduced Officers, otherwise
called Reformadoes, against the blastings of most gross Untuths, wherewith
they have been Aspersed.
TRuth is my Witness (which needs no Screen) a saying (both old and true,) If
believed, I have my aim, otherwise, I have performed my endeavors; let such
as scruple it speak impartially, and (I am confident) when time and their own
experience shall ripen the event, happily then, they may (though late) credit him
whose daily wishes are, the God of goodness may speedily assist his distressed
Church and Kingdom.

It has been observed by diverse obliged Officers, such as at S. Lawrence
Church London, entered into a Protestation, by Commissions from his Excellency
the Earl of Essex; afterward, and lastly, by their Solemn League and Covenant;
That although they have cordially acted accordingly (God protecting their
endeavors thorough much peril,) yet have they not transgressed against those
Engagements (either in their affections or actions) really for the Parliament
of England, or against its Enemies. And notwithstanding the fidelity of such
Officers (to so strong Engagements,) most faithfully and dutifully performed;
others have obtruded into, or have conferred on them the most eminent Commands
of the Kingdom, (who do not only refuse to join in those Engagements, but do
detest and abhor the thing and all that have submitted thereunto;) although
it can never appear that those men showed themselves more faithful, or
deserved better from the State or people of England; but to the contrary, very
many amongst them have disobliged the Kingdom etc. and never looked an Enemy
in the face, in any Expedition or Field (where Field Service was,) being taking
into Service since the Kingdoms Enemies were quelled and all danger past:
Besides, it is observable, that the condition of such Officers as acted (to the
hazard of their lives, and loss of their blood) for the Parliament of England,
are worse and in less esteem, then theirs that acted against them; (O most
unnatural times!) It is undeniable, that the Parliaments Intrest became
dubious, and few had engaged for them, had not the Champion of Englands
Liberties (the Earl of Essex) undertaken it; A man of unparralled worth,
Galentry, Noble birth, fixed principles, and known experience in Marshall
affairs; whose person only and alone formed an Army, for their (and the
Kingdoms) Service; when neither the Power, Declarations, or Remonstrances of
Parliament, (in all visible appearence) could effect it: But how that
matchless man (and such gallant spirits as as did engage with him) have been
gratified, let the covert and hidden thoughts of those that then voted to live
and die with him speak, (as in the presence of the all-seeing God) to which I
shall submit.

And although matter of much discouragement might also have been observed (in
the Occurents of such times) after that excellent man (and the faithfull-men
that served the Parliament under him,) had with indefatigable pains raised and
marched with a formidable Army, to ballence their numerous and potent
Adversaries, and had constrained them to acknowledge the Parliament at
Westminster, and encouraged their Masters (the State of England) to own that
name, until his Excellency and they had peaceably laid down their Commissions,
and surrendered their Power into the hands that gave it; It, yet being from my
purpose and a task to hard for me, I wave it: Only that this may redound to his
perpetual and never dying honor (upon whom every days additionall experience
multiplies the dear affection of his perplexed Country,) that having in sundry
great Battles faithfully performed his Trust, fortunately Conquered their
Enemies, and triumphed in the love and hearty affections of all; this Champion
of his Country surrendered his Charge into their hands that gave it, with as
much content and quiet, as he had with magnanimity and courage at first
undertaken it; although had he disputed the thing, rubbed up past injuries, or
demurred until repairation or satisfaction had for himself and others, whose
injuries and just Demands were also great, and might more justly have
challenged that, then some have since done; certainly, he could never have
wanted for power, credit, or greatness to support his under-takings therein,
and Vindicated himself and them: But he owned not so vile and low a thought,
self respects, or other ends then what did wholly tend to his first undertaken
Interest, either to enthrone himself, or purchase other being, then what he
was born unto, the heir which he aimed to enrich, was the Kingdom and People of
England only; for whose weal he contended, and with that contentedly laid down
and died.

And herein as I intended not a scrutiny of his Excellencies particular
sufferings, so neither have I purposed to numerate or sum up theirs subordinate
to him, although their discontents were infinite, (to their perpetual
dishonor be it spoken, that have ungratefully reaped the haverst of their so
perilous, pious, and faithful endeadeavours;) but where Religion and our duty
to God comes into neglect and derision, the pious Professors thereof
slighted, scorned and abased, our great and admirable deliverances
ungratefully received, and in stead of Reformation (according to Protestations
and Covenants promised,) a licencious Toleration of Sects, Schisms, Herisies
and profaneness; O where the sacred Ordinances of God have been sacrilegiously
trampled upon! what can men (although never so well deserving) expect.

But hence to my further purpose (that is to say) how and in what manner the
Services and expectations of the Kingdom, became fruitless under the hands of
those men commonly called Reformadoes, is that intended here:

This afterward, there arose another Pharo in Egypt that knew not Joseph,
whose Tax-Masters became cruel etc. Those impose impossibilities, Bricks are
expected without Straw; new Lords new Laws, new Mouldings for new Designs.

Now Committees (a new and Arbitrary device) have the Kingdoms sole Power,
commonly chosen in every County of the No general rule without exception etc.
for both the Kingdom and Soldiers have found some noble conscientious
Gentlemen amongst those, as the Committees of Hampshire, Wostershire,
Shropshire, Buckingham, and some few besides that were civil to the Country
and paid the Soldiers.
lowest and meanest men (as most proper for the purpose intended) neither
shuting with civility etc. or any property becoming so honorable a charge,
these have the Kingdoms sole Power in laying Assesments for Contribution,
Excise, 5th and 20th part, Delinquents Fines, Compositions, and Sequestrations;
by virtue whereof, as if it had been unanimously agreed upon where ever they
came, they make short and clear work of the Kingdoms Treasures, which they
hoard up and bank improperly, and the better to shelter their close and
fraudelent purposes herein; the Commanders and Officers Millitary (for whose
support and entertainment primarily such assesments were intended,) are
vilified, aspersed, neglected, thwarted, and discouraged; their wages, pay, and
subsistence detained from them, and in a very large measure converted to the
unsatiable use of those Vermin; after their supporters, etc. (men generally
known) of a strain above those men, and two strains in Covetousness before
them (under whose screen those Caterpillars are propt up) had been gratified
with the more solid weighty part; a practice so fully known to the Kingdom,
especially, the Counties where these men are; and to the Searchers of
Graves-end, Dover, and other Ports of this Kingdom, that I shall not need
express here more of it.

And wherein the Soldiers (for better satisfaction) have been necessitated to
enter into a scrutiny or closer discovery of such practices; their persons have
been calumniated, detracted, affronted, scandalized, discouraged, and so much
made unserviceable; that the time which they should have better bestowed in
service against the Enemies to manage their weighty employments in; they must
be feign to convert into Solicitations, assume the garb of an Agitator, or
humble Orator at a Committee-mans Lodging; their Clark or Door-keepers Chamber,
trace Westminster Hall, or by favor crowd into the Loby and there cringe,
flatter and faune to the Members for a nod (which hapily may be obtained by the
favor of their Servant, Footman etc. a favor beyond their merits or former
Service,) a garb most improper and unbeseeming Soldiers, men of Honor and
Gallantry, that would in the face of an Enemy rather breathe their last, then
daign so low and ignoble an employment, chiefly from those men for whom their
blood and lives was not thought dear to purchase peace; (but what will not
necessity force men unto, especially, from seeming friends) whose civility
oblige very much, especial when strengthened with a conscientious Cause,
endeared by Protestations, Covenants, and a faithful winning General;
wherefore that no just stain might stick upon their Honors, or blemish their
Integrity, in dischage of their duty to God, and their trust to man, the
necessities of effecting both being so prevalent, viz. Recruts of men, money,
horses, arms, ammunition etc. without which undoubtedly the Kingdoms
Expectations was not to be satisfied, or the Soldiers wished for Victory
completed? and is there any honest minded man, but would rather undergo any
difficulty, to support and carry on a concernment so high and pious, then
desert it thus for a puntilio of honor, although indeed the posture be beneath
a Soldier, and although also the causes of their attendance ought to have been
provided to their hands (by those men unto whom they became Petitioners;)
Nevertheless such was the gallantry, fidelity, and piety of most Commanders,
Officers and Soldiers, (disdaining those discouragements and infinite more
besides) they resolve rather to submit, cast themselves upon the worst of
miseries and try all conclusions, then desert their Covenant or quit their
Trust.

Nevertheless, here rests not the violent and piercing malice of those
beginnings, but daily became more heightened upon them, as well to the increase
of their discontents, as to the ripening of some hidden mystery, then enforcing
admiration (but at this day unvailed, and with colors displayed open,) which
then caused their more narrow and particular scrutiny, where in it is
discovered, that the longer they struggle or strive to steare fast unto their
commands, the more they are ensnared, until the ends are obtained, which is
either to wrest their Commands out of their hands, or become dejected Slaves,
and hold by villinage from real Villains their dunghill Committee Lords.

And when it succeeds not effectual to their expectations thus, secondary
attempts are endeavored, either maliciously objecting (or putting into the
mouths of their impudent and brazen fore-headed crew of Varlets Tub-Preachers
Male and Female.
to object,) that such and such, are Persecutors of the Saints, debauched,
profane etc. or they are treacherous, and may endanger their Trust to the
Enemy; the Malignants have access and favor more then fitting etc. with
infinite besides, the least of which being sufficient cause without
Examination, and legal trial or proceeding Marshall or Civil to deprive them
of their Commands, if by tedious attendance full of perplexities, wants and
miseries, they have not been forced to quit them or starved out of them.

And wherein such or like practices come short of their expectations,
jealousies and discontents are somented between the Officer in Chief, and such
as are subordinate unto them; especially, where there they find inclinable men
and ambitious spirits, to such offers of perferment are made, as their
superiors commands etc. apt suell, and very catching amongst Soldiers, and
the only alluring bait to rend and divide Officers and Soldiers. Or otherwise
thus, viz. In favoring such men (as are conceived fittest to bring on their
Design) with more constant pay or greater allowance, whilst the Chief
Commander or Officer, on whose shoulders lie the greatest charge (and who
frequently have employed with their purses and credits to furnish the defects
insident to their Commands) are unjustly slighted and aspersed.

And again, where a Brigade or other distinct Command have been united by
special Order for particular Services, yea, and where their duty have been one
and the same; notwithstanding, the one as of the Little or greater Trust, have
been constantly paid; the other (although without exception inferior to none
in courage, activity, and integrity,) nothing, of purpose to invite or allure
the Soldiers of the one to desert them and inlist with the other.

And to this I add another as probable, viz. such a Garrison, Fortress, etc.
is superfluous, useless, and such Forces Supernumerary, and therefore to be
slighted or Reduced out of hand, though with as much dexterity, a pretended
sanctified brother again repossesses that Garrison; and the Reduced Forces by
another brother of the same stamp are again inlifted, that the Kingdom may be
eased of Supenumeraries, Reprobates as they call them, to enlarge the Dominion
of their Saints.

But now to another; That is to say, when by Order or Ordinance of Parliament,
effectual Authority has been granted, to such or such to Command such a
Garrison, Castle etc. wherein much fidelity and care was performed in many
streights and difficulties, where not only Garrisons, but strong filled Forces
of the Enemy have continually been (whilst any Enemies did appear in any part
of the Kingdom:) Nevertheless before both Houses had thought expedient or fit
to Demolish or slight such Garrison, Castle etc. or Reduce such Forces, a
single Order of the House of Commons has been by strong Forces of Horse and
Foot forced upon them; yea, and often before any Order at all for that purpose,
whole Regiments of Horse and Foot have surrendered their Quarters, and lien upon
them so close, as at a Leaguer, when by the encroaching Enemies, they had been
left scarce bread, and what the Enemy in their height of prosperity durst not
attempt; those brethren of fraud, by a pretended friendship obtain, thinking
thereby to necessitate a Disbanding, and this when the Kingdom was Reduced and
wholly at their dispose to Quarter where they would.

And here observe the fraudulent usage, these reduced Officers met with all;
Ordinances of Parliament, strong Declarations, Covenants, Promises of constant
Pay, Honor, and infinite other the like plausible pretenses, to raise or
induce them to raise and take up Arms, are cast before their eyes; but the
danger past, Enemies quelled, and those men triumfantly settled in a
flourishing condition of ease and profit: A bare Mandamus from the House of
Commons is then thought sufficient Authority to Disband them, without
performance of any thing; where to the contrary, their Model brethren receive
encouragement, are applauded and deemed men of much holiness, for being
disobedient and refractory: The other reputed for obedience, a reprobate and
profane Rabble. But that it may appear, these men of disobedience have been of
more repute and better provided for, let the Ordinance of December. 24. 1647.
bear witness, wherein as a frontis-piece or usher of good hopes, two
Ordinances of the same Date, seemingly proffer an ample provision for the
generallity of Reduced Soldiers, out of the Excise, Delinquents Estates, but
presently in the Rear marched a third Ordinance of the same Date, which not
only cuts of the Reduced Soldiers hopes therein, but gives the said Excise and
Delinquents Estates, with the addition of Bishops Lands unto their godly, as
they call themselves, though indeed the children of disobedience, (most
conscientious dealing) those being in standing pay, the other long since
reduced and having not wherewithal to buy their bread.

And lastly, although these men have neither deserved well from the Parliament,
of whom they are ill members and worse principled, bringing dishonor upon that
Honorable Assembly, because of their base ends, their Country for whose good
they pretendedly sat; or to the honest Soldier who deserved better from them;
yet that their qualities and not their names may appear (although both are well
known unto me, and could justify the verity of each particular herein Charged,
have pointed at the time, when, where, and by whom, but unwilling to act by
their example, and to asperse or lay so gross calumny upon the particular
person of any with whom in a cause so pious we did partake, although degenerate
and fallen from good principles, and at a most vast distance from us and
honesty. Nevertheless, purposing rather to drive home to their consciences
their numerous errors and atheistical actions, and to excuse the innocent,
then accuse any, I have therefore thought fit to add their ensuing dealings
with us, which to the judicious may suffice to clear and vindicate the reduced
Officers from that most unchristian like aspersion of protracting the War,
suggested purposely to effect the designs now on foot; and which with much
greater reason should be charged upon the Sectaries, who unjustly assume the
honor of their Countries Saviors as their due, and only proper to them:
Although the Covenanting reduced soldiers in all Services, to the finishing or
full completing of the War, are known to have born the greatest share; having
during three or four years continually, and in the strength, heat, cream, and
gallantry of their enemies (whilst foreign and home Recruits of money,
horses, plate, etc. came abundantly to their aid) withstood them, and spun
their gallantry, even their prime gentry etc. into a desperate, destitute, and
dejected condition, although not without much peril and misery on their part.
And though I am not ignorant that these may come into such hands as will joy in
our divisions, (having spared my pains herein a long time for that very
purpose); yet rather then suffer so unjustly, and that perpetually, and knowing
likewise that those men are not ignorant of those harsh practices against us, I
thought fit publicly to appear in our vindication (which indeed comes not
forth without extreme necessity) hoping our long patience under such heavy
aspersions may justly excuse us. And here 6 ways are to be taken notice of
whereby deserving men have been injured.

1. The constant practice of detaining pay, that their soldiers might desert
them, and repair unto others which were better paid, even those very men, or
like them, that are now in high esteem; viz. Sectaries.

2 Shortning Relief or Recruits of horse, arms, etc. whereby the Enemy may get
an advantage against them, that they might come to dishonor or disgrace; which
being once got into the mouths of such instruments as are for that purpose set
on foot, those honest soldiers are nipt off, and the other renowned champions
spoken of are straightways ingrafted in their stead.

3 Not enabling men (of integrity, without exception) with power to punish for
any crime, purposely that their Soldiers might grow licentious and unruly,
thereby hoping dishonor may come unto their Commander, and Petitions from the
Country, or the parts where such Commander served, to request his removal, that
so, etc.

4 The sending forth their renegado Tub-preachers, male and female, into every
Garrison, etc. not only to instruct and teach licentiousness amongst the
Soldiers, but to try the Commanders how they did affect that Doctrine, that
where they were despised, they might not only shake the dust off their feet
against such men, but hasten into the Army to --, and with him, and others of
his cut, raise infamous reports against whom they pleased; which must be
swiftly carried about, that no author may be caught with it: and thus unheard,
unseen, these guiltless souls are betrayed, whilst up comes a brother, ut
supra, etc.

5. That soldiers should more cheerfully decline their employments, and less
earnestly proceed in demand of arears: the Irish service is seemingly offered,
to which (being exceedingly devoted) they do with as much reality tender
themselves, and with all diligence speedily endeavor to strengthen their
forces, still screwing up their credits as well to recruit as to keep on foot
those they have, when words and promises, their remaining remedy for several
months, are thredbare worn, and can prevail no longer, whilst nothing of
consequent as to the accomplishing of such proposals comes to their relief,
until the Country distasting the pressures of free quarter, rise against them,
and force them to disband, or their other necessities dissipate or disperse
them. Colonel Devereux, Colonel Mydhop, and sundry others have suffered much
herein: and others there are which obediently quit their commands in the model
Army according to order, as well to show their obedience, as to take on that
service, met with no better usage herein; let Colonel Sheffield, Sir Robert
Pie, Quartermaster General Fincher, Colonel Butler and many besides, add to
this their knowledge.

6. To bring up the rear with the single example of a singular deserving man
(the Van in spite of malice without exception) Colonel Graves is ordered to
guard the Kings person: but whether doubtful his command might become
permanent or lasting, and in time by his gallantry extinguish those new lights,
he is designed to be surprised by a crew of etc's. without order, and hardly
escaped with his life: his soldiers, like as Col. Sheffields, Sir Robert Pies,
Col. Poynes, and many gallant men besides put on and encouraged to mutiny
against them. To these I could add infinite other examples; but let these
suffice at present.

And though I have willingly past over many unsupportable sufferings of those
Reformadoes or reduced Officers, because I would hasten unto the obstructions
they met withal after reducement, until when General Fairfax and the Council
of the Army set forth their Representation to both Houses of the 7 of December.
1647. in which their Saint-like charity, with the fruitless attendance, and
future expectations of those wanting Gentlemen may appear.

And thus having been despitefully dealt withal by their tax-masters, and with
menaces unsupportable compeld to quit their fair though deer bought holds in
Goshen, neither furnished with jewel etc. or other borrowd stuff to support so
endless a journey, yea without consideration had of their salary, arears, or
other maintenance either for the present or the future, they remove and march
on toward the Land of promise at Westminster Hall, under the conduct of much
promised hope where they encounter not only with a large and deep sea or gulf
full of miseries far unlike that the children of Israel quietly marches over
and more in resemblance to the other which met with Pharaoh and his host in the
rear) but a wilderness of endless scarcity, (where in stead of better meat,
they are fain to feed on fraudulent Orders, scornful answers, and lying
promises; or, what is worse, the pillar, cloud, light, their director, is
endeavored to be veiled from their eyes, and pillars of New light from Satan
obtrude, who guide the Kingdoms treasure and these men's wages into his Infernal
Country, for the security of these his Saints the blind guides): A wilderness
not improperly to such as since this reducement have made trial of
Westminster Hall, and numerous removes to the several Committees of Associated
Counties and others, chiefly that of Accounts at Free-mans Hall, London, a
Labyrinth, with the several windings and turnings whereof, never yet bottomed
by any; where they are upon Oath to accuse themselves, and never the nearer to
effect their purpose; and where also, although they bring good Certificates for
actual service, from their chief Officer, sufficient Avouchers, perfect Audits,
and full and just Testimonials under the hands of Country standing Committees
or Sub-Committees for Accounts; (things past through and gotten with exceeding
great difficulty and expense from those two last sorts of men especially, who
are continually averse and at enmity with Soldiers; it may justly be suspected
by order or instruction from their Masters:) difficult indeed, I say, to be
attained unto by the reduced Officers; although the godly party (that since the
Kingdoms reducement have became their Countries defenders, and neither before
or since purchased it at so dear a price) have found better success: But, as I
said, where Reformadoes with much expense, and postings into the remotest
Countries of the Kingdom, have at last perfected their desires abroad, and full
of hopes returned to Free-mans hall; there yet again they are retarded: either
there wants an Establishment, a full Committee, their Clerks servants and
door-keepers are grown Masters, and cannot be compelled to attend unless they
may be better paid: a just exception, and more becoming a Soldier to have
stood upon, when his wages was detained, and his life in hazard, then such
petty Clerks, and a causlesse complaint too, if well examined: for it is well
known, that there are Soldiers have sold or pawned their clothes to purchase
dispatch and access from those Leeches: but there is yet a remora which
retards their proceedings: either it is Term-time, and the Counselors Members
of that Committee (without whom their Colleagues, Tradesmen and Citizens,
ignorant, and not so well versed in that calling (it should seem) fearful to
outstrip their knowledge, dare not proceed) must attend their profit at
Westminster: or it is Exchange-time, and the vacation of the other concerns
them as much: Which shuffle and pack really comes from Westminster, and but in
species from those Gentlemen of that Committee, of whom in this I have not the
least thought of guilt, only that they dare not offend -- * Which may the
better be discovered, if observed how often they petitioned for redress
herein, but never received satisfaction, neither could they ever understand of
any Order, Ordinance, or other Instructions of Parliament in their behalf,
until Birch his Ordinance of the 28 of May, 1647, fast and loose: fast, I say,
as to the completing or besting any man's Accounts complete or perfect (an
ingratiating policy of a seeming Presbyterian, who needed no Ordinance for
audit of his accounts, being well paid before, or he is extremely belyed); but
loose, and very clear, as to any thing that could entrap or beat down the
Soldiers accounts: all which did give them just cause to suspect that nothing
less was intended, then by such delays they might be enforced to contract
debts upon them, whereby at length they should be necessitated to flee their
demands, and quit further claim; or (as by my experience I may speak it) be
forced to contract with -- for a small part in satisfaction of all.

And thus, whilst they lie under the greatest and highest rage that malice can
inflict, still chaste and unmovable to their Covenant, its Parliament and
friends, modestly expressing their unfeigned necessities by Petition and other
deportments of civility, they reserve rough and sleighting answers, gestures
and looks of reproach (fit objects for scorn and revenge in high spirits, and
may not unjustly be suspected intendedly to have been put upon them to enforce
mutiny, or some act properly fit or apt for Question, and loss of their
Arrears: witness the black list, and other menaces many, bugbears that
frequently stand aloft to affright Reformadoes.

But that these great professors of Zeal (full as impious in their pretenses,
as blasted in their piety) could strain at a gnat and swallow a Cammel full
glib, let the Records, Orders and Ordinances of their Derby-house and -- etc.
bear record with their unsanctified consciences and come in Judgment against
them: what vast gratuities of thousands have been dared over and tossed from one
member to another and jointly (none dissenting) to their godly deserving
brethren, in recompense of pretended (though false) losses, and as many
(falsely usurped) services, performed by more deserving men, and by Peter's the
Post snatched from them and presented to the -- you may imagine in another
shape: some of which members had never been worth the 20 part of the gratuities
given them, and others whose estates were vaste, full as great in avarice,
without remorse of Conscience or thankfulness to God, or those wanting
soldiers (that as a scrine stood between the enemy and them, their lives and
estates) hurd up their wages, and the Kingdoms treasurs, that rather should
(out of their own plentiful estates presented to their hands) have contributed
to the releife of their necessities. And here likewise the ungratefulness of
many Divines is not to be past over, that in an audience proper, at seasons fit
and apt, upon texts of Scripture, rather complain of Lean Benifices, promote
themselves and their interest, boast what miraculous victories their prayers
have wrought, how they stood in the gap, and what God has done for them in
this work, in every pulpit enforcing their own praise, and artributing to the
soldiers nothing, (where they might have told him to be contented with his
wages when he can catch it:) It is undeniable that the prayers of many godly
men prevailed much, to which the courage strength activity or force of the
Soldiers, (I mean chiefly the first undertakers) was not compatible: for a
Horse is a vain help, and shall not deliver any by his great strength:
(nevertheless herein are not such praise worthy instruments (that courageously
endeavored to perform their obligation to God and their Country) to be
forgotten.

Now when as much time had been spent in expectations, and many lean faces did
express the wants they met withal at Westminster (whether ashamed such
objects of pity came so frequent into open view, or of purpose to decoy them
into the Country, amongst their friends and kindred for recrute of flesh and
cloths) the deluding Ordinance of the tenth of December 1646, is prepared,
which directs them for pay to the Countries or assocaitions in which they had
formerly served, where those perfidious Committees in obedience to the private
instructions of their Masters above, are prepared with delays for all, but pay
to none, and at the last after much chargeable time spent and more experience
gained to no purpose, they return to Westminster; where objected to grow
numerous, new plots are sooner projected then discovered, the houses are in
danger, and those quondam friends the Reformadoes must now be reputed new
enemies, or to judge more charitably, (the houses being careful of their
safety in a time of enraged sickness (that had rather by much open their
treasures to bury a starved soul of them, then to preserve him alive) they
must not endanger their persons within 20 miles of London, unto whom the
Royallists are thought fit to be coupled, whose penalty extends only to
imprisonment, but to the other (viz) their old friends the Reformadoes they add
besides imprisonment the forseit of their arrears, whereas had they in answer
to any of their modest petitions or humble requests received but any assurance
that they should have been paid or provided for, most of them had of their
free accord quit the City and their chargeable attendance at Westminster.

Here I though improper to my tax, yet being proper to this subject, I could
have spoken on an object of far greater piety, (viz Gentlemen and others that
have lived in good repute in Ireland, which here have neither friends to
recrute flesh or cloths with, or houses that they can confidently put their
heads into and also forced to wander in the same progress at Westminster Hall
out of their zeal and affection to the truth, (which you seemingly profess)
that nevertheless daily pass by their wounded brethren full of anguish as the
Priest and Levit did, Luke 10. when with Charity and justice, they should have
been employed into their country against the enemies of God and their Peace
before any: And had I not undertaken to conceal names, such high crimes happily
had forced me here to have culled out certain of their unworthy country men,
men in power and full of envy that comply with any for profit though to the
ruin of their country and these poor souls; but this subject requires a
volume, and therefore I am forced to shorten it here with this digression. Only
let me say, thus much; I find in Fames record Mr. Anesly and Sir William
Persons honest truehearted men and beside them few.

Forasmuch therefore as their afflictions have been untolerable in the eyes of
just men (unto whom only they appeal and before whom they shall always
endeavor to approve themselves candid in their actions, and contienscious to
their undertakings) they cannot conceive wherefore any just guilt should stick
upon them, being unchangably the same, always as willing and ready as ever
they have been, with their blood and lives to stand up in defense of their
Covenant and in it, their Religiion etc: their King etc: the Parliament of
England etc: the Subjects etc. and all the Covenants Legitimate brethren,
defenders thereof against violence and oppression: unless it be a crime to
acknowledge this, as many reduced officers by their petitions did the last of
June, unto the Parliement then full and under no force, And within a little
after, with their City brethren at Saint Iames-Fields, Guild Hall, and other
places (from whom they expected a fuller measure of love and fixed performance
for their kindness; But I wish in my heart they may not repent it, or
gratfully remember it when God shall please to visit them with better times:)
by an order of both Houses should have manifested (and believe it) shall again
Nemine contra dicenti whenever that cause and the like authority shall
require them: If I say this be a crime wherefore was It Imposed, and being
imposed we and not you are the Judges of our own Consciences, you might have
made Interpretation of it to your ends, and our satisfaction in ease of
conscience before it came to be imposed; but by your leave being taken, your
sophestry may not excuse us before God, he bears record with our consciences
in what sense we received it; which accordingly by the Almighty help with life
and limb we will maintain. To impose it (if a crime) was yours, and the breach
thereof shall never be laid to our charge God willing but how that may, be
exacted from you, after this life, may be supposed; but because that may be
least feared I wave it; however I dare confidently tell you there is in this
life a day of account like to come and that speedily, where that pack-horse for
carrying on designs, even that very slighted thing will Enforce their humble
submission, even theirs that so much scorned and derided it, where the abuse of
Religion, King, Kingdom, and its vaste treasures for self ends, will come in
judgment against them; in the mean time it behooves your Committees, Excise
men, Sequestrators, and vasalised Rabble etc. to press hard for an act of
Indemnity, and it will as much concern you at that day to make strong provision
for them as for your selves, for through them your nakedness will appear, and
your galled sides will sore trouble you. I say no more, a few words to the
wise, etc.

Pray are not those reduced officers obliged to defend the Parliaments rights
and privileges? what then is the jealousy? do they not know for whom they
acted, how dangerous and fatal it may prove unto them if they should advance
any other interest? where then lies the distrust? Is not their pay and arrears
the fruits of their hard service utterly lost if they should relinquish the
Parliament of England? what then on their part can be feared? O mystery, how
is this riddle to be unfolded? mary I conceive by the said Representation of
General Fairfax and his council of the Army, and a gratifying Ordinance from
the Parliament formerly expressed which tells you of no other arreras or
admittance to any audit for arrears but his army and such as did adhere to
them, when they marched up -- you know when, where and how, etc. how? adhere to
that army with whom they had no authority of Parl. to join? the army by order
of Parliament, molded to a number certain in officers and soldiers, and then
complete (if not exceeding their number) in both? that army which contrary to
its orders from the Parliament refused to disband, marched up beyond its bonds;
forced, awed, and gave orders to etc. -- their Masters? An Army that abhor the
covenant and such as adhere unto it; disoblige government and all of its
tenent? An Army that prise none but sectaries and libertines who only are
advanced by it and none but they from such good Lord, deliver my Reformado
friends Say, what have those reduced officers or soldiers gotten, that were
not of you, but for a time and necessity marched with you? What preferment, what
arrears, what expected satisfaction? were they not presently after excepted
against and disbanded as supernumeraries, went off without their pay which
others had? With such comrades and of such principles, I am confident the
reduced Officers will be exceeding cautious hereafter to join.

But as to those that have been of a long time reduced from other commands,
recruted or ignorant at first of the designs, did insist in the Model army
(which are at this day the better part of their Armies horse and foot) old
Soldiers who had been marshilled, exercised and drawn forth, under the Earl of
Essex and other faithful Commanders of the Covenant stamp, of which sort I say
at this day is the better part of the Army (other Officers excepted) to whom as
they are honest men and of the first principles, from my heart I wish increase
of happiness and honor (things never to be attained unto in that Army) and
now as their real friend let me advise them to be both vigilant and very
circumspect how to take for current such dross as their mechanic Officers
would force upon them or through their strength and power, build such strong
fabrics for their Officers greatness upon the destruction of Covenant, King
and Kingdom: be wise in time my friends, come out of her, lest you share in
her plagues: It is generally known that the cup of her filthiness fornication
etc. is brimfull: there fore return in time to your first principles.

And in conclusion I shall request that the plainness or naked truths of my
expressions may be excused in two respects, and not at all imputed to concern a
third. First for the anguish of our present sufferings; which was hoped that no
heart so adamant in tyranie but would have relented, or relieved ere this, our
wants: the other being the continuance without intermission of that spirit of
inveterat spleen and malice with which we were reduced, (remors in neither
appearing though long and until this present which with much patience and
constancy expected,) forced these desperate truths with as much modesty as
could be is performed, (our sufferings balanced) but if any part therein may
seemingly reflect upon the Parliament of England or its friends (for when we
were by Covenant bound to fight and, pray,) and shall accordingly God
assisting) being that meant in the third place let it be clear from my purpose
or theirs for whom this is undertaken and put upon the score of such degenerte
brats who design and practice what to the utmost extent of their power may to
overthrow Parliament, King, Covenant and Kingdom: Ingeniously those are the
men meant and no other, over whom in balance of that black list prepared for
us here a Scottish black list or mist stands touring for them and their
generation from whose plots, practices and designs

Great Samaritane preserve us.
FINIS.
