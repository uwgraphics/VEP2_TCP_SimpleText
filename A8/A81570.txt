A DIVINE OADE.
Bless us good Lord from that dull Sect which say,
we err in twice repeating, when we pray
Our Father
They count themselves made of the purest clod
and give us lost, forbid it O my God
which art in Heaven.
By them barnes, Stables, and what rooms you see
more then our Churches are esteemed to be
hallowed
The word the word by them, they cry is teach'd,
but grant good God by better Scholars preached
be thy Name.
The way next faith I am addressed to go
is prayer surely, which must bring me to
Thy Kingdom,
Yet let our Bells ring out, they are forgot,
for to our common prayers, they will not
come.
When I was blessed from learned Armah to hear
and honored Potter of the selfsame Sphere
thy will
Hours were but minutes, but when these persever
in tedious preachments, I think they will never
be done,
Doctrine, and use, men of a tedious rarity
which both in Church and State requires a parity
in Earth
These we must hear by Inspiration raised,
who most presumptuous think thy name so praised,
as it is in Heaven.
But Lord unto thy Sion be not cruel,
such men as Hooker, Reynolds, Whitegift, Jewel,
give us,
We have a Prideaux, Collins, and so many
their sons, more learned, no Christian Church has any
this day
By whom, if we their gifts do not abhor
we may be well instructed to pray for
our daily bread.
But these the sole Elect, long brethed men
for our sad patience do prolong again
and forgive us
That they speak not of Council, Schoolmen Father
is not their Ignorance, but rather
our trespasses
Which hinder us from things to be imparted
to none of foul, and so polluted hearted
as we
Their Semigraduats, Pedants, who knows who,
comes up to teach us, thus and then we do
Forgive them
Their first place, last place 15. times said over,
moreover, and besides, and furthermore
that trespass
Upon all Christian patience, must be heard,
or else next time a Sermon is prepared
against us,
And if Episcopacie be put down,
a Tradesman shall step up in every Town
and lead us
But where they know not, nor do greatly care
so they have their opinions, and that Bishops are
not
Good God restore them to their wits, and call
them home, whom their own naught opinions fall
into
And let not thy true Church by such as these
be brought Into, through Ignorance and ease,
Tentation,
Let inspired Cobblers, Weavers, lead them still
in their Egyptian darkness, if they will
but deliver us
Who at thy footstool prostrately full bent
and bless our King, our State and Parliament,
from evil
And for the Jesuit, Brownist, and who pray
the contrary, let Tyborne be their way
Amen.
