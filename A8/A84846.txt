FOR THE PARLIAMENT OF ENGLAND AND THEIR ARMY SO CALLED.
YOUR day into darkness is turned; the Sun is gone down over you; ye have had
a large day, and power given unto you; to have done the will of God; But you
have abused the power; and slighted your day; and you have Refused to do the
Lords w^rke and have sought to serve your selves; and not the Lord; Therefore
in Justice and Righteousness is the day wherein you might have wrought for
God; taken from you; and the thick dark night of Confusion is Come upon you;
wherein you are groping and stumbling, and cannot work, the decree is gone
out, and sealed against you; and it Cannot be Recalled; you are not the men (as
ye stand) in whom God will appear to work deliverance for his People, and
Creatures; (and yet deliverance shall Come, but not according to man's
Exspectation) But as for you, ye have Rejected the Council of the Lord; and
greeved his spirit, and he has long borne you; yea; you are departed from the
Lord, and his presence is departed from you; Indeed he has hewed with you (and
if you had been faithful to the End, he would have honored and prospered you,
and have been your sufficient Reward) ye were his Ax, but you have bosted your
selves against him; therefore as you have beaten, and hewed, and broken others,
Even so must you be beaten, hewed and broken, for you have greevously provoked
the Lord, and if he should now suffer that tree, which ye have Cut, to fall
upon you; and to break part of you, it were Just.

Oh ye Treacherous, wilful, proud, selfe-seeking people, who have despised the
Counsel of the Lord, and would not take warning though he has sent his
prophets and servants Early and Late among you, some of whom you have
Imprisoned, and despitfully used; what will ye do now, whom will you now flee
unto for help; seeing ye are departed from the Lord, and are now Rending and
tearing, biting and devouring one another, for proud ambissious self Ends;
(Mark) if ye would now build again, the thing that you once destroyed; that
shall not be able to hide, or shelter you from the wrath of the (...)abe that
way whereby you think to strengthen your selves, thereby shall you make your
selves much weaker, and help forward your own destruction; you are now, but a
Rod, Remember your End, which hastens greatly; And now Breach upon Breach,
Insurrection upon Insurrection, Overturning upon Overturning, Heaps upon Heaps,
Division upon Division shall there be; until he Come to Reign, whose Right it
is; and all Nations must bow before him; Else he will break them with his Iron
Rod.

They that trust in, or lean upon you, for help; it is as if they leaned upon
a broken Reed which is not able to help it self; nor others; indeed you have
been made to do many good things; but you would not go through with the
work, which God will have accomplished; and therefore are these things come
upon you; Therefore tremble and dread before the Lord, ye who have been as
strong Oaks, and tall Sedars; for now shall your strength fail you and you
shall be weak, even as the weakest of men, but if you would yet believe in the
light; and truly submit to Gods righteous judgments, many of you might come
to witness your souls saved, in the day of the Lord; though many of your
bodies are to be thrown by (because of your grievous backslidings) as not
counted worthy to be the Lords workmen.

There is a small remnant yet among you (for whom m^ soul breaths) who may be
winnowed out; and if they will own the judgments of the Lord, and truly and
throly deny themselves, and follow his leadings, he will heal their
backslidings; and purge them; that so they nay be instruments in his hand: But
they that will continue with you; in your sins; shall partake with you; of your
judgments.

11th month (59) From one, who am made willing b^th to suffer, and to reign
with Christ; even to follow him whether soever he goes. George Fox the younger.

The Rod of the wicked, shall not always rest upon the back of the righteous;
yet even as gould is tried; so shall they be; that they may be white, and
without spot, before the Lamb: But God will avenge their cause; and woe then
will be to their oppressors and then shall the majesty, and glory of the Lord,
fill his people (who have long been trodden under) and they shall be the dread
of all Nations, the zeal of the Lord of Hosts shall perform this.
