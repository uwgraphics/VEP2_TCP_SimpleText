To the Reader.
THE ensuing Apologetick defense of the Ministry and Ministers of the Church of
England, can hardly expect more Readers than severe Censurers; of whom some
will be wearied with the length, others offended with the freedom: some
despisers of the manner, others contradicters of the matter: In sum, it looks
for not many, or any friends; but such as are humble, judicious, and
impartial; And not a few enemies, of those that are proud, ignorant and
biassed by secular interests. So prevalent are our enemies grown even in
matters of Religion, that few can bear, either their diseases, or their
remedies. Albeit the age extremely wants, yet it can hardly endure a plain and
faithful style; though it keeps the medium between severity and flattery,
bitterness and dullness, morose antiquity and petulant novelty. It is some
men's Religion to have none settled by education or profession; Others cavil at
all that has been taught or established: Many esteem their Levity in opinions,
and inconstancy in profession to be a kind of Empire and Sovereignty in
Religion; Never thinking themselves to be, what they should be, till they are,
what they list: judging that Liberty, which is Lawlesnesse, and that freedom,
which is without fear of God, or reverence of man: calling that piety with
peace, which is the dissolving and desolating of all public society, order,
unity, and polity in Churches; crying up their later fragments, and broken
meats; being all those loaves and fishes, with which Christ has for so many
hundred of years fed his Church and people in all the world.

Others of deeper reaches taking the advantage of such popular easiness and
credulity, which is less separable from the vulgar, than shadows are from
gross bodies, study to variate and shift the extern forms and models of
Religion, until the sacred and eternal interests of Gods glory, and man's
salvation are drawn to stoop to, or forced to comply with temporary designs,
and secular policies; where Christ must be made to serve Belial; God to how
down to Mammon; the Ark must become captive to Dagon; piety turn page to
avarice; and Religion be only entertained as a lackey for Ambition; Where
there are such abasings, distortings and deformings of the beauty and rectitude
of Christian Religion, (sowring the wine of Primitive verity, simplicity, and
charity, with the vinegar of worldly jealousy, craft and cruelty) what can be
expected, as to any thing written, in behalf of Religion, and its holy
Institutions, with a plain, free, and upright genius, but only such fate and
doom, as the several humors, parties, prejudices, and worldly interests of
men will afford? which being so divided, and thwarting each other, it will be
hard to please any one, without displeasing many.

The Author therefore (who writes as addicted to no faction:) nor personally
injured, or obliged by any novel parties, but studying only to discharge a good
conscience, as to men, so chiefly toward God, (the assistance of whose Heroic
Spirit, and free grace he humbly begs through all this work) neither seeks, nor
hopes to please any men, whose passionate adherence to any sidings either in
civil or religious concernments, less inclines them to that calm, judicious,
and charitable temper, which is Scripturall, Catholic, and truly Christian;
This he only studies, this he preaches, for this he prays, this he commends,
this he admires: Not doting upon any rust or dross, which ancient and
venerable Episcopacy might in many hundred of years easily contract; and from
which it may as easily be cleared, if men impartially sought the things of
Jesus Christ, and his Churches prosperity, without gratifying any passion in
themselves or others. Nor yet does the Author any whit admire those rigid
Reformations, which some rash, envious, or ambitious Presbyters drive on; who
know not how to shave their Fathers beards without cutting their throats; nor
to pair their nails without cropping off their hands. They are unskilful
Chemists, who cannot refine from dross without consuming what is precious: And
they are pitiful Empiricks, who cannot purge without casting into Bloody
Fluxes. Nor in the last place does this Apologist so far temporise, as in the
least kind to magnify the violent breakings, and hotter meltings of any
bolder Independents; who make Religion and Reformation run to any new moulds,
which they fancy; to Separating, to Seeking, to Shaking, to nothing; that ownes
any Ordinance, order, public establ^shment, Christian communion, or holy
profession; being w^olly resolved into these two principles; the pleasing of
themselves, and the confounding of others.

Amidst these sad distractions and various confidences of men in their
opinions, and undertakings, there is no wise man, but discerns the pulse of
man's Ambition equally beating in spirits Monarchical, Aristocraticall, and
Democraticall: as in civil policies, so also in religious administrations;
some are for primacy and p^iority, others for p^ucity and parity, a third sort
for popularity and vulgarity: where as indeed the best constitution in any
government, is rather from the harmonious temperament and proportionate mixture
of all three, than from the predominance of any one, so as to oppress the
other two. Men of eminent parts are prone to affect to govern alone; without
any flatnesse or allay from inferiors: Men of moderate abilities are content
to go in a joint stock, mutually supplying those defects, to which singly they
are conscious: Men of low and mean endowments are for huddles; one and all;
where no one man is so much confident of himself, as indeed he is envious at
all others; and impatient to see any thing done without him: Whereas in true
wisdom, the eminency of the first, the mediocrity of the second, and the
meannesse yet multitudinousnesse of the third, should be fairly modelled and
composed, as the head, hands, and other members of the body are, to the common
welfare. And certainly they did of old (in the best times and tempers of
Christians) all meet in a most happy harmony, Church Order, and constitution;
no less than the humors, blood, and spirits do in healthy and vigorous
bodies: All experi^ience tells us that the disorder of any one of them, causes
sickness, weakness, or dissolution of Christian charity, society, and sweet
communion, as to their extern polity and profession of Religion.

Which sad effects, or symptoms at least of them in this Church, this Author
with grief and shame beholding, has endeavored with the greatest serenity and
expeditenesse of soul (before he leaves this Bacha and Aceldama, this valley of
tears, contention, and confusion) to ascend himself, and lead others, as much
in him lies, to the height, and top of that Primitive verity, unity and
charity, which made Christians so much admired, and venerated, even when they
were most cruelly persecuted. From which free and un-ingaged prospect, both he
and they, may with a clear and full view behold the later and worser changes in
extern matters of Religion; wherein various opinions, and different designs of
Christians have either strayed from, or quite crossed the great road of pious
and plain hearted Antiquity, which no doubt best knew, beyond all the
censorious Critics, and factious Novelists of after times, what was the mind
of the blessed Apostles, of the Primitive Martyrs and Confessors: who most
exactly followed those methods, which the Apostolical wisdom and piety had
prescribed to those Churches they planted, watered and preserved, chiefly
aiming at the Catholic good, and common benefit of all Churches.

From which, private fancies, aims and interests, afterward varying, both in
opinion and practice, occasioned those many uncomfortable, schisms, and
uncharitable factions, which (in all times, and now as much as ever) so divide
the unity, destroy the charity, and deform the beauty of Christian Religion;
That many, if not most Christians, do not only read, and hear; write, and
dispute; pray, and preach; but they believe, and repent; love, or hate; damn,
or save; communicate with, or excommunicate one another, most-what, out of
their natural constitutions, as they are of more calm and choleric tempers;
or out of those prejudices and prepossessions, which custom and education have
formed in them; or from adherence to parties and mutual agitations, whereby
they hope to drive on some worldly and secular concernments; rather than from
true and impartial principles of right reason, Scripturall precept, and
Ecclesiastical practice; which threefold cord, twisted into one, is not easily
broken: And which, beyond all disputes, affords, both in doctrine and
discipline, in opinion and practice, as to inward piety, and outward polity,
the surest measures of Religion, and bounds of conscience; which are then most
pure and unblameable, when they look directly to those great designs and ends
of every wise man and good Christian, the glory of God, the honor of Christ,
the peace of the Church, and Souls eternal welfare; without any sinister
squintings to secular ends, or warpings to worldly designs, which are the
moths of Religion, the pests of society, the overlayings of charity, and the
Incubusses of Conscience; easily seizing upon Christians of weak judgments,
and strong passions; for which we need not go far to see many and unhappy
instances.

For, what serious and well advised Christian sees not; how vehement drawings
and impulses in matters of Religion are made upon men by weak, and at first
scarce perceptible, byasses of opinions, and hopes of advantages: How, want of
solidity or sincerity is the greatest motion of violent affections in most men:
How, the less they weigh those things, they call Religion and Reformation, the
more eagerly they pursue and extol them? (The most wise and gracious men being
always the most grave and calm, the most serious and constant) Vulgar devotion
and heats, like weak fires, and dubious flames, are usually kindled by light
fuel, and fomented with fear materials; Blazing, like Comets, the more
prodigiously, by how much they have more of gross and earthly vapors.

Hence, not only the glory of outward successes, and worldly prosperities,
attending the number, policy, or prevalency of any faction, makes many
Christians, (ere they are aware of it) turn Turks, and secretly subscribe to
Mahumetanism; (which for many centuries has outvived Christianity in point of
victorious progresses, military advantages, and latitude of Empire) The current
of worldly events, like quick-tides, easily and undiscernibly carrying many
Christians from that course of pious strictness, and conscientious exactness
in truth, justice, and charity, which they ought always to steer without any
variation, according to the clear and fixed Word of God in Scripture; and not
according to his dark permissions, or unsearchable workings in providence;
which are always just and to be admired, as from the divine wisdom and
justice; but not always to be approved or imitated, as from man's wickedness
and folly; which like poisonous drugs are in themselves deadly and to be
abhorred: however the skill of the great and good Physician, God, knows how to
attemper and apply them as Physic and Theriacals, to purge, or punish; to
cure, or correct the distempers of his Church and people.

Nor is it this temptation only of events, (in which is a strong delusion,
able, if possible, to deceive the very elect; which none but steady judgments,
and exact consciences can resist;) But even the smallest differences, the most
easy and trivial considerations, which are but as the dust of the balance in
Reason or Religion, in piety or prudence, these, like motes, falling into some
men's eyes, presently appear as mountains; and so possess their sight, that
they will own nothing for Religion in any men, or any Church, which appears
not just after that color, figure and notion, which they are taken wi^hall.

How many peoples Religion consists much in the very extern modes or dressing
themselves, or others, in the fashion of their own or others clothes, for their
plainness, or costlinesse; for their novelty, or Antiquity: yea in the length,
or shortness; in the laying out, or hiding of their hair: Hence their
censures, scandals, or approbations of others; their confidences, and
oftentations of themselves, even as to piety, purity, and holiness; (which are
indeed seldom seen in ruffianly and dissolute fashions; yet, often in those
proportions of elegancy and decency, as to the outward garb, and fashion, which
some men's rusticity, severity, or slovenliness cannot bear:) Because they do
not understand, that, in things of this kind, not Scripture, but Nature gives
rules to the Religion of them; which is their usefulness and their
comeliness, 1 Cor. 11.3, 14. And this, not by any moral innate principles,
but by those (more gentium) customs of Countries, and dictates of sociall
nature, which not by written Laws, but by tacit consent and use do for the
most part prescribe what is agreeable to humanity, modesty, and civility; which
customary measures and civil rules of ornament and outward fashions in any
country, are not scrupulously to be quarrelled at; nor cynically neglected,
nor morosely retained; but may with freedom, and ingenuity be used, and
altered; according to the genius of all things, of extern mode and fashion, as
clothing, dressing, building, planting, fortifying, speaking, etc. which
depend much upon the fancies of men; and so are mutable, without any sin, or
immorality; as all things are, within the compass of mortality.

How many men's Religion lies in their admiration of some men's persons, gifts,
piety, and supposed zeal, in their being of his sect, way, body, fraternity,
and confederacy? when yet many times they have but an Idol for their God,
though they glory to have a Levite to be their Priest: Able men may have great
infirmities; and learned men gross errors; foul diseases often attend fair
faces: Doting sectaries will worship the pudenda of their Priests, and magnify
what is most dishonest, and uncomely in their ringleaders. Yea, many silly
souls we see are every where much taken with other men's ignorance, set off
merely with impudence; where the want of all true worth for ability and
authority is attended with the want of all shame and modesty; Factious spirits
in poor people makes them content to have their Religion hatched under the wing
and feathers of any foolish and unclean bird.

In how many Christians is their Religion blown up, (as the paper kites of
boys) merely with their own breath, or other men's applauses; setting off all
that is done in their way with the Epithites of rare, precious, holy, gracious,
spiritual, sweet, divine, Saint-like, etc. when yet wise men, that weigh their
boastings, evidently find, much of those men's Religion to be deformed with
Mimicall affectations of words and phrases, with studied tones, scurrilous
expressions, antic gestures, and ridiculous behaviors: Much in them is
fulsome by the length, lowdnesse, tumultuarinesse, unpreparednesse and
confusednesse even of those duties, which they count religious, holy, and
spiritual: which are so far scandalous, and suspected to sober Christians, as
they find them not only full of faction, but also destitute of that common
sense, order, comeliness, gravity, discret^on, reason and judgment, which are
to be found in others: from whom they separate not out of scruple so much as
scorn; not out of conscience, but pride and arrogance; when yet they bring
forth, after all their swelling and tympanies, nothing comparable to what
others in an orderly way have done, either for the soul and essence of
Religion, which is truth and charity; or for the body and ornament of it, so
far as it appears to others in order and decency.

Many have little that they can fancy, or call Religion in them, but only a
fierceness for that side, to which they take, a morosenesse, censoriousnesse,
and supercilious indifferency toward all, but those whom they count theirs.
Vehemently opposing, what ever Adversary they undertake; abhorring all they
do, or hold in piety or prudence; branding all they like not with the mark of
Antichrist; and crying down what ever by any Christians is diversely observed
in the fashion of their Religion: Hence many of the lowest form of Christians,
place much of their Religion, in innovating Church government; contending for
discipline; disputing against all Liturgies: in scuffling with ceremonies; in
beating the air, and fighting with the shadows of Religion: the measure of all
which, as to piety, prudence and conscience, stands in their relation to the
main end, Gods glory, the Churches peace, and the salvation of souls; which,
wherever they are with truth, holiness, order, and charity carried on in any
Church, Christians need no more scruple the extern form and manner, wherein
they are decently set forth; than they need quarrel at the room, table, or
dish, where wholesome meat is handsomely presented to them; whether in a
plainer or more costly way.

Others of more airy and elevated fancies, are altogether in Millenary dreams,
religious fantasms, Apocalyptick raptures, Prophetic accomplishments; not
caring much how they break any moral precept of Law or Gospel, if they think,
thereby they may help to fulfill a Prophecy; which every opiniaster is prone to
imagine strongly portendeth the advancement of his opinion, party, and way in
Religion; until they come to such a sovereignty, as may be able to govern and
oppress others; their Mopsicall humors being never satisfied, but in fancying
themselves as Kings, and reigning with Christ; Not in the inward power of his
grace and spirit (which is a Christians commendable ambition) joined with an
holy and humble subjection to God and man; which makes them conquerours over
the lusts in themseves, and their love of the world; whence flows the greatest
peace both to Churches and States: but in that extern worldly power and policy
which enables them to rule others, after the same bloody arts and cruel methods
of government, which Zimri, or Herod, or Alexander, or Caesar exercised: and
not the Lord Jesus Christ, who was meek and lowly, as one that served and
obeyed. And herein not only the weak, illiterate and fanatic vulgar are often
observed to act mad and ridiculous prankes in Religion; but even men of some
learning and seeming piety, often lose themselves in their wild, and melancholy
rovings; which make all Prophecies sound to their tune, and to be for their
party and opinion; though never so novell, small and inconsiderable: Nothing is
more easily abused even by easy wits, than Prophetic emblemes, and allusions,
which like soft wax are capable of several shapes and figurations, by which,
no doubt, the Spirit of God aimed at the general aspect and grand proportions
of the Catholic Church in its visible profession and outward estate: for whose
use all Scripture is wr^tten, and to whose elevation, or depression, either in
the Orthodoxie, or corruption of doctrine; in its integrity, or schisms; in
its peace, or persecution, prophecies are generally calculated; and in no sort
to those lesser occasions, obscurer events, or alterations, incident to
particular persons, countries, or Churches. It is hard to discern the Star of
Prophecy so over any one man, or place, or time, as that was over the house
where Christ was in Bethlehem; Hence many meteors, falling Stars, and fatuous
fires, are frequently discovered in the writings of fancifull and factious men;
as if all they did, or desired, or approved, were evidently foretold and
commended in the Revelation; In whose Visions one sees this Princess; another
sees that learned man; a third, that State or Kingdom; a fourth, that
Commander and Conqueror, etc. according as men list to fancy themselves, or
flatter others; whose sparks are far extinct, and their glory presently
vanishes, as no way proportionable to that fixed light and ample glory, which
the spirit of prophecy holds forth, chiefly to the Christian world, in
opposition to Heathens, Jews, or Antichrists. After the way of these Prophetic
fancies, and passionate methods of some men's misinterpreting, and misapplying
Prophecies; great Religion, we see, has been placed by small minds, in
pulling down and extirpating the ancient order and government of Episcopacy,
(which was in all Churches, as here in England, from the first plantation of
Christianity:) Also in setting up the supremacy of an headless Eldership and
Presbytery; or in dashing both of them into sheards, and small pieces by the
little stone of Independency: How do some glory in their dividing and
destroying the ancient goodly frames of Churches, that they may new model them
to their popular way of calling, choosing, and ordaining of Ministers? Many
boast much in their forsaking the calling and communion of all former Ministers
and religious assemblies; in their despising and demolishing the very places of
public meeting to serve God; (which, not conscience of any divine particular
precept, but common reason and civility have presented Christian Religion
withal, for its honor and its professors convenience.)

Some, here with us in England, (a place whose Genius much disposes people to
prophecies, novelties, and varieties) are (as Pygmalion with his Image) so
inamoured with their (Corpusculo's) the little new bodies of their gathered
Churches; that they deny any National Church in any larger associatings of
Christians, by harmonies of confession, and peaceable subordinations; yea, and
many will allow no Catholic Church; nor any religious sense to that article of
our Creed; denying any true Church at all to be now in the world. Some place
all Church power in paucities, in parities, in popular levellings, and
Independencies; others contemn all those broken bodies, as schismatic slips;
having nothing in them of that goodly beauty, stature, strength, and integrity,
to which the Church of Christ was wont to grow; and wherein it flourished and
continued conspicuous so many hundred of years; before these novelties were
broached or brewed, either in England, or any other country.

The height of some men's Religion and Reformation is, to have neither Bishops,
nor Ministers, of the ancient authority, succession, and ordination; Others
refuse these also of the new Presbyterian stamp; (which is not much older here
in England, than the figure and superscription of the last coin) A third will
have no Minister, but such as the common people shall try, choose, consecrate,
and judge. Some will have no Minister at all, by office, or divine mission:
others will have any man a Minister or Prophet that lists to make, or call
himself one. In like manner some will allow Baptism to no Infants; others to
none but such, whose parents they judge to be Saints; a third baptize the
children of all that profess they believe the truth of the Gospel; a fourth
sort deny the use of any water Baptism at all; By a Catabaptisticall boldness,
or blindness, magisterially contradicting, and sophistically disputing,
against the express letter of the Scripture; against the command of Jesus
Christ; against the practice of all the Apostles; and against the custom of all
Christian Churches: Pretending, as a rare and warm invention; that the Baptism
of fire and of the Spirit, (which they now at last hold forth) will both supply
and explode that colder ceremony of sprinkling or dipping in water. It is
strange these Rabbis and Masters in Israel should be so silly, as not to know,
that long before their brain brought forth any such blasphemous brood against
baptizing by water, all judicious Christians ever esteemed baptism by water to
be an extern sign and means, by which the wisdom of Christ thought fit to
administer to his Church on earth, not only that distinctive mark of being his
Disciples, but also the representation of his blood, shed for their redemption,
and the obsignation of that Baptismall grace, which his Spirit confers on those
that are his by the cleansing of the conscience, and renewing of the inward
man: 1 Pet. 3.21. Christians, must not after the short and more compendious
methods of their fancies, therefore neglect the sign or ceremony, because they
presume of the thing signified; but rather with humble obedience do the duty
and use the means divinely instituted, that they may obtain the grace offered.
On the same grounds, all outward Ministrations among Christians may be despised
and abolished, by those that pretend to the Spirits inward efficacy; which is
never in any man that does not obey the Gospel in its outward mandates, as
well as the Spirit in its inward motions: Proud, idle and ignorant fancies are
daily finding shorter ways to heaven than the wisdom of Christ has laid out
to his Church; in following of which no good Christian can judge, that there is
either piety, peace, or safety.

Some boast much of their popular and plausible gifts, for knowledge,
utterance, prayer, etc. others slight all, but inward grace, and the Spirits
dwelling in them. Some dote much upon their select fraternities and covenanting
congregations; others are only for private illuminations, solitary seekings,
sublime raptures, and higher assurances. Some admire themselves in their
tedious strictnesses, and severer rigors, by which they gird up the loins of
their Religion so strait, that it can hardly take civil breath, or the air of
common courtesy: others joy, as much, in the Liberty they fancy themselves to
have attained both of opinions and actions. Some make every thing a sin and
error, which they like not; others count nothing a sin, to which they have an
impulse, and are free as they call it. Some tolerate all ways of Religion in
all men, till it comes to be private Atheism, and public confusion; others
crack all strings, which will not be wound up to their pitch; damning and
destroying all, that are not of their particular mode and heresy, though never
so novel, and differing not only from the Catholic practice of the primitive
Churches, but also from the express rule of the Scriptures.

Whom would not these monsters of novelties, varieties, and contradictions
among Christians in their Religion, as it is Christian, and reformed too, even
amaze and greatly astonish? ready to scare all men from any thing, that we in
England call Religion, Reformation, Church, or Conscience; if judicious, choice
and well grounded Christians did not (as they do) seriously consider these
things, which may establish them in that holy profession of this Church,
wherein they have been baptized and educated?

First, the natural levity and instability of men's minds; magnetic needle)
but only in one point, or line; where it is in conjuncture with its Loadstone,
the Truth of God; from which, while the mind is wandering, and shaking, it is
prone to love noveltie with lies, and detriment, rather than wonted things of
religion with truth, and benefit. The itching humors of men's lascivient fancies
and lusts, choose to scratch themselves to blood and soreness, rather than
enjoy a constant soundness; which distempers among those of the reformed
Churches, never want vigilant and subtle fomenters; whose design is, to spread
any infection among Protestants to the most pestilent contagions; that so they
being sick and ashamed of themselves, under the scandals, and madnesses of that
profession, they may, at last, seek to Rome for cure; and entertain forain
Physicians; who will easily persuade such diseased Protestants, that those old
sores and lingering maladies (with which the Romish party has a long time
labored, and with which it is justly charged, however it refuse to be healed)
are much safer for souls, than these new quick fevers, pestilent Agues, and
desperate Apoplexies among us; which threaten utterly to kill all piety, to
destroy all Christianity, to extirpate all charity, and dissolve all society
both as men, and as Christians: while neither morals, nor rituals of
Christianity are observed; neither the superstructure of Catholic customs,
nor the foundation of Scripture commands; neither truth, nor peace; things of p
ety, or Christian polity, are inviolable: but all old things must be dissolved
and pass away, that some men may show their skill to create new heavens and
new earths, in which, not order and righteousness, but all injuriousnesse and
confusion must dwell.

fondness of men, which is always finding out new (evil, or vain)
inventions, (as unwholesome bodies are ever breaking out) there are also crafty
colorings, and politic affectations of piety, which grow as scurfe or scabs,
over those prurient novelties of opinion: by which unwonted forms (as with
several viZards and plasters) hypocrisy seeks as to amuse the vulgar, so to
cover, and hide its cunning, and cruelty; its avarice, ambition, revenge, and
sacrilege: still avoiding the discoveries of its deep plots and wicked
designs, by specious pretensions of serving God in some more acceptable way,
and better manner, than others have done; when indeed every true factionist,
who is Master of his Art, at last, winds up the thread of that Religion he
spins, upon his own bottom, so as may best serve his own turn; nor is he ever
so modest, so mortified, or so self-denying, with his pious novelties, but that
he will possess himself, and his party of any places for worldly profit, power
or honor, to which he can attain; though it be by the violent and unjust
ruining and outing of others: which is no very great symptom of an amended or
heightened Christian.

Lastly, sober Christians do, and ought to consider just judgments of God,
either as diseases, or medicines, usually falling upon Christians, (as here in
England) when they are surfeited with peace and plenty; cloyed with preaching
and praying; wantonly weary of wonted duties, and wholesome forms of sound
religion, though never so holy, and comely; Burdened with the weekly and daily
importunities of Ministers doctrine, and examples, (where the sin and misery
was; not that people had no true light, or no true Church, and no true
Ministers, but that, having all these, they rejoiced not in them, they
neglected them, and sinned the more provokingly against them;) Hence it is,
that squeamish, nauseating, and glutted Christians, easily turn, as foul
stomachs and wanton appetites, all they take, (though never so wholesome) into
peccant and morbifique humors, to pride and passion; to self conceit, and scorn
of others; to ambitious lusts of disputing, contending, and conquering in
matters of Religion; endeavoring to destroy all, that they and their way may
alone prevail and govern: which is the last result of all unwarrantable and
unjustifiable commotions in Church or State. Nor do men ever intend that such
victories (which begin with the tongue or pen, and end in the hand and sword:
commencing with piety and religion, but concluding with sovereignty and
dominion) shall be either inglorious or fruitless; Seditious and schismatic
Champions for Religion will be sure (as soon as they have power) to carve out
their own crowns and rewards; the determination of scruples in conscience, and
differences in opinion, must end, not only in imperious denying others, the
liberties of conscience (at first craved or contended for) but in the outing
others of different minds, from their places, callings, profits, and
enjoyments: which is very far from that taking up the cross of Christ and
following him; from being crucified to the world in its lusts, pride and
vanity, as becomes those that will be Christ's Disciples, in verity, justice,
and charity: To such mountains of changes and mighty oppressions do little
mole-hils in Religi^^ ^ually swell, when the justice of God suffers piety to
(...) both poisoned with policies, and Religion perverted with humane passions.
Little differences in Religion, (like Crocodiles eggs) bring forth prodigies;
which are ever growing greater, till they dye; adding fury to faction; passion
to opinion; cruelty to novelty; Self-interests to Conscience: Divine vengeance
often punishing sin with sin; extravagancies of judgments, with exorbitancies of
deeds; suffering the greater lust, or stronger faction (like pikes in a pond)
to devour the lesser; and one error to be both executioner and heir to
another; Because men obeyed not the Truth in love, nor practiced what they
knew, with a pure heart, in an humble, meek, and charitable conversation, which
always chooses rather to suffer with peaceful and holy antiquity, than to
triumph with turbulent and injurious novelty.

From which have risen those many Church-Tragedies, as of ancient, so of later
times, which make the blood of Christians, (yea of Jesus Christ too) so cheap
and vile in one another eyes: Hence those unstanched effusions; those unclosed
wounds; those irreconcilable fewds; those intractable sores; those wide gaping
gulphs of faction and division, malice and emulation, war and contention, which
are enlarged and deep like hell, threatening to swallow up and exhaust whole
kingdoms, flourishing Nations, and famous Churches; sometimes professing
Christian, and reformed Religion, with order, peace, and truth. Where now
countrymen, and neighbors, kindred and brethren, Ministers and people,
teachers and disciples, are so far from that charity, sympathy and compassion
becoming beleivers in Jesus Christ, (so as to weep with those that weep, and to
rejoice with those that rejoice) that contrarily, there is nothing almost to be
heard or seen, but such a face of cruelty and confusion, as a shipwreck, a
troubled Sea, or Scarefire is wonted to present: The tears of some mingled
with their own, or others blood; the cries and sighs of some with the
laughter of others: smiles with sorrows, hopes with despaires, joys with
terrors, Lamentations of some with the triumphs of others. The insolency of any
prevailing faction hardly enduring the underling or suppressed party, to plead
their cause, either by law or prepossession: to deplore their losses, defeats,
poverties, and oppressions; which they either feel or fear; nor yet to enjoy
the liberty of their private consciences: And all this struggling, fury and
confusion both in Church and State merely to bring forth, or to nourish up some
Pharez or Esau; some opinion or faction, which must come in by a breach, and
prevail by violence. After this horrid scene and fashion, and on such Theaters
(of mutual massa crings, fightings and wars) are divided Churches, broken
factions, and uncharitable Christians always ready to act their sad and
sanguinary parts of Religion; (if there be not wise and powerful Magistrates,
to curb and restrain them.) Some men's spirits are ever dancing in the circles
of Reformations; trampling on the ruins of Churches and States, of charity and
peace; lost in endless disputes, and wearied with restless agitations;
starting many things, and long pursuing nothing: Ever hunting for novelties,
and following with eagerness and lowdnesse the game they last sprang, or put
up, till they light on another: Still casting away all that is old, though
never so good and proper, for any thing that is new, though never so bad and
impertinent: being better pleased with a fools coat of yesterdayes making,
though never so fantastic and ridiculous; than with the ancient robes of a
wise and grave Counselor, never so rich, and comely; preferring a rent or
piece of Christ coat before the whole and entire garment.

Thus, ever learning, fancying, cavilling, contending, disputing, and, if they
can, destroying one another for matters of religion, poor mortals and
consumptionary Christians tear others, and tire out themselves, until (having
thus wasted the fervor of their spirits, and more youthful activity of their
lives) at length the dullness of age, or the burden of infirmities, or the
defeat of their designs, or the decline of their faction, or the wasting of
their estates, or the conscience of their follies, or the summons of death, so
dispirit and appale these sometimes so great Zealots and sticklers, for what
they call Religion, that they appear like very Ghosts, and Carkuses of
Christians; poor, blind, naked, withered, deformed, and tattered in their
Religion, both as to Conscience comfort, and credit; Far enough (God knows)
from that soundness of judgment, that setlednesse in the faith, that
soberness of Zeal, that warmth of charity, that constancy of comfort, that
sincerity of joy, that saintlike patience, that blessed peace, and that lively
hope, which becomes and usually appears in those, that have been, and are
sincerely religious and truly gracious; that is, knowing, serious, and
conscientious Christians; who have, a long time, been entertained, not with
splendid fancies, and specious novelties, wrested prophecies, and rare
inventions; touching government of Churches, modelling of Religion, and Saints
reigning: but with the treasures of divine wisdom; with the rivers of
spiritual pleasures; with the fullness of heavenly joys; with the sweetness
of Christ's love, and Christians communion: with the feasts of faith unfeigned;
with the banquets of well grounded hope, with the marrow and fatness of good
works; of an useful holy life: which are to be had not in fantastique
novelties, and curious impertinencies, in unwarrantable and self-condemning
practices; but in the serious study of the Scriptures; in the diligent
attending on the Ministry of the Word, and all other holy duties; in fervent
and frequent prayers; in Catholic communion with charity toward all that
profess to be Christians; in a patient, meek, orderly, just, and honest
conversation toward all men whatsoever.

From which, whoever swerves, though with never so specious and successful
aberrations, which vulgar minds may think gay and glorious novelties of
Religion, like the flying of Simon Magus, or Mahomets ecstasies; yet they are to
be pitied, not followed, by any children of true wisdom; which is from above,
both pure and peaceable, Jam. 3.17. Whose lawful progeny, the professors of
pure Religion, and undefiled, have in all times been, as in worth far
superior, so in number and power often inferior to the spurious issues, and
by-blowes of faction and superstition; which, as easily fall into fractures
among themselves, as they naturally confederate against that only true and
legitimate offspring of Heaven, True Religion: which is (as the Poets feigned
of Pallas) the daughter of the Divine mind; the descent and darling of the
true God; For, as it has been wonderfully brought forth, so it has always
been tenderly brought up, by that power, wisdom, and love, which are in those
eternal relations, infinite perfections, and essential endearements,
wherewith the Divine Nature everlastingly happy, recreates and enjoyes it self;
which are set forth to us under the familiar names, yet mysterious and adorable
Persons of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; in whom is an holy variety with an
happy Unity; a real diversity, yet an essential identity: Who have taught the
Church true Religion in a few words: Know and do the will of God: Believe and
repent; Live in light, and love; in verity and charity; in righteousness and
true holiness: without which all Religion is vain; either fanstaticall, or
hypocritical, unprofitable, or damnable.

From which plain paths and grand principles of true Christian Religion the
Author of this defense, having observed the great and confused variations of
many Christians, as in all ages, so never more than in this; his intent in this
work must be, and is, (as he said) Not to gratify any side or faction, never
so swollen with plausible pretensions, with pleasant fancies, with gainful
successes; or overgrown with splenitick severities, and melancholy discontents:
but only to make good by the impartiality of clear Scripture, sound Reason,
and purest Antiquity, that station, and office, wherein the providence of God
has placed him, (and many others, far his betters) in the public Ministry of
that Religion, which as Christian and reformed, was established and professed
here in the Church of England. Which, of any Reformed Church, has ever since
the Reformation had the honor, of being, both much admired, and mightily
opposed: So that its miraculous peace, and prosperity for so many years past,
as they were the effects of Gods indulgence; and of the great wisdom of
governors in Church and State; so they were always set off and improved by
those many and smart oppositions, both forain and domestic, which were made
against it, both as to its truth and peace, its doctrine and discipline.

All which, men of excellent learning, and lives in this Church, have valiantly
sustained, and happily repelled; to the great advancement of Gods glory, the
prosperity of this Nation, the honor of this reformed Church, and the comfort
of all judicious Christians; And this was chiefly done by the able and accurate
pens of the godly and learned Ministers; who needed (in those times) no other
defense on their part, either for order, government, maintenance, Ministry or
doctrine; All which were then preserved from vulgar injuries and insolences by
the same power and sword, which defended those civil sanctions and laws,
which established and preserved all things of sacred and Ecclesiastic, as well
as of civil and secular concernment.

Until these last fatal times, which pregnant with civil wars and
dissensions, have brought forth such great revelations and changes in Church
and State; wherein Scholars and Churchmen, in stead of pens and books, have to
contend with swords and pistols. Which weapons of carnal warfare, were
unwonted to be applied either to the planting, propagating, or reforming of
Christian Religion; only proper to be used for the preservation of what is by
law established, from seditious and schismatic perturbations; (For it was
not the vinegar, but the oil of Christian Religion; not its fierinesse, but its
meekness; not its force, but its patience, that ever made its way through the
hardest rocks, and hearts.) And by these strange Engines, these new arms of
flesh, we have hitherto only seen acted and fulfilled with much horror, misery
and confusion, those things in this Church and Nation, which were foreseen and
foretold by two eminent, and learned persons, yet of different opinions, as to
the extern matters of Ecclesiastical polity; Mr. Richard Hooker, and Mr.
Thomas Brightman; the one in the preface to his Ecclesiastical polity: the
other in his comment on the third chapter of the Revelations. Who many years
ago in times of peace, and setlednesse in this Church of England foretold, not
by any infallible spirit of prophecy, (for then the later of them would not
have been so much mistaken in the fate of his dear Philadelphia of Scotland)
but merely out of prudence, conjecturing, what was probable to come to pass,
according to the fears of the one, and the hopes of the other: in case the then
spreading, though suppressed differences and parties in Religion, (which they
then saw made many Zealously and boldly discontented) came to obtain such
power, as every side aims at, when they pretend to carry on matters of
Religion, and Reformation; wherein, immoderation being usually styled Zeal; and
moderation, lukewarmnesse; it was easy for sagacious men to foresee and
foretell, what excesses, the transports of inferiors would in all probability
urge upon superiors; if ever these managed power so weakly and unadvisedly,
that any aspiring and discontented party might come to gain power, in a way not
usual; which at the very first rupture and advantage, would think it self
easily absolved from all former ties of obedience, and subjection to governors
in Church or State; without which liberty and absolution, it is not possible to
carry on by force any Novelties and pretended amendments of Religion contrary
to what is established in any Church or Nation.

Indeed, we see, to our smart and sorrow; that the deluge foretold would break
in, has so overflowed this and the neighbor Churches; that not only Mr.
Brightmans blear-eyed Leah, his odious Peninnah, his so abhorred Hierarchy,
(the Episcopal order and eminency) but even his beloved Rachel, his admired
Hannah, his divine Presbytery it self; yea and the whole function of the
Ministry feels, and fears the terror of that inundation, which far beyond his
divination, has prevailed, not only over his so despised Laodicea, which he
made to be type of the Church of England, (truly) not without passion and
partiality, (as I think with far wiser men) He not calmly distinguishing
between the constitution and execution of things: between the faults of
persons, and the order of places: between what was prudentiall, and what is
necessary; what is tolerable, and what is abominable in any Church, as to its
extern form and polity: but also over his darling and so adored Philadelphia;
which he makes to answer to the Scottish, Palatinate or Geneva form of
Presbyterian government and discipline; as if that Church of Philadelphia in
its primitive constitution under the presidency and government of its Angel,
had any thing different from, or better than the other neighbor Churches;
which is no way probable, nor appears either in Scripture or Ecclesiastical
histories; However, it might be commendable in its Angel or President, for its
greater zeal and exacter care to preserve that doctrine, discipline, and order,
which it had lately received from the Apostles; and which, no doubt, was the
same in each Church, who had their several Angels or Overseers alike; which
all Antiquity owned for those Pastors, Presidents, or Bishops, to whose charge
they were respectively committed.

As for that evomition, or Gods spewing this Church of England out of his
mouth, which Mr. Brightman so dreadfully threatens; It must be confessed that
the sins of all sorts of Christians in this Church, and of Ministers as much as
any, have made them nauseous and burdensome to the Divine patience; both in
their lukewarm formalities, and fulsome affectations of Religion; in their
empty pompes, and emptier popularities: So that Gods patience once turned into
just fury, has indeed terribly powered out his vengeance on all degrees and
estates in this Nation: by suffering floods of miseries, and billows of
contempt to overwhelm (for a time) the face of this Church, (as of old wars,
heresies, and schisms wasted the Asiatick, African, and Latin Churches) not
more, it may be, upon the account of Ministers weakness and unworthiness,
than upon that of peoples levity, pride, and ungrateful inconstancy; which
has been a great means to bring on and continue these overflowing streams:
Which nothing but the mighty power of God, by the help of good and wise men,
can rebuke and assuage; so that the face of this Church and its Ministry may
yet appear in greater beauty and true Reformation, after its so great squallor,
and deformity: which is not to be despaired of, through Gods mercy; yet in a
far other way than ever Mr. Brightman foresaw.

But when, and by what means this shall be done, the Author of this Apology
does not, as a Prophet, undertake to foretell; only he observes the usual
methods of Gods Providence, in the midst of judgment to remember mercy: and
after he has sorely afflicted, to repent of the evil, and return to an humble
penitent people, with tender mercies; so that we may hope his wrath will not
endure for ever; nor that he has quite forgotten to be gracious, or shut up
his loving kindness in displeasure. Also he considers the wonted
vicissitudes of humane affairs, arising from the changes incident to men's
minds, who weary of those disorders and pressures necessarily attending all
forcible changes in Church or State; and long frustrated with vain expectations
of enjoying those better conditions in things civil and religious, which are
always at first liberally promised and expected; at last they are prone with
the same impetuosity, to retire, (as the ebbing Sea) from those fallacious or
pernicious novelties, to which the breath of some politic or passionate
spirits had raised them, so much above the ordinary mark of true Christian
religion, as to drown or threaten to carry away all those many happy enjoyments
of truth, peace, order, government, and Ministry, which formerly they enjoyed:
Not wholly (it may be) without; but yet with fewer and more tolerable
grievances; which humble Christians ought to look upon in any settled Church and
State, rather as exercises of their patience, duty, and charity; than as
oppressions of their spirits: Knowing that impatience usually punishes it
self, by applying remedies sharper than the sufferings; easily and hastily
running down the hill, as from health to sickness, from peace to war, from
good to bad, from bad to worse; but very slowly returning from evil to good,
or recovering up the hill, from worse to better.

It is true, the Ministers of the Church of England, of all degrees, seem, now,
to have an harder part to act, for their honor and wisdom, than ever they had
under any Rulers, professing to be Christian and reformed. But they may not
therefore weakly disclaim, or meanly desert their Ordination and holy function;
nor may they despair of Gods (if they have not man's) protection, who can soon
make their very enemies to be at peace with them; and stir up many friends
unexpectedly for them. It may be through the Lords mercy, this winters flood
shall be for their mendment or fertility, and not for their utter vastation and
ruin: This fire shall not consume them, but refine them; this winnowing will
be their purging; and this shaking their settling: (As oppositions of old gave
the greatest confirmations and polishings to those Truths, which were most
exercised with the hammer, or file of heriticall pravity, or schismatic fury.

If it be the mending, and not the ending; the reformation, and not the
extirpation of Ministers, which their severe censurers and opposers seek for:
why should not time of trial be given; and all honest industry used to improve
these well grown and flourishing fig trees, before they be hewed down and
stubbed up; which heretofore have not been either barren or unfruitful to God
and man?

If either Papal, or Anabaptisticall and Levelling enemies must at length
after several windings and turnings be gratified with their utter ruin and
destruction, (which God forbid) yet while Ministers have leave and liberty to
pray, to preach, to print, to do well, and worthily, God forbid they should so
far injure God, good men, and so good a cause, as not Christianly to
endeavor its defense; which at worst is to be done by comely suffering: And
who knows but that when these witnesses both against superstition and confusion
in the Church shall seem to be slain, cast out, and buried, they may live
again, to the astonishment both of friends and enemies?

But if the sins of this Nation, and the decrees of divine Justice, do indeed
hasten an utter overthrow here of the reformed Ministry, and the reformed
Religion: If Ministers of the ancient Ordination, lawful heirs of the true
Apostolic succession, are therefore accounted as sheep for the slaughter,
because they are better fed, and better bred, than others of leaner souls, and
meaner spirits: If they are therefore to the men of this world, as a savor of
death unto death, because they hold forth the Word of Truth, and Life, to the
just reproach of a lying, dying, and self-destroying generation: If we must at
last perish and fall, with our whole function and fraternity, after all our
studies, charges, labors, and sufferings: Yet, it is fit some of us (and the
more the better, lest our silence may argue guilt) give the world both at
present, and in after ages some account; why, and how in so learned, valiant,
wise, and religious a Nation as this of England has been, we as Ministers
have stood so long; what pious frauds, and holy arts we had, whereby to impose
so many hundreds of years, upon so many wise Princes; so many venerable
Parliaments; so many pious professors of Christian and reformed Religion: And
lastly, upon so quick and high spirited a people, as these of England generally
are; neither so gross, as to be easily deluded, nor so base, as patiently to
suffer themselves in so high a nature to be abused.

That so, at least if the world can less discern, for what cause the Ministry
and Ministers are now to be destroyed, they may see upon what grounds of piety,
or policy they were so long preserved in peace, plenty, and honor: And for
what reasons they now seek (as their pious predecessors did) to maintain not
their persons so much, as their office and function, in its due order and
authority; that so they might have transmitted it in an holy and unblameable
succession to posterity; as that, which in their consciences they verily think
to be a most divine and Christian Institution: Beneficial for the good of the
Church, and of all mankind; which in former ages, was ever esteemed the glory,
and blessing of this, or any other Nation; The setter forth of the light,
wisdom, power, and love of the eternal God in his Son Jesus Christ for the
salvation of sinners; and which thousands of Christians in all ages and places
have experienced, and approved to be to their souls the Savor of life unto
life, the mighty power of God to salvation.

The Author easily observes the present face of our heavens; which are much
darkened by those black, and lowering clouds, which chiefly hang over constant,
true, and faithful Ministers heads; menacing them above any rank or calling of
men; Nor is he ignorant of the touchinesse, and roughness; the jealousies, and
timorousness, of many men's spirits in these times, whose highest pretentions
to piety are set forth, either by fierce oppositions against the Ministry; or
by such a weak pleading for, and wary owning of their succession and
ordination, their calling and persons, as rarather invites opposition,
contempt, and insolency, than any way gives credit or countenance to them and
their function; whose remaining branches of Presbytery will hardly thrive by
the watering of those hands which have been, and are destroyers of its root,
the Primitive Apostolical Episcopacy; they are pitiful defenders of that, who
are passionate opposers of this: who, of all men, have given the greatest
advantages to those that seek to abrogate the whole function and calling, or to
arrogate it to vulgar ignorance and impudence.

The grim and sad aspect on all hands upon Ministers, makes the Author out of
charity to himself and others, as willing to give a fair account of his
profession, so loath to offend any sober and judicious Reader, or to contract
the enmity of any others of ruder tempers, by any rash stroke or inconsiderate
dash of his pen, to which he may be subject, and for which he begs pardon, both
of God and man, if any have escaped; which yet may be so far venial, as its
innocent sharpness aims at no men's person, but only at their supposed errors,
which are grown in some so rough and insolent, both in words and deeds, against
poor Ministers, that they had need to meet with something, that has good
metal and useful sharpness; and not with that phlegmatic and sanguine
softness, which impudent men easily baffle and put both to the blush and
silence: yet he meddles not, save with great respect and tenderness, with any
thing of Civil Power; which no man may wisely dispute, that is not able to
resist, (it is foolish to shake the pen against the sword, or oppose armed
Legions with flocks of Geese;) No man may discreetly offend, while, as he must
necessarily, so he may honestly and safely be subject: Prudence commands
private men to leave the accounts of Ruling power to men's own consciences, and
to the Supreme Over-ruler; who best knows, as by what means they obtain it, so
to what ends, and in what manner they use it. It is enough for private persons
at convenient distances to warm themselves by the light and heat of prevailing
power; neither scorching themselves by too near approaches; nor consuming
themselves by indiscreet contestations with it: Modesty also forbids such as
are in subjection to dispute the actions, or disparage the counsels of any that
are above them; who being many and so stronger, are commonly by esteem supposed
wiser than any one man: and being successful are usually esteemed blessed and
happy. Although it is most certain, That the many beginning from one, and
combined strength or counsel being but the twisting of single feebleness (as
so many hairs together) the united many may be mistaken, as well as the divided
unites; Yea, one sick man may infect many whole: especially if his disease has
something catching and pleasing in it. But if there happen, by the Divine
displeasure, pestilent airs, and noxious breaths in any country, the strong,
the wise, the great and the many, are as liable to contagion and destruction,
as the weak, the few, and the foolish: yea to Epidemicall and contagious
diseases, pestered cities, and crowds of men are more subject, than cells, and
solitudes. No men are so wise, but they may have errors; And the sooner they
see them to amendment, the wiser they will be: Nor is it the least part of
wisdom in inferiors to show to superiors their misapprehensions and failings,
rather by obliquely intimating than directly thwarting; by great reflections,
than rude affronts: Especially in those things wherein a private man may be
competently versed, both by study and education; yet no way trenching upon that
tender point of civil power and dominion, which is not a fit subject for a pen
and inkhorn.

Therefore this Author presumes, that the fair and free vindication of so
public an interest, as this of the Ministry (which is his proper sphere and
calling) can displease no men, that have candor, wit, honesty, honor, good
conscience, or true Religion in them: Nor will it anger sober men to be showed
what is amiss, and how it may be mended; which possibly they may be as unable,
as willing to do; Diseases may sometimes exceed the Art of Physicians; violent
Paroxysms are sometimes better left to spend themselves, than provoked and
encountered with medicines. As for others of vain, violent, and foolish tempers,
it is better to offend than to flatter them; and to suffer from them (if God
will have it so) is more honorable, than to be rewarded by them.

The greatest danger indeed is, from those, that are (stolide feroces) full of
those boisterous, rude and brutish passions, which grow as bristles upon hogs
backs, from ignorance, pride, rusticity, and prejudice; which make men, either
unable to read, or impatient to bear, or unwilling to understand, the words of
truth and soberness; trusting more to bestiall than rational or religious
strength: which most unmanly, and unchristian disorders in men's souls, how
prevalent and epidemicall soever they may be, yet they must not be here either
flattered, or fomented: By calling their darkness light, or their evil good;
their presumptions, inspirations; their duller dreams high devotion; their
dissolute licentiousness, Christian liberty; their silliness, sanctity; their
fierceness, zeal; their self-confidence and intrusion, a divine call; their
disorderly activity, special abilities; their jejune novelties, precious
rarities; or their old errors, and rotten opinions, extraordinary and unheard
of perfections.

When, indeed, their root is for the most part nothing but an illiterate and
illiberall disposition; neither learned to morality, nor polished to civility;
neither softened nor settled by good education or true Religion: being full of
levity, vulgarity, unsatiate thirst and desire of novelties; their fruit also
is little else, but malice, cruelty, avarice, ambition, worldly policy,
hypocrisy, superstition, looseness, and profaneness; all conspiring, as upon
untrue and unjust pretentions, so to evil ends; namely to abase and destroy
the true and ancient Ministry of the Gospel in this Nation, and to bring into
contempt all holy duties, and divine Ministrations in this Church of Christ; to
cry down all good learning; to corrupt the minds of men with error and
ignorance; to debauch their manners by licentiousness, or superstition; to
bring shame upon the reformed Religion here professed; to wilder the
judgments, to wast the comforts, to shipwreck the conscience, and to damn the
souls of poor people.

Where the Apologist meets with this black guard, these factors for error and
sin, these agitators for the Prince of darkness, these enemies to God, to
Christ Jesus, to all good Christians, and to mankind, God forbid he should give
place to them, or not charge them home, and resist them to their face: His duty
and design is to detect their frauds and wickedness; to countermine their deep
projects; to frustrate their desperate counsels; to fortify the minds of all
good Christians against their strong delusions, and oppositions; to pull down
their high imaginations; to demolish their self-conceited strong holds; to
maintain the honor of this Nation, the glory of this reformed Church, and the
worth of its godly, learned, and industrious Ministry, against their envious
cavils and ungrateful calumnies.

If any men, apart from fanatic presumptions, secular interests, popular
applauses, rusticall clamors, and ignorant confidences, shall, upon rational,
prudent, and religious grounds, propound any thing in a more excellent way,
either for kind, or degree, whereby to advance the glory of God, the honor of
Jesus Christ, the real propagating of the Gospel, the exercise of useful
gifts, and graces of Gods Spirit in this Church r the increase of charity, or
comforts among Christians; for the encouragement of learning, virtue and
godliness; for the welfare of this Nation, or the serious reforming of
Religion, and the Ministry of it, beyond what has been, still is, and ever may
be had, from the gifts and graces, the order and office, the labors and lives
of those, that are the chief professors, preachers, and pillars of learning and
religion in this Nation; which are the able, and faithful Ministers of a due
succession and right Ordination;

God forbid they should not, with all candor and impartiality be heard, with
all cheerfulness accepted, and with all uprightness be entertained; No good
man or worthy Minister is so vain, as to fancy he may not be mended, and
happily improved: But first let those alterations and novelties, which bear
this title of reformation, and amendment, be publicly set forth; duly,
seriously, and impartially be weighed in the balance of sober demonstrations,
and sound reasonings, so, as becomes the honor, wisdom, and piety of this
Nation; before they be injuriously concluded, and forcibly obtruded upon
conscientious Ministers, or people. The English world (as other Protestant
Churches) has had enough of the Apes and Peacocks, which crafty Merchants have
ever sought to vend to the vulgar: if they have any gold and spices; any
commodities that are of real use and worth; it is pity, the worlds wants have
not been sooner supplied, and their expectations satisfied; which being so long
deluded, and often frustrated, has made sober Christians to suspect the whole
freight of some men's religious novelties, to be nothing else but far fetched and
dear bought toys, variating so much from the uniform judgment, and universal
practice of all ancient and modern Churches, of the best note and account, no
less, than from the worthy constitution, and wise frame of this reformed
Church of England, whose honor and renown was justly great in the Christian
world, for its piety and peace, its order, and its proficiency in all good
learning, sound doctrine, and holy manners: which owed as much, as any Church
under heaven, to the wisdom, piety, and impartiality of its Ministers and
reformers (under God) as also to its establishers and defenders.

Nor have the effects of later offers and endeavors to mend or change their
work, been yet so excellent or blessed, as to give any cause to prefer these,
before them; who no doubt could easily have reached those later seeming heights
and raptures of Religion and Reformation, which some men so much boast of, in
their hotter, yet looser tempers; but those learned, grave and godly men
considered, in the extern polity and frame of Religion, what was then most
necessary, and convenient for men and times, what latitudes of prudence and
grains of charity are to be allowed by Christian piety: Not prescribing their
plat-formes, then fitted to the public good, as the Non ultras of
Reformation; but giving posterity a pattern; that, if we would indeed attain to
further perfection, we should imitate their wise and charitable moderation; and
tread in their humble, easy, and even steps; which were not slippery with
blood, nor rough with insolences, nor unequal with factions, nor dark with
policies, nor extravagant with varieties; but fairly laid out, and freely
carried on by due authority, with public and impartial counsels, in a
peaceable way, to a general uniformity, and satisfaction of both the most, and
the best.

Whereas, among the many specious offers, and earnest importunities, either
formerly, or lately made by some men in reference to Rel gion, and the Ministry
of it in this Church, little has hitherto appeared to have any uniform or
well-formed face of further edification, or future bettering of Religion, in
doctrine, government, discipline, or manners. Some few, it may be, of honest
hearts have taken to themselves a liberty to serve God in that way they best
fancy and most affect; But thousands have run to error, ignorance, atheism and
licentiousness, under that color of freedom; which besides the laxation and
confusion brought among the bad, has occasioned great heart-burning and
distance and uncharitableness among those that seemed to be good. In some
things indeed sober and wise men have offered good counsel; and propounded
some things fit to be considered of and embraced; but the noise and violence of
other (men's passions and interests) suffer not those men's calmer voices to be
heard; Their rougher work seems to be all with axes and hammers; not for
building or repairing the Temple of God, without noise; but for beating all
down, with the greatest stir, and clamor they can make; All is for demolishing
Schools and Universities; for despising all learning and sciences; for taking
away all order, society, larger communion, subordination, and government in the
Church; for casting away all ancient Ordination, and authoritative Ministry;
that we may be left in the next age, like the Tohu and Bohu of the Chaos, void
of light and full of confusion; without good learning or true Religion, without
any form, or power of godliness; So far are those lines, which the
Antiministeriall fury and folly draws, from running parallel to piety, or
Christianity, to right Reason or true Religion; that they are most
diametrically opposite to all civility, prudence, policy, sense of honor, and
principles of humanity: Of which deformities and defects none are less patient
to hear, than they that are most guilty; whose preposterous activity, rather
than sit still, must needs employ it self in pulling all down; which is indeed
the work of plebeian hands, and pragmaticall spirits; but to build or repair
either Church or State, is the business only of wise and well advised
persons, such as having public and general consent, to deliberate of such
things, may also have an universal influence in the reason and authority of
their determinations: But such able men are hardly found in Country crowds,
and illiterate heaps; nor are they very forward to obtrude themselves upon
public works, without a very fair call from God, and man; which they do not
think to be the either countreymans whistle, or the armed man's trumpet.

From neither of which, as this Author has any invitation to this work; so he
has no temptation in it, to captate favor with the giddy and uncertain
vulgar; by seeming to adore their Diana's, or admire their many new masters,
and their rarer gifts; which make them worthy indeed of such soft and
sequacious disciples.

Nor yet has he any design to ingratiate with supercilious, and
self-suspecting greatness; or to comply with the more solemn errors, and
graver extravagancies of those, who study safety, more than piety; who think to
flatter Magistrates by crying down Ministers, being more afraid of that sword,
which can but kill the body; than of that, which proceeds out of the mouth of
Christ, and is able to slay both soul and body.

He bespeaks no men further, than the truth, justice, and merit of this cause
of the Evangelicall Ministry, made good by Scripture, Antiquity, and good
experience among us here in England, may persuade them to look favorably, and
friendly on the Author and his endeavor: wherein, albeit every one, that
ownes himself to be a Christian in this Church, is highly concerned; yet the
undertaking seems to have very little tempting in it, or inviting to it; as
(now) the face of the Ministry of the Church of England seems to appear
besmeared, and disguised with infinite odious aspersions; laden with unmerited
injuries and indignities; a wonder to its enemies and friends; a sad spectacle
to all good men and good Angels; (whom it cannot but afflict to see those that
are the Brethren of Angels in heaven, Revel. 19.10. and the fathers of
Christians on earth, 1 Cor. 4.15.) thus treated and threatened by some men, who
have this only of proportion and equity in them, to pursue the greatest
virtues, with the greatest hatred.

The Apologist therefore has purposely declined to bring the odium or envy of
Dedication upon any one particular person; lest this defense should seem like
a blazing Star, threatening with malignant influence any man's greatness, and
honor, either of ancient or modern edition; which may be jealous, lest the
patronising, or pleading for the distressed, and despised Ministry, should be
the next way to their diminution; lest the dust and rubbidge of the so much
battered and defaced Clergy, should deform or bury them. Besides, he thought it
in vain to single out any one Patron to this book, and its Subject: For first
how few persons of more ample conditions, splendider fortunes, and higher
quality in civil estimation, do much lay to heart the afflictions of these
Joseph's, godly Ministers and good scholars: Most are intent to their policy,
profit, or pleasure; or to their sufferings, revenges, and reparations: Nothing
costs a gross spirited Gentleman, who lives like a great earth worm in a fat
dunghill, less, either as to his purse, or his care, than the interests of
Learning or Religion; The ignorance and dissoluteness of many makes them
indifferent, if not enemies to piety and good education; as lights that
reproach their deformities, or bonds that restrain their exorbitancies; Some
are best pleased when least molested by any moral or gracious importunities:
esteeming those their best friends, who suffer them to degenerate to beasts, or
to devils; or to both, at once, in being Hypocrites or Atheists: who have the
stupidnesse of the beast, and the malice of the devil.

Not that I would diminish the honor of the Nobility and Gentry of this
Nation, the good and gallant sort of whom none in the world exceeds for
civility, fidelity, justice, constancy, and piety. Though some be the shame of
honor, and the stain of Gentry, as bags of chafe, puffes of airy vanity,
illiterate vice, insolent ignorance, and folly well fed: who have nothing to
boast of but empty names of reproached ancestors and undeserved titles, which
are comely when inscribed on the Escucheon of virtues, but deformed and
ridiculous, when usurped by pultroones, and such, whom no worth redeems from
being vile and despicable to wise and serious minds. Yet there are not a few
eminent persons of true honor and real worth (which consists in just valor,
judicious piety, useful virtues, both to private and public relations) whose
purses have been as cruses, and their houses sanctuaries to many godly and
learned men in the distresses of these times. Yet in stead of paying a respect
and honor to any of these truly noble and generous persons it might be but an
injury to single out any one of them, in the cloud and jealousies of these
times, to be as a public refuge and Asylum to this work and its cause; which
carries with it something more immense and ponderous, than ordinary occurrences
in the world: And besides its high concernment to Church and State; to the
temporal and eternal good of men; it has vast difficulties attending it;
rough oppositions, implacable odiums, and incorrigible malices to contend with:
In the midst of all which there must needs be a very great deadness, and
almost despair, for any one man never so worthy and well-affected, to advance
beyond honest desires, and sincere, but ineffectuall endeavors.

Furthermore to take a right scantling of things; what one man's shoulders, I
beseech you, how potent soever, can bear the burdens, which are now cast upon
the Ministry and Ministers of this Church of England? What hands can raise
their declined state; what arms can support, or stay their tottering and
threatening ruins? Alas, what private influence can be so benign, as to
oversway, or counterpoise that malignity, which some men pretend to discover,
not only in the minds of men on earth, but even in the very Stars and
constellations of heaven, which, some say, fight against the Ministry now, as
they sometime did against Sisera? If these Western wise men (who seem to be of
a different strain and way from those Eastern Magi, that came to worship Christ
in the Manger, with their persons, and presents) if I say they had not daily
intelligence from heaven, and sat near to the Cabinet Council of that High
Court; truly good Christians would hardly believe, or regard their reports; It
being very improbable, that the Stars, either fixed or planetary, should be
enemies to those, who bear their name in the Church; as Ministers do, being
called both Stars and Angels, Revel. 3.1. And who have ever been, as much
brighter in their light, so more necessary to the Church, and more dear to God,
than those are in the Firmament or visible heavens; by how much the
intellectual and eternal light of men's souls exceeds that which is only
sensible and momentary to their eyes: by how much reason and truth are above
the beams and luster of the Sun; which is infinitely short of the divine glory
of Christ, and those spiritual benefits, which by his healing wings (the
Ministers and Ministrations of his Church) are derived to the world.

Although the study, and knowledge of the Stars be very worthy of a wise and
Christian man, because in their beauty, luster, and numberless number, in
their vast magnitude, and height, in their admirable motion, and various
influences, the wonderful glory of the Creators power and wisdom is eminently
set forth, beyond what vulgar eyes discern: yet, experience tells the truly
learned and religious Astronomer, (for such there are) that nothing is so
blind and bold as an hungry Astrologaster: who must flatter, that he may feed
(starveling wisards like witches, threaten all that do not give to them, or
approve them:) But if wise men by their moral liberty of virtue and grace, may
overruled the Stars natural inclinations upon them; sure they may (as the
wisest of men, both Christian and heathen, ever did) despise those sorry
Star-gazers and silly divinators, of whom Tacitus in the first book of his
history writes; That they were often banished from Rome, and yet could never be
kept out; a verminly generation (ever destroyed, yet ever breeding) who owe
their best education to their bellies; their wit and science, to the sense and
knowledge of their wants: Who pretend to get their harvest out of heaven, and
glean their food from among the stars, when indeed they have their greatest
influence upon the spirits, and harvest from the purses of credulous and simple
people. They are always fawning and unfaithful to great men; Deceivers of
all, that expect any great, or good matters from them; thus he, a learned
Heathen: So that the insolency among Christians must needs be great and
intolerable, to see Almanacks dashing against their Bibles, and some
Almanack-makers casting a general and public scorn upon their Ministers and
Ministry: imputing both unjustly and indignly the folly and ridiculous
impotency of some Ministers passions and actions, which may be but too true to
the whole function, venerable order and learned fraternity; without limitation
or distinction of the wise from the foolish.

But the badnesse of the times, or madn sse rather of any men in them, makes
this cause never the worse; Indeed it is so great and so good, having in it so
much of Gods glory, and man's welfare, that it merits what it can hardly find
in secular greatness, a proportionate patron; who had need to be one of the
best men, and the boldest of Christians; And therefore is the address so
general, that besides our great Master the Lord Jesus Christ (the founder and
protector of our order and function) this work might find some pious and
excellent Patrons in every corner; whither so great a Truth has of late been
driven to hide it self, by the boldness and cruelty of some; the cowardice
and inconstancy of others: This book requires not the cold, and customary
formality of patron-like accepting it, and laying it aside; but the reality of
serious reading, generous asserting, and conscientious vindicating.

Who ever dares to countenance this Apology in its main Subject, The true and
ancient Ministry of the Church of England, must expect to adopt many enemies,
and it may be, some great ones: Whom he must consider, at once, as enemies to
his Baptism, his Faith, his Graces, and Sacramental seals to his spiritual
comforts, his hopes of heaven; to his very being being a Christian, or true
member of this, or any other sound part of the Catholic Church: Enemies also
to his friends, and posterities eternal happiness; The means of which will
never be truly found in any Church, or enjoyed by any Christians, under any
Ministry, if it were not in that, which has been enjoyed, and prospered in
England; not only ever since the reformation, but even from the first
Apostolical plantation of Christian Religion in this Island.

Of which blessed privilege, ancient honor, and true happiness, no good
Christian, or honest English man, can with patience or indifferency suffer
himself, his Country, and posterity to be either cunningly cheated, or
violently plundered: Certainly there is no one point of Religion merits more
the constancy of Martyrs, and will more bear the honor of Martyrdom, than
this of the divine Institution, authority, and succession of the true Ministry
of the Church; which is the only ordinary means appointed by Jesus Christ, to
hold forth the Scriptures and their true meaning to the world; and with them
all saving necessary truths, duties, means, and Ministrations; wherein not
only the foundation, but the whole fabric of Christian Religion is contained,
which in all ages has been as a pillar of heavenly fire, and as a shield of
invincible strength; to plant and preserve, to shine and to protect, to
propagate and defend the faith, name and worship of the true God and his Son
our Lord Jesus Christ.

This makes the Author not despair to meet with some Patrons and Protectors
of this Defense in Senates, Councels, Armies, and on the house top, no less,
than in closets, and private houses; To whom it cannot be unacceptable to see
those many plausible pretensions, and potent oppositions made by some men
against the Divine authority, and sacred Office, and peculiar calling of the
Ministry, so discovered, as they shall appear to be not more specious, and
subtle, than dangerous and destructive, to the temporal and eternal welfare
of all true Protestants, sober Christians, and honest hearted English men; who,
certainly, next the pleasing of God, and the saving of their souls, have
nothing of so great concernment to themselves and their posterity, as this, The
preserving, and encouraging of a true and authoritative Ministry, which is the
great hinge on which all learning and civility, all piety and charity, all
gracious hopes and comforts, all true Religion and Christianity it self
depends, as much, as the light, beauty, regular motion, and safety of the body,
does upon its having eyes to see.

But if this freer and plainer, Defense should neither merit nor obtain such
ample measure of favor, and public acceptance in the sight of judicious
Readers, as it is ambitious of, and (at least) may stand in need of; yet has
the Author the comfort of endeavoring with all uprightness of heart to do
his duty, though he be but as an unprofitable servant.

And (possibly) this great and noble Subject, the necessity, dignity, and
divine authority of the Ministry of the Church of England, so far carried on by
this Essay: (which sets forth, 1. The Scripture grounds established by the
authority of Christ and his Apostles. 2. The Catholic consent and practice of
the Church in all ages and places. 3. The consonancy to reason and order
observed by all Nations in their Religion, and specially to the Institutes of
God among the Jewish Church. 4. The Churches constant want of it, in its
plantation, propagation, and perfection. 5. The benefit of it to all mankind,
who without an authoritative Min^stry would never know whom to hear with credit
and respect; or what to believe with comfort. 6. The great blessings flowing
from this holy function to this Church and Nation, in all kinds;) These and
the like grand considerations and fair aspects which this subject affords to
learned, judicious and godly men, may yet provoke some nobler pen, and abler
person to undertake it with more grateful and successful endeavors: whose
charitable eyes finding the sometime famous and flourishing Ministry of this
Church, thus exposed in a weeping, floating, and forlorn condition, to the
mercy of Nilus, and its Monsters, (the threatening, if not overflowing streams
of modern violent errors) may take pity on it, and from this Ark of Bulrushes,
which is here suddenly framed, may bring it up to far greater strength and
public honor, than the parent of this Moses could expect from his obscurer
gifts and fortunes.

To which although he is very conscious, as being of himself altogether
unsufficient for so great a work, and so good a word; yet the confidence of the
greatness and goodness of the cause; the experience of Gods, and (generally)
all good Christians, attestation to it, in all former ages of the Church: The
hopes also of Gods gracious assistance, in a work designed with all humility
and gratitude wholly to his glory, and his Churches service: These made him not
wholly refractary, or obstinate against the entreaties of some persons, whose
eminent merit in all learning, piety, and virtue, might encourage by their
command so great insufficiencies to so great an un^ertaking: Which is not to
fire a Beacon of faction or contention; but to establish a pillar of Truth, and
certainty; Also to hold forth a Shield of defense and safety; such as may
direct and protect, stay and secure the minds of good Christians in the midst
of straying, backsliding, and Apostatizing times, wherein many seek to weary
God, his Ministers, and all men but themselves, with their variating
wickedness.

The weight and worth of this great Subject, the Ministry of this, and so of
all true Churches, in which, as in Noah's Ark all that we call Religion, all
that is sacred, Christian, and reformed, is deposited and embarked, would have
(indeed) required a more proportionate assertor: who might, out of the good
treasure of his heart, have given more strength, and ornament to so divine and
necessary an Institution.

But who sees not the methods and choices of Gods wisdom and power; who
(oft-times) makes his light and glory to shine clearest through the darkest
Lanternes? He appears in a bush, when he purposed the great redemption of his
Church out of Egypt: The skillful hand of God can write as well with a Goose
quill, as with a Swans or Eagles. The self-demonstrating beams of sacred Truths
need no borrowed reflections: By soft and easy breathings the Lord has often
dispelled the grossest fogs and blindest mists, which rose in his Church; His
fair and most orient pearls are frequently found in rough and unpolished
shells; The excellency of his heavenly Treasure, and power does best appear in
earthen vessels. The plain and main Truths of Christian Religion (among which
this of an holy ordained Ministry is one) like soverain and victorious Beauties
lose nothing by the meannesse of their dress, or unaccuratenesse of their
habit; it is enough if they can but freely appear like themselves.

This fashion of writing by way of Apology (which requires a diffused and
pathetick style) was, indeed, judged the best and fittest, as for the Subject
and the times, so also for this Author; considering the little leisure, the
short time, the great variety of other business, and distractions upon him:
besides the terror and precipitancy of the ruin, daily threatening the Ministry
and Ministers; if God by the justice, wisdom, and piety of some men did not
defend them and divert that mischief. For the preventing of which some others
have wrote in vindication of the Ministry after a more succinct and
Syllogistick way of argumentation; But the Antiministeriall disease, having
seized not so much the heads, as the hearts of men; and depraved affections
having swerved many from the judgments; it was thought necessary to apply some
remedy at once to both, setting Christians in the Truth, and exciting them to
such a love of it and zeal to it, as may best encounter the heady boldness of
those which oppose it.

If the Author have in this larger way done any thing worthy so excellent a
Subject, it must be first imputed to Gods gracious assistance, and the blessing
of prayers, more than of studies; wherein it may be the charitable flames of
many worthy Christians have greatly helped his infirmities; Next, it must be
ascribed to the sacredness, dignity, and amplenesse of the matter, or Subject
handled, which (as Orators of old observed) like rich soil, and good ground
raises to generous productions the weaker spirits of any thing sown, or
planted in them.

It is true, the Authors ambition is in nothing more than to excel in the
discharge of his duty, as a Minister of this Church; that he might finish his
course with joy; and also to have equalled with height of abilities and
industry, the excellency of this Cause, which is of so high concernment, to the
glory of God; to the honor of his Savior; (to the salvation of so many
souls) to the happiness of this Church; to the blessing of this Nation; to
the preservation of so many worthy men, his Fathers and Brethren of the
Ministry, who make conscience not only to discharge their duty, but also to
preserve the divine authority, and holy succession of their heavenly calling as
Christian Ministers; whom the blessing of God has as much honored and
confirrmed in this Church of England, as in any other under heaven; having made
them in every place, where they were planted, as the trees of knowledge and of
life; bringing the desolate and barren wildernesses to become as the garden of
God, by their good husbandry, their learned and godly industry; which meriteth
all encouragement and protection of all good men; to whose vindication and
assistance if this Author has come in either too late, or too weak, it will be
his great grief.

And if he have not been able to add any strength or honor to this cause,
(which some others before him, have either fairly touched, or somewhat fully
handled) yet he may add to the number of the witnesses, who have or shall give
testimony to this great Truth, holy Order, and happy Institution of Jesus
Christ; who must not cease to prophecy, though they be clothed in sack cloth,
Revel. 11.3.

To conclude; Nothing seemed, in honor and conscience, to him more vile and
uncomely, than to see this Reformed Church of England, which has brought up so
many learned and valiant sons; which lately was so much praised and extolled by
them in her prosperity; to be now so much deserted by many of her children,
both Ministers and others, in this day of her great agony and calamity; wherein
ignorant, mechanic and meritlesse spirits, think it not enough to endeavor to
strip her of her ornaments, to rob her of her garments, to deprive her of her
dowry, to divorce her from her best friends, and faithfullest servants; but
they must also cast dirt in her face; spitefully scratching her, wanonly
rending her, cruelly wounding her, and most scornfully destroying her, as if
she were an impure prostitute, a most abhorred Adulteress; when indeed she
was, and is, a fair Daughter of heaven, and the fruitful Mother of us all:
Justly esteemed by all learned, sober, and godly men, both at home, and abroad,
as wise, grave, chaste, and venerable a Matron, as any, in all the Christian, or
reformed world. Nor does she cease to be comely, though she be now black and
scorched; There appears beauty amidst her ashes, and loveliness amidst her
scratches: the Spirit of glory shines through her Sackcloth; still meriting,
and therefore not despairing of the love, favor, pity, and protection of all
worthy persons who are considerable either for counsel or in power, and
commendable either for honesty or Religion: Suffering indignities, and daily
fearing more from none but those that are enemies, as to all learning, order,
and religion, so to all honesty, modesty, and humanity; Her sad, deplorable
fate and (by such men threatened) if this Author cannot hinder or help to
recover, yet he shall, with Jeremie, heartily pity, deeply lament, and most
passionately pray for her, and her children, so long as he lives; as thou will
(O Christian and compassionate Reader) if thou be of his mind, who bids
thee Farewell.

of God be so) rather than enjoy the worlds calms. There was never, I think, any
time, or cause, since the Name of Christ had place upon Earth, wherein your
real and commendable excellencies, had more opportunities to show, or greater
occasions to exercise themselves, than now: This being the first adventure of
some men's impudent Impiety, attempting at once to annul, and abrogate, the
whole Function and Office, the Institution and uninterrupted Succession of the
Evangelical Ministry: Which prodigious attempt, no ancient Heretics, no
Schismatics, none that ever owned the name of Christians, were so guilty of,
as some now seem to be: So that now, if ever, you are expected, both by God,
and good men, to appear worthy of your selves, and your holy Profession, either
in Piety to God, and Zeal to the Name of your Savior Jesus Christ; or in
justice and gratitude to those your true Ministers, who have Preached to you
the true way of eternal life; or in Pity and Charity, not so much to them, as

Patience, than his being blinded, buffetted, scourged, mocked, reviled,
stripped, crowned with Thorns, and Crucified; Inglerii and desormes esse non
possumus, quocunque modo ad Christi imaginem conformamur; cujus nunquam magis
enituit gloria quam quae sputo and sanguine and vibicibus operiebatur. Chrysostom.
Isai. 53. 2 Pet. 2.6. 1 Cor. 4.13. Matthew. 5.11. Phil. 1.29. Col. 1.24. 1 Pet.
4.14. Psalm. 4. Acts 6.15. Jude 15. (...).
nor was he less a King and Savior, when his Purple Robe was taken off, and
his own Garments divided among the soldiers: He was not less the Messiah, the
sent, and anointed of God, the Great Preacher, and fulfiller of Righteousness,
when he was the scorn and outcast of men; nor a less precious Foundation, and
corner Stone, when refused by foolish builders, who dashed themselves against
him, instead of building and resting by Faith upon him.

In like sort, the true Ministers of this Church, (whom the pride and
wantonness of some men glories to account, as the filth and offscouring of all
things, to speak and do all manner of evil against them falsely and injuriously;)
if they may be so far blessed of God, and honored, as to suffer after Christ's
example, and to make up (to their measure) the remainder of the sufferings of
Christ in his Body, the Church; there is no doubt, but the Spirit of Glory will
more rest upon them, the power of Christ be more perfected in them, and the
light of Gods countenance be more shining on them, than when their Corn, and
Wine, and Oylincreased; their faces will then appear most, as Angels of God,
when with Saint Stephen, they are beset with showers of stones; overwhelmed
with all manner of hard speeches, and rude indignities. Thus it becomes the
proud and petulant world to act; and thus it becomes learned, able, and humble
Ministers to suffer. Who have then least cause to be ashamed, when they are
most opposed, and oppressed for Christ's sake: For, trodden in the wine press of
man's displeasure, they may then yield the noblest juice, and most generous
expressions of their Zeal, Courage, and Constancy.

Wherefore I have adventured, although the weakest and unworthiest among many
of my Fathers and Brethren, the Ministers of this Church of England, so far to
satisfy the worlds curiosity, as to give them some prospect, and view of the
Ministers of England, in their present distresses, fear, and afflictions; that
men may see, with how steadfast countenances, they can look upon their
adversaries, Acts 6.15.
while they stop their ears against them, gnash their teeth at them, and
threaten utterly to destroy them; that their causeless and implacable enemies
may behold, with what divine comfort and assurance, they can walk, both
cheerfully and uprightly amidst their fiery furnaces; Dan. 4.
into which they are therefore cast, because they will not fall down and
worship, As Idols, so are false Teachers, Dolores, Vanitates, Labores,

forth to Preach. Acts 25.11. Toto caelo distant been operari and desperare. --
Sibi conscia virtus Dat animos.
those Idol-shepherds, those False-prophets, Zach. 11.17.
those Meer-images of Ministers, which have set up themselves as gods in the
Church of God; such, as neither they, nor their Forefathers, nor any Church of
Christ for One thousand six hundred years, ever knew, or heard of; who were
ever blessed, and thankfully contented in all times, either of persecution, or
peace, with those true Ministers, who in a right way of due Ordination,
descended from, and succeeded in the place, and ordinary power of the Apostles,
and the other Disciples which were first sent and ordained by Christ: Which the
true Ministers of the Church of England, being conscious to themselves, (as I
shall after prove) that they have rightly received, they have this confidence
still, That they are neither so forsaken of God, nor destitute of good
Consciences, nor despised by good men, nor do they despair, but that they may
have leave, be able, and permitted, with just freedom, and modest courage, to
plead their cause, before any Tribunal of men; not doubting, but they may have
so fair an hearing, as St. Paul (their Great Predecessor, both in Preaching and
Sufferings) hoped from Felix, Festus, Agrippa, or Caesar: Of whose piety the
Apostle having no great persuasion, yet he charitably presumed to find so much
equity, and common humanity in them, as not to be condemned by them, being
unheard; or to be acquitted, as to any crimes falsely laid to his charge; if he
had but the favor of a fair Trial, and impartial Hearing. So hard it is for a
good man ever to despair in a good cause.

And however my confidence be just, and wel-grounded, 3. Reason of this Address.
as to the merit of that Cause which I have (by Gods help) undertaken; yet when
I consider my strength, which is small; my infirmities, which are many; my
defects, which are manifest; my interest with men of place and power, which is
very little; and the prejudice, against whatever I, or any other Minister can
do in this kind (which may be great and many) I have (as feeble Creatures,
Quod deest viribus, habent cautela.
conscious to their weakness, are wont to do) fled to the refuge and
assistance, first of Gods grace (which is sufficient for me, and which in the
midst of threatenings, Acts 27.
storms, and shipwreck, bids me be of good cheer.) Next, to that of your
mediation, (O excellent Souls) who are every where dispersed in this Nation;
whose soundness of mind, and uncorruptedness of manners (yet remaining) has
hitherto preserved this backsliding and unsavory age from utter rottenness and
putrefaction: Possibly your mediation may so far prevail among all estates of
men, as to allay those asperities, abate those animosities, remove those
prejudices, satisfy those jealousies, under which, the Ministers and Ministry
of this Church, do now lie in many men's minds; and, it may be, in some of
theirs, who are become men of power and renown.

Humble Monition to those in Power. In sublimitate positis tam descensus quam
ascensus perpendendus: Nec minus est quod terreat, quam quod placeat. Ambr.

Whose eminency, I hope, will not be offended, if I humbly put them in mind,
That their glory and greatness is not more evident to others (who are prone to
measure their hopes and fears, by the beams or shadows which they cast upon
them) than most of all to be seriously considered by themselves; since, from
those ruins, on which they are raised, and from that height, to which they are
exalted, they may easily look down, and learn, in how slippery a station, and
how tottering a posture all, humane glory, and excellency does consist. That,
the triumphs of such poor mortals carry their own deaths after them, as well as
other men's before them; that, as bubbles, they have the same principles of
frailty in them, by which others have suddenly disappeared, who lately swelled
as big, and swam as high above the waters, as these now do. All religious
experience tells the most subtle and elated spirits, the profoundest
projectors, and the most potent actors, That they can have but a short time
here, may have a sudden change or period, and must give a severe account of all
actions they do, and all advantages they enjoy, in this present world: Of all
which, they shall carry no more comfort with them, than they have made
conscience to do the work of God, according to his will, revealed to mankind
in the sure and sacred Oracles of his written Word.

Zach. 11.
It is manifest, That some men have been a staff of Bonds in Gods left hand, to
punish the sins, or exercise the Graces of many in these three Nations; whether
they shall be a staff of Beauty in his right hand, for the support of Piety,
Peace, Order, and true Religion, the event will best show. They have acted many
things as Men, with great policy and power; it is now expected, they should act
as truly Reformed and wisely Reforming Christians, with Piety and Charity; (if,
at least, that may be hoped in the time of the Gospel, which was denied to
David's zeal under the Law: That such as have 1 Chro. 22.8. Thou shall not build
an House to my Name, because thou have shed much blood upon the Earth in my
sight.
shed much blood in Civil Wars, should be instrumental to build the House of
God:) Peradventure they maybe means, if not to repair its great decays, yet to
hinder it from that total ruin, and utter vastation, which by many and bad men
are threatened; but, we hope by more and better men (with Gods help) will be
prevented.

And truly, if I knew, how I might most acceptably make my Address, and fairly
plead my excuse with men in place and power; if I understood what might most
merit to Apologize before all great, good, and ingenuous men, for the boldness
of now publishing this Apology, I would in the most soft words, and comely
terms, bespeak their favor, and deprecate their offense, for so it becomes
Candidates and Petitioners: But my integrity is beyond all oratory; (...).
Synes. de Reg. The design of this Apology. (...). Vocat. Synes.
and my plainness beyond all artifice or study; I having no design, but only
this, (which I take to be, as pious and just, so not altogether misbeseeming
the station wherein God has set me) That from the Country obscurity (wherein I
am not wholly buried) I may crave leave to use honest Christian Liberty in this
one thing, which relates, not so much to my Person, as to my Profession and
Function; And in this, to appear in public not as a Counselor, or Dictator,
or Threatner, but as an humble Client and Suter, among those many, which always
attend those who have power to save, or to destroy, to do good or evil. Nor in
this am I pragmatically suggesting, what I might foolishly imagine fittest to
be done in State affairs, (from which, as from Pitch and Birdlime, I am most
willingly a stranger;) but only propounding, in all humble and due respect,
what is by many men, much wiser and worthier than my self, (...). Synes. ad

conceived as most necessary for this particular Church of God in England: And
wherein the fears of very many Excellent Christians are so urgent upon them,
that it were better to offend by speaking in love, than by silence to act the
part, both of an Enemy and a Coward. Yet in this freedom, I would not willingly
offend any, that really are, or esteem themselves, my Betters, and Superiors,
so, as to exasperate them by any rash or rude expressions. I earnestly
deprecate all such failings in my self, and such suspicions in others. This
restraint and caution, I have, not so much out of fear of men, (yet do I fear
men, as far as fear is due;) but rather out of that fear of God, which is the
beginning of Wisdom, (...). Pythag.
and that reverence I ow to my self, and my Profession, as a Christian, and a
Minister, whom nothing less becomes, than the badge and livery of Passion; or
the jaundice of Choleric Diffusions, evident in the face of their writings. I
love not (if they were safe) affectations of Language, which power may
interpret Seditious, Turbulent, or Treasonable: I have learned to be patient
under hard things, thankful for moderate, hopeful for better; Nor do I disdain
to beseech man's favor, whose fury God can restrain, and turn the remainder of
wrath, to his praise and his Churches good. Let others complain of their Civil
Burdens, (which I feel, as well as they.) Let them agitate secular Interests,
which never want their vicissitudes, crosses, and defeats: My sense and address
in this Apology, is chiefly for those things which concern the true Ministry,
and the Reformed Religion established in England; (In which, not custom, and
education, but judgment and conscience, I hope, has confirmed me by Gods
grace,) And for those men especially, whose office and duty I think it is, by
Preaching, doing and suffering, as Christian Ministers, according to the Will
of God, to vindicate and preserve true Christian Religion, and to transmit it
as Reformed, in an unblemished, and unquestionable succession to Posterity.

4. Why in way of Apology.
Your Virtuous Excellencies, upon whose favor, chiefly, I have adventured this
Address, to the view of the supercilious, and more untractable World, are not
ignorant what noble Precedents may be alleged for my writing in this manner of
Apology, (which is or ought to be a Apologeticum scribendi genus est mixtura
quaedam oratoris disputantis and Dialectici deprecantis. Eras.
twisting of Logic and Rethorick together; a Checquer-work of Arguments and
Oratory; studying to cloth the Bones and Sinews of Syllogisms, with the
smoothness and beauty of Eloquence) seeking at once, both to convince the
Understanding, and to excite the Affections: For besides those lesser and
obscurer pieces recorded by the Ancients, of Aristides, Melito, Quadratus

pro Christiana Religione tardidit. Et tantae admirationis omnibus fuit, ut
persecutionem gravissimam illius exellens sedaret ingenium. Cant. 2.2. Jeron.
ad Mag. de Aristide and aliis doctis Christianis.
Quadratus, Apollinaris, Methodius, Johannes Gram. Themistius, and Apollonius;
(this last, being a Roman Senator, wrote and recited in the Senate, his
Apollogy for the Christians, and was after crowned with Martyrdom;) We have
also extant those famous Apologies of Justine Martyr, who dedicated his first
to the Roman Senate, and his second to Antoninus Pius Augustus; also that of
Tertullian, who in the time of Severus the Emperor, seeing Christians
persecuted only for the Vel solo nomine, and ex praejudicio domnantur
Christiam. Ter. Apol.
Name, as a sufficient crime, (as many Ministers now are by some men) wrote his
Learned, large, and accurate Apology, dedicating it to the Emperor and his Son.
Saint Hilary also, wrote a Defense for the Orthodox, against the Arrians,
presenting it to Constantius the Emperor. And of later times (in its kind,
inferior to none) is that Apology of the Learned, Pious, and incomparable
Bishop Jewel Bishop Jewels Apology.
. The former wrote their Learned, Modest, and Eloquent Apologies for Christian
Religion, as it then stood (like the Lilly among the Thorns) baited,
persecuted, and condemned on all sides by the Heathen, who wanted neither
numbers, nor arts, nor power to oppress; yet was it boyed up and preserved by
Gods blessing on the learned Courage, and industrious Constancy of those, and
other Holy Men: This last (our Renowned Countryman) vindicated the Reformed
Churches (and particularly this of England,) for their not complying with, and
submitting to the Council of Trent; and for their necessary receding from the
Church of Rome; so far only, as this did in Doctrine or Manners from the
Scripture Rules, and from the Primitive Judgment, Canons, and practice of the
Fathers, the first Councils, and the Primitive purest Churches: That excellent
Prelate, no doubt, would have then fully asserted (as he did other points then
in dispute) the Order, Honor, Office, and Authority of the Ministry of the
Church of England, if either the ignorance, or malice of those times had been
so far guilty and ingenious, as to question or oppose it, which some men now
do; who dare any thing, but to be wise, honest, and humble.

I know my self unworthy to bring up the rear of so gallant a Troop of
Worthies, in all Ages; 5. Why by this Author.
nor is it from the ignorance of my own Tenuities, or other men's Sufficiencies,
that I have thus far adventured to list my self in the Army of Christian
Apologists, or to march under the Banner of this Apology: Only in some
respects, I seemed to some men (if not to my self) to be signed out by
providence to this duty (or endeavor, at least) in as much as I may be thought
redeemed somewhat beyond the ordinary, from that grand prejudice, which is like
a beam in many Readers eyes; or like a dead Fly ready to viciate the sweetest
Confections, made by any Minister in this kind: As if all were done, only for
that livelihood and estate which their Church Livings afford them, that any
Ministers so stickle, and contend to uphold their Function and Ministry, either
by speech or writing.

Few men stand freer from the dashes of this suspicion, than my self; in regard
of either present benefit, or future expectation, by any employment in the
Ministry; which is such, as neither an idle man would undertake the work, nor a
covetous man much envy the reward: Yet, I thank God, I want not either
abilities or opportunities to exercise Piety and Charity among a company of
poor (for the most part) yet good and orderly people; whose love, respect, and
peaceable carriage to me in these times has merited, that I should prefer the
good of their souls, before any private advantages, so long as I am over them,
in the Lord. I thank God, I have far less temptations of private interest, than
would be required to put any discreet man upon so rough an adventure in a
tempestuous Sea, where silence with safety were to be chosen, rather than
publickness with peril; if I did not consciously and charitable look much more
upon the public; where taking a general view of the state and condition
wherein most of my Brethren the Ministers, either are, or are like to be in
this Church, (if some men may have their wills.) I cannot but with shame and
sorrow behold in all corners of the Land, to how low an ebb, not only their
persons, but the whole profession of the Ministry, now is, or is like to be
brought; for Government, Maintenance, Reputation, Authority, and Succession, in
these Churches, through the dissentions of these times.

And truly in the midst of our dust and ashes, we the Ministers of England must
confess, That with no less justice, than severity, the Lord has poured upon us
this shame and confusion of face, as well as upon other ranks and orders of
men; since our many great spots, and foul stains, both in Doctrine and Manners,
could not but be the more remarkably offensive to God and man, by how much, in
the sacredness and eminency of that Calling, more exact holiness was expected
from us, and pretended by us.

1. Whence the lapse of Ministers in the love and reputation they had?
And here, I hope, I shall not give any my Betters, or my Brethren, any offense,
while I humbly prostrate my self in the Porch and Threshold of this Apology;
giving glory to God, and taking shame to my self, as well as others; Not by an
uncharitable censuring of any man, but by a penitential searching and
discovering the true cause, for which I think the Lord has poured this
contempt upon the Ministers of this Church: Herein to begin aright with God,
and our own Consciences, may best relieve us with men; the disburthening of a
ship, (...). Naz. orat. 15. Quicquid defisit pietati aut charitati confessionis
humilitas suppleat. Bern. 2 Samuel 12.13.
is half buoying it up, when sunk or a ground. Ingenuous confession is a good
part, and a great pledge of future amendment: Some diseases are half healed, as
soon as well searched and discovered. It may be, we may find the same
readiness both in God and man, to forgive our fallings, as David did; who, no
sooner had confessed, I have sinned against the Lord, but he heard that
gracious reply, The Lord has put away thy sin, thou shall not die.

In the first place, this for certain we may conclude; That it is not the
galling and stinging of these flesh flies, 1. Peccator celando non facit
nescium, at confitendo sacit propitium Deum. Aug.
(now our busy and bitter enemies of the Anti-ministerial faction) that first
brought this sore and rawness upon us; but it is some foul and corrupt humor
from within us, which first brake out to such putrified sores and wounds, which
have invited those to feast upon our ulcers and deformities.

In a matter then most fit for deep and serious repentings, I cannot be so
superficial, Confessio fallax periculosior est qua^ procax and obstinata
defensio. Nonnulli delosaconfessione se subtilius defendunt. Bern. de Humil.
as some have been, who like Lapwings, cry out loudest, when furthest from
their Nests; being severe censurers of all men, but themselves; loath to see and
confess their bosom sins, or to own the deformities of their darlings; hardly
persuaded to cast away to the Isa. 2.20.
Moles and Bats (to the dark and deformed crew of Heretical novelties, and
Schismatical vanities) those specious and gilded Idols, Teraphims of their own
imaginations which their fancies have forged, and with Micahs devotion, set up
to themselves as Divine.

2. Former due Conformity, not the sin of the Clergy.
Sure, it is but a very poor and pitiful account (the product of Passion, not of
Reason) which some men give; while their with a vulgar vehemence, accuse all
the Clergy and Ministers of England for their former conformities and
subjections to Authority in things to some men disputable for their nature and
use; yet, then, according to Law; that is, approved, established, and enjoined
by the In quibus nihil certi statuit. Scriptura divina, mos populi Dei vel
instituta majorum prolege tenenda sunt. Aug. ep. 86. Romans 14.1, 5. Let every
man be fully persuaded in his own mind; and whether they act, or act not, both
are accepted of God in those things, whereof there is no precise command. So 1
Cor. 10.30. Master Hooker ((...)) in his Ecclesiastical Policy, with
incomparable Learning, and gravity of Judgment, has beyond any Reply,
vindicated both the integrity of his own Conscience, and the honor of this
Church, in things of extern order, (...).
public consent, wisdom, and piety of all estates, in this Church and State.
And which things, very holy and learned men generally used; accounting them, If
burdens to weaker consciences, yet to wise and stronger men, as lawful as it
was for St. Paul to fail in the ship, whose sign was Castor and Pollux, Acts
28.11. Yea, and so far necessary, as (being agreeable to their judgments) the
use and extern observation of them was enjoined in the Church by due Authority,
and approved by their own personal subscriptions; being no way destructive to
any thing of Christian Faith, or Holy Life: Certainly, a sober and good
Christian must not tear in pieces, or cast away his Bible, because it is not so
neatly bound, as he would fancy: Nor would, I believe, any humble Primitive
Martyr, or Confessor, have despised Salvation by Jesus Christ alone, duly
exhibited in the Word and Sacraments, as they were in this Church; nor have
refused Communion, with this, or any part of the Catholic Church, truly
professing Christ Crucified, although the Ipsa mutatio consuetudinis etiam qua
adjuval utilitate, novitate pert^^bat. August. ep. 19.
nails of the Cross had been much sharper and heavier, than any thing was in
the stablished Order and Ministry of the Church of England; which few Churches
since the first hundred years, wherein the Apostles lived, ever enjoyed with
more Purity, Order, and Simplicity, as to the main, than the Reformed Church
here in England did.

So that many wise, and good men, begin now to think (since these unhappy
disputes have by attrition been kindled, and far driven on to fire and sword,
seeming heretofore to have risen from humble, meek, and charitably tender
spirits) That the greatest sticklers against those things (which were often
declared to be, not any part of piety, duty, or devotion in themselves; But
only as matters of extern order, decency, and circumstance,) were rather
curious (for the most part) than Discipl^^^ nulla est melior gravi prudentique
viro, in his, quae liberas habent observationes, quam ut eomodo aga^, quo agere
vi^^^n ecclesiam ad quam cunque forte devenerit. Quod enim neque contra fidem,
neque contra bonos merit inju^gitur, indifferenter est habendum, and pro eorum
inter quos vivitar sacittate servandum est. August. ep. 118. ad Jan. Cavendum
est ^e tempestate contentionis sermitas charitatis obnubiletur. August. ep. 86.
conscientious; Dissenters being either very weak, or very wilful. And some
have since sufficiently appeared, rather wantonly nice, loose, and given to
change, than any way grave, fetled, or seriously solicitous in matters of
Religious Order, and Public Ministrations. Possibly, it was not the least of
our follies and sins, that we did not with more thankfulness enjoy the many
rich mercies, Hinc in bella civilia praecipitamur, quod mal a mitiora nimium
cavemus. Eras.
we then had; instead of that regret and querulous impatience, which was so
loath to bear any such defects or burdens, as some men imagined; wherein (for
the most part) ignorance, or easiness, or vulgarity of minds and manners, made
Qui in levibus a quotidiana recedit consuetudine, Magnus licet vir sit certis
tantum horis illum sapere noris. Verulam.
greater outcries, and aggravations, than either truth of judgment, or
tenderness of well-informed Consciences. The after-instability in some men
minds, and stupidness of their manners, shows the Vertigo and Lethargy of their
Brains: For many men, who, when it began to be in fashion, strained at those
gnats, which formerly for many years, they had digested, yet afterward made no
bones to swallow Camels of grosser innovations, such as no distinctions can
mince or chew small enough for a good Conscience. And it is confessed by those,
that have now attained their after-wits, that those former conformities
enjoined by Law, were but motes, in comparison of those beams, which now
threaten to eclipse the lights of this English World, and to put out the very
eyes of the Seers and Watchmen of this Church.

weeds of Conformity; which if they were not, as sweet Marjoram, very savory;
yet sure, they were not as (mors in olla) Colloquintida or Hemlock, very
hurtful, or death in the pot; being judged by the wisdom of the Church and
State here, and by the most learned Divines abroad, to be within the liberty
and compass of those things, of Order and Decency, (...): ut ordinata acies, As
an Army with Banners, in Rank and File, where nothing may be deformed by being
disorderly.
which by that one grand charter, 1 Cor. 14.40. are allowed by God to be
ordered by the prudence of any particular National Church; And in which, all
Churches, in all ages and places, have esteemed their several Customs, as Laws
to them, without any breach of Charity, or prejudice of Christian Liberty, or
blemish of the Faith; yet never (perhaps) without the offense of some
particular Members in the Churches, whose fancies easily find fault with any
things, whereof themselves are not Fathers, or at least Gossips. Humble
Christians will thank God for moderate enjoyments; nor are they bound to
contend for what they think best, to the perturbance of the public Peace.
Patience is a remedy always near, easy, and safe; nor is it likely, that the
state of any Church on Earth will ever be so happily completed, as to have
nothing in it, which may displease any good man, Cato optime sentit sed nocet
interdum reipublicae. Tacit.
or which may not exercise his tollerancy, and charity; which are generally
more commendable and unsuspected virtues, than those of zealous activity, and
public opposition, which commonly draw somewhat upon the dregs of self, either
as to Passion or Interest, Et multis utile bellum. Luc.
Party or Concernment: For, who is so mortified, that does not hope to get
something of credit, profit, or honor, by adhering to any side or new faction,
against the former setlings?

How many learned and godly men are, and ever will be (till better grounds be
produced, from Scripture, Reason, and practice of the Primitive Church)
unsatisfied with the parity and novelty, yet pretended Divine Right, of the
sole-headless-Presbytery; which chalenges to it self, as from Christ, such a
supreme power, as is exclusive and destructive of all Episcopacy; that is, of
the constant Presidency of one, among other Presbyters; so placed by their own
choice and consent?

And no less unsatisfied are thousands of learned, and good Christians, with
that power of Lay Elders; (for so they are best called, for distinction sake;
and not Ruling Elders; lest by that title of Ruling, they should fancy and
usurp the sole power of rule to themselves; which undoubtedly, is equally, if
not eminently due to the Preaching Elders, who labor in the Word and Doctrine:)
Touching which point of Lay Elders in the Church, I have read two Books written
above thirty years since, by a very, learned, godly, and impartial Divine,
Master Chibald of London: In the first of which, he proved these Lay Elders to
have no place, office, use, Mr. Chibalds two Books of Lay Elders.
power, or maintenance assigned them by Scripture; nor ever in any Church of
Christ; which he demonstrates in the second Book (which is full of excellent
reading) as to the Fathers, Councils, and Histories of the Church: In none of
which he finds them to have any footing, as to office and power, upon any
Divine Right, ever owned in the Church; nor can they now have in every little
Parish, or private Congregation; where the Country plainness may afford careful
Overseers for the Poor, and Churchwardens; but not fit men to match with the
Minister, and to fit as Rulers to govern their other Neighbors; who will hardly
believe they have authority from Heaven to rule them, unless they see more
abilities in them, than usually can be found. What use may be made of such
Elders, in the way of Prudence among greater Representations of the Church, as
in Synods and Councils, he leaves to the wisdom of those, that have power in
such Conventions to call and regulate them: But he denies any thing, as of
Divine Right, belonging to them; so, as to bind every Parish or Congregation
to have them, which would be ridiculous, and most inconvenient. Both these
Books being seven years since committed to the hands of Master Coleman, as then
a Licencer, were unhappily, either smothered and embezzled, or carelessly lost;
to the great detriment of truth in that particular: For, truly, in my best
judgment, and in other men's of far better, to whom I imparted them, never any
thing was written, of that subject, more learnedly, more uprightly, more
copiously, or more heartily; especially, considering the Author was one that
scrupuled some things of Conformity.

In like manner, how few Christians in any Reformed Church are satisfied with
those new, and strange Limbs, rather than Bodies of Independent Churches;
(which word of bodying into small Corporations; is as a novel, so a very gross
expression, and has something of a Solecism; not only in Religion, which owns
properly but one Body of Christ, Romans 12.5. We being many, are one body in
Christ. 1 Cor. 12.13. By one Spirit we are all baptized into one Body, which is
Christ's.
which is his Catholic Church; whose communion with Christ, the only Head,
and one another, as Members in several Offices and Operations, is by the same
Faith, the same Scriptures, the same Ministry, the same Ministrations, and as
to the main and substance, the same Christian Profession:) But it is also
incongruous and absurd in ordinary significancy of Language; while by such a
singular Bodying, they mean a Spiritual Union of those, that pretend to be most
Spiritual Christians: Which names, and novel inventions, about constituting and
completing Churches, in so many fractions, parcels, and places, a part from
all others, by the means of an explicit Church Covenant, (as they call it;) how
unscriptural; how unconform to the examples of all ancient Churches, how
impertinent as to Piety; how dangerous and destructive to the Truth, Union,
Harmony, and Dependence (which ought to be among all Christians, 1 Cor. 12.25.
That there be no schism in the body. (i. e.) In that one Body of Christ, the
Catholic Church.
and all Churches, to avoid Schism in that one Catholic Body of Christ,) do
they seem to many judicious and gracious Christians? who think themselves, and
all others, that profess to be Christians, sufficiently added, and united to
the Church, as the Primitive Believers, being once baptized, were without any
more a do, yea, and declaredly bound by their Acts 2.42. They that gladly
received the word, were baptized; and the same day there were added (to the
Church) about 3000. souls.
Baptism and Profession; to all Christian conversation, charitable communion,
and holy walking, by these Public Bonds; and Sacraments of Religion, which
they owned; and of which, they were publicly partakers and professors.

So that, not only in these, but in many other things, we see the remedies,
which some men apply to former seeming distempers, do (to many men) seem worse
than the diseases ever were: The little finger of grievances, scruples,
disorders, and scandals, being far heavier than the loins of the Law were in
former-times; where, if there was less liberty by the restraints, which men had
by Laws laid on themselves; yet there was also far less ignorance in names,
fewer errors in judgments, 5. Other weak conjectures of the causes of
Ministers abating in their honor.
blasphemies in opinions, brokenness in affections, dissolutions in discipline,
undecencies in sacred administrations, and licentiousness in the ordinary
manners of men: So that if those times were not the golden age of the Church,
sure these cannot brag to be beyond the iron, or brazen.

No less superficial and unsearching are those Conjectures or Censures, which a
late Writer makes of Ministers ostentations of reading, and humane learning in
their Sermons, (of which, many men cannot be guilty, unless it be of making
shows of more then indeed they have:) Also, he allegeth, as an occasion of
Ministers lapse in their love, and respect among the people, their small
regard, and strangeness to godly people: When it is evident, many men's and
women's godliness, brings forth now no better fruit, than, first, quarreling
with; then neglecting; afterward, despising; next, separating from: after that,
bitter railing against; and lastly, stirring up faction, not only against that
one Minister, but his whole calling. Certainly, some are become such godly
brambles, and holy thistles, as are not to be conversed with more than needs
must, and are never to be treated with bare hands. But in case some Ministers,
by many indignities provoked, grow more teachy and morose to these men's
thrifty, inconstant, and importune godliness; If they fortify what they
ass^^^, by the testimonies of learned men, (which is no more than is sometimes
needful, among captious, curious, and contemptuous auditors,) yea, if they seem
to some severer censor, something to exceed, in their particulars, those bounds
of gravity, and discretion, which were to be desired; yet, what wise man can
think, that such fleebites or scratches (in comparison) can send forth so great
corruption, or occasion so ill a savor in the nostrils of God and man, that for
these things chiefly, Ministers should be so much under clouds of obloquy and
disrespect; that, although they have every seventh day, at least, wherein to do
men good, and to gain upon their good wills, yet many of them are so lost, that
there are but few can give them so much as a good word.

But, 1 Samuel 19.12.
some men are willing to mistake the Image and Goats-hair for David, and
pretend with Rachel, infirmities, Genesis 31.34.
when they sit upon their Idols. Alas, these cannot be the symptoms of so
great conflicts and paroxisms, as many Ministers now labor under, who were
sometimes esteemed very precious men, and highly lifted up on the wings of
popular love and fame: In which respects, no men suffer now a greater ebb, than
those that were sometime most active, forward, and applauded. The sticks and
strains of lesser scandals, and common failings among Ministers, might kindle
some flashes to singe and scorch some of them; but these could not make so
lasting flames, so fierce and consuming a fire, as this is: In which, many, or
most Ministers, that thought themselves much refined, and undertook to be
refiners of others, are now, either tried, or tormented. Who sees not, that the
fire and wood of this To^het, which God has prepared, Isai. 30.33.
is not (as some conceive) only for Princes and Prelates, for Archbishops, and
Bishops, etc. (In some of whom, what ever there was of want of zeal for Gods
glory, of sincere love to the truth, of charity to men's souls, I cannot excuse,
or justify, since they could not but be as highly displeasing to God and man,
as from both they enjoyed very great and noble advantages above other men, of
glorifying God, advancing Christian Religion, and encouraging all true
holiness: Nor was the having of Dignities and Revenues their sin, but the not
faithful using of them; no wonder, if of them, to whom much was given, Luke
12.48.
much be required, either in duty, or in penalty.) But this Tophet is also (we
see) enlarged, for the generality of Presbyters, and such as disdained to be
counted the inferior Ministers; nor is this fire thus kindled in the valley of
Hinnom, nourished only by the bones and carkases of ignorant, profane, and
immoral Ministers (who are as dry sticks, Jude 12.
and trash; twice dead, to conscience, and to modesty; fit indeed to be pulled
up by the roots;) but even those greater Cedars of Lebanon have added much to
this pile, and fuel, who sometimes seemed to be Trees of the Lord, tall and
full of sap; very able and useful in the Church; and, while within their due
ranks and station, they were faithful, flourishing, and fruitful; whose very
Children, and Converts, (their former disciples, followers, favorers, and
beloved ones, Genesis 19.22.
) now in many places, turn Chams, pointing and laughing at their Fathers real
or seeming nakedness; Who drinking perhaps too much of the new wine of state
policies, opinions, and strange fashions of reformations, possibly may have
been so far overtaken with the strength of that thick and heady liquor, as to
expose something of shame and uncomliness to the view of the wanton world;
where, not strangers, open enemies, proud, and profaner aliens, but even
Protestants, Professors, Domestics, and near Allies, sit in the highest seat
of scorners; inviting all the enemies of our Church, our Ministry, and our
Reformed Religion, to the theater of these times; Where, among other bloody and
tragical spectacles, this is by some prepared for the farce and interlude; to
expose by Jesuitical engines and machinations, the learned and godly Ministers,
together with the whole Ministry of this Church of England, to be baited,
mocked, and destroyed, with all manner of irony, injuries, and insolency: And
alas, there are not many, that dare appear, to hinder the project; or redeem,
either the persons, or the function; yea, many are afraid to pity them, or to
plead for them.

The merciful hearted, and tender handed God, who smites us, (whose hand we
should all see, Micah 6.9. (...).
and return to him, who has appointed this rod and punishment) does not use to
make so deep wounds and incisions for little corruptions, which are but
superficial and skin-deep; nor to shoot so sharp and deadly arrows, in the
faces of those that stand before him, as his Ministers; unless they first
provoke him to his face, 1 Samuel 2.22.
by their grosser follies in Israel, as Eli's sons did. Wherefore, I conceive,
a further penitent search and discovery ought to be made of Ministers sins and
failings, for which the Lord has brought this great evil upon them; which
although it be a just punishment, yet it may prove a fatherly chastisement to
us all; and at once, both purge us, as fire from our dross, and by exciting
those gifts and graces, truly Christian and Ministerial in us, it may prepare
us, both for greater service, and ampler mercies, than ever yet we enjoyed, as
Ministers in this Church; who have always lain under, and contended (since the
Reformation,) not only with the burden of our own infirmities and defects,
but also with the evil eyes, the envious hearts, the sacrilegious hands, the
profane manners, the superstitious and factious humors of many men, both open
enemies, and seeming friends: Some men's innate leudness and pravity endures any
thing easier, than an able and faithful Minister; others Cynical sourness
grudges at any thing less, than to see Ministers enjoy either honor, or estate,
beyond the vulgar: Both are ready to be severe censurers of Ministers faults,
that so they may justify their hatred or envy; but neither are likely to judge
righteous judgment, nor shall we, I hope, ever stand to these men's sentence.

For my particular, I desire, both my self, 6. What is conceived the true cause.
and others of my mind and Profession, may by an ingenuous acknowledgement of
our failings, be fitted for Gods and man's absolution, both in present and after
ages; that it may not be said, The Ministers of England erred greatly, and were
punished sharply, yet knew not how to repent humbly, and truly; every one
palliating their own errors, Nihil pudori esse debet paenitenti nisi non
fateri. Ambr. de Poen. Of true Honor. (...). Plato de leg. Dial 5. (...). Id.
and transferring the blame and guilt still upon others, when themselves were
in somethings more blamable than any men, and merited, in their own censure, to
be esteemed the chief of sinners.

You then, O excellent Christians, know (in general) That all true honor from
man, is but the agnition or reflection of those Virtues and Graces, by which men
are, or appear likest to God; that is, truly good and useful to others: From
God, honor bestowed on any men, is a testifying before men (in some way of his
providence) his approbation of those graces and endeavors in us; by which we
draw nearest to that resemblance of the Divine goodness, and holiness, which is
lively set forth in the Word of God, and the example of Jesus Christ, who is
the visible express image of the fathers glory: (...). Plat. H. b. 1. 1. 2 Pet.
1.4.
By the gracious imitation of which glory, human nature attains and partakes
something of the divine; and by a kind of transfiguration both of mind and
manners (as Moses and El^as in Christ's company on the Mount) both Christian
Magist^ates and Ministers, acting in holy and good ways, cannot fail by sincere
honoring of God, 1 Samuel 2.30. Those that honor me, I will honor.
to attain that honor which God has promised; which consists, not so much in
those preferments and applauses of the world, (which are for the most part
vain, like it self;) but in that holy wisdom, gravity, and constanc^, which
becomes a Christian, either in well-doing, or in comely suffering, according to
the clear will of God in his Word; which gives both precepts and paterns of all
true excellencies. The robes of true honor are not made of the slight and thin
Cob-webs of popular opinions and practices, but are (te^a crassiore) of more
solid and substantial virtues, as Gonsalvo said. Worthy actions do always, not
only joy the soul, calm the conscience, and strengthen the heart; but also
they make the face of good men to shine; conciliating such a majesty to virtue,
and such beauty to true holiness, that even those who hate, and persecute them,
(as to the interests of their worldly lusts) cannot in their judgments, but
approve, reverence, and esteem them, even in the midst of their sufferings;
Phil. 1.29. (...); To you it is given, as a free favor; not only to believe,
but to suffer. Pati pro Christo, honorarium Christiani. Ber.
which do not less honor and adorn them, than their wel-doings: For nothing
discountenanceth a Christian, but the conscience of vile actions, and Gods
displeasure. In the judicious and constant way of holy walking, and honorably
suffering, no man can lightly speak evil of another, without a secret shame,
and reproach to himself; nor injure, or despite them, without some inward
regret and pain.

And certainly, the Christian World here in England, (which owed and owned as
much to their Ministers heretofore, and esteemed them as highly, and treated
them as honorably and ingenuously, as any people under Heaven could do their
Teachers in Religion) would never have so much opened their mouths, and
withdrawn their love and respects from many, if not most Ministers; nor would
some men have dared so far to meditate, and endeavor their total ruin and
extirpation; if we Ministers had not in some things (beyond the venials of
common infirmity) either much exceeded, or come very short of those due bounds,
wherein true Christian virtues, and especially Ministers excellencies do
consist.

7. The ordinary failings of Ministers, not the cause of their lapse.
Nor is it to be thought here, that the eyes of men are so severely fixed, only,
or chiefly, upon the ordinary defects of Ministers, either in gifts or
industry, proper to their calling; Although (God knows) even herein too many of
us may be justly blamed, and without injury despised; as either wanting those
ministerial abilities, which we might by prayer and study attain; wherewith
competently to discharge, and adorn that sacred Work, and redeem it from vulgar
invasion, which brings the highest contempt of it. The ignorance, idleness,
indiligence, and needless non-residency of some of us, from our charges, is not
to be concealed. In others, the neglect of our studies, both in Divinity, and
in all kinds of good learning, by which our profiting might appear to all men,
1 Timothy 4.15.
is to be deplored: It is not expectable, that Ministers should increase in
favor with God and man, Luke 2.52.
unless (as Ch is it did) they grow in wisdom too, as well as in age or stature:
And alas, what f uit of honor to Ministers, or glory to God, or good to men's
fouls, can be reaped, either from those that Preach and Pray, chiefly for
applause and popular air, Bonorum ingeniorum insignis est indoles in verbis
verum amare non verba. August. Planctum mab^, quam plausum.
taking much pains to little or no purpose; or yet from that contrary
descending of others in their preaching to such a popular flatness, which
stretches forth dead sermons, and spiritless prayers merely to an excessive
length, (as if the Pulpits were their Coffins;) with so much insipidness, vain
repetitions, vulgar flattery, senseless oratory; yea, and sometimes with
strange figures of Blasphemies, which manner of somer men's preaching has given
(we see) the very meanest sort of hearers (who heretofore were wonted to more
useful, and more sober preaching and praying;) if they have any thing of parts,
or pragmaticalness in them, not so much a presumption, as a just confidence,
that they can both preach and pray, as well or better, than such lazy, supine,
superficial, and empty Ministers; whose duller plainness, and ruder fervency,
is not that demonstration of the spirit, 2 Cor. 2.4. Conciones sacrae nec rudes
esse debent, nec delicatae, nec cincinnatae, nec impexae: Simplex quaedam
gravitas and subtilis soliditas adsit, quae pondus and ornatum deferat. Zanch.
Orat. Sermonis vis and actionis vehementia materiei pondere aequanda. Quint.
Lucens^putrido, Scenae in cathedram translatio.
which sets forth divine truths in their native Scripture-simplicity; which is
their greatest strength and beauty (as the Sun's, when it shines freest from
all mists and cloudings;) Nor are those men's rebust and deformed heats, that
judicious zeal, which becomes g^ave Ministers, both as sober men, and holy
Orators from God to the Church: For expressions ought always to be
proportioned, in true oratory, to the weight of the matter in hand: Yea, where
the unaffected quicknings of a Ministers own spirit, or the dullness of his
Auditors, requires more than ordinary vehemence; yet still it must be carried
with very comely heats and emotions, either for voice or gesture; but all the
whole Pageantry of some men's preaching is, only a gratifying their own fancies
and passions, or else a miserable way of mocking God, and cheating the poor
peoples souls; who (some of them) are as well content with chaff, as with good
corn, or the bread of life; and if the flail be still going, they care not what
grist arises: Others thirsting for the pure and wholesome waters of life, the
idleness and poverty of these men, gives them to drink, only of that ((...))
water, which is at their doors; in the shallow plashes and foul puddles of
their own dull inventions; where their sudden and confused thoughts are
oftentimes sooner out of their mouths, than in their minds: And this for want
of either ability, or industry, Multi tadio investigandae veritatis ad proximo^
divertunt errores. Min. Fael.
to dig to the depths of those sacred springs, the Scriptures; which chiefly
afford that living water, which can refresh thirsting, wash polluted, and save
sinful souls; which are not to be wrought upon by flat, or fine notions, by
soft expressions, or by feminine insinuations; but by sound demonstrations,
learned arguings, serious convictions, and masculine ways of expressions; 2
Cor. 5.20.
such as become the Embassy and Ambassadors of God to man.

But, as not these Ministerial defects, in their peculiar Function; so neither
are they the private immoralities of their life's (which usually attend the
negligence of their calling, and bring many scandals upon both their persons,
and their function. These are not the spots, or that kind of leprosy, which
could have thus made the whole body of their profession to be esteemed by many
as unclean: For under these personal failings and deformities, (wherein some,
and it may be too many of us, have been blamable in all times,) yet still, that
ability, soundness, and diligence, which was found in many other worthy
Ministers, both as to their learning and piety, was sufficient to preserve the
dignity and venerableness of the function, from general obloquy, and contempt;
nor ever was it brought to that precipice, where now it seems to stand, both as
to disrespect, and danger.

8. The main cause, as some conceive.
Until, that those thick clouds, and grosser vapors (heretofore unknown among
Protestant Ministers in England) like a Scotch mist, or Egyptian darkness, came
over the whole Firmament (almost) of this Church; darkning, and turning into
Blood, even many of those Stars of the second and third magnitude, at least;
which formerly shined, without blemish, in the soundness of their judgment,
wel-guided zeals, meekness of their spirits, and diligence in their places, to
all exemplary holiness; who (good men) probably did not know, while their nails
were pared, and kept short, by the Laws and Government above them, how much
they could scratch (even till the blood came) if once the liberty of times
suffered them to grow so long, that some men's secular projects might use them,
as the Ape did the Cats paw. Then indeed it soon appeared, that though
Ministers might be well-gifted, and well-affected men, as to the Reformed
Religion, to the Laws, and all public Relations, yet they were but men; yea,
though they were able and useful, while fixed in their Ecclesiastical orb and
sphere; yet when they came to be planetary and excentrick to that duty and
modesty, which the Laws of God and man most exactly require of them, as lights
and paterns to others, than did their beams and influences begin to grow
malign, fiery, and combustive.

Hence too many Ministers are looked upon, (how justly God knows; and the
World, with their own consciences, not I, must judge) as great incendiaries;
full of violence, immoderation, tumultuary heats, and passionate transports;
beyond, what was either comely, or just for grave men of their calm and sober
profession; into which high distempers, it was as easy for men of learned
parts, of zealous spirits, and little experience in humane public affairs,
especially that of a Civil war, to fall; as for constitutions of high color,
and sanguine complexion, to lapse into Fevers or Calentures; which by degrees,
if not allayed, bring the wisest and strongest men to ravings, and fits of
distraction: Such did those violent fits and inordinate activities seem to be
(upon the second thoughts and cooler reflections of people) wherein many
Ministers, so much, and so busily, appeared in Senates and Armies; in
Conventicles and Tumults; more like Statesmen, Politicians, and Soldiers; or
what became only light and vain persons, than like learned, grave, and godly
men; such as were called to a spiritual, holy, and unbloody warfare: This
forwardness in sanguinary motions, rendered Ministers vile, and contemned, even
to those, who were content to use their uncomly activities. The sound of
Trumpets, the clashing of Swords, the thundering of Canons, were not a newer and
greater terror to men's ears in England, than were those bold Philippicks, those
bitter Orations, (...). Plat. in Pericle.
those sharp Invectives, those cruel Railings, used by some Ministers, even in
their Prayers and Preachings, against those, to whom they formerly showed a
fair compliance and subjection: Who, if they had deserved evil language, and
railing accusations, yet of all men these did not become the mouths of
Ministers; who should in public appear, as the Angels of God; with such
modesty, light, and beauty, as sets them farthest off from any passionate
darkness of mind, or deformity of manners, or undecency of expressions. Since
Christ has commanded them most eminently to bless those that curse them; to
pray for those that persecute them, etc.

After these, followed other vials of wrath, (poured forth from those, who
should have been only Pitchers with Lamps, Judges 7.20.
filled with holy oil, and fired only with holy fire,) strange and new
prodigies of opinions, in doctrine, government, and manners; sudden and violent
changes (like wilde-fire) running even to all extremes; greater jealousies and
impatiences of sufferings, than of sinning: Fierceness to be revenged upon any,
by whom they sometimes thought themselves injured in the least measure, when it
may be, it was not the man, as the Law, by which they suffered.

Yea, when some Ministers were gratified with such measures of revenge, as
might move even envy it self to pity those persons, who suffered indeed justly
from God for their sins; yet from man, they chose affliction, rather than sin:
Yet still many Ministers followed with severe censures, and harsh declamings,
even the miseries of those their Brethren, or Fathers; (who were in all true
worth, equal to them, and in many things, as well as in an envied authority,
above them;) Yet in those sad ruins of some learned, grave, and godly men,
they seemed to glory; casting faggots of calumnies into their fires; showing so
little pity, and so much severity to them in calamities, Judges 1.7.
That it will be no wonder to see many of their own Thumbs and Toes cut off;
and themselves brought to creep under, even enemies tables, for their Bread;
who helped or joyed so cruelly in maiming others, and bringing them even to a
morsel of bread; Showing less pity and humanity to their destroyed Brethren and
Fathers, than the Israelites did to the wasted Benjamites; Judges 22.2.
more rejoicing in the victory of a party, than deploring the sin, disorders,
and miseries of the whole.

The mean complyings also of some Ministers, with those weaknesses and
extravagancies of some men's opinions and practices in Religion, which they then
knew, or suspected to be evil and dangerous; of which, they have since been
forced often to complain with bitterness of soul, for want of timely reproving,
and resolute opposing: Add to these, what is frequently observed, and with
great scandal, Their shiftings and variatings from one living to another, under
pretense of Gods, or the peoples call, (where the greater benefice is always
the louder voice, and most effectual call) being always deaf to any thing, that
may in any kind diminish their profit, or preferment: Still seizing (like
ravenous Birds and Beasts, or cunning Woodmen) on any prey they can epsy; upon
which they gain by a thousand windings, and wily ambushes, though never so
injurious to the true owners, even their Fellow Ministers, and their whole
Families.

These, and such like frequent public passages, together with some Ministers
most imprudent neglects of opportunities, sometimes offered, and much in their
power, by which, to have brought differences to an happy composure, especially
in matters of Religion; which were neither great nor hard to have been
reconciled by men of true Prudence and Christian moderation; (which virtues
have great influence in things of extern form and policy in the Church of
Christ:) The fatal omissions and rejections of fair offers; those cruel defeats
also which have followed after, and the unsuccessful blastings of all those
plausible projects, and specious designs, which many of them had, for some
time, driven on (as Jehu) very furiously, and as they thought very
triumphantly; These, I say, and the like notorious imprudences, if not
scandalous impieties, seem to many sober men, to have been among the chief
mists and clouds, both of folly and infamy, which have risen from too many
Ministers lives and manners, and so much eclipsed the glory and face of their
whole Function, which they have rendered too many men suspected, as having more
of the Jesuitick cunning and activity, than of that meek and quiet spirit which
was so eminent in Jesus Christ; That from a pragmatical fierceness (which
sought to have an Oar in every Boat) many Ministers are by many thought so
superfluous, both in Church and State, that they are ready to throw them all
overboard; as thinking there is no use of them, neither in the sad solemnities
of Christians burial (who beyond all men, dying in the Lord, and in hope of a
blessed Resurrection, ought not to be buried with the burial of an Ass, or an
Infidel) nor in the joyful celebrities of marriage, where there needs not only
much of humane prudence, as to choice; but more of divine benediction, as to
the holy use, and happy success of marriage, which among true Christians, ought
to be in the Lord; and so may, very well, bear the public benediction of
those, who are to bless the people in the name of the Lord; yea, even in
matters peculiar to their office, and over so esteemed, and used in the Church
of Christ, both as to the Church Government, Discipline, and holy
Ministrations, of Prayer, Preaching, and Sacramental Celebrations, are
Ministers, by many, thought more easily to be spared, and dispensed, withal, as
to any public necessity; than any Bailiff in an Hundred, Praecept est vulgi
anim^^, and insa^o impetu a rerum abusis, adversus usum ipsum propelluntur.
Petrarch.
or a Constable in a Village: And no wonder, for nothing is more ordinary, than
for the most excellent things, once degenerated to abuses, so far to lapse in
the opinion and esteem of vulgar and passionate minds, that they are ready,
foolishly to wish, and greedily to welcome, the total disuse and abolition of
them.

Campian, an Eloquent railer, sometimes wrote (not with more malice, than
apparent falsity, at that time, when the state of the Ministry in England had
not more of public favor, than of true honor and merit, both for learning,
piety, and order,) Nothing (says he) is more putid and contemptible, than the
English Clergy. O that this reproach were with truth now to be contradicted, or
confuted; which has so heavily befaln us, and so justly; since too many
Ministers became so tragmatick, so impertinent, so unsuccessful in State
policies, in worldly projects, in secular agitations, in counsels and actions
of war and blood, which they have agitated more intensively, than Church
affairs and matters properly religious. How odious must it needs be, when they
are publicly seen so vastly differing from that Spirit of the Gospel, which
they Preach? So disguised in their Habit? so degenerating from their Calling?
so different from the rule and example of the Lord Jesus Christ, of the holy
Apostles, of the blessed Martyrs, of the primitive Bishops, Presbyters, and
Confessors? These might be seen (possibly) after the pattern of their Savior,
riding meekly on an Ass, or, as Ignatius, on some vile beast, to be crucified;
but they were never met, on red, and pale, and black horses; threatening blood,

lived: By the imitation of whose wisdom from above, Jam. 3.17. Churchmen, by
Civil and Canon Laws, were forbidden to have any thing to do in matters of

which was pure, and peaceable, and gentle, and easy to be entreated; by
walking in the good old ways of meekness, patience, gentleness, and Christian
Charity, Ministers were heretofore so highly esteemed, in this Church, That
nothing was thought too much, or too dear for them: But, when by worldly
passions and secular engagements, they are found too light for the balance of
the Sanctuary, (where only learned humility gives weight, and an holy gravity
to them;) when these sons of God court the daughters of men, and disguise
themselves into the forms of Politicians; when they carry on vain and violent
projects, and opinions, by pride, choler, fierceness, tumultuariness, faction,
and sedition; or by rusticity, grossness, levity, and credulity, or in ways of
scurrility, popularity, and cruelty; when to advance themselves to some show of

be supported, as Solomon's on both sides, with Lions, or Tigers, Bears and
Wolves, instead of Lambs and Doves: As if Ministers had changed, or lost, their

Alas, who is so blind as not to see; who so dull, as not to consider, how
destructive such distempers are (even in the justest secular conflicts) to the
dignity; how contrary to the duty of true Ministers of the Gospel: Whose honor
consists, in meekness, patience, humility, constancy, diligence, charity,
tenderness, and gravity in their Preaching, Praying, and Living, joined to good
learning, and sound knowledge? The want of these holy deportments conjured up
those evil spirits of sacrilege, sedition, perjury, cruelty, contempt, and
confusion, against them, and among them, which are not easily laid again: No
man, ordinarily, being ashamed to offer that measure of scorn, evil speaking,
ruin, and oppression; which they see, even some Ministers themselves have
offered liberally to their Brethren, and Betters: Who can make conscience to
destroy those, that make so little, to consume and devour one another? And
this, at length, with the greater odium, because with the greater defeat:
Honest meaning Christians expecting nothing less than such conclusions from the
specious premises of zeal for Religion, and a through Reformation; when it is
too evident, how much, not only the minds and manners of men, but the general
form and face of the Christian and Reformed Religion, was never tending to more
deformity, either in Doctrine, Government, or true Discipline, than now it is;
as other where, so in England, through the miscarriages of many Ministers, as
well as people. No wonder, if ordinary men (who naturally love not a Minister
of Gods truth) do easily disesteem those, who so little reverence themselves,
and their holy Function: No marvel, if men make so little conscience to hear,
or believe them, whose actions so contradict, and palpably confute, their
former doctrine and manners: Yea, many now make conscience to neglect, despise,
forsake, and separate from them; yea, some seek utterly to depose and destroy
them; not only as useless, but as dangerous and pernicious creatures, who seem
to have more of the Wolf and Fox, than of the Sheep and Lamb. Thus from
Ministers of Gods truth, peace, and salvation, they are too much fallen to be
esteemed as State-firebrands, and by some as vessels of wrath, only fitted for
destruction: What was sometime cried up as a commendable zeal (and who but
Phinehas with his Javelin, was then thought fit to be a Priest to the Lord!) is
now looked upon, as either miserable folly, or detestable fury.

And certainly, 10. Ministers duty in civil dissentions.
(in the calmest representation of things) if some warmth of natural zeal, and
sparks of humane affections, were allowable to Ministers (who are still but
men) in civil and secular affairs; relating (as they thought) to the good and
safety of their Country, their Laws, Religion, Liberties, Estates, and
Governors; yet should these warmer gleams in Ministers hearts, rather have
vented themselves in soft dews and sweet showers, than in lightnings and hot
thunderbolts, or coals of fire: Their politic Preaching, their earnest
Prayers, their unfeigned Tears should have attempered, both their own and other
men's passionate heats and propensities to civil flames: Vide Joel 2. v. 3, 10,
11, 13, etc.
They should, as V. 17. Let the Priests, the Ministers of the Lord weep: Let
them say, Spare thy people, O Lord, etc.
the Priests of the Lord, have stood and wept between the Porch and the Altar;
crying mightily to Heaven, that God would spare his Church, and people; And
with men on Earth, they should have interceded, that they would pity
themselves, and one another. Ministers of all men, should have studied,
preached, prayed, wept, and fasted, all sorts and degrees of men in this
Nation, (who were so many ways nearly related to one another) into calmness,
moderation, Christian temper, forbearings, mutual condiscendings, and proneness
to reconciliation: If this would not do, they should have Ezekiel. 22.30. I sought
for a man among them that should make up the hedge, and stand in the gap before
me for the Land, that I should not destroy it, but I found none. Caecina cum
milites, nec antoritate, nec precibus, nec manis retinere possit, projectus in
limine, miseratione demum, quia per legati corpus eundum erat, clausit viam.
Tacit. An. l. 1.
stood in the gap, or lain prostrate (as Caecina did) in the unhappy breach,
and rather chose to be trodden under the feet of Armies, Men, and Horses, than
to see the woeful day, in which their King, and Countrymen, and Fellow
Christians, and Brethren, should rush into an unnatural war, to cut one
another throats.

This I say, godly and tenderhearted Ministers should rather have done, than
in the least kind, have kindled or fomented such unnatural flames, and
unchristian fewds; rudely intruding themselves into all Councels; full of
restless sticklings, State agitatings, politic plottings, cunning
insinuatings, put^d flatterings, secret whisperings, evil surmisings, uncomly
clamors, and rude exasperatings of fears to fewds, of jealousies to enmities,
of misapprehensions to irreconcilable distances, especially in matters wherein
their proper interests (as in those of Church Government and Discipline) might
seem any stop or difficulty to peace, or any occasion to war: Who concludes
not, that in such violent deeds and demands, Ministers forgot and forsook the
greatest honor and duty of their Function! which is, Matthew. 5.9. 2 Cor. 5.20.
to be blessed peacemakers, to beseech men to be reconciled to God, and for
Christ's sake to one another; by whose precious blood, they, above all men,
should show they are redeemed from those fierce wraths, and cruel angers, which
cannot but be cursed; and merit to be seriously and deeply repented, lest for
them, Ministers be divided in Jacob, Genesis 49.7.
and scattered in Israel. And however, many hotter spirited Ministers, might
have honest hearts to God and man; yet it appears they had but weak heads, and
were not aware, That secular policies and worldly interests, though they begin
never so plausibly, and ascend like vapors from fair grounds, yet they
presently thicken like mists into black clouds, drawing on jealousies and fears
like strong winds: These drive men to new counsels; after they plead
necessities; and from necessity obtain what indulgences and dispensations
soever, either prosperity, or adversity require, in order to that great Idol
Self-preservation; which even in the Church of Christ exalts it self above all
that is called God; far different from primitive practices, which were in ways
of self-denial, Christian patience, and civil subjection, losing their lives to
save them; following of Christ, in taking up his cross, Tert. Apol. de
Christianis. cap. 37. Omnia vestra implevimus, urbes, insulas, castella,
municipia, castra, palatium, senatum, forum, etc. Et tamen libenter trucidamur.
Et Cap. 30. Prec^ntes sumus semper pro omnibus Imperatoribus, etc.
when they wanted not numbers. All which holy Christian arts, by the
unnecessary designs, precipitant counsels, and rash adventures, of some
passionate, weak, or self-seeking men, are often forced to vale, and give place
to that, which is falsely called Reason of State; which loves not to be too
straight-laced with any ties of true and self-denying Religion; whose
passiveness is the best preservative, both of the Church, and of any true
Minister whatsoever.

11. Ministers much ^ow to themselves their shame.
All true and wise Ministers teach, (and so they should practice) That it is
better patiently to suffer Multa toller^^us quae non probamus. Aug.
some deformities in Church, and pressures in State, than to be violent actors
of any new ones, as a means to reform the old. And since the minds of men are
generally prone to measure counsels, and purposes, by the events, they do
easily conclude, That God never leaves a good cause (wherein his glory, and
Churches good were said to be so highly interessed, so in the loss and lapse,)
(as now the Presbyterian cause seems to be,) unless it were carried on by
impure hearts, or unwashen hands; either hypocrisy levening the end, or
iniquity defiling the means: Truly it is seldom, that God waters good plants
with so last streams, as he has done that, which some Ministers sought so
resolutely to plant in the Garden of this Church, what pains or perils soever
it cost them, or the public.

So that the present dangers, distresses, and complaints of many Ministers seem
to most people to be, but as the just retributions of vengeance upon the rude
frowardness, and factious forwardness, of many of them in civil troubles, which
was far different from the tender and wise charity of the good Samaritan. Luke
10.30.
For these men finding this Church and State much wounded, as it was going from
the Jericho of some grievances, to the Jerusalem of a through Reformation, (as
was pretended) were too liberal of their vinegar, and too nigardly of their
oil; by rash infusions, by undiscreet and unskilful searching the wounds, they
made them deeper, wider, more festred and incurable: (Clergy-mens hands usually
poisoning those light hurts in State, which they touch, or undertake to cure,
with neglect of their Spiritual cures and callings.)

Thus justly, and usually there follows the black shadow of shame and
confusion, when Ministers of the Church had rather appear cuning active
Statesmen, than honest quiet Churchmen; studying matchiavel, more than the
Gospel; as if they were ashamed of the still Mat. 12.19. He shall not strive,
nor cry, neither shall any men hear his voice in the streets. Acts 2.2.
voice and quiet spirit of Jesus Christ; which descended upon his Apostles, not
in the shape of flaming and dividing swords, but off Lingu^ Evangelica

fiery cloven tongues: And this, not to set the world on fire, or to scorch and
burn men, but softly to enlighten them; and by variety of gifts and graces,
sweetly to warm them to a love of God, and mutual charity: Which is far from
bringing in, either Christian Religion, or any Reformations, with wilde-fires,
whirl-winds, and earthquakes; wherein Christians had rather quite cast off the
cross of Christ from their shoulders, than bear it with any thing, which they
count a civil burden; and wherein the meanest Ministers are more ambitious to
wear a piece of the Popes Triple Crown on their heads, in an imaginary parity
of power, than either that of thorns, or that of olive branches; the one an
emblem of their patience, the other of their peaceableness: When the very
Novices and Beardless striplings, in the Ministry, which have but lately been
manumitted from the rod and ferula, are more eager to rule and govern all in an
absolute community, and Country parity, than either able to rule themselves, or
patient to be ruled, even by those that are worthy to be their Fathers, as
every way their Elders and Betters; whom Age and Nature, Custom, Law, Reason,
Religion, all order and polity among men, would have set as overseers over
them; (howsoever, to some uses and ends, those, the younger Preachers, may be
fit to be set over others, as Vshers of lower Forms:) When the passions and
exorbitancies of some Ministers, shall punish other men's failings and sins,
with greater of their own; and exceed what was most blamable in others, by such
defects of charity, or excesses of cruelty, as are most condemnable in such as
hold forth the love of God, and mercies of Christ to the World. What stability
can be hoped in men's esteem and love, to such as are of so variable tempers,
that they are not double, Jam. 1.8.
but treble minded men? sometimes Episcopal, then Presbyterian, after
Independents, next nothing at all, unless it be something of an hobling
Erastian; who runs like a Badger, with variating and unequal motions, yet still
keeping where the ridg of secular power goes highest; who is ashamed, not to
seem a Christian, but yet afraid to be taught and governed, as Christians were
in primitive times, when they had not the support of Civil Magistrates; whose
protection in Government and duties religious, the Church willingly and
thankfully embraces; but it cannot own the derivation of either its
Institutions, or its Discipline, from secular Powers and Laws.

12. Of changes in Ministers.
Not, that all mutation is the companion of folly or weakness; there are happy
inconstancies, and blessed Apostacies; from Error to Truth; from Heresy and
Schism, to Verity and Catholic unity; from factious pride, to obedient
humility; from impotent desires of governing, to patient submissions under due
and settled Government; from A castris Diaboli ad Dei tentoria, Felix transfuga,
and beatus Apostata. Luth. 1 These. 5.22.
the Devils camps, to Gods Tents. But then truth, and not faction; piety, and
not apparent self-interest; a change of manners to the better, as well as of
side, and principles, will follow; and not the least appearance once of evil:
From which, Ministers of all men, must abstain. There must be no show or shadow
of worstings and decays in holiness; of greater indifferencies in Religion; of
any licentiousness and immoralities in manners; Phil. 3.19.
any of which, discover their bellies, or this world, to be their god, more
than Jesus Christ, or the true God.

And (which is most ridiculous and intolerable) many Ministers in their
greatest rambl^ngs and shiftings, and separatings from themselves, and from all
gravity, order, and modesty; deserting their former Station, Ministry, and
Ordination; or taking it up upon some fanciful new way; some easy account of
popular calling to any place; yet still they are many times eager declamers
against Sects and Schisms, Heresies and Separations, Errors and corrupt
Opinions, etc. that is against all that are not of their party, way, and
faction: Not considering, that like Gehazi, the leprosy of those Syrians,
cleaves to many of their own foreheads, who carry their heads full high.

Now after all this, (which I reckon up, not in bitterness, but in charity, not
for a reproach Dum peccata aliorum confiteor, ipse compatiar, nec superbe
increpo, sed lugeo; and dum alium fleo meipsum de fleo. Ambr. de Poen. l. 2. c.
8. (...). Stobaeus.
, but for a motive to repentance, in my self, or any other, that may be guilty
of any thing, unworthy and scandalous to our holy Profession;) It cannot seem
strange, if Ministers are generally looked upon, as naked and ashamed of
themselves; since many of them, have wantonly sinned themselves out of that
innocence and protection (together with that love, respect, estate, and honor)
which formerly they enjoyed; when publicks Laws and Authority compassed them
about; keeping them, as in subjection and due obedience, so in plenty, safety,
love, and respect. Which last, (preserving them from irreverence, affronts, and
vulgar insolency) is easily obtained, when once the common people see that
Power stands Sentinel, and Civil Favor keeps a Guard, on any Men, or any
Calling. Indeed, with the common sort of people, it matters not much, what
straw and clouts the Scarecrow be made of, so it be set upon a Pole.

By these secular and worldly temptations, has the Devil, 13. Ministers way of
recovery.
in great part, beguiled the Ministers and the Ministry of England, of that
favor, and those blessings which they once enjoyed; which to recover, by Gods
help, must be the work, not of weak, heady, popular, passionate, factious, and
clamorous men, who are resolved never to confess any Incidere in errorem
imperiti est animi, at perseverare, postquam agnoveris, contumacis est. Salvia.
l. 5.
error or transport, but to continue in that troublesome and rugged path of
novel opinions, State projects, and secular ambitions; wherein they see they
have lost themselves past all recovery, without ingenuous retractation and
speedy amendment. The rashness and obstinacy of such Vzzahs, is not fit to stay
the tottering Ark, who have almost quite overturned it; nor ever will they be
able to bring back the pristine honor of the Ministry, or the majesty of the
Reformed Religion: Their penitence, public, real, and as bold as their sin and
error, will more recover and recommend them, than all those murmurings and
complaints, by which they scratch one another itch; and confirm each other in
their erroneous obstinacy, and defeated novelties. Vere poenitentes pudoris
magis memores, quam salutis, esse non debent. August.
Ingenuous confessings and forsakings of their follies, facilities,
superstitious heats and immoderations, will best reconcile them, not only to
God and man, but also to themselves: Who can have little peace, while they are
pertinacious in their errors, and are impatient to recant any thing, either in
opinion or practice, although never so much amiss and blasted, both by the
disfavor of God and man. This opiniativeness and restiveness in extern Forms of
Religion, is likely, to be the greatest obstruction, which will hinder the
recovery of Ministers to unity, order, and honor; which was ever greatest, when
for their painful preaching, and peaceable living, they were persecuted by
others, Heathens, or Heretics, or Schismatics; who never wanted will to vex
the Orthodox Christians, when ever they had power; were their beginings never
so gentle, and their pretensions never so specious: But then is the regard to
Ministers least, or none at all, when they turn Pragmaticks instead of
Preachers; Persecutors instead of Peacemakers; and sticklers for, and with the
world, rather than sufferers with, and for Christ. Since, being Ministers of
Jesus Christ, the Lamb slain for the sins of the World, they are more comely on
the rack, and at the stake; in the prison and dungeon, with bolts and chains,
with wounds and brands for Christ's sake, than with Buff-coats and Belts, and
Banners, and Trophes, dipped in and defiled with the (...). Naz. Orat. 40.
blood of their People, and Neighbors, and Governors, in any case whatsoever.
Sure, it is hard for Ministers of the Gospel, to pick out Letters of Mart from
the Gospel, or to have any Commission to kill and slay, from Jesus Christ; in
order to reform Religion, or to plant any of his clearest Institutions; much
less to pull down any ancient good orders in the Church, or to set up any new
ones; which have so much of man's vanity and passion, that they cannot have any
thing of Christ's divine appointment,

Nor is this meek and passive temper, requisite in a true Minister, any softness
and cowardice, but the greatest valor and magnanimity; which, having least of
revenge, passion, self-seeking, humane faction, and worldly interest, (which
are always dubious in their rise, and prone to be exorbitant in their progress,
and most injurious in their success) have most of Love, Patience, and Christian
Charity; which are indisputably commendable in the Christian, Psalm. 15.4.
though they be to the man's own hinderance.

It will not be asked of Ministers of the Gospel, at the last account, who
fought, and slew, and spoiled, etc. but who fasted and prayed, and mourned, for
the sins and judgments on the Nation, and Church; nor will they easily be
found in Gods Book of Martyrs, who died upon disputable quarrels in Civil Wars,
while they neglected the indisputable duty of their Office and Ministry.

Levit. 10.19. Thou shall not sow thy field with mingled seed. Incongruam non
probat mixturam Deus, and bonitate simplicissimus and simplicitate optimus.
August.
Ministers never reap less crops of love or respect from men, than when they
sow that forbidden mislane; the Tares and Cockle of passionate novelties,
unproved opinions, and civil dissentions, among the seeds of Religion, and
essays of Reformation: From which mixtures, those Ministers, whose gravity,
wisdom, and humility, have most withheld, or soonest withdrawn their hearts and
hands, are the likeliest men, by their piety, moderation, patience, and
constancy, in holy and justifiable ways, to recover and restore the dignity of
their Calling; Who in the midst of those great and wide inrodes, which have
much broken down the fence, and occasioned the letting in all sorts of wild
beasts upon the Lords Vineyard of this Church; while others, like dead stakes,
formerly making a great show in the hedge, are found rotten, weak, and unsound:
These are evidenced to all true Christians, to be as living standards; well
rooted in their pious principles, and not easily removed from that
stedfastness, and meekness of their practices in ways of judicious constancy;
which they have hitherto with patience maintained, in the midst of those
tempests, which have not so utterly overwhelmed them, but that in many places
they appear fixed and unmoved in their pious integrity, and patient charity;
which makes them looked upon with some eye of pity, love, and honor, by all
ingenuous spectators; while yet, they generally reflect with scorn and
laughter, on many others; who in the public storm, thought themselves gallant
sailers and skilful steersmen; yet having made great waste of their patience,
obedience, and discretion, they seem also much cracked in their conscience,
credit, and reputation; For seeking, inconsiderately, to pull down, or to
possess themselves of others Cabins, (who as Pilots had a long time safely
steered the Ship) they have almost split, and sunk the whole Vessel, wherein
they and others were embarked: Nor will they any way be able to buoy it up
again, or stop the daily increasing, and threatening leaks, till forsaking those
soft and shameful compliances with factious novelties, and immoderate ways of
vulgar reformings, they return to that primitive firmness, and indisputable
simplicity of the Ancient (which were the putest and best formed) Churches,
both as to Doctrine, Discipline, and Government; which no learned and
unpassionate man needs go far to find out, either in Scripture paterns, or in
the Churches after-imitation; by which the dignity of the Ministry, and Holy
Mysteries of the Gospel, always preserved themselves, amidst the hottest
persecutions, both in the love, and obedience of all sound and sober Christians.

So that in my judgment, who know how hard it is to play an after-game in
point of Reputation, and who have no design but a Public and Common good,
(writing thus freely, as under the favor, so without the offense, I hope, of
any good man) The Ministers of this Church will never be able to stand before
those men of Ai, their many adversaries; who are daily scattering them into
many feeble factions, and pursuing them every where (so divided) with scorn;
and afflicting them with many affronts and injuries; until having taken a
serious review of their late extravagancies, and making a serious scrutiny into
their consciences; and finding (as they needs must, if they be not wilfully
blind, or obstinate) some accursed thing, some Babylonish garment, and wedg of
Gold; something wherein proud, or ambitious, or covetous, or revengeful or
injurious emulations, or other more venial errors have tempted t^^ (...) to
offend; they cast them quite away; and so humbly re'ally themselves, to that
Primitive Harmony, that Excellent Discipline, Order, and Government, wherein
was the honor, beauty, and consistency of the Church and Christian Religion,
even when least protected and most opposed by secular powers: Of whom Christian
Bishops, Ministers, and People, never asked leave, either to believe in Jesus
Christ, or to live after that holy form and public order, wherein Jesus
Christ, and the blessed Apostles after him, established and left them, which
obtained universal imitation, and use in all Churches, for many hundred of
years, from true Christians, both Pastors and People, in the midst of
persecutions.

14. Jere. 6.16. Thus says the Lord, Stand in the ways and see, and ask for
the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and ye shall find rest
for your souls.
Out of which old and good way of Primitive Unity, Order, Government,
Discipline, and holy Ministrations, if those immoralities be kept, (as they may
most easily) to which (we see) the lusts and passions of men are prone to run,
even in all Non datur reditus ad unitatem nisi per veritatem, nec ad veritatem
nisi per vetustatem; Quum illud est antiquissimum, quod verissimum. Cypr.
novel forms and inventions, (pretend they never so much, at first, to glorious
Reformations;) Nothing can be a more present and soverein restorative for this
Church, and the true Reformed Religion, to settle with truth, and peace among
us; both to the comfort of all able Ministers, and the satisfaction of all
sober Christians; who study the truth, and unity of the Faith, not the power
and prevalency of any faction: We need not go far to seek the root and source
of our miseries present or impendent, which have brought forth so bitter
fruits; whereby God at once would show and satisfy vain men with their own
delusions Isai. 66.4.

tongues, and to the Jere. 17.5. Cursed be the man that trusts in man, and

arm of flesh, in politic machinations, than to the living God, in holy and
humble ways of truth and peace, have soon found them to be, both vain and
cursed things.

As it is evident at this day in the sad fate, which some Ministers folly,
presumption, and precipitancy, together with other sinful frailtiles, and
excesses, have brought upon themselves and their whole Function in this Church.
Who, first despising, then destroying the Ancient and Catholic conduits of
their Order and Ministry, (which, derived from Christ, by his Apostles; went on
in an after constant succession of true Ministerial Power and Authority,) have
dug to themselves, Jere. 2.13.
empty broken cisterns, of novel and divided ways, which can hardly hold any
water; Jude 12.
but like wandering clouds without water, affecting Supremacy, or Parity, or
Popularity in Church power, they have almost brought it to a nullity; through
the incroaching and over-bearing of Blebeian Insolence; who finding Ministers
thus divided among themselves, and scrambling for Church power in common,
without any order or distinction, either of Age, or gifts and parts; the common
people (being the most) begin to conceit and challenge to themselves, first a
share, next the supremacy and original of all Church power; as if in the
illiterate heads, illiberal hearts, and mechanic hands of the common sort of
Christians, (and, without reproach, the most part of them, and the forwardest
of them, against the Function of the Ministry, have been and ever will be of no
higher rank, breeding or capacity,) Jesus Christ had placed the Keys of
Heaven, the power eminent and paramount of all Church authority, and holy
administrations; which Christ eminently, and his Apostles ministerially had,
and exercised; afterward committing them to able and faithful men; such as
(doubtless) were many degrees raised above the vulgar, and distinguished in
gifts and power Ministerial, both ordinary and extraordinary.

Thus from the head, and shoulders, and arms, ( Jesus Christ, the Apostles, the
succeeding Bishops and Presbyters) which were of Gold and Silver, Church power
is by some forced to descend to the belly, thighs, and feet of the people,
which are part of Iron, Dan. 2.32.
and part of miry-clay: Most of whom, so much stickling to be controlers of
Christ's household (the Church) are not in any discreet and sober man's judgment,
fit to be stewards, or scarce in any degree of ingenuous service, in a well
ordered family; They may make good Gibeonites for the house of God, but very
ill Levites or Priests.

Thus I have showed how the sparks of many Ministers passionate opinions, and
violent practices, flying up and down in their many disorderly breathings and
extravagant Motions, both in Church and State; they at last, lighting upon the
thatched houses, the combustible stuff of common peoples minds, and manners,
have set their own houses on fire, to the deformity, discontent, and danger of
all that dare own themselves, and their holy Function, as delivered to them
from a better and diviner hand.

Lords mercies, that we have not been, ere this, utterly consumed both root and
branch, for our follies and strange fires, by the malice, cruelty, and despite
of those, to whose rage, as to the Seas, the Lord has hitherto set bounds; who
are our enemies, not for our sins and failings, but for the reformed truths,
and Gospels sake, which we preach and profess. Amidst the sequestrings,
plunderings, silencings, wastings, affronts, calumnies, indignities, and
discouragements cast upon, or threatened by some, against those of the Ministry,
above any other calling; as if the Crosses taken down from Steeples and
Churches, were to be laid on the necks and shoulders of Ministers; It is a
wonder, that any remnant of godly, able, and true Ministers, has hitherto
escaped, through the indulgence of God, and the favor or moderation of some in
power; who know not (it seems) how to reprobate all those as Antichristian, by
whose Ministry, they may hope, themselves and others, either are, or may be
brought to the saving faith of Jesus Christ, and to the hope of Gods elect:
Exodus 2.8.
Nor can they yet be persuaded, to act as Pharaohs, that knew not Joseph.

So that we cannot, but wonder (with thankfulness to God, and to those who now
exercise civil power among us) that, the Reformed Ministers and Ministry in
this Church, have not been made like Sodom and Gomorrah; when we consider, how
many showers of fiery darts, from violent and cruel men, like thick clouds
(pregnant with thunders and lightnings) hang over our heads. J^lian took away
from the Clergy, all immunities, honors, and provisions of corn formerly by
Emperors given to them; he abrogated all Laws in favor of them. Sozonen. l. 5.

Who like Julian the Apostate, are impatient of nothing so much as this, That
their should be any true Ministers or Ministry, in due order, holy Authority,
Evangelical succession, and settled maintenance, continued in this, or any other
Reformed Church. Who seeking to join the Lions skin to the Fox's, would fain
leven Military spirits against the Ministry, that so the Soldiery might use, or
rather abuse, their Helmets as Bushels Matthew. 5.15.
, under which they may put the Candles of the Ministry; thereby to overwhelm
and extinguish those lamps of true Religion; pretending, that some Troopers
flaming swords, as the guard of Cherubims, will be more useful to keep the way
of the tree of life, than all those burning and shining lights of the true
Ministers, who are rightly called and ordained in the Church; whose learned
labors, and patient sufferings in all ages, from the Apostles times, have
undoubtedly planted, watered, propagated, and (under God) preserved the true
Christian Religion; either from Heathenish ignorance, Idolatry, Atheism,
Profaneness and Persecution, on the one side; or from Antichristian Errors,
Superstitions, Corruptions and Confusions, on the other.

16. Politic and Atheistical Engines used by some against the Ministry.
Yet are there now, not only secret underminings, but open engines used, by
which some men endeavor utterly to overthrow these great boundaries, firm
supports, and divine constitutions of Christian Religion; the Authority,
Office, Power, and Succession of the true Ministers, and Ministry of the
Gospel: Which plots and practices can be nothing else, but the devils highway,
either to utter Atheism, Irreligion, and Profaneness; or to the old grosser
Popery, Error, and Superstition; or, at best, to those detestable and damnable
formalities in matters of Religion, which our late Seraphick Sadduces, or
Matchiavellian Christians have learned, and confidently profess. Some of whom
(like Jezebel, Rev. 2.20.
that made her self a Prophetess, or like the old Irenaeus l. 1. c. 35.

and the like rabble of wretches) have their wild speculations, beyond what is
written in the holy Scriptures, or ever believed and practiced in the Churches
of Christ; who teach men to think, say, and write, That God, Christ Jesus, the
holy Spirit, good Angels and Devils; the Scriptures, Law, and Gospel, Ministry
and Sacraments; the Souls immortality and eternity; the Resurrection and
Judgment to come; all Virtue and Vice; Good and Evil; Heaven and Hell, all are
but mere fanciful forms of words, fabulous imaginations, feigned dreams, empty
names; being nothing without us, or above us. That all this, which men call
Religion, is nothing else, but the issues of humane inventions; which, by the
cunning of some, the credulity of others, and the custom of most men, serves,
where seconded with power, to scare and amuse the world, so as to keep the
vulgar in some aw and subjection.

And in their best and foberest temper, they hold, That no Religion is, or
ought to be other, than a lackey and dependant, on secular power; that piety
must be subordinate to policy; that there the people serve God well enough,
where they are kept in subjection to those that rule them: From whose politic
dispensations and allowances, they are humbly and contentedly to receive what
Scriptures, Law, and Gospel, holy Institutions, Ministry, and Religion, those,
who govern them, think fittest, whereby to preserve themselves in power, and
others in peace under them. That, where the principles of Christian, or
Reformed Religion (which has so far obtained credit in these Western parts of
the World) do cross, or condemn the designs, and interests of those in
Sovereinty, (how unjustifiable soever they are for righteousness or true
holiness;) yet are they, by Reasons of State, and the supposed Laws of
Necessity, first to be dispensed withal, and actually violated: Next, by
secret warpings, variations, connivencies; and tollerations, they are to be
ravelled, weakened, discountenanced, and decryed. Thus gradually, and fuly
introducing new parties and factions in Religion; which, cried up by men of
looser principles, profaner wits, and flattering tongues; also set off and
sweetened with novelty, profit, and power, will soon bear down, and cast out,
with specious shows, of easier, cheaper, freer, and safer modellings, all true
Religion, and the true Ministry of it; and all the ancient, (if they seem
contrariant ways) though never so well settled, and approved, not only by the
best and holiest of men; but, as to their constant preservation, even by God
himself.

Indeed, all experience teaches us, 17. Ambition the Much of true Religion.
That no passion in the soul of man is less patient of sober, just, and truly
religious bounds, than Luctanter and agree fert humana ambiti^ Christi jug^^, am
Dei Imperitur; nec libe^ter crutem gi^^^^ ^ui sceptra captant and diademata
aucupantur. Parisiens.
Ambition; which will rather adventure, as it were, to countermand, and
overruled God himself, than fail to rule over man. Nor has any thing caused
more changes, tossings, and persecutions, in the Church, than this forcing
religious rectitudes, and the immutable rules of divine Truth, Order, and holy
Institutions, to bend to, and comply with, the Cupido dominandi cunctis
affectibus dominantior. Tacit. An. l. 15.

interests, Insomuch, that very Reformations pretended, and by well meaning men
intended, have oftentimes degenerated to great deformities; through the
immoderations, and transports of those, who cannot in reason of State (as they
pretend) subject themselves to, or continue to use those severer rules of
righteousness; or follow those primitive examples of holy Discipline and
Religious orders, which Christ and his Church has set before them; but they
must so far wrest and innovate Religion, formerly established, and remove the
ancient Landmarks, which their forefathers observed, as they find, or fancy
necessary to the interest of that party or power, which they have undertaken.

Hence inevitably follows by those unreasonable Pope Pius the fifth, could not
with patience hear of Ragioni di Stato, counting those pretensions to be
against all true Religion, and Moral Virtues, L. Verul.
Reasons of State, (which, not the Word of God, nor his providence, nor any
true prudence, but only some men's fancies, passions, lusts, and follies, make
necessary,) That the ancient established Ministry, and true Ministers, be they
never so able, worthy, useful, and necessary, must either be quite removed, and
changed; or else, by degrees drawn to new Modellings and Conformities; which
can never be done, without great snares to many, injuries to others, and
discouragements to all, that have any thing in them of Religious setledness;
whose pious and judicious constancy in their holy way and profession, choosing
rather to serve the Lord, than the variating humors of any men and times, shall
be judged pertinacy, faction, and the next step to Rebellion; how useful,
peaceable, and commendable soever their gifts, and minds, and manners be, in
the Church of Christ.

Tarpeian rock, and precipice, by Gods permission, and the English worlds
variation in Civil and Ecclesiastical affairs, does seem to be brought (as to
some men's designs and purposes) the whole frame and being of the Reformed
Religion in this Church of England, as to its formerly established Doctrine,
Discipline, Government, and true Ministry. Not, but that I know, the Lord Jesus
Christ can withdraw this his Church and Ministers (as he did himself) from
their malice, Luke 4.30.

advantages of War, which he had gotten, and to refer the Government of that
Kingdom to twelve Wisemen; who erected to the memory of that Princes piety, one
of the stateliest Pyramids of Egypt, which yet remains: How much more will it
become Christians in any way of Power and Magistracy, not to make their way
upon the spoils, nor lay the foundations, or to carry on the fabric of their
greatness and dominion, upon the carcasses and ruins of such as are able,
true, and faithful Ministers of the true God, and the Lord Jesus Christ?

However my own private comforts of life might other ways be, either secure, or
satisfactory; yet how can I with silence, or as Nehemiah without sadness, Nehe.

behold the miseries of many my Brethren and Companions? For whose sakes, I
cannot but have great compassion, even in worldly regards; well knowing, that
many, if not far the most of them, have born the heat and burden of the late
days, or years rather, of great tribulation, beyond any sorts of men; to whom
have been allowed some ways, either for reparation, or composition, or
restitution, or oblivion: But not so to any Ministers; from some of whom has
been exacted the whole tale of Bricks, as to the necessary labors of their
Ministry, and charges, when the straw of maintenance has, in great part, been,
either denied to them, or some way exacted from them; nor was ever any public
ease, or relief granted to them in that regard.

But it becomes neither them, nor me, in this particular, to plead or complain,
as to any private interests, pressures, or indignities, already sustained. The
Lord is righteous and holy, though we be wasted, impoverished, and exhausted;
yea, though we be accounted, as the offscouring of all things (1 Cor. 4.13.)
and as unsavory salt fit to be cast on the dunghill. (Matthew. 5.13.) While there
are so many Vel in hoc uno maxim inidonei, quod sibi idonei videntur tam
tremendo Ministerio. Jeron.
hasty intruders, and confident undertakers of the work of the Ministry, yet
the best and ablest of us all, desire before the majesty of God, in all
humility to confess, That we are less than the least of his mercies; that none
of us are, as to Gods exactness, or the weight of the work, 2 Cor. 2.16. 2 Cor.
4.7. Non thesaurus debonestatur vasculo, sed vas decoratur thesaur^. Prosp.
sufficient for that sacred Office and Ministry.

Yet since this heavenly treasure has been duly committed to such earthen
vessels, who have wholly devoted, even from their youth, their studies, lives,
and labors, to the service of Christ, and his Church, in this work of the
Ministry; since the public wages and rewards for that holy service, have by
the order of humane Laws, by the piety, bounty, and justice, of this Christian
Nation, been hitherto conferred upon them, and they rightly possessed of them;
I cannot but present to the considerations of all men, that have piety, equity,
or humanity in them, That there are no objects of pity and compassion, more
pitifully calamitous and distressed, than those many learned and modest men,
the godly and faithful Ministers of this Church of England, either are already,
or are shortly like to be, if the malice of their adversaries be permitted to
run in its full scope and stream against them; which will be like that flood,
which the old Serpent, Rev. 12.15.
and great red Dragon, cast out of his mouth after the woman, (the Church)
which would carry away both mother and child, old and young, the sons with the
fathers, true piety with the whole profession; the present Ministers with all
future Succession, as to any right Authority, and lawful Ordination or Mission.

19. The cunning and cruelty of some against the Ministry.
What I pray you (O excellent Christians, all whose other excellencies are most
excelled in your Christian pity and compassion) can be more deplorable, than to
see so many persons of ingenuous education, good learning, honest lives,
diligent labors, (after so much time devoted chiefly to serve God, their
Country, and the Church of Christ, and the souls of their Brethren, with their
Studies, Learning, and Labors) to be turned, or wearied out, of their honest
and holy employment; to be so cast out of their houses and homes, together with
all their nearest relations; to be forced to begin some new methods of life, in
some mean employment or dependence; and this in the declining and infirmer age
of many? wherein they must either want their bread, or beg it; or, at best,
with much contention, against the armed man, Pr v. 24.34.
Poverty, in labor and sorrow, night and day, they must mingle their bread with
ashes, and their drink with weeping; when they shall be deprived of all those
public rewards and settled encouragements, (which God knows, were neither very
liberal in most places, nor much to be envied, if Matthew. 24.12. Desti^^e
charitate ^^cess^ est abundare nequitiam, quum non auferantur iniquitatis
stercora nisi per charitatia fluenta, and (...), and gentem, and rempublicam,
and ecclesiam validissi^^ purg^^tia. August. Tep^^to ^^^ri^^^^ fervore
friges^^^ and rigoscunt conscientiae. Bern.
charity did not grow cold, and iniquity abound) wherewith the whole labor of
their lives, their learning and chargable studies, besides their industry,
humility, and other virtues, were but meanly, yet, to them, contentedly
recompensed, by those Laws of public piety and munificence; which invested
Ministers in their places and livings, after the same Ministers have the same
Right to their Ecclesiastic estates by Magna Charta, as others have to their
Temporalities. Concessimus quod Ecclesia Anglicana libera sit in perpetuum, and
habeat omnia jura sua integra, and omnes libertates sua^ illaesas. Magna

of not paying Tithes, where due.
tenure for life, and good behavior, that any man enjoys his freehold in house
or land; keeping himself within the compass of the Law.

And that the barbarity, impiety, and monstrosity of the injury, may seem the
less with the common people, all these sufferings of poverty and necessity
(which either have fallen upon some, or threaten other true Ministers in this
Church,) must be attended with the black Pereuntibus (Christianis sub Tiberio)
addita ludibria, ut serarum tergis contecti lania^^ can^^^ interirent, and ubi
dofecisset dies in usum nocturni luminis flammali urebantur. Tac. An. l. 19.
Luke 23.34. Joh. 11.48. and 18.38.
shadows of all evil speaking and reviling; such as was used to their great
master and institutor Jesus Christ; when he was to be thus crucified with
contempt, lest the Romans come and destroy the City (though there was nothing
found in him, by his Judge, worthy of death.) That so the proud mockers of the
Ministry, may say with scorn, Behold, these men of God; these that pretended to
preach salvation to others, let them now come down, and save themselves from
that Jesuitick, Socinian, and mechanic Cross, to which they are with all cruel
petulancy, either now, or shortly (as their malicious enemies hope and boast)
to be fixed.

O what would the enemies of this Reformed Church and State, 20. Hoc Ithacus
velit, and magn^ mercentur Atride. Virg.
whatever they are, have wished more to crown their envious desires; and
consummate their malicious designs; than to see, that woeful day, wherein this
abomination (which threatens to make the Reformed Religion desolate, in this
Church of England,) being set up, the whole Function and Succession of the true
and lawful Ministry here, should be questioned, cashiered, triumphed over, and
trampled upon, by the foot of Ignorance, Error, Popery, Jesuitism, Atheism,
Profaneness, and all sorts of disorderly minds and manners?

All which heretofore felt the powerful restraints, the mighty chains, the just
terrors and torments cast upon them, by the convincing Sermons, learned
Writings, frequent Prayers, and holy examples of many excellent Ministers in
England; before whom the devils of ignorance, error, profaneness, schism, and
superstition, Luke 10.18. Vera fulgente luce flaccessit fulguris coruscatio,
terrore magis quam lumine conspicua. Chrysostom.
were wont to fall as lightning to the ground, from their fanatic Heavens.

Have all these Sons of Thunder and of Consolation too, (who were esteemed
heretofore by all Reformed Christians in this Church, to be as Angels of God,
Ambassadors from Heaven, Friends of Christ, the Bridegroom of their Souls; more
precious than fine Gold; dearer, to humble and holy men, than their right eyes;
the beauty of this Church, and blessing of this Nation,) Have they all been
hitherto; but as Mahumetan Juglers, or Messengers of Satan, or Priests of Baal,
or as the cheating Pontifs of the Heathen gods and oracles? Have they all been
found liars for God, and born false witness against the Truth, and Church of
Christ? Have they arrogantly and falsely Numb. 16.3. Ye take too much upon you,
since all the Congregation is holy, every one of them, etc. Wherefore lift ye
up your selves above the Church of the Lord? Thus Korah and his company against
Moses and Aaron.
taken too much upon them, in exalting themselves above their line and measure?
Or magnifying their Office and Ministry, above the common degree or sort of
Christians?

And why all this art, fraud, and improbity of labor in Ministers! (Sure, with
the g eater sin and shame learned and knowing men should weary themselves in
their iniquity, Quo minor tentatio to majus peccatum. Aquin.
when they had so little temptation to be, either false or wicked, in so high a
nature:) Alas, For what has been, and is, all this pompous pains, and
hypocritical sweat of Ministers? Is it not for some poor living, for the most
part; for a sorry subsistence, a dry morsel, a threadbare coat, a cottagely
condition? In comparison of that plenty, gallantry, superfluity, splendour, and
honor, wherewith other callings (which require far less ability or pains) have
invited and entertained their professors in this plentiful Land? Judges 8.6.
Are not the gleanings of the grapes of Ephraim, better than the vintage of
Abiezer? Are not the superfluities Merito a secularibus negotiatoribus and
lucro, and praemio superamur, quum caelestia and aeterna a Christo expectamus
munera. Jeron.
of any ingenuous calling, beyond the necessaries of most Ministers? And all
this, that after infinite studies, pale watchings, fervent prayers, frequent
tears, daily cares, and endless pains, exhausting their Time, Spirits, Estates,
and Health, they might, through many vulgar slightings, reproaches, and
contempts, with much patience condemn themselves and their relations, first to
Grave est paupertatis onus ubi deest bonae conscientiae levamen; qua sublevante
gravescit nihil, qua dulcante nihil amarescit. Petrach.
poverty; which is no light burden, where a good conscience is wanting, or an
evil one attending (as in this case malice does suppose.)

And, now at last, (after more than One thousand five hundred years, and one
Century and half since the Reformation) in all which time this Nation has more
or less enjoyed the inestimable blessing (for so our pious Ancestors esteemed
the lights of this World, the true Ministers of the Church, in their Prayers,
Preaching, Writings, holy Offices, and Examples,) they should by some men be
thought unworthy of any further public favors or employment, and to have
merited to be counted as sheep for the slaughter Rom 8.16. For thy sake are we
counted as sheep for the slaughter, and killed all the day long; Lani^na
diaboli Christi victima. Leo. They are Christ's Lambs, whom the Devil delights
most to ^utcher.
, in their persons: And as to their Function or Calling (which was ever
esteemed sacred among true Christians) to be wholly laid aside and outed, with
all disgraceful obloquies; as if they had been, but pious Impostors, devout
Usurpers, and religious Monopolizers, of that holy Ordination, divine Mission,
Power, and Authority, which Christ gave personally to the Apostles; and both by
declared intent, and clear command, to their due and rightful Successors, in
that ordinary Ministry which is necessary for the Churches good: Or at best
they must be reputed, but as superfluous, burthensom, and impertinent, both in
Church and State; chargeable to the public purse; dangerous to the public
peace; useless as to any peculiar power of holy Administrations; which some
think may be more cheaply, easily, and safely, supplied by other forward
pretenders; who think themselves endued with greater plenitude of the Spirit,
with rarer gifts, with diviner illuminations, more immediate teachings, and
special anointings; by which, without any pains or studies, they are suddenly
invested into the full office and power Ministerial: And as they are themselves
led, so they can infallibly lead all others, into all truth; with such
wonderful advantages of ease, and thrift, both for men's pains and purses, that
there will be no need to entertain that ancient form, and succession of
ordained Ministers, as any peculiar calling or function, amidst so gifted and
inspired a Nation. So much more sweet, and fruitful, do these self-planted
Country Crabs, and Wildings, now seem to many, than those Trees of Paradise,
which, with great care and art, have been grafted, pruned, and preserved by
most skilful hands; which these new sprouts look upon, and cry down, as only
full of Moss and Missletow.

In this case then, O you excellent Christians, such freedom, as I now use, I
hope may seem not only pardonable, but approvable, and imitable to all good
Christians, who fear God, and love the Lord Jesus Christ; who have any care of
their own souls, any charity to the Reformed Churches, any pity to their
Country, any tenderness to the religious welfare of posterity: And in a matter
of so great and public importance, it is hoped, and expected by all good men,
That none of you, either in your private places, or public power and
influences, will by any inconsiderate, and mean compliance, gratify the evil
minds of unreasonable men, in order to compass the Devils most Antichristian
designs; who seeks by such devices, first to deceive you, next to destroy, and
damn, both you and your posterity: Your Blasphemiae proximum est Christiani
silentium, ubi Christi causa agitur, and negligitur; quam filend^ aque prodimus
ac Judas salutando, aut Petrus abnegando. Jeron.
silence or reservedness, in such a cause, and at such a time, as this, will be
your sin; as it would have been mine: How much more, if you use not your
uttermost endeavors, in all fair and Christian ways, to stop this Stygian
stream; but most of all, if you contribute any thing of that power you have,
whereby to carry on this poisonous and soul-destroying torrent. Words are never
more due, than in Christ's behalf, who is the Incarnate Word; and for his
Ministers, who are the Preachers of that Word.

22. The sense of the best Christians, as to the Ministers case. 2 Samuel 19.30.
Non is this my private sense and horror alone, but I know you (O excellent
Christians (who are (truly) men of pious and public; not of proud, or
pragmatick spirits,) cannot but daily perceive, That it is the general fear and
grief of honest and truly reformed Christians, in this Nation; Who with one
mouth are ready to say to those in place and power, as Abraham did to the King
of Sodom, or Mephibosheth to David; Let those cunning, cruel, and covetous
Zibas (whose treacherous practices, and ungrateful calumnies, seek to deprive
us of our Houses, Goods, Lands, and Liberties,) let them take all, so as our
David, the beloved of our souls, our Christ, our true Religion, our glory, our
true Ministers and Ministry, may be safe; Let others take the spoils and
booties of our labors, Genesis 14.21.
only give us the souls of our selves, and our posterity, for a prey; which
are like to perish for ever, unless you leave us those holy means, and that
sacred Ministry, which the wisdom and authority of Christ only could (as he
has) appoint; which the Churches of Christ have always enjoyed, and faithfully
transmitted to us for the saving of our sinful souls. This request, the very
Turks unasked, do yet grant in some degree to the poor Christians; who live
under their dominion.

And if it may seem to be our error and fondness, thus to prise our true and
faithful Ministers, Illos nimis diligere non possumus Christiani, quorum
Ministerio and Deum diligimus, and a Deo diligimur. Cypr.
and that only divine Authority, which is in their Ministry; yet vouchsafe to
indulge us in the midst of so many epidemical errors, this one pious error, and
grateful fondness; which not custom and tradition, but conscience and true
judgment have fixed in us; since we esteem, next Vnicus est modus diligendi
Deum nescire modum. Aug.
God, and our blessed Savior, and the holy Scriptures, the true Ministry of
the Church, as that holy necessary ordinance which the divine wisdom and mercy,
has appointed, whereby to bring us to the saving knowledge of God, and our
Lord Jesus Christ, by the Scriptures; That, as we ow to our parents, under God,
our Natural and Sinful Being (whom yet we are bid to honor;) so our Christian,
Mystical, and Spiritual Being, 1 Cor. 4.15. Though you have ten thousand
teachers in Christ, yet you have not many fathers; For in Christ Jesus I have
begotten you through the Gospel.
we ow to our true Ministers, as our holy and spiritual Fathers; by whose care
we have been truly taught, and duly Baptized, with divine Authority, in the
Name of the blessed Trinity; both instructed, and sacramentally confirmed in
that faith, which is the only true way of eternal life.

By their study, pains, love, and diligence (when we would have been otherwise
willingly ignorant, and wholly negligent of our souls good) our darkness (by
Gods grace and blessing on their labors (chiefly) has been dispelled; our
ignorance enlightened; our deadness enlivened; our enmity against God, and our
Neighbor, removed; our hardness softened; our consciences purged; our lusts
mortified; our lives, (as to an holy purpose, prayer, and endeavor) reformed;
our terrors scattered; our ghostly enemies vanquished; our peace and comforts
obtained; our souls raised and sealed to a blessed hope of eternal life,
through the mercies of God, and the merits of our Redeemer; whose Ambassadors,
our true Ministers are ^. And indeed, we have no greater sign, or surer
evidence of our faith in Christ, and love unfeigned to God, than this, That we
love and reverence those, and their calling, as men who only have authority in
Chriss name to administer holy things to us.

And however others (who have lately sought to come in, 23. Of Pra^enders to
the Ministry.
not in Seducunt e via incautos viatores, ut securius ipsos perdant
lenocinantes lairenes. Greg.

the Church by Ordination. Bishop Downam Sermon.
thieves and robbers to lead us plainer people out of the right way, that they
may the better rob and spoil us,) pretend they are so rarely gifted, that they
will teach us the same, or higher truths; and administer the same holy things
in a new and more excellent way, than ever the best ordained Ministers of this
Church have done: Yet truly, (saving the confident boasting of these new
masters) we could never, hitherto, discern in any of them, either by their much
speech, or writing (with which they may make a great sound, and yet be very
empty) any such sufficiencies as they lift every where so much to boast of:
Muchless have they ever produced any show of Scriptural power, Divine
authority, Mission from Christ, or footstep of Apostolical succession in the
Church; in which, every one that can speak tollerably, we cannot think is
presently sent of God, for a public Minister of holy things; no more than
every well-spoken Traveller, or diligent Factor, or Carrier, is a Public
Agent, Herald, or Ambassador to any Prince, or State, or City; although they
may know their Princes, Masters, or Neighbors mind, in many things. We know it
is not, what waters men fancy, but what God appoints, which will cure the
blind or leprous.

And we find by daily sad experience, that they, whose pride or peevishness
forsakes, or scorns to use the waters of Jordan (the means which Christ has
instituted, and the Ministers, which by his Church he has ordained) do
commonly get no Sacra mysteria non vi naturali^, sed voluntate dei

done if he had gone to his so much extolled Rivers of Damascus, and had
forsaken Jordan: They may a little wash over, and for a while seem to hide men's
leprosies of Ignorance, Error, Pride, Levity, Schism, Licentiousness, and
Apostasy, but they cannot heal them; yea, rather they provoke the itch of
novelty, and increase the leprous scurff of obstinacy; by which men refuse to
be healed, and glory in their despising, and conquering all remedies: Levit.
10.1. They offered strange fire before the Lord. V. 2. And there went out fire

of God; nor did it consume the sacrifice so much, as Illorum temeritas ira

So that indeed we cannot hope, that those whom the Lord has not sent by his
authority (which has been committed to, and derived always by the hands of the
Governors and Pastors of his Church) either can, or will take care to guide, or
keep us and our children, in that true, Romans 12.2. (...).
holy, and good way of reasonable and acceptable serving God; since themselves
are (for the most part) such unreasonable persons; of so silly, blind, weak,
wandering, vain, and various spirits; abounding in nothing so much, as in their
ignorance, pride, confidence of themselves, and contempt of others: And what
they pretend to do, as to any holy Ministrations, is not, as of any duty,

novelty and curiosity, when, where, what, how, and as far, as their own sudden
fits, humors, and interests; or others flatteries and vulgar applauses move
them; while the novelty, curiosity, and admiration of these men's boldness, more

works upon the itching ears, not the humble hearts of their gaping, or giddy
hearers.

Such Ivy and Country Garlands, as these men hang out in their private Cells
and Conventicles; or in their more Public Fairs and Taverns; are no
temptations to us, to think their unseasoned new bottles; or their flatuous and
unrefined Wines, (which have fumed so much into their own, and their auditors
weak heads, that many of them every where reel and stagger, and vomit out their
own shame, and wallow in their filthiness, like drunken men) are any way
comparable to our old bottels, Matthew. 9.17. Vetus vinum mulso long

Nor will these new patches of gifted, but unordained Preachers, ever be
suitable with, or comparable to our good old Garments Matthew. 9.16. Ecclesiae

and ^urpiter lacerando magis deformant novatores. Prideaux.
, the learned, ordained, and true Ministers, either for durableness, comeliness,
or comfort; being heavier in the Summer of prosperity, and colder in the Winter
of adversity. So that they are rather a shame, an oppression, and deformity to
us, to our reformed Christian Religion, and to our Church, and Nation; as if we
had chose, rather to be clothed with a ridiculous pybald fools-coat, or a
beggars cloak, checquered with infinite rents and patches, than with that holy
and comely Garment of order and unity which Christ left to his Church and
Ministers (like his own) without any rent or seam: That is, An uniform,
complete, constant way, John 19.23. Qualis Christi vestis inconsu^ilis,
inconsissa, talis esse debet ecclesiae constant ord^ and politia uniformis.
August.
and order of holy Ministerial power, derived in a right and successive
Ordination: These new short jumps of unordained Teachers, are to the Churches
and Religion's proportions, like the coats of David's Messengers, 2 Samuel 10.4.
when they had been shamefully and spightfully treated by ungrateful Hanun;
exposing indeed our Nation, and our Religion, to all Quantum deest autoritati,

reproach and scorn; when all round about us shall see such feeble and uncomly
parts, as indeed these gifted men, for the most part, are, in the body of our
Church, thus discovered, which were far better concealed and hidden.

Yea, 24. Boldness of unordeined Teachers. Number. 22.28.
although they may (with truth) in somethings justly tax and reprove, some
failings, or faults in some, yea, all our Ministers; yet we do not think
presently they are to intrude into their places, and Ministry; no more than
Balaam's Ass might presume to become, presently, a Prophet; because it
sometimes spoke and reproved its masters madness. 2 Pet. 2.16.
Nor do we see any reason, that men should wait upon the lips of such animals
for Instruction, who cannot justify their speaking without a miracle; no more
indeed, than these new Teachers can their chalenging the public place, and
constant office of Christ's Ministers, to which they have no ordinary Call or
Mission.

Indeed we have rather cause, greatly to suspect these intruders, as for many
other things, so for their boldness and forwardness: Since, such as have been
ablest for that great service, So Moses, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel.
have always been St. Jerome tells of Neposianus: Eo dignior quo se clamabat
indignum, fugiebat, dum populus quarebat; Humilitate saperabat invidiam. Ep. ad
Heliod. So Socrates of Ammenius, when he was sought to be made a Pastor of the
Church. Lib. 6. c. 30.
modestly slow, and humbly reserved: That these men's undesired promptitude is
like that malicious readiness of Satan, who, uncalled, presents himself among
the sons of God Job 1.6. and 2.1. 2 Cor. 11.13.
; so are the ministers of Satan most prone to transform themselves by their
hypocrisies, into angels of light; in order to advance hellish darkness, and
damnable doctrines. And the times are much injured by reports, if it be not in
some degree true, That many of these Mushroom Ministers, the most forward
Teachers of this new race and mechanic extraction, are such persons in
disguises of vulgar plainness, Nunquam periculosi es fallit t^neb^arum and
mendaciorum pater, quam cum sub lucis and veritatis specit delitescit. Jeron.
and simplicity, who have had both their learning and their errand from the
vigilant Seminaries beyond Sea: Out of which Galliles can come little good to
our Reformed Church and Nation. Satan is not less a Devil, when he will seem a
Doctor; nor more a dangerous tempter, than when he would appear a zealous
teacher. Whence soever they are, sure we are, That many of these, who are so
suddenly started up into Pulpits, are not ashamed to vent by word and writings,
such transcendent blasphemies; That they teach whatever they think or say, of
the Majesty of God, of Christ, of the holy Spirit, of the Divine Nature, though
never so irreverent, profane, and ridiculous; yet it is no blasphemy, but
sublimity; So Irenaeus, l. 1. Tertul. de prae. ad Hae. Austin. de haer. and de
unitate Eccles. c. 16. Tells us of the Partantil^quia Haeraticorum. Vid. p. 204.
no profaneness, but getting above, and out of all fornis; Whatever they
contradict of the clear literal sense, and rational scope of the Scriptures,
though it seem, and be never so gross a lie and error, in the common
significancy of the words, yet it is a truth in the spirit; Whatever they act,
never so disorderly, brutish, horrid, obscene and abominable, yet it is no sin,
but a liberty, which God, and Christ, and the Spirit exercise in them, who
cannot sin.

Nor is this the least cause we have to suspect, beware of, and abhor these new
Modellers and Levellers of the Ministry; That, how different soever their faces
and factions are, one from another, (though they go one East, and the other
West; whether they separate, or rank, or seek, or shake,) yet still they meet
in this one point, No Ordination, no Function, or peculiar Calling of the
Ministry: The Serpents tail meets with his head, that he may surround truth
with a circle of malice; In hoc uniformes esse solent errantium deformitates,
quod recte sentientes odi^ habent. August.
As Herod and Pilate, they agree to crucify Christ; as Samsons Foxes, though
their wily-heads look several ways, yet their filthy tails carry common
firebrarnds; not only to set on fire the sometime well-fill'd and fruitful
Field of this Church; but also to consume the very laborers and husbandmen.
Their eyes and hands are generally bent against the best and ablest Ministers;
and their spirits most bitterly inconsistent, with that holy Ministry, which
Christ once delivered, by the Apostles, to the Church; and which, by the
fidelity of his Church, has been derived to us; of which, we and all the true
Churches of Christ, have in all ages had so great, and good experience; which
no malice of devils, or personal infirmities of men, have been hitherto able so
to hinder, as wholly to interrupt; much less so to corrupt it, that it should
be, either just, or any way necessary to abolish it, according to those
tragical clamors, and tyrannick purposes of some unworthy men; whose malice and
cruelty, Esther 5.9.
(as our modern Hamans) does hope, and daily with eagerness expect, when the
whole Function and Calling (which is from God, though by man) of the ordained
and authoritative Ministry (which has succeeded the Apostles to our days)
shall be trussed up that fifty footed Gallows, which malicious and ungrateful
envy, or sacrilegious covetousness, or vulgar ambition, or Jesuitick policies,
has erected for the whole Nation of the ancient and true Ministers; And all
this, because (like Mordecai) they will not; nor in any Reason, Law, and
Religion, can bow down, or pay any respect (such as the pride and vanity of
some men expect) to those high and self-exalting gifts; whereto their
Antiministerial adversaries pretend; and which they seek to cry up in their
meetings and scriblings; with which they say, (and only say) They are divinely
called, and more immediately inspired, not only above their fellows and
brethren (who are still modestly exercised in their first mechanic
occupations) but even above those, that are much their betters, every way; and,
who merit to have been, (and possibly have been to many of them) as Fathers in
Religion; by whose pains and care, with Gods blessing, the true Christian
Religion in all ages has been planted, propagated, and preserved, or (where
need was) reformed, and restored to its essential luster and primitive dignity.

So that the cruel contrivances and desperate agitations, 25. Sober man's
greatest sense. Revel. 12.4.
carried on by some men against the true Ministers and Ministry in this Church,
(like the looks of the great red Dragon, upon the Woman of the Revelation) have
a most dire and dreadful aspect; not only upon all good learning and civility,
but also upon all true Religion, both as Christian, and as Reformed. Threatening
at once to devour the very life, soul, beauty, honor, ^oy, and blessing of this
Nation; on which we may well write Ickabob, 1 Samuel 4.21.
the glory is departed from our Israel; so soon as the fury of these men has
broke the hearts and necks of our Elies, the Evangelical Priests of the Lord,
the true Ministers of Christ, who are as the chariots and horsemen of our Israel.

Civil changes and secular oppressions have their limits, confined within the
bounds of things mortal and momentary, with which, awise and well settled
Christian is neither much pleased nor displeased, Quadratus cum sit vir bonus
ad omnem fortuna jactum aquabilis est and sibi constans. Sen. Tanto satius est
esse Christianum quam hominem, quanto praestat non omnino esse hominem quam non
and esse Christianum. Bern.
because not much concerned, nor long: (For no wind from the four corners of
the Earth, can blow so cross to a good man's sails, but he knows how to steer a
steady course to Heaven, according to the compass of a good Conscience.) But
what relates to our souls eternal welfare, to the inestimable blessing of
present times and posterity; What more concerns us in point of being true
Christians, (that is rightly instructed, duly baptized, and confirmed in an
holy way) than any thing of riches, peace, honor, liberty, or the very being
men can do; (for without being true Christians, it had been good for us, we had
never been men;) what evidently portends, and loudly proclaims Darkness, Error,
Atheism, Barbarity, Profaneness, or all kind of Antichristian tyrannies and
superstitions, to come upon us and our children; instead of that saving truth,
sweet order, and blessed peace; instead of those unspeakable comforts, and holy
privileges, which we formerly enjoyed, from the excellency of the true
knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ, declared to us by the labors of our true
and faithful Ministers: We hope it can offend no good Christians to see us,
more piously passionate, Sancta and laudabilis est in religionis nego^io
impatientia. Jeron. Judges 18.24.
and more commendably impatient against those who seek to deprive us of all
those divine blessings, than Micah was against those, who stole away his gods,
and his Priests; in as much as our true God, and true Savior, and true
Ministers, infinitely exceed his Teraphins, his Ephod, his Vagrant, and
idolatrous Levite, who yet was as a father to him: Who can wonder! if we, or
any other, who have any bowels of true Christians, or tenderness of Conscience
for our Reformed Religion, 1 Kings 3.26. Viscera genuinam matiem indicant: Ex
vero dolor verus amor dignoscitur. Fictitius and ^^er etricius animus facile
patitur infantem dividi. Greg. Jude 1. 2 Cor. 4.7.
do (as the true Mother did) passionately yern within themselves, and earnestly
cry to others, lest by the seeming liberty of every ones exercising his gifts,
in Preaching and Prophesying, their eyes should behold the true and living
child of Religion reformed, cruelly murdered and destroyed, under pretense of
equable dividing it; to gratify thereby the cunning designs of an impudent and
cruel Harlot. It is the least, that we as true Protestants in this Church of
England can do, earnestly by prayers to contend with God and man, for the faith
once delivered to the Saints; that we may neither craftily be cheated, nor
violently robbed, of that only heavenly treasure of our souls; nor of those
earthen vessels, which the Lord has chosen and appointed, both to preserve it,
and dispense it to us; namely, the truly ordained and authoritative Ministers;
the original of whose office and power, as of all Evangelical Institutions, is
from our Lord Jesus Christ, and not from the will of man, in any wanton,
arbitrary, and irreligious way.

26. Who are the Antiministerial adversaries most, and why.
Thus then may your Virtuous Excellencies easily perceive, That it is not as
mine, or my Brethren, the Ministers, private sense alone, but it is as the
public echo of that united voice, which with sad complaint and doleful sound,
is ready to come from all the holy hills of Zion; from every corner of the City
of God in our Land; through the prayers and tears, sighs and groans, of those
many thousands judicious and gracious Christians, who are as the remnant that
yet has escaped, the blaspemies, extravagancies, seductions, pollutions, and
confusions of the present world; occasioned by those, who neither fearing God,
nor reverencing man, seem to have set up the design and trade of mocking both.
^uci nimi^um adversantur m^rito, qui teneb^arum opera operantur. Aug.
None bear the true Ministry with less patience than they, whose deeds will
least endure the touchstone of Gods Word: Whose violent projects against this
Church and State, (being wholly inconsistent with any rules of righteousness
and godliness) makes them most impatient to be any way censured, crossed, or
restrained, by those precepts and paterns of justice and holiness, which the
true Ministers still hold forth out of Gods Word, to their great reproach and
regret; no more able to bear that freedom of truth, than the old world could
bear Noah's, or Sodom Lots preaching of righteousness. To these men's assistance
comes in (by way of clamoring or petitioning, or writing scandalously against
the Ministers, and Ministry of this Church) all those sorts of men, whose
licentious indifferency, profane ignorance, and Atheistical malice, has yet
never tasted, and so never valued the blessings of the learned labors and holy
lives of good Ministers; both these sorts are further seconded by that sordid
and self-deceiving covetousness, which is in the earthy and illiberal hearts of
many seeming Protestants; who either ingratefully grudg to impart any of their
temporal good things to those of whose spirituals they partake; Romans 15.27. 1
Cor. 9.11.
or else they are always sacrilegiously gaping to devour those remains of Bread
and water, which are yet left, as a constant maintenance to sustain the
Prophets of the Lord in the Land.

And lastly, not the least evil influence falls upon the Ministers and Ministry
of this Reformed Church, by the cunning activity of those pragmatick Papists,
and Jesuitical Politicians, (for all of the Roman Profession are not such) who
make all possible advantages of our civil troubles, and study to fit us for
their sumation, and a recovery to their party, by helping thus to cast us into
a Chaos, and ruinous heaps, as to any settled Order and Religion: The most
effectual way to which, they know is, To raise up rivals against, to bring
vulgar scorn and factious contempt upon, to foment any scandalous petitions
against Ministers, and the whole support of the Ministry, that so they may
deprive that function, of all the constant maintenance, and those immunities,
which it has so long and peaceably enjoined, by the Laws, (which are, or ought
to be, as the results of free and public consent, so the great preservers of
all estales in this Land.) Thus by starving, they doubt not, speedily to
destroy the holy function, divine authority, and due succession of all true
reformed Ministry in England; Solicitously inducing all such deformities, as
are most destitute of all sober and true grounds, either of Law, Reason,
Scripture, or Catholic practice in the Church of Christ; Thus shortly hoping,
that from our Quails and Manna of the Learned and Reformed Ministry, and true
Christian Religion, we may be brought back again to the Garlic and Onyons of
Egypt, to praying to Saints, to worshipping of God, in, or by, or through
Images, to such implicit Faith and Devotion, to trust in Indulgences, to the
use of burdened, or maimed Sacraments, to those Papal Errors, Superstitions,
and Usurpations, which neither we, nor our Forefathers, of later ages have
tasted of; which, however somewhat better dressed and cooked (now) than they
were in grosser times; yet still they are thought (and most justly) both
unsavory and unwholesome, to those serious and sounder Christians, who have more
accurate palates, and more reformed stomachs: Si canonicarum Scripturarum
autoritate quidquam firmatur, sine ulla dubitatione credendum est: Aliis vero
testibus tibi credere vel non credere liceat. August. ep. c. 12. Hoc prius
credimus, non esse ultra Scripturas quod credere debeamus. Tertul. de prae. ad
Hae. l. 3. Sacris Scripturis non loquentibus quid loquetur? Ambr. voc. Genesis l.
2.
With whose judgments and consciences, nothing will relish, or down, as to
doctrine, and rule of Faith, or Sacramental Administrations, and duties in
Religion, which has not Scripture for its ground; to which, no doubt, the
primitive and purest Antiquity did consent: To whose holy rule and pattern, this
Church of England in its restitution or reformation of Religion, did most
exactly, and with greatest deliberation, seek to conform both its Ministry and
holy Ministrations, using liberties or latitudes of prudence, order, and
decency, no further, than it thought might best tend to the edification and
well-governing of the Church, 1 Cor. 14.40. Wherein it had (as all particular
National Churches have) an allowance from God, both in Scripture, and in Reason.

27. Things of Religion ought first and most to be considered by Christian
Rulers.
But, as if nothing had been reformed and settled with any wisdom, judgment,
piety, or conscience in this Church, nor hitherto so carried on by any of the
true and ordained Ministers of it; infinite calumnies, injuries, and
indignities, are daily cast upon the whole Church, and the best Ministers of
it: The cry whereof (no doubt) as it has filled the Land, so, it has reached
up to Heaven, and is come up to the ears of the most high God.

And therefore, I hope, it will not seem rude, unseasonable, or importune to
any excellent persons of what piety or power soever, if it now presses into
their presence; who ought to remember, that they are but as Bees in the same
Hive; as Ants on the same Molehill; and as Worms in the same clods of Earth,
with other poor inferior Christians, whom they have far surmounted in civil and
secular respects. The swarms and crowds of worldly counsels and designs, we
hope, have not (as they ought not) overlaid or smothered all thoughts, care,
and conscience of preserving, restoring, and establishing, truth, good order,
and peace, in matters of Religion: Which are never by those public persons,
who pretend to any thing of true Christianity, to be so far despised and
neglected, that those above all other matters of public concernment, should be
left, like scattered sheaves, to the wastings and tramplings upon by the feet
of the Beasts of the people; Merito a Deo negliguntur quires Dei secularibus
post ponunt negotiis. Cypr. (...). Primum quod sanctum. Plat. Matthew. 6.31. Hag.
1.4. Is it time for you to dwell in your ceiled houses, and this house lie

Arat. Phainom.
ungathered and unbound by any civil sanction and power, agreeable to holy
order, divine method, Christian charity and prudence. Possibly it had fared
better with all estates in this Church and State, if they had learned and
followed, that divine direction, and grand principle in Christian politics,
First seek the Kingdom of Heaven, and the righteousness thereof, and all these
things shall be added to you: The neglect of Gods house, (the Church) and its
beauty, holy order, and ministry, has been a great cause of overthrowing so
many seiled houses, which were covered with Cedar, and decked with Vermilion
and Gold.

Certainly no men employed in public power or counsel, have any business of so
great concernment, or of so urging and crying necessity as this, The
preservation of the true Evangelical Ministry, in its due power and authority;
Upon which, without any dispute among sober and truly-wise men, the very life,
being, weight, honor, and succession of our Religion does depend, both as
Christian, and as reformed: For it is not to be expected, that the ignorant
prating, and confident boasting of any other volunteers, will ever soberly
adorn, or solidly maintain our Religion, which has so many very eloquent,
learned, and subtle enemies, besides the rude and profaner rabble, besieging
it; both learned and unlearned oppose true Religion, as the right and left hand
of the Devil; the one out of ignorance, the other out of crookedness; the one
as dark, the other as depraved; the one cannot endure its light, nor the other
its straitness. Against neither of them can these afford help, Anserum clangere
crepituque alarm excitus Manlius capitolium propugnat, Gallos deturbat, etc.
Livi. Dec. 1. l. 5.
any more than the confused cackling of a company of Geese, could have defended
the Roman Capitol: Which noise is indeed, but an alarm to sober and good
Protestants, intimating the approach or assault of enemies; and should excite
the vigilance and valor of all worthy Magistrates, conscientious Soldiers, and
wise Christians of this Reformed Church, to resist the invading danger; as by
other fit means, so chiefly by establishing and encouraging a succession of
learned, godly, and faithful Ministers.

Nor in any reason of State, or of Conscience, should those who exercise
Magistratick power in this Church and State, so far neglect him, who is Higher
then the highest Eccles. 5.8. He that is higher than the highest, regards;
and there be higher than they. John 19.11 Thou could have no power, except it
were given thee from above. Christ to Pilat 1 Cor. 12.1. 1 Pet. 4.10. Stewards
of the manifold grace of God. Luke 1.16.
; by whom all power is dispensed; or so far gratify the irreligious rudeness,
the boisterous ignorance, and violent profaneness of any, (who are but Gods
executioners, the instruments of his wrath, and ministers of his vengeance;) as
for their sakes, and at their importunity, to despise and oppress those who are
by Christ and his Church appointed to be Ministers of Gods grace, and conveyers
of his mercy to men: The meanest of whom, (that do indeed come in his name) the
proudest mortal may not safely injure or despise; because not without sin and
reproach to Christ and God himself. For he that hears you, hears me; and he
that despises you, despises me, and him that sent me; is signally and
distinctly spoken in favor to true Ministers, and for terror to those that are
prone to offer insolency to their worldly weakness, and meanness. Such as
despise and oppose the Ministers of Christ, are more rebellious than the devils
were; for of these, the seventy returning testify, Luke 10.17. Lord, even the
devils are subject to us in thy Name.

If then we have immortal souls (which some mockers now question,) sure they
are infinitely to be preferred before our carkases; and the instruments which
God has appointed, 1 Cor. 1.21. It pleased God by the foolishness of
preaching, to save them that believe.
as means to save them, are proportionably to be esteemed beyond any, that are
often the destroyers, at best, but the preservers of men's bodies, and outward
estates.

Who can dissemble, or deny, That the banks of equity, piety, modesty, and
charity, yea, of common humanity, are already by some men much demolished,
through the pride, presumption, insolence, scurrility, and profaneness of some
spirits, who are set against the Reformed Religion, the Ministers and Ministry
of this Church? Who sees with honest and impartial eyes, and deplores not, to
behold; how the deluge of Ignorance, Atheism, Profaneness, and Sottishness;
also of damnable Errors, devilish Doctrines, and Popish Superstitions; together
with Schismatical fury, and turbulent Factions, are much prevailed (of later
years) both in Cities and Countries here in England: And this, Gaudet in malis
nostris diabolus, latatur in miseriis, dilatatur augustiis, delectatur
angoribus, triumphat ruinis. Bern.
since men of Antiministerial tempers, have studied to act the Devils Comedy,
and this Churches Tragedy; endeavoring to render, not only the able, godly,
and painful Ministers, but the whole Ministry it self, and all holy
Ministrations (rightly performed by its Authority) despised, invalid, decryed,
and discountenanced: In many places affronting some, vexing and oppressing
others, menacing all every where, with total extirpations: For, they who
pretend to have any man a Minister that lists, intend to have none, such as
should be; (As they that would have every man a Master or Magistrate, mean to
have none, in a Family or State;) but only, by specious shadows of New
Teachers and Prophets, they hope to deprive us of those substances, both of
true reformed Religion, and the true Ministry; which we and our Forefathers
have so long happily enjoyed, and which we ow to our posterity.

28. The great and urgent causes of complaint.
Nor is this a feigned calumny, or fictitious grief, and outcry: Your piety (O
excellent Christians) knows, That the spirits of too many men, are so
desperately bent upon this design against the Function of the Ministry; that
they not only breathe out threatenings against all of this way (the duly
ordained Ministers;) but daily do (as much as in them lies) make havoc of
them; and in them, of all good manners and reformed Religion; while so many
people, and whole Parishes are void and desolate of any true Minister, residing
among them: I leave it to the judgments and consciences of all good Christians
to consider, how acceptable such projects and practices will be to any sober
and moralized professor; to any gracious and true Christian; to any reformed
Church, or to Christ, (the Institutor of an authoritative and successional
Ministry) or, last of all, to God, whose mercy has eminently blessed this
Church and Nation, in this particular, of able and excellent Ministers; so that
they have not been behind any Church under Heaven; That so exploded Speech
then, Stupor mundi clerus Anglicanus, The Ministers of England were the
admiration of the Reformed World, had no^ more in it of crack and boasting,
than of sober Truth, if rightly considered; only it had better become
(perhaps) any man's mouth, than a Ministers of this Church, to have said it; and
any others, than believers of this Church, to have contradicted and slighted
it: Since to the English Ministers eminency, in all kind, so many foreign
Churches, and Learned Men, have willingly subscribed; as to Preaching, Praying,
Writing, Disputing, and Living.

On the other side, How welcome the disgrace of the Ministry will be to all the
enemies of Gods truth, of the Reformed Religion, and of all good order in this
Church and State, it is easy to judge, by the great contentment, the ample
flatterings, the unfeigned gloryings, the large and serious triumphings, which
all those that were heretofore professed enemies to this Church and our
Reformed Religion, (either such as are factious and politic Factors for
another Supremacy and Power; or such as carry deep brands of Schism and Heresy
on their foreheads; or such as are professedly Atheists, profane, idle, and
dissolute minds) discover, in this, That, they hope, they shall not be any
more tormented by the prophesying of these witnesses, Revel. 11.10. They that
dwell on the earth, shall rejoice (over the dead, and unburied bodies of the
witnesses) and make merry, because these two Prophets tormented them that dwelt
on the earth.
the true and faithful Ministers of the Church of England; Than whom, none of
that order, in any of the late Reformed Churches, and scarce any of the
Ancients, have given more ample, clear, and constant testimony, to the glory of
God, and the truth and purity of the Gospel, by their Writing, Preaching,
Praying, Sufferings, and holy Examples, Living, and Dying; which I again
repeat, and justify against those, who swell with disdain, and are ready to
burst with envy, against the real worth, and undeniable excellency of the
Ministers of the Church of England.

All which makes me presume, That you (O excellent Christians) can neither be
ignorant, nor unsatisfied in this point of the Evangelical Ministry, both as to
this, and all other Churches use, benefit, and necessity; as also, to the
divine right of it, by Christ's institution, the Apostles derivation, and the
Catholic Churches observation, in all times and places; as to the main
substance of the duties, the power, and authority of the Function; however,
there may be in the succession of so many ages, some Variation, in some
Circumstantials: The peculiar office, and special power, were seldom, (as I
have said) if ever questioned, among any Christians, until of late; much less,
so shaken, vilified, and traduced, as now it is by the ungrateful wantonness,
and profane unworthiness of some; who, not by force of reason, or arguments of
truth, but by forcible sophistries, armed cavilings, violent calumnies, and
arrogant intrusions, have (like so many wild Bores) sought to lay waste the
Lords Vineyard; Pretending, That their brutish confidence is beyond the best
dressers skill; Psalm. 80.30. The Boar out of the wood does waste it, and the
wild Beast of the field does devour it. Et atroces insidiatores, and aperti
grassatores, Ecclesiam divastare contendunt, tam mart quam art. Aug. Matthew.
9.38. Pray ye the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth laborers into
his harvest. Matthew. 8.32. The whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep
place into the Sea, and perished in the waters. Immundi illi Minist^i, and

blasphemiarum, and confusionum omnium abyssum. Chemnit.
that their irregular rootings are better than the carefullest diggings; that
their rude croppings and tearings are beyond any orderly prunings, or wary
weedings; that their sordid wallowings, and filthy confusions, are before any
seasonable manurings; that there needs no skilful Husbandmen, or faithful
Laborers of the Lords sending, the Churches ordaining, or the faithful peoples
approving; where so many devout swine, and holy hogs, will take care to plant,
water, dress, and propagate the Vine of the true Christian Reformed Religion;
to which, the hearts of men are naturally no propitious soil. Nor is the event,
as to the happiness of this Church, and its Reformed Religion, to be expected
other (without a miracle,) (if once those unordeined, unclean, and untried
spirits, be suffered to possess the Pulpits, and places of true and able
Minishers) than such, as befell those forenamed cattle, when once Christ
permitted the devils to enter into them: All truth, order, piety, peace, and
purity of Religion, together with the Function of the Ministry, will be
violently carried into, and choked in the midst of the Sea, of most
tempestuous errors, and bottomless confusions.

29. Absurdities
The impious absurdities, enormious bablings, and endless janglings, whereby
some men endeavor to dishonor, and destroy the whole Function of the reformed
and established Ministry in this Church; and to surrogate in their places,

volunteers, 1 King. 13.33. Jeroboam made of the lowest of the people, Priests;

(whosoever lists, not to consecrate, but desecrate himself, by an execrable
boldness; or else is elected and misordained by that zealous simplicity,
schismatical fury, and popular madness after any novelty, which is ever, in any
meaner sort of people.) These no doubt are sufficiently known to you, together
with those learned solutions, those sober, and to wise men, satisfactory
answers, which have by many worthy Pens, both long since, and lately been made
public, both as to the calumnies of the adversaries, and the vindication of
this Church, and its Ministry; Which is conform, not only to our wise,
excellent, and ancient Laws; but to all right reason; common rules of order and
policy; dictates of humane nature; practice of all Nations: Also, to the
Precepts, Institutions, Paterns, and Customs of God, of Christ, of the
Apostles, and of all the Churches; and ever was so esteemed and reverenced,
until the sour and unsavory dregs of these perilous, last, 2 Timothy 3.1.
and worst times, came to be stirred and drawn forth: Wherein, under pretenses
of (I know not what) special calling, gifts, and privileges, (but really to
advance other fruits, than those that use to grow from the Spirit of truth,
peace, holiness, and order,) some men are resolved to ascend to that desperate
height of impiety, which counts nothing a sin, a shame, or a confusion.

I shall not so far distrust the knowledge, memory, or consciences, 30.
Ministers unheard, ought not to be condemned. Quod rationibus non possunt

of wise and worthy Christians; as to abuse their leisure, by a large, exact,
and punctual disputing every one of those Particulars, Arguments, and
Scriptures, which have been well and learnedly handled by others; who have put
the heady rabble of their opponents, to so great disorders; as from Arguments,
to threaten Arms; from shows of Reason, to fly to Passion; from sober
Speaking, to bitter Railings, Scoffings, and Barkings at that Light, which they
see is so much above them.

Only I cannot but suggest in general, to all good men, That it seems, not to
me only, but to many, much wiser and better than my self, a very strange
precipitancy, which no Christian wise Magistrates will permit, (more like
tumultuary rashness, and schismatical violence, than either Christian zeal, or
charitable calmness) That the whole Order and Function of the Ministry of the
Gospel in this Reformed Church, so long owned by all good men, both at home and
abroad; so long, and largely prospered here with the effects and seals of Gods
grace upon it; so esteemed necessary to the very Being of any Church, and
Christianity it self, by all sober and serious Christians; (For, there can be
no true Church, where Christ is not; who promised to be with his Ministers to
the end of the World: So, that where no true Ministry is, there can be no
presence of Christ, as to outward Ordinances, Matthew. 28.20. which is spoken to
those that were sent to Teach and Baptize, etc.) Lastly, This Calling so never
opposed by any, but erroneous, seditious, licentious, or fanatic spirits of
later times; That (I say) this ancient, and holy Function, should without any
solemn public conference, impartial hearing, or fair consultation, even among
Professors of Reformed Christianity, be at noon day, thus vilified, routed, and
sought to be wholly outed; by persons, whose weavers beams, or rustic numbers,
and clamorous crowds; not their reason, learning, piety, or virtue, renders
them, either formidable, or any way considerable; further, than to be objects
of wiser, and better men's, pity, and charity, or fears, and restraints.

Is it that there are no Ministers of the true and good old way, worthy to be
heard, or comparable to those plebeian pieces, who by a most imprudent
apostasy, Et osores and desertores sui ordinis. Sulp. Sev.
becoming haters and desertors of their former holy orders, and authority
Ministerial, have taken a new Commission upon a popular account? Are none of
the ancient Ministers fit to be advised with, or credited in this matter, which
concerns not themselves so much, as the public good, both of Church and State?
Are they all such friends to their own private interests (some poor living, it
may be) as to have no love to God, to Christ, to the Truth, or to the Souls of
men? Have they no learning, judgment, modesty, or conscience, comparable to
those, who being parties, and enemies against them, hope to be their only
judges, and to condemn them? Is wisdom wholly perished from the wise, and
understanding hidden from the prudent? Is Religion lost among the Learned; and
only now found among simple idiots? Or rather, are not the Antiministerial
adversaries, so conscious to the true Ministers learned piety, and their own
impudent ignorance, that they are loath, and ashamed to bring the one or other,
to a public test and fair trial; resolving with the Circumcellions with more
ease to drive them, Circumcelliones inter Donatistas furiostores, cum (...), i.
e. Continentes se vocitabant, jus fasque omne evertenies sacerdotibus and
Ministris Catholicis vim inserebant, omnia ditipientes, etc. Calcem cum aceto
in oculos piorum ingerebant. Vil. August. c. 9. 1 King. 18.21.
than to dispute them out of the Church; aiming not to satisfy any by their
reason, but to sacrifice all to their passion, if they can get power? Who
doubts, but that if the learned and godly Ministers in this sometime so famous
and flourishing Church of England, who seem now in the eyes of their enemies,
(as if they had been taken by Pirates or Picarooms) only fit to be so thrust
under Hatches; not worthy to be spoken with, to appear, to be trusted or
regarded, if they might have so much public favor, (which they despair not of,
and do humbly entreat) as by solemn trial and dispute, to assert their Station
and Function, against their adversaries, (as some have in private ways done,)
Who doubts, (I say) but by Gods assistance, (whose mercy has not, will not,
ever forsake them) they would make the halting and ungrateful people of this
Church, to see, whether the Lord or Baal be God? Whether (I say) the Primitive
Order, and Divine Constitutions of Christ; (which have on them, the Seal of the
Scripture, the Stamp of Authority, and carry with them all the beauties of
holiness: For right reason, due order, decency, peaceableness, and
proportionableness, to the great ends of Christian Religion; together with
their real usefulness, confirmed by the happy experience of the Primitive
times, the purest Saints, the best Christians, the constantest Confessors, holy
Martys, and most flourishing Churches;) Whether (I say) these should continue
in their place and power, wherein God has set them, and out pious Predecessors
have maintained them in this Church and Nation; or these yesterday-novelties,
the politic whimseys, and Jesuitick inventions of some heady, but
heartless-men, should usurp and prevail in this Church, after sixteen hundred
years prescription against them; and which are already found to have in them
(besides their novelty,) such emptiness, flatness, vanity, disorder, deformity,
and unproportionableness to the great end of right ordering Christian
societies, of saving of souls, by edifying them in truth and love; Ephesians. 4.10,
11, 12, 13.
that they have been already productive of such dreadful effects, both in
opinions and practices, Mirabutur and ingemuit. ^^h^ se tam cito fieri Arianum.
Jeron. cont. Lucif. John 14.16. The Comforter, even the Spirit of Truth, he
shall ab^de with you for ever.
that they make the Protestant and Reformed Churches stand amassed, to see any
of their kind bring forth such Monsters of Religion, as seem rather the fruit
of some Incubus, some soul and filthy spirits, deluding and oppressing this
Reformed Church, than of that blessed and promised Spirit, whose power, whose
rule, whose servants, have always been the most exactly and constantly, holy,
^ust, and pure. For any true Christians then, to allow and foster such
prodigies of Protestant Religion, as some are bringing forth, seems no less
preposterous, than if men should resolve, to put out their eyes, and to walk
both blindfold and backwards; or to renverse the body by setting the feet above
the head: Indeed it is putting the Reformed Religion to the Strapado, and
crucifying Christ again, as they did Saint Peter, after a new posture, with his
head downwards; As if in kindness to any men, they should take away their
souls, and make them move (like Puppets) by some little springs, wyars, and
gimmers; or by the Sorcery of some Demoniack possession.

For want of the favor of such a public trial and vindication of the Ministry,
31. Therefore this Apology endeavors the Ministers defense. Genesis 41.14. Zach.
3.4.
I have adventured to present to the view of all Excellent Christians in this
Church, this Apology; By which I have endeavored to take off from the Joseph's
and Josedecks of this Church, those prisons and filthy garments, wherewith some
men have sought to deform them; and to wash off from their grave countenances,
and angelike aspects, the chiefest of those scandals and aspersions, under
which (for want of solid reasons, or just imputations against their persons and
calling) by some men's unwashen hands, and foul mouths (whose restless spirits
cast out nothing but dirt and mire against them) they are now so much
disfigured to the world; Isai. 57. The wicked is as a troubled sea, when it
cannot rest; whose waters cast up mire and dirt. Tertul. Apolog. 2 Cor. 10.10.
His bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible; so the false
apostles, the ministers of Satan, 2 Cor. 11.13. The deceitful workers
reproached St. Paul behind his back.
That so, odious disguises (as of old to the Christians) may render them less
regarded, and more abhorred by vulgar people: This art of evil tongues, and
pens, serving to color, excuse, or justify the injustice, cruelty, barbarity,
unthankfulness, and irreligion of those; who seek first to bait them in the
Theater by all public disgracings, and then to dispatch them. Very criminis
defectus falsis supplet calumniis; and factis innocents, verbis deturpat

marum deceptorem clamitabant; and ut lupum occidendum; and tale facinus
perpetra^i remistionem peccatorum obventurum. Possid. vit. August.
For against these Beasts (as Saint Paul sometime at Ephesus) whom no reason,
learning, gravity, merit, parts, graces, or age does tame or mitigate, the true
Ministers of the Gospel, even in this Reformed Church of England, have now to
contend, for their Calling, Liberties, and Livelihood; yea, for their lives
too, if the Lord, by the favor and justice of those that have wisdom, courage,
and piety, answerable to their places and power, do not rescue and protect them.

32. What Ministers I plead for. 2 Cor. 2.17. Not as many which corrupt the
Word of God. 2 Cor. 11.13. Tit. 3.10. Nihil deformius est sacerdote
claudicante; qui non aequis and rectis pedibus incedit in viis Domini. Greg.

If in any thing, as weak and sinful men, any of the true Ministers of this
Church, are (indeed) liable to just reproaches, either of ignorance, or
idleness, factiousness, sedition, any immorality, or scandalous living, (and
what Church of Christ can hope to be absolutely clear, when even in Christ's
family, and the Apostles times, there was dross and chaff in the floor, by
Judas, and Demas, Simon Magus, false Apostles, deceitful workers, Ministers of
Satan, etc?) I am so far from excusing, or pleading for them (as to their
personal errors and disorders) that I should be a most severe advocate against
them, (if after two or three admonitions, they should be found incorrigible.)

And this, upon the same ground, on which now I write this Apology; namely, in
behalf of the honor of the Gospel, the dignity of the true Ministry, and the
glory of the most sacred name of the Christians God, and Savior; which, idle,
evil, unable, and unfaithful Bishops, and Ministers, beyond all men, cause to
be blasphemed; when they pull down more with the left hand of profaneness, than
they build with the right hand of their preaching; betraying Christ with their
kisses, and smiting the Christian Reformed Religion under the fifth rib, when
they seem with great respect to salute and embrace it. Confuting what they say,
by what they do; and hardening men's hearts to an unbelief of that doctrine,
which they contradict by the Solecism of their lives and manners; either rolling
great stones upon the mouth of the Fountain; or poisoning the emanations of
living waters; or perforating the minds and consciences of their hearers, to
such liberties and hypocrisies, that they retain no more of true Religion, and
serious holiness, than sieves can do of water: As Salvian, lib. 4. Facta and

de Gub. sometimes, complained of Preachers and Professors too in his time.

No, I beseech you to believe, That I am the most rigid exactor of all holy
exactness from Ministers (of all degrees) beyond all other sorts of men; That
they who are the Evangelical Priests to the Lord, should have no blemish from
head to foot, Levit. 21.17, 18, 19. Neither defective in intellectuals, nor
deformed in morals; sound in doctrine, sacred in deeds; the want of which,
makes them, (as Eunuchs, Levit. 21.20.) forbidden to serve before the Lord; as
unfit for spiritual-generation. That they bear on their breasts before God and
all men, the Vrim and Thummim, Light and Perfection, Truth and Charity; in both
Integrity. That none of this holy Ministration, be either incurably blind, or
incorrigibly lame; that they may be worthy to stand before God, as to their
sincerity; before men, as to their unblamableness; and between both, as to
their unfeigned fervent love, both of God and man. For I well know, That not
only gross offenses in them, as in Eli's sons which made people to abhor the
offerings of the Lord, 1 Samuel 1.17. must be avoided; but the very flies of
common frailties, must be kept off from their sacrifices (as Abraham did the
fowls of the air from his oblations, Genesis 15.11.) And as the Jews affirm, That
natural flies were never seen on any sacrifices of the true God, or in his
Temple; which infested all other Temples of the Beelzebuls, gods of flies.
Ministers motes, as well as beams, must be kept out of the worlds eyes; which
are prone to look with a more prying curiosity, and pitiful censoriousness, on
Ministers smaller infirmities, than on other men's grosser enormities: This
being one of our happinesses, That being compassed about with many sinful
frailties, which easily beset us, we have as many savore censurers; which may
help to keep us in a greater exactness, both before God and man: In whose
account, drunkenness and riot, which in all men, is a sin; in Ministers, is as
sacrilege: Rash and vain oaths in them, are as so many perjuries: Any profaner
levity in them, is as the blaspheming that God, whose Word they Preach, whose
Name they invocate, whose holy Mysteries they celebrate: Their illiterateness,
is barbarity and brutishness; their factiousness, and fury in secular motions,
is such a madness of pride, and vainglory, as possessed him, who in all things
else very obscure, set the Tempe at Ephesus on fire; 2 Timothy 1.15. Study to show
thy self a workman, that needs not to be ashamed. Non impudentem vult, ut non
erubescat; sed diligentem ((...)) ut non mereatur verecundari. Amb. 1 Timothy
4.15. (...). Give thy self wholly to these things, that thy profiting may
appear to all men; so 16. (...). Quo longius aberrant, to vehementius
agitantur. August.
that he might be remembered for something their laziness and negligence in
their studies and preaching, is supine slothfulness, and sinful slovenliness;
while they content themselves with any raw and extemporary hudlings; in which,
is nothing of holy reasonings, and Scripture demonstrations, mightily
convincing; nor of right method, duly disposing; nor yet of any grave and
pathetick oratory, sweetly converting, and swasively applying; but only a
rudeness, and rambling next door to raving; which has partly occasioned
(indeed) so many new undertakers to preach; who, thinking some Ministers stocks
of divinity quite broken and spent, by their so little trading and improving in
any good learning, or solid preaching; have adventured to serve the Country
credulity with their Pedlars packs, and small wares; not despairing to preach
and pray, at that sorry rate, and affectated length, which they hear from some
that go for Ministers; resolving (at worst) to color and cover over those real
defects of parts or studies, to which they cannot but be conscious, by
excessive confidences, loud noises, immoderate prolixities, and theatrick shows
of zealous activity; (even as Country Fiddlers are wont to do, when they play
most out of tune,) Abusing the vulgar simplicity, with their bold, yet
unharmonious melody.

What can be more fulsom and intolerable, even to the worst, as well as the
best of Christians, than to see Clergimen study more the gain and pomp, than
the life and power of godliness? To content themselves, and delude others with
the husk and shells of Religion? Sicarii animarum. Naz. or. de Sacerd. (...).
Is. Pel. l. 2. ^osimen. profano Presbytero.
What more unreasonable, than for Shepherds to starve, or tear and worry the
flocks? For Physicians to infect their patients, by not healing themselves? for
Builders to pull down the holy Fabric of Truth and Charity? or to build with
the untempered mortar of Passion, Fancy, and Faction? For Ambassadors, either
through idleness to neglect, or through baseness to corrupt, or through
cowardice not to dare to declare and assert the message, and honor of their
Sovereign sender? which should with all courage, fidelity, and constancy, be
discharged, even to utmost perils; so as to be ready with St. Paul, not only
to be bound for Christ, but to lay down his life also. Acts 20.

Vnicus rectoris lapsus per est totius populi fl^gitio. Chrysostom. Levit. 4.3, 14.
The sacrifice for the sin of the Priest, is as much as for the sin of the whole
Congregation.
I know that in Ministers any spot of pride, levity, affectation, popularity,
pragmaticalness, timorousness, or other undecencies, below a wise, holy, grave,
constant temper, and carriage of a worthy mind, is a foul deformity, a putid
futility, a pueril vanity, scarce a venial madness; so much the worse in them,
by how much the contagion of their folly is prone to infect all that look upon
them; Non solum ipse cum male agit digne perit, sed and alios secum indigne
perdit. Ambr. de Sa. dig.

Praepositorum vitia imitari obsequii genus videtur ne scelera ductoribus ex
probrare viderentur, si pie viverant. Lact. Inst. l. 5.


for the plague and leprosy of a Ministers life, cannot be kept within his
private walls. There is nothing more delicate and abhorring all sinful sords,
than the Ermine of Christian Religion, and its true Ministry, which sets forth
the Lamb of God, without spot or blemish, who came to take away the sinful
stains of men's souls, by the effusion of his precious blood. The care of all
good Ministers, is so to live, as shall not need the impotent severities of
those Reformers, who joy as much to find faults in others, as to mend none in
themselves, and are always eloquent against their own sins in other men. Allow
us only to be, as Ministers of the Gospel for the Churches good, we desire no
indulgences, farther than the duty and dignity of our Calling does allow, and
the strictest Conscience may bear: No men shall more welcome men's favors, than
we shall do their just severities; nor do we desire greater testimonies of men's
loves to us, than such, as we use for the greatest witness of ours to them; by
never suffering them to sin, through our silence or flatteries. Let the
righteous smite us, and it shall be a kindness; let them reprove us, and reform
us, and it shall be a balm, which shall not break our heads; Psalm. 141.5.
but our prayer shall ever be, That we may not taste of the new dainties of
those supercilious censurers, and envious reformers of Ministers; who are their
enemies, because they tell them the old truths; and make them offenders for a
word, Isai. 29.21.
because they will not forbear to reprove their wickedness; who heretofore
seemed to hear them gladly, till they touched their Herodiasses. Mark 6.20.


The less scandalous Ministers are, the more that Hypocritical generation (who
have set themselves against them) are bent to destroy them: I intercede only
for such, whose greatest offense is, Eo acriores sunt odii causa quo magis
iniquae. Tacit. An. 1.
That they give lest offense to any good Christians, and do most good to this
Church; preserving still the purity and honor of their Calling, and the
Reformed Religion, against the many policies of those, who lie in wait to
destroy it; who are honored with, and are an honor to the Function of the
Ministry; whose competent, and (in some) excellent learning, and holy lives, Eo
gratiori lumine, quo spissiores tenebrae. Tert.
makes them still appear like bright stars in a dark and stormy night, amidst
the thick and broken clouds of envy and calumny, which rove far beneath them;
however they are sometime darkened by their interposing.

If, as to these men's holy Function, Ordination, and Authority, I may be happy
to give you (O excellent Christians) or any others, any satisfaction; as a
Calling useful, and necessary to the Church; as of Divine Institution, and
Catholic practice in all settled Churches, I shall then leave it to any men of
good conscience to infer, how barbarous and Antichristian a design it is; how
bad and bitter consequences it must needs produce, by any arts and ways of
human^ power and policy, to destroy and exautorate these men, and their
Ministry; in whose lives and labors, the glory of God, the honor of Jesus
Christ, and the good of men's souls are so bound up, that the^ cannot without
daily miracles be separated, or severally preserved. And for the persons of the
Ministers, which I plead for, I ho^^ to make it appear, That for their casting
thus into the fiery furnace (...) mechanic scorn, and fanatic fury; or into
the Lions den of public odium and disfavor, there will be found, by impartial
Reader^ of this Apology, Acts 4.18. Gal. 4.16. Am I therefore become your enemy
because I tell you the truth.
no more cause, than was against Daniel, or the thre^ children; no more than
for beheading John Baptist, or stoning St. Stephen; for beating and imprisoning
the Apostles, and charging them to speak no more in that Name of Jesus; or for
the Galatians hating St. Paul, or the Beasts slaying the witnesses; or the Jews
seeking to stone, and after crucifying the Lord Jesus Christ.

33. Ministers infirmities do not abrogate their Authority or Office.
Not, but that the very best Ministers of this Church own themselves still to be
but poor sinful men; and so not strangers to the common passions and
infirmities of humane nature: Men must not be angry, that Ministers are not
Angels, or such Seraphins and flaming fires, as admit no dross or defects,
incident to sinful mortality: Though they often fail, as men, yet have they not
forfeited the Authority of their Calling as Ministers; though they have
dispensed the Gospel in weakness, as earthen vessels, yet has the Treasure of
Heaven, and Power of God, been manifested by them, and in them: Take them with
all their personal failings, yet they will hardly be matched, or exceeded by
any order of men, or any Clergy in any Church under Heaven; for they have not
been behind the very chiefest of true Ministers; and far beyond any of these
new pretenders; Insomuch, That I have often been ashamed to see the necessity of
this Apology, Pro desensione samae licita est. laus proptia. Reg. Jac. 2 Cor.
12.11.
and such like Vindications of the Ministry, which ungrateful and impudent men
extort from the Ministers of England; when indeed (as St. Paul pleads for
himself; instead of thus being compelled to an unwelcome, yet just glorying)
they ought rather to have been commended and encouraged by others.

Truly, it is to me a great trouble to find out by any of their confused
Pamphlets and obscure Papers, what these Modellers of a new Ministry would be
at, in any reason of piety or prudence, more to the advantage of this Church,
or the Reformed Christian Religion, than has been heretofore, and may still be
effected and enjoyed, by the true and ancient Ministry: Would they have better
Scholars in all kinds of good learning? Acuter Disputants in controversies?
Clearer Interpreters in Commentaries upon the Sacred Texts? Better Linguists?
More solid Preachers? More pathetick Orators? more fervent Prayers; higher
Speculatists in all true Devotionals? Exacter Writers in all kinds of
Divinity? Would they have more grave, comely, prudent, and conscientious
dispencers of all holy Mysteries? Or nobler examples of all piety and virtue,
than those, which have every where abounded in the Ministers of the Church of
England, according to the several measures of their gifts and graces?

No, I find their enemies envy, is more than their pity; Non laudabisi
pietatis aemulatione, sed improba virtutis invidia feruntur, qui virtutem
aspiciunt intabescuntque relicta. Casaub.
For one century of scandalous Ministers, (which, I fear, was not so made up by
exact sifting the pretio^^ from the vile; but that it hudled up, and kneaded
some finer flower with some bran;) How many hundreds were there then, and are
still of unblamable, of commendable, of excellent, and most imitable Ministers
in this Church? As weighty, as fair, and as fit every way, yea, far beyond what
any new stamp is likely to be, for all holy admistrations! But I find, it is
not any new Truth, or Gospel, or Sacraments; or Gifts, or Graces, or Virtues,
or Morals, or Rationals, or Reals, which these new Ministers require; or can
with any forehead pretend: All is but an affectation (for the most part) to
have the same things, in a new, and worse way; which because it is of their own
invention, they so eagerly quarrel at the former order, manner of our Church and
Ministry. Many would have the same meat (else they must starve, Multi novitatis
amore in veritatis odium and praejudicium feruntur. Quum illud pulcherrimum
quod verissimum; id verissimum, quod antiquissimum. Tert. (...) Eurip. Hell.
or feed upon the wind) only it must be new dressed, and dished up to the mode
of Familistick hashes, and Socinians (Quelques chooses) Keckshoes; by more plain
and popular hands, than those of the learned Ministers. They would have a
generation of Teachers rise up unsown, out of the dust; whose father should be
corruption, and whose sister, confusion: More vulgar, submiss, precarious,
facile, dependent Preachers; who should more consider an act or ordinance of
man, than a command of Scripture, or dictate, and stroke of Conscience; be more
steered by the events and various successes of Providence, than by the constant
precepts and oracles of Gods written Word: Whose common places of divinity must
fit any Eutopian Commonwealth, what ever any power and policy shall form to
their new fancies, and interests; whose Preaching and Praying, shall make
Christ, and the Scriptures, and the Sacraments, all holy things, and the
Ministry it self of the Church, meanly servile and compliant to any State
design, and secular projects; Just as the sorry Almanack-makers do, who command
the Sun, and Moon, and Stars, and the whole host of Heaven, to assist any party
whom they list to flatter, or hope to feed upon: Such planetary Preachers, all
true Ministers abhor to be; and such their enemies deserve to have, or to be;
who observing the winds of worldly and State variations, Eccles. 11.4.
shall never sow the good seed of true Religion; nor ever serve the Lord, while
they slavishly and sinfully serve the times: Not, but that all good Ministers
know, as wise and humble men, how to be content in what Sta^^ soever they are;
and to be subject to civil powers in all honest things, Phil. 4.11. Romans 13.5.
with gratitude and due respect; yet not so, as to prostrate God, to level
Christ, to subject Conscience, to debase the glorious Gospel, its due
Reformation, and its true Ministry, and divine Authority, to the boundless
lusts, and endless designs of violent and rest, less minds.

Against all which, and chiefly against those plots and practices which aim to
overthrow the Reformed Christian Religion of this Church, and its Ministry, I
desire this Apology may be as a Pillar and Monument to posterity of my perfect
abhorrency, That when I am dead (^f it has any spark in it of an immortal
spirit, or living genius) it may testify for me, and my Brethren, the
Ministers of my mind, Luke 23.50.
in after ages; that, as Joseph of Arimathea, we neither gave counsel, nor
consent to those wild or wicked projects, which the ages will afterward see,
attended with most sad and deplorable effects; either of Atheism, Profaneness,
Ignorance, and Barbarity; or of Popish superstitions, Heretical oppressions,
and Schismatical confusions, which will follow the alteration and rejection of
the ancient, true, and Catholic Ministry of this Reformed Church; which cannot
but be attended with the subversion of many souls, as to all stability or
soundness in true Religion; with the unsatisfaction of many, and with the
unspeakable grief and scandal of all those good Christians, who love and wish
the prosperity of this Church; which I shall now endeavor to prove to be of a
most Christian and Evangelical constitution; chiefly by answering what is
alleged by those, who look upon both Church and Ministry as reprobate; and
would fain have power to damn them both, without redemption: And this they
endeavor with as much justice and truth, as Satan accused Job, Job 1.
and would have provoked God to destroy him without a cause.

OBJECTION I. That we have no true Ministry, because no true Church Way in
England.
I Find there are many and great things objected, by the Antiministerial
party, through ignorance, weakness, mistake, or malice; not only against the
Ministers, and the peculiar office of the Ministry; but also against the whole
frame of our Religion, especially as to the extern social manner of our holy
Administrations: Some of them deny us to be any true Ministers, because not in
any way of a true Church; not having any true Religion owned or established,
and exercised among us, in any right Church Way, as they call it. So that it is
not only the main pillars of Christianity, the learned and godly Ministry,
which they would change: But the whole model of our Church, and frame of our
Religion, is that, which these men would remove, either pulling it down by
force, or undermining by fraud: Therefore, I have thought it necessary, in the
first place, to countermine against these Moles, and to establish against these
Shakers, and Subverters of the very foundations of our Church and Religion.

Here I must crave leave of you, Answ. 1.
to whose favor I have dedicated this work (whose highest excellency is your
Christian Reformed Religion; who esteem it your greatest glory, with the
Emperor Theodosius, That you are Members of this Reformed Church, and in this
of the true Catholic Church,) to give these fanatic, and cavilling disputers
against our Ministry, some account of that Religion, which we profess; and of
that so much disputed, and by some despised Church Way, wherein we take our
selves to be; as upon surer grounds of divine truth, so with much more order
and decency, as to ancient pattern and prudence, than themselves: That so, as
good Christians may be comforted and confirmed in their holy Profession, so the
world may see, That we are neither ignorant our selves, nor willingly deceivers
of others, in so great a matter as Religion is, Of true Religion. Vera est
religio, quae uni vero Deo animas nostras religat. Aug. de Relig. Micah 6.8.
James 1.27.
which we publicly have professed and preached in this Church, both with
science and conscience, with judgment and integrity.

First then, We esteem True Religion to be the right performance of those
duties, which we ow to the One only true God; or to any Creature for his sake;
That is, upon such grounds, to such ends, and after such manner, as God requires
them of us, in the several relations, wherein we stand obliged to him, or them.

Internal. Lux est religionis in conscientia, lumen in conversatione. Bern. 1
Cor. 2.11. 1 John 1.3. and 3.19. Nec deest Christus ubi est fides, nec ecclesia
ubi Christus, nec societas ubi charitas, nec templum ubi cor sanctum. Cypr.
This Religion is discharged by us; first, Internally; in the Receptions and
Motions of an enlightened and sanctified Soul; to which none can immediately be
conscious, but only God, and a man's own spirit: Herein, we conceive the very
soul, life, and quintessence of true Religion does consist, so far as it is to
be considered apart, from all outward expressions, visible Form, Society, or
Church Communion; only as having spiritual inward converse and fellowship with
God and Christ, by the graces of the holy Spirit; although Christians should be
in deserts, dungeons, prisons, solitudes, and sick beds; amidst all forced
sordidness, disorders, and dissolutions of any show and profession of Religion,
as to the outward man. This sincerity wants nothing of extern fashion, or
ornament to complete its piety; but is satisfactory both to God, and a man's own
conscience, by that integrity of a judicious, holy, and devout heart; which
has devoted all its powers and faculties, to the knowledge, meditation,
adoration, imitation, love, and admiration of God; according as he was pleased
in various times and manners to reveal himself to it: Heb. 1.1.
As, partly (yet, but darkly) by the light of reason, in rational and moral
principles seconded with fears and strokes of Conscience, which is a beam and
candle of the Lord in the soul of man; Prove. 20.27. Lucerna Domini: Scintillans
in intellectu, radians in voluntate, ardens in affectu, fumans in desiderio,
flammans in amore, scrutans i^ conscientia, exhilarans in virtute, torquens in
facinore. Bern. 2 Timothy 3.16. 2 Pet. 1.19. Matthew. 10.26. Gal. 6.1. Et solid
fundanda, and ad amussim Scriptura aedificanda, and veritate stabilienda, and
charitate consummanda religio. August. Eo pulchrior est anima, quo ad summam
Dei pulchritudinem propius accedit. Bradward. (...). Greg. N. s.
but more clearly by supernatural manifestations, in dreams and visions, in
audible voices, prophetical revelations, or angelical missions: By all which,
religious light was only occasional and traditional; but now most evidently,
completely, and constantly, in that declaration of his will to mankind, which
is contained in the lively oracles of his now written and perfect Word; the
only infallible rule of a good Conscience, and foundation of true Religion:
According to which, only, we measure it; both as to its internals, which are
summarily comprehended, in the love of God; and its externals, which are
completed in that charity, which for Gods sake, we bear, and really exercise
toward all men; but chiefly to the household of faith, that is, the Church, or
Society of those, who profess to believe in Jesus Christ, as the only Savior
of sinners.

This well-grounded and well-guided Religion (as it is then an Internal,
Judicious, and Sincere devoting of the whole soul to God, as the supreme good,
offered us in Jesus Christ) We esteem the highest honor and beauty of the
reasonable soul; the divinest stamp or character on man's nature; the noblest
property and capacity of the immortal spirit in us; demonstrating, not only
its common relation to the Creator (which all things have,) but the Creators
peculiar favor, and indulgence to man; whom he teaches to fear, enableth to
serve, and encourages to love him above all: As also man's capacity, to attain
that knowledge of the divine wisdom, and that fruition of the divine love,
which only can make it truly, and eternally happy.

For true Religion, thus seated in the soul of man, 2. True Religion not barely
speculative, but also practical.
is not barely a speculative knowledge of God, according to what his wisdom
has revealed of himself, in his works, and word; As, that he is; what he is
not, as to any defects; what he is, in all positive excellencies in himself,
(which yet is a great and divine light, shining upon man's understanding from
experience, and from the historick parts of the Scripture.) But further, it
also show us, what God is to us, in Nature, Grace, Law, Gospel, Works, Word,
Creation, (...). Niss. de prof. Chr^stians.
and Christ's Incarnation; what we are to God in Christ, for duty and
dependence; what all things are to us, as they are in God, (that is, in his
wisdom, will, power, providence, etc. either making, or preserving, or
disposing them for our good and his glory.) According to which light, we come
to desire, to love, to enjoy God in all things, Ephesians. 1.23.
and all things in him; that is, within those bounds of honor, order, and those
lesser ends, which he has set in reference to the great ends of our good, and
his glory, which are as a lesser circle in a greater; having both the same
centres. At length God becomes the joy, life, beauty, exaltation, and happiness
of the believing soul; by its often contemplations of him, and sincere
devotions to him; whence we come to have an humble sight, ingenuous shame,
penitential sorrow, and just abhorrence of our sinfulness, vanity, deformity,
vileness, and nothingness compared to God, and apart from him.

After this our wills come to be inclined to him (as the most excellent good
and perfecting Beauty) drawn after him, and duly affected with him; to fear him
for his power and justice; to venerate him for his excellent majesty and glory;
to admire him for incomprehensible perfection; to love him for his goodness in
himself, in all things; and in Christ above all; (in whom his love, grace, and
bounty is most clearly discovered, and freely conveyed to us;) We come to
believe him for his veracity or infallible truth in his Law and Gospel; to be
guided by his unerring wisdom, and directions, which are discerned in the
mandates of his Word to us, and agreeable motions of his Spirit in us (which
are always conform to each other: Virtus Spiritus sancti in m^tibus, and
veritas verbi in mandatis suavissi^^ and inseparabili nexu conjuncta sunt; nec
magis ab invicem distrahi possunt quam calor solis a nativo lumine: Quum a
Spiritu sit veritas, ut inveritate sit Spiritus necesse est. August.
) We come also to obey him in all things for his soverein Empire and Authority;
to trust in him at all times for his faithfulness and immutability; to hope in
him, and to wait patiently for the consummation of his rich and precious
promises, 2 Pet. 1.4. both in grace and glory. All which we believe upon the
divine testimony of the written Word; however we cannot by bare humane reason,
comprehend or demonstrate them; oftentimes praying to God, as all sufficient,
omniscient, omnipresent, and omnipotent: supplicating for that, from his grace,
power, and bounty, which we have not, deserve not, nor can attain otherways, in
this lapsed, corrupted, and cursed estate of our nature.

restraints, terrors, convictions, conversions; sweet, yet powerful,
attractions; victorious, yet delectable prevailings, agreeable to the nature of
the soul, and the liberty of the will; which then recovers its true liberty,

when by the cords of Gods love, its unwillingness is bound up; and its chains
of violent lusts are taken off: Whence such great impressions, and real
changes, are made upon every rational faculty in the soul; as those from
darkness to light, from captivity to freedom, from death to life; according to
the several representations of Gods excellencies in nature, in morals, and in
mysteries; wherein, the exceeding great riches of his free grace, and love to
us in Christ, Ephesians. 1.9. and 2.7. has the most softning, melting, and
transforming influence; which, fully received upon the soul, the whole-man, in
mind and spirit, in fancy, understanding, judgment, memory, will, appetite,
affections, passions, and conscience, becomes partaker, through grace, of a
divine nature, 2 Pet. 1.4. (compared to what he was) and becomes a 2 Cor. 5.17.
new creature, not as to its essence; but as to all ends, principles, motions,
and actions; which are begun and continued, designed and ended in holiness;
that is, in humble and unfeigned regards to the glory of God, and exact
purposes of conformity to the will of God, in his written Word. New creatures
by a newness of grace; in which, we remain what we were, Men; but are made,
what we were not, Saints.

3. Scripture the only rule of true Religion. 1 Timothy 3.15. Heb. 4.12. Acts
7.38. Romans 3.2.
To which Word of God in the Scriptures, we being guided and directed by the
constant and most credible testimony of the Church of Christ, (that pillar and
ground of Truth) so as to receive, and regard them, They at length, by Gods
grace on the heart, demonstrate themselves (by their native and divine light)
to be the very Word of God; those lively oracles, which set forth most divine
precepts, paterns, prophecies, histories and mysteries; proffers also and
promises of such good things, as the soul would most desire, most wants, and
only can truly delight in living and dying; and to eternity.

Religion consists in no fond fancies.

these Scriptures, which we justly call The Word of God, understood in their
true sense and meaning; we do not own any thing for a ground, rule, or duty in
Religion: N^r are we at all moved, by those bold triflings, and endless
janglings about Religion, Grace, Spirit, and Inspirations, which weak and vain
men, (looking to their own foolish fancies, and not to the divine Oracles) do
scatter too and fro, as chaff, to blind the eyes of simple and credulous
people; which would make Religion, a matter of novelty and curiosity; of
cavilling merely and contending, of censuring and condemning others of
self-confidence and intolerable boastings, of sequaciousness and feminine
softness, of custom only and paternal example, or of ease and idleness; where,
out of a lazy temper, neglecting all ordinary means, Ministry, and duties, some
men expect by special inspirations and dictates, to have their defect of pains
and industry supplied: Or else they place their Religion, in the adhering to
some party and faction; in popular and specious insinuations, and pretensions;
or in admiration of men's persons, and gifts; or in the prevailencies of power
and worldly successes; or in unjust gain and sacrilegious thrift; or in great
zealotries for some new form and way of constituting, disciplining, and
governing Churches; or in boldness to affirm, to deny, and to do any thing; or
in mere verbal assurances, and loose confidences of being elected and
predestined to happiness, of being called to be Saints, and Preachers, and
Prophets, in a new and extraordinary way; to advance such opinions and
practices, as no holy men of old, ever knew, acted, or owned for Religious; or
lastly, in railing upon, despising, and seeking to destroy all those, that
approve not, or follow not those self-conceited confidences and violent
extravagancies, which some men affect in their rude and unwarrantable
undertakings. Such were the fanatic, mad, and at last, sad, Religion of those
Circumcellions of old, and those Anabaptists, and other later Sects in Germany
Sleidan. Com. l. 10. ad an. 1535.
; who wanted nothing but constant successes and continued power to have made
all men, as wild and wicked as themselves, or else to have destroyed them.

Alas, who sees not, how far different and much easier to sinful flesh and
blood, to vain ambition, and proud hypocrisies, these pretty soft fallacies,
these froths and fumes; those great swelling words, 2 Pet. 2.18.
and titles of vanity, That God is their Father, that they are Saints, and
spiritual, inspired Prophets, sent of God to call the World to repentance; to
reign with Christ: Those rotten sensualities of Religion (as some blasphemously
call it;) those libidinous excrescencies; those lying prophecies, etc. How much
easier (I say) these are, than those humble, sober, exact, and constant ties of
Conscience, and duties of true Religion; by which holy men and women, in all
ages, have given all diligence to make their calling and election sure, 2 Pet.
1.10. Non est vera aut firma certitud^ gloriae, sine diligenti industria
gratiae? Chrysostom. Phil. 2.12. 1 Cor. 15.32. I die daily. Vere Christum sequi, est
omnia perpeti, indies crucifigi, jugiter ^i^ri. Prosp. 2 Pet. 1.6. 1 Pet. 4.18.
Non vult Deus ut delicato itinere ad caelum perveniamus. Jeron. Aut hoc non est
Evangelium aut by non sunt Evangelici. Luth. Vana est religio quae sceliri
locum facit. Aen. Syl. Van^ est religio quae vera non est; nec vera esse potest

quaerendo Deum salvari possumus. August.
to work out their salvation with fear and trembling; by hearing, reading,
searching and meditating on the Scriptures; by repenting, fasting, praying,
watching, and weeping; by examining, trying, judging, and condemning their
sinful self, even in the most specious and successful actions. Thus by
mortification and self-denial, coming to the Cross of Christ; taking it up;
bearing it, and fastening themselves to it, as to all just strictnesses, holy
severities, and patient sufferings; still endeavoring to abound in all
exactness of justice, charity, meekness, temperance, and innocence, before God
and man. Thus going with some holy agony, through many difficulties the narrow
way, true Christians (having done all) enter in at the strait-gate, which leads
to life, and are scarcely saved.

These were harder disciplines, and rougher severities of piety, than our
delicate novelists; our gentle Enthusiasts; our smiling Seraphicks; our
triumphant Libertines; our softer Saints can endure; which makes them so
impatient (as Ahab to Eliah, and Micaiah) to hear, and bear the words of
faithful and true Ministers; which seem as hard sayings; when they recommend
and urge these Scripturals and Morals of truth and holiness, justice, mercy,
and humility, Micah 6.8. to be the only reals of Religion: In which, the duty,
rule, end, comfort, and crown of true Religion, do consist; whose greatest and
surest enjoyment, is self-denial; bringing the lost soul, to find it self
lost, and to seek after God; and having found him, to follow him with all
obediential love; with a pious, impatient, panting and thirsting after
happiness in him, by the ways of holiness; as having none in Heaven or Earth
comparable to him; still earnestly pressing toward him; as always, and only
wanting him, in the fullest enjoyments of all things here; unsatiably satisfied
with his unsurfetting-sweetness; ever filled with him, yet ever longing more to
partake of him: The soul in this its excessive thirst, and spiritual fever,
being confident, it can drink up that Jordan; that ocean of divine fullness;
which alone, it sees, can give it an happy satisfaction to eternity.

4. The Souls search after, and discoveries of God.
The devout and pious Soul, thus intent to God, and content with him, is not
always sceptically wandering in endless mazes and labyrinths of Religion; either
groping in obscurities, or guessing at uncertainties, or grapling with
intricate disputes, or perplexed with various opinions, or shifting its
parties, or doubting its profession, or confounding its morals, or dazeling its
intellectual eye, by looking to prospects of immensity, and objects of
eternity; (which are so remote from it, and far above it, that it only sees
this, (...). Dionys. Quod est omni creatura melius, id Deum dicimus. Aug.
Retract.
That it can see nothing of that transcendent Good, which we call God. (Who is
indeed, that superexcellent excellency, which we can least know as he is; and
can no way comprehend in his ineffable essence, and most incomprehensible
perfections.)

But, the Soul in its religious search after, and devout applications to, this
supreme Good, which it esteems, as its God, stays and solaces it self (as
Miners do, who still follow and chiefly intend the richest Vain) with those
lesser grains and sparks of divine goodness and beauty, which it finds every
where scattered in its passage among the Creatures; which are as little essays,
pledges, and tokens of that divine glory and excellency, which must needs be
infinitely more admirable, and delectable in God himself.

The pious (which is the only wise and well advised) Soul, Habet Deus
testimonia totum hoc quod sumus and in quo sumus. Tert. l. 1. adv. Mar. Psalm.
111.2. Psalm. 8. Dei opera sunt quotidiana miracula, consueta vilescunt. Aug.
Romans 1.20.
so soon as ever it seriously searches after God, finds him in some kind or
other, every where present; and in every thing lovely, yea, admirable, both
within and without it self; yet still it conceives him to be infinitely above
it self; and all things. Something of God it discovers, and accordingly
admireth, adoreth, praises, loves, and exalts him, in the order, goodness,
greatness, beauty, variety, and constancy of his works, which are every day
visible; something it perceives of his sweetness and delectableness in the
sober, moderate, and holy delectations, which our senses afford us, when they
enjoy those objects, which are convenient, and fitted for them; something it
observes of divine wisdom, power, benignity, and justice, in the experiences of
Gods providence, bounty, and patience, which the histories of all times afford;
something it discerns of God, in those common beams and principles of reason,
which shine in all men's minds, and are evidenced in the consent of all
Nations. Amplissin a mer^ est bona conscientia. Hic murus aheneus, etc. --
Prima est bac ultio quod se Judice nemo nocens absolvitur, etc. Juv. Matthew.
1.6, 8. If I be a father, etc. Offer it now to thy Prince, etc. Tam pater, tam
pius, tam beneficus nemo. Tert. de Deo.
Sometime also in the reflections, terrors, or tranquilities of its own, and
other men's consciences; which, are as the first Heaven or Hell, rewarding the
good, or punishing the bad intentions and actions of every man: More fully it
sees God in the manifestations of the divine Word; in the exactness of the
Moral Law; in the rules of Justice given to all men; of which, their own reason
and will is the measure and standard. Being commanded to do to other men, as we
would have them do to us, Matthew. 7.12. yea, and to do to God also; in the
relations whereby we stand obliged to him, for duty, love, and gratitude, as we
would have others do to us; when we are as fathers, or masters, or friends, or
benefactors, or well-willers; against which, to offend, is by all men thought
most barbarous, unjust, and wicked; how much more against God, who has the
highest merit upon us? Yet further, the Soul searching after God, finds his
wisdom and prescience in all those prophetical predictions, and many
prefigurations of things to come; Idoneum est divinitatis testimonium veritas
divinationis. Tert. Apol. c. 20.
which, from several hands, and at several times derived, have yet punctually
been fulfilled; chiefly in the coming of the Messiah, the sum, center, and
consummation of all prophecies and promises; which setting forth the nature,
love, life, and death of Jesus Christ, were all most exactly accomplished in
him, and by him; on whom were those notable signatures and characters of the
divine wisdom and power, John 1.14.
that his glory appeared to men, as the glory of the only begotten Son of God,
full of grace, and truth.

The freeness and fullness of this Evangelical grace and truth by Jesus Christ,
the faithful Soul further discerns in the sacred emblems and seals of the holy
Sacraments; by which the divine goodness is represented and conveyed to us
under the notions and efficacy of those things, which are most necessary to our
lives; either for Being, or Ornament; to nourish us, to cleanse us, and to
cheer us. Moreover, the pious Soul sees God in the exemplary patience of the
holy Martyrs; in the miraculous constancy of the heroic Confessors; in the
humility of true Penitents; in the purity and amendment of real Converts; in
the contentedness of true Believers; in the mertifulness and charity of true
Christians; in the mortifyings, and self-denyings (as to this world) of all
true Saints, which are followers of Christ; and lastly, in that holy ordination
and succession of the Evangelical Ministry; which as Christ instituted for the
Churches good, so he has through all the vicissitudes of times, amidst all
oppositions, preserved it to these days; and by it, the knowledge of God, and
the faith of Christ in the World.

The devout Soul still guided and going on by the light of the Ministry,
discerns something of God; which is yet more retired, secret, and ineffable, in
the enlightnings, softnings, serenities, enlargements, calmings, and comforts,
which are made by a divine power and supernatural influence upon it self; where
it beholds the brightest glimpses of divine glory, through the face of Jesus
Christ, and by the efficacies of his most sweet and holy Spirit, who is both
God and man; subject to our infirmities, sensible of them, and victorious over
them: Him the Soul answerably loves; as man, with a love of union and
complacency; as God, with the love of admiration and ecstasy; as both God and
man, with a love of adherence and satisfaction: Heb. 7.25.
As one, that has undertaken, and is able to save it to the uttermost;
reconciling it with preparing it for, and uniting it to, the supreme Good, God.

All these excellencies of Christ, it sees diffused and derived to it by
convenient means, instituted and continued in the Church; which as pipes laid
into the Oceans unexhaustible fullness, draw from it, not to what measure it can
give, but to what we want, and can receive.

At length this devout Soul, by this daily confluence of many heavenly
Meditations, holy Motions, and happy Experiments, flowing (like lesser
rivolets) from all parts of the Creation, from Scripture, and from its own,
with others experiences, to this stream of the knowledge of God; It finds it
self by degrees advanced, like Ezekiels Ezekiel. 47.
waters, from vulgar and shallow conceptions, and answerable affections, to
mighty and profound contemplations; which, gathering strength by their daily
increasings, like an imperious, and irresistible torrent, carry away the devout
Soul in its holy propensities, and impetuous fervencies toward God: Impatient
of any stop or hinderance, till, at last, it comes (as all Rivers into the
Ocean) to be wholly resigned, and happily resolved into its Alpha and Omega,
its principle and perfection, its fountain, and its fullness, God.

So then, when the Soul in ways of true Religion comes to know, and love, and
serve God, it is not conversant in vagrant fancies, in uncertain speculations,
in in-significant notions; but it so far really enjoys him, as it loves him;
and loves him, as it sees him; and sees him, as it seriously and deliberately
observes him; (there being nothing of true Religion in volatile spirits, and
transient glances;) which it does most evidently, though not perfectly; darkly,
yet truly, in those glasses of the Creatures; in the Scriptures, 1 Cor. 13.12.
and in its own Conscience; in all ways of Goodness, Truth, and Holiness; in
lights Natural, Moral, and Evangelical; by all which, the Soul, as the Eye,
sees somewhat of the divine glory of that invisible Sun, in the descents,
scatterings, and aptitudes of its beams; whose infinite, and entire brightness
it cannot, without injury to it self, fully, and immediately, behold. Exodus
33.20.


So that herein (we see) true and solid Religion, both by its light and
holiness, its truth and practice, abundantly discovers, the fancifulness,
levity, pride, vanity, fondness, and futility, of all those giddy opinions and
pretensions, by which some men seek to amuse the world, and to abuse honest
hearts: And also it shows its own real worth, beauty, dignity, fullness,
usefulness, wisdom, and power; by all which it fits and fills the Souls various
faculties and vast capacity: And in so doing it gives the devout Soul, the
greatest evidences and surest demonstrations of its own immortality, Malunt
impii extingui, quam ad supplicia reparari. Mi. Fael. Souls immortality
discovered in true Religion.
beyond what any arguments drawn from ordinary reason and philosophy can do:
All which the Atheistical impudence of some men easily e^ude, having no
experimental knowledge of God; and living without God in the world, they are
content to imagine an utter extinction of their souls.

Whereas the sanctified Soul concludes, and glories in its immortality; which
it endeavors to improve to a blessed eternity; when it considers seriously, and
alone; whence can those high and holy enlargements, desires, and designs arise,
so far above, and beyond all worldly objects and enjoyments? whence that
unsatisfiedness, which carries the soul of man, with ambitious impatiencies, to
this height of coveting after a blessed eternity, Romans 2.7.
and the supreme Good, God blessed for ever? Whence this magnetic tendency and
divine traction of love to God, and to his infinite goodness; but only from
the Father of our spirits, and Fountain of our souls, God? And why all these
meditations, desires, and motions, planted in us by so good and wise a Creator,
if never to be enjoyed by us, in those satisfactions, which only can flow from
some divine and perfective object? Sure it is all one to omnipotent goodness,
to fill us with the perfect good desired; as to endue us with the desires of
that good; which are but our torments and imperfections, if never to be in
completion: Our very desires of Heaven, would else be our Hell; and our
longings after happiness, our misery. Nor is it agreeable to the methods of
divine wisdom and goodness, to plant frustaneous and vain desires, or
Tantalising tendencies in man's nature, which he has done in no other Creature;
who attain whatever they naturally covet, or have innate propensities to. The
same divine power having prepared the object, has also implanted the desire.
This unproportionableness of the Creators dealing with man, is less to be
imagined, when we consider in the sacred story, That man had most of divine
counsel and deliberation in his Creation; Genesis 1.26.
(not as needful to God, who can work by omniscient and omnipotent power, in an
instant) but, implying to us, those most exact and accurate proportions
observed by the great and allwise Creator, in his formation of man: All other
Creatures rising up, as bubbles on water, so soon as the formative Word of God,
in its several commands, fell like distinct drops from Heaven, on the face of
the great deep, the Chaos, or Abyss; But man, as a signet or seal, was graven
by a special hand, and deliberate method of God, with the marks and characters
of his own holy image, in spirituality, wisdom, righteousness, purity, liberty,
eternity, and a proportionate capacity to enjoy whatever felicity he can
understand and desire.

5. Man's improvement.
That, if we raise man to the highest glory and perfection, which he covets, and
is capable of in this world of vanity and mortality; we shall see something in
him of a little god, like the figure of a great monarch expressed in a small
model or signet: For, bring him from the sords of his nativity, (...). Plat.
from his infant infirmities, from his childish simplicities, from his youthful
vanities; redeem him, by the politure of good education, from his rustic
ignorance, his clownish confidences, his brutish dullness, Stolida ferocia. Tac.
his country solitude, his earthy ploddings, his beggarly ind^gences, or
covetous necessities; rack him off further, and refine him from the lees of
sensual and inordinate lusts, from swelling and surly pride, from base and mean
designs, (...). Plat. de Cupiditat.
from immoderate affections, violent passions, unreasonable impulses, and
depraved temptations, from within or without: Then furnish him with health,
procerity, and beauty; fortify him with competent strength, both single and
social; endue him with all wisdom, both divine and humane, which the mind of
man is capable of; compass him with all fullness and plenty; invest him with
that public honor, which (as beams of the Sun, concentred in a Burning-glass,)
arising from the consent of many men, to unite the honor of their protection
and subjection in one man, makes up the luster of a majesty, something more
than earthly and humane; coming nearest to the resemblance of what is divine
and heavenly. Add to these endowments of power, opportunity, and place to do
good; those real and useful graces, those charitable and communicative virtues,
which enlarge the nobler soul, to a love of the public good, and a zeal for
the common welfare of mankind, in works of humanity, gentleness, pity,
patience, fortitude, justice, mercy, benignity, and munificence: (...); Clem.
Alex. e Menandro. How goodly a creature is a man, while he continues a man?

Exodus 22.28. Psalm. 82.6. John 10.34. Magistrates are called gods.

Paternum est docendi munus. Psalm. 34.11. Jer. 9.34. Beatitudo est
interminabilis vitae perfecta possessio. Boet.


What can more lively express to us a terrene visible Deity? whom we may
(without Idolatry) own and reverence so far, as, without blasphemy, we may call
such a man a God; while he wisely teaches and instructs others (a work
worthy of a Parent, a Prince, a God;) or he powerfully protects, or he
bountifully rewards, or justly punishes, or mercifully pardons, or
graciously loves others, and rejoices in their well-do^ng and happiness,
without any design or interest of his own. Yea, what do we ordinarily wish, and
expect, or fancy more from God, than all these excellencies (of which, we see
there are some sparks and beams, even now in man's nature) sublimated to
infinite perfections; and extended to us, with eternal durations? is not this,
that estate of full enjoyment, which we call Heaven? Wherein we hope never to
want those divine and immediate communicatings, with the all-sufficient bounty,
and unenvious benignity of God, is, as well able; so, no less, well pleased, to
impart to the soul, than its necessities do require, and its desires
ambitiously, and unsatiably covet to be supplied by them: Not one^y in order to
this natural and politic Being; which as men we have with men, for a moment
(which is daily pressed upon with the fatal and inevitable necessity of dying,
which is a ceasing to enjoy God, by the mediation of the Creatures, in this
visible world) but also, in reference to that rational, religious, spiritual,
gracious, perfect, and unchangeable Being, whereto we naturally aspire; (for,
who would not be ever happy?) by enjoying himself, in the wisdom, strength,
beauty, fullness, love, and sweetness, flowing for ever from the excellencies of
the Creator: The fruition of whom, is only able to exclude a^l defects, and
fears; to satisfy all desires, to reward all duties, to requite all
sufferings, to complete all happiness, to crown and perfect all true Religion;
which in Heaven shall be no other, than what we desire it to be here on Earth;
that is, a right knowledge, and a willing performance of that duty, which the
reasonable creature (Man) ows for ever to God: First, as his Creator,
Conservator, and Redeemer, by Jesus Christ.

6. True Religion internal instates the Soul in Christ, and in the true Church.
1 Cor. 2.10, 11. John 15.5. He that abides in me, and I in him, etc. 2 Timothy
2.19. The Lord knows them that are his. Extra ecclesiam non est salus.
This then we look upon, as the Religious frame and temper of a reasonable Soul,
in its internal dispositions and private devotions toward God, it self, and
others: By which it is daily preparing for a glorious and blessed immortality;
of which holy frame, it self only can be conscious, with God; and the greatest
evidence is, That sincerity of heart, which has no other rule, but Gods Word;
no other end, but Gods glory; and no other comfort, but in the constancy of
this disposition; which is the fruit of Gods holy Spirit in it. Certainly, such
a Soul cannot, but be in, and of the true, and to man, invisible Church of God;
so far as it has a mystical, spiritual, and invisible life; which consists in
the union to Christ, as the head, by faith, love, and all other obediential
graces of his Spirit, which are common to every true believer. Out of this
Church, its most true, There is no revealed salvation, possibly to be had for
any that live to be masters of their own reason, will, and actions.

Yea further, such a religious soul, has a capacity of, and right unto that
external, visible, politic, and social communion with the Church of Christ,
where ever Christians enjoy outward fellowship, with one another, in public
profession: Which communion, however such a soul, solitary it may be, and
sequestered from all Christian company, may not actually enjoy; being forcibly
denied that happiness (of which, many do wilfully and peevishly deprive
themselves by proud or peevish, and uncharitable separations,) through
banishment, prison, captivity, sickness, etc. Yet, that Christian belief, love,
and charity, which such an one bears to Christ, and to the Catholic Church of
Christ, scattered in many places, and different in many ceremonial rites, and
observations; These (I say) do infallibly invest this solitary Christian, in
communion and holy fellowship with the whole Church of Christ, in all the
World; as brethren and sisters are related as near kindred, when they are never
so far a sunder in place; which owns the same God, believes the same common
salvation by the same Lord Jesus; uses the same seals of the blessed
Sacraments; Ephesians. 4.5. Jude 2.
professes the same ground of faith, and rule of holiness, the written Word of
God; and bears the like gracious and charitable temper to others, as sanctified
by same Spirit of Christ, which really unites every charitable and true
believer to Christ, and so to every M^mber of true Church; however it may want
opportunities to express this communion in actual, and visible conversation,
either civil or sacred; by enjoying that society, as men, or that ordinary
ministry, as Christians, which is by Christ appointed in the Church; as well
for its outward profession, distinction, and mutual assistance; as for its
inward comfort, and communion with himself.

The willing neglect of all such extern communion, and the causeless separation
from all Church Fellowship in Word, Sacraments, Prayer, Order, and charitable
Offices, must needs be inconsistent with any comfort; because against charity,
and so far against true Religion, and the hopes of salvation: For, those inward
graces, wherein the life and soul of Religion do consist, are not ordinarily
attained or maintained, but by those outward means and ministrations, which the
wisdom of God in Christ has appointed for the Churches social good, and
edification together: In the right enjoyment of which consists that extern and
joint celebration or profession of Christian Religion, which gives Being, name,
and distinction to that society, which we call The Church of Christ on Earth.
And this indeed is that Church properly, which is called out of the World;
which as men, we may discern; and of which, both in elder and later times, so
many disputes have been raised, which we may describe to be,

An holy company or fraternity of Christians, who being called by the Ministry
of the Gospel, to the knowledge of God in Christ, do publicly profess in all
holy ways and orderly institutions, that inward sense of duty and devotion,
which they ow to God, by believing and obeying his Word: Also that charity,
which they ow to all men, especially to those that profess to be Christ's
Disciples, and hold communion with his Body, the Catholic Church.

Herein I conceive, That the social outward profession of Religion, 7. Of the
Church as a visible society of Professors believing in Christ. Ea est Catholica
ecclesia, quae unicam and candem semper and ubique fidem in Christo veram and
Scripturis sundatam profitetur. V^n. Lyrin. Ephesians. 2.9. As Fellow-Citizens of the
Saints, and of the household of God: Ye are built upon the Foundation of the
Apostles and Prophets, Jesus Christ being the chief corner stone, etc.
as it is held forth in the Word of God, in its Truths, Seals, Duties, and
Ministry, makes a true Church among men: And the true Church as Catholic, yea,
any part or branch of this true Catholic Church, (whose Head, Foundation,
Rites, Seals, Duties, and Ministry, are for the main of the same kind, in all
times and places,) cannot but make a right profession of true Religion; as to
the main essence and fundamentals; which consists in truth, holiness, and
charity: However there may be many variations, differences, and deformities in
superstructures, both of opinion and practice: For however particular Churches,
which have their limits of time, and place, and persons, (circumstances which
necessarily circumscribe all things in this world) are still, as distinct arms
and branches of a great Tree, issuing from one and the same root Jesus Christ;
and have the same sap of truth and life conveyed in some measure to them, 1
Cor. 3.12. If any man build upon this foundation gold, etc. st^bble, etc. V.
15. If his work be burnt, he shall suffer loss, but he himself shall be saved.
Ephesians. 4.4. There is one Body, and one Spirit, one Lord, one Faith, one Baptism,
etc. V. 16. The whole body is fitly joined together, according to the effectual
working in the measure of every part, etc.

U^us Deus unam sidem tradidit, unam ecclesiam toto orb diffudit; hanc

by the same way of the right Ministry of the Word, Sacraments, and Spirit, (so
that in these respects, they are all of one and the same Catholic Body,
communion, descent and derivation;) yet, as these have their external
distinctions and severings in time, place, persons, and manners; or any outward
rites of profession, and worship; so they usually have distinct denominations,
and are subject to different accidents, as well as proportions: Some branches
of the same Tree may be withering, mossy, cancred, peeled, broken, and barren,
yea, almost dead; yet, old, and great, and true: Others, may be more
flourishing, fruitful, clean, and entire, though of a latter shooting for time,
and of a lesser extension for number and place; yet still of the same Tree; so
far, as they have really, or only seemingly, and in the judgment of charity,
communion with, relation to, and dependence on the Root and bulk; being neither
quite broken off, and dead, by Heretical Apostacies, denying the Lord that
bought them, or damnable errors, which overthrow the Faith; nor yet slivered
and rent, by Schismatical uncharitableness, proud, or peevish rents and
divisions: Which last, although they do not wholly kill, and c^op off from all
communion with the Church of Christ; yet they so far weaken and wither
Religion, in the fruits and comforts of it; as each Schism pares off from its
sect and faction, that Rind and Bark (as it were) of Christian love, and
mutual charity, through which (chiefly) the sap, and juice of true Religion,
with the graces and comforts of it, are happily and most thrivingly conveyed to
every living branch of the Catholic Church; so as to make it live, at least,
and bring forth some good fruit, however it be not so strong, fair, and ample,
as others may be: As the Church of Sardis, which had a Rev. 3.1.
name to live, and was dead in some part and proportion; yet is bid to watch,
and strengthen the things that remain, which are ready to die, etc.

8. Of the Church, as called Catholic. See learned Dr. Field of the Church.
(...).
In this point then. Touching the true Church of Christ, in regard of outward
profession, and visible communion (to the touch of which part, my design thus
leads me) I purpose not so far to gratify the endless, and needless janglings
of any adversaries of this Church of England; as to plunge my self, or the
Reader, into the wide and troubled Sea of controversy, concerning the Church:
Considering, that many good Christians have been, and still are, in the true
Catholic Church, by profession of that true faith, and holy obedience, which
unite to the Head, Jesus Christ; and by charity, which combines the members of
his Body together; although they never heard the dispute, or determination of
this so driven a controversy; As many are in health, and sound, who never were
under Physicians hands, or heard any Lecture of Anatomy: Yea, although they may
be cut off, and cast out of the particular communion of any Church, by the
Anathemaes, and excommunicating sentences of some injurious and passionate
Members of that Church; yet may they continue still in communion with Christ,
and consequently with his Catholic Church; that is, with all those, who either
truly have, or profess to have communion with Christ.

My purpose is, only to give an account, as I have done of true Religion in
the internal power of it; so also of the true Church, as to the external
profession of Religion: That thereby I may establish the faith, and comforts of
all sober and good Christians, in this Church of England: That they may not be
shaken, corrupted, or rent off, by their own instability, and weakness; or by
the fraud and malice of those, who glory more in the proselytes they gain to
fanatic factions, by uncharitable rendings from this Church, than in any
communion they might have in humble and charitable ways, with the Catholic
Church; or any of the greater, and nobler parts of it; which they (most
impertinently) deny to be any Churches, or capable of any order, power, joint
authority, larger government, or ampler communion.

For the Catholic Church of Christ, (that is, Ignat. ep. ad Phil. Cypr. de
unitate Eccl. Solis multi radii, unum lumen. August. lib. de unitate ecclesiae.
Et omnes patres. Ephesians. 1.22. Christ the Head over all things to the, Church. 1 Timothy 3.15. The Church of the living God; the pillar and ground of truth. Heb.

Cor. 12. The Body is not one Member, but many, etc. vid^.
the universality of those, who profess to believe in the name of Jesus Christ,
according to the Scriptures;) That this is primarily and properly called a
Church, often in Scripture, there is no doubt: As the whole is called a Body,
in its integrality or compleatness of parts and organs; whose every limb and
part is corporeal too, and of the Body, as to its nature, kind, or essence.
This Church, which is called The Spouse and Body of Christ, is (as its Head)
but one; in its integrality or comprehensive latitude; as the Ark containing
all such, as profess the true faith of Christ: And to this are given (as all
powers and faculties of nature to the whole man) primarily and eminently those
powers, privileges, gifts, and titles, which are proper to the Church of
Christ; however, they are orderly exercised by some particular parts or
members, for the good of the whole. The essence, integrality, and unity, of
this Catholic Church consists, not in any local convention, or visible
communion, or public representation, of every part of it; but in a mysterious
and religious communion with the same God, Ecclesia in universum mundi
disseminata unam domum habitans, unam animam and cor and os abet. Iraen. l. 1.
c. 3. Ephesians. 4.4, 5. Jude 2. (...). Just. M. Dial. cum Tryphone.
by the same Mediator Jesus Christ; and to this Mediator Jesus Christ, by the
same Word and Spirit, as to the internal part of Religion; also by profession
of the same Truth and common Salvation, joined with obedience to the same
Gospel, and holy Ministry, with charity, and comely order, as to the external.

In this so clear an Article of our Faith, I need not bestow my pains, since it
is lately handled very fully, learnedly, and calmly, by a godly Minister of
this Church of England Mr. Hudson of the Catholic Church Tot and tantae
ecclesiae una est illa ab Apostolis prima, dum unam omnes praebent veritatem.

9. Of a National Church, or distinct and larger part of the Catholic.
This name of Church, being evidently given to the universality of those, who by
the Ministry of the Gospel, are called out of the way of the World; and by
professing of it, and submitting externally to its holy Ministry, Order, Rules,
Duties, and Institutes, are distinguished from the rest of the World: It cannot
be hard for any sober understanding to conceive, in what aptitude of sense, any
part of this Catholic Church, is also called a Church; with some additional
distinctions, and particular limitations, visible and notable among men, and
Christians; by which some are severed from others in time, place, persons, or
any other civil discriminations of policy and society: Which give nearer and
greater conveniences, as to the enjoyment and exercise of humane and civil; so
of Christian communion, and the offices or benefits of religious relations.

1 Cor 1.2. To the Church of God, which is at Corinth. Acts 13.1. The Chu ch of
Antioch. (...). Acts 14.23. Tit. 1.5. (...). Rev. 2. and 3. Ecclesiam apud
unamquamque civitatem condiderunt Apostol^, a quibus traducem fidei and semina
doctrinae caeterae ecclesiae mutuatae sunt. Tertul. de Prae. c. 20. Consuetudo
est certissima loquendi norma. Quin^il.
The Spirit of God in the Scripture gives sufficient warrant to this style, and
language; calling that a Church (as of Rome, Ephesus, Corinth, Jerusalem,
Antioch, etc.) which consisted of many Congregations, and Presbyters in a City,
and its Territory, or Province: So the Apostle Paul in his Epistles to several
Churches, distinguishes them by the civil and humane distinctions of place,
and Magistracy; and the Spirit of Christ to the Asiatick Churches, calls each
a Church distinctly, which were in great associations, of many faithful, under
many Presbyters: And these under some chief Presidents, Apostles, Angels, or
Bishops, residing in the prime or Mother Cities; where Christianity was first
planted, end from whence it spread to the Territories, or Provinces about.

One would think, besides common speech, among all Christians, (which is
sufficient to justify, what word is used to express our meanings to others,)
That this were enough to confute the simplicity or peevishness of those, who,
to carry on new projects, dare aver, That they know no such thing as a National
Church; 1 Pet. 2.9. Ye are an holy Nation, a peculiar people; may be said of
any Christians.
and with much coyness, disdain to own, or understand any relation of order,
duty, subordination, or charity, they have to any such Church: Of which, they
say they know no virtue, no use, no necessity, no conveniences, as to any
Christian and Religious ends. Which so wilful and affected ignorance, was never
known, till these latter and perilous times had found out the pleasure of
Paradoxes; by which, men would seem wiser, and more exact, both in their words
and fancies, than either pious antiquity, or the Scriptures: Hoping by such
gross and unexpected absurdities, (which would fain appear very shie and
scrupulous in language) to color over Shismatical and Anarchical designs; and
under such fig leaves to hide the shame and folly of their factious agitations
and humors; which makes them unwilling to be governed by any in Church or
State, without themselves have an oar in the Boat, and a share in the
Government. This poor concernment of some men's small ambitions, makes them
disown any Church, but such a conventicle or parcel as some men fancy to
collect and call; which they infect with the same fancies of sole and full
Churchship, and separate Power. Whereas the Lord Jesus Christ always first
called men by his Ministers to his Church; and by Baptism admitted them; and by
meet Governors, whom he sent and ordained, ruled them, as his flock, in
greater, as well as lesser parties; Genesis 32.
as Jacob did his distinct flocks in the hands of his sons.

By the same Cynical severity, these men may deny, they have relation to any
other men, being themselves complete men; or at most that they are to regard
none, but their families where they live; and so cast off all observance to any
greater Societies in Towns, or Cities, or Commonweals; yea, and all sense of
humanity to the generality of mankind, whom they shall never see together, or
be acquainted with. Who doubts, notwithstanding this morose folly, but that, as
in all right reason, equity, and humanity, every man is related by the common
nature to all mankind; so also, to particular polities and societies of men
greater or smaller; according to the distinct combinations, into which
providence has cast him with them, either in Cities, or Countries? With whom,
to refuse communion, and disown relation, is to sin against the common
principles of society, order, and government, which are in man's nature; which
God has implanted, Reason suggests, and all wise men have observed, for the
obtaining of an higher and more common good, by the public and united
influence of the counsel, strength, and authority of many, than can be
obtained, in scattered parcels, or small and weaker fraternities.

In like manner, to be in and of the Church, is not only to be a true believer
(which gives internal and real union to Christ, and to all true Christians in
the Church Catholic, Ecclesia una est quae in multitudinem latius incremento
facunditatis extenditur. Cyp. de Eccl. unit. 1 Cor. 2.11. What man knows the
things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him.
) of which, no man can judge, because he cannot discern it, save only in the
judgment of charity) But it implies also to have and to hold, that profession
of Christian Religion, in such external polities, and visible communion with
others, as the providence of God, both offers and requires of us; according to
the time, place, and opportunities, wherein he sets us; so as we may most
promote the common good: Which study and duty we own in humanity, as men, and
more in charity, as Christians to any Church, or society of Christians; To whom
our counsel and power, or our consent and subjection, may add a further
authority, a more harmonious and efficacious influence, than can be from small
or ununited parcels: So that a National Church, that is, such a Society of
Christians, as are distinct by civil limits and relation, from other Nations,
may not only own, and accordingly act, as they are men related in things
civil; but also as Christians, they may own and wisely establish such a Church
power, relation, and association in matters of Religion, as may best preserve
themselves in true Doctrine, holy Order, Christian peace, and good manners by
joint counsel, and more vigorous power; The neerness which they have, affording
greater opportunities to impart, and enjoy the benefit of mutual counsel and
charity, and all other communicable abilities, to a nobler measure, and higher
proportion, than can be had in lesser bodies or combinations. This joint,
public, and united authortiy of any Church, in any Nation or Kingdom, is so
far from being slighted, as some capricious minds do, that it is the more to
be venerated and regarded by all good Christians; who know, that duty enlarges
with relations; and a greater charity is due from us to greater communities,
both of men, and of Christians.

Odia quo iniquiora eo magis a cerba. Tacit.
The greatest vexation of these new Modellers, is, That they have so little with
truth, modesty, or charity, to say against this famous National Church of
England, and its Ministry: For they daily see, notwithstanding all their
specious pretensions, and undefatigable agitations; the more, as winds, they
seek to shake and subvert well-rooted Christians; the more they are confirmed,
and settled in that Christian, communion, 9. Charity necessary in any true
Church and Christians. (...). Camer. de Melan.
which they have upon good grounds, both of Reason and Religion, Polity and
Charity, with this Church of England, as their Mother: Which blessing, all wise
Christians, and well ordered Churches, ever owned and enjoyed among themselves,
as parts of the Catholic, in their several distinctions and society.

In these points of the true Church, and true Religion (however I covet to be
short) yet I shall be most serious, and as clear as may be; writing nothing to
other men's Consciences, which I do not first read in mine own; and of which, I
know account must be given by me, at Christ's tribunal. And truly, I am as loath
to deceive others, as to err my self, in matters of so great concernment,
Nulla erroris secta sam contra Christi verit atem nist nomine cooperta
Christiano ad pugnandum prosilire audet. August. ep. 56.
as true Religion, and the true Church are: Both which, every Sect and Party of
Christians challenge to themselves; and those, no doubt, with most right and
truest comfort, who do it with most charity to any others, that have for the
foundation of their faith, the Scriptures, and the Sacraments for the seals,
and a true Ministry for the ordering and right dispensing of holy things;
professing such latitudes of charity always, as exclude no such Christians from
communion with them: (Notwithstanding, they have many and different
superstructures in lesser things.) Without this Christian charity, it is
evident, all ostentations of true Religion, of Churches purity, and of
Reformation, though accompanied with tongues, miracles, and martyrdoms, 1 Cor.
14.1, 3, etc.
are in vain, and profit men nothing.

As it is not enough to make men of the true Church, to say, They are the only
true Church, and in the only Church Way; or to censure, condemn, and exclude
all other Christians, who may be in the same pathway to Heaven, though the
paving be different; of grass, or gravel, or stone, etc. So it is enough, to
exclude any party, sect, or faction of seeming Christians, from being any sound
part of the true Church, to say, in a Schismatical pride, and uncharitable
severity, That they are the only true Church; Excidisti ab ecclesia, ubi a
charitate excideris; quum a Christo ipso inde excidisti. Aug.
(as the ringleaders of the Novatians and Donatists did;) excommunicating by
malicious, proud, and passionate principles; or in any other novelizing ways,
vexing and disturbing the quiet of those Christians, and Churches, who have the
true Means and Ministry; the true Grounds, and Seals of Faith; with other holy
and orderly Ministrations, though with some different rites, yet professing
holiness of life, and this, with Christian charity to all others; Col. 3.14.
which is the very bond of perfection: The want of which, cannot consist with
those other graces of true faith and love, repentance and humility, by which
men pretend to be united to Christ. The ready way, not to be any part or true
Member of the Catholic Church, is, Isai. 65.4. They eat abominable things; yet
they say, Stand by thy self, come not near me; for I am holier than thou. These
(says the Lord) are a smoke in my nose, and a fire that burns all the day.
To challenge to be the only true Church, and to separate from all others; both
by non-communion with them, and a total condemning or abdicating of them: As
the way for any branch to wither, and come to nothing, is, To break it self off
by a rude Schism, or violent fraction from the Tree, that it may have the glory
to grow by it self; and to say with a Pharisaick pride to all others, stand by,
I am holier than you; Thus parting from that Root and Body, Christ and the
Catholic Church; in the communion with which, by Truth and Charity, its Life
and Beauty did consist.

However then, the unholy love of novelty, proud curiosity, cold charity, and
distempered zeal of some men, dare cast off, unchurch, and anathematise, not
only single persons and private Congregations, but even greater associations
of Christians; bound together, by the bonds of civil, as well as Church
societies, in Nations and Kingdoms; yea, and to despise that Catholic form of
all the Churches in the World, 2 Cor. 10.12. They measuring themselves by
themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise.
of ancient, as well as present times: Yet this vain-glorying, through a
verbal, ignorant, proud, and uncharitable confidence of themselves, and
contempt of all others, seems to have more in it of Belial and Antichrist, than
of Jesus Christ; more of Lucifer, than of the Father of Lights; who also is the
Father of Love; who has therefore shined on men with the light of his grace,
and love of Christ, that he might lead them by this powerful pattern of divine
love, to love one another, as men and as Christians, with all meekness and
charity; with all good hope, forbearance and long-suffering; toward those,
especially, that profess to be of the household of faith; who hold the
foundation, Christ crucified; though they may have many additions of hay, 1
Cor. 3.15.
straw, and stubble; since, Those may save, though these suffer loss. God will
easily discern between his gold, and our dross, between the errors rising from
simplicity, and the truths joined with charity, and humility; He will easily
distinguish between the humble ignorance of many upright-hearted Christians,
who are seduced to wanderings; and the subtilty, pride, or malice, of
Arch-hereticks and Schismatics, who seduce others for sinister ends.

All wise, humble, and charitable Christians, should so order their judgments,
and censures, if at any time they are forced to declare them, that they must
above all things take heed, that they nourish not, nor discover any
uncharitable fewds, or distances, and, antipathies, against any Churches or
Christians, after the rate of those passions, which are the common source both
of Schisms and Heresies; whose ignorance and pride, like water and ice,
mutually arise from, and are resolved into each other: Therefore proud, because
ignorant; and the more ignorant, because so proud. Nor yet may they follow
those defiances and distances in Religion, Tantum distat a vera charitate
quorundam zetotarum praeceps and intemperatus ^^d^, quantum maligna
sebricitantium flam^ae a native and vitali corporis calore. Cas.
which Reason of State, or the Interests of Princes, or Power of Civil
Factions, or the Popular fierceness of some Ministers, and eager Sticklers for
sides and parties, do nourish; and vulgarly commend, as high expressions of
zeal, and the only ways of true Religion; Where there is scarce one drop of
charity in a sea of controversy, or one star of necessary truth in the whole
clouded Heaven of their differing opinions and ways; which set men as far from
true Christian temper, as burning Fevers do from native heat, and health.

10. Extremes touching the Church.
I know no point has used more liberal and excellent Pens, than this,
concerning the true Church, as it is visible, or professional before men; which
is the proper subject of this dispute. Some men's Pens flow with too much gall
and bitterness; as the rigid Papists on the one side; and the keener Separatist
on the other: Denying any to be in a right Church Way, save only such, as are
just in their particular mold and form: Either joined in communion with the
Roman profession, and being subject to its head, the Pope; pleading antiquity,
unity, universality, visibility, etc. or else embodied with those new and
smaller Incorporations, which count themselves the only true, and properly so
called Churches; pretending more absolute Church Power, more exact
constitution, and more complete Scripture-Reformation, than any ancient,
National, dilated, and confederated Churches could, or ever did attain too.

Herein, there is a strong excess on both sides, 1. By the Romanists. Baron.

both Papal and Popular: First, The Romanists extend the cords of their
Churches power, and its head or chief Bishop, so far, as if it were properly
Catholic, and Ecumenical; that is, by divine appointment invested with
sovereign Authority, to extend and exercise Ecclesiastical polity and dominion
over all other particular Churches, in all ages, and in all parts of the World:
So that it is (say they) necessary to salvation to be under this Roman
jurisdiction, etc. Whereas it is certain, That the Roman Church, anciently was,
and still is (properly speaking) distinct from others in place, as well as
name, and had anciently its limited power, and jurisdiction, extending to the
suburbicanian Provinces; which were Ten, seven in Italy, and three in Sicily,
Corsica, and Sardinia: Acco^ding to those (like) bounds, which occasionally
from civil titles, both named and distinguished all other Churches from one
another; in both the Asiaes, in Africa, and in Europe; as the Gallican, German,
British, etc. Nor has ever any thing, either of Reason, or Scripture, been
produced by any (more than of true Antiquity) whereby to prove, That we are
bound to any communion (that is, (in the true meaning of proud and politic
Romanists) to that subjection to the Pope, and his party; which may be most for
his and their honor and profit) with the Church of Rome, further, than the rule
of Christian charity obliges every Christian, and every part of the Catholic
Church, to communicate in truth and love, with all those, that in any judgment
of charity, are to be counted true Christians, so far, as they appear to us, to
be such.

Nor is it less evident, That many Churches and Christians have scarce ever
known, much less owned, any claim of subjection upon them, by the Roman Church:
Which, however they had anciently a priority of order and precedence, yielded
to it, and its chief Bishop, for the eminency of the City, the honor of the
Empire, and the excellency of the reputed Founders and Planters, Saint Peter,
and Saint Paul; also for the renown of the faith, patience, and charity of that
Church, which was famous in all the World; Yet, Romans 1.^.
all this Primacy or Priority of Order, which was civilly by others granted,
and might modestly be accepted by the chief Bishop in the Roman Province, as to
matter of place and precedence, or Votes in public Counscis and Synods: This,
I say, is very far from that Greg. Mag. ep. 30. ad Mauri. Aug. Fidenter dico,

and superbia typhum affectante. Greg. M. l 4. ep. 32, 36.
Antichristian Supremacy of usurped power, tyrannick dominion, and arbitrary
jurisdiction; the very suspicion and temptation to which, the holy and humble
Bishops of Rome were ever jealous of, and avoided; especially Gregory the
Great; who was in nothing more worthy of that title, than in this, That he so
greatly detested, protested against, and refused the title of Universal Bishop,
when it was offered to him by the Council of Chalcedon: Which both name and
thing was in after times gained and challenged by the pride, policy,
covetousness, and ambition, of those Bishops of Rome, who by some of their own
sides confession (as Baronius, an. 912. tom. 10. Foedissima nunc Romanae
ecclesia facies, cum Romae dominarentur potentissima ac sordidissima mer^^rices.
Baronius, See Genebrard. ad Sec. 10. Pontifices per an. 150. a virtute majorum
prorsus desecerunt.
Genebrard, and others) were sufficiently degenerated from that Primitive
humility and sanctity, which were eminent in the first Bishops of Rome, in
those purer and primitive times; who never thought of any one of those Three
Crowns, which flatterers in after ages have fully hammered, and set on the
heads of the Bishops of Rome; in a Supremacy, not of Order, but of Power, and
plenary Jurisdiction, above all Christians, or Churches, or Councils in the
Christian World; which has justly occasioned so many parts of the Catholic
Church, in that regard, to make a necessary separation (not from any thing that
is Christian among them, but) from the usurpation, tyranny, and superstition of
those bishops of the Roman Church, and their Faction, who unjustly claim, and
rigorously exercise dominion over the Consciences and Liberties of all other
Churches, and Christians: With whom, the Roman pride now refuses to hold such
peaceable communion, as ought universally to be among Christians, (in respect
of order and charity) unless they will all submit to that tyranny and
usurpation, which has nothing in it, but secular pride, vain pomp, and worldly
dominion: Yet still those of the Roman Church know, That all the Reformed
Churches, as well as we of England, ever did, and do hold, a Christian
communion in charity with them, so far, as by the Word of God we conceive they
hold with the head or root of the Church, Christ Jesus; with the ground and
rule of Faith, the Scriptures; and with all those holy Professors, in the
purest and primitive Churches: Of whose faith, lives, and deaths, having some
Monuments left us, by the writings of eminent Bishops, and others; we judge,
what was the tenor both of the Faith, Manners, and Charity of those purer times,
which we highly venerate, and strive to imitate.

Possibly we might now subscribe to that Letter, which the Abbot and Monks of
Bangor sent to Austin, (whom some report to be a proud and bloody Monk) when he
came to this Nation, and required obedience of them, and all Christians here,
to the Pope; (which Letter is thus translated out of Saxonick, by that grave
and learned Gentleman, Sir Henry Spelman, Sir Henry Spelman, Council. Brit. Anno
Christi 590. out of the Saxon Manuscript.
a lover and adorner of this Church of England, by his life and learned
Labors.) Be it known to you, without doubt, that every one of us are obedient,
and subject to the Church of God, and to the Pope of Rome, and to every true
godly Christian; to love every one in his degree, in perfect charity; and to
help every one of them, by word and deed, to be the children of God; and other
obedience, than this, we know not due to him, whom you call Pope; nor do we own
him to be Father of Fathers. Isca, one of the three Metropolis in Britain.
Caerusk, in Monmouthshire, Antiq. Brit.
This obedience we are ever ready to give, and pay to him, and every Christian,
continually: Beside we are under our own Bishop of Caerleon upon Usk, who is to
oversee us under God, and to cause us to keep the way spiritual.

Nor will this benefit of the Popes pretended Infallibility, 11. The pretended
Infallibility in the Pope or Church of Rome. Primatum suum non objecit Petrus,
nec inerrabilitatem, sed Paulo veritatis assertori cesset: Documentum
patientiae and concordiae. Cyp. ep. 71.
(for deciding controversies of Religion, and ending all Disputes of Faith, in
the Church Catholic) countervail the injury of this his usurpation, and
oppression: Considering, that nothing is more, by Scripture, Reason, and
Experience, not so much disputable, as fully to be denied by any sober
Christians, than that of the Popes Infallibility; which, as the Church never ye
enjoyed; so, nor does any Church, or any Christian indeed want any such thing
as this infallible judge is imagined to be; in order to either Christian
course, or comfort: If indeed, the Bishop of Rome, and those learned men about
him, would, without faction, flattery, partiality, and self-interest, join
their learning, counsels, and endeavors, in common, to reform the abuses, to
compose the rents and differences in the Christian World, by the rule of
Scripture, and right Reason, with Christian humility, prudence, and charity,
(which look sincerely to a public and common good) they would do more good for
the Churches of Christ, than any imaginary Infallibility will ever do; yea, and
they would do themselves no great hurt in civil respects; if they could meet
and join, not with envious and covetous, but liberal and ingenuous Reformers;
who will not think as many, the greatest deformities of any Church, to be the
riches, and revenues of Churchmen.

Certainly, in points of true Religion, to be believed, or duties to be
practiced, as from divine command, every Christian is to be judge of that,
which is propounded to him, and embraced by him; according to what he is
rationally and morally able to know and attain; by those means which God has
given him, of Reason, Scripture, Ministry, and good examples: Of all which, the
gifts or graces of God in him, have enabled him seriously and discreetly to
consider. Nor is he to rest in, either implicit, or explicit dictates,
presumptions, and Magisterial determinations of any frail, and sinful men, who
may be as fallible, Magnum ingenium magna tentatio. De Orig. and Tert. Vin.
Lirin. 1 Cor. 8.7. Knowledge puffs up. 2 Pet. 2.19. (...). Romans 6.17. Ye have

as himself: For, whereas they may exceed him in gifts of knowledge, they may
also exceed him in passions, self-interests, pride, and policy; so that he may
not safely trust them on their bare word, and assertion; but he must seek to
build his faith on the more sure Word of God, which is acknowledged (by all
sides) to be the surest director, what to believe, to do, and to hope in the
way of Religion. Nor may any private Christians unletteredness, that cannot
read; or his weaker intellect, that cannot reason and dispute; or his many
incumberances of life, that deny him leisure to read, study, compare, meditate,
etc. These may not discourage him, as if he were a dry tree, and could neither
bear, nor reap any fruit of Christian Religion, because he has no infallible
guide, or judge: Since the mercy of God accepts earnest endeavors, and an holy
life, according to the power, capacy, and means a man has; also he pardons
unwilling errors, when there is an obedience from the heart, to the truths we
know; and a love to all truth, joined with humility, and charity.

In order therefore to relieve the common defects of men, as to the generality
of them, both in Cities and in Country Villages (where there is little
learning by the Book, or Letter; and great dullness with heavy labor) the Lord
of his wisdom and mercy has appoint d that constant holy order of the
Ministry, to be always continued in the Church; that so learned, studious, and
able men, being duly tried, approved, and ordained to be Teachers and Pastors;
may by their light, knowledge, and plenty, supply the darkness, simplicity, and
penury of common people; who must every man be fully persuaded in his own
mind, Romans 14.5. in matters of conscience; and be able to give a reason of
that faith and hope which is in him, beyond the credit of any mere man, or the
opinion of his infallibility, 1 Pet. 3.15.

However they may with comfort and confidence attend upon their lips, whom in
an holy succession of Ministry, God has given to them, as the ordinary and
sufficient means of Faith; And however a plain-hearted and simple Christian may
religiously wait upon, and rest satisfied with those holy means and mysteries,
which are so dispensed to him by true Ministers, (who ought above all, to be
both able and faithful; to know, and to make known the truth, as it is in
Jesus;) Yet, may he not savingly, or conscientiously rely, in matters of
Faith, nor make his last result upon the bare credit, or personal veracity of
the Minister; but he must consider and believe every truth, not because the
Minister says it, but because it is grounded on the Word of God; and from
thence brought him by his Minister; which doctrine he judges to be true, not
upon the infallibility of any Teachers; but upon that certainty which he
believes to be in the Scripture; to which, all sorts of Christians do consent;
And to which, the Grace and Spirit of God so draws and enclineth the heart,
as to close with those divine truths, to believe and obey them; not for the
authority of the Minister, but of God the Revealer; whose excellent wisdom,
truth, and love, it discerns in those things which are taught it by the
Ministry of man. So that, still the simplest Christian does savingly believe,
and conscientiously live, according to what himself judges, and is persuaded
in his heart, to be the Will of God, in his Word; and not after the dictates of
any man: Which either written, or spoken, have no more authority to command or
persuade belief, as to Religion, than they appear to the believer, (and not to
the speaker only) grounded on the sure Word of God, and to be his mind and
will to mankind.

And as it is not absolutely necessary to every Christian, in order to Faith
and Salvation, to be able with his own eyes to read, and so to judge of the
Letter of the Scripture; so it is the more necessary, that the reading and
preaching of the Word should be committed to able and faithful men; not, who
are infallible, 2 Timothy 2.2. (...).
but who may be apt to teach, and worthy to be believed: Of whom, the people
may have great persuasion, both as to their abilities, and due authority, to
teach and guide them in the ways of God. We read in Irenaeus, Irenaeus, l. 3.
c. 4.
that in One hundred and fifty years after Christ, many Churches of Christians,
toward the Caspian Sea, and Eastward, were very sound in the Faith, and settled
against all Heretical or Schismatical insinuations; when yet they never had any
Bibles or Scriptures among them; but only retained that Faith which they at
first had learned, and were still taught by their Orthodox Bishops, and
Ministers; which they never wanted in a due succession: Of whose piety,
honesty, and charity, they were so assured, as diligently to attend their
doctrine, and holy ministrations; with which the blessing of God (opening their
hearts, as Lydia's) still went along; so as to keep them in true faith, love,
and holy obedience.

Since then, no man or men can give to others, any such sure proofs, and good
grounds of their personal infallibility, as the Scriptures have in themselves,
both by that more than humane luster of divine truths in it; which set forth
most excellent precepts, paterns, and promises; excellent morals and mysteries;
excellent rules, examples, and rewards, beyond any Book whatsoever: Also, from
that general credit, regard, and reception, which they have, and ever had with
all (and most with the best) Christians, in all ages; as the Oracles of God,
delivered by holy and honest men; for a rule of faith, and holy life; also for
a ground of eternal hope: Since that from hence only, even the Pope, or any
others, that pretend to any infallibility, or inspirations, do first seek to
ground those their pretensions, of which, every one that will be persuaded,
must first be judge of the reasons or grounds alleged to persuade him; It is
necessary, that the ((...)) infallibility of the Scriptures, must be first
received, and believed by every Christian; in order to his being assured of any
truth, which thence is urged upon him to believe, or do: Which great principle
settling a believer on the certainty or infallibility of the Scriptures, as a
divine rule of Faith and Life, is never to be gained upon any men's judgments
and persuasion (be they either idiotick or learned) unless there be such an
authoritative Ministry, and such Ministers to preach, interpret, open, and
apply the Scriptures, by strong and convincing demonstrations, which may carry
credit and power with them. The succession then of rightly ordained Ministers
is more necessary to the Church, than any such Papal infallibility; in as much,
as it is more necessary to believe the Scriptures authority, than any man's
testimony, which has no credit but from the Scripture: Which while the Pope,
or others, do seek to wrest to their own secular advantages and ends, they
bring men at length to regard nothing they say; nor at all to consider, what
they endlesly wrangle, and groundlesly dispute about true Religion, or the true
Church.

12. An able and right Ministry, is beyond any pretended Infallibility.
So absolutely necessary and sufficient in the way of ordinary means, is a right
and duly ordained Ministry, which Christ has appointed to continue, and
propagate true Christian Religion; which ever builds true Faith, and the true
Church upon the Scriptures; That, as there is no infallibility of the Pope, or
other man, evident by any Reason, Scripture, or Experience, so there needs
none, to carry on that great work of men's salvation; which will then fail in
any Church and Nation, when the right Ministry fails, by force or fraud: If we
can keep our true Christian Ministry, and holy Ministrations, we need not ask
the Romanists, or any other arrogant Monopolizers of the Church, leave to own
our selves true Christians, and a part of the true Catholic Church of Christ;
which cannot be but there, where there is a profession of the Christian
Religion, as to the main of it; in its Truths, Sacraments, holy Ministrations
and Ministry, rightly ordained; both for the ability of the ordained, and the
authority of the ordainers; although all should be accompanied with some humane
failings.

Where the now Roman Church then, does (as we conceive) either in their
doctrine, or practice, vary from that Catholikely received rule the Scriptures,
which are the only infallible, certain, and clear guide in things fundamental;
as to faith, or manners; we are forced so far, justly and necessarily to leave
them, and their infallible fallibility in both; yet charitably still, so as to
pity their errors; to pray for their enlightening, their repentance and pardon,
which we hope for: Where no malice or corrupt lusts makes the additional errors
pernicious; and where the love of truth makes them pardonable, by their
conscientious obeying what they know, and desire to know, what they are yet
ignorant of. Yea, and wherein they are conform to any Scriptures, doctrine, and
practice; or right reason, good order, and prudent polity; there, we willingly
run parallel with, and agreeable to them, both in opinion and practice: For we
think we ought not in a heady, and passionate way, wholly to separate from any
Church, or cast away any branch of it, that yet visibly professes Christian
Religion; further, than it rends and breaks it self off from the Word,
Institution, and pattern of Christ, in the Scriptures; and so either separates
it self from us, or casts us out from it, uncharitably violating that Catholic
communion of Christ's Church, which ought to be preserved with all possible
charity. The constancy and fidelity of the Church of Christ is more remarkable
in its true Ministry, holding forth in an holy succession the most Catholic
and credible truth of the Scriptures; which at once shows both the innate
divine light in them; and the true Church also, which is built by them, and
upon them. The truth of which Scriptures, while we with charity, believe and
profess, both in word and deed, we take it to be, the surest and sufficientest
evidence to prove, That we are a part of the true Church, against the cavils
and calumnies of those learneder Romanists; upon whose Anvils, others of far
weaker arms, have learned to forge the like fiery darts against this Church of
England.

For, on the other side, the new Models of Independent, 13. The contrary
extreme reducing all Churches to small and single Congregations.
or Congregational Churches, (which seem like small Chapels of Ease, set up to
confront and rob the Mother Churches of Auditors, Communicants, Maintenance,
and Ministry) wind up the cords, and fold up the curtains of the true Church,
too short, and too narrow; Shrinking that Christian communion, and visible
polity, or society of the Church, to such small figures, such short and broken
ends, of obscure conventicles, and paucities, that by their rigid separatings,
some men scarce allow the whole company of true Christians, in all the world,
to be so great, as would fill one Jewish Synagogue: Fancying, that no Church or
Christian, is sufficiently reformed, till they are most diametrically contrary
in every use and custom to the Roman fashion; abhorring many things as Popish,
(...) Naz. In vitium ducit culpae fugasi caret art. Hor.
and Superstitious, because used by the Papists: When indeed, they are either
pious, or very prudential; yea, many count it a special mark of their true
Churchship, to separate from all, to cry down every thing, to rail at, and
despise (with as little charity, as much passion, and no reason) all Churches
and Christians, as Antichristian, and not yet sufficiently reformed, which are
not of their new Bodying, and Independent fashion.

Which novel practices seem nothing else, but the effects, either of secular
polity, or prejudicating and preposterous zeal; by which, some men, for their
interest, or their humor, seek to bring back the Churches of Christ, to that
Egypt and Babylon of strife, schism, emulation, sedition, faction, and
confusion, to which they were running very early, St. Paul, 1 Cor. c. 3. Clem.
ad Cor. epist. Thirty years after. Postquam unusquisque eos quos baptisaverat

as the Apostle Paul tells us; and St. Clemens in his Epistle to the
Corinthians: From the rocks of which inconveniences, Saint Jerome by express
words, and all Churches, by their ancient Catholic practices, do assure us,
That the wisdom of the Apostles, and Apostolike-men in the Primitive times,
even from St. Mark in Alexandria, and St. James in Jerusalem, redeemed and
brought the Church; by settling those large and public combinations, by
Episcopal Government; and in ways of ampliated communion, and Catholic
correspondencies (as much as might be) by Synods and General Councils; which
might best keep particular Congregations, from scattering and crumbling
themselves into such Factions and Schisms; which all wisdom foresaw, and
experience fulfilled, would be the only means, First, to break the bond of
Christian charity, and the Churches communion (which consisted much, as in the
verity of the Faith, so in those larger fraternities, holy confederacies, and
orderly subjections,) and afterward to overthrow the very foundations of Faith
and Truth: As those every where did, who at any time corrupted any part of the
Church, affecting singularities, and chosing rather to fall, by standing alone
in a separation of Opinion or Government, than to seem to have any support by
the association with others, in a more public way of common relation, unity,
and subjection: Which undoubtedly carry the greatest strength and safety with
them, both in Ecclesiastical, and Civil polities; twisting many smaller strings
into one cord, and many cords into one cable; which will best preserve the Ship
of the Church, as well as the State, from those storms and distresses, which
are prone to fall upon it, in lesser bottoms. The good effects of which larger
communion among men, and Christians, all reason and experience demonstrate to
us in civil societies, which are the conservatories of mankind, by way of
mutual assistance in public combinations; while single persons, which alone
are feeble, and exposed to injuries, grow strong by making one family, and many
families grow into a Village, Town, or City: Many Villages, Towns, and Cities,
arise to one potent Principality or Commonwealth; which as a threefold cord, is
not easily broken.

It is in all Church Histories most evident, That, as soon as the Gospel spread
from Cities, where it was generally first planted (there being the greatest
conflux of people) and from thence derived to the Territories, and Countries
adjacent, which were called the several ((...) or (...)) Parishes or Diocesses:
So, those Christians, which grew up in the Countries and Territories about, to
small Congregations, continued still in a fraternal subjection, and a filial
submission, both Presbyters and People, to that Bishop and Presbytery, which
were in the Mother City; who, there residing, (where the Apostles or
Apostolike-men had placed them) took care so to spread the Gospel to the
Countries about, as to preserve Religion once planted, in peace, unity, and
order. Nor did those particular Congregations in Cities or Vi^lages, turn
presently Acepalists or Independents; nor set up any ((...)) heady or headless
bodies, in every corner and meeting place: For, however Christians in some
places, might at first amount to but so small a number, as would make but one
convenient Society, or Congregation, under one Bishop, or Presbyter, with the
Deacons; and so might for a time continue in private bounds, not corresponding
with, or depending on any other company of Christians, as to lesser
concernments, which might easily be managed among them: Yet, where the number
of believers increased, as in Antioch, Jerusalem, Ephesus, Corinth, Rome, etc.
both in the Cities, and their Territories, all Histories of the Church a ver;
That, as by those dictates of religious Reason, which first guided the Apostles
or Apostolike-men, to cast themselves and believers, into such lesser bodies,
and distinct societies, as might best serve for the convenience of meeting
together in one place, according as neighborhood invited them: So still (as
growing parts of the same body, and increasing branches of the same Tree) they
preserved the first, great, and common relation, of descent and extraction,
from the Mother City; So as to correspond with, to watch over each other; yea,
and to be subject (in every particular Congregation, as well as families) to
those, who were the original of their instruction and conversion; and who by a
kind of paternal right, together with Apostolical appointment, and common
consent of Christians, had the chief power and authority for Inspection and
Government over them, within such precincts and bounds; yea, all Christians
were thus subjected, and united in greater and diffused Churches, not by any
civil necessity; such as compels men by the sword and force; but by that
necessity of gratitude, sense of priority, prudence and charity; which bound by
love, humility, and wisdom, particular Christians first to one Society or
Convention: And these particular Congregations to greater fraternities; and
these to a more ample and Catholic communion; for the mutual peace, and good
order of the whole Church of Christ; which sought to preserve it self, even in
the eye of the world, as one entire body, under one head, Christ Jesus. 1 Cor.
12.25, etc. Ephesians. 4.4, etc.


So that the imaginary pdtern in the Mount, the primitive practice which some
men love to talk of (by which they would force all large and ampliated
Churches, (which have now received (as they did at first) distinctions and
denominations by the Cities, Civil Jurisdictions, Kingdoms, or Nations, wherein
they are) to those lesser Forms, wherein they fancy (and not unlikely) a single
Congregation of Christians, in any place, at first enjoyed themselves under
some Apostle, or one of Apostolic appointment, who was their Bishop or
Overseer over them,) This, I say, seems to be so childish a fancy, so weak, and
unreasonable an imagination, That it is all one, as if they would needs reduce
themselves to their infant coats, now they are grown men.

And what I pray does hinder (save only the novel opinions and humors of these
men,) that, Christian Religion (which sanctifies reason, to serve God and the
Church, in all comely ways) may not use those principles and rules, for order,
unity, peace, and mutual safety of Christians, in their multiplied numbers and
societies; which we are taught, and allowed to use in all civil associations?
Yea, and not only allowed, but enjoined to observe in Ecclesiastical polity
and Government, by that great and fundamental Canon of the Apostle, 1 Cor.
14.40.
Let all things be done decently, and in order; which must hold, not only in
private and lesser parcels, but in the more large and integral parts of the
Church of Christ.

But Reason then, and Religion sufficiently discover, the vanity and
impertinency of those novel fancies, which are obtruded, as necessary for all
private Congregations; when indeed they are, and ever have been, and will be
destructive to the more public and general good of the Church; whose
tranquillity, honor, and safety, consists in such dependencies and
subordinations, which may be furthest remote from those fractions and
disunions, which arise from that Church-dividing and Charity-destroying
principle of Independent Congregations; Romans 16.5. Greet the Church, which is
in their house. 1 Cor. 16.19. The Churches of Asia salute y^u.
which was never used in any times of the Church, further than the minority and
infancy of the first planting; while either Christians were not increased much
in number, or not enlarged in place: But when the first small company of
believers multiplied from a Church in one Family, to a Church in many
Congregations, (which could not now with convenience all meet together in one
place,) they yet as branches, still continued both united to the root, Christ
Jesus; 14. The Church of England, not blamable for its National communion.
and also to the main body and bulk of the visible Church, by union to that
part whence they descended, and to which they related; and they were not as
Colonies or Slips, so transplanted and separated, as to grow Independently of
themselves, apart from all others: Of which, there is no example in Scripture
or Antiquity.

It follows then, That what was settled in this or other like Christian
Churches, was no whit blamable, as any thing of mere humane invention, or any
superfluous and corrupt addition to any precept, pattern, or constitution,
either of Christ's or the Apostles; who never prohibited the ordering of
Churches in larger associations or Governments; extending to Cities, and their
Territories, to great Diocesses, Provinces, and Nations; Since there is no
precept or practice, limiting Churches power, and society, to private and
single Congregations: Yea, there are such general directions, and examples in
the Scripture, as command, or at least commend rather than condemn those
analogous or proportionable applyings of all orderly and prudential means for
union and communion, according as the various state, and times of the Church
may require; which still aim at the same end, the peace and welfare of the
Church, both in the lesser and the larger extents; which are justly so carried
on by the wise Governors and Protectors of the Church, according to the general
principles and rules, or paterns of pious and charitable prudence, set down in
the Scriptures; beyond which, in this case of the Churches outward order and
polity, there neither is, nor needs, other directions; no more, than on what
Text and Subject; or in what method and place; or how long time, and how often
a Minister must pray, or preach; and people must hear Sermons, or attend holy
duties.

That ancient and excellent frame then, of this Church in England, which in a
National union, by civil, religious, and sacred bonds, was so wisely built, and
for many ages compacted together, and which has been lately so undermined, so
hackt and hewn, with passionate writings, and disputings, and actings, that it
is become not only a tottering, but almost a quite demolished and overthrown
frame; This Church, I say, has suffered this hard fate, rather through the
iniquities of times, malice of men, and just judgments of God on the Governors
and governed, (who we may fear improved not so great advantages of union,
order, power, peace, and protection, to the real good of the Church, and
furtherance of the Gospel) rather, I say, by these personal failings, than for
any, either mischief, deformity, defects, or Antichristian excess in the way
and frame it self, as to its grounds and constitutions: Which were settled and
long approved by very wise, holy, and learned men; carrying with them, (as
much, as any Christian, or Reformed Church did) the lineaments, feature, beauty
and vigor, of those famous Primitive Churches; which in the midst of heresies
and persecutions kept themselves safe, as to truth and charity, not by the
shreds of Independent Bodies, but by the sutures of Christian Associations; in
Provincial, National, and Ecumenical enlargements: Such ample and noble
platforms of religious reason, and sanctified wisdom, as not ambitious policy,
but Christian charity, and prudent humility, embraced; which, as our new models
and projections will never mend, so they much commend those ancient happy
models, and paterns, by those multiplied mischiefs ensuing inevitably upon the
presumptions of posterity; which have rashly adventured thus to remove and
change the ancient limits, marks, and orders of the Church, which Primitive
Fathers and Apostles had recommended and settled.

Which temerity of thus mincing and crumbling, or tearing any Church National
(being the issue of no Synod, or Council in the Church, but only of private
fancies, and most-what mechanic adventures) has, we see, made some poor souls
turn Scepticks and Seekers after true Religion, and a true Church; being wholly
unsatisfied, either with the abolition of the old way, or the various
inventions of new ways. These profess, whether out of weakness, pure ignorance,
passion, or policy (God knows,) That they are Christians no further, than to
see, that all Christian Churches are now, and have been, ever since the
Apostles times, adulterous, impure, deformed, and Antichristian; That, they are
wholly to seek for any true ground, or way of Christian Religion, Church, and
Ministry, even among so many Christians, Ministers, and Churches: That is, they
cannot see wood for trees, nor light for the Sun at noonday. And this may
easily be, either by reason of wilful blindness, or for want of that charity
and humility, which keeps the hearts and eyes of Christians, open and clear; or
from that darkness, and blear-eyedness, which prejudice and perverseness carry
with them; hindering Christians from discerning even those objects, that are
round about them; yea, it is to be feared, That some men, from Atheistical,
profane, ranting, and licentious principles, seek for a true Church, as
Hypocrites do for their sins, and cowards for their enemies, loath to find
them, and studying most to be hidden from them. They complain of this, and
other Churches, as defective, as impure, as none; when indeed, it may be
feared, they are sorry there are any such; and wish there were none of these
Christian societies, Ministers, or godly people, in the world; whose doctrine
and examples are their restraints, reproaches, and torments; being most cross
to their evil designs, and immoderate lusts. They complain they cannot find a
true Church, when they are unwilling so to do; and satisfy themselves (as the
Cynick in his Tub) morosely to censure, and Magisterially to find fault with
all Christians, that they may conform to none in an holy, humble, and peaceably
way; but rather enjoy that fantastic and lazy liberty of mocking God, and man;
till they find such a way of Church and Religion, as shall please them: Which
they would not be long in finding, as to extern polity and profession, if they
did but entertain that inward life, and power of Religion, which I formerly set
down; which, by a principle of charity, as well as of truth, strongly flowing
from belief of Gods love in Christ to mankind, and specially to the Church;
does powerfully bind, and cheerfully incline every humble believer, 1 Cor.
14.33 God is not the Author ((...)) of unsetledness, commotion, or confusion,
but of peace, as in all Churches of the Saints. Heb. 12.14. Follow peace with
all men, and holiness, etc. Romans 12.18. If it be possible, as much as lies in
you, live peaceably with all men.
to have peace and communion (as much as may be) with all Christians; as
internal, in judgment and good will, so external and social; both private and
public; amicitial and political, in regard of example, comfort, and
encouragement; as also of Order, Subordination, and Government; so far, as we
see they have any fellowship with Christ Jesus, in those holy mysteries and
duties, which he has appointed; whereby to gather and preserve his Church, in
all Ages, and places, and Nations.

Thus we see some men's Pens serve only to blot the face, even of the Catholic
Church, and all parts of it in their visible order and communion; affecting to
write such blind and small Characters, in describing new Church ways, and
forms of Religion, that no ordinary eyes can read their meaning, either in
their shrinking and separating into small ruptures of Bodies; when they were
related to, and combined with, Churches large and settled; or in their Seraphick
raptures, strange Enthusiasms, secret drawings, and extraordinary impulsions,
which they pretend to have in their ways, above, and without; yea, in the
neglect, and contempt of all ordinary means, and settled Ministry in any Church:
Their many high imaginations, and fanatic fancies, are (no doubt) above their
Authors own understandings, no less than above all wiser, and soberer men's
capacities; twinkling much more like gloworms, under the hedges of private
Conventicles, and Factions; than shining with true and ancient light of the
judgment or practice of any Churches. Therefore they need no further
confutation from my Pen, having so little, yea, no confirmation, from any
grounds of Scripture, or arguments of common Reason, or custom of Christians;
nothing indeed worthy of any rational, godly, and serious man's thoughts; who
list not to dance after the Jews-trump, or Oaten-pipe of every Country fancy,
rather than listen to the best touched Lute, or Theorbo,

These Sirens, wise Christians may leave to sing to themselves, and their own
melancholy, or musing thoughts; no sober-man can understand them, further than
they signify, that ignorance, illiterateness, idleness, pride, presumption,
licentiousness, and vanity; which some like spiritual Canters affect. The
rarities which they boast to enjoy, are without any discreet man's envy, that I
know: However, they carry it with a kind of scornful indignation against
others; every where pitying (as they say) the simple diligence, and needless
industry of those poor Christians, who are still attending on those threadbare
forms (as they call them) of old readings, and catechisings, and preachings,
and prayings, and Sacraments, etc. in the public Liturgies, and orderly
assemblies of Christians: Despising as much the ancient and true way of
Ministry and Duty, as they would the moldy bread, and torn bottles of the
Gibeonites; abhorring to own any relation to other Christians, or Church, or
Ministry, or Governors, in any Catholic bond of communion and subjection; nor
can they endure any Christian subordination, or prudent, and necessary
restraint of just Government.

Which makes them look very like the old Circumcelliones, a company of vagrant
Hypocrites; of whom, Saint Jerome, and Isidore Hispalensis, make large and
satirical descriptions: The first says, they were impudent straglers, whose
mouths were always full of barbarous and importune reproaches; The other tells
us, that they every where wandered in their mercenary hypocrisy, fixed no
where; feigning visions of what they never saw: Counting their opinions and
dreams for divine; and protesting to have received those eminencies, which they
have not: Impatient to be confined to any place, order, or way; but had rather
like vagabonds continue in their beggarly liberty, than fix to a sober
industry, and enjoy a settled competency.

2 Pet. 2.14. Beguiling unstable souls.
These unstable spirits, who turn round, till they are giddy, and fall from all
truth and charity, into all error and faction; who shut their eyes, that they
may say, they grop in the dark; and complain of all men's blindness, but their
own; These (I say) have of all others, least cause to blame the Religion, and
Ministry of the Church of England; since they own themselves to be in no
Church Way: Which, of all sides, is most blamed and condemned, and so need not
to be confuted any more.

16. Several quarrels against the Church of Englands frame.
Some others there are, who flatter themselves to be less mad than these seeking
fellows; who glory most in this, That they have broken all the former cords,
and shaken off all bonds, of any National Government, Order, and Discipline,
whereby they were formerly restrained in this Church: Which, first, they deny
to be any Church, purely, and properly so called; or in any way and frame of
Christ's institution; but only such an establishment as arises from mere civil
polity, and humane constitution. Secondly, These charge us, that we fail in the
matter of a Church, the faithful and holy. Thirdly, In the essential Form, an
explicit Covenant, or Church agreement to serve the Lord in such a way.
Fourthly and lastly, In our choosing, ordaining, and appointing Ministers, and
other Church Officers: In whom (they say) Church power is only executively,
(as to the exercise or dispensation) but it is primarily and eminently in that
Body of the people, never so small, which is so combined together: Yea, they
complain, that we in England have neglected, and deprived the people of that
glorious power and liberty, by which, every Christian is to show himself, both
King, and Priest, and Prophet.

Thus the Tabernacles of Edom, and the Ismalites; Psalm. 83.6, 7, 8. Nunquam
deorunt hosts ubi adest ecclesia, nec inimici ubi veritas ag^^scitur. Tert.
of Moab and the Hagarenes; Gebal, and Ammon, and Ammaleok; the Philistims, and
they of Tire, Assure also, Men of our own Tribes, all conspire against the true
Religion, the ancient orders, and holy Ministry of the Church of England: And
finding this Church forely torn, bruised, and wounded, they either leave it,
and its Ministry, to die desolate, by separating wholly from them; or else they
seek by their several instruments of death, wholly to dispatch it, as the
Amalekites did King Saul; But blessed be God, though this Church, and its true
Ministers, be thus afflicted and persecuted, yet are they not quite forsaken of
God, or of all good Christians; 2 Cor. 4.8, 9.
Though we be cast down, yet we are not quite destroyed. There want not many
sons of Sion, to mourn with their Mother, and to comfort her, if they cannot
contend for her, Although, the Lord is righteous, Lam. 1.2. Isai. 30.19.
who has smitten us, and to whom we will return, and wait till he be gracious
to this Church: Yet these sons of Edom, our unnatural Brethren, Micah 7.8, 9,
19.
are very injurious and uncharitable; who seek to inflame the wrath of God more
against her; rejoicing in her calamities, and crying, now she is fallen, let her
rise up no more. But the Lord will remember his compassions of old, which have
not failed, and will return to build her up; nor shall this furnace of
affliction be, to consume this Reformed Church, but only to purge her from
that dross, which she had any way contracted.

As to these men's first quarrel, 17. Of Religion as established and protected
by Laws in England.
against the frame of our Church and Ministry, as settled and defended by Civil
Laws and Politic Constitutions; They seem in this, rather offended at the
clothes and dress, or the defense and guard, than at the body and substance of
the Church: Possibly, they are angry that they had not power or permission,
sooner to deform and destroy that flourishing polity of this Church, which by
the princely piety of nursing fathers and mothers, has been so long preserved
to the envy of enemies, and admiration of friends. We never thought, that any
civil sanctions (which were in favor of our Reformed Church, Religion, and
Ministry) ever constituted the Being of our Church; which is from Christ, by
the Ministry; but they only established and preserved it, in its Ministry and
polity, from those abuses and insolences, to which, we see them miserably
exposed; if they should want Magistrates to be protecting fathers, and
indulgent mothers to them: Every rude and unclean beast delights to break in,
and waste the field of the Church; when they see the fence of civil protection
is low.

But this defense and provision made for this Church and its Ministry, by
Humane Laws, does no more lessen the strength and beauty of it; than the Laws
for property and safety do diminish any man's wisdom, valor, or care to defend
his own: Christians, as men, ought to be subject to Magistrates, as men;
although they were Heathens, Romans 13. 1 Pet. 2.13. Tit. 3.1.
Heretics, or Persecutors; that so, in honest things, they might merit their
civil protection: How much more (as Christians) ought they to be subject to
Christian Magistrates, that are Patrons and Professors of true Religion: Isai.
49.23.
Whose civil protection and government is so far from being a blemish to it,
that is the greatest temporal blessing, that God has promised, or the Church
can enjoy in this World; as it was in Constantine the Great's time, and some
others after him.

And however, we see, that oft-times this sweet wine, of civil favor, is prone
to sour to the vinegar of factions, even among Christians; And the honey of
peace, plenty, and prosperity, easily turns to pride, envy, anger, ambition,
and contention, through the pravity of man's nature; who, (contrary to the
temper of the most savage beasts) grows most fierce and offensive to God, when
he is best treated by him; Omnia comprebantur sactionibus, seditionibus,
querelis, odiu, invidiis. Suspi. Sever. de s^^ tempor. Ep^s. and Presbyteris,
Hist. Pace ecclesiis undique concessa, caepit invidia totius orbis communis
inimica in media episcoporum frequentia tripudiate. Eus. in vit. Constable. lib. 2.
c. 60.
as Eusebius, and Sulpitius Severus, tell in their times; Yet we must not
refuse or cast away all good things, because evil minds abuse them; much less
may we mistake the Being of a Church, for its well-being; That cannot turn, in
any reason, to this Churches reproach, which was the favor of good men, and
Gods indulgence to this Church: Nor do we think these querulous Ob^ecters, are
therefore like to be, by so much the sooner, weary of their new ways, by how
much they more enjoy connivance, protection, or countenance from any men; The
obtaining of which, is the thing they so much court and solicit: Sure the
shining of the warm Sun on men, need not make them therefore ashamed, or weary
of Gods blessing.

18. The matter of a Church, Saints.
2. As for the matter of a Church, which those Ob^ecters say, must be only
Saints in Truth, as well as show; denying ours to be such; I answer, We wish
all our people were such Saints, as are formerly described, in truth and power;
we endeavor to make them such, as far as the pains, prayers, and examples of
Ministers may work with the grace of God; 2 Cor. 6.1.
But we do not think, that these severe censurers of this Church of England do
believe, That all the Churches mentioned in Scripture (which were the best that
ever were) consisted only of true Saints. That, in Christ's family, did not;
not that, to which Ananias, John 6.70. Have I not chosen you twelve, and one of
you is a Devil? Acts 5.3. Peter to Ananias, Why has Satan filled thy heart, to
lie to the Holy Ghost? Acts 9.13. Simon Magus believed, and was baptized, and
continued with the Apostles, etc. V. 23. I perceive thou art in the gall of
bitterness, and bond of iniquity.
Saphyra, and Simon Magus, were joined in profession; nor all those in Corinth,
Galatia, Laodicea, and the rest mentioned in the Epistles, and Revelation; who
are commended, or blamed, not so much as to the internal temper of their
graces, as to the external peaceableness, order, and purity of their profession
in truth and unity. Neither is this real Saintship of every Member, necessary
to the Being of a visible Church; nor is it to be concluded really of all
those, whom the judgment of charity calls or esteems Saints. We charitably hope
well of all those, who though they may have personal errors and failings, by
reason of frailties or temptations, yet they have not renounced their covenant
with Christ in Baptism, and who make still some profession of Christianity; who
attend the Ordinances of the Word preached, and prayer; who testify their
faith by desiring to have their children baptized; which we do, as of duty to
them, to whom Christ has a federal right, and of whom we have a Christian
hope; though we approve not their parents in all things: Much more do we esteem
those as Members of the Church, who have competent knowledge, and lead an
unblamable life, as many of ours do. If any be children, ignorant, or profane,
yet we think them not presently to be excluded from all Church Fellowship; no
more than such a Jew was to be cut off from Gods people; Since they have Gods
mark and seal still upon them, and are in outward relation and profession,
distinguished from those that are not of the Israel of God; yet we do, not
willingly, or knowingly allow every Ordinance to these, while they appear such;
but only those, of which they have a capacity: In others, we forewarn and
forbid them, when we actually know their unfitness or unpreparedness: Yet still
in Gods name, not in our own; in a way of charity, or ministerial duty; not of
private, or absolute authority; wishing, that a more public way of joynt-power
and authority were duly established (as in all reason it ought to be) in the
Church; both for trial and restraint, of those that have no right to holy
Mysteries; yet still we endeavor to instruct even the worst in the Spirit of
meekness, and to apply what remedies in prudence and charity we may: But if
piety, purity, equity, charity, humility, peaceableness, etc. If these may
denominate men to be Saints in any Church, sure, I believe, the Church of
England can produce more of these, out of her orderly and ancient Professors,
than these new Modellers will easily do of their own forming; besides, many of
those now gone from us, have not cause so much to boast of their beauty and
faces shining, since they left us; as to cover their faces, and with their own
tears to wash away those black spots, with which they appear terribly dashed;
which we are sure are not the spots of Gods holy people.

What is further urged against our Parochial Congregations, 19. Of Communicants
in Parochial Churches.
(which are as parts and branches of this Church of England, standing in a
joint relation to the peace, polity, and welfare of the whole; and to that end,
under Public Order, and Authority) as to the use and partaking of the
Sacraments, (specially that of the Lords Supper;) That our Communions are so
mixed, as to confound the precious with the vile; the ignorant with the
knowing; the scandalous with the unblamable; the prepared with the unprepared;
the washed Lamb with the polluted Swine; so that even this holy Ordinance,
which is the touchstone, sieve, and shreen of true Christians, and true
Churches, is profaned and polluted among us; while Congregations are as lumps
full of leaven; 1 Cor. 5.7.
and no order taken to purge it out: That so the pure and faithful may eat the
feast with comfort, and childrens bread not be given to dogs.

Sacrament, or comfort in it, further than they have Sacramental graces,
fitting and preparing them for it; yet as to men, in outward visible society,
every Christian has such a right to it, as he makes a Profession of the true
Faith; and is in such an outward disposition, as by the orders of the Church,
for age, and measure of knowledge, and conversation, is thought meet: In which,
there are no precise limits in Scripture expressed; either what age, or how
often, or what measure of knowledge, and what preparation is required; but much
is left to the wisdom, care, and charity of the Ministers, Luke 22.14. Christ
sat down, and the twelve Apostles with him. V. 19, 20. He took the bread and
the cup, and gave it to them. V. 21. Behold the hand of him that betrayeth me,
is with me on the Table. Veneranda, sacra, tremenda, myste^ia. (...) Chrysostom. ad
Oly. ep. 2. (...); Basil. (...). Clem. Al. (...). N^s. (...). Ignat. ep. ad
Ephesians. (...). Naz. or. 14. If any of you be a blasphemer, and adulterer, in
malice or envy, or any other grievous crime; bewail your sins, and come not to

and Governors of the Church: And in this sense, though Judas the Traitor had
no internal gracious right to the Sacrament of the Passover, or Supper; yet he
had a professional right, which our Savior denied not to him, and which is all
that man's judgment can reach to.

Secondly, As to some men's practice in the Church of England, we deny not, but
that many and personal abuses may have been in that holy Mystery (which the
ancients justly called dreadful, venerable, adorable, most holy, admirable,
divine, heavenly, etc.) through negligence both of some Ministers and people;
much less do we justify them; we rather mourn for them, and pray heartily,
they may be reformed every way; yet, as to the constitution, order, and
designation of the Church of England, in the celebration of that holy
Sacrament, we affirm,

1. That the piety, wisdom, and charity of this Church, did take care, and by
express order declared, That no such ignorant, profane, impenitent, or
unprepared person (though not known to the Minister, or people to be so,)
should come to the Sacrament; as in Conscience he ought not: And, together with
these (thus only conscious to themselves) all others, if known and notorious,
were by the Minister publicly, and solemnly forbidden, in the name of the Lord
Jesus Christ, not to presume to partake of those holy things.

Every Minister was commanded by preaching, catechizing, examining, and
praying, to prepare (as much as in him lay) the Receivers: Which every good
Minister, as he ought, did, in some sort endeavor; yea, and he might refuse any
young or old, that offered to receive, if they had not some good assurance of
their competent knowledge in the Mysteries; or, if he found them defective in
those fundamentals which the wisdom of the Church thought necessary, and
whereof it set forth a Summary in the public Catechism. So that a Minister in
England, both in the name of the Church, and in the name of Christ, and by the
highest authority of God, did prohibit, denounce against, and, as it were,
excommunicate (by that part of the power of the Keys, which is denunciative and
declarative) both from the comfort, and grace of the Sacrament; and from the
outward partaking of it, every one, that presumed (being unworthy in any kind)
to offer himself to it: If after this, Communio malorum non maculat aliquem
participatione sacramentorum, sed consentione factorum. Aug. ep. 152. See the
Rubric before the Communion, concerning scandalous offenders. 1 Cor. 11.29. He
that eats and d inketh unworth^ly, eats and drinks damnation to himself;
not to any other, who having examined himself, Verse 28. is bid to eat and
drink, etc. See the Rubric before the Communion, The Minister may admit the
penitent, but not the obstinate, in cases of private offenses, etc.
any one unworthy, did adventure to come, yet (sure) the Minister had done his
private duty, as far as God, or man required it of him; having both vindicated
the honor of the Sacrament, as to the divine Institution, and intent; also
declared the care and order of the Church; and so freed both the Congregation,
and his own soul, from stain or blame. Who so came after this prohibition
unworthily, came at the peril of his own soul, and not at the sin of either
Minister or people, that were worthy; whose work and duty is, not by force of
arms, to thrust men out by head and shoulders; which is a military and
mechanic power; but by the sword of Christ's mouth to smite them; and in his
name to cast them out from any right to, or comfort in, the Sacrament; which is
the power, properly ministerial, spiritual, and divine. Where either ignorance
or scandal were gross, and notoriously known to the Minister, in any that
offered to come, The Minister might, and often did, not only privately, but
publicly, and personally admonish, reprove, forewarn: And in some cases, if
the impudence of the offender obtruded himself, the Minister might refuse to
give him the Sacrament; yet this not with passion and roughness, as by empire;
but with meekness and discretion, as in charity: Which present denial, or
abstention of such an one from receiving the holy Sacrament, might afterward be
examined by public and lawful authority (which was settled in this Church) in
case that party had cause or confidence to complain, as of an injury.

20. Good Ministers not defective in their duty, if they make not themselves
Judges.
But where such authority is not se^^ed, or not suffered to be exercised in any
Church, which might and ought to judge in such cases best The party denied, and
the Minister thus denying, (upon pregnant, and to him notorious causes, not
upon probabilities, suspi^ious, or general complaints from others only,)
There, matters of public debate requiring audience, and proofs, and witnesses,
and judge; and all these, due authority; It cannot be expected from any private
Minister, that he should do more than God has commanded, and due authority
empowred him; which is only to instruct, admonish, forbid, and in some cases
to deny, etc. according to the duty of his place, and the authority he had,
both from the Church, and from the Word of God: But he has nothing to do, to
assume the public place of a Judge among his Neighbors; or to deny Communion
to all those that are by any accused, as unworthy or scandalous: Luke 12.14.
Who made me a judge, or a divider over you?
No Reason allowing, or Religion commanding every private Minister, or any
private Christians to be Judges in those cases, wherein they may be parties;
and through passion do injury, and by faction oppress any man.

A right Discipline, and due Authority in the Church, most desirable.
It were to be desired indeed, that such Authority were restored to the Church,
as might judge and decide all cases of public scandal; but while this is
denied, we must not deny Ministers, or people, to do their duty, in celebrating
the Lords Supper, according to the Institution, though there be defects in
discipline, as to that particular. We must not forbear holy duties, when we may
rightly enjoy them, in point of gracious disposition and claim; because they
are not so asserted and ordered in point of pol^ty and extern Discipline, as we
could wish, and as it were convenient; but is not absolutely necessary, so as
to exclude the Minister, or others from it, who desire and prepare for it, by
examining themselves; whom no Reason or Religion can forbid to partake of their
due comforts, because of others faults, whereof they cannot be guilty, because
they are no way accessory; not failing in any private duty of charity, wherein
they stand related to another; as teaching, admonishing, reproving,
forewarning, etc. 1 Cor. 11.28.
The same Apostle, who blames the unworthy receivers, for not examining
themselves, and forbids them so to eat, etc. Commands others to examine
themselves, and so to eat, etc. Without regard to any others unworthiness: The
contagion of whose sin cannot have influence on another grace; any more, than
grace can make another sin less, What sense can there be, That children should
be starved, because there is not power sufficient to keep away all dogs, from
the childrens bread? Yet all men are not presently to be called or counted
dogs, that are not ever in actual preparedness for the Sacrament; Luke 22.32.
or, who may fall into gross sins, as Peter did, whose Faith did not fail, when
he denied Christ after the Sacrament; and since they have still relation to the
Church, and may be penitents.

I should be glad to see (which I heartily pray for) this Church so ordered by
due order, power, and authority established in fitting Church-Governors and
Judges, in such cases, Exodus 18.21. Judges ought to be able men, such as fear
God; men of truth, hating covetousness, etc.
That none might be admitted to the Lords Supper, but such as are both by the
Minister, and chief of the Congregation, (who are in the Roll of Communicants)
allowed and approved, for knowledge and conversation; yet so, as such allowance
or denial may, if need be, have further hearing, and appeal, from this private
Minister and Congregation; which is but just, to avoid the factions, injuries,
partialities and oppressions, which may fall, and often do, among those Neighbors
and Rivals, who are seldom meet to be Judges of mutual scandals, being so often
parties; and besides their weak judgments, have strong passions, and are full
of grudges and emulations against each other; which if not soberly taken up, by
other able and indifferent Judges, (who have authority so to do) it brings
Congregations to those difficulties, which the Independent bodies find, for
want of this prudent and orderly remedy of grievances and offenses; which, in a
short time (as the pitch, and fat, and hair, which Daniel put into the Dragon)
break them in pieces; one part rending from the other, as impatient to submit
to their censure; and so they come to Non-Communion, and to make new Colonies
of lesser Churches, and Bodies; till they break and shiver themselves to such
useless shreds, such thin and small shavings, as have neither the staff of
beauty, nor of bonds among them: Every one by the light of nature concluding,
Par in parem non habet imperium. Authority supposes an eminency.
That there can be no power over others, where there is parity among them; nor
can those have authority over each other, which are in an equality.

Nothing would be more welcome to good Ministers, and faithful people, than to
see that just power settled in the Church, as might by the wisdom, gravity, and
integrity of such, as are truly fit to govern, best repress all abuses and
disorders in the Church, as to matters purely religious: Mean time, we think it
better to bea^ with patience those defects, which we cannot hinder or amend;
and to supply them (what we can) with private care, industry, and discretion,
than either wholly to deny our selves the comfort of this Sacrament, which the
Lord has afforded us; or else to usurp to our selves an absolute power and
jurisdiction over others, which neither the Lord has given us, nor the Church;
and which we see men do easily despise, as a matter of arbitrary usurpation,
not of authoritative constitution: And which is subject, as to many tyrannies
and abuses, so to infinite private janglings and divisions; which no Minister
has leisure to hear, if he had abilities to compose and judge them, being often
very spightful, tedious, and intricate; yea, and himself, possibly, a party, or
witness, and sometimes the accused; who being (for the most part) the ablest in
a Country Congregation to judge of matters, must yet himself be judged
according to some men's weak Models of Church Government and Discipline, both as
to his doctrine and manners, by his High-shoe Neighbors, (which he counts his
body,) nor may he have any appeal from them in an Independent way.

21. Of the peoples judging in the Church.

1 Cor. 5.12. 1 Cor. 6.1, 2, 3, 4.

Do ye not know, that the Saints shall judge the World, and Angels: How much
more the things that pertain to this life.


To that grand Charter and Commission, which some plead; by which every Saint is
made a Judge in all things of this life, within the pale of the Church, and is
after to be judge of Angels; I answer, The wise and holy Apostle does not give
to every one in the Church any such power, nor to the majority of Christians in
any Congregation; but rather reproves their folly, that laid any judicative
works on those that were least esteemed in the Church, Verse. 4. Whence arose
that unsatisfaction as made their differences greater, and drove them for
remedy to go to Law before the Civil Tribunals of unbelievers, V. 6. to the
great scandal of Religion, and shame of the Church of Corinth; where being many
Christians, and (no doubt) in many distinct Congregations, for convenience of
meeting, the Apostle wonders they could not be so wise for their own credit and
quiet, as to find out some wise and able men, who might be fit to judge and
end their controversies; as having both real abilities internal, and outward
reputation in the Church, also a public consent and orderly appointment to the
work; a^l which makes a complete and valid Authority to judge others; which can
never be promiscuous, in whole bodies, or rabbles of simple and mean men,
without both contempt and confusion; which imprudent way among the Corinthians,
the Apostle counts both a fault and a shame.

Of Communicants to be admitted. 1 Cor. 5.7. 2 Cor. 6.15, 16.
What places are further urged for purging out the old leaven; for not eating
with such an one; for the non-communion, between Christ and Belial, light and
darkness, etc. They are all fulfilled by every private Christian, when both in
conscience and conversation, he keeps himself from concurring, or complying
with any wicked and scandalous persons, in their sins; reproving and repressing
them, as much as morally lies in his place and power: But the bare view or
knowledge of another sin, Vnumquemque alienis peccatis maculari, omnes impiae
seditionis autores solam causam separationis sibi assumunt: Contra disputat.
Cypr. de unit. eccl. and August. ep. 48.
must not hinder him from doing his duty, or enjoying his privilege and comfort
by the Sacrament; which depends, not on what is in another life, or heart, of
sin; but on what he finds of grace and preparedness in his own; As to the
public honor, and purity, or unleavenedness of the Church, the special duty,
and care executive lies on those, (not who are private Christians in common,
but) who have public authority in special, to do it, by censuring,
restraining, or casting out scandalous offenders; whereto every Christian is
not called, because not enabled, either by God or man, by gift or power, to
discern or judge, and determine cases; which is a matter of polity, power, and
order in the Church, and not of private piety, or charity: Nor is it indeed of
absolute necessity, so as to deprive good Christians of any holy ordinance, in
case such power is obstructed, or hindered, or not established in the Church.

Neither Minister nor People then ought to refrain from doing their duty in the
holy celebration of this Sacrament, upon any such defects of external polity,
and power, for well-ordering of the Church; but rather, with the more exactness
and diligence, exhort one another, and prepare by inward graces, for those holy
Mysteries; whose institution has no such restriction, either by Christ, or the
blessed Apostle Paul; who enjoins Ministers and Believers to do this, 1 Cor. 11.
holily and worthily, in point of personal preparation; but no word of either
usurping a power to re^ect others, as they list, which belongs not to them; or
else, to abstain wholly from the duty, for want of having their will, as too
many do, both People and Ministers; to the great grief of many good Christians,
and to the exceeding slighting and disuse of that holy Ordinance in this
Church, 1 Cor. 11.25. (...) denotat (...). As often as ye drink it:
which was wont to be much frequented, which the words of Christ import, or
enjoin to be done oftentimes in the Church.

For that new coined form, image and superscription of a Church, 22. Of
Church Covenant.
that Congregational Church Covenant, which no Synod or Council, but only some
private men have lately invented, and in formal words magisterially dictated
(when yet they cry down all other prescribed forms of administrations, prayer,
or devotion in the Church,) By which, some men fancy they only can be rightly
made up into one lump or Church Fellowship: This they accuse us in England for
the want and neglect, when they have set us in every corner so many copies of
it.

I answer, We have indeed in the Church of England, from its first
Christianity, been wholly without this covenanting way; and I think, both
happily and most willingly we had been so still, since there appears no more
ground for it in Scripture precept, or Churches paterns; nor is there any more
need of it, as to the peace and polity of the true Church of Christ, than there
is of rents and patches in a fair and whole Garment. Who knows not, Jon^h 4.10.
(...)
that like Jonah's gourd it is (filius noctis) the production of yesterday;
risen from the darkness and divisions of men's minds: The fruit of discontent,
separation, and self-conceit, for the most part; though, it may be, nursed up
by devout and well-meaning Christians; yet it looks very like those bastard
brats which the Novatians and Donatists of old began every where; which were
like Ismaels to Isaac, mockers and contemners of the true Churches Communion,
Order, and Peace.

We do not think this Covenant any more essential to the Being of a true
Church, than John Baptists Leathern girdle was to his being a Man, or a
Prophet: It is an easy and specious novelty, therefore pleasing to common
people, because within their grasp and reach; which its Proselytes, that
forsake and abhor the English Churches Order and Communion, do wrap and hug
themselves in as much, as any Papist does in his adherence to the Roman party,
or in his hopes to be buried in a Monks Cowl: Besides, it carries this great
temptation with it, of gratifying the common professor with some show of Power
and Government, which he (once covenanted into that Church Way) shall solemnly
exercise: But (in good-earnest) to sober Christians, who have no secret byas of
discontent or interest to sway them, this new fashion of their Church Covenant,
seems to have, as no command or example in Scripture, so no precedent in
antiquity; nor is it recommended for any excellent effects of prudence or
peace, which it produces, either to private Christians, or the public welfare
of the Reformed Churches. Some look on it as a mark of Schismatical
confederacy, which carries in its Bowels viperine principles, which are
destructive to the quiet of States and Kingdoms, as well as of Churches.

If any find any good or contentment in it, as a tie, or pledge of love, in
private fraternities; yet they vastly overvalue it, to cry it up, as a matter,
no less necessary to the Being of a Church, or well-being of Christians, than
the skin is to the Body; when, alas, it is but a cloak lately taken up, which
never fell from Elias his shoulders; and serves rather to cover some men's
infirmities and discontents against this Church of England, than much to keep
them warm, or adorn them as Christians. We shall give a poor account of former
Churches or Christians, if this covenanting invention should be of such
concernment to Christianity. To which it seems to many wise and good men as
superfluous, as it were to bind a man with wisps of straw, when he is already
bound with chains of gold; with more firm and precious ties.

For, every true and conscientious Christian knows and owns himself to have
upon his Conscience, far more strict and indissoluble ties, not only of nature
and creation, but of the Law and Word of God; yea, and of Christian covenant,
and profession, by his baptismal-vow; besides, that of the other Sacrament;
also his private vows, promises, and repentings, etc. All which strictly bind
the conscience of all good Christians to all duties of piety and charity,
according to the relations, (private or public, civil or sacred) wherein they
stand to God or man.

And further, we see by daily experience, That these sorry withs of man's
invention, obtruded as divine and necessary upon Christians and Churches, bind
not any of these new small bodies or bundles, so fast, but that they
continually are breaking, separating, and scattering, into as many fractions
and subdivisions, Error sibi semper dispa^ est and discolor, quanto magis a
veritate tantum ab unitate discedit. August. Ephesians. 3.17.
as they have heady minds, fancies, and humors among them. And this they do,
without any sense of sin or shame; yea, for the most part, with an angry
glorying, despising, and defying of one another; when, but lately, they boasted
in how rare a way they were of Church Fellowship, and Saintly-communion; not,
as Members of Christ's Body, the Catholic Church, grounded and grown up in
truth and love; but only as pieces of wood, finely glued together, by reciting
a form of words, which they call a Church Covenant, which a little spittle, or
wet dissolves: Nor do they make any scruple to moulder and divide, if once they
come to dispute and differ in the least kind. So hard is it for any thing to
hold long together, which is compacted of weak judgments and strong passions.

Last of all, It is evident in the experience of all wise Christians, That this
narrow and short thong of private Bodying, Church-covenanting, cannot extend so
far, as is necessary for the Churches general peace, order, and welfare, in
reference to its more public relations, and necessities; which often require
stronger and more effectual remedies: Yea, these small strings and cords
binding each particular Congregation apart (as if it were a limb to be let
blood) makes them at length grow benumed, and less sensible of that common
spirit of love and charity, by which, each Member is knit to the larger parts,
and so to the whole Body of the Church; to whose common good, they ought wisely
and charitably to be more intent, than to their particular Congregations; which
are, but as the Pettitoes or little Fingers of the Church: Which may not act,
or be considered, otherways, than as they are, and subsist; which is, not apart
by themselves, nor only in relation to an hand or foot, to which they are more
immediately conjoined; but, as in an higher relation to the whole Body, of
which, they are real parts, servient to the whole; and as much concerned in the
common good and preservation of the whole (if not more) than of themselves, or
any particular part or Member. A Christian must not deal out his charity, by
retail and small parcels only, as to private Fraternities, and Congregations;
but also by wholesale, to the ampler proportions of Christ's Church; according
as he stands in large and public relations; the due regard to the peace,
order, and welfare of which, is not to be dispensed withal, nor shuffled off,
by saying, 1 Cor. 12.21.
I am of such a Congregational-Body, or Covenanting Church; no more, than the
hand may say, I am not of the head, nor near it; and so will have no care of it.

We are therefore so far from being admirers of the small talents and weak
inventions of those men, in so great a matter, as the constituting and
conserving of a true Church, by so poor and feeble an engine, as this of
private compacts and covenantings; (by which, they threaten with severe pens,
and tongues, and brows, to batter and demolish the great and goodly Fabric,
and Communion, of this and all other National Churches; which are cemented
together by excellent Laws, and public Constitutions, so as to hold an
honorable union with themselves, and the whole Catholic Church,) That we
rather wonder at the weakness and simplicity of those inventers and abetters,
who in common reason cannot be ignorant, that as in civil respects, and polity,
so in Ecclesiastical, no private fraternities, in families, nor Corporations,
(as in Towns and Cities) can vacate those more public and general relations,
or those ties of duty and service, which each Member ows to the Public,
whereof it is but a part; and it may be so inconsiderable an one, that for its
sake, the greater good of the public, ought not in Reason or Religion, to be
prejudiced, or any way neglected: No more ought it to be in the Churches larger
concernments, for Peace, Order, and Government.

Nay, we dare appeal to the Consciences of any of those Bodying Christians,
(whom charity may presume to be godly and judicious;) Whether they find in
Scripture, or have cause to think, That the blessed Apostles ever constituted
such small Bodies of Covenanting Churches; when there were great numbers, and
many Congregations of Christians in any City, Province, or Country; so as each
one should be thought absolute, Independent, and no way subordinate to another?
Whether ever the Apostles required of those lesser handfuls of Christians,
(which might, and did, convene in one place) any such explicit Forms, or
Covenants; besides those holy bonds, which by believing, and professing of the
Faith, by Baptism, and Eucharistical communion, were upon them? Or, Whether the
blessed Apostles would have questioned, or denied those to be true Christians,
and in a true Church, or have separated from them, or cast them off, as not
ingrafted in Christ, or growing up in him, who, without any such bodying in
small parcels, had professed the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ, in the due use
of Word, Sacraments, and Ministry? who endeavored to lead a holy, and orderly
life, themselves, and sought by all means, which charity, order, or authority
allowed them, to repress the contrary in others? No doubt the Apostles wisdom
and charity, was far enough from the wantonness and uncharitableness of some of
these men's spirits; who do not only mock our Church, and its Ministers, 2
Kings 2.23.
as the children did Elisha, the Prophet; but they seek to destroy them, as the
she-bears did the children. Sure enough, the Apostles, instead of such severe
censures, peevish disputes, and rigorous separations, would have joined with,
and rejoiced in the Faith, Order, and Unity of such Churches, such Christians,
and such Ministers, wherever they had met with them, in all the World,
without any such scruple, or scandal, for their not being first broken into
Independent Bodies, and then bound up by private covenantings; which are indeed
no other, than the racking, distorting, and dislocations of parts, to the
weakening and deforming of the whole.

We covet not a better or truer constituted Church, than such, as we are most
confident, Col. 2.5. Joying and beholding the order, and the stedfastness of
your faith in Christ.
the wisdom and charity of the Apostles would have approved in the main;
however in some lesser things, they might gently reprove, and reform them, as
they did diverse famous and flourishing Churches. And such a Church, we have
enjoyed in England, (by Gods mercy) before ever we knew those men's unhappy
novelties, or cruelties, who seek now to divide, and utterly destroy us, unless
we conform to their deforming principles and practices. And however, we have
not been wholly without the spots of humane infirmities; yet we have professed
Jesus Christ, in that truth, order, purity, and sincerity, which gives us
comfort and courage, to claim the ((...)) privilege of being true Christians,
and a true Church; that is, a very considerable, famous, and flourishing part,
branch, or Member of that Catholic Church, which professes visibly, or
believes savingly, in the Name of Jesus Christ, the Head of the whole Body, and
of every part; to whom we are united, by the same common Faith, and by Charity,
to one another. Certainly, the best Churches and Christians, were anciently
like the goodly bunches of Grapes, Numb. 13.24.
which the Spies brought between them (as an emblem of Christ crucified)
hanging on a staff; so fair, so full, so great and united clusters: From which,
no small slips did ever willingly divide, or rend to Schism, but presently they
became, not as the fruit of Canaan, but as sour Grapes, fit only to set men's
teeth on edge; wheting them to bite, and devour one another.

For the manner of each particular holy Administration in our Church, to answer
all the small cavils, which men list to make, 23. The great shield of the
Church of England.
is to encourage too much their petulancy; and to make them too much masters of
sober men's time and leisure: Only this great and faithful shield, See those
Reverend and Learned Writers, Bishop Bilson, Bishop Cowper, Doctor Field,
Master Richard Hooker, Master Mason, and others.
Learned men heretofore have, and we do still, hold forth, to repel all their
darts and arrows, That both in the Ordination of our Ministers, and in their
celebration of holy things, and in its Government, Order, and Harmony, the
Church of England has followed the clearest rules in Scripture, and the best
paterns of the ancient Churches; only enjoying those Christian liberties of
prudence, order, and decency, which we see the gracious wisdom of Christ has
allowed his Church; and which particular Churches have always used and enjoyed
in their extern rites and customs, with variety, yet without blemish, as to the
Institutions of Christ, or to the soundness in the Faith, or to any breach of
Charity, or any prejudice and scandal to each others liberties in those things.

So that those busy flies upon the Wheels of this Chariot, the Reformed Church
of England, (in which the Gospel of Jesus Christ has hitherto been carried
among us, for many years, with great triumph and success) have stirred up very
little dust; so as might blind any eyes (that are not full of motes and beams,
or blood-shotten) from seeing clearly, and evidently, a true Christian Church,
a true Ministry, and truly religious Administrations among us. Blessed be God,
though these sour Momusses find or make some faults and flaws in lesser
matters, the mending of which they most oppose and hinder; yet their strength
cannot shake the foundations of our Jerusalem, which are of precious pearls,
and solid stones; nor can their malice overthrow our grand and goodly pillars;
the true and able Ministers, and their holy Ministrations, of Word and
Sacraments, among Professors of the Faith; who do, as unquestionably constitute
a true Church, as a reasonable soul and body make a true man.

Essentials of a true Church in England. 1 Timothy 6.3.
It is well, some of their charity, is such that they allow us (for they cannot
shift it,) thus much: First, That we have the only true ground, and sure rule
of Religion, the written Word of God; that, beyond this, we hold nothing as a
matter of faith, or Christian duty: Secondly, That we celebrate the holy
Sacraments according to the sum and substance of the divine Institution:
Thirdly, That our conversation aims to be such, Phil. 1.27.
as becomes the Gospel in all manner of holiness, to the saving of our own, and
others souls. What can these Aristarchusses carp at in the ground of our faith,
the Scriptures; the Seals of our Faith, the Sacraments; the life of our Faith,
1 Pet. 1.9.
holy conversation; and the end of our faith, the salvation of our souls? Is it
not strange, That all these sweet and fair flowers of Christ's planting and
watering, should grow so well in that, which some call Babylon? in Antichrists
Garden? or on the Devils dunghill? That, it should be no true Church of Christ,
which owns nothing for Religious, but what is according to the truth of Jesus;
either commanding or permitting, instituting or indulging; of pious necessity,
or of prudent liberty.

We should put these rigid Catoes too much to the blush, for their unnatural
ingratitude to the Ministers, and Church of England, if we should ask them:
Whence they had this privilege, by which they own themselves to be Christians?
whence this power to cast, or call themselves into Bodies or Churches, as
Believers? (which is by them presupposed;) whence they had (till of late years)
their instruction (for the most part) in the knowledge of Jesus Christ? Sure
these holy leaves or fruits grow not, but in the Pale and Garden of the Church
of Christ; not in our own rude mirdes and untilled natures; not among desolate
Indians, obstinate Jews, o^ barbarous Turks; and not often in private closets
and corners; which nourish a neglect and contempt of Public Ordinances. But if
these men were self-taught and converted, yet sure, not self-baptized too; nor
their Teachers, self-ordained too: If they had nothing of their Christianity
from the Ministry of the Church of England^; It is no wonder they prove such
Scholars, such Christians, and such Preachers, as some of them seem to be;
having been their own Masters, Ministers, and Baptizers: They are indeed, only
worthy of themselves, and of wiser men's pity.

For that ((...)) the retreat, 24. Of pretensions to be above any Ministry, as
taught of God immediately.
or reserve of some men (by which, as Eaglets they would seem to soar out of
sight, and to build their Nest on a Rock, that is higher than our ordinary
Reason, Religion, and Experience can reach;) as if they were immediately
inspired, specially called, and taught of God, baptized by his Spirit, without
any Minister, or outward Ministry, they must give us leave, not to believe them
upon their bare word, (which has not always been so sure,) till they
demonstrate, and prove it better, by Gods Word, and their better manners; For
which, we will give them time enough. Mean while, we are sure, the best
Christians among them, were made such, by the ordinary Ministers of this
Church; and these made Ministers by no other means but that Ordination, derived
from, and ascending up to the blessed Apostles; whom Christ first chose to be
Disciples, and after ordained and sent them as Public Ministers; not only, as
to personal discharge, but as to successional descent. These were Eagles
indeed, who flew high in their knowledge and piety, yet stooped low in their
humility and charity: Those others of a new brood, are more like young Cuckoes,
which devour the Bird, in whose nest, and by whose fostering, they were
hatched. Some of them have knowledge; I would they had more humility and
charity, they would not disdain to own the parents that begat and educated
them; even this (now) so poor, desolated, beaten, torn, and wasted Church of
England, and its (Antichristian) Ministers, as they please to call them.

Be it so; some men's tongue is no slander: If we neither add to, nor detract
from the Scriptures, as Jews, Papists, and Euthusiasts do; If we err in no
fundamentals of faith, or manners; if we refuse no duty divinely required; if we
allow no error in our selves, or others; if we drive on no worldly designs
injuriously, or hypocritically; but study to approve our selves in all
godliness and honesty, with meekness of wisdom to all men; we need no more fear
the drops of peevish tongues, or dashes of malicious pens, (as to the honor and
comfort of being a part of the true Church of Christ) than a cloth dyed in
grain, need to fear stains by the aspersions of dirt, cast on it by unclean and
envious hands.

25. Of the power of the People in Church affairs.
4. But it is objected against us in England, That neither Church nor Minister
of England, did, or do own that high and mighty principle of all Church power,
which some call, The People.

Answ. True indeed: Although we highly love and esteem as Brethren, the
faithful and humble people, for whom Christ has died; yet we are not of so
spungy and popular a softness, as to own any part, or Congregation, or Body of
People, to be the original, or conduits of any Spiritual or Church power; which
no learned and wise men ever esteemed to be Popular or Democratical, but rather
an excellent Aristocracy; where many able men were in Counsel, and some one
eminent in order and authority among them. We do not dig, or descend to these
low valleys, for these holy waters; nor do we seek for the flowings of it
through such crazy and crooked pipes; nor do we hope to draw it forth out of
such broken Cisterns, which can hold no such waters: We have them from higher
fountains, and derive them in straiter channels, Matthew. 28.19.
and conserve them in fitter vessels, than the vulgarity of even honest
Christians can be presumed to be: That is, from the ordinary Power, and
constant Commission, which from Christ was derived to the Apostles, Matthew.
16.19. Matthew. 18.18. John 20.23.
and from them to their Successors in their ordinary Ministry, and Church
power, in after ages; who had this peculiar power of the keys of Heaven, to
bind or remit; (...), Pascere cum imperio, and pastor inde ut princeps. To
feed and rule. Revel. 12.5. and 19.15. Acts 20.28. 1 Pet. 5.2. Vulgus ex
veritate pauca, ex opinione multa aestimat. Tul. pro. Ros. Com.
to gather, to guide, to feed, and to govern the several parts of the Church in
Christ's stead, and name, orderly committed to them.

People may rudely wrest these keys out of true Bishops and Ministers hands,
but it is evident, they were never committed to them, by the great Master of
the House, Jesus Christ; nor do they know how to use them, unless it be to
break their heads with them, whom Christ has set as stewards in his household:
These rustic and rash undertakers to reform, and control all, are only
probable to shipwreck themselves, and many others, and the whole Ship of this
Church, by driving the skilful Pilots, (the true Bishops and Ministers) from
the Helm, and putting in their places every bold Boatswain, and simple Swobber.

Yet are the populacy flattered by some, to this dangerous insolency and error;
who putting fire to this thatch, instead of the Chimney, do but provoke the
poor people to their own hurt; to forsake their own mercies; and to injure both
their own, and others souls: Mean time, sober and wise Christians cannot but
smile, with shame, sorrow, and indignation, to see, how some Plebeian
Preachers, who are new risen, as from the slime of the earth, (in whom no
Prometheus has breathed any spark of heavenly fire; of spiritual, divine, and
truly ministerial power;) to see (I say) how these Teachers have brought
themselves by a voluntary humility, to depend on peoples suffrages and charity;
not only for maintenance, but for their very Ministry; being now sunk so low,
as to flatter their good Masters, with this paradox or strange principle, That
they (as the people, or body, be they never so few and mean) have a reciprocal
power, to beget those, who are to be their Spiritual Fathers; that by a more
than Pythagorean Metemphycosis, the Power, Spirit, and Authority of Jesus
Christ, who was sent by his Father, John 20.21.
and so sent his Apostles, and they others, in the same Spirit, to be Fathers,
Pastors, Rulers, Stewards, etc. That at length, this Spirit and Authority,
should transmigrate (we know not how, nor when) into the very mass and bulk of
common people, if they be but Christians of the lowest form; animating them in
the whole, and in every part, or parcel of them, with such plenitude of Church
power, as enables them to be all Kings and Priests, Pastors and Teachers,
Prophets and Apostles, if need be; and if they list; and if they have leisure;
or, if not to act so in their own persons (having more profitable employments,)
yet they have virtually, and eminently in them, as much power, as Christ had,
and used, or left to any men; whereby to consecrate and ordain true Ministers;
to try and teach those that are to teach them; to rule their Rulers; to
discipline their Shepherds; to govern their Governors; to turn, not only
Religion out of doors, but even all Reason, Order, and Civility, upside down,
rather than not exercise this imaginary power, especially, if it serve to
secular advantages: And all this, because they are told, they are the Church;
and so may erect all Church power, as in them, and from them. This fancy is
able to make a plain Country-Christian stand on his Tiptoes; and to bring all
his family to see him and his other-like members, making up this glorious Body,
which he calls his Church; that they may be witnesses, with how much folly, and
simplicity, and clamor, and confidence, he with his Neighbors, examines,
approves or reproves, refuses or chooses, and ordains all officers, and some
new fashioned Minister or Pastor: Who (poor-man) must neither Preach nor Pray,
not eat, nor look otherways, than pleases these sad and silly, yet very
supercilious pieces of popular pride, and itching arrogance; nor can such an
hungry and timorous Pastor ever be settled, or safe in this Pastoral Authority,
26. Common people not fit to manage Church power in chief.
unless he have the trick of Faction; which is still to ingratiate with the
major part of this his flock; who will (otherways) as easily push and beat him
out of this fold, or break all to pieces; as ever they admitted him by a
profane easiness, and popular insolency.

But I must with less flattery, and more honesty, tell this Generation of
perverse Usurpers, this truth, (which is not unwelcome to sober spirited
Christians,) That the weight of Christianity does not at all hang on this
popular pin; which is no where to be found, but in their light heads, (...).

and heavy hands; neither Reason, nor Religion, (since men were redeemed from
the barbarity of Acorns, Nakedness, and Dens,) ever thought the plebs, or
common people ought to be all in all, if any thing at all; either in conferring
or managing, either Civil or Church power; but least of all, that part of
Church power which is proper for the making of a Minister, in the way of due
Ordination, (of which I shall after give a fuller account;) For this is that,
to which they generally have least proportion, either of knowledge, learning,
holiness, or discretion: Besides, it would thence follow, that, so soon as any
Sect or Faction of people can get but numbers, and courage, they may do what
they list, in this plenitude of power, without the leave of Magistrates or
Ministers, in Church or State. These are pestilent principles, which are not
only pernicious to the Church, but to any civil Societies; threatening not our
faith only, but our purses and throats.

Nor did ever any wise men (what ever is pretended, at any time, to amuse the
people, and to serve an occasion) intend, or suffer the community, or vulgar
people (with their massy bodies and numerous hands) really to attain, use, or
enjoy, any such supreme power in civil administrations: If once soverain power
be gotten, though by the means of such credulous assistants; yet, whatever the
populacy may flatter themselves with, it never is, nor can wisely and happily
be managed by them, but rather without them, above them, and many times against
them.

Power precarious, that is such as depends upon a popular principle, or
plebeian account, such as sometime was among the Grecian State, and Romans, is,
for the most part, but an Empire of beggary, or flattery, or falsity; Where (at
best) wise and valiant men may often be forced to prostrate themse ves to the
arbitrament of the vulgar; who are injurious esteemers and ungrateful requiters
even of the most public merits. But (oftentimes) the peoples pretended power,
and interest, is made use of in specious terms, and cunning agitations, only
to serve the turn of turbulent, ambitious, and factious spirits in Church and
State; whose envy or ambition easily teaches the credulous community to esteem
the over-meriting of the best men, and Magistrate^, to be their greatest
oppression, and most deserving (Ostracism) banishment, or disgrace.

Per paucorum hominum virtute crevit Imperium. Salust. Romans 13.4.
The Life of Government, and Soul of Dominion, is, that real power and
resolution, which is in the hand of one or more wise and potent men; who are
always intent to deserve well of the people, yet always able to curb and
repress their insolency and inconstancy. Without this authentic power of the
Sword, (which is not to be born in vain, Prove. 30.31.
and against which there is no rising up) Government or Empire, is a mere
carcass without a soul; like dead beer, or evaporated wine, or a rotten post,
which every one despises. It is indeed one point of wisdom and true honor, to
deserve well of the people, so as to gain their love; but the highest and
safest principle of policy is to command them by power to just fear: For their
love is no longer to be trusted, if once they cease to fear, and revere their
Governors. The goodness and gentleness of Magistrates must not flaken or
m^th-eat their power; nor their power oppress and wire-draw their goodness:
Princes and Governors are lost, if they presume common people at any time to be
such Saints, and so good natured, that they need not power effectual and
soverain to command and restrain them, as Beasts; to set banks and boundaries
to them, as to great waters; whose force is not seen, but in their eruptions
and disorders; and they are then best and most useful, when kept and directed
in such a course and chanel, as restrains them from showing how great a
propensity and fury they have to do mischief, if once they get liberty; which
soon turns the flattering smoothness of it former smiles, to threatening
tortuosities, and dreadful over-whelmings.

And so on the other side, Governors are not safe, if they so apply and use
rigid force and severer dominion, as if they forgot that they ruled men (and
not beasts) who are sensible of gentleness, and may be obliged to quietness by
humanity. 1 Kings 12.
Rehoboam might have continued the heavy yoke of his wise Fathers taxes and
burdens, if he had but so lined it with soft words, and courtly blandishments,
as it should not much have galled their necks; which custom will harden, and
kindness make unsensible of what they bear. It is not imaginable, how much
common people will bear, if they see they must; nor how little they will bear,
if they see they may rebel; their complainings or tumultuary petitionings, are
menacings; when they declare, that they cannot longer undergo legal burdens,
their meaning is, they will not; and only want power to act. Necessity and
force makes the vulgar tame, with their strength, and patient, as Asses; but
wanton and presumptuous fancies makes them, as the Vn^corn, Job 39.9. (...).
Thucid.
impatient of the most honest subjection: No condition of Government ever
pleased all that were Subjects; and most are prone to be unsatisfied with the
present; whatever it is, they fancy and hope change may be better for their
interest. Therefore, the calmest tempers of people must not be trusted; no more
than the smiles of Halcion Seas. Wise Pilots know, there is no point of the
Compass, whence a tempest may not come; nor is there any commotion, or
inclination to troubles, whose impression the vulgar will not easily receive
and raise to a storm: They are like a weighty baody kept up with engines, on
the top of a hill; if once it be free, it falls; and falling downward, it
drives it self; Motion adding an impetu^ to its weight; the ((...)) many, or
multitude, are always the more dangerous, by how much less suspected: Necessity
of obeying, is in most men but the cover of hypocrisy; except in some few,
whom conscience makes subject; Romans 13.5.
and who upon Christian principles, choose rather with patience to suffer under
any lawful Magistrates, than to contest with them, although they were sure to
conquer: Fearing no oppression or tyranny so much, as that of sin; as no sin so
much, as that of rebellion, 1 Samuel 15.23.
either against God, or those that are in Gods stead, and authority over them.
Factious spirits, which possess most men (though they are not a war of it, 2
Kings 8.13.
more than Hazael was of his) easily make surprises upon slackned, weakened, or
over-confident power; whose security as to men's peaceful tempers, makes it less
vigilant.

The true temperament is, where just and indisputable power, is so wisely
managed, (...). Muson. ap. Stobaeum.
as renders Governors, rather august than dreadful; rather venerable as
Parents, than formidable as Masters; though the Body Politic seem never so
fairly fleshed with love, and skinned over with kindness, yet there is neither
strength nor safety in it, unless the sinews and bones of majesty, real and
effectual power, be maintained. It is enough, and as much as is safe for common
people, to have the fancy and imagination of that power and liberty, which
their deputies, representatives, or Tribunes tongues may take in public
Conventions and Parliaments: But it is dangerous for themselves, as well as for
their Magistrates, ever to let them tamper at the lock of majesty and
sovereinty, with the Key of Power; for if they cannot fairly and easily open
that door, through fury and impatience they will break it open by violence; if
they be not overawed. There is no (Arcanum) Mystery or Secret of Empire, like
to that of keeping such power, as evil men may fear, and good men will love;
because they know it is for the public good; and though it should lie heavy on
subjects, yet it is not so terrible, as to be ground between two milstones of
rival powers in civil dissentions.

No wise Magistrate therefore, either in policy or conscience, that is once
invested in due authority soverein, will ask the people leave, either to have
it, or to use it: The softer formalities sometime used to ask the peoples
consent, (not in their bulk and heard) but in their proxies and deputies, is
but a complement; and where prevalent power asks, it is never denied; nor is it
ever asked, but where conquering or hereditary power knows men dare not refuse
it. No personal title or pretension to sovereinty is so unjust, which people
will not confirm by their consent: In which, their worldly wisdom looks more to
their own safety, and the public peace, than to any particular man's right and
interest; as they are wasted and ruined by contesting with those, that are to
strong for them; so they would soon be too hard for themselves, and most their
own enemies, if they should be left to arrogate, or exercise power according to
their own various fancies, brutish motions, and preposterous appetites.

Therefore, God who is ((...)) a lover of mankind, has so ordered in his
providence; that, where any people are blessed, some one or few men, who are
wiser than the people, become also stronger, by an orderly and well-united
strength; thereby preserving themselves, and the public, from those impetuous
furies, to which this Leviathan, the people, is as naturally subject, as the
Sea is to waves and storms, both in Civil and Ecclesiastical affairs; for they
are no whit calmer in matters of Religion, than in those of secular regards;
every man in Church matters, being confident of his skill, or at least his will
and zeal, thinks it a shame to seem ignorant, or if he be conscious to his
ignorance, seeks to cover it over, and set it off with forwardness.

Therefore the wisdom of the Lord Christ, upon whose shoulders the Government
of his Church is laid, Isai. 9.7.
has set bounds to man's activity and unquietness, by another way of Church
power; which is settled in, and derived by fewer indeed, but yet, wiser and
abler persons, than the community of Christians can be presumed to be; who in
all affairs of Church or State, have ever given such experiments of their
follies, madnesses, and confusions; wherever they arrogate power, or have
much to do, beyond ciphers in a sum; that all wise men conclude, That people
are then happiest, when they have least to do in any thing that is called
Government: Nor is it to be believed, that Jesus Christ has ordered any thing
in his Churches polity, that is contrary to the principles of true wisdom;
which in man is but a beam of that Sun, which is in God.

But the Bodying men say, 28. People not fit to judge of doctrine or scandals
in Religion.
They must and ought to have a Church, not only visible in the profession of
Faith, but palpable and maniable, so as they may at once grasp it, and upon
every occasion convene it, or the major part of it, into one place; that so
they may complain of what they think amiss, and remedy by the power of that
small fraternity, what ever faults any of them list to find in one another, as
Fellow Members and Brethren; yea, and in those too, whom they have made to be
their Pastors, Rulers, and Fathers.

religious respects, by error and scandal, we make no doubt: Nor is it denied,
but they may and ought both by private charity, be admonished, and by public
authority, be reproved and censured. Where this Authority is (as it ought to
be) in the hands of those, whom the Lord Christ has appointed, as wise, able,
and authorized by the Church, to judge of Doctrine, Manners, and Differences,
incident among Christians, as such. But I appeal to all sober and judicious
Christians, whether they can find or fancy almost, that venerable Consistory,
that judicious Senate, that grave and dreadful Tribunal (which the ancients
speak of among Christians of those first and best times) which is necessary for
the honor, and good order of Religion, and peace of Christians; Whether, I say,
there be any face or form of it, among those dwarf Bodies, those petty Church
lets, those narrow Conventicles, whose Head and Members, Pastors and Flock, are
for the most part not above the Plebeian size; of a mere mechanic mould;
either ignorant, or heady, or wilful, or fierce, under words and semblances of
zeal, gravity, and an affected severity.

I make no quaere, Whether these sorts of men be fit persons, to whom all
appeals in matters of Religion must be made; and by whom they must be finally
determined; to whose judgments, prudence, and conscience, all matters of
doctrine and scandal must be referred: By whom Religious concernments must be
ordered and reformed; by whom Ministers must be examined, tried, and ordained,
In eo quisque judex recti constituitur, in quo peritus judicatur. Reg. Juris.
first; afterward, judged and deposed. Whether it be fit, that those, who are
guilty of so little learning, or experience in divine matters, should solely
agitate these great things of God, which so much concern his truth, his glory,
and Christians good, every way* which matters both as to Doctrine and
Discipline, are able to exercise and fully employ the most learned, able, and
holy men.

Who dreads not to think, that all saving truths stand at such men's mercy; the
honor of Christ, and the good of men's souls too; while all degrees of
excommunication, and censures, are irrepealably transacted by them; Among whom
its hard to find two wise men; and scarce any ten of them (if they be twenty)
of one mind, while they boast they are of one Body?

Again, who will not sadly laugh to see, that, when they differ (as they often
do) and break in pieces; yet like quantitative substances, they are always
divisible; like water and other homogeneous bodies, they still drop and divide
into as many new Churches and Bodies, as they are dissenting or separating
parties? The miracle is, that when like Hypolitus his Limbs, they are rent and
scattered by Schisms into Factions, yet still every leg, or arm, or hand, forms
presently into a new distinct, complete Body, and subdivided Church: Each of
which conceives such an integrality of parts, and plenitude of power, that it
puts forth head, and eyes, and hands; all Church Officers, Pastors, Elders,
Deacons, by an innate principle of Church power, which they fancy to be in any
two or three godly people. At this rate, and on this ridiculous presumption,
they run on as water on a dry ground, till it has wasted it self; till they
are in small chips and slivers, making up Bodies at six and sevens; and
Churches of two or three Believers: These ere long losing one another in the
midst of some new opinion, some sharp subtilty, or some angry curiosity (which
they cannot reach,) then, and not before, this meteor or blasing Star of a
popular, Independent, absolute, self-sufficient Church power in the people,
which threatened Heaven and Earth, and strived to outshine the Sun, and Moon,
and Stars, of all ancient combined Churches, Order, and Government, for want of
matter, quite vanishes and disappears, by its Members separating from, and
excommunicating, or unchurching of each other; Then the solitary relicts turn
Seekers, whose unhappy fortune is never to find the folly of their new errors,
nor the ancient true Church way; which they proudly, or passionately, or
ignorantly lost, when they so easily forsook communion with the Catholic
Church, and with that part of it, to which they were peaceably, orderly, and
comlily united; as was here in England: Whose way of serving the true God, was
privately with knowledge, faith, love, and sincerity; publicly, with peace,
order, humility, and charity: Which might still with honor and happiness to
this Nation, be continued, if the proud hearts, and wanton heads, and rude
hands of some novel pretenders, had not sought to make the very name of
Christian Religion, the Reformed Church, and Ministry of England, a mere sport,
and may game, to the Popish, profane and looser world; by first stripping us of
all those Primitive Ornaments of gravity, order, decency, charity, good
government, unanimity; and then dressing us up, and impluming us with the
feathers of popular, and passionate fancies, which delight more in things gay
and new, than good and old.

But, how shall we do (say these Bodying-men, 29. Of Church Discipline, in whom
the Power. Matthew. 18.17. Tell it to the Church.
) to fulfill that command Dic Ecclesiae, for such a Church as may receive
complaints, hear causes of scandal, speedily reform abuses, restore defects,
execute all power of the Keys in the right way of Discipline? without which,
there is no true, at least, no complete and perfect Church; for these men
think, Christians can hardly get to Heaven, unless they have power among them,
to cast one another into Hell; to give men over to Satan, to excommunicate, as
they see cause; to open and shut Heaven and Hell gates, as they think fit: Must
all things that concern our Church (say they) lie at six and sevens, till we
get such Bishops and Presbyters, such Synods and Councils, such Representatives
of Learned men, as are hardly obtained; and as hard to be rightly ordered, or
well used, when they are met together? They had rather make quicker dispatches
in Church work; as if they thought it better for every family to hang and draw
within it self; and presently punish every offense, than for a whole Country to
attend, either general Assizes, or quarter Sessions.

Answ. Truly, good Christians in this Church (at present) are in a sad and bad
case too, as well as their Ministers, if they could make no work of Religion,
till they were happy to see all things of extern order and government duly
settled: Yet sure we may go to Church, and to Heaven too in our worst clothes,
if we can get no better; nor may we therefore wholly stay at home, and neglect
religious duties, because we cannot be so fine as we would be. Both Ministers
and people must do the best they can in their private spears, and particular
Congregations, to which they are related, whereby to preserve themselves, and
one another, as Brethren in Christ, from such deformities and abuses, as are
destructive to the power of godliness, the peace of conscience, and the honor
of the Reformed Religion; until the Lord be pleased to restore to this Church,
that holy Order, ancient Government, and Discipline, which is necessary, not to
the being of a Christian, or a true Church, as its form or matter (which true
Believers constitute by their internal union to Christ by Faith, and to all
Christians by Charity;) but only, as to the external form and polity, for the
peace, order, and well being of a Church; as it is a visible society, or holy
nation, and fraternity of men, 1 Pet. 2.9.
professing the truth of Jesus Christ. Yea, and Christians may better want
(that is, with less detriment or deformity to Religion,) that Discipline (which
some men so exceedingly magnify, as the very Throne, Scepter, and Kingdom of
Christ) under Christian Magistracy, (as they may the office of Deacons, where
the law by Overseers takes care for the poor) where good laws by civil power
punish public offenses, and repress all disorders in Religion, as well as
trespasses in secular affairs; Better, I say, than they could have been without
it in primitive times; when Christians had no other means, to repress any
disorders, that might arise in their societies; either scandalous to their
profession, or contrary to their principles; of which, no Heathen Magistrate,
or Humane Laws, took then any cognizance, or applied any remedy to them.

Not, but that I do highly approve, and earnestly pray for such good Order,
comely Government, and exact Discipline, in every Church, both as to the lesser
Congregations, and the greater Associations, (to which, all reasons of safety,
and grounds of peace, invite Christian Societies in their Church relations, as
well as in those of Civil,) which were anciently used in all settled, and
flourishing Churches; Much after that pattern, which was used among the Jews,
both in their Synagogues, which they had frequent, both in their own Land, and
among strangers in their dispersions; and also in their great Sanhedrim; which
was as a constant supreme Council, for ordering affairs, chiefly of Religion;
to one or both, which (no doubt) our Savior then referred the believing Jew,
in that of, Tell it to the Church; that is, after private monition, tell it to
the lesser Convention or Consistory in the Synagogues; which might decide
matters of a lesser nature; or to the higher Sanedrim, in things of more
public concernment; both which were properly enough called (...), Coetus
congregatio, (...), a Church, (...). Philo. Jud. calls them (...). Nihil hic a
Christo novum praecipitur, sed mos recte introductus probatur. H. Grot. in loc.
Ecclesiae, i. e. (...). Theoph. (...). Plato Every polity has in it power
enough to preserve it happiness. Coimus in co^tum and congregationem, Ibidem
orationes, exhortationes, castigationes, and censura divina: Praesident probati
quique seniores. Tert. Apol. Solebant Judaei res majoris momenti ultimo loco ad
(...) multitudinem refer: i. e. ad eos qui eadem instituta sestabantur;
quorum judicia and conventus seniores moderabantur, tanquam praesidet. Grot.
(...), Ign. Bas. in Chrysostom.
Beyond this sense, none could be made of Christ's words, by his then Auditors,
to whom he speaks, not by way of new direction, and institution of a Soverein
Court, or Consistory, in every Congregation of Christians to come; but by way
of referring, to a well known use, and daily practice, then among the Jews;
which was the only and best means wherein a Brother might have such
satisfaction, in point of any offense, which charity would best bear, without
flying to the Civil Magistrate, which was now a foreign power. When Jews turned
Christians, its very certain, they altered not their Discipline, and order (as
Christians) in Church society, from what they used before in their Synagogues.
Proportionably, no doubt, in Christian Churches, of narrower, or larger
extensions, and communion, among the Gentiles, the wisdom of Christ directs,
and allows such judicatories and jurisdictions, to prevent or remove all
scandals and offenses among Christians, to preserve peace and order, as may
have least of private or pedantick imperiousness, and vulgar trifflings of men,
unable and unfit to be in, or to exercise any such holy and divine authority
over others; (who are easily trampled upon, and fall into reproach, and the
snare of the Devil, by reason of diverse lusts, passions, weaknesses, and
temptations;) but rather Christ commends such grave Consistories, solemn
Synods, and venerable Councils, as consisting of wise, and able, and worthy
men, may have most, as of the Apostolical wisdom, eminency, gravity; so of
Christ's Spirit, Power, and Authority among them: Such, as no Christian with any
modesty, reason, conscience, or ingenuity can despise, or refuse to submit to
the integrity of their censure; when it is carried on, not with those heats,
peevishnesses, and emulations, which are usually among men of less improved
parts, or ripened years; especially, if Neighbors. Such a way, wisely settled in
the Church, might indeed bind up all things that concern Religion, in private
or more public respects, to all good behavior, in the bonds of truth, peace,
and good order, by a due and decent Authority; which, for every two, or three,
or seven Christians in their small Bodyings, and Independent Churches
(exlusively of all others) to usurp and essay to do, is, as if, of every chip
of Noah's Ark, or of every rafter of a great Ship, they would endeavor to make
up a very fit vessel to sail in any Sea and any weather.

30. The best method of Church Discipline. (...).
But take the true and wholesome Discipline of the Church, in those true
proportions, which pious antiquity settled and used; and which, with an easy
hand, by a little condescending, and moderation, on all sides, might have been
long ago, and still may be happily settled in England: Nothing is more
desirable, commendable, and beneficial to the Church of Christ; As a strong
case to preserve a Lute or Instrument in; that so the Church may not be broken,
disordered, or put out of tune by every rash and rude-hand, either in its
truth, or purity, or harmony; either in Doctrine, or Manners, or Order. But this
is a blessing, as not to be deserved by us, so hardly to be hoped, or expected,
amidst the pride, and passions, and fractions of our times: Nor will it be
done, till Civil powers make as much conscience to be good, as great; and to
advance Christian Religion, no less, than to enlarge, or establish Temporal
Dominion.

When such Magistrates have a mind, first to know, and then to set up a right
Church polity, power, and holy order, in every part and proportion of it: They
need not advise with such as creep into corners; or seek new models out of
little and obscure conventicles; nor yet ought they to confine themselves to
those feeble proportions, which are seen in the little Bodyings of these times;
which begin like Mushrooms, to grow up every where, and to boast of their
beauties, and rare figures; when nothing is more indigested, and ill compacted,
as to the general order, and public peace, of this or any other noble and
ample branch of the Catholic Church. Pious and learned Men, who reverence
antiquity, and know not yet how to mock either their Mother the Church, or
their Fathers, the true Bishops, Elders, and Ministers of it, can soon
demonstrate, how to draw forth that little chain of gold, (that charity,
communion, and orderly subordination among Christians) which at first
(possibly) might only adorn one single congregation of a few Christians, in
the primitive paucity and newer plantations; to such a largeness, amplitude,
and extension, as by the wisdom of Christian charity, and humility, shall
extend to, and comprehend in its compass, by way of peaceable union, and
harmony, or comely sub^ection, even the largest combinations, and furthest
spreadings of any branch of the Cathol ke Church: Both as to its greater and
lesser conventions; in several places and times; as the matters of Religion,
and occasion of the Churches shall require; according to its several
dispersions, and distinctions by place, or civil polity.

Matthew. 18.19.
Which greater, yet orderly conventions, must needs be as properly a Church; and
may meet, as much in Christ's Name; and hope for his presence and assistance in
the midst of them, as any of those Churches could among the Jews; (...). 2 Cor.

to which Christ properly refers in that place: Yea, they must needs be far
beyond any thing imaginable in the narrow confinements of Independent Bodies.

Such Churches then, of most select, wise, and able Christians, (who have the
consent and Representation of many lesser Congregations,) must needs do all
things with more wisdom, advice, impartiality, authority, reputation, majesty,
and general satisfaction; than any of those stinted Bodies of Congregational
Churches, can possibly do; yea, in all right reason they are as much beyond and
above them, as the power of a full Parliament, is beyond any Country Committee.
Those may with comely order, and due authority (which arises from the consent
of many men, much esteeming the known worth of others) give audience, receive
complaints, consider of, examine, reprove, reform, excommunicate, and restore,
where there is cause, and as the matters of the Church, more private or
public, require in the several divisions; extending its wings as an Eagle,
more or less, as there is cause; with infinite more benefit to the community of
Christians, than those Pullets, the short winged, and little bodied Birds of
the Independent feather, can do: Where without any warrant (that I know) from
God or Man, Religion or right Reason, Law or Gospel, Prudence or Charity, a few
Christians, by clucking themselves into a conventicle, shall presently seem a
complete body to themselves, and presume to separate and exempt themselves from
all the world of Christians, as to any duty, subjection, order, or obedience;
and pitching their Tents, where they think best, within the verge of any other,
never so well, and wisely settled Church, presently they shall raise themselves
up some small breast works of absolute Authority, which they fancy both parts
from, and defends them against all Churches in the World; planting their Wooden
or Leathern Guns of imaginary Independent power; and casting forth their
Grenades, or Squibs rather, of passionate censures, angry abdications, and
severe divorces against all Christians, Ibidem ( i. e. praesidentibus probatis
Senioribus) exhortationes, castigationes and censura divina. Nunc and judicatur

but those of their own way and party: Afterward they turn them, it may be,
against their own body and bowels, when once they begin to be at leisure to
wrangle and divide; As if (alas) these were the dreadful thunderbolts of
excommunication, anciently used with great solemnity, caution, deliberation,
and public consent: The great forerunner of Gods terrible, have judgment,
exercised with unfeigned pity, fervent prayers, and many tears, by those, who
had due eminency and authority, as presidents in chief, or seconds and
assistants, to judge and act in so weighty cases and matters. In which
transactions and censures, Churches Synodical, Provincial, and National, were
interessed, and accordingly being duly convened, they solemnly acted in Christ's
Name, as the offense, error, or matter, required remedy; either for errors, or
public disorders and scandals; which it concerned all Christians and Churches
to see repressed, or amended.

The wise and excellent Discipline of the Church, and the power of using and
applying of it, which so many now either vainly arrogate, or ambitiously Court,
was not of old as a bodkin put into every mechanics hands; or as a sword
committed to every brawny arm; nor yet, was it such a (brutum fulmen) a
thunderbolt which the confident hand of every factionist might take to himself
and Grasp, or use to his private revenge, or to the advantage of his party and
design: But Discipline, together with Government, in the Church, was only
committed and concredited, after the example of the Apostolic^all times, by the
wisdom, humility, consent, and subjection of all good Christians in their
several stations, either as Princes or Subjects, to those learned, grave, and
godly men, Bishops and Presbyters, who were ablest for gifts, eminentest for
their labors, and highest in place and Ministerial authority in the Churches
of Christ; whose assemblies or convenings, were greater or smaller, and their
influence accordingly obliging valid and effectual, for the good of those
Churches over which they were; ascending from the first and least Country
Congregations (as the smallest yet considerable branches of a visible Church,)
till it arose, like Ezekiels waters, from the Anckles, to the Knees, and Loins,
and Head, to such large, plenary, and powerful an Authority, as represented
many famous Churches; and sometimes the greatest and conversable parts of the
Catholic Church throughout the whole world; as in general Councils called
Oecumeniall.

Of Synods and Councils.
Out of which Synods and Councils however disorders and inconveniences (as
Nazianzene and others complain) cannot be wholly kept out (they still consisting
of sinful, and so frail men,) yet they were subject to far less evils, Cyp.

and Errataes, than attend the small scattered and separate bodies of there
later decimo sexto editions: In multitude of Counselors there is wisdom,
safety and honor. Prove. 11.14. Nor may we cast away, those goodly large Robes,
which the prudence and piety of the ancients made, because they are subject to
be soyled, or rent, by the hands of folly. It is better for the Church to enjoy
the gleanings of the ancients Integrity, Wisdom, and Charity, in ordering of
the Church, than to have the whole harvest of later men's sowings: which have
large straw of promises and shows, but little grain of solid benefit; yea much
cockle too, and many thistles of most choking and offensive consequences. The
very rags of true antiquity, do better cover the nakedness, and more adorn
thee body of any Church; than any of those cobweb-garments of later making;
which are torn in pieces, while they are putting on, and fitting to these new
bodies of odd shapen Churches. All reason and experience teaches, that those
grand communicative ways of Christian Churches in the joint Counsels of grave,
learned, and Godly men, drawing all into union, harmony, and peace, for the
public and general good, were far more probable (though (perhaps) not
absolutely necessary means) to preserve both the doctrine of Faith and good
manners unblameable among Christians, than any of those small and broken
Potsheards of private Independency can be; which carry little ability, and as
little authority or virtue with them: appearing like the Serpents teeth, sown
by Cadmus, every where rising up in armed parties, divided against, and
destroying one another; till they have cleared the Field, as of all such new,
and angry productions; so of all those ancient and excellent constitutions of
Christian Churches; which were bound up as Bibles in greater, or lesser volumes.

It being so natural to all men, to affect, what they call liberty and power;
if once mean men can by any arts obtein any shadow of them, they are (out of
the show of much zeal and conscience) most pragmaticall; And first begin to
think no Church well reformed, unless they bring them to their models; Then
their model must be new; lest their Authors should seem to have been idle;
being always more concerned for the reformation of any men, than of
themselves; God grant that while temerity and confidence pretends to plant none
but new and rare flowers, and to root up all old ones as ill weeds, in the
Church, that themselves and their odd inventions, with their rash abolitions,
prove not at last the most noxious plants that ever pestered the Garden of this
Church.

To what some men urge (by abusing that text against the good Orders, Canons,
and Constitutions or Customs of the Church, 31. Of prudence in ordering the
Church affairs. Mat. 15.13.
) That every plant, which the Father has not planted, shall be pulled up;
therefore say they, nothing of humane prudence is tolerable in the ordering of
any Church; I answer; first, none of those that quarrelled at the Church of
Englands Motes, but are thought by many learned and Godly men to have beams in
their own eyes; if Scripture, right reason, and antiquity may judge: for
nothing is alleged as more different from any of these amongst us; than what
may be found among the new Modellers; who as they were in number and quality
much inferior, so they were never thought more wise, or learned; nor so calm
and composed; nor so public and unpassionate in their Counsels and
determinations; as those many excellent men and Churches were, both ancient and
modern; to whose examples, agreeable to the Canon of the Scriptures, the Church
of England was conformed. n his rebus in quibus nihil certi statuit Scriptura,
mos populi Dei, vel instituta majorum pro lege tenendi sunt. Aug. Ep. 89.
Disciplina nulla est melior gravi prudentique viro in his quae liberas habent

observandum est. Aust. Ep. 118. ad Jan. Salva fidei regula de D sciplina

Furthermore, The great Motor of some men's passion, zeal, and activity against
this Reformed Church, was, that one Error, against the judgment, liberty, and
practice of all antiquity, which is fundamental, as to the Churches polity and
extern Peace; namely, That nothing may be used in the Church as to externals,
which is not expressly and precisely commanded in the word; Which yet themselves
observe not, when they come to have power either to form and act; some things
they take in upon prudentiall account, as their Church Covenant, of the form
and words of which they are not yet agreed, which they urge; so their requiring
each Member to give an account, not of the historical belief of the truth,
but, of the work of grace, and conversion, which no Scripture requires, or
Church ever practiced: That of St. Austin has been often inculcated by many
learned, quiet, and godly men in this Church of England, and elsewhere, as a
most certain truth; That however the Faith, Doctrine, Sacraments, and Ministry
of the Church, are precisely of divine Institution; rising from a divine
Spring, and conveyed in a like sacred Current, which ows nothing to the wisdom,
policy, power, or authority of man; yet the extern dispensation of this Faith,
Sacraments, and divine Ministrations, together with the fence and hedge of
them, the necessary Government, Order, and Discipline of the Church, in its
parts and in the whole, these do fall much under the managing of right reason,
rules of good order, and common prudence, all which attends true Religion; So
that they neither have, nor needed, nor indeed were easily capable of such
positive, precise and particular precepts or commands, as these men fancy; and
by this pertinacious fancy they have cast great snares on the consciences of
many; great scandals on the Churches, both ancient and modern; and great
restraints on that l berty, which Jesus Christ left to his Churches in these
things; according, as various occasions and times might require.

Sumus and homines and ci^es cum fimus Ch^istiani. Salv.
None but foolish and fanatic men can think, that when men turned Christians,
they ceased to be men; or being Christian men, they needed not still to be
governed, both as Christians, and as men; by reason joined to Religion; which
will very well agree; carrying on Re igious ends, by such prudent and
proportionate means, and in such good order, as is agreeable to right reason;
and the general directions of Religion; which never abandoned, or taught any
Christian to start at, and abhor, Naturae l^^en, and rationis radios, non
extinguit sed excitat Religio, quae non vera tantum sed and decora postulat.
Aust. Phil. 4.8. (...), etc. (...), etc. Whatsoever things are true, honest, or
comely, just, pure, lovely, of good report; if any virtue, any praise, think on
these things; or meditate with reason and judgment.(...).
what is taught by the very light of nature, and those common principles of
reason, and order, or polity; which teach the way of all Government and
subjection; either of younger to the elder (whence is the very ground of all
Presbytery) or of weaker to the stronger; or of the foolisher to the wiser, or
of the ignorant to the learned; or of many to some few, for the good of all:
None of which methods can cross Religion; nor being observed in some due
measure, can be blamed; nor ought factiously to be altered, by the members of
any settled Church; in which there is, neither Apostasy from the Faith, nor
recession from the Scriptures, nor alteration of the substance of Christ's holy
Institution; which this Church of England not-being guilty of, but apparently
professing, and fully adhering to the Scriptures, as the ground, rule, and
limit of Faith, and holy Mysteries; We doubt not, but, however it used the
wisdom of learned, wise, and holy men; and followed the warrant of the
Primitive Churches, in the extern manner and methods of holy Administrations,
Government, and Discipline; yet it may, and ought still, as it does, lay claim
to the right and honor of an eminent part of the true Catholic Church of
Christ, having a true Ministry, and true Ministrations: In which, I believe,
all the Apostles, and Primitive Martyrs, and Confessors in all Ages, would most
willingly have owned and approved; yea, the Great God from Heaven has attested
it, and still does to the consciences of thousands of excellent Christians,
which have had their birth and growths to Religion, in this Church of England.

So that the outcries, abhorrencies, and extirpations, carried on so eagerly
against the main constitution, frame, and Ministry of this Church, by many,
(who now appear to be men of little charity, and strong passions, and very weak
reason,) as if we were allover Popish, Superstitious, Antichristian, altogether
polluted, intolerable, etc. Those calumnies and clamors, wanted both that
truth, that caution, and that charity, which should be used, in any thing,
tending to disturb, or discourage any true Christian, or Church of Christ;
whose differences in some small external things from us, in judgment or
practice, we ought to bear upon the account of those many great things, in
which we agree with them, as Christians: Nor ought poor men, of private parts
and place in Church and State, so to swell, at any time, with the thought of
any Liberty and Power in common, given them from Christ (to reign with him, or
to reform, etc.) as to drive, like tipsy Mariners, those rightful Pilots from
the Helm; or to break their card, and compass, of ancient design, draught, and
form, by which they steered as they ought, or as they could, in the distress of
times. And this only, That these new undertakers may try, how they can
delineate new carts, or maps; and how soon they can over-whelm or over-set, so
fair, rich, and goodly a Vessel, as this Church of England once was in the eye
of all the World, but our own. This Island was not more nobly eminent, than the
Church was great in Britany: The leaks, chinks, and decays, which befall all
things in time, might easily have been stopped, calked, and trimmed, by skilful
and well-advised hands; when once it was fairly and orderly brought upon the
Public stocks, and into a Parliament Dock; which good men hoped, of all
places, would not prove either a quick-sand, or a rock to the Reformed Church,
or the Learned Ministry of England.

But the Lord is just, though we should be confounded in our confidences of
men; though neither mountains, nor hills, nor valleys can help, yet will we
trust in God, who is our God in Christ; who (we doubt not, but) in mercy will
own us, with all our frailties and defects, as his true Church, and true
Ministers: And if in any thing we have failed, as men; yet we are assured, the
merciful eye of Heaven will look more favorably on our failings, to pardon
them, than some Basilicks do on our labors, to accept them; Jere. 1 8. Be not
afraid of their faces, for I am with thee, to deliver thee, says the Lord. V.

who seek to destroy this Church, and discourage all its true Christians and
Ministers, if they could, with their dreadful aspects, and spightful looks; if
they had not the defensative of Gods protection joined to their own innocence;
and the favor of many excellent Christians; whom I have endeavored to settle
and satisfy, as briefly and clearly, as in so short a time I could, in these
many, and to me very tedious, and almost superfluous objections, against this
true Reformed Church of England; these first and lesser calumnies, which lay in
the way of my main design, I thought it my duty to remove.

32. Want of Charity our greatest defect. In the Council of Carth^ge, An. 401.
The Orthodox Christians send Messengers to the Donatists: (...). So after, they
send ( An. 404.) Orators for unity and peace; without which, say they,
Christian Religion cannot consist.
Where, I see, in all our disputes and differences, so cruelly carried on, the
greatest ingredient is Uncharitableness; which knows not how to excuse small
faults, to supply lesser defects, to interpret well what is good, to allow
others their true Christian Liberty, and to enjoy its own modestly; to keep
communion amidst some easy differences, and union with harmless varieties. We
have had on all sides truth enough to have saved any men; and uncharitableness
enough to have damned any angels: Nor is it merely a privation, or want of
charity, but an abounding of envy, malice, strife, wrath, bitterness, faction,
fury, cruelty, and whatever is most contrary to the excellency of Christians,
which was the excellency of Christ; love and charity. The want of which, Basil.
Mag. de Sp. S. deplores, (...). So Naz. Or. 12. (...), etc. (...). Naz. Or. 28.
(...). Clem. Alex. (...). 5. says, Religion, as a Tripos, has three feet,
Faith, Hope, and Charity; and cannot stand if any one be wanting.
I cannot but here deplore in a pathetick digression; craving the Readers
pardon, since I cannot go further in answer of uncharitable objections, till I
have first sought for our lost charity: The recovery of which one grace would
end all the differences, and heal all the distempers, not of England only, but
of all the Christian World. You, O excellent Christians, will, I know, join
with me in searching after charity, as they did after Christ, sorrowing, Luke
2.48. In mourning for, as some of the devout ancients did, the sad distances,
and wastes of Christian charity, among all sorts of Christian Churches, and
Professors. Alas, we glory, and swell, and are puffed up one against another,
in the forms of being called Churches and Reformed; when we lose the very power
of godliness, the soul of religion, and the peculiar glory of Christianity,
which is charity. Joh. 13.35. By this shall all men know that you are my
disciples, etc.

O sweet, divine, and heavenly beauty of Christ, and all true Christians
(Charity:) Whither art thou fled, from Christians breasts, 33. Pathetick for
Charity. (...). Greg. Niss. (...). Clem. Al. (...). l. 3. c. 1. Salvian

lives, hearts, and Churches? In which was wont to be thy Nest, thy Palace, and
thy Temple: Where thou were received, welcomed, and entertained, by wise and
humble Christians, either as the Spouse of Christ, in thy purity; or as the
Queen of graces, in thy beauty; or as the Goddess of Heaven, in thy majesty. O
whither art thou gone? where art thou retired? Art thou to be found in the
cells of Hermites, in the Cloisters of Monks, in the solitudes of Anchorites?
(Probably, there may be most of thee, where is least of the world; which like
full diet, begets most of choleric and foul humors:) Do thou reside among
the pompous Papists? The graver Lutherans? the preciser Calvinists? the severer
Separatists? or, the moderater English Christians? May we find thee at Rome,
or Wittemberg, or Geneva, or Amsterdam, or London? Do thou dwell in the old
Palaces, and Councils of venerable Bishops? or in the newer Classes of bolder
Presbyters? or in the narrower corners of subtle Independents? Alas, I fear
these very colors and names, which are as ensigns and alarms to factions,
sound ill in the ears of Charity, and are unpleasing to its sight; which only
loves the first common title and honor of Disciples, to be called Christians.
These faces and forms, seem as if they were divided, and set one against
another; and when they want a common adversary, each party is ready to
subdivide, and seeks to destroy it self; the hand of every faction in Religion,
is as Ismaels against his Brother, or it self. Smiting often with the fist of
violence, as Factious; where they should give the right hand of fellowship, as
Christians; and strangling each other, instead of embracing.

Or are all these divisions, but the disguises of Charity? and under visords of
factions, a mere pageantry is acted of zealous ignorance, or proud and
preposterous knowledge; both carried on with holy partialities, fraternal
Schisms, zealous cruelties, sacred conspiracies; so far only, as to destroy
all other Christians; That each sect alone may remain, as the only Church;
which then fancy themselves sufficiently built, polished, and reformed, when
they are but as heaps of rubbish, in their several ruptures; as unpolished
lumps in their uncharitable sidings; so far weak and deformed limbs, as they
are passionatly and violently broken from the intireness and goodly fabric of
the well compacted Catholic Church, of which they were sometime a comely and
commendable part: Only then in beauty, safety, and symmetry, while in order
to, and in unity with the whole; which is as the Body and Temple of the Lord,
in its various parts, making but one goodly structure, which was anciently the
^oy, and glory of the whole Earth. Now, nothing seems best, but deformed
ruins, and desolate parcels, of battered, broken, and almost demolished
Churches, like Hospitals, in which, are most-what wounded, and maimed, and
halting Christians; when of old, the Foundation of one, Romans 13.10. Love is the
fulfilling of the Law. Quicquid deficiunt aliae, unica supplet charitatis
gratio, qua in aeternum non de ficiet. Bern. (...). Nis. Prius chari qua^
proximi. Min. Fael. (...). Just. M. T^ypl. o.
and all Churches, was Scripture Truth, the Cement Charity, the Beauty Unity,
and the Strength, orderly and social Government.

O thou fairest of ten thousands (Christian Charity) which were the wonder of
the World in the Primitive times! Which did so spread thy wings over all the
Earth, like the Spirit of God, on the face of the great deep, the ocean of
mankind, that every man might, and every Christian did enjoy, the vital heat,
and diviner influence of thy fosterings on their souls; So far, that what
weaker Christians came short of in believing, or failed in understanding, or
were defective in doing, they made up in loving of Christ; and for his sake one
another: Yea, what the very enemies and persecutors of Christians wanted, of
that humanity, (which is as the morn, and dawning of Christian Charity,) true
Christians sought to relieve them by their prayers, and to cover their horrid
cruelties with their own kindness to them, while killed by them; and devotions
for them, while they were dying under them, as the b^essed Martyr Stephen did,
and the Crown of Martyrs, Christ Jesus. They forgot not to pray for those that
persecuted them; which made Christians in their furthest dispersions, greatest
distances, and grievousest sufferings, still admired by all men, though hated
by them; still endeared, well acquainted, and united in love to each other,
before they had seen, or were personally known to each other.

O thou potent flame of celestial fire, which the love of Christ, Charitas est
oleum unde clara virtutu^ omnium lampas sustentatur. Religio sine charitate est
lampas sine oleo. Bern. ep. 42. (...). Naz. Or. 28. So Just. Martyr, Ep. ad
Diog. (...). Naz. Or. 14.
stronger than death, had kindled in the souls of the first and best
Christians! No Seas, no solitudes, no poverty, no pains, no sufferings, no
torments, no offenses, no injuries, were able to damp, or quench thee of old;
but still thou did gloe to so fresh an heat, that it warmed and melted the
hardest Rocks of Heathen persecutors and tormentors: Who before they believed
the Gospel, or love of God in Christ, covered to be of that Christian society,
where they saw men love one another so dearly, so purely, so constantly, as to
be ready to die with, and for each other. Alas, now every small drop of fancy,
every novelty of fashion in Religion, every atome of Invention, every dust of
Opinion, every mote of Ceremony, every shadow of Reformation, every difference
of Practice, damps, rakes up, buries, puts out thy sacred sparks and embers, in
Christians hearts; yea, and kindles those unholy, cruel, and dreadful fires of
contrariety, jealousies, scorn, hatred, enmity, revenge, impatience of union,
and zeal for separation; to so great heights of all-devouring flames, that
nothing but the flesh of Christians will serve for fuel to maintain them; and
nothing but the blood of Believers to extinguish them: So that no Christians
now love further than they conspire and contend to destroy and conquer all, but
their own party and faction.

Thus the want of this holy grace of charity, wastes us by the fires of
unchristian fewds; and even presages the approaching of those last dreadful
conflagrations, which shall consume the world; and those eternal flames, which
shall revenge this sin of sins among Christians, the want of charity; which
sins against the love of God, the blood of Christ, the Churches peace, and our
own souls: How shall we uncharitable wretches, not dread the coming of our
Judge? or how can we love his appearance in flaming fire, who have thus singed
and burnt that livery of Christ's love, wherewith we were clothed? which was
dipped and died in his own blood; that so it might stanch the further effusions
of blood among Christians; and cover the stayns of that blood, which had been
passionatly shed among them? How can we hope our souls should be saved in the
day of the Lord Jesus, when we spend our days in damming and destroying each
other? and scarce suffer any to possess their souls in patience, or in any
degree of charity, amidst the wastes and troubles of this conflicting and
tottering Church; Which, like a great tree, whose roots are loosned round, and
almost cut through, stagger too and fro; threatening to fall on every side;
being nothing now, but weakness over-laden with weight; and laboring with the
burden of it self, is ready to destroy both it self and others by the
suddenness and violence of its fall: O you excellent Christians, hasten, as Lot
should have done out of Sodom, to withdraw your selves from the interests,
designs, zeal, devotion and Religion of this uncharitable and self destroying
world; wrap your selves in the mantle of charity, peaceableness and patience,
hasten to hide your selves in the holes of this rock, the love of Christ your
Redeemer, till he come, who is at the door and will not tarry.

O precious and inestimable grace of Charity, the only Jewel of our lives; the
viaticum for our Deaths; the greatest ornament of a Christian profession; the
sweetness of our bitterness, the Antidote of our poisons, the Cordial in our

fears and conflicts of our mortal Pilgrimage; In which we then only joy, when
we either love, or are loved by others; but then we have most cause of pious
joy, when being hated, and cursed, and persecuted by others, we can yet love
them, and pray for them, and bless them for Christ's sake. Thou that made
Martyrs, and Confessors, and all true Christians, more than Conquerors, of
death, and enemies, men, and Devils; O how have we lost thee? how have we
banished thee? how have we not injured thee? yea, how have we grieved thee more
in this, that we are loath to find thee; But most in this, that we seek thee
among Heresies, Schisms, Apostacies, seditions, furies, perjuries, tyrannies,
superstitions, sacrileges, causeless disputes, endless janglings; yea cruel
murders of bodies, and Anathemaes of souls? But the highest indignity, and
greater than the greatest insolency offered thee, is, That we boast, and
proclaim we have found thee, in what we have most lost thee; that we have
raised thee, by what we have ruined thee; that we are most Churches, when we
are least Christians; or most Christians, when we have least of a Church; in
our preposterous zeals, our hypocritical charities, our deformed reformings,
our distorted bodyings, our distracted communions, our divided unions, our
fanatic dreams, our blasphemous raptures, our profane enthusiasms, our
licencious liberties, our injurious indulgences, our irrational, and
irreligious confusions; our cruel toleratings of any thing, rather than sober
abiding, growing, and flourishing in truth, which is thy root; in humility,
which is thy flower; and in well doing, which is thy fruit.

Thou were wont to come to us Christians, and by us to others, in the cool of
the day, in a still voice, in meek intreatings, in gentle beseechings, like the
sweet dew on herbs, or soft rain on the tender Grass; so that, however
Christians might be exceeded by other men, in strength, beauty, learning,
eloquence, and policy, yet none equalled them in Charity; which has the
greatest courage joined with the greatest kindness; and only knows how to
crucify it self, that it may spare others; to deny it self, that it may gratify
others: Have thou now chosen to come in Earthquakes, in Whirl-winds, in
Thunders, and Lightnings, and Fires, in tumults, in hideous clamors and Wars?
do thou delight to wrap thy self in the Garments of Christians rolled in
blood? to besmear thy fair and orient face with the gore and dust of
fratricides and patricides? Is it thy pleasure to hide thy self in the thick
clouds and darkness of Religious plots, reforming pretensions, and then to
break forth with lightnings and hot thunderbolts, with Hailstones and Coals of
fire? As if the inseparable twins of the love of God and our neighbor were now
parted, or had slain and devoured one the other; Are all thy sweet perfumes,
thy fragrant Ointments, (which were wont to be diffused from the head of our
Aaron Christ Jesus, to the skirts of his Garments, the lowest and meanest
Christians) are they now all distilled and sublimated by our hotter brains and
Chimicall fires, into this one drop of self preservation? Have thou lost those
Characters, which the blessed Apostle sometime gave thee, for long suffering,
for kindness; for not envying, not vanting, not being puffed up; for not
behaving thy self unseemly, not seeking thine own; not easily provoked,
thinking no evil, rejoicing not in iniquity, but in the truth; Bearing all
things, believing all things, hoping all things, enduring all things? Is thy
purity embased with the love of the world, of money, of honor, of pleasure, of
applause, of victory, through self-love? Thou that were wont to be that pure
Christalline and celestial love of God, and of man for Gods sake; art thou now
degenerated to sordid, sensual, and momentary lusts? Thou that did feed
among the Lillies, on the mountains of Spices, in the Garden of God, on the
tree of life, the love of God in Christ, with eyes and hands intent to Heaven,
praising God for his love to thee, and praying for the like love to others; art
thou now condemned to the Serpents curse, to go on thy Belly, to feed on the
dust; to make gain thy godliness, 1 Timothy 6.5.
and to turn even piety it self into the poison of mere self-preservation, in
worldly interests? How is thy voice changed from that of a Lamb, to the roaring
of a Lion? thy hands from Jacob's smoothness, to Esau's roughness?

Or is this rather none of thy voice, which we daily hear? Are these none of
thy hands, O most unchangeable Charity, who art always the same in thy self,
and to others? Are they not the voice and hands of thy disguised enemies,
tempting us with the Serpents subtilty; beguiling us with the fallacy of
ravening Wolves, covered in Sheeps clothing, and bleating instead of howling,
yet with no less purpose to devour? whose bowels are of brass, their hearts of
Adamant, their Foreheads of Flint, their Teeth and Claws of Iron; There Feet
are swift to shed blood, yea they are dipped in the blood of Christians? Thou
that were wont to have but one Head, the Lord Jesus Christ; and but two Hands,
the right Hand of affiance, leaning on God; the lest of pity, supporting the
weak Brother; art thou now grown monstrous like Hydra, with many Heads, and as
many stings? like Briareus, with many Hands, and as many Swords? mutually
fighting, though seeming to branch from, and adhere to the same body of
Christianity? Is thy God now to be appeased with humane sacrifices, or will he
drink the blood of Christians, Mat. 5.23. 1 Cor. 13.3.
who would not accept a gift at the altar, till the offerer had first
reconciled himself to his Brother? will he now accept the heads of those that
are slain by us, Nec Martyrium absque charitate coronandu^. B^c. Ep. 7.
who would not Crown Martyrdom it self, if the Garland of Charity had not first
adorned it on earth, and so fitted it for suffering; and by patient suffering,
for glory in the Heavens?

Gratia est quod vivimus, quod val^mus, quod pugnamus, quod coronamur. Chrysostom.
O let not the Christian world thus mistake thee; rather let them never speak or
think of thee, than thus injure thee, while they pretend to advance thee; we
know, O blessed Charity, that thou art wholly made up of the love and free grace
of God, by the merits of Jesus Christ, and the liberal effusions of the holy
Spirit; having in thee as no ingredients of humane merits, so less of humane
passions, secular ends, and partial interests; O show thy self in thy own
innocent sweetness, in thy pious simplicities, in thy lovely lineaments, with
thy harmless hands, with thy beautiful feet, which carry the message of good
tidings, the Gospel of Peace, which have the marks of the Lord Jesus on them;
which art wholly made up of softness and sweetness; warming us by the light of
the Truth, and melting us by the warmth of Christ's love; set forth thy self in
thy sober smiles, (...).
thy modest eyes, thy soft and silken words, thy silent-tears, thy clean hands,
thy tender steps; How can we love thee, unless we see thee, like thy self? How
can we not love thee, if once we be happy to see thee, as thou art! O hide not
thy self from us, though we have abused thee and mocked thee, and scourged
thee, and crowned thee with thorns, and clothed thee with Purple raiment, died
in the blood of Christians; though we have pierced thy heart, and almost
destroyed thee, so that thou art forced to fly from us naked and wounded;
Though we have not only forsaken thee, but driven thee from us; not only lost
thee, but are loath to find thee, and joy in thy loss, and are afraid of thy
return: yet since thou art Charity, that is, all divine sweetness, kindness and
goodness, do not utterly forsake us, the scattered and torn remnant of
surviving Christians; Are our distances more unreconcileable, than those were
between God and Sinners? yet these thou have composed, by that blood of
atonement, which Christ the Son and love of God shed for us, to redeem us out
of all Nations tongues and people; who has given us this badge of his
Disciciples, to love one another; Joh. 13.35.
not with private and Schismatic factiousness, but with public and
Catholic affections, which reach as far as the Name of Christ is owned: Thou
art not only an Angel ascending up to Heaven in the love of God, but also
descending down to men, chiefly to the fraternities of Christians; Nor is the
stream of thy sweetness, which flows with Milk and Honey, only diffused upon
the Church triumphant, the blessed Angels, and Souls of just men made perfect,
who are ever bathed in an Ocean of thy Nectar, which is infinite love; but thou
have also received gifts for men; and have effusions of love to soften our hard
hearts, to supple our brawny hands, to clear out polluted consciences, and to
cheer up our Cainish countenances.

Better we had been among the slain, Procellae, tenebrae, mortes, tormenta,
Gehennaein sunt animae in qua charitas non remanet, and regnat. Fulg.
that are gone down to the Pit, and covered in darkness, with the dust of
death, than, to live without thee; whose presence makes our moment here to be
Heaven, and thy absence makes our after eternity to be Hell; O let not the
cruel, factious, profane, and Atheistical world say, That thou, the Charity
of Christians, were never beyond a fable, a meteor in their fancies, a morning
dew falling from their lips; or a melancholy softness, a pusillanimous pity, a
devout cowardice; As if Christians were kind no longer, than they wanted power
to be cruel; and humbly obeyed no longer, than they wanted opportunity to be
proudly rebellious against those, whom they feared more as slaves, than loved
as Christians.

Is there nothing in thy ingenuous wisdom (which delightest to do best, and
most, where men merit least) by which to bring back those ( Theriandri,
Anthropophagi, or Lycanthropi) those men, that are become savage of civil;
those Christians, that are turned Tigers, and Lions, and Bears, and Wolves,
degenerated far from the pristine shape and forms which they had, of meek Lambs
and Sheep? O bring forth those excellent eye salves, by which thou did of old
open the eyes of the blind, and barbarous Heathens. Show to the deformed
Christians of this metamorphosed age, thy primitive beauties; the attractives
of thy meekness, the charms of thy gentleness, the trophies of thy patience,
forbearances, and brotherly kindness; bring forth the Magazins of thy mercies,
bowels of pity, tenderness, tears; use thy honest frauds, thy pious crafts, 2
Cor. 12.16.
thy Dove-like arts, thy Saint-like policies, of self denial, courtesy,
modesty, giving and forgiving; Quanto magis regnum cupiditatis destruitur,
tanto charitatis augetur. Austin. de doct. Christiano. (...), de Christianis.
Just. M. ad Diog. (...) Just. in Apol. Mark. 13.22.
by which means Christians ever flourished in grace, abounded in comforts, and
though they were destroyed and persecuted, yet still they were emulated and
renowned; (O remove the paints, and veils, and masks, and shadows, the deceits
and dawbings, which are upon the face of Christian Religion; which is indeed
nothing without thee; a mere mockery of graces, a pageantry of virtue; a
phantasm of courage, a delusion of zeal, a shadow of reformation; fitted only
to deceive, if it were possible, even the very elect,) If thy torments and
blood-sheds, and deaths of old, will not serve to moysten and enlarge the dried
and contracted bowels of modern Christians, to mollify their hearts, to calm
their spirits, and to sweeten their looks to one another; O show them thy later
foul scratches, thy fresh wounds, thy grievous reproaches, thy many bleedings,
thy deep stigmatizings; thy prisons, thy piercings, thy dyings, thy
crucifyings, all which thou have received in the house of thy friends, by the
hands of thy friends, even such as are called Christians, but can hardly be
counted, charitable: which have brought thee and us to these fears, and
tremblings, and paleness, and despairs, as if God, and Christ, and Gospel, and
Ministry, and Heaven, and salvation, and true Religion, were all departing with
thee, which are thy inseparable companions.

1 Pet. 1.29. Obstinati animi and adamantina corda, minis duriora, and monicis
pejora, solo Christi sanguine conspersa emolliuntur. Bern. O duri, and indurati
and obdurati filii Adam; quos non emollit tanta benignitas, tanta flamma, tam
ingens ardor, tam vehem^ns amator; quem nec agon, ^e crux, nec mors terruit,
quin te amaret. Acts 3.15. and 19. 1 John 3.16. 1 John 3.19.
If these will not move Christians to look after thee, or at least to pity
thee, and to pray for thee (or rather for themselves in thee:) yet have thou
one holy Relic of infinite merit, incomparable worth, and inestimable value;
set forth this to the blood-shotten eyes of the Christian world; even Jesus
Christ crucified for them, and professed by them to be their common Savior:
Possibly his precious blood sprinkled on their consciences, may (as water on
lime) slake, and dissolve, that fiery Spirit, and flinty Heart, which is among
them; Nothing can work such miracles, as this age wants, but only the cross,
and wounds, and agony, and sweats, and tears, and blood, and death of Jesus
Christ; whose love used the malice and cruelty of his enemies, for an
instrument to kill him, that he, being slain by them, might merit life for
them; that by this act of highest uncharitableness in man, to kill his Savior,
Christ might set forth his other-wayes unexpressible Charity toward men, by
saving his destroyers; his love being stronger than death; and giving us hereby
a pattern how we should be disposed to one another, not only when friends, but
also when enemies; Rather to dye for them in away of charity, which is a beam
of divine mercy; than to kill them, even in away of equity, which is but a
stroke of humane justice; but least of all should we destroy our Brother, in
away of policy, passion, and malice, which is devilish cruelty; Since to hate
our Brother, is murder, as he is a man, sure not only to hate, but even for
Religion sake to kill our brother, a Christian, must be a crucifying afresh the
Lord of Life; who died for his Church: So then, uncharitable destroyers of
Christians, are rather Deicides, than Homicides.

If all this move not those, that are called Christians, 1 John 3.16. Hereby we
perceive the love of God, because he laid down his life for us, and we ought to
lay down our lives for the brethren. (...). Naz. Or. 16. Isai. 32.2.
Beatitudinum omnium beatissima beatitudo charitas. Nienburg.
to lay down their malice, factions, and arms, against each other; for whom
Charity and Christ bids them lay down their lives; O let it move all excellent
Christians, (and me, who am less than the least) that truly love thee, and long
for thee, to mourn to see the generality of Christians so little moved by thee,
or to thee: Let our heads and eyes, be as Fountains and Rivers of Waters,
running with tears night and day, for those thousands, whom justice; and those
ten thousands, whom uncharitableness, schism, and superstition, have slain
among Christians, even in these Nations and Churches. O let our humble hearts
be thy retirement; our sighs, and prayers, and tears, thy refreshment, in the
heat and fury of these times; and be thou to us, as the shadow of that great
Rock in a weary Land.

O blessed Blessing of all other blessings, Charity; what words, what tears,
what prayers, what sighs, what Sermons, what Writings can recover thee, or
recall thee, or persuade thee to look back, and return to these, and others
pitifully broken, wasted, forlorn, and divided Churches? But alas, our words
are sharp swords, daily wheting, and clashing against each other; our tears
are, as the drops of revengeful and impatient spirits, which cannot have their
wills; our prayers are the bitter effusions of hearts troubled and disquieted,
not with sin, but with choler and unkindness; so far from praying for our
enemies, that we pray nothing but enmity; and are impatient that any should
pray for their friends, if we esteem them our enemies; our sighs are but
bellows, to excite the languishing flames of declining factions, against their
opposers; our Sermons oftimes are as firebrands tossed up and down by
incendiaries; and the breath of our Pulpits, are like the Eructations of Aetna,
Vesuvius or Hecla, scattering coals of fire, and blasting all things near them
with sulphurous exhalations: So that many Preachers are, indeed, as voices
crying in the wilderness; sounding alarms to Religious War; and preparing a way
for zealous desolations, both in Church and State; And for our Writings, they
are in great part but Pamphlets, which serve as Paper to wrap up squibs, or to
kindle to quicker flames, those smoking jealousies and secret discontents,
which are smothered in our breasts: That even we Christians, and reformed too,
speak, and act, and pray, and Preach and Print, in great part, so, as if we had
not one God, and one Lord Jesus, one Spirit, one Faith, and one Baptism, etc.
Ephesians. 4.4, 5.
But, as if we had no God, no Faith, no Word, no Sacrament, no common relation
to one Savior, no common salvation in One, and by One; as if we were
Christians, only to be crosses, and to crucify one another: As if we were all
turned Canaanites, scourges in the sides, and thorns in the eyes of one another.

Charitas deus est substantivs, and dat nobis deitatem accident^lem. Bern. de
dil. Deo.
O thou flower and fragrancy of all graces and virtues; which have little of a
Man, nothing of a Devil, and most of God, of Christ, and of the Holy Spirit in
thee; which carriest all sweetness, serenity, and tranquillity with thee: If
thou abhorrest the crowds of Christians, and such as glory so much in their
being gathered into Churches after new and uncouth ways; If thou dare not
trust their smiles and kisses, their fervors and reformings, who have so often,
under the specious pretenses of Religion, sheathed their swords in thy bowels;
If thou art afraid, not only of religious rabbles, and zealous multitudes, but
even of sacred Synods, and Armies listed for holy Wars, whose faith has often
failed thee and them too; who while they thought to contend earnestly for the
truth, have crushed thee, O Charity, almost to nothing, by their violences, and
divisions; each novel faction seeming to strive for thee, pull and tear thee in
pieces, ready by violent halings of thee to their sides Sects, utterly to
destroy thee;

O yet prepare a place for thy self among some humble and honest hearts, some
meek and quiet spirits here in England; that so thou may retire and hide thy
self, from thy friendly enemies, from their cruel courtesies, their dangerous
importunities, their deep agitations, and designs. O disdain not the broken
hearts and contrite spirits, of that remnant of truly Reformed, Catholic, and
charitable Christians, which yet have escaped in this Church. These value thee,
these long for thee, these are sick of love to thee, and weary of life without
thee. To thy honor and restoration, to their comfort and establishment, these
lines are chiefly consecrated: O do thou cover them, James 3.6. Psalm. 120.7. I
am for peace, but when I speak, they are for war.
and this thy suppliant Orator, under the shadow of thy wings (till this
calamity be overpast) hide us from the strife of tongues which are set on fire
with the fire of hell; which burn most, when cool drops, and calm pleas for
charity, are sprinkled on them.

In the great and sad ruins of Churches, and dissentions of Christians, O be
thou our refuge and protection; teach us to live by divine love; and so to love
thee, that we may live a divine (...) with thee: Learn us that highest lesson
of a Christian to love our enemies, and persecutors; while others learn to hate
their friends, and their Fathers.

1 Cor. 13.8. Charity never be fails.
O Sempiternal Grace, which are fitted for immortal souls; let us be (as Ruth to
Naomi) unseparable from thee, while we are on Earth; as thou art the only
remaining grace in Heaven; being the crown and consummation of all other gifts
and graces; which, like stars, then disappear, and are willingly swallowed up,
when thy luster, like the Suns, is risen to its full strength, and shines in an
eternal Noon, making the soul at once infinitely happy, while it sees an object
infinitely lovely, and loves it with an infinite love. Rather than we should
fail of thee in this life (O thou beloved of our souls) carry us with thee,
from Cities, to solitudes; from company, to deserts; from the unsociable
societies, and uncharitable Churches, to creeping cottages, to weeping
solitudes, and howling wildernesses; where we may enjoy thee in our own often
sighing, and smitten breasts, rather than dwell in Palaces, and Cities, and
Temples, and where we see thee daily despised, profaned, and mangled;
tormented, torn, and trampled under the feet of Christians, in Villages, in
Towns, in Cities, in Senates, in Armies, in Seats of Justice, and in Pulpits.
Give us the wings of a Dove, even thy wings (O holy Charity) by which thou
ascendest at once to God in love, and descendest for Gods sake in love to man;
that we may make haste and fly away, and be at rest for ever; that we may
ascend from this valley of our confusions, to the mountain of thy felicities;
Which is the glorious vision of thy self in the great mirror or glass of Gods
perfections; who is in himself, and to us perfect light, that we may see him to
be perfect love, and is perfect love, that we may enjoy his perfect light. 1
John 1.5. God is light. Chap. 4 8. God is love.
O Father of Lights, and Fountain of Love, whose immensity and eternity are
filled with truth and peace, verity and charity; whose love has sprinkled our
souls with the blood of thy beloved Son, the promised Messiah, our blessed
Jesus! O let our moment here, be sincere love to thy self, perfect charity to
thy Church, and holy humanity to all men; that our eternity may be blessed with
thine, and our Saviors, and our Fellow Saints love for ever.

You, O excellent Christians (whose excellency is chiefly in this, Col. 3.14.
Supplementum, munimentum, ornamentum omnium gratiarum una charitis. Amb. Jer.
5.1.
that above all things you have put on charity, which is the bond of
perfection) yo^ will not only excuse, but (it may be) kindly accept this
little digression; wherein my Pen, like Jeremies, has shed some few drops of
lamentation, mingling tears with the blood of Christians, which has been so
profusely shed in these self-desolating Churches; mourning for the loss of
charity, the extirpations of unity, and the ruins of harmonious order, which
are forced to yield to contention, cruelty, and confusions. Nature reaches you
to lament the loss, or forced absence, of what you love; and Christian Religion
teaches you, to love all graces in charity, and this one above all. You have
learned to suffer with patience, (and in some cases, with joy) the spoiling of
your goods, the sequestring of your revenues, the imprisonment of your persons,
the scattering of your nearest relations, the withdrawings of your wary
friends, and the great alterations of civil powers, and secular affairs; These
are but scenes and parts of the same Tragedy, which has always been acting on
the Worlds Theater; in which, it is safer to be Spectators, and Sufferers, than
Actors; nor may your sufferings in secular matters disorder your charity;
only, the plundrings of your true Christian Religion, which some men aim at;
the sequestring of this Church of England, from its glory and reformation; the
dividing, and so destroying of it; the restraining you from enjoying the great
seal of charity, the Sacrament of Christian Communion; the scattering of your
able faithful Ministers into corners; the changing and contemning of your
ancient and excellent Ministry; the underminings of your comforts, and the
hazards of your consciences; the many confusions and miseries threatening your
posterity in matters of salvation, if the malice of some men may be suffered to
abuse your charity, and impose upon this credulity;

These, your zeal (mixed with charity) teaches you, to endure with an
impatient patience: Therefore patient in some degree, because you yet hope
better things from God, and all good men; therefore piously impatient, because
you earnestly wish better for Gods glory, and the good of your Country. Your
humble zeal has taught you to be discreetly charitable; as to your own souls,
so to all others; but specially to this Church of England, and the true
Ministers of it; to whom, you cannot but willingly bear that tender respect and
love, which pious children are wont to do to their distressed, yet
well-deserving parents; from the care and support of whom, no Corbans, no
imaginary Dedications and Devotions of your selves to any new Church ways, and
forms of Religion, may justly alienate your affections; nor dispense with that
respect, justice, gratitude, and charity, which you in conscience ow to those,
to whom in some sense you ow your own selves, and the best of your selves, your
souls: Whose divine Authority, and holy Calling, I shall now further endeavor
to prove, having thus first establis^ed the truth of our Religion, and of our
Church; whose greatest waste and want, is that of charity; whose dying embers,
and almost extinguished sparks, I have (by the way) endeavored to revive in the
hearts of true Christians; that so they may without passion or prejudice,
embrace that truth which I chiefly design to vindicate in this Apology: Namely,
The holy Calling, divine Institution, and Function of the Ministry of this
Church of England; which will best be done by answering the chief Objections,
Calumnies, and Cavils, brought against both the Ministers and their Ministry,
by their many-minded Adversaries.

OBJECTION II. Against the peculiar Office and Calling of Evangelical Ministers.
SUppose we grant (say they) true Religion, and a true Church in England, with
some defects; yet these may be without any distinct office, or peculiar calling
of Ministers, which you challenge, as of divine appointment: Where as, we
conceive, every Christian may and ought to dispense, in an orderly way, 1 Pet.
4.10.
all such gifts of knowledge, as he has received in the Mysteries of Religion,
to the Churches good. So that the restraining of holy Administrations to some
persons, as a peculiar Office and Function, seems but the fruit of arrogance
and usurpation in some, of credulity and easiness in others, and is not rightly
grounded upon the Scriptures.

Answ. Not that, I believe, 1. Of Catholic testimony, and practice or custom
in the Church. 1 Cor. 9.2. Your are the Seals of mine Apostleship.
your well-grounded and well-guided piety, (O excellent Christians) (who know,
in whom, and by whom, you have be^ieved,) needs other satisfaction in this, or
the other following Objections, touching the peculiar, divinely-instituted
Function of the Ministry, than what your own solid judgments, and exacter
consciences, and clearer experiences, sealing your comforts, and our Ministry,
afford you; who are no novices in matters of Religion, either as to the outward
form and order, or the inward power; But only to let you see, that neither I,
nor my Brethren the Ministers, do plead for that, in a precarious way of mere
favor and indulgence, for which, we have not good grounds, clear proofs, and
mighty demonstrations, both divine and humane, from Scripture, pious Antiquity,
and right Reason, I shall more largely and fully answer thi^ first grand
Ob^ection, which strikes at the very Root and Foundation, both of the Ministry,
and all holy Ministrations.

1. I may first blunt the edge of this weapon (which strikes against the
peculiarity of the Ministerial Function) by the clear and constant
acknowledgment (both as to judgment and practice) of all excellent Christians,
and all famous Churches, in all Ages, Illud est Dominicum and verum quod prius
traditum, id extraneum and falsum quod posterius imm^ssum. Tertul.
from the very first birth and infancy of Christianity, and any Churches, to
our times: Of which, no sober or learned Christian, can with any plausible
show, make any doubt; so far as God in his providence has continued to us any
Monuments or Witnesses of the Churches estate, succession, and transactions in
former times. In all which, we find there ever was a peculiar Office of the
holy Ministry, and a peculiar Order of Persons, both ordaining, and ordained to
be Ministers; and both so used and so esteemed, by all good Christians, in all
settled Churches. Clemens, in Saint Paul's time, after him, writing from Rome to
the Corinthians, where faction was kindled, Exhorting people and Presbyters to
peace, tells them, That the Apostles appointed some in all Countries ((...))
trying and approving them by the Spirit, to be Bishops and Deacons, for those
that after should believe, Page 54. Edit. Pat. Jun.

continued, which Clemens shows, citing the Apostle Paul's Epistle to the

those were dead, whom they ordained immediately, p. 57. Edit. Pat. Jun. Clemens

Which Catholic practice and judgment, as it is a great satisfaction to all
sober Christians, who itch not after novelties; so it must needs be a vehement
prejudice, with any wisemen, against those yesterday novelties, raised by some
few men of great passions and presumptions, but of no great reputation (that
ever I could learn) for either such learning, piety, or impartiality, as may be
put into the balance against the clear and concurrent Testimonies of all the
Ancients, and the universal practice of all Churches, which all Histories, all
Fathers, all Councils, all Learned and Godly men, both Ancient and Modern, do
with one Spirit, and one Mouth abundantly testify; agreeable to that of Saint
Jerome, St. Augustine, Isidore Hispal. and many others: Who, speaking of the
Calling of Ministers, (from those words, Called to be an Apostle of Jesus
Christ) reckon up four sorts;

First, Some, that are sent immediately from God, and not by men; as Moses,
many Prophets, the Twelve Apostles, and Saint Paul.

Secondly, Some by Gods appointment, yet by Man's hand, and Ordination; as
Aaron, Joshuah, Elisha, Timothy.

Thirdly, Others in the ordinary way, and succession of the Church, (as it is
appointed by Jesus Christ) are by men only ordained Ministers, either
according to real merit, partial favor, and vulgar affection.

Fourthly, There be some whom neither God, nor man sends, but they run of
themselves.

Such (says St. Jerome) were, and are false Prophets, and false Apostles,
deceitful workers, Ministers of Satan, transforming themselves into Angels of
light; who say, Thus says the Lord, when the Lord has not spoken to them, or
sent them. To this sense Saint Jerome, St. Austine, and accordingly all the
Ancients, before and after them, as they have occasion to speak of the office,
duty, and dignity of Ministers in the Church: Which Catholic Testimony, and
Tradition, or Custom of the Church, for any Christian to contradict without
show of reason, is intolerable impudence; and not to believe it, is most
inhumane, and unchristian uncharitableness; to disparage, and causlesly to
derogate from it, can be no other, but profane and perverse insolence; unless
there can be produced such clear testimonies from immediate divine revelations,
confirmed by miracles, or from the received Written Word of God, to the
contrary; as will easily, and ought justly to overweigh all after inventions or
constitutions, which are built merely upon humane custom and authority; as that
was of giving the Lords Supper to Infants, and to the dead sometimes.

Which counterbalancing of Custom by Reason or Scripture, is not yet in the
least kind done, by these men, that are the opposers of the Ministry of
England; Who, by the same proud or peevish incredulity, by which they oppose
the Catholic consent, and practical Testimony of the Church in this great
point of the holy Ministry, do overthrow, by a skeptical folly, and disputative
madness, the very foundation, and all possible means of Historical belief or
faith among men; For which, the wisdom and providence of the Creator, has
afforded to mankind, no other ordinary ground or inducement, but only that,
of a charitable and rational persuasion, which we have, That neither the most,
nor, to be sure, the best ablest, and worthiest men, in all Ages, and these in
several places, would conspire in a lie, or give testimony to a falsehood;
contrary to their own consciences, and the evidence of things, as to matter of
fact; whereof themselves, and their forefathers, were eyewitnesses, beyond any
possibility of ignorance, or mistake: Nor can any thing be alleged, or
supposed, as matter of self-interest, or partiality; there being in the first
Three hundred years, no temptation of secular profit, or honor, to blind, or
corrupt their judgment and testimony; whereby they should not either fully and
clearly see, what was judged, and acted in the Church; or that any thing should
so bribe their tongues and pens, as not to give a true record, and faithful
report to posterity: Since many of them sealed their love to the truth, and
charity to mankind, by their blood in Martyrdom.

At the same rate, of obstinate disbelieving, and supercilious denying,
whatever is delivered by writing or tradition to after Ages, men may foolishly,
and madly question the works of every Author; the facts and records of all
former times, Ubi charismata domini posita sunt, ibi discere oportet veritatem;
apud quos est ea, quae ab Apostolis successio, and id, quod est sanum and
irreprobabile sermonie ^^nstat. Iren. l. 4. c. 45. Edant origines Ecclesia^um
suarum, evolvant ordinem Episcoporum suorum ita per successiones ab initio
decurrentium, ut primus ille Episcopus aliquem ex Apostolis vel Apostolicis
viris habuerit autore^ and antecesso^em. Tert. de prae. ad Hae. c. 32.
left us in History: Christians may doubt of their Baptism in their Infancy;
yea, and question their own Natural Fathers and Mothers, refusing to own, or
pay any duty and obedience to them; since of these they can have no other
assurance, than what is told them by others; as also of all their forefathers
and predecessors; from whom these Skeptical Infidels are certainly descended,
although they never saw them; and (possibly) they enjoy the benefit of their
forefathers labors and estates to this day, which from those is derived in an
orderly succession, to these their ungrateful successors: Nor is indeed the
Series and Genealogy of Natural Parents, more necessary and certain in reason,
that they have been, and are gone before us (however their several names and
successions may be unknown) from Noah, or from Adam; than is the constant and
uninterrupted succession of Spiritual Fathers, and Predecessors in the Ministry
of the Church; derived by the holy Apostles from Jesus Christ, the second Adam;
the Everlasting Father of a better Generation: Of which, there are (besides the
apparent, present succession in this Church of England, and all other
Churches-Christian, now in all the World, which lately had or still have a
peculiar order of Bishops and Presbyters, as holy Ministers in the Church) so
clear, and constant, and undeniable Histories, from those that were ((...)) of
all men or writers, the most worthy to be believed, for their love to God,
their zeal for the truth, their charity to all men; but especially, for their
care of the household of Faith, the Church of Christ.

Wherein, however it be most true, that a bare descent, or succession of
persons, following each other in time and place, be not sufficient to carry on
the being and honor of a true Church Christian, (which title is not entailed to
any place, or any race of people,) unless, withal, there be a succession in
Christian Doctrine and Institutions, according to the Scripture; yet it is as
true, that the custody and tradition of the Scriptures, the succession of true
doctrine believed in the Church, and divine Institutions celebrated, never have
been, nor ever can possibly be in Christ's ordinary way to his Church carried on
to after generations, but only by such a personal succession of Bishops,
Pastors, and Ministers in the Church; such as were in the beginning of the
Go^pell appointed by Christ, and ever since has been orderly and constantly
derived from one to another, agreeable to the divine constitution; Nor are
C^ristians to expect or presume of daily miracles, special revelations, or
Angelick missions, to carry on Christian Religion; but humbly to content
themselves with that once settled Ministry and holy order, which God by Jesus
Christ has given to the Church, after which example some are still duly tried,
ordained, set apart, and sanctified to this office, the dispensation of the
Gospel, and those mysteries which go with it.

and humble Christians do, and ever did, the constant, clear, and concurrent
(which is the truly Catholic) testimony of the Church (in which so much of the
truth, Spirit, and grace of God, has always appeared amidst the many
cloudings of humane infirmities) to be far beyond any mere humane record, or
authority; in point of establishing a Christians judgment or conscience, in
any thing, that is not contrary to the evident command of the written word of
God: However some men's ignorance and self, conceited confidence (like bogs and
quagmires) are so loose and false, that no piles never so long, well driven,
and strongly compacted, by the consent and harmonious testimonies of the most
learned writers in the Church, can reach any bottom, or firm ground in them,
whereon to lay a foundation of humane belief, or erect a firm bank and defense
against the invasion of daily novelties; which blow up all, and break in upon
the ancient and most venerable orders, practices and constitutions of the
Church, where ever they are yet continued: which being evidently set forth to
me, by witnesses of so great credit, for their piety, diligence, fidelity,
harmony, integrity, constancy and charity, I know not how with any face of
humanity or Christianity to question, disbelieve, or contradict.

Under which cloud of unsuspected witnesses, I confess, I cannot but much
acquiesce, and rest satisfied in those things, which others endlessly dispute,
because they have not so literal and preceptive a ground in Scripture; Quod
universa tenet ecclesia nec consiliis institutum sed semper retentum est, non
nisi autoritate Apostolica traditum rectissime creditur. August. cont. Donat.
l. 4. In Council. Loodic. Melito Episc. Sard. missus ut autographa ubique

however they have a very rational, exexemplary, analogical and consequential
authority from thence, which is made most clear, as to the mind of God, by
that sense, which the Primitive Doctors and Christians, who lived with, or next
to the Apostles, had of them; and by their practice accordingly, in the ways of
Religion: Thus the Canonical Books of the Scripture, especially those of the
New Testament (which no where are enumerated in any one Book, nor, as from
divine oracle, any where commanded to be believed or received, as the writings
of such holy authors, guided by the dictates or directions of Gods Spirit) we
own and receive, as they were after some time, with judgment and discretion
(rejecting many other pretended Gospels, and Epistles) anciently received by
the Catholic Church, and to this day are continued. So also, in point of the
Church Government: How, in right Reason, Order, and Religion, the Churches of
Christ, either in single Congregations and Parishes, or in larger Associations
and Fraternities ought to be governed; in which thing, we see that sudden
variations from the Churches constant pattern in all ages and places, has
lately cost the expense, not only of much Ink, but of much blood, and have
both cast and left us in great scandals, deformities, and confusions,
unbeseeming Christian Religion. The like confirmation I have for Christians
observing the Lords day, as their holy Rest, or Sabbath to the Lord, and their
variating herein (upon the occasion of Christ's Resurrection) from the Seventh
day or Jewish Sabbath, which is not so much commanded by Precept, as confirmed
by Practice in the Church; so in the baptising of the Infants of Christian
Parents, who profe^s to believe in Jesus Christ only for the means of
salvation, to them and their children; which, after Saint Cyprian, Saint Jerome
and Augustine affirm to have been the custom of the Catholic Church, in, and
before their days; so as no Bishop, or Council, or Synod began it, Cypr. ep. ad
Fidum. Aust ep. 28. And no less, in this of the peculiar distinct calling,
order, (...). Can. Afric. in Con. Carth. 1. anno 419. Some things in the Church

office, and succession, of the Ministry Evangelical.

In all which, if the Letter and Analogy of Scripture were less clear than ^t
is, so that the doctrines of those particulars (which are among Christians
counted divine) were (^ike Vines, and Honeysuckles) less able to bear up
themselves in full authority, by that strength and virtue which they receive
from the Scripture Precept, (where undoubtedly their root is; and from whence
they have grown, shooted out so far, and flourished in all Churches;) yet the
constant judgment and practice of the Church of Christ (which is called the
pil^ar and ground of truth,) are stays and firm supports to such sweet and
useful plants, which have so long flourished in the Church of Christ, whose
custom may silence perverse disputes of corrupt and contentious minds: And
indeed does fully satisfy and confirm both my believe, and my religious
observation of those particulars, as sacred and unal^erable.

Nor has any of those things, Eucharistia sacramentum non de aliorum manu qua^
prasidentium sumimus. Tertul. de Coro. Mil. Impositionem manuu^ qua Ecclesiae
mininistri in suum manus initiantur ut non invitus patior vocari Sacramentum

jure dissimilis, constanter assero.
more clear evidence from Scripture or Catholic practice, than this of the
calling and succession of the Ministry of the Gospel has, wherein some men,
after due trial and examination of their gifts and lives, made by those who
are of the same function, and are in the Church endued with a derivable
Commission and Authority, to ordein an holy succession of men in the Ministry
for the Churches use, are by fasting, prayer, and solemn imposition of hands in
the presence of the faithful people, publicly and peculiarly ordained,
consecrated, set apart, sent and authorized in the power and name of Christ, to
preach the Gospel to all men, to administer the holy Sacraments, and
respectively to dispense all those holy duties, and mysteries belonging to
Christian Religion, among Christian people, that is, such as profess to
believe, that Jesus Christ is the only Savior of Sinners.

Which holy and most necessary custom of ordaining some fit men, by others of
the same function, to be Ministers in the Church, has not only the unanimous
consent and practice of the Orthodox Christians, and purest Churches in all
ages, from the Apostles times; But, no Heretics or Schismatics, who owned any
relation to the Gospel of Jesus Christ, did ever so much as dispute, or
question the power and succession ministerial, as to its calling peculiar, and
divinely appropriated, to some men in the Church, Till of later days in
Germany, and some otherwheres the pride of some men's parts, and conceit of
their gifts, or the opinion of their raptures and Enthusiasms, mixed with other
lusts and secular designs, tempted some weak and fanatic men of the
Anabaptistical leaven, to adventure the invasion and vulgar prostration of the
office; before ever they broached their reasons against it; Confessores gloriae
Christi. An. 1543. When they after proved to be Pastoricidae, Vilains which
conspired to destroy all the Ministers of the Gospel in Germany, hanging and
drowning many of them, casting them into wells, An. 1562. Cl. Sanctesius de
temp. decept. Irenaeus, l. 4. c. 43. Qui absistunt a principali succession^

placentes. O^^e^^i decidunt a veritate. Sophistae verborum magis esse volentes,

which presumption and disorder the Swenckfeldians, who called themselves
Confessors of the glory of Christ; afterward the Socinians and others
intending to introduce new and heretical doctrines with their new Teachers,
studied to set forth with some weak shows of reason and Scripture. Whereas in
all former ages of the Church, such as should have abrogated the ancient
Catholic way, or have broached any new way of Evangelical power and Ministry,
would have been as scandalous, as if he had broached a new Messiah, or a new
Gospel, and made the old one of none effect; as many of those strive to do, who
seek to cry down the former way of Ministers right Ordination, Succession, and
Authority. Who if they had not met with a giddy, and credulous, and licentious
age, would have needed new miracles to have confirmed their new and plebeian
ways of Ministry; or to cashier the old one; which was first began, and after
confirmed (as the Gospel was) for some years, with many infallible signs and
wonders, wrought by the Apostles, and their Successors, in that Order and
Function.

3. What can be the design of any to go contrary, or innovate?
What can it be then, but an exceeding want of common understanding, or a
superfluity of malice, or a transport of passion, or some secular lust, either
to deny credit to the Testimony of the best Christians, and purest Churches in
all times, or to go quite contrary to their judgment and practice, by seeking
to discredit and destroy the Authority and peculiar Function of the ancient
Catholic Christian Ministry, in these or other Churches? And since in
primitive times, it could be no matter of either profit or honor in the world,
In ea regula incedimus quam Ecclesia ab Apostolis, Apostoli a Christo, Christus
a Deo accepit. Tertul. de Praes. c. 37. Radix Christianae societatis per seeds
Apostolo^um and successione^ ^piscoporum certa per o rbem propagatione
diffunditur. August. ep. 42.
to be a Bishop or Presbyter in the Church (who were the first men to be
persecuted or sacrificed;) What motive could there be then, but only Religion,
Duty, and Conscience, to undertake and persevere in that holy and dangerous
Calling, that so the Gospel might be continued? And since, now in England, it
can be no great temptation of covetousness or ambition (unless it be in very
poor and necessitous man) to be a Preacher of the Gospel, upon the new account
of the peoples, or self-ordaining (which is as none;) what can it be that
provokes so many in a new, and pitiful way, either of egregious ignorance, and
popular simplicity, to undertake to be Preachers? Or in a more refined way of
devilish malice and deep design, to seek to level, cast down, and trample under
foot all Ministerial power whatsoever, (which is none, if it be common, and not
peculiar to some men by divine Sanction:) Certainly, this can arise from no
other aim, but either that of destroying us, as a Reformed Church; or
desolating us, quite from being a Church, or Christians: Which our posterity
will easily cease to be, as to the very form (as many at present are, 1 Cor.
15.14.
as to any power and conscience of Religion) if once they cease to have, or
begin to think they have not had, any true Ministers in this, or any Church: So
that all Preaching of the Gospel, all Sa^^aments, all the Faith of so many
Christians, Professors, Confessors, and Martyrs in all Ages, together with the
fruits of their Faith, in Patience, Charity, and good Works, must be in vain.
Alas, these poor revenues and encouragements which are yet left to the
Ministers here, (considered with their burdens of business, duties, taxes, and
envy) are scarce worth the having or coveting, even by vulgar and mechanic
spirits; who may make a better shift to live in any way almost than now in the
Ministry.

The design then of levelling the Ministry, must needs be from greater motives,
such as seek to have the whole honor and authority of the Reformed Religion
here in England, utterly abolished; or else, taken up upon some such odd,
novel, and fanatic grounds, which will hold no water, bear no weight, or
stress; being built upon the sands of humerous novelty, not on the rock of holy
antiquity, and divine verity: That so this whole Church may, by the adversaries
of it, be brought to be a mere shadow of deformed and confused Religion; or
else, be only able to plead its Christianity, upon mere Familistick, or
Anabaptistick, or Enthusiastic, or Socinian, or Fanatic Principles; Upon
which must depend all our Christian Privileges, Truths, Sacraments,
Ministrations, Duties, and Comforts, Living and Dying; all which will easily be
proved, and appear, to a considerate soul, as profane and null, when he shall
see they are performed, or administered by those, Agnitio vera est Apostolorum
doctrina, and antiquus ecclesiastatus, in universo mundo, and charactere
corporis Christi, secundum successiones Episcoporum quibus illi ^am, quae est
in unoquoque l^ci Ecclesiam, tradiderunt. Ire. l. 4. c. 6^
who can produce no Precept, Scripture, or Practice from Antiquity, for their
ways, either of Christianity, or of Ministry, but only their own, or other
men's wild fancies, and extravagant furies; nor can they have better excuses
for their errors, in forsaking the right and Catholic way, but only a popular
levity, credulity, and madness after novelties.

So that, as to this first part of my answer, touching The peculiar Function of
the Ministry, I do aver upon my Conscience, so far as I have read, or can
learn, That there is no Council of the Church, or Synod; no Father or
Historian; no other Writer, that mentions the affairs of the Church; no one of
them gives the least cause to doubt, but wholly confirms this assertion, That
no part of the Catholic Church of Christ, in any age, or place, was ever
settled or flourished without a constant peculiar Order, and Ordination of
Ministers; who were consecrated to the receiving and exercise of that power in
the Church, as from Christ, although by man, which have continued to this day.

There are indeed three or four examples (in cases extraordinary) of some
private unordained Christians in the Primitive times, who occasionally trading
to Heathens, were means first to teach them the Mysteries of Christ, so as they
desired to be baptized, which was after done by such Bishops and Ordained
Ministers, as were sent them upon their request, from other Churches. To
produce particul^r testimonies out of each Author, Father, Council, and
Historian, in every age, to prove the constant succession, the high veneration,
and the unfeigned love, which was every where conferred upon the Bishops and
Ministers of the Church; also, to show forth that devout care and religious
regard, which the ordainers, the faithful people, and those to be ordained to
the office, had, in their several relations and duties, when Ministers were to
be ordained and consecrated, such allegations were easy, being very many and
obvious; but I hold the pains needless, considering, that to learned men they
are so well known; and all ingenuous Christians will believe my solemn
asseveration, that, as in the presence of God, what I write, is Truth: As for
those weak or wilful men, who are in this my only opposers, I know, they
consider not any heaps of authorities, which they account only as humane;
which they cannot examine, nor do they value them, when convinced of the
certainty, and harmony of them; were there never so sweet, and many flowers
gathered from the testimony of Antiquity and Authority of the Fathers, these
supercilious novellers will not vouchsafe to smell to them: It is well, if I
can make them savor any thing well out of the Scriptures, which favors the
Function of the Ministry.

4. Catholic custom confirmed by Scripture, as to the Office of the Ministry.
2. So then, in the next place, This Defense of the Churches clear, constant,
and Catholic Testimony, in this point of the peculiar Office of the Ministry
(as in any other) becomes a brazen wall, an impregnable bulwark, able to break
in pieces, or to retort all engines and batteries made against it; when it
appears to be exactly drawn, according to the scale, line, and measure, set
down in the holy Scripture; which are therefore much slighted by some, who
despise the Ministry; because, like well-planted Canons, they defend the
Church, and its constant Ministry; as on the other side, the Churches fidelity
and constancy, are the groundwork and platforms, on which the Scriptures are
planted; 1 Timothy 3.15.
The Church of Christ bearing up as the ground, and holding forth as a pillar,
that divine Truth, Power, and Authority, which, from God, they have in them; of
which, the Church is the Herald or Publisher, but not the Author or Inditer;
Conferring nothing to their internal Truth, which is from their revealer and
inspirer, God; but much to their external credit, and historick reception,
which we have tendered to us daily; not as immediately from God, or Angels, or
inspired Prophets, but by the veracity and fidelity of the Church, chiefly in
its public Ministry; which in this point of so necessary, constant, and
universal practice, for the good of all faithful people, in all Ages and
Churches, cannot be thought in any reason, either to have had no rule divinely
appointed; or that all Churches have been wholly ignorant of it, or knowingly
have so wholly swerved from it, that never any Church, either in its Teachers
and Pastors, or in its people and believers were followers of the
Scripture-Precept, and Pattern, till these last and worst days; whereas, the
clear and pregnant light of the Scripture, is in this point of a settled
Ministry, so agreeing with the use and practice of the Catholic Church; that,
as no error can be suspected in the one, so no obscurity can be pretended in
the other, by any Christians, who will allow the divine Authority, and
infallible Truth of those Scriptures, which we call the New Testament.

In all which, nothing is more evident, Christ sent of the Father, as a
Minister of Righteousness. 1 Pet. 2.25. Heb. 12.2. Matthew. 17.5 J^hn 4.34. and
5.36. and 6.57. and 7.16. Heb. 5.4. No mantaketh this honor to himself but he
that is called of God as Aaron. V. 5. So also Christ glorified not himself to
be made an high priest, but, etc. Matthew. 3.17.
and self-demonstrating beyond any cavil or contradiction, than, That our Lord
Jesus Christ, the promised Messiah, the beloved Son of God, the Angel of the
new and better Covenant, the Minister of Righteousness, the great Apostle, the
chief Bishop and Father of our souls, the Author and Finisher of our Faith, the
supreme Lord and King, the eternal and compassionate High Priest, the unerring
Prophet of his Church, whose voice we are only to hear and obey in all things
he commands us; That, I say, this Lord Jesus Christ, was sent by the Father, to
a personal accomplishment of all Prophecies; fulfilling of all righteousness;
to a visible Ministration of holy things for the Churches good; That he came
not in his own Name, as a man, to be Mediator and Teacher; nor did he as a man
take this honor of Prophet, Priest, or King of his Church upon him; but had his
mission or appointment from his Father, God; who gave evident testimonies from
Heaven of him; not only before, and at his birth, but afterward, at his solemn
and public inauguration by Baptism, into the Work of his Ministry, where a
voice from Heaven was heard, and a visible representation of the Holy Spirit
was seen, testifying him to be the beloved Son of God; the anointed, with the
gifts of the Spirit, above all, as Head of the Church: These, after, were
followed with infallible signs and wonders, while Jesus went about doing good;
teaching the Mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven; instituting holy rites, for
the distinguishing of his Church from the world, and for the comforting of the
faithful in the world; by those seals, pledges, and memorials of his love, in
dying for the Church, and shedding both water and blood upon the Cross.

Christ's sending his Apostles as Ministers. Acts 1. Phil. 2.9.
Christ having thus personally finished the suffering and meritorious part of
his Ministry; after his Resurrection, being now no more to converse in a
visible humane way of presence, with his Church on Earth, but ascending (as was
meet) to that glory of the Father, which, as God, he had ever with him; as man,
he had merited of him, by suffering on the Cross, and enduring the shame, for
his Churches salvation; yet he left not his Disciples comfortless, but, as he
promised, sent his Spirit publicly and eminently upon the Twelve principal
Apostles, Acts 2. John 20.21.
whom he had formerly chosen, and appointed, in his, and his Fathers Name, to
Preach the Gospel; to whom he gave the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, as to the
Stewards and chief Deputies, or Ministers of his household in his absence;
instructing them, what to do; on what foundation of faith in him, (...), All
Authority, i. e. Legitima potentia. Matthew. 28.18, 19, 20. Mark 16.15.
to build his Church; by what Sacramental seals to confirm believers; giving
them full power and commission, to go into all the world, by Teaching and
Baptising to make Disciples; confirming this power to them, by breathing on
them, and conferring farther Ministerial gifts of the Spirit upon them;
promising also to be with them to the end of the world, which could not be
meant of their persons, who soon died, but of their successors in that Office
and Ministry; that the same power, authority, and assistance, should be with
them, in that holy way, to which he thus ordained and sent them, by a divine
charter, and durable commission. After all this, for further publication of
this great Authority and Ministerial power, given to the Apostles, and their
Successors; and for the confirmation of it, both to their own consciences, John
14.17. Acts 2.
and to all the world, the holy Spirit, as was promised, came upon them in the
shape of fiery cloven tongues, filling them with miraculous gifts, and all
Ministerial power, both extraordinary in their persons, and ordinary, derivable
to their Successors; such, as the wisdom of Christ thought most fit, both for
the first planting of the Church with miraculous gifts, attending the Ministry
of the Gospel; and the after propagating of it, by the same Ministry, confirmed
by the constancy of the Martyrs and Confessors, which were in stead of daily
miracles.

This whole frame, polity, and divine constitution, of the order, power, and
Ministry, that should succeed Christ Jesus in his Church, was no other, than
the proper effects of Christ's prophetic power, and wisdom, for the instructing
his Church; an act or ordinance of his Kingly power, for the governing of it;
and a fruit of his Priestly power, and care, for a right Liturgy, or
officiating, to be continued in his Church; thus furnishing it with an holy
Succession of Evangelical Priests and Ministers, in his name and authority, who
might always teach, guide, and govern; also supplicate for, consecrate and
offer holy things with the faithful, and for them, namely, the sacrifices of
prayers, thanksgiving, and praises; especially, Heb. 9.14. and 10.12.
that Eucharistical memorial of that one great oblation of himself once made,
on the Altar of the Cross, for the Redemption of the World; which is the great
accomplishment of the Jewish Prophecies, the abolishing of their Types and
Ceremonies, the main foundation of the Christians Religion, and the chief
subject of that Evangelical Ministry, which Jesus Christ himself has thus
evidently instituted and sealed in his Church; For whose sake, he has given
those Ministerial gifts, with a distinct power and authority; making some (not
all) either Apostles, or Prophets, or Evangelists, or Pastors and Teachers,
Ephesians. 4.11, 12. 1 Cor. 12.4, 5, 21, 28.
For the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Ministry, for the
edifying of the Body of Christ, etc. And this, by as manifest a distinction,
both for gifts, and place, and use, as is in the parts of the body, between the
eyes and the hands, the head and the feet; Verse. 29.
So that all are not Apostles, nor Prophets, nor Teachers, that are Believers,
and Members of the Body of Christ his Church; no more than every part is an eye
in the natural body; however it partake of the same Soul, as Believers do of
the same Spirit, 1 Cor. 12.6, 7.
yet in different manifestations; of which difference of gifts and office,
those only are to judge, whom the Spirit of Christ has enabled with gifts,
and endued successively in the Church, with power from Christ to judge of them,
and accordingly to invest them, 1 Cor. 14.32. The spirits of the Prophets, are
subject to the Prophe^^ V. 33. For God is not the Author of confusion, etc.
by solemn and holy ordination, into the orderly power of exercising those
gifts, which they are judged to have received from the Spirit of Christ, for
the good of the Church, both for Instruction, and for Government of it. Without
which divinely-constituted Order and Office of Ministry began in Christ, by him
derived to the Apostles, and by them, and their successors constantly and duly
observed to these days, the Church of Christ had long ere this been a monster
made up of confused excrescencies; a very heap and huddle of Ignorance,
Heresies, Schisms, all manner of erroneous blindness, and extravagant madness;
like those misshapen prodigies, which we may often see among those, who having
cast off the lawful succession, the sacred and ancient order of the Ministry,
do in their varieties exceed, even the mixtures and productions of Africa.

After Christ's Ascension, 5. The Apostles ordain and command other to ordain
Ministers.
we have no less evidence of Scripture, for the undoubted practice of the
blessed Apostles, when they had by a divine lot, first filled up that place and
part of the Ministry, from which Judas had fallen, Acts 1.25. For having received
power Ministerial immediately from Christ, they did, duly, conscientiously,
orderly, and effectually fulfill their own Ministry; and also took care to
ordain others that might do so too, both in their times, and after them;
distributing their own labors into several Countries, and to several sorts of
people; Gal. 2.7.
some to the Circumcision of the Jews, others to those of the uncircumcised
Gentiles; Among whom they exercised their Office and Ministry, 1 Co^. 5.20. As
A^^^^sadors ^o^ Christ, as though God did be eech you by us; we pray y u in

not arbitrarily and precariously; but as a trust and duty, of necessity, out
of conscience, and with all divine power, authority, and fidelity; as
Ambassadors from Christ, for God; as Heralds, as Angels, or Messengers sent
from God; as Laborers together with God in his Husbandry the Church; as Woers
and Espousers, having Commission or Letters of credence, to treat of and make
up a marriage, and espousals, between Christ and the Church; which sacred
office of trust and honor, none without due authority delegated to him from
Christ, might perform, any more, than Haman might presume to court Queen
Esther, before the King Ahasuerus.

During these Primitive times of the Apostles Ministry of the Gospel, before
they had finished their mortal pilgrimage, we read, them careful to ordain
Presbyters in every City and Church, to give them charge of their Ministry, to
fulfill it; of their flocks to feed and guide them, in Christ's way, both for
truth and orders, over whom the Lord had made them overseers by the Apostles
appointment; who, not only thus ordained others to succeed them immediately;
but gave command, as from the Lord, to these (as namely to Timothy and Titus)
to take great care for an holy succession of Ministers; such as should be apt
to teach; able, and faithful men; to whom they should commit the Ministry of
the Word of life, so as the Word, or Institution of Christ, might be kept
unblamable, till the coming of Jesus Christ, 1 Timothy 6.14. by an holy order and
office of Ministers, duly ordained, with the solemn imposition of hands; as a
visible token to men of the peculiar designiation of them, and no others but
those, to this Office and Function; who must attend on the Ministry, give an
account of their charge, and care of souls to God.

Thus we find, beyond all dispute, for Three Generations after Christ, (First,
in the Apostles; secondly, from them to others (by name to Timothy and Titus;)
thirdly, from them to others; by them to be ordained Bishops and Deacons,) the
holy Ministry instituted by Christ, is carried on in an orderly succession, in
the same Name, with the same Authority, to the same holy ends and offices; as
far as the History of the New Testament extends, which is not above thirty
years after Christ's Ascension: And, we have, after all these, the next
Succession, testifying the mind of the Lord, and the Apostles. Clemens, the
Scholar of Saint Paul, mentioned Phil. 4.3. who in his divine Epistle
testifies, That the Apostles ordained every where the first fruits, or prime
Believers, for Bishops and Deacons, Page 54. And page 57. the Apostles
appointed ((...)) distinct Offices, as at present, ((...)) That when these
slept with the Lord, others, tried and approved men, should succeed and execute
their ((...)) holy Ministry; than which testimony, nothing can be more evident:
After that, he blames the Corinthians for raising sedition, for one or two men's
sake, against all the Presbytery, Page 62. And exhorts at last, Let the flock
of Christ be at peace with the Presbyters ordained to be over it, ((...).) So
after, Be subject to the Presbyters, etc.

Thus the excellent methods of Christ's grace, and wisdom toward his Church
appear, as to this peculiar Office, and constant Function of the Evangelical
Ministry, commanding men to work the work of God, that they may have eternal
life, John 6.29. which is to believe in him, whom the Father has sent, sealed,
and anointed with full power, to suffer, to satisfy, to merit, to fulfill all
Righteosness; Also to declare and confirm this to his Church; constantly
teaching, guiding, and sanctifying it: He has (for this end) taken care, that
faithful, able, and credible men, should be ordained in an holy, constant
succession, to bear witness or record of him to all posterity; that so others
might, by hearing, believe; without which, ordinarily they cannot, Romans 10.14,
15. Nor can they hear with regard, or in prudence give credit, and honor to the
speaker; or obey with conscience the things spoken, unless the Preacher be such
an one, as enters in by the door, John 10.1. into the sheepfold; such as is
sent by God, either immediately as the Apostles, or mediately as their
Successors, from them and after them; who could never have preached and
suffered with that confidence, conscience, and authority, unless they had been
conscious, that they were rightly sent of God, Romans 10.14, 15. Psalm. 68.11.
Isai. 53.1. 1 Cor. 1.18.
and Christ: At whose Word only this great company of Preachers were sent into
the world; who so mightily in a short time prevailed, as to persuade men, every
where to believe, a report so strange, so incredible, so ridiculous, so foolish
to flesh and blood, and to the wisdom of the world.

Thus far then the tenor of the whole New Testament, 6. Distinct Characters and
Notes of the Ministerial Office. John 15.19.
(and that one Apostolic Writer Clemens) witnesses, that as Jesus Christ, the
great Prophet, and chief Shepherd, 1 Pet. 5.4. was sent, and empowered with all
power from the Father, to carry on the great work of saving sinners, by
gathering them out of the world, into the fold and bosom of his Church; So he
did this, and will ever be doing it, till his coming again, by ordeining and
continuing such means and Ministry, Mat. 28.20.

(as we have seen) particular persons whose names are recorded, with peculiar
power, to teach, to gather, to feed, and govern his Church, by Doctrine, by
Sacraments, and by holy Discipline; Setting those men in peculiar relations and
Offices to his Church, as Fathers, Stewards, Bishops, Shepherds, Rulers,
Watchmen; calling them by peculiar names, and distinct titles, as light of the
world, Salt of the earth, Mat. 5.13. Fishers of men, Mat. 4.19. Stars in his

against grievous Wolves, false teachers; to stop their mouths, Tit. 1.11. to
exhort, command and rebuke with all authority, Tit. 2.15. to do their work, as
workmen that need not to be ashamed, 2 Timothy 2.15. as those that must give an
account of their Ministry, and the souls committed to their care and charge by
God and the Church. Adorns them also with peculiar privileges; promises and
special assistances; takes care for peculiar maintenance, 1 Cor. 9.9, 19. and
double honor to be given them, by all true Christians, 1 Timothy 5.17. and
encourages them in a work of so great pains, exact care, and conscientious
diligence, which must expect to meet always (as now it does) with much
opposition, and contradiction of sinners; promising to them special degrees of
glory, and more ponderous Crowns of eternal rewards in Heaven.

9.16. Though I Preach the Gospel I have nothing to glory of (as superogating)

By all which, and many others which might be added, the Demonstration is clear
as the Sun at Noon day, to all that are not wilfully blind, That some, and not
all, in the Church; and these, not arbitrary and occasional, but chosen and
ordained persons, are sent in a succession from Christ, in his name, and by
virtue of this divine mission, special authority, and ordination, to the care,
service, and work of the Ministry; they are bound in the highest bonds of
conscience, to the glory of God, and the salvation of their own, and others
souls, under a dreadful woe and curse of being guilty of their souls
damnation, who perish by their neglect, to attend diligently, to discharge
faithful^y, and courageously, as in the name and authority of Jesus Christ the
Lord of glory, this great and dreadful employment of the Ministry, which
Angels would not undertake, without they were sent; nor if sent, without some
horror: Onus and opus i^sis angelicis formidandum humoris. Betn. 2 Cor. 2.16.
Who is sufficient for these things? i. e. to speak the word of God, as of God,
in the sight of God, in Christ, i. e. of sincerity. 2 Timothy 2.4. 2 Timothy 4.13,
14, 15, 16. Acts 4.19.20. The Epistle of Paul to Tim. and Tit. are the constant
Canons and divine injunctions for the succession of Ministerial power by way of
trial, imposition of hands, prayer, etc.
To which no earthen vessels are of themselves sufficient; but through the
grace of God, they are made able and faithful, 1 Timothy 1.12. and being such are
both successful, and accepted; while they give themselves wholly to this work;
not entangling themselves with other incomberances, but devoting the whole
latitude of time, parts, studies, gifts, to this business of saving souls; and
this, not in popular and precarious ways, or only upon grounds of charity; but
with all just confidence of having that authority with them, as well as
necessity upon them, which makes them bold in the Lord; that they cannot but
speak the things for which they have received power and commission from Christ,
by the Ordination and appointment of the Governors and guides of the Church,
who formerly had received the same power; To which none can, without high
impudence, blasphemy, and impiety pretend, who are conscious to themselves, to
have received no such authority from Christ; either immediately, or in that one
mediate way of successive ordination, by which he has appointed it to be
derived to posterity: which, I have already proved, cannot by any show of
Scripture, no more than in any way of reason and order, becoming Religion, be
found to have any other way, than by those that are in orders as Ministers:
neither is it entrusted with the community of people among Christians, nor left
to every private man's pleasure.

As then some men are duly invested with power ministerial, 7. None can be
true Ministers, but such as are rightly ordained.
both to act in this power, and to confer it to others after them; and these
only are commanded by the rule of Christ, by their duty or office, and by all
bonds of conscience, to make a right use of this peculiar and divine power, for
the Churches good; So are all other men whatsoever, not thus duly ordained, and
empowered, (though never so well gifted in themselves) forbidden, under the sins
of lying, falsity, disorderly walking, proud usurpation, and arrogant intrusion
of themselves into an holy office, uncalled, and unsent, either to take this
office and Ministry of holy things on themselves, or to confer the power, which
they never received, on others; which neither Melchisedeck, nor Moses, nor
Aaron, nor Samuel, nor any of the Prophets; nor the Lord Jesus Christ, nor the
blessed Apostles, Heb. 5.1. Every high Priest taken from among men is ordained
for men in things pertaining to God, etc. 4. No man takes this honor to
himself, but he that is called of God as was Anon, etc. 5. Christ also
glorified not himself to be made an high Priest, etc.
nor any Evangelist; or any true Bishop or Presbyter, nor any holy men,
succeeding them, did ever take to themselves, either as to the whole, or any
part of that power and Ministry, not so much as to be a Deacon, but still
attended the Heavenly call, and mission, either immediately, Luke 12.42. Who
then is a faithful and wise Steward, whom the Lord shall make ruler over his
household, to give them their portion in due season? 43. Blessed, etc. 1 Timothy
3.15. If I tarry long, that thou may know how thou ought to behave thy
self in the house of God, etc.
(which was confirmed by miracles, and special revelations or predictions,) or
mediatly, in such an order and method of succession, as the Lord of the Church,
who is not a God of confusion, has appointed, and to this day preserved: who
otherwise would have left his Church short of that blessing, of orderly
Government, and Officers appointed for holy ministrations, which is necessary
in every society, and which no wise man, that is Master of any Family, does
omit to appoint and settle; especially in his personal absence; where he
governs by a visible derived and delegated authority given to others; as Christ
now does his Church, as to the extern order and dispensation of holy things.

Peoples duty.
The duty of all faithful people (in which bounds their comforts are contained)
are no less distinct and evidently confined, Quomodo valebit homo secularis
sacerdotis magisterium adimplere, cujus nec officium tenuit, nec disciplinam
agnovit? Isid. Hisp. off. l. 2. c. 5. (...). The Lay man is bound up by Lay
commands to keep his rank and order. Cl. ep. page 53. Nor can, says he, the
Presbyters be cast out or degraded without a great sin. Page 57. (...), etc.
Exors officii, exors solatii, and praemii, Is Hisp. Matthew. 16.18. Ephesians. 2.20.
Heb 6.2.
in the order of Christ's Church; which are, diligently to attend, humbly to
obey, Heb. 13.17. thankfully to own, respect, love, esteem and honor, 1 Cor.
9.11. 1 These. 5.12, 13. liberally to requite the doctrine and labors of the
true and faithful Ministers, 1 Timothy 5.17. who are thus over them in the Lord,
in a right way and succession of Ministerial Office divinely instituted, and
constantly derived authority. In the perpetuating of which, to so many
centuries of years, since Christ's Ascension, by lawful and uninterrupted
succession in his Church, the power and providence of God is not less
remarkably seen, than in the preservation of the Scriptures, amidst all
persecution, confusions, and variations of humane affairs. Also the love and
care of Christ to his Church, the fidelity of his promise is evident: being no
less made true to the Ministry, than to the whole Church, to be with them to
the end of the world: and by the Ministry that is made good to the whole
Church, that the Gates of Hell shall not prevail against the foundations of the
Church; which are laid upon the writings, and by the labors of the Prophets
and Apostles; and after them still laid and preserved by able, faithful, and
ordained Ministers; The consecrating or ordeyning of whom by the Imposition or
laying on of hands in a continued succession for the good of the Church, is
reckoned by the holy Author of the Epistle to the Hebrews among the principles
and foundations of Christian Religion; joined with doctrines of Faith,
Repentance, Baptism, Resurrection, and eternal judgment; for other meaning of
the (...) Imposition of hands, I find not by Scripture practice, or the Church
afterward, so clear and constant as this in Ordination to an holy Ministry. Nor
can Confirmation be rightly done to the Baptized and Catechized, but by those
who are ordained. That to deny the Ordination and due succession of Ministers,
by which to carry on the work of Christ in his Church; or to seek to overthrow
it in any Church, is all one, as if men should deny those grand and
fundamental points of Faith, Repentance, Resurrection, and judgment, to have
been taught by Christ; or Baptism to have been instituted; that to overthrow
and abolish the constant Ministry and Office in the Church, can be the design
of none, but those, who care not to turn Infidels, and to live in all
Atheistical profaness.

If then, there be any force or authority from Scriptures as the Oracles of
God, to prove by precept, institution, or example, the religious necessity of
any peculiar duties, or holy Offices, and divine Ministrations, by which men
are made Christians, and distinguished as the Church of Christ from the world;
if the Preaching the word of life, the teaching of the histories, the opening
of the mysteries, the urging the precepts, the denouncing of the terrors, the
offering the promises, the celebrating the Sacraments; the binding to wrath,
and shutting up to condemnation, all unbelievers and impenitents; the loosing
of penitents and opening Heaven to them, by the knowledge of Law or Gospel; if
these or any other holy ministrations be necessary, not to the well-being only,
but the very being of a Church Christian; Sure there there is (as I have
showed) no less strength, pregnancy, and concurrent Scripture clearness, to
convince, and confirm, the peculiar office, divine power and function of the
Evangelicall Ministry; Without which all those ministrations must needs have
ceased long ago, as to any notion or conscience among men, of holy, divine and
Christian; that is the appointments, institutions, messages, or orders of Jesus
Christ; which could never carry any such marks of divine credit and authority,
merely from vulgar credulity and forwardness of reception; or from general
common talk and tradition among men, if there had been no peculiar men
appointed by God, in his name and by his Commission, to hold forth to the world
this great salvation; to convince, or convert, or leave men without excuse; As
there can be no valid message, autoritative Embassy, credible assignment or
conveyance, of truth, promise, command, duty, comfort, bounty, or love to
others, where there is only a general fame and unauthorised report; without
any special Messenger, Ambassador, Assigner, and Conveyer; to the authority of
whose speech, and actions, or conveyances, not any man's own forwardness, nor
others easi^ess, and credulity does suffice; but some peculiar characters,
Seals and evidences, by letters of credence, or other sure and known tokens of
a truly assigned and really derived authority, do give ground to believe, or
power to validate, what any man so performs, not in his own name, or for his
own interests, but to an others; who principally employs him; and who only can
make good, what he so far promises, or declares, or seals, as he has
commission and authority from another so to do: No man that speaks or
negotiates in another name, especially in matters of great consequence, of as
high a nature, as life and death, can expect to be believed by wise and serious
men; and that they should accordingly order both their affections, and all
their affairs; unless they saw the marks of infallible authority; far beyond
the confidence of a trivial talker, and a bad orator. In this point then of a
peculiar office and function of the Ministry Evangelical, which is divinely
instituted, in which, some men are solemnly invested; by which, all Religion is
confirmed and preserved to the Church; We have, not only full measure from
Christ himself, and heaped up by Apostolical precept and example, evidently set
forth in the Scriptures, and pressed down by after Histories of the Church, in
a constant succession; but it is also running over by those necessary
accumulations, which all right reason, order, and prudence, do liberally
suggest, both in the Theory, and the Practick.

8. The peculiar Office of the Ministry confirmed by Reason.
For, first, no man by any natural capacity, or acquired ability as a reasonable
Creature, is bound in conscience, to be a Minister of the Gospel, and holy
Mysteries to others; for then, all men and women too ought to be such, or else
they sin.

Secondly, Nor yet by any civil and politic capacity, as living in any
Society, or City, can any man be obliged to direct, and guide others in the
things of God; since, that relation invests no man in any civil power, office,
or authority, until the supreme fountain of civil power calls him to the place,
and endues him with such power; much less, can it put any into an authority,
which is divine, spiritual, and supernatural; to act, as in Gods and Christ's
name, and to higher ends, than humane.

3. Nor thirdly, does any rel gious common capacity, as a believer, or a
Christian, or as endued with gifts and graces, furnish any one with Ministerial
power, and lay that duty on him; for then every Christian, great and small,
young and old, man and woman, 1 Cor. 12.25, 29. Are all Apostles? are all
Prophets? are all Teachers, etc. 18. All are not, nor are any such as they are
Christians or gracious, etc. 1 Cor. 12.
ought to minister holy things to others; to challenge the Keys of Heaven to
themselves; to be as in Christ's stead, to rule and oversee his house; which
cannot avoid, as the Apostle proves, abominable absurdities, and detestable
confusions; no way beseeming the wisdom of Christ, the majesty of Christian
Religion, or that order and decency which ought to be in Church Assemblies;
being as contrary to reason, as if every servant in an house should chal^enge
the power of the Keys, and the Stewards place; or every member, the office of
the eyes, tongue, and hands, by virtue of that common relation it has, (as
well as these parts) to the same body, the same soul and head.

As then right reason tells us, beyond all reply, That neither natural, nor
civil, nor religious, common gifts, endowments, or abilities instate any person
in the office of Magistrate, Judge, Ambassador, Herald, Notary, or public
Sealer, Fraus est and injuria quic quid agitur sub alterius persona, sine
debita ab illo autoritate. Reg. Jur. Matthew. 28.18. All power ((...)) or
authority is given unto me in Heaven, and in Earth; that is, in order to
perfect Christ's design, his Churches good. Acts 1.8. Autoritas delegata, ab
alt^rius voluntate pendet; tam quoad ipsam potestat^m, quam ad derivandi modum.
Reg. Jur. 1 Cor. 4.19. I will know, not the speech of them that are puffed up,
but the power. V. 20. For the Kingdom of God is not in word, but in power. i.
e. That holy polity and orderly Kingdom, which Jesus Christ has set up and
governs in his Church, is not managed by confident praters, but by
authoritative Preachers. Matthew. 7.28. As Christ Jesus, so his true Ministers
teach and administer holy things, as men having authority, and not as the
Scribes.
(which places require, not only personal sufficiencies for the office; but an
orderly designation and induction to it, from the fountain of civil power,
either mediately or immediately:) The same right reason (which is most
agreeable and servient to true Christian Religion) requires a right derivation,
or conveyance, of all supernatural, Ministerial, Church power (which is in, and
from Jesus Christ, as the sole supreme head, and divine origin of it) either
immediately, as they and none others had, to whom Christ first consigned it,
and both by miraculous gifts and works confirmed it to be in them; or
mediately, as those Bishops and Presbyters had it, who without force, fraud, or
any sinister way of usurpation, or bold intrusion, received this power from the
Apostles, by prayer and benediction, with imposition of their hands, in the
name of Christ; and from them, their successors have lawfully derived it
(without interruption) to the true Ministers of the Gospel, even to this day
(as I have proved;) which not only the Scriptures, of undisputable verity, but
even those other, very credible Histories of the Church, and other Records of
learned and holy Men in all ages to these times, which the providence of God
has afforded us, do abundantly declare; all which to deny, with a morose
perverseness, or rustical indiffere^cy, is, as if a Hog should answer all
arguments with grunting. And to act contrary to so strong a stream of
concurrent Authorities, both as to the judgment and practice of the Church in
all ages, is a work only fit for Ranters, and Seekers, and Fanatics; or for
Jews, Turks, and Heathen Infidels, but not for any sober Christian that owns in
the least kind, the Name of Jesus Christ; or desires to be a member of any
true Christian Church: In which, as all true and humble Christians have always
enjoyed, and with thankfulness owned the rightful succession and authority of
their o^dained Ministers, Pastors, and Teachers; so the Lord from Heaven, in
all ages, has witnessed to them; by his blessings of truth and peace, on the
hearts of his people, and by their means chiefly continuing the light of the
Gospel, to these days, amidst those Heathenish persecutions, Heretical
confusions, and Schismatical fractions, which have sought to overthrow, the
Being, or the Purity, or the Order and Unity of the true Church.

To this judgment and testimony of Scriptures, and ancient Writers (both in
right and fact) I might add a cloud of witnesses, from later reformed Divines,
which were very learned and very holy men, far above the vulgar spirits, both
in other Churches, and in this of England, all agreeing with our excellent
Bishop Jewel, Bishop Jewels Apology. Ministrum Ecclesiae legitime vocari
oportere, and recte atque ordine praefici ecclesiae Dei: Neminem autem ad
sacrum Ministerium pro suo arbitrio ac ibidine posse se intrudere.
That no may may intrude himself into the Ministry by his own will and
pleasure; or by any others, who are not of that Order and Calling; but he ought
to be lawfully called, and duly ordained by those, in whom the lawful
succession of ordinative power, ever has been, and still is rightly placed and
continued. Agreeable to which, there is a whole Jury of eminent Modern Divines,
alleged by a late industrious and ingenuous See Master Halls Pulpit guarded.

4. I may add by way of confirmation of that common equity, and rules of order,
which must be among men in all things; and most necessarily in things truly
religious, The inviolable Function, and peculiar Office or Order of the Priests
and Levites; which were the Ministers of the Lord, in his ancient Church of the
Jews; which is a most convincing instance, to prove not the sameness and
succession of that Order, but the equity; comeliness, and exemplariness of a
peculiar Ministry, for holy things, among Christians under the Gospel; since
that Levitical Ministry was not more holy, or honorable, nor more distinguished
in power, and authority, and office from the people, than this in the Christian
Church; which is more immediately derived from Christ, as clearly instituted
and ordained by him, and more fully exhibitive of him, both in the Historical
Truths, and in the Mystical gifts and graces of his Spirit: Yet we see, who so
despised or violated that Order and Ministry among the Jews, under pretense of
a common holiness in Gods people, (who were in a spiritual sense indeed called
an holy Nation and a royal Priesthood) so as to confound the Functions and
Offices, divinely distinguished, either the earth from beneath devoured them,
or some other remarkable judgment fell upon them, as on King Uzzah; So long,
as Gods love to the Jews was seconded with his jealousy for their good. When
(indeed) their Apostacies and Rebellions had alienated Gods love from them, he
then suffered those sad and unsanctified levellings to come among them,
consecrating the meanest of the people, and who ever would relieve his worldly
necessities, by being a Priest to those Talismanick Calves; under which new
modes and figurations, the Israelites were for some wicked reason of State,
persuaded by Jeroboam to worship their God. So Herod when he had got the
Kingdom over the Jews, (ex ima and infima ^l^be constituit sacerdotes) made of
the basest people Priests, etc. Eusebius. Hist. l. 1. c. 7. Which severe
indulgence of God to them, in suffering them to have such sorry and
unsanctified Priests, was no other, but a fearful presaging of those
desolations, which soon after befell that people of Israel for the sins of
Jeroboam; who by his policy of new fashioned Priests, and levelled, that is,
abolished, and profaned Religion, is for ever branded with that mark of making
Israel to sin, 1 King. 13.34.
and was the occasion of cutting off his name, and destroying his posterity
from off the face of the earth. Certainly, in times, when the Jews feared God,
if all the Priests and Levites, whom God had appointed to minister before him,
had failed by death, or defection, the Ark in the Wilderness must have stood
still, or the service of the Temple have ceased, till by some new Commission or
Authority, the Lord had signified his pleasure to his Church and people: Nor
would the devout and zealous Jews have thought presently, every stout Porter,
or lusty Butcher, would well enough supply the room of the Priests and Levites;
much less would they have beat and crowded the true Priests yet living, and
serving in their offices and courses, out of their places, only because those
others had naturally should^rs, which could bear the Ark and the holy Vessels;
or hands, which had skill to slay a beast, and dress a sacrifice. I see no
reason, why the Evangelical Ministry should be less sacred or inviolable, since
it has as much of reason, order, usefulness, and necessity; also no less
express authority from Christ, and divine Institution; (...). Is. Pel. l. ^.
together with many hundreds of years holy and constant succession in all
Churches: That to invade this, or violate and abrogate it, seems no less to any
true Christian, than to crowd Christ out of his throne; to justle him out of
his Priestly, Prophetic, and Kingly Offices: It is like Julian the Apostate,
loudly to blaspheme, or proudly to resist, and insolently to do despite too
that holy Spirit of truth, power, and order; by which, these ((...)) gifts of
power, and authority Ministerial, have always been, and are still given and
dispensed to his Church, in the way which Christ appointed; which the holy
Apostles practiced, and the Christian Churches have always imitated.

who, by the light of nature, 10. Light of Nature in the Heathens. Diu proximi

and that innate veneration of some Deity, which they esteemed the inventer and
institutor of their Religion, agreed always in this; That, whatever Gods or
Religions they owned, their holy Rites and Mysteries were always publick^y
taught, celebrated, and maintained, by such as were solemnl^ invest d with, and
reverenced under the peculiar name and honor of that sacr^d Office, and
s^cerdotal Function, which they held divine, as Her^d tus tells us; which

tells us, both among Romans and Greeks, they generally in all Cities paid
great honor and respect to their Priests and holy men; because those obtained
of the gods good things, not only for themselves, and their families, but for
the whole Cities where they lived. Tacitus tells us, That the chief Priests
were also, by the Divine Munificence esteemed the chiefest of men, least
subject to anger, envy, or other mean affections from any men: So Aul. Gellius
set^ down at large the solemnities and honors for vestments and other regards,
which among the Romans was used toward the Flamines Diales, or chief Priests;
whom they esteemed next their gods, whose word was always to be taken without
any oath; they thought all holy things profaned, if any men unsacred presumed
to meddle with them, or partake of them; much more, if such an one officiated
in them.

It cannot be any thing of true Christian piety or holiness, which makes any
men in the Church of Christ degenerate from the very principles of nature;
whose light is never despised by any, but those, that are without natural
affections, among other their black Characters, which are proper to those, who
have a f^rm of godliness, but deny the power of it; The strangest prodigies
that ever were indeed, of so profane a wantonness, under pretenses of enlarged
piety; striving to remove all bounds of duty, and respect to God or man; nor
did ever sober men think themselves absolved from that honor and respect, which
is due to God and his holy Service or Ministry, because of the personal
infirmities which may be seen in those that are his Ministers to us: We shall
neither as men nor Christians, have any to serve God or man in the way of true
Christian Religion, if we will allow none with their failings: The Divine is to
be distinguished from the Man; there may be the power of God with the weakness
of man, as in Saint Paul; Nor need we be more choice and curious, than God
himself is.

11. A peculiar Office of Ministry, necessary for the Church.
6. Nor is there a greater benefit and convenience to the Church, than a
necessity of having a special calling and divine institution of the Ministers
of the Gospel; For we may not in this trust to the good natures and good wills
of Christians in common, (if personal abilities and willingness would make a
Minister of Christ, which they will not:) Certainly, no men are so good natured
of themselves, (without hopes of gain or some benefit) as of their own good
will, to undertake, and constantly to persevere in so hard and hazardous
(besides so holy) a service, as this, of holding forth to a vain, proud,
carnal, hypocritical, Vera cruce digni qui crucifixum adorant. Insana religio.

persecuting, and devilish world, so de picable and ridiculous a doctrine, as
this of a crucified Savior at first was, and still seems to the natural, or
only ((...)) rational man; unless there were by the wisdom and authority of
Christ, such ties of duty and calling laid upon some men's consciences, as,
only the mission and mandate of God can lay upon men; who are not naturally
more disposed to go on Gods errand, than Moses, or Jeremy, or Jonah were: And
however, now the peace, warmth, and serenity of times, has made the Ministry
of the Gospel, a matter of covetousness, or popular ambition, or curiosity, or
wantonness, to many of these new Preachers, who with rashness, levity, and a
kind of frolickness, undertake that work, which the best men and Angels
themselves, would not without much weeping (as Saint Austine that day when he
was ordained a Presbyter) or with fear and trembling undertake; yet the rigor
and storms of primitive times (it is very probable) would have quenched the now
so forward heats and flashes of these men's spirits: When to Preach the Gospel,
and to preside, as a Bishop or Presbyter, in the Church, was to expose a man's
self to the front of persecution; to stand in the gap against the violent
incursions of malicious men, and cruel devils; To be a Minister of Jesus
Christ, was presently to forsake all, and to take up the Cross and follow
Christ; to adopt, with holy orders, famine and nakedness, banishment, prisons,
beasts, racks, fires, torments, many deaths in one; so that, unless there had
been divine authority enjoining, power enabling, and special grace assisting,
the Ordainers in the Name of Christ sending, and so in conscience binding;
together with gracious promises of a reward in Heaven, encouraging the
ordained; doubtless, the glorious Gospel of man's salvation, had ere this been
buried in oblivion; none had believed that report, nor heard of it, if none had
dared to preach it; and none would of his own good will, have been so hardy, or
prodigal of all worldly interests, honor, liberty, safety, estate, and life, as
to adventure all needlessly, and spontaneously, on such a message to others, so
unwonted, so unwelcome, so offensive to the ears and hearts of men, unless he
had been conscious to a spe^ial d^ty laid upon him, by divine authority; which
was always derived in that holy and solemn Ordination, which was the
inauguration of Ministers to that great and sacred Work.

This indeed gave so great confirmation and courage to the true and ord^ined
Ministers of the Gospel, that, believing, what they preached of a crucified
Savior; and knowing whose work it was, in whose Name they were ordained, by
whose power they were sent, to how great ends their labors were designed, even
to save souls; they willingly bare the Cross of Christ, Acts 5.41.
and counted it a crown and honorary addition to their Ministry, to be thought
worthy to suffer for the Name of Christ; that what any of them wanted in the
power of miracles, was made up in the wonder of their patience; when no Armies,
no State, favored them, and both opposed them; when they had no temptations of
getting a better living by preaching, than any other way; but rather losing of
what they had; when they expected few applauders of their boldness and
forwardness; many persecutors and opposers of their conscientious endeavors to
do the duty, which Christ, by the Church, had laid on them; when they might not
grow restive and lazy, and knock off when they pleased; but a woe, and a
necessity, and an heavy account, to be given to the great Pastor of the Church,
Christ Jesus, always founded in their ears, and beat upon their minds: These
put them upon those Heroic resolutions, to endure all things for Christ's sake,

and the Churches sake, and the good of those souls committed to their charge.
Nor did they remit their care, or slacken the conscience of their duty, in
preaching diligently the Gospel, because of the forwardness and seeming zeal of
those, that were false Brethren and false Apostles; who out of envy, or spite,
or for filthy lucre, or any vainglory among Christians, set up the trade of
preaching, upon their own stock of boldness; without any mission from Christ,
or those, to whom he had delegated that power to ordain fit and able men: Their
seeming good will, and readiness to preach, did not free them from the brand of
false Apostles, and deceitful workers; Satan's ministers, and messengers sent to
buffet, not to build the Church; Wolves in sheeps clothing, serving their
bellies, and not the Lord Christ, or the Churches good; whose order and
authority they despise: Nor can they be faithful to Gods work, unless they keep
to his word; both, as to the truths delivered, and the order prescribed, and
the duties enjoined, and the authority established: Christ does not only
provide food for his family; but stewards also, and dispensers of it, who may,
and must see to give every one their portion in due season, rightly dividing
the Word of truth; There is not only plenty, but order and government in
Christ's house; nothing less becomes the servants of Christ, than this sharking
and scrambling way of these new men, who will snatch and carve for themselves,
and dispense to others, what, when, and how they list. It is justly to be
feared, they are thieves, and come but to steal and d str^^* who like not to
come in at Christ's door, but are thus clambr^^^ ^very where over the wall; and
(confident of their numbers) dare to do it, ^^t in the darkness of their Night
Conventicles, but (as A^sal^ms incestuous rapes) at the noonday, and in the
eyes of this whole Church; to its great grief and shame, and to its no little
danger; These intruders appearing more like plunderers of the reformed
Religion, than any way like to be humble able and faithful Preachers; Nothing
can portend good to the Church of Christ, that carrys besides gross defects
such a face of disorder, violence, insolency and confusion; which, if these
ways of some men do not, many wise and godly Christians have lost their eyes.
12. The weight of the work of the Ministry requires peculiar and appropriated
workmen to it.


7. Furthermore, One great mistake of our Antiministeriall Levellers is, from
that mean and ordinary esteem, they have of the work, duty, and undertaking of
a Minister; this makes them have so slight and indifferent thoughts of it, both
as to the ability and authority; requiring very small measure of true
abilities, and none at all of due authority; further, than any presumer of his
gifts, will challenge to himself.

When as indeed, all reason, Religion, and holy examples, do teach us; See S^.
Chrysostom. (...), largely and eloquently setting forth what excellencies are
required in a Minister above other men; says (...), as in a Shepherd above the
Sheep, etc. 2 Timothy 2.15.
That the work of a Minister of the Gospel is not merely a matter of lip
labor, of voluble speech, of confident countenance; making a show, and
flourish to others of that knowledge, reading, memory and elocution, which any
man may have upon an ordinary account: There goes more to make a workman, than
to have good materials and tools amassed together; To heap up these, or lay
them forth to others view is not to build. To be arbitrarily, or occasiona^ly;
or impertinently, or charitably busy in exercising men's private gifts, as to
Christian knowledge, is not presently, to do that great and good work, which
the Apostle commends, which Christ enjoins his Ministers, and which the Church
needs. Every one that can handle the Hod, or the Mattock, or the Trowell, is
not instantly an Architect, or may vye with Vitruvius. Nor can every knowing
Christian, discharge that part of a thoroughly furnished workman, who needs not
to be ashamod: as having materials, and Tools, and skill, and command.

There is a great difference between that plausible cunning, H^c habent
haeritici artificiu^, plus per suadent, quam docent, cum verit^s docendo
persuadet, non persuadendo docet. Tertul. adv. Vul. (...). Acts 20.30. (...). 2
Cor. 2.17. Who use the word of God as Hucksters do good ware, mixing it with
bad to mend it the better. N^gotium illi^ in verbi administratione, non
Ethnicos convertens, sed nostros evertendi nostra suffodjun^, ut sua
aedificent. Tertul. adv. Haer. c. 42.
which draws Desciples after men's selves, and that Ministerial conscience
which makes Disciples to Christ; between the setting up among the many popular
Masters, who love to hear themselves speak, and the being sent as Ambassadors,
to speak in the name of Christ; which is, not to get a petty Magistery and name
among men; but to make known, as they ought, the holy name and mysteries of
Jesus Christ: Nor is this, only to walk in the cool of the day; in the midst of
an Independent Paradise (which other Ministers labors have planted, (where
some elderly, better instructed, and wealthier Christians fancy they want
nothing to complete them, but the contentment of an imaginary Reign and Empire;
and are content to allow liberally to any Minister, that will assume them into
a participation of Church power, that they may but think themselves to rule;)
But it requires such an humble diligence, as is willing to bear the heat and
burden of the day; to contend with younger ignorance, and elder obstinacy, and
aged tetricalness; not disdaining, nor nauseating the cramb of Catechizing, to
which principles few of the new modelling Preachers will de^cend: as loath to
abate of those high-soring notions, and seraphick speculations, in which they
please themselves, more, than any of their hearers; Vulgus quae non intelligunt
impensius mirantur. Jerome.
who seek to profit our souls, rather than vainly to applaud their vainer
teacher; who thus new dressed and set up greatly despises his poor neighbor
Ministers pains, serving only to breed up, as in a nursery, such plants, as he
is to transplant to his congregationall Garden, and so to gather in due time
the fruits of them to himself.

No, the work of a worthy Minister is such, as must fit him, as well to stoop
to lay the lowest foundations, in the youngest Cathechists; as to set up the
Crown and Corner stone of the highest Pinnacle in the most advanced Christians:
He must know how to treat, both the weak and the strong, the idiot and the
learned, the babes and simple, as well as the men grown and well-instructed;
that scorns not the meanest, nor fears to do his duty to the greatest in the
world; (...). Tit. ^.7.8.
To which work there ought to be such an a dequation, as to do every thing
becoming so high and heavenly a Master; so holy and great a work, wherein the
Apostle requires as to the doctrine and manners too uncorruptness, gravity,
sincerity, sound speech, that cannot be condemned, etc. so that the Office and
work of a Minister requires, De Sacerdote Chrysostom. (...). 1 Timothy 6.20. 2 Timothy
1.14. That good thing which was committed to thy trust, keep, etc. Heb 13.17.

not only communicative abilities for knowledge and utterance, but imports also
duty, conscience, care, solicitousness, skill, fidelity, diligence,
intentiveness, zeal, exactness, prudence and highest discretion, as in a most
weighty matter, of infinite concernment; wherein the glory of God, the honor
of our Savior, and the good of men's souls is highly engaged. So that it is,
not a spontaneous courtesy, or a pleasant variety, or a plausible novelty, or a
profitable art, and trade or m^stery of living; but a serious custody
committed, a precious charge deposited, and a strict account to be returned, of
the Ministerial negotiation and function.

What is requisite in a Minister. (...). Ezekiel. 1. Is. Pel. l. 1. Ep. 151.
(...). Gr. Nis. de Cast.
So that a Minister had need to have the eye and illumination of an Angel, the
heart and compassion of a Father, the tenderness and indulgence of a Mother,
the caution and courage of a Commander, the vigilance of a Watchman, the
patience of a Shepherd, the zeal of a lover, the diligence of a woer, the
gallantry and honor of an Ambassador, who as he gives no cause, so knows not
how with patience to see his Master or Message affronted or neglected; The
wisdom and discretion of a Counselor; The constancy and resolution of a Pilot;
whom no storm must drive from the Steerage, whom it becomes to be drowned with
his hand on the helm.

For a true Minister who is enabled by God, approved by man, (...). vocat.

and so duly sent and ordained by both, to the service of Christ in the Church,
has upon him, not only something of the honor and authority, but of the duty
and care of Parents; and that right of primogeniture, which from Christ is
derived to them; as from the elder among many brethren; which is to teach,
instruct, provide for, direct and govern in the things of God, the younger
succession of the family of Christ: Yea more, every true Minister has part of
the work of God assigned to him, having a Deputation, or Lieutenancy from
Christ to fulfill what he has graciously undertaken, (not as to meritorious
satisfaction (which Christ alone has perfected, but) as to Ministerial
instruction and pastoral government; teaching mankind, to know the will of
God, how he is to be served, and how they may be saved, yea, and ruling them
that are Christ's with his Scepter; Furnished as the Ark with the Law, with
Manna, and with Aarons rod, to convince men of sin, to comfort them with
promises, and to keep them in holy bounds by just authority and Christian
Discipline.

So that true Ministers stand as in Parents, so in Gods and Christ's stead, as
to the visible means and outward work of divine institution; 1 Cor. 4.7.
which the Lord has chosen to dispense by such earthen vessels; that, as they
have some reflections and marks of divine authority, and honor more than

of this work, as it ought to be done: In reference to which great and sacred
employment, the Lord Christ, fasted, Luke 6.12.

and after they had enjoyed his holy society, and instruction for some years,

difficulties they should encounter; what beasts, and men, and devils they were
to contend withal; besides, how strange and incredible a message they went

(...) the ^ntients had of the Ministry of the Gospel, and with what spirit

8. And according to this so emn both institution and preparation of the first
Ministers of the Go^pell, which Christ sent (in whose power, and after whose
pattern, as near as may be, all others ought to succeed in ^he Church) all holy,
wise, able and humble Christians have always looked, not without horror,
trembling, and amazement, upon the Office and work of the Ministry, until the
pride and presumption of these times; Anciently the worthy Bishops and
Ministers were, both before and after their Ordination to this Office, still
asking this question, in their souls, who is sufficient for these things; and
what shall I do (being a Minister) to be saved: still jealous, lest while they
Preach to others, themselves prove castaways. 2 Cor. 2.16. 1 Cor. 9.27. De
propria anima negligens in aliena esse non potest solicitus. Jeron.
However now youthful confidences, or rusticall boldness, or vainglorious
wantonness, or ambitious ostentations, or covetous projects, or secular
interests, or friends importunities, or fortunes necessities, and stimulating
despairs, to live any other way; these (God knows) are too often the main
motives, which put many men upon the work of the Ministry: Yet, Those grand and
eminent men of old, whose gifts and graces far exceeded our modern tenuities,
came not to this holy Ordination, nor undertook this service of God to the
Church, either as Bishops or Presbyters, without infinite reluct^nce, Naz. Or.

grief, dread and astonishment; They had a constant horror of the worth and
danger of men's souls; which only Christ could redeem with a valuable price; the
loss of which, a whole world cannot countervail; also of the terrors of the
Lord to slothful and unfaithful servants in that work; also of the strictness
of accounts to be given at Christ's tribunal; They had before their eyes, that
boundless Ocean of business into which a Minister, once ordained lancheth
forth, and is engaged; to study, to preach, to pray, to fast, to weep, to
compassionate, to watch-over, to visit, to rep oove, to exhort, to comfort, to
contend, with evil and unreasonable men, devi^s and powers of darkness: to
take care of young and old, to temper himself to novices, cathecumens; to
confirmed, to lapsed, to obstinate, to penitent, to ignorant and erroneous, to
heretical surlyness, to schismatic peevishness, to become all things to all
men to gain some.

The work indeed requires says St. Chrysostom, (...). Crysost. in Act. 3.
(...), etc. Synes. ep. 105. (...). ^d. 2 Cor. 11.29. Who is weak, and I am not
weak? who is offended, and I burn not? (...).
a most ample and en^^rged soul, lest any under our charge be ignorant, by our
negl^ct; be misled by our errors, justly scanda^ized by us, and hardened against
us; lest any saving truth be wasted or concealed, any soul wound^d, any
conscience or faith shipwracked; lest any weaker faith faint, any stronger
fall; lest any be tempted and seduced by Satan, or his Factors: In fine, lest
any poor soul should be dam^ed by our default; which is by Christ committed to
our charge, as Ministers of, and for Jesus Christ; whose work is to see, that
the sufferings of Christ be not in vain; that the sovereign salves and balms of
his blood, may be duly applied, to the benumbed, to the tender, to the wounded
consciences, to the broken, and bleeding, to the stony and hardened, to the
fleshy and flinty hearts.

This so prodigious a work, and more than humane undertaking, to be a Minister
of the Gospel, either as a Bishop, or Presbyter, (for neither the difference,
nor the distance, was great in point of the main work, either of teaching or
governing; only, the higher place, had the greater care, and the more honor
drew with it the greater burden of duty) made those holy men of old, so loath
and unwilling to yield themselves to the desires, importunities, and even
violencies of those Christians, who looked upon them, Ambr. off. l. 1. c. 1.
Ego invitus de tr bunalibus atque administrationis infulis ad sacerdotium.
Vita. B. Ambrosii.
as fit for so great a work in the Church; they said, Nolo Episcopari, in good
earnest. Saint Ambrose was for his learning, integrity, piety, and eloquence,
so esteemed in his secular employment, as a Judge; that the faithful people of
Millan (otherways divided by the Arrian faction) thought none more fit to be
their Bishop, and chief Pastor; to guide, by teaching and governing them, in
matters of Religion. They in a manner forced him, from the Tribunal, to the
Throne, or Cathedral, with pious compulsions, which to avoid, he fled by night,
and after a nights wandering, found himself next morn at Millan: He put on the
face of cruelty and bloodiness, invited loose and lewd people to haunt his
house; that he might seem unworthy of that dignity, and deter them from the
choice: Which (he tell s us) he suffered not without an holy impatience;
complaining of the injury done him; and he would not have yielded, if he had
not been persuaded, that the impulse and motion of the people, so resolute, so
zealous, and so unanimous, was from God; whose pleasure was thereby signified
to him; That leaving secular affairs, he had work for him to do in his Church;
which he discharged with great diligence, courage, and fidelity, after he was
baptized, duly ordained a Presbyter, and consecrated to be a Bishop; To whose
learned and holy eloquence, the Church owes, besides other excellent fruits,
the happy conversion of Saint Austine.

In like sort Saint Jerome tells us of Nepotian, That when his holy learning
and life had so recommended him, that he was generally desired to be made a
Minister of the Church; Nepotianus eo dignio^ erat quo se clamabat indignum,
populus quaerebat, etc. Humilitate superabat invidiam, Jer. ad Holiodorum.

he first hid himself; When he was found, they brought him to Ordination, as it
were to execution, weeping, deprecating, and deploring with unfeigned
earnestness; protesting how unfit, how unworthy he was, for that great work;
whom nothing could have made more fit and worthy, than so great humility, with
so great holiness and ability: Some (as Ammonius) did maim and deform
themselves to avoid this great undertaking. Saint Austine, a man of
incomparable abilities, professes, That he esteems nothing more difficult,
laborious and dangerous in this world, than the office of a Bishop, or
Presbyter; though nothing be more glorious and accepted before God, if the work
be discharged so, as we have in charge from our chief commander and Bishop, the
Lord Jesus Christ. Hence (says he) were those tears, which he could not
forbear to shed plentifully on the day of his Ordination; which others wondered
at then; and he after gives the world an account of them: O humble, holy,
happy, well-placed tears, which watered on that occasion, one of the most
devout, diligent and fruitful souls, that ever the Church of Christ enjoyed.

Saint Chrysostom also (a great and glorious star of the first magnitude in
the Firmament of the Church; who filled the Orb in which he was placed, and
equalled by his eloquent worth, the eminency of the City (Constantinople) where
he sat as Bishop) passionately bemoans his condition, and all of his order, as
Bishops, and Ministers of the Church; (...). Chrysostom. In act. 3. (...). Chrysostom.

man in the eminency of his place, could be intent to the salvation of his own
soul.
professing, That he thinks the work, the danger, and the difficulties so
great, that a Bishop and Minister had need have an hundred hands, and as many
eyes to avoid scandals, and to dispatch the employment: So that he protests,
That he cannot see, how many Bishops or Ministers can be saved; yea, and
believes far more are damned, than saved. Synesius also professes, Had he been
aware of the vastness of the work, and charge of souls, he would have chosen
many deaths, rather than have been a Bishop, or Presbyter in the Church; as he
was, and a ve y worthy one too, from an eloquent and learned Philosopher. Thus,
and to this tune, generally all those ancient Bishops, and most eminent
Ministers of the Church; (...). Greg. Nis. vita Thaum. Quanto in praecipitio

and this, not out of restiveness, cowardice, or want of zeal, piety, and
charity, but merely out of unfeigned humility; (as Moses, Jeremiah, Isaiah,
Ezekiel, and others,) abasing themselves, out of the high esteem they had of
the glory of Christ, the honor of his Religion, the dignity of his Ministry,
and the pretiousness of souls, for which, he had shed his sacred blood.

on our hands; nor the burden lighter; nor are our arms and shoulders stronger
in these days, than in former times; that any men's confidence in undertaking,
or forwardness in obtruding on that calling, should be now so great; when,
indeed, we have (now) not only downright ignorance, and blunter rusticity, or
heathenish simplicity, or barbarous unbelief to contend with; but also
schismatical curiosities, fanatical novelties, heretical subtilties,
superstitious vanities, cruel hypocrisies, political profanenesses, spiritual
wickednesses to encounter. We are to deal, as Ministers even here in England,
not with raw Novices, and callow Christians, or mere strangers to Religious
Mysteries; but with such, as by much handling matters of Religion, are grown
callous men, of brawny hands, gross humors, Periculosissimus animo morbus est
((...)) spiritualis inappetentia, and (...), illa ^ause^bunda, quae satietat^
in sac^is laborat. Cameron. Numb. 11.5.
of tough hearts; such as think themselves fat, and so full fed with Religious
Notions, that they are grown pursey, almost surfeted, and past their appetite;
longing like glutted and pampered Jews, for any novelties, though it be for
Garlic, and Leeks, and Onyons, amidst their superfluities of Quails and Manna:
Nothing pleases their clogged stomachs, that is old, though never so true;
nothing comes amiss, if it be but dressed up with novelty; old Christianity set
on the new block of faction: O how welcome to many is a new Church way, a new
fashioned Ministry, new ordered Sacraments, new interpreted Scriptures? With
these wanton, proud, idle, lazy, coy, and scornful tempers, have we Ministers
now to contest; with such Sophisters, as are ignorant, yet proud of their
knowledge; need teaching, yet affect to be teachers; such as cast off all true
Ministry, and Church Orders, and Government, when they most want them (as
Feverish men do clothes to make them sweat, when they kick them off.)

It is harder to deal with such men's arrogant, Difficulties in the Work of the
Ministry.
extravagant humors; with their various, subtle, and sublime fancies in
Religion, (which are like the running Gout, every where painful, no where
permanent; very offensive, though very unfixed) than with those plainer
simplicities, and that downright profaneness, which are in Heathens, and mere
ignorant ones, who never took any tincture of Christian Religion; whose ruder
and open persecutions, were not more pestilent to the true Christian Ministry
and Religion, than these craftier underminings are.

Nor do the Ministers of England so flatter themselves, that secular powers are
so propitious to them, as not to find more than ordinary cause to keep up the
dignity and authority of their Calling, by all internal sufficiencies, and
external industry, rather than trust to the favors and benignities of men,
either great or small, few or many. Basil. Mag. lib. de Spir. S. c. 29. (...).
Greg. Niss. (...).
Gregory Thaumaturgus when he was a Bishop of Neocesarea in Pontus, blesses
God, That when he came first to his charge, he found not above seventeen
Christians; and when he departed from them, he left not in all his Diocese, so
many unbaptized, or unbelievers: But the sad task of many excellent Ministers
now is, after many years labors, to work upon the most rugged and ungrateful
Christians, in many places, that ever were: Many grave men after many years
pains, having merited, and expecting from their people, that Christian usage
for love, and respect, which becomes both sides; the more they preach, and the
better they live, and the more they love their people, the more peevish and
froward they find them: Like hot irons, they fly in the face of those that
have heated them, and are daily forging them, both to solidity and beauty in
Religion; these like cross-grained pieces, run with splinters into the hands
and eyes of those that seek to polish them; they affect a petulant piety, and
are taught by some, That much of their Religion consists in despising and
separating from those Ministers, who have baptized and instructed them, and to
whom the care of their souls is orderly committed.

Nor is it only, hence, that the dignity of the Ministry is wounded, and the
difficulties of the work increased, but even from our selves also, who profess
to be Ministers here in England; The Lord of the harvest pardon our over hasty
intrusions, our importune forwardness, our unfitness for the work, our idleness
in it, our vaporings of it, our sinister aims, our crooked motions, our
improving both our selves and others, more to private Factions, than to the
Catholic Faith, or Public Peace; to popularity, rather than to piety; to
pleasing, rather than profiting of people; by which ways, it must be confessed,
many of us, Ministers, have miserably prostrated the honor of this sacred
Fu^ction; increased the difficulties of our work, laid blocks and bars in our
ways; helped to level the dignity of the Function to vulgar insolences; either
contemning or invading it.

As in a^l times, so especially in these, Ministers of the Gospel had need to
be more than men; above the pitch of mortals, little lower than the Angels; who
are to counter work deep and deceitful workers; to undermine and uncase false
Ministers; to bear up, and recover Christian and Reformed Religion, with it
main pillar and support, (the true Ministry) against those that seek to
overthrow it. In the most serene and favorable times to the Church and the
Ministry, a wise and gracious man should fear and tremble (though never so
able, and by others recommended,) to undertake this work; so sacred, so divine,
so justly to be avoided; If men looked not at high, holy, and eternal designs;
yea, I should even think, the best men might well refuse the charge and
calling, till God called thrice (as he did to Samuel,) till he even chid, or
threatened them to the work, 1 Samuel 3.8. Exodus 4.14.
as he did Moses. For if in any undertaking in the world a Christian might be
disobedient, or would be deliberating, and demurring; and ask often of God and
man, Shall I, shall I run, it ought to be in this: Let him that finds not care
and work enough to look to his own soul, cover rashly to take charge of other
men's; how sad is it to see loose and indifferent livers, forward, and earnest
to be Preachers, and undertake a Pastoral Charge? The Lord forgive, what has
been thus hastily hudled, and inconsiderately entered upon by any of us
Ministers; and grant us, that after grace, which may recompense, and as much as
may be, expiate the rashness of the admission and adventure, by the
seriousness, diligence, and conscienciousness of the performance. Men, if they
were well advised, and in good earnest, should rather need spurs and goads to
be driven by others, than bridles, or pikes to keep them off from rushing into
the Ministry.

Nothing has more debased this holy calling, 15. Discouragements from the
tenuity of maintenance.
and discouraged able men from it, than the necessity, here in England, in many
places, to admit some men's tenuity and meanness into the Ministry and Livings;
who had no other motive, but to obtain a morsel of bread, and scarce found that
for their pains; For which necessity a relief was long ago hoped for, and
expected, if not promised, from the piety, and nobleness of the Parliaments of
England; who could not, but see, that in many, if not most parts, either the
Ministers abilities and pains exceeded the Benefice; or the starving tenuity of
the Benefice, like an hungry and barren soil, Innovercante solo satae arbores
quamvis generosiores and feraces cito sterilescunt. Varro. Tenuitatem
beneficiorum necessari^ sequitur ignorantia sacerdotum. Bishop Jewel.
eat up and consumed the Ministers gifts and parts; which at first were florid,
and very hopeful, and so would have thrived, had they not been planted in a
soil that was rather a dry nurse, than a kind mother.

Nor was there then, or is there now, any way to avoid the mischief of
admitting such minute offerers of their selves to the Ministry in places of so
minute maintenance, unless the entertainment were enlarged; as is requisite in
many Livings, where the whole salary is not so much, as the interest of the
money, bestowed in breeding of a Scholar would amount to, which an able
Minister cannot live upon, so as to do his duty; yet this fault of ordaining
and instituting weak Ministers (which arose from the hardness of Laymens
hearts) was better committed, than omitted by the Ordainers; for it was better,
that such small timber (if as strait and sound, as can be had) be put in the
wall, than the house in that place lie quite open, and decayed; Better the poor
people be taught in some measure, the Mysteries and Truth of Religion, than
left wholly wild and ignorant. I know, that as in a building it is not
necessary that all pieces should be great and massy timber, less will serve in
their place and proportion; yet the principal parts ought to be so substantial,
that they might relieve the weaker studs and rafters of the burden; so that no
danger might be to the whole Fabric from their feebleness, so assisted: The
state of the Church ought indeed to be so ordered, that there should be a
competency for all, and a competency in all, Ministers; but in some there ought
to be an eminency; as in employment, so in entertainment; upon whom the
greatest recumbency of Churches may be laid; whose learning, courage, gravity,
tongue, and pen, may be able to sustain the weight of Religion, in all
controversies and oppositions; which assertings and vindications require, not
only good will and courage, but great strength and dexterity. The ablest
Minister, if he well ponders what he has to do, has no cause to be very
forward, nor should the meanest, that is honest and congruous, have cause to
despond, or be discouraged in his good endeavors.

Great care ought to be had for Ordination of able Ministers, and for
augmentation of their Means to competency.
To restore the Reformed Christian Ministry in this Church, to its true honor,
there should be greatest care had in the matter of ordination, before which,
anciently the Church had solemn Fasting, Prayer, and Humiliation; But in vain
(as to many places, which all need able Ministers) will this care be, unless
there be also some necessary augmentation of Ministers maintenance; As the
ablest men should be invited to the work, so none unable should be admitted;
and none, once admitted, should have cause by the incompetency of their
condition to be ashamed; and by their poverty, contract inabilities; as Trees
grow mossie, and unfruitful in barren soyls. Nor would this pious munificence
be thought much by any Christian Nation, to which God has been so liberal in
his earthly bounty; if they did indeed value his heavenly dispensations, and
the necessity, work, or worth, either of true Ministers, or of poor men's souls;
whom itinerant Preachers cannot feed sufficiently, with a bit and a way; but
they require constant and resident Ministers to make them thrifty and
well-liking. I conclude this Paragraph, touching the great work of the
Ministry, with that Character of an able Minister, which St. Bernard has
admirably set forth to Eugenius, the then Bishop of Rome, by which we may see,
what sense was in those days (Four hundred and fifty years ago) of the duty of
Ministers, and what kind of ones, holy men then required in the Church; from
whom, our succession, without any disparagement from men's personal faults, is
derived.

Such (says Saint Bernard) are to be chosen, Tales eligendi sunt Ministri qui
sunt compositi ad mores, probati ad sanctimoniam, para ^ ad obedientiam
subjecti ad diciplinam, rigid ad censuram, Catholici ad fidem; fideles ad
dispensationem, concordes ad pacem, conformes ad unitatem. Qui regibus Johannem
exhibeant, Egyptsis Mosen, fornicatibus Phineam, Heliam idolatris, Helisaum
av^^is, Petrum mentientibus, Paulu^ blasphemantibus, Christum nego^tantibus.
Qui vulgus non spernant sed doce^nt, non gravent sed foveant. Minas principum
non paveant sed contemnant, qui marsupia non exhauriant sed corda reficiant. De
omni re orationi plus fidant quam industriae sua. O si videam in vita mea
Ecclesiam tatibus ni^a^^ columnis. O si Domini sponsam cernerem tantae
commissa^^ fidei, tanta creditam puritati; quid nec ^^a^i^s, quidve securius.
Bern. l. 1. ad Eugenium.
and ordained for Ministers of the Church, who are composed for their manners;
approved for their sanctimony; ready to obey their Superiors; subject to
Discipline; strict in their Censures; Catholic for their Faith; faithful in
their Preaching; conform to the peace and unity of the Church; Who to Kings,
may be as John Baptist; to Egyptians, as Moses; to Fornicators, as Phineas; to
Idolaters, as Elias; to Covetous, as Elisha; to Liars, as Peter; to
Blasphemers, as Paul; to Symonaical and Sacrilegious Trafickers in the Church,
as Christ to the Buyers and Sellers in the Temple. Such, as may not burden, or
despise the poor, but nourish and instruct them; not flatter, and fawn on the
rich, but rather rouse and affright their proud security; not terrified by
threats of Princes, but living and acting above them; not exhausting men's
purses, but comforting their consciences, and filling their hungry souls with
good things; who in every duty may trust more to their Prayers, than their
Studies; to Gods grace, than their own gifts and industry. O (says he) that I
might in my days see the Church of Christ, set, and built on such Pillars! O
that I might see the pure Spouse of Christ, committed to the ear of such pure
and faithful Guardians! Nothing would make me so securely happy.

Thus, this devout and holy man in his times, to whose pious and earnest
desire, I could heartily say Amen, if I did but hope that ever the request
might be heard, and granted in my time; but, though all men be liers, yet we
have a true God to trust in.

As for that Liberty which some Christians plead, 16. Private Liberty of gifts
and public Ministry, not inconsistent.
(not upon a Socinian or fanatic account, as against any peculiar office, and
power Ministerial, but) only in a fair and orderly way of Christian charity,
and useful conversation; wherein private believers soberly and wisely
communicate of those gifts of knowledge they have attained; not to the
subversion of faith and peace in the Church or Consciences, but to the further
confirmation of them; This, as it is no way envied or denied by any good
Ministers, so far as God has granted it, or the charity and zeal of any modest
and humble Christian desires it; So there is no ground, either in Reason or
Religion to be urged against the peculiar Calling and Function of the Ministry,
from this Christian Liberty of Charity; any more, than there is cause to pull
down any man's dwelling house, because there are some sheds and pent-houses
leaning to it; which have their uses and conveniences in their kind, and
proportion, but not comparably to the main mansion; which has far more
strength, order, beauty, and usefulness: I shall afterward give a fuller
account of that Christian Liberty in Preaching and Prophesying, which is by
some arrogantly urged against the Authoritative Ministry, as any peculiar
office and appointment of Christ.

Only at present, I would endeavor to satisfy the sober and humble Christian,
That the Calling of the Ministry, which is and ought in all Religious Reason,
to be peculiar to some men, both in abilities and ordination, as well as in
exercise of a divine authority, and special power, this (I say) does no whit
quench or repress, but rather regulate and preserve that true Liberty, which
consists in private Christians conferring, admonishing, informing, and
strengthening, one another in every good word and work; without any neglect, or
undervaluing of the Public Ministry, where it may be had. To which, as
commonly all well-taught Christians ow (under God) the light, 1 These. 5.14.
Warn them that are ((...)) unruly, disorderly, out of their ranks and places,
where God has set them in his church. 2 These. 3.6. We command you Brethren in
the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw your selves from every
brother, who walks disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received
from us. Tit. 1.10, 11. There are many unruly and vain-talkers, etc. whose
mouths must be stopped.
and soundness they have in Religion, so they know, That all gifts are bounded
by the Word of God, which is the measure and touchstone of grace; that nothing
is further from grace, than unruly living, and disorderly walking; that the
gravity of Religion abhors all uncomly motions, and rude extravagancies; which
are as far from true piety or zeal, as mad-pranks and ravings are from being
heights or excesses of reason. Private presumptions (be men's abilities never so
great) may not proudly and uncharitably usurp against public order, peace, and
authority in the Civil State; much less against that divine polity, which
Christ has established in his holy Family, the Church.

Ministers not less necessary for the Church, than Commanders are for an Army.
(...). Clem. ep. ad Cor. p 46.
What wise Magistrate will allow it in a Subject? what discreet Commander (as
Clement writing to the Factious Corinthians observes) will countenance that
private and heady confidence in any Soldier, under pretense of valor, or hatred
of the enemy, or zeal for the Generals honor, and Armies good, without any
Order, Commission, or Command, to engage himself upon fighting the enemy, or
commanding any part of the Army; to the violating of those just and necessary
Rules of Discipline; in the exact observation whereof, the safety, strength,
and honor of an Army, infinitely more consists, than in the Thrasonick
forwardness, and fool-hardiness of any person in it, be he never so able or
willing? which, Manlius Torquatus expressed, Livius. Dec. 1. lib. 8.
Disciplinam militarem qua stetit ad hanc diem Romana res solvisti, etc. Triste
exemplum sed in posterum salubre, etc. 2 Timothy 2.5. If a man strive for mastery;
yet he is not crowned, except he strive lawfully. Secundum leges Athleticas.
(...), Refractarii. Disorderly Agitators. A Sect wh ch Clem. Alex. tells of,
(...). 3. 320.
by that severity of putting his own son to death, for fighting without order
from him his General, although he fought successfully: For wise men consider,
it is not so necessary to fight, or to preach, as to do both decently, and in
order; nor shall any man be commended or crowned for either, unless he do them
lawfully: Rashness is no part of any man's fortitude, much less of his Religion;
nor is confidence any sign of true valor; nor boasting of courage; neither is
confusion any ingredient in Christian charity; nor Faction any support of the
Faith; nor disorderly walking any fuel of those holy flames, which dwell in
the humble breasts of true Christians, and fill them with commendable zeal.

The Church of Christ is compared to a City that is at unity in it self, and to
an Army with Banners: Liberty must not expel Order out of the Church. Psalm. 122
3. Cont. 6.3. Rev. 21.19.
These holy allusions are so far argumentative, by way of right reason, and
religious proportions, as to assure us, That neither the strength nor beauty of
this holy City can be preserved, unless the comeliness, order, and exactness, of
those gemmeous foundations and walls, which Christ, and his holy Apostles have
laid, and set up in doctrine, holy institutions, and peculiar Ministry, be
observed and kept; which are not only guides and fences for the Churches
safety and direction; but also limits and boundaries to all men's extravagancy
in Religion: Nor yet can the majesty of this Heavenly Host, the Sacred Militia
of Christ's Church on Earth, continue, either, as to its safety in it self, or
its terror to its enemies round about, unless the Standard-bearers, the
Ministers, Chrysostom. in 1 Timothy hom. 5. (...). etc. Heb. 2.10. (...). Isai.
10.18. (...). Naz.
whose office is to hold up the Banner of Christ's Cross, against the wisdom,
power, and malice of men and devils, be supported and maintained; for these are
appointed by Christ, the Captain General of our Salvation, to be the directers
of the Churches motions; and as the centers of its peace, and order, in its
several bands and companies; which are the several Congregations: Who, without
Ministers, duly placed with authority among them, will soon be as sheep without
a shepherd; or, as soldiers, are when the standard bearer fails, easily
scattered and destroyed. And indeed, nothing seems more to reprove and confute,
the perverse disputings of some men against the settled order and calling of the
Ministry, (who pretend to Military Discipline and Orders) than this
consideration: For they cannot, but in reason be self-condemned; since, if they
have any grains of Salt in them, (...). Naz. Or. 26. (...). Inter Cyclopes. Non
tam spectandum quid agat quisque, quam quo ordine; nec tam quo animo, quam qua
disciplina. Ep. Wint. Andrews. Ordo postulat ut virtute eminentiores sint and
loco superiores, qui habeant rationum (...). Naz. Or. 1. V d. Clem. To. Epist.
ad Corinth. Numb. 11.17.
they cannot, but daily see, a necessity of exact order, and distinct power,
which must be observed among themselves as soldiers; without which, Armies will
be but heaps upon heaps; confused crowds and noises of men; if any one, who
fancies his own, or an others sufficiencies, shall presently usurp the power,
and intrude into the office of Captain and Commander; whose work is not only
to use a few good words now and than, but to fight valiantly, and yet to keep
both himself, and others in good order.

No less is order necessary to the Church in its Societies; over which able and
fit Ministers duly placed, have, not only the work of Preaching, lying on
their Consciences, which requires more than ordinary and vulgar abilities; but,
they have many other great, and weighty affairs, which they are to discharge,
both publicly and privately; as workmen that need not to be ashamed; as those,
that are meet instruments, and workers together with God and Christ, in the
great work of saving souls; to which, if only memory, and a voluble tongue,
and an oratorious confidence, would have served, there needed not so great
preparations, and power of the Spirit from on high, to come on the Apostles;
which not only furnished them with Matter what to say, and Languages wherein,
but, with just and full authority to preach Christ's Gospel in Christ's Name; and
to settle, a like constant Authority, Order, and Power Ministerial in all
Churches, for holy Administrations; putting upon their Successors, whom they
ordained in every place (as the spirit of Moses was put on the seventy Elders)
of that Spirit; that is, of that same power Ministerial, which they had
immediately from Christ. Nor was any one not rightly ordained, anciently
esteemed, as any Minister of the Church, nor any thing he did valid; nor were
any that adhered to such disorderly walkers and impostors, ever reckoned among
good Christians, or as sound Members in the Church; Cypr. Epist. 76. De
Baptisandis Novatianis, ad Magnum. Novatianus in Ecclesia non est, nec
Episcopus ^^mputari potest, qui Evangelica, and Apostolica autoritate
contempta, nemini succedens a se ipso ortus est. Habere enim aut tenere
Ecclesiam nullo modo potest, qui ordinatus in Ecclesia non est. Quomodo gregi
Christi annumerari potest, qui legitimum non sequitur pastorem? quomodo pastor
haberi debet, qui manente vero pastore, and in Ecclesia Dei ordinatione
succedanea praesidente, nemini succedens, a seipso incipiens alienus sit, and
dominicae pacis and divina veritatis inimicus.
As Saint Cyprian, most eloquently and zealously, writes concerning Novatianus,
who usurped the office of a Bishop and Pastor, among some credulous and weak
people; despising the Ordination of the Church. How can he be counted a Bishop
or Minister in the Church, who thus like a Mushroom grows up from himself? How
can he have any office in the Church, who is not placed there by the officers
in the Church; which has ever had in it true Pastors, who by a successive
Ordination, have received power to preside in the Church? He that sets up of
his own new score, and succeeds none formerly ordained, is both an alien to,
and an enemy of the peace and truth divine: Nor can that sheep be reckoned, as
one of Christ's flock, who does not follow a lawfully ordained Pastor. Thus
Saint Cyprian, a Learned holy Bishop, and after a Martyr for Christ, testifies
the sense of the Church, and all true Christians in his time, who flourished in
the third Century after Christ.

I will only add one place more out of Tertullian, Tertul. lib. de Praescrip.
adv. Haereses. Edant (Haeretici) origines Ecclesiarum suarum, evolvant ordinem
Episcoporum suorum, ita per successiones ab initio decurrentium, ut primus ille

etc. Traditionem itaque Apostolorum in toto mundo manifestatam in Ecclesia

who lived before Saint Cyprian, in the end of the second Century, whom Cyprian
usually called his Master, for the learning, warmth, force, and eloquence,
which were in his works, till his defection. Let these new Masters (says he)
and their Disciplies, set forth to us the Original of their Churches, the
Catalogue and Succession of their Bishops and Ministers; so running upward
without interruption; that it may appear their first Bishop or Presbyter had
some Apostle, or some that persevered with the Apostle, for their predecessor
and ordainer: For thus the true and Apostolically planted Churches do ever make
their reckonings; as the Church of Smyrna had their first Bishop (Polycarpus)
placed among them by St. John the Apostle: So the Church of Rome and Antioch
had their Pastors, or Bishops, settled by the Apostle Peter. Thus Tertullian,
and with him Irenaeus, and all the ancients; who sought to keep the unity of
the Spirit, and the bond of peace, Ephesians. 4.3. The purity of doctrine, and power
of holy Discipline, in the Church of Christ. These holy men never dreamed of
Self-ordainers, or of gifted, yet unordained Ministers; nor did they own any
Christians in Church Society, or Ecclesiastic Order, and holy Communion, where
there was not an evident, distinct, and personally demonstrable Succession of
Bishops, Pastors, and Teachers, in Ministerial Authority, so constituted by
holy Ordination, lineally descended, and rightly derived from the Apostolical
Stem, and the Root, Jesus Christ.

Nor is this, so divine an Institution, so solemn an Ordination, 17. Peculiar
Officers as Ministers, most necessary for the common peoples good, as to
Religion.
so sacred a Mission, and so clear and constant a Succession of Ministers,
(whose office it is to bear witness of the Name of Christ, in his love, and
sufferings, and merits, to the end of the World, till the number of Saints be
perfected, till the work of the Ministry is finished, and the Body of Christ,
his Church, fully edified, Ephesians. 4.12.) This, I say, is not of more concernment
to the glory of God, (whose infinite and inestimable mercy is hereby set forth
to mankind,) or more conducing to the honor of Christ, in his wisdom, love,
and care, for his Church, than it is every way most necessary for the common
good of those, whom the Lord is pleased to call to be his people, at any time,
in any Nation, 1 Cor. 1.21.
whatsoever; whose interest and benefit the Lord Jesus Christ far more
considered (and so should all good Ministers do in their work,) than any
particular ends, or advantages of their own; (Alas, the divinest advancement of
true Ministers in this World, is their faithful labor; their honor must be
their cares, and studies, and fears; 2 Cor. 1.23, etc. Princeps in praedicando
princeps in perpetiendo. Bern.
their crowns, their sufferings and sorrows, persecutions, and perils,
contempts, crosses, and deaths for Christ's sake, and the Churches welfare:) But
the peculiar benefit and advantage of the Christian flock, the faithful people
of all sorts, is that which is most to be regarded; over whom the Lord has
made Ministers overseers; (not only at the first plantation of the Gospel, as
the Socinians say, but also in a constant and clear succession of Public
Ministerial Authority;) for this very purpose, That poor people may never be
left as sheep without a shepherd; Mark 6.24.
that they may not either wander up and down in the wildernesses, or mountains
of their own fancies; or be led away by others seductions; or be beguiled by
the devils wiles, and temptations; That they may hear, and believe, and
persevere steadfast in the Faith; that they may neither be ignorant, nor
erroneous, nor scattered and divided; that they may be preserved from rustical
simplicity, hypocritical formality, heretical pravity, and schismatical novelty
in matters of Religion; (...) Prove. 29.18. (...) signifies, Perire, denudare,

that they may not perish (or be left naked, separated, scattered, idle, and
rebellious) for want of vision; thereby sinning against God, and their own
souls. The pregnant significancy of that one word, which Solomon's wisdom uses,
has these swarms or spawnings of several senses: All which variety shows, That
the state of common people is never more desperate, than when their Seers fail;
when their Teachers are removed into corners; when God sends them no Preachers,
or Prophets after his own heart; when people are not only without light, but
put it out, quenching the Lamps of the Sanctuary, and loving darkness more than
light; when they are given up to their own delusions, and others seductions;
who blindly follow the visions of their own hearts, and the Prophets of their
own sending, or the Ministers of their own ordaining; whom they shall have no
cause to credit, esteem, love, or obey, as finding no competent gifts
Ministerial in them, no Characters of divine Authority, or holy Succession,
upon them.

Ezekiel. 3.17. Heb. 13.17. They watch for their souls, etc.
People will easily be surprised when they have no watchmen to foresee, give
warning, prevent, and encounter any dangers, of sins, errors, and temptations,
which easily surprise the generality even of Christians; who are for the most
part so busied, and encumbered, or so pleased and ensnared, or so burdened and
oppressed with the secular and sensible things of this world, that they can
hardly watch one hour with Christ, no not in his agony; if they had not some
Ministers divinely appointed, to put them in remembrance; to stir up their
affections, to provoke them to piety, to prepare them for eternity, both
instructing them in the Faith, and praying for them that their Faith may not
fail. Nothing indeed is more deplorable and desperate, than the condition of
mankind, yea, and of any part of the Church of Christ would be, if the Lord
had not commanded, and by a special providence continued an holy constant
succession of the Ministers of the Word and Sacraments; who may be always,
either planting, or watering, or pruning; and so, according to the several
proportions of Christians, still preserving the truth, life, and power of
Religion, so as it may descend to after ages. For there is no doubt, 1 Cor.
1.21. It pleased God by the foolishness of Preaching, to save them that believe.
but without this holy and happy Succession of Ministers, either people would
ever persist in their original ignorance, and heathenish sottery; or, although
once planted with piety, yet they will soon relapse to barbarity, Atheism, and
unbelief; or at best, content themselves with idle formalities, spiritless
superstitions, empty notions, moldy traditions, lying legends, plausible
fancies, novel inventions, vain imaginations, or most desperate errors, and
damnable doctrines; which is evident by the experience, as of former, so of
these times; where few of those, that have cast off, and despised the lawful,
and true Ministry of this Church, but either give over all Religion; or else
think themselves capable, every night to dream a new and better way of serving
God, and saving men's souls, than ever yet was used.

This natural tendency to Apostatize from truth, 18. As all Christians subject
to Errors and Apostacies, so none more than here in England. Anglorum ingenia
sunt aut varia and mobilia, superstitionibus and vaticiniis dedita; aut feroci
quadam pertinacia aspera and contumaciter superba. Bodin. and Lansius. and
Phil. Com.
to relapse to profaneness, to rest in hypocrisy, to run out to
extravagancies, or to persist in errors, no people under Heaven are more
subject to, than those of this Nation, England; whom, as God has blessed with a
land flowing with milk and honey; so they have much of the iron sinew, and
stiffneckedness of the Jews; for being full fed, they are also full of high and
quick spirits, various and vehement fancies, finding out and running after many
fashions and inventions. Don Gundamor, who had much studied the English temper,
and knew how their pulse beat, both in Church and State, was wont to say, He
despaired not of those violent changes here in England; which in no other
Nation could be expected; who are generally content with their customs, and
constant to their principles; whereas the English are always given to change,
to admire novelties, and with most inconsiderate violence to pursue them: So
that no Nation or Church under Heaven, have more need then, of constant,
learned, able, and honest Ministers; who may show them, guide, and keep them in
the good, right, and safe way of true Religion; From which, none are more
easily seduced, than those that have either a sequacious softness, and
credulity toward other men, as diverse of us have; or an high conceit and
confidence of themselves; which people, much at ease, rich and high fed, (as
many in England) are most subject to; Insomuch, that we see the greatest
dis^ase, as to Religion, now is, among us, not so much a famine, as a surfeit of
the Word; and knowledge, which has here been as the waters of the Sea, Hab.
2.14.
disdains those shores of order, office, and duty, which the Lord has set for
its bars and bounds in his Church: Christians in many places, having had great
fullness, are come to great wantonness; and the enemies of the Ministry, The
greatest enemies of Ministers make them most necessary.
and Reformed Religion in this Church, are not such, as have been kept meager,
and tame with emptiness, and ignorance; but such as have been pricked with
provender, high fed, by an able and constant Ministry. These are grown to such
ferocious spirits, like pampered horses, whom no ground will hold; daily
neighing after novelties; rushing upon any adventures; and impatient to bear
those Ministers any longer, by whose bounty they have been so liberally
nourished, with all means of knowledge, preaching, conferring, and writing;
These now affect high racks, and empty mangers; subtilties rather than
solidities, and novelties more than nourishment; yea, they are become the
rivals of their Ministers, and und rtake like Balaams Beast to teach their
Masters; not only speaking with them, but against them; yea, seeking to cast
them quite off, lifting up their heel against them, and trampling their feeders
under their feet: Thus having either got the brid^e between their teeth, or
having cast quite off their neck the reigns of Order, Government, and
Discipline in Religion, Psalm. 32.9.
they are become like Horse and Mule without understanding; without gratitude,
civility, and common humanity; so far they are from sober piety: Running
furiously without their guides, wantonly snuffing up the wind, and proudly
lifting up themselves in their high crested opinions and presumptuous fancies
of notions, gifts, prophecyings, and inspirations; Glorying in this riotous
liberty and mad frolicks of Religion; which all wise, humble, and holy
Christians know, are not more unworthy of, and uncomfortable to, all good
Ministers (who taught them better) than they will be most dangerous,
destructive, and damnable to those men themselves, who proudly affect those
ruder and dangerous follies in the Church of Christ; who cannot (either they,
or their posterity) be ever so safe, as in Christ's way, at his finding, and
under his custody; where, with holy and just restraints (becoming Reason,
Order, and Religion) there are also the most ingenuous liberties, and the most
liberal fruitions: Wandering prodigals in Religion, who forsake the order and
regularity of their Fathers house, which is full of bread, will soon be reduced
to a morsel of bread.

And we see already, such as have in their pride and disdain most forsaken the
true Ministry, are come by their riotous courses, to feed on husks; and from
the harlotry of their wanton, and fine opinions, to consort with swine; having
hired out, Luke 15.
and enslaved themselves to all rude, unjust, and profane designs, or else
wallowing in filthy and sensual lusts, which makes them sin against Heaven and
Earth, and be no more worthy to be called the sons of God, or the children of
this Christian Reformed Church. So that we evidently see, That those men fight
against God, against Christ Jesus, against the Reformed and Christian Religion;
against the Word of God, which is the standard of Religion; against the Unity,
Order, and Cathol ke conformity of the Church of the Christ in all ages;
against the future Succession of Religion; against their own souls; against
their posterity; against the common good of all mankind; and all such, as may
want and enjoy the inestimable blessing of the Gospel, who ever fight against
the holy office, divine authority, necessary duty, sacred dignity, and constant
succession, of the Evangelical Ministers, and Ministry; without which the
Church of Christ, like a Field or Garden, without di^igent and daily Husbandmen
and Gardiners, would, long ago, have run to waste; and been overrun with all
manner of evil w^^d, (which grow apace, even in the best Plantations;) if God in
his wisdom and mercy to mankind, and to his Church, had not appointed some
men, as his Ministers, to take care from time to time, that the field of the
Church be tilled in every place; that the Garden be weeded, and the vineyard
fenced; and this especially for their sakes, who are the ((...)) most of men;
whose cares and burdens of life, or whose dullness and incapacity, or whose
wants and weakness, or whose lusts and passions, would never, either move them
to, or continue them in any way, worthy the name of true Religion, if God had
not sent and ordained ((...)) Cryers, 1 Timothy 2.7. Praecones, vel Caduceatores.
Heralds, and Ambassadors, to summon, invite, and by pious importunity, even
compel men to come into the ways of true piety, and happiness; which, being not
only far above sinful flesh and blood, but quite contrary to them, had need
have a Ministry, whose authority, for its rise, assistance, and succession,
should be beyond what is of humane original and derivation; which who so seek
to oppose, destroy, or alter, will certainly bring upon themselves, not only
the guilt of so high an insolence against Christ, and injury against this
Church; but also, will stand accountable to Gods justice, for those many souls
damnation, whom their vanity and novelty have perverted and destroyed, both in
the present age and after generations, for want of true Ministers.

These first weapons then, which the Adversaries of the peculiar Calling of the
Ministry, hoped to find in the Armony of Scripture, or Right Reason, whereby
to defend their own intrusion, and to offend that holy Function, and divinely
instituted Succession, are found (I think) to have, as little force in them to
hurt the Ministry, or to help the enemy, 1 Samuel 17.
as Goliahs Shield, Helmet, Sword, and Spear had, either to injure David, or
secure himself; yea, (we see) those smooth stones, those pregnant and piercing
Authorities of many clear and concurrent Texts of Scripture, both for precept
and example, which I have produced, according to right reasoning, from Jesus
Christ, and the blessed Apostles; To which, the Cathol^ke practice, and custom
of all Churches in after times, is as a sling directing them, more forcibly and
firmly against the brazen foreheads of those Anakims, that oppose the Ministry;
All these together, are sufficient to prostrate to the ground their proud
height, and to put to flight that uncircumcised party, who have defied, and
seek to destroy, the ho^y Ordination of Evangelical Ministers; whose poor and
oppressed estate, although it may now seem, but as little David, with his Scrip
and Staff, in the eyes of self-exalting adversaries, who despise and curse them
in their hearts; yet these may find them to come in the Name and Power of the
Lord; sent by Gods mission, furnished with Christ's commission, and appointed by
the Churches due Ordination, to be Leaders, Rulers, and chief Officers in the
Church Militant, under His Excellency the Lord Jesus Christ; Heb. 2.10. (...).
who is the Generalissimo, chief Captain, and Prince of our Salvation; who
having in former times delivered his Servants, the true and faithful Ministers,
from the paws of the Lions and the Bears, (Heathenish force, and Heretical
furies) will also deliver them out of the hands of these uncircumcised
Philistims; who, having received from their Ministry, what ever honor and
privilege, they can pretend to as Christians, yet now carry themselves, as if
they were aliens from the Israel of God; and had never had relation to, or
blessing from, this or any other true Church; where has been a constant
Ministry, not more famous for Learning and Industry, than blessed with all
Evangelical excellencies, and happy successes: To which now, the Lord is
pleased to add this crown of patience, under great tribulations, and of
perseverance in suffering much evil disc^uragement, where it has deserved so
well.

CAVIL III. Or Objection about Christian gifts, and exercising in common as
Preachers or Prophets.
ALl impartial spectators may hitherto behold the salvation of God; how the
insolent opposers of the Ministerial function, the men of Gath, are in their
first encounter so deeply smitten and woun ed, that they ly grovelling on the
ground: The remaining motions which they may seem to have, Inconditi morientium
motus and invalidi expirantium conatus. Sym.
are but the inordinate strokes of hands and heels, the last batteries, and
weak struglings, which attend impotent revenge and exspiring malice; It will be
no hard matter, to set my foot upon their prost^ate power; and to sever their
Heads from their Shoulders (that they rise up no more) by the means of that two
edged and unparalleld Sword of the Scriptures, rightly applied; which has both
sharpness, weight, and brightness; the clearest reason, potentest conviction,
and divinest Authority; with which they thought to arm themselves against the
peculiar Office of the Ministry.

Yet there are some seconds and recruits (who seem to have less fury and malice
against the Ministry) who seeing the chief Champion of the Antiministeriall
faction, thus Levelled, come in, either as to the spoil, or rescue, (as Ajax to
Ulysses) holding before them the shield of manifold Scriptures; Alleging, That
notwithstanding there may be granted some peculiar Office and Institution of
the public Ministry; yet, as to the power of preaching, or liberty of
prophesying, the promise is common to all believers, Jo^l. 2.28. cited Acts
2.17.
for the pouring out of the spirit upon all flesh, in the later days: for the
Anointing from above, which shall lead every believer into all Truth; so that
they shall not need any man should teach them: 1 John 2.27. Romans 12.6. 1 Cor.
14.1. 1 These. 5.19.20. 1 Cor. 12.7.39. Acts 18.26.
being all taught of God. That the manifestation and gifts of the spirit are
given to every one for the good of the Church; in teaching, exhorting,
prophesying, etc. Which every one is to covet, and may communicate to others,
for their conversion, or confirmation; as Aquila and Priscilla did to Apollos,
and other Christians in Primitive dispersions; exercising and employing their
talents received, if not as Ministers in Office, and ordained, yet as Prophets
and gifted Brethren; if not as Pastors, yet as Teachers; 1 Per. 4.11.
In like sort Christians, now, find their gifts of knowledge and utterance to
great and good, that they cannot smother them, nor suffer them to be restrained
and oppressed by the Ministers encroachment and Monopoly. Thus they, who would
seem to be somewhat more civil and equanimous to the calling and Office of the
Ministry.

Answ. 1. Gifts in others no prejudice to the Office of the Ministry; nor
warrant to any man public arrogance.
My Answer first in general is: That all these and the like small shot, which

Nicolaides, and others of the revived Arians have afforded these Semiant
iministeriall adversaries, have been often discharged, and received, without any
hurt, as to the divinely established Office of the Ministry; Having been either
satisfied with all ingenuous concessions, as far as order, modesty, and charity
will carry them; or refuted with just replies, against all vanity, arrogance
and confusion, by those learned men, who formerly or lately have given very
sober, solid, and liberal satisfaction to any pleas urged, or scruples alleged
out of Scripture; which will in no sort maintain idleness, vanity, pride, and
confusion in the Church; under the specious names of liberty, gifts and
prophesying; There are indeed many places exciting Christians to labor, to
abound in every good gift and work; but yet as many to keep them within due
order and holy bounds, becoming the honor of Religion.

All those ((...)) gifts were never more eminent and common in the Church of
Christ, than in those times, when the Ministerial power was by peculiar marks,
ceremonies, and duties, distinctly and undoubtedly conferred on some peculiar
persons; as, the Apostles, and 70. Disciples; on Timothy, Titus, and others,
who were separated, and ordained, by fasting, praying, examination and
imposition of hands, to be Bishops or Presbyters in the respective Churches, as
they came to be capable of settled order and Ministry. And notwithstanding the
extraordinary gifts of the Spirit, which were then conferred upon many, not yet
ordained Ministers, we see, the Office and honor of the Ministry was never
more clearly asserted, as divine (being set over the flocks by the Lord) so to
be owned and esteemed, as distinct from secular intanglements, as an retire and
complete employment, even for the best and ablest men, to which they should
once ordained wholly give themselves, and attend on it. Never was order, and
peace, and proportion in the Church more enjoined, and duly observed; never
were disorderly and unruly walkers, false Apostles, self-obtruders,
house-creepers, heaps of teachers, who caused divisions, more severely
repressed, than in those Primitive times, when believers enjoyed most eminent
gifts and graces for some ends: either in miracles, or toungs, or prophesying,
(which was not that eminentest sense of prophesying (that is, foretelling
things to come;) but the opening and applying the places of the Prophets, in
the old Testament (which was then the only Scriptures the Church had; which St.
Peter calls the more sure word of Prophecy) by which it might appear to the
Church more clearly, that the crucified Jesus was the Christ, the promised,
prefigured, and prophesied Messiah; so establishing the tradition and history
of the new Testament (which concerned the Nativity, life, miracles, sufferings,
death, resurrection, ascension, etc. of Christ,) by the places of the old;
wherein often times an Auditor among them might have that further light revealed
to him, as to the fuller sense of any place, which another was handling; and
this, but occasionally, not as a constant habit; only at present, it was beyond
his natural abilities, or endowments acquired by studies, etc. Nor was this
(then an extraordinary gift, for the confirming and establishing of the new
planted Church, or Christians in the faith) ever used, as it ought, but with
great order, all gravity, charity, humility and peace among those, that were
truly so enabled: And when any vain pretenders came up to abuse it; the Apostle
requires, that there be a due trial, and subjection of these spirits of the
Prophets to the Prophets, who might wisely discern between true and false,
between holy, wise, and excellent inspirations, (which were pertinent
interpretations, or apt clearings of Scriptures,) and those weak, impudent, and
impertinent ostentations, which were either very false and foolish, or vulgar
and ordinary.

Which, Secondly, is the most, 2. Of right interpreting and applying
Scriptures. 2 Cor. 2.17.
that our Antiministeriall adversaries, who affect the name of Prophets,
commonly amount too; while they handle the Scriptures (most what) with very
unwashen hands; so brokenly, corruptly, rudely, rashly and perversely, as makes
them not any way extraordinary Prophets, but ordinary proclamers of their own
ignorance, shame, and impudence: who think they may take liberty in nothing
more, than in abusing and wresting the holy Scriptures, which are sufficient to
make any man of God perfect, both in gifts and graces, in abilities and in
humility: And which should not be handled either privately, or publicly, but
with great humility, care, diligence, exactness and conscience; Since, 2 Pet.
1.20. 2 Pet. 3.16.
as they were not of private and humane invention, so nor are they of private
interpretation, after every man's sudden, unstable, and unlearned fancy; Who
rashly singles out texts of Scripture here and there (as they do a Deer out of
a Herd,) and runs them down, till they fall at the foot of his fancy or
opinion; torturing and racking the places till they speak to his mind, and
sense: Thus often times the Church of Christ has seen men of proud and corrupt
minds (as they say Toads of good Eggs hatch Cockatrices) from some places of
Scripture ravished from their fellows, Omnia adversus veritatem de ipsa
veritate constructa sunt: operantibus aemulationem istam spiritibus erroris.
Tertul. Apol. c. 47. Dominici eloquii fures and violatores. Aust De Donatistis
Retract. l. 21. Falsa interpretatio Scripturae est nervus Satanici regni. Hilar.
and wrested from the main scope and context, bring forth most heretical and
monstrous productions; contrary to those truths, which are most clearly set
forth in the whole tenor or Analogy of the Scriptures, as their great design
and main intent: Such those of old were, against the divinity and humanity of
Christ; Against the holy Trinity; Against the grace of God; and of late against
the Law, the Souls Immortality, good works, both the Sacraments, all holy
duties as forms; Against any resurrection and judgment to come, against the
very being of any Catholic Church, against the Scriptures themselves; And so
now against any Succession or peculiar order of ordained authoritative
Ministers, to hold forth the Gospel of Christ, and true Religion to the world:
So the Maniches from Ephesians. 2.2. By nature you are the Children of wrath, argued
Nature of man to be Evil, And from a principle of darkness and sin, coeternall
with the good God. Aust. Retract. l. 15. Apollinaris and Eutiches argued from
the word was made flesh, That Christ had not two distinct natures, but only
one, the flesh turned into God. So Arrius against the Divinity, Nestorius
against the Unity of the person of Christ. The Anthropomorphites urged
Scripture for those humane shapes, which they grossly imagined to be in God, as
in Man; because God speaking to man, speaks as man, not as he is in himself,
but as he is most conceivable by us. In none of all which errors, those Patrons
of them, any more than these (for liberty of opining and of prophesying as they
list) will seem to want either reason or Scripture; which sometime they will
call a dead letter; yea and killing too; Affirming that both it and the
Ministry too are needless; that all are taught of God, by a quickening Spirit
and a Special unction, etc.

The same men can prophesy too if you let them alone, against all civil
property and common equity and honesty, 1 Cor. 3.22.23. 2 Cor. 4.15. Romans 13.8.
Joh. 6.27.
out of that place, All things are yours, and you are Christ's, and Christ is
Gods; Against borrowing, or at least paying any pecuniary debts; by Ow no man
any thing, but love; Against all honest labor and diligence, by Labor not for
the meat that perishes, Take no thought for to morrow; Mat. 6.25. 1 Pet. 3.3.
Tit. 1.15. Mat. 23.9.
Against all modesty and decency in clothes, by that, not of putting on of
apparel; Against all restraints of Laws and bounds of holiness in any thing,
by that, to the pure all things are pure; All things are lawful for me, 1 Cor.
6.12. Against all duty to Parents, subjection to Masters and Magistrates, 1
Pet. 2.9.
by call no man Father, or Lord (...) be not ye the servants of men, 1 Cor.
7.23. by being Gods freemen; for, you are a royal Priesthood, ergo, no
peculiar Ministry; whereas that was said, to the Jews first, who had a peculiar
Priesthood, by which the whole Nation was blessed and honored of God. Exodus
19.5.
Thus the devil, and his seducing instruments, never want their lectures,
quotations, and common place^, out of the Scriptures; When pride, poverty and
liberty, once meet together to prophecy as they list, what mad work do they
make, with Scriptures, Religion, conscience, and all order and Laws of Church
or civil societies? As those false Prophets in Germany, not long ago did, and
others after in England designed to have done, Munter and Phifer. Hacket and
Arthington.
making the holy Scripture, which is the pure fountain of life, the very sink
and receptacle of all heady opinions and sordid practices.

When as the Holy Scriptures, Purissimum veritatis sontem in puridissimam
errorum sentinam vertunt haeretici. Jeron. S. Scripturae locis multi abutuntur,

which are the oracles of God and hold forth his mind to the world in matters
of Religion, are to be understood and interpreted (not by minds leavened with
heretical pride, or Schismatic peevishness, or captious and critical
moroseness, or Scepticall cavilings and janglings (which commonly drive some
other secular and sinister end, rather than any thing of true faith, good
manners, and an holy life:) but, with all pious and cautious consideration, all
humble diligence, and ingenuous candor; Which first regards, the joint Analogy,
the concurrent tenor, and that clear proportion, or rule of faith and holy
life, in doctrine, both ^^r mysteries, and moralities, which are evidently
shining from many places, that are Indisputable; either for the clear
Instructions in morals; or Institution in mysteries; or Imitation in
Illustrious and commended examples for order and policy: All which are enough
^^ make a man of God, and any Church of Christ, perfect to salvation.

And such light, from the clear propotion, and concurrent harmony, or constant
tenor of Scriptures old and new has this point of the peculiar function of
the Ministry Evangelicall; both from the practice and precept of Christ, and
his Apostles, and others after them; to which the use and judgment of all
Churches do fully attest: In that trial, approbation, benediction, imposition
of hands, Ordination and solemn mission of some men in the Church to the Off^ce
and work of the Ministry, which is set forth in the New Testament: Against all
which, so full clear proofs, and so constant a light, what ever can be urged,
by single texts, or solitary and occasional examples, out of Scripture, Nolunt
agnoscere ea loca S. S. per qua revincuntur: hic nituntur quae ex falso
composuerunt, and quae de ambiguitate ceperunt. Tertul. de praes. 2 Pet. 2.16.

must needs be by these objecters either weakly, or wilfully mistaken in the
phrase and manner of speaking; or else is wrested as St Peter tells us by
ignorant and unstable minds from the scope and design of the Spirit of God in
that place, (which is the measure of all right Interpretation:) Or else it only
relates to something done by the rule of occasional prudence; or speaks of
some practice, which was only temporary not binding; or miraculous, and
extraordinary; which cease, when the gift and occasion cease; or it may be in
some cases of urgent necessity, which might befall an Infant, planting,
incomplete, inorganicall Church; either not fully formed and settled in the due
order, or suddenly pressed and scattered with vehement persecution, and so
forced from that order and exactness in outward Ministrations of the Church,
which regard a sociall, ut cresceret pl^bs and multiplicaretur, omnibus inter

public, and common, more, than a solitary, and private profession of
Religion, and which, in the Churches settled condition, they otherways duly and
conscientiously observed, as the will of God. All which extraordinary cases
are, in all wise men's judgment, very far different and distant from that of
this Church of England, unless it may seem under some persecution, by
slanderous toungs, by false Brethren, and deceitful workers, and disorderly
walkers, the troublers of our Israel; whom the Apostle Paul's charity to this
reformed Church, would (no doubt) have wished, that either their mouths might
be stopped, or they might be cut off, and delivered with Hymenaeus, Philetus,
and Alexander the Copper-Smith, to Satan, that they might learn not to
blaspheme the Scriptures, and the true Ministry, and this true Church, and in
all these, the Gospe^l and name, with the Spirit and grace of Christ, all which
have been manifested among us by the Ministers of this Church.

3. Those and the like places answered in general. The no validity of such
captious disputings by Scripture, against Scripture.
Truly I do not think that the so often repeaters of their Socinian Crambes, The
objectors of those and the like single places, or those temporary and
occasional practices in Scripture, by which men or women unordeined to be
Ministers, did privately teach, or publicly prophesy, can be so weak and silly
(many of them (for some of them are men only in malice, against the Ministers,
but children in understanding;) as to believe, That there is any such weight or
force in any of those objections, which their own reason and conscience (if not
blinded with passion and prejudice against the Office of the Ministry,) will
not tell them have very easy, fair and full solutions; Either first from the
extraordinariness of the gifts, which were but temporary, and to which these
men can with no face pretend, by any thing yet discovered by them, Adulteria
Scripturarum and ^^positionum mendacia. Tertul.
(Their zeal to disgrace and destroy the Ministry, by perverting and wresting
the Scriptures, is no sign of their Apostolical gifts, but of their Satanicall
or Schismatic malice;) Or secondly they are answered from the case of the
Church in some places newly planted, or persecuted and scattered; Or thirdly,
by the common exercises of private Charity among believers one to another;
which all good Christians and Ministers allow still, and rejoice in the order,
us^fulness and mod^sty of those charitable gifts, and Brotherly exercises,
which may ^n their proper place (being duly regulated) as well consist with the
divine authority and peculiar eminency of the Ministerial function, as the
Moon and Stars may be in the same firmament with the Sun; Although shining in a
different time and orb, with different luster, and to far less degrees of
influence, yet to the same common end, the good of this inferior world.

So that no wise and gracious Christian in reason can, or in conscience ought
to sheath those or other Scriptures in Ministers bowels, which are rather for
their defense and assistance, Showing indeed the great use of a constant
peculiar Ministry, to prevent the Churches desolations and such neccessities of
meaner supplies: So far are they, from affording any ground, either wholly to
give a bill of divorce to the settled Ministry (which by so many clear and
pregnant texts is plain to be d^vinely Instituted;) or to encourage any
Christians to entertain those proud and spiteful Peninnahs of pretenders to be
gifted men; thereby to grieve and vex the Souls of the true and faithful
Ministers (as she did Hannahs devout meekness, 1 Samuel 1.
with her malipert insolency) It is no argument to persuade the Church
therefore to cast out of Christ's family the Stewards and dispensers of holy
mysteries, which he has appointed, because Christians have sometime in their
enforced wanderings, Multum differunt lex necessitatis and ordinis: quod ita
fieri debet, and quod aliter fieri non potest. Reg. Iu.
been relieved by some strangers, or private and mutual Charity; which may in
such cases be great, though their gifts and provision be but moderate. However
it were madness for Christians now where no necessity or disorder presses, and
when neither gifts are so good, nor Charity so great in any of these new men,
to venture themselves upon their powers for supplies; who (like the foolish
Virgins) have too little for themselves, however they boast of their full Lamps
and Oil to spare.

Such small and feeble oppositions then, Lib. de praesc. adv. Haere: Proprium
hoc est haereticorum ex pancioribus Scriptura locis plura intelligi velle.
Tert. ad Praxeam.
which (as Tertullian tells us) either Heretics or Schismatics are wont to
bring from broken and abused Scriptures, for their novell opinions, their proud
and pragmatick confusions, against the ancient and Catholic sense, which the
Church has always held forth by its practice, agreeable to the many clear and
unquestionable places, do no more weaken the divine authority of those things
which the Catholic Church upon lively grounds observes (as it always has
this of a constant ordained Ministry) no more I say, than if Dalilah should
have plucked two or three of Sampsons hairs, Judges 16.
instead of cutting off his goodly locks and prodigious tresses. Nor may these
false and flattering Dalilahs of our times, (who by cauponating Religion and
handling the Scriptures deceitfully, 2 Cor. 2.17.
seek to betray the strength, honor, and order of this reformed Church in
England, under pretenses of great kindness) think, that by twitching thus one
or two hairs, the Ministers strength will fail them; or that the
Anti-ministeriall Philistines shall presently be upon them, so as easily to
prevail against the whole function of the settled Ministry; which being divinely
instituted, and derived, will ever be divinely assisted: No, Mat. 28.20.
we find yet, (through the might of Gods grace, and the testimony of good
consciences,) so great a strength and holy courage, in all true and faithful
Ministers, as is abundantly able to assert themselves, their function, and the
reformed Religion of this Church of England, against all these Apollyons and
Abaddons; We are not so dispirited, nor distressed, but that we can still rowse
up our selfs in the strength of God, and in the Spirit of Jesus Christ, and in
the authority of our holy function; so, as easily to break in-sunder all such
withs and cords, by which the enemies, not so much of our persons, as of our
calling and Religion, hope to afflict us; so that these uncircumcised in hearts
and lips, shall not safely touch us, or mock us. Judges 15.17.
Only, as Sampson did of the men of Judah, we humbly crave of the secular
powers, which are now over us, that their hands may not be against us, to fall
upon us themselves, however they expose us, thus to contend with those men of
Ashd^d alone: Ps. 118.12. Et multitudine inimicorum and magnitudine pressus:
and viribus and numero valentium. Ps. 22.12. Ps. 68.30.
Who came about us first like Bees with their importune stings, their vexatious
disputings; But now they threaten to come upon us like fat Bulls of Basan on
every side, with their horns lifted up on high to destroy us; But the Lord will
be on our side, so that we shall not need greatly to fear what these beasts of
the people (these unreasonable men) can do unto us; Who will soon be
extinguished, as fire among the thorns, when once the Lord shall arise to plead
his own cause, not only by the zeal, and patience, and constancy of his
servants the true Ministers; but also, by stirring up the spirit of wisdom in
the hearts of all true Christians; who will soon be ashamed of that levity,
contempt and confusion, which these men's vanity, or impiety, and hypocrisy,
would fain bring upon them, and their posterity, in this great concernment of
the set^ed Ministry, and the true reformed Religion.

The evil designs of such captious disputers against the Ministry. 1 Samuel 5.
There are (no doubt) who of a long time have endeavored and sought
opportunity, when they might bring with Carts and high shoos, by the illiterate
rudeness of the seduced vulgar, the Ark of our Reformed Church and Re igion,
into the house of their mish^pen Dagon, which has upper parts like a man's, but
the lower as a Fish, the head adorned with Christian Religion, but the tail
deformed with superstition. They softly and fairly pretend liberty and
improvement, with men's faces and women's hair (as the Locusts which rose out of
the bottomless pit) but they will end in the Scorpious tail of licentiousness,
Rev. 9.7.
superstition, and profaness; Such Reformation will soon prove deformity. They
speak of bread, but it will prove stones, Mat. 7.10.
and Serpents instead of Fishes. Such manifestations of private gifts in wanton
and presumptuous Spirits, will soon turn to the quenching and resisting of the
true light and heat of Gods Spirit, whose purer flames are only fed with that
holy Oil which flows from the golden vessel of the Scriptures, Zach. 4 12.
divinely infused into them, and diffused into the humble hearts of all good
Christians by those pipes of the Ministry, which Christ has appointed for that
service: This Anti-ministeriall Liberty, which some seek thus to dress up, by
an adulterous and wanton bravery, against the calling of the Ministry, is like
the woman which sits in the midst of the Ephah of wickedness; Zach. 5.7.
upon the mouth of which God will (ere long) cast such a talent of lead, as
shall cover and stop it up, by the just indignation and abhorrence of all good
Christians, to see themselves, this Church, the Ministers of it, and the
Reformed Religion so much wasted and abused, by such prodigies of profaness as
some of them are: who speak nothing, but proud, and perverse things; full of
bold blasphemies, and Anti christian confusions; under the color of gifts and
Liberties of prophesying; whereto as the wisdom and holy order set forth in
Scripture give me countenance; so, in the next place, neither do these men's
gifts, which they so boast and vapor of give any encouragement.

For first no wise man doubts of those men's emptiness, which their great noise
and sounding sets forth every where: 4. The vanity and emptiness of these
Anti-Ministerials as to their pretended gifts. Vasa, quo ina^iora eo
sonuntiora. Vulgus hominum, quae non in^elligunt impensius nio antur. Jeron.
Males amorum Christianorum ut phreneticorum hominum and delirantium illud

showing they are very full of themselves; puffed up with their own leven;
applauded also by some others, and blown up by people of their own size; who
are as prone to flatter confident talkers, and undertakers, as Children are to
fill empty bladders with wind; Pint-pots wi l cry up one another capacity and
fullness, till they are set near or compared and emptyed into quart or gallon
vessels; 'Twill then appear, though they were soon full and ran over, yet they
held but little, and are soon exhausted. These Behemetick Preachers,
Spagyrick-Illuminates, Familistick Prophets, and Seraphick Teachers, who
pretend to such strange Prerogatives of gifts, and new Lights, above all other
Christians, yea and beyond the ablest Ministers; like frantic men always
bosting of their riches, strength, treasure, beauty, etc. amidst their sordid
necessities, If a wise man come near them, he shall find, that as to any true
light of good learning, or sound Religion, they are as dark and dusky, as if
they had been begotten in the Eclips of the Sun, and born in the last quarter
of the Moon.

In good earnest, I wish I could find any just cause, by their speech, or
Pamphlets, to set my hand to those ample testimonials, which these gifted men
every where give of themselves and their party: I have no envy at their parts,
nor ill will against any of their persons, nor have I suffered (or at least am
not sensible of) any particular injury from any of them: So that I can without
any passion or partiality profess, that I never yet perceived any such sparks
of eminent gifts, either in reason, or Religion, as renders them, either
envyable or any way considerable in comparison of those Ministers whom they
list to cry down, (...). Isoc. Magno conatu nugas and nihil agunt.
Portentiloquia fanaticorum. Iraen. Et sana and sanantia verba. 2 Timothy 4.3.
(...).
and disparage: Poor men, they are indeed admirable (but not Imitable) for a
kind of chimicall Divinity; which after much pains and puffing, vapors into
smoke. They are rare for odd expressions and fantastic phrases, instead of
the ancient Scripture forms of wholesome words; Nothing is more wonderful ( as
monsters are) than their affected raptures, wild speculations, and strange
expressions: imagining that none sees their folly, because they shut their own
eyes, and soar above the common man's capacity in specious nonsense: and calling
those glorious Truths, which are sottish vanities, or shameful lies: What
honest hearted Christian can bear the filthy and unsavory expressions of some
of these Anti-ministeriall Ranters, Shakers, and Seekers? their metaphysicall
mincings of Blasphemy; their ridlings of Religion; their scurrilous confounding
of the Incomprehensible excellencies of God, of the Lord Jesus Christ, and of
the Blessed Spirit, with the nature of any creature never so mean and sordid,
that to them its no wonder, if the Egyptian found so many Gods in his Garden,
as he had Leeks and Onyons, or Frogs and Toads; Thus amusing their poor and
silly auditors with high blasphemies, Felices gentes quibus haec nascantur in
hortis Numina. Juv. Non credentium sed credulorum; non sanctorum sed insanorum;
non illuminatorum sed delirantium Theologia. Iraen.
and most obscure extravagancies. Such of old were the rare speculations,
inventions, and expressions of the Valentinians. Their Buthi, Aeones, Syzugiai,
Pseudevangelia, Pleromata, conceptio spiritualis, umbra (...), And a thousand
such blasphemous whimsyes, which Irenaeus tells of in his times. So that their
Dungeon-like Divinity and Midnight Doctrines, instead of fair explications of
Truth by Scripture reasonings and the demonstration of the Spirit therein, are
rather like Hedge-hogs, when they are handled, they wrap themselves up into
such prickly intricacies; as makes them not only useless, ugly and untractable;
but hurtful and scandalous to sober Christians and all true Religion; which
these fellows dress up with their foul fingers, as Black-Smiths would do fine
Ladys, fullying all they touch, while they would seem to adorn.

Certainly, If spiritual gifts, and prophesying of old, had been such ordinary
stuff, such raw and rude conceptions, such short thrums, and broken ends of
Divinity, such ridiculous and incoherent dreams, such senseless and sorry
confusions, as some of these Familisticall fancies usually bring forth, either
extempore, or premeditated, I do not believe the wisdom of the Apostle would
have bid Christians either covet it, 1 Cor. 14.1. and 39. 1 These. 5.20.
or not despise it. Both which precepts import, that such prophecyings as were
of old, and are only fit to be used in the Church, Merito contemnendi sunt isti
nugivenduli Prophetae qui-Ministerii Evangelici contemptores fastuosissimi,
nihil tamen ipsi prof^runt praeter nugas nugacissimas, and mera delmia. Zanch.
had and ought to have such tokens of excellency and worth in it, for the
edifying of Christians, as may induce wise and good Christians both to esteem
it, and desire it; of which sort I think these presumptuous Propheciers find
but a few, either to follow them or desire them, which is not the least cause
of their great envy and indignation against those excellent Ministers, who so
much stand in their light, as far out-shining them in all real abilities,
gifts and graces, they still retain the best and wisest of the people in some
fair degree of order and discretion, which forbids them to choose the figs of
these new Enthu^asts, which are very bad, before those of their ancient
Ministers, which are very good; between whom (indeed) nothing but extreme
ignorance, or ranting profaneness can make any comparison; Nor will their loud
((...)) bostings of rare discoveries, (...). Chrysostom.

(...). Profanas vocum novitates affectant, qui antiquas doctrinarum veritates
deserunt. Aust. In aliquibus splendour est de putredine. Verulam. 2 Timothy 3.7.


admirable inventions, and singular manifestations, salve their credit, or long
serve their turn: For what are their rarities and novelties, but either old
Truths in new terms, purposely translated by such brokers of religion, out of
the old forms of sound words? or else some putrid errors long ago buried, which
these ((...)) searchers of the graves of old heretics newly light upon, and
take for some rare hidden treasures. Their splendid fancies like chips of
rotten wood may shine for a while, and serve to amuse, or scare those silly
souls who are still in the dark, ever learning, and never coming, (by the
means of these Teachers) to the knowledge of the Truth; but they will never be
esteemed as beams or sparks of divine light, until all wise Christians have
lost their eyes.

I have many times been even astonished to hear, 5. The arrogance and impudence
of some pretenders to gifts against the true Ministers. Sunt qui victum
quaritant non sudore vultus sed impudentia frontis. Eras. de Monachis. Ventosa
and ^ammis ista loquacitas Religionis modestiam velut pestilenti quodam sydere
affl^t; nec veritatem ipsam minus quam castiorem illam Eloquentiam, rebus

and read of the rudeness and incivilities of these Anti-ministeriall boasters:
their blustering and crowding into Ministers Pulpits; their voluble and rattling
tongues; their no foreheads, their loud clamors; their active hands, their
indefatigable agitations. I never wanted or wished any thing more in them, to
make them complete Prophets, and Preachers, but only solidity, gravity,
modesty, charity, some savor of learning joined with humility, and zeal with
humanity; some methods of intelligible reason, and profitable
Scripture-Divinity.

Of all which they having so little, as amounts to nothing, yet I find they are
always more than Conquerours in all their adventures; If they do but affront a
grave, sober, learned, and godly Minister, (who is fit to be their father in
Instruction, and possibly has been so, before they thus degenerated) if they
dare (as what dare they not, when they go sometimes like Wolves in herds, from
place to place, s^eking what flocks, yea what Shepherds they may devour,
seduce, or scatter?) If I say they dare oppose him in his own place with their
impudent cavills, frivolous quaeries, or scurrillous objections: If they can
but interrupt him in his holy ministrations, (...). Naz. Or. 26.
or give him some astonishment to see such unwonted evil spirits appear in the
Church; If at length they can by barbarous and intolerable insolences, both
of words and actions, disorder and hinder him in his holy offices, or at least
sufficiently show the rest of the amazed people, Apud omnes gen^es illud
invaluit (...), Sacra publica non sunt temeranda. In ^^c enim uniuscujusque
gentis bominisque constat honos, quod aliquem numini suo honorem defe^unt.

how safely they can contemn, and interrupt the public service of God (which
kind of religious riot, never was tolerated in any civil Nation under Heaven,
or among any the most barbarous, that owned any public worship of their God,)
If the Minister (good man) blush, and be ashamed, or something disordered by
them, and for them; If he in wisdom think fit to confute them wi^h silence, not
answering such fools according to their folly; as Hezekiah advised his servants
to entertain the petulancy of railing Rabs^k^h: Or if he so far gratifies their
importunities, and bears with their rusticall manners, and confused ^anglings,
as to dispute with them, and by sober managing good arguments, without any
passion, to drive them to apparent non-plusses, to all manner of confusions and
contradictions; to a thousand absurdities, against all common principles of
reason, against all fundamentals of Religion; against all Scripture evidences;
against all Maxims, Logical, Moral, Historical and Theological; If his
froward opponents, impatient to be so soberly baffled, are forced to quit all
clear reason and Scripture proofs, retreating in vain, to their new lights,
fond interpretations, and false glosses; to their Seraphick whimseys, and
Enthusiasticall dreams, (which can save them, no more now from shame, than Baal
could his self-wounding and vainly Clamorous priests) so that at length they
fly to downright railing and threatening to scare the good man with the next
troopers which they can get to appear with them; if at last, like Wasps, they
are forced (by the godly Ministers learned gravity and constancy) to quit the
place, and only leave their stings of reproaches behind them, being full of
infinite malice, regret and despite for their confusion;

Their insolent boasting after their vain opposings of able Ministers.
Yet presently, after this great Achievement, the Trumpets (or rams horns
rather) must every where found among the Anti-ministeriall party; The ((...))
Triumphant songs must be sung; Every where it must ring; that the Walls of
Jericho are fallen; Babylon is stormed, Antichrist is plundered; The Pulpit guards
are routed. The victory is cried up; The Triumph must be adorned with
colorable Narratives, bitter Invectives, lying Orations, and Philippick
declamations: signifying, Et hoc proprium est eorum, qui de fide and Catholica
Ecclesia minus recte sentiunt se suosque sectatores and asseclas magni semper
face^e, omni grandiloquentia ornare, contra sentientes vilipendere, and summo

and these pretenders to be gifted men. Infensissima est ira and minime placanda
simultas quae ab invidia ad desperationem procedit, and ideo idio habet quod
alterius ^^^tiam assequi aut aemulari nequit. Lact. (...). Acts 8.9.
what glorious successes these doubty Champions had. Lastly, the poor Minister,
without any regard to his age, learning, worth, or credit, together with his
whole tribe and function, must in a fanatic pageantry be led captive; In their
black coats, and mourning habits, they must sadly follow the Chariot of these
invincible Heroes; who like Caesar, do but come, and see, and conquer any true
Minister whatsoever, be he never so fortified with learning, prudence,
experience, good credit and conscience; all these are but stubble to that fiery
spirit, which is in these holy In^^nd^aries, who, like Don Quixots, or Knights
Errants, have so many Romances of religion in their heads, strange fancies and
enchanting opinions, that they never want Windmills and Giants to encounter;
yea, and they never make adventures without glorious successes, and
unimaginable M ^cles; doing more wonderful feats with a D^arf, or a Squire,
and an Enchantment, than ever the most fortu^^e General did, with the best
disciplined Army of horse and foot. And in the heat of these Rodomontadoes of
that credulous and cruel Fa^^or, their disdain of Ministers arises so high,
that they meditate n^^ing less, than to sacrifice them all to their just wrath
and indignation; as ^itas did Baals priests (for so they call the best of our
Ministers) as if all the English world had lately been convinced, by these
gifted men, of their former errors, and converted by Miracl^ and fire from
heaven at the word of these rare Teachers, from listni^g to, or regarding any
more, their true Ministers.

Thus is their ordinary overvaluing of themselves; thus their scorn of all
others; thus their implacable anger against all able and good Ministers, which
is therefore the more black and desperate, because it arises from Envy, and
amounts to despair, while they cruelly suspect, and sometimes smartly find,
and sensibly feel the real abilities of Ministers, both publicly appearing,
and generally esteemed by all wise and good Christians, far beyond their
Phantasms, their frothy noyses, and mere shows of being (as Simon Magus coveted
to be esteemed) some great one; when he bewitched the people of Samaria, both
great and small, so far as to think him the power of the great God. This makes
them so touchy and impatient of fair disputes, of calm and sober Conferences,
contenting themselves to be blustering scorners, and tumultuary opposers of
those excellent Ministers, whom to compare to such Zanys, Dwarfs and Pigmi^s,
(as to any true worth of men, or excellency of Christians, or abilities and
gifts for the Ministry) were to honor these, and to disparage those too much.

For what, I beseech you, ( O wise and excellent Christians (for to you still I
must appeal) are in good earnest those great gifts, and rare abilities which
these later Donatists so much boast of against the true and Ordained Ministers
of this Church? Are they those grave, learned, and well digested-collections;
or those judicious, sweet, and wholesome Confections; or those cordial and
spiritfull distillations, of divine and saving truths, diligently gathered (as
Industrious Bees do their Honey) from various readings, by assiduous studies,
frequent prayers, serious meditations, and well-made observations? Are they
from search and understanding of the Sacred Originals of the Divine Oracles,
Whence the real abilitities of true Ministers; and what.
or from much converse in elaborate Commentaries upon the Scriptures; from
diligent reading of secular and Ecclesiastical Histories; from good in-sight
into all commendable Authors and Sciences? All which the studies and labors of
holy and learned Ministers have competently or plentifully afforded them; and
they have brought forth to the Churches of Christ, in all ages; and in no age
or Church more liberally, than in this last age, and in this Church of England.
By which Methods of wisdom attending daily at her Posts and Gates, true and
able Ministers have filled, and are daily filling the treasuries of their
minds, Mat. 12.35. Vetera legendo and meditando, nova invenire aiscimus. Quint.
with excellent and wel-digested matters, both old and new, fitting themselves
for every good word and work: All which digestions of holy studies, they
seasonably, orderly, and discreetly bring forth with all the advantages (for
the peoples profiting) of grave, clear, Methodicall and lively Eloquence, both
in Praying and Preaching. These indeed have been, and still are, by Gods
blessing, the real Ministerial sufficiencies, which the true Ministers of
England have been, and still are blessed withal; which these pretenders envy,
despair of, despise, and would destroy.

The insufficiencies of of the Anti-ministerials, and whence.
Because they know indeed (and so do the most and best of men) that their short
teddar will by no artifice of clamor, railing, and Popular flatteries ever
stretch near to that proportion which true Ministers have, no more, than the
Tead in the fable, could swell it self to the emulated Ox. Alas, all the
frippery of these Brokers and bosters, (who have nothing but a Long-l^ne, or
second-hand divinity, which they so much hang out at their shop windows)
extends to no more than a plagiary way of filching and stealing whole
discourses, or taking some Sermon notes, from some able Ministers preaching, or
writing; This good matter they miserably profane and deface, with their evil
prefacings, odd patchings, ragged mang^ings of it, and wild digressions from
it, the better to conceal their theft; yet is this laziness and theevery the
very best of their shifts; and among the most venial arts, which are used by
these Wasps and Drones, which now begin to grow Hornets, and hope to drive the
true Ministers, as the old Cananites, out of this good Land, that they may
inherit it; Jos. 24.12.
They have no other staves and crutches to lean their lameness upon, but only
such as they have gathered out of the Ministers own woods, and now (like
ungracious children) they beat with them both their own Parents, and the
Planters.

For, if at any time these brazen orators adventure to entertain their leaden
Auditors (who like Callow birds gape wide, Ferreae frontu Oratores, plumbei
cereb^i auditoribus delectantur.
and are greedy to swallow any thing which is brought them,) with stuff of
their own proper mal-invention, un-preparation, and dis-composure; Nothing is
commonly more weak and flashy, (like whites of Eggs without salt,) Nothing more
loose, spungy, insinnewie, and unsubstantiall, than what arises from no higher
source than their own brains: their sudden and shallow fancies, which like
Rhewm easily swims out of their lips, yea worse, many times nothing is more
pestilently erroneous, and more fanatically confused; Even most unwholesome, and
(to well-tasting Christians) most unsavory medlies of filthy falsehoods,
desperate and damnable doctrines, tempered (as the Ratsbane of old Heretics
(which Tertullian tells of) was wont) with some mixtures of Scripture Texts,
some light inspersions of Truth, Nihil proficit Congestio Scripturarum, nisi
plane aut stomachi quis ineat eversionem aut cerebri. Tert. de H^^ret.

Adjectionibus and detractionibus ad dispositionem instituti sui scripturas

to make them more appetitious and passable with their (at first it may be)
somewhat squeamish disciples, who by little and little, as Mithridates, wonting
themselves to nibble and sip off poisons, come to that confidence, that they
venture to quaff up any draughts, into which their bolder Mountebanks evidently
squeeze, and infuse the venom of most loathsome Creatures; such as have spit
out their poison, like the Racovian Catechism, and such like primers of the
Devil, against Christ, and the holy Spirit; against the grace of God, the Law,
the Scriptures; against the glorious Essence, goodness, and wisdom of God;
against the Sabbath and Sacraments; against all duties, all distinctions of
order, or office in the Church; against all restraints of humane laws, against
all holiness, Morality, and modesty in men's lives; The only Antidote which
their wretched hearers have against all these, or the like poisons of souls, is
no other, but their custom of drinking such horrid and abominable liquors,
whose venom has so stupefied their consciences, that they are past all feeling
and sense, of either sin, shame, or sorrow. Nor is there ever any of these new
Rabbis, who can content himself with either the orders of this Church, or the
Articles of Sound doctrines, or Catechisticall foundations and principles which
it has embraced and propounded, upon very grave and good advise, as most safe
and necessary for Christians; They must ever have some new fangle, either of
opinion, or practice, to make them remarkable.

7. Gifts alone make not a Minister, nor furnish him with true Ministerial
power and authority.
But, if I should yield (which I cannot do with truth) or only suppose some of
these men to have even ordinary Apostolical gifts, (as they vainly and falsely
pretend) yet even these would not make them beyond, or better than falls
Apostles, unless they had the call, mission and authority, which true Apostles
had immediately from Christ, and which false Apostles untruly pretended to, who,
though they taught the truth, yet with falsity pretended, they had seen the
Lord Jesus, and were sent as other Apostles by him; Nor will those common gifts
make them ordinary Prophets or Ministers in the Church, unless they have the
ordinary call and mission, which Christ has settled in the Church; A Serpent of
gold, would not have brought those healing effects, which the brazen did, at
Gods appointement Gifts of knowledge and utterance alone, are not
qualifications sufficient for men to challenge the right of Ordination to
public Ministry; for the moralls and practiques of men, as well as their
intellectuals, are much to be considered; the Priest might be able, and the
Levite lusty for service, when they were unclean, and so unfit for the Temple.
The levity, haughtiness, rudeness, boastings, and inconstancies observable in
some men's looks, gesture, habit, and carriage (as St. Ambrose guessed at the
mine and garb of two Presbyters, who afterward proved stark naught) makes them
less fit to be ordained Ministers in the Church, than many, who have weaker
gifts, but discover more prudence, gravity, meekness, humility, and diligence.

Autoritas Charismata praesupopanit, at Charismata autoritatem non ponunt.
Gerard. de Minist. Qualis ordinatio talis successus. Luth. 1 Cor. 3.3.
A stock, and gifts, and parts, either natural or acquired, though never so
thrifty and spreading, is of it self, but as a crabstock, and can of it self
bear no other than sour fruits, of Factions, Schisms, Emulations, and carnal
confusions in the Church, till it is grafted with holy ordination, by that due
ministerial power, which is in the Church: As there are formally, or truly, no
true Sacraments, where the same Elements and words materi^lly are used, unless
there be also a right Minister of holy things, who acts and consecrates not in
any natural or civil capacity as from his own mind, or other men's will, but
by delegation and appointment from Christ; nor can there be a right Minister,
In actionibus tam sacris qua^ civilibus id validum quod legitimum. Reg. Ju.
or Officer from Christ (as I formerly proved) where there is not a right
patent, divine power and commission given in his Name by due ord^nation; as it
is but treason and rebellion, for the ab^est Statesman or Lawyer, to undertake
and act the part of an Ambassador or Judge, until he be made such, by those,
in reference to whose will and work, such power and employment only can be
conferred; That cannot be done in another name, which is not done by his
consent, Quo meliores eo dete^iores. Verulam. de Jesuitis.
and according to his declared will. Men of the greatest gifts, if they are
disorderly in the Church, are but as Wens in the hod^, the greater the worser,
the more they swell beyond the model and true proportion of the bodies
features, the more deformity and inconvenience they bring to the whole body;
nor has any man any cause to boast of them; for it is not the greatness, but
fitness of parts, which makes them handsome or useful to the whole; who knows
not that great wits and parts are oft-times great temptations? as was said of
Origin, Magnum ingenium magna tentatio. Vinc. Lyrin. de Origin, and Tertul.
Genesis 3.
whose frequent Preaching in the Church of Alexandria, before he was Ordained
Presbyter, gave great offense to grave and godly men, imputing his after errors
and fall to his too great forwardness and presumption. The Serpent, which was
subtiller than other beast^, is chosen by the Devil, as a fit organe for to
convey his temptations: Proud and presumptuous gifts in men, are no better than
those inordinate excrescencies, which exceed men's noses, or blind their eyes,
or sometimes swell bigger than their heads; nor will their fate be better at

and the extraordinary number of his fingers and toes, (which were twenty four
in all) yet there wanted not of David's worthies, who slew him, when he defied
the Church of God: 2 Cor. 10.12.
If men be left to measure themselves only by thems lves, (as most of these
overwise-men do) which of them but is prone to think very highly of himself?
and like the Apes in the fable, fancy they can build as brave Houses, and
Cities, and Churches, as the ablest man, but when they come to the Wood, they
have not so much as Sawes, or Axes, or any tools to begin the work withal?

But these over-forward men usually reply with great sadness and severity
against Ministers Monopolising of the duty and office of Preaching the Gospel,
That Paul rejoiced if any preached Christ; Phil. 1.18.
8. Of St. Paul's rejoicing that any way Christ was preached. Phil. 2.21. Acts
17.11.
though of envy and evil will, though not Ordained, etc. I answer, first, It
does not appear, but those men might have due Ministerial power, to preach the
Gospel; and yet through passion or faction they abused this power, seeking
their own things, and not the things of Christ. Or secondly, It may be their
preaching was, but private, domestique, and charitative Instruction or
confirming of others, repeating as the Bereans, what they had learned of St.
Paul, or other Apostles, which is not denied to any sober Christians, but only
required to be kept within those bounds of Order and humility, so as it neither
becomes rival to, or opposer of, nor yet a despiser, and at last an abolisher
of the office of the public Ministry, which is the design of the
presumptuous, and pretenders against the Ministers. Thirdly, If those whom the
Apostle speaks of, were not Pre^^^ers by office, but only by their own little
motives of applause or profit, or Envy and the like, they were moved to preach
the Gospel of Christ, yet they did not like ou^ modern Intrud^rs and Usurpers
bo^st of Extraordinary g^fts and call; nor did they deny, or seek to overthrow
in others the ordinary power and office of that Ministry, which Christ and the
Apostles had settled in the Church, and to which they pretended to have a zeal.
Fourthly, at the worst, what ever they were, or did, regularly or irregularly,
as to the point of Preaching Christ crucified, the Apostle so far rejoiced,
not, as they were passionate, or peevish, envious, disorderly, etc. but so far,
as God restrained them in any moderate bounds of truth-speaking. It was some
joy to see a less degree of mischief, and scandal arise from their perverseness
and spite; That they did not blaspheme that Name, and preach another Gospel;
or corrupt this in points of doctrine, with Jewish or Heretical leaven; no
less than they did with those tinctutes of passions, envy, and defects of
Charity: A good Christian may rejoice at any preparation of men to receive the
Gospel, In omni malo est aliqua boni mixtura; Simpliciter enim and absolute
malum esse non potest; Neque enim est malum pura negatio, sed debiti boni
privatio, neque est cognoscibile nisi per bonum. Tho. Aq. 1. q. 14. Non humane
est imbecilitatis plena indagine conoscere qua ratione Deu^ mala fieri
patiatur, quae non incuria sed consilio permittuntur. Salv. l. 1. Gub. Mirandum
non est quod mala exurgant, sed vigilandum est ne noceant, nec permitteret Deus
ex surgere nisi sanctos per hujusmodi tentationes erudiri expediret. Aust. Ep.
141.
as in the Indies, tho they be first taught it, in much weakness and
superstition; It is so far happy, in the worst of times and things, that there
is no simple or sincere evil, which has not some mixture of good in it, which
it abuses, else it could not be at all; and some extraction of good may be
from it by the omnipotent wisdom of God, causing all things to work together
for the good of his Church.

Gods permissions not to be urged against his Precepts and Institutions.
But what sober Christian will urge Gods permissions against his Precepts and
Institutions? The rule in the Word is still right, constant, and divine, though
in the water of events, providence may seem crooked and irregular. Gods
toleration of evil, of disorders, or heresies in the Church, does not justify
them in the least kind against his Word, which forbids them. The Apostle was
glad (and so may we be in evil times) that things were no worse, but he allows
them not to be so bad; Quae permittit Deus non approbat in permisso praviter
agente, quamvis appr^bet permissionem suam profundissime and potentissime
sapientia quae bona ex malo ducenda novit. Vid. Aust. Ep. 120. and Ep. 159. In
abdito est cons^lium Dei, quo malis been utitur, mirificans bonitatis suae
omnipotentiam. Romans 3.8. Multa sunt in intention operantis ^ala, quae in
eventu operis bona sunt. Aquin. Praescientia and praepotentia sua non rescindit
Deus libertatem creaturae quam instituerat. Tertul. lib. 2. cont. Marc^on. vid.
Synes. ep. 57.
nor would he approve the doing of evil, or the envy and spightfulness in
preaching, that good might come thereby; He only considered it in the event, as
to Gods disposing, not in the agent or fact, as to man's perverting; A sober and
wise man may make a good use of others madness and folly, as God does of man's
and devils malice. One may rejoice, that there are some poisonous creatures,
by which to make Theriacas and Antidotes; Many venomous beasts have the cure in
them against their own stings and po^sons.

The same Apostle might rejoice in the supposed (not decreed and absolute)
Necessity of Heresies (There must be heresies; 1 Cor. 11.19.
) that (as in these times) the constancy of judicious and sincere Christians
may be made manifest. It is some ease that Impostumes break, Plus est
jucunditatis in sapientia Dei, quae bona e ma^is extrahit, quam in malis
molestiae. Lact. l. de Ira. Respondet Epicuri quaest. cur Deus permisit mala,
cum and potens sit, and bonus, Permisit malum ut e^icaret bonum. Id. Acts 27.
whereby corrupt humors are let out and spent: possibly the Apostle might in
some sense or notion have rejoiced in the storm he suffered, and the shipwreck,
so far as it discovered Gods extraordinary protection to him, and for his sake,
to those with him. And so may all his faithful Servants the Ministers, have
cause at last to rejoice, when the Lord has brought them and this Church to
the fair haven, after this foul weather, which seeks to overwhelm them. But
Christ is in the ship, and they have a good Pilot God, whose Spirit, with their
own, bids them be of good cheer. The Lord can and will save his that be godly,
from so great a death. But such joys are the serious and sincere raptures of
very godly and wise men, far enough sequestered from the flashes of the world;
which hardly ever discern in Events, what is of God, from what is of man; Good
events, in which Gods over-powring is seen, are often consequentiall, not
intentionall, Severa res est gaudium. Sen. Cl. Alex. (...). 4. (...).
as to the second agents, and flow not from their will or virtue, but follow
their work, through Gods sovereign overruling; who, as St. Austin says, would
not permit any evil of sin to have been in, and from the creatures pravity of
free will, and infirmity of power, if his infinite both power and goodness, had
not known how to extract the good of his glory, out of the greatest evil.

And truly this good, we hope, through the mercy of God, The good which may
come from this evil to true Ministers. Phil. 1.16.
both all true Ministers, and all true Christians in this Church of England,
will reap, by this envy, contention, spiteful, unsincere and uncivil dealing
of these Anti-ministeriall Adversaries, (who cry up their new preaching, and
prophesying ways, thereby thinking to add affliction to those bonds and
distresses which are upon Ministers in these dangerous and difficult times,)
That this will make all true Ministers more study to be able for to walk worthy
of, and always to adorn that holy profession, and divine Ministration which
they have upon them, that so they may stop the mouths of gainsayers, Tit. 1.9
Saluberrimus est malorum and inimicorum usus, quo illorum quadam (...), and
meliores and vigilantiores reddamur. Erasm. 1 Cor. 3.1.
who lie in wait for their halting, and re^oyce at their fallings; Also it will
breed in all others that are serious, sound, and good Christians, a greater
abhorrency of these insolent and disorderly ways in the Church, the root and
fruits of which are carnal, not spiritual, pride, faction, strife,
bitterness, confusion, scom of religion, corruption of all true doctrine and
holy manners, neglect and disuse of holy duties; profaneness and disposition to
all superstitions, licentiousness, flatteries, and lukewarmness, as to the
power of the true reformed Religion; As is most evident in those places, where
these New-pretenders have most intrud^d themselves, and extruded the true and
able Ministers. Sad experience will shortly teach all such as love this Church
and Reformed religion, Contempt of tho Ministers of the Gospel, paves and
strowes the Devils highway to all impiety.
how much it concerned them to have endeavored great vindications, and by
civil Sanctions of the honor of the public Ministry; That there may be exact
care in the right authority for ordination, and true ancient succession, which
conferrs the Divine power and office; as also good encouragements, and
assistance in the due execution of it, that it may not be exposed to so many
affronts, reproaches, and disgraces, of vile men, and insolent manners, who
fear not, openly to contemn such a reformed Church, and its so famous Ministry,
together with the whole Nation, and the Laws of it, even in so high a nature
and measure as this is, to vilify their public Religion, and to seek to
extirpate the true Ministry of it*

quae versutissima haereticorum pravitas and deturpare and eradicare conabatur.
Cham^er. Doctis medicis dant pretium medicastri, ut veris Theologis insuisi and
impudentes Theologastri: I^si morbi minus noxii sunt quam medici imperiti.
Fernel.
As good Laws often rise by the occasion of evil manners, like Antidotes from
Poisons; so advantages may at last accrue to the Reformed religion, and to the
true Ministry of it, by these oppositions. Nothing makes the luster of truth to
shine more clear and welcome, than those clowdings and blasphemies, under which
it may, for a time, be hidden and Ecclips^d; Nothing will make able Physicians
more necessary and valued, than the swarms of such ignorant Quacks, as are of
no value, who are more dangerous than any Plague or Epidemical disease; Nor is
the estate of any Church, as to Religion, more safe, by the multitudes of
preaching Mou^t^banks, in stead of True and able Ministers. In stead of
Propating the Gospel, they will every whereso corrupt it with errors, so abase
it with prejudices and scandals, so harden men against the power of it, by the
rottenness and hypocrisy of their ways, that there will be more need of able
and true Ministers to recover and settle the honor of the true Christian
religion in this Nation, than if it were now first to be converted from
Paganism; For the Devils strongest holds are those, which are fashioned after
the platforms of religion, and pretend to more than ordinary piety.

9. The Character of Antiministerial prete^d^rs to gifts, (...). Naz. (...).
Naz. Or. 1.
So that when I consider the temper and form of this Antiministeriall faction in
England, I find, that their heads by a ricketly kind of religion, are grown too
heavy for their weak and overburthened limbs; Their self-conceit of their
extraordinary gifts and abilities, presuming themselves to be able to do, what
ever they fancy, makes them more than ordinarily disabled, as to any good word
or work; Like Narcissus, they are so deluded with the flattering Ecchos of
their ^ll^ admirers; and so taken with their own fashion, in such false
glasses; that they are like to d^at, till they die, and starve themselves, as
to all real sufficiencies, by the fond imagination of how great gifts they
have, and their ignorance of how much (indeed) they want. Nothing more hinders
real abilities, than too hasty presumptions of them: If any of these
glorios^es have any competent gifts of knowledge, as to some things of
Religion, yet (like the Chickens hatched by the force of Ovens in the heat of
Camels-Dung, as at Aleppo, Damascus, and other places in the East) they have
commonly something in them, monstrous, odd, extravagant; either defective or
superfluous in opinions, or practice; In intellectuals, or morals, or
prudentials; Either vain or morose; Humanis oculis locata Religio. Cries. l. 9.
light or tetricall; rude or proud; popular or affectated; Impatient of nothing
so much as the bounds of that honest calling, in which God, and the Laws have
placed them; Ardeliones isti tepidos se suspicantur nisi inquieti sint, nec
zelantes satis se credunt nisi omnia incendiis commiscentes and pulcherrima
quaeque Religionis in cin^res redigentes. Gerard. Phraeneticus and immundus
ignorantiae Spiritus. Ire. l. 1. c. 13. Qui custodiet ipsos custodes. Tutela
intutissima.
Unsatisfied and ever quarrelling with that sober, peaceable, settled way of
judicious and humble piety; which becomes good Christians, adorns the Gospel,
and keeps up the honor of the Reformed Religion, and of this Church of
England; which, these men's late violent extravagancies, and disorderly
walkings, beyond and contrary to all holy rules of Religion, all modest bounds,
of reason, Law, and common order among men and Christians, seek to make weary,
sick, and ashamed of it self; when it shall see it self robbed and spoiled of
all its able Ministers, Reverend Bishops, learned Presbyters, and orderly
Professors, and only guarded by a riotous and incomposed rabble of such, whose
ignorance, weakness and confusions will only serve to betray and destroy, the
Reformed Religion; but never to defend it, against those many, malicious,
crafty and well armed adversaries; who do but ly in wait for opportunities, to
weaken, dishonor, disorder, and quite overthrow, both this and all other
Reformed Churches.

Alas, these gifted men, who spread so large sayls, hang out such fair
streamers, and seek to make so goodly a show to the vulgar simplicity, as if
they were strong built, well rigid, and richly laden vessels, (fit to endure
those rough Seas and storms, to which both the Truth and Ministry of the
Gospel are frequently exposed; (...). Arist. de Virt. and vit. Audacia est

) are easily judged by all wise and truly learned Christians, to be but light
keels, and flat bottomed Boats; by their floting so loftily; by their running
so boldly over any shelves and rocks of opinion; by their putting into every
small creek of controversy; which shows, they draw very little water; that they
have not the due ballast of weighty knowledge and sound judgment; the want of
which makes them so fool hardy, so apt to be tossed to and fro with every wind
of doctrine; so prone to grow Leaky and foul, either letting in under water,
cunningly and secretly, corrupt and brackish opinions, or shipping in
above-deck, openly and boldly, whole Seas of any sinister ends, and worldly
interests, that are abroad in the storms and waves and confusions of civil
affairs; from which the best Christians study always to keep themselves most
free and unspotted.

Mat. 23.5. Confirmatur hypocrisis Pharisaei quando ampliantur Philacteria.
Chrysostom.
The large Philacteri^s of pretended preaching gifts, which some men so
Pharisaically set forth to the vulgar view (who as St. Jerome says, easily
admire what they hardlyest understand) do not presently make them such Rabbis,
and teachers in Israel, as they fancy and affect to be counted, where there is
or may be had far better supplies of such able, and right ordained Ministers,
as the Church of England has brought up. These are graces and gifts of the
Spirit to be showed in men's silence, as well as in their speaking: (as he that
knew how to hold his peace put in his name among the famous Orators;) Yea if
the case of this Church were so desolate as some pretend, and destitute of able
and faithful Ministers, (which blessed be God it yet is not) yet few of these
forward intruders of themselves have such sober gifts, and well-grounded
knowledge in the mysteries of Christian, and in the ordinary controversies of
the Reformed Religion, as might supply the Church in its cases of necessity;
wherein any Christians or Churches may possibly crave and have some relief, as
to the teaching, co^firming, or comforting part of the Ministry, from the
larger and golden rule of Charity; Where Christian communion makes believers
useful to each other, not out of Office and special duty, but out of love,
and that general relation they have to each other; Which necessity thanks be
to God is not yet the Case of this Church, nor shall ever need to be (by Gods
blessing) if Magistrates and true Ministers would do the duties, which become
them in their places: Though the Harvest be great, yet the Laborers are not
few, which are of the Lords sending, Mat. 9.37.
if they may be suffered to do the Lords work: And if those sturdy gleaners and
pilferers (who thrust themselves into others men's fields and labors) did not
every where disturb and hinder them by their sharking and scrambling. 10. The
Churches supplies in cases of necessity, When true Ministers cannot be enjoyed.

libertas non indicit necessitas. Ber. Ep. 113. 1 Kings 17.6. 1 Kings 17.


Who doubts, or denies, but in cases of real, not feigned, affected, or
imaginary necessity, when Christians are forcibly deprived of their true
Pastors and Ministers, the Lord Jesus Christ, who has special care of his
Church, by the assistance of his Spirit, can turn the water of some Laymens
weaker gifts, into wine, for the Instruction, confirmation, and consolation of
scattered and desolated Christians; Although those teachers are not every way
exactly prepared, nor fitted for every work of the Sanctuary? Rather than poor
Christians, that hunger for the food of Heaven, should wholly want refreshing,
Ravens shall feed them, as they did wildred and banished Eliah: A lay man's
barrel of meal and cruse of Oil, that is, his good skill and sound
understanding in the main fundamentals of faith, and holy practice; Also in
those gracious promises which God has made to upright hearts; these may have
miraculous augmentations and effussions to sustain a widowed Church and Orphan
Christians in time of dearth: But we must not therefore suffer these
Acephalists, these circulators and beggars to persuade us, De Acephalis. Hos
neque inter laicas n^que inter clericos Religio detentat divina: mixtum genus
est prolesque biformis. Isid. Hispa. de off. Ec. lib. 2. c. 3.
that we are famished in our fathers house (where we see servants are wanton
with fullness of Bread) merely that they may boast, how they have made us to eat
of their moldy scraps, and drink of their musty bottels. In the confusions of
a family, where violence overbears settled order, (removing both chief and
inferior Officers;) those supplies are commendable, which the charity and
discretion of any servants can afford one the other, yet without usurping any
place and authority, which they have not, over others: But in a settled and
orderly family, where there are Stewards and Officers appointed, it is a
preposterous charity for every Servant to undertake to give to the Children, or
Servants of the family, their portions. Precedents of extraodinary sustentation
with Bread, Wine, and Oil, either by miracle or Charity, are no warrant for any
men's presumptions, rashness, and disorder, in ordinary cases, any more, than
those forenamed examples should justify any man from madness, who presuming of
extraordinary supplies, would cut up all Vines, or plant no Olives, or use no
tillage and Husbandry, which are the ways of Gods ordinary providence, both to
exercise and reward men's honest and orderly industry. In like manner, where the
Churches or societies of Christians greater or smaller are blessed with the
enjoyment of those institutions and gifts which Christ has appointed and
bestowed for the joint and public good of his Church, in planting, preserving,
and propagating true Religion with good order: (which ever was, and is to be
carried on by the right Ministration of the word and Sacraments, and other holy
Offices properly belonging to duly ordained and authorized Ministers) there, no
pretended liberty, or affected and self-made necessity, Prima est necessitas
quam praecipientis Dei autoritas imponit; Secunda, quam permittentu providentia
dispensat; Tertia quam deficientis in officio negligentia cogit, quam and
peccatum esse and sui paenam credas. Bern. Necessitas quod cogit defendit, modo
absit malum morale. Eccl. 10.8.
no right of common-age or levelling zeal, may violate the bounds, which Christ
has set, and the Churches ever observed; He that breaks the hedges of
Religious order in the Church, the Serpent of an evil conscience shall bite
him.

All true Christian Liberties, that is, such as are Libertas ut matrona, decora

procumbens, qua^ in solio seden^: ornatior orans quam imperans. Jeron.

orderly and useful, are by all godly and learned Ministers, allowed, and
encouraged, in all faithful people, of whatsoever calling, quality, and
condition; Masters in their families; Magistrates on their Benches; Commanders
amidst their Soldiers; Princes among their subjects, cannot appear, more to
their honor and advantage within their places and callings, than, when, like
Solomon, they shine with that wisdom, piety, and devotion, which becomes all
true Christians, on all occasions; and may make them merit the honor of
Princes and Preachers too in Jerusalem; which liberties and abilities, the
humble piety of wise and modest Christians knows, how soberly and discreetly to
use as to any occasion of private charity, or public edification in their
places; yet not insolently and unseasonably to abuse it: so, as to disparage,
neglect, and usurp upon the public ordained Ministry. Every one may read and
recite, and tell others of an Act or Proclamation, and help them to understand
it; but only an Herald or Officer may publicly proclaim it, in the name of him
that grants it. Children or servants in any family may impart of their
Provision and Bread to one another in charity and love: but this they do, not
as Stewards and Officers, whose place is to give to every one their portion in
due season. We read the Bereans were (...), More noble: Not for undertaking to
Preach, but for industrious searching the certainty of the truth, duly Preached
to them by the Apostles. Nothing is more generous and noble than orderly and
Religious Industry. It were happy for all good Ministers, Acts 17.11.
if there were every where more of those noble, generous and industrious
Christians among their hearers, who like the Bereans, by often meditating,
searching, repeating, mutual conferring, applying, and (if need be) by further
explaning, as they are able and have experience, of the word, duly Preached to
them, would as it were break the clods, and Harrow in the good Seed, after the
Ministers Plowing and Sowing: Yet still there is a large difference, between a
true Ministers Preaching in Gods name to the Judges at Assizes, and the Judges
reciting or applying some points of the Sermon, with wisdom and piety; so far
as suites with the charge he gives; not as a Minister but as a Christian
Magistrate; whose Commission is only civil, Spontanea voluntate non
sacerdotali antoritate obtulerunt sacrificia, Abram, Isaac, Jacob. Isid. Hisp.
l. 2. off. Eccl. c. 3.
to do civil Justice according to Law, and power given by man, between man and
man; the other as a Minister is sacred; to reveal the righteousness of God in
Christ, to men, for the eternal salvation of their souls.

But why any Christian should affect in peaceable times, and in a plentiful
soil, to have either any man that lists to employ himself, or no Husbandmen or
laborers at all in Gods Field and Vineyard, who by special care, skill, and
authority should look to its right ordering and improvement most to the
increase of Gods glory, and the Churches benefit, I can yet see no reason; save
only those depths and devices of Satan; which are hid under the arbitrary
speciousness and wantoness of some poor gifts, the better to cover those
designs, which the pride, malice, hypocrisy, Sophillae verborum magis esse
volentes quam discipuli veritatis. Irenaeus de iis qui successionem Apostolicam
deserunt. l. 3. c. 40. 1 Cor. 14.32. In docti praepropere docentes plerunque
dedocenda docent; plus zizanii quam tritici seminantes: culturam Domini
inficiunt magis quam perficiunt. Aust.
and profaness of some men's hearts aim at; which are not hard to be discerned
in many men, by that extreme loathness, and tenderness, which those tumors, and
inflamed swellings of their gifts, and self conceited sufficiencies have, to be
tried or touched, by the laying on of hands; that is in a due, exact, and
orderly way of examination, approbation and Ordination; The fear is, lest if
such pitiful Prophets Spirits should be subject to the Prophets, they should
be found to have more need to be taught the mysteries, and principles of
Religion, than any way fit to teach others, by a most preposterous presumption;
whose foolish have makes but the more wast, both of Peace and order, truth and
charity in the Church.

The greatest abillities of private Christians, being orderly and humbly
exercised, are no way inconsistent with the function of the Ministry; they may
be easily and wisely reconciled, however some men (whose interest lies in our
discords and divisions) would fain set them at variance; That Ministers should
be jealous of their ablest hearers; and these emulous of their faithfullest
Ministers. No hearers are more welcome to able Ministers, than such as are, in
some kind, fit to teach, reproove, admonish, and comfort others: Nor are any
men more humbly willing to be taught and guided in the things of God, by their
true Ministers, than those who know how to use the gifts of knowledge, they
attain, without despising the chiefest means by which they and others do attain
it; which is, by the public Ministry of the Church: This enables them to
benefit others, in charity; but not to bost of their gifts in a factious
vanity; or to give any grief, or disorder to the Ministers of the Church; who
besides their labors in the Pulpit, have so furnished the Church with their
writings from the Press, that, such Christians as can content themselves with
safe and easy humility, rather than laborious and dangerous pride, may, upon
all occasions, (I think) full as well, and for the most part, far better, make
use, in their families, of those excellent English Treatises, Sermons, The use
of excellent Books of Divinity Printed in English, far beyond most men's
prophesying.
and Commentaries, which are judiciously set forth in all kinds of Divinity,
than any way pride and please themselves in that small stock of their own
gifts, either ex tempore or premeditated; which serious reading of those
learned and holy Ministers works would do every way as well, and far better
than this, which weak men call prophesying, that is, reciting (it may be by
rote) some raw and jejune notions, and disorderly meditations of their own;
which must needs come far short of reading distinctly, and considering
seriously those excellent discourses, which learned and wise men have
plentifully furnished them with, both with less pains, and more profit to
themselves, and others; I am sure with less hazard, of error, froth, and
vanity, than what is incident to those self Ostentations of gifts, which have
more of the tongue, than heart or head; and oft-times resemble more the Player,
than the Preacher.

So that the late published Patron of the Peoples privilege and duty as to the
matter of prophesying, needed not to have added to his Book the odious title of
the Pulpits and Preachers enoroachment: 12. Animadversions on some passages in
that Book called The Peoples Privilege and Duty as to prophesying, etc.
For, if that Author will undertake to regulate the trial and exercise of
those gifts of Lay people, which he finds or fancies in them, within such
bounds of real and approved abilities, of humble, useful, and seasonable
exercising of them, without any Enter fering with, or diminution of the
function, and authority of the true, and orde^ned Ministry, which is the aim he
seems to propound, I will undertake that no able and good Minister shall forbid
the Banes, which he has so publicly asked; Finding indeed no cause, why these
two may not be lawfully joined together, in a Christian and comfortable union,
the public gifts of Ministers, in a public way of divine Authority; and
private gifts of the faithful, in a way of private Christian Charity: Nor ever
did the Godly Fathers and Ministers of the Church encroach upon, put away, or
give any bill of Divorce to the humble and usefully gifted Christians Liberty;
Only, finding by experience, that (like Dinah) it is prone to gad abroad, run
out through wantonness, pride, or weakness, to much disorder, vanity, and
confusion (besides foolish and corrupt opinions,) and of late, to a petulancy,
contempt, and emulating of the public Ordinance of the Ministry, the wisdom of
the Church, in all ages (for ought I can see) did think fit to keep it, within
those safe and privater bounds of families, or at most within such friendly
meetings, as are short of public solemn Church assemblys: Nor was the modesty
of any humble Christian ever grieved, that his abilities should be so wisely
restrained; While yet, it had all private freedom and due encouragements; And
in public far better and more orderly supplies from Gods rich treasury, than
from its own purse and penury.

As for the public use of that Liberty and gifts of prophesying, which that
Gentleman so much cries up and magnifies; I do not think him so much a puny in
discretion, but that he must needs see, it will be encumbered with many and
hardly evitable inconveniences, Inconveniences attending that prophesying of
the people on the Lords Day.
so that it will be easy for a wise man to see the Quare impedit. For first,
most good Christians are commonly well satisfied with those solemn public
exercises, and duties, upon the Lord's Day, as praying often; reading often;
expounding the Scriptures; Catechizing many times; and twice Preaching always;
besides the ce^ebrating of one, or both Sacraments; All which are the
blessings, which the bounty of God has plentifully provided for Christian
people, and powers on them every Lords Day by the Labors of their faithful
and able Ministers; whom Christ and the order of the Church, have undoubtedly
set over them in the way of Divine Authority; And to whom all serious
Christians attend, as of duty and conscience; affording means sufficient, by
Gods blessing on their devout attentions, judicious understandings, retentive
memorys, fervent affections, and suitable conversations, to save their souls;
For whom it were infinitely better, to have every where such a Minister duly
settled, and competently maintained, by those Revenews, which are in all Law
both divine and humane, due, as given for this service of God and the Church;
than for Christians to be fobbed off, with new projects of Prophets, gifted
Brethren, and modern Itinerant inconstant and Mendicant Preachers; which will
amount to nothing but mischief; however they may make a show for a while, as if
there needed no constant resident Ministers, or other settled and ordained
Ministry; That so a way may be made to ignorance, superstition, Atheism and
profaness, First; And in time, that sacred Revenew which is given to God, for
the maintenance of his public service and Ministry, may be turned to some
secular uses, and come into private purses. It is most evident, that what
prophesying exercise is by any gifted Brethren added (in public) on the Lords
Day to this sufficiency of the Ministry, will (for the most part) come very
short of that weight, worth, and Authority, which usually is in the Ministers
learned pains; So that, it will seem, but as a Churl upon the Gentleman; as
tedious and nauseating, as small Beer and Water, after men have drank well of
the best Wine; Or as the scraps of coarse and plain Country fare, after men
have been filled with a feast of marrow and fat things.

Besides, this exercise of prophesying, which that Gentleman so pleads for,
will hardly find any convenient time, or temper in Christians minds, on the
Lords Day, either among or after the public duties of the Ministry; It must
needs seem, as unseasonable, flat, and tedious, Cavenda vel maxim in sacris,
ne sit satietus; Ne minimum devorando, fastidiosa sit regurgitatio cibi. Cui
digerendo vacare debes, ut salubriter nutriare, Greg. (...), Cl. 41. (...). 6.
Solonis dict (...). Naz. Instantur potius ad morbos and vanitatem, quam
superfluis ferculis nutriuntur ad sanitatem and vires. Ber. Amarat nimietas
quod poterat condire mensura. Chrysostom. p. 125. Pro. 27.7. The full soul
loathes the Honey comb. Mal. 2.7. Heb. 13.7.
as all superfluities and excesses in matter of Religion easily do, when they
border never so little upon the Nimiety or too much: It is great wisdom to keep
people short from a surfeit of holy things; and to leave them with appetites,
and give vacancy for digestion, rather than to cram and cloy them with matters
either of superfluity, or curiosity; when indeed men do scarce with
cheerfulness and intention bear the holy duties of clear divine use, and most
absolute necessity; In all which, common people, by this super-addition of a
prophesying exercise on the Lords Day, will be but hindered from that profitable
Meditation, and careful remembrance, of what they have already plentifully
heard from the Minister, whose lips ought to preserve knowledge, and on which
the people ought to wait, as those that must give account of their souls.

It will then be neither convenient nor useful (as it is not necessary,) to
bring up Prophesying thus in the rear of preaching, as to the common peoples
capacities or occasions; yea, rather it will be to the injury and hindrance
both of Minister, and godly people, on the Lords day, unless you be sure to
provide the people seldom any Minister; and none constantly resident; or else
such weak and short-winded Preachers, that they may be sure to give time and
room enough to these eager Prophets, and to be only as foyls to set off their
fresh and more glistring gifts; or, as an antepast of coarser meats, to whet on
the appetite for that more delicate fare, which these prophets will pretend to
bring forth; we see already many of them stickle for the Pulpits, and are smart
rivals against the Ablest Ministers, whom either small maintenance, or some
factious and ungrateful people have almost quite dis-spirited; Upon whom the
Cryers up, and admirers of these new prophetic gifts look, but as the forlorn
hope, which is to make way all this while for the main body of those gifted
prophets; Many of whom have so great an activity and confidence joined with
their weakness, Ignorantiae and imbecilitati proxima est Temeritas.
that they had need be very well-disciplined, and kept carefully in their due
ranks and posts, or else they will soon rout all order, and honor of Religion
in this or any Church; Notwithstanding all the good hopes, all the soft
bespeakings of esteem, and gentle insinuations for their acceptan for made by
that Charitable writer, who has so largely pleaded ce, them, at the common
peoples bar; And who merited indeed, to have bestowed his pains so publicly,
upon a subject that had a better title in the Scripture, and the Church, than
this of peoples prophesying seems to have.

Besides this, (which I have alleged for inconvenient, superfluous, and so far
hurtful, as it is inconsistent with the ministers and peoples duty on the
Lords day; Tot erunt venena quot intenia, tot pernicies quot and s^ecies, to:
dolores quot colores, as Tertul. begins his Scorpiacum against the vanities and
varietiys of the Gnostics, who pretended to know more, and be more perfect
than the Apostles. Arelius flagitio corrupit artem, Deas dilect^u^ imagine
pingens. Plin. l. 35. 10.
) That Gentleman cannot but consider, how many childish triflings in
discourses, how many trivial skirmishes in disputes, how many captious
bickerings in words, how many uncomly thwartings are prone to arise (as in
Country cudgell-playing) among the vulgar, be they never so godly; if you put
them one pin above their pitch, they either crack or sound like strings
over-strained, harshly and out of tune; although they may have good gifts yet
as Arelius a Painter in Julius Caesar's time, who had good skill, in this
corrupted his art, that when he was to paint any Goddess, he always made them
like some of his Mistrisses; so these are prone to adorn by their gifts, some
error or odd opinion, and set it forth as a divine truth, and rare doctrine.
Nor can you avoid (besides erroneous and fond opinions) envyings, evil
surmisings, jealousies, unsatisfiedness, and factious bandings among the
people, whose minds will soon be divided; some liking, others disliking; some
admiring, others despising; some attending, others absenting from this unwonted
uncouth exercise of Prophesying, which thus confused and abased will soon
appear to judicious and sober Christians, a tedious and useless business (like
Fiddlers always tuning, and never playing any good lesson) and no way fit for a
Sabbath-dayes sanctification; when once the Country gaping, or the gloss and
novelty of it is faded.

So then, if the Guardian of the peoples Liberty, and privilege in Prophesying,
can find any other time on the week-dayes, Of peoples prophesying on the week
days.
wherein to set up this exercise of Laymens prophesying, (that so people may
not at all times come short of that, which he calls their duty;) He must be
sure to provide Prophets of some competent gifts, besides their discretion,
else he will have much ado to persuade people, that it is their duty to
neglect their weekly occasions, and to lose both their time and labor in
attending rusticall impertinencies, and ignorant triflings in religion, which
(of all things) should by wise men be avoided among the vulgar, whose
affections like the poor woman's wort is often very hot in the point of Zeal, when
it is very small in point of judgment, And is prone to run out from
familiarity to contempt, from contempt, to downright profaneness and Atheism in
matters of Religion, when made cheap and vulgar: If he can indeed, furnish out
men, or women, (...). Synes. ep. 142. ex Lyside Pythagoreo. Contempt of
Religion rises from making holy things too trivial and common.
(for they prophesied too 1 Cor. 11.15.) of such prophetic gifts, as are
worthy, to be esteemed and encouraged by sober and judicious Christians, I
shall promise him that I more willingly, and more constantly will be their
auditor, (at convenient times and places,) when I hear they do, what becomes
wise, humble, serious and modest Christians, than most of these pretenders to
be such gifted men, and to have such prophetic spirits, are hearers of the
true Ministers of this Church, be they never so able, either on the Lords day,
or on any weekday Lecture; For, the first way, that many make to bring in
their Lay-prophets, and gifts, is with their feet, trampling, as it were, upon
the best Ministers, and their faithfullest pains, while they scorn to step out
of doors to hear them, either Praying or Preaching, which pride and negligence,
are not the least of those virtues, which recommend those Prophets.

To be plain, the truth is, so much bran, filth, and dross of pride,
popularity, schism, malipertness, and contempt of all men, that differ in any
way form or opinion from them, and (of all Ministers above all) do hitherto
generally appear in the face and manners of many of those (who more affect the
name of gifted men and Prophets, than ever the Pharisees did the title and name
of Rabbi, Mat. 23.7.
) that most sober and wise Christians suspect, they will hardly ever make such
Loaves, as may be fit for Shewbread, to be set up in any public place of Gods
house and Sanctuary; If that Gentleman's piety, which seems tempered with much
ingenuity, can sift or boult out any good meal, or finer flowr, that so they
may be decent for Gods service, and the Churches use in any public way, I
know no man will hinder him from baking, making, and distributing his bread:
But let them take heed, lest the Corn being ground in such a new beaten mill,
it prove not full of grit and gravel; which has more offense, than either
profit or pleasure in eating of it.

13. Of the private exercise of Christians gifts that are truly good.
For the private Exercise of his Prophets gifts (which will now serve the turn)
no man ever spoke against it, further than it frequently carried it self
unseemly, by neglect, separation, boasting against, contempt and opposition of
far abler gifts in the public Ministry, often undermining and shaking those
truths, that ord^r, and holy way of life, wherein the peace of the Church, and
the honor of true Religion consisted; And even in this I conceive I have
showed to humble Christians a more excellent way; Namely, in using the learned
helps of other men's labors; which are in every kind well composed; rather than
to please themselves merely in the barrenness and rawness of their own
inventions, which yet they may add too, if need be, that so they may not seem
to say nothing of themselves, or be forced to break for want of vent: If these
so cried up gifted men, be found meet to be made public teachers in the
Church, under the name of Prophets; why may they not be ordained Ministers, in
a just and due way? There is like to be want enough of men of any competent
parts, in the great decay and discouragement of such as are very learned and
most able: If they are not fit for all offices of the Ministry, I wonder how
they can have confidence enough to be public Teachers in any kind; which work
requires greater abilities and equal authority to any other holy Office; if
they have any thing in them of modest and humble Christians, sure they would be
more swift to hear, James 1.19: Tutior est in audiend^ quam loquendo celeritas.
Non tam facile aures ac labra impingunt. Male audiendo solus ipse laberis; male
loquendo and alios tecum in ruinam pertrahis. Pelarg. Tenuitatis sua maxim
conscii, maxima and mendacissima solent polliceri. Immodica enim ostentatione
lev^men aliquod, remedium, and quasi patrocinium, aliorum credulitatem
prop^iae, mendicitati quaerunt. Erasmus. Mendacia mendicabula.
and slow to teach, as St. James advises.

As for those Histrionick Players, and vaporing Preachers (who with a
Theatricall impudence in many places, seek to fill the world, with mere noise
and clamor; crying down all the ancient Ministry, as Antichristian, and the
Ministers as no way called, sent, or authorized by God or the Church, turning
all either into spiritual, or new prophetic gifts, to which they highly
pretend) certainly, their vanity can move wise Christians no more than those
cheats and wanderers do, who swear, they have found out, and can sell you the
true Elixar, the Philosophers stone, which will turn baser metals into gold,
while yet (poor men) their rags, sords and beggary, sufficiently confutes
their rare skill, proclaiming to all, but fools, their lying and proud beggary,
which more needs another charity, than is any way able to relieve any man's
necossities.

If this Gentleman be in good earnest, for a duty and office of prophesying,
(besides, and not against, the order of the Ministry) let him study how to
restore to us the real and useful gifts of primitive Prophets, Of the
primitive prophetic gifts in the Church.
which may serve worthily to demonstrate beyond what is already done by
excellent Writers, the true sense of the Scriptures, as to the great mysteries
of Jesus Christ the Messiah; God forbid such should not have a primitive use,
and esteem in the Church: But let us not be abused with such triflers, as shall
either darken what others have well explaned, or shall only produce old
protrite and stolen notions of other men's works, as if these were the rare and
new fruits of their own private prophetic gifts; Possibly (with this
Gentleman's good leave) the Church of Christ, neither has now, nor needs, any
such prophetic gifts, as were primitive, and may truly be so called; No more
than it does tongues, miracles, Chrysostom. orat. 88. Gives reasons why Miracles
are now ceased in the Church. So Isid. Pel. l. 4. Ep. 8. Rev. 2.
and healings, which it had, and wanted too in those first times and
dispensations, when the Gospel of Christ was strange and new to the world, and
to the Churches which were but newly planted or in planting; which now it is
not, specially in England, after the Church has enjoyed those plentiful
diffusions of Evangelicall light from Christ and the Stars in his right hand,
for many hundred of years; so that knowledge has abounded, as the waters of
the Sea. It is very probable the Churches in ages succeeding the Apostles, gave
over the form of the exercise of prophesying, when once they saw the ((...)) or
special gift ceased; I remember no mention of this Prophesying among the
public officers duties or privileges of the Church; No Council, no Father,
that I find, regulates it, or reckons upon it; nor does this Gentleman produce
any one testimony for it, out of the Churches after-practice in Ecclesiastic
Histories and ancient Records, which may best distinguish for us, Tacito omnium
consensu per desuetudinem abrogantur. Blond.
what things were of temporary, what of perpetual use in the Church. It is
evident that all things that were primitive and occasional, are not therefore
to be made perpetual, or after long cessation, to be restored; many things
used in the infancy and minority of some, or all Churches, have soon after been
disposed, as the collections on the first day, Those collections for the poor
on the Lords day, Cyp. calls Gazophylacium, and Corbona. de Eleemos. And St.
Chrysostom: endeavored to restore them in Constantinople. See Bero. Ann. Anno
Christi 44. In Tertul. time Christians abstained from blood. Nec animalium
sanguinem in esculentis habemus. Apol. c. 9. yet in St. Austins time they did
not abstain from blood, or things strangled. Aust. cont. Faust. l. 3. c. 13
Mat. 2.20.
1 Cor. 16. So the (...), the Agapae, or love feasts, 1 Cor. 11.20. were by

the Holy Kisses, or salutings, Romans 16.16. 1 These. 5.26. The common stock of
goods, Acts 4.32. publicly dedicated to the relief of the Church; in which the
poorest believer had as much interest in what was given, though they
contributed nothing, as he that gave most of his estate. So the anointing of
the sick, James 5.14. So the Celebration of the Lords Supper every Lords day.
The peoples Amen, 1 Cor. 14.16. which Jerome says, was in his time, as a Clap
of Thunder, such consent, lowdness and alacrity was in that voice of Christian
Assemblies. The observation of the Jewish Sabbath, with the first day of the
week; The abstinence from blood and things strangled, and the like.

Nothing is more ridiculous in Religion, than (as some fond or fraudulent
Papists do their exercisings and shows of daily Miracles) to continue the
ordinary use of all those things in the Church, which we read were practiced in
Primitive times, upon some extraordinary account, either of necessity or
charity, or special gifts, then only conferred; Which, when they were at the
highest tide among professors, yet were never wont to ouerflow the constant
banks of the divinely established calling of the Ministry, but still were kept
within those modest, holy, and humble bounds, which became the Christian
flocks, toward those Guides, and Pastors, which were to be constantly over them
in the Lord, with whom Christ promised to be, as by his Authority and blessing,
so by his Spirit and assisting gifts, to the end of the world.

As for this Gentleman, whose devotion and charity has raised him to so good
hope and expectation, of finding or making fit Prophets among the common
people; truly, if he can bring forth any Gentlemen, either Lawyers or others,
of so pregnant parts, so ready in Scriptures, and of so good utterance, as in
him appears; together with so much gravity, candor, and equanimity, as (for the
most part) he expresses to the Ministry, as a peculiar Calling, and divinely
instituted office, such Prophets will be so far welcome, as they shall be
useful to the Church. Both Ministers and others wou^d be g^ad to see the Inns
of Court or Chancery come in (like Zilpah and Bilhad) to supply the feared
barrenness and decays of Rachel and Leah, Genesis 30.

acceptable wonder to all true Christians and Ministers, to see such Zenasses, 2 Timothy 4.10.

world, to follow after St. Paul, than once it was to see Saul also among the

inimicum, ac mobilem.
Men that can write and (I presume) speak too, after so serious and Spiritual a
way, as that Author endeavors, may merit as much freedom, and public
encouragement, as others vainly affect, and insolently usurp, under the
pretense of their prophesying gifts; when indeed they are for the most part but
mere pratings, very weeds and trash, the soyland load, which may rend this
Gentleman's net; but they are not those good fish, which he seeks to catch, not
so much (it seems) for the Churches necessities, (which the constant Ministry
may well, as it ought to supply (as he confesses,) but for its Lenten dainties
and varieties, which blessed be God are not hitherto much wanted in any Church,
and least of all in this, which has hitherto enjoyed those Manna and Quails,
which the Lord has from heaven plentifully poured round about its tents, by
the care and pains of the able, orderly and duly Ordained Ministers; If some
places in this Church have wanted of that large provision, yet others have
gathered so abundantly, Numb. 11.20. Satietas omnis sibi ipsi contumeliosa.
Aust.
and fed so excessively, that, while they murmur, they surfeit; while they
complain, their food comes out of their nostrils, as sometimes theirs did among
the ungrateful and wanton Jews.

These concessions then, of all able and true Ministers, 14. Answer to the
Aspersions of pertinacy and superstition cast upon the Ministers in that book.
being so liberal and friendly to all private uses, and to all gifts which are
really fit to be public, I cannot tell what that great and dangerous pertinacy
is, with which that Gentleman (toward the end of his book) p. 78. charges so
gravely, and threatens so severely the Preachers in England; as if all the fire
of Gods and man's wrath, which has fallen on them, in these times, has not made
them so much, as willing to part with, and be purged from their Babylonish
superstitions, their popish opinions and practices; which (says he) they hold
as fast, as their right hands, and right eyes.

Pel. l. 2.
and must ever own our selves Christ's Ministers; And wherein this Gentleman had
done more worthy of himself, if he had given clear and particular instances,
than such general and obscure intimations; which without sufficient proof,
will seem no better, than those odious aspersions, and vulgar calumnies, with
the Anti-ministeriall Levellers, to hide their own deformities, are wont to
cast upon Ministers, and all men, that differ from them, and oppose their
folly, out of principles of higher reason, and sounder religion, than that sort
of people use to be acquainted withal; From the fauls and faylings, it may be,
of some Ministers, but chiefly from the hatred and malice of those men, against
all true Ministers, it is probable this author, may without any great spirit of
prophesying foresee, and thus solemnly (as he does from the Tripos) foretell,
the great sufferings, which Ministers of learning, constancy, and honesty, are
like to undergo, if God did not as well know how to restrain the pride and
power of these men, as he does behold the rage and bitterness of them, against
all true Ministers; Not, because they will not come out of Babylon, as he
phraseth it; but, because they will not so easily return (as many unwary souls
do) to folly, and the principles of all confusion, to the oppression of all
that truth and order, which the wisdom of our pious Progenitors has observed
for 1600. years, and transmitted to us, from the hands of the blessed Apostles,
according to the rules of Scripture, and all religious reason.

But what I beseech you is this sinful obstinacy of the Ministers of England,
Vid. Aug. Ep. 118. ad Jan. contra praefractos illos qui superstitiosa
timiditate consuetudini cujuslibet ecclesia repugnant, quae nec fidei nec bonis

observandae, ut a majoribus tradita sunt. Jeron. ad Licinium. Cavendum est, ne
tempestate contentionis serenitas charitatis obunbiletur. Aust. Ep. 86.
for which this Gentleman has such a Sybilline rapture, and more than a
prophetic horror? Is it because their judgment is constant to the approbation
of that due obedience and legal conformity, to which they formerly with good
conscience subjected, as in matters of extern right and decency in this Church,
wherein they had a liberty common with all Christians, (so far as they opposed
not either sound doctrine in faith or holiness, and morality in manners) to
conform themselves then in the use of them, as now they have liberty not to use
them, while by force and terror they are hindered; They being not of that
nature of things s^cred, for which a Christian is bound to kindle the fires of
Martyrdom, nor of private contention against public Prohibition,

Is he angry, that Preachers do not all suddenly shipwreck their judgments,
learning, and consciences upon every rock of vulgar fury, or fancy? that they
are not presently melted with every popular gloing heat of seeming piety? and
that they run not into every mould, Id vi^^ gravi prudentique dignissimum, non
sacile permutatis nec ad vulgi (...) nutum, ^uramque leviter commuveri. Zanch.
Orat. 1 John 4.1.
which any faction has formed for the advantages perhaps of secular interests?
Is he displeased that they are not taken with, admire or adore every Idol of
fanatic novelty? that they seriously try the modern spirits, whether they be
of God or no, and receive not every spirit? Is he grieved, that men of learned
and sober piety, will not subject the gravity of the Fathers; the wisdom of the
Councils; the acuteness of the Schoolmen; the fidelity of the Ecclesiastic
Historians, together with the excellent learning and acurate judgments of the
best modern Writers and Divines in all reformed Churches; yea, and the
authority of the Scriptures themselves, Prove. 26.23. Burning lip^, and a wicked
heart, are like a potsherd covered with silver dross. Grande hoc and subtle

in their most clear light and concurrent strength; that they will not prostrat
all or any of these, to a company of wretched Pamphlets, fitter for Cooks and
Chandlers shops, than for the reading of judicious and serious Christians; who
have cause to look upon those putrefactions of Pens and wits, only as Moths and
Vermin every where creeping up and down, and hoping (like Ants) only by their
numbers to devour all ancient Authors, and all good literature, that so they
alone may survive, and satisfy the grosser palats of those who never relished
any book so much as a Ballad or a Play, or a Romance, or some Seraphick
raptures and pious nonsense? Is he scandalized, that we count not the diseases
of Christians, health; their putrefactions, perfections; their d^stractious,
raptures; their ravings, reason; their dreams, oracles; baseness, liberty;
their Chaos, comeliness? Is he jealous of us, because we rather study and
profess solid truths, sober piety, good manners, and orderly government, which
only become all true Christians, and Ministers above all? Is it our fault; that
we endeavor to Pray, Preach, Write, what we and others may understand; that we
covet not to be admired, by not being understood; that we aim to do all things
as becomes Men, Christians, and Ministers of the true Church of Christ, not
after the manner of plausible, and easy fondness; which is afraid to offend,
where there is power to hurt; that counts greatness as a badge of goodness, and
success a sign of Sanctity; but rather with all just zeal, courage, and
constancy, beseeming the demonstrations of the truth and Spirit of God, which
never needed more to be asserted as to its divine power, and eternal honor,
than in this pusillanimous and frothy generation of vapourers, who are the
greatest enemies to, and betrayers of our Religion, as Christian, and as
Reformed; whether they be Gogs or Magogs, open or secret; the one, or the many
Antichrists; Papal or popular delusions? We hope this Gentleman is so good
natured, that with all other excellent Christians he will forgive us those
wrongs, by which we have been, and ever shall be piously injurious, and
faithfully offensive, as aiming not to please men, but God.

Wherein then are we the Preachers of the good old way (One and all) meriters
of such fatal terrors, as those words import, which like Apocalyptick
Revelations are dark, but dreadful; portending God knows what sufferings upon
them all? If there be no men more single-hearted, none more open, candid, and
ingenuous, than all good Ministers pray to be, who are no Statists or
Politicians, but able and honest Preachers of the name of the only true God,
and Jesus Christ, whom he has sent, to show Sinners the way of eternal life;
If there be nothing more necessary, more useful, less offensive, or
burdensome, to any wise, sober, and godly minds, than their lives and labors
are; If no men are more modest and moderate, in all their desires and designs,
than learned, humble and diligent, (which are the unpragmatick) Ministers; what
is the grief? why this complaint, lamentation and burden, which this Gentleman
takes up so prophetically against them, both as to their sin, and their
suffering? unless men be vexed, that any worthy men are duly made Ministers, or
that Ministers are but men; unless it offend, that they have food and raiment,
which most of them dearly earn, and hardly get; unless they are impatient, as
the Wolf was with the Lamb, that we breath in the same common air, or see the
same Sun, or tread on the same Earth, or drink of the same stream; 1 King.
18.17.
the troubling of which, is by the troublers of it unjustly imputed to their
innocence; who must therefore be accused, because violence has a mind to
destroy them; What is the error? what the heresy? what the superstition? what
the Popish opinion or practice, which any of us Ministers so resolutely
maintain?

Sure this Gentleman is not to be thought of so low a form of foundlings, and
novices, who suspect and dread every thing as Popish, which we hold, Profracta
est illa and superstitiosa timiditas, quae a bonis abhorret quibus abutuntur
mali. Aust.
or act in common with the Pope or Papists; wholly to recede from any thing
common with them, must divest us, not only of the main truths, duties, virtues,
and grounds of our Religion as Christian; but we must cast off all, or most
part of that, which denominates us either rational or humane, both as to the
nature and society of men: But, if we obstinatly retain any thing, either for
opinion or practice, which may truly be branded with the mark of the Beast, as
either erroneous or superstitious, beyond the bounds of Christian truth, or
liberty, or decency: If either any general Council, or any Synod of this
Church, since it were reformed; or any Parliament, Qualis affectatio in

and civil Convention of the Estates of this Nation have condemned what we
teach, or practice, or opine; If any wise and learned man, not apparently
engaged in faction or schism, against the public Constitution both in Church
and State, did ever so much as accuse or convict us of any such crimes;
Misericorditer plectitur qui ad emendationem ducitur. Aust.
In Gods name let us suffer what He thinks fit. If we have deserved it from
men, it will be a mercy to be punished, and amended by them; If we have not, it
will be an honor and crown to us, above all men, to suffer for the testimony
of Jesus Christ, the honor of our function, and this Church, from
unreasonable, and ungrateful men, who use Ministers as their Oxen, 1 Cor. 9.9.
(but not in the Apostles, or Gods sense,) first exhausting and tyring them at
hard labor, and then they destroy and devour them.

The appeal of all true and faithful Ministers, as to their integrity, far
from this superstition charged on them.
But to all excellent and impartial Christians, we may, and do as in the
presence of God appeal;Is not this in some men's sense and censure, the sin of
the ablest and best Preachers (both for learning, piety and constancy) that
they do not so easily yield to, or applaud a Military or Mechanic religion?
that they are sorry to see so goodly a part of the Catholic Church, so stately
a pillar of Gods house, as the Church of England lately was, so every day
hewing in pieces, and mouldring to nothing, for want of due order and
government, or seasonable and fit repairings? Is not this the Crime, that no
learned and worthy Minister can own either the swords Sovereignty, or the
peoples Liberty, to be the grand Arbitrators of piety, the disposers of men's
consciences, the Dictators of all Christianity, the interpreters of all
Scriptures, the Determiners of all Controversies; and this so absolute, as
admits no Conference with, nor endeavoring to convince, either Ministers or
others, who are of different judgments? Is it not their trespass, that true
Ministers know too much? that they see too clearly? that they examine things
too strictly? that they admit no latitudes of Civil interests, or State
policies, Multis in culpa est ut Socrati Athenis, (...): pictatis, literatura,
omnigenumque virtutu^ eminentia, cujus individua comes est invidia, Melan.
and sinful necessities, as dispensations of Gods Moral Law, and the rules of
both common honesty and true piety? That they stand valiantly (many of them)
and as becomes them, in the gap, against the insinuations and invasions of
those infamous heresies, those received errors, those vile and putred
novelties, those perfect madnesses, those apparent blasphemies, confusions, and
dissolute Liberties, which threaten this reformed Church, with a more sure
inundation, than the Sea does the Low-Countriss, if the banks and dams be not
preserved? Is not this with some men the unpardonable sin of the best
Ministers, that they do not crouch and flatter, and fawn on every plausible
error, on every powerful novelty, every proud fancy, and high imagination?
Veritas nemini blanditur, nem^nem palpat, nullum seducit, a perte omnibus
denunciat, etc. Bern.
that they lick not the sores of any men's consciences, or the pollutions of any
men's hands with servile and adulterate tongues? That they do not cry up, or in
any kind own for the gifts of the Spirit, those passionate, or melancholy, or
cunning and affected motions and extravagancies, which some men: strongly fancy
to themselves, and weakly demonstrate to others; as to any thing like to sound
reason, or Scripture religion? Suidas in (...). Herodes primus ex alienigenis

That they oppose these Bells and Dragons of fanatic Divinity, which the
Authors of them will never be able to advance to any public veneration, or
reception, as spiritual, heavenly, and divine, among sober Christians in
England, while such wise Daniels live; who have neither leisure, nor boldness
so to mock God, and to play with religion; nor until as Ptolomy did to
magnify the Image of Diana, to be ((...)) fallen from heaven, so they deal with
able Ministers; when the best Statuaries had formed an Image of Diana to rare
perfection, the King at one supper destroyed them all by the ruin of the house
where they were, and after produced the Statue as fallen from heaven. Or as Herod
the Idumaean or mungrill Jew did with the ancient Records and Genealogies of
the stems of the Kings, and succession of the Priests, among the Jews, that so
he might by abolishing them, the better bring on his own tide; So must these
Antiministeriall adversaries, first destroy and cancel both common reason in
men's souls, and the whole Canon of the Scriptures, which are the durable
oracles of God, Arti^ci^sa sibi parant Lumina Histriones qua melius (...). ous

for the Churches directions, and all learned interpreters of them: Torches of
private Spirits are ridiculous too be lighted up, while the Sun shines; unless
it be for those who (having some mask or play to act) reproach the Noonday Sun
of to much splendour, and make to themselves and others an artificial Night,
which will better serve their turns: When all light of true reason, and
Scriptures are extinguished in this Church and Nation or much Eclipsed; then,
and not before, will honest-hearted Christians believe, that they have no need
of true Ministers; or that those, they have hitherto had, have not been worthy
the name of reformed; or have pertinaciously retained any such Popish opinions,
or superstitions, as are inconsistent with true piety.

And in this thing let the Lord deal with us, according to the clearness of our
hands, and the uprightness of our hearts in his sight, either to deliver us
into, or redeem us out of the hands of violent and unreasonable men; whose very
mercies have proved cruel to poor Ministers; whose pious constancy is the
greatest thorn in some men's sides. But if our ways please God he can make our
very enemies at peace with us. (...). Is. Pel.
Prove. 16.7.

Wholly to remove the ancient Ministry, as some men aim, under pretense of
bringing up a new nursery of gifted brethren, and Prophets (which like
under-woods are not so likely to thrive, while Ministers, like goodly Timber
trees grow so high above them and over drop them,) will be a work, fully
completing those sad effects, which disorderly, unordeined, unsent, and
unabled Teachers and false Prophets, have already begun to bring forth in this
Church; And how can it ever be thought or hoped, that they will bring forth
better fruits, either for the truth, honor, or power of the Reformed Religion;
either for the Peace of Church, or State, unless there be a special committee
appointed, for the regulating of Prophets and trial of their gifts? in which
none may be fitter (for learning, piety, and moderation) to be Chayr-man, than
that Author and zealous assert^r of the peoples Liberty and Privilege; Page 3.
who says he is not so much a friend to these new Prophets, as to be an utter
enemy to the function of the old Ministers; though he would have Prophets
planted, yet not Ministers pulled up root and branch; but only pruned from
that, which he calls superstition: wherein his Charity to Ministers may perhaps
make his censorious severity venial. He that so much studies the Reformation
of Ministers, we hope will not bring in such Esopick and deformed Prophets, as
most of those, who have yet appeared, rather to scare men from, than to
instruct good Christians in, true holiness and Religion.

It is evident enough, 15. The vanity and mischief of false and foolish
Prophets.
and too much, to all true reformed Christians, what wide gaps, that generation
of pretended Prophets, and gifted Brethren, have already made, for the easy
inrodes of what is truly Popery, superstition, or mere formality; All sorts
also of corrupt opinions and Heresies; together with Idleness, barrenness,
barbarity, Illiteratness, Ignorance, Atheism, and contempt of all true Reformed
Religion, both in the power, and extern form order and profession of it: Many
men (being prone) have learned easily to make little conscience of hearing,
reverencing, or obeying the word of God, Even from any true Ministers, never so
able and worthy; since they have learned to scorn, make sport of, and laugh at
these novell and pitiful pretenders to Preaching and prophesying, of whose
insufficiency and non-authority to Preach, and administer any holy mysteries in
Christ's name, common people being fully satisfied; they are ready to dispute,
and neglect, even that divine Authority, which is in the calling of true
Ministers.

What little or no good effects the usurpers against, and opposers of the
Ministry of this Church can boast off, with truth, either as to speaking
judiciously, or writing solidly, or walking exactly, so as tends any way to the
advantages of piety, truth, charity, or peace in the Reformed Churches; or to
the honor and happiness of this Nation, either converting, or establishing any
in truth or holiness, I leave to the judgment of all considerate and wise
Christians, whose prayers, sighs, tears, complaints, griefs and fears of future
darkness, are in nothing more exercised, than in the present deplored aspect
and almost desperate State of the Reformed Religion, in many places of
Christendom, and in none more, than what is threatened in this Church of
England: Jer. 6.^.
Fearing lest the shadows of the evening being increased; and those day stars,
which formerly shined in a learned successive and Authoritative Ministry, being
darkened and Eclipsed; the evening Wolves should also increase; Jer. 5.6.
and the Beasts of the Forest multiply upon us; every one seeking for their
prey; whom they may deceive and devour. Such as loathed Manna, were justly
stung soon after with fiery Serpents. Numb. 21.6.

On the other side ask the looser and profaner Spirits, what restrayning power
or converting influence, they feel from the charmings of these new-gifted
exorcists, who undertake in the name of Christ (but indeed in their own name,
and after their own fancies) to call over, and cast out the devils of
ignorance, Atheism, unbelief, profaness, and hypocrisy, which are in men's
hearts or lives; You may hear them with one voice answering, as those did;
Jesus we know, and Paul we know; the learned and duly ordained Ministers, Acts
19.13.15.
in a successive power from Christ, and his holy Apostles, we know, but who are
you; self flatterers, self lovers, self senders, self seekers, self ordeiners;
Merito a Diabolis plectantur, qui a Deo non mittuntur: Aust.
nor is it to be expected, but that at last these Sons of Sheva will find those
evil Spirits in men's hearts, of pride, unbelief, Atheism, enmity against God,
and all true holiness, any whit milder or better natured than those were; who
contemning the bare sound of the Name Jesus, Omnem praeter Dei temn^^
Autoritatem Satanas, nec nomen Jesus syllabarum son^ terret, sed divina illa,
qua armantur potestas, qui in Christi nomine Ministrant. Ieron.
when destitute of the Authority from Jesus; and mocking at the presumption of
those censurers; flew upon them, wounded, and expulsed them: So unsafe, and in
the end so thankless and comfortless an undertaking it is, to attempt this good
work even of casting out devils from men; where there is nothing but a
mock-power; and no real divine Authority to do it. The devils, which felt
torment at Christ's presence, and were subject to the Apostles, whom Christ
sent, falling down like lightning, had the pleasure to beat and baffle those,
who would chain them up, or cast them out, without divine Authority. And no
wonder if these Estrick Birds, Mat. 8.29. Daemones Christi praesentia
cruciantur; ut malefici ad conspectum judicis: Nondum enim judicis sententia
daemnatos, propria condemnat and torquet conscientia. Pelarg.
who set forth their soft and gay feathers, having but little bodies and less
brains, by wandering from their Nests (their shops, and looms, and flayls, and
mills, (the honest stations, and no way despicable callings, wherein God and
man have set them; and from which they have no sufficient call either from God
or man to moove them) no wonder (I say) if they fall themselves, and lead
others into many snares and diverse temptations; which they can hardly avoid,
being (in good earnest,) most of them very blind leaders of the blind.
Imagining as the Turks do of blind and mad men, that they have special
visions, because they want their eyes; and extraordinary revelations, Facile in
laqueos Diaboli incidunt, qui a via Domini decedunt. Aust.
because they are destitute of common reason. Indeed it is feared that most of
these men's Prophesying and Preaching, is either design to bring all confusion
on these Reformed Churches; or else merely out of wantonness, in jest; as a
kind of recreation and diversion; Mat. 15.14. Caecos a cacis duci; non Major
est in seducentibus arrogantia, quam in seductis insania; in utrisquis summum
periculum; nec minus dolendum quam merito ridendum. Aust. Geminae plerunque

sunt. Tertul. Apol.
but not as any business or matter of duty and conscience; In one thing they
are in good earnest and most serious, that is to carry on their perfect
contempt and malice against all true Ministers.

Who sees not, what weakness it is for sober Christians, 16 The weakness and
sin of Christians to follow delusions and forsake realities.
after so great light of truth has shined so long among them, to imagine, that
such a disorderly Company of people, who for the most part by secret
stimulations of pride, vain glory, envy, covetousness, or some worse Spirit; no
less, than by apparent over-weenings of their small, and at best but very
moderate gifts; not tried or approved by any wise men; but only blown up by the
pitiful applauses of some silly men and women, who have with levity and
unthankfulness forsook their true guides and Pastors; Invidiae stimulis motus
Arrius contra Alex. ep. Alex. haeresin occae pit. Theod. hist. l. 1. c. 2. 2 Timothy 4.3.
and not enduring sound doctrine, and holy order, deserve for their itching
ears to be condemned, to follow such heaps of Teachers, ever learning, and
never coming to a sound and settled knowledge of the Truth? who sees not (I
say) what sin it is, to follow, countenance or encourage such dangerous and
disorderly seducers, and what weakness and mere folly it is, to imagine, that
such, as neither have skill to handle trowell or sword, should either build or
defend our Jerusalem? When they daily pull down better work, than they can
erect; And, what they seem to build, as of such unpolished rubbidge, such rude,
Aedificant and aedificantur Haeretici in ruinam. Tertul. Quale potest esse

and rough-hewen stuff, with such intempered mer^ur, that it is as sand without
lime; undigested, unprepared, uneven neither for matter not manner
considerable; without rule, plumbline or level; neither according to Scripture
precept, nor the holy example, and Catholic practice of the Churches of
Christ: So that the gapings, flaws, swellings, lowness, hollowness, uneveness,
crookedness and weakness, (together with the daily mouldrings of their Childish
structures) show, what wise builders they are; and how fit to be made public
Architects, or Master Builders in this Church. Over whose Walls the crafty
malice of Jesuitick Foxes, and any other enemies, will easily go, and break
them down, Neh. 4.3.
when ever they pass: which makes many men suspect, that these Lay Preachers,

confound and destroy the Reformed Religion in these British Churches, and all
those who study to preserve it. Which they only can, with any show of reason,
effectually do (by Gods blessing) who are workmen, that for their Authority and
approved skill, as well as their good will and readiness to build, need not to
be ashamed. 2 Timothy 2.15.
Of whose real sufficiencies, these new bunglers are most impatient hearers
and perfect haters; because from those Ministers exactness, these men's bungling
receives the severest reproaches and justest oppositions.

A man may as well hope, that hogs by their rootings, and moles by their
castings, will Plow and till his ground, as that such Arbitrary, Casual, and
contingent forwardness; or such inordinate activities of poor, but proudly
gifted men, will any way help on the great work of Christian Religion, the
propagating of the Gospel, or the Reformation of hearts or Churches; which
require indeed the greatest competency and compleatness, both for gifts,
learning, and due Authority, that can be had, both for the Majesty of Religion,
and for the defense of the truth; as also for the binding to diligence and
exactness the conscience of the Ministers; no less, than for the satisfaction
of other men's consciences, in point of the validity of Sacraments, and other
holy Ministrations; which have not any Physical or natural virtue, but a
mystical and Religious only, which depends upon the relation they have to the
word and Spirit of the holy Institutor and Commander Jesus Christ. So that it
is indeed a very strange bewitchedness, and depravedness in many men's
appetites, that they should so cry up those mush-room Prophets and Teachers;
who need more sauce to make them safe or savory, than their bodies are worth;
(who are self-planted, soon started up in one night;) as if they were beyond
all those former Goodly plants, for beauty, sweetness and wholesomness; which
much study, care, learning, pains and prayers have planted in the Church: Or
that Christians should so far flatter themselves that the soil here in England,
since it was watered with civil blood, is so well natured and fruitful, that
there needs no such care and culture as was anciently used in the Garden of
God, either in setting, watering, preparing, or transplanting those trees of
the Ministry, which should be full of life; Rev. 22.2. Supers^minationes
satanae.
whose leaves should be for the healing, as well as their fruits for the
nourishing of men's souls. So confident the devil seems to be of the giddiness,
folly, negligence, and simplicity of these times, that he stirs up the very
thistles. (the most useless and most offensive burdens of the earth, which the
foot of every vile beast is ready to crush and trample upon) to challenge and
contemn the Cedars of Lebanon; 2 Kings. 14.9.
And he would fain persuade reformed Christians, to cut down and stub up those
goodly trees of the Lord, which are tall, strait, and full of sap, as cumbring
the ground; that those sharp and sorry shrubs, those dry and sapless kexes, may
have the more room, and thrive the better; pretending that they will at easier
rates and with less pains supply all the Churches occasions; when the Lord
knows, and all excellent Christians see, by sad experience, that they are so
far from that length, strength and straitness required in the beams and pillars
of the Temple; that their crooked and knotty shortness, will scarce afford a
pin, on which to hang the least vessel of the Sanctuary.

Excellent Christians, I protest before the Lord, that I write not thus, out of
any desire to grieve, quench, or exasperate any man's Spirit, 17. No design in
the Author to grieve any good man's Spirit, or discourage his gifts; 1 John 4.1.
in whom the wise and sanctifying graces, or useful gifts of Gods Spirit do
dwell in the least measure, with truth and humility; but only in the way of
trying the gifts and Spirits, whether they be of God or no; if they be found,
by the word of God, to be proud, foolish, evil, unclean, unruly; refusing to
be bound with any bonds of good order and government, (such, as seems to have
possessed some in this Church, who seek to bewitch others and to trouble all,)
God forbid we should not all of us strive, by fasting, prayer preaching,
writing, and all just rebukes of them, to cast them out, Luke 9.42.
notwithstanding their cryings, tearings, and foamings.

It is far (I hope) from my Soul by any envy or undervaluing of any good
Christians to damp the Spirit of Christ in them; I would have every one study
to improove the talents he has; and to be employed according to his real
improovement; of which no man being naturally proud and self flatterers is fit
to be judge himself, but ought to be subject to the trial and judgment of
others; both as to that light and heat, knowledge and zeal, gifts and graces
which any may pretend to, and wherein they may be really useful to the
public, or any community of Christians; whose edifying in faith and love we
have all cause, both in conscience and prudence daily to nourish and increase
in Gods way; which is an orderly, peaceable, and blessed way; wherein only
either private Christians or Church societies can hope to thrive and flourish:
Number. 11.29.
I wish with Moses all the Lords people were Prophets; Both able to give an
account of their knowledge in the mysteries of Christ, and also to help on, in
an orderly way, (as every wheel or pin does in the motions of a watch) the
great and weighty work of saving souls, which is the main end of the Ministers
calling and pains. Better we Ministers be despised, than the Spirit of Christ
in any gracious heart be justly grieved; or any good work of God in the Church
hindered.

But we are well assured, by good experience, that none would be less
despisers, or more encouragers, lovers, and zealous preservers of the true
Evangelicall Ministry, and its divine Authority, than such men who have graces,
with their gifts, and are both able and humble; none are more slow to speak to
others in the name of Christ, James 1.19.
than they, who cannot hear others Preaching with due abilities and authority,
without fear and trembling, as reverencing God, and the Lord Jesus Christ in
their Ministers. There is no danger of able parts, where there are humble and
honest hearts; no more, than we need fear the strength of any part in the body,
will hurt, or offend the whole body, or disorder and violate any other Member,
which is above it in place, in honor and in operation or function. Reason
teaches us, that the ability or strength of any part, in its place and
proportion, does not make it usurp the place, or execute the Office of any
other nobler part: (...). Arist.
The measure of every part is the beauty and safety of the whole; which cannot
in natural, and ought not in Religious Bodies (which are Churches) be fitly
disposed, but only in such a way, as God has appointed for the daily forming,
building and well-ordering of his Church, by such wisdom and Authority, as
Christ established in it; Of which the Apostles and the Churches after them
give us most evident testimony. But to avoid destructive delusions.


But we must not be deluded either with the devils fulgurations and flashes, or
his transfigurations and disguises; We must not forsake or stop up Gods
fountains of living waters, by digging the devils ditches, Luke 10.18. I saw
Satan fall like l^ghtning from Heaven. 2 Cor. 11.14. Satan himself is
transformed into an Angel o^ l ght. I a. 1.13. Eccl. 5.1.
and wells, which hold no water; nay we may not wash our hands at the Devils
Cistern, to fit them for Gods service; Nor, may we take water from his
troubled, muddy and poisonous streams, to water the plants of Christ's Church;
We may not take strange fire from Satan's Altar to kindle the sacrifices of God:
What need we cut off Dogs necks, and offer swins blood, when we have so many
clean beasts, which are appointed for acceptable services? that we shall not
need any such vain oblations, which are but the sacrifices of fools, who
consider not that they do evil, nor look to their feet, when they go to the
house of God; being as ready to stumble and fall, and discover their nakedness
and shame, as they are forward to ascend to the altar of the Lord, upon the
steps of pride and presumption, Exodus 20.26.
which were forbidden to be made; The humble heart being always most welcome to
God; while others in vain arrogate to themselves power to perform those things
which are not required at their hands. Lev. 10.3.
God has said, he will be sanctified of all these, who come nigh to him in his
public service; which is done not only by that inward sanctification of the
heart, by faith, fear, and reverence toward God, but also by that exact
observation of such rules of order, power and Authority, which he has set (who
alone could do it) in the public way of his worship and service before the
Sons of men.

We must not be such Children in understanding, as to allow all to be gold
which glisters, when it will not endure the Touchstone of Gods word, Cai^itae
Judae ^r^di^or^ Evangelium o^^entabant, Ophitae angelum in omni imunditie
assistentem dicebant and invocabant. Hanc esse perfectione^ aiebant sine
tremore in tales abire operationes quas ne, nominare fas est. Iren. l. 1. c.
35. Nulla enoris secta jam contra Christi veritate^ nisi nomine cooperta
Christia^^ ad pugnandum p^^silire audet. Aust. Ep. 56.
or the probation of the Churches judgment: We may not easily think, that Gods
Spirit, in any private men, runs counter to that holy order and clear
Institution, which the undoubted Spirit of God has clearly set forth in the
Scriptures, and which the Church in all ages has observed in the way of an
ordained authoritative Ministry: All other, or later inventions may well be
suspected to be but Satan's stratagems, and devices. There may be so many
vermin crawling in a dead body, as may make it seem to live and move, when yet
there is no true Spirit of life, or Soul in it: So it is no wonder, if the
various impulses, wherewith men's secret and corrupt lusts stir them, make some
show, as if diviner gifts and endowments agitated them, When indeed they have
no other ayms or interests, than such, as Judas Iscariot, or Simon Magus might
have; or those after Heretics the Gnostics, Maniches, and Montanists, etc.
Who almost, that had any show of gifts or parts, ever did mischief in the
Church, without great prefacings of holy and good intentions, and pretensious
of gifts and the Spirit of God? There may be gifted Hypocrites, devout devils,
angelized Satan's. Be men's gifts never so commendable, if they want humility in
themselves, Miserrimis and instabilibus fabulis tantam elationem assumpseruat,
ut meliores scipsos reliquis prasumpserunt. Irenae l. 1. c. 35. de Caynitis,
Ophitis, Judaeitis.
and charity to others, which are the beauties of all endowments; if they are
puffed up, seek themselves, walk disorderly, run unexamined, unappointed,
unordained, in scandalous and undue ways, they are nothing, either as to
private comfort in themselves, or public benefit to the Church; The
presumption and disorder of their example does more hurt (as the influence of
some malignant stars in a Constellation) than the light of their gifts can do;
they corrupt more than they either direct, or correct.

If any of these Prophets or gifted men be indeed so able, for the work of the
Ministry, that religion may suffer no detriment by them, and people may have
just cause to esteem them highly for their work sake, God forbid they should
not have the right hand of fellowship, all encouragement from my self, and all
that desire to walk as becomes the Gospel; when they are found, upon just
trial, fit to be solemnly ordained, set apart, and sent forth with due
authority to that holy service, in Gods name let them be sent forth with good
speed. If they disdain this method of Ministerial office and power, which has
been settled by Christ, and continued to this day in his Church (which no wise*
humble, and truly able Christian, can with reason, modesty, or with conscience
justly do) but they will needs obtrude themselves upon the Church, and crowd in
against the true Ministers, they may indeed be, as sounding Brass and tinckling
Cimballs, fit rattles for Children, or for the laboring Moon, or for a Country
Moricedance and May Pole, Nec veritate seneri; nec charitate frugi^eri. Greg.
but they will never be as Aarons Pomegranates and golden Bells; useful
Ornaments to Gods Sanctuary in words or works; or any way becoming the Church
of Jesus Christ; which is as the woman clothed with the Sun, the light of
Truth, and the luster of holy Order; And has the Moon under her feet; Rev. 12.
not only all wordly vanities, and unjust interests, but also all humane
inventions and novelties, which have their continual variations, wainings,
disorders, darknesses and deformities; whereas Divine Institutions are always
glorious by the clear beams of Scripture-precept, and the constant course of
the Churches example: Both which have held their Truth and Authority, in the
blackest nights of persecution, wherein no untried and unordeined intruder, was
ever owned for a true Minister of holy things in any settled and incorrupted
Church of Christ; No more than any man shall be accounted an Officer, or
Soldier in an Army, who has not either listed himself, or received his
Commission. Order is that wholsomest air in which Religion lives best. There is
no less necessity both in Piety and Policy, to preserve the Laws of holy order
and discipline in the Church of Christ on Earth; which have the warrant and
seal of his authority upon them, and are for the preservation of truth, peace,
and honor in the Church; Since we find by all experience of times, and most in
our own, That the pride and presumption of men's gifts and private spirits, are
no less want only active in matters of Religion, than in Civil and Military
affairs.

Now, why any men of piety, or in power, professing the reformed Religion,
should incline either to connive at, or to countenance any courses, which
evidently tend to the shame, contempt, confusion, and extirpation of all true
Religion, (as it stood in the profession of the Church of England, opposite to
the gross errors, superstitions and profaneness of any, that are known and
declared enemies to it) I can see no cause, unless it be a supine negligence in
some, who, as they grow greater, Acts 18.17.
so they are like Gallioes, more careless in matters of Religion, wholly intent
to State interests; as if Statesmen had no souls to save, or no God to judge
them; and were to give no account of that power and advantage they have, as
well as that charge and care which lies upon them to do all good they can to
men's souls under their power; or else, there is some other interest secretly
contrived, and cunningly carried on here, (as by open hostility in other
parts,) amidst the dusk of our civil Commotions and troubles, by those sons of
Edom, Psa. 137.7.
and daughters of Babylon, who have evil will at our Sion, and say of our
Jerusalem, Down with it, down with it, raze it even to the foundations.

Jude 9.
As it was for no good will, that the Devil contended with Michael the
Archangell, about the body of Moses, minding rather to have it Idolized than
Embalmed; No more is it from any honest zeal, or pious principle, that some men
now so earnestly stickle about (and indeed) against the settled office, and
peculiar function of the Ministry; either to have it in common, or none at all,
with any divine authority and commission; whose first Anti-ministeriall
batteries, which seemed to carry some show of Scripture-strength I have
hitherto resisted and repelled, not dashing or opposing Scripture against
Scripture, but clearing its obscurer meaning in some few places, by that most
evident and concurrent Sense which is manifestly held forth in many plain
passages, and has been constantly followed in the Churches of Christ, from the
first settling of Christianity in the world to this day; Sensus Scripturae
expetit ce^^a interpretationis gubernaculum. Tertul. de Pres. Non verba tantum
defendantur sed ratio verbarum constituatur. Id.
As the Spirit of God in the Word cannot contradict it self in the main scope
and design; so where any variation or difference in the letter may seem to be,
It must be wisely reconciled, by discerning the different occasion, reason, or
ground of things; sure we are, the pretended gifts, or dictates of private
spirits may in no sort be set up any way to contradict those testimonies and
demonstrations of the Spirit, which are so evidently shining from the
Scripture, as they are in none more than this of a peculiar function and holy
ordination of the Evangelicall Ministry.

And here I might forbear to add trouble to you O Excellent Christians, or any
readers, by any further enlarging of this Apology, 18. Conclusion, and
Transition.
whereby to vindicate the honor of the divinely Instituted, and
Ecclesiastically derived Ministry of this Church; Since the holy Scripture is
(as I have showed) so wholly, fully, and punctually, for its peculiar
Institution, and its constant succession to the end of the world, (whereto it
is not denied, but private gifts may come in with such assistance, as is
humble, orderly, and edifying, but not as proud, invasive and abolishing; as
Hagar they may do service in Christ's family, but they must not grow insolent
and malipert against Sarah.) What ever can be produced, in a matter of so high
and religious a nature, as the Ministerial office and authority is, beyond
what the Scriptures (the only infallible rule) and the Churches constant
practice (the most credible witness) do assure us, is for the most part but as
childish skirmishings with Reeds and Bulrushes, after combating with Pikes and
Guns; And I find indeed, that all after Cavills of the Anti-ministeriall
faction, arise, not much beyond womanish janglings, presumptuous boastings, and
uncomly bickerings, for the most part; where, not religious reasonings, but
peevish Cavils, and pertinacious Calumnies, like black and ragged regiments
(impatient to see themselves so routed by the Scriptures potent convictions,
and the Churches constant custom) do but rally themselves, as in a case
Perdue, to see what can be done by volleys of railing Rhetoric, and virulent
Calumniatings against the Ministers of the Gospel in this Church; whole
greatest fault is that which the devil finds with the best of men, that they
are as Job, upright; Job. 1. Culp^^^ in (...) to Job^ non invenicus Satanae
malicia, ipsam in^^centiam in crimen, and integritatem in calumnium insidiose

Ieron. ad Eust.
not that there is any just fault to be found with their holy Calling, which
has nothing in it irreligious, or unreasonable; nothing immorall, or
imprudent: nothing, but what is fully agreeing to all order, policy, decency,
as following the best and holiest Examples, uses and customs of the Church,
together with the rules of Divine Institution, and the ends of all true
Religion, the glory of God, and the good of Mankind, both for souls and bodies,
for temporal and eternal welfare, for internal peace of conscience, and
external tranquillity in Civil and Church Societies, both as men and
Christians; All which the Ministerial calling regards, and carries on as its
holy design and work, which no other Calling does; Not Magistrates, or Lawyers,
or Physicians, or Tradesmen, or Soldiers, who do not think themselves to stand
charged in Christ's Name, with the care of men's souls, so as to make it their
business to instruct, direct, and watch over them in the ways of salvation.

And for Ministers persons, such as are truly worthy to be counted such, their
failings will not be found beyond what is incident to common infirmities, and
daily incursions of frailties, inseparable from the best of men in this mortal
pilgrimage; All which, the charity of humble Christians easily conceals, and
willingly excuses, or pardons, when they consider how free and full a pardon of
all sins, is from God by the Ministry, offered to every penitent and believing
sinner: The grief and impotent despite, which the profane, politic, and
pragmatick enemies of the Ministry of this and all reformed Churches are
transported with, arises from the like ground, as was in the hearts of Tobias
and Sanballat, Nehem. 4. Solatiam est malorum bonos Ca pere. Ieron. ut improbi
suo malo delectantur, ita invidi alien^ bon^ terquentur. Amb. (...). Amb.
and that scornful crew, against the Jews, that by their means this Church of
God, as the Temple, is built, repaired, cleansed, reformed; That by their
valiant courage, learned skill, and vigilant Industry, the truth, faith, holy
Ordinances, and good manners of this Reformed Church are asserted, vindicated,
preserved, and restored* from those ruins, rubbige, sords, and demolishings,
by which erroneous, ambitious, covetous, and licentious minds seek to waste,
infest and quite abolish the Reformed Religion, both in England and every where
else.

In order to which grand design, the Anti-ministeriall Adversaries are not
wanting, to bring all manner of railing accusation^, and indign Calumnies
against both the Ministers and Ministry of this Church: Some of which, I think
it a shame for me, by reciting of them, to pollute, either my Pen, or the purer
eyes of those readers, who excel in Civility, as much as those evil Speakers
do, in insolency and scurrility, (...). Mat. 27.34.
both for carriage and language against the best Ministers in England. But it
is no wonder if they give us the gall and vinegar of bitter reproaches to
drink, when they intend shortly to crucify us. All is less than was said, and
done to Christ himself. It is part of our honor and blessing, to have men
speak all manner of evil of us, Mat. 5.11.
if we can but make it appear to be, most falsely and and injuriously, as well
as most indignly and ungratefully: Such manner of speaking becomes no men's
mouths, but those, whose hearts abound with so much malice against the best
Ministers; who ought to be the best of men, and generally are the best of
speakers; In honor to whose many real and excellent gifts (becoming the
dignity of their holy place and function) as also in charity to all others,
chiefly those, who most despise and hate the Ministers of this Church, I shall
endeavor to let all men see in the following part of this Apology, the malice,
futility, and falsity of those evil speakings, wherewith some men please
themselves the more, because they think they please some others, whom they
fancy to have a very evil eye, and an heavy hand toward such Ministers as most
study to please God, and to preserve the Reformed religion in this Church of
Christ.

CAVIL or CALUMNY IV. Against the Ministry of England as Papal and
Antichristian.
THe fourth Cavil or Calumny then wherewith the office and function of the
Ministers of England is battered and defamed, among the credulous, weak, and
vulgar minds, is this; That if there be such a peculiar order and office of the
Ministry established in Scripture by a Divine Institution, and so continued in
the Church by a right Ordination, for some times of Primitive purity, to a holy
succession; yet the present Station, Calling, and Authority of the Ministers of
England is apparently Antichristian, as derived from Episcopal Ordination, and
that descended from the Papal or Roman authority, which was but of late years
abolished, as that of Episcopie they think now is, neither of them seeming to
them to be of Christ's appointment, or according to Scripture-rule and pattern;
So that if it be necessary to have peculiar Ministers by office, it is also
necessary to cast off the former order and standing which is degenerated, and
to begin upon some new account, which shall appear to be nearest to the pattern
of Divine Institution, and primitive practice, how ever it may fail of a
constant succession, for above these 1600. years from Christ; during all which
time, it is evident indeed, that Bishops have had a chief place and influence
in the Ordination of Ministers, and for 1000. the Pope has challenged something
of Supremacy and Jurisdiction in these Western Churches, over all the Clergy,
both Bishops and Presbyters; None of which are fit to serve in Gods house as
Ministers, while they are not cleansed from that leprosy, which they have
contracted from the Pope and Prelates.

Answ. I will first endeavor to take off from the face of our Ministry, this
scandalous visard of the Papal authority, (1) The Papal Usurpation no
prejudice to the true Ministry of England, more than to all other Christian
Institutions,
which scares some people so very much, that they are afraid to meddle with any
thing that ever passed the Popes fingers, except only the lands and revenews of
the Clergy; Having removed this veil or covering, which was sometime over these
Western Churches, we shall easily see the face of the holy Ministry no less
than of other Christian Institutions restored, without any Disfiguration or
Essential change, by any such mask as might sometimes be upon it, through the
policy and folly of many.

It were a very weak and injurious Con^ession, no less prejudicial to the
Reformed Churches, than pleasing to all the Romish party, if the Pope could
persuade us Protestants, and other Christians, to cast quite away, and utterly
abhor what ever the Papal usurpation has abused, or the Romish devotion has
used in matter of Christian religion; Sure then, we must seek for other
Apostles and Saints, other Scriptures and Sacraments, another Gospel and
Messiah, than Jesus Christ, no less than other Bishops and Ministers; For over
all these, the Popes of Rome have spread the skirts of their usurped authority;

their impure mixtures, their corrupt doctrines, and superstitious manners; Who
as far as they are Antichristian, that is, go in any ways contrary to the holy
rule, and humble pattern of Jesus Christ, yet might, yea and ought to sit in the
Temple of God, as all Antichristian spirits indeed do, who cannot properly be,
but where there is a Profession of Christianity: yet it does not follow, that
the Catholic Church, (against which the gates of hell shall not prevail, so
as to extinguish the name of Christ) was either wholly ruined by Antichristian
superstructures; or that the whole fabric of it must be pulled down by us, and
all parts of it made Nehustan, in stead of cleansing, repayring, and reforming,
which is not a novelty of nvention, but a sober restitution of all things in
Religion, to the primitive mode and pattern, which is authorized and ordained
by Christ; Who did no more himself as to the outward restoring of Religion and
worship of God; Chalenging Gods right to his own House of prayer, when
covetousness had made it a den of thieves. The priesthood of old failed not by
reason of the immoralities of the Priests among the Jews; nor did the
Didacticall or Teaching authority cease from Moses his Chair and succession,
because the Scribes and Pharisees (who were men of corrupt doctrine, and
hypocritical manners) sat therein, and taught the Traditions and inventions
of men mixed with the commands of God; No more did, or does the Evangelicall
Ministry and Sacraments cease, by reason of any Papal arrogatings, or other
human additions.

Therefore the wisdom and piety of the learned and godly Reformers of these
Western Churches, especially here in England, contented themselves with casting
out what ever corrupt doctrines, impure mixtures, vain customs, and
superstitious fancies, the Papal vanity and novelty had built upon those
divine and ancient foundations of Christian religion; which were laid by the
Apostles, and Primitive master builders, all over the world; Whose Canon the
Scriptures, together with sound Doctrine, holy Ministry, comely Government,
Sacramental seals, and other Christian duties of prayer, fasting, etc. they
restored with all gravity, moderation and exactness, with due regard both to
the clear sense of Scriptures, and the Catholic practice of Churches,
Conforming of all things, either to the express Precepts and Institutions of
the word of God, or to those general directions, which allow liberty of
Prudence, and difference in matters Circumstantiall; in all which the Primitive
Church had gone before them. Herein they were not so weak and heady, as to be
scandalized with, and insolently to reject all things, that the Papal or
Romish party had both received and retained in religious uses from former and
better times, either as Christians, or Bishops, or prudent men; for so they had
very sillily deprived themselves, and all the Reformed Churches, of all those
Scriptures, Sacraments, holy duties, Order, rites, and good customs, which the
Pope and Romish party had so long used, not as Popes, by any Antichristian
policy, power and pride, but as they were Christians, having received them in a
due succession at first, (though after much depraved) from those holy
Predecessors, which had been Martyrs and Confessors in that famous ancient
Roman Church.

No judicious Protestant or truly reformed Christian, (2) How far necessary and
safe to be separated from the Romanists. Ad quamcunque Ecclesiam veneritis ejus
morem servate, si pati scandalum aut facere nolitis. Aug. Ep. 86. responsum B.
Ambrosii.
whose conscience is guided by Science, and his reforming zeal tempered with
true charity, either does, or ought to recede farther from Communion with the
Roman Church, than he sees that has receded from the rule of Christ, and the
Apostolical Precepts, or binding examples, expressed in the Scriptures, so far
as concerns the true faith, in its Doctrines, Seals, and fruits of good works.
In matters of extern and prudentiall order, every Church has the same liberty
which the Roman had, to use or refuse such ceremonials, as they thought fit,
and to these every good Christian may conform. In many things we necessarily
have communion with the Pope and Papists, as in the nature and reason of men;
In some things we safely may, as in rules and practices, politic, civil,
just, and charitable, as Governors either Secular or Ecclesiastical; In many
things we ought in conscience and religion to have communion with them, so far
as they profess the truths of Christian religion, and hold any fundamentals of
faith; And however they do by mis-interpretation of Scriptures, or any
Antichristian additionals of false doctrines, of impious or superstitious
practices, seem to us rather to overthrow, or bury the good foundations, than
rightly and orderly to build upon them. (for which superstructures and
fallacious consequences we recede from them, and dispute with them;) yet we do
not renounce all they hold, or do in common with us as Christians.

In the Lords Supper. 1 Cor. 11.27. Whosoever shall eat this Bread. 28. So let
him eat of that bread. S^let res quae significat ejus res nomine quam
significat nuncupari: hinc dictum est Petra erat Christus. Aust. Q. 57. in
Levit.
For instance (it being not now a place to dispute them) We cannot own, as the
Catholic sense of Christ, of the Scriptures, or the Primitive fathers, that
sense which they in later times have given of the words in the Sacramental
Consecration of the Lords Supper, by which they raise that strange doctrine of
Transubstantiation, unknown to the first Fathers; And which seems to us 1.
contrary to the way of Gods providence, both in natural, and in religious
things, which changes not the substances and natures of things, but the
relation and use of them, from natural and common, to mystical and holy; 2.
Contrary also to the usual sense of all Scripture phrases, and expressions of
the like nature, where things are mystically related by religious institution,
and so mutually denomin^ted without essential changes; 3. Contrary to the
common principles of right reason, 4. And contrary to the testimony of four
senses, sight, taste, smelling, and hearing, which are the proper organes, by
whose experience and verdict of things sensible, we judge in reason, what their
nature is; 5. Contrary also to the way and end that Christ proposed, to
strengthem a Christian receivers faith; which is not done, by what is more
obscure and harder to be believed than the whole mystery of the Gospel, as
recorded to us in the Scripture: There being nothing less imaginable, than that
Christ gave his Disciples his own very body, each man to eat him whole and
entire, and so ever after, when he was then at table with them, and is now by
an Article of faith believed to be as man in heaven; These and the like strange
fancies of men, which draw after them many great absurdities and
contradictions, both in sense and reason, and the nature of things; being no
way advantageous to the religious use, end, and comfort of the Sacrament, we
reject, together with the consequentiall Idolatry of worshipping the bread: Also
the sacrilege of detaining the Cup of the Lord from the people, we cannot
allow, as being contrary both to the primitive practice of the Church, and to
the express command of Christ in the Institution, which was after also revealed
to St. Paul by Christ himself. Yet still we use and observe the Sacramental
Elements, with the same high estimation and veneration, which pious and purest
antiquity ever did bear to that Sacred mystery; how ever we forbear to use
some of their expressions, whose Oratory occasioned in part the after error,
which mistook that, as spoken of the Bread in its nature, which magnified it
only in the Sacramental use and mystery, which is indeed very high; retaining
both the Elements, words, and holy form, which Christ instituted, and
Christians always used, not so much disputing and determining the manner of
Sacramental union, as endeavoring after those graces, which may make us worthy
Communicants, and real partakers of the Body and B^ood of Jesus Christ, when
we do receive that dreadful, yet most desirable seal of our Faith, which
consigns fuller to us, and confirms in us those comforts, which as sinners we
want, and may have most really and only from Christ; not by eating his flesh in
a bodily and gross way with our mouths; but by receiving him by a true and
lively faith into our souls, as he is set forth to us in the Scriptures to be
God incarnate; the only Savior of the world; of whose merit, death, passion,
body and blood, we are by the same faith, (though in less degrees of strength,)
really partakers, and nourished to eternal life, before we receive him in that
Sacrament of the Lords Supper; yea though we never should have opportunity so
to receive him; which is but the same object received by the same faith, to the
same end, though in a different manner, and with different degrees.

So for Baptism; Baptism.
we retain the substance of that holy Sacrament, as we find it in the
Scriptures, rejecting only those superfluous dresses (of Salt, Spittle, Oil,
Insufflation, and the like) which cumber and deform that duty and Ordinance,
but they do not destroy it, nor do ever any Protestants, that are of any name
or honor for Religion, re-baptise those, who were baptized in the Roman
Church; Council. Laodicenum omits only the Apocal. Apocrypha Books Hieron. in

The Apocryphal additions of the Romish Church to the Canon of the Scriptures,
we reject from being rules of faith (however we approve their excellent morals)
And this we do upon the same grounds, that the Jewish Church of old, and the
Primitive Christian for the most part ever did; yet we retain those books as
oracles of God which we have received with and from the Romish Church, as of
divine inspiration; according to that testimony which both the Jewish and
Christian Churches fidelity, have given us of them.

The e^une, dull, and spiritless, and formal devotions, Prayers in a language
not vulgar. (...). Greg. Nis. de Placilla orat. Funcb. Delinquens soli Deo

34. Chrysol. So Ber. s. 42. Non expedit omnibus omnia in^^tescere quae scimus
de nobis. in Cant.
Liturgies and prayers used by the Romanists, in any tongue unknown to the
most, and with so many vain repetitions, we refuse; yet still we retain the
holy custom of Christians assembling in public, and worshipping God by public
Liturgies, prayers and praises.

In somethings we hold nothing common with them, either in opinion or practice;
as in the profitable fancy of purgatory; the popular fashion of worshipping
Images or adoring God in and by Images; of oblations and prayers for the dead;
of praying to Saints and Angels; of Auricular confession; of dispensing by
Indulgences the merits, or supperogating righteousness of some Christians to
others; Since in these and the like matters, which I only touch, it being not
my work now to handle those controversies which have been so fully discussed by
many learned men of this Church of Engand, whose works praise them; We find no
Scripture ground, either for precept or permission.

So likewise in the ambitious claim of the Popes Infallible judgment; His
universal jurisdiction, and Supreme Authority over all Churches and Councils;
We deny it, as un usurpation gotten by indulgences of some times and Princes;
also by the flatteries, frauds, cruelties, power and policies of several Popes
in their successions; but not grounded on any Law, or right, either humane or
divine; neither by the Institution of God, nor by the consent of all Churches:
Yet we deny not to the Pope such a primacy of place, or priority of order and
precedence as is reasonable and just either in the Roman Diocese as a Bishop;
or in a Council, as Bishop of that famous City.

In like manner for the sacred order and function of the Ministry; we reject
what ever imaginary power or will worship is annexed to the office by humane
superstition; but we approve the ancient form of Commission, and Divine
Authority derived by them to Presbyters and Bishops, for Preaching the word,
celebrating the Sacraments, reconciling penitents, use of the Keys in doctrine,
or jurisdiction and Government; In the Roman Pontifical, The Bishop to be
consecra^ed is charged after many Ceremon^es and pompous modes, with this, as
his office and duty, To judge, to interpret, to consecrate, to confer holy
orders, to offer, to Baptize, and to confirm: after that the Consecrator^
laying the Bible on his shoulder, and their hands on his head, say these words,
Receive the holy Spirit: i. e. the gifts and power to be a Bishop, or chief
Pastor: to teach and rule in the Church. So the Presbyter is by the Bishop
ordeyning and othe^s with him imposing their hands on the head, enjoined, To
offer, to bless, to govern, to Preach and to Baptize, as becomes his place and
Office. Mar. 13.25.
Also of the continued power of Ordination, for a succession of Ministers in
the Church: In all these and the like what ever we find to be spurious issues,
of mere humane invention; of Scripture-less opinions; of groundless traditions,
obtruded, as matters of Religion, upon the consciences of Christians, we use
that just severity, which we think the Apostles and Primitive fathers would
have done, to dash these Babylonish brats against the stones: yet still we
redeem and preserve alive the legitimate succession, the Sons of Sion; the
Israel of God; and justify the Children of true wisdom and of the Heavenly
Jerusalem, that is, the divine and truly religious Institutions, upon Scripture
grounds, although we find them to have been led Captive, and a long time
detained Prisoners by any unrighteousness, policy, superstition, tyranny,
covetousness or ambition, in the Walls and Suburbs of Babylon. Though tares
were sown among the good Seed in the Field of the Church, while men slept, yet
we must not be such wasters, as to destroy the Corn with the weeds; or to
refuse both, because we like not one; Though our Fathers ate sour grapes and
our teeth were an edge, we must not therefore pull all our teeth out of our
heads. Divine institutions are incorruptible; nor can any corruption of men's
minds or matters cease on them, any more than (...). Vt Aurum ^t ge^^a it^ res
Divi^^ non corrump^nt^^; quamvis opprimuntur; non vitiantur natura quum

putrefaction on the Sun beams, when it shines on a Carcass or Dunghill: We may
be corrupted, but holy Ordinances are like God always the same, when restored
to their Primitive Institution, which is their State of Integrity. Riches and
honor are not unwelcom, though they descend to men from unworthy Ancestors;
Nor should Religion so far as its title is good by the word of God, either in
strickt precept and institution, or in prudence joined with piety and decency.
Good pictures will recover the beauty, when the soil is washed off.

In a word, we retain the truth, faith, holy mysteries, Catholic orders,
constant Ministry, and commendable manners, which the later Romanists have
derived and continued from the first famous Church in that place; nor do we
think it either conscience or prudence to deprive our selves of any thing
Divine, though delivered to us by the less pure hands of men; or to cast away
the provision which God sends us, though it be by Ravens; or to Anathematise
all the Romish Church ho^ds of saving Truths, because it has in the Council
of Trent Anathematised some Truths.

The Bishops of Rome were always more cunning, than to abrogate, or cast away
those essentials, the main foundations and pillars of true Christian Religion,
as the word, the Sacraments, the Ministry, and Government of the Church, on
which they knew the vast moles, and over grown superstructure of the
Pontifician pomp, profit, pride, reputation, policy and power, (through the
credulity, Vt in reficiendis domibus sic i^ moribus non destruenda omnia sed
repu^ganda: non diruenda sed res^cienda. Ber. Ep. ad Abb.
of people, and blind devotion of most men, in these Western Churches) was
built and sustained: Nor can any thing more contribute to the Popes depraved
content, or repair his particular interest, in this Western world, than to see,
any so heady, rash, and mad Reformers, as shall resolve to quarrel with, and
to cast quite away, all those things of Christian Religion, which ever passed
through the hands of the Romish Church; or any other never so erroneous and
superstitious; He well knows, how meager a Sceleton, how miserable a shadow
Christian Religion must needs remain to those furious and fanatic Reformers;
(...). Naz. Ep. Eudox^
Being as much reduced to poverty and mere nothing in the very essentials of
Christianity (both for Doctrine, Duties, Sacraments, Scriptures, order, and
manners) as it would be in the matter of maintenance and Church Revenews;
(where some men's covetous and cruel Reformation is resolved, if they may have
their will, to leave nothing to maintain Religion, or its Ministry, but the
mere scraps of arbitrary and grudging contributions;) Such will our Religion
be, if we reject all, that was used by those, who abused many things; and we
must after only adhere to the beggary of Seekers; attending new Instructions
from Heaven, instead of following ancient Christian and Catholic Institutions.

Certainly, Church Reformations 3. Of Church Reformations, with moderation and
charity. (...) Plato. de leg. 3. Nothing is just but what was wisely moderated.
in things Religious, should be carried on with all acurate strictness and
rigor in clear points of saving truths, and in things of divine Institution so
confessed by all; yet also, with much charity, candor, moderation and
discretion toward any Christians in other things; wherein we must differ from
them: Yet no further, than they seem to us to derogate from the truth and word
of God; and so become detrimentall to men's souls. It is a commendable Schism,
which separates the Corn from the chaff, and the Gold from the Dross; neither
retaining both in a confusion, nor casting away both in a passion: In thus
doing all things with meekness of wisdom, Christians may not only be able, upon
sober and judicious grounds from Scripture, and the Catholic consent of the
Fathers, to maintain what they do, as wise Reformers of abuses; but also the
better invite others to embrace, and to approve our ^ust and well-tempered
Reformation; in the unpassionate purity whereof others will the easier see, as
in a smooth and true Glass, their yet remaining spots and deformities.

Reformation of Churches is best done, not by cutting off the head of Religion,
but by taking off those masks and visards which hide its face and beauty: Men
will best see their errors, not by force pulling their eyes out of their heads,
but by fairly taking away the motes or beams of prejudice, error and pertinacy,
which are in their eyes, which hinder them, not from seeing at all, but from
seeing so we l, as we (in truth) think they may, and in charity wish they would.

1 These. 5.21. Plato. (...), moderation is the medium between the excess and
defect: Neither taking nor refusing all, but trying all, and hold^ng the good.
True Reformation free from Schism.
By this shield of moderation and charity, proving all things and retaining what
is good in all, (with our pity and prayers for any Christians, wherein we
think they err, as differing therefore from us, because from the rule which
God has set for his Church in things pertaining to Divine worship:) we justly
defend our selves, in this, and other reformed Churches, (that are of the same
temper and charity in their Reformations) from the sin and scandal of Schism;
when we fairly and freely declare, that we separate no further from the Church
of Rome, or any other particular Church, or Christian man, than we are by the
word of God persuaded, that they separate from Christ's holy rule, and from the
custom and Doctrine of the Catholic Church; whose bounds and marks are the
samenes of divine truths, and the unity of the Spirit, in Charity, which we
retain to all Christians, as far as such, with whom, while we desire such
communion, of true faith, holy order, and obedience, together with love, as
they do with Christ, and all true Christians, we cannot in our own consciences,
nor other men's censures, be esteemed Schismatics, as the Novatians and
Donatists of old were; who so challenged the title of the Church to their
factions, as to exclude all others, and refuse the offers and means of accord.
As Cyprian Ep. 95. and Aust. Ep. 164. tell us.

To which brands of Schism we are then liable only, when we recede, or separate
from visible communion with any Church, without just and weighty cause shown
out of the word; or when we go further from them than there is just cause, and
that too without charity; refusing the good which they have, while we withdraw
from the evil we suspect: Which would be the case of the Church of England in
this point of immoderate Reformation; if we should (as some would have us)
therefore separate from all Scriptures, Sacraments, Ministry, Primitive
Government, and order, because all these were retained, used, and after abused
much, by the Roman Church and Papal party: we are bid to come out of Babylon,
Rev. 18.4. but not to run out of our wits; to act, as Gods people, with
meekness, moderation, and Charity, not with that fierceness, passion and
cruelty which makes us as Sons of Belial, inordinatly run from one Antichrist
to another.

Many Christians in the Roman Church may have in them much of Antichrist in
some kinds, and so (God knows) may many others, in other kinds; either in
Doctrine or manners; in endless innovations, and unsettled confusions; or in
rigor and uncharitableness; All which may betray us, to what we seem most to
abhor in Antichrist; for if nothing have more of Christ, than Charity, nothing
can have more of Antichrist, than that uncharitableness, Uncharitableness is as

which many men nourish for zeal; mistaking a Cockatrice for a Dove; and a fiery
Serpent for a Phoenix. Which may be, as Antichristian in popular furies, as in
papal tyrannies; in confusions as in oppressions. It is strange how some men
cry out against the cruelty of some Papists (which indeed has been very great)
when yet, Qui Christi non est Antichristi est Jeron. Ep. 57. ad Damas.
they have the same Spirit of destruction in their own breast both against the
Papists and others: longing for such a Kingdom of Christ (as they call it) and
such a downfall of Antichrist, which shall consist in War, and Blood, and
Massacres against and among all Christians, which are not of their mind and
side. We think, that in charity we ought not to impute the faults and errors of
every Pope, or Doctor of the Roman side, to all those of that profession; Nor
ought we take those learned men among them always at their worst; finding
there is great difference between what they may hold in the heat of public
disputes, and what they opine and practice in a private way; no^ are their
deathbed tenets always the same, with those of their Chayrs and Pulpits.
Besides, many of the more devout and learned men among them, are now both in
opinions and lives, much more modest holy and Reformed, than some were
heretofore, whose Reformation in judgment or manners, in verity, purity, and
charity we do really congratulate and joy in.

And, for the Body of the common people among the Romanists, many are ignorant
of those disputes, wherein the mistaking is most dangerous; which if they do
hold, yet it is under the persuasion and love of truth, Qui a seductis
parentibuus er^o^em acceperunt, quaerunt autem cauta solicitudine veritatem,
corrigi pa^ati cum invenerint, hi nequaquam sunt inter haereticos deputandi.
Aust. Ep. 162. 1 Cor. 3.12.
retaining still the foundation of Christ Crucified, and hoping for salvation
only by his merits; (as many now profess to do) and living in no known sin; but
striving to lead an holy and charitable life in all things; Charity commands us
to think, that in such, the mercy of God (accepting their sincere love to the
truth, and their unfeigned obedience to what they know,) pardons particular
errors which they know not to be such, and wherein no lust of pride, or
covetousness, etc. either obstructs, or diverts them from the way of Truth;
Though the superstructures may be many of straw and stubble, which shall
perish, yet holding the foundation Christ crurcified in a pure conscience, they
shall be saved in the day of the Lord; Though the vessel be leaky in many
places, yet by great care in steering, and frequent pumping (that is true faith
and repentance) it may keep the soul from Shipwreck and drowning in perdition,
which is embarked in the bottom of Christian Religion, and which steers always
by the compass of conscience, setting all the points of conscience, by the
Chart or rules of Scripture; as near as he can attain by his teachers, or his
own industry.

We are sorry for our necessary differences from the Romanists or others; which
yet our consciences so far command us, as we think our selves enlightened by the
word of God; contrary to which we cannot, and ought not to be forced actually
to conform, or to comply with any men in things Religious: Yet have we no lust
of faction, no delight in separation, no bloody principles, or tenets, against
any Christians of any particular Church; desiring the same charity from them to
us; which may, in lesser differences from each other, yet unite us to Christ,
and to the Catholic Church, as true parts of it, though infirm, or diseased:
This temper we should not despair of in the devouter and humbler Romanists; if
they were not daily enflamed, by politic Spirits and violent Bigots among
them, who will endure no Religion as Christian, which does not kiss the Popes
Pantofle, or hold his stirrup, or submit to that pride, flattery and tyranny,
which some of them have affected; when indeed it ill becomes those, that
challenge a chief place in Christ's Church, to be so vastly different from the
example of the crucified Savior of Christians.

Such talents then as have been once divinely delivered to the Roman (as to all
other Christian Churches,) we have all aright to as believers in private, and
as Christians or Churches in public communion and profession; nor can these
Jewels be so embezeled, by being buried, or abused, but that we may safely take
them up clear, and use them; together with those other which we have obtained,
through the grace and bounty of our Lord and Master Jesus Christ; In whose name
and right, we (as a part of his Catholic Church) received them first, and
enjoy them now, only Reformed, according to what we first received of them;
without any prejudice or diminution to their true and intrinsecall worth (which
is divine) by reason of our fellow servants former, or present idle, imperious,
impure or injurious use of them: We accept and use the holy vessels, which
belong to the temple, and the Lord of the Church, Ezra. 7.
without scruple, when they are graciously restored out of the profane hands of

and divine, as well as the Scriptures, and Sacraments, or other holy
Ministrations, and duties are, when duly restored to their primitive purity,
order, and authority; which go along with their right succession;
notwithstanding they are derived to us through or by the Romish Church, or the
Popes dispensation; yet do they not therefore descend from them, but only from
Christ, the first institutor of his Church, and of this Ministry, with a
perpetual power of succession; Possunt esse and pastores and Lupi alio

Our Lord Jesus Christ, the gracious Spouse of the Church, as of every Soul,
that truly believes and obeys (though with much unbelief and frailty,) disdains
not to own his relation to any Church or Christians, though they are not so
faithful to him; though they lose their first love; yet they may be still his,
by what still remains of soundness and outward profession; Yea and Christ will
vouchsafe to admit us again to the communion and covenant of his love, even
after long wanderings, and unkind absences, when ever we wash our selves, and
return to him, from our disloyal adulteries and pollutions. He does not
utterly divorce any Church, when the substance and essentials of Religion
(which are but in a few things) do remain, notwithstanding the many
meretricious paints, and disguisings, which the wantoness of humane inventions
may have put upon it; thereby disfiguring its Primitive beauty and simplicity.
Man's vanity and arrogance against God or men, does no whit abrogate, either the
right which Christ, or any Church and Christian posterity has to the purity
and power of his gifts and institutions, in the right way of his M^nistry: All
which may remain, with a blessing in the root and Seed; though they be much
pestered, over-dropped, choked, and almost starved by humane additions, which
keep them for some time from their full glory, vigor and extension.

Therefore the learned and godly Reformers of this Christian Church in England,
did not dig any new fountain of Ordination, or ministerial power; as some
Romanists calumniated at first, and were afterward convinced of the contrary,
by Master Masons learned defense of the Ministry of England, as to its right
succession; but they only cleared that, which they saw was divine in the first
broaching or Institution by Christ, and as in the purest derivation by the
Apostles; however in time it became foul by humane feculencies and dregs as it
passed, rightly (though not purely) through the hands of some Bishops and
Presbyters) even to their days; Nor was ever any thing required by the best
Reformed Churches, further to confirm and validate the Authority or power
Ministerial, which any had received, when he was first ordained Presbyter in
the Romish Church, Contaminarunt non sustulerunt Ministerium Ecclesiae. Alsted.
but only this, to renounce, not his Baptism, but his err^rs and former
superstitions; to profess the Reformed Truths of the Gospel, and accordingly
to exercise that Ministerial power, which he had received, truly, as to the
substance, and duly, as to the succession; both as to the Office conferred, and
the persons conferring it. Howsoever the sword of the Ministry had through the
neglect of those, to whom it was committed, been suffered to contract the rust
of superstitions, and to lose much of its beauty and sharpness; yet it was
still that true and same two-edged sword, which came out of the mouth of Jesus
Christ, Rev. 2.12. the first ordeiner of a peculiar settled Ministry in his
Church; Nor may it be broken or cast away, when it has been rightly delivered;
but only, cleared, whetted and furbished, from its rust, bluntness and dullness:
That Pen, which now writes blottingly, might be well made at first, and will
write fair^y again, if once the hairs or blurs, which its neb has contracted,
be but cleared from it: It is still Gods Field and Husbandry with good Wheat in
it, though the enemy has, while men slept, sown many tares; Bishops and
Ministers reformed may be Gods true laborers and appointed Husbandmen, though
they have some time loytered; as the Disciples were Christ's, when their eyes
were so heavy to sleep, that they could not watch with him that one hour of his
most horrid agony. Mat. 26.40.


It were then but a passionate scuffling with mad men, a most impertinent
disputing with unreasonable minds, further to argue about the Popes usurped or
abused Authority in any kind over Churches or Bishops, or holy Ordinances and
Ministry: For which he had as little grounds of Scripture or reason, as these
Anti-Ministeriall Ob^ectors have now, against this Church of England, and the
function of the Ministry in it; against which, these cunning cavillers have not
so much pretense to argue from the Popes usurpation, that our Ministry and
Religion are all Antichristian; as they have both Scripture, Reason, and
Experience, (besides the consent of all Reformed Churches) to conclude them to
be truly Christian; if anger or envy, or covetousness had not blinded their
blood-shotten eyes, they might easily see some of those mighty works, Mat.
11.20.
which have been wrought on men's Sou^s, by the Ministry of England, since the
Reformation; and without this efficacious Ministry, I believe, neither these
Calumniators had been so much Christian, as they pretend, nor so able
spightfully to contend, with shows of Piety, and popular falacies against the
true Ministry of this Church, and the best Ministers, with whose Heifer they
have plowed.

We know well, that not only the reformed Churches, 5. Of the Popes pretended

but even the Gallican and Venetian (which keep communion with the Romish
Church, and Papal party) besides the Greek, Asian, and African Churches, do
generally oppose, and vehemently deny the Popes abusive usurpations, both in
things Ecclesiastical and Secular: And this upon most pregnant grounds; not
only from Scripture, (whence nothing was ever fairly and pertinently urged, as
some places are foully wrested, and yet but little to the Popes advantage) but
also from Caeteri Apostoli par consortium honoris and potestatis acceperunt,

Fathers, and first famous general Councills, make clearly to the Popes
disadvantage, as to any power or jurisdiction in point of divine authority,
which he claims beyond, or above other Bishops and Presbyters; further than the
Roman Diocese first, and the Patriarchate afterward extended; which division
and power for order sake was agreed unto by some general Councils; where other
four Patriarchs of Jerusalem, Antioch, Constantinople, and Alexand^ia, had also
a limited, yet equal power in their respective Dioceses and Provinces, with
the Bishop of Rome.

Nor had the Pope then for the first six hundred years after Christ any
authority, scarce any name in these British Churches, which were undoubtedly
converted by some Apostles or Apostolical men; who left after King Lucius his
time a famous and flourishing succession of Bishops, Presbyters, and
Christians, long before any pretensions of the Pope over these British
Churches: To which the British Bishops in Wales were strangers; nor would they
own at that time, when Austin the Monk came from Gregory the Great; who sent
hither more out of Christian charity than any Authority to convert the Saxons,
who had by war and barbarity quite extinguished Christianity with all Bishops
and Ministers out of England, and had forced the former holy Bishops and
Ministers to fly into Wales, Ireland, and Scotland; from whence afterward in a
grateful vicissitude the English (replanted) Churches received (for the most
part) both their Conversion and establishment by a Succession of rightly
Ordained Bishops and Presbyters; for Austin the Monks Plantation and preaching
extended not beyond Kent, Surrey, and the adjacent places; as Venerable Bede
tells us; and our learned Countryman, Sir Henry Spelman.

The ambitious Usurpation and Antichristian Tyranny then of the Papal power
and supremacy afterward, over Bishops and Ministers here in England, to which
the title of Christ, St. Peter, or the Catholic Churches establishment, is
poorly begged, and falsely pretended, we the Ministers of the Church of England
ever did, and do, as much abhor, as any of these men can, who are so against
the now Reformed and established Ministry, which we have vindicated from Papal
and superstitious additaments, and asserted, or restored to it Primitive and
Scripturall dignity, and divine authority, which it never lost; but only, not
so clearly discovered, during the times of darkness and oppression. Our
jealousy now is, lest the malice and activity of those, that now dispute, and
act against our thus reformed and prospered Ministry, should prove ere long the
Popes best Engines, and factors, that ever he had in this Church since the
Reformation; if they can (as they have begun, and go on apace) but so far
prepare the way for the reintroduction of the Papal power, and Romish party,
as to cashier all the learned, reformed, and duly Ordained Ministers in
England, both as to their order, authority, and government: will not this
Church in a few more years of confusion, and neglect, become, as a fallow and
unfenced field, fit for the Papal subtilty and Romish activity, which he will
plow with an Ox and an Ass together, the learned Jesuit, joined to the
fanatic Donatist; The Seminary Priests with the gifted brethren; Friars
predicant with Prophets mendicant? So that no wise man, that loves the Reformed
religion and the Church, can think others than that the hand of Joab is in this
matter. Achitophel is in Counsel with Absalom. The Conclave of Rome is wanting
to its interest, if it conspires strongly with this Antiministeriall faction; I
should be glad to be as Hushai the Archite, a means to discover, b^ast, and
bring to naught all those desperate counsels and machinations, which are laid
by any against this reformed Church, and its true Ministry; The happy and
seasonable defeat of which, by Gods blessing to this Church and Nation, I do
yet hope may be such, In vitium ducit cu^pae fuga fi caret art. Hor.
as shall make all Apostatising and ungrateful Politicians, rather repent of
their Apostacies, and see their folly, than follow the fate of that disloyal
renegado, a traitor at once to his friend and sovereign.

I confess I am not for such Reformations, 6. Reformation ought to reverence
Antiquity. Maltem cum sanctis errare quam cum sac^ilegis recte sentire.
as too much suspect the prudence, or vilify the piety of our forefathers,
thereby to extol some men's after zeal and skill. The errors and defects of the
Ancients joined with their charity and sincerity, I believe were far more
pardonable with God, than the late furies and cruelties of some men, pretending
to mend those errors, and supply those defects. Not that it is safe for us to
return to what we now see by the word of God to be an error; But we may in
charity excuse their ignorance in some things of old; while yet we commend and
imitate that wisdom, honesty, order, and gravity of religious profession which
was in them, far beyond the Modern transports of some men's giddiness and
levity, Plato and Aristotle commend that (...), Aequanimity and moderation in
all things, though it be (...). Eth. l. 2.
which toss them from superstition abusing, to superstition utterly refusing
all those things which are not only convenient in Prudence, but necessary in
Piety; as being stamped and established by divine Institution; such as this of
the Evangelicall Ministry has been proved to be. Reformations may bend so much
from the Pope, on the right hand, till they meet him again on the left,
forsaking that rectitude, uprightness, and stability of the Mean, in which only
the truth and honor of Religion does consist.

Antichrist which some are taught more to fear in the name and in others, than
to abhor in the thing and in themselves, is at both ends or extremes of
Religion; as well that of profaneness, confusion, and defect on the one side, as
that of superstition and excess on the other. We must love and entertain what
ever we find of Christ's true Jewels, and the Churches ornaments, amidst the
Counterfeits, and rags of Antichrist; we must not slay any of Christ's sheep,
Luke 15.6.
because it was gone astray, and is now found, but rather take it up, and bring
it home, and rejoice to have found it. Nor may we rend Christ's garment in
pieces, because it may be spotted, and soyled by men's hands, but rather rinse
and restore it to its primitive purity. As Christ redeemed our Souls, so must
we redeem his holy Institutions and ordinances, 1 Pet. 1.18.
(as much as in us lies) from the vain Conversation of the world; And then we
may serve him in the holy ways he has appointed us without fear of sin,
Antichrist, or Superstition, from which both our minds, and our devotions are
happily freed.

Ev^ry man has cause to suspect Antichrist in his own bosom; As the kingdom
of Christ, so the kingdom of Antichrist is within us chiefly. Certainly, it is
far better for the Church and Christians to retain what is Christ's, though in
common with any Antichrists; than passionatly to cast away all that is Christ's,
under pretense of detesting Antichrist; men may fall into sacrilege, while they
seem to abhor Idols; Romans 2.22.
robbing the Church of what Gifts and dowry Christ has given her; (among
which, this of a Constant and successive Ministry, Ephesians. 4.11.
is a chief one in St. Paul's account) and this while blind and preposterous
zeal thinks to strip the whore of Babylon, who dwells where ever division and
confusion nestle in the Church, and to rifle Antichrist (who may roost in other
places as well as Rome.) It is safer to be in Christ's way, though it be rugged,
and may have some inconveniences through many infirmities, than to be in any
other, Mat. 12.44.
which may seem fairer and smoother to us. As the unclean spirit of gross
Idolatry and superstition, may be cast out for a fit, so he may return to his
house swept, and garnished with flowers, and shows of piety, bringing seven
worse devils of Atheism, Pride, Profaneness, and uncharitableness with him. It
is the same evil spirit, which tears the Church by cruel Schisms, with that
which casts it into the fire of persecution, and water of Superstition; There
is always hopes and means of salvation, when there is a true Ministry though
with many faults, yet of Christ's sending, and the Churches Ordeining; but men
may as justly despair of long enjoying the Gospels light, without a due and
settled Ministry, as they may to have day long after the Sun is set, or Harvest
in Winter. As graces and gifts internal, so the means and Ministry external,
are part of the wings of that Sun of righteousness, Mal. 4.2.
who shines no where in the world among Christians, without some healing, and
saving virtue, severally manifested, as to the inward saving power, but always
in the same way, as to the constant outward Ministration, by which it is
ordinarily dispensed: Papal darknings, or humane Eclypsings, are no warrant to
abolish or exclude, that light of the Ministry, which Christ has set up; Nor
can we do the Devil, or any of his instruments a greater greater pleasure, than
quite to extinguish the lights of this Church, in stead of snuffing and
clea^ing them: Better to have dim Lamps, than none at all shining in the house
of God.

But indeed the fault of the English Ministry with some men is, not that they
lighted their Lamps at the Popes taper; but that they have, and do still shine
so bright, as to offend both his, and all others eyes, who could not bear the
splendour of the English Churches both Ministry and Reformation, wherein Zeal
according to knowledge, and wisdom with sobriety, had at once purged away what
was vile, and preserved what was precious, Jer. 15.9.
with great moderation, distinguishing between what was of humane mixture,
superstition, or infirmity, and what was of divine Institution, holy
succession, and authority. The same piety rejected the one, and retained the
other.

I conclude then, that the Papal encroachment, or Romish corruption, what ever
it were, is no argument against the Divine authority, and constant office of
the Reformed, and restored Ministry in this Church; It were a mad cruelty to
knock our Fathers on the head, or to cut their throats, because they were
diseased; and as they might, so they ought in all piety to be healed; How much
more of perfect madness is it, for Christians to destroy their Fathers, who are
now perfectly recovered, and in good health, 7. Extremes in Religion. Eccl.

only because they were sometime sick, or descended from infirm Progenitors?

It is easy for well-affected Christians to be over-scrupulous, and
over-righteous, so to over-act in matters of Religion, as to destroy themselves
before their time; like rude and unwary Combatants, who overthrow themselves,
by overreaching and overstriking at others beyond the measure of well-ordered
and proportioned strength, which always keeps it self strong enough to rule or
command, and so to preserve it self. There is a secret tide of self-interest,
prejudice, or passion, which imperceivably carries men another way, (much
beside, or backward, or beyond what should be) when they think they steer with
a sure course, and full gale to the port of Reformation, in which not only
sincerity is required, but also great discretion, judgment, and moderation;
Therefore Reformation is the work of learned, wise, grave, well tempered, and
well experienced, as well as of godly and well-affected Christians; Reformers
ought to be as skillful, and sober Physicians, capable to distinguish between
the strength of the disease, and the strength of nature; to preserve and foment
the vital spirits, though they quench the feverish flames, and evacuate the
vicious humors.

Vulgar spirits are rude and riotous R^formers, which come only with their Axes
and Hammers, without any Chissels, or finer tools; they are all for battering
down, and breaking in pieces, nothing for pol^shing and cleansing. Hence it is,
that they do no more, Vid. Bishop Davenant. determine. 12. Against peoples

than pull down Crosses, and set up Weathercocks on Chutches, disposing
Religion to perpetual vicissitudes and inconstancies, which are most contrary
to its nature. Like weighty Pendants once violently swayed beyond the
perpendicular line and poyse, they are a long time before they recover the
point of fixation and consistency: Such are popular, heady, and tumultuating
Reformations, usually carrying things at the first impetus, as much beyond the
medium or center of true Religion, as they were formerly, either really or
imaginarily deviated; Plebeian Constitutions, are as subject to be Paralitick,
as Apoplectick, to be ever trembling and troubling Religion in their jealous
furies, as to be otherwhile stupid and supine, in their superstitious follyes;
Sir Kenelm Digby relates the story in his book of Bodies.
But once in motion, and thoroughly scared (as the youth of Leeds with
Soldiers) with those Panick terrors, of superstition, irreligion, popery,
heresy, Antichrist, and the like; they hardly keep, or recover themselves to
any bounds, becoming sober men and good Christians.

Thence it is (as in many other excesses, and transports) that some men seek to
pull down all local Churches, because they may have been sometimes
superstitiously abused; Possibly at the same rate, not one place of their
Conventicle meetings should stand. So they would have all Church-windows either
broken to let in the cold and weather, or quite stopped up, so as the light
should be wholly shut out, Non usus rerum sed libido utentis in culpa est.

the ingenuous industry of Christians as men may attain, for singing, and use of
Music, either Orall or Organicall, in Consort or Solitary (which the sad
severity and moroser humor of some men would utterly banish from all devout and
pious uses, as if all Music and Musical instruments had been profaned ever
since the Dedication of Nabuchadnezars golden Image) even in this (I say) of
Music or melody, Dan. 3.7.
the great Creator may be glorified, both in private and public, either by the

which the Creator has given to Man above all Creatures, and wherewith Man may
be so pleased and exercised in the use of it, as thereby to be better disposed,
and more affected, even to serve the Creator, either in more spiritual, holy,

souls:) who, though they do not dwell and stay on this ladder of sensible
melody, yet they may be still ascending and descending by the s^aves of it in
fervency, charity, and humility to God, others, and themselves; I conceive no
true Religion, but such as is flatted with vulgar fears, can forbid Christians,
Vid. Basil. in Hom. 24. de leg. gent. lib. 1 Cor. 10.31. Col. 3.16.
to make the best (which is a religious use) even of Music; referring it, as
all honest and comely things, to the highest end, Gods glory; And this, not only
in reading or hearing such Psalms and Hymns, and spiritual songs, in which the
divine truth of the matter, affects the enlighened judgment, and the quieted
conscience with the nearest conformity to the holy minds and spirits of those
sacred Writers, who have left us the matter so endited, though we have lost the
ancient tunes of their holy Psalmodies; but also in that audible singing, and
melodious delectation, which is sensible in good Music; and which has a
secret, sweet, and heavenly virtue to allay the passions of the soul, A

and to raise up our spirits to Angelical exaltations, by which we may more
glorify and praise God, which is a part of our worship of him; And wherein the
Spirit of God in David, and other holy men of the ancient Church has set us
allowable, commendable, and imitable examples; Wherein the immusicall rusticity
of some men of more ferine spirits, which no Harp can calm, or cause to depart
from them, as Saul's did, must not prejudice the use, and liberty of those
Christians, who are of more sweet and harmonious tempers, even in this
particular gift and excellency of Music; than which nothing has a more
sensible, and nothing a less sensual delectation; So that if there be not
Music in Heaven, sure there is a kind of heaven in Music; yet even in this so
sweet and harmless a thing, we see that the immoderation and violence of
Christians (which has in it a vein of the old Picts and Sythian barbarity) is
an enemy even to Humanity, as well as to Divinity, while it seeks to deprive
men and Christians of one of the divinest Ornaments, most harmless contentments
and indulgences, which in this world they can enjoy? I the rather insist in
this most innocent particular of singing and Music, because no instance can
show more those rude and unreasonable transports to which men are subject in
what they call religious Reformations; If they do not carry all things with
very wise hearts, and wary hands; that so the leaven of unnecessary rigors and
severities may not make the Mass or lump of religion more sour and heavy, than
God in his Word has required; who cannot be an enemy to the right and
sanctified use of melody or Music; Psalm. 33.2. 2 Cor. 9.7.
since he commands singing to his praises, and loves a cheerful temper in his
service. Certainly Music is of all sensible humane beauty the most harmless
and divine; Nor did I ever see any reason, why it should be thought to deform
us Christians, or be wholly excluded from making a part in the beauty of
holiness.

No time or abuse does prejudice Gods, or the Churches rights. Quamvis ritus
ordinationis in Eccles. pontificia multis superstitionibus and inutilibus
ceremoniis fit vitiatus, ex eo tamen ipsius ordinationis essentiae nihil
decedit; Distinguenda ordinantis infirmitas ab ordinatione, quae sit totius
Ecclesiae nomine, distinguendum divinum ab humano, essentiale ab accidentali,
pium and Christianum ab Antichristiano, sermentum a doctrina Pharisaeorum.

imperatrix omnium virtutum. Auriga and ordin^trix affectuum. Ber. Cant. Toll

All wise and excellent Christians know this for certain, That man's usurpation
is no prejudice to Gods dominion; nor do humane traditions vacate divine
Commands, nor Antichrists superstitions cancel Christ's Institutions; Vain
superstructures of man's addition, neither demolish nor raze Gods foundations;
men do not quit their rights to estates for another unjust in trusion; The
heady invasions of one, or few, or many, upon the Churches rights and
liberties, are no cause to make Christians remove the ancient Landmarks, and
boundaries of true Ministry, due order, and prudent government, which we find
fixed by Christ, continued by the Apostles, and observed by the Churches
obedience in all ages, although not without tinctures and blemishes of humane
Infirmities. They are sad Physicians, and of no value, who know not how to let
their Patients blood, unless they stab them to the heart; Such are those
unhappy leeches, who in stead of eating off, with fit Corosives, the dead flesh
of any part, do lop off whole arms and legs. Some men are too heavy for
themselves; and while they aim to go down the Hill of reformation, they
suddenly conceive such an impetuous motion, as cannot stop it self, till it
has carried all before it, and at length dasheth it self in pieces. Much more
folly it is quite to abolish the use of holy things, than to tolerate some
abuses with it; True reforming is not a starting quite out of the way, as shy
and skittish horses are wont to do, (when they boggle at what scares them, more
than it can hurt them) with danger to themselves, and their riders too; not a
flying to new modes, and exotic fashions of religion, and Churches and
Ministers; but it is a sober and stayed restoration of those ancient and
venerable forms, which pious Antiquity in the Church of Christ, and the ancient
of days, in his more sure Word, has expressed to us. It Is easy to pare off
what one great Antichrist, or the many less have added; and to supply what they
have by force or fraud detracted from that only complete figure of Extern
professional religion, which Christ and his Apostles by him so have fashioned
and delivered; which is never well handled, no not by Reformers, unless
Christians have honest hearts, good heads, clear eyes, and pure hands; when all
these meet in any undertakers to reform the Church, I shall then hope they will
seriously, sincerely and successfully do Christ's and the Churches work, as
generally men are prone and intent to do their own.

This then I may conclude, against all precipitant and blind zeal, which by
popular arts seeks to bring an odium on all Ministers, and the Ministry of this
Church, merely by using the Name of the Pope, without giving any account to
reason or religion of their Calumny; That there is no cause in reason, or
religion, for any Christians to cast off the Ministry of England, as it stands
Reformed, and so restored to its primitive Power and Authority, because of any
Succession from, relation to, or communion with the Order and Clergy of the
Roman Church and Bishop; no more cause, I say, than for these Anti-ministeriall
Cavillers to pull out their eyes, because Papists do see with theirs; or to
destroy themselves* because naturally descended from such parents as were in
subjection to the Bishop of Rome, and in communion with that Church; we may as
well refuse all leagues and treaties of humanity in common with Papists, as all
Christianity; and all Christianity, as all ancient lawful Ministry; an holy
Succession may descend, and Gods elect be derived from such as were true men,
how ever vicious.

CAVIL Or CALUMNY V. Against Ministers as Ordained by Bishops in England.
I Have done with the first part of this Cavil or Calumny, which seeks to
bandy the Ministry of the Church of England, against the Papal and Romish
wall; that they may make it either rebound to a popular and Independent side;
or else fall into the hazard of having no true Christian Ministry at all; from
both which I shall in like fort endeavor to rescue this our holy Function and
Succession.

A second stroke therefore which I am to take, is made with great Artifice and
popular cunning against the Ministry of this Church, as it was derived and
continued by the hands of Bishops, who were as Presidents, or chief Fathers in
the work of Ordination among their Brethren and Sons (the Presbyters) or
Ministers within their several Diocesses; These Prelates or Bishops, the
Objectors protest highly against, as being not Plants of Christ's planting;
whose Authority being lately pulled up by power, so that they seem to have no
more place or influence in this Church or Nation, the Presbytery also, and
whole order of the former Ministry (they say) must necessarily also fail and
wither, which were but branches, and slips derived from the stem or root of
Episcopal Ordination.

Thus we see in a few years, the Anti-ministeriall fury is cudgelling, even
Presbyters themselves, with that staff which some of them put into vulgar
hands, purposely to beat their Fathers, the grave and ancient Bishops, and
utterly to banish that Venerable and Catholic Order, or Eminent Authority of
Episcopacy out of the Church; what the Dove-like innocence of those fierce and
rigid Ministers hearts might be, as to their godly intentions, I know not; but
I am sure they wanted that wisdom of the Serpent, which seeks above all to
preserve its head; whence life, health, motion, and orderly direction,
descending to other parts, do easily repair and heal, what ever lesser hurt or
bruise may befall them,

It must needs be confessed, that as the Events have been very sad, so the
advantages have been great, which the Anti-ministeriall party have gained, by
the preposterous zeal of some Anti-Episcopall spirits, which transported them,
not only beyond and against all bounds, or rules of Reason, Order, Scripture,
Ecclesiastical Custom, and Laws here in England, but even contrary to their
own former, and some of their present judgments, touching Episcopal
Presidency, which they never did, nor do yet hold to be unlawful in the
Church, how ever it might be attended with some inconveniences and mischiefs
too, not arising from the nature of that Order, and power, which is good, but
from the corruption of those men that might manage it amiss. This makes many of
these Ministers have now so much work, to take off that leprosy from their own
heads, which they told the people had so much infected the Bishops hands; by
the Imposition of which, they yet own their Ministerial power, and holy Orders
to have been rightly derived to them, in that Ordination by Bishops, which was
used here in the Church of England, as in all ancient Churches.

It is never too late to rectify, and repent of, any mistakes and miscarriages
incident to us, as poor sinful mortals. Although Primitive Episcopacy, (which
ever was as a grand pillar of the Churches Ministry, Order and Government,)
has been much shaken and thrust aside by man's power, or passion, to the great
weakening and indangering of the whole Fabric and Function of the Ministry,
together with the peace and polity of this Church; yet wise men may possible
see, after these thick clouds and dust of dispute, what is of God in true
Episcopacy; yea, and they may be persuaded to preserve and restore, what is
necessary and comely in it, however they pare off what is deformed, superfluous
and Combersome; (in the behalf of which I am neither a pleader, nor an
approver.)

It is now no time in England either to flatter, or fear the face of
Episcopacy, or sinisterly to accept the persons of Bishops. There is nothing
now can be suspected to move me to touch with respect those goodly ruins (from
which the glory of riches and honor are now so far removed,) but only matter
of conscience, and the integrity of my judgment; And therefore I here crave
leave without offense to any, that are truly godly (either Ministers or others)
who may differ from me in this point,) freely, yet as briefly as I can, to
discover my judgment, touching this so controverted point of Episcopacy, in
which from words men have fallen to blows, and from wasting of ink, to the
shedding of blood. I see that other men of different sense, daily take their
freedom to vent themselves against all Bishops, and all Episcopacy; some of
them so rudely and unsavorily, as if they hoped by their evil breath, to
render that venerable name, and order, ever abhorred, and execrable to
Christian minds; which to learned and sober Christians ever was, and still is,
as a sweet Ointment poured forth; nor does it lose of its divine and ancient
fragrancy by the fractures of these times, which have broken (it may be) not
with devotion and love, so much as with hatred, and passion, that Alabaster-box
of civil protection and Sanction, in which it was here, for many hundreds of
years, happily preserved from vulgar insolency, and Schismatic contempt. Why
may not I presume to enjoy my freedom too, yet bounded with all modesty and
sobriety, without any prejudice or reproach, reflecting upon the Counsels, or
actions of any men my Superiors, whose power and practice, as to secular
mutations, neither can, nor ought to have any influence on men's opinions, and
consciences, further than way is made for them by the Ha^bing^rs of Reason and
Religion, which are best set forth and disce ned, in innate principles of Order
and Polity; also in Scripture precepts and precedents; and lastly by the
Catholic Custom, and practice of the Church of Christ.

Ans. In my answer therefore to this Cavil or Calumny, touching Bishops (which
many Ministers are as afraid to name, or own with honor, as they are to call
any holy man, either Apostle, Evangelist, Father or Martyr, by the title of
Saints) my intent is not, largely to handle that late, severe, and unkind
Dispute in England about Episcopacy or Prelacie; for this having been learnedly
and fully done by others, would be, as superfluous, so extremely tedious both
to the Reader and my self; Nor is it my purpose to justify all that might be
done or omitted by some Bishops in their government; But my design chiefly is,
1. to remove that popular odium, to allay that Plebeian passion, to rectify
those unlearned prejudices, and to take away those unjust ^ealousies, which are
by some weak, and possibly well-meaning Christians, taken up, and daily urged
against all Bishops, in a Presidentiall eminency among Presbyters, or above
other Ministers. 2. My next is, to justify that holy Ordination and
Ministerial authority, which by the imposition of their hands chiefly was,
with probation, prayer, and meet Consecration, duly conferred upon the
Ministers of this Church, according to Scripture rule, and Ecclesiastical
custom in all settled Churches.

But before I handle the first thing proposed, I must seek to remove that
prejudice which sticks deep in some ordinary minds against Bishops and their
Authority, merely arising from the darkness, and sufferings of late so
plentifully cast upon them; if arguments and words could not, yet Arms and
Swords have (they say) convinced Bishops, and subdued them, notwithstanding all
their learning, Sed quid berba Remi! sequitur fortunam ut semper and edit
^^mnatos. Juv.
their gravity, their piety, their protection, which they pleaded from the
Churches Catholic custom, and the Laws of this Church: The vulgar are prone
to think those wicked, who are unprosperous, and accursed, who are punished.

Yet in true judgment of things, those great and many impressions of worldly
diminution, and supposed Miseries made upon Bishops, are more just arguments
against the innocence of their persons, place, Job 1.
and lawful power, than Jobs afflictions were, which the Devil never urged
against his integrity, but sought thereby to overthrow it, as God did prove and
exercise it.

I believe there are too many that would be content there should be neither
Bishops nor Presbyters, but such as are great sufferers; Nor yet any Word, or
Sacrament, or holy Ministrations, nor any marks of Christianity in this, or any
other Reformed Church: But the measures of religious matters, are never to be
taken from the passions or prevalencies of men, nor from any secular decrees,
or human acts, and civil sanctions. Godly and famous Bishops in eminency
among, and above the e Presbyters, were many ages before any civil power
protected them, and so they may continue, if God will, in his true Church, even
then when (as of old) most persecuted, and sought to be destroyed: Worldly
Counsels and forces, which commonly are levelled to men's secular ends, and
civil interests, signify little or nothing indeed to a true Christians
judgment or conscience in the things of Christ and true Religion; which must
never be either refused, or accepted, according as they may be ushered in, or
crowded out by Civil Authority. Christ does not steer his Church by that
Compass; Things the more divine and excellent, the more probable to be rejected
by men of this world. At the same rate of worldly frowns and disfavours,
Christians long ere this time, should have had nothing left them of Scriptures,
Sacraments, sound doctrine, or holy Ministrations; All had been turned into
Heathenish barbarity, Heretical errors, or Schismatical confusions, if
conscience to God, and love to Christ and his Church, had not preserved by the
constancy and patience of Christian Bishops and Ministers, those holy things,
which the wicked, (...) (i^q^it Plato) (...). Cl. Al. (...). 1.
wanton, and vain world, was never well pleased withal, and often persecuted,
seeking to destroy both root and branch of Christianity: Wear to regard not
what is done by the few, or the many, the great or the small, but what in right
reason, and due order, after the precepts and patterns of true Religion ought
to be done in the Church.

As for the Government of Bishops, Episcopal power not Antichristian.
so far as it referred to the chief power and office of Ordeining Ministers in
a right succession for due supplies to this Church of England; Truly I am so
far from condemning that Episcopal authority and practice, as unlawful and
Antichristian, after the rate of popular clamor, ignorance, passion and
prejudice; That contrarily very learned, wise, and godly men have taught me to
think and declare; That as the faults and presumptions of any Bishops, through
any pride, ambition, and tyranny, or other personal immoralities, are very
Antichristian, because most Diametrally contrary to the Precept and pattern of
our holy and humble Savior Jesus Christ, whose place Bishops have always as
chief Pastors and Fathers among the Presbyters, since the Apostles times,
eminently supplied, in the extern order and Polity of the Church. So that above
all men they ought to be most exactly conform to the holy rule and example of
Jesus Christ, Episcipale ^ffi^^ a maxim o^nan^ and nobilitant gravitas mo^um,
in^turitas Consiliorum, actuum honest as. Bern. Ep. 28. C^in hono^is p

both in doctrine and manners; So withal, they have taught me to esteem the
Ancient and Catholic government of godly Bishops, (as moderators and
Presidents among the Presbyters in any Diocese or Precincts) in its just
measure and constitution for power Paternall, duty exercised, such as was in
the persecuting purest and Primitive times) to be as much, if not more
Christian, than any other form and fashion of government can be; yea, far
beyond any that has not the charity to endure Catholic primitive and right
Episcopacy, which truly I think to be most agreeable to right reason, and those
principles of due order and polity among men, also no less suitable to the
Scripture wisdom, both in its rules and paterns; to which was conform the
Catholic and Primitive way of all Christian Churches, throughout all ages, and
in all places of the world.

Which things very learned men, and friends to Presbytery joined with Episcopacy
have confessed both lately (as Salmatius, Bochartus, and Blondellus) and also
formerly, as Calvin, Beza, Moulin, with many others: so far was ever any
learned and unpassionate man from thinking Episcopacy unlawful in the Church.

Indeed after all the hot Canvasings, and bloody contentions, which have
wearied, and almost quite wasted the Estates, spirits, and lives of many
learned men in this Church of England, as to the point of true Epi^copacy, I
freely profess that I cannot yet see, but that that ancient and universal form
of government in due conjunction with Presbytery, and with due regard to the
faithful people, is as much beyond all other new invented fashions, as the
Suns light glory, and influence, is beyond that of the mutable and many-faced
Moon, or any other Junctos of Stars and Planets, however cast into strange
figurations, or new Schemes and Conjunctions, by the various fancies of some
Diviners and Astrologers.

Which free owning of my judgment, in this point, may serve to blot out that
Character (etiam ipse Presbyterianus) added to my name, by the learned Pen of
Bochartus. For although I own with all honor and love orderly Presbytery, and
humble Presbyters, in the sense of the Scriptures, and in the use of all pious
Antiquity, for sacred and divine, in their office and function (as the lesser
Episcopacy, or inspectors over lesser flocks in the Church, yet not so, (...).

as abhorring and extirpating all order and presidency of Bishops among them,
as if it were Antichristian, wicked, and intolerable; Nor do I think that an
headless, or many headed Presbytery ought to be set up in the Church, as of
necessity, and divine right; in this sense that learned writer himself, is no
Presbyterian, nor ever had cause to judge me to be of that mind.

I confess, after the example of the best times, 2. Reasons for Episcopacy

and judgment of the most learned in all Churches, I always wished such
moderation on all sides, that a Primitive Episcopacy (which imported, the
Authority of one grave and worthy person, chosen by the consent, and assisted
by the presence, counsel, and suffrages of many Presbyters) might have been
restored, or preserved in this Church; and this not out of any factious design,
but for these weighty reasons, Ignat. ad Antiochenos Bids the Presbyter^ feed

to the Venerable piety and wisdom of all Antiquity; which always had
President Bishops in all settled and completed Churches, together with the

there were many Presbyters in one City, so as to make up a Presbytery, the
Bishop and Deacons were all that officiated among those few Christians, which
the Apostles left in that City; who afterward increasing to many Congregations,
had so many Presbyters, Ordained, placed and governed by the Eminency of his
virtue and authority, who was Bishop there, or Pastor before them, as in time,
so some in special Authority and Office by Apostolical appointment. And
certainly in things that are not so clearly and punctually set down in express
commands of Scripture, a sober and modest regard ought to be had in matters of

which could not follow so soon, and so universa^ly any way, but from
Apostolical precept or direction; from which the Catholic Church could not
suddenly err in all places, being so far in those times from any passion or
temptation either of covetousness or ambition, which had then no fuel from
the savor of Princes, and as little sparks of ambition in the hearts of those
holy men; who were in all the great and Mother Churches both ever owned and
reverenced in antiquity, as Bishops, in a priority of place and presidency of
authority, both by the humble Presbyters, and all the rest of the faithful
people. It is not among the things comely or praise worthy, Phil. 4.8. Either
in charity, modesty, humility, or equity, for us in after and worse times, to
cast upon all those holy Primitive Christians and famous Churches, either the
suspicion of a general Apostasy, by a wilful neglect, or universally falling
away from that Apostolical way; or a running cross to it: Neither may we think
that all Churches did lightly and imprudently abuse that occasional liberty,
which might be left them in prudence; whereby further to establish what might
seem the best for order and peace, as to the matter of Government: wherein if
the Churches were free to choose, it is strange, they all agreed in this one
way of Episcopal Government, All over the Christian world, till these later
times. It becomes us, rather to be jealous of our own weak and wanton passions,
and to return rather from our later transports and popular wanderings, to the
nearest conformities with those first and best times; who universally had
Bishops, either because they were so divinely commanded; or in holy wisdom they
chose that way, as best; so far as there was left a Christian liberty of
prudence, to those who were by the Apostles, set, as Pastors and Rulers over
the several Churches: and however the name at first was common to all Church
Ministers, Apostles, and Presbyters, to be called Bishops; yet afterward, when
the Apostles were deceased, their successors in the eminency of place, among
the Presbyters, were called peculiarly Bishops.

For the avoiding of Scandal giving to so many Christian Churches, remaining
in all the world; who, for the far major part, are still governed by Bishops,
in some respect distinct from and eminent above the Presbyters; It is not the
work of Christian prudence or charity, to widen differences, between us and
other Churches, Greek, Eastern, African, or Western; yea, we owe this Charity
to the Romanists, and to our selves rather, who seem to have gained this great
advantage against us, by the offense given them in utter abolishing the Ancient
and Catholic order and succession of Episcopacy; that they will less now
esteem us Christians; or to be in any true Church; since they will not allow us
any right and complete Ordination of Ministers, and so no Sacraments, and no
Christianity as to extern profession and administration without Bishops; yea,
the best reformed Churches must needs be offended who approve such a Presidency
of Bishops among Presbyters, where it is continued with the doctrinall
Reformation; many enjoy Bishops still as we did; No learned and godly men ever
thought it cause enough to separate from any Church because it had Bishops.
Such as have them not in a constant Presidency, yet count this no part of their
Reformation; but rather deplore it, as a defect involuntary, pleading the Law
of necessity, or some grand inconveniences and difficulty to excuse thereby
their inconformity, so far, to other Churches and to all Antiquity; yea the
most learned and wise among their Presbyterians abroad, often wish they had the
honor and happiness of reformed and reforming Bishops. Nor ever did heretofore
the most learned and godly people in England, Ministers or others, any more
than the Princes, Nobility, and Gentry, generally desire the abolition of right
Episcopacy; however now at last they had not either opportunity to plead for
it, or such power and influence as to preserve it, against those inundations
which God has been pleased to suffer to overflow in this Church; But rocks are
not presently removed, when over-flown: what is of God will stand, and outlive
the deluge.

Thirdly, I prefer a Primitive Episcopacy, as the best way of union, and happy
satisfaction, to all learned, wise, and good men; especially in that so shaken
and disputed a point of Ordination, for the right succession and conferring of
power Ministerial: which the most learned and sober Presbyterians confess, not
to be weakened by Episcopal Presidency; And very many, no less considerable
men, for number, learning, and piety (as Da. Blondell among others) do think,
the right Ordination of Ministers to be much more strengthened, adorned and
completed, where it passes through the hands of the Episcopal power and
order; if for no other reason, yet for this, that it was the Apostolical,
Primitive, and universal way, used in the Church, and by which the Authority
and Office of the Ministry has ever been, together with Christianity, derived
to us from the Apostles times. Its evident, that the sudden and violent
receding of many men from their former judgment and practice in this point,
has occasioned many great scandals, scruples and schisms, troubles and
confusions, in matters both of Church and State; giving great advantages to all
that list to cavil at, question, and despise, the Ordination, and Ministry of
even those Presbyters (yea, their very Christianity, as to the outward form,
order, and profession,) who so easily renounced, and eagerly cast quite away,
that order and power, as unlawful and un-Christian.

Ep. 9. ad Rogationum.
Fourthly, A right Episcopacy seems yet never to have had so free, full, and
fair an hearing, as is requisite in so great a matter, so as to have been
evicted to be against the Scriptures, as some pretended.

1. When as it is most evident, in most learned and godly men's judgments
ancient and modern, that it has the nearest resemblance to that ancient Pattern
at least, which God settled, the Government of his Church among the Jews; who
had the heads of their Fathers, as Bishops; and rulers over their brethren, the
Priests and Levites, Numb. 3.24. Now it is manifest that our Lord Christ and the
Apostles, had great regard to the Judaick customs, in Christian Institutions;
As in the Baptising with water; In the use of the Bread, and Wine in the Lords
Supper; In the Sabbatising on the Lords Day; and in the giving the power of the
Keys to the Pastors and Teachers of the Church, to open and shut, to bind and
loose; expressing thereby Ministerial Authority: In all which there was some
like or parallel precedents among the Jews, in making their Rabbis, and in
celebrating holy mysteries, and governing those of that Church and Religion.

2. For, the new Testament, nothing either of precept or example seems against
a right Episcopacy, commanding a parity, or forbidding order and subjection
among Presbyters as well as other men: what Christ forbids his Apostles of
exercising dominion after the manner of Princes of the world, excludes indeed,
First from the twelve (who were (pares in Apostolatu) equally Apostles, and
were not long to live in one society; but to lay the foundations of Religion in
all the world, by a parity of power; coordinate, but not subordinate to any but
Christ, who chose them) and proportionably, forbids all Bishops and Churchmen,
the secular methods of gaining or using any Ecclesiastical power and eminency
in the Church, as by ambition, force, usurpation, tyranny; by the sword, and
severities, penally inflicted on the Bodies, Estates, Liberties and lives of
men; which was the way, of the world, but not of Christ, or his Ministers; yet
these tyrannies which attend men's lusts and passions, as men, are as incident
(besides factions and emulations) to the Presbyterian way, where some are
always heady and leaders, as to that of a right and regular Episcopacy,
whereto Presbyters are joined. The plain meaning of our Lord Jesus (who owned
himself, as chief among his Apostles, Calvin. Inst. l. 4. c. 4. Sect. 2. Says,
Episcopal eminency is the best way to prevent Schisms, and to keep peace in
the Church. Luke 22.26. But ye shall not be so: But he that is greatest among
you let him be as the youngest, and he that is chief as he that does serve.
Mat. 24. There may be a wise servant whom the Lord may set over his house.
Timothy is taught how to behave himself in the Church as a Governor, no less
than a Minister, or Teacher. 1 Timothy 3.15. Remis non sceper is guberuent
Episcopi: (...). Chrysostom. de Episc. Tom. 4. p. 627. (...). Is. pel. l. 2. not
(...) as Liban to Basil says Bishops were, etc. Basil. Ep. 154.
yet condescended to serve them,) is; That, what ever excellency any Christian
Minister or other had above others, in age, estate, parts, place, power, gifts,
graces, or civil honors (for what hinders a Prince or Nobleman to be a
Minister of the Gospel, and yet retain both his honor and estate temporal?)
all these should be used and enjoyed without the leaven of pride, insolency, or
oppression, and only be turned to greater advantages of serving Christ, and the
Church, with all humble Industry; As Christ himself did; And after him the
Apostles, who had undoubtedly as some order and precedence among themselves in
the equality of their Apostolical power; so also priority both of place,
superiority of Church jurisdiction, and authority and power over all other
Disciples and beleivers; And this not from any personal gifts temporary, and
privileges so much, as from that wisdom and peaceable order, which Christ would
have observed always in his Church, after the Apostolical example; By some of
whom, as the ancients tell us, Some Ministers were clearly constituted as
Bishops, with an eminency of personal power over others, to ordein, censure,
rebuke, silence, even Presbyters and Deacons.

D. Blondell confesses p. 183. None can be dispensed wit^, as t^ the violating
or neglect of that Chu ch ord^r and Government, wh ch is p^esc ibed to Timothy
and Titus, which rule is of Divine right and perpetual.
This is undeniably evident by Scripture in Timothy and Titus; The validity and
authority of which examples were esteemed by Antiquity, and followed, as
warrantable divine precedents, and obligatory examples to after ages, (in the
like cases at least) for imitation; By preserving such an ordinary succession
of power in Bishops among and above Presbyters; both in ordination and
jurisdiction. Nor is this clear instance to be any way in reason, avoided, by
saying, that Timothy and Titus w re Evangelists; (what ever that Office were in
the Church (either temporary and personal; or common to other chief Ministers,
and perpetually to succeed) for it makes nothing against a personal
superiority of power, and authority in them over their respective Churches:
which was to succeed to others in all reason, as well as their Ministry did;
both these being always necessary for the Church; and indeed their ordinary
power as to Government, had no dependence on their being Evangelists; 2 Timothy
2.15. 1 Timothy 4.13. 2 Timothy 4.2.
no more, than their Preaching, and other Ministerial acts had; which we may
not argue from these two persons, to be incompatible to any Ministers now;
Unless they be Evangelists: For then, no Presbyters that are not Evangelists in
their sense might study or Preach, in season, and out of season, rebuke,
exhort, etc. or show themselves Workmen that need not to be ashamed etc. Now if
these acts and Offices of Ministry are derivable to other single persons in a
Ministerial way; why not also that Gubernative power too; which was from the
Apostle signally committed to Timothy and Titus, and no where so expressly to
any fraternity of Ministers, or Presbytery in common?

2 Cor. 11.5.12.11. (...). Ioh. 21.15.
After that rate of arguing, we may conclude, that none, but the very chief
Apostles, might feed the Lambs and Sheep of Christ; because, that command was
thrice given to Peter; who was reckoned among the chiefest of the Apostles;
which Conclusions were as absurd, and ridiculous; (being by all the practice
and sense of the Primitive Churches confuted,) as this; that the power of
proving and ordeyning Presbyters, 1 Timothy 5.19.22. Tit. 1.5.
by laying on of hands, of receiving accusations against them, of rebuking,
censuring, excommunicating, silencing and restoring, (all Acts gubernative) may
not be eminently in any single person; unless they be Apostles or Evangelists;
when as not only the use of such order and power is in all reason necessary for
Church societies (no less, than for civil;) but the succession of it, in such
sort as it began in them, to all times after, seems clearly intimated, by that
vehement charge laid on Timothy, 1 Timothy 5.21. 2 Timothy 4.5.
to keep those things unpartially and unblameably until the coming of our
Lord Jesus Christ: Which Timothy in his infirm person could not do; but, in his
care to transmit the holy pattern to posterity, and to his successors; he might,
as he was enjoined, be said to do: For what is once well done in a regular
public way, (...). Bas. M. (...). Id. Peren^^s est and aeterna praeclari

is ever after done, as to the permanency of that virtue, which is in a good
and great example.

What other Churches did observe after the Apostles times, Ordo Episcoporum ad
originem recensus in Johannem stabit autorem. Tertul. l. 4. c. 5. ad. Marcio.
So Clem. Alex. testifies that S. John made Bishops in Asia. Ignatius Epist. ad

Revelation. So the Epistle of the Smyrnenses justify of him calling him (...).

as to the manner of their Government, when they grew numerous, and spread to
many Congregations and Presbyteries, we may easily be resolved both by the
testimony and practice of all Antiquity: Fathers, Councils, Historians, who
have registered the uninterrupted succession of Bishops, from the Apostles, both
in the seven Asiatick Churches mentioned in the Revelation; whose * Angels were
generally taken for their Presidents or Bishops; and some of Apostles then
living; when as Archippus, Evodius, and Onesimus, and Polycrates were Bishops,
etc. What after times observed, is evident to this day among all Christians;
even those of the Eastern and Abyssine Church have still their Bishops: so the
Greek and Muscovitish Churches; so the furthest Asians, which are thought to
have been first converted by St. Thomas, (who furthest from believing, did the
penance of traveling furthest, to Preach the Gospel in India) And I observe
the Fratres Bohemi in their persecuted state and poverty for a long time, still
retained a very happy and comely order of Episcopal Government.

Truly, I never found so much light of Scripture pattern and precept, enjoining
any one, or more Presbyters to do all those works of power and jurisdiction;
Nor ever did they without the presence of an Apostle, or some Apostolical
successor and Bishop, regularly ordein, excommunicate, silence, etc. so far as
I can yet learn. There are but two texts that mention the Presbytery, (and but
one which can be pretended for ruling Lay Elders;) which yet these are not
preceptive or institutive, but merely narrative and touching, without
expressing any joint power, Office, or Authority of Presbyters, with any
President or Bishop: much less, without them and against them. Yea I read in
St. Judes Epistles v. 8. foul marks put upon those in the Church, that despise
dominions, and speak evil of dignities; Against whose proud and seditious
practices, a woe is denounced, Verse. 11.
as against men, cruel like Cain, covetous like Balaam, ambitious as Korah,
factious disturbers of that order, which God has set in his Church, (as well
as in civil societies) after the mutinous example of Korah and his company,
Numb. 16.3.
who rose against both Moses and Aaron; parallel to whose evil manners and
disorderly practices, 2 Pet. 2.10.
these men had not been, against whom St. Jude here, and St. Peter in his
second Epistle so sharply inveighs (as presumptuous, self-willed, despisers of
dignities, etc.) unless there had been some eminencies in the Church Christian,
as well as was among the Jews, which these men were most bold to oppose and
contemn; As for the civil powers, Romans 13. 1 Pet. 2.13.
that then were in the world, humble Christians made conscience as God
commanded them, to submit to them in all honest things. And those hypocrites,
were no doubt too wary, to adventure any thing against them, whose power was
terrible by the sword; But the Orders, Governments, Dignities and Dominions in
the Church, were exposed by their weakness, to the scorn and affronts of any
such proud and tumultuating Spirits; which covered themselves under the veil of
Christian Religion, yea and pretensions of the Spirit too; J^d. 19.
the better to set off their Schisms, and separatings from that authority,
power, and order, which God had by the Apostles settled in the Church, even in
those times.

5 If there were not thus much of Scripture pattern, and precept pleading fairly
for a right Episcopacy; yet since there is nothing against it, in Scripture, or
Reason, in Religion, or morals, yea and so much for it in common reason, (...).
Plato. de leg. Nihil sit in rep. sine ordinis and regiminis custodia. So
Lycurgus o dered, ut nullus in repub. ordo sine proprio esset Magisterio.
true polity, and almost necessity in Church societies, no less than in either
families, Cities, armies, or any fraternities, and Corporations of men: No
doubt the Lord of his Church has not deprived or denied that liberty, and
benefit of good order, and rational Government to his Church, which in all
civil societies, may lawfully be used, according to wisdom and discretion;
Truly, we may as well think it unlawful, for one Minister to excel another,
or many others, in age, parts, learning, prudence, gravity, and gubernative
faculties: which if they may lawfully he had, and are found in some by the
especial gift of God, to so great differences from, and excellencies above,
others; what Reason or Religion can forbid them to be accordingly used, and
publicly employed in answerable differences of place and power for the
Churches good? only Christ ^equires humility in priority, Ministry in their
majority, and service in their superiority, proportioned to their gifts and
endowments, which God never gave in vain. Nor does there ever want indeed a
plebs and vulgarity, among many Presbyters, thought honest and able men, some
of whom are still young, and prone to be passionate, imprudent, factious and
schismatic, whose folly is not yet decocted, nor youthful heats abated,
etc. For the good ordering of whom, beyond a contemptible and heady parity, a
right Episcopal presidency may be as useful, lawful, and necessary; as a
little Wine was for Timothy, in regard of his frequent infirmities. 1 Timothy
5.23. which St. Jerome every where owns, as the ground of the first constitution
of Bishops after the Apostles. Nor can such a paternall presidency be injurious
to others, If rightly ordered, Epist. ad Evagrium and adversus Luciferianos.

Cyprian complains in his time, who was one of the meekest and humblest Bishops
that ever were, of the Arrogance of Presbyters acting without their Bishop,

in the due choosing and preferring of a worthy and tried person; who cannot be
said to be imperious, or to exercise any forbidden dominion over those, by
whose suffrages and consent he is worthily placed in that power and place for
the good of them all; which priority and eminency ought to be kept, within
those bounds of Christian authoriry, which may consist with Charity and
Humility. And after all this, we see by woeful experience, that the want of
that right Episcopal Government, has occasioned so many and great mischiefs,
in this and other Churches; as do sufficiently show the use and worth of it;
which was always the greatest conservator of the Churches peace and purity in
the best and Primitive times.

against any thing that is called Prelacy or like to Episcopacy, I answer, 1.
The best observation to be made, as from the vote and sense of the ((...)) most
men, is this; what they most dislike and oppose, is most by wise men to be
desired and approved; Its no rule for good men to walk by, in matters of
Religion, above all. 2. I believe the generality of sober Christians in this
Nation do so much see the misery of change, and the want of right Church
Government, that they are (both the most and best of them) rather desirous of a
restored and regulated Episcopacy, than any other way, which has been tried in
vain. 3. Neither headless Presbytery, nor scattered Independency are without
many great dislikes already in the minds of many good Christians; who finding
these remedies worse than the disease are prejudiced against them both. 1. For
their novelty; being unheard of in the Christian world, for 1500. years, Nobis

and the last of not above ten years standing in England; both brought in but
abruptly, as rising from private men's interests, passions and policies; with
which Episcopal Government did not well agree; Neither of them ever having had
either the vote of any general council, or the practice of any considerable
part of the Catholic Church. 2. Suspected they are by many, for their
prevaling upon this Church, by a kind of force; against the consent of the
supreme Magistrate, and this in broken and bleeding times; Planted not by
Preaching and patience, but by the Sword, and watered with civil blood; Each
driving their Chariot (as Tullia the wise of Tarquinus Superbus did) over their
Fathers: As if they brought in (Armatum Evangelium) Christian Religion in
complete armor, and Christ marching, like Alexander, Hannibal, or Caesar; when
as Episcopacy was (toto orb decretum) with wisdom, charity and peace, by
consent of all Churches in all the world approved (as St. Jerome tells us,) and
established even in those times, when persecution kept the Church most in
purity, and unity with self, and when prayers and tears were the only arms used
in the Church, to set up any part of the Kingdom of Christ; either in Doctrine
or Discipline. 3. Because neither of those new ways, ever yet had such plenary
and peaceable approbation (after due debate,) from the public reason, prudence
and piety of this nation, comparable to what the Government by Bishops, always
had, in all Parliaments and Synods for many hundreds of years, since we had any
Princes or Parliaments Christian. 4. Neither of them, carry yet any promising
face of more truth, peace, order and honor to the Christian reformed Re^igion,
to this Church or Nation; nor yet of more moral strictness and holiness in
men's lives; nor of more grace in men's hearts; nor of more love and union as to
men's affections; yet in no degree so much as Episcopacy did, in the Primitive
and best times; yea, and in these last times too, since the Reformation; for
although it might have some sharp prickles with it; yet it bare sweeter and
fairer R^ses, than these last have done or are like to do, and with far less
offense. 5. The same or worse inconveniences, which are by any objected against
Episcopacy in its age and decays, discover themselves in the very bud and
infancy of these new ways: As much pride, ambition, tyranny, vanity,
incharitablenese; more Profaneness, Atheism, Heresy, Blasphemy, Licentiousness;
far more faction, bitterness, vulgarity, deformity and confusion; besides the
needless offense and scandal given to most Christian Churches in all the
world, who retain the government by Bishops, being as ancient as their being
Christians, and descended from the same origin, the Apostles, and Apostolical
men. 6. Neither of the new modes ever produced, either Precept or holy example,
or any divine direction for them in any degree, so clearly, and so fully, as
Episcopacy has always done; Nor yet have they produced any promise from God,
that they shall be freed from those inconveniences, which were real, or
odiously objected against Episcopacy; and which may be incident in time to all
things that are managed by men.

This government then by a fatherly president or chief Bishop among Presbyters,
seeming to have not equal, 4. The advantages of Episcopacy against any other.
but far superior grounds, from Scripture, both as to the Divine wisdom, so
ordering the form of his ancient Church among the Jews; also by the example,
precept and direction evident from Christ Jesus, and the holy Apostles in the
New Testament; No wonder that many, yea far the most of godly and learned
upright men, do rather approve a Primitive and right Episcopacy, than any other
new fashion, which is rather conform to secular interest, than to any thing of
the Churches, or true religions advantages; especially when it is evident, that
Episcopacie has the great and preponderating addition of the Ancient, sole,
and Universal government, approved, and used by all the Churches of Christ, in
the purest and most impartial times; To which, neither of the other, can with
any face pretend for themselves; nor with any truth contradict; it being
averred by all Antiquity, in the behalf of right and regular Episcopacy, which
never failed to succeed the Apostles authority and eminency, either by their
own immediate appointment in many places, even while they yet lived; or by the
election and Votes of the Colleges and Fraternities of Presbyters, after the
Apostles decease, who still chose one man eminent, for his faith, piety, zeal,
and holy gravity, to be duly consecrated in power and place above them; as a
Father among sons; Aust. Ep. 148. ad Valeri^^. Jerome. ad Nepotianum. Ad
Evagriu^^. Crysost. hom. 3 in Act. Apost. (...). Crysost. Hom. 3. in Acta.
or an elder Brother among brethren; or as a Master or Provost in a College; or
as a General in an Army; as St. Jerome himself tells us.

I answer, Such an one for Age, as may be a Father; for wisdom a Senator, for
gravity a Stoic, for light an Angel, for innocence a Saint, for industry a
Labourer, for constancy a Confessor, for zeal a Martyr, for charity a Brother,
for humility a Servant to all the faithful Ministers and other Christians
under his charge; I would have him venerable for those several excellencies,
which are most remarkable in the ancient and most imitable Bishops; The
devotion of St. Gregory; the indefatigableness of St. Austin; the courage of
St. Ambrose; the learning of Nazianzen; the generosity of Basil; the Eloquence
of Chrysostom; the gentleness of Cyprian; the holy flames of Ignatius; the
invincible constancy of Polycarp; That so be may come nearest to the
Apostolical pattern, and resemble the most of any Christian, or Minister, the
grace and Glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. Quod in aliis sacerdotibus deest per

I would have him (yet not I, but the vote of all pious Antiquity requires a
Bishop) to be among men the most moral among Christians the most faithful;
among Preachers the most painful; among Orators the most persuasive; among
Governors the most moderate; among Devotionaries the most fervent; among
Professors the most forward; among Practisers the most exact; among sufferers
the most patient; among perseverants the most constant: He should be as the
Holy of holyes was both to the inward court of those that are truly sanctified
and converted; and to the outward court of those that are called Christians,
only in visible profession; I would have nothing in Him, that is justly to be
blamed, or sinisterly suspected; And all things that are most deservedly
commended by wise and sober Christians; I would have a Bishop of all men the
most complete, as having on him the greatest care, namely that of the Church,
and of souls; And this in a more public and eminent inspection; as one daily
remembering the strictness of Gods account, and expecting either a most glorious
Crown, or a most grievous Curse to all Eternity.

I would have him most deserve, and most able to use well, but yet least
esteeming, Vid. Bern. Ep. 42. Vid. Amb. tom. 3. ep. 82. Qualis eligendus sit

coveting, or ambitionating the riches, pomp, glory, and honor of the world.
One that knows how to own himself in Persecution, as well as in Prosperity, and
dares to do his duty as a Bishop in both estates; I do not much consider the
secular Parade and Equipage, further than as public encouragements of Merit,
as excitations to excel, as noble rewards of Learning, and as catern decencies
or solemnities which do much set off, and Embroider Authority in the sight of
the vulgar; I wish him duly chosen with judgment; accepting with modesty,
esteemed with honor, reverenced with love; Overseeing with vigilance, ruling
with joynt-Counsel, not levelled with younger Preachers and novices, nor too
much exalted above the graver, and elder Presbyters; neither despised of the
one, nor despising of the other; I wish him an honorable competency (if it may
be had) with his eminency; that he may have wherewith to exercise a large
heart, and a liberal hand, which every where carry respect and conciliate
love; If this cannot be had, yet I wish him that in true worth, which is denied
him in wealth. That his virtue and piety may still preserve the authority of
his place; and this in the Order, Peace, and Dignity of the Church; That he may
be the Touchstone of Truth, the Loadstone of Love, the Standard of Faith, the
Pattern of holiness; the Pillar of stability, and the Center of Unity in the
Church.

Nor are these to be esteemed, as Characters of an Eutopian Prelate, only to be
had in the abstract of fancy and speculation; Many such Bishops have been
anciently in the Church, and not a few, here in England, some still are such in
their merits a midst their ruins and obscurings, and more might constantly and
easily be supplied to the Churches good order, peace and honor; If Reason and
not Passion, Religion and not Superstition, Judgment and not Prejudice,
Calmness and not fierceness, Learning and not Idiotism, Gravity and not
Giddiness, Wisdom and not Vulgarity, Prudence and not Precipitancy; impartial
Antiquity, and not interessed novelty may be the judge of true Episcopacy.

Bishops should not be like blazing Comets in their Diocese, having more of
distance, terror, and pernicious influence, than of light or Celestial virtue;
But rather, as fixed Stars of the prime magnitude, shining most usefully and
remarkably in the Church, during this night of Christ's absence, who is the only
Sun for his light, and Spouse for his love to the Church; yet has he appointed
some proxies to woo for him, and Messengers to convey love tokens from him;
among whom the holy Bishops of the Church were ever accounted as the chiefest
Fathers next the Apostles, when they were indeed such as evil men most feared,
good men most loved, Schismatics most envied, and Heretics most hated: Right
Episcopacy is so great an advantage to the Churches happiness, and so
unblamable in its due constitution and exercise, that it is no small blemish to
any godly man's judgment, not to approve it, and nothing (as to imprudence) is
I think more blameworthy, than not to desire, esteem, love and honor it.
Since such Prelature is as lawful, as it is useful; and it is as useful, as
either Reason or Religion; polity or piety can propound in any thing of that
nature, which if not absolutely necessary, yet certainly most convenient for
the Church, and commendable in the Church (so far as it stands in a visible
P^l^^y and society,) being no way, either sinful in it self, or contrary to
any positive Law of God, any more than it is for Christians in civil
governmen^, to have Majors in their Cities, Colonels in their Armies, Masters
in their Colleges, Wardens in their Fraternities, Captains or Pilots in their
Ships, or Fathers in their Families.

Nor is indeed the venerable face of true Episcopacy so deformed by some men's
late ridiculous dresses and disguises; but that wise and learned men still see
the many reverend and excellent lineaments of it, not only of pious and prime
antiquity, but of beauty, order, symmetry, In plebe nec veritas nec judicium;
inter saedam potentium adulationem, and praceps prostratorum odium, inanibus
studiis and inconditis motibus omnia miscent. Tacit.
and benefit; such as flow from both humane and divine wisdom; if popular
contempt and prejudices in some of the vulgar be any measure of things, or any
argument against any thing in Religion, or in the Church of Christ; it will
serve as well to vilify and nullify all Presbytery, and all Ministry, as all
Episcopacy. Indeed neither of them can preserve their honor, use, and
comeliness, if they exceed their proportions, and either dash against, or
incroach upon each other; contrary to those bounds and methods, which primitive
wisdom observed between power and counsel, Order and Authority, Community and
Unity. It is very probable, that a few years experience of the want of good
Bishops, will so reconcile the minds of sober and impartial Christians to
them, that few will be against them, save only such, who think the best
security for some of their estates to be the utter exploding, and perpetual
extirpation of Episcopacy; A thing which one of the wisest of mortals so much
abhorred, and for which he was able to give so good an account in Reason,
Piety, and true Polity; that it appears to have been not pertinacy and
interest, but judgment and conscience, that so long sustained that unhappy
Controversy, which I have no mind to revive, but only (if possible) to
reconcile, which is no hard matter where clear truths meet with moderate
affections, and peaceable inclinations. For I find by the proportion of all
Polity and Order; that if Episcopal eminency be not the main weight, and
carriage of Ecclesiastical government; yet it is as the Axis or wheel which
puts the whole frame of Church society and communion into a fit order and
aptitude for motion; especially in greater associations of Christians, which
make the most firm and best constituted Churches.

This being then the true figure of a learned, grave, godly and industrious
Bishop, there need not more be said to redeem Episcopacy from prejudices; or to
assert it against those trivial objections, which are not with truth and
judgment, so much as with spite and partiality made against it.

Those light touches which are by some men produced from the ancient Writers in
the Church, for the countenancing of the power of Presbyteries without any
Bishop and President, or for the Independency of power in Congregations, are
indeed but as the dust of the balance, or drops of a full bucket, compared to
those full and weighty testimonies, which they every where give, for the use of
Episcopacy, unless men be allowed the confidence and liberty to bastardise the
works of the Fathers as they list, and by a new purgatorian Index t^ antiquate
all Records after 1500. years legitimation, by the consent of all Churches; as
one lately has endeavored to do, D. Blondell.
(a person indeed of great reading and learning, but in this not of equal
candor and impartiality) who endeavoring to find some foundation, whereon to
build his Presbytery, seeks to cast away as rubbidg and trash, all the
Epistolary writings of holy Ignatius, Ignatius called (...).
who if he had wrote nothing, yet the fame of his piety, and sufferings made
him sufficiently renowned in those Primitive times and after ages, both for a
Bishop and a Martyr; his seat Episcopal being at Antioch, and his grave at
Rome; But his writings being never so far questioned by Antiquity, By Eusebius.

Ignatius.
as to reject those Epistles which we urge in this point of Episcopacy for
genuine: and which are often mentioned with honor, (and in part the very words)
which we now read; so that it seems a passion and boldness too servile to the
cause, which that learned man undertook; so to endeavor at once to expunge
those testimonies, and remains of Ignatius, which indeed are very weighty, and
many, for the distinction of Bishops, Presbyters, and Deacons, even in the
first century after Christ; which our learned and industrious Countryman Dr.
Hammond has lately, as ((...)) a valiant vindicator defended; not more to the
honor of Ignatius, than of himself, whom providence has chosen, and so
enabled to be a Patron to so glorious a Martyr, and in so just a cause, as to
redeem one of the first Fathers from that Presbyterian Limbo.

How uncomly, and petulant some other men's carriages have been, and are daily
toward the ancient Fathers of the Church, I need not tell, when it is too
evident, how they put them often on the rack, to make them speak, something in
favor for either an Headless Presbytery, or a confused Independency. Indeed,
it is a shame to see young men and novices, so to make those ancient, holy, and
learned Writers to scratch or blot their own faces, with their own Pens, and to
put out their Eyes with their own styles; wringing, as it were their noses,
till they bleed a drop or two for those new Modes and exotic forms of
Church Government, which neither they, nor their forefathers even up to the
Apostles times, ever saw or knew; And this tyranny of quotations must be
exercised upon the works of the Fathers, though never so much against the clear
judgment and practice of those holy men, who were themselves, either eminent
Bishops, as most of the Ancients were, whose Works are extant, or humble and
peaceable Presbyters, who universally owned and submitted to the authority of
their Bishops; yea, some men have the forehead to urge a few obscurer passages
in a few them against clear places, which are a hundred to one, wherein they
express their own judgments, or the whole Churches practice in their times, to
be without any dispute for Episcopacy, and Bishops with Presbyters as
succeeding the Apostolical eminency in the ordinary power of Ordination and
Church Government: Indeed, I have often wondered, how men of learning and piety,
had the confidence to cite testimonies even out of Ignatius, Tertullian,
Irenaeus, Origin, Cyprian, Clemens of Alexandria, Ambrose, Austin, and others
in favor of a Presbytery, without and against a Bishop or President, when all
of them, as all others of the Fathers are most clear, both in their own
judgments, and as to the Churches Catholic practice (yea, and so is St. Jerome
too) for the right use of regular Episcopacy, 5. Regulation of Episcopacy. Omni

such as all sober men plead for and approve.

What ever the Fathers are brought in, as speaking for the Ministers rights in
a joint Presbytery, or the peoples as for Independency, amount to no more, but
either to repress the arrogance, ambition, and tyranny of some Bishops, who in
more favorable times usurped, or used their power against, or with neglect of
the Counsel and assistance of Presbyters (which in all reason ought, and in
Antiquity were ever joined with the Bishop in weighty matters) or else when the
insolence and scorn of some Ecclesiastic governors arose to the oppression of
the faithful people; To whom in Primitive times great regard was had, both by
Bishops and Presbyters, in all public transactions, which concerned their, and
the Churches good government, that so all things might be done, with charity,
good liking, and approbation of all Christians. This was not only very comely
and convenient, but almost necessary in point of Christian prudence in those
times, when Christians of all degrees were full of humility and Charity, kept
short and low by persecution, and much depended upon the love and union between
Pastor and people. Afterward indeed in times of peace and plenty, there often
appeared so much of levity, fury, and faction in the common people, that it was
the wisdom of Governors to withdraw much of that liberty and indulgence, which
formerly people enjoyed, but afterward abused to Sedition, Fury and Murders in
their tumultuary motions, and clamorous Elections, This is all that ever I
observed from the Ancients, in favor of the Presbyters power in common with
Bishops, or of the faithful people; Namely, that they would have (after the
pattern of the Apostolic love, wisdom, and humility) all things of public
concernment, in the Church, to be so managed by the chief Governor or Bishop,
as neither Presbyters, nor People, should think themselves neglected, wherein
their suffrage, consent or approbation was fit to be had, but the one should be
used as brethren, the other as sons; which temperance I greatly approve.

It were endless and needless, to answer or excuse personal Errors in Bishops,
Bishops personal errors, no argument but of envy and malice against the office;
or those common inconveniences, which are prone to attend all Power and
superiority among men; For those are the fruits of Power perverted, of
Authority degenerating, of Governors ill governing themselves, through
personal errors and passions, or the corruptions and indulgencies of times;
but they are not by any wise and impartial man to be reckoned, as the genuine
and proper effects, of that order, government, and proportion, which is in
right Episcopacy (and which all reason, as well as Religion, allows to all
sorts of men and Christians) no more than sickness is to be imputed, as a fault
to health; or deformity to comeliness: since both are incident in humane nature
to the greatest strength or beauty. Yea, it is most certain, that there is
nothing useful, or commendable in any other way of governing the Church, in
small parcells, or in greater bodies, which is not inclusively, eminently, and
consummatively in a well-ordered Episcopacy; such as was not only in primitive
times, but in our days; As all Oeconomick virtues are in a good Father or
Master, and all politic excellencies are in an excellent Prince or Magistrate,
which cannot be found in any other short of, and inferior to those eminent
relations; All other lower and incompleater forms are, as defective in point of
advancing a common and public good, as they come short of that main end, for
with Episcopacy, as the Crown and perfectest degree of order was by
Apostolical and primitive wisdom; and piety, settled in the Church, which was
to avoid Schisms; to preserve the Unity of the faith, and peace of the
Churches; to keep good correspondencies by Synods and Councills; which could
not be done by multitudinous meetings, which no place could hold, nor wise men
manage to any order and decency; but all was easily effected by the conventions
of the chief heads and Fathers of the Churches, the Bishops and Presbyters in
any Province, Patriarchate, yea, and in all the world, which had commerce with
the Roman Empire; where the chief overseers of the Flock, and representers of
the Clergy met, and so were best able to give an account of the state of the
Church, past and present, or to advise for the future welfare of it.

So that many wise men think it may be said of Episcopal government in its
right const^^ution and use, Platins, in vita Pii. 2.
as Pi^^ the second said of the marriages of Clergymen; He saw some reason why
Marriage should be denied to them, (as, to the honor of their Order, and the
redemption of them from secular cares, etc.) But he saw much more reason to
allow them that liberty, which not only Nature, Reason, and Religion gives
them, as well as any men, but even the honor of the Church required, to avoid
the mischiefs and enormities, which followed the contrary. And beyond all
dispute, it appears after long dispute, that if it be not necessary by Divine
prescript and direction to have such Bishops among the Clergy; yet there is no
necessity made to appear against them, either in Reason or Scripture, Nor does
either Presbytery or Independency show any so good title to divine right as
Episcopacy does, which includes the good of both those, and superads some thing
of Order, Unity, and Excellency beyond them both, for the good of Presbyters
and people too, Yea, I have known some Ministers of good repute for Learning
and Piety, who were sometime great sticklers for the parity of Presbytery; yet
they have, since the mischiefs ensuing the change have confuted and quenched
those former vain hopes, and excessive heats, confessed to me, That they see
nothing in an Episcopal priority or Presidency unlawful, as against Scripture
or Religion, only it was thought by many godly men inconvenient; It may be so,
but those men did not foresee the after inconveniences which grow greater by
many degrees; So that I perceived that this long, hot, and bloody dispute,
which seemed to hold forth the question and title of Divine right for
Presbytery without a Bishop, was now referrable to the judgment of Prudence,
rather than of Conscience; a matter of policy rather than piety.

Answer to what is urged in the Covenant against Episcopacy. Tyrannicum
Episcoporum regimen.
This calmness at last abates much of that rigor, which some men superstitiously
urge, and impose, from the Covenant, against Episcopacy in any kind or form; as
if when Scripture and Reason, and Antiquity, and Catholic custom, are all
for a right Episcopacy, it were of any force to be battered and Abolished by
the Covenant; the sense of which, was sometime declared, to be only against the
Tyrannical, abusive, and corrupt government of Bishops, or those
inconveniences which were conceived to be in the present Constitution,
exercise, or use here in England, which one that had great influence in
composing the Covenant, assured others was the meaning of the Composers; and
the Covenants intent, was only to remove what was decayed in that ancient
Fabric, and so preserve what was sound and good in it: The only lawful and
honest sense of this Covenant is sufficiently kept, if the former Constitution
of Episcopacy in England be so reformed, as it easily may be, and in reason
ought to be in what ever it needed alteration or amendment. However that
Covenant being no infallible Oracle dictated from heaven; but a politic
Engine, continued and carried on by a company of poor, sinful, and fallible
men (upon whose heads we have lived to see that arrow fall, which they thought
to shoot, only against the face of Episcopacy) all its words and senses are
certainly to be brought to the rules of every man's place and calling, of a good
conscience, of right reason, and of Scriptures: Not may these, with all
Antiquity, and the Fathers, be forced to bow their sheafes, and to do homage to
that one Sheaf of humane Combination, and novell Erection, which holds forth,
as nothing for a headless Presbytery or Independency; So, nothing of Reason,
Scripture, or Conscience against a right and primitive Episcopacy; Against
which to make a Covenant of extirpation, must needs be so much a sin, as it is
against all reason and religion, to abjure the use of any thing which is
lawful, good and useful; And if it be not necessary, as of Apostolic and
divine Institution, if there be not Precept divine commanding, yet there is
clear practice directing the Church that way of Episcopal government as best;
which some men well knowing, to have bin anciently approved and constantly
followed by the Catholic Church; they used in the Covenant, that art against
Episcopacy, to soder Popery and Prelacy together, thereby to bring the greater
odium on Episcopacy, ^. Prelacy to Popery.
implying that they were both intolerable and inseparable; whereas in truth,
there is nothing more ridiculously false and absurd, than to think the Pope to
be the Father or Fountain of Episcopacy, or to affirm Prelacy to be Popery, as
now the word is commonly understood to signify Error joined with pride, and
superstition with tyranny. There were many godly Bishops, and holy Prelates in
the primitive Churches, which were equal, or preceding, in time (as at Antioch,
Jerusalem, Alexandria, etc. Episcopatus unus est cujus ingulis in s^^idum pars
temtur. Cyp. de un. Ecc.
) to any Bishop or Pope of Rome; Many afterward were equal to him in
authority, as to their several Provinces; Independent also, as to any
derivation of power from the Bishop of Rome; As there are now many in the
Christian world, and were in the English Church, both long before, and ever
since the Reformation. Nor is the Pope by any wise men called Antichristian in
any sense, as he is a Bishop, or Prelate of one Diocese or Province; Nor was
he ever thought to be so by any judicious Protestant; for then all Bishops in
all the world, as Bishops, had ever been Antichrists; and then, the whole
Church of Christ, from the Apostles times, must have had no other government,
ordination, or Ministry, but Antichristian, which is a most impudent and
intolerable blaspheming of God, and the Lord Jesus, and his blessed Spirit,
and of the whole Church; As if, Joh. 14.16.
in stead of the Spirit of Truth, it had received only the spirit of Error and
lying; in stead of Christ's being always with it, by the Ministerial gifts of
his Spirit, and the Apostles, and their Successors; Mat. 28.20. Ps. 2.6.
only Satan had presided in it by falsity and usurpation; and, as if in stead
of all the ends of the earth, given to Christ for his possession, in the way of
an Evangelicall kingdom and Ministry, where truth and righteousness, charity
and order, are his Throne and Scepter, all had been exposed to Antichrists
invasion, that he might rule and reign in Christ's stead.

It is upon other accounts than this, of being a Bishop or Prelate in a part of
the Church, that the Pope is by many charged with the odious character of
Antichristian, namely in reference to that ambition, pride, and usurpation,
which by fraud and force the Bishops of Rome have obtained, and challenge or
exercise over all the world, and specially over these Western Bishops and
Churches in later times; Greg. in Epist. 32. Mauritio 600. years after Christ.
namely, since Gregory the greats days (who was an humble, devout, and holy
Bishop; and had many pious martyrs, his Predecessors, as Popes or Fathers in
that See of Rome, who abhorred the name of Universal Bishops, affirming they
were Antichrist who ever arrogated that name of Universal Bishop;) Also for
those gross abuses, errors, tyrannies, superstitions, and persecutions, which
many Popes have made in the Churches of Christ, contrary to the word and
example of Christ, and the Canons of general Councils; From all which, we had
a Church and Ministry happily reformed, even by the care and constancy of many
holy and learned men, who were Bishops and Martyrs in this Church of England.
As then we do not abhor to be men, or Christians, because the Pope is a man,
and professes to be a Christian; So neither may we dislike Bishops, because
the Pope is one; nor Presbyters and Deacons, because there be many of that
title and office in the Church of Rome.

True Epispacy may consist, without secular and civil advantages.
But in the last place, if primitive Episcopacy, and Apostolical Bishops, now
poor, and divested of all secular power, and ornaments of honor and estate,
(and in this conform to their Predecessors in primitive and persecuting times)
may not in reason of state with public honor be restored, and established in
this Church of England, yet it may be hoped, that the Indulgence, and liberty
of times will give so much tolleration, That those whose judgments and
consciences bind them either to be so ordained Ministers, or to receive the
comfort of divine Ministrations only from such as are in holy orders by the
safe and ancient way of Episcopal Ordination, may have and enjoy that liberty
(without perturbing the public peace) which both Presbyterians and
Independents do enjoy in their new ways: For nothing will savor more of an
imperious and impotent spirit (whose faith and charity are slaves to secular
advantages and interests) than for those who have obtained liberty for their
novelties, to deny the like freedom to other men's Antiquity, which has the
Ecclesiastical practice and precedence of 1600. years; besides, the
preponderancy of much reason, Scripture, and holy examples; All which to force
godly, grave, and learned men, Ministers or people, to renounce; or to comply
with other ways against their judgments; or else to deprive them of all holy
orders, employments and ministrations in the Church, as Christians, cannot but
be a most crying and self-condemning sin, in those men, who lately approved
that ancient and Catholic way, and after dissenting, at first desired, but a
mod^st tolleration.

Since then the Pope, as a Bishop, is not Antichristian, as I have proved;
neither can it be affirmed with any sense or truth, that either Episcopacy it
self, or Bishops, Pastors and Governors in the Church are Antichristian; It
will easily appear to sober Christians, how poor, popular, and passionate a
calumny that is, which some weak minds please themselves to object against the
Ministry of the Church of England, as if it were Antichristian, because the
Ministers received their Ordination and Induction, both to the office and
exercise of their Ministry, by the hands and authority of Bishops, with those
Presbyters assistant who were present, which was the Universal practice of all
Churches anciently in Ordeining Presbyters, and is at this day of most. This
false and odious reproach of Antichristian Ministry, many Presbyters
preposterously seek to wipe off from the face of their Ministry, as they are
Presbyters, while yet with the same hand they make no scruple to besmear the
faces of Bishops and Episcopacy; Not considering, that while they poorly
gratify the vulgar malice of some men against all Bishops, they still sharpen
their spiteful objections against themselves as Presbyters.

As then this solemn and holy Ordination of Ministers by Bishops herein
England, by prayer, fasting, and imposition of hands, 7. Bishops in England

was Ancient and Catholic, no way against Reason or Scripture; yea, most
conform to both, in order to Gods glory, and the Churches welfare (which I have
already demonstrated;) So, I am sure in so doing, Bishops did no more, than
what their place, office, and duty required of them, here in England; according
to the Laws established, both in Church and State; which had the consent of the
whole Church and Nation, both Presbyters and people, as well as Prince and
Peers: No wise man may blame that act, Aequum est, (...), qu^m feceris
susserisve legem, feras. Reg. Jur.
or exercise of government and authority in an other, which he was invested
with, did enjoy, and acted in by public consent, declared in the Laws, wherein
each man's particular will is comprehended; nor may that be said to be a private
fault, which is done in obedience to a public Law; Bishops then, duly
ordeyning Ministers in the Church of England, had the approbation of this
Church and State, no less than of all Antiquity, and of all the Modern foreign
Churches, even those that have not Bishops, who yet ever commended and
applauded that Venerable Order, here in England; As for Scripture which some
pretend against Bishops, and for other ways, I never read any place commanding
any one or two, or more Presbyters, to ordein or govern in any Church without a
Bishop; Nor do I find any place forbidding a Bishop to ordein, and rule among
and with the Presbyters; According to that appointment of Timothy and Titus,
which is of all most clear, for investing both Ordination and Church
jurisdiction at that time eminently, (though perhaps not solely) in one man;
and if that Constitution in the Churches of Ephesus and Crete, carry not a
Precept or binding exemplariness with it to aftertimes, (which Antiquity
judged, and followed Universally,) yet sure it redeems true Episcopacy
sufficiently, and all good Bishops (in their right and moderate government of
the Church, (especially in this point of Ordeining Ministers) from being any
way Antichristian; to which we may be sure the blessed Apostle Paul would never
have given any such countenance or pattern, as that Jurisdiction and power given
to Timothy and Titus must needs be: Nor are indeed the reproaches of popish and
Antichristian, added by vulgar ignorance, or envy to Episcopacy, any other than
devilish, false, and detestable Calumnies, invented by wicked men, to the
reproach and blasphemy, not only of so many holy and worthy Bishops in all ages
and Churches, as well as in England, but also of that holy Spirit of truth, and
Ministerial power which Christ gave to the Apostles, and they to their chief
successors the Bishops; by whose learned piety and industry such mighty works
have been done in all ages, and in all parts of the Church, and in none more, I
think, than in this Church of England, chiefly since the Reformation of
Religion, whereto godly and learned Bishops contributed the greatest humane
assistance, by their preaching, writing, living and dying, as became holy
Martyrs.

I am vehemently for the ((...)) ancient and holy customs of the Catholic
Church, 8. Primitive Customs, how far alterable in the Churches Polity.

so far as they may be fitted to the state, and stature of any Christian
societies; Not that I think all things of external Polity, discipline, and
government, (by which Christians stand tied in relations public to one
another) were at first so at once prescribed or perfected by Christ, or the B.
Apostles, as might not admit after addition, variations, or completions in any
Church, or Congregation Christian, according to those dictates of reason, and
general rules of Prudence, which are left to the liberty of Churches; by which
so to preserve particular Churches, as not to offend the general rules of
order and charity, which bind them by conformity in the main; to take care of
the Catholic Communion. We are not (I think) tied so strictly to all the
precise paterns of primitive and Apostolical practice; which might well vary
in the several states, conditions, and dimensions of the Church. I read no
command for Presbyters to choose a Bishop, or President among them, and in so
not doing, they are defective, not as to the Precepts of Scripture; 1 Cor.
11.16. If any man l^st to be contentious, we have no such Custom, nor the
Churches of Christ. In his rebus de quibus nihil certi statuit Scriptura, mos

(...). Naz. Or. 34. (...). Naz. Or. 37.
but to the rules of right reason; and the imitation of useful example in
primitive times; Nor do I find any Precept to one or more Presbyters to ordein
others after them, who yet ought to take care both of their own being rightly
Ordained, and of after succession, according to that pattern, Analogy, and
proportion of holy order and government, which was at first wisely observed by
the Apostles, and the after Ministers of the Church, either as Bishops or
Presbyters. The same Coat would not serve Christ, a man grown, which did fit
him, a Child or Youth; Only it is neither safe, comely, nor comfortable for any
Christians, wantonly, and without great and urging reasons (next door to
necessity) to recede from, or to cast off the ancient and most imitable
Catholic customs of the Church: which truly is seldom done upon conscientious
and real necessities pressing, but most what upon factious humors, and for
secular designs carried on under the color of Church alterations. For how ever
the alteration may at present please some men's activity and humor, whose turn
it serves, yet it cannot but infinitely scandalize, grieve, and oppress, far
more, and better Christians, who are of the old, yet good way.

Hence many we see are at a loss now in England, how to justify their past
religion, shaken by changes, as if they had had no true Ministry, nor holy
Ministrations and Sacraments hitherto; while some men's zeal without knowledge
cries down Bishops, and that whole government with the Ministry for
Antichristian; others are extremely unsatisfied and solicitous for the future
succession, Not seeing any ground, for any Presbyters in this Church, so to
challenge to themselves a sole divine power of Ordination and Jurisdiction,
without any President Bishops: which was the ancient way in England, ever since
we were Christians, (as in all other Churches) And it is most sure, that
neither power of Ordination, nor Jurisdiction was ever conferred by Bishops on
any Presbyters here, either verbally or intentionally, as without and against
Bishops; Nor did the Laws or Canons ever so mean, or speak; Nor was it (I
believe) in any of the Presbyters own thoughts, that they received any such
power to Ordein other Presbyters without a Bishop, when they were Ordained
Ministers. And sure, though acts of state, and civil Magistracy may regulate
the exercise, yet they cannot confer the holy power, and order of a Presbyter
or Bishop, on any man, which flows from a spiritual head, even Jesus Christ (as
I have proved) and not from any temporal Authority; Ordinances of Parliament
can hardly with justice or honor, batter or dismount the Canons of general
Councils, the Catholic laws, or constant Customs of the Church. If it be
supposed, that the two Houses of Parliament lately did but restore, and the
Presbyters resume that power of Ordination, which was only due to them as such,
and detained by Bishops usurpation from them; Bo^a consuetudo, velut vinum

It is very strange, they should never here, nor elsewhere have made claim to
it, for 1600. years, in no ages past, till these last, broken, factious,
tumultuary, and military times; If it were their right, only in common with,
and subordinate to Bishops, they needed not then to complain, for they did, or
might have enjoyed, as much joint power, as was for their convenience, and the
Churches peace; The eminent power (at least for Order sake) was (even by their
consents) lawfully placed in, and exercised by the Bishops; The levity and
ambition of engrossing all to themselves without and against Bishops has
almost lost all power both of Bishops and Presbyters too; since Presbytery
alone, is but as Pipe-staves, full of cracks, warpings, and unevenness, which
will not easily hold the strong liquor of power and government, unless they be
well hooped about, and handsomely kept in order by venerable and fatherly
Episcopacy, which carried a greater face of majesty, and had those ampler and
more august proportions which ought to be in government, beyond what can be
hoped for, or in reason expected from the parity, and puerility of Presbyters
in common: many of whom have more need to be governed, than they are any way
fit to bear any great weight of government on their shoulders, however they may
discharge some works of the Ministry very well.

9. Calm mediations between Episcopacy and Presbytery.
As it has never yet been shown any where; so it is least to be hoped for now
in England, that any better fruits should arise from Presbytery (thus
beheaded, cropped, and curtayled of its crown Episcopacy) which it might not
still have (as formerly it has) brought forth; If the honor and order of the
highest branch, the Episcopal eminency, had been preserved with it: Not so as
to over-drop and oppress all other boughs and branches, which are of the same
root; but so, as to adorn them all; and to be most eminent in Christian graces,
and Ministerial gifts, no less than in priority of place, superiority of
power, and amplitude of honor and estate: As many Excellent Bishops, both
ancient and modern were, against whose incomparable worth, while some young and
petty Presbyters do scornfully declame, and disgracefully insult, they appear
like so many Jackdaws perking on the top of Paul's steeple, or like living Dogs
snarling at, and trampling upon dead Lions. Petulantissima est insaniae
paucorum malorum odio in bonos omnes dehac^hari.
Nor do indeed such impotent tongues, and miserable partialities of some men
tuned to the most vulgar ears and humors, against all, even good Bishops; and
against a right or regulated Episcopacy (such as was for the main and substance
here in England) they do not in any sort become men that pretend to any true
piety, learning, gravity, or civility.

I neither approve, nor excuse the personal faults of any particular Bishops,
as to the exercise of their power and authority, which ought not in weighty
matters to be managed without the presence, counsel, and suffrages of
Presbyters, such as are fit for that assistance; The neglect of this St.
Ambrose, and St. Jerome, and all sober men justly reprove, as unsafe for the
Bishops, the Presbyters, and the whole Church* For in multitude of counsel is
safety and honor too. Romans 11.14. I am sure much good they might all have
done, as many of them did, whom these touchy times were not worthy of; No
wonder if the very best of them displeased some men's humors, who were
impatient to be kept any longer in order; but, like waters, Hieron. Communi
concilio Praesbyterorum Ecclesiae regebantur. Concilio Carthag. 4. c. 3. Nil
faciat Episcopus, etc. (...), not other (Council. Ancyran.) assisted the Bishop
in government.
long pent up, they sweld to such discontents, as disdaining to pass the
allowed bounds and floudgates of public Laws, they resolved to blow up and
bear away the whole head and sluice of Government. Bishops had three Enemies to
contend with, some Presbyters ambition, some Laymens covetousness, and their
own Infirmities; And it may be Bishops faults had been less in some men's eyes,
if their estates and honors had not been so great.

I write not thus to reproach any of my Fathers or Brethren the Ministers, who
begin many of them no doubt to be of my mind for moderate Episcopacy, if they
have not always been so; finding that the fruit of the Summer, does not
always answer the blossoms of the Spring: cruel frosts may nip and blast
those pregnant hopes of bettering, which men are prone secretly to nourish,
whereby to excuse or justify their desires of change and novely. In which
truly I never saw any thing of right reason or religion, produced for the
extirpation of primitive Episcopacy. The main things that pressed upon it, were
Foreign power, domestic pride, the failings of some Bishops, the envious angers
of some Presbyters, and the wonted inconstancy of the vulgar.

If any men, Ministers or others, are, as loath to see and recant their excesses
and errors, as they were forward to run into them, but still resolve to keep
that partial bias on their judgment, which shall sway all their learning, and
other excellent Ministerial gifts against their own true interests, and this
Church, with all reformed Religion, which consisted in due moderation and
peace; I shall yet with my pity of their wilfulness or weakness, always love
and reverence what I see in them of Christ, and only wish that temper and
moderation from them, which may most contribute in common to the vindication of
the Order and Function of learned, grave, and peaceable ministers. This they
may at last easily see, That every soft gratification of vulgar ignorance,
envy, and inconstancy, set forth with the forms of zeal, and reformation, is
usually returned with vilifyings and diminutions of their betters; who did
vouchsafe to flatter them, as if they indeed feared them. I heartily wish a
greater harmony, a sweet moderation, and Fraternal accord among all true and
godly Ministers, who dare to own, and do still adorn their office and calling:
I should be glad to see the counsel and assistance of well settled Presbyters,
crowned with the order and luster of Episcopal presidency, which was
anciently, as the Jewel well set in a ring of Gold; or as a fair guard and
handle to a good Sword, adding to its compleatness, comeliness and usefulness.
Alas the ordinary Ministers seem now like younger brethren (who sometimes lived
handsomely under their Fathers, or elder Brothers care and inspection) so
scattered and divided, that they are extremely weakened, and exposed to all
injuries; Pro. 16.18. Pride goes before destruction, and an haughty spirit
before a fall.
yea, many of them like Prodigal sons, having riotously wasted their own and
their Fathers portion, begin to consider what husks of popular favor they may
feed on. So is Insolency the high way to indigence, and arrogance soon knocks
at the door of contempt, Ministers must not wonder or repine at the measure
they measured to others, when offered to themselves.

Secundas habeat poenitentiae tabulas qui non habuit primas impeccantiae. Amb.
I am far from reproaching any men's defeats or Calamities, wherein the Justice
of divine vengeance is seen retaliating; I am glad if the occasioners of our
common shipwreck, may have any fair planks, or rafters to save themselves, and
the honor of their Ministry, either by recanting the errors of their
judgments, or repenting the transports of their manners; If they retein their
Antiepiscopall opinion with modesty and charity, yet I am not disposed to fly
in any godly man's face, because he is not exactly like me, or to pull out his
eyes, Multa tolleramus quae non probamus. Aust.
because they are not just of the color of mine. I pray to be of that
Christian temper for moderation and charity which can allow many latitudes of
Prudence in extern things of religion, where no evident sins for their
immoralities, nor evident errors against the fundamentals of Christianity, nor
evident confusions against charity and order which is necessary for the
Churches peace, do appear. I wish that while Ministers or other Christians,
differ in things of extern mode and order, they may all find and walk in that
holy way, by which we may with one shoulder of truth and charity, carry on that
great work of saving Souls, both our own, and those that hear us; that while we
dispense saving truths to others, we may not for want of humility and charity,
be cast-aways our selves. More of those calming and moderating graces, on all
sides, had no doubt preserved both Bishops and Presbyters in their due place
regard and honor; so that they should not have been put thus to plead for
their Ordination and Ministry, or to play this after game, much to the hazard
of their very Function, and succession of Ministerial authority; The despising
or abolishing of which threatens the annihilating of the very being of this
reformed Church: in which the right Ministry, is as the Ark in Israel, 1 Samuel 4.
a visible token of Gods presence among Christians; And though the Philistines
may, for the sins of this Church, take it captive, and detein it for a while,
yet I believe, 1 Samuel 6.
the Lord will bring it back again, with shame to his enemies, and joy to all
true Israelites.

In the mean time this trouble and terror may be a means to a mend the
personal faults both of Bishops and Presbyters; which formerly might viciate,
but they could not totally vacate, the Religion, reverence, and con^cience,
which is to be had of Christ's institution, as to the Ministry; Personal faults
of Bishops or Presbyters may viciate, but not vacate divine duties. 1 Samuel 2.12.
nor yet could they make void the honor of Religion, nor the authority,
virtue, and efficacy of ho^y Ministrations; Where the persons du^^ ordained did
administer, and the holy things themselves were according to Scripture right y
administered, which always remain holy, whatever is objected against men's
persons administering; as sickness, lameness, or deformity deprive no man of the
privileges of humane nature, nor his actions of rea on nor his civil interest,
of the benefit of the Laws. Ely's scandalous sons, unworthy indeed of, but yet
rightly invested into the Priests office, did not take away the necessity, and
sanctity of the services and sacrifices, much less of the Priestly function;
which depended not on the morality of the persons administering, but on the
authority of the Lord commanding; and the right investiture into the office.
The miscarriages of Bishops or Ministers may take away the beauty, but not the
being of Religious duties, or of that holy power, which they duly received; no
more than lapses after Baptism, do unbaptise any Christian. No Christian thinks
the series of Christ's genealogy broken or blemished, corrupted or interrupted,
stained or maimed, by the names of Tamar, Rahab, and Bathsheba, which are links
in that h ly chain; which has its verity in the history, but its sanctity from
Christ, to whom it relates, as to the holy seed: So in the succession of
Ministerial order and authority, we dispute not by what personal virtues it
was continued; but we are sure it has been continued successively from Christ,
and tends to him, as to the completing of his second incarnation, in his body
the Catholic visible Church; In which Christ is daily begotten and formed by
the means of a right Ministry, and duly ordained Ministers. 10. Of Ordination
of Ministers. Where Bishops are Orthodox and may be had, Ordination cannot
regularly be had without them Vbi Episcopi desunt nec haberi possent, Orthodoxi
Pre^byteri in necessitate ordinare possunt. Sarav. de grad. Mi. So Bishop
D^wnham Con. in Apocal. Or by the Bishops authority delegated, as to the
Chorepiscopi, who were but Presbyters. Isid. Hippa. de Eccl. off.


Whether Bishops ordained Presbyters, as Prelates, in a superiority of divine
power and peculiar order, as succeeding the Apostolical eminency (which
antiquity for the most part thought,) looking on Episcopacy in ordination,
confirmation, and jurisdiction, not as the only, but as the highest branches of
Church power lineally descended from the Apostolical ordinary power of ruling,
and governing the Church,) or whether they did those acts of power and
authority only as chief by Ecclesiastical right, in degree, and order of place
among the Presbyters, as chosen or approved by them, and placed in a precedence
of place, and presidency of action and inspection; but still of the same
intrinsecall power and order Ministerial, as to the first act or original, I
need not further gratify any man's curiosity in setting down my opinion.

Ecclesiasticaru^ regularu^ amussim factam non dixerim; Aut in ea institutum ab

Hierom. page 255. St. Paul's Epistle to Tim. and Tit.
This I am sure; What ever dirt and mire, the restless hearts of wicked men cast
up against the calling of the Ministry in England, The Gospel, and the holy
Institutions of it appointed by Christ to be dispensed to all the world, have
never in any other way been derived to this long succession, save only by the
power of ordination; which never was in ordinary cases believed or owned in the
Church to be valid and effectual, in any men, or from any hands, but those,
who were formerly consecrated Bishops, or ordained Ministers; Nor was this
custom ever esteemed as the act of any general Council or Ecclesiastical
Canon; but it had both example, and precept, and constant succession from
Christ to the Apostles; and from them to others, with a command of
continuation; which was necessary for the Church, and ever most conscienciously
observed in the Church; which never flourished better, than when the modesty,
humility, and wisdom of Presbyters, joining with and submitting to their Bishop
(as fellows to the Master of a College) carried on that order, peace, and comely
proportion in the Church (before all the world) that they were, in the first
century, compared by Ignatius for their harmony to the strings well set, and
tuned on the Harp; Ignat. Ep. ad Ephesians. (...). Epist. ad Smyrn. (...).
yea in an higher strain, he compares them to the blessed accord between the
Father and the Son; Christ as man mediator and God; where in the sameness of
the divine nature, yet there is the order and priority of relation.

These were the ancient pipes and conduicts of Ministerial Ecclesiastical
power, which were first laid in the head and fountain Christ Jesus; after
branched to all places by a continual order and derivation of Ministerial
authority; Where the pipe is once broken, there the stream of living waters
must needs fail: If any foulness flows, or obstructions have befaln these pipes
of due ordination (as all that passes through earthen vessels is prone to do,
in time,) which Christ and his Apostles have laid to serve his Church with the
living waters of grace and truth, and which have flowed these sixteen hundred
years to the refreshing of infinite souls; yet we must not cut them off, nor
quite stop them, or turn the waters another way; (as choosing, rather
Independent wells, and broken Buckets,) but we ought to cleanse those pipes,
and repayr those conduicts, which only can hold, and convey that holy water (as
the vessels of the Temple) restoring them to their Primitive use and integrity:
Which, by Gods help is easily done, where pride, passion, policy, and worldly
interests are really separated from those of Christ, his Church, and men's
souls. Nothing were more happy, than to see this sincerely done; so that
Christians would rather deny themselves, in profit and worldly advantages, than
any way benefit or gain, by Church Reformations; than which, nothing is more
sordid and more to be abhorred: contrary to the holy liberality of all good
Christians in all times. If Ananias and Saphira were smitten for dissembling,
how much more accursed are they who act all with a sacrilegious Spirit and
hand, stripping and robbing the Church, instead of Reforming? I shall ever pray
for just and liberal Reformations, while I live; mean time I rest satisfied in
my conscience, That the ordination of Ministers, as it was in England, by a
Bishop and Presbyters, as it has the greatest regularity, so it has the
greatest validity, and admits the least dispute, as to the right order and
succession of Ministerial power.

As for the Presbytery and Presbyters, I think their Ministry very valid, and
their authority very venerable, (...). Ign. ad Ep. (...). Id. ad Smyr. (...),
Ign. ad Ep.
to all true Christians, especially in conjunction with their Bishop: Like
Tortesses they were safest, while they keep under that shell; which some
Presbyters having scornfully cast off as a burden, striped themselves of their
shield and defense, so that they are become very naked, feeble, and contemned
creatures, whom the foot of pride and rusticity is prone to crush and trample
upon on every side: That they have now no refuge or protection left, but God,
and a good conscience; which are enough, if they do indeed enjoy them, though
with poverty, and contempt from men.

Thus I have, as well as I had leisure, vindicated the Ordination of Ministers,
and that power which they have to administer holy things, in Christ's name to
this Church, to be no way blameable, but right and commendable, as derived by,
and with the hands of Bishops and Presbyters; which is the holy and Catholic
way, wherein only it is ordinarily to be obtained: 1 Cor. 11.16. Aust. cont.
Don. l. 4.
if any men list to be contentious for other ways, my answer with St. Paul is
again and again, neither we nor the Churches of Christ ever had any other
custom, and with St. Austin, so Catholic a custom, 11. Of the peoples power in
Ordination of Ministers
so agreeable to reason and Scripture, could have no beginning but Christ and
his holy Apostles.

There is yet one Calumny more against the Ordination of our Ministers in the
Church of England; which pretends the neglect among us of what is by some
thought most essential in making a Minister; that is, of the peoples right
both in choosing and ordeining men to that office; the want of which, they say,
makes our Ministry invalid.

Answ. For this pretended right of the people no argument is alleged, so
strong, as that of liberty, which some have taken in these times, to separate
themselves from the ordinary Ministry of this Church, and by a mutual call of
one an other to jugg themselves, like Partridges, into small coveys; which they
call bodies or Churches, even before they have any Minister; which they resolve
not to have, but of their own choosing, and ordeining; that they may be sure,
(being a creature of their own) to have him after their own humor: flattering
themselves, that they have a plenary Church power to all Offices and ends
whatsoever. Although I have formerly given some general account of the folly
of this imagination in the vulgar; yet because it is a Gangrene, not easily
cured, without often lancing and opening, and has far prevailed upon some
peoples minds, who feed this opinion, with the venomous and vulgar humors of
pride, self-loving, self-seeking, self-pleasing, self-flattering, and
self-admiring; It is not a miss to give another stroke at this high
imagination, which exalts itself against Christ, and the holy order of his
Church; that the obstinacy of its arrogance and folly being pulld down, it may
be levelled to that obedience, which becomes all Christian people.

People have no power Ministerial.
First, then, I must profess, that I never saw or heard any thing by any man,
with any show of Scripture, or reason, urged to prove this power of conferring
the holy order and authority of a Minister of Christ, to be in the people,
Either eminently, as an executioners power is in the supreme Judge; or
virtually, as life is in the Suns beams; or formally and causally, as heat is
in the fire; or ordinatively, preceptively, and derivatively, as the supreme
Magistrates power is to some ends, Numb. 16. The Preface to Korahs rebellion,
and confusion, is the peoples sanctity. v. 3.
and actions, in the meanest Constable, or public Officer; So that it can be
in them no other way, than, as power may be in rebels hands; or as Korah and
his accomplices, if they had not been by God repressed, would have had liberty
and authory, from their own usurpation, to make Priests and Rulers instead of
Moses and Aaron, whom the Lord had appointed.

Not by Scripture.
For Scripture, First it is evident in that ((...)) divine pattern of polity and
extern order of Religion in the Church of the Jews, we find that the wisdom of
God leaves nothing of holy concernments, for Priests or Ministry, no nor the
least sacrifice, offering, or ceremony, to the peoples, either ordering, or
choosing; Nor is it likely, or any where appears, that the unchangeable wisdom
of God in Christ, altering only the manner external, and not the order,
beauty, holiness, Phil. 4.8. (...). Cl. Al. (...). 5. A multitudine abhorret
maxim vera Philosophia. Lact. Inst. l. 3. c. 25. e Ciceron. Vulgar heads, like

divinitatis injuria. Salv.
or the main end of the service and Ministry Christian (which his glory and his
Churches good,) should so much vary from the former exactness and wariness, as
to venture the order, beauty, and honor of Religion upon the rock of vulgar
rudeness, ignorance, rashness, headyness, stiff-neckednes; which formerly he so
much avoided, and which, not only the tenderness of Christian Religion, (which
having many enemies, admits least blemishes, and studies most, what things are
comely, as well as holy) but even common reason, and experience teaches, all
wise men to avoid, as much as possible; Namely those inconveniences and
mischiefs attending the weak heads and strong hands of the vulgar, as in all
things, so chiefly in those which concern Religion. Who, that is wise, can be
ignorant, that the common people, even among believers and professors, are
seldom or never qualified with those gifts of knowledge, wisdom, temper and
discretion, which are necessary for all public, and most, for religious
administrations; where, not only the credit, but the conscience of the Church
is engaged, and ought to be very much considered, in order to the honor of
Christ, and of his Church? It were a very blasphemous reproach, I think, to the
wisdom of Christ, for any to imagine, that he had delegated the highest power
of his Church to men incompetent, and generally incapable, without daily
miracles.

Besides this, if they were supposable to have those gifts, which were fit to
try and judge rightly of a Ministers sufficiency; yet they cannot have power to
authorize or ordein a Minister of Jesus Christ; no more than every judicious
man has power to send an Ambassador in his Princes name; or to make such
arbitrators and Judges, as he thinks fit in other men's business: This is a
power only to be used and enjoyed by those, to whom it is given, from him, who
is supreme, as in the Church Jesus Christ is: in whom the grand power of
Ordination, which confers on man authority to dispense holy mysteries in
Christ's name is originally seated, and from him derived and granted as a grand
Charter or Commission to his Apostles, first; and by them afterward exemplified
and delivered to others, who being found fit for it, were assumed into, and
invested with, the same delegated authority, as from Christ, and never given to
the community of the people, at any time, or derivable from him in any degree
of power Ministerial, be their gifts and graces never so good; Since this is a
fruit of Christ's wisdom, munificence, and power toward his Church: an
appointment full of holy order, and divine polity; depending on no private men's
gifts or graces, but upon the good will, pleasure, and power of Jesus Christ
himself, as he stands in the relations of King, Priest, and Prophet to his
Church.

Now to whom Christ committed this great and sacred power, of ordeining a
constant succession of Ministers in his name, and in what manner it was by them
derived to others, Page 143. etc. in the answer to the first Objection. See Dr.
Hammond and Dr. Tailor of Ordination. Correxerunt manus, psephisma natum est.
Tull.
I have already cleared (I hope) and other late writers have done it too by
Scripture, reason, and Ecclesiastical Catholic Custom; In all which, it is
evident, That the so much urged (...) and (...) (which properly indeed
signifies peoples suffragating by stretching forth of hands in public and
popular elections) is not to be urged by a Critical severity, from the Ethnic
sense of the word, to the Churches injury and confusion; Since the same word in
sacred and Ecclesiastical writings, as well as in others, is often used in a
sense which signifies nothing else but an appointment or designation made by
any one or more to some special work and service, to which God, or Christ
Jesus, Acts 14.22.
or the Apostles, jointly, or severally, or their successors the Bishops and
Pastors of the Church in their several precincts, are said, to ordein, or
appoint, a part from any such suffrage, or autoritative influence of the
people; Further than their sometimes nominating and recommending fit men to be
ordained, as Acts 6.5. or else their comprobation and acceptance of those, who
were by the Apostles, Elders, and Rulers of the Church ordained, as Ministers
over them; and this in Christ's name; by a divine authority; which is for the
peoples good, but not from them, as a fountain; nor by them, as any fit Pipes
or Conduict, through which this holy stream of the Ministry, Ordinationes eorum
quam temerarie, tam inconstantes; Hodie Episcopus cras alius, bodi^ Presbyter
qui cras laicus: Nam and laicis Sacerdotolia munera injungunt. Tertul. ad

^^o and tolis est disciplina. Tert^l.
or the pure waters of the Sanctuary are to flow: So that I cannot look upon
this late arrogant claim of the power of ordeining Ministers, as primarily
belonging to the common people, or to other Laymen, as other than a fashion or
opinion only befitting, and extremely resembling, those giddy, proud, and
preposteous fancies, to which vulgar minds are subject (as Tertullian tells us)
when once the reigns of Church Discipline are let loose; or some headstrong
Schismatics, get the bridle between their teeth: yea and it daily confutes it
self; while the Authors and followers of it, are continually dividing and self
confounding: So inconsistent is error, not only with Truth but with it self;
easily mouldring with its own weight and weakness. And no wonder if the Lord
prosper not projects arising from popular pride and presumption, and tending to
the shame and confusion of true Religion: which no right reason, or order; no
Scripture precept or pattern; no Ecclesiastical custom, or learned, and godly
man's judgment, did ever allow, or can with any reason: as carrying with it all
manner of rusticall, unreasonable, and irreligious absurdities; which are never
wanting, where vulgar passions dwell, as infallibly they do, in the meaner
sorts of men, pretend they to what sanctity they will; It will soon appear in
how many and great defects they come short of that wisdom, gravity,
unpassionateness and impartiality, which is necessary to manage and order
public holy actions; 2 Cor. 5.20.
and to confer a solemn Religious power to any in Christ's name, to do Christ's
work, and in some sense to be in Christ's stead.

Wise, humble, and truly gracious Christians, Best Christians are most modest.
are of all men most remote from such bold and unsuitable undertakings; whereto
having no call, from God, or the Church, they can never expect blessing on
their adventures and rash endeavors: It satisfies them, that they have, as
much influence in the ordeining and choosing of Ministers, as they are capable
of, and is best for them and the Church: Yet, if it will please these
Christians to fancy that they have some degree of power even in making their
Ministers here in this Church, they may consider, Ministers in England ordained
with the peoples consent.
that neither Bishops nor Presbyters in England made any Ministers without the
peoples general consent, expressed by those Laws and civil sanctions, which
confirmed here, that divine order and constitution, which they saw Christ had
settled, and the Church always followed in ordeining lawful Ministers, by that
wisdom and authority which from the Apostles was derived in a constant
succession of Bishops and Presbyters; who were for gifts of knowledge and
judgment best able, and for lawful power only able, by examination,
benediction, and imposition of hands to consecrate any man a Minister, and
confer the power of Holy Orders on him; who yet did, and do this, as Delegates
for the Church, but from Christ.

If the power of choosing and ordeining Ministers were wholly left in Laymens
hands, what a sorry choice (for the most part) would they make of the Man or
Minister? how weakly would they examine his sufficiencies? how wildly would
they Institute and Ordein him? what sad and slovenly hands would they impose on
him? how soon would they reject and disdain those Blocks they had so hewn to
be their Mercuries? and the Idols they had set up for their Seers and
Shepherds, which many times can neither sec, nor hear, nor rightly understand
the Mysteries of Religion, nor the Duties of the Ministerial Function? who
sees not that common people are rather taken with a familiar Rusticity in a
Minister, Vulgus vulgaria omnia inpensius amat and amplectitur; Eminentiora and
exortia potius admiratur qua^ amat; non raro odio and invidia and calumniis
tanquam ostracismo suo prosequitur.
than with the best learned abities; prefering, oft-times, a confident
Mechanic to be their Teacher, before the compleatest Divine in a Country? They
judge not what is worthiest, but what is fittest to their humors: rejoicing
more in the knack, which they fancy, of Church Power and Liberty, (though it be
to their prejudice) than in what may really advance their souls good, with just
Authority; receiving more willingly one that comes in his own name, as gifted;
or in their name, as chosen and ordained by them, than if he comes in Christ
name, and by that right Ordination, which has always been in the Church of
Christ.

Certainly, common people may as well be their own Preachers, and Baptisers in
course one after another; as ordein of themselves any one to be their Preacher;
what hinders they may not all exercise that power, as Ministers, which they
presume to give to another? which they cannot do, if they have not that power
in themselves: and if they have all this power of the Keys as Stewards and
Ministers of holy things, then it is not true that Christ has given ((...) only
some, Ephesians 14.11. 1 Cor. 12.28.
but (...) all) to be Apostles, Pastors and Teachers; So that every part in the
body may challenge to be an eye, and to have visuall power: which piece of
profane confusion, was never acted, or allowed in the Church, by any, that
were worthy to be listed among sober Christians, or well-ordered Churches: who
owned in all ages their calling to be Christians, and their gathering to the
body of the Catholic Church (as parts and members) not to their own good
nature, or preventive forwardness, making to themselves a Minister for Christ;
but to those true Ministers pre-ordeined by the Church, and sent by Christ to
them, while they sought not after him. These were in time, and order of nature,
before the people, as spiritual Parents: by whose Ministry they were taught,
Baptized, and made Christians; formed, guided, and governed in the things of
God: so that the power of a Minister must needs flow from an higher fountain,
Jesus Christ, and be conveyed by an other Conduict to the people, than by the
people, Who can originally no more confer the power of Ordination to Ministers,
than Children can give a parentall power, and authority to their Parents; or
the vessels formed, can give a formative power and skill to the Poeter.

12. Peoples relation to their Ministers.
The peoples calling to themselves, and electing a Minister, that is rightly
ordained; or accepting such an one, who is according to Laws both Civil and
Ecclesiastical sent among them, to be their Minister; is but a matter of
humane prudence and civil compact, as to that particular place and people. An
owning and acknowledging of that power, which he has from Christ, by the hands
of Church Rulers, to officiate, as a Minister of Christ for their good: It is
not an induing with power, but merely an appropriating of the exercise of his
power Ministerial to such a place, and such a people, for order and
distinction sake; to avoid rambling, and confusion in the Church; It is not any
conferring of the Office, function or habitude of a Minister to any person, who
is a Minister ordained for the service of the Catholic Church, over all the
world, wherever the Gospel may be Preached, the Sacraments administered, and
other holy offices performed in a right and orderly way: Which vast power and
authority, extending to all Nations, and every creature under Heaven, Mat.
16.15.
capable of the Gospel, far exceeds any proportion of power, that can be
imaginable, in any handful of private Christians in one place, and can only be
from the Catholic power of Christ, and that grand Commission, first given from
Christ (to whom the ends of the Earth belong) to the Order Ministerial, and by
those of that Order preserved to this day, and never claimed in common, but by
the irregularity, ignorance, or impudence of some few men, of these last and
perilous times.

For how ever the faithful people, in some places during the times of
primitive persecution (which kept all sides more humble and holy) did oft-times
express by their presence, their love and respect to their Bishops and
Presbyters, by a cheerful concurrence with them in matters tending to the
public order and peace, Crysost. was accused for privately Ordeining. (...).

and good government of the Church, so far as their discretion and modesty
thought decent, and acceptable to their Governors and Pastors (In the Election
of whom, they had something of approbative suffrages, consent, or nomination)
yet did they never presume to challenge any Power of Ordination, to be in, or of
themselves, but requested and obtained it, for those (whom they thus chose or
approved) from the hands of such rulers in the Church, in whom the power
Ministerial was deposited, and always conserved. It was enough for the
faithful flock to be quietly present at Ordination, to join in prayer and
fasting with the Ordeiners, to attest the merit of those whom the Bishop with
the Presbyters declared to be Candidate^ or Probationers, and Expectants of the
holy power of Ministry; which to confer, the common people have as much to do,
as Saul or Uzziah had to offer Sacrifice or Incense.

What may be don in cases extraordinary, In ordinandis Clericis fratres
charissimi solemus vos ante consulere, and mores ac merit singuloru^ communi
consilia ponderare. Cyp lib. 2. ep. 5. (...). Theop. Alex. Austin. ep. 180 ad
Honoratum, Denies that M nisters may leave the flock destitu^e of debitum and
maxim necessarium Ministerium, that Ministre which is most d^e and necessary
for their souls in times of d^nger and persecution, unless the office be
suppliced by some fit Ministers, while others by consent, or lot, fly to
preserve a stock of Bishops and Ministers.
and of absolute necessity, or destitution, where Christians already baptized,
and believing, cannot have a Minister in a regular way, I leave to Gods
direction, and his special dispensation, who in Cases extraordinary, may
extraordinarily manifest his pleasure. I am sure in the hottest Persecution,
which worried and scattered the flock of Christ, when it was most innocent; the
sheep neither chose, nor followed any other Shepherds, than those, which St.
Austin calls most necessary for the Church, without which it cannot subsist, of
whose Ordination and due authority they had assurance by constant Succession
and according to the true pattern in the Mount; but they chose rather to supply
the necessitated absences of their true Ministers, Bishops, and Presbyters, by
prayer, fasting, meditation, reading, Christian conference, and mutual
exhortation, than to set up among themselves any Minister, by their own power,
of popular Ordination; Yea (as the Jews would have done in the defect of holy
and Consecrated fire) Christians rather contented themselves with the Vote and
desire, or purpose of Sacraments, without the actual perception of them, (or
any other fruits proper to the Ministerial function and power,) rather than
offer with strange and unholy fire; where they could not have those Ministers,
whose lips had been touched with a ceal from Gods altar, that is ordained by a
right Consecration; which holy fire has never yet been quite put out in the
Church of Christ; nor ever will be, however some men's petulancy and presumption
seeks to spit, or piss it out, by their irreligious, ungrateful, and
contemptuous carriages against the office and due Succession of the Ministry.

Humble and wise Christians willingly look back to the Rock whence they were
hewn; and the pit whence they were dug: There they discern, Mat. 28.19. Go
therefore and teach all Nations, etc. Joh. 20.21. As my Father sent me, even so
send I you. Is. 65.1. Sub assistentis plebis conscientia. Cyp.
That it was not the people, who made to themselves Ministers, but Ministers
sent by Christ and the Apostles, every where made people Christians; They that
sat in darkness had light brought to them, and were found of God by his
messengers, as Shepherds sent to the lost sheep, who sought not after God;
That the holy succession of Ministerial and Church power, is indeed for the
peoples good, and ought in some cases be carried with the peoples approbation,
but it is not at all from the peoples pleasure, will, or virtue. That Jesus
Christ, the Apostles, and all after Churches ever carried this Ministerial and
Church power in another way, distinct and apart from the people, yet most
convenient for them, and most agreeable both to right reason, and to the order
and honor of true Christian religion; which requires, that holy things be done
with all beautys of holiness, by able and wise, and worthy men; to choose and
appoint, or ordein whom, supposes as able at least, if not abler than they are,
to judge of them; yet mere abilities as I have showed will not serve neither,
to give to others any commission as Ministers of holy things, unless the givers
have first a grand Commission, or power of so doing, committed by others to
them, which carries the strength of an original divine Authority ascending to
christ.

Which power, especially as to Ordeining of fit Ministers, being thus severed
from the people for 1600. years, without any complaint made by the faithful,
or claim of right by reason or religion; there is no cause Christians should
now listen to that fury, folly and faction, which would lay all in common:
since nothing is brought by these Commoners to repeal the first divine
enclosure of it, by the Institution of Christ, or to take away the prejudice of
so many Centuries peaceable possession, as a peculiar to the Church Officers;
those of the Ministerial Function; In which there has never been any
cessation or interruption, as to legitimate succession, and constant Ordination.

Not that we deny (for any thing shall be granted to faithful Christians,
People least able or fit to make or Ordein a Minister.
which is for their good) but that Christians of a particular parish or
Congregation, may (if they have not otherwise tied themselves, and restrained
things by Laws, with are the publiques, and so the Peoples consent; (as here
for the most part in England it was) they may orderly choose, and desire such a
man to be made a Minister or Bishop, and to be over them in the Lord, (as the
people of Millan did St. Ambrose, yet a Layman and Magistrate;) Yet this is
only so far, as first to recommend him to those, who have power to ordein him a
Minister of the Catholic Church of Christ; next, to acknowledge that power and
office Ministerial to be rightly in him, as conferred to him by just hands.
They may choose him, thus Ordained, to exercise his Ministry and Office by
particular care, mutual relation, and joint consent among them; But still this
is as far from any such (...), as some interpret it, as amounts to peoples
giving Ministerial power or Orders, as it is from Soldiers giving a
Commission, when they only present by way of Commendation and Petition a worthy
person to the General, or Commission officers to be made their Captain, which
neither his worth, nor their willingness makes him to be without express
Commission from the General under his hand and Seal. Nor is this any thing to
the diminution of peoples rational or religious liberties as Christians or men
(which regulations and restraints they may not grudge to suffer, if Christ will
have it so; as in this his will and command is most clear) but it is a fruit of
Christ's wisdom, and care for the faithful peoples good, to avoid infinite
inconveniences and confusions, which constantly and unavoidably attend all
things, that are transacted or touched almost by the common peoples hands and
heads; who, though they mean and begin well, (as the Sea by modest lickings and
slidings over the banks, which afterward its fury overbears with horrible
inundations) yet are they never to be trusted with any thing, which a wise and
good man would have well done.

As then we see no Church power, especially as to Ordination and Ministry, is
naturally in Christian people, In causis fidei vel Ecclesiastici muneris cum
judicare debere qui nec munere impar est, nec jure dissimilis, constantur
assero. Dictum. Imperat. Valentini and patris, quod Ambros. vehementer laudat.
l. 5. Ep. 32.
who must be considered after their Ministers in time, and that order of nature
which is between Effects and Causes, Children and Fathers, being first made
Christians by Ministers whom they never Ordained, nor so much as dreamt of or
desired: So, nor can it in any reason be thought, by Christ afterward committed
to them; least of all may they arrogate it to themselves, or involve it in any
inferior kind of civil and sociall power, which they may in some cases have;
Since this power of sending and Ordeining Ministers to teach and rule the
Church, is as far divided from that of peoples choosing, approving,
recommending or accepting one rightly ordained, as the waters above the
firmament, are from those beneath, in the Sea or Earth; what faithful people
may prudently do in private Church Matters, within their sphere, is rather a
power sub^ective, obedientiall, and conformative (as that of the matter to the
form) than Mandatory, Operating, and Authoritative; what they do discreetly, as
to advise, choose or agree with any Minister, is rather a common act of reason
and polity as men, than proper to them as Christians in piety, and is so far
commendable as they advise, choose or agree in things of external use, for
their own good, yet no way troubling the Churches common welfare, order, and
peace, nor arrogating that spiritual and internal power Ministerial, either
to make, or act as Ministers: which is from an higher principle, than Nature,
Reason, or the will of man: People having no more power to Ordein, send, and
Consecrate true Ministers, or Invest them in that Authority, Joh. 20.21. A my
Father sent me, so send I you.
than they had to Anoint, or appoint the Messiah; and they may as well set up a
new Christ, and new Gospel, as a new Ministry, and new Ordination; which
Christ only has once done, for all places and times, to the end of the world
(at least as to ordinary cases, when right succession of power Ministerial may
be had) and this without troubling, or interessing the common people in the
business, to whom Ministers dispense not the peoples own, but the grace of
Christ; 1 Pet. 4.10. As good stewards of the manifold grace of God. Ephesians. 4.11.
Christ gave some Apostles and Pastors, and Teachers. People may as well make
Apostles as ordinary Pastors or Ministers, which are all from Christ.
of which among other gifts and graces as means, this is one; To give Apostles,
etc. Pastors and Teachers to the Church; How can people primarily give power,
to celebrate Mysteries, to Consecrate Elements, to confer Graces; which are so
much above their thoughts, desires and merits? And who have no other way to
order, regulate, and manage any of their Elections, undertakings, and affairs
civil and secular, in what ever they pretend to have power, (which I think
best, when it is least) but only that, of the major part, of numbered voices, or
by the Pole; If this does not suffice to decide their affairs, then the more
hands and stronger party (which is often the worst) carries it, against the other
fewer and weaker, which may be, and most-what are the best and wisest; Neither
of which ways of decisions (which are often worse than that of blind Lots and
Chance, (which many wise men rather chose, than otherways to determine matters
by the uncertain and dangerous way of popular suffrages) can seem so Infallible
and divine, as to induce a wise man to acquiesce in them, as Gods appointment;
when very often they come far short of those rational and moral proportions,
which a good man would require in judging of, and preferring always, the best
and most deserving men: sober men would never have matters of Consequence left
to the most voices of the vulgar, or to their Counter-scufflings and brutish
contentions, As among the Cyclops where, (...).
which often show that there is little of God in their herds and crowds, and
clamors, more than may be in storms and tempests.

How unlikely is it, that Jesus Christ should entrust these Plebs or people
every where with power to choose and ordein Ministers of his Church, in order to
save souls? when the community have no other way in this Sacred concernment of
men's souls, but such as they use in their most trivial transact^ngs of humane
affairs; As if it were all one power, which enables them to make a Minister of
Christ's Church, with that which makes a Mayor, a Bailiff, or a Constable, in a
Corporation. In those few experiments which the wisdom of this Church, or the
lenity of some Patrons has thought fit to give men of Popular Elections of
their Minister, I have known, where a Parish rejecting a very able man offered
them, have with great earnestness desired, and with as much greediness as the
Whale did swallow Jonah, received a Minister of far less worth, who was of
their own choice, yet within two or three years they have cast him out on dry
land, and with scorn reproached and rejected him, who was so lately their
delight and darling.

The greatest enemy of the Gospel of Christ, and of the reformed Religion
would wish no greater advantages against true Religion, than to have the
Ordination, choice and appointment of Ministers left to the Common people in
every place, which will soon be filled with as much ignorance, fury, faction,
error and confusion, as either Devils or Antichrists would desire, whereby to
make Bethel Bethaven, and to set up Babylon in the midst of Jerusalem; Yea, the
peoples very bare Election of one rightly Ordained to be their Minister, often
occasioneth very great thoughts of heart, and uncomfortable divisions, between
both the people in their parties, and the Minister so chosen by some, but not
by others; To prevent which inconveniences, and sometime mischiefs, the wisdom
both of Church and State, had by consent of all estates, People, Peers, and
Prince, settled that in a far quieter and safer way of Presentations, to the
content of Patrons, Ministers, and all sober Christians.

I may then conclude, that as Bishops and Presbyters joynt^y ordeining others
to that holy Office, whereto themselves were formerly Consecrated, did as much,
and no more than was their duty to Christ and the Church; So neither the Pope
of old, had beyond his Diocese, nor the People now, have any thing to do with
this Ordinative power which duly is in the Ministerial order of the Church, by
which an holy succession of able, true, and faithful Ministers, Bishops and
Presbyters, has been continued in all Churches, and as yet is in this Church;
What ever the Papal pride and usurpation as any way eminently Antichristian,
in former or later times* or Schismatic and unruly people now, as the many
Antichrists, in the Diametral distances of their errors, (being the two poles
of Church pride, but not the axis of Church power,) have or do pretend, as if
all Church power were in them, or from them; it was and is all nothing else but
vain shadows, and mere mistakes arising from the ignorance, darkness,
connivence, licentiousness and superstition of times, and is no more
prejudicial to the true power of Ordeining Ministers, (which is from Christ
only committed to the order and fraternity of Pastors and Governors in every
Church, as has been proved) than if some one or more, cunning fellows, should
persuade credulous and silly people, whom they find or lead into the dark, or
else blind them; that they were indeed stark blind, and had no power of
themselves to see, or open their eyes, but must wholly be led by their
guidance, without having any sight, or benefit of the Sun: These poor seduced
men, have no more to do in point of relieving themselves, and confuting so
gross Impostors, but only to open their eyes freely, and to use the light of
that Sun, which they easily and clearly see shining over all the world; which
is not more evident to sense, than this Truth is to judicious Christians, That
the power of Ordeining Ministers has always, and only been in the Pastors,
Bishops, and Guides of the Church, who both ruled well, and also labored
diligently in the Word and doctrine.

And since true Christians in this Reformed Church of England, both Ministers
and people, have been so happy in this Church, as to be delivered from the
Romish superstitions, and Papal usurpations; they have now no cause to be less
cautious, or more patient to be gulled, and deluded by popular seductions, lest
the second error be worse than the first; Inasmuch, as the furies and
confusions of the vulgar are more dangerous than any errors of Popes, or
Bishops, or Presbyters, are like to be; as Earthquakes are more dreadful and
pernicious than Eclipses, or the Cloudings of the lights of Heaven. The lights
of the Church may recover their luster and vigor in due time; nor do they ever
shine so dark, but they afford a competent light, to show the way to Heaven;
But popular precipitancies, and licentious extravagancies of the vulgar, are
likest to overthrow all religion; and bury all Christianity by Gothic and
Mahumetan methods, in Atheism, Illiterateness, Confusion, and Barbarity; For,
as they have least skill in them, and no authority given them, to order and
rule Church affairs; so they have most passion, and unbridled violence in them:
least able to distinguish between the abuse and use of things; between gold and
dross; between what is of God, or of Man; when once they have got power, and
say that they know not what is become of their Mosesses, Exodus ^6^.
their divinely appointed guides, their duly ordained Bishops and Ministers;
the first thing they do, is to make themselves molten Images, and contribute
both their Earings and their Ears, their hearts and hands to those Calves,
which they set us for Tamuzzes, Ezekiel. 8.3.
or Images of jealousy and abominations, whereby to provoke the God of heaven
to wrath; to reproach the honor of Christ, to affront the true Ministers, and
to make the Reformed religion and this Church to become an hissing and
astonishment to all round about. A wise man of Spain sa^d, It is better in
Church, as well as in places of Civil power and Judicature, to prefer corrupt
men, than weak and foolish; The one is as a thief in a Vineyard, who will only
take ripe grapes till he is satisfied; the other as an Ass which eats ripe and
green, crops the Vines, treads down much with his heels, and when his belly is
full, tumbles among them.

But our Antiministeriall Adversaries are still ready with scorn and laughter
to demand, What can Ministers, 13. The virtue of holy Ordination. Object.
either as Bishops or Presbyters, confer more than other Christians, in the
point of Ordination? What virtue or charm is there in the imposing of their
hands, or in their prayers; by which to add to any man's ministerial gifts and
graces; or to invest any man in a way of Church power, more than is in any
other Christians? whose gifts and graces may be equal, or exceeding, their
Infirmities far less, than many Ministers are? What power can they have to give
the holy Ghost, as they express in the form of Ordination? yea, whence do they
challenge, as of right the Name of Clergymen, as peculiar to their tribe and
Calling; where as all the Lords people are his lot, and his inheritance, and
God is theirs; Nor ought they contemptuously, as by way of diminution to be
called Laymen, or the Laity, Since they are all spiritually anointed, and
chosen of God, to be Kings, Priests, and Prophets?

to this last scruple first, as least, being not so much a beam, as a mote in
some men's tender eyes, which like Leahs, are easily offended: As for the names
then of Clergy and Laity, in which the Nasuter Critics of this age, sent
something of pride in the Ecclesiastics or Ministers, and of despiciency
toward the faithful people, (who are to be animated, and flattered any way
against the Ministry of the Church;) They may know that this distinction
between the Clergy and Laity, has been used in the Church, from the very first
Primitive times, as the ancient Fathers, Councils, and the Histories of the
Churches both Greek and Latin do testify; nor was the one ever intended or
upbraided for a badge of vanity to the Ministry; nor the other imputed for a
brand of scorn to the people; The piety and charity of those times were not at
leisure, thus to ((...)) to stumble at straws. I am sure as they anciently
were, so they still are usual notes of difference in point of office and duty
between Ministers and people, not only in our ordinary Language; yea, in the
exacter style of our Laws, (which give both real and nominall distinctions
with the greatest authority;) Nor are they at all against the Scripture sense
and meaning (if they be not just to its words,) since the word of Christ has
evidently placed as limits of office, so Marks and names of distinction between
the one and the other, as Pastor and Flock, Doctor and Disciple, Ruler and
ruled, etc. Yea, and we may easi^y gather from the Scripture dialect, that as
the faithful people are in general (Clerus, Ecclesia) the lot or portion and
heritage of the Lord; So the Ministers are Clerus Ecclesiae, A lot, heritage
and portion given by the Lord to the Church, and set apart, or Consecrated by
the Church to the Lords special service; (...), Acts 13. to serve the Lord,
and the Church, in holy public ministrations, as the Apostles first did; into
whose order Mathias was by Lot chosen to supply the place of Judas Iscariot,
Acts 1. To which end Ministers in an holy Succession have ever been placed over
the people in the name of Christ, by the power of his Holy Spirit; yet Good
Ministers disdain not to be reckoned among Gods People, as children of the same
Spiritual Father, and brethren in the same Family or household of Faith; nor
will any humble Christians, (being not in holy orders,) affect to be called
Clergy men, by a confusion of language; or disdain to be called Gods commons,
or Laymen, which has a sober, Christian, and charitable sense, in the dialect
of those Christians, who know how to call and account their true Bishops and
Ministers, as Fathers, Instructers, Overseers, and Guides of the Church, etc.
These names then, or distinctive titles do but fairly follow (according to the
use and nature of words) and decently express those things, which the mind of
Christ in the Scripture, and all Custom or use of the Church have distinguished
for order sake.

The same supercriticall men will boggle at the words, Trinity, Three Persons,
and Sacraments; which are not in the letter, but in the sense, and truth of the
Scripture; And certainly no religion forbids us to adopt convenient and
compendious words, to the Churches use, since we do safely translate the whole
original Scriptures to any ordinary languages, in which most Christians may
best use them, not in the literal words, but in the Intellectual sense or
mind of God. A strife about words, and syllabicall scruples, fits only women or
children, or peevish passionate men: As the Arrians of old, who caviled much at
the words ((...) and (...)) whose syllables were new, but their sense old,
orthodox and sound, expressing the same divine Nature in Christ the Son, with
the Father; and that our Emanuel, who was born of the virgin Mary, was both God
and Man; But this quarrel about names and words, is a very tedious impertinency
to those Christians, whose serious piety studies only this, by apt and usual
words, to comprehend and express, the truths and orders of Religion; who are
ready always so to give to each other the right hand of Charity and Unity, as
members of the same body, whose head is Christ; as yet to preserve that order
and authority in the Church, which is divinely Instituted, and is as necessary
for the Church, as it is for the body to have head, eyes, and mouth, distinct
from other parts of less honor, yet not less useful in their place. As for
this pretended grievance then of these words, Clergy and Laity; We desire not
to quarrel farther with our Adversaries, and we shall not need to dispute with
others that are wise and humble, only we pity the simplicity of people, who
are thus easily cheated, and scared, by some sophistry, when they are told by
their great scrupulosity, and censorian gravity, that words are as bad as
Spells, that what ever terms or Names, are not in the Scriptures, (as they have
them translated) are not the speech of Canaan, but the language of the beast:
Thus these severe Momusses; Thus the Antiministeriall factors for error,
ignorance, and confusion. These are among the other small artifices used by
those miserable Rabbyes, who to ingratiate with the vulgar, and lead d^sciples
after them, are content to take away the ancient marks of bounds, and known
distinction of names, between Minister and People, that so people may take the
greater confidence to cast quite away both the name and thing, the holy
Ordination with all distinction of Office and Function Ministerial in the
Church; which if I can solidly maintain against these underminers of Religion,
despisers of Ordination, and vastators of all true ministry, I doubt not, but I
and others may still use these Names of Clergy and Laity without sin or
scandal to any sober and good Christians.

To the main therefore of the Objection which is made against the virtue and
efficacy of Ordination, 16 Profane minds prone to cavil at all holy mysteries,
as well as the Ordination of Ministers. 2 Pet. 3.4.
by the Catholic and Ancient way of Bishops and Presbyters, which they so
slight, I answer; That at the same rate of profane, and Atheistical
reasonings, they may as well dispute (as Julian would have done, and those
Scoffers daily do (which are foretold should be in the later days) What virtue
is there in the water of Baptism, more than any other, by which to regenerate a
sinner, to wash away sins, to seal comforts, to confer grace, to represent the
blood of Christ, of which a man may meditate every time he sees any water, or
washes his hands? Hence the mean esteem, and contempt indeed, with proud and
presumptuous Catabaptists have against that holy Mystery of Baptism, which all
Churches, in all ages, have used with reverence and comfort, according to
Christ's Institution, and the Apostolical custom. So also the spiritual pride
of those profane Cavillers will argue, what efficacy can there be in the Bread
and Wine, at the Lords Supper, more than in other of the same Elements at our
ordinary Tables, and in every Tavern? What does the form of Consecration, by
the words of Christ and prayers add to them, or alter them? Nay, (since the
blasphemous boldness of proud and wicked men, will count nothing of outward
form sacred) no wonder if by the same contradictive spirit, they quarrel at not
only the Humanity or flesh, but also the Majesty, and divinity of our Savior
Jesus Christ; and seeing the outward meanness, poverty, and ingloriousness of
his life and death, many of them scarce own him for a Savior, or for the true
Messiah; And no further than is agreeable to their Seraphick fancies; Against
whom Irenaus d sputes.
by which they labor (after the like fondness of some in ancient times) to
turn all the solidity of Truth, the certainty of History, and the Sacredness of
the mystery of Jesus Christ, (...). Naz. Or. 23. de Trinitatis Mist. (...).

(God manifested in the flesh) into nothing but Familisticall whimseys, empty
notions, and sublimity of nonsense; As if there were more light of Religion in
their modern Meteors and gross illuminations, than in the Sun, Moon and Stars,
in Scripture, Ministers, and Christians of old; whereas the same holy and
humble faith, by which true Christians do believe Jesus to be the promised
Messiah, the Son of God, and only Savior of the world, (notwithstanding all
that blind Jews, or proud, Gentiles object against him) does also teach them,
to receive with all humble thankfulness, and religious reverence, all those
holy orders, duties, and Institutions, (in their plainess, poverty, and
simplity) which Christ has settled in his Church, and which the Church has
continued according to his word in all humble fidelity. Nor does the meaness of
outward appearance, or any natural and civil disproportions which appear to
humane sense or reasonings, any way prejudice, or weaken the faith, devotion,
duty and obedience of those, who live by faith, and look with the eye of faith,
and act with the hand of faith, in all those holy offices and Ministrations,
which are grounded on the word of Christ.

To judge of Christian Mysteries or Ministries, by common sense, or carnal
reasonings, as Sarah did of the Promise, is to make Christian Religion most
ridiculous, mean and insignificant, whose virtue and efficacy, as the faith of
Abraham, depends not upon any natural, moral, or politic powers, faculties,
habits, abilities or actions, that are in, or flow from, the persons acting in
them, and dispensing of them; nor the Elementary sensible natures of the things
used in them; But merely upon that divine virtue, and power of Christ
Instituting such holy things, as duties to be done, to such a religious end, by
such men, and means, in such a manner, and no other; (...). Just. Ma. de sid.
Tota ratio sacti est potentia facientis. Aust. Greg. N.s. Vita Mosis. Carnem

discutienda sunt dei mysteria, etc. 2 Cor. 2. In mullis scientia Pauli a

and all this in his Name; that is, merely as an Institution of his divine
power and wisdom, and whence they have their efficacy, and also authority; not
indeed among affected Novelists, curious speculatists, proud hypocrites, or
contentious worldlings, but among humble, devout, and true believers, who are
also doers of the will of God in all things, holy, just and moral, who knowing
what belongs to the life and obedience of Faith, disdain not to submit
themselves to any way and order, seem it never so weak and simple, that Christ
has appointed, to them and his Church; who alone can make weak, foolish, and
contemptible things to be powerful and effectual, through the concurrence of
his Spirit and grace, to those great and holy ends, for which they are by him
Instituted in his Church.

So that it is not any Magic charm, or Enchantment, as these profane minds
scornfully deride, which makes the common elements to become Sacraments, by
that solemn Consecration, which is rightly performed by one, that is from
Christ appointed as a minister of holy things. No more is it any fantastic and
imaginary power, which of a common man, makes a Minister of the Gospel, by due
Ordination; which is a setting apart of some fit and worthy men from the
ordinary capacities, common relations, and humane affairs of the world, either
as natural or civil, and Consecrating them by prayer, and imposition of
hands, and power of the Spirit, to the peculiar service of Christ, and his
Church, in the holy Ministry; Pantomimi sunt in religione Hypocritae; quo minus
sancti sunt, co magis simulant, (...) students, non (...),
And this not to be done by any one, that please themselves to be at once both
apes, and hypocrites in religion, to act a part, and make a Stage Play of holy
Ordination, by a popular presumption; but only by such as Christ has fitted
with gifts, and enabled with power of his Spirit, to Consecrate and Ordein a
succession of Ministers to the service of the Church, being themselves formerly
ordained, and so invested with that great and holy power of order. So that it
is the powerful Word and Spirit of Christ, In ordinatione Deus est causa
principalis, and homo instrumentatis; Deus vocat primario Ecclesia mediante,
and declarante quem a Deo vocatum praesumit. Gerard. 2 Cor. 10.5.
as the King and Prophet of his Church, which commands the duty, establishes
the Order, and gives the blessing, as in other, so in this of Ordination. In
obedience to which, true and excellent Christians, willingly captivate all
their high imaginations, and subdue every thought, which exalts it self against
the rule of faith, the word of Christ, pulling down all the strong holds of
proud and humane reasonings; Submitting to every holy Ministration, and true
Minister in his office, for Christ's sake; from whose grace, Spirit, and
promise, they expect, and find that blessing, comfort, and inward peace, which
is only to be had in Christ's way; which depends merely on his divine will and
power, which changes not the nature of things, but their relation, and use, to
an higher and spiritual end; requiring faith, humility, reverence, obedience,
and thankfulness in every believer or worshipper.

17. Right Ordination Efficacious relatively and spiritually, not physically.
So that although Ordination of a Minister to the peculiar service of Christ and
the Church, by such as have the right and power by uninterrupted succession
duly derived to them, and to be derived orderly from them in all ages, do not
add to the Natural, Moral, or Spiritual gifts and indowments of men, as they
are personal and inherent, any more than the office of Ambassador, or Judge,
or Commander does, in Civil, or Military employments, confer any thing to the
inward abilities of the man; yet, that honor and authority rightly derived to
any one, invests him with a relative, Idem valet deputati ac deputantis
autoritas, in quantum dep^tatur. Reg. jur.
yet real power, qualification, and capacity of doing, or declaring the will
of another, to the same validity, as if the principal himself did it; by whose
authority alone any other is sent, and enabled to effect those things which
none other can presume to perform without vanity, sin, and presumption, who
has not that gift, power, or authority consigned to him.

The right Ordination then of Ministers, in the way of an holy succession in
the Church of Christ, has in Religion, and among true Christians, these holy
uses, and clear advantages peculiar to it. 1. 1. It confirms the truth of the
Gospel. 2 Cor. 8.23.
First, as to the main end, the Glory of God, and the saving of men's souls, (by
their believing and obeying this testimony of all true Ministers, that Jesus
Christ is the only Savior of the world;) Nothing gives a more clear and
credible testimony to the glory and honor of Jesus Christ, and to truth of the
Gospel, than this uniform and constant succession of Ministers, Multi
barbar^rum in Christu^ credunt sine charactere vel attramento: scriptam
babenter in cordibus sum per spiritum salutem, et veterum traditionem
diligentes custodientes, quam Apostoli tradiderunt iis, quibus committebant
Ecclesias, cui ordinationi assentiunt multa gentes, etc. Iren. l. 3. c. 4.
by a peculiar Ordination and authority even from Christ himself in person, who
at first began this Ministry, and sent some special men as his messengers to
bear witness of him in all the world; that so men might believe, not only what
is written in the word before it was, or as it is now written; but also as that
glorious truth has been thus testified every where, and in every age, by
chosen and peculiar men, as a cloud of most credible witnesses, whom thousands
at first did, and to this day, do hear preaching, and see them Celebrating the
holy mysteries of Christ's Gospel, who never had or used any written word, nor
ever read it, and for the most part believed, before ever they saw any part of
the Bible (which the constant Ministry of the Church, has under God, hitherto
preserved) chiefly upon the testimony, and tradition, or record of those, that
were ever thought (and always ought to be) most able and faithful men,
specially appointed, by Christ in his Church, as a perpetual order, and
succession of Witnesses, to testify of him, and to minister in his Name to the
end of the world; This walking Gospel, and visible Ministry, consisting, as it
ought, of wise, and worthy men, Minister est verbum visibile, ambulans
Evangelium.
(who have good reputation, for their piety, learning, and fidelity,) running
on to all generations, is as a continued stream from the blessed Apostles, who
were the first witnesses immediately appointed by Christ to hold forth his name
and Gospel to the world. Acts 1.8. which, though never so far off in the
decurrence of time from the fountain, yet still testifies and assures all wise
men, that there is certainly a divine fountain of this ministerial power, and
so of Evangelicall mysteries and truth; which rose first from Christ, and which
has constantly run, as may appear by the enumeration, or induction of
particular descents in all ages, in this Channel of the Apostles, and their
successors, the Bishops and Presbyters of the Church; for the better planting,
confirming, and propagating of the Gospel to all Nations and times; As a duty,
charge, or office, enjoined by divine command to some men, and lying ever as a
calling on their consciences; Hereby evidently declaring the divine wisdom, and
Fatherly care of Christ, for the good instruction, and order of his Church, in
his personal absence; In that he has not left the Ministry of the Gospel,
and his holy Institutions (which he would have always continued for the
gathering and edifying of his Church,) to a loose and arbitrary way, among the
rabbl^ and promiscuous herds of men; (which would soon have made Evangelicall
truths seem but as vagrant fables, and general, uncertain rumors; which run
without any known and sure authority in the common chat, and arbitrary report
of the vulgar; by which in a short time both the order, beauty, honor, purity
and credit of Truth is easily lost among men;) This holy and successionall
ordination of the Evangelicall Ministry gives great proof, and demonstration,
as of Christ's personal presence as chief Bishop and Minister of his Church; so
of the fulfilling of Christ's word, and the veracity of his promise, Mat. 28.
after his departure to be with them that were sent and went in his name, to
the end of the world; That the gates of hell neither yet have, nor ever shall
prevail against the Church: While it carefully preserves a right succession,
holy order, and authority of true Ministers, the devil despairs of ever
overthrowing Christian Religion in its reformed profession in any Country. Down
with the order, Mat. 16.28.
and sacred power, and succession of the Ministry, and all will in a short time
be his own.

2. 2. Evidenceth the Churches care. Agnitio vera est Apostolorum doctrina and
antiquus Ecclesia status in universo mundo, and charactere corporis Christi
secundum successiones Apostolorum: quibus illi eam quae est in unoquoque loco
Ecclesiam tradiderunt: and Scripturarum sine fictione custodita tractatio
plenissima, l^ctio sine salsatione and secundum scripturas expositio legitima
and diligens: sine periculo, and sine blasphemia. Irenaeus. l. 4. c. 43. In
Ecclesia Catholica bacte nus inviolabili observatione tenetar qua potissimum
Catholici ab Haereticis discriminantur, nimirum, ut cujusvis meriti atque
praestantiae ^ir fuerit non sua sponte praedicationis munus suscipiat; sed
expectet donec ab Ecclesia mittatur, ab eaque sacris functionibus initietur,
si^que initiatus praedicationi Evangelii mancipetur. Baronius An. Anno Christi.
44.
It is also a notable evidence of the Churches care and fidelity in all ages;
not only in the preservation of the oracles of the word, which it has done,
but also of a constant holy Ministry to teach and explain them; Also to
celebrate those holy mysteries which are divinely annexed to the word, as seals
to confirm the faith of Christians; And lastly to exercise that wholesome
discipline for terror or comfort, the power of which is chiefly in the Pastors
and Rulers of the Church. As it is then for the honor of the wisdom of Christ
in the original, to have instituted such holy mysteries and such a Ministry,
so it is for the honor of the Church, in the succession of all ages to have
thus preserved them and it self, in that order which becomes the family of
Christ; which had come far short of any well ordered family, if the Father and
Master of it, Jesus Christ, had left every servant to guess at his duty, and
all of them to scramble what part they list of employment, aliment, and
enjoyment; but the Lord Christ, (as every wise Master does) has appointed, and
his Church has preserved to this day constant Stewards, and dispensers of holy
things in his household; whose duty it is to be faithful to their Masters
profit, and credit; to do their duty, and to maintain that place and authority,
in which the Lord has set them; nor is it any thing of a pious easiness, but
an impious baseness, in them as Bishops and Ministers voluntarily to desert
their station, and to suffer every one to usurp upon them, and to do what they
list: Nor is any thing more intolerable, than the rudeness, riot, and impudence
of those inferior servants, who pretending Christian liberty, and not enduring
those officers and Ministers whom the Master has orderly placed over them;
neither will they long endure the Lord or Master himself to rule over them; we
read, Mat. 21.38, They kill the Son, who first beat and shamefully entreated
the servants which were sent.

But thirdly, as to the persons duly ordained; This holy Ordination g^ves a
real divine power; which is necessarily to be delegated and derived from
Christ, (since no man has it, in, and of himself, or of any will of men) by
which he is enabled to perform those duties, which Christ only has enjoined in
his word to be done, and to be thus done, by such men, and in such a manner,
and no other, 1 Timothy 5.22. Lay hands suddenly on no man, (i. e.) by way of
Ordination: Ergo, no man is of that office, or has that authority and power
till ordained, be his parts and gifts never so great and good. So 2 Timothy 2.2.
These things commit to faithful men (who may be able to teach others) ergo,
some peculiar Commission must be given to these, and to no other, to perform
Ministerial duties with authority. Such are those, of making Disciples, by
Preaching the Gospel; by distinguishing from others; and also confirming, and
uniting together among themselves in holy Communion, those Disciples, with the
holy seals of Baptism and the Lords Supper; To edify, confirm, and preserve
them by teaching, reprooving, praying for them, comforting, guiding, governing,
binding and loosing, by the use of that power of the Keys, which is committed
only to them, both in doctrine and discipline; doing all things toward
penitents and impenitents, believers and unbelievers, Tit. 2.15.
not magisterially but ministerially, as from Christ, and for the Churches
good; yet not precariously, and arbitrarily, o^ depending on man's pleasure,
Iren. l. 4. c. 43. Episcopalus suc^ession^m ab Apostolis habentes Charisma
veritatis certu^ acceperunt. Ubi charis^ata domini posita sunt ibi discere
oportet veritatem: apud quos est successio ab Apostoli^, and sanum ac
irreprobabile sermonis. Cap. 45. 1 T^m. 4.14.
but autoritatively and conscientiously as doing the work of the Lord: knowing
the power they have received of the Lord; the duties enjoined them; the care
required in them, the account to be exacted of them, as to the Stewardship of
the souls solemnly committed to their care: which is done by that (...) or
ministerial gift of the holy Ghost, which Christ gave to the Apostles. John
20.22. and by their hands, (as by St. Paul's to Timothy, 2 Timothy 1.6.14) to
others, and so to a perpetual succession.

For without this gift or power of the holy Spirit of Truth; 18. The holy
Spirit given in right Ordination, how.
whose property it is to lead the faithful into all truth, no man is truly a
Minister of holy things in the Church; So that it is a pitiful piece of
ignorance, or putid scurrility, and profaness, for any that profess
Christianity, much more for those that pretend to be Ministers in the Church,
to slight, and expose to vulgar scorn, that passage used, as of ancient times
in all Churches, so in the Church of Englands manner of ordeining Ministers;
Receive ye the holy Spirit: As if this were a mere mockery, and insignificancy
in point of any sanctity conferred: When it is expressed to be meant (as it
ever was in the Church understood) not of sanctifying graces, infused
qualities, or habits of inward holiness, (which are immediately from God, and
not by man to be conferred; nor from man to be communicated to another; nor do
they invest any one, that has them, in any Church office or public power over
others (for then every holy man and woman should have this power:) but it is
only meant of those peculiar gifts, or powers of the holy Spirit, Ephesians. 4.8.
which are properly ministerial and officiative; as from Christ, and in his
name: not by internal infusion, but by external separation or sanction; not
end^ing with grace, but investing in a new relation and authority, distinct
from the common Christians, duty, place, and officers of charity, etc. which
are as parchment, wax, and writing, useful in their kind; but not valid, as to
any conveyance, till sealed, subscribed, delivered and witnessed, as the act
and dee^ of the conveyer; who lawfully hereby confers to an other his right and
power of acting, possessing, or enjoying, etc. So by a form of such Commission
or delegation, as Christ instituted, that power and ministerial gift of the
holy Spirit is continued, which was first committed to the Apostles by Christ;
who only would do it: Nor can this power be understood so much for
extraordinary miracles, (which were to cease;) as for that ordinary Ministry,
which was to continue, as necessary for the Church in all ages: This power or
gift of the Holy Ghost, as ministerial and officiating in Christ's name, as
that of miracles, may be where there is no sanctifying grace; as was in Judas,
and probably in Demas, and others; who might be sheep, as to their profession,
Acts 1.17.
and shepherds, as to their office, or Episcopacy (of which Judas had a part
and fell from it) and yet wolves, as to the inward habits and graces. 1 Cor.
5.4. In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and
my Spirit with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, etc.
When the Spirit of Paul was joined with the Corinthian Ministers and believers
in excommunicating the incestuous persons; it was not the sanctifying Spirit or
grace of the Apostle; but that ministerial power, which he had eminently in
and jointly with the Church: The power and Spirit of Christ as it is given, so
received in right Ordination, by every true Minister, that is worthily
promoted; not as to grace, and inward virtue, of which man judges not; but as
to office and relative power from Christ, in the public service or Ministry to
his Church. As every officer civil, or military that has commission, acts, in
the Spirit, name, and power of those, by whom authority is primarily derived to
them. In this sense and to this use the Spirit of Moses was put on the 70.
Elders. Number. 11.25. and Elias on Elisha. 2 Kings 11.9.

3. Yea further, I doubt not, but the solemn and right manner of Ordination by
fasting, Deus largitur gratiam: homo imponit manus. Sacerdos imponit supplicem
dextram, and Deus benedi^. potents dentre. Episcopus initiat ordinem; and Deus
tribuit dignitatem. Amb. de dign. Sacerd. c. 5.
prayer, and imposition of hands; (wherein the Spirit of the ordeiners, and the
Christians present, with the ordained, join together in his behalf to God,) is
a very great and effectual means, to indue the ordained, in some sense, with
an other Spirit; not only, as to power, but as to the increase of ministerial
gifts, which fit him to receive, and use that authority; yea, and for the
strengthening, exciting, and enlarging those sanctifying graces, by which he is
more fitted for, and prospered in, the work of the Ministry, than he was
before; or any other can ordinarily be without this due Ordination; whereby his
wisdom, humility, charity, zeal, devotion, industry, purity, exactness and
constancy are increased so as are most requisite for the great work and office
of a Minister.

4. It binds the conscience of the ordained, more strictly to the duty and
office, as to discharge it, so to endeavor, by all holy means, of study,
prayer, conference, meditation, etc. to preserve, use, and augment those gifts,
faculties, or graces, natural, acquired, or infused, for the right discharge
and fulfilling of his Ministry, to the glory of God, and the Churches welfare,
D. Origin dicunt eum sine vocatione se ingessisse in efficium docendi; inde
factum est quod in tot errores prolapsus sit. Chem. de Ecclesia. Res Dei ab
bomine dari non possunt. Synod. Romans
both in true peace and holiness; Hence the great learning of Origin and
admired gifts, were thought by some less prospered and blessed of God; because
he presumed to do the work of a Minister before he was blessed, ordained, and
authorized by the Church.

5. Due Ordination gives comfort, countenance, Quomodo valebit secularis homo
sacerdotis ministerium adimplere, cujus nec officium tenuit, nec disciplinam
agnovit. Is. Hisp. off. l. 2. c. 3. Qui infideliter introivit quid ni
infideliter agat. Bern. Tit. 2.15. Acts 4.20. John 10.12. (...). Gr. Niss. de

Preached before he was ordained Presbyter, before Alexa: Bishop of Jerusalem,
and Theod. Bishop of Cesaria: for which Demet. Bishop of Alexand. reproves
them: But they excuse it as a custom there, for probation of such as they found

and divine courage to true Ministers, as the anointing did to the Prophets of
old, and the solemn mission of Christ did to the holy Apostles, to Preach; not
as popular Scribes, and precarious Pharisees, but as St. John the Divine having
authority from Christ; whose Ministry (like John Baptists) is not from men on
earth, (however transmitted by men) but from God in Heaven; In this confidence
they can rebuke with all authority; With this conscience they cannot but speak
in the name of the Lord; They do not fear the face of men, or devils, in
Christ's way; They forsake not, as hirelings, the flock, when the Wolf comes, as
having no relation, or tie to the flock, which is not committed to those self
intruders, but usurped by force, or invaded by stealth; True Pastors in time of
general (not personal persecution) dare not leave their flock destitute; but
choose to be examples to them of suffering cheerfully for Christ; expecting
Christ's promise, and assistance in his way. The righteous Minister is as bold
as a Lion; for he that walks uprightly in the Spirit and power, and way of
Christ, walks seemly: But all usurpers are cowards, and are ready to insinuate,
and crouch to all ways of mean and vulgar complyances; giving the Belfry leave
to swallow up the Church and Chancel too; Falsely and vilely flattering the
people, as if ministerial power were in them and from them; And this some do
purely for filthy lucre; where there is a miserable dependence for maintenance
upon peoples good will; and chiefly to prevent any question, or scrutiny, which
may be made by some nimbler sophisters touching their precatious, usurped, and
beggarly authority as Ministers, which is truly none; This keeps them justly so
in aw, that those popular Preachers dare not use that just rigor, and severity,
in cases of most apparent crying sins in people, which a true Minister having
good conscience and good authority knows how seasonably, and discreetly, yet
freely and effectually to use, not to his own pomp, Empire, or advantage; but
to Christ's glory, the Churches good, and the honor of Religion; though it be
to his own detriment and danger, as St. Chrysostom stom, St. Basil. Naz. and other
holy Bishops and Presbyters often did.

6. Right Ordination preserves Order and Decorum in the Church and holy
administrations; also it fortifies the function of a Minister with due respect
and decent regard, even before men; so that neither the persons nor function
and office of Ministers are easily to be despised, when public Ordination is
duly performed, with that solemnity, and holy manner, as was of old, in this
and all true Churches, and which ought to be so still: It likewise conciliates
in Christ's name, and for his sake, much love, reverence, esteem, patience, and
obedience, toward Ministers, in their places, and duty, from all true
Christians; yea and it raises a just veneration to duties, Mat. 10.40.
thus rightly celebrated among the faithful, by those, of whom Christ says, He
that receives you, receives me, and he that despises you, despises me, and
him that sent me.

Constantine the Great always treated the Bishops and true Ministers of the
Church, with all observance and pious respect. Eusebius. ^i^a. C^^sl. l. 1. c. 35.
Mat. 10.14. 2 Timothy 4.3.
This makes them received in the name of Prophets; as Apostles or Angels sent
from God; valued by true Christians, as their right eyes; This makes Christ
sensible of their in^uries as his, and the very dust of their feet becomes a
dreadful witness against wicked and proud rejecters of them; who thinking them
to be Ministers but of courtesy or civility, cannot regard them with conscience
and duty; But imagine that they may, at the pleasure of any passion, lust, or
secu^ar design, be mocked, despised, degraded, cast off, and quite abolished:
That so their liberty may prefer a heap of teachers of their own raking and
making, before any of Christ's sending, and the Churches ordeining: Such being
most fit for their sinister ends, who come in the peoples name, and have no
higher or nobler Spirit; acting all things in their Levelled Ministry, by the
same irreverent, irregular, inconstant, rude, insolent, and uncomly Spirit of
popularity; which is most prevalent in those, that are most enemies to and
afraid of the true ministerial power and due ordination; Cujus ordinatio
despicitur ejus and praedicatio contemnitur. Ber.
Those (...) or (...) creations of the people, when men list, are easily
rejected, and cast off with scorn, yet without any sin and shame: yea they
cannot be regarded, or followed, without neglect and affront of the true
Minist^y, Non Domini sed Daemonis sunt haec pascua, Hi pastores. Luther.
and this not without a great sin; The devil is never pleased better, than
with such pragmatick Preachers, and false Prophets; who do Satan's work under
Christ's Livery; which is at once to invalidate, and overthrow as the true
Ministry, so all conscience of true Religion; that so having by these Nimrods
hunted out, and destroyed all the race of the ancient holy order and
succession, he may set up the Babell of his Kingdom. No Symptom of lapsing unto
Atheism so great, as the despising of the Ministry; which Eusebius observes
before the destruction of the Jews.

Ali^n^n sunt re^i^iendi praedicatores q^am qu^s Christus instituit, qui primus
Apostolos m^sit. Tertul. de prae. ad H^^r. O^tendant mihi ex qua auto itate
prod^runt. Probent se no vos Apostolos, and virtutes proferant and miracula.
Tert. Ib^d.
7. It gives great satisfaction to the conscience of all true believers and
serious Christians, in point of duty discharged and comfort obtained by holy
ministrations; of whose validity and efficacy they have then least scruples,
when they are most assured of the authority of the Minister performing them as
in Christ's way, so in his Name, wherein blessing is to be sought and only to be
found; Hence also they expect the graces of the duty, when the Ministration is
rightly done, by those, that are in Christ's stead, as to the outward form, and
presence, which none can without a ly and hypocrisy pretend to, but only true
Ordained Ministers; Others in their arrogant and impudent intrusions are justly
and easily despised, and all duties they do; which are first questioned, then
denied, having no plea or pretense of authority from Scripture, reason, or from
the custom and practice of the Church, whereby to persuade any sober man to
regard them any more, than God did the Oblations of Cain, or Corah. Nothing is
more abhorred to the God of order, (...). Joh. 10.8. All that came before me
were thieves: i. e. came without commission, in their own names. In venientibus
est praesumtio temeritatis, in Miss^ est obsequium servitutis. Jeron.
than presumptions in piety, which disdain to serve God in his own way; Nor
will their zeal cover their rudeness and disobedience, or excuse the ly, which
pretends to speak, and go and run, and prophecy in Gods name when the Lord sent
them not, Jer. 23.31, 32. Therefore the ancient Greek Lyturgies prayed in their
Ordination of Ministers, and Consecration of Bishops, that God would bestow on
the Ordained such ((...)) Ministerial gifts, that the holy Ministry might be
unblemished, and unblamable, that thereby a reverence might be preserved to
holy offices, and holy officers too, for the peoples stay, satisfaction and
comfort.

And whereas the pleader for the peoples privilege, and duty to Prophecy,
objects, that few people are ever assured of those Ministers being duly
ordained, who daily preach among them, and administer holy things; It is true,
every Minister does not, Luther demanded of Muncer a fanatic Prophet what
ordinary call or Mission he had; with which Luther contented himself. In vita
Lutheri.
every time he preaches, show the letters, or the Charter of his Ordination;
Nor is it necessary, (but only at some times) If the discipline of the Church
in this point were such, as it ought to be, in practice, and which was in our
Constitution, viz. That none might presume to officiate (properly) as a
Minister, in holy Administrations (beyond probationall preaching) but only such
as were sufficiently known to be true Ministers rightly Ordained in public,
under sufficient testimonial; The strict care of this, would be a great means
both to restore the lapsed honor of the Ministry, and to establish many shaken
Christians in their faith.

As right Ordination of the Evangelicall Ministry carrys with it the only
acceptance from God, as a service and duty, for to others God will say, Who
required these things at your hands? So it procures unspeakable blessings of
Gods graces and gifts upon the Churches of Christ, and the household of Faith;
more truth and soundness in the faith, more Union, Peace, Charity, Order,
Constancy, etc. The flourishing of Aarons rod, Numb. 17. both in blossoms and
ripe fruit, sufficiently testifies (against these envious murmurers against
Ordination) whom the Lord has chosen and ordained to serve him, as Ministers
of the Gospel. Romans 4.10. How shall they preach unless they be sent? It Is
negative, They cannot rightly, lawfully, acceptably, successfully, comfortably
preach, unless duly sent in Gods way; nor can that place be meant only of the
Apostles, as F. Socinus interprets it, since as Preaching and Ministry, so
authority in them, and regard to them, is always necessary for the Churches
good. Never any Church or Christians were eminent for sound knowledge, Orthodox
profession, or for holiness of life, in all charity and virtues, but only
there, where true Ministry, and right Ordination was continued and encouraged.
The more any Church or Christians are defective, or neglective, and loose in
this, the more they are presently overgrown with ignorance, or Errors, or
Superstition, or infinite Schisms, profane novelties, and scandalous
licentiousness; when every one that lists makes himself or another, a Minister
in new and Exotic ways; Such mock-Ministers are but as the block, that fell
among frogs, nine days wonder; but afterward the Pageantry concludes in the
profane babblings, contempts, and confusions, justly and necessarily following
such mockeries and Impostures; Nor are they attended with only contempt of
those Pretenders, but also with neglect and indifferency in some men, as to all
holy duties and ministry; Non fortunat Deus labores torum qui non sunt ordinati
and quanquam salutaria quaedam afferant tamen non aedificant. Luther. tom. 4.
Genesis fol. 9.
which the miserable experience of many people in this Church too much confirms
at this day: No men and women being more dark, unsavory, disorderly, wasted,
torn, wounded, and scattered into factions and errors, than those deluded
creatures, whose first error makes way for all other, forsaking the true light,
and salt of the world, and of the Church; the teaching, order, and guidance of
their true and faithful Ministers; After this they are easily abused with
twinkling snuffs, unsavory salt, with Wolves and thieves, who come not in at
the door, when it is fairly open, but climb over, or creep under the wall of
government, order, and discipline: that they may steal, destroy, and disperse
the flock. Out of you shall arise men, Joh. 10.1.
speaking perverse things (i. e.) they rise of themselves by popular
forwardness, and disorderly presumption, not from Christ's and the Churches
ordination. Hence they prove so grievous and mischievous to the Church. Acts
20.30. So that it is not only the Calamity and misery of poor Christians to be
thus abused; but it draws them into many sinful evils, and snares, while they
forsake, or cast out and despise their rightly Ordained, and duly placed
Ministers, and either follow and encourage such seducers, as are very
destructive, both to the Churches peace, and to men's souls, both in the present
and after ages, or else fall to a neglect, indifferency, yea and abhorrency of
all Religion.

The Order, Power, 20. Summary Conclusion of the power and efficacy of right
Ordination.
and Authority then by which right Ordination is conferred on the true
Ministers of the Gospel, as was here in England, although they seem to proud
scorners, to unstable minds, to ignorant and unbelievers, as frivolous, as the
Gospel seems foolishness; yet to the humble eye of Faith, it appears as the
wisdom, holy order, and commission of God, for the continual teaching, well
guiding, and edifying of the Church of God, by truth, and peace to Salvation.
The blessed and great effects of which depend, as I have showed, not upon any
natural power, or virtue, tranfused from the Ordeiners to the Ordained, but
upon the Word, Promise, and appointment of Christ, sending them in this method
of the Churches trial, approbation, and ordination; In which by the judgment
and conscience of those who are of the same function (and so best able to
examine and judge of gifts and abilities) the examined and approved is
publicly authorized and declared to be such a Minister, as the Lord has
chosen to be sent, such as the Spirit of Christ has anointed and consecrated,
by meet gifts and graces, for the service of Christ, and the Church, in that
great work of the Ministry: One, who is thus ordained, the Church may (in any
part of it) comfortably receive, and own in Christ's name; One, who is partaker
duly of the comfort of that promise from Christ, Mat. 28.
to be with his true Ministers to the end of the world; which could not be
verified, as interpreters observe of the persons of those then living, and
first sent by Christ (who were long since at rest in the Lord;) but of their
lawful Successors, rightly following them in the same office and power; Non
sunt successores in officio qui ad officium accedunt alio modo quam institutum
est. Reg. Jur.
without which they are not truly their Successors in the Ministry, and
authority from Christ: No more than they can be Ambassadors, Deputies, and
Messengers from or to any one, from or to whom they have no assignment of any
power, by letters, or other way of commission; which, when most legally and
formally done by deeds and instruments of writing; yet these receive no
natural change of their qualities, nor is any inherent virtue conveyed to
them, when they are made instruments to testify the Will, and convey the power
of any to another; but they have such a change in relation to their appointed
use and end, as alters them from what they were before in common and unlimited
nature.

The like is, as to religious ends and uses, where some men are specially
ordained to be Ministers, having all their efficacy and authority, as to that
work, from the will of Jesus Christ, from whom alone such power is derivable,
and that not in every way, which the vanity of men list; but in such as the
Church has constantly used, according to the Scripture Canons and directions;
which are clear to Timothy and Titus, which are the great paterns, and evident
commissions for right Ordination, and Succession to the Ministry, besides other
places; Against the undoubted Authority, and pregnant testimony of which
Epistles and Scriptures, joined to the Churches Catholic custom, it will not
be easy for any Novelist to vacate and abolish that holy Succession and due
Ordination, which the true Ministers of England have generally had in this
Church, which in my own experience, I cannot but with all truth and
thankfulness testify, to the glory of God, to the honor of this Church, and
those reverend Bishops, as Fathers of it, who not only with great decency and
gravity, but with much conscience and religious care, ordained Ministers, as
very many, so very worthy. Nor on the other side will these Novellers easily
persuade judicious Christians, That any upstarts, and pretenders in any other
way (which as it is poor and popular, so it comes very short and
unproportionate to what is required in, and of a Minister) can have the power
and Authority of true Ministers, Habentes cum iis consortium praedicationis
habeant necesse est and consortium damnationis. Tertul. de Haeret. auditoribus.
Jo. 2.8.
having no right Ordination; to which no man's pragmatick pride, and
self-confidence, nor the ostentation of his gifts to others by a voluble
tongue, nor the admiration and desire of his si ly and flattering auditors, can
contribute any thing, either as to the comfort of the one or the other; but
much to the sin and shame of them both, as perverters of Christ's order, and the
Churches peace; forsaking their own mercies while they follow lying vanities,
which cannot profit them.

17. Yet mere form of Ordination, makes not an able Minister.
Not that every man that is Ordained a Minister, as to the mere outward form, in
a right and orderly way, is presently of the essence and truth of a Minister in
Christ's esteem, or in the comfort of his own conscience; The ordained may be
such hypocrites (as Simon Magus was, when baptized) as have neither real
abilities, nor honest purposes, aiming at Gods glory, or the Churches good; but
merely at their own worldly ends, and base advantages; The Ordeiners also may
be either deceived in the judgment of Charity, or corrupted by humane lusts
and frailties, so as greatly to pervert and profane this holy Institution; No
man has further comfort of his being Ordained a Minister, than he has real
gifts, and competent abilities, together with an holy and honest purpose of
heart, to glorify God, (...). Baz. M. ep. 187. The ancient custom of the
Church receives none to be Ministers but upon strickt examination before they
are ordained. Council. Nic. 1. and ^he Council. Ca^ib. 1. c 9. takes care that
none be Ordained Presbyters without due examination.
in the discharge of that holy office and power, to which he is by the Church
appointed; Nor can on the other side, the Ordeiners more highly offend in piety
against God, and charity against the Church, than in a superficial and
negligent way of ordeining Ministers; which anciently was not done, but with
solemn public fasting, prayer, and great devotion. Indeed nothing should be
done in the Church of Christ with greater exactness, both for inward sincerity,
and outward holy solemnity, than this weighty and fundamental work of carrying
on the Ministerial power and authority in a fit and holy Succession; Abuses
here are prone to creep in, the Devil coveting nothing more, than to
undermine, weaken, and overthrow this main Pillar on which the Church and house
of God does stand; Ministers either unworthily, or unduly Ordained, are like
slight and ill built ships, which endanger the loss of themselves, and all
those that are embarked in them, and put to Sea with them; Miscarriages, in
the matter of ordination of Ministers, are to the unspeakable detriment, and
dishonor of Religion; as unskilful, cowardly, or perfidious Officers are to
Armies. I shall never hope to see the Church flourish, or truly reformed,
until this Point of right Ordination of Ministers be seriously considered of,
and duly restored to its Pristine honor and excellency; when to Ordein
Ministers for the service of the Church, O^ortet Ecclesiae Epis. and ministrum
Christi, esse formam justitiae, sanctimoniae speculum, pietalis exemplar,
veritatis doctorem, fidei defensorem, Christianorum ducem, sponsi amicum, and
cui ille irascitur, Deum sibi iratum non hominem sentiat. Bern. ad Eng. l. 4.
was not to prefer men to a Benefice, so much, as to recruit Christ's regiments,
to strengthen his forces, to fortify the Church and true Religion, with most
vigilant Watchmen, and valiant Champions, whose care was on every side to
defend the Flocks of Christ, against all enemies; which were to be as the Cloud
or Pillar of fire, both lights and guards to Christians, upon all occasions;
who made conscience to live with, to suffer with, yea and to die for the sheep,
as good Shepherds. Such men only are fit to be Ordained Ministers, such
Ministers ought to be prayed for, highly prised, and perserved in the Church,
by all that desire to transmit any thing of true Religion to Posterity; nor was
the Church of England, or yet is, destitute of such Ministers, both duly and
worthily ordained, to the service of Christ and this Church.

To abolish this order, or to usurp to undue hands, or to contemn this Sacred
and right Ordination, which sends forth able Ministers in Christ's way, can be
no other, but a most cruel and detestable sacrilege, far worse than that of
robbing the Church of its maintenance for such Ministers, Cyprian reproves
Novatus, a factious Presbyter, Quod Felicissimum satellitem suum, diaconum suum
constituit, ne^ sciente nec permittente me; sola sua factione and ambitione.

both as preaching and ruling well (which yet is a sin of so deep a die, that no
Niter can cleanse it, being seldom ever pardoned, because seldom repented of,
so as to make a ^ust restitution; without which, repentance is never true.)
Yea, for any Laymen, in a brutish violence, and merely by Ppular insolency, to
arrogate this power where it is not, or to abrogate it where truly it is is a
sin of a more heinous nature, than that of Simon Magus was, who had so much of
civility, justice, and good manners, as to offer money for a part of the
miraculous and Ministerial power. It is indeed no other than a Cyclopick fury,
and unwonted barbarity (ill becoming any sober or civilized Christians) thus
to wrest the keys of Gods house, out of the hands of those Stewards, with whom
the great Master Christ has specially entrusted them, for the right Economy,
and dispensing of all holy Mysteries and Institutions; And when such rude and
unruly fellows have thus insolenced these Officers of the Church, and bound
their hands; how comely will it be to see the keys of the kingdom of heaven,
Ischyras (...), Self-ordeined, or only by Rol^thus a Persbyter. Hence
Athanasius Apol. 2. (...), etc. Pro. 20.23.
managed, or committed, as it were, to Boys, to Pages and Laquies? to weak,
mean, mechanic, ignorant, dissolute, and riotous wretches, who not conscious
to any true Ministerial power, or just authority in the Church, can never make
conscience of doing any holy Ministerial duty, to which they are most unfit;
never caring how prodigal they are of the truth and honor of Religion; of
their own, or other men's souls; It being a sport to such proud and spiteful
fools, to do wickedly, to speak profanely, and to live disorderly in the
Church. And not content to commit a rape upon true Religion, and the holy
orders of Christ's Church, (as Absalom did on the housetop before the Sun, and
all Israel) they will further in time justify the flagitiousness of their
villainies; as if the zeal they had for true Religion, provoked to such outrages
these pestilent pandars for errors and all licentiousness, with their
followers, who must presently all turn preachers, though never duly Ordained,
nor fit ever so to be; yea, their arrogance makes them ordeiners too, of whom
they please to set up to minister to their extravagant lusts and follies, which
makes them many times much fitter for the flocks or cages, than for the
pulpits. These will surely come at last as much short of the happy effects of
true Ministers, as they are far from that holy power of right Ordination, which
I have proved to be from Christ and the Blessed Apostles, rightly derived to us
by the constant Custom of this and all Churches; and this not as a cipher, or
mere formality; but, as of sacred Institution, so of real and excellent
efficacy, and divine virtue in the Church, where duly used and applied. Which
was that I had to prove against the scurrillous objections of those, that seek
to despise and destroy the whole Function, Ordination, and divine authority of
the Ministry of this Church.

urged by their Adversaries against the true Ministers of the Church of
England, (whose due and right Ordination I have vindicated to be as Divine, so
both Necessary, and Efficacious) is as a forked arrow, sharpened with
Presumption and Prejudice; On the one side an high esteem and confidence which
they have of themselves; and a very low despicienty of all Ordained Ministers;
on the other side, even in that which is the highest honor of Man or Minister;
while these Anti-ministeriall Adversaries pretend, That the Ordained Ministers
have not the Spirit of Christ; nor can or ever do Pray, Preach, and administer
holy things by the Spirit: which these new Modellers challenge in such a
plenary measure, and power to themselves; that they justify their want of
ordinary abilities and endowments by their needing none: Excusing their not
studying, or preparing for what they utter, by their being specially Inspired.
Coloring over their well known idleness, ignorance, illiteratenesse, and
emptiness, by the shows of special Illumination, sudden Inspirations, and

Ministers; And this by the Spirit of Christ, which is extraordinarily given to
them; which suddenly leads them into all Truth, and enables them for all Duties
and Ministerial Offices: That this is their Call from God to Preach: and to
usurp the places of all Ordained Ministers; whom they pretend, as far to exceed
in Inspirations, as the Apostles did their former selves after once the power
of that Spirit was come upon them.

know well that the Spirit of Christ is a thing of pious curiosity, and holy

and sober obs^^^^tion; where the surest discoveries are made by those holy
fruits and effects, which are manifest in the habits of grace, or formations
of Christ in the new man of our hearts, or in the works of our life's; which
being done after a religious rule and way, are in the judgment of Charity to
be esteemed as effects of Gods Spirit.

I am far from doubting or denying, that the Spirit of Christ dwells in the
hearts of true Believers, by special gifts of grace; beyond Natures sphere;
nor do I question, but that the Spirit of Christ does furnish many men with
special gifts (above others) for the service both of Churches and States, in
the outward visible way of Gods providence; as to Bezaleel and Saul: Nor yet do
I deny but the Spirit of Christ may give extraordinary abilities (that is,
beyond others, and beyond men's own selves, as to former common gifts and parts)
for the good of the Church, in eases where ordinary means are defective: Nor do
I dispute this holy and usual influence of Christ's Spirit on Christians,
inlightning, opening, hatching, fostring, calming, composing, and specially
comforting in particular cases; Omnia sacra gusta^a afferunt mortem, si ^on de

also, quickening to duties, inabling in duties; yea sometimes supporting with
her^icall impulses and assistances in conflicts, temptations, and sufferings,
from men and devils; also reviving in dejections, desertions, darknesses, and
exhaustings of our own spirits and common gifts: All this I willingly grant;
and earnestly desire that I may have daily more experience of in my self, and
from others: not only for private comfort, but for public good of the Church
of Christ. C^^lum fit ^^i^^a habitatio Dei facta ^^^^ia prerogative, etc. B^^.
I desire highly to prize the happy privilege of those, that do truly enjoy
these inspirations, and humbly use them. I wish all true Christians a blessed
increase daily in this communion with God, and one another by real gifts of
the Spirit; which are beyond the best improvements of mere Nature; I know no
other heaven here or hereafter, Tepidorum and dissolutor^m est nolle esse

All that I fear, is, wilful hypocrisy, and weak delusions; that which I most

and lowdly to boast of among credulous and simple people; to which there can
hardly be given so exact and punctual answers and confutations, as both
Reason and Religion afford to sober and wise Christians in all other Disputes.

For such pretentions of Gods Spirit, 1 Ioh. 4.1.
and of special Inspirations (with which the primitive Churches were pestered
and abused, Jude 19.80 the Gn^sticks, Montanists, Catharists and others.
and by which the very Apostles were affronted and opposed) are as meteors and
comets, so exalting themselves in high notions, above the ordinary reach of
Reason, that they are not easily calculated by common accounts; they are
Raptures and Enthusiasmes, by which cunning men seek to lose the eyes of
spectators in clouds of obscurities and uncertainties: Like some vain and
lunatic Christians, who busy themselves more, how to interpret the
Revelation, and to fulfill its mysterious prophesies, then to understand,
Quantum ades^ vera Spiritus sancti grati^, tantum ^bes^ omnis ^an^ gloriola.

believe, and obey the holy truths and clear precepts of the Gospel in all the
other Scriptures: Holy, wise, sober, and humble Christians never boast, rarely
tell of those secrets of the Lord, if ever they enjoy them: Psalm. 25.14. Rev. 2
17. (...). Cl. Al. 51.7.
Vain, weak, and proud men do often arrogate those special inspirations to
themselves, as being least discernible or confutable by vulgar minds; who once
dazeled with the glisterings and flashes of pretended Inspirations, think they
may safely disregard, 2 Pet. 2.18. When they speak great swelling words of
vanity, they allure, etc.
and not look so low as the Scripture oracles, and the plain manifestations of
Christ by the Word, and his constant Ministry: Lead common people once into
this maze; wilder their weak fancies in the Wood of those strange speculations,
those unwonted notions, those pretty legerdemaines in Religion, which some men
(a^ Juglers) study more, than any solid trade of Piety; they are hardly able to
know (a long time) where they are, as to true Religion; or to find and own any
fair path of holy Truth, and Order, which might lead them out of that Fools
paradise, wherein some men take delight to lose themselves and others.

2. False and proud pretentions of the Spirit.
The ordinary Sophistry and craft: when men want solid ground and true
Principles of right Reason, Order, Law, and Justice, of Scripture Precept, and
holy examples from Christ, or any truly gracious Christians, whereby to
justify their opinions, or practices, their Transgressor p^aecepti Dominici
spurios sibi sociat Spiritus, and ad aerendo eis unus efficitur Demon. Bern.
Ser. Ben. Ab.
retreat is, (as Foxes when eagerly hunted) to hide and earth themselves in
this, The spirit has taught and dictated these things to them; or impulsed and
driven them upon such and such ways; which are in congruous, uncomely, unwonted
to, and inconsistent with, either the Catholic Ten ts, or Examples, generally
held forth in the Church of Christ, according to the plain sense and tenor of
the Scriptures; The Friars Mendicant p etended they had a fifth Gospel which
they called the Aeternum Evangelium; this they preached and defended, saying
the old Gospels must be abolished and theirs received. Mat. Paris. an. 1154.
Nauclerus. an. 1^54.
This is done with the same falsity, yet gravity and confidence, as Mahomet
persuaded the credulous Vulgar (by the help of Sergius a Monk) that his fits of
Falling Sickness and the device of his Pigeon, coming to his Ear where he had
accustomed to feed it, were Monitions and Inspirations, which he had from God
by his Blessed Spirit. Whose hypocritical sanctity G^ilielmus De Sancto Amore
(vir and doctrina and pietate illustris) opposed. Pope Alex. 4. caused their
blasphemous book to be burnt. Platina. Vit. Al. 4.
Just as weak and confused Writers of Romances, having not well laid the plot
and design of their Fancifull story, are wont to relieve their over venturous
Knights, with unexpected enchantments ((...):) which salve all inconveniences,
superate all hyperbolies, and transcend all difficulties, as well, as all rules
of Reason or Providence: So many men defective in their Intellectual, Moral,
and gracious Principles of true and sound Religion (which all sober Christians
own to be derived from, and directed only by the holy Scriptures, both in Faith
and Manners) they presently pretend the Spirit, to be Patron of their most
extravagant fancies and deeds; the Deviser of their most incredible opinions,
the Dictator of their most indemonstrable dreams; which no Jew, or credulous
Greek, or Gypsy, would ever believe; nor any man, who were not willing to
depose his reason, and to suffer a rash and fancifull credulity to usurp the
Throne and Sovereignty of his Soul.

This, in general, I may reply, to all those, that forsake ordinary Precepts,
and follow New Revelations, or pretend the special motions of the Spirit
against the constant Rules and Institutions of Christ in the Word; (and I may
tell it upon grounds of far greater certainty both of Reason and Religion, than
any of them can assure me or any man, that they have these special impulses
and graces of the Spirit, beyond others who walk in the ordinary way of means,
and received methods of Christian Religion.

1 John 4.1. First discovery by the Word of God. V. 3.
First, We are forbidden to believe every Spirit; because the Spirit of
Antichrist may pretend to the Spirit of Christ; we are commanded to try the
Spirits, whether they be of God or no; we are told, that every spirit which
confesses not that Christ is come in the flesh, is not of God, but is of that
Spirit of Antichrist, which is to come into the world; as Christ foretold, many
should come in his Name, and say, lo here is Christ, and there is Christ; But
believe them not: Mat. 24.23.
What I pray does more deny the coming of Christ in the flesh; (that is, by a
visible way of the Ministry to his Church in his person, and in his succession)
then to say, he is gone away again, without taking any Order, or leaving any
Command or Institution, for his Worship and Service to be continued in the
Church? by which his first coming might be made known, in Preaching the
Gospel; and confirmed by the Seals of the Sacraments, to his Church? To say
that Christ is so come now in the Spirit, here and there, by special
Inspirations, that he never came in that other old way of the outward, and
Ordained Ministry, of Word, and Sacraments; has so much of the spirit of
Antichrist, as it is against the evident testimony of the Word of Christ;
against the practice and the command of the Apostles; and against the Catholic
custom of the Church of Christ; which has always thus set forth and witnessed
the first coming of Christ, and must ever do so till his coming again: Which
second coming only shall put a period to the Word, Sacraments, and that true
Evangelicall Ministry, which now is by Christ Ordained in the Church: As the
first coming of Christ; did to the Leviticall Priesthood and Ministry by
Sacrifices, etc.

We know; That, as the Illuminating Spirit of God guides the humble, 2. Joh.
16 13. Ioh. 17.17. Sanctify them through thy truth, thy Word is truth.
meek and industrious souls into all saving necessary Truths; so these Truths
are confined to, and contained in the compass of those, which are already once
revealed to the Church by the Spirit in the Word of God; and which are by the
Ministry of the Church daily manifested, and in this way are sufficient to make
the man of God perfect to salvation, 2 Timothy 3.17. Which is that one anointing
from Christ and the Father, which has lead the Church into all truth by the
sure Word which the Apostles taught and wrote: so that no Christians have need,
that any man by any other spirit, or as from this Spirit, should teach them
more or other as to salvation, 1 John 2.27. They that gape to heaven for the
Manna of special Revelations, when they are not in the Wilderness, but in the
Canaan of Christ's true Church, may easily starve themselves, or feed on the
wind and ashes of fancifull presumptions, while they neglect, and despise the
ordinary provisions, God has made in his Church. It is clear, that whatsoever
is said or done, beyond or against this written Word of Christ, and surest rule
of the Church, is to be accounted no other, then apocryphal lying vanities, and
damnable hypocrisies. Hoc prius c^edimus, non esse ultra Scripturas quod
credere debeamus. Nobis curiositate non op^^ est post Christum, nec
inquisitione post Evangelium. Tertul. de prae. ad. Hae. c. 3.
No Spirit of Christ abstracts any man's faith from the Word; or carries his
practice against the Truth, Order, and holy Institution, which Christ has
settled in his Church; For it is most sure by all experience that the holy
Spirit teaches those Scripture saving-Truths, by the ordinary methods, and
orderly means, which the Wisdom of the same Spirit in Christ, has appointed to
be used in the Ministry of the Church; Ephesians. 3.10. Ephesians. 4.12.
which, who so proudly neglects, and so despises Christ in them, he may tempt,
grieve, and resist the Spirit of God; but he will never find the comfort of the
Spirit in his unwarranted extravagancies; which are but silly delusions and
baby-like novelties, having nothing in them of Truth, Holiness, or religious
Excellency, beyond what was better known, believed, and expressed before in
words and deeds, by a far better way; Christians ought never to turn such
children and fools, as to think Religion is never well unless it be in some new
dress and fashion, of unwanted expressions, and strange administrations: we
think that the Spirit of God teaches all humble, constant, and exact obedience
to the Word of God, without any dispensation to any men, at any time, in things
of Moral duty, and Divine Constitution, or Order, according to the several
relations and religious capacities of Christians: no real sufficiency of gifts
or graces does justify any Christian in any disorderly and unruly course of
acting, or exercising his supposed Inspirations in the Church; no more then
they do in the Civil Offices of State; Nor are these motions any thing of
Gods special call in regard of the outward Order and Policy of the Church,
where the ordinary way of Calling, Admitting, Ordaining, and sending forth
right Ministers, may be had in the Church.

3. The vanity of of their ways compared to the Word.
Be these impulses of the Spirit never so great, yet they put no good Christian
upon idleness, or presumption, so as not to use the ordinary means of study,
hearing, reading, meditating, conferring, praying, and preparing, etc. Nor
shall he either preserve, or increase, or profitably exercise any such gifts,
without study, industry and preparatory pains; which are the means by which God
blesses men with that Wisdom, Truth, Order, and Utterance, which are
necessary for the Churches good: The liberal effusions of some men's tongues;
their warm, and tragical expressions, (where there is something of Wit,
Invention, Reading, Method, Memory, Elocution, etc. in the way of Natural and
acquired Endowments) alas these are no such rare gifts, and special
manifestations of Gods Spirit, which these Anti-ministeriall men have so much
cause to boast of; There may be high mountains of such gifts ordinary, and
extraordinary, as in Judas the Traitor; which have no dews of grace falling on
their barrenness; Nor are these boasters of Inspirations manifested yet either
as equal, or any way comparable to most true Ministers in any sort, by any
shows of such gifts; for the most of which they are beholding to Ministers
labors and studies; with whose heifer these men make some shift to plough the
crooked and unequal furrows of their Sermons and Pamphlets. A little goes a
great way with these men, in their supposed Inspirations; and where they cannot
go far on, they go round, in circling Tautologies, snarled repetitions,
intricate confusions, which are still but the same skains of thread, which
other men have handsomely spun and wound up in better method and order; which
these men have neither skill nor patience fairly to unfold; but pull out here a

all true Methods of Divinity, and Order of found Knowledge.

measure and proportion, which is best for the whole: This place and calling
every Christian ought to own, and to attend; keeping within due bounds, till
God enabling, and the Church so judging, and approving of his abilities, he be
placed and employed in some way of Public service, into which to crowd, and
obtrude a man's self uncalled and unordained regularly by the Church, does not
argue such great motions of the Spirit, (which like strong liquor cannot be
kept in any vessel) but only evidenceth the corrupt spirits, the violent
lusts, and the proud conceits which are in men's Hearts.

Certainly all Gifts, Graces and Influences of Gods Spirit in truly gracious
and humble hearts, are in all Motions, Habits and Operations, as conform to the
Scripture (which are the Canon of Truth, Peace and Order in the Church) as any
right line is to that rule by which it is drawn; or as figures cast in the same
stamp and mould are exactly fitted to one another. The Truth of the Word, and
Graces of Gods Spirit cannot be separated, or opposed any more, than heat can
be parted in the Sun from its light, or its beams cross one another in crooked
and oblique angles.

than a proud and Satanicall delusion to fancy or boast, that the Holy Spirit
of Christ dwells there, in special Influences and Revelations, where the Word
of Christ does not dwell richly in all wisdom, Col. 3.16. The lodgings of the
Spirit are always and only furnished with the Tapistry of the Scriptures.
Else all imaginary furniture of any private spirits, leaves the heart but swept
and garnished with the new brooms of odd fancies, and fond opinions, to
entertain with somewhat more trim and composed dress, the unclean spirit; who
loves to dwell thus in the high places of men's souls; and hereby seems to make
the later end of those filthy or silly dreamers (in pride, Iud. 8.
vainglory, hypocrisy, and lying against the Truth; blaspheming the true
Spirit of Christ, contemning his holy and only true Ministry, and Ordinances,
and in all other licentious Apostasies) worse than their beginning was, in
ignorance, errors and terrors; or in plain dealing sensualities, and downright
profaneness; For it is more tolerable to be without the Spirit of God, Pope

than to lie against it, and blaspheme it, or oppose, and resist it, after some
knowledge of the Truth. It had been better for such men not to have known the
way of Christ's Spirit in the Scriptures and the Church: It is far more venial
to err for want of the Spirits guidance, and light, than to shut our eyes
against it, and to impute our Errors, Dreams, and Darknesses to it; It Is better
to have the heart wholly barren, than to lay our adulterous bastards to the
Spirits charge; when they indeed are issues of nothing but Pride joined to
Ignorance. 4. Like pretentions of old, confuted by men's practices.

or were suddenly, and at once endowed withal: few of these ever think they
want the Spirit, if they have but confidence to undertake any Ministerial work
and public Office. Yea and the best Christians, no less than the ablest
Ministers, find it hard in truth to obtain the sanctifying gracious influen^es
of Gods Spirit, by which with much diligence and prayer they are enabled to
private duties; nor do they find it so easy, to flesh and blood to obey,
those holy directions of the Spirit, or in conflicts to take its part against
the flesh; and to rejoice in the victories and prevalencies of the Spirit.
Whose public donations for the common good of Christians, (edifying them in
truth and charity) are chiefly manifested not only by his servants the true
Ministers: but in the blessing of that very Order, Office, appointment, and
function of the Ministry, Ephesians. 4.8. and 11.
both as instituted and a^ continued so long time, by the wisdom and power of
this Spirit of Christ. And by this great Gift of gifts, as by the Sun in the
Firmament, all others are ordinarily conveyed to private Christians, which
chiefly consist, and are manifested in true believers, not in quick strokes of
fancy, passionate raptures, strange allusions, and allegorical
interpretations, confused obscurings of Scriptures (which some men (with Origin
make so much of: In veritate qua illuminaris, in virtute qua immutaris, in
charitate qua inflammaris; serenata conscientia; subita and insolita mentis
latitudin^ praesentem spiritum intellige, Ber.
) but in bringing men from this childish futility of Religion, to a manly
seriousness; which sets the heart soberly to attend, read, hear, study, and
meditate on the Word of God; to prefer that Jewel before all the hidden
treasure of their own or others Fairy fancies: to assent to the saving Truths
both of Law and Gospel; zealously to love them, strictly to obey them; by
hearty repentance for sins against God or man, ingnuous confessions of them,
honest compensations for them, sincere amendment of them; hence it brings to a
quiescency, and comfort in no way, but such, as is conform to the Word of
Christ; burning with an unfaigned charity toward all men; most fervently to the
Churches service and welfare: with an In humili spiritu and pura mente spaciose

Institutions, and Ministry, his Word, and Spirit, and Grace; with a grateful
value, and high respect of those, Phil. 3.7. 1 These. 15.12.12, 13. Heb. 13.17.
by whose Ministry they have been called, baptized, taught, converted; and are
still guided in the paths, light and breathings of the Spirit, to the hopes of
salvation; the blessed expectation of which in Christ's way raises them up many
times to high, yet holy resolutions, to deny themselves, and suffer any thing
for Christ's sake, and the testimony of the Truth.

These, and such like (I conceive) are the best fruits of Gods Spirit; which
are not the less excellent, because they are common: Gods children are not often
entertained with novelties, and never pleased with such new toys, and ratles,
or hobbey horses in Religion which some men brag of. The wandering clouds,
which some men's fancies exhale, of spiritual Motions and Manifestations,
beyond plain and ordinary Christians, either for private comfort, Jude 12.
or for public benefit, are for the most part without water, they darken but
moisten not the Church, or the soul, they have so much of earthy or fiery
exhalations in them, that they have little of the dew of heaven with them; Nor
may they without great injury and high indignity be imputed to the Spirit of
Christ: Nor do such sorry flowers (which grow in every dunghill) adorn the
Garden of God, the Soul, or the Church; not justly crown any with the most
honorable name of holy or spiritual: Which titles vain men much affect and
boldly challenge; sober and humble Christians do earnestly desire, and
seriously endeavor to merit: Being an honor so far above the natural
capacity of sinful mortality, that nothing, but a Divine bounty and
supernatural power can confer the Truth of that Beauty, which is in
holiness; and the right to that glory, which is in every True Saint: who are
often hid, as orient Pearls in rough shells, in great plainness, lowliness
and simplicity; which makes such as are truly Saints and spiritual, as ashamed
to challenge the name, as they are afraid to come short of the grace: Studying
not applause and admiration from men, but the approbation of a sincere and good
conscience; 2 Cor. 1.12. Iam. 1.17.
Him they look upon as the father of every good and perfect gift; the sender of
the blessed Spirit, by the due Ministry of the Word, into men's hearts; The

Nor yet by arrogant boastings, uncharitable despisings, confident presumptions,
hasty assurances, proud persuasions, pretended Revelations, fanatic
confusions: All these, either in affected Liberties, or Monastic rigors, often
bear up men's fancy of the Spirit, and sanctity, (like bladders) merely by
their emptiness: Nothing being more prone to dispose a vain mind, to fancy
strongly, that it has Gods Spirit, than the not having it indeed: 2 Timothy 3.13.

and the way of the Spirit of Christ is: In its infallible rule, the Scripture;
in its noblest pattern, Jesus Christ; in its foundation, Humility; in its
beauty, Order and Symmetry; in its perfection, Sincerity; in its glory, Love
and Charity; in its transcendent excellency, the Divine Nature. The Devils
Piracles are made as much by the frauds and fallacies of hanging out Gods
colors, the flags of the Spirit, Hypocritae sanctitatis tineae: cui adhaerere

vertunt. Chrysostom.
and shows of holiness, as by the open defiances of persecution, and batteries
of profaneness; Delusions in Religion, as Dalilahs charms on Samson, are often
stronger, than the Philistines force against the Church; Else our blessed
Savior would not have so carefully forewarned and fore-armed his little
flock, against those grand Impostors; whose deceit is no less than this, Luke
17.21.
Lo here is Christ, and there is Christ: As if he were no where in England, or
in all the former Catholic Church; but only in the corners and Conventicles of
new Donatists.

Lo here is Christ! a most potent and plausible pretention indeed, able by its
native force, and man's credulous frailty to deceive even the very Elect; Mark.
13.22.
whom would it not move and tempt strongly to hear of a new Christ, in New
lights, and new Gospels, new Church ways, new Manifestations, new Ministry,
and new Ministers; Yea to hear of a Christ without means, above means, beyond
the Scriptures deadness, the old Sacramental forms, the Ministerial Keys
and Authority: Christ in the Spirit risen from the grave of dead duties; of
expired Ordinances; and from the Carkuses of ancient Churches; A Christ, who is
already come to judgment; with whom his Saints are now risen, and daily
rising; seeing him not as in a glass of means darkly, but by immediate
Visions, glorious Manifestations, special Inspirations, plenary Inhabitations;
thus fitting on Thrones and Reigning with Christ in his Kingdom?

Whom would not these Trumpets awake, and these alarms call forth? if we were
not forewarned by Christ; and if we had not seen such follies formerly acted
and manifested to all the Christian world; and sufficiently confuted in all
ages; which never amounted to more than Religious Tragedies; G^mi^a deformitas,
at nocumentum tragicum miserorum religiosa delicta.
for when the masks of personated Prophets, and necess^tous Saints, and hungry

tyranny, confusion; That those, who seemed to have come down from heaven in
the shows of the Spirit, and pretentions of Sanctity, were but Satan's
lightnings falling down from heaven, and his most abominable eructations out of
the bottomless pit.

If we other poor Christians, who still remain on the other side of this
Jordan, (which those Spiritosoes pretend to have passed) if we, who creep on
the ground, as worms and no men; who have daily cause to abhor our selves in
dust and ashes, who are forced daily to strengthen our faith, to renew our
repentance; to pour forth our souls often in sighs, tears, prayers, with broken
hearts and contrite spirits, contending with corruptions, wresting with
temptations; having enough to do to fortify our selves with the complete
armor of Gods Word, in Precepts, and Promises; and of his Spirit, in gracious
habits, excitations to, and assistances in duties: 2 Pet. 1.10.
Thus giving all diligence to make our calling and election sure: not counting
our selves to have comprehended, but pressing on to the mark of the price of
the high calling in Christ Jesus: Glorying in nothing but in the cross of
Jesus Christ, Phil. 3.14. Gal. 6.14.
by which we are crucified to the honors, riches, policies, successes,
flatteries, and glories of this inglorious world; yea to the Liberties,
Religions, Devotions, Sanctities, new Churches, new Reformations, and new
Ministers of this world; who forsaking the ways of Christ, and the holy
Apostles, and the ancient Churches, and the true succession of Ministers, and
all Power; have turned grace into wantonness, liberty into licentiousness,
godliness into gain; and very much embraced the present world; falling down
before Mammon, and worshipping the false gods of this world.

If we, who when we have suffered much, and done something in our endeavors
and purposes of holiness; yet find cause to cry out, Wretched men that we are,
who shall deliver us from this body of death! Romans 7.24.
if we could indeed believe; or find by experience, that the exaltations, and
Raptures of these new pretenders to the Spirit, were more comfortable, than the
bufferings of those good old Christians; That their triumphs in the world, were
beyond the others sufferings from the world, that there were more of Christ in
their new Crowns of glory, which they boast of, than in the others Crosses,
which they patiently bare; If we could discern a more self-denying Spirit, a
more Christ-enjoying Sanctity; That they were Saints, that is, Not crucifiers
of the world, but crucified to the world: If we could see the wounds of Christ
in these glorious apparitions; these Christ-like phantasms, (as Antony the
Hermit required, Non credam esse Christum nisi vulnera videam crucifixi. in
vita An^.
when Satan appeared to him like Christ in glory) If that Purity, Chastity,
Justice, Honesty, Contentedness, Patience, Charity, Meekness, Humility,
Peaceablenesse, Fidelity, Constancy and Orderlinesse, shined in them wherein
those holy men and women of old, the Professors, Confessors and Martyrs, not
getting but loosing Saints, imitated the holy Lord Jesus, and the most holy
God, according to the lively characters of true holiness, set down in the
Scriptures: If we saw such fruits of real holiness in their words, pens, and
actions, in their Doctrines and duties, in their self-denials and
Mortifications, in their meetings and Fraternities, in their Church Orders and
Ministrations, as might convince us, that these pretenders to the Spirit, and
despisers of the Ministers, have indeed more o^ that light, life and power of
the holy Spirit of God, than either true Christians or godly Ministers formerly
had, or now have in this, or any other true Church of Christ: How should we
envy their blessedness with an holy emulation? How should we, as Saint John to
the Angel (whom it may be he took for Jesus Christ) be even ready to fall at
their feet; Revel. 19 10.
to kiss their footsteps; to attend their directions; to imitate their
examples; to partake of their raptures; to pry into their third heavens; to
rise, ascend, reign and triumph; to enjoy the holy Spirit and Christ, and God
with them, to all which they in word and fancy pretend?

7. Fallacies in this kind frequent among Enthusiasts.
But the triple Crown of mere titular and verbal holiness (which is but copper
gilded over) moves us not, further than to pity the sinner; and to scorn the
pride: The Gnostics, Montanists, Catharists of old, the later rude, and cruel
phanaticks in Germany cried ((...)) holy, holy, holy to their parties and
factions: As if there were holy ambitions, holy seditions, holy covetousnesses,
holy sacri^edges, holy obscenities, holy cruelties, holy confusions in the
conversations of true Christians and spiritual men; Or holy ignorances, holy
errors, holy darknesses, holy heresies, holy schisms, holy hypocrisies in
their hearts and spirits: As if no duties, no Scriptures, no Sacraments, no
Ministry, or Ministers, no Government, or Governors of the Church were
heretofore holy, which were primitively, and universally, and constantly owned,
and observed in the Church of Christ, as derived from him; As if private
fancies, and solitary dreams, and single imaginations of weak and silly men, or
women, were now holyer, or had more in them of the Spirit, than the public
Oracles of the sure Word of God; which the Catholic Church has received from
God by the hands of holy men; and by a constant succession of an holy Ministry
has delivered to us, with constancy and fidelity (as to the main:) however
particular branches or members of this Church may have failed and withered. If
these Antiministeriall Novellists have nothing whereby to set off their
pretended gifts of the Spirit, and singular holiness, but only novelty, fancy,
and uncertain Inspirations, nothing to cry down all former holy ways of the
Church, but this; that they are conform to all Antiquity and Scripture
regulations; The least beam of whose glorious light always either equals, or
far exceeds their new either superfluous, or dubious illuminations; Truly they
must give all learned and godly Ministers together with all judicious and sober
Christians leave, Potius vetera and tuta quam periculosa and nova sectemur. Tac.
to pass by the Idol of their new dressed Spiritually and Sanctity, without
any admiration, devotion or the least salutation: Nor can we at all consider
private spirits, warped from; and bent against the public Spirit of Christ,
in the Scripture, in the practice of the Catholic Church; and in the most
eminent Christians, both ancient and modern.

We shall content our selves with that plain and pristine holiness, and
manifestations of the Spirit, True holiness and true Saints. Sanctitas est
scientia colendorum deorun. Tul. de Not. D. (...). Plato. in Eutyp.
which are expressed in the Word; deposited in the Church; preserved in an holy
Ministry; exemplified in all true Christians: and most eminently in Jesus
Christ and his Apostles, the great and famous Founders, Teachers and
Establishers of holy Truths, holy Duties, holy Sacraments, holy Orders, and
holy Ministry in the Church: And this with divine Power and Authority, not
only personal, but successionall; without which the instituted Service and
Worship of Christ had ere this failed. These being ever since Christ's time in
all the world, employed in Teaching, Gathering, Baptizing, Governing, Feeding,
Preserving, and Perfecting the Body of Christ, which is his Church: We know
not, and so we cannot desire, other holiness, than that, by which we believed
the Truths, obeyed the Commands, feared the Threatenings, observed the Duties,
preserved the Institutions, continued the Orders, reverenced the Ambassadors,
joyed in the Graces, hoped in the Promises; and were led conformably to Christ
by that Spirit, which Jesus Christ had given to his Church, long before these
new coyners had graven the stamps, or set up their Mint^: We are glad, and
bless God, when we attain unfaignedly to that Spirit of Holiness, which hears
the Word of God with fear and trembling, from the mouth of those able and godly
Ministers, which are the Messengers or Angels sent from Christ, by the Churches
Ordination: Which teaches us, to pray with understanding, constancy,
fervently, and comeliness; to receive the pledges of Gods love in Christ from
their hands (duly consecrating the holy mysteries) with reverence,
preparedness, and thankfulness; That holiness, which loves with sincerity,
gives with cheerfulness, rejoices in well doing, suffers with patience, lives
by Faith, acts by Charity; is holy with order, contentedness and humility,
without any fury, faction or confusion.

That holiness which has nothing in it novell or praeterscripturall; nothing
fancifull, verbal, tumultuary, violent, (...). Plat. Eu^yph. S^nctum est quod
deo gratum.
schismatic, disorderly, partial, pernicious, or injurious to any; which
chooses to be a Martyr for Charity and Unity, as well as Verity, in the Church:
rather suffering much than giving scandal or making a schism, according to the
pious and excellent cou^s^ll of Dionysius to Novatus. (...). Dionys. Ep^st.
Au^ea. apud Eusch. l. 6. hist. c. 38.
That holiness which is old, as the Ancient of days, real, rational,
demonstrative from the Word of God, and exemplified in the lives of former
Saints: Which is meek, courteous, charitable, humble, just to all men,
abounding with all righteousness, and the fruits of righteousness, peace, and
establishment, both to private consciences, and public Churches. That
holiness, which has nothing in it supercilious, calumniating, defamatory,
insolent, bitter or burdensome to any true Christians, true Churches, and true
Ministers, which know how to reprove, what is amiss, without rejecting all
that is well; to reform the crooked, without ruining what is right. That
holiness, which, as the Sunbeams is always like it self; like the Father of
spiritual light; uniform and constant in all true Saints, in all ages, and in
all administrations Divine, either immediate, or mediate; as to its rule, the
Will and Word of God; as to its end, the glory of God, in Gods way; as to its
Epitome, or sum, the love of God, and its neighbor; as to its happy fruits and
effects, the good of mankind, chiefly of the Church of Christ: These have ever
been the same for kind, however differing in degrees, according to the measure
which God has given to his true Saints and servants; who never differed from
God, or the Word, or one another, as they were holy and spiritual, however, as
men and carnal in part, they had their crookedness, unevennesses, and
dissentings.

These are the fruits of Gods Spirit, this that true Holiness, for which we
pray, of which we dare not boast: These are the Saints, whose shadows we count
Sovereign; whose presence a blessing; whose ways unblameable; whose joys
unspeakable; whose works most imitable; whose conversation most amiable,
heavenly and divine; who choose rather to suffer, than any way to act in cases
dubious, as to secular dissensions, which have much of the Beast, somewhat of
the Man, and little of the true Christian: The worth of these Pearls is
infinitely beyond some men's, counterfeit forgeries, whose luster is chiefly
from worldly glory, and secular advantages; who out of ashes are melted up to
the shining and bricklenesse of glass, by the fervor of some spirits; who
think it enough to glister with novelties, and to boast of Inspirations;
fancying all is reformed, which is but changed, though much to the worse; who
are forced to set off themselves by the soil of severe censuring of others;
Fearing nothing so much as a true light; and those discoveries which are made
of them by serious and judicious Christians; who judge not by men's lips, and
appearances, but by their lives and practices, compared to the Word of God; For
which, true Ministers, most eminently and impartially holding forth to the
discovery of all men's deformities, are of all men most abhorred by these
pretenders; who at a true and full view will not only not appear to other such
gifted men, and spiritual, as they pretend; but they will be ashamed of their
arrogance, and despite against those good Christians, and those true Minisers
whom they have so much vilified and contemned.

whose tongues are only tipped with Sanctity, and the name of the Spirit, is
this, That they know not indeed of what Spirit they are, as to Profession; Nor
consider of what Spirit they ought to be, as to temper, if they will be truly
Christ's Disciples; Contenting themselves with light and airy presumptions, in
stead of serious and searching examinations of truth: comparing themselves with
themselves, they fancy they grow holyer, as they grow bolder in their opinions,
or actions: Hence they are easily flattered into high Imaginations, and cheated
with strong Presumptions; as if some common gifts of knowledge, some Scepticall
quickness, some volubility of utterance, some Scripturall expressions, which
they have attained beyond their former selves, or their equals, were rare,
immediate, and special gifts of the Spirit. Then, because they should seem no
body, if they carry their small wares in an old pack, Quos diabolus a veritatis
via in veleri charitate detinere non p^tuit, novi itineneris erro^e
circumscribit, and decipit. Cyp.
they invent some new fashion of Religion; or some model of a Church Way,
which they strongly fancy; after they have once brought forth their fancy to
any form and shape, they are strangely inamored with it, all old figures never
so uniform, Catholic, and comely, seem deformed, ugly, Antichristian: Then
follows those quick emotions, and stirrings upon their spirits, which have the
quicknings, only of Self in them; these are presently cried up for motions, and
(...), The Marcionites had private lectures, which they called Manifestations
or Illuminations; from a Prophetess, Philumena. Tertul. prae. ad Hae. c. 44.
manifestations, and excitations, and impulses of Gods Spirit on them; then,
they are easily moved to extraordinary heats, and irregular vehemencies, as
counterfeit possessed are, by the looking on and applauses of others, whose
silliness makes them gentle spectators, and obsequious admirers of any thing,
that seems new to them, or is above them. Nothing troubles these pretenders so
much, as if you look too near and too narrowly on their practices. Impostoribus
nihil est lumine inimicitius.
Nothing angers them so much, as what they fear, may discover them: you must
not ask them, where are their miracles, where their Empire over Devils; where
their languages; where their prophecies; either as predictions of things to
come, or as interpretations of obscure Prophecies in the Scripture, referring
to Jesus Christ? These questions (though they are but just to be put, where
extraordinary Inspirations are pretended) are too hard for them: these pose
them, and afflict them, when they are thus urged by Ministers, or any sober
Christians; who expect no satisfactory answer, in any of those particulars,
(which are the proper effects and demonstrations of the Spirit, in its
extraordinary motions,) when indeed they observe in these pretenders, so little
of ordinary, sound and saving knowledge; so nothing of that meekness of
wisdom, which every true Christian, in whom the Spirit of Christ dwells,
injoyes in some measure; so utter desolation of any thing, that may argue any
thing extraordinary and excellent, which may justly own the Spirit of Christ,
for its special Author and infuser. But quite contrary; gross ignorance in
many things; yet puffed up with intolerable pride, poisoned with errors,
kindled with passions sharpened with violence, delighting in furies, boasting in
discords, schisms and confusions, either begun, or increased, or continued by
the restless agitations of their fierce and unquiet spirits: whose impetuous
temper is impatient of nothing so much, as true Christian patience; of Peace,
Order, and charitable harmony in any part of the Church of Christ; There is
nothing they can less endure, Magi and Augures nihil suis actibus successurum
Iuliano affirmabant, nisi Athanasium primo velut omnium obstaculum sustulisset.
Ruff. l. 1. c. 32. Hist. Ecc. Gal. 1.7.
than able, learned, godly and resolute Ministers, in whom dwells (indeed) a far
more excellent Spirit of God; full of wisdom, of power, of courage, full of
Christ; who can and dare detect the deceits and juglings of these vain minds:
manifesting their folly, discovering their nakedness, emptiness, and
nothingnesse in respect of any extraordinary Illuminations, or Inspirations of
Gods holy Spirit in any way of Religion: After all the cry, and noise, and
glorying of these men's inspirings, at the best, all amounts to no more, than
the same Gospel, the same Duties, the same Sacraments, the same Jesus, the
same God, who was with far more knowledge, purity, peace, love, zeal and
constancy owned, served and honored in this and other Churches, in that
ancient way and holy Ministry which the Church ever used; which Christ
instituted, and with which God was so well pleased, that he blessed it, as the
means, to preach the Gospel, to plant Religion, to settle and govern the
Church in first and after times, amidst all the persecutions and heresies that
opposed it. This is the best of their Inspirings; the setting of some new
gloss and fashion on Christian Religion, whose purity and simplicity like
gold, cares not be thus painted over.

But take these Inspired men in their degenerations, depravings and worstings
of Religion, and you will easily see, how such equivocall generations and
imperfect mixtures, and mere monsters of Religion, presently putrify and
pervert to error, faction, licentiousness, violence, rapine, civil
oppressions, tyrannies, against all that applaud not, or approve not the rarity
of their conceits and inventions; which first kindle with modest sparks,
Modestiora sunt errorum initia; and blandientia venena; Lactant.
as if they would enlighten, warm, and refine the Church, Religion, and
Ministry; but after they have got to them vulgar fuel, they arise to such
dreadful flames and conflagrations, as threaten to consume all that was ever
built before them: that so the goodly Palaces of ancient and true Religion
being demolished, they may have a clearer ground, where on to set up the feeble
cottages of their new framing and erecting. Poor men! thus once Omnes tument,
omnes scientiam pollicentur: ante sunt perfecti quam eslocti. Tertul. de Hae c.
41.
puffed up with their tympanies of self conceptions, and getting into some
warmer Sun, having once over-looked their first errors, they never after have
leisure, patience, or humility to discern the gross yet secret distempers,
which are in their spirits; Not raptures and gifts, but humility and charity
give the greatest evidences and surest instances of Gods Spirit, and of
salvation.
the many distinctions, and disguises, and windings, by which worldly lusts,
passions, and interests slily creep in, and concealedly work in their hearts,
even then most securely, (and so most dangerously) when under this blind of
Gods Spirit; when the Lord shall be entitled to the whole plot and project of
their follies and furies, both in its softer beginnings and its rougher
proceedings.

Of these fallacies in point of special Inspirings and motions of Gods Spirit,
there are no surer detections than these: 1. 9. Evidences of their folly.
That these so moved and active spirits do always find less content, and
pleasure in, have less zeal and contention for the great things of God, (which
are Faith, Righteousness, Peace, and Holiness) than they do for their little
novelties and fancies: 2. They find less comfort and joy in themselves, to be
kept within, and humbly to walk in those holy bounds of religious Truth and
Order; (which the Word of God has clearly set before them, and all holy
Christians, and the purest Churches always observed) than to be always busily
disputing for, and acting over those petty parts of their scruples, novelties,
and extravagancies; Which have nothing in them but a verminly nimblenesse and
subtlety, being bred out of the putrefactions of men's Brains, and the
corruptions of the times, in matters of Religion; and are rather pernicious,
than any way profitable, in comparison of the more sober strength, and
usefulness of nobler creatures: Nor is it by gracious persons disputed, but
that one serious Christian of the old stamp, one able and faithful Minister of
the Church of England, whom these so contemn and hate, has heretofore done,
and still does more good, and gives, greater demonstrations of the Spirit of
Christ dwelling in him, with wisdom, gravity, learning, humility, diligence,
peaceablenesse and charity, (by which many have been restrained or converted,
from sin: or established and confirmed in the ways of God) than whole heaps of
these novel Teachers, and swarms of Inspired pretenders, who like drones do but
seek to rob the hives and starve the Bees: who serve (in some fits) to scratch
itching ears, to some tune of pleasure, liberty, profit, novelty, or
preferment; but not to teach the ignorant, to settle the shaken, to compose the
tossed, to heal the wounded, or to wound the ulcerated Consciences of any men
to any soundness of mind, or true holiness of manners.

Aedificantur in ruinam, illuminantur in caciores teneb^as.
Their Proselytes are rather perverted, than converted; made theirs by a
schismatic and factious adherence; rather than Christ's by a fiduciary
obedience; or the Churches by a charitable and humble communion; Faction and
confusion and every evil work are the fruits of pertinacious and pragmatick
ignorance, as Union, Peace, and Charity, are the genuine effects of sound
knowledge and humble wisdom; In which ways only true Christians have ever
judged the highest gifts and graces of Christ's Spirit to be both derived and
decerned. I am sure there is a vast difference between a wanton Fancy and a
holy Spirit, between a glib Tongue and a gracious Heart. We may add to these
discoveries of fallacious pretentions to the Spirits special motions;
Abominanda religionis ludibria colentia temporum rations, non leges Dei. Naz
or. Lat. Hypocritarum pietas est temporum aucupium. Cyp.
That, both in the first broaching, and after drawings forth of their new
projects and inventions, the authors of them more look to men, than to God; how
it may suit with secular aims, and politic interest, private or public,
than how it sorts with Gods Word, or the rule of Christ, or the Churches
practice in purest times; or its present distresses; whose frame as to the main
both for Doctrine, Ministry, and Government, has always been the same, both
in times of persecution and of peace; when favored and disfavoured hy men; And
such it ever was in England, and possibly it will be if it outlive this storm;
I am sure these Novelties so much opposing this Church, and true Ministers in
it, would never have so quickened by any inward heat of Spirit, if they did not
presume that the Sun did shine warm on them; which yet is no infallible sign of
Gods blessing; If these Antiministeriall adversaries, these now so Inspired
men, (who join in their plots, and power, and activity, by which they either
secretly undermine, by evil speaking and separating from the public
Ministry; or openly invade and arrogate the Office; or wholly deride and oppose
the Function;) if they expected nothing but Winter and persecution, and such
measure as they mete; I believe it would damp their spirits very much: They
would then think it a part of prudence in a Christian Spirit, to sleep in a
whole skin; by keeping themselves in that station, wherein God, and the Laws
both of Church and State have set them: As they did very warily, in those
times, when there was just power restraining them in those due bounds, which
then they thought became them best; and they would no doubt have thought so
still, (for all the fulness of their spirits and ebullition of their rarer
gifts) if strange indulgences in matters of Religion, and Church Order had not
tempted them to safe extravagancies, and unpunished insolences, chiefly
against the Church, and Church men.

In other things, of civil affairs, where it is very likely their spirit
prompts them, as much to be meddling (because more is got by those activities:)
they know how to keep their spirits in very good order; being overawed with
evident danger, attending any factious, seditious or tumultuary motions; None
of these small spirited m n (who are seldom little in their own eyes) are
powerfully moved to usurp any place in the Council of State; to arrogate the
office and authority of an Ambassador or public Agent; to set himself in the
Seat of Justice un commissioned; or to intrude into any place Military, or
Civil, without a Warrant from other, than their own forward spirits; though
their pride and ambition ( 2 Samuel 15.3. Nunquam defuit ambitioso praeclara sui
ipsius opinio, and summa de seipso expectatio. Sym.
like Absaloms) may fancy, they could better dispatch business, do exacter
Justice, and speedier, than any in Authority; yet here, the danger and penalty
of intrusion cowes their zeal, curbs their heady spirits, and cuts their
combs: Nor are they often either so valiant, or so fool hardy, as to act by
their pretended impulses in any way, but where they think there may be safety;
which they now find (as from many men) in what ever they say, or do, against
the honor, order, and Ministry of this reformed Church of England: which they
see has not many soldiers to defend it; nor advocates to plead for it; nor
Patrons to protect it. Wanton and petulant servants which were formerly but as
the Job 30.1. Insolentioris animi propri^ est, calamitosam viriutem indigne
tractare, dicteriis appetere; injuriis afficere; and de iis quae immerita
patitur maxim exprobrare. Plin.
dogs of the flock, will easily insult over the children of the family, when
they see them Orphans, and exposed to injuries: either wanting true Isa. 49.23.
Nursing Fathers and Mothers, or these wanting that tenderness toward them,
which is hardly to be expected in step-mothers, and only titular parents. It
is no adventure for timorous beasts to go over, where they find the fence
trodden down, and the gap made wide; So, much more prevalent with vain and
proud men are the impressions of fear from men, than those from God, whose
commands and threatenings are attended with Omnipotent Justice, which is slow
paced, but sure; Nor do I doubt, but those subtle and insolent enemies against
this Reformed Church and the Ministry of it, do already Prima est baec ultio,
quod se Judice nemo nocens absolvitur. Iuv. Occultum quatienti animo tortore
flagellum. Id.
find the first strokes of Divine Vengeance in their own ungrateful breasts.

The further trial of these pretenders to the Spirit, I must leave to the
impartiality of judicious Christians, in that experience which they have of the
fruits which they bring forth. What truths of God have these Antiministeriall
adversaries ever brought forth, or further cleared and illustrated, than was
before? What weighty controversy or other question in Divinity, polemicall or
practical, have they learnedly and solidly stated? What part of obscurer
Scripture have they well interpreted? What body of Divinity have they blessed
this Age withal, beyond what it formerly enjoyed in great variety and plenty?
What cases of Conscience have they more cleared or better decided? Is either
Law or Gospel beholding to them? yea rather; how have some men studied to make
void the Law by immorall licentiousness? and the Gospel too, by such not free
but rather profuse and prodigal grace, as excludes those holy conditions of
repentance, Jam. 2.17.
and good works, which the Gospel requires as necessary concommitants and
fruits of true and lively Faith? What Scripture have they handled which they
have not tortured, mangled, and broken the very bones of it? What controversy
have they not more studied to pester and entangle? What truth have they not
darkened with their cloudy words and senseless notions, which they call
glorious heights? What heresy have they not revived? What poisonous Error have
they not tampered with? What sin and enormity have they not palliated, or
excused, or applauded, as the effect, either of Christian liberty or necessity?
How many simplier Christians Faith have they subverted? persuading them they
never had Christ rightly preached to them; nor were in any saving Church Way,
till these Inspired Teachers came to direct them, how to cast off and despise
their Ministers and the whole Office of the Ministry.

10. How short they come of that Spirit which shows it self in true Ministers.
Neither then the Word of God, nor right Reason, not sober Sense will give
testimony of any special gifts of the Spirit in these men, either in
knowledge, or in wisdom, or in utterance, or in any grace or virtue; In all
which they are nothing in regard of many Ministers and others, who as far
excel them, as gold does brass, and silver lead; Nor are their fruits to the
public and to others, any way proportionable to their boasting against the
Ministers: which is as far from truth, as it is from humility; if these may be
measured and esteemed, not by proud swelling words of themselves; or by high
scorns, and rude contempts of others; but by the exactness of holy walkings,
and the fruitfulness of public labors on the hearts or lives of others.

Hanc habet invidia in seipsa poenam, aut non videre, aut nolle videre, aut
malign videre virtutem alienam, quam nescit imitati. Gerson.
Herein no ignorance, or envy, or calumny can be so wilfully or resolvedly
blind, (but only in these men) as not to see and acknowledge, That God has
given witness from heaven, against the crooked and perverse generation of
these detractors from, and destroyers of, the honor of the Ministry of England;
by the eminent Learning, Piety, Zeal, Industry, Fidelity, Charity, Patience,
Constancy and vigilance of many centuries, yea many thousands of able, and
godly Ministers, both in the restoration, and preservation of Truth, Purity,
and Power of the Christian Reformed Religion in this Church; others have sought
the goods of this Church, but these the good of it. I could here fill many
Volumes (as many Ministers (both godly Bishops and Presbyters) in this Church,
have done, by their acute, solid, devout, and most profitably pleasant
writings) with the histories of many of their lives, (some of which are
registered to posterity by commendable pens: others by tolerable ones, whose
grateful design is good; but their historique faculty far short of those
merits, which they seek to eternize. How eminent have they been, as Moses, in
all good learning? how indefatigable in their labors? how dear, useful, and
desirable to all good and excellent Christians in their lives and deaths? What
Trophies they have not gained over the adversaries of our Christian and
reformed Religion, by their Prayers, Sermons, and most incomparable Writings?
No less have been their many and renowned Victories, which they have obtained
over the very Devils; whom a long time they kept, as it were in awe and in a
chain: How many sinners have been redeemed from his snares, and converted from
the evil and errors of their ways by their powerful Ministry? How many
fiery darts of Satan have they quenched? How many weak hands and feeble knees
have they strengthened? How many remorselesse souls have they wounded;
piercing between the scales of Leviathan by the two-edged sword of God in their
mouths? How many wounded Consciences have they (like good Samaritans) healed
with the balm of Gilead? How many doubting and despairing spirits have they
revived and established? How many mouths of aliens have they stopped, by the
unanswerable pregnancy of the truths, which they have cleared and mightily
maintained? In fine; before ever the croaking Frogs of Egypt spread over the
land, and filled every place with their importune and insignificant noises,
against the Ministers and Ministry of this Church; (seeking by their muttering
clamours to contend with the Nightingales; and to silence the sweet fingers of
Israel;) how were the excellent Ministers of this Church, and the famous
Ministry hereof, esteemed at home and abroad among the chiefest blessings, for
use, and noblest beauties, for ornament, which this or any Nation and Church
ever enjoyed? Being as the two goodly pillars of Solomon's Temple, sustaining
the burden, and adding to the beauty of Religion; being sacred Oracles for
holy direction, and great examples for virtuous imitation.

In what part of good learning have not some of the Ministers of England
excelled, and some of them in all? What divine or humane truth have they not
handled, cleared, and asserted? What controversy in Religion have they not
rightly stated, fully disputed, and solidly determined? What part of practical
piety, and Devotion have they not illustrated, and adorned in their Writings,
with most sweet, suasive, and pathetick flowers of holy Oratory, mixed with
truths, gathered out of the gardens of God, the Scriptures, and their own pure
Consciences? What Scripture have they not commented upon, learnedly,
methodically, clearly, and succinctly? Yea what Text (almost) in the whole
Bible, Old or New, Law or Gospel, History or Prophecy, Psalmodicall, or
Epistolicall, have not the Ministers of England preached and printed upon with
accuratenesse and judgment? So that the quintessence of the Sermons, set forth
by them in this Church, would in the judgment of the learned Lord Verulam make
one of the most exact, and absolute Commentaries on the Bible, that ever was.
It were endless to enumerate the names, the excellencies, the learned works,
the holy fruits and blessed successes, which have attended the Ministers of
this Church; whom one would have thought to have been set so above any such
envy, and malice, and sacrilege, never any Reformed Christians would ever have
so maligned and despised, as to have sought to destroy them and their function:
Nor can I indeed in charity think, any do so that are truly such.

The excellencies of the Antiministerials.
As for their bitter enemies and rivalls, these Inspirators, on the other side;
I am ashamed to shame them so much, as I must needs do, if I should show the
world their emptiness, shallowness, penury, meannesse, nothingnesse, as to
Reason, Religion, Learning, common Sense, pack-staffe Oratory; How gross,
confused, raw, flat, insipid, affected they are in speaking or writing; how
dark in doctrine; how disorderly in disputes; how impotent in persuasion; how
impertinent in reproof; how unauthorative in all they say, and do, as
Teachers; What perfect Battologists they are; what circles they make, and
rounds they dance in their Prayings and Sermonings; strong only in cavilling,
and railing, and calumniating against true and able Ministers: And for their
writings, with which they have lately so crammed and abused the world; how
little have they set out to any other purpose, save only to wast a great deal
of good paper; and to make the world believe, they were richly laden, because
they spread so large sails? How do their pamphlets cheat the well meaning
buyers and readers with the decoy of some very specious and spiritual title;
as if all were Manna, and Aarons rod, which were in their Arks; when there is
nothing but such emblemes, for the most part, 1 Samuel 6.4.
of Mice and Emrods, as the Philistines put into the Ark of God, as memorials
of their sin, their shame, and punishment? What Reader may not tear their
books, with turning the leaves to and fro, before ever he finds acuteness, or
solidity; learning, or piety; Truth, or Charity; Divinity, or Humanity;
Spirituals, or Rationals; but only antic fancies and affected words,
strangely deforming ancient and true Theology, in its morals, mysteries and
holy speculations; How much better had they wrote nothing, than so much, to so
little good purpose, to so evil an intent; only to amuse the simple reader,
with shows of rare notions; and by spiritlesse Prefacings, to lead on their
ruder steleticks and declaimings against the Order, Government, Religion,
Ministers, and Ministry of the Church of England; in which their scriblings
they mix so much copperass and gall with their ink, that they eat out all
characters of Truth, Candor or Charity in their Papers, never affording them
any word that may either savor of civility, as to ingenuous men; or of
Justice, as to men of good learning and some merit; but all is written to
deform them, their calling and Ministry, to expose them to vulgar scorns, to
fit them for public victims to the cruel malice of the enemies of the
reformed Religion. Indeed against the Ministry and Ministers of England they
choose to write with Aqua fortis rather than any ink; and covet red ink rather
than black, trusting more to their swords than their pens; nor do they confide
so much in their Brains, as their hands; their insolency being far beyond their
inventions; which tempts them rather to pistol Ministers by desperate
Assasination, than to dispute with them in the Schools or by the Press.

Nor is this any envious or injurious diminution of these men, 11. It is no
detraction or injury to prefer the Ministers of England before these pretenders
to Inspiration. 2 Cor. 12 11.
(who owe most of the good feathers they have to the preaching and writings of
the Ministers of England, and not to any Inspirations:) but it is a just
representation of their ungrateful vanity, and the Ministers real worth, who
have excelled, wherein soever these pretenders are most defective: And
defective they are in all things, wherein able and true Ministers have most
excelled. If this stroke of my pen seems any thing of uncomely boasting, they
have compelled us to it, and so may the better excuse, and bear with this our
folly; which is not yet such, by their provoking examples of vapouring and
vanity, but that we know by Gods grace how to own, what ever is of God in any
of them; and to ascribe what ever is good in Ministers, Pro defensione famae
licita and honesta est la^^ propria. Reg. Jur. Dese^sio est, non arrogantia.
Amb. s. 118.
to the grace and bounty of God, who has magnified his power in their
weakness; And however we, now living, be Nothing, yet our excellent
Predecessors, by whom the honor of this holy function has been rightly
derived to us, have merited from us, and all good men this acknowledgement to
the praise of Gods grace.

The blessings which have come to this Church and Nation by the true Ministers.
That the godly, able and faithful Ministers in this Church of England have by
Gods blessing been the great restorers and conservators of good learning in
this Nation; the liberal diffusers of ingenuous education; the valiant
vindicators of the reformed Religion; the commendable examples of piety and
virtue, in all kinds restraining, and reforming all sin, error, excess,
profaneness, and superstition, by their good lives and doctrine; Teaching and
encouraging all manner of holiness, civility, candor, meekness, gravity, and
charity, throughout the whole Nation; What noble, worshipful, or ingenuous
family has not, or might not have, been bettered by them? (if they did not
entertain them at illiberall rates, and ignoble distances: as too many used to
do, below the honor of their calling, and merit of their worth:) What City,
or Country Village has not been beautified, and blessed by them? Where ever
such Ministers lived, as became the dignity of their place, and profession,
there has always followed a good sense of piety, and a comely face both of
Civility and Religion; And more might have been improved in every corner of the
land, long ere this, if, what has been often vapoured and flourished, had been
really performed; that is, the settling of a competent maintenance every where
for a competent Minister. Cogit ad turpia necessitas. Non habet virtus inimicam
praeter paupertatem and invidiam. Eras. Et ornamentum and munimentum urbis and
Ecclesiae, Ambrosius.
Scandalous livings have been no small cause of too many scandalous Ministers;
whom necessity often compelled to things uncomely, both for their society and
support. Upon whose sores these flesh-flyes^, the enemies of the Ministry, are
always lighting and biting; loath to see, or hear of, those many incomparable
Ministers, who have been in many places of this Church, as Saint Ambrose was
said to be in Millain, both the ornament of the City and defense of Religion:
In stead of whom, some new Jesuitick Modellers would fain bring a company of
Locusts and Caterpillars upon the face of the land, a sort of illiterate and
unordained Teachers, who like ambulatory Arabs, or wandering Scythians, must
every week or month change their quarters, as fast, as they have devoured silly
widows houses: These in a short time will not be much beyond Cantors and
Vagrants; As the old Circu^celliones.
like rolling stones, neither getting moss themselves, nor raising any
building of piety, or sound knowledge in others; for the same small stock
always serves their turn, in their several gests and quarters: By this means
(they hope) the Church and State in a short time will be spoiled of all those
fair flowers of good Scholars and able constant Ministers, which were well
rooted in learning, and plentifully watered with the dew of heaven, (the gifts
and graces of Gods Spirit:) that so there may be room enough, for those rank
and ill weeds to spread all over this English garden and field: under whose
specious covert of spiritualty all sort of venomous Serpents and hurtful
beasts may be hidden, till they are so multiplied, (...). Naz.
that through mutual jealousies and dissensions, they fall to tearing and
devouring one another; for, however, like Serpents, wicked men may for a while
twine together, yet their different heads will soon find, wherewith to exercise
their stings and teeth against each other; Impious men's confederacies are not
friendship but faction and conspiracy. Nothing being more in consistent, than
ignorance, error, and impiety; which having no principles of union or order in
them, can have nothing of firmness or stability among them.

I doubt not, but there are, 12. The blessings which good Christians owe to
good Ministers, under God.
(notwithstanding so many bitter spirits, and rebellious children, have become
ungrateful Apostates, against this Church and ^its worthy Ministry) thousands
of excellent Christians, who have not bowed the knee to these Baali^s: who have
both cause and hearts to confess, that the feet of these messengers, the true
Ministers of England, have brought light and peace to their souls; That their
pious and constant labors have not been either so weak or unfruitful, as might
in any sor^ deserve, or justify such hard recompenses, as these now are, with
which a foolish and unthankefull generation seeks to requite the Lord, Deuteronomy.
32.6.
and his faithful servants, the true Ministers, whose names shall yet live
among good Christians, with durable honor; Eccles. 7.1.
and their memories shall be precious as sweet Ointments, when these dead (yet
busy) flies, who seek to corrupt them, Eccles. 10.1.
shall rot as dung on the face of the earth: Their unsavory stench is already
come up, and has greatly defiled many parts of this Church; being justly
offensive to all wise, and good men in the present age; and for the future they
will be memorable for nothing, but illiterate impudence, ungrateful malice,
and confused madness, who like beasts were able to waste a fair field, and
desolate a well reformed Church; but never to cultivate or plant any thing like
it.

The field of this Church in many places, by the blessed labors of true and
able husbandmen, was heretofore full of good corn; the valleys and hills did
laugh and sing; poor and rich were happy in the great increases, with which
the Lord of the harvest crowned the labors of his faithful Ministers; before
the enemy had such liberty to sow his tares, even at noon day; yea in many
places to rout the true laborers, to leave many places desolate, and only to
scatter that self-sowing corn, which is like to that which springs on the house
top, whereof the Mower shall never fill his hand, Psalm. 129.7.
nor he that binds up the sheaves his bosom; Who sees not, that one handful
of that crop, which was formerly wont to be tilled by the skillful and diligent
hand of true and able Ministers, was, for its weighty soundness in knowledge,
and modest fullness in humility, far more worth, than many sheaves and
cartloads of these burnt, and blasted ears; whose pride pretends in one night
to grow to such eminent gifts of the Spirit, for preaching, as shall exceed all
the parts and studies of Ministers; when it is evident to all, that will but rub
them in their hands, that these wild oats, and smutty ears, by lifting up their
heads so high, do but proclaim their emptiness and lightness.

And 'twere well, if they were only such cockle, such trash and light gear;
they now grow to sharp thistles, thorns mixed with true weed; which seeks to
starve, choke, and pull down to the earth, all the hopes and joy of the true
laborers; that rich crop of truth, order, piety, charity, and sincerity, which
was formerly in great plenty, and still is, in good measure, on the ground: Yea
thousands of Christians, in many places of this Nation, do already grievously
complain, of the sad and desolate estate, to which they are reduced for want of
able and true Ministers, Amos 8.11. Psalm. 106.15.
residing among them: crying out, that a famine of the Word is come upon them;
and leanness is entered into their souls: having none to sow the immortal
seed of the Word, or to dispense the bread of life to them, but a few straglers
now and then: of whose calling and authority to minister holy things, no wise
man has any confidence; and of whose insufficiency every way, all men have too
much experience, where ever they obtrude themselves: That most Christians had
rather (yea and better) want the Word and Sacraments, than receive them, so
defiled, so nullified, by such unwashen, and unwarranted hands. For it is
hardly to be believed, that those, who are so much enemies to the spirit of
Christ in true Ministers (of which there has been so great and good
demonstrations, in gifts, lives, and successes) should either have, or come in
the power of the same Spirit, which they so much despise, and blaspheme. Sure
the Kingdom of Christ is not divided against it self; but is uniform, and
constant; not depending on the various impulses of men's humors, fancies, and
worldly interests, but established and governed by the most sure Word, and
those holy rules, both for truth and order, therein contained: It is little
sign of Christ's Spirit in men, to sow those seeds of errors and divisions which
holy men have been always plucking up; or to build again that Babell, which so
many godly Ministers have pulled down. But it becomes us Ministers not so much
to dispute with these men about the Spirit, to which they so highly pretend; as
to continue to outdoe them in the fruits of the Spirit, as our famous and
blessed forefathers have done, and to leave the decision to the Consciences of
true, and wise Christians, and to the great Searcher of men's hearts, and tryer
of men's spirits and works; who has the Spirit of burning and refining; Isa.
4.4.
and who (if he has not determined for the superfluity of wickedness, and
ungrateful wontannesse of this Nation, to lay us quite wast and desolate) will
in his due time (after these days of trial) thoroughly purge his floor, and
weed his field; even this, Mal. 3.12.

must have patience, (but not slacken their diligence) after the holy example
of those godly Bishops, and Presbyters of the Church in the times of the
Arrian, Novatian, Donatistick, and others prevalencies and persecutions; The
fierce and fiery spirit in the old heretics and schismatics could least of
all endure with temper and moderation, those Bishops and Ministers which were
soundest in their judgments, faithfullest in their places, and holiest in
their lives; Socrat. l. 1. c. 7. l. cap. 17. Can. African. Theod. l. 4 c. 12.
So that, not only they destroyed and drove away most of the orthodox
Ministers, both Bishops and Presbyters, out of many Provinces in Africa, and so
in Asia, as in Europe; but they sought with all fraud and force to destroy,
that great Colosse of Christian Religion, the most renowned Bishop of
Alexandria, Omnes quos factionis macula s^ciavit in Athanasium conspirabant.

If the hand of Secular power will not maintain the ancient order of the true

crave and expect: Vbicunque a perditis mala ista commissa sunt, ibi ferventius,

we may encounter: And however the Rev. 12.4. Rev. 2.

Although this may be the hour of temptation, which must come upon this
Reformed Church, and the power of darkness, which may for a time have leave,
to deny, betray, set at naught, and crucify afresh the Lord of Glory, in his
true Ministers, and faithful servants; yet good men may be confident,* that
their bonds and scourges, their revilings, and cruel mockings, their being
sawn asunder (between ignorance and error, schism and heresy, profaneness and
hypocrisy, superstition and licentiousness;) The very indignities,
restraints, injuries, and ruins of the godly Ministers, shall tend to the

propagation, and more glorious restoration of the Reformed Religion; which of
later times has wanted, nothing so much, whereby to set forth its primitive
luster and power, as the constancy and patience of the Ministers and
Professors of it in the point of comely suffering for the Truth. In which way
the brightest beams of the Spirit of Glory are wont to appear: The base
cowardly avoiding of sufferings, has brought great reproaches upon many
Ministers and other Christians; who (Proteus-like) by mean compliances, and
palliations, suiting themselves to a disorderly and variating world, have much
eclipsed and deformed the beauty and dignity of their holy Function, and
Profession, both as Ministers, and as Christians.

As it is far harder to suffer persecution, and to bear the burning coals of
men's displeasure in our bosoms, than to make long prayers, or to preach soft
and smooth Sermons; and to bandy safe disputes in the Sun shine of Peace,
plenty, favor and prosperity: so more glory will then redound to God, and more
honor to the Reformed Religion, from those sparkling rays and effusions, of
grace, P o^um virtutes ut Aroma^^, qu^ magis c^nteruntur, eo frangratius

which shall flow from excellent Ministers, when they are red hot in the forge
of affliction, and hammered on the Anvile of the worlds malice, than ever did
from those faint and weaker beams, by which they shined in the easy and
ordinary formalities of Religion; Nor will any thing more assure them, and the
uncharitable world, that they have the Spirit of Christ in them of a Truth,
than when they shall find they have holy and humble resolutions, to suffer with
Christ, and his Church, rather than to reign with a wicked and irregular world;
whose Jesuitick joys will then be fulfilled, and crowned with garlands, when
they shall see the learning, piety, order, government, and honor of that
Ministry, (which sometime flourished to the great regret of all its enemies, in
this reformed Church) utterly prostrated, vilified, impoverished and expulsed.

On the other side the spiritual joys of true and faithful Ministers, will
be increased by their being beaten, and evil entreated, and cast out of their
Synagogues; by their being reproached, scorned, and wounded unjustly; not only
from their professed enemies of the Romish party; but even from those who were
of their own household; who seemed to be their familiar friends: It is happier
to have the least measure of Christ's Spirit in patience, truth, and power; than
to make the greatest boasts, and to enjoy the loudest vulgar applauses, which
those Chenaniahs seem to affect and aim at; 1 King. 22.
who dare now to smite every where the true Prophets, the plain dealing
Micaiahs, on the mouth; designing to feed all the true, able and faithful
Ministers with the bread and water of affliction, because they will not comply
with, or yield to that novel, lying, proud and disorderly spirit, with which
their hearts and mouths are so filled with malice not only against the
Ministry, but against the prosperity of this and all other reformed Churches:
which folly or fury they would have styled and esteemed to be in them, the
special gifts and inspirations of the Spirit of God.

They were forward to crucify Christ, who were shy of being defiled by entering
into the Judgment Hall: They are most zealous to destroy the true Ministers,

increased in spiritual endowments, thinking they need nothing of Christ's true
Ministry, Revel. 3.17.
when they know not that they are poor, and naked, and blind, and miserable.
Ephesians. 6.12.
There are ((...)) spiritual wickednesses usurpant in the high places of men's
souls, as well as ((...)) more sordid and swinish spirits, that dwell in the
lower region of men's lusts; It is expressly stigmatized on the foreheads of some
pretenders to the Spirit, Jude 19.
(which was the glory of those first and purest times) that they are sensual
not having the Spirit: Irenaeus: l. 3. c. 1. of the Gnasticks, and
Valentinians. Gloriantur se ^mendatores esse Apostolorum: perfectam
cognitionmen non habuisse Apostolos. cap. 2. Dicunt se non tantum Presbyteris
sed and Apostolis sapientiores, sinceram invenisse veritatem: So the
Circumcelliones, Quae non viderunt confingunt; opiniones su^s habentes pro Deo:
honores quos non habuerunt se habuisse protestantur. Isid. Hisp. de off. Eccl.
l. 3. c. 15.
Vain and proud ignorance (as we see in primitive times) is not only content
to be without the true, wise, humble and orderly Spirit of God, but they must
also study to cover their follies, disorders, and hypocrisies with the shows of
it: as if it were not enough to sin against its manifest rules and examples in
the Word; which have always been observed in the Church; unless they impute
also to it, their simplicities, fondnesses, impudencies, filthy dreams,
extravagancies, and confusions: Counting it no shame to ascribe those
unreasonable and absurd motions, speeches and actions, to Gods most wise and
holy Spirit; which any man of right reason and sober sense, or common ingenuity
and modesty, would be ashamed to own.

Our humble prayer is, that these new modellers, and pretenders to the Spirit
may learn not to blaspheme; not to grieve, resist, and do despite to the
Spirit of God; which has been, and still is evidently manifest in the true
Ministers of this Church; and our earnest study shall be, that we may be truly
endued with such gifts, graces, and fruits of the Spirit of Christ, that we may
both speak, and do, and suffer, as becomes good Christians, and true
Ministers, after the example of holy men, and of our great Master, Bishop and
Ordainer, Jesus Christ: That so the judicious Charity of those, that excel in
virtue, wisdom, faith, and humility, may have cause to say the Lord has sent
us in the power, as well as in the order and office of the Ministry, to which
we were rightly ordained: On the other side we fear, that the great earthquakes
in the Church and darkness over the Reformed Religion, (which may follow the
true Ministers being set at naught and crucified, by the malice and wantonness
of men) may in after times, give too much cause to those, Mat. 27.54.
that now neglect us, or afflict us, to say, as the Centurion did of Christ,
Doubtless these were the messengers of the most high God; the true Ministers
of Jesus Christ, and of his Gospel to this Church.

While we have any liberty and leave to live as Ministers, it will become us,
not to be so discouraged by the impotent malice of any enemies, as to desert
this holy calling, whereto the Lord by a right ordination in this Church has
duly called us; Not to look back to the world having once put our hands to this
plough; to consider our persecutors no further than to pity them, and pray for
them: notwithstanding all the injuries, and blasphemies, not against us so
much, as against God; while they fear not to ascribe the great and good
effects, which the Lord has vouchsafed to work by his Ministers upon the
hearts of thousands in England, to Beelzebub, Mat. 12.24.
to the spirit of Antichrist; or to any thing rather than to own the Spirit of
Christ among us, which he has promised should ever be with his true and
faithful Ministers, in an holy succession of authority, and power, to the end
of the world.

Scandalous inconstancy of Professors.
Indeed the greatest grief to the Souls of all godly Ministers; and which has
brought the greatest scandal and dehonestation on their Ministry, (next to
some of their own gross failings) is this; when the world sees so many of
those, who seemed to be baptized with water, and with the Spirit; to have been
illuminated, and sanctified by their teaching; to have tasted of the heavenly
gift, Heb. 6.5.
and the powers of the world to come (that is, of the authority and efficacy of
the Evangelicall Ministry, which was to come after the Leviticall and
Aaronicall order) Many who seemed to have rejoiced for many years, in those
burning and shining lights of this Churches Ministers; to have (by their
Ministry) been well instructed, reformed, washed, and escaped from the
pollutions of this world, That (I say) some of these like Jesuru^, should thus
lift up the heel, and thus kick against the Ministers and Ministry; like
Demasses, thus to forsake them; like Judasses thus to betray them, whom lately
they kissed and followed as Disciples; like Swine that they should thus turn
and revile those, that cast pearl before them; returning to the wallowing in
the mire and dirt of unjust, covetous, ambitious, erroneous, seditious,
licentious, perjurious, malicious, and sacrilegious courses; No more now
ashamed of their lusts, then those unclean beasts are of their filthiness in
the midst of the fairest Sunshine day; and when they are nearest to the most
pure and Crystal streams; But the light which they will not see in this their
day shining on them, and discovering the frauds and evil of their ways, they
may after see in that darkness, to which they are hastening, and to which they
seem even of God to be condemned.

But to conclude my answer in this particular, 15. Conclusion and resignation
of our Ministry, if, etc.
wherein the Antiministeriall adversaries pretend to such spiritual gifts and
special calling, beyond the ordained and settled Ministry; if any excellent
Christians, or any of those, that have either wisdom to discern, or power to
dispose of things, to the advantage of this Church and State; if they do in
their judgments conceive, or in their upright consciences, laying aside all
partialities, and obliquings to worldly interest, but merely regarding the
glory of God, the good of souls, and the honor of the reformed Religion, if
they shall conclude that there is indeed more evidence, and power of Gods
Spirit both in gifts Ministerial, and in holy successes, in those men that
style themselves inspired men, special Prophets, and new modelled Preachers:
if they be found to have more of godly learning, of sound wisdom, in the
mysteries of Christ, of sincere piety, zeal and charity to the glory of God and
men's souls good; if they are filled with divine endowments, for praying,
preaching, duly exhibiting the holy Mysteries, for edifying the Church, for
maintaining the truth of the reformed Religion, and the peace of this Church
and Nation; if they have greater courage, constancy, industry, and conscience
to carry on the great work of saving souls; if they have more authority, from
the word of Christ, from the Apostles practice, from the Catholic precedents
of the Church of Christ, in all ages and places; by which to clear their call,
to the work of the Ministry, beyond what is produced for the ancient, and
ordained Ministry of this Church; Truly we do not desire to be further
injurious or hindrances to any men's souls: God forbid the Ministers of the
Church of England should be so much lovers or valuers of themselves, or envious
to other men's excellencies, or enemies to your and the Churches welfare, as not
to be willing to be laid aside, that these new men's more immediate and greater
sufficiencies, higher inspirations, and diviner authority, may do that work,
to which we are found so unsufficient, defective and unworthy.

But if these pretenders to more spiritual prophesying, preaching and living,
be by wise and godly men (who love not to mock God, or dally with matters of
salvation and eternity, (which is the end of Religion) weighed in the balance
of the sanctuary; of the divine institution; of Christ's mission; of the
Apostles succession; of the primitive custom; and of the Catholic order in
all ages and Churches; if the grounds of right reason, of good order, policy
and government be duly considered, which require distinction in all societies,
sacred and civil, and avoid confusion (most) in the things of God; if the
judgment of the most learned, useful, and holy men in all ages be pondered;
if these new men's Spirits and gifts be thoroughly tried by the touchstone of
Gods Word; if their secular aims and warpings to the world be narrowly looked
into; if the deformity of their words and works be considered; if their simple
or scandalous writings be duly examined; if the successes of their endeavors,
and essays hitherto in many places, be seriously thought of, (which are
evidently proved to be very sad and bad: little promoting either truth or
peace; holiness or comfort to any peoples souls; nor any prosperity and
advancement to this Church, or any Christian reformed Religion;) if they be
found in ignorance and weakness, or in factiousnesse and insolences, or in
pride and avarice, or in erroneousnesse, and licentiousness, so far too
light, that they are not so much, as the dust of the balance, compared to the
real excellencies of those true Ministers of this Church, which have been, and
still are, and may be in this Church, (if men be not all given over to lusts
and strong delusions) God forbid any excellent Christians should be tempted by
fear, or flattery, or any fallacy of novelty, gain or liberty, to desire or
endeavor, or approve a change; which will be so shamefully and desperately
pernicious both to themselves, and to their posterity.

and secular learning in Ministers.
who would fain impose upon the credulous world, with the pretentions of some
special gifts and Inspirations of Gods Spirit (which are as yet no way
discovered by them, in word or deed, as I have showed) being conscious to
themselves, that indeed they come short of those common endowments, by which
the minds of men, are often much improved, through study and good learning: they
seek to oppose and decry that in all Christians, and especially in Ministers,
which they despair of themselves: So that not a dumb spirit, but a silly,
prating, and illiterate one possesses them; which cries out against all humane
learning, and useful Studies, as the devils did against Christ; What have we
to do with thee? Matthew. 8.29.
Great calumnies and contempts are raised by these men, and their Disciples
against all liberal Arts and Sciences, all skill in the tongues and histories;
against all Books but the Bible, (and some of them can hardly dispense with
that too, since they take all books to be of the same nature with those
conjuring Books which were burnt, Act. 19.19.) against the Schools of the
Prophets, and all Universities, as heathenish, Antichristian, marks of the
Beast; as deformities, darknings, and impertinencies, where we have Scripture
light; Also prejudicial to that more immediate divine teaching or Institution
to which they pretend, and by which they say, they learn, and teach all true
Religion; which they tell us is so sufficiently furnished, and fortified, as
the new Jerusalem, with its own walls, Revel. 21.
made of precious stones, (the impregnable strength of truth, and the splendor
of the Spirits gifts) that it needs none of these mudwalls and bulwarks of
earth, which men have cast up; Beautified enough with its own native innocence
and glory, it desires not any of these rags, and additionall tatters of humane
learning; which (they say) has so tossed and torn Religion with infinite, and
intricate disputes, that the solidnesse and simplicity of true Divinity is
almost quite lost, and confounded. Christ is almost oppressed by the crowds,
and throngs of such as are called Rabbis and learned men: who may well spare
their pains in the Church of Christ; Isai. 54.13. Ioh. 14.26. Ioh. 16.13.
where the Lord has promised that all shall be taught of God, that his Spirit
shall teach them all things, and lead them into all truth.

that so their sparks might appear, which they have kindled to themselves, in
their shining corners, and upon their private hearths.

Truly this calumny against good learning, has as much surprised me and my
brethren the Ministers of this Church, as the accusation of Fimbria did
question Scaevola; Quaerentibus quid^in Scaevola sam vulnerato ess^t

who was impleaded by the other, for not receiving that poynard deeper into his
breast, wherewith he stabbed him, and intended to have dispatched him; The
learned, and godly Ministers in England, never thought this would be laid to
their charge, as a fault, the want of which had been a foul shame, and a just
reproach to them: As the enjoyment of it was a great honor and advantage, both
to them and to the Reformed Religion; They little suspected, that among
Christians, Apollos should be forced to excuse his eloquent and potent
demonstrations; or S. Paul his sober and sanctified learning, in which he
excelled, worthy of that famous City and University Tarsus, of which he had the
honor to be free, and pleaded it as a privilege, Act. 21.39. Which learning
made him not so mad, as those were who suspected, and accused him, that much
learning had made him mad. And if humane learning be such old clouts and rotten
rags, as these men of most beggarly elements pretend, (and we confess it is
so, compared to, and destitute of, those soul-saving Truths, which are divinely
revealed) yet there may be good use of them; Ier. 38.11.
if it be but to help the Jeremies, (the Prophets and Ministers of the Lord)
out of those dungeons and mire, where otherwise their enemies would have them
ever to be lodged, both sordidly, and shamefully, and obscurely.

Nothing (O you excellent Christians) is less necessary, than to paint this
Sun, or polish this pearl, to set forth to you the use and necessity of good
learning: (...). Just. in d^cu^ Tryph.
of the benefit and blessing whereof in this Church your selves are so much
partakers, and whereof you are so great esteemers, and encouragers; And nothing
shows good learning more necessary to the Church and true Religion, both as
Christian and reformed, than this; That the Devil by vain and fallacious
instruments often has, and still seeks to deprive them of that weapon, and
defense, which he has used with great strength, and cunning, for his chiefest
arms; both offensive against the truths of religion; and defensive for his own
most damnable doctrines and delusions. What havoc would he soon make of sound
doctrine, Cres^onius the heretic often complained that Saint. Austin was too
full of his Logic and Syllogisms, when he could not answer his reasons. In the
Emperor Charles 5. time: 1524.
as in former ages he endeavored, by those learned, and subtle Sophisters, his
instruments, and emissaries on every side, if there were none on the Truths
side able to encounter him, and his agitators in that post of learning! No
wonder if the Woolf would have the Flock without Mastives, or these without
teeth: it were much for his, little for the flocks ease and advantage. Although
the Devil (an old accuser) must needs be a cunning Orator too, and be furnished
with all the swasive arts of insinuation, which he fits to the several
geniusses of men and times; yet he never till of late in Germany, and now in
England had confidence to make use of this place of Oratory, to persuade
Christians to burn all other Books, that they might better study and
understand the Bible; yea and the Bible too, that they might better understand
the mind of God: Which is all one, as if the Israelites should have been
persuaded to have rid themselves of the cumber of their swords, spears, and
shields, that so they might better defend themselves; or that they should have
neither file nor grindstone to sharpen the natural bluntness, 1 Samuel 13.
or clear the rustinesse of their weapons; while yet the Philistims were all
well armed, and daily preparing to battle; Against whom there was no such
warrant of a special divine protection, as to make the people of God presume,
to neglect the use of those arms which art had prepared, and use had taught,
how to imply. We see that Jonathans heroic motion carries him not upon that
successful and great adventure, without his sword and armor-bearer. 1 Samuel
14.13.
Nor did David's confidence in Gods protection, of which he had former
experiences, when he was without any arms, against the Lion and Bears; nor yet
the assurance he had, 1 Samuel 17.
of the goodness of his cause; or of the pride and profaneness of his enemy;
none of these made him neglect to take, and use such arms, 2 Samuel 5.6. 2 Pet.
3.
as he thought most convenient. The blind and the lame (men of feeble and
confused spirits; unlearned and unstable minds) which are hated of David's
soul, are ill assistants in David's wars, against the Jebusites, who study to
defend against him, or to surprise from him the City of David, or rather the
City of God; which is the Metropolis where grace and truth do dwell.

It is certain, that next to the primitive gifts of miracles, 2. Humane
learning succeeded miraculous and extraordinary gifts.
the gifts of humane learning have stood the Church of Christ in most stead.
For ever since the Apostles and Ministers of Christ, assisted with
extraordinary endowments of the Spirit, had by the foolishness of preaching,
(as by David's improbable weapons against Goliahs complete armature) vanquished
that old Idolatrous power Nec miracula^ illa in nostra tempora durare permissa

of heathenisme, which prevailed in the world; and was long upheld by shows of
learning, eloquence, and (in that way) vain philosophy; The Church of Christ
has, ever since the cessation of those Miraculous gifts, (which attended only
the first conquests) made use of that very sword of that prostrated Giant; good
learning; both to dispatch him, and to defend it self; finding that both in
humane and divine encounters, there is none like to that, if managed by a
proportionate arm and strength.

For, hereby the mind, and all intellectual faculties of men's souls (which are
the noblest and divinest) are more easily and fully instructed; more speedily

up. The inscription on Christ's cross is in three languages, Hebrew, Greek and
Latin, Luke 23.38. Intimating as the divulging of the Gospel to many tongues
and Nations; so that the mystery of Christ crucified is not to be fully and
exquisitely understood, without the keys of these three learned and principal
languages; with which the Church has flourished. Certainly it is not easy for
unlearned men to consider how great use there is even of Grammar, which is the
first and roughest file that good learning applies to polish the mind with
all; for much of the true sense even of the holy Scriptures, as well as of
other Records, depends upon the true writing or Orthography, the exact
derivation or etymology, and the regular Syntaxis or conjoining of words: yea
that Critical part of literature, which is the finest file or searse of Truth
(wherein some men's wit and curiosity only vapor, and soar high, like birds of
large feathers, and small bodies) yet it is of excellent use, when by men of
sober learning it is applied to the service of religion; Many times much
Divinity depends on small particles, rightly understood, upon one letter; upon
such a mood, or tense, or case, and the like; many errors are engendered and
nourished by false translations, and mistakes of words or letters; many truths
are restored and established, by the true meaning of them, asserted upon good
grounds, and just observations; which has been done with great accuratenesse,

originalls of the Word of God, so as thereby to attain their genuine and
emphatick sense: also for the clearing of many passages and allusions which are
in the Scriptures: referring to things natural and historical, in the
manners, and customs of the nations. This once done, Logic disposes. Qui
logica carent materias lacerant, ut catuli panes. Melan. (...). Cl. Al. (...).

all Truths are by the methods and reasoning of Logic easily disintangled, and
fairly vindicated from the snarlings, sophisms, and fallacies, with which
error, ignorance or calumniating malice seek to obscure or disguise them, or
therein to wrap up and cover themselves; darkening wisdom by words without
understanding. After this they are by the same art handsomely distributed, and
methodically wound up in several clews and bottomes according to those various
Truths which that excellent art has spun out; That thus digested, they may
again be brought forth unfolded and presented to others in that order and
beauty of eloquence which Rhetoric communicates to others. (...). Naz. or. 23.
Rhetoric teaches: By which truths have both an edge and luster set on them,
do most adorn them, and enforce to the quickest prevalencies on men's minds,
and the firmest impressions on their passions and affections; that so their
rational vigor may hold out to men's actions; and extend to the ethics or
morality of civil conversation, which is the politure of men's hearts and
hands; The softner and sweetner of violent passions, and rougher manners, to
the candor and equity of polity and society: This civility was, and is the
preface and forerunner of Religion, the great preparative to piety, the
confines of Christianity, which never thrives until barbarity be rooted up,
and some learning with morality be sown and planted among men. Nor did
Christian Religion ever extend its pavilion much further, than the tents of
Learning and Civility had been pitched by the conquests and colonies of the
Greeks and Romans.

Thus by this golden circle, and crystal medium of true learning, the short,
dim, and weaker sight of our reason, Matthew. 6.23.
(whose very light is become dark by sin, bleared with its own fancies, and
almost put out by its grosser lusts and passions) may (as by the help of
perspective or optic glasses) be mightily strengthened and extended, while it
sees, History. (...). Cl. Al. (...). 1. (...). Id.
as with the united vigor of the many thousand visuall rays and eyes of those,
who saw before us; That so those few conjectures, those dark and ambiguous
experiences, which any man's short sight and single life can afford him, may be
ampliated, cleared, and confirmed by those many testimonies and historical
monuments, which others have left in their learned writings: which draw as it
were, the lesser rivulets of various observations, from several times, pens
and places, to meet in one great and noble current of true Religion, which is
the wisest observer and devoutest admirer of what true learning most sets
forth; the providence, justice, power, goodness, patience, and mercy of the
wise, great, and holy God: the Creator, ruler, and preserver of all things,
Psalm. 8.
but chiefly the regarder of the sons of men.

God has therefore blessed his Church with good learning, that those small
stocks, and portions of wisdom, which any man's private patrimony affords him,
either by innate parts, or acquired experiments, (which, for the most part,
would amount to no more, than the furnishing of a portable pedlers pack, with
small wares, toys, and trinckets; fit to please children, idiots, and country
people) may be improved by a joint stock, Humanus s nsus cum sarcitur alieno
invento c^to attenuatur de prop^io. Cassiod.
and united commerce of prudent observations; that so men might drive a great
and public trade of wisdom, to the infinite enriching, and adorning both of
Church and State, both of Polity and Religion: These two being the great
luminaries and excellencies of humane Nature; the one to rule the day wherein
we stand related to God, in piety; the other to rule the night, wherein we are
related to each other, by humanity, equity, charity, and bonds of civil
society. Which innate virtues and properties of man's nature ( Reason, and
Religion) once neglected, and until'd, for want of that culture, which good
learning, and that sof ening, Barbarity succeeds the want of learning, as
darkness, the Suns absence.
which ingenuous education brings to the mind and manners of men; who sees not,
by miserable experience, how mankind runs out to weeds? whole nations
degenerate to brutish barbarity: as among the Tartars, Negroes, and Indians?

Yea even among people, where some are civilized by literature and the
profession of Christian religion, we find, by daily experience, that the
unlearned sort are either gross, dull, and very indocible; St^lide feroces.

or else they are rough, impolished and insolent, prone to a rustic impudence,
and clownish untractablenesse; especially when they imagine they have (or dare
arrogate to themselves) a power and liberty of speaking, and doing what they
list; Nothing is sacred, nothing is civil among those, that carry all by
ignorant confidence and brutish strength; Scientia non habet ^^micum p^aeter
ignorantem.
we see in those of the Antiministeriall faction, that by want of learning
(whereof they are generally guilty) men only learn this Indian or Turkish
quality, to hate, contemn and seek to destroy all good learning, which is
nothing else, but the good husbandry and great improvement of the reasonable
soul in it self to God and to others: Therefore the ambition of these
Ignoramusses, 2 Timothy 3.8.
is like the magic cunning of Jannes and Jambres; chiefly vented, and
exercised, by a most impotent pride, and malice, in despising, and resisting
those Mosesses, the true Ministers of the Church: the planters, preservers,
reformers, and vindicators and deliverers (under God) of true Religion, who
have been, and are, (many of them) eminently learned: most of them,
competently; so as at least to make a fair and ingenuous use of other men's more
accurate and solid labors, who are their ((...)) brethren of the same holy
function and Ministry; who have generally been in all ages and places, the
magazines, or storehouses of all good learning; which I may affirm without any
envy, or diminution, to those many excellent Gentlemen of this or other
Nations, who have added to the honor of their birth, and other accomplishments
of breeding, this most eminent crown and beauty of all, Good learning.

It is a work then fit for Lucifer, 3. To cry down good learning is only fit
for Luciferians.
(so to contradict his name by his deeds) to pretend light, and intend
darkness; to cry up the spirit, which is easily done; that he may cry down
learning, which is hardlyer attained, than the other is said: Who can wonder,
if the Philistines would fain put out the eyes of our Samsons, (having once
bound, and hampered them with poor and straightned conditions) that so they may
less fear their strength, Judge. 16.21.
and safely mock them, and their reformed Religion: which never so thrived
(after miraculous gifts were ceased) as when the forces and glory of the
Gentiles came in to Christ; Isa. 60.11.
Rev. 21.26. Vid. Clem. Al. (...). 6. Vult (...).
when Christianity was graffed on the old stock of heathen learning and
philosophy; which now brings forth fruit, not after the old crabbed sowrnesse,
but after the sweetness of the new Olive-cion, with which it is headed; yea we
see, when Christian Religion ran out to much barbarity, illiterate ignorance,
and superstition, for many centuries, till the last, (for want of the culture,
and manuring of learning) it brought forth little fair fruits; but much of
Legendary fables, lying wonders, religious Romances, stories of Chivalry in
holy wars and E^ra^tries in Religion: The best effects were the Schoolemen^
cloistered curiosities and intricate disputes; who rather hewed and cut the
pillars of Christian Religion, into small chips and shavings; than added much
to the polishing and establishing of them; so intangling Philosophy with
Divinity, as confounded both, much advanced neither; all excellent things,
worthy to be known, being wrapped up in obscurity; or set forth in such
barbarous and fulsome Latin, that they were like fair Irish bodies in course,
and ragged mantles; And this, for want of that method and texture of learning,
which might so card and fever each matter from other, as might give both beauty
and distinctnesse to them.

Which we see has been done this last hundred years and more; The advantages
to religion by learning.
in which so many men of admirable learning and industry have by the help of
printing (with which the world is now rather surfeited than nourished) brought
forth to their beauty, by an happy regeneration, so many of the ancient
writers, both Christian and heathen; (which were formerly buried in obscure
cloisters, and useless retirements, as in their graves; eaten with worms and
covered with dust.) So that no Sanhedrin of the Jews; no Senate at Athens, or
Rome; no Synod, or Council of Christians were ever so, at once, completed and
furnished with excellent men in all kinds, as our Christian Libraries now every
where are; In which there are attending on Christian Religion (which is as the
Kings daughter, Psalm. 45.23.
all glorious within) those virgins, which be not her fellows so much, as her
handmaids: who clothe her with garments, wrought with needle work in diverse
colors; embroydered with the sublimity and gravity of Plato; with the method
and acuteness of Aristotle; Of Plutarch it is said: if all Authors were lost,
he alone might supply.
with the morals and suavity of Seneca and Plutarch (who alone is a Library;)
with the eloquence and oratory of Demosthenes, Tully, and Quintilian; with the
florid language, and sober sense of Xenophon, Caesar, Livy, Tacitus, and other
excellent historians; with the various observations of the most learned Varro
(whose life was spared in civil dissensions for his incomparable learning:
Vivat Varro doctissi^us Romanorum.
) so of Pliny, Ptolemy, and other searchers into all curiosities of Nature and
Art: Besides these, the very goats hair, Exodus 37.7.
and badger skins too, are made to serve the Tabernacle of the Lord; the
elegancies of Homer, Virgil, and other Poets; (who are magazines of fancy, Of
Virgil it is said, if all Sciences were lost they might be found in him.
and masters of wit) are useful: which way of expressing truth and religion in
pathetick and poetic ways of devotion the Spirit of God abhors not, as we
see in some holy Poets who were writers of some part of the Scripture, as in
Job, Psalms, Canticles, Lamentations, and other places: where piety and
poetry, truth and elegancy, Divinity and sacred curiosity, (in meete^s and
Acrostichs) meet together: Teaching us, That God, who is full of infinite
varieties, and yet but one perfect simplicity, is to be seen, served, and
praised, in his several gifts, to any of which Christian Religion (which is of
all religions the most absolute, perfect and comprehensive) can have no
abhorrency; Grata de Deo fama in artibus sparsa.
since they all flow from God, and return to him, through any wise and gracious
heart; which as a limbeck or hot still, extracts somewhat spiritual out of
every thing, of nature, art, experience, or history.

From these well stored quivers of humane learning in all kinds, Christian
Religion has so furnished her self with excellent, and sharp arrows of all
sorts; that she easily makes ready her bow, and shoots against the face of any
adversaries that dare provoke her; either in Languages, Arts, or Sciences; In
Logic, Rhetoric, History Antiquity; in Philosophy, natural, moral, or
political; In all which, by much converting with, and contemplation of, those
ancient goodly pieces, the Church of Christ has, Gen 30.39.
(as Jacobs sheep did by looking upon the variegated rods) brought forth
answerable parallels of incomparable learning, in all kinds; So that Pharaohs
daughter, matched thus to Solomon, Psalm. 45.10.
(the learning of the heathens joined to Christian Religion) may very well
forget her fathers house; in stead of which (since the King of the Church has
delighted in her beauty) she has brought forth children, which she may make
Princes in all the Provinces of good learning; which are become tributary to
Christ, Psalm. 45.6.
and subject to his Kingdom of righteousness and Scepter of truth.

But O how different, 4. Devils devises against Religion and Learning.
many faced and cross grained are the Devils engines, methods and temptations!
His first was to persuade by the speciousnesse of increased and diviner
wisdom, Genesis 3.5.
to eat of that forbidden fruit which the tree of knowledge of good and evil
did bear; This was a pleasant bait, but pernicious; a golden, but poisonous and
deadly arrow; Now the duller devil out of his almost exhausted quiver,
produces this iron headed, blunt, and rusty shaft; tempting Christians to
abandon all good literature, and humane means of attaining knowledge both
Divine and humane: And since he sped so well by this first temptation of proud
curiosity, to be like to Gods, in eating what was forbidden; he despaires not
to make us now like beasts; by persuading us to abstain from that tree of
knowledge, which the Lord allows us; and which his providence has caused to
flourish in the garden of his Church; and which does not only bear fair and
excellent fruits, which are desirable to make one wise to salvation, Revel.
22.2.
but the very leaves of good learning, are for the healing of the Nations: Many
defects are thereby supplied in humane societies; many immoralities restrained;
many diseases cured, as to the outward contagion, and covered as to the
deformity; to all which, the nature of man is other ways subject, and so
exposed, Quod vomeres, rastra, ^ratra gleba, hoc disciplinae sunt anima. Varro.
that we see in all ages, the barbarity of any people, either at first, or in
the relapse, is chiefly imputable to the want of good literature; and that
civility, which is as the flower and cream, always rising from learning; which
only supples the roughness, and brawny callousnesse, which grows by long
serity and rudeness on men's minds and manners; Learning, like the warmer
beams of the approaching Sun, only has force to ^haw, and melt that frozen
rigor of men's natures; to adorn them with a sweet and florid beauty; Animi
cultus est quidam humanitatis cibus. Tul. de fin. l. ^.
to enrich them to a summers fertility: which without this, are ever squallid,
and oppressed with a winters form, and horrid barrenness, ever accompanying
mankind in the absence and destitution of learning: which mightily prepares
men's hearts and minds for the seed of the Gospel, and for the harvest of true
religion, which affords the best fruits of wisdom and tranquillity to the
souls of men.

There is no doubt but Satan has found himself, for these last hundred and
fifty years, (since the happy restoration of learning first, and then of
Religion) much chained, hampered, and galled by those excellent gifts of all
sorts of good learning (which are as the string to the bow, and as feathers to
the arrows of Truth) wherewith God has mightily fenced and adorned his
Church, as he did in the 3, 4, 5, and 6 Centuries, after that miraculous gifts
were quite ceased, or much abated; in which times the Lord stirred up mighty
men of incomparable learning, to fight the battles of the Lord, of his Truth
of his Church, against heathenish and heretical adversaries. Drive away good
learning out of any Church and Nation by famine, starving it: or by military
insolency, banishing it; the devil (no doubt) would be much more at his ease
and liberty, as among Indians in barbarous idolatry; or Turks in ridiculous
Mahometry; or among the sillier sort of Papists in saplesse superstitions; or
among the wilder generation of Enthusiasts in their various fancies and most
incongruous dreams; all which grossly err, and covet to infect others through
ignorance even in the matters of right Reason as well as Religion; and are
destroyed for want of sound and sober knowledge; Hos. 4.6.
which is scarce attainable even in Religion (without a miracle) where either
people despise, or Teachers are void of that assistance, which good learning
affords.

Which however thousands of good Christians, both men and women, have not had
in the mass and bulk, yet they have enjoyed the spirits virtue and benefit of
it (as it were more abstract and refined) by the studies, labors,
instructions, and persuasions, which their learned Ministers have so prepared
for them, and fitly derived to them; as they did in England both by preaching
and by writing. The Devil would have less trouble to watch Christians in the
Church, lest they should fly from his camp to Gods tents, if he could persuade
them to put out their own eyes, and the eyes of their guides and Pastors too:
or else, to shut up themselves into some blind corners; and confine the
Christian reformed Religion to obscure ^els, and ^^lly conventicles; where, in
stead of the Suns fair light of Sua^eo ne vescentium dentibus edentulus
invideat; nec oculos caprearum talpae conte^mat. Hieron. ad Magnum, de indictis
Christanis.
true Reason, good Learning, and sound Religion; men should like Owls and Bats,
and Mouls, only howl, and chatter, and scratch one another in the dark. We
know there are such kind of animals, which are ready to curse the day: and
cannot abide the light, because their eyes are weak, their works are dark, and
both minds and manners are deformed.

The despisers of good learning are not only spiteful enemies to the
Christian reformed Religion (whose perfection disdaineth not to use those good
gifts, which come from the Iam 1.17.
Father of lights, 5. Despisers of learning are enemies to reason.

whose divine excellency, Reason, no man above the degree of brutish
stupidity, Bedlam madness, or divellish envy, ever sought to deprave, or
depresse: No doubt such apes knowing their own uncomely want of tails, would
be glad, if they could bring it in fashion, for all beasts to have none: and
persuade them to cut off, (as burdens, and deformities) those postern
ornaments and helms of the body, wherewith nature has furnished the nobler,
comelyer, and stronger creatures: But this mutilating of reason and deforming
of Religion, by putting out the eyes, and cropping off the ears of Christians,
and setting humanity it self into the stocks or pillory, is a greater
undertaking (I think and hope) than ever such feeble, though nimble animals,
with all their apish tricks, and mimicall grimasses, will be able to persuade,
either all, or any beasts of the Forests, (unless it be the silly asses) to
gratify them withal.

has withheld no good thing from his Church and people; and not only allows,
but requires us Christians, devoutly to consecrate all to his glory; so as
thankfully to adorn, even his Tabernacle, and Temple, with those spoils and
tributes, which we have taken from the Egyptians, and nations round about us:
as Moses, David, and Solomon did; all three eminent for learning and piety:

The learning of the heathen is now become a circumcised Proselyte to the
Christian Religion; from a captive alien, it is with shaved hair, and pared
nails, (the pomp and peevishness of it being laid aside) admitted with Hagar
into the holy family of the Church; as a pregnant handmaid to wait on Religion;
though not as a rival to be courted, and esteemed equal with Sarah. The
several parts of good learning, the Arts, and Sciences are, as those Cant.

However it be true, That the wisdom of the world is folly, and all learning is
barbarity, loss, and dung compared to, and separated from the excellency of
the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ; yet nothing hinders, but that Christian
Ministers may now (as Christ sometime did) ride upon this Asses colt to
Jerusalem; Nothing is more comely than to see the wisest men offer their gold
and frankincense and myrrh to Christ in his infancy: Mat. 3. We know, that, as
an humble unbeleeever cannot justly be counted either ignorant, or unlearned,
if he be taught in all saving necessary truths; and Sine Christo sophia ipsa

so, no man, never so much improved in secular knowledge, merits the name of
learned, if he be ignorant of the mind of God in the mysteries of Jesus
Christ; yet, judicious believers, can never be unthankful despisers of those
gifts of Sic adhibeantur scientiae seculares tanquam machinae quaedam, per quas
structura charitatis assurgat, quae mancat in aeternum. Aust. Ep. 119, (...).
Cl. Al.
good learning, in their Teachers, and Ministers, by whom they have received
that benefit of instruction in true Religion; which, by their own private
industry, and simplicity, they could hardly, if ever, have attained: Although
the Mine of Scripture be rich; yet unlearned men (as the most part of
Christians are, in point of humane literature) cannot search it; nor work it;
nor try, and refine it; unless they have the help of those, who have tools
and instruments, and vessels, and skill, fit for so rich and holy, yet hard and
serious a work; wherein it is much easier for weak and 2 Pet. 3.
unstable minds to fall into dark pits, and damnable errors; than of
themselves, to attain and bring forth those saving truths, which only can
enrich the soul. Although the gifts of humane learning be not personally given
to every Christian, yet they are so far necessary for all, as they are given to
serve for the benefit of all; as every one in the flock enjoyes the blessings
of those pastoral gifts and abilities, which are in the Shepherd; and every
member of the body that light, which is in the eye for the use of all.

6. Learned defenders of Christian Religion necessary.
There needs not much learning to make a man in love with it, and covetous of
more; It is a certain sign of very little, or none at all, where any man
despises, or decryeth it in others. It never indeed, received opposition, but
either by the Gothic barbarity of soldiers and oppressions of war: or by the
finer spun malice of such, as Sozomen l 5. ^ap. 5. Julian in his Persick
expedition wrote 7 books against Christ and Christian Religion. Jeron. Epi. ad

well, how great advantages learning afforded to the Christian religion, which
he sometime professed; and afterward with most cunning cruelty persecuted;

finding by experience, how potent, and irresistible the weapons of Christian
warfare were, when skilfully managed by men of parts and learning: Such as
those Atlasses of Christian Religion were before, and in, as also after his
time; who equalled the most renowned heathens in all learning; (as well, as
they exceeded them in true Religion) and in unspotted life's; Such among others
were Justin, a Philosopher and Martyr, Tertullian, Irenaeus, Cyprian, Origin,
(learned to a Miracle) So Clemens of Alexardria, Eusebius, Epiphanius; the

Which made Julian the Apostate, elder brother to this illiterate fraternity
(the despisers and destroyers of good learning) to become the Ravilliak, the
Faux of his times, Theodoret l. 3. cap. 8. Propriis pennis configimur a

the prime Assasinator, and grand conspirator, who sought to stab and blow up
all Christian Religion, by overthrowing all the nurseries of learning, and
suppressing the Schools of the Church: forbidding any Christians children to
be educated in humane and ingenuous studies; which he saw were become as the
outworks to the citadell of Christian Religion: (which sometime indeed needed
not these humane guards and defenses while the terrible and miraculous gifts of
the Spirit were like a pillar of fire, and cloud, round about Christian
Religion, during its wandering in the wilderness of persecution, no more, than

woman and her child; he then turned to other shifts; seeking by the floods of
corrupt doctrine, to poison those streams, which he could not stop: And so to
furnish out his new modelled Militia, with the better train and ammunition, he
stirred up learned adversaries against the Churches true and ancient faith; not
only without, as Origin answered Celsus, and Methodius: Eusebius and
Apollinaris wrote with great strength and dex^erity of learning against Po

Christian religion, 15. books. Suida^, and St. Je^om. St. Ambrose and

Celsus, Porphyrie, Proclus, Symmachus, and others; but even from within; as
Arius, Nestorius, Apollinaris, Macedonius, Eutyches, Pelagius, Donatus, and
others, very many: This masterpiece he carried on with most powerful
suggestions, and successes sometimes; knowing well, what force Error has, as
well as Truth; when it is charged, and discharged with skill and learning. In
so much, that he not only overthrew the Faith of many ordinary Christians; but
robbed the true Church, in part, and turned at last upon the Orthodox party,
those whole Canons, great and incomparable pieces of all learning both divine

Origin, (the converter of St. Ambrose) who formerly had by their accurate and
learned labors, both in preaching and writing, bravely asserted Christianity;
both by demolishing the old remaining forts of heathenish Idolatry, and
prejudice; as also battering the new rising works of heresies and schisms.

So that our moderate, illiterate factors for an old crafty Demon, do not, or
will not, consider; that there ever has been, still are, and ever may be,
learned adversaries opposing or Apostatizing from the true Christian Religion,
both in its fundamentalls, and its reformations. There are very learned
Jesuits, and other Papists, of all orders; there are learned Socinians;
renewed Palagians; revived Arians, and others, who want not learning; against
whom the learned Ministers of this and other reformed Churches, are often put
upon necessary, though uncomfortable, and unhappy contests; Not for any malice,
envy, or displeasure against any of their persons: (for learned men cannot but
love and esteem, whatever is good and excellent in others) but only from that
Conscience of Truth, which the Ministers of this and other reformed Churches
do conceive, upon Scripture grounds, and by the consent of the primitive and
purest Churches of Christ, they ought in all duty to God, to their own and
other souls, yet with charity to their Adversaries, to maintain; And, although
the warn in Christian Religion ought to be managed by learned men on all
sides, with all possible fairness, candor, and civility, such as the honor of
the Christian name and profession requires; (for the more illiterate men are,
the more rudely they bray and rail against one another) if it were a great sin
to be supine and negligent in so great an engagement, which we think to be for
Gods cause, the truth of Christ, and the good of souls: for which we ought to
be prudently vigilant and honorably valiant: It would ill become us while we
see the adverse party daily arming themselves, with all possible
compleatn^sse, in languages, arts, and sciences, in Fathers, councels, and
histories, for us to fit still in our lazy, and unlearned ignorance: expecting
either miraculous illuminations and assistances, (as idle, vain, and proud
minds do) or else, most inevitable ruin, and certain overthrow of that truth
and reformed Religion, which we profess to maintain; which in honor and
conscience, besides the bonds of nature, humanity, and charity, we are bound to
transmit, to posterity (if not much improved by our diligence and studies) yet,
at least, not sottishly impaired, to a just impeachment of waste against us, in
this age, from those, that in after times may succeed us; who will have no
great honor or happiness by being heirs to our estates, lands, and dignities,
if they be disinherited of all good learning, and that true reformed Religion
which we have received from our learned and pious predecessors.

And this infallibly will be the sad event, 7. The sad effects which must
follow these illiterate projects.
and unhappy fate of the succeeding generations in England; if such witless
lack latin Zelots can prevail in their absurd desires, and most fanatic
endeavors; who while they tell their silly disciples, (who are rather
spectators than hearers of these men's affected gesticulations, and ill acted
Oratory) That Latin and Greek are the languages of the Beast; that all books
but the Bible, (and as much of that, as they take not to be for their turns)
are Antichristian and to be destroyed: Sleidan. com. l. 10. An. 1524.
Mean time the common people are not so much men and reasonable, as to consider
the sad metamorphosis or change which already grows upon these Ignorant
Masters, and their scholars; who like to Lycaon, Io, or Actaeon, begin to
thrust forth their horns and hoofs; and to show their teeth, in their gross
errors, their rude, and savage manners; which are tokens evident and dreadful
enough of their brutised souls: That if the wiser, learneder, and powerfuller
world among us in England, should, through baseness, cowardly, and
negligence, suffer this illiterate and ferine faction to increase and multiply,
they will soon find, by their violence, craft and cruelty, that these Islands
will be more pestered and infamous for wolves; than ever they were in ancient
times.

And what is it that these men's brutish simplicity would have? Namely this:
That the purer Religion among the Protestant and Reformed Churches, should have
no learned Champions, or able defenders; but only such silly Asinellos, or
Massinellos, who think it enough to trust to their rude and irrational
confidences; to their hard heels, and harsher brayings, for the defense of true
Religion, when as the large and luculent ears of these animals do give so
great advantage to any crafty error, or grosser heresy to get hold of them,
that they will as easily be led to any damnable opinion, and desperate faction,
as an Ox is to the slaughter, and a fool to the stocks. For no men are more
easily led into any temptation, than those, who presume to tempt God, by
neglecting to use such due and proportionate means, as his wisdom in ordinary
providence has appointed, to attain those great and holy ends of true Religion.

Yet we may see, how all folly is ready to fall upon it self; to confute its own
principles; By a rude unskilfunesse it sometime bandies the ball of contention
against its own face: For these great sticklers against all good learning in
Ministers, do sufficiently show, they have fraud mixed with their folly; like
Foxes, they love not the grapes, while they cannot reach them; Their despair
of learning makes them despise it in others: Because it is hardly possible to
have any degree of true learning, and not to oppose them; But, O how do they
seriously triumph and superciliously rejoice, when any man, that is but a
smatterer in learning, or smells a little of the pen and inkhorn, (for other
than such ^^vices, and dunces never will so far shame themselves) appears for
them, or seems to lean, and adhere to them! how much more if he begins to
stickle for their party and faction, being deceived with their shows of zeal,
and inspirations! O how do they prick up their ears, and march then with
greater courage and confidence, (as the Hares did, when they had got a Fox to
lead them: in whom they thought was more strength, and cunning, than their own
fearful feebleness could be guilty of:) Even so these burglars in reason,
wresters of Scriptures, and hucksters of religion do find fault with those
Tools, which they have no skill to use; and, like cowards, they quarrel with
those weapons, as unlawful, which they most fear, and can least resist. Which
yet, could they once get into their hands, and abuse to their advantages, none
would be more imperiously cruel and insolent; St. Austin. de Doct. Christiae:
tells of a servant among the Barbarians, who by three days prayers (tridu^nis
precibus) obtained full knowledge in all humane learning: Ut librum quemlibet
percurreret omnibus stupentibus.
For what would not these Illiterate Furies give to have indeed, such an
Inspiration, as might in one night make them every way as learned and able in
all points, as those Ministers and other men have been and still are, who daily
pare the ruder nails, and muzzle the bolder jaws of these degenerate and
desperate men; who like horse and mule, being without understanding, are ready
to fall upon those, Psalm. 32.9.
that are fit to be their Masters and rulers, both in Church and State; who in
stead of found and healthful learning have only the three distempers which Sir
Sir Francis Bacon L. Ver. in his advancement of learning.
Francis Bacon observed to be in most men; Fantasticknesse, Contention, and
Curiosity, by imagination, altercation, and affectation.

But the enemies of good learning tell us; 8. Objection against learning as
injurious to true Religion; the parent or nurse of errors.
That they discern so many spots and black patches in the face of this fair
Lady, (...) they cannot esteem her a modest Virgin, or a grave and sober
Matron, or any way fit company for true Christian Religion; but rather some
prostitute of Impudicity, which is easily courted by every wanton spirit, and
often impregnated with gross errors, which it either conceives and brings forth,
or nourishes and beings up; yea they have heard (for these men read but
little, and understand less) that great heretics, and enemies to true
Religion have been great Scholars: And even in the bosom of the Church, these
vermin of heresies and schisms, have crawled most, since she put on and
adorned herself (as some thought) with this patcht and beggarly garment of
humane learning, which she took up in the high way of the Gentiles: Arius and
his crew wanted not learning; nor Aust. de Haeres. Pelagii viri, ut audio,
sancti, and non parvo profectu Christiani. Aust. c. 3. de pec. mer. Bonum and
praedicandum virum. Id. Pelagii and discipulorum libri propter acrimoniam and
facundiam leguntur a plurimis, Id. Ep. 144.
Pelagius Sophistry; nor Donatus eloquence, as St. Austin tells us; Nor those
others of former or later days, who made the Van, or bring up the Rear of
those forces, which the devil has mustered and trained up against the purity
and simplicity of the Gospel; Which (impediment; rather than ornaments, as
these men tell us, who presume to be better acquainted with the mind of
religion, than any Ministers, or other able Christians) it does now utterly
abhor, and to ashamed of; yea and would fai^^ quite cast away all those
glasses, and wimples, and crisping pins, and powders, and pa^ills, and
dressings, and curlings, and strange apparel, which she had borrowed of humane
learning; even as the Jewish women were weary of their toys and trinckets
which they had from the heathen; by which they provoked God against their
vanity, pride, Isai. 3.
and folly.

Thus are these men ready with their rude hands to witness Divinity; who,
being very b^nd and boisterous, Answ. Yet the benefit of learning is more than
the danger.
are not able to distinguish between pulling off the patches, or wiping away
those spots and paints, which a fair face needs not; and the shaving off that
hair which is given to Religion for an ornament and covering; Or the plucking
out of those eyes indeed which it needs, not only for beauty, but for
direction. The learning of heretic and schismatics does not so much defo^^
the Church, and true Religion, as the learning of Orthodox professors adorns,
and reformes it: which, as fullers earth, is the best means to take out those
kennel spots, which noisome spirits, and foul mouths cast upon true Religion;
There is the more need of wise and able Physicians to make wholesome Antidotes,
and confections, by how much there are so many, whose malice is cunning (as the
devils Empericks and empoisoners) to mix pestilent drugs, and infusions with
Religion.

1 Cor. 11 19.
There must be heresies, and heretics too: not as necessary effects an^
consequents of learning, and religion, but rather from the defects of them in
men's hearts and minds. When men are not, either able rightly to understand, or
not accurately to divide, or not exactly to distinguish, or not rationally to
conclude, from Scripture grounds, and principles of truth; Or else, when they
are prone grossly to mistake, and easily to yield to any semblances of truth,
and fallacies of error, which are incident to credulous incautions, unstable,
and unlearned souls, or to proud passionate and heady men, though never so
learned. Hence follows their not only forsaking the right way, and resolute
persisting in their dangerous and damnable mistakes (as sheep gone astray,
seldom ever returning of themselves to the fold and unity of the Church) but
they would also draw others after them, that they may not seem to err alone;
and by numbers at least, and force at last, carry on the evil opinions, which
always tend to evil practices; unless the Lord had always furnished his
Church with some learned and godly men; as able for reduction, as others were
for seduction; as potent to cure, as others are to infect; whose learning
defensive was more mighty than any offensive ever was: The flock of Christ was
always happily furnished with Mastives, whose teeth were as sharp, and strong,
as the Wolves; With David's, whose valor was always as great, as the ravening
strength of Bear or Lion; whom nothing else would have curbed and overawed; nor
have (without miracle) been able to have preserved the flock of Christ from
daily scatterings and tearings.

So then in all right reason, either wholly remove these offensive enemies, and
such weapons out of their heads and hands: or else give true Christian Religion
leave to keep her defensive Arms, and those worthy men, who are able to use
them; namely, the learned and godly professors, both Ministers and others of
this, and other Churches; both Christian, and reformed: Whose learning, courage
and honesty together, makes them impregnable: Whom otherwise, even these
pitiful pygmies, who now thus oppose them, would hope to be too hard for, if
once matters of religion were reduced only to tongues, and hands: for
Ignorance makes men violent, and for want of reason to fly to force. (...).
Arist. Eth.
Possibly these professors of ignorance, and rusticity, may be louder speakers,
and bolder fighters, though they be weaker disputants, and flatter writers: yea
we commonly see, that heretical pride, and schismatic passion, (in men,
that neither love the Truth, nor the peace of the Church) when worsted by
arguments, fly to Arms; as the Arians, and Donatists, and Novavatians did; when
refusing fair disputations, which the Orthodox Bishops and Presbyters desired:
Vide Ca ^. Afric. Council. Carth. An. 410
offering ((...)) orderly, and peaceable disquisitions, for the determining of
differences, so that Christian union might follow; They presently ran furiously
to mere brutish and tumultuary violences: (...); ad immaes violentias.
Invading Churches by force; driving away the Orthodox and holy Bishops and
Presbyters; who had not varied, nor would yield to change, that Faith, and holy
order of Religion, and Ministry, which still remained in all the Christian
Churches; as descended from the Apostles, and primitive Christians, and which
had lately been confirmed, and declared by the first famous Council of Nice,
which consisted of 318 Bishops; besides other many learned assistants, holy
Presbyters, and Deacons, together with some chief men of the laity; who were so
all of a mind, that there were but 17 dissenters in the vote against Arius.

After the same riotous fashion also was that ignorant and abominable rabble (as
it is called) of the Circumcelliones, (...). Can. Af^i. Genus hominum agreste
and famosissimae audaciae: Aust. cont. Cresco. l. 3. c. 42. Leniora tarrenum

(a subsection of the Donatists) who were wont to ramble idly up and down, like
squibs with fire and force, among the plain, and pagane Christians in the
country; till (after great ostentations of piety, devotion, and zeal for
Martyrdom, calling themselves St. Aust. de Haeret. Optatus.
(Duces Sanctorum) Captains of the Saints; and ((...)) contenders for the
faith, they fell at length to pilfering, then to plundering, and wasting whole
countries, opposing in an hostile manner the Vicegerents Pacelus and Mocatius;
till at length they were by the Emperor himself An. 348.
(Honorius) repressed and destroyed.

That many men abuse learning, to abet errors; and religion, to color
hypocrisy; and the name of the Spirit, to indulge the flesh; and heaven, to
carry on earthly designs, I make no question; nor will these objecters, I
believe; yet I do not think their morosenesse is such, as presently to
conclude, they must part with what they can well use, because they see others
daily abuse good things, as health, beauty, strength, riches, preferment, meat,
drink, clothing, etc. all which often nourish vanity, lusts, excess; The aching
of these men's heads, or teeth, makes them not willingly to lose them; no more
may the abuse of learning, take away the use of it; Wise men know, how to keep
a mean between starving and surfeiting; between drunkenness and cutting up all
vines; condemning all men to drink nothing, but such small stuff, as th^se
Antiministeriall Teachers intend to brew, whereby to keep all Christians as
they pretend in a sober simplicity, which project is among their other weak and
silly conceptions; For the fames and ^ent^sities, arising from ignorance,
emptiness, and want of good sustenance, may more trouble the brain with giddy
whimseyes and dizinesse, than can ever be feared from competent repletions,
unless men have very foul stomachs, or hot Livers: Wise men know to keep the
mean between the riot, and the want of learning; There are, faith Plato, two
diseases of the Soul of man ((...)) madness and ignorance; Plato in Timaeo.
Madness is from the abounding with pride and passion; Ignorance from the want
of knowledge and instruction: Ignorance is but a tamer madness: mad men have
lost their wits; and ignorant men never had them. Learning and Religion cure
both. The highest and most incurable madness is, an ungracious hatred of
learning, and an irreligious love of ignorance.

We see by sad experience, That true Religion is as subject to be drowned by
inundations of barbarity, and deluges of unlettered people, (fit to be
followers of Goths and Vandales; or listed with Jeek Cade, and Wat Tylar; or
subjects to the titular King of Sion, John of Leyden) as it is to be scorched
by the hotter beams of those Phaethons, who unskilfully manage the chariot of
the Sun; that is, make an ill use of good learning: Which is as the light of
the world; wherein Christian Religion is most honorably and most usefully
enthroned, when it is guided aright: neither depressing reason too low, by
fanatic novelties; nor exalting it too high, by intricate subtilties; Medio
tulissmus ibis, Ovid.
but keeping the middle way, of the necessary, plain, and most demonstrable
verities of Religion, which the Compass of right Reason measures exactly by
the scale of Scriptures. 9. Object. Many unlearned have been holy, etc.


But these Objectors tell us, That many holy and excellent Christians of the
common, and unlettered sort of men have been Worthies in grace and godliness;
who never found any want of S^^ls armor, those (...).

poisons of opinions are seldomer drunk, or pledged in these earthen vessels,
than in those of gold or silver; That their simplicity was contented to enjoy,
that one book necessary, The Scriptures: All other books they would have been
contented, as these men now, to have them sacrificed to Vul^an, an heathen god,
and meriting such heathenish oblations.

Answ. No doubt, but many very good Christians have been happily instructed,
Answ.
settled and preserved in says and holiness, who never were learned in any
book, but that of the Scripture. L. 1. de Doctr. Christian. S. Scripturas memo,
ia tenuit and intelle^it sine scientia litera^^n.
S. Austin tells that Anthony the Hermit, who could not read, had all the
Scriptures by heart, and understood them well; yea many, who never ^ead any
word in the Bible, yet have been blessed, by the Ministry of the Gospel, to
believe and obey the truth of it; which is indeed the life of religion, and the
quintessence of all learning. Yet it was the happiness of those honest
Christians, that they never met with such pragmatick depravers of all good
order, piety and learning, and Ministry, as these now are; for certainly they
had never learned from such, as these despisers of learning and Ministers are,
either the letter, or the true sense of the Scriptures: which they attained by
the learned labors of their Ministers, chiefly, both reading, translating, and
interpreting and preaching the Scriptures to them. They were happily freed from
such praters, whose pride and folly is heavier than any lead, or the sand of
the Sea; Pro. 27.3.
whose ungrateful humor would have taught them first to have cast off all
their true Ministers and Teachers; next, to despise them; and lastly, to
destroy them, by a most pious madness and spiritual ingratitude. They are not
only blind, but mad men, who wanting eyes themselves, would have all their
guides see no more than they do, that so both might fall into the ditch.
Whereas the humility of all sober Christians was ever such, as equalled their
piety, exceeded their knowledge, and compensated their illiteratenesse: so as
to be far enough from thinking themselves equal to, or above the first
three, their lawful Pastors and learned Ministers, by whose faithful
endeavors, and studies, those saving truths, and holy mysteries, were prepared
for them, and set before them: So that however they did indeed eat clean food;
the finest of the bread of life; yet they could not, but consider, whose
plowing, and sowing, and gathering; whose thrashing, and winnowing, and
grinding; whose kneading, and baking had provided and prepared those savory and
wholesome victuals for them, which their own blindness and feebleness, (like
Isaacks) could never have provided, or catered for themselves: That they did
always bless those Ministers, and that God, who sent such Joseph's to provide,
and distribute the food of heaven to his otherwise destitute, and famished
Church, which always consisted for the most part of that plebs, or community
of faithful and poor Christians; who were always happy in this; that,
although they had not provision of learning in their own storehouses and
cisternes; yet still they might have recourse to, and make use of their
Ministers fullness, and store: whose lips ought to preserve knowledge, and to
dispense it without envy or grudging: who rejoiced most, when their fountains
were most flowing forth to the refreshing of poor souls; The abilities of
learned Ministers have always been, like Jacobs and Moses his strength, Genesis
29.10.
a means to roll away the great stones, Exodus 2.17.
which lie on the wels mouth (the Scriptures) which are too heavy for ordinary
shoulders, and to protect feebler Christians from insolent opposers. So that as
the Eunuch^ ^^ked, how he should understand, Act. 8.31.
without an Interpreter to guide him. Ministers are therefore set by Christ in
his Church for lights, that each might enjoy them, as much as if each had their
sufficicencies: As the meanest part of the body has as much use of the eye,
Exodus 16.18.
as if it were an eye it self. That as it was in the Israelites gathering
Manna, so it is in the Church of Christ, when settled and flourishing; He that
gathered much had no overplus, and he that gathered little, had no lack. So
those honest Idiots, and Lay-Christians, (who have little or no learning,
beyond that faith and plain knowledge of the mysteries of Christ and the holy
duties belonging to a Christian) yet have no want of learning; And learned
Ministers who have attained most eminent skill in all sorts of good learning,
by Gods blessing on their studies, have no more than is needful for their
place and the Churches edification, or safety and preservation.

And much, I think, is needful, to give a right sense of Scripture, from the
original proprieties or emphasis of words: 10. Wherein learning is necessary
to Ministers. Si ad humara perdiscenda ^ta hominis vita brevis est, quid
temporis sufficere potest ad intelligentiam divinum? Chrysol.
To open the many allusions referring to Judaick rites and Ethnic customs in
several ages: To clear and unfold the Scriptures by short paraphrases, or
larger Commentaries: To analyze several passages so, as to reduce them to
their proper place and order of reasoning wherein their force consists, (as the
parts and joints of the body set in their due posture:) For the method of the
reasoning, and the strength of the argument, or main scope in Scripture, is often
very different from the series, and order of the words in the Text; Many times
the ambiguity of the words, the variety of stops, the incoherence and
independence of the sense as to the letter, makes the method more obscure, and
the meaning very intricate; yea the very text of Scriptures were in many copies
of Bibles anciently (as in St. Jeromes time; Jeronymus. in libris Jobi, and
Danielis, and aliis.
and before him in Origens) much altered, by addition to, or detraction from
the pure and authentic Scripture, until those and other learned men, the
Bishops and Ministers of the Church, with more accurate diligence reduced the
Bible to its purity, and integrity; as much as is attainable by humane
industry, (...). Basan him. 24. de Leg. Ethn.
or necessary to man's salvation; In these and the like cases I suppose, these
objectors, who are very simple (but not with a dove-like simplicity) must needs
confess (unless they wholly trust to the reed of their Enthusiasms, which
they have very little cause to do) that there is a great need of learned
Critics: of good Linguists; of methodicall Analysts; judicious Commentators;
accurate distinguishers; and harmonious reconcilers; that the truth, purity,
and unity of the sacred Oracles may be preserved and vindicated, against Jews,
Heathens, Atheists, Heretics, and capricious Enthusiasts; who are ready to
strike with contempt and passion, any part of Scripture, as useless, or
corrupted; if it slow not as the rock with an easy sense and obvious
interpretation to their weak and sudden capacities: They are instantly prone
with an high disdain and choler, to prefer their most impertinent imaginations,
sudden fancies and addle raptures.

Or, if they be ashamed of those, being too weak, gross, and impudent to be
vended at noon day, and in so faithful a light as yet shines in this Church;
then they are crying up the book of the creatures; and God in them; or they
applaud some easier moral heathens; And I should think nothing should fit
their fancies so well, as the Turkish Alcoran, or Jewish Talmuds, and Cabals;
for these (if any thing can) have already out done them in toys and incredible
fables; which may save them the labor of further inventions. Swine will prefer
the filthiest puddle, before the fairest springs: so will wanton proud and vain
men take any light exception against the Scripture; which they hate the more
perfectly, by how much they see it is a most perfect rule, and fully contrary
to their proud, 2 Timothy 3.16.
unjust and unruly passions: And however the shell of those holy and
unparelleld writings, the blessed Scriptures, be in many places rugged and
hard, so that every one cannot handle or break it; yet (blessed be God) others
can; nor is the kernel of saving Truth less sweet and smooth, because it is
not easily explained, but by the help of other men's better gifts; whom the Lord
raises up, and fitteth for this very end, with variety of gifts, even in
humane learning: Who (for the most part) have been of the order of the Clergy:
although, in these later times (especially,) diverse others, both Nobility,
Gentry, and Commoners, have been as excellent pioners, who have by their
private studies very cheerfully, and industriously assisted, and helped the
Churches chiefest Champions, and Leaders, the Ministers; who have not indeed,
every one, those sharp tools of steel, which can work at the hardest places of
this rock, and holy Mine, the Scriptures; yet have they generally such skill,
and leisure, beyond the Vulgar, as enables them to try the Ore, to gather and
refine the grains, to cast them into fit wedges or ingots of Gold: Truths
reduced to some body, method or common place of Divinity. Thus assisted by
their own and other studies, method, and industry, they are well able to make
plain, yet learned and judicious Sermons; with pathetick homilies, fitted to
the common peoples capacity, memory, and disposition: whom neither leisure, nor
necessities of life, and the hard labors under the Sun, nor abilities of
mind, would suffer or serve (one of a thousand) to attain to any competent
measure of religious knowledge; if holy and learned men, (Ministers of the
Church) were not enabled by God, approved by the Church, and ordained by both,
to that constant service of the Ministry, for the good of the plainer
Christians; who enjoy, in every point of true doctrine, or solid Divinity,
(which is as a weighty piece of gold stamped with the clear testimony of the
Scripture, (as people do in every piece of current money) the extract of the
labor, and the result of the art of many men's heads and hands, who have thus
fitted it for their ordinary use.

Besides this, when common people are once well stored, and enriched in their
honest plainness, with competent and sound knowledge in Religion by the care
and faithfulness of their able and honest Ministers; yet how easily would the
cheats of Religion, delude and impose on these poor Souls, (these plain and
single hearted Christians) abasing, or changing counterfeit, with truths; cropped
opinions, and roundheaded tenets, for full weight of Christian doctrines: Still
cogging with religious (...). Ephesians. 4.14.
dice, and cheating with plausible fallacies, seemingly brought out of the
Scripture; until those poor believers, like the Gal. 3.1.
bewitched Galatians, had lost all, or their most part of their sound Religion;
yea, some of these Impostors do not leave poor Christians, whom they have
consened with fair shows of the Spirits revelations, and new Gospels, so much
faith, as to believe the main Articles of the Christian Faith; or the
Scriptures to be the Word of God; or, that there is any true Church, or any
order and authority of true Ministry: And whither would not this cousenage and
deceit of these hucksters proceed, 2 Cor. 2.17. (...).
even to overthrow whole houses, Parishes, and Churches, if there were not some
learned and able Ministers in the Church; who are as Gods and the Churches
public Officers, to detect these jugglers, to discover these deceitful
workers, 2 Cor. 2.17. (...).
to set these cheats in the pillory of public infamy; that they may loose

hearing well; that credit and fame of gifts which they cover and captate among
the Vulgar; and which they would enjoy, by reason of their many wiles, and
artifices, by which they ly in wait to deceive with good words and fair
speeches, (as the Devils setting Dogs) the well affected and plain hearted
Christians, Romans 16.18.
if they were not every where routed, and confounded by the Ministers of the
Church, who are both far abler and honester men, and to whose charge the flock
of Christ, in its several divisions and places is committed; that they may
take care it suffer no detriment either in truth, or in peace; in faith, or
manners; in Doctrine, or in holy order. Thus then, although the souls, and
faith of the meanest true Christians be alike precious and dear to God, 2 Pet.
1.1.
as the most learned men's, yet they are not pieces of the same weight for
gifts; of the same extension for endowments; of the same polishings for
studies; nor of the same stamp and authority for their calling and office; All
which, as they are not to the essence of true grace, and religion; so they are
much, to the luster, power, beauty, order, usefulness and communicativenesse
of those gifts, which go with true Religion; and are by the Lords munificence
bestowed on the Church and faithful, for their well being, safety, and
comfort, even in this world; besides their happiness in another, which ought
to be the grand design of all true Christians, both Laymen and Churchmen, both
learned and unlearned, both Governors and governed.

But these Illiterato's further object with open mouth; 11. Object. Christ and
his Apostles had no humane Learning.
That they are sure neither Christ nor his Apostles, had themselves, or
commended to the Churches use, humane learning.

Answ. My answer is; They needed none, as humane; that is acquired by ordinary
education, or industry; being far above it, by those glorious and miraculous
endowmen^s of the Spirit of wisdom, which can easily shine in a moment
through the darkest lanterns; (men of the meanest parts and grossest
capacities) So that those might as well dispense with the absence of all
acquired humane learning, as he that has the Suns light, needs not the Moon or
Stars, or Candles; or he that had Angels wings and swiftness, would not want
the leg of man, or beast to carry him: or he that is near a living and
inexhaustible spring, needs not labor to dig wels, as Isaac did: and so must
we too, Genesis 26.1^.
in the barren and dry land, where we live; which none but inhumane Philistims
would stop up. This therefore of Christ and his Apostles is not more peevishly,
than impertinently alleged by these men, in these times, against the use of
good learning in the Churches Ministers; unless the real experiences of these
men pretended Apostolical gifts, extraordinary endowments, and immediate
sufficiencies from the Spirit of God, could justify these allegations; either
as fitted to them, as to the present dispensations of Christ to his Church;
Although the Lord sometime gave his Church water out of a rock, and refreshed
wearied Samson by a miraculous fountain, which suddenly sprung up in Lehi (not
in the Jaw Bone, but in the place so called, from Lehi, (i.e.) the Jaw Bone,
Judge. 15.19.
by which instrument he had obtained so great a victory; there where it
continnued afterward:) yet, I believe, these men will think it no argument to
expect every day such wonderful emanations; and neglecting all ordinary means,
to expect from the Jaw-bones of Asses water, or drink to quench, their thirst:
I am sure this Church has not yet found any such flowings forth, or refreshing
from the mouths of these Objecters; whose lips never yet dropped like Hermon,
so much as a Dew of sweet and wholesome knowledge upon any place; and how
should they? whose tongues are for the most part set on fire; and breathe out,
with much terror, nothing but ashes and cinders; like Vesuvius or Etna; whose

non didicit quod omnes doceret. Amb. off. l. 1. Matthew. 5, 45.
As for our blessed Lord Christ; we know he was filled with all the treasures of
wisdom, both divine and humane; for, being greater than Solomon, he could not
come short of Solomon's wisdom in any thing; who was in all his glory but a
Type and shadow of Christ, and no way comparable to him: Our Saviors design,
indeed, was, not as Platos, or Aristotle's, to advance natural Philosophy, mere
morality, humane learning, and eloquence; (the beams of which Sun, by common
providence, God had already made to shine by other ways, on the bad, as well
as the good; on the heathens as well as the Jews and Christians;) but Christ's
intent was, Mal. 4. 1 Cor. 1.26.
by word and deed, to set forth the beams of the Sun of righteousness, the
wisdom of the Father; the saving mysteries of his Cross, and sufferings in
order to man's improvement; not by humane learning, but by divine grace: And
however our Blessed Savior has crucified, as it were, the flesh, and pride of
humane learning, (as well as of riches, honor, and all worldly excellencies;
which are infinitely short of the knowledge and love of God in Christ) yet he
quickened and raised them all by the Spirit; which teaches a sanctified and
gracious use of them all to his Church, Luke 2.48.
and true believers. Our Lord Jesus did not disdain to converse with the
learned Doctors, and Rabbis of his time; among whom he was found after his
parents had sought him sorrowing; because in vain, otherwhere; yet our
wanderers and seekers are loath to seek; afraid to find, and disdain to own
Jesus Christ, when they have found him among the learned men, and Ministers of
this Church; lest in so doing, they should seem to confess they had lost
Christ, and true Religion, 12. The objecters may not argue from the Apostles
gifts against learning now since they have neither of them.
in their illiterate Conventicles and ignorant presumptions.

As for the blessed Apostles, who were ((...)) immediately taught of God, by
conversing with the Son of God the Lord Jesus Christ, the Christian world well
knows their miraculous and extraordinary fullness of all gifts, and powers of
the Spirit, both habitual and occasional; so that they wanted neither any
language nor learning, which was then necessary, to carry on the great work of
preaching, and planting the Gospel: And no less does the wiser world know the
emptiness and ridiculous penury of these (disputers against good learning)
even as to the common gifts of sober reason, and judicious understanding;
wherewith the blessing of heaven is now wont to crown only the prayers, (...).
Cl. Al. Pro. 1.
and studies of those, that attend on Wisedoms gates with all humble industry:
whose great proficiencies these poor men envying, (as they have great cause)
would fain persuade them to be as much sluggards, as themselves are; (who have
neither hunted, Contra bona^ literas bla^erant, (...). Chrysostom. (...). Naz.
or. 27.
nor caught any thing) by Pro. 12 27.
not roasting what they have taken in hunting; that is, not to use those gifts
of learning in all kinds, which Ministers have attained unto, by Gods blessing
on their studies.

As for that Primitive gift of Tongues, by which the Apostles at once suddenly
thawed, and brake that Ice, which now locks and seals up to us the face of the
great deep of Learning and Wisdom; so that they were instantly Masters, not
only to understand, but also to utter, the mysteries of Christ, (whereof they
had partly an acquired, by Christ's teaching, but for the most part, an inspired
knowledge:) These pitiful praters, who would be counted Apostolical, are so
far from any such gifts of wisdom, or utterance, that they are scarce masters
of their own mother tongue, neither knowing, for the most part, what they say,
1 Timothy 1.17.
nor whereof they affirm; nor able with modesty, gravity, humility, or charity,
either to use, or bridle their tongues; (which is an Apostolical brand on
them; showing that their Religion is but vain; James 1.26.
) And how can it be otherwise, where sober speech, sound reason, common sense,
and ordinary ingenuity, are as much wanting; as pride, contempt of others,
intractable fierceness, and indocible ignorance do abound? When their great
art is, to set off to some popular show and acceptance, their gifts and
persons, 2 Pet. 2.18.
by proud swelling words: sometimes soring in the height of raptures, and rare
speculations, beyond sobriety; as if they were from sudden inspirations; when
indeed they are nothing else but some odd ends of metaphysicall questions, and
devotionary contemplations; which are every where found among the Schoolmen,
and Monasticks; or in the Platonists, Plotinus, Pimander, and the like; to
which Authors these men being strangers, yet drunk with their own fancies,
sometimes they reel, and stumble upon such notions; which vainly puff them up
in their fleshly minds; Col. 2.18.
while they are still but clouds without water, carried with the tempests of
passions, Iud. 12.
and high presumptions above the plain, practical and useful truths of
Religion; and indeed above the proportion and sphere of their own gifts and
parts: Other whiles they seem as Well without water, deep, but dark and dry, in
their profound follies and profane niceties; as the Manichees, Valentinians,
and others of old; by which they seek to confound, God with the creatures; good
with evil; Nature with Grace; Vice with Virtue; Law with the Gospel; Christ
with Devils; By all which rarities, amazing their silly auditors, they are no
other but cunning Agitators for ignorance, atheism, profaneness, hypocrisy,
and superstition; that the life and power of the Christian reformed Religion
may be wholly baffled, and despised together with the Ministry of this Church:
What can these wretched men expect, but the blackness of darkness for ever to
be reserved for them (without repentance) who study to cry down all good
studies, 2 Pet. 2.17.
and learning; that they may the better eclipse all true and reformed Religion?

Such Pharisees (for few of them are good Scribes) are like indeed to make
excellent Teachers of the Kingdom of heaven, Mat. 12.35.
who are not able to bring forth any things, either old or new, having no
Treasure of well digested knowledge, either divine or humane; but only some of
the rubbidge of that learning, which they seek to destroy; pitiful rapsodies
of such confused stuff, as they have scraped together; which becomes none but
babl^rs and pamphleters; Which, whoever considers seriously, how much they have
been a shame, and bane to true Religion, to the honor of this reformed Church,
and to those holy manners which become sober, wise, and modest Christians, he
would ever after love learning and learned Ministers the better, by how much he
sees infinite cause to abhor the sordid and shameful effects of impudent
ignorance; which loves to batten in its own soil; and refuses to be cleansed:
Such mouths full of errors, and foul with evil speakings, however the
Timothies and Titusses of this Church cannot now stop, Tit. 1.11.2.15.
(as they ought to do; if the exercise of that just power in the Church were
not obstructed) yet they ought to rebuke them sharply, and with all authority.

And until these Seraphick despisers of true, useful and sanctified learning
can (not boast and clamor among their Disciples, who are now grown giddy with
too high notions and airy speculations, but till they can) evidently
demonstrate to the wiser and soberer world; that they can indeed perform, what
they pretend; that is, by immediate gifts, and unstudied enablings they can
solidly comprehend, soberly preach, methodically explain, clearly demonstrate,
the sacred mysteries of our Religion: also resolve the difficulties, reconcile
the differences, and determine the doubts, or controversies arising out of the
Word of God, or the points of Religion; so, as in some measure may tend to
satisfy men's judgments, together with the scruples, and cases of their
consciences: Till I say, these men can do these in some competent measure,
equal at least, if not beyond, what the learned Ministers of this Church have
done, and daily do, by the blessing of God on their labors; they must give us
leave still to follow our studies, with humble prayers and diligent pains; That
so in stead of the husks, and chafe of these men's specious words, and popular
insinuations, (sadly deploring, and proudly despising those excellent
abilities, which are in true Ministers, far above them) we may help to feed
poor hungry souls; not with frothy vanity (wherewith these proud Masters send
their scholars away, as puffed up and as empty as themselves) but with good
corn, and that wholesome provision of sound knowledge and saving doctrine,
wherewith the Lord is pleased to furnish us, in the honest, and ordinary way of
his providence and blessing upon our industry: for we have now no Manna or
Quails about our tents; which, while these men dream of, mean time exceeding
leanness is entered into their souls: Psalm. 106.15.
And how can it otherwise be, than, that sowing vanity, Hos. 8.7.
and visions of their own hearts, they should reap other, than wind^: and be
satisfied, as they are extremely, (but most unhappily) with their own
delusions? 13. Inspired holy men yet used their learned gifts.


We do not read that either Moses, or Solomon, or Daniel, or St. Paul, (first
educated at Tarsis celebris Cilicia Vrbs, and Academia; ipsis Athenis, and
Alexand^iae comparanda, Strabo. St. Jeromes Epist. ad Mag. answers that
q^estion, Cur candorem Ecclesiae Ethnicis sordibus polluamus: and shows by the
examples in holy Scripture and other holy writers, what holy use is to be made
of the learning of heathens by Christians. See Tom. 2. page 331. St. Paul cites
three testimonies out of heathen Poets, Epimenides, (...), etc. Menander,
(...), etc. Arat^^, (...), etc. So Jannes and Jambres out of Jewish Records and
Talmuds. Plures sine dubio legerat: B. Paulus poetas, quam quos recitavit; and

Tarsis a famous University; and after at the feet of Gamaliel) or Attick Luke,
or eloquent Apollos, ever despised, or decryed, or disused those acquired gifts
of humane learning; wherewith they were endued in the ordinary ways of
education; no not, when they were ex^raordinarily inspired: Their common gifts
served them still in their ordinary Ministry; as to understanding, memory,
utterance, or writing; by which they endeavored to set forth, that Jesus was
the Christ, the promised Messiah; So that in their arguments, disputes,
reasonings, and allegations out of humane Authors; also in the style, phrase,
and manner of their speaking, and writing, it might and may easily be that the
difference of Prophets, Evangelists, and Apostles natural, acquired, or
studied gifts, did still remain; when their extraordinary and infused might be
equal; yet these did not equal them in their either more strict and Logical
reasonings, or their more Oratorious expressions; or more elegant phrase and
proper language; which appear very different in those holy Writers and Penmen
of the Scriptures, which had the same Spirit directing or dictating, as to the
matter revealed to them; but they used their own ordinary abilities to express
them by word, or pen, to others.

And certainly when the Apostle Paul bids Timothy (as a grand and lasting
pattern for all Bishops and Ministers of the Church, to study, to meditate, to
give himself wholly to those things, 1 Timothy 4.13, 14.15.
that his profiting may appear, to stir up the gift that is in him, still more
fitting himself to the work of the Ministry, (notwithstanding he had some
special and extraordinary gifts) Sure the same Apostle gave Timothy no example
of idleness in himself; but both studied and prayed; Ephesians. 6.18.
yea desires the prayers of others for him, that he might (as an able Minister,
and as a Master builder) finish the course of his Ministry with joy; This
blessed Apostle needed not have been so solicitous for the parchments, 2 Timothy
4.13.
which he left at Troas, if his memory had been always supplied with
miraculous assistance; he needed not to have committed any thing to writing for
his own use. It is very probable that those parchments were no deeds, for
conveying any land or temporal estate; but rather some Scheme or draught of
divine Truths and mysteries, methodically digested; which he had fitted for his
own, 1 Cor. 4.6.
and transferred to the use of others, as Apollos, or Timothy, or Titus: So
little does the special gifts of the Spirit, in the Apostles or other holy
men, justify or plead for those odd and misshapen figures of those men's
Divinity, whether discovered by their tongues or hands; of whose deformity, and
unpolitenesse, compared to the fashion of all learned men's judicious,
methodicall, and comely writings, and discourses, these crafty men being
conscious, would have no Sun, or light of arts and learning shining among
Christians, by which their ridiculous monstrosity might appear.

2 Col. 1.8. 1 Timothy 6.20. In tantum vana est quantum perversae. felicitatis est
doctrina, gentium Philosophia. Tertul. l. de Anima.
The same Apostle who bids us beware of vain Philosophy, and wisdom falsely so
called (while it opposed the divine; or was preferred before the word and truth
of God in Christ, which only can attain the end of all true wisdom, to make
a man happy to eternity) yet he could be no enemy to any part of true and
useful Philosophy; which is but the knowledge of God in the creature, of which
he gives several touches, in his most divine writings; He commands us, no
less, to beware of Romans 1.21. 2 Timothy 4.3. Imperitissima est setentia scire

But O you, that excel in learning or humility, or both? 16. Monument of
learning how excellent and useful.
I should fear to write too much for good learning, if I did not consider, that
I write to those chiefly who can never think too much said, or wrote for it;
because they know the many beauties and excellencies of it, both in reference
to the glory of God, and the good of mankind, both for souls and bodies, their
religious and secular concernments, their temporal and eternal interest.

Indeed, no mind is able to conceive, but such as enjoy them, Aegrescit
ingenium, nisi fugiactione reparetur.

nor can any tongue express them, (since they exceed the greatest eloquence of
those that most enjoy them) those bright, heavenly, and divine beams of Reason
and Religion; which, with several preparatory glories, shine from the daily
reading of those excellent writings, and durable monuments of learned men in
former ages; as rays of light, falling from the Sun, on this inferior world;
breaking in upon all the regions of the soul: dissipating its darkness;
discovering its disorders, supplying its defects; filling it with the sweet and
silent Jucundissima est vita indies sentire se fieri doctiorem.
pleasure of daily knowing something more excellent in the creature, or the
Creator, which before it knew not: This secret and unspeakable contentment is
more welcome to the now improving soul, than the beauty of a fair morning,
which shows a safe haven to one, that has suffered the horror of blind and
midnight tempests; more rejoicing the heart of a true man, than liberty and
light do him, that is redeemed from a dungeon.

I should but profane, if I should too much unfold the sacred and sweet
mysteries of learning, to an age that begins to learn their letters backward;
to love only the hatred, and despising of learning, that will not be able in
the next generation to read their Ne^kverse, as loath to have the benefit of
their Book or Clergy. I know it is lost labor to read Lectures (if they were
as splendid for their eloquence, as their subject) upon Pearls or Precious
stones to Swine, who had rather find out one ^^rn on a dunghill, and mousle up
one root out of the earth, than have the Gems of both the Indies. Illos suis,

These have deserved to be condemned to that illiterate folly, which they have
chosen; to the rags and sorder, which they affect to wear; to the blear eyes,
which they so abhor to cure, that they rather covet to infect all others.

But to men of more liberal, ingenuous and noble spirits, I know it cannot be
unwelcome, to tell them, Vide Synefium de voluptate studicrum and pramio.
(...); Synes.
what pure and refined contentment, what sweetness and honey there is to be
gathered, from those fair and never fading flowe^s of learning, which God has
made to grow in the field or garden of his Church; what life, (...). Longin. S.

what joys, what raptures, what noble and holy emulations are often raised up in
that soul which daily and seriously converses with learned men either a live or
dead? How when all other narrow Seas, Inland Meers, or Mechanic Lakes,

applause, victory, enlarged Empire, etc. all which have their envious bounds,

Ocean of learning and Sea of knowledge is unlimited; always discovering

out of envies, force, or fortunes reach; as unseparable from us, as we are

those of error; no shelfes, but those of ignorance; no quick sands, but those
of our own fancies; no pirates, but those aboard us and within us; our own
vicious lusts and passions; which only do threaten us, and only can wrack
us, or rob and hurt us; yea, and these are only upon the shores and keys of
learning, where men first embarque; and where some lazy, or timorous, or proud,
and sensual spirits stay all their lives; but they are not in the full Sea,

and vast extension of Learnings boundless and bottomless Empire; In which
the humble, devou^, and industrious soul once fully engaged, is every day more
removed, and out of sight of the world: far from those fears, hopes, hazards,
disorders, and discontents, which attend those, whose covetousness, or
ambition, or passion, or lust still keeps them either on the shore of
ignorance, or but on the borders of knowledge: who rather court Learning for a
Mistress, than wed her for a Wife.

From all which dangerous remora's, and shallower coasts, those only are
removed, as it were to another world, which is intellectual, and divine,
(having little common with beasts, nothing with vain and wicked men) who being
well advanced in all good learning, both divine and humane, begin at length to
find themselves differ from, and exceed themselves, (and all others who ^est

contentment, which loves, and admires, and imitates, and so enjoyes all that

incomparable predecessors, (...). Stobae. Aeterna sunt animorum monumenta Libri.
the remains of whose souls are still extant; which otherwise would have
seemed to have been of nobler metal, than their bodies; and these, but level
to the dust of beasts, unless their learned labors had testified to the
world, how they had lived as much above the ordinary rate of men, as these do
above the beasts; which most of men either serve; or, which is worse, love
more, than their own souls. To these Patrons and professors of learning we owe
our ingenuity, our courtesy, our civility: (for morose and rustic learning,
which has only rough-hewen a mere Scholar, or molded up a rude and rugged
Philosopher, is as gold yet in the oar, or a jewel neither polished nor well

but not that luster it merits, and might well bear.) To them we owe our
gratitude, our humanity, our rational, and religious liberties, which redeem
us from being beasts, or devils; Their care and labors have absolved us from

shameful and dangerous diseases; who love ignorant and flattering
Mountebankes, more than the most learned and faithful Physicians of souls,
which are the ablest and best Ministers; who cannot be less necessary for the
inward health of the mind, than these are for the body, who are one sort of
those, whom learning has fitted for the common good. For I do not think
Learning and true study to be only a couch to rest a soft and wearied mind
upon; or a tarasse to please a wandering spirit, with some variable and pretty
prospects; or as a Tower for a proud soul to raise and magnify it self upon,
as Nebuchadnezzar on his Babel; or as a Fort for a contentious Sophister to
keep, in a disputative war, and Logical defiance against all the world; Nor is
it as a shop for a covetous man to drive his trade, and get gain by the brokage
of some ancient pieces: But it is as a grand Magazine, and Catholic Storehouse
of all divine and intellectual excellencies, affording to all men, upon all
occasions, happy advantages, by which to glorify the wise and admirable
Creator, and also to furnish both a man's self and others with what may most
conduce to his temporal and eternal felicity: Good learning is neither a
wanton Courtisan, only for dalliance and pleasure; nor yet a slave and drudge,
entertained merely for a sordid and illiberall profit; but as a chaste and nobly
spirited Wife, for sweet society and legitimate productions, worthy of such
parents, a reasonable Soul and good Literature, happily espoused and married
together. We often see, that moderate minds, with but a small stock of learning
well managed, attain to be masters of great affairs, and become as useful, so
very desirable in humane societies in practical ways: others of more
speculative retired and sublime learning are not less in In animis

magnitude, but farther remote from sublunary things, having that in their
height, and neighborhood to heaven, which they seem to want in their light and
eradiations downward; In both, besides the private contents they enjoy in the
contemplations of reasons, and Religions beauty (both which fair faces are best
represented in the glass of learning) they have a kind of Empire and
Sovereignty over all things, and all men, in all times, who appear at the
tribunal of their judgments, fall under their cognizance, and stand to that
censure they pass upon them, both in present and after ages, either for vice
or virtue, honor or baseness, gallantry or villainy; How ever Arms and

I might add, if any colors could express, or add to this intellectual
beauty, (Learning;) what had we not lost of Reason and Religion; or what had we
enjoyed (as men) of our forefathers, more than beasts do of their sires and
dams; if those had not left us the benefit of their piety and experience; the
inheritance of their wise observations; the issues of their brains and pens?
which far exceed those of their goods, lands, and bodies; Since the immortal
remains of their minds in piety, Aliud est uti, aliud frui quae habeas bona:

wisdom, honor, and virtue, teach us to enjoy, what otherwise we, only,
should have had or used: and to live, where, else, we should have only had a
being, and bare existence in the world, not many degrees above the beasts, who
have all that is needful for the body; but neither consider what they have,
nor from whose bounty, nor to what end, nor within what bounds of virtue, all
things are to be used.

These excellencies peculiar to mankind, above all creatures, we owe (beyond
all dispute) to those records of learning, and piety left us, in all kinds, by
our famous predecessors; (...). Cl. Al.
and to the studious industry of those sublimer spirits, who have been
impatient to suffer those inestimable relics of our forefathers Souls to be
devoured by time and moths, to be buried in dust and forgetfulness; who never

clothe its back, to satifie its lusts, Vita enervis and luxatu nimi^ o^io; quo

degenerate to brutish sensualities, and become wholly devoted to the beast of
the man, the Body; In illiteratis and indoctis maximam partem hominis brutum
occupat. Sen.
which has nothing on it remarkable, but this; that it is married to a
rational and immortal Soul; not to debase and oppress it, but to serve it:

there can be no better account given at their death, A pecudibus non sententia
sed lingua discernit. Lact. de Epicu. (...). Plat. Crito.
then may be of an hog; That being most indocible, he wallowed at his ease, fed
well, dyed very fat, and very unwillingly; worthy of the Epitaph on the
Epicures Tomb, Tanquam poeniteret non pecudes natos. Sen. Habui quod edi.
That only I enjoyed which I did eat.

17. Illiteratenesse no reproach or discouragement to humble Christians.
Not that here I do any way despise, or degrade those sober good Christians of
either sex, whose education, parts, and way of life has, and does deny them
the advantages of personal learning; such as is immediately acquired by the
study of excellent books: For, first; true wisdom is the same in all
languages, and may be obtained in conversation in part, as well as by reading;
Next, they have by Gods providence, and indulgence to them, the blessing of
many learned men's directions, (both Ministers and others) and the benefit of
their good example; whom they have the more cause to love and value, by how
much they see their own defects; which while they humbly and diligently supply
by the helps which learned men afford them, they testify, not only to others,
the grateful sense, and high esteem they have of the labors of learned men,
imparted to them; but also hereby they do, as it were, admit themselves into
the company of learned men, and are adopted into the family, and fraternity of
Learning; (...). Plato. de rep. dial. 10.
mutual love, and charity ingraffing these lovers of learned men, into the
same stock, of whose sap, and virtue they are daily partakers; being diligent
attenders upon those whom God has let over them, for this purpose; that they
may be happily taught by them, as children by their Fathers: while the ignorant
pride of others keeping them at a surly, and to themselves most injurious,
distance, they not only enjoy nothing of learning in themselves, but by the
neglect and disesteem of it in their Ministers, are for ever condemned to their
silly beggary and supercilious folly.

The wisdom of God, as in civil, so in Church societies has so tempered the
different parts, as in the natural body* where all members are useful in
their kind, but not all of equal honor, for the excellency of their
faculties and functions; 1 Cor. 12.
yet the diamonds of the eyes cannot well want the clay and pebles of the toes:
Nor are the nobler Organs of the Senses so excellent or commendable in any
thing, as in this, that they are useful and servient not to themselves so
much, as to those less beautiful, but not less necessary parts of the body,
for whose direction and good, Nature intended them: Neither charitable
learning, nor humble ignorance will make any scornful, or envious schism in a
well formed body: whose beauty is the variety and Symmetry of parts. It were an
unnatural barbarity for the eyes to deny their light and guidance to the body,
or for the fightlesse parts to despise, envy, and seek to destroy those two
great lights, which the wise Creator has set up in the little world of man's
body. Such is the distemper and madness of those, who seek to hoodwink with
poverty; to blind with contempt; to put out with violence the great Luminaries,
both of Church and State, Learned men and Ministers, who are the ordinary means
by which true (both humane and divine, moral and mysterious) knowledge is
imparted to the common people; without which neither hearts nor lives of men
cannot be good; Blind affections are no more acceptable to God, than blind
sacrifices, which were only fit for fools; Mal. 1.10.
However God works grace by a more immediate, divine influence of his Spirit;
yet it is by such means rationally preparing, and disposing, as he has
appointed in the Church; without the diligent and conscientious use of which,
it is as in vain to bea^t of grace, and the Spirit, as it is to expect the heat
of the Sun, without its light; or to hope for har^est without preceding summer.

A plea for the nurseries of learning: the two famous Universities.
The ignorant weakness and fiercer rudeness of those men, with whom I have
chiefly in this Apology, and in this part of it to contend, may justify this
my so large vindication of learning; as necessary in other persons of public
influence, so chiefly in Ministers, whose errors or rectitudes are of the
highest concernment, as conversant in matters of God, of Souls, and of
Eternity. I should otherwise, be very jealous, that I had said too much in so
clear a subject; (which needs as little, and deserves as much commendation, as
the Sun in the Firmament) when I remember to how many men of learned abilities
I make my address; of whose person all sufficiencies in this kind of
excellency, as I have no cause to doubt, for I see some of them have undertaken
the public honor and protection of these (Kiriath-sephers) the sometime
famous and flourishing Vniv rsities of this English Nation; Josh 15.16.
Kiriath-sepher: Civitas librerum and literarum.
The two fair eyes of this Church and State; and the two greatest eye sores of
these Antiministerial Levellers; which above all things as Ravens they aim to
pluck out, or so to blind, that they shall not be of any use, either to
Learning, or to the reformed Religion.

But I presume, that persons of any true worth, Learning, Honor, Valor, or
Religion, will never suffer these goodly Garrisons, citadels and magazines of
all good literature to be plundered, slighted, or disbanded, either by
military, or mechanic rudeness: For besides the shame and infinite dishonor,
which it would be before all civilized Nations under heaven, to do, or suffer
so great insolence and injury to be done, against them, and in them against the
public good and honor both of Church and State: It cannot but also be a most
crying sin before God; if either we consider that sacrilegious barbarity, which
must in this be committed against (not the living only in their rights, but
even against) the Dead; the Monuments of whose devout piety and charity are
there deposited; and by many learned men enjoyed, as in unviolable Sanctuaries;
Or, if we duly weigh, in order to Gods glory, the many great and public
blessings, Specimen est florentis reipub. ut disciplinae professoribus praemia
opulenta pendantur. Sym. 1.73. Literatura instrumentum est ad omnem bumanam
vitam necessarium. Tertul. de Idol.
which by the bounty and providence of God have, from the benign light and
influence of those two great Constellations, constantly and liberally flowed
upon this Nation, to its unspeakable honor and advantages, both in Church and
State: Which are so eminent, and so necessary, both to the well being of souls
and bodies of men; in all degrees and estates; that no tongue, or pen can with
gratitude enough to God acknowledge them; For take it from the highest, who fit
upon Thrones, judging the Tribes, to the lowest, who grind at the mill: Neither
Counselors, nor Judges, nor Justices, nor Commanders, nor Lawyers, nor
Physicians, nor Ambassadors, nor public Agents, nor any ingenuous employment;
nor the meanest honest mechanics, Scipio liberalium studiorum author and

can dispense with the want of chose blessings, of truth, order, peace, health,
good laws and Religion, which from those Seminaries of good learning are
derived to, and enjoyed by all sorts of men in this Nation.

It concerns no men to have good learning decryed, Veritas luce and mora; falsa

and the Universities demolished, but only juglers, cheaters, and impostors,
whose gains are like to be greatest, when their deceits are least discernible
for want of true light; Greenewood and Barrow petitioned Q. Elizabeth (of B.
M.) to dissolve the Universities that their factious ignorance might be
gratified with so great a dishonor to this Nation, Camden.
So prodigious tongues and pens were those heretofore, and now, which by an
unnatural envy, brutish ignorance, barbarous malice, or sordid covetousness,
seek to deprive the children of this Nation, of such full and fair breasts, as
these Nurses afford; as if we were all defigned to turn Amazons, and that
fitting our selves for Arms only, and not Arts, we must cut off, not only
one, but both our breasts: Or as if the after generations were to suck not
milk, but only blood; like the child which Aristides painted so lively, which
searching for the breast, applied it self to the wound of its dying mother;
which she now dying seems to remove from the wound to the breast. Plin. Not.
hist. l. 35. 10.


But, O you nobler, and better educated Souls, Plato. in Men. (...). I shall
always exhort the sons of worthy men to be both very learned and very good.
who therefore love good learning, because you either have it, or enjoy the
blessings of it, your own, and the public honor are so interessed in this
point, that no sober man can suspect, that any of you are of your selves so
inclined, or can be brought by others Turkish importunities and Barcarities, to
the least thought of neglecting the preservation of these two incomparable
Seminaries of all good Learning, which have in former ages furnished both
Church and State with so many excellent, both Magistrates, and Ministers; which
places for liberal allmony, for sweet, and quiet accommodations, for copious,
and rare Libraries, for stately buildings; and (which is the soul of
Universities) for men of eminent learning, and piety, were not to be exceeded,
scarce paralleld in all the world. To whose complete felicity nothing can be
wanting that either friends would most desire, or enemies most ma^^ign, if such
order, government, B^^arum artium profession (...) malis moribus corruperunt

and good discipline in point of moralls, and practiques be added, as best
becomes learned and ingenuous men: whose greatest honor is, to have learning,
like gold, enameled with all the beauties of virtue, and embellished with all
the ornaments of true Religion; That the sacred solitudes, Sancta and foecunda

the sweet vacancies, the happy leisures, the pleasant retirements, the
plenteous enjoyments, which by the indulgence of God, and the munificence of
worthy men and women, they enjoy as Students, beyond the most of mortals; (whom
either hard labor exhausts, or solicitous care distracts, or penurious
servitude oppresses) may not be abused, to the softer dalliances and idle
entertainments of vicious intemperancies and disorders; when those places were
intended by the pious founders, as hives for Bees, not as (...). Naz. de Bas.
m. and se ipso Athenis commorantibus; omnium semitarum praeter quae ad templa

nests for wasps and drones; receptacles and encouragements for virtuous
industry, religious modesty, prudent integrity, and not for Cretian
Lazy-bellies, cunning sophisters, and pragmatick wits, (which serve only to set
a fairer gloss, and sharper edge on the basest errors, and the most debauched
manners;) which ought, as ever in conscience, to be avoided, so then also in
policy; when there are, as many enemies against the Universities, as there are
evil eyes upon the revenews. Any plea will serve the design of covetous and
unlearned malice, which seeks by pretending the dissolution of manners,
laxation of government, and the shipracks of many ingenuous young men, sent to
the Universities, to justify those daily and desperate calumnies used against
them: That they are not only superfluous, but also noxious; as useless, so
hartfull to the Church and State: Both which, some men will never think
sufficiently blessed, till they have made them, as blind as Beetles, both in
good learning, and true reformed Religion; that so the English Nobility,
Gentry, and ingenuous youth, may either run out to utter barbarity in a short
time, or else fall under the culture of those, who affect to be the grand
Masters, and Catholic Teachers of all good learning, the Jesuits. The gravity
of whose manners, and exactness, both of their Literature, and Discipline
(wherewith they adorn that side, and party, which they are listed to maintain)
is not to be so much imitated, as exceeded by our Universities; which are of
the reformed party the most Illustrious; That so they may redeem themselves
from those jealousies and reproaches, which either just severity or injurious
calumny, is prone to fasten upon them; and so merit both love, honor, and
protection from all, that have any true excellency in this Nation.

19. All worthy minds subscribe to this plea and petition for the Universities.
To this humble request, not only Divines, and Ministers of religious
Mysteries, which tend highly to the temporal and eternal welfare of men's
souls; but all other liberal faculties (which exercise the man more than the
beast; the head and mind, more than the hands and body) will (I presume) most
readily subscribe; Since, neither the learned Students, and honest practisers
of the Common Law, (by which the boundaries of our estates, liberties, honors
and lives are set and preserved under God) Nor those of the Civil Law; (in
which are the suffrages of all Nations; the common sense, the general Rules
and rational Maxims of mankind; whereby all forain treaties,
correspondencies, trafiques, and negotiations in war and peace, with enemies
and friends, are regulated and transacted) Nor yet the conscientious
Physicians, who study to preserve the health, strength, beauty and life of our
bodies: None of these, any more, than the Ministers of the Gospel, can move or
practice rationally, wisely, and conscientiously, in their several callings,
without those principles and foundations of humane learning, which are either
generally preparatory, or peculiarly necessary to their respective faculties;
upon whose stock, first planted, and watered in the Universities, those scions
are commonly graffed, which either come to any flourishing, or good fruit in
Church or State.

And certainly, if we generally dislike, and despise pettifoggers in the Common
Law; mere pragmatiques in the Civil; and quack-salvers in Physic; there is no
reason any sober Christians should desire or like Theologasters, Ventosa
loquacit^^ ut malignus imber sterilitatem magis quam fertilitatem terris inf
rt. Bern.
mere praters and dunces in the great science of Divinity: Ministers of the
Gospel should of all men be least deprived of, or defective in good learning,
in as much as their work is of the highest concernment; nor is it without those
difficulties, which may whet and exercise the most improved abilities, the most
cautious studies, and the most conscientious diligence; All which are necessary
ingredients to make up an able, and worthy Minister: What wise and sober
Christian can think it fit to commit the care of his souls welfare, the
public service of his God, the honor of his Savior, the celebration of holy
mysteries, the means of grace, the comfort of his conscience, and the
conservation of true Religion, together with the peace, order, and honor of
the Church of Christ, while he lives, and when he dies; to commit (I say) all
these to the custody, care, inspection, and managing of such men, whom he could
not with reason, or without great shame in himself, and some from others,
entrust with any public commerce, trade, and negotiation; or with his private
welfare in health, honor, estate, liberty, or life?

Since all divine and humane perfections are in our Lord Jesus Christ's; and
from him every good and perfect gift is derived to the Church; nothing is more
just and grateful, than for Christians to use, improve, and return all those
gifts, and indowments which our humane nature is capable of in this world, to
the glory of God, and the good of mankind; which, when they are sanctified
both in the habit and use, are but preventive of, and preparatory to, those
eternal accomplishments, which our souls expect in heaven; which is that
highest degree of happiness which holy and ^^^ble learning studies to attain.

Nor can any wise man conceit^, how either the h^^hest s^^^me, which we call
Divinity, or those other excellent ones, in Humanity, can ever be levelled to
vulgar practices, and a parity of use among men; Exodus 9.10.
(which will prove an Epidemicall disease, like the sc^^^ and botches of Egypt,
when the ashes were scattered over the land) unless withal there could be a
levelling of men's reasons, w^^, capacities, and industries, as well as of their
callings; or some law of Ostracisme made, by which it shall be forbidden for
any man, to be richer and healthfuller, wiser, and learneder, more holy, or
more religious than another.

But these are Cacotopian fancies, which not the profoundnesse of Plato, but
the shallowness of Thersites, or Dameta^, has laid out to so vile, wicked,
monstrous, and ridiculous forms; that no good Christian, who resolves not to
banish all reason, and true Religion from himself and his posterity, can ever
approve or follow, so, as to wish to be of, or ever to see such a Commonwealth
of Coxcombes and Idiots, who by the want of all good learning both in
Magistrates, and Ministers will soon learn, like wild Ara^^, and Scythians, to
rob, plunder, poison, kill, deceive, and dam^ one another, growing as Mastive
dogs, fiercer by dark keeping: Being justly punished by being given up to their
own hearts lusts, to commit all wickedness with greediness, Romans 1.2^.
for not glorifying God in the high esteem, and holy use of those excellent
gifts, which by good learning, he confers upon humane Nature and societies; of
all which in reference to the good both of Church and State, a gracious heart
is never to seek, how to make a gracious, and thankful use either in himself or
others.

The 5. Cavil. Against Ministers incroachment upon the liberty of men's
judgments and consciences.
BUt there are some, who ashamed to be reckoned among the illiterate crew (who
despise and decry all good learning) and desirous to seem more moderate and
well tempered men, plead; That however Learning well used, may be very
beneficial both to Church and State, both in civil and religious regards; yet
with God there is no Col. 3.11. Mat. 11.25.
acceptance of persons: and in Christ Jesus Greek and Barbarian, the learned
and the Idiots are all one; That God may dispense the beams of his Spirit in
the light of Truth as well as in the heat of Love, how, and where, and to whom
he will, yea, and often does reveal his secret and hidden things, not to the
wise and learned, but to the babes and foolish: Therefore a public liberty at
least, and fair toleration ought to be granted to any men, to opine, to teach,
and accordingly to act, as they are inwardly persuaded and moved: And this
without any such tyrannous restraints, as commonly learned men and Scholars,
Ministers especially, have sought themselves and taught Magistrates, to lay
upon both the judgment, conscience and practice of people, both in their first
education, and after profession; studying to make all things in Religion, or
manners, as bastards, and illegitimate, which have not their Certificate for
their ligitimation; whereas the Spirit of God ought not to be so strict laced,
stinted, and restrained; least of all curbed, and constrained, by any
prohibitions, or impositions on men's judgments and consciences, which in
matters of Religion are only to be drawn with the cords of a man, such as men's
reasons, or Scriptures, or the Spirits persuasion, may afford to every ones
capacity, and not to tie them up by any Creeds, Articles, Catechismes, or
Injunctions of Religion, much less by penal and coercive Statutas, which
(like Persian sheep) carry tails of injurious mulcts and penalties after them,
that are heavier, then their bodies.

Answ. Answ. Of Christian Liberty. Nil tam voluntarium quam religio; cogi non
potest; long^ diversa sunt carnificina est charitas, nec potest veritas cum vi,

persuaded to Religion. Ali^d est certamen pro religione sponte suscipere, aliud
supplicii metu cogi, Eusebius. Eccl. l. 10. cap. 5.
There is no Jewel which Swine delight more to wear in their Snouts, than
this of Liberty; which how well it becomes such sordid and indocible cattle,
those excellent Christians can best judge, who are worthy to enjoy so precious
a token of Christ's love to his Church; as knowing best how to value it, and use
it: I know well, that true Christian Religion ought not to be made a snare, or
an harrow, or a rack, or an heavy yoke, or an Egyptian bondage to men's minds
and Consciences; this were to turn the sweetest vine into a sharp bramble, and
the figtree into a thorn: Nor is there any thing which Christians should be
more tender of (as the 1. Council. Ephesians. cap. ^. (...).
Ephesme Fathers most piously admonish) than their own, and others true
liberties, which Christ has purchased with his precious blood; of which both
Christian Magistrates, and chiefly Ministers, should be most exact keepers, and
conscientious defenders; lest piety prove an oppression; and the bracelets or
ornaments of Religion, become the chains of hypocrisy and manacles of
superstition; binding such heavy burdens on men's consciences, which God has
not imposed wherein the severer heights and tyrannies of men are prone to usurp
upon the ingenuous kingdom and gracious dominion of Christ, where none is a
subject, but he that enjoyes that free Spirit, which David prays to be
established with; Psalm. 51.12.
and none is free but he that willingly takes up Christ's yoke and burden,
Matthew. 11.30.
which are light and easy; but yet not loose or slack. For Jesus Christ having
redeemed us from the greatest slavery, and spiritual bondage, has indeed
invested his Church with the noblest immunities, and governs it by the divinest
liberties; which drawing is by the cords of Gods love to us, set forth in his
Word; and binding us with love to God, and for his sake to one another, by so
much includes all true liberty, Libera est apud Deum servitus, cum non
necessitas sed charitas servit. Aust. Quo sanctior quisque eo solutior. Gibe.
Beata servitus quae dominatienem generat sempiternam. Chrysostom. l. 114.
as it wholly consists of love; whose very life and essence is liberty; It
being impossible to command, consent, or to compel love; which is ((...)) the
most absolute Sovereign of it self, and under no Empire but that of God, who
is love, and perfect liberty: And our Liberty is then truly Christian and
divine (which only is desirable, because only true) when it is such, as
Christ has purchased for, and God has revealed to his Church in his Word;
with which men must seriously advise, and not with their own wanton and
extravagant fancies; if they would be informed what that liberty is, which
only becomes true Christians, who of all men have the least sinful
licentiousness indulged to them.

I find there are no people more vehement boasters of, and sticklers for this,
which they call Christian liberty, than those, who least understand it;
Tertu^lian tells of the Gnostics promiscuous lusts in their Agapae: Extincta
lucerna in promiscuos amplexus taunt. Hinc in Christianos ista infamia.
Scorpia: fo Clem. Alex. (...) 3. So S. Austin of the Gnostics, Manichees and
others who held nisi iniquissima quaque operen^ur, Diaboli vimse non posse
effagere: Hanc esse redemptionem, hanc vitam sine tremore. So Irenaeus of the
Carp^eratians and others, that held nothing morally good or evil; all actions
lawful; only they must believe in Christ. Sela humana opinione negotia mala
and bona esse dicunt. Lib. 1. c. 24.
most abuse it themselves, and are most impatient to allow it to others; if
once they get such power as makes them able to oppress, none are more
insolent, or less tolerating those things, even in Religion, to others, for
which they plead more of conscience, both as to Gods and man's Laws, than these
objectors themselves can do. Nor can any, the most modest plea, for Christian
liberty be heard by those who were formerly so lowdly clamorous for the name,
when indeed they did not either intend, or rightly understand what the thing
is. It will be then a work of Charity; and an effect of that love, which I owe
to these men for Christ's sake, (in whom alone our liberties are sounded, and
conserved) to free them from that captivity of errors, and bondage of
extravagant passions, wherewith they are oppressed and abused even in this
great point of Christian Liberty; Then which as there is nothing, which sinful
men could less deserve, so nor is there any thing they can naturally less
rightly use, or more grossly mistake, and abuse. There is no Jewel, with
which Christ has endowed his Spouse the Church, and every true believer, for
which the Devil has not some counterfeit; nor is there any, by which he cheats
men more easily, and more to his advantage and the Churches detriment, than in
the false figures and resemblances of Christian liberty. Liber est quisquis
probus. Servire deo est bonis operibus and justitiam and libertatem conservare.
Lact.
For as no man naturally is willing to be curbed or restrained from any
impulses of his lusts; so neither can he easily learn that Paradox of true
Christian liberty; which consists in the severest restraints from sin; and the
exactest conformities to the will of God.

You then, O excellent Christians, well understand with me; That as no
creatures, Angels, or men, have that ((...)) self-subsistence; nor that ((...))
self-sufficiency, in and of themselves, which is peculiar to God; so neither
have that ((...)) unresponsiblenesse to any other; nor that ((...))
independence or absolute liberty in their will, which ownes no rule or measure
of its motions, but its ((...)) own good pleasure. For as Angels and men depend
wholly upon God for our nature and being: so we must needs be subordinate to
him, as our Author, and responsible to him, as one wiser, better, juster, and
stronger than our selves: (...). Nissen. Religio est generosissimum animae
vinculum quo ad Deum arctiss^ne ligatur. Aust.
Also our will (wherein our rational, and religious liberties are planted, and
whence they spread or diffuse to all the motions and faculties under its Empire
and command) has its holy limits and bounds set to it by God, both as to the
Supreme end and highest good, which the wise God has proposed in himself; and
also as to those means, by which he has revealed that end to us as attainable,
either in piety, or charity; in private, or public relations.

This constant tendency, or intention to the Supreme end, and those holy
regulations (which in due and lawful means, the wisdom of God has prescribed)
the more any creature, Man or Angel attaines, the more rational, moral and
divine liberty he enjoyes; and he is so much the more freed from those
shackles, (...). Plat. The will is a rational desire or appetite of good.
and impediments, which the chains of darkness and corruption, through
ignorance of mind, and error of understanding, or perverseness of will, or
excess of passion, or violence of temptations, or depravednesse of customs,
or delusion of examples, hamper and bind the soul withal, as the wings of a
bird with birdlime; hindering its regard to the Supreme God, which is the glory
of God; and its exact applying to those means, which are proper for the
attaining and enjoying of it. In the fruition of which the true and eternal
liberty of the soul consists, (as the eyes in seeing most fully, and perfectly,
its most desired object) and which it then enjoyes, Servire dec, est servitus,
propter praecepti obedientiam; and libertas, propter recti licentium. Aust.
Ench. ad Lauren.
when by the wisdom of the Word, and power of of Christ, being every way freed
from sordid, sensual, and sinful intanglements, we only will that which we
know God would have us; and do most willingly, what ever we so will, and know,
as most conformable to his will.

The will of God in his Word, the only rule and measure of man's liberty.
Whose wise, blessed and unerring will, revealed in his holy Word, being rightly
understood, is (now) the only certain and infallible rule; the sole
authentic Patent, which any good Christian will regard, and follow, or allege
and plead in this point of Christian Liberty; either internal, or external;
private, or public; solitary, or sociall; in thoughts, opinions, judgment,
conscience, speech, action, or operation in any kind. Which the further it is
from any error, transport, or licentiousness in a man's self, and from any
cloak of maliciousness against others, 1 Pet. 2.16.
the more it deserves to be counted and called Christian freedom.

(...). Plato. de rep. 1.
As a man freed from the distemper of madness, and rid of his chains, and got
out of Bedlam, has indeed, now, his true liberty, as a man; not to rave and
speak, or do such mad things, as he formerly did in his distraction; but to
do all things, as a sober man, who is master of his wits and understanding;
and consequently under the most strict, yet ingenuous restraints of reason and
religion; the laws of modesty, humanity, honor, civility, charity, and
society; from all which the captivity of his lunacy and madness unhappily freed
him: But now the recovery of his right senses happily restores him to those
duties and observances which become a man and a Christian: It is mercy, which
redeems us from our native bondage to sin and wrath; and which sets us into the
gracious and glorious liberty of the sons of God; Romans 8 21.
which is to know, and love, and serve him, as he would have us: It is a
madness for Christians, (...). Naz. ^r. 16. Id liberri^^um est quod minimee a
summo bono impeditur, Cib.
to think of, covet, or enjoy other Liberty, than such as the Saints in all
ages attained, and such as the blessed Angels ever enjoyed; which the Lord
Jesus himself, our great Liberator, both observed himself, and purchased for
his Church; yea such as God himself is eternally blessed with all; which is to
be good, and to do good without any impediment.

2. Of false liberty and true.
It is the heavyest chain of the Devils Tyranny, and that in full bondage, which
has entered into man's soul; to imagine, that our liberty consists in thinking,
or speaking, or doing, or omitting, what we list; without any regard to God or
man, as (...) men were their own Masters, and had no Lord over them: To fancy,
(...). Plat. de Rep. dia. 10. Quo liberior eo miserior. Ber. (...). Plat.
Liberty is the right governing of our life.
that all restraints internal, of modesty, fear, sense of honor, science of
truth, or conscience of duty, in purity, piety or charity; also external, of
established order, good laws, just power, and government either in things
civil, or sacred, are encroachments upon, and diminutions of Christian
Liberty: The want of neglect of which limiters does infallibly subject us to
the basest, and most infamous servitude.

Whereas, no doubt, the true liberty of any man is to be such, in his inward
habits and propensities; also to do such things most constantly, cheerfully,
and without sinful impediments, which are most proper and advantageous to the
nature and excellency of men: considered both in it self, and its relations;
(...). Plat. Thedo. (...). Plato. Christiani vex est non ad placitum sed ad
licitum.
as it stands in reference to God its Creator, and its neighbor; when a
Christian is free, to know, consider, meditate of, understand, remember, and
believe what ever truths God has revealed to him; yea, further when he is free
to declare, and utter them in such an holy way, which charity, sobriety, order
and gravity allow. It is no freedom for a man to think what he lists, in vain,
erroneous or blasphemous thoughts; or to bolt out and vent all his raw,
undigested, rash and rotten fancies, or irreligious opinions to others He
should set a Psalm. 141.3.
watch over his thoughts, and lips with prayer, modesty, and humility; Trying
and weighing all things, first with himself, by the Word, and the Spirit of
God; or conferring so with others, as may have some savor of reason, and
religion; an holy desire to learn, or teach in a regular, not a rude, insolent,
and imperious way: the next liberty is, to do those duties of piety and
charity, public and private, which God has commanded every one, not only in
general, but in such restrictions of place and calling wherein God has set
them.

It is also true liberty for a Christian upon good grounds to hope for, and
expect that reward and crown, Rev. 2.10. Romans 2.7. (...). Clem. Al.
which God the righteous Judge has promised to those that persevere in well
doing; who in that way are free to enjoy all the comforts, privileges, and
Ordinances, which Christ has instituted in an holy order and most regular way,
for our private, or public good; a Christian is free from the fears,
terrors, judgments, Romans 8.1.
curses and wrath of God; and from the Laws rigor or condemnation, upon his
true faith, and unfaigned repentance: By which graces the beleiver being
ingraffed into Christ, is free from the observations of the ceremonial law,
(which tended to Christ, and ended in him;) Also from the political or civil
Law among the Jews, so far, as variation of times, and necessities of affairs
require for the good of mankind; yet without violating the principles of
equity or charity in them; which are perpetually obligatories upon moral
grounds to all men: From the moral law also a Christian is so far free, as to
its rigor and exactness of personal actual obedience; the want of which in
the least kind is condemnative, in it self; but not so, Romans 7.16.
as we are by faith in Christ; yet are we not freed from the approbation, and
love of the moral law, as it is just and good; nor are we from a constant
endeavor to conform to its holiness, not now as a requisite to the
justification of a sinner, but as a fruit of that in our sanctification, which
from faith and repentance brings forth love; and from love of God a steadfast
purpose, and real endeavor to obey his holy commands in all things; which is
our Evangelicall perfection, and highest freedom in this world; which is not
wholly from sinning, Rom 7.23. Ioh. 8.39. If the Son make you free, then shall
you be free indeed. Romans 6.7.
but from a wilful sinning. Also we are free, as to our purpose and new
principle, from that malice, uncharitableness, from those envies, discontents,
and worldly disorders in any kind, as they have dominion over mere natural
and sinful men: Being further free (that is willing, and content) to suffer
what ever God is pleased to inflict upon us, for punishment, trial, or honor,
in the way of testifying to his truth; we are also free from a principle of
love, to yield ready obedience, as to God, so to man for the Lords sake; Romans
13.5.
what ever man in the name of God, and in Christ's stead requires of us, Heb.
13.17.
in order to Gods glory, the peace, good example, and benefit of others, in any
society, either as men or Christians.

3. The liberty of Superiors and Inferiors.
The grounds and rules of which external obedientaill freedom in civil and
Church societies, the Lord has by general precepts and directions expressed
in his Word: leaving the particular circumstantiating, enacting, and applying
of those generals to that liberty of wisdom, piety, and charity, which ought
to be owned by inferiors, and exercised by superiors, as governors in Church
or State; This Politic liberty admits of diverse variations according to
several states, times, emergencies and occasions, to which Christians, as men,
are subject in this world, wherein honest freedom may be used by such laws and
restraints, as shall seem best for the public welfare, to those in whom the
power of giving laws to others does reside; even in that just power and
authority which God has given to some over others, to rule them; to allow no
such gubernative liberty to any men, is to deny that indulgence and authority
which God has granted, both to Christian Magistrates, and to Ministers, even
to restrain in many things the private liberty of others, for the public good
and order of the community; nor may any man seditiously and factiously plead,
or contend for his private liberty of speeches, or actions, further than
consists with the peace, order, safety, and welfare of the public; according
to what is by due authority permitted, or forbidden: and however private
thoughts of discontent, mutiny, rebellion, and cursing others, Eccles. 10.20.
Nam scelus intra se ^ac^tum qui cogitar ^^tum, Facti c^imen habet. Jur. 1 Pet.
2.13.20. 1 Pet. 2.16. Romans 13.5. (...), You must needs be subject, not only
for wrath, but also for conscience sake. Christian liberty and divine necessity
may stand together; yea they are inseparable.
fall not under humane cognizance and judicature; yet they as not free, as to
the tribunal of God in a man's own conscience. Neither may public Authority,
(which has freedom to rule; that is, to command, enjoin and exact external
obedience of others;) Nor may private liberty, (which is free to obey in the
Lord the commands of Superiors, or else patiently to abide their censure;)
neither the one, nor the other may turn this liberty to a cloak of
maliciousness or licentiousness; Not the one to tyranny and oppression;
beyond what piety, equity, order, and charity require; nor the other to make it
any ground or occasion for factious and seditious perturbings of the public
order and peace: Nor may any party of men (though never so godly, and well
affected) being in no place or authority, in Church or State, enabling them,
carry on any design (though in its abstract consideration it be better, than
what at present may be) by any violent, irregular and disorderly ways, which
are utterly unwarrantable in themselves, and no fruit of that Christian
liberty, which Christ has purchased for us; either inwardly, as to God and our
consciences; or outwardly, as to Society and public relations of men and
Christians to one another; where every relation imports a duty; and every duty
has its bounds; beyond which, Relationes civiles mutuis offer ^is ^igann^ Reg.
Iur. Illud decitum quod logibus definitum, Reg. jur.
is not true and virtuous liberty, but inordinatenesse and excess.

Yea and in some cases of severer restraints, Prudenter aliquando and lici^a

by which Governors do indeed trench upon those rational or religious
liberties, which God has allowed to men and Christians; yet in these cases a
true Christian only wraps himself up in that liberty of patience, which
knows, when and how to suffer without injury to the public tranquillity, or
to his private peace of conscience: still keeping a 1 Pet. 3.4.

tyrant, usurper, and waster of the true liberty of every man and Christian.

It is then as far from Christian liberty, 4. Devils Liberty.
as sickness is from health, madness or drunkenness from sobriety,
rottenness from beauty, or putrefaction from perfection, for any Christian to
believe what he lists, though it be a lie; or to disbeleeve and deny it,
Libertas omni servitute servilior. Ber. Ep. 47.
though it be a truth of God; to take up what opinions and ways of religion he
most fancies; and to refuse, what ever he please to disaffect, upon light,
popular and untryed grounds; or openly to speak and dispute what ever he lists,
(...). Cl. Al. (...). 2.
and publicly to act, according as his private persuasions, passions, lusts,
or, interests, or other men's, tempt and carry him; wherein neither right
reason, nor common order, nor public peace, nor conscience of duty, nor 1
Pet. 2.17.
reverence of men, nor fear of God, have any such serious, and holy ties upon
men, as are necessary for the common good; In which regard private Christians
are never so free, as to have no yoke of Christ upon them; Haretica

autoritate, sine disciplina; cujus penes nos curam lenocinium vocant: pacem cum

praes. ad. Hae. c. 41.
no exercise of patience, selfdenyall, mortification, meekness, charity,
modesty, and sobriety, together with that comeliness and decorum, which
beseemes Religion and a Christian spirit; beyond which the most transporting
zeal may not expatiate: For that is no other than such freedom, as water
enjoyes, when it overbears and overflowes all its banks and bounds; or as fire
seizing on the whole house; Such as drunken men in their roarings, and mad men
in their ravings contend for; such as wild beasts, and untamed Monsters
struggle for; yea such, as the envious and malicious devils affect, and are
most impatient not to enjoy: In whose nostrils and jaws the mighty Ezekiel. 38.4.
Esa. 37.29.
wisdom and goodness of God (who is Potentissimum and liberrimum agens the
fountain of all true rational, moral, religious and divine freedom) has his
hook of power, and bridle of terror: not of love; Such are those liberties,
which those ( As St. John called Corinthus, who was of this sect of Libertines,

some impudent Libertines and dissolute wretches now (as of old) aim at, who
have cast off all sense of justice, order, shame, and humanity, while they
clamor and act for liberty; that is, that their blasphemies, profanenesses,
impudicities, scurrilities, impudencies, and violences against all public
civil peace, as well as against all religion, order, and Ministry of the
Church of England, may be tolerated if not countenanced; notwithstanding they
profess to hold with us some common grounds of Christian Religion, and stand
responsible to civil duties and relations.

True Christians should be as fearful to enjoy the devils freedom, (not which
he has, but which he desires; that is, to will, and to do whatever he lists;)
And as they should be zealous for their own true, holy, and humble liberties,
which lead them quietly to do or suffer Gods will, in Gods way; so they should
be tender of encroaching upon those public liberties, which are by right
reason, order and Scripture granted to some men, as Magistrates and Ministers
for the general good of Christians. Men must not so please themselves in any
thing they fancy of liberty, as to injure others; No man's liberty may be
another injury. Nullius emolumentum jure nescitur exalterius damno and
injuria. Reg. Iur.
since no man's right can consist in the detriment, or damage of another rights
or dues. As then no man rationally can think it a liberty denied him, when he
is forbid upon idle visits, to go to infected houses; or being infected with
the plague, to go among others that are sound; or to drink poison and propine
it to others; no more can any Christian religiously plead for a liberty to
broach, and publish to others any opinion he pleases; or to invade any place
and office, he has a mind to; or to disturb others in their duties and power;
or to contemn with public insolence; or violently to innovate against
established laws and orders in Church or State: much less has he any freedom
openly to blaspheme or disturb that religion, and way of devotion, wherein
sober and good Christians worship God by that authority and order, which is
settled in public, according to their consciences and best judgments.

Here, neither Christian Magistrates, 5. True Liberty and good government in
Church and State agree well together.
nor Ministers are to regard such pleas for private Liberties, as overthrow the
public order and peace; nor are they to regard those clamours against them
and the Laws, as persecuting, when they do but oppose and restrain such
pernicious exorbitancies; nor are they in this infringers of the peoples
freedom, but preservers of Liberties, which are bound up only in the laws;
nor are they oppressors of others men's consciences, but dischargers of their
own duties, Leges sunt corporis politici nervi, sine quibus luxata and infirma
fient omnia membra. Verul.
and consciences, which they bear to Gods glory, and the public good; whereto
as they stand highly related by their place and power, so they are highly
accountable to God for them: And, if they should suffer arrogant ignorance to
come to its full rudeness, and extent, tumultuary numbers and brutish power
will soon make good private presumptions; and cover over the most impotent
lusts, Lex est libertatis conservatrix, civitatis anima. Mars. Fic. Est recte
ag^ndi norma. Dei vox. Hominum Lux. H. Steph.

liberty: That is, that they may do what they list; and no man else, what they

which, if not suppressed by an orderly and just severity, (which is the
greatest charity to the publiq^e) they grow from the lesser fly blowings of
secret opinions, private presumptions, and proud fancies, to become filthy
creepers and noxious flyers abroad; (as the Frogs, Flies and Locusts of Egypt)
to the great infection, and molestation of others; defiling and defacing all
things, that are esteemed of public religious order, beauty, peace, holiness
and true liberty.

It is often too late discerned (after unhappy indulgences and cruel
tendernesses in this kind) by all sober Christians; That it is not more the
happiness of mankind, Job. 38.11. Psalm. 104.9.
to have the Se^ restrained by the bounds, which God in his wonderful
providence has set to it, that it return not again to cover the earth; than
this is, that he has established by the light of Reason, and the commands of
his written Word the ordinances of Ministry and Magistracy among Christian men;

by which to preserve true Christian liberty in its sphere and due bounds of
just laws, of sound doctrine, true believing, well doing, orderly obeying, and
comely suffering; and withal, to keep out those enormous extravagancies which
seek to overthrow both Magistracy and Ministry; which are the great
conservators of Christians, in all honest and just freedoms; without which no
men should enjoy any, while violent lusts and errors make way (by levelling
all things) for their thick, and muddy inundations; which are the devils

reformed Religion; that so it might at once be both ashamed of it self, and

injurious and uncomely; even so far as to abstain from the very appearance of
evil; not only in the conscience of a Christian, but even in the fight of
heathens; Such as not only Religion, but common reason condemned. Nor did the
Christians when multiplied to numbers, and filling all places in the Empire,
challenge by any force any liberty of Religion beyond what they had by civil
favor of Magistrates; or that of their prayers, tears and patience, when
persecuted and denied civil liberties; as Tertullian tells in his apology: So
wary they were of abusing their liberty to any insolency, offense, injury, 2
Cor. 10.32.
or indignity against any private person; much more against a public and
common good of either Church or State; the preservation of which, as to the
general interests of societies, wherein thousands are concerned, both in their
souls and bodies welfare, is far more to be regarded, by wise, godly, and
charitable men; than any private pleas, or pretensions for Christian liberty;
especially when they look with an evil eye, and lift up an offensive hand
against public order, government, duties and institution: wherein are bound
up, and contained that peace, piety, and religion which is enjoyed or professed
by any Christians.

which are contrary to the rules and ends of right oecononicall or military
discipline; which intends the common safety and welfare of families and Armies;
So, neither may Christian Religion be thought to bring forth, or be forced to
maintain, that Liberty (as a legitimate issue of conscience) in its holy
profession, and orderly ministrations; Turbulenta haereticorum audacia. Aust.
which is in all civil or secular dispensations esteemed, rejected and
punished as a turbulent and seditious bastard: And which, being but as Ishmael
the son of a bondwoman, is prone to mock and abuse the Isaac of true liberty,
Genesis 21.9.
which is the son of promise, and is no way fit to be the heir, or to divide
the Inheritance of Christian freedom; which is only the portion of holy,
humble, sober, and orderly Christians; for while some boast of, and challenge
to themselves, and promise to others this false and spurious Liberty, they are
still servants to their lusts, 2 Pet. 2.19.
and in bondage to their corruptions; impatient of any restraints, but those of
their own wills, interests and fancies; yea and this Bastard Liberty, Iud. 9.5.
like the one base son of Gideon (Abimel^ch) when once it can but get power,
makes no conscience to destroy all the lawful heirs of true religious liberty,
which are possessed of truth, peace, charity, order, good government in any
Church: yea and all civil justice too, and properties of goods and estates;
which are presently thought by licentious men, in consistent with their
freedom, when once their powerful lusts have set upon the heads of their
unruly designs, the Crown and title of Christian Liberty. Which disguise the

that there is no error, no lust, no sin, no blasphemy, no villainy, nor
deformity in any men's opinions or practices so horrid, which he does not seek
to color over, or to cover with the pain^ and palliatings of Christian liberty.

Which being a pure and spotless Virgin, (the highest beauty which a Christian
can here be enamored of, and which he courts with all modesty, purity, and
respect on earth, hoping to have the full fruition of it in heaven) disdains
above all things to be abused by those bold and filthy ravishers, who like the
inordinate monsters of Gibeah, Judge. 19.
will never think their licentious lusts satisfied, until they have killed the
Levites concubine: Destroying indeed all true Christian liberty (which is
preserved only by good order and government both in the Church and State)
while they prostitute truths, duties, institutions, Ministry, and Magistracy to
all manner of insolences and confusion; Assistentem in omni munditia Angelum
dicebant and inv^c^bant. Hanc esse aiebam perfectam operatiorem sine tremore ri
tales abire operationes quas ne nominare quidem fas est. Irenae. l. 1. cap. 35.
de Cainitis, J^daitis, Ophitis.
as if Christians were never free enough, till they were without all sense of
sin and shame; till they neither feared God, nor reverenced man; till they had
broken all the bands of civil justice, and cast away the cords of all
religious discipline from them; as the Cainites, Judaites, Ophites, Adamites,
and others of old.

Which most inordinate liberty is no more to be enjoyed or desired by any good
Christian, than that of the Demoniack: who being often bound with chains and
fetters, Luke 8.29.
yet brake them all, and was driven of the Devil into deserts, among the
graves, often dashing him against the stones, and casting him into fire and
water. Such will be the sad fate of every Christian Church and State, which
either affects, or tolerates any such impious, fanatic, unlawful, and unholy
liberties; contrary to that purity, equity, order and decency; which is
necessary to that religion which they profess as Christian. Therefore no
wonder if the Lord by his word, and his true Ministers daily rebukes this
unclean spirit; and seeks to cast out of this Church such an untamable Devil,
which has already got too much possession in many men's minds; Act. 19.27.
who are prone to deifie every Diana, as an image come down from heaven, if it
be but set up in the silvershrine of this popular goddess Liberty; which of
all puppetly Idols lately consecrated to vulgar adoration, I can least of all
Idolize: as that, which I see to have least of divinity or humanity in it:
either as to piety, equity, purity, or charity.

Yet is no man a more unfeigned servant and votary of that true and divine
Liberty, which becomes Christians; which preserves truth, peace, order, and
holiness among men, both in private and public regards, both in Church and
State; and in this I wish all men my rivalls in the ambition and sharers, with
me in the fruition; which will then be most, when we get our hearts most freed
from that heavy bondage, wherewith error, pride, passion, self-seeking, and
the like cruel taskmasters (under the great oppressing Pharaoh, Aegyptiaca
est illa servitus sub jugo Pharaonis, Diaboli: fiunt lutea opera; terrena,

the Devil) do seek to enslave the souls, and consciences of men; by so much
the baser slavery, by how much they fancy their slavery to be liberty: their
freedom to sin, to be that freedom from sin, which Christ has purchased:
which dangerous mistake makes them love their bondage; to bore their ears; and
to be most offended with those, who seek to show them their desperate errors
and divellish thraldom; which is the greatest severity of divine vengeance in
this world upon men, by giving them over to Satan, or up to their own hearts
lusts.

Yet this false and damnable liberty is by some men earnestly contended for,
and imperiously claimed in the way of public toleration; 7 Some men's impudent
demand of an intolerable toleration.
that they, or any men, may profess, as to Religion, what they list; being
prone through pride and ignorance, to think that no opinion they hold, or
practice they do, is irreligious, profane, blasphemous, or intolerable; nor
ought by any just severity or penalty be restrained, or punished:

Whereas Christians truly blessed with tender Consciences, and meekness of
wisdom, are most willing to be kept within Christ's bounds; and loathest to
take any liberty, either in opinion or manners, beyond what in the truth of the
Word, or in charity to the public peace, and order is permitted: Humble
knowledge makes Christians most tractable; yea and thankful to those, either
Ministers or Magistrates, whose love and fidelity to them, will least tolerate
any error, or sin in them, without reproof, and just restraint.

Others, whom ignorance makes proud, and pride erroneous, and both unruly; are
ready to esteem all they hold or vent or dare to act, (especially under color
of religion, for in civil affairs they are afraid of the sword) to be so
commendable, at least tolerable, that they merit, Tunc ei (pl^renetico)
utilissimus and misericordissimus, cum et adver^issim^s and molestissimus
videtur. Aust. Ep 48. de coere. Haeret.
if not concurrence and approbation from all men, yet at least co^nivence, and
toleration; nor may they be touched, or curbed by any authority in Church or
State, (be their extravagancies never so pernicious and blasphemous) but
presently they make huge outcryes of persecution; as if all were persecutors,
who helped to ^^inde a mad man; or to put a roaring drunkard into the cage;
which measure of healing them, is best both for them, and for others too; and
is not to be used to any, but those that are truly such disorderly and
distempered spirits.

I conceive it most clear and certain both in right Reason and true Religion,
that the prudence, piety, and charity of Governors in Church and State ought to
move in that middleway, between tolerating all differences, and none, in
matters of Religion; wherein men are variously to be considered, according to
that profession which they own, and make of Religion; Sure none are to be
tolerated in blaspheming, or insolencing that religion, which is established by
public consent or laws, (...). Romans 2.1. Tit. 3.11.
and which they profess in common with others; being in this self-condemned
and without excuse; Nor are any of a different belief, to what is established,
to be tolerated in giving any factious and seditious scandals, against that
Religion, which is by the wisdom, and piety of any Nation, and Church there
settled, as sacred; being always presumed, that it is judged the truest and
best: for no men can be supposed to bind themselves, and their posterity to
any religion, which they think false.

Two ways of just restraints in the Church.
There are two ways of coercive power (established by God) over men, in matters
of religion, either of the Word by Ecclesiastical admonitions, reproves and
censures; which only reach those in matters of error, 1 Timothy 5.20. Tit. 2.15.
Tit. 3.10. 1 Cor. 5.12.
or scandal, that are under the same form, belief, and profession of Religion,
(for these only do consider them): And where this discipline is (as in
primitive times it was) rightly dispensed with gravity, wisdom, charity, and
due solemnity, by wise and worthy men; it carries a great weight with it, being
in the name and authority of Jesus Christ, 1. By Church discipline.
and is of excellent use to the well being of the Church of Christ, to preserve
the honor of Religion, and credit of Christianity. Nor is any thing of extern
order, and policy, more worthy to be seriously considered and restored by
Christians; which can never be done, till the right government of the Church be
first settled; nor can this now be easily done, without the favor and
concurrent authority of the Christian Magistrate; so far has licentious
contempt, and insolency prevailed against all ancient order, government, and
discipline in the Church; even by the Libertinism of such, as would most be
counted Christians. And 2. Magist^atick power.
2. A second way of animadversion or restraint of public disorders in
Religion, is by the power of the sword in the hand of the Christian Magistrate;
who is to regard not only the civil peace of subjects, but also that trust
which lies on him, to take care for their religious interests, and their souls
welfare, Qu^^to plus potes interrena republica, tanto plus imperdeas ^^lesti
civitati. Aust. Ep. c. 24.
that they may be taught and preserved in the right way of knowing and serving
God: The happy ^ondition of any Christians is, when both these powers are
wisely and sweetly twisted together; so as the Ministry directs the Magistracy
by the Word; and the Magistracy assists the Ministry by the sword: where the
censures of the Church act by charity, and the censures of the Magistrate by a
just severity; yet so, as neither love to the offender; nor dislike of the
offense be wanting: That all be done to the edification, not to the destruction
of the Church, or of any member of it, so far as its welfare is consistent
with the public.

Neither civil, nor Church power among Christians should be as a sharp and
hard rock, dashing presently all in pieces, that touch or strike at it in the
least kind, though never so modestly differing from the received Religion; nor
yet ought they to be as pillowes and sponges, yielding so soft a reception to
every new opinion and practice, as to invite all errors, and novelties to a
recumbency, or rest in their bosom; A Church, or Christian State, will soon be
full of all noisome vermin, if they allow as a work of charity and liberty,
every sordid error, and beggarly opinion, publicly to lodge, and nestle
under their roof; yea and to contend for place, and crowd out that Religion
which is established: Moderation differs from gross toleration.
Christian Magistrates should neither use the sharp rasor or two edged sword of
the Spanish Inquisition; which forces with terror, either to deny, what men
hold for truth; or to profess which that, they hold not; nor yet should they
content themselves with the wooden daggers of Amsterdam; where civil authority
excuses its lukewarmnesse, and gilds over its tolerancy of any Religion, with
the benefit of trade and commerce. I do not think it Christian to extirpate
Jews or Turks, much less any of Christian profession; but I think it both
wisdom and charity, first, to endeavor by all fair means to convince all; And
secondly, 2 Timothy 2.24.
to restrain by just penalties, all those under civil subjection, (however of
a different religion) from saying, or doing any thing publicly scandalous to,
and derogating from the honor, peace and order of that Religion, which is
esteemed, and therefore settled, as the best and truest: As civil seditions and
treasons are intolerable, so are religions; nor are such endeavors venial,
which by printing blasphemous books and divellish Libels seek to revive old
rotten errors and heresies; or to bring public reproach, and scorn upon the
reformed Christian Religion in this Church: no not although those infamous
pamphlets were attended with learned confutations; since it is safer to forbid
the use of poisons to the incautious people, than to permit them to drink them
up, upon confidence of the virtue, which may be in the antidotes applied; The
nature of man is proner to imbibe noxious things, then to egest them: It is a
tempting of God to tolerate evils and errors (which we may prevent) only upon
confidence of the remedies we can apply. This is more like Mountebanks, than
like good Magistrates or Ministers.

Since then, neither in right reason, and true policy of State, it is either
becoming or safe, for Christian Magistrates, to have no acknowledgment of any
face of Religion, Christians must not be Scepticks in Religion. Ephesians. 4.14.
so far among their people and subjects as to establish, own and command it;
nor is it any piety, for Christians, to be always scepticks in Religion; ever
unsatisfied, and unresolved, and unestablished in matters of Gods worship, and
man's salvation, still ravelling the very grounds of Religion with endless
cavils and needless disputes. Since the Word of God is near and open to direct
all men in the ways of God; and since what is necessary to be believed and
obeyed in truth and holiness, is of all parts in Scripture most plain and
easy; No doubt, but Christian Magistrates are highly bound in Conscience to
God, and in charity to the good of their subjects, (to whom they must do more
good, then they are desired to do by the Vulgar) to establish those things, as
to the extern order, Ministry, form and profession of Religion, both in
doctrine and duties, which they shall in their conscience judge and conclude,
upon the best advice of learned and godly men, to be most agreeable to the will
of God, as most clearly grounded on the Word in the general tenor and analogy
of it; and as most fundamentally necessary to be believed and obeyed by all
Christians; whereto the Catholic belief and practice of all Churches (more or
less agreeing) gives a great light and direction. Christians must not be
always tossing to and fro in religion, but come to an Anchor of fixation, as
to the public profession; else there will hardly be any civil peace
preserved among men: who least endure, and soonest quarrel upon differences in
Religion, each being prone to value his own, and contemn another.

Nulla res effic^cius homines regit quam religio. Curt. l. 4.
These things of public piety thus once settled by Scripture upon good advice,
ought by all swasive, rational and religious means to be made known by the
public Ministry to the people; for so Christ has ordained, and the Church
always observed; to which Ministry (which I have proved to be of Gods
institution, Separatim nemo habessit Deos, neve novos: Tul. de leg. Romans
and so most worthy of man's best favor and encouragement) public and orderly
attendance, for time, place, and manner ought to be enjoined upon all under
that power, for their necessary catechi- and instruction; And this with some
penalties inflicted upon idle, wilful and presumptuous neglects; Nihil ita
facit ad dissidium ac de Deo dissensio. Naz. orat. 8. Solos credit habendos
Quisque Deos quos ipse colit. Iuv. Sat. 15. Aegypti cum diversi cultus De^^
habe^ant, mutuis bellis se imp^tebant. Dio. l. 42.
when no ground of conscience, or other persuasion or reason is produced by
those, that are not yet of years of discretion: if any of riper years and sober
understanding plead a dissent, they ought in all charity and humanity be dealt
with, by religious reasonings, and meekness of wisdom; if so be they may so
be brought to the knowledge of the truth: 2 Timothy 1.25.
But if either weakness of capacity, or wilfulness and obstinacy suffer them
not to be convinced, What toleration becomes Christians.
and so to conform to the public profession of Religion, I do not think,
that by force, and severities of punishment, they ought to be compelled to
profess, or to do, that in Religion, of which they declare an unsatisfaction
in judgment; yet may they, both in justice, and charity, be so tied to their
good behavior, that they shall not, under great penalties, either rudely
speak, write, or act against; or openly blaspheme, profane, and disturb; or
contradict and contemn the Religion publicly professed, and established.

And however the welfare of this public is not so concerned, in what men
privately hold, as to their judgment and opinion, (thoughts being as the
Embryos of another freer world; yet when they come to be brought forth to
public notice in word or deed, they justly fall under the care, Facientis
culpant obtiner, qui quod poterit corrigere negligeremendare. Reg. Iur.
and censure both of the Magistrate to restrain them, as relating to the good
of community; and of the Minister to reprove them, as his duty and authority is
in the Church.

If in lesser things, which are but the lace and fringe of the holy vestment,
the verge and Suburbs of Religion established, Christians do so dispute and
differ, Ordo Evangelici Ministerii est cardo Christianae religionis. Gerard.
Toll Ministerium, and toll Christum; is one of the devils politic maxims.
as not to trench upon fundamental truths, neither blaspheming the Majesty of
God, or of the Lord Jesus Christ, or of the blessed Spirit; or the authority of
the holy Scriptures; nor breaking the bounds of clear morals; nor violating the
order of the holy Ministry of Christ's Church, which is the very hinge of all
Christian Religion; nor yet wantonly dissolving that bond of Christian
communion in point of extern order, peace, and comely administrations of holy
things: other private differences and dissentings, no doubt, may be fairly
tolerated, as exercises of charity, and disquisitions of truth; wherein yet,
even the lesser, as well as greater differences, (which arise in Religion) are
far better to be publicly and solemnly considered of, prudently and peaceably
composed, (if possible) than negligently, and carelessly tolerated; as wounds
and issues are better healed with speed, than tented to continued Ulcers, and
Fistulas.

I am confident, wise, humble and charitable Christians, 8. The mean between
Tyranny and Toleration.
in public eminency of power, and piety, would not find it so hard a matter
(as it has been made, through roughness of men's passions, and
intractablenesse of their spirits, raised chiefly by other interests, carried
on, than that of Christ, true Religion, and poor people souls) if they would
set to it in Gods name, to reconcile the many and greatest religious
differences, which are among both Christian and reformed Churches; if they
would fairly separate, what things are moral, clear and necessary in Religion,
from what are but prudentiall, decent or convenient; and remove from both
these, what ever is passionate, popular and superfluous, in any way, which weak
men call, and count Religion; if the many headed Hydra of men's lusts, passions,
and secular ends were once cut off, so that no sacrilege, or covetousness, or
ambition, or popularity, or revenge should sour, and leaven reformation; or
obstruct any harmony and reconciliation; sure the work would not be so
Herculean, but that sober Christians might be easily satisfied, and fairly lay
down their uncharitable censures, and damning distances.

Instances in Church Government.
It is easy to instance, in that one point of Church government, as to the
extern form; what unpassionate stander by sees not, but it might easily have
been composed, in a way, full of order, counsel and fraternall consent, so
that neither Bishops as fathers, nor Presbyters as brethren, nor people as sons
of the Church, should have had any cause to have complained, ubi metus in deum,
ibi gravitas honesta, and diligentia attonita, and cura solicita, and adlectio
explorata, and communicatio deliberata, and promotio emerita, and subjectio
religiosa, and apparitio devota, and prof^ssio modesta, and Ecclesia unita, and
Dei omnia. Tertul. ad Haer. c. 43.
or envyed, or differed? So in the election, trial, and ordination of
Ministers, also in the use, and power of the keys, and exercise of Church
discipline; who in reason sees not; that, as these things concern the good of
all degrees of the faithful in the Church, so they might (as in St. Cyprian's
and all primitive times) have beeen carried on in so sweet an order, and
accord, as should have pleased and profited all; both the Ordainers and the
ordained; with those, for whose sakes Ministers are ordained? So in the great
and sacred administration of the mysterious, and venerable Sacraments,
especially that of the Lords Supper; which concerns most Christians of years:
how happily, and easily might competent knowledge, an holy profession of it,
and an unblameable conversation be carried on, by both pastors and people, with
Christian order, care and charity; so as to have satisfied all those, who make
not Religion a matter of gain, revenge, State policy, or faction; but of
conscience and duty, both to God, and their neighbor, Secular interests the
pests of the Church.
and their own souls? which was the harmonious way of primitive Christians in
persecution, when no State factions troubled the purer streams of that
doctrine, government, and discipline which the Churches had received, from the
divine fountains; and had preserved sweet amidst the bitter streams, and great
storms of persecution; when no interest was on foot among Christians but that
of Christ's, to save souls; which did easily keep together in humble, and
honest hearts, piety, and humanity; zeal, and meekness; men's understandings,
and affections; constancy in fundamental truths, and tolerancy in lesser
differences; That Truth and Peace, Order and Unity might kiss each other, and
as twins live together, the foundations remain unviolable, while the
superstructures might be varied as much as hay and stubble are from gold and
silver; 1 Cor. 3.12.
That the faith of Christians might not serve to begin or nourish feuds, nor
Christians, (who are as lines drawn from several points of saiths
circumference, yet to the same center Christ Jesus) might ever cross and
thwart one another, to the breach of charity: but still keep the unity of the
Spirit, in the bond of peace: The same Faith invariable, Ephesians. 4.3.
as once delivered to the Saints; yet with those latitudes of private charity,
which Gods indulgence had allowed to true wisdom, and which an inoffensive
liberty grants in many things to sober Christians.

I do not despair, but that such blood may one day yet run in the veins of
this Church of England, (which is now almost faint and swooning by the loss of
much blood, which civil wars and secular interests have let out) which may
recover it to strength and beauty, both in doctrine and discipline: Yet will it
never be the honor of those men to effect it, who trust only to military
force; or intend, either to set up any one violent saction, or a loose
toleration in religion. It will be little less indeed than a miracle of divine
mercy and Christian moderation; which must recover the spirit and life, the
purity and peace of this Church.

In the best settled Church, or State Christian, 9. An excellent way for unity
and peace in the Church.
I conceive it were a happy and most convenient way for calming, and composing
all differences rising in Religion, to have (as the Jews had their Sanhedrin or
great Assembly) if we in England had some settled Synod or solemn Convocation,
of pious, grave and learned men; before whom all opinions arising to any
difference, Twice a year Synods were in primitive times appointed, where the
Bishops and other chief Fathers of the Church met to consider of Doctrines and
disputes in religion: (...). Can. Apoc. 36. Which undoubtedly show the practice
and mind of the primitive times soon after the Apostles.
from what is once settled, should be debated publicly; deliberated of
seriously, and charitably composed; if not definitively determined; that so the
main truths may be preserved unshaken, which concern faith and holiness, on
which grounds peace and charity in every Church ought to be continued; So that
none under great penalty should vent any doctrine in public by preaching or
printing, different from the received and established way, before he had
acquainted that Consistory or Council with it, and had from them received
approbation; so that no man should be punishable for his error, what ever he
produced before them; but might either Vtili terrori doctrina salutaris
adjungatur. Aust. Et de^^ ipse nos s^^oite d^ce^ and sal^b^i t^r ^^rr^^.
receive satisfaction from them; or only this charge and restraint, that he
keep his opinion to himself, till God show him the truth; and that he presume
not to divulge it, save only in private conference to others, and that in a
modest and peaceable manner.

In matters of judgment and opinion, (where no man is accountable for more
than he can understand, and upon grounds of right reasoning either believe or
know) much prudence, tenderness and charity is to be used; which will easily
distinguish between honest simplicity, privately dissenting, upon plausible
grounds; or harmlesly erring, without design; and that turbulent pertinacy, by
which pride is resolved as a dry nurse to bring up by hand, at the charge and
trouble of others, every novell and spurious opinion, which an adulterous or
wanton fancy lists to bring forth, though there be no milk for it in the
breasts of Reason, or Scripture rightly understood. The first is as Joseph out
of his way, wandering and desiring to be directed; whom it is charity to reduce
to the right way. The second is like sturdy Vagabonds, who are never out of
their way; but seek to seduce others that they may rob or murder them; these
ought to be justly punished and restrained. The first is as cold water, which
may dabble and disorder one that falls into it; yea and may drown him too; but
the other is as falling into scalding hot water; which pride soon boyles up to
malice, and both to public trouble; unless it be thus wisely prevented,
before it have, like fire, a public vent: for commonly pertinacy of men
arises more from the love of credit and applause, which they think they have
got, or may lose; or from some other advantage they aim at; than barely from
any esteem they have of the opinions, wherein they innovate; which brats of
men's brains not their beauty, but their propriety and relation commends to an
eager maintaining; Mallent semper errare quam semel errasse videri.
which in a public debate by wise and impartial men, of high credit and
reputation for their learning, gravity, and integrity, will be so blasted, that
they will hardly ever after thrive or spread.

This, or the like care of Christian Magistrates, by way of rational

least suspicion of tyranny; nor may wise, and good men startle at the name and

Although the man in every one is to be treated humanely, and the Christian
Christianly, with all reason, and charity; (because the Creator is to be
reverenced in every creature, and Christ in every Christian) yet the Beast or
Devil (which may be even in regener^ted men) must be used accordingly; that
the man may be preserved, though the other be restrained; as we do, without
injury, to those that are mad, or daemoniack; to whom if sober men should
allow, what liberty they affect, cry out and strive for; it were to proclaim
themselves to all the world the madder of the two. Salute reparata tanto

forfeit their private liberty to the public discretion and power, who will
not, or cannot use it, but to the public detriment, and the injury of others;
which to prevent or hinder is the highest work of charity. None but sons of
Belial, that is, of such as will not endure the yoke in Religion, either in
piety, purity, or charity, nor suffer others to enjoy the benefit of it in
peace and order, can desire such a Ad^o libere esse volunt ut nec Deunt habere
vel^^t Dominum. Aust.
freedom, as will not endure the Lord for their God, nor man for their
Governor; who seek to break the staves of beauty and of bonds on their
Shepherds heads; or to wrest the keys out of their hands; who like wild asses
would be left to feed in the wilderness to their own barren fancies, and to
snuff up the wind of their own or others vain opinions, till they are
starved, and destroyed, rather than be kept in good pasture, with due limits.

There is a damnable and damning Liberty, a Toleration, which the Devils would
enjoy; who would soon destroy all things, on which is any Image of the
Creators glory; if the sharp curb and weighty chains of Gods omnipotency, were
not upon them, both immediately, and mediately, through that wisdom, care,
courage, and authority, which he gives to Christian Magistrates and Ministers,
to resist, and to bind up Satan. If they then that are thus furnished by God,
with just power in Church and State, should leave the things of God in matters
of Religion (as outwardly professed) to such liberties, that all men may run
which ways they please, of ignorance, error, atheism, profaneness,
blasphemy, being seduced, and seducing others; if they take no care, that
younger people be catechized, and others duly attend the public duties of
that religion, which is established, and which they still profess; Vbi non est
veritas, merito and talis est disciplina. Ter.

practice, which he calls Conscience, without giving any account of Reason or

of the Devils, and that innate folly, vanity, and madness which is in men's
hearts, to the ruin of simple multitudes; who cannot sin, or miscarry
eternally, in such sinful liberties, irreligious and tolerations, but at the
cost and charge of the Magistrates souls; if they be Christian, and are
persuaded of the truth of that Religion; as we read the master became a
trespasser, or murderer, and was put to death, who knowingly suffered his
petulant Ox to enjoy such a liberty, Exodus 21.29.
as ended in the damage, or destruction of his neighbors goods, or life.

10. Such Toleration is but a subtle persecution.
A toleration of any thing as to public profession among Christians under the
notion of Christian liberty, is but the devils finest, and subtillest way of
persecution; for he is as sure to gain by such indulgences, as weeds do, by
the husbandmans, or Gardners negligence or lothnesse to pluck them up, for fear
of hurting the corn or good plants; which when they are fully discerned to be
but weeds, as they are not possibly to be pulled up by man's hand, as to the
private errors and hypocrisies of men's hearts, which are to be left to the
great Judge and Searcher of hearts; so nor may they rashly be pulled up by
every one, that sees them, lest injury be done to the good seed; but yet they
are not carelessly, and sluggishly to be suffered to The Manichees forbad to
pull up any weeds out of a field or garden. Aust. de Mani. Agrum spinis purgari
nefas putant, quod plantae sentiunt.
overgrow and choke the good plants; As if nothing were true fixed and certain
in religion; nothing heretical, corrupt, and damnable in opinion and doctrine;
nothing immorall, unlawful, and abominable in practice; nothing perverse,
uncharitable, and uncomely in seditions, schisms and separations.

We read frequently the zeal, care and courage of Magistrates, Princes and
Priests among the Jews, Hezekiah, 2 Chronicles. 29. Josiah, 2 Chronicles. 34.
much commended for reforming Religion; restoring true ways of piety;
suppressing all abuses in Religion; Certainly it is not less a duty, nor less
pleasing to God now, among Christians, to take all care that the name of Christ
be not blasphemed; nor the way of truth perverted, or evil spoken of. We read
also the Spirit of Christ reproving as a great sin and omission of duty, Rev.
2.14. and 20.
that indifferency in the Angels of the Churches of Pergamus and Thyatira;
tolerating any thing, and condemning nothing; the one suffering those, that
held the doctrine of Balaam, and the impure Nicolaitans, who taught all
libidinous impudicities to be free for Christians: the other for tolerating
Jezebel under the color of a Prophetess to seduce the servants of God. The
Apostle Paul commands some men's mouths should be stopped, Tit. 1.11. Gal. 5.12.

any other Doctrine than the Gospel; that form of sound words once delivered to

He tells us that there is not only a word, but a rod, or power of coercion
left to the Church, and its lawful Pastors or Ministers, for the edification,
not for the destruction of the Church.

And however this power Ecclesiastical, which is from God, Magistratick and
Ministerial power when united.
as that other Magistratick, be wholly severed and divided in their courses,
while the Civil Magistrate is unchristian; yet when he embraces the
profession of Christianity, these two branches of power, (which flowed several
ways, yet from the same fountain, God) do so far meet again, and unite
their amicable streams, (...).
of Magistratick and Ministerial, Civil and Church power, as not to As those
of old that thought Herod to be the M^ssias. Ter^de pras. ad Ha^c. 5.
confound each other; nor yet to cross, and stop one the other; but rather to
increase, strengthen and preserve mutually each other; while the Minister of
Christ directs the Magistrate, and the Christian As Eusebius tells in
Constantine the Greats time, who joined with the Bishops and Ministers of the
Church in good government.
Magistrate protects the Minister; both of them, with a single eye, regarding
that great end, for which God in his love to mankind, and to his Church, has
established both these powers in Christian Churches and Societies; That neither
the bodies, nor the souls of Christians should want that good, which God has
offered them in Christ; nor suffer those injuries in society, for the
prevention or remedy of which, both Magistracy and Ministry are the Ordinances
of God; for enjoying the benefit of both which blessings, as every Christian
has a sociall capacity; so every lawful Magistrate, and Minister has
according to their places, and proportions, a public duty, and authority upon
them, to see justice and holiness, truth and peace, civil sanctions, and
divine institutions, purely, and rightly dispensed to inferiors, for whose
good they a^e of God ordained.

11. In what case only toleration of any thing in Religion were lawful.
If there were indeed no rule of the written Word of God, which Christians owned
as the settled foundation of Faith, the sure measure of doctrine, and guide of
good manners in religion, both publicly and privately; or if there were no
credible Tradition, delivered by word of mouth, and parents examples, which men
might imitate for the way of Religion, revealed to them by God; which was the
way before the flood; but, every one were to expect daily, either new
inspirations; or to follow the dictates of his own private fancy and reason;
Nothing then would be more irreligious, then to deny all freedom, public, as
well as private; nothing more just than to tolerate any thing of opinion, and
speculation which any one counted his religion; yet even in that liberty, of
walking and wandering in the dark, when no Sun of certain Revelation (divine)
had shined on mankind, Romans 1.32.2, 14.
the very light of Nature taught men, as among Heathens, that some things in
point of practice, are never tolerable in any humane society.

But since the wisdom, and mercy of God has given to mankind, (which the
Church always injoyes) the light of his holy Word, and a constant order of
Ministry to teach from it, the ways of God, in truth, peace, and holiness:
not only every Christian is bound to use all religious means, which God has
granted to settle his own judgment, and live accordingly in his private
sphere, without any Scepticall itch, or lust of disputing always in Religion.
But both Magistrate and Minister, (whose several duties are set forth, and
different powers ordained over others, in Scripture, for a sociall and public
good) must take care to attain that good of a settled Religion, and preserve it
in always of verity, equity and charity, which may all well consist with the
exercise of due authority: Nor is it any stinting or restraining of the Spirit
of God in any private Christian, to keep his Spirit within the bounds of the
Word of God; Deuteronomy. 29.29.
wherein the things revealed belong to us and our children; Nor is it any
restraint to the Spirit of God in the Scripture, to keep our opinions, and
judgments, and practices within the bounds of that holy faith, and good order,
which is most clearly set forth in the c^ncurrent sense of the Scriptures, and
explained by the Confessions of Faith, and practice of holy Discipline; which
the Creeds, and Councels, and customs of the Catholic Church hold forth to
them; Nor is it any limiting, or binding up of the Spirit of God in private
men, for the Christian Magistrate and Minister, to use all public means both
for the information, conviction, and conversion of those under their charge, as
to the inward man; and also of due restraint and coercion, as to the outward
expressions in which they stand related to a public and common good.

But if the negligence of Governors in Church and State, 12. What a Christian
must do in dissolute times.
should at any time so connive, and tolerate out of policy, or fear, or other
base passion; if through the brokennesse, and difficulties of times the sons of
Zeruiah be too hard for Magistrates and good Ministers; so as the vulgar fury,
corrupted by factious, and unruly spirits, are impatient of just restraits; but
carry on all things against Laws and wiser men's desires to a licentious
Anarchy, and all confusions in the outward face and public Ministrations of
Religion; yet must no good Christian think this any dispensation for any
private errors in his judgment, or practice; In maxima rerum licentia, minima
esse debet very Christiani libertas, Gib. Lex sibi severissima est pura
conscientia and dei amor. Ber.
he must be the more circumspect, and exact in his station, and duty as a
Christian, when the public course runs most to confusion: tolerating least in
his own conscience, when most is tolerated by others: The love of God, and
Christ, and of the truth of Religion; and the respect and reverence borne the
order of the Ministry and to the Churches honor and peace; these must be to
every good Christian the constant Law, and severest discipline; Teaching him to
govern himself most strictly, when others affect most a misgovernment, or none
at all in Religion; to act nothing immorally, rudely, and exorbitantly; to
discharge all his relations, and duties with the more exactness; to bear with
patience, (yet with sorrow) the want of that public good, which he desires;
No way to hinder the restoring of due order and authority to the Church, and
honor to Religion; to pray for, counsel, and assist the recovery of it,
according to the Scripture rules, right reason, and the custom of the best
times.

And however the vain and mad world goes on wildly and giddily, as an un^amed
heifer; enduring no yoke of Religion, as to any public order, Government,
Discipline, or Ministry; yet must not a serious and well advised Christian
delay to guide his feet in the ways of truth, and holiness, nor neglect to
work out his salvation (in Gods way) till public distractions are composed:
or delay to be good, till all turbulent and fanatic spirits return to their
wits; or till ancient public order and Government in the Church be so settled,
and Religion so fortified by civil sanctions, as it ought to be: for no man
knows, how long the Apostle Paul may be in a storm; or the Church tossed with
schisms and factions, and secular interests, before it recover the haven of a
happy setlednesse.

True Ministers and true piety most to be regarded in licentious times.
Therefore a Christian that makes it his work, not to prate, and dispute, and to

believe steadfastly, and obey constantly that holy rule; has never more cause
to prize and adhere to the true Ministry, and Ministers of Christ, than when he
sees the greatest persecutions lying on the Church, either by violence, or
toleration; by open force, or fraudulent liberty; which are (both) the Tivels
Engines, to batter, or undermine the Church of Christ: Never should holy
dispensations be more earnestly desired and diligently attended from the hands
of those Ministers in whom only is the right power, authority, and succession;
than, when nothing is less tolerated among various and violent men, than a
true Bishop and Minister, or a right ordained Ministry; which, of all things,
is to the devil and evil men the most intolerable: Satan well knows, Matthew.

that if he destroy the Shepherds, the sheep will be scattered. When good
Christians see the abomination of desolation set up; profanely tolerating any
thing for Religion, allowing of any Mimicks for true Ministers, vulgar adoring
of a rotten Idol of licentiousness, gilded over with the name of Liberty, when
silencing true Ministers, and suppress^ng good learning, and crying up
illiterate impudence, shall be thought a means to propagate the Gospel; Then
let then that are seriously and soberly godly fly to the Mounteines, (to the
true Ministers of the Church) from whom God has appointed salvation to descend
to the believing souls: Nor are they to regard what every bold and ignorant
upstart boasts and feigneth of Inspirations, liberties and blessed
toleration; obtruding himself out of the promptness and pride of his own
heart upon the credulous and silly vulgar (who love to be flattered to their
ruin, and deceived to their destruction, but hate to be truly guided, and
faithfully governed to their safety;) For all these pretenses of Liberty,
Toleration, Inspirations, etc. are manifest to be but as the devils silken
halters, by which he hopes to strangle the Christian and reformed Religion here
and elsewhere: it may be (seemingly) and with more gentleness; but not with
less malice, and cruelty to men's souls, than with those rougher hempen cords
of open persecution.

From which, such sad toleration and rude Liberties are not very far; being but
new expressions of Anarchy, and colors of portending confusion, or utter
dissolutions of all Church order, peace and Government, into a cruel
licentiousness, which is always tyrannous to true Religion: Nothing is more
burdensome than some men's levities, nor more fulsome, and deformed, than their
Reformations; nothing more uncharitable and untractable, than their liberties;
nor more a plague and death to Religion, than, what they call, health and
recovery; when vulgar or fanatic violence binds so much the staff of
discipline, till it breaks; heady men surfeit the flock by over-driving it, and
Wolves in sheeps clothing, scatter and tear the sheep of Christ under pretense
of letting them go, whither they list; in stead of being true shepherds,
fetching them home, and feeding them in due bounds, with good pasture: in which
wholesome and safe bounds, both Christian Magistrates, Sic vigilet tolerantia,
ut non dormiat disciplina. Aust. l. 17. de verb. Ap.
and true Ministers should seek to feed the flock of Christ; not as bare
spectators of their wanderings and errors, but as enabled and entrusted by God
with a coercive power from Christ, for the Churches good: and where the
Magistrate is negligent, there the Minister should be the more diligent in the
place where Christ has set him; who is the great Shepherd of our souls,
(...). Thucyd. Libera me a malo; hoc est, a me ipso. Ber.
beyond whose holy bounds for any Christians to affect any Liberty, is to wear
the devils livery, while they are in Christ's service. Few men complain of want
of freedom, but they whose freedom would be their own and other men's greatest
bondage: Nothing is less desirable to a good Christian, than to be left to
himself: for men are then nearest to be undone, when they may do, what they
list; and least in safety, when they are their own keepers.

MY next Calumniating Adversary, The 6 Cavil. Against the maintenance of the
Ministry, as settled by Law.
against the Ministry of England, which I have to deal with and detect, is
possessed with a thirsty and covetous Spirit; which would fain have Liberty, if
not to speak, and act, what he list in Religion (without any restraint of
Magistrate or Minister) yet at least to pay what he list to any Minister, since
he is free to hear whom, and when he list, or none at all; he would not be tied
by any law to pay any thing to their support, although it be due to them, and a
right which none else might challenge. He likes not that settled maintenance,
which they challenge as due. This subtle and frugall churl of a Christian is a
Jesuitick terrien, has many wary fetches and windings against the Ministers of
the Gospel in the reformed Churches; but none beyond this plot, that he hopes
ere long to be too hard, or too cunning for them here in England: while under
some specious, and politic pretention, he shall deprive them of all settled
maintenance; and by so spoiling and distressing the Ministry, he shall be sure
to pillage, and lay waste in a short time, Answ. 1. The vileness and

This thirsty and covetous Devil is the eldest son of Pluto; Beelzebubs
Steward; a perfect hater of the true God; a servant of Mammon; the very ghost
of Nabal; a child of darkness; an enemy to all saving light; so deformedly
black, that he is ashamed to show his face, but under the veil of religious,
and reforming pretenses; his envious eyes, Matthew. 26.8
like Judasses, cannot endure to see any costly effusions, which the devout and
liberal piety of former times have powered upon the heads of Christ and his
Ministers; which some men would now make to be but an Omen, verse. 12.
or presage, that their death and burial is not far off; The envy and anger of
these Antiministeriall adversaries is daily and lowdly clamorous in speech and
pamphlets; To what purpose is this waste; might not the Glebes and Tithes be
sold, and better employed? when there are so many frugall undertakers, who are
able and willing to preach the Gospel gratis; who would be no burden to the
people? Joh. 12.6. Non nulli pari dolere commoda aliena ac suas injurias

Not that Judas cared for the poor, nor these for the people; but, because he
was a thief, etc. What these envious objecters will be, time will best show; at
present their eyes are evil, because other men's have been good; and, as by an
ignorant confidence they contradict the Apostles question, Who is sufficient
for these things? so by a sacrilegious ingratitude they hasten to answer the
Prophets question; or rather the Lords; Will a man rob God? Yes; these
projectors for Atheism, Barbarity and profaneness, (...). Is Pel. l 3. Ep. 24.
would fain persuade this whole Nation to join with their cruel and covetous
design; to rob so many honest men, and able Ministers of that maintenance,
which their learning and labors merit, which they have a right to as by law,
so by the possession of many hundred years: that so they may at once rob this
Church of the blessing of the true Christian reformed Religion; and rob God
also of that honor and holy service, which both privately, and publicly is
done to him by thousands of his servants, the Ministers of this Church. It is
no wonder, if those that grudge at the cost bestowed on Christ meditate to
betray him; and had rather make a benefit or save something by his death, than
see any thing bestowed on him while he lives, though it be by others bounty:
For alas, what these men grudge at as given to Ministers, is little or nothing
out of their own purses or estates: Nor is it given by them to Ministers any
more than the rent they justly pay to their Landlords. Isai. 52.5.6.
But what can vile men meditate save only vile things?

Sacrilege against the light of Nature. Jer. 2.11. Plato calls Sacrilege

And indeed what can be more sordidly vile, or should be more strange, and
less named, among those that are called Christians, and reformed too; than
such degenerations from the very dictates of nature, and the common sense of

Gods, did ever any Nation rob, and spoil their gods; which yet were not gods?

But the great grievance which these men cry out of, 2. Against maintenance of
Ministers by Tithes.
and hope will be very taking with tender conscienced covetousness, is this;
That the Ministers of the Gospel should have Tithes; At these they are
scandalized, as much as a Jew would be at eating of Swines flesh; They are so
afraid of turning Jews by paying Tithes to Ministers, that they had rather turn
Turks, by taking quite away both Tithes and Ministers: Matthew. 23.2^.
How well does our blessed Saviors severity fit these men's hypocrisies? while
they strain at the gnat of Tithes, and swallow down the Camels of rapine and
Sacrilege: they stumble at the straws of Tithes, and leap over the beams of
cruelty and unjustice.

Tithes due by a civil right of Donation an^ Law cannot justly be taken away.
See Sir Edward Coke, on Lit. Ten. l. 1. c. 9. Sect. 73. An. 850. King Ethel
wulp with the Prelates and Princes in several Provinces of all England

tit. 1. Prove. 20.25. It is a snare to the man who devoureth that which is holy,
and after vows to make enquiry.
For if God had no right to require; or there were no word, commanding the
Tenths to be devoted to his service, (who is Lord and donor of all:) or, if he
had never assigned this right (since himself needs nothing) to his servants the
Ministers under the Gospel, (as he did most clearly under the Law:) yet sure
the Proprietors, which were Princes, or Peers, or people of this land, (our
pious progenitors) had a civil right to the land and the fruits thereof; which
no Law of God ever forbad them to dedicate, as they had a mind, to the service
of God, or any portion of it, as they pleased to the maintenance of the
Ministry of the Gospel; Nay they (as all men) were encouraged, yea and
commanded, to honor God with their substance, Prove. 3.9. This they have often
done, by the full and frequently renewed consent of all Estates in this Nation,
for many hundred of years past; establishing by curses or Anathemas, and by
civil laws the dedication of those Tithes, which are Feudum Dei, Gods fee, and
his Ministers chiefest maintenance; So that, if these Antidecimists cannot
think them sufficiently proved to be Gods immediate gift to his Ministers; yet
they may easily see it is man's gift to God; that is, for the maintaining of his
public service, and Ministry of the Church: whereof the donation cannot but
be, both in Reason and Religion, very lawful; and so the enjoyment of them, at
least in that tenure, very just; since it was done by the right owners, to a
very right and good end: Nor do I see how the alienation of them from that
holy use can be lawful, now, by the will of any men, since the title and
propriety is now in God; though the use of the fruit be in in the Ministers of
God, as his Feodataries and tenants, or homagers.

2. Not honorably or piously.
And if there could be a lawful resumption by posterity, or an abrogation of
the will of this Nation, in what it has thus dedicated and given to God, if
this could be done without a crying sin of sacrilege; yet doubtless the piety
and honor of this Nation is still such in all worthy mention, that it would
never be done by a free Parliamentary and public vote: Nemo potest mutare
consili^n suum in alterius praejudicjum. Reg. Iuis.
since, if all humanity and honor forbids any man to resume the gifts of
charity, which he has once given to poor men, whereto they have both man's
and Gods right, (as freely given to them for Gods sake by the lawful owners)
much more does all piety and religion forbid any men ((...) to take away,
Eusebius tells, that before the ruin of Jerusalem so impudent and violent were
wicked men, that they took away the Tithes and benefit of the Altar from the
Priests, so as many died for want, Hist. Eccles. l 2. c. 20.
or subduce by force or fraud, as Ananias and Saphira did) any thing, that is
once by themselves (or others) dedicated to God: especially in such a way of
service, which he requires in his Word; That is, for the maintenance of that
order, government, and Ministry of holy things, which the Lord has appointed
in his Church. Which cannot be done without necessary subsidies of life, for
Ministers, as men; And since a power of demanding, and receiving maintenance is
in the true Ministers of the Gospel, in Christ's name, (as the Apostle Paul
proves; no doubt there is no less power in Christian people, of giving them,
or rather paying them, as Act. 53. Why has Satan filled thy heart to ly to the
Holy Ghost, and to keep back, (or defraud and purloin) part of the price of the
land?
1 Cor. 9 6, 7, 8, etc. Gal. 6 6.
a due debt, both in divine, and humane equity, either in occasional, and
moveable maintenance; or fixed and perpetual.

The first was the way of Ministers and Bishops alimony in the primitive
unsettled, and persecuting times; Ne invidia Clericis obveniat de poss^ssionibus
Ecclesia obtulit plebi. B. Augustinus malle se ex collationibus vivere ut
antiqui. Sed id Laici suscipere noluerunt. Poss. vit. Aust.
when Christians could not expect to be long masters of their own estates in
lands; nor could they endow any Minister or Church with any part of them, to
perpetuity; yet then in those hard and perilous times, we read in
Ecclesiastical stories, that the liberal gifts and free will offerings, of
all manner of good things, from the devout Laity to the the then most deserving
Clergy, amounted to more, than the after settled means by way of Tithes.

Which way of maintenance was as anciently, so generally settled in all
Christians Churches after Constantines time, 3. Nor wisely.

thus given by believers to God (as a grateful acknowledgment, of his dominion
over us, and all we have; of his bounty, conferring all upon us; of his mercy,
vouchsafing to accept from us any portion of that, which is his own) returns,
indeed, to the bosom of the givers; and aims, next the glorifying of God, at
the spiritual and eternal good of their own souls; Nor can God to
unthankefull to those, unto whom he gives the grace of being so really
thankful to himself, for what is done to the Ministers of Christ, is as done
Christ himself; and what is done to Christ redounds to a man's own good: The
divine munificence as the heavens always returning with liberal showers and
fruitful dews upon us, what ever grateful exhalations our devout humility (as
the earth) sends up to him; An. 587. Synodas Mutiscenensis de decimis leges

either in charity to the poor, or in a liberal requital to his Ministers:
Neither of which are welcome objects to those ravenous appetites, who so much
grudge that Tithes should by any title, though never so free gift, which is
very just and good, be given to Ministers, and enjoyed by them; When once these
hungry stomachs have satified themselves with the flesh of Ministers; the
Clergies maintenance, or Churches Patrimony; who may doubt, but they will also
pick the bones of all Colleges, Hospitals, and Almshouses? Nothing being
sacred to a sacrilegious mind; Synod. Moguntina sub Carol. M. an. 813. Can.

nor unviolable to a violent and rapacious hand. Nor is it a hope so much to
relieve their own necessities; but a kind of wanton cruelty, which makes many
of these Evening Wolves, so fierce and ravenous against the Ministers
maintenance: Nay, many of them covet nothing more, than to see all the
excellent Ministers of England, reduced to the same beggary, which the meanest
of themselves now contend with all, or lately did; so little have most of them
profited by their over thrifty piety: Nor are such illiberall souls ever to be
satisfied with good things. (...), Sacrilegis nil sacrum. Hierod.


3. Against Tithes as Judaicall, etc.
But Tithes are Ceremonial, Legal, Typical, Judaicall, and (which visard
makes every face ugly and terrible to the vulgar) they are Anchristian.

Answ. It Is possible some simple country people may be scared to subscribe
against Tithes with these bugges words; But sure, for these men, who pretend to
fright others; I believe they have no more real horror upon them, to take
Tithes, or more, of others, either as they pretend to be Preachers, or as they
are Lay Impropriators; than the conjurers in Lapland have, who make many
strange faces, and fearful noises, as if they had raised, and espied a devil
in their circle; when all is to get but a little money of the silly spectators:
The meaning of all this great cry against Tithes of Ministers is, to save a
little wool, though the sheep be the more scabby; to spare some small matter,
which some of these objecters (it may be) yearly pay to the Ministers, with
much regret and murmuring: Yea, it is generally observed, that these clamorers
who make the greatest cry, do not yield the fairest fleece; nay most of them
not one grain to the feeding, nor one lock to the clothing of any Minister;
nor indeed have they much wool (for the most part) on their own backs, which
makes them envy all that have. Sheep are silent under the shearers hand: but
dogs are prone to bark and snarl at those that feed them: Phil. 3.2.
of whom the Apostle Paul bids the Saints, Bishops, and Deacons of Philippi to
beware, as of evil workers; who are not content with the circumcision of
Ministers maintenance, which has been already too much made, by severer hands;
but they aim at a total concision; a taking all away. As for these Repiners,
they are not so guilty of paying Tithes, as they would be of receiving them;
It Is as much a covetous, as an envious spirit, which possesses them: Yea,
rather than fail of their design against Ministers, they are not content with
their own not paying any thing to Ministers, but they repine, that any men else
should; whose gratitude and religion teaches them to give to every man what is
their due, especially to the Ministers of Christ, which they justly do, as
with a good will and cheerful mind, so with a good will, and with a far more
judicious and upright conscience, both to God and man, than these covetous
cavillers can possibly carp, or grudge against them; who, poor men, every day
think they grow leaner, while they see or hear any Minister has what they call
a fat Benefice, or a competent Living: Although the faithful Lamp spends its
self, and all the Oil too, in the place, where he receives it.

But these murmurers cannot digest the Jewishnesse of Tithes, Of Tithes as
Jewish.
and they are still fancying, and afraid some costly sacrifice must needs go
along, where ever Tithes are continued.

Answ. It may be, these men cannot endure Tithes, unless the Jews might enjoy
them; who (although still crucifying Christ in their malice, hardness, and
blasphemies, yet) these men seem far less averse from entertaining them with
their fawning and flattering insinuations into their bosoms, than from
maintaining or countenancing those Ministers who preach and believe in Jesus
Christ crucified, as the only Messiah and Savior of the world; Nay these Anti
decimists glory in two things, as high tokens of their Sanctity: one is, their
endeavors, first, to further the conversion of the Jews: the second is, to
hasten the subversion of the office of the Christian Ministry: Nor do the
Jews unwillingly flatter them sometimes, as very great factors for them, when
they see what rare Jewish projects they have common with them; against both the
name and faith, the Church and Ministers of Jesus Christ; who had never so
prevailed by his word against the Jewish pertinacy, and obstinacy, if he had
not had an able, constant, faithful and ordained Ministry; nor had this
Ministry without miracle continued, if there had been no constant maintenance;
which the more settled it is against covetous and ungrateful spirits, the more
is the preaching of the Gospel, and its power likely to settle, in all humane
reason; (Notwithstanding that the corrupt lusts of men are prone sometime to
abuse peace and plenty, as David did his leisure, strength, and retirement;)
One would think; that these men did forget, that the Ministers of the Gospel
are men, as well as the Jewish Pri sts were, Thou shall not muzzle the mouth of
the Ox, etc. 1 Co^. 9 9, 12.13, 14, etc. The Ox has a mouth to feed himself
as well as feet to ^^ead out the corn for others.
and that they have mouths given them not only to feed others with the Word of
life, but also themselves with bodily food, as the necessary staff of life:
Yea, they not only may, but ought to live of the Gospel, as the Priests did
of the altars service. Indeed the words and spirits of these Calumniators
against Tithes and Ministers do signify, as if it would more trouble them, to
see the knife of a Priest ready to slay a beast, than to see the rudest fellow
of their faction ready to cut any Ministers throat in England.

But it is strange these men should now be so squeamish, as to Ministers
receiving of Tithes (which were by the piety of our ancestors given of old to
them, or to God rather, for his service: And this not by Ministers persuasion,
or importunity so much, as by the good will, and devotion of this Christian
Nation) when themselves have always so good stomachs, that they devour nothing
more easily and digest nothing more cheerfully, than these sacred morsels, when
either they fraudulent^y detain them, or injuriously deny them to the
Ministers; to whom in all justice and humane law, (it is clear) they belong;
yet it is styled by one of this party a conscientious sincerity in many, that
refuse to pay them; Is it not rather a detestable covetousness, Col. 3 5.
(which is Idolatry) that denies, or defrauds any man of their due? is it not
an abhorred sacrilege, that rob the Ministers of theirs? for which right or
dues they have as much to show (at least) as any man has for any thing that is
his, by the Laws of the land: Sure, we are but a very base and bad Nation, if
many (as we are lately told by one) of the very best of the people, Proposals
of H. R.
had rather in conscience and sincerity do other men, and especially Ministers
so great wrong (who must starve most of them with their families, or beg their
bread having no other livelihood, if they have not this) than pay, what is due
to them, and so necessary for them; O consciences more thrifty than tender; O
quam religio^a sunt ava^orum delicta! Cyp. Non statim religiosi sunt quia
impune sacrilegi Min. Fell. de Romans
more scraping, than sincere; which have thus much of the Jew in them, that
they make little or no conscience to cosen any, that are not of their own
Tribe or faction; When did any of these sincere men, as he calls them, make
conscience to pay their Tithes justly? or if not in that kind, when did they
make conscience to pay, as much, or more of free will to the Minister, as their
Tithe came to? They might soon pull this thorn or scruple out of their
consciences; if in stead of the tenth they would pay rather a sixth or seventh
part, or any, that is not short of what the Law of man commands: so they shall
be sure, neither to savor of the Jew, nor of any injustice. But still we may
observe, when some men handle Conscience, their meaning is to lick their own
fingers: But when, I pray, are these sincere and best of men, any whit
scrupulous, or tender conscienced, in the point of their possessing any Tithes
by an Impropriate Lay-tenure? When did any of them ever complain of them? when
were they surfeited, or overcharged with them? Notwithstanding there is more
of the Pope in an Impropriation, than in any thing else, about Tithes, for
Tithes were generally so Impropriated by his authority; and are held in no
other manner now, Statut. Hen. 8.
than as they were by the Popes power aliened from the Rectory, to some
Monastery, or Religious house.

So that as Cato merrily, yet severely said of the Tuscane Soothsayers, (who
were least of all such, as their name sounds) He wondered they could forbear to
laugh at one another, who so well knew each others juggling, and their own
knavery; So may I reply to these scrupulous Antidecimists: Sure it is but their
sport and merriment, thus to abuse simple people, with their over righteousn
sse or superfluity of malice rather, feigning a sense of that, as a sin, and
unlawful in Ministers; when themselves practice the same thing most willingly
on very suspected grounds without any remorse, or scruple; as if they had an
excellent good title from the Pope, and the Laws for Impropriate tithes (where
the very end of peoples paying Tithes is frustrated; (which is their
Institution and direction in the public service of God,) And yet neither God
nor man could give a good title to Ministers for receiving Tithes; who carry on
that great good end, for which impiety and equity they were designed; which is
to help on people in serving of God, and saving their souls; Such
self-condemned, Romans 2.1. Cui absolvi potest, qui nec sibi est innocens? Amb.
off. l. 1. c. 12.
and unexcusable cavillers seem in many things to be children, (as in
peevishness, and inconstancy: in the most commendable quality (innocence) they
are least like:) but I wonder they should be so much babies, and so weak in
understanding, as to this point of Tithes, (unless, because they are too much
men in malice) since this subject about Tithes, as the settled and best
maintenance of the Ministry of the Gospel, has been so clearly, fully, and
learnedly explained, proved and asserted by all law, both divine and humane, by
many excellent pens, not only of Ministers, but of others; who may be thought
more impartial (as Gentlemen, and Lawyers) both long since and of later times:
But the way of these Antiministeriall men is to read no books, whose title they
prejudge, nor to admit any truth to their partial tribunal, but what is
saving; (they mean, and so do I) to their purses.

To refresh their memories therefore in so trite a subject; 4. Of the ancient
right and use of Tithes.

That they draw their origin either from the common light of Nature; or from
that traditionall Theology, which was in the Patriarchs of old: which dictated,
as a Deity, so a Priesthood, or Ministry to serve it; also a duty to
consecrate, ordain, and maintain for that public service some men, who should
be fittest to attend it. Do they not read that Tithes were paid by Abraham the
father of the faithful to Genesis 14.20.41. Heb. 7.4.
Melchisedek the Type of Christ? And why then should any worshippers of Christ,
who are children of faithful Abraham (by imitation of the same faith, which
was in him, long before the Law of Moses) think it a sin or error in them, to
pay Tithes to Christ, (the Antitype) by the hands of his Ministers; who are
Mat. 10 40, Ioh. 13.20.
deputatively, and Ministerially himself? whereas indeed it may rather seem a
sin not to pay them; since we see Christ has so good a title to them, who yet
did not claim them when he lived, because the Leviticall Priesthood was yet
standing: yet Luke 8.3. diverse that had been cured ministered to Christ and his
family of their substance, and Matthew. 10.10. he declares the Ministers right to
be as good, as the laborers to his hire. If he that receives you, receives
me, and he that despises you, despises me; and he that gives to a Prophet a
cup of cold water in my name, gives it to me; if these be true, and
Evangelicall; why is it not as true and Evangelicall, He that pays Tithes to
you, as my Ministers, pays them to me? Whether it be by private and solitary,
or by public and joint gift and dedication; Sure the highest right and claim
Paramount must be eminently in Christ who is Lord of all, more then in
Melchisedeck; and so either the obligation to pay them, or the lawfulness to
accept them in Christ's name, as a right to him; or as a free gift offered from
believers to the honor and service of Christ, must needs be evident in all
justice and religion; (As water is purest in the Fountain, and light clearest
in the Sun, so is Melchisedeks right most in Christ:) Nay I think in good
earnest, that a Christian Jew would hence draw an argument, (although he were
of that tribe of Levi, to which Tithes were after commanded to be paid among
the Jews) that he ought now to pay them to the Christian Ministers, Heb. 7.4.8,
9, etc.
or to Christ; as in relation to his service, and as an agnition of him to be
Lord and God; since, even Levi in Abraham's loins paid Tithes to Melchisedek;
that is, to the type and representer of Christ: And since the Lord Jesus Christ
is the perfection and sum of the Priesthood and order of Melchisedek, he may
justly claim what ever was typified; as a due or honor to be done to him; of
which this is one; that he should receive Tithes who never dies, Heb. 7.8. and
15. So that this Evangelicall right of Christ, as those promises to Abraham,
being before the Legal establishment, is not to be annulled by that law of the
Jews, Gal. 3.17.
which was 400. years after.

As to the intervenient appointment and after custom of paying Tithes, divinely
settled by a positive Law among the Jews, (as the then only Church of God) it
carries not any frown in its face against Christian Ministers now receiving
Tithes, or others paying them under the Gospel; if there were no Law of the
Land devoting Tithes to God, and enjoining the payment of them to Ministers as
a rent charged upon lands, and estates; what sin could it be for any Christian
(as many primitive Christians spontan ously did) to devote, set apart, and give
yearly the tenth of all his increase to the Ministers of the Gospel? Sure
nothing of right reason, Scripture, or true Religion, (which only should rule
the conscience of any sober man) does teach any Christian to abhor, what ever
was instituted or practiced among the Jews; if it be but after the law of
common equity, gratitude, piety, or civility; toward God, or man; Else these
Antidecimists must think they sinned, if they should but cover their
excrements, Deuteronomy. 23.13.
which was once a law of cleanliness among the Jews; yea the example of God so
confirming by a positive law, in that his ancient Church of the Jews, those
general dictates of nature, and the preceding practice of Abraham, paying
Tithes to Melchisedek as to the Priest of the most High God, and a type of
Christ, according to grounds of common equity and natural piety, or gratitude
to God and man; This consideration I say should have the greater inducement to
assure Christians; that, what is neither merely Typical, nor Ceremonial, (as
Tithes were never thought to be by any learned or wise men) but rather a thing
of common equity, and piety; confirmed by a divine positive command, and the
choice of God, this cannot but be as acceptable to God now, when dedicated (by
the consent of any Christian people) to his Evangelicall service, and Ministry;
as it was before either from the hand of Abraham, or his posterity: since it is
no where forbidden in the Gospel, and by Gods wisdom has been chosen as the
fittest proportion under the Law.

Yea, and to those, that have not the loosest, but the liberallest consciences
among Christians, it seems expressly recommended, after that pattern, Even so
has the Lord ordained, Cor. 9.14. v. 13.
that they that preach the Gospel, should live of the Gospel; Even so, as
they did, who served at the Altar; so far as the imitation can now hold; which
though it cannot in the Sacrifices, yet it may in the Tithes, and in first
fruits, and free will offerings, which were frequently, and plentifully brought
to the Bishops and Ministers of the Churches in primitive times, for their own
support and the Deacons, with the poor; If the Tenth, or (quantum) How much, be
not here expressed; yet it is vehemently employed; Else the Apostle had proved
nothing, nor given any directions, either for Ministers fitting support, or for
Christians regulating of their retributions; if he does not command them to
pay, at least a Tenth, sure he does not condemn their paying a Tenth part,
which they may freely do, if there were no such divine right pleadable, as
this indeed is to all Christians, whose covetousness does not teach them to
cavil against reason and Scripture too; However, this is the least, that we
can make of that place; if in difficult times, (such as the primitive were)
something were left to the gratitude, ingenuity, love, and largeness of
Christians hearts toward their Ministers, (wherein sometime they even exceeded
their power and estate in munificence:) yet in quiet times, and in a plentiful
land it may well be expected by God, (at least, it cannot be blameable) for any
Nation, Church, or private Christian to give, and settle such a portion, as the
Tenths of the increase, upon those that serve the Lord, and the Church in the
Ministry of the Gospel. It is easily computed, that Tithes were not one half
of the Leviticall maintenance; What reason can these men give (beyond their
will and despite) why the Christian Ministry should fare worse, or have less
honor, than the Jewish, since it is in many things, Heb. 7.19.22. Heb. 8.6.
a better Ministry? 1. Clearer in the light of Doctrine, promises, and
prophesies. 2. As venerable in the Mysteries. 3. Far more glorious in its chief
Minister and Mediator, Jesus Christ, Heb. 3.5.
the Son of God; the other by servants. 4. Much easier in the burden both of
labor, ceremony and charges, to beleivers and worshippers; 5. Yet not less
painful to the Ministers, whose spirits are more exhausted by studies,
preaching and other Ministerial duties, than the Jewish Priests by more gross
and bodily labors. 6. Not less comfortable to devout and pious souls. 7.
More universally diffused, as more convenient for all mankind; 8. And never
esteemed less necessary to the Church, or less acceptable to God; save only
by Atheists, or Niggards; who had rather read that most blasphemous and no
less irrational than irreligious book, De Tribus Impostoribus, than the four
Evangelists; valuing a cheap Alcoran before a costly Bible.

5. Tithes not Popish or Antichristian.
So then, I think I have with a very soft and sober fire, quite decocted the Jew
out of Tithes, and with as much or more ease, will Antichrist, as they call it,
or any dregs of Popery, evaporate out of them; Some men's teeth are so set on
edge by too much chewing of the Pope, that they cannot bite, or taste any
thing, but it relisheth of Antichrist to them; if the Romish Church and Bishops
did ever use it: If any thing (as I have said) be suspicable for Popish or
Antichristian in Tithes, sure it goes with the Impropriations; for if it were
blameable to alien Tithes from the Ministry, and cure of souls, by annexing
them to Regular and Monastic uses; and if it were not commendable to alien
them from both, to mere secular uses; where they are usually expended with more
luxury and vanity, as with less piety and charity, sure the best way was to
have kept them in their original design; which was for the maintenance of the
Ministers: Nor is the Popes traffiquing, or disposing of them, during his
usurpation, here any prejudice to them, no more than a blear eye eclipseth the
Sun by looking on it, or a foul hand abuses a Jewel by touching it. That the
Popes of Rome invented Tithes, is as true, as a learned Rubbi of these new
ways, (and a great Preacher too) once told me with most unhistoricall
confidence; St. Aust. Ep 28. B. Cyprianus non aliquod novum decretum condens
sed Ecclesiae fidem firmissimamservans, corrigit eos, qui ante 8. diem purvulum
non esse baptizandum putabant.
That Pope Gregory the great first invented Infant baptism; (which it is sure
enough St. Jerome and St. Austin, Cyprian and others mention as a Catholic
custom in their days, which was some hundred of years before Gregory; and
they often declare it to have been an ancient, primitive and Apostolical
practice; which no Father, no Bishop, no Council, ever began; but was
generally used, as we find in St. Cyprian, from the first plantation of
Christianity, and the making Disciples to Christ: Initiating them by water, as
the Jews formerly had done Proselytes in their Church.) But this is only in
passant, to show how great confidence attends gross ignorance in these men; As
to this of tithes, so far as the Pope had to do with them at any time, Cypr.
Ep. 59. ad Fidum, an. 250. A baptismo post Christum prohiberi non debet infant
recens natus, etc.
I have taken away the foolish scandal and vulgar prejudice, giving in another
place sufficient account to all that are capable of sober truth; That nothing
in Christian Religion, either in Scriptures, Sacraments and doctrines, or in
the order, power, succession, government and maintenance of Ministers in the
Church, are therefore burnt with Antichristianism, or with any thing which the
Vulgar calls Popery, because the Pope set his foot sometime in them; For truly
then our Parliaments (which are accounted sacred in their essence and honor)
should be Antichristian too; for time was, when they did own the authority, yea
and reconcile and submit themselves to the power of the Pope and See of Rome.
If any men reply Parliaments have long ago purged themselves of the Pope and
Popery: Truly so have all things else in this Church, and Tithes among others,
which these men's mouths so much water after; and sure such squeamish stomachs,
as theirs, would never desire and digest them, (as they do) if there were the
least grain of Antichrist or Pope either in Lay or Clergy men's Tithes; for they
vehemently pretend to have vomited up all, that savours of the Pope or Popery.

But it is lost labor to seek further to pull this prating worm out of some
men's tongues, when the root of it is in their brains; if they had but the tithe
of common reason and sober sense, they would easily see, how little the
Ministers of England, or any Christian Church of the like way is beholden to
the Popes of Rome, in the matter of tithes; It had been better for us, that the
Pope had never meddled with them; which occasioned so many Impropriations, and
these so many beggarly livings; which can hardly expect or make a rich and able
Minister; if these men would really reform, they should promote the restoring
(by some convenient way) those Impropriate Tithes to the Church; But their
reformation is always on the taking, not on the giving hand; like the
footsteps to the Lions den, all are toward, none frowards. It Is very probable,
the Popes made little of their own lands any where Tithable; if, when they saw
the charity of Christians grow cold, and their luxury, in peaceful times,
great, the Bishops of Rome persuaded others to settle the maintenance of the
Ministry, and to provide for the double honor of the Clergy, by this way of
Tithes, which might not be arbitrary, but legal, and certain; Truly it was one
of the most prudent, and pious works, that ever any of the best Popes did for
the Church; (And truly many of them were so wise and holy men, that they might
in great part cover and expiate the lesser errors of others; if too much of
secular pride, and humane passions had not afterward transported them beyond
all bounds, becoming Christian Prelates) It were a madness, only worthy of
these Antidecimists, to abhor to do any thing, never, so sober, which others
(now become frantic, and disordered) sometime did in their better moodes.

6. Of turning tithes into a Lay Channel for the ease of some tender
consciences.
But there is a late writer, who has projected, how to percolate Tithes so
through Lay hands in a public Exchequer, or Tith-office, which will
effectually purge away all that is Jewish, Antichristian, or uncircumcised in
them; (as sure as a Monks cowle will recommend a dead man to heaven;) I am as
solicitous for those officers danger, as that writer is for the Ministers; lest
they prove tithe-coveters; when they shall have pregnant hopes, to make their
fees better, for dispensing those Tithe-pensions to their poor pensioners and
humble suppliants, than any one Ministers maintenance will be out of them;
unless he be a strange favorite of that Court: I suppose those Officers for
gathering, receiving, and distributing of Tithes in such pensions to the
remnant of those poor dependent, and most patient Ministers, will be more
sincere and conscientious, for a time, than to take any bribes, or rewards for
expedition; But it is very probable they will not be men of such metal, as
will never be corrupted: And O how sad a project will this be in a short time,
if these Lay exactors should be more heavy and grievous, not only to the poor
Ministers, but also to the common people, in their rigorous exactions by
troopers or treble damages, than ever Ministers were! How deplorable will it
be, if these Lay exactors of Tithes should prove sons of Belial too, as well as
Elyes sons; who found, I think, but little of the peoples tithes, in the
sacrifices; So that, in this odious reflection, that writers pen strikes not so
sure, as the Priests flesh book did; 1 Samuel 2.14.
and as unseasonably too: (which was indeed the fin, serving themselves of the
peoples oblations before God;) while that proposer has no tender consideration
of any poor Ministers condition: against whose conscience it may be, as well as
against his ease and profit (very much) to be deprived of what is his by a
former and better Law; and after he has labored hard, then to ride and
solicit, and pray and pay for his wages; Which of these envious projectors and
supercilious distributers of other men's estates will kindle a fire, or open any
door to a Minister of Christ for nothing?

Nor does that Reformer of Tithes lay to heart the dissatisfactions, and
scandal of many as wise and as godly men's consciences as his precious ones
are, who are (ten for one) persuaded; that they ought, as by laws of the Land,
so in all Religion to God, and gratitude to their Ministers, pay their Tithes
immediately, and truly to them, which they had much rather do, than have the
best place, that any man can fancy in this new designed Office and Exchequer
for tithes; Nor do I believe a like project would please that great projector,
if one should take his cloak from his home, and make him ride ten, twenty or
thirty miles to fetch it, every time he would make use of it. Certainly Tithes
are by all equity and law; as much due to every Minister in his place, as the
coat, which that Proposer has on his back. Nor is the property of things,
only to be considered; but the proximity also, and the convenience of using
and enjoying them; which the Law also intends to every man, in his goods: For
my part I like not, either the changing of the stream, or of the channel of
Tithes; because it will but make it wind further off, or go more about; and
the new channel will lick up a great deal of the old stream, so that but
little will come at last to the Ministers Mill. The former course of paying
them to the Minister immediately is much easier cleared, where ever any
obstructions or inconveniences shall be found, either as to the Ministers, or
the people; How easily are far greater sums daily gathered in every parish,
without any suits at Law or trouble, by the ordinary Officers, which may in
this case easily be authorized to do for Ministers, as Churchwardens and
Overseers for the poor do in their rates and customs. The Vision of changing
the way of Ministers maintenance, or of making them receive Tithes by a mediate
lay hand, has a further State mystery and politic meaning in it, than barely
to ease the Minister and people of trouble; or to wipe off the fully and smut
of imaginary Popery, Jewishnesse, or Antichristianity from Tithes; which may,
through the hardness of men's hearts, have something inconvenient in them; but
nothing, that I can see, evil or sinful, so as to give any tender conscience
any offense, more than it would any honest man to pay his debts.

7. Tithes are too much for the Ministers.
But Tithes are too much for the Ministers to receive?

Answ. This indeed is the thorn I looked for in these halling Christians; Here
it is that the shoe pincheth envious avarice: And why too much O you narrow
souls? Their ordinary Arithmetic, at their fingers ends, tell them; that the
Ministers are not the tenth man of the land, and why should they have the tenth
part of the Increase? I answer, 1. What is freer than gift? and what wiser,
than so public and so ancient a gift, of a whole Church, and Nation
Christian; which gave to God not according to the measure of these men's thirst,
but of the largeness of their own devout hearts, and as became the riches and
honor of this Nation? The Laws of the land passed and conveyed Tithes to the
Clergy and their successors for Gods service, even then when they were
forbidden, for the most part, to marry; and enjoined to lead a single life: O
how would the munificence of those times have burst these men with envy against
the Clergy in their rich Celibacy; who repine to see them thus moderately
provided for, when they are most what charged with families, and many
relations! 2. I may retort; No more are those Lay men the tenth persons in any
Parish; who yet may have sometime the Impropriate Tithes, it may be, of ten
parishes. 3. I add, all worthy Bishop, and Ministers, that have any
competency, are never such unhospitable Nabals, as to eat their morsel alone;
many poor creatures are frequently relieved by them, and bless God for them;
after the example of Archbishop Warram, a most charitable and good man, who
being sick, asked his Steward what money was in his treasure, and being
answered there was none; he smiled, saying, It is well, it is time to go to
God: Erasmus tells of that Prelates great liberality to the poor. 4. All, but
envious eyes, see; that there is not one of ten among other men, but he has
either lands, or moneys, or some trade, and way of livelihood, which the
Ministers seldom have, being bred up wholly to their studies; nor is it fit
they should have other cumbersome employments, since that holy work will take
up the whole man; if they study to be able and faithful warriers, and not
merely popular and flourishing fencers: No man going to war intangleth himself
with the affairs of this life. 2 Timothy 2.4.
5. I might plead if not in equity, yet in pity; few Ministers in England now
are single men; choosing rather to live among Gods cares and thorns, and the
encumbrances of honest and honorable marriage; then either in concubinary
scandals, or other ways of luxury and lubricity; which are the devils cushions
and featherbeds: Not, but that the godly and learned Ministers of England do
highly honor that Celibacy or single life, which is indeed a redemption of the
soul from secular attendance and cares (with Martha) to a vacation for God and
his holy service, with Mary; Luke 10 41.
we condemn not the ancient or modern devotion of any in this kind; when either
distress of times enforce it, or purpose of heart does choose it: Not as a
refuge and easy support of life; (...). 1 Cor. 7.26. (...). Nis. de Virg. Non
imperanda est virginitas, sed optanda* Quae enim sunt supra nos, sunt in voto
magis quam magisterio. Amb. de Virg.
but as an exercise of penitence, mortification, charity, devotion, and
heavenly meditation; not upon presumptuous confidence, or friends persuasion,
or fond superstition; but upon mature deliberation, humble resolution, and good
experience of that gift obtained; which is able so to subject nature to the
Empire of grace, the body to the soul, the flesh to the spirit, carnal and
sensual imaginations, to divine and spiritual 1 Cor. 7.7.
contemplations; repressing innate flames by holy servencies, so as preserves
the purity both of body and mind, together with the title of virginity; so
that votaries, (not strict and presumptuous, or peremptory and absolute; but
conditionate, upon humble, and modest suppositions of that gift and mystery,
which Mat. 9.11, 12.
God only can give them over themselves, in order to an holy Celibacy) have yet
power of that Liberty, in some cases, to be enjoyed, which the great and wise
Creator has allowed to humane infirmity: without any reproach either to
Himself, (who is the God of Nature, as of Grace; of the Body, as of the Soul;
of the flesh, as of the Spirit;) also without any uncomely or dishonorable
reflection upon any of his servants, who thankfully and holily use that his
divine indulgence. Nil predest carnem habere virginem, fimente mipseris. Jeron.
ad Heliod.
We like the golden chain of Celibacy, when it is sincere; not copper gilded
over, but pure gold throughout: when it is as an ornament or bracelet, which
may be taken off, if need require; and not as fetters or manacles so strait, so
heavy and so severely sodered on, as weak nature cannot bear, and true Religion
does not impost.

There have not been wanting many learned, holy and excellent Bishops and
Presbyters in this Church of England since the reformation, who have glorified
God, not in a cl^istered and vowed, but yet in an unspotted and voluntary
Celibacy; Pura and perpetua virginitas est perseverans infant^a. Cyp. de Bo.
Pudic.
as others have in an holy and allowed Matrimony: Both of them abhorring those
preposterous presumptions, rash affectations, necessitous snares, and rigid
impositions of a single life, upon our selves or others; which make many
votaries like fair apples splendid to the eye, but rotten at the core. We find
that of ten Virgins, Matthew. 25. Non carnis solum sed and ment^s integritas
virginem facit. Amb. 1 Cor. 7.39.
five were foolish. Flesh will putrify in a close cupboard as well, as if it
be abroad, unless it be thoroughly seasoned with salt. A Cloister is no
security to chastity, unless there be such a measure of grace, as may keep
from secret pollutions, no less then from public putrefactions; wherein who
so finds himself so frail and defective, that he cannot conquer and command
himself; it is both wisdom and piety for him, or her, rather to choose Gods
Purgatory of marriage; than the devils Paradise of a Monastery: rather to sleep
on Gods holster, stuffed with thorns, or hard as Jacobs stone at Bethel, than
to repose on the devils pillow, stuffed with down; Fullness, ease and idleness
breeding and nourishing infinite swarms of lusts, which may be hived up, as so
many Drones, Wasps or Hornets, in those receptacles, which pious munificence
intended only for piety and purity; not only in the title, but truth of
Virginity. Experience of later ages has much abated the glory of enforced
Virginity, and vowed celibacy; restoring to Christians, and to Ministers as
well as others, the honor and liberty of holy marriage; which is by the Heb.
13.4. 1 Timothy 3.2. 1 Tit. 1.6.

Canons granted to Bishops and Presbyters as well, A bishop must be the husband

as to any other Christians; and so used and taught in Primitive times: as
Clem. Alexandr. tells us. Against which, by a preposterous imitation of that
celibacy, or single life, (to which the persecuting extremities of primitive
times drove many holy men and women; that so the Gospel in its first planting
and propagating should not want, (among other Miracles) this of holy men's and
women's chastity and severer virginity, in desert cells and solitudes first,
after that in Convents and Monastic societies) some men's after zeal and
emulations, so superstitiously cried up virginity, as injuriously to cry down
the honor of marriage, especially among Churchmen.

Which yet was not done, without much opposition, and remonstrance to the
contrary, by many holy men, in those times; Among which, Socrat. hist. eccl. l.
1. c. 8.
most remarkable was that of Paphnutius; a Confessor, and worker of Miracles;
who had lost his right eye for Christ's sake, whom Constantine the Great the
more loved and reverenced for that glorious defect; He in the Council of Nice,
(where many holy men out of no ill mind, but thinking it would tend much to
the honor of Christian Religion, to continue those strictnesses of Virginity
in the Church, in the times (now) of peace and prosperity, which had so adorned
it in times of persecution; that so it might not seem a matter of necessity,
compelling, but of devotion, choosing a single life) he vehemently opposed what
was proposed touching making of Decrees and Canons against the marriage of the
Clergy; showing by Scripture and ancient practice, the lawfulness of marriage
in Ministers of the Church; and the many not inconveniences only but
mischiefs also which would follow such prohibitions; whose holy and weighty
reasons then swayed the Council, (...). Is. Pel. Ep. l. 3.
that they made no such injunctions touching the Celibacy of the Clergy, which
after times plentifully cast upon them, as so many chains and snares; which
proved no less to the dishonor and stain as of the Ecclesiastical order, so
of all Christianity, than the primitive freedom of virginity or marriage had
advanced the honor of both.

In both conditions of life we think a pure and chaste mind the best rule or
measure; Ut Ecclesia, ita and foemana virgo esse potest de castitate quae matter

holy Virginity, wrought after those primitive patterns, and pristine originals
of sublime severities in holy retirements; yet withal we give that due honor
which holy antiquity, the blessed 1 Cor. 7.^.
Apostles, the sacred Scriptures, Christ and God himself have given to
marriage; which has also its divine beauty and comeliness, however it be set
in a plainer frame of more familiar conversation, domestic cares, and secular
business.

That of St. Jerome (whose holy heats many times made his pen boil over) was an
hard saying; while I do the duty of an husband, Jeron. Contr. Jovinianum. Quam
diu impleo mariti officium, non impleo Christiani. Aust. Ep. 89. Ad majora sic
excitat Apostolus, ut minora non damneta
I cannot discharge the duty of a Christian: St. Austin with more calmnesse and
judgment, upon the words of the Apostle ( He that marries not does better, 1
Cor. 7.38.) tells us, The meaning of the Apostle is, so to excite to higher
pitches of piety in a single life, as not to condemn the lower fourm of
marriage; And certainly St. Jerome, Jeron. Epist. ad Furiam.
who was so mighty a champion for Virginity, or single life, would never have
so highly advanced that above and against first or second marriage, if he had
lived to have seen how much the after softness and delicacy of votaries had
degenerated from those primitive strictness and severities, which St. Jerome
requires: Or, Impossible est nnatum medullarum calorem in animum non
incurrere, etc. Ieron. Illa sola virginitas Christi hostia, cujus nec carnem
libido, nec mentem cogitatio maculavit. Jeron. cont. Iovin.
if he had calmly and charitably considered those violent impulses of nature,
to which others may be as subject, as he confesses himself to have been even
in his cremeticall life; and yet furnished it may be, with far less gift of
continency to deny and overcome them, than that holy man had; who yet carried
not the Trophies of his so much magnified virginity, unviolated to his grave.
Or, lastly, if he had lived to have seen, and heard the fedities and abominable
obscenities, which afterward rendered many Monasteries, and Nunneries, as the
devils sinks; cages of most unclean birds; and channels of all impudicities;
rather than Gods cabinets of Jewels; or the Churches crystal springs; or the
Angels rivals, and emulators; or the followers of Jesus Christ; As those his
primitive servants in their persecuted and unspotted purity did, who chose
purity with poverty, and chastity with necessity in any condition, married or
unmarried, rather than splendid sordes, and hypocritical pretensions; which
the more they mock God, and delude the world, and ensnare unwary souls to
dreadful inconveniences; the more they fear men's consciences, and damn men's
souls; yea, and when those dunghils strowed over with the roses and lilies of
chastity, and virginity, come to be trurned, and discovered, who can express,
or expiate the infinite shame, dehonestation, and infamy, which they bring to
Christian Religion?

But this large digression by way of vindicating of the lawfulness and honor
of Ministers marrying, (which a far more eloquent and polite pen of a learned
Bishop has formerly done beyond my praises) is so far venial, The reverend
Doctor Hall, Bishop of Nor-
as it was more necessary to plead for a settled and competent maintenance for
them, now, when they enjoy the liberty, and bear the burdens of married life;
To whom supplies far more, than that of Tithes, were granted then, when under
the restraint of Celibacy; which yet was shrewdly blemished by concubinary
convivences; which was the best of those evils, which much wasted the credit
and honor of the rich and unmarried Clergy in those times.

To speak plain English, I suppose that those objecters and projecters against
Tithes, and so against any settled competent maintenance of Ministers in this
Church, (saving those impulses of covetousness, and temptations to envy, which
are natural in them) are set up, and animated, by such Antidecimal proposals
and petitions to drive the Jesuits nails home to the head: That they may urge
for the more peevish, politic or superstitious Papists this sharp argument of
poverty, indigence, beggary, or dependent necessity; which will be the
strongest reason in the world against Ministers marrying; (Against which
nothing from the mind of God in the Scriptures, or the practice and judgment
of holy men in primitive, and purest times can be, with any color of Truth,
alleged;) But the poverty of Ministers will, beyond all the Sophistry of
Bellarmine, without any injunctions, or vows of Celibacy, either bring forth an
unmarryed, because a necessitous Clergy; or else none at all, that shall be
worthy (for learning, just confidence, and due authority) the name or place of
a Minister, in this sometime so famous and flourishing a Church; whose honor
even among its enemies, as well as friends, was not the least in this, That of
all reformed Churches it had least sharked from the maintenance and honor of
the Ministers; but maintained them in great part, worthy both of them, and it
self. Alas what hedge creeping creatures will the Clergy of England soon come
to be in the next generation; when nothing shall encourage the parents, or the
children of any wife and provident men, either to fit them for, or to undertake
such an office and calling, as will take up the whole man; and yet afford
little or no maintenance; and that not settled, but arbitrary, and depending
upon Mechanic or feminine bounty; where he that has most craft, and can best
crowch or flatter, shall have the best living; not according to his merit, but
his cunning. This policy of starving the learned and married Clergy of this
Church, (making this rich and plentiful land as those desolate and in
hospitable Islands of old were, whither many learned Bishops and Presbyters
were oft-times condemned and banished by the command of cruel persecutors)
will soon make room for the Priests and Seminaries of the Roman party; who
will easily supply this Nation with a better fed and better taught Clergy, than
ever these hungry projecters against Tithes will be able to afford; who, as
they shall be less pinched with want, or debased to sordid shifts and
complyings; so they will be far better stored with learning and al abilities,
which may recommend and set forth the doctrins they teach, and the place or
function they pretend to: Nor will it be the effect of their policy, in order
to advance the Papal Monarchy, more than of their piety and charity rather to
draw and confirm the people of this Nation to the Romish profession and
subjection, (which has much in it of learning, devotion and Catholic verity
and order) rather then to suffer poor people to be led by blind and base
guides into all manner of ignorance, and extravagancy in Religion.

So then in all sober and impartial reason, how can Tithes, as now they are
pared, be or seem too much for the work or charge of the Ministry? save that
to envy and avarice all, Iuvido omne alienum bonum nimium videtur. Tull.
that is another, seems too much: Sure if these men had been Lay Pa^^sts,
nothing would have converted them from Popery so much, as to have seen the rich
lands, the goodly revenews, the plentiful tithes, oblations and donaries,
which are there paid to their Bishops and Churchmen, without any grudging, yea
with much conscience, by the people, (who in that point are very commendable,
as in a matter of justice, gratitude and devotion; whose sincerity is never
more tried, than, when it makes men conqu^^^rs of covetous desires;) And truly,
in this part of a free and liberal spirit, most Papists are far beyond these
men, who make so great a stir with their thrifty reformations, who are still
driving the bargain so hard, with God and their Ministers, even in those
matters, which concern their souls, Triobolares Christiani.
that all their piety cannot be worth three half pence, since they grudge, if
their Religion cost them one penny; This wretched temper, as it is little to
the honor, so little to the advantage of the reformed Religion; That men
should be always thus sharking upon God, and his Church, under shows of piety.

8. Covetous reformers the greatest hinderers of reformation.
And truly, I am strongly of this heresy, against all these penurious
reformers; That nothing has more nipped, and hindered the progress of true,
and necessary reformations in this western world, (as to matters of doctrine,
discipline, and manners) or will occasion a greater relapse and Apostasy, than
these sacrilegious projects and covetous principles, with which the Devil has
always sought to blemish and deform, that which is called (and justly in some
things) reformation. Many reformers are but kites, though they sore high, yet
they have an eye to their prey beneath; some men still so propound and manage
Church reformation, as if it could not take place in any Church, without
devouring all the lands of the Church, and beggering all the Churchmen; That to
be reformed, never so well in doctrine, and manners, would not serve the turn;
unless the Clergy suffer those Lay cormorants to devour all; and to reduce
the State Ecclesiastic, every where, 1 Timothy 5.19.
from that dignity and plenty, (the double honor, with which pious
predecessors endowed them) to beggarly and shameful dependences; even upon
those men's courtesies, from whom, (when they have truly hunted, and by learned
pains gained a just reformation in points of doctrine and outward manner of
religion) yet they shall as Ministers be then rewarded with nothing, but the
very garbage, some poor and beggarly stipends: It is very probable, that the
wholesome waters of true Reformation (which by the confession of many of the
learned and moderater Romanists, was in many things of religion necessary among
them) had been willingly ere this drunk by many of the Romish party; if this
Sacrilegious star (which may well be called wormwood, Revel. 8.11.
although it seem to burn as a lamp) had not fallen upon the waters of
Reformation; of which many in Germany, and other places have dyed: because they
were made bitter with such sacrilegious and sordid infusions; Reducing their
reformed Ministers to such necessitous and beggarly ways of life, that could
be little to their comfort, or to the honor of their profession; and, no doubt,
infinitely to the other men's prejudice and abhorrency of, what they so called,
their reformation.

Indeed it will be hard to persuade wise and learned men (how ever in other
points of controversy they may be convinced, and willing to agree with the
Reformed Churches) that they must without any other cause, but this, that they
belong to the Church, presently forsake, and forfeit their lawful and goodly
possessions to some men's unsatiable sacrilege, who make Church Reformation,
but the Lay men's stalking horse to get estates: Men do naturally choose to
attend on fat and ointed errors, rather than on lean and starved truths: Ita a
natura ficti sunt h^mines, ut pingu^s potius sectentur errores, quam macilentas
veritates.
Nor does any thing render the Christian and reformed Religion more dreadful
and deformed to the view of the ingenuous, and better bred world, than when it
is set forth like the Gorgon, or Medusaes head, compassed with sacrilegious
Serpents, and circled with the stings of poverty and contempt; threatening by
poisonous bitings quite (at length) to destroy and devour all true piety: Then
which, nothing is less envious of others enjoyments, or more prodigally
communicative of its own: The word of Christ, bidding Christians sometimes,
Matthew. 19.25.
as that young man, to forsake all and follow him, does not oblige always; nor
does it become these men's mouths, who care not, who follow Christ, so as they
may get the spoils of his naked followers: Reforming Christians cannot sin
more in themselves, and be a greater temptation to others, (hindering them from
due reforming) than, when by their covetous principles, and cruel practices,
they shall so^re men from true reformation; and indeed from all good opinion of
such men's religion; who in the peace and plenty of all other estates and
degrees of men study to recommend piety to Church men only, attended with
poverty and contempt: As if Ministers could not be godly, Ministers ought to be
by their liberality, as Synes. was called, (...).
except they were beggarly; nor worth the hearing, till they were not worth a

scoffs of Julian, when he robbed the Churches and the Christians, He did it

which they are always stretching out against God and his Prophets; Christ and
his Ministers: Although piety be a Jewel to be taken up, where ever we find
it, though in the dust of poverty; and Christ is beautiful, when he is
stripped: yet none, but rude and barbarous hands would treat Christ in such a
manner, as exceeds their wanton cruelty, who crucified him; for when they Matt.

parted his garments among them, they did not own him for their Savior, or the
Messiah, as these self-inriching reformers pretend to do.

St. Peter did to Simon Magus, Your money perish with you; No, I rather wish
your Salvation, (if possible) though it be without the restitution of, what you
have already and intend further to rob Christ of, and his Church, and his
Ministers; and his poor too: (for they had a good share in the Churches
revenues;) Only I wish withal, that all the learned and godly Ministers of the
Gospel in England, were in such a condition, as to worldly competency, that
they could preach the Gospel freely; that so these repiners might hear them
gratis, (as most of them do when they vouchsafe to hear them) and so without
prejudice, or grudging at the maintenance of Ministers in point of Tithes; That
so, if it be possible, they may repent, and be converted from that gall of
bitterness and bond of iniquity, in which they are; It were happy if (as St.
Austin offered to do) all Ministers could release, Ne invidia Clericis
obveniat de p ss^ssionibus Ecclesiae obtulit pl^bi Augustinus malle se ex
cellationibus vivere ut antiqui. Sed Laici ill^d accipere noluerunt. Possid.
vita Aug. c. 23.
that equitable, and Evangelicall power, which they have by Scripture; and that
legal right, which the law of the land has given them, to demand and receive
Tithes, and other emoluments: That their necessities might not force them
(having neglected all other ways of getting, or improving estates, that they
might fit themselves by their studies for this great work of the Ministry)
either to take Tithes; or (which of all things is most detestable to men of any
ingenuous spirits and learning) to depend upon vulgar contributions; which are
so stuffed with pride in the givers, and contempt toward the receivers; so full
of uncertainty; and so certain high ways to baseness, and beggary (as the
genius of most men now is) that there are few Mechaniques, who would not
disdain to be such Ministers; as must, when they have done their work, beg for
their wages; and shall be sure to want them, unless they always abound in
sordid complyances and flatteries, with the vilest men, and their vilest
humors: For however people have now and then a warm fit of giving to their
Teachers, yet it seldom lasts longer than the heat of some factious design or
new fancy melts and thaws them: After that, they soon return to that
frozennesse, which is hardly dissolved by any man's warmest breathings, to some
few drops, of incompetent, yet insolent, and supercilious contributions.

But I am afraid our distemper is deeper, and more subtly dangerous to our
reformed Religion, than we are aware of, in this point of Ministers
maintenance; The burden is not, That Tithes are paid (for that these
projectors do not intend to quit so (either to Landlords or poor Tenants:) but
that they are paid to the true and ordained Ministers, that thereby they are
still continued, and encouraged in their Ministry; The grief is, that as they
receive them, so every where they deserve them; The vexation of that is, that
Ministers are not yet driven out of their hives; as Bees after all their
labors; by the smoke of some such sulphurous projects: that so these hungry
Reformers, and new stamped Preachers with their Jesuitick arts and insinuations
may possess their honey; The displeasure of some men is, that any Ministers,
worthy of that name and calling; or that any thing of good learning, of
studious abilities, of real gifts and due authority, of the true reformed
Religion, and piety, should still remain in this Church of England, which might
hinder its return to the Romish subjection; of which those wiser agents despair
not; when there shall be no better Ministers, than such, as either the vulgar
charity maintains, or the vulgar choice ordaines.

As for Ministers superfluities and excesses, 9. Answer to the cavil of

which some men rather talk of with envy, than prove with truth; God knows,
few fishermen take fish now with money in their mouths, there are not many
golden cups found in any of their sacks mouths; such as may tempt them to any
splendour or prodigality; Alas, the most of them have scarce for bonest
necessities: Look to their poor widows and fatherless children, commonly,
their greatest portion is Gods mercy, and man's charity. And (to the shame of
this Nation; so blessed of God and Nature with abundance) many of them are by the
tenuity of their Benefices, kept far enough from exercising that hospitable
largeness, which many of them have in the Theory and speculation, but cannot
practice it; which is so commended by the Apostle Paul, 1 Timothy 3.2. Tit. 1.8.

and required in a Bishops and Ministers way of living among men; as having,
not more a face of humanity with it, than of Divinity: (it being the glory of
God to be of a bountiful munificence and liberal goodness) as carrying a
sweet savor with it, making the Ministry of the Gospel, as a fragrant
ointment poured out; much recommending the Gospel to men, when they can hear
Christ's Word, and taste of his loaves too; Besides, it gives a great advantage,
and useful authority to Ministers in the places, where they live; renders
their counsels more considerable; their examples more venerable; their doctrine
more acceptable, and more credible; for nothing more justifies, what we preach
of Gods bounty and great gifts in Christ, to poor men; than, when they see
religious men, and chiefly Ministers, most liberal of this worlds goods; as
believing, they have treasures laid up in heaven; which Manus pauperis

the poor hand man's (which is Gods box) carries thither: And indeed considering
the great numbers of poor in many or most places of England now abounding; and
the retrenching of most men's estates both in trade and house keeping, it were
no more, than needed; if Ministers, (who are constantly resident among the
poor) were able also, to be some way relievers of them, beyond bare and barren
words of godliness; which signify little to those, whose bellies have no
ears when they are pinched with urgent and extreme necessities.

Nothing should be less illiberall, than true Christian Religion; which sets
forth the highest bounty of God to mankind in giving Jesus Christ; Nor ever
was any thing less sordid, than Christians in former times; the many
monuments, here in England, of their religious prodigalities, and devout
excesses to the Church and to pious uses, do sufficiently testify how far
those Christians were from the niggardize and Nabalism of some men in these
times; Quantiscunque sumptibus c^nst^t, lacrum est pietatis nomine sumptus

Poverty is always attended with shame, or impudence among the vulgar: and
though it have no cloak, yet it needs one to cover its own confusion; and to
keep it from vulgar contempt: O how large hearted and liberal handed in former
times, and at present, in other Churches and Countries, is that Religion, which
is commendable as it is Christian and liberal, however reformable as it is
blameable for the taints of error and superstition, which have, in many
things, infected it! What has more splendour, what more plenty, what more
superfluity, than those that are of the Roman Clergy? who have more vacancy to
their studies, Qui mirantur op^s, qui nulla exempla beati Pauperis esse putant.
Iuven. Sat. 14.
devotion, and public duties, than their Ecclesiastics, or Church men, of
all degrees? who have learned to use now those things, far better, than it may
be former luxury and dissolution did; which occasioned, many worthy men's
complaint of the abuses and faults; but not their envy at the enjoyments? The
moderation of the English Church in this part of Reformation was at first very
nobly commendable; and most worthy of the generous piety of this Nation; which
did not deny or grudge Church men to have good and great maintenance, or
honor, but only required that such means should still have good Ministers.
They never applauded, as these new Projecters do, for a most heavenly Oracle,

as if it had been poisoned when enriched: Nor did they think Religion
thoroughly reformed, till it was starved; nor Ministers mended enough, till they
were stark naked, or flead. Nor had heretofore the common and plain hearted
people those pestilent principles, which now the dregs of men have here in
England taught them; That an hundred pound a year is more than any Minister can
well spend or deserve; It were good that these men would first try themselves
that measure which they mete to Ministers. Certainly nothing is too little for
Church men, if they lead men to fal^e gods, or to a false worship; but nothing
too much for them, if they teach men to serve the true God, in a true way.

Nor may these poor spirited men object against Ministers, 10. Answer to the
poverty of the Primitive Clergy.
the poverty of the primitive Apostles, Bishops and Presbyters; when the times,
and the estates of Christians are now much changed from those difficulties and
necessities, which then pressed upon all sorts of Christians; To be sure, if
Christian people gave not then much of their own estates to their Ministers;
yet, they never thought of taking away, what their Ministers had, as being too
much for them; But, there is no doubt, that one beam of Christian love, bounty
and respect, in after settled and plentiful times, (which were very pure and
primit ve too) was more warm and comfortable to their Bishops and Presbyters,
than all the large streaming tails of these modern comets, and meteors of
Reformation; whose malign and d^refull aspect against Ministers and all Church
men, is no way recompensed by those prodigious shows, and pretensions of
propagating the Gospel, or furnishing the world with purer and brighter
shinings, than ever were in the Church; who shall be lamps without oil, and
shine without sustenance. Ministers are stars in Christ's right hand, Revel. 2.
but not in that sense, that they need no fuel to nourish them, in a natural
and civil life: Such interpretations of Scripture, and such entertainment of
Ministers in the Church, will soon eclipse, or extinguish truth and charity,
honor and gratitude, in the reformed Churches, and in all Christian
professors; not only to man, but even toward God, who as he has ordained
Ministers to impart to the people of their spiritual things, so also he has
commanded people to Romans 15.27.

not deceived, God is not mocked, etc.
true Pastors and Ministers, of all their temporal good things: But it is in
vain to urge Scriptures, to covetous hearers and Sacrilegi^us mockers of God
and man: Nothing is more Apocrypha to those misers, than such texts, as command
honorable maintenance for the Ministers of the Gospel; first recover the
primitive bounty and charity of peoples hearts and hands to the Clergy, before
you reduce the Clergy to primitive uncertainty.

But why do not these muck-worms and no men (who would gnaw the very bones and
carkases of Ministers) with the same teeth bite at other men's estates as well
as Ministers; which are far greater every way; who yet do less service to the
public, either to God or man, to Church or State, than the able and faithful
Ministers do; since these whining objectors have such a pain and wringing
colic in their bowels against Ministers having any settled competent and decent
way of maintenance, why do they not as well complain, that the Captains,
Commanders, and Military officers, who draw more immediately from the peoples
purses) have too much for their pay? why do not these men propound, that there
should be nothing but parity, and poverty among the soldiery? That they should
depend on peoples benevolence, for their salary and pay? Yet they see that even
to these military men's entertainment, the poor Ministers must pay; not a
tenth, but of a fifth part of their small, hardly earned, and hardly gotten
means, arising from their ill paid tithes: which are but the wages of their
work; yet they are rated in taxes, as if their livings were their inheritance;
when all is but for life, and to many of them not so good, as an ordinary
troopers pay; few so ample, as an ordinary Foot Captains: And, as for higher
Commanders, and Colonels, all men know, they have Military Denaries, and armed
Bishoprics; enjoying much more, than is by some men thought fit for any Bishop
and Clergy man; who (with their leaves, and without disparagement to any of
those sons of thunder) had and have as much learning, true worth, and industry,
to merit their large entertainments of the public; and they had no less
grace and true wisdom to use them, to the glory of God and the benefit of
others, than any of these, who are so much the favorites of Bellona, as to get
what they merit, and to keep what they have gotten.

But these Antidecimists who seek to eat through the Bowels of their Mother the
Church, dare be bold and show their teeth only against Ministers, and their
maintenance by Tithes, (which may be easily proved as lawful as any taxes
are:) They know well, that the soldiers frowns and swords command their pay,
and so are able to curb these men's spiteful tongues and griping hands: only
they think they may safely vent their passions and poison against the despised,
dejected, and unarmed Ministers; greatly crying out against their small
salaries, which no doubt cost these men least, who speak loudest: who
preferring, by a most sinful and brutish judgment, the welfare of their
bodies, before that of their souls, grudge to have any, so good rewards
allowed to the Physicians of men's souls, as are publicly granted to the 20.
^. per diem, is a Physicians pay. Heu quam periculosus est iste morbus, quum
and infirmitates suas amat, and medicos suos odio habet agret^^.
Physicians of men's bodies, in the Army. Yea, these men are so in love with
their spiritual diseases, that they hate their spiritual Physicians: and had
rather content themselves with any cheap leaches, or perish in their feverish
ravings, than be at any cost for cure, by learned and able Ministers.

But these Antidecimists have a fit of charity upon them, 11. The Antidecimists

which troubles them the more, because they are not wonted to it, in regard of
other men; (for their charity not only begins, but altogether stays and ends
at home;) O the poor Farmers (they say) find it heavy to pay Tithes, to the
Ministers! Answ. And will it not be as burdensome to them, when they shall pay
them to some Lay exactors; who will be as rigorous to the full as ever
Ministers were? But the husbandman is discouraged, and disabled in his tillage,
and husbandry by paying the tenth of his increase to the Ministers. Answ. What?
more now then when they shall be paid to other men that shall be in office, to
gather them, or to compound for them? when did any countryman find himself
poorer at the years or life's end, Massoreth sep^^ Legis. Divitiarum sepes

who made conscience to pay his Tithes to the Minister? which was ever thought
by the Jews, (and is no error I think among Christians) to be as a hedge, and
blessing to the rest of that estate which a man has; It Is certain a Christian
man enjoys the remainder with more peace, when he pays honestly that which is
due to another; but chiefly to his Minister, who has the title of the Law, and
of God and of personal merit, for his Tithes. And is it not a profound project
meriting a public reward, for a Christian to propound ways for plenty of
corn, and for a famine of the Word? So much it rules some men's Religion more to
have a good stomach, than to keep a good conscience: for these, that would
alien, or alter the right of Tithes from the Ministers; can make no scruple of
any sacrilege, while they make no bones of violating the will of the dead, and
that holy dedication, which has been made to God, by this whole Nation, and so
continued for many generations.

But they would not have Ministers Tithe coveters. Answ. No more would
Ministers have such projecters coveters of Tithes or any thing else which
belongs not to them. But I pray may not Ministers be as subject to the
temptation of covetousness, when their Tithes shall be dispensed, as an Alms
out of a common basket, by a Lay Office? (which is one of their rare and
sovereign antidotes propounded to cure the Clergies coveting) I believe their
means will not be much more satisfactory to them by that project: Sure these
proposers forget that covetousness is an Avaritia est inordinatus appetitus
boni quod alteri debetur jure; aut inordinatus amor, bonorum secularium, quae
ab ipso possidentur. Less.
inordinate desire of another man's goods, or an excessive love of ones own;
Honest men are not to be odiously branded with coveting that to which they have
aright, both by Gods and man's laws: As for the trouble, and scandal of
Ministers suing for their Tithes, and persecuting, as one calls it, their
neighbors; the proposer might have far more handsomely removed that from
people, than objected it to the Ministers; if he had with more conscience and
sincerity exhorted people to pay their Tithes as they are due, justly,
cheerfully, and conscientiously to their Ministers; so as the laws of man (at
least) command; which in things honest become the Laws or Ordinances of God; 1
Pet. 2.13.
But not a word of those exhortations to people, because nothing is like to be
got by them: Although those had better become any Christian man, that pretends
to a public piety; or presumes of a capacity to advise a whole Nation; than
to reach men first to de^in injuriously; than to scruple wilfully or weakly the
paying Tithes to Ministers; that is, to give to every man what is his due;
which is the rule of common justice; and the best project in the world to
preserve either Kingdoms, or Commonwealths in peace.

1 Timothy 3.3. Tit. 1.7.
It Is very true, it becomes Ministers least of any men to be covetous or
contentious; It is worthy of them to suffer wrong, rather than revenge it in
many cases: But if they be by such ungrateful projections and unjust
temptations put upon using the benefit of the Law, to obtain their own, the
persecution is on the Laymans side; who is taught thus, rather to put forth his
hand against the Minister, than to him his due in a fair way, in which payment
the husbandman, Farmer, or owner of the land, has no other merit, but only
this of quiet and honest payment; for the Tenth of the Increase is neither
bought nor sold, nor rented to any Landlord, or by any Farmer; God gives the
increase; Nature the land; and the Law that quantum to the Minister; as Gods
portion, and the Churches rent. Which if some country Churles refuse, or grudge
to pay to their Minister; so, no doubt, many of them, would to pay their Rents
to their Landlords, if they had but enough of John of Leydens spirits, and
Cnipperdolins principles to animate them, and arm them against paying, or
owning any thing of Landlords title or dues; There are many impure and unjust
men, who will soon style themselves Saints and the meek of the earth, if that
be a good title to claim the lands; and to inherit other men's estates on the
earth; as those false Christ's and Theudases did endeavor in Germany to the
ruin of themselves and thousands of others. Sleid. com. l. 4.


12. Vindication and satisfaction of the honest Farmer in point of T^ithes.
But by the favor of the Antidecimists, and their petitions, which pretend to
be so big with the names of whole Counties, and many sincere godly people in
the country, petitioning against the maintenance of Ministers by Tithes, that
they must needs come up to London, to lay their great Bellies, at the
Parliament House door; I do not believe (because I never saw any ground, or
had experience, to think so hardly and uncharitably of any Countrymen, Farmers
or others, that are either good Christians or honest men) that ever they did,
or do complain simply and absolutely against Tithes. Possibly they could wish,
that some things about them were better ordered, for the Ministers, and their
own greater ease; which may be soon done, if the values of them were once
brought to a just rate and certainty: and Collectors appointed, as in other
Town-rates, to gather them in, according to the compositions made in money, or
goods, by way of distress; which may as conveniently be done in the Ministers
behalf, as in any other way of collecting public rates: And if Tithes have
sinned in any thing; yet what have the gl^belands of Ministers offended? yet
there is as much ill will against them, as the other; though there be evil,
indeed, in neither, to any men, but such, as call good evil, and evil good.

Furthermore to gratify the plain country man and Farmer with plain dealing;
(who has the honor above all men in this Nation, to be the great supporters
(by their honest labor, and love) of the Ministry and Religion in this Church
and Nation) they may easily consider, with themselves, how they have no reason
in the world to be against paying, and maintaining their Ministers by Tithes:
For first, let them but take care, and pray to God for a good, able, and true
Minister, and study to profit by his holy labors, they will never grudge him
his dues in Tithes, or any thing else; for they will find they have a good
penny worth for their Tithes in the blessing of God, both on their souls and
on their estates; if paying their Tithes were wholly their own bounty and gift.
Which secondly, they may consider, is not so; but they are as a rent charged
upon their lands, beyond what they pay to their Landlords; only the Minister
has some benefit by their labors, as they have of his. 3. They ought
seriously to consider; that if Tithes were not by Law assigned to the Ministers
maintenance, and paid to them, either they will return to the Landlords, in
advance of their rents: or else be confiscated into some public Exchequer;
for the like, or the same, or other uses; But to be sure no benefit will flow
to the Farmers, or country man's purse, by the ebbing of Tithes from the Church
and Ministers.

As for the Landlords, Gentlemen, or others of estates, and revenews in land; I
know many of them scruple their having any Tithes by the way of Impropriations;
they never think they thrived the better for them; many of them if their
fortunes other ways would bear it, would willingly give them, or at easy rates
sell them again to the Churches uses; Some to their great honor have freely
restored them; whom it grieved to see so many small Vicarages, and Livings,
even ready to starve the painful Ministers in them; So that I cannot think any
true English Gentleman, that is a good Christian, would accept, or does covet
any such augmentation, which may be added with a cu^se to his revenews; by
having the Ministers portion and lot cast into the lap of his inheritance, the
benefit of which cannot be great; but the mischief of it may be very great, to
his estate, his conscience and posterity: And besides the sin; the shame,
dishonor and uncomlinesse of such acquisitions cannot be little, when once
Christians return to their right wits, from that popular madness, giddiness
and greediness which may reign for a time; who will not in sober senses think
it most unworthy of persons of honor, learning and ingenuity, being
Christians, and pretending to be more exactly reformed; that (these having
other ways fair, flourishing, and blessed estates) should sell their own, their
families, their countries and their Churches honor and happiness, (which
consists in true Religi^n, and this depends on true and able Ministers; and
these on competent and constant maintenance) as Esau did his birthright and
blessing for a mess of pottage, for some small sacrilegious additions; which
carry with them a stain to their names, a moth to their Estates, and a sting to
their conscience? Such will be the accepting of Tithes, though freely given
them, by those, who have no right to ali^nate, or dispose them, otherwise than
the will of the Donours, and piety of the Nation have settled them for
maintenance of the Ministry. And alas, how little emolument will hence arise to
splendid and conspicuous estates? Tithes like Mole hills in an Evening Sun, cast
long shadows from little heights; the noise may be great, the benefit will be
little, and the comfort none, from such morsels taken from the Altar, to which
there hangs a coal of fire, which may destroy even Eagles nests; and this with
the greatest justice of divine vengeance; when Christians consider those
robberies and sacriledg^s, tend, as to Gods dishonor, to the reproach of
Christian reformed Religion, so to the unspeakable temporal detriment of any
Church and Nation, besides the inestimable loss of many poor souls for ever;
who will soon want Ministers, that are able and worthy, if there be no other
means for them, beyond what can be expected in a shameful and precarious way
from arbitrary benevolences; which never yet failed to fail in a short time, as
an Egyptian reed, all those that leaned upon them. Indeed; it is a foul shame
for persons of honor professing Christianity to deal worse with their holy
men, the Ministers of the true God and their only Savior; Genesis 47.22.
than Pharaoh, and the Egyptians did with their Priests; whose lands they would
not buy into the Exchequer rents, no not in extreme famine; but supplied them
freely with bread, and preserved to them and their successors the lands,
dedicated as they thought to the service of their Gods; which piety that great
and good favorite Joseph approved; nor does any zeal for the true God tempt him
to unseasonable exactions, sacriledges against the imaginary and reputed gods
of the Egyptians.

And here, An address to the Gentry of England in order to the honor of the
Ministry.
while I seriously consider the many and great blessings both of minds and
fortunes, which the bounty of God has liberally bestowed on the English
Gentry; I am so far from suspecting any such sacrilegious baseness in them, as
if they gaped to make a prey of the Priests portion, to devour holy things, or
to rob the Ministry of their maintenance; That I cannot, but here take
occasion, rather to persuade those true Gentlemen, whose parts and piety,
equal their honor and estates; that they would out of zeal to the glory of
God, and love to their Savior, and pity to this Church and Nation; come in, as
the (Triarii) last assistance, and surest relief of the reformed Religion, and
of the true Ministry of this Church; which is almost overborn, and oppressed,
by the cunning and clownish clamours, and not by any true valor, worth or
virtue, of their enemies: As the Bohemian Nobility and Gentry did with great
earnestness intercede for Jerome of Prague to the Council of Constance: by
their petion, subscribed with their names. An. 1415.
Nothing would be more worthy of that ancient honor, which the Nobility and
Gentry of this Nation has gained and enjoyed in all the world, than to see now
the Christian zeal and gallantry of their spirits, therefore the more forward,
to bear up the dignity of Christ's holy Ministry, by how much they see so many
set to oppose it, seeking by contempt to debase it; and by poverty to oppress
it: presuming, that the present Ministers, (though never so learned, godly and
faithful) once over burdened with secular necessities, will not long be able
to assert the honor of their calling; nor will any after generation succeed to
inherit their poverty and pains; but only such, as shall further debase the
dignity of the function.

How glorious were it, for honorable and worthy gentlemen, Math. 27.57. Joh.
19 38. Mark. 15.43. Luke 23.50. Joseph of Arimathea: A rich man: an honorable
counsellour^ a good man and a just: also a Disciple of Christ, etc. owned
Christ dead, and begged his body of Pilate, etc.
like Joseph of Arimathea (whom good education and experience of true Religion
have matured to pious wisdom; and sober zeal) now to own Jesus Christ, when
the world is stripping, scourging, mocking, and crucifying of him; when he is
so much forsaken of those men, whose fears dare not own him; or whose lusts
aim to make a prey of him: Now to give the more honor and respect to the true
Ministry of this Church, (by which they have been baptized, and educated in
Christian Religion); when they see so many vile and illiterate spirits,
studying to debase the persons, striving to destroy the very function? This
were worthy of a true gentleman, (whom virtue and grace more then birth and
relations make such) to stand by the forsaken; to countenance the dejected; to
pity the oppressed; and (at least) to Petition and intercede for the
preservation of the true Ministry, and worthy Ministers; of whom they and the
whole Nation have had so great and good experience.

I do not think it seasonable, now, to invite Gentlemen, (where their estates
and expenses may bear it) to follow those patterns of extraordinary
munificence, which some of their rank have heretofore given them; by restoring
the Impropriate Tithes and alienated glebes to the Church; either freely, or at
an easy price; This were, now, to give sacrilegious rapine a greater
temptation; which daily gapes to devour all the remains of the Churches
Patrimony and Dowry. To add any blood now to the Churches veins, were but more
to provoke the thirst of greedy and unsatisfied horseleeches of this age; Prove.
30.15.
who cry Give, give, till they have quite exhausted the very life and spirits
of all true Religion. This motion and bounty will be more seasonable in better
times; Romans 2.22.
when Sacrilege shall be accounted (as it is) a most damnable sin, and not a
trade, or a fruit of zeal, or a flower of reformation; which by the Apostles
arguing is a more heinous sin, than that of Idolatry, in as much as this owns a
god, though false; this robs God, though true.

1 Cor. 12 31.
But behold, I show your nobleness a more excellent way: my ambition is to
propound an higher degree of Christian glory to you, the learned and religious
Gentry; which is to follow the steps of that noble Prince, Phil. Melanct. and
Camerarius: highly commend him for his piety and zeal: he died 1553.
George Duke of Anhalt; who disdained not having Ministerial gifts, to serve
Christ and the Church at Marburg in the work of the Ministry, taking upon him
holy orders, in times of the greatest contradiction against the reformed
Religion: and esteeming it greater honor to tread in Christ's more immediate
and narrowest steps, than to enjoy the more spacious paths of secular
pleasures, and State employments; If you know the excellency of Christ; the
vanity of this worlds glory; Mat 19 28, 29.
the worth of men's souls; the weight of that Crown, which is prepared for
those, that forsake all, and follow Christ; you cannot think your selves
disparaged by this my humble motion to you; Your estates will set a greater
luster now on you in the eyes of good people, than ever the great state, pomp,
plenty, and dignities of former times set upon your predecessors; who of many
of your families were Church men, and many of them very worthy ones: Where God
has given you gifts, fit for so sacred a service of him, and his Church, no
man can propound to you a more goodly province, wherein gratefully to use them;
or a more eminent way of preferment, wherewith to entertain your pious and
commendable ambition; which is most worth the pregnancy of your parts, and g
nerousnesse of your spirits; No Cedar is too tall, or goodly for the building
of Gods Temple; Nor may it disdain to descend from Lebanon to the holy hill of
Zion: and no Jewel is too rich and glorious, for Aarons breastplate; nor for
the foundations and walls of the New Jerusalem. The more splendour God has set
upon you, the more shall you reflect to his glory and the honor of that
Religion you profess, by devoting your selves to serve him, and his distressed
Church; in times, when laborers are few; and those much overburthened: If any
religious way of life might be meritorious, this would be beyond the strictest
votaries; in as much as it carries more pains and more benefit with it.

I have seen by the experience of Gods bounty, The advantages of an estate with
the Min^stry.
how great advantages an estate gives to any Minister; if God gives him grace
and wisdom with it; How it adds to his just confidence, and courage in
serving God, and guiding his people; how it redeemes him, not only from vulgar
depreciatings, mean thoughts, and worldly solicitousnesse; but also from the
temptation of flattery, popularity, and that most sordid shameful dependence
on others frowns and favors; their givings, and withdrawings. I know how much
it adds boldness, credit, and authority to a Ministers words, to his
reproofs, comforts, monitions, and examples; As the expressions of those men,
whom, not necessity of subsisting, but the conscience of doing good; the
unfeigned love they have to Christ; the firm belief they have of the Gospel;
and the value they have of men's souls, put upon the work of preaching: Then
will the country people think such Ministers of the Gospel to be in good
earnest, when they see hospitable relief of the poor, Saepius emolliunt
cleemosynarum dona, quos non commovent concionum verba. Adeo facta dictis sunt
sonantiora, and (...).
both in health and sickness, both of their bodies and souls, go along with
the Word preached: whom many Sermons, and good words will not move; some
charitable good works seasonably applied, as a hotter fire or warmer Sun, may
soften, melt and convert; To all which, your plentiful, or at least, competent
estates, piously and prudently managed, will give you greater advantages, than
most of the ordinary Ministers can have; Matthew. 25.21. Non minor est de been
tolerata paupertate gloria, quam de been collocatis divitiis. Sen.
whom for the most part necessity drives into this port of the Ministry; and
there keeps them so under hatches, or on the Lee, that they are seldom able to
adventure upon any way, further, then their country Congregation, and obscurity
afford them: who have only this glory, of being faithful in a little, and
bearing poverty with great patience.

A few persons of your rank and quality, by some such heroic and exemplary
zeal, (as so many brave Christians of old against the Saracens) would much
confound the insolency of our Antiministeriall Jannes and Jambres: 2 Timothy 3.
It would put the devil to new shifts and inventions; when he and they shall
see the Lord stirring up in a way, not usual, the spirits of gentlemen,
eminent for estates and relations; who then choose to put their hands to the
Churches Oars, and helm, when they see the danger greatest, and the tempest
blackest. You, as Hercules, may come in to relieve those Atlasses of the
faithful Bishops and Ministers, who find some men's new heavens too heavy for
their shoulders, and their new earth an unstable foundation, to set their feet
upon. Your learned humility cannot easily be seduced by popular novelties and
pretentions, to climb over the wall; Joh. 10.2.
or to break in upon the Ministry by new ways, and posternes of factious and
fanatic presumptions; but will rather choose (if God moves your hearts to his
work) to keep your feet in his way; that you may come in by that ancient and
holy ordination; wherever it may rightly be had in this Church; This will make
not only the true sheep of Christ; Joh. 10.3.
but the true shepherds also, glad to hear your voice; and to partake of those
excellent gifts, which God has given you; which study, prayer, and exercise
will daily increase upon you; It is great pity so many of your learned, and
pious abilities should lie idle, or not have employment worthy of them;
especially when they are fitted for the Lords service, and the Lord has need
of them: Do not despise the calling; though it be black, yet it is comely, as
the curtains of Solomon, though it be now forced to dwell in Meseck, and to
have its habitation in the tents of Kedar: The first founder of our holy
function, was a man of sorrows, an outcast of men; in whom the world thought
there was no form or comeliness: Affliction has reformed us by restoring
Ministers to Christ's image.

Which of you that has the true sense, what it is to be a good Christian, and
what honor it is to serve Christ in saving of souls, but will at the first
word, Matthew. 21.2.
which Christ sends, loose the Ass, (which is tied it may be to some small
secular business, pleasure, or study) and let it be brought to Christ, being
fit for his service; That so being strowed, and adorned with the richer
ornaments wherewith your condition is clothed; Christ may with the more
convenience and decency sit thereon; verse. 7.
and ride, as it were, in an extraordinary triumph to Jerusalem; and many may
follow him with Hofunnat: Blessing you, verse. 9.
that come in the name of the Lord to save them. The less encouragements you
can now expect, as Ministers of Christ, from men; the greater will be your
honor, the sincerer your comforts, and the ampler your reward from God; when
the world shall see, that you honor the work of the Ministry for the work
sake; and love Christ for himself, no less, than others do, where that
service is attended with great revenues, and dignities; There will shortly be
need (more than enough) of some Ministers, who can undertake the work, and not
want the wages; even the meanest minded men now begin to divert their studies,
and education to another way rather than that of the Ministry: finding, that
there they are like soonest to come a ground, and to dash against the neck of
poverty and contempt. A few of you (like David's worthies) furnished with due
and divine authority for the Ministry as well as with gifts; would mightily
stand in the gap, repel, and confound the vanity and insolence of those, 1 Chronicles. 27.
who are risen up to lay wast and desolate, this sometime so famous a Ministry
and flourishing Church.

But this is only an occasional digression humbly offered to those worthy
Gentlemen, who have parts, learning, piety and courage enough, to make them
dare to be good, and to do good, in so high and eminent a way, in the midst of
a degenerate and declining age, which knows not how to prise the Gospel of
Salvation, not worthily to entertain the Ministry and Ministers of it.

But to return to my former subject; The taking away Tithes will be a great
burden to the people.
it is most evident that these projectors against Tithes are no ways friends
to the Farmers, any more than to the Gentlemen and Landlords; for when Tithes
are once taken away from Ministers, and being in Lay hands, are as easily cast
into the balance of secular business, (as other Church lands have lately
been;) if then Christian people, any where would be desirous to have a true and
able Minister (and cannot satisfy themselves with those false Prophets, and
unordained Preachers which are so cheap:) truly they will find a new burden
must then lie wholly on their estates and purses; to maintain their Ministers,
while yet they must pay their Tithes other where.

These just considerations, and most undeniable reasons, have already made the
honest Yeomen so wise, as in stead of petitioning against Tithes, to cry aloud,
to all those busy projectors: Before you take away Tithes from our Ministers,
first provide a better way for their maintenance; Exchange will be no robbery,
if it be no detriment: (that is) such as shall be neither more chargeable in a
new way; nor less comely and honorable; where a legal right may give claim
against all impediments; else vile dependents on any men's favor, or good will,
will abase both the calling, and spirit, and carriage of our Ministers, below
what is comely for them, or willingly seen by us; who know, that in our true
Ministers welfare the good of our own, and our childrens souls, under God, is
bound up. Deprive not them of that due and double honor, which the piety and
gratitude of this Nation has given to them; lest you deprive us, and our
posterity of the true Christian, and reformed Religion; which we fear to be the
aim of all those, that level against Tithes and Ministers; That so they may by
a Jesuitick back blow, unperceived, strike through the loins of the reformed
Religion, which has been for many years happily among us, and this with more
increase of true saving knowledge, and practice of piety in one century of
years, than was for many before; which blessing, next to God, we owe chiefly to
our able and faithful Ministers, who are not so our servants in the Lord, that
they should be used as our hind, or staves; but rather (as they are called,
and deserve to be reverenced) as our Spiritual Fathers, our guides and
instructers in the Lord.

Besides this, That I may wholly drown this Wasps nest, which makes such a stir
in the country, by their stinging Petitions, and buzzing projects against
Tithes and Ministers; Let them know, That it becomes no men of honesty and
ingenuity, thus to delude with specious pretenses, the credulity of the
country Farmers, who for the most part love their Ministers so well, and prise
the reformed Religion so highly, and value so much their Savior, Jesus Christ,
his holy Institutions, and their own souls; that they would utterly abhor
the bottom of these repining thoughts and projects of these murmurers against
their Ministers, if they did but discern them: Yea like Zacheus, many of them
had rather part with half their goods, than starve or lose their Ministers, and
their own souls too with their childrens and families: No, the jolly
plainness, and honest integrity of the English Yeoman, is neither so lazy and
idle, nor so sordid and illiberall, nor so cunning and hypocritical, as these
nimbler and sprucer fellows are: whose quicksilver wits, roving fancies, and
fallacious tongues, aim at new modelling all things to their advantages; and
hope with their Jesuitick pretensions and fanatic leaven to infect all sorts
of men, both in City and Country: For their design is, that all the worthy
Ministers in England should be rather starved or beg their bread, than that
they should come short of any such rare and little beneficial projects as they
have in their crowns: Hoping either to buy some glebelands and Tithes, or to
farm some part of them, or to have some Office in a new erected Tithe
Exchequer, which for a while affording some Ministers some small pensions,
afterward will serve for any secular occasions, that so Ministers being
unprovided of means, the people may be left without any Ministers.

As for that sting, which is in the tail of these projectors, that by paying of
Tithes to the Minister, the husbandman and farmer is disabled to pay Taxes to
the State, whom it concerns more, to keep up and pay a Soldiery than a
Ministry; My answer is, As the other objections savor of hypocrisy, and
self-interest, so this of flattery; These Polypusses are so cunning, as to
apply to the surest rock, and turn themselves to any color, which may be for
their safety: But, are they such wretches, as to think, that nothing will
suffice to buy soldiers swords and pistols, but only Christ's own food and
raiment, which must be sold? It seems they had rather Christ should go
starved, naked in his Ministers, than themselves be ungarded: But we hope, that
this is not the sense of any valiant, honest, or religious soldier; who knows
how to be content with his wages; Luke 3.14.
to do injury to no man; least of all to the Ministers of Christ, whom they
have not yet so learned of these men as to hate and despise, because they would
destroy them, his Ministers: And sure no soldier can have any motive against
the welfare of the able and faithful Ministers of this Church; unless they
fight against the Protestant Religion; and in stead of Reformadoes, turn
Renegadoes to that Profession, in which they were brought up.

The bottom and dregs of some men's agitations against the settled maintenance of
Ministers in this Church is, The aim of Antidecimists.
not so much to ease the people from paying Tithes, (which they shall be sure
to do, either by way of public Exchequer, or to the private purse of
Landlords, when these have bought them into their revenue;) the project is to
have no settled Ministry in this reformed Church: For these Antidecimists know
by their country Logic, which is not very good, (but there are Jesuits, who
are excellent at it) That in a short time it will follow, No settled competent
maintenance, no able or worthy Minister any where: But room enough will be
quickly made either for Seminary agitators, from forain nurseries; or for those
sorry pieces of motly predicants, and mungrill Ministers, (Centaures in the
Church, that are half Laics, and half Clericks) who are indeed but the by
blows of the Clergy, uncalled, unordained, and commonly unblest; because false
Prophets; either as to the errors of their Doctrine; or the arrogance of their
authority; whose calling, commission, and tenure, as Ministers, must chiefly
depend upon popularity, flattery, and beggary: Such despicable Mendicants, as
will in a short time make all ingenuous people weary of their iliterate
importunities; and such threadbare preachers even ashamed of themselves.

This will certainly follow in a Spanish projection, by as necessary a
consequence, as, No Sun, no day; no fuel, no fire; no oil in the lamps, no
light in the house; no pay, no soldier; no provender in the crib, Prove. 14 4.
no labor of the Oxen: yea, and the utter vastation of the reformed Religion,
as to the order, honor, and beauty of its public profession, Judge. 15.3.
will as inevitably succeed, as the burning of the corn fields did the running
of the fiery tailed Foxes among them.

But the Antidecimists would have the Ministers of the Gospel follow other
honest trades, 13. Of Ministers support by some mechanic trade.
taking upon them some mechanic or mercenary occupations, that so they might
earn their livings other ways, and preach gratis; that is, for nothing; and at
length as good as nothing, both for want of ability and authority; How would
these men rejoice to see men of learned parts, of noble minds, and of
ingenuous breeding, brought down to the level of their low form; to shine no
better, than their twinkling and unsavory snuffes; to be eminent in nothing
beyond the plebeian pitch, and vulgar proportions: that so they might spin out
their sermons at their wheels; or weave them up at their loomes; or dig them
out with their Spades; weigh and measure them in their Shops; or stitch and
cobble them up with their thimbles and lasts; or thrash them out with their
stayles, and after preach them in some barn to their dusty disciples; who, the
better to set off their odnesse and unwontednesse to their silly Teachers, must
be taught (like crazy or frantic men) to fancy themselves into some imaginary
persecution; as if in times of even too great liberty, they were thus driven
with their new found Pastors, into dens, and caves, and woods, rather than
vouchsafe to hear with the greatest ease, order, and decency the ablest
Ministers of England in those places, which are dedicated to the Churches
public use and service. Indeed the ruder way of these men's exercising their
small endowments, and discovering their great idleness, by extemporary
pratings, may well enough consist with those mechanic employments, to which
they have been brought up; and from which this their predicating now and then,
is but a sport and recreation; if it should not turn to some account for
profit; But to such men, as make the Ministry of the glorious Gospel, Nulla
res been exerceri potest ab homine altas occupato. Sen. de brev. vit.
to be their work and study, daily to fit themselves for that great and sacred
dispensation, of saving Truths, and sublime mysteries, it will appear to be,
alone, an employment, so more than enough; that there will be little vacancy to
entangle themselves in secular and inferior business; which is casting down
the stars of heaven, from their orbs and firmaments, to things terrene and
sordid, which at best are but loss and dung in comparison of the excellency of
that knowledge of Jesus Christ, 1 Cor. 2.2.
which they determine above all things to know, and make known. If the work of
the Ministry, (which is of so vast a latitude, and of so high concernment)
require and takes up the prime and flower of the time, as well as the thoughts
of the best and ablest men, that ever were conscientiously employed in it, and
all little enough; how sordid are those projects, which seek to divert
Ministers by worldly necessities, to debase their minds below that worthy
office and weighty work!

But contempt and beggary are the double honor, which these men's bounty and
gratitude would give to those, that have and still do diligently labor in the
Word and Doctrine: Either they own them not, as invested in any holy office and
divine authority; or they would have them so debased by poverty, and vile
dependency, that they might not be thought fit to be owned as such: while they
are forced to entangle themselves contrary to the Apostles Canon, 2 Timothy 2.4.
in the meanest affairs of life; hindering other poor men in their manual
trades: and receiving no other benefit of their learning and labors, but what
comes in an arbitrary way from others, or is extorted by their most illiberall
importunities: bringing down to the lowest step of disgrace the dignity of this
holy function in this reformed Church; as if Ministers were to be nothing but
an order of mendicant Friars; these beg, when they need not; but those shall
need, and beg, and have not: O how desirous are these men to have all true
Ministers, like to Christ their Master; not to have, whereto hide their heads;
while the Foxes have holes, Matthew. 8.20.
and the birds of the air have nests; Such airy, light and high flying fancies,
as these, (who like feiled Pigeons, the less they see, the higher they sore)
do daily build their nests on high, and feather them very well: Yet they could
be well content the Apostle Paul, (and all his successors, in the Ministry of
the Gospel among the Gentiles) should, either lie in the tents of their own
making, or else with the dogs of their flocks, out of doors; while they fatted,
and anointed may rest at ease, within the curtains of Solomon, and dwell in
seiled houses; to which some of them have hardly so good a title, as Ministers
have to their houses, glebes and Tithes.

Thus, these Pharaohs, dream of none, Genesis 41.
but lean cattle in the field of this Church; or, to complete the Vision, they
see the following lean cattle, which are now coming up, after the former
(which were fat and well favored devouring) them up, as if they had not been;
The new ill ordained, ill gifted, ill maintained, and every way ill favored
Ministers, will in short time (they hope) consume all those learned, worthy,
able, rightly ordained, and sometime competently, if not honorably, entertained
Ministers, which have been the glory of this Church, and Nation for many ages:
These must now give way to hungry, necessitous, crowching, and fawning pieces
of impudent ignorance; such as their Antidecimall Masters affect: as if they
thought, that the more threadbare, and hunger-starved Ministers were, and the
less wool or flesh they had on their backs, the more spiritual they must
needs be, the more like Angels or separate and naked souls; and the less
chargeable they are, the more acceptable they will be to these patrons of
avarice and sacrilege: Such are the noble, generous, and blessed projects, or
proposals of these Antidecimists, than whom, a meaner spirited subject never
exercised any ingenuous pen, nor more infested any Christian Church; not (like
gadflyes) more importunely disquited learned, godly and true Ministers of the
blessed Gospel.

O you excellent spirited, and liberal hearted Christians, 14. Appeal to the
liberal souls.
to whose candor I must still appeal, as the great incourager and comforter
(next God and a good conscience) of all faithful and true Ministers, in these
blustering encounters; Although (...) know; by too much experience, that there
are many such whining people, penurious protestants, triobolury Christian;
whose beggarly souls are prone to be leavened with the suggestions of these
Antideclinists; (who for the most part are pitiful pieces of ignorance,
avarice, and sacrilegious envy; through whom, as through whom, as through
vaults, and trunkes, the devil whispers into common peoples ears, this
Infernal Oracle, Save your purses, though you damn your souls) yet all worthy
and true Ministers, who are humbly conscious to their endeavor, to deserve
well of this Church of England, (of their own charges and all other good
people) are still far from that dejection, or despondency into which their
adversaries seek to cast them: For they still have frequent experiences of
their peoples unfeigned love, respects, and cheerful kindness to them; whose
generous piety often seems to tell their Ministers, 2 Samuel 24.24.
as David did Araunah, That they would be ashamed to serve their God, of that
which costs them nothing. Notwithstanding they have many other public
pressures upon them, (which are of a far later edition than Tithes, and of a
greater print) yet they cannot find in their hearts the least grudging, at
their paying Tithes to their Ministers; since they see no reason, why these, as
Christ's Agents, and Gods Ambassadors, should not as well deserve, and enjoy a
competent, and comely maintenance, as any public Officers, either Civil, or
Military: Who have more of power to exact, but not more of right, either humane
or divine; nor yet more of merit, to require their pays, and fees; Yea,
Ministers still dare to hope, that those in power have not any such Nabalitick
and churlish humor, as to feast those that shear, and sometimes slay the sheep;
while they starve the Shepherds: So great a confidence always arises from
the conscience of well doing

And whereas the strongest insinuations are made on the weaker minds of the
common people, by these popular orators, against the settled maintenance of
Ministers, (as if the Vulgar shall save much by the shift:) I have before
touched, and here again I inculcate it, to them, (because the sharpest goades
are pointed with profit:) That when the old Ministers are spent or laid aside,
and the former way of settled maintenance: turned to another course, there is no
doubt, but the new projected Preachers, what ever they be, (either like
mushroomes growing up of themselves; or miscalled, and misplaced by the people)
will find their stomachs full as good, as their gifts; and their digestion
full as strong, as their elocution; that when once they come to look upon
themselves, as any way settled and elected, or in any fashion ordained for
Preachers, and Pastors, (or what ever title they please to put upon themselves)
they will come quickly to plead and urge Evangelicall precepts, divine right,
and natural equity, for their maintenance; which first they will mutter, then
exact, and grudge, if they be not satisfied, from their ill fed flocks, and
scabious Congregations: And they will be prone to think, all is well in their
Churches and bodies, if themselves be but well fed, and blithe; though their
poor peoples souls be starved, their minds scattered, their consciences
crazy, their diseases many; and neither skill, nor will in their ill gifted
teachers to heal or help them: who are not likely to be very good at that
work, or cure; when from among the lowest of the people they mount to be
Ministers for a morsel of bread, and from country Farriers will needs turn
Physicians?

These men are rather of that sort, Tit. 1.11.
whose mouths ought to be stopped when they speak perverse things, for filthy
lucre^ sake, as the Apostle Paul tells us: who was no enemy to the preaching of
the Gospel: yet he approves not any false intruders, or disorderly walkers:
Every simple and slight Ass is not fit to tread out the corn, but the
ponderous and solemn Ox; whose mouth ought not to be muzzled.

There are no doubt many Jesuitick Geniusses, in England, who like the Ravens
would persuade the Sheep to starve their Shepherds, and to beat out their eyes
and brains, pretending that so the flock may feed the freer, and the fatter;
but hoping indeed, soon after, to pluck out the eyes of those weak and silly
animals, and with more safety to make a prey of them. O how far are some men
in these days, who seek thus to pull out Ministers eyes from that grateful and
affectionate zeal of the Galatians to St. Paul; Gal. 4.15.
who were ready to pull out their own right eyes to do him good; before they
were foolishly bewitched by such enchanters who pretended new Gospels, so as to
think him an enemy for telling them the Truth! verse. 16.
O how loathe are vain and proud men to think, the eggs of any opinions, which
they have laid or hatched, to be addle; or their ways erroneous! if they do
but please themselves, it matters not how they displease God, and those worthy
men, who have indeed deserved best of them.

Truly (O you excellent Christians) it would, and ought to be, 15. Hard measure
offered to Ministers by some.
a great grief and shame to the whole Order of the Ministers of England, if
they had deserved no better of those Christians in this Church, (whom they have
for many years baptized, taught, and nourished up in true religion) by all the
labors of their love; then thus to have a cup of cold water, not given to
them, Matthew. 10.42.
but taken from them in the name of Christ's Ministers. Here in they are forced
to appeal to your humility, prudence, and equanimity; whose grateful piety
has often expressed your love and value of their persons, profession and pains,
far different from, (though now not sufficient to repress) the petulancy of
these kicking Jesuruns, who in many places being better fed, than taught,
despise through much wantonness of the flesh, the bread of heaven, This Manna;
Studying nothing so much, as to make many starveling Christians and lean
Congregations, through their sacrilegious cruelty, seeking to deprive the true
Ministers of their due maintenance; that so, they may deprive the poor people
of their true Ministers; That the sins of this afflicted Nation, and
self-desolating Church being filled up, they may bring by a famine of bread
upon the Ministers a famine of the Word, and a scarcity of Ministers, upon the
people; which is the ((...)) Palladium; the thing so much desired, by the
enemies of this and all other reformed Churches.

We know well, and have always found it by sad experience, that no Adder is
deafer, and harder to be charmed, than sacrilegious covetousness; which,
(laying one ear to the earth, listening to its gain; and stopping the other with
its tail, that it may hear no noise or voice from heaven) easily eludes, and
mocks all sacred spells of the best enchanters, Psalm. 58.5.
charm they never so wisely: Indeed it is seldom seen, that any men either
private or public (for it is possible a Nation may be guilty of this sin) who
gilded over their holy thefts with the names of Religion and Reformation, ever
forbear the sin, or repented of it, or made due restitution after it: No Harp
or hand of David can play so sweetly, as to make this evil spirit of
sacrilege forsake those Saul's; whom it may possess (though they be higher by
the head than the rest of the people) as well as the lowest and meanest of the
people: whose may necessities may have greater temptation, and their
consciences less information of the evil. Indeed no man is so base, and
feeble, but he dares to adventure at this, the robbing of God, of the Church,
and the Ministers; which is a felony against the public, and to every good
Christians injury in the Church, or Nation. The reason of this boldness in
some men is, because they find, that although men of estates have quick
resentments in their particular concernments, of private profit or honor; yet
they have (for the most part) a great coldness and indifferency, Patrimonium
Crucifixi.
as to those things, which concern the Churches support, or Religions
patrimony; in scrambling for which, every man secretly hopes (unless he be of
the more honest and severe piety) for some advantage. To be sure, these great
sticklers against the Ministers maintenance by Tithes make no doubt, but they
shall lick their own fingers well, if once they can but pull them from the
Ministers; either they flatter themselves, (and I think very fondly) that as
Tenants they shall save their Tithes, from both Minister and Landlord; or else
as Landlords augment their rents; or buy some part of them; or, at worst, have
some place in a new office of gathering and distributing of them.

The great sense I have of that little, or no sense, which many men have of so
public a business, as that is, which concerns the settled support of
Ministers; and in them of all learning and religion in this Nation; makes me
sometimes prone to think it, almost a vain, unseasonable, and uncomely labor
in me, or any other Ministers, (who pretend to something of more ingenuous
spirits) thus to plead, and that publicly, with any earnestness (which seems
to draw somewhat of the dregs of meannesse) for their very bread: which, in the
unequal distributions of humane affairs, we see is not always to men of
worth and understanding; Eccles. 9 11.
whom Christian principles and patterns teach to live above earthly things; to
mind things, that are above; Col. 3.1.
to learn to want and to abound, to be content in any condition; Phil. 4.11.
And truly in this, the Ministers of England, (I think ought to have been
prevented by some other advocates, than men of their own coat; As lately my
worthy friend Mr. Edward Waterhouse, has done in his Apology for learning and
learned men: a work so honest and so seasonable, as well became the candor,
piety, and ingenuity of a Gentleman and a Christian, who has (the honor to
have) made one of the first and bravest adventures in this kind against these
modern English Saracens. And possibly many good men have a good mind so to do
even publicly; but they think it is (conclamata res) a forlorn and
desperate cause, as may be offensive and unacceptable: I almost think so too,
if some men may have their will; and therefore the rather I have been excited
to it: if it be displeasing to some, yea to many; yet I do not think, it is so
to the most, or the greatest part of Christians: I am sure it is not to the
best of this Nation, of what condition soever they be; they cannot be so
destitute of, and unaffected with, all reason, Religion, grounds of Conscience,
rules of Prudence, considerations both of piety, honor, and honest policy: In
all which they are related by their own interests to the good and welfare of
their true Ministers. As Socrates when he was reproached for having no
preferment in Athens, answered, It was enough for him to have fitted himself
for preferment; It was other men's work to bestow it on him: So the studious
learned, modest and pious Ministers of England, might well have thought it
enough for them, to have merited employment, and decent entertainment; having
with much pains, and study, and prayer furnished themselves for every good
word and work, within the bounds of their calling; It seems hard thus to be put
(many of them after many years sore labor and travail of their souls) to
plead for their wages, or livelihood; yea and for their liberty, but to work,
while it is day, in the Lords Vineyard, of this Church; wherein Christ has set
and ordained them.

Although there be a generation lately sprung up of degenerate Christians, and
ungenerous English; who would make this whole Nation like themselves, unworthy
of the very bones of those excellent Ministers, Ingrata patria ne ossa quidem
mea habes. Live. an. ur. 566.
which have lived here and merited so well of the public (as Scipio Africanus
said of his bones, when he died, banished by his ungrateful country, which he
had so preserved) yet (we hope) neither the most, nor the best of men can be so
stupid, as not to consider how much they are concerned in the continuance and
encouragement of such Ministers among them; wherein no Nation or Church under
heaven has exceeded this. However Ministers be earthen vessels, and many have
had both heretofore, and lately, great flawes and many faylings; yet they ought
in this Nation to be still highly regarded, if not for their learning,
civility, ingenuity and good society (which is to be valued in any Nation that
covets not to be barbarous) yet for their work sake; for that Gospel, that
God, that Savior, that blessed Jesus his sake, whom they truly teach; for the
holy Scriptures sake, which they so frequently, and so fully explain; for those
holy Sacraments, which they duly administer; both for the admission and
augmentation, birth and nourishment of Christians in the Church of Christ; for
the holy and good counsels, and spiritual comforts which they often give; for
the many wise stops and grave restraints to sin and error, which they
frequently put; for the public and good examples, which most of them afford,
and all should, by their place and calling; These are cords of love enough to
draw and bind all excellent Christians to them; these are places of Oratory
sufficient to make even any ordinary speaker an eloquent and potent Orator in
their behalf.

And for my own part, having taken some serious view of the estate of this
Church and the Ministers of it, both in reference to the present and after
times; both as to that real worth, which has been, and still is in them; the
excellent use of them; (...). Naz. or. 52.
and the miserable want which will be of them; I cannot but at present, be
extremely sensible of, and very much pity, those sharp, sad, and unjust
necessities, which already have and must press daily more upon many worthy men
of them, and their families, if some men's envyous and malicious designs take
place: only I hope better things of those, whose wisdom, piety and public
influence has hitherto, under God, restrained those Fountains of the great
deep, from breaking in with all sacrilegious violence upon the whole Ministry:
whose wisdom, power, or counsel, I do not any way by this Apology seek to
obstruct or prejudice, as to any thing that may be better disposed of to the
advantage of true Religion and the Church of England; which are inseparable
from a right and settled Ministry; nor can that be had without such maintenance,
as is worthy of worthy men.

If no men will be with us, but all forsake us, 17. Good Ministers hopes in
their desertions from men.
and some oppose us, as Ministers: yet we have one remedy, besides the sympathy
and charity of you, O excellent Christians; which is, patience and prayer:
Greg. Nis. tells of St. Ephraem; Though he was very poor, yet he had a mine of
rich prayers: (...). Gr. Nis. in vita S. Ephraem.
He that allows us to pray for our daily bread, and commands us to labor
honestly for it, even in this function of the Ministry; he teaches us to
believe, that he will either give it, or the grace to want it. There may be
some good 1 King. 18.4.
Obadiahs, who will feed the outed and impoverished Prophets of the Lord, by
fifties in their caves, and obscure retirements, as some have already done; and
it may be good Ministers shall then speak lowdest, when their mouths are
stopped; and be as well liking in all true grace and comforts of Religion with
Dan. 1.
their pulse, as those that feed daily on Kings provisions.

However, if we must be thus stripped and starved, to gratify the lusts of
some men; yet we hope for this mercy from God, and favor from man, that we
shall not be forced to desert our calling; or to contract a woe of not
preaching the Gospel, 1 Cor. 9.16.
while we have abilities, though we preach ((...)) though we have no public
encouragement: For why should all our studies and time be made unprofitable? It
may be, we shall, by Gods help, redeem our former defects, by after diligence
in the work of Christ: we may happily work and war the better, Verba vertas
inopera, nudam crucem nudus sequeres expeditior and levior scandis scalam
Jacobi. Ieron. Pauperesse non potest qui apud Deum dives est, Lact. Inst. l. 6.
c. 12.
when we are more expedite, lighter armed and less encumbered with envy and
worldly impediments: We may (I hope) without presumption enjoy that liberty to
preach the Gospel, which others now take to prate against it, and us; and it
may be, people will hear, and profit better, when they see they have the
Gospel at a cheaper rate: and will be more in love with the reformed Religion,
when they shall see, how much better pennyworth they have of that, than of the
Romish superstition; which is more costly by far, yet less comfortable to a
serious Christian: Though we be made poor, yet we may still make many rich;
though we have nothing, yet we may enjoy all things; though we are are troubled
on every side, 2 Cor. 6.10.
yet we may not be distressed; though perplexed, yet not in despair; though
persecuted by men, yet not forsaken of God; though cast down and cast out, yet
not destroyed, through the grace of God, which is sufficient for us; Many
worthy Ministers may justly plead for their liberties, lives and livings, as
those did with Ishmael, Ier. 41.8.
Destroy us not, for there are treasures of learning and saving knowledge with
us. But it is better for them, to be Christ's Lazarusses, and beggars, than the
worlds rich gluttons and favorites: Yet it must needs be so; Revel. 12 7.
and so it will be, unless some Michael and his Angels, overcome this greedy
Apollyon, this sacrilegious Abaddon, this penurious Devil, and his Angels, who
prodigally offers Kingdoms to damn one soul, but grudgeth one groat to
redeem many thousands.

18. Ministers just plea for their own, neither covetous, nor uncomely.
Nor will your nobleness (O excellent Christians) interpret this, which I have
wrote in behalf of the maintenance of Ministers, in this Church and Nation, to
be any pleading for Baal, or clamouring like Demetrius and his accomplices in his
panick fears, for his silver shrines and his Diana; where he considered more
his gain, than his Goddess: These are unjust and malicious glosses, which the
enemies both of the Ministry and of humanity, Act. 19.25.
are prone to put upon any, that plead nev^r so righteous a cause with words of
the greatest truth, justice, soberness, and moderation; those having a
stinking breath themselves, think every man's unsavory. But by the leave of
such latrant Orators, and back-biters, I must tell them, what the wiser, and
more Christian world well knows; that there is no cause, why Ministers, more
than any other order of men, should neglect in fair and just ways to obtain
for, or preserve to, themselves, and their successors, those worldly comforts,
and supports, which the providence of God and the Christian munificence of this
Nation has in the most free way of gift and by Law granted to them in Gods
name, and for the service of Christ, and the honor of Religion; Other men are
commended for their good husbandry, and honest care, to preserve their just
estates; which tend not so much to the public good, as the labors of
Ministers do: who may not in prudence, or conscience neglect those great, and
public concernments of Christ, and his Church, with which they are entrusted:
Yea if they should have an eye to the reward, to their own just right and
particular interests (which all other we see still have) yet it were no more
than Law and Reason, all humanity and Christianity allow; 1 Timothy 5 8.
unless they would be worse than those Infidels, that provide not for their
own families; or be as bad, as those men, who to provide for themselves, and
their families, care not to rob, and desolate even the Church and family of
Christ: Ministers may be wise, yet innocent; provident, yet not sordid;
diligent in things honest, yet not injurious to others: Nor is it any whit
uncomely for them, to crave this justice or favor from any in power; That they
may quietly enjoy those public rewards of their learning and labors, which
are injurious to no man, merited in the esteem of all honest men; and therefore
offensive to none, but envious eyes and evil minds; Being the fruit of the
public bounty, wisdom, gratitude, and devotion of this Christian Nation to
God, to Christ and his Ministers; what they have a long time by law enjoyed;
what they are rightly possessed of; and what they have no way forfeited
(unless other men's calumnies and cavils, their covetous projects and desires
of novelty, be the crime and fault of Ministers:) And lastly, they do intend
with all peaceablenesse, thankfulness, and usefulness to use and enjoy, if
God and man permit; so that no man shall have cause to repine at their
enjoyments, who knows how to make use of their gifts and labors.

The shame of pleading this cause of Ministers maintenance lies at their door,
who meditate, speak, and act so vile and dishonest things against them, as
force them, thus to vindicate their just rights, against unjust projects: which
seek by falsehood and violence to take away, not only the childrens, but the
fathers bread too, and to give it to dogs: who always have sought to bring
this reproach and scandal on this and other reformed Churches; that they still
carry on, and serve some covetous and sacrilegious design with their
reformations: When (God knows) it is not the design, nor desire of any, that
are truly reformed Christians, to robb the Church, and Churchmen of one
shoelatchet; but rather to have added necessary augmentations to them: if they
had not always been hindered by the covetousness and envy of some cross
faction, who have longed to see the day, when with Rabshakehs unclean spirit,
and foul language, Isai. 36.12.
they might see all the reformed Clergy, reduced to those sordid necessities;
which I have as much shame to write, as these Antiministeriall sticklers have
pleasure to wish it, and glory to speak it.

Our comfort in the worst of times and things is, 19. True Ministers comfort.
Multa quidem mala, sed varia sclatia. Sal. l. 9.
That we know in whom we have trusted: not in these Egyptian reeds, which may
fail us and pierce us, but in the living God; whom we have served though with
many frailties, yet with sincerity and godly simplicity; We believe he will not
fail us, nor forsake us, though men, though Christians, though reformers do;
There is not a better sign of Gods love, than to be persecuted for
righteousness sake; It is our honor, Matthew. 5.
as St. Jerome wrote to St. Austin, Heb. 12.
that the devil and his fanatic factions do unanimously hate us, and malign
us; for if they were for Christ, they could not be against us: And we find by
experience, that these Antiministeriall agitators have no such displeasure
against any men, be they never so flagitious, or their estates never so
luxuriant, as against the most orderly and deserving Ministers: So that it is
their piety and pains, which afflicts their enemies, more than their plenty;
And if they cannot strangle Christ in the Cradle, yet they hope to starve him
in the Desert.

Blessed be God, we see the end, and bounds of these men's power, and malice;
They are finite flesh, and not infinite Gods; yea they are proud flesh, lately
risen up, which God will eat off with fitting corrosives, if ever he heals this
Church and Nation; These murmurers never set us on work, nor do we depend on
such unjust masters for our wages: Though they be not converted or gathered
from their follies, Isai 49.5. (...). Cle. Al. (...). 7. Dei particeps nulli^^
indigus.
factions and separations, yet our reward shall be from the Lord, who has sent
us, and whom we have served with faithful hearts; as to our temporary
subsistence, we hope we shall never depend on these men's injurious justice, or
c^uel mercies; much less on their envious alms, and supercilious charity, who
are our enemies for the Gospels sake, which we preach: And although we should
not be protected in point of our civil rights from their despite and rage;
yet as to the honor and vindication of our Ministry, and holy function, Gal.
2.5.
we must not give place, no not for an hour, to their cavils and calumnies:
Yea we do not despair, but that we may find so much equity, and pity in some
men's hearts, in whose hands is power; that they will rather harken, and incline
to the just plea of those laborers in Christ's harvest, (who have borne the
heat and burden of the day, and who crave but liberty first to do the work,
to which Christ and the Church has ordained them; and next, which is but a
just and righteous thing, to enjoy that reward, which the Law has assigned
them) than to listen to the envious suggestions, or injurious proposals, of
those novell intruders upon the Ministry, who have yet given not the least
assurance to the wiser world, or any reformed Christians, that they in any
thing exceed, or equal the true ancient Ministers of England; nor have they
yet, by any demonstrations of modesty, ingenuity, sense of honor, or of shame,
nor by any part of good learning, (which they decry and hate,) nor by any other
useful and commendable quality, redeemed themselves, from the most sordid
passions, and saddest distempers of humane nature; nor yet reconciled
themselves to any love and value of virtue, worth and excellency in others.

We know well, that their ignorances, and errors are gross in many things,
both divine, and humane; (for how can they but err excessively, who are very
active, and for the most part both bold and blind?) Any piece of rustical
ignorance and clownish confidence serves some men's turn to oppose any Minister
withal, setting up their puppetly Teraphims, their deformed Dagons, their
Images of jealousy, in the place and temple of the living God. Among their
other errors, this, we hope, is none of their least; that they fancy and every
where proclaim, that they have so charmed with their philters and enchantments,
(which are Confections made up of ignorance and malice; pride and cruelty;
covetousness and uncharitableness together, with a perfect disdain of all,
that is rational, learned or excellent) that with these charms they have so
possessed many or most of those, in power, That they are resolved to root out,
abase, and destroy all those Ministers, who are any way eminent in learning,
courage and constancy, both for the honor of their function, and of the
reformed Religion, and of this Church and Nation; We cannot think those in
power to be so easily persuaded to be enemies to themselves and the public,
by being made enemies to true Ministers, without a cause: One of whose serious
and solid abilities, is able to do more good to Church and State in one year,
than can be hoped from the whole fraternity, and faction of those supercilious
adversaries of the Ministry, in as many ages, as a year has days; For if wise
men may guess at the future, by what they already find of them, they must
conclude, that like Fistulas and gangrened Ulcers, the longer they prevail, the
more desperate and incurable they will be, both to the Church and the State;
every day bringing us nearer, either to old Rome, or the elder Babylon: to
superstition, or confusion. For there is nothing almost in this Church of
England, as to the extern order and profession of Religion, which some of these
Antiministerials, and Antidecimists do not contest against and study to
overthrow.

Which makes me here a little digress, 20. Answer to other less scruples.
(yet not from my maine design (which is to satisfy all excellent Christians
and others, as to any thing by these men objectable against the Ministers and
Ministry of the Church of England) by looking at some lesser calumnies and
cavils, which they every where scatter among the common people, to alienate
them from, or prejudice them against their Ministers: quarrelling against the
places, where publicly we meet to serve God, and many things used by us in
our holy Ministrations; 1. Of public places called Churches.
As to the public places where Christians meet and Ministers officiate, these
supercriticall masters of words, and censors of all men's language and manners,
but their own, cannot endure the impropriety, and profaneness (as they say)
of calling those places Churches; This they scorn with very severe smiles, and
supercilious frowns; so profound is their judgment, It was the work of
Diocletian to burn all the books and destroy all the Churches of the
Christians. Eusebius. hist. l. 10.
and so scrupulous their conscience, that they had rather pull down such
public and convenient places, than venture to be defiled, by coming into
them, or once so much, as to call them Churches; they say they have far higher
senses, and definitions of a Church, than will agree with piles of wood and
stones.

Answ. We doubt not of their deep Divinity, touching a Church; which it may be,
they will not dare yet to define; as not being well agreed, what a Church is,
or what is the right matter and form or way of a Church; Much broken and
wrangling stuff they have heaped up touching a Church; but scarce one stone is
yet laid of the edifice. I have otherwhere endeavored to lead them out of the
labyrinth of their rubbidge; who have disputed more about constituting Church,
than ever they studied to be lively and orderly members, either of the highest
sense of a Church, the mystical body of Christ, (which is made up by faith and
charity;) or of that lower sense of a sociall Church, which yet is most proper
to us, and falls nearest under man's consideration; which consists of a visible
polity of men on earth professing to believe in the name of Jesus Christ; and
partaking of those holy Institutions, which he has appointed, both to gather
and distinguish, to plant and propagate, to build and preserve, to guide and
govern such an holy fraternity of religious professors, in such truth, order,
and unity; as to have a professionall relation to Christ the head; and a
communion of Charity with each other, as members of one body: which is that
Catholic Church all over the world in its several parts and branches: In
these and some other the like ambiguities about a Church as greater or less
they please themselves, spending much time to instruct their silly auditors,
how much difference there is, between these Churches of Christ, which are
spiritual, or rational; and those Steeple Houses, which we other (weaker
ones) call, most absurdly as they pretend, Churches.

O how devout a thing is ignorance! How Saraphick men, and women grow, by
having no skill in any language but their own mother tongue, which yet in this
is of our side; and being the rule of speech, every where justifies our calling
those places Churches, by the authority of the best writers in humanity, law,
history, or divinity. But that they say was an error of speech which men
sucked in with their milk: which to spend, and evaporate, these men are every
day making issues in their auditors ears; that they may unlearn that
dangerous error, and scandalous word of calling the meeting places, Churches.
I know these Rabbis scorn to be brought to their Grammars, or to any
Etymologicall authors or makers of Dictionaries; Church, K^rch, or Kerck, Sax.

(for these they reckon among the cursed spawn of learned men: and look on them
as if they were Negroes of Chams posterity) yet I cannot but make a little stay
here, that I may show them the way to that local Church; where some of them
have not been, these many years, unless it be to make a wrangling rate: For
however these be not the main Ulcers which I desire to cure; yet they are a
strange kind of itch, and scurfe of Religion, which makes many Christians often
scratch very unquietly and unhandsomely.

It is very easy, and very true to tell them, that it is no more unproper, to
call these places, where Christians as the Lords people publicly meet to
worship the Lord, Psalm. 74.8.
Churches; than it was to call the Synagogues among the Jews, Psalm. 83.12.

God; which was but for one house: namely the Temple at Jerusalem. The Saxon,

or table, is set apart for the Lords service; or for the Lords people: Does not

not the material pile; Senate and City, are used for both the persons, and the
place; so is the Parliament house for both: These Metonymies are no

or what to do, then how to give; their learning, and their liberality are
much alike.

2. 21. Of Churches as consecrated.
As it is easy to help these Infant-wits over the straw of the name, Church,
applied to the place which they will needs make a stumbling block: so with as
much ease we may relieve them, from that rock of offense, on which they dash,
against the places we call Churches; in regard of their dedication, or
consecration to sacred or religious uses: This they have only heard; This
subject is learnedly and gravely handled (as all things he undertook) by the
incomparable Mr. Hocker, l. 5. Pol. Sec. 14, 15, 16.
(it may be they never either saw or read it) yet they abominate the places for
the report; counting them desecrated, and execrable.

Here they may please to know, Vide Hospin. de Templorum Origin. Quid lapides
isti petuerunt sanctitatis habere? Ber. vid. Ser. 6.
That wise men look upon that ancient custom among Christians of setting
solemnly apart some place for the service of God, not as any affixing inherent
holiness to them, or deriving any communicative, or virtuall holiness from
them, but merely a public and solemn owning, appointing, and declaring those
houses or places to be erected, and dedicated by common consent for those holy
ends, uses, and duties, which Christians ought to intend, when they meet in
those places; Non locus hominem, sed. homines locum sanctificant. Nemo se
blandiatur de loco, qui sanctus dicitur, Bern. 182.
not for common, civil, profane, or uncomely affairs; which appropriating or
dedicating is an act of right Reason, flowing from the light of Nature, and
that common notion of reverence to be externally expressed to God, which is in
all men, that own any God: which right Reason is most agreeable to true
Religion, and always as servient to it, as Deacons, and Churchwardens ought
to be to the Ministers in holy things; as both these, Reason and Religion,
distinguish ends, duties and commands, which are divine, (as coming from God,
or relating to him) so likewise they distinguish times, places, persons,
actions, and other things, which are separated from mere humane, natural, and
civil uses, to such, as are (both preceptively, and intentionally) divine;
that is, from God and for God: Nor can the God of order (who has made the
beauty of his works to consist, and to be evident in those distinctions, which
he has set upon every thing, both in the species and individual) God (I say)
cannot be displeased to see mankind, (on whom is the beauty of Reason) or
Christians, (on whom is the beauty of Religion) to use such order, distinction
and decency in all things, which becomes them both as men and Christians; after
the examples of the Apostles and Christ himself, Matthew. 9 35.
who went about all the Cities and Villages, teaching in their Synagogues and
preaching the Gospel of the Kingdom; which also befits and adorns Christians,
as to extern profession (which is all, that appears of any men's devotion, or
Religion to the eye of man) setting forth in comely sort that duty, relation,
and service, which we publicly profess to owe and pay to God, who abhors
sordidnesse and confusion, as much as profane vastators love it.

Necessity indeed admits no curiosity of place, nor affects any elegancy,
Aegrotantium amicorum sordes toleramus, non item valentium. Sidon.
but excuses that which, in plenty and freedom, is esteemed sordidnesse, and
sluttishnesse; Religion requires externally no more, than God has given of
extern power and opportunity; where these are wanting, and by providence
denied, a sick bed, a Barn, a Lions den, a Dungeon, a Whales belly is as a
Temple, or Church, consecrated by the holy duties, which any devout soul, there
performs to God: But as the Church of Christ, considered in its extern
communion or profession, is visible; and Christians are exemplary to each
other, and to the world; it is warrant enough for Christians to build, and to
set apart to those public holy duties, some peculiar places, upon Gods, and
the Churches account; which grant we have in that great Charter and principle
of Church policy (which, like a common rule, 1 Cor. 14.40.
measures all things of extern, sociall Religion) Let all things be done
decently, and in order; Both which fall, not properly under the judgment of
Religion, but of Reason; not of Scripture, but of Nature; not of piety, but
policy or society; nor need we other command to do them, than the judgment,
and consent, or custom of wise and holy men; which we have for this use of
local Churches, thus peculiarly applied to holy services, ever since
Christians had either ability to build them, or liberty to use them, which is
at least 1400 years ago.

If humane, or Romish superstition used, or affected, or opined any thing, in
consecrating Churches, which is beyond true reason, and sound Religion, yet we
do not think, that to be a Leprosy sticking so to the walls of the buildings,
that they must be scraped all over, or pulled down, else they cannot be
cleansed; No: But, as places are not, any more than times, capable of any
essential gracious, or inherent holiness, (which is only in God, Angels, or
Men,) so neither are they capable of inherent unholinesse; The superstition is
weak on either side, and weighs little; but the worst is on this side, to which
these men so incline; which tends more to profaneness, supinenesse, and
slovenlinesse in the outward garb of Religion; which is not either so Cynical,
Sacerdoti maxim convenit ornare Dei templum decore congruo. Amb. off. l. 1. c.
21.
or so tetricall, as these men would make it. What ever there is real or
imaginary, of Superstition in the places, or rather in men's fancies of them,
who possibly ascribe too much to them, it will as easily recede, and quit them,
when they come to be consecrated by the Churches real performing of holy
services, or public religious duties in them; as dreams do vanish, when one
awakes; or as the dark shadows of the night depart from bodies, when the Sun
comes to shine on them, or into them; if these poor objectors minds and
spirits, could as soon be freed from those profane, superstitious and
uncharitable tinctures, (with which they are, as with a jaundise deeply
infected, against those places, and against those that use them, with the
decency, becoming duties done to the Majesty of God, and in the presence of the
Church of Christ) as those places (justly called Churches) may be freed from
all misapprehensions, of their name, of their dedication; If the former were as
easy, as the latter; both local and rational, material and mental
Churches, both places and persons, might long stand and flourish; Psalm. 74.6.
Both which some furies of our times seek utterly to break down, and demolish,
that there may be neither Christian Congregations, nor decent Communion in any
public place, beyond the beauty of a Barn or Stable.

But these men have so much tinder and Gunpowder in them, against Ministers,
22. Answer to other quarrels against Ministers public duties.
that, whatever they enjoy, say, use, or do in their function, be it never so
innocent and decent, yet they kindle to some offensive sparks, or coals, and
flames against them: As if all the Ministers of this Church knew not what to
do, as they should, till these new masters undertook to School and Catechize
them.

If any Minister prays publicly with that gravity, understanding, and
constancy, either for matter, words, or method, which best becomes a poor
sinful mortal on earth, when he speaks to the God of heaven; It is (they say)
but a form, and a stinting of the Spirit: If they preach with judgment,
weight, exactness, and demonstration, of truth, it is not by the Spirit; but
of study and learning, If they read the Scripture, it is but a dead letter, and
mere lip-labor: If they celebrate the Sacraments with that wisdom, reverence
and decency which becomes those holy mysteries; they quarrel at the place, or
time, or gesture, or company, or ceremonies used; Not considering that
Ceremonies in Religion, are like hair, ornaments, though not essentials; and
ought to be, neither too long, lest they hide and obscure it; nor too short,
lest they leave it naked and deformed: Since the end and use of them is no
more, but to set forth piety with the greater comeliness and auguster majesty
to men. If they name any Apostle, Evangelist, or other Christian of undoubted
sanctity, with the Epithet of Saint, they are so scared with the thought of the
Popes canonizing Saints, that they start at the very name so used: as if it
were an unsanctified title; and not to be applied to the memory of the just,
which is blessed, but only arrogated to some persons living, who frequently
and ambitiously call themselves, and their party, 2 Timothy 1.13.
The Saints: If they use the ancient Doxology, giving glory to the Father, Son,
and holy Ghost, which all Churches, Greek and Latin, did; the Socinian and
Arian Ears of some men are highly offended at it: as if Christians must ask
them leave to own the holy Trinity, and to give solemn public glory to the
Creator, Savior, and sanctifying Comforter of the Church. If Ministers use
those wholesome forms of sound words, which are fitted to the memories, and
capacities of the meanest hearers; containing short summaries of things to be
believed, practiced, or prayed for; as in the Creed, the ten Commandments, and
the Lords Prayer; Presently these men fancy them as the recitation of some
charms; and look on the Minister, as some Exorcist, confined to these Articles
of stinted spells and forms: Yea so far has the prejudices, affectations and
ignorance of these men prevailed, against all Reason and Religion, in some
places; that many Ministers (in other things) not unable, or unworthy men, are
carried away with fear and popularity to comply with those men's fondness in a
way of dissimulation; Forbearing to use publicly at any time either the title
of Saint due to holy men, or the Lords Prayer, and the Decalogue; which are
both Scripturall Summaries, and commanded to be used. So also they lay aside
the Creed, which is an Ecclesiastical compendium taken out of the Scripture,
Vid. Voss. de Symbolis.
and very ancient in the chief articles of it; containing the main foundations
or heads of Christian Faith; nor was any of these ever neglected, or not both
frequently and devoutly used in the public Liturgies or Services of sober
Christians, either ancient or modern.

O how sour and spreading a leaven is the pride, passion, and superstition of
men's spirits which run after faction and novelties! that even learned and grave
men should be, not so much infected with it in their judgments, as to be
swayed and biased, or overawed by it, in their practice, contrary to their
judgments; merely, Gal. 2.12.
as St. Peter with his dissimulation, gratifying these pretenders to novelty
special sanctity, by the not using of those divine and wholesome forms of
sound words: in which neglect the presumed perfection of these Antiministeriall
men, disdains to condescend to the infirmities of novices, and weaklings in
religion, the babes in Christ, Those Lambs, which good Shepherds, Joh. 21.15.
must take special care of, as well as of their stronger sheep, feeding them
with milk, (or cibo praemanso) the often repeated Catechisticall rudiments, and
chewed principles of Religion, which are by the wisdom of God, and our
Savior, most fitly and compendiously set forth in the ten Commandments and
the Lords Prayer, as to the main of things to be done or desired by a
Christian; as also the sum of things necessary to be believed were anciently
comprised in the Articles of the Creed, according to that wisdom of the
Apostles or the primitive Fathers, which imitated those patterns, set by the
Lord to his Church: That so the Infants or younglings of Christ's family might
not be starved, because they have not such teeth, as these men's jaw-bones
pretend to; who (before they have well sucked in the first principles) are
gnawing bones, or cracking kernels and nuts, exercising themselves, or vexing
others, with odd questions, and doubtful disputations; more troubled with
their Familisticall fancies, about their own partaking of the divine Nature,
their identity with Christ, and when and how it is; in what manner, and what
measure they may be said to be God, and Christ, and the Spirit; than soberly
establishing their minds in the fundamental points of things to be believed,
obeyed, and desired to the glory of God, and the honor of the Gospel.

But I must leave these envious and unquiet Spirits to their censorious
separations, wrangling themselves into vanities and errors; at length falling
(like Lucifer) into the blackness of darkness, to unjustice and cruelty;
after that into grosser blasphemies and presumptions against God Christ, and
the holy Spirit: while they proudly affect, and presume to be not like to the
most High; but the same with him; not in the beauties of holiness, grace, and
godliness, which are the clear (Image of God set forth) in the Word; but in
the glory and majesty of the divine Essence; which is inscrutable; not to be
communicated or comprehended, in its superessentiall being; and
superintellectuall perfection; no more than the vast and glorious body of the
Sun, which is 160 times bigger than the earth, can be locally contained in the
eye; to which yet it is by its beams in some kind imparted and united. Such
superfluity we see there is of folly, ignorance, weakness, pride and malice in
some spirits: who, upon very peevish and perverse grounds, forsake our
Christian public Assemblies and duties celebrated in our Churches; (which are
sanctitied by the Word and prayer) scorning and condemning what we do, upon
the best grounds of Scripture and Reason; separating themselves from the true
Ministry, and fellowship of the Church of England; as if they were most
spiritual and refined; when yet they seem to be so grossly ignorant, so
passionate, and some of them so sensual, as is no argument of their having the
Spirit of God, which is wise in all holiness.

7 Calumny. Act. 24.5.
BUt our Antiministeriall Adversaries object, as Tertullus, and the Jews did
against St. Paul, that the ordained Ministers of the former way, Against
Ministers as seditious and inconform to Civil government.
are pestilent fellows, stirrers up of the people; factious, turbulent,
seditious; not so supple, conform, and well affected to the present
constitution of powers and public affairs: So that it is not only lawful,
but necessary, either to bring them to a plenary conformity, and subjection; or
to exautorate and suppress them, as to all public influence in the Ministry:
Thus do these Wasps and Hornets buz up and down; who hope with their noise and
stings ere long to drive all the ancient and true Ministers of God out of the
land; or at least out of the service of the Church, that so they may be
possessed of the Hive, though they make no Honey.

Answ. This Calumny is indeed of the promising advantage to the enemies of the
Ministers, and their calling; and therefore it is with most cunning and
earnestness every where levelled by some men against their persons, Naz.
(...). 1.
actions, and function; It is like the policy of Julian the Apostate, who to
ensnare the Christians set the statues of the Emperors with the Idols of the
Gods; That if Christians did civil reverence, as to the Emperors, they should
be defamed as Idolaters; if not, they should be accused as despisers of the
Emperors: And because I persuade my self, that all excellent Christians, how
potent soever, can bear an honest freedom, and plainness, I shall only, as
to this sharp and poisoned arrow, oppose the shield of plain dealing; that in a
matter so much concerning the satisfaction of others, and Ministers civil
safety, there may be no such obscurities as may harbor any jealousies.

First of all, I need not tell you, 1. Some Ministers compliances.
what all the English world knows abundantly; That there are many Ministers of
very good abilities, who are not at all blameable in this particular; as to any
restivenesse and incompliancy in civil subjections; they have sufficiently
testified how Arts and ingenuous learning soften the spirits and manners of
men; how they supple in them that roughness and asperity, which remains in
others: how of oaks it makes them become willowes; and in stead of hard wax,
(which only fire can tame) makes them gentle, as soft wax; so good natured,
that they are not at all pertinacious of any former signatures, and stamps;
either as civil, or sacred, made upon them: but readily and explicitly yield
to any forms and impressions, though never so new and different; which the
hand of power is pleased to make: And this, not only as to a passive
sequaciousnesse, in the external fashion of their civil conversation and
profession; but as to those internal characters and persuasions, which their
judgments have made upon their consciences. Nothing is more tractable and
malleable, nothing more easily runs into any State mould, and receives any
politic figure and mark, than many Ministers do: whose judgments, or policy,
or fears, or necessities have taught them how they may Romans 12.11. (...). Beza
interp. Domino servientes: ut Chryso. Basil. etc. Erasmus, Tempori servientes;
i. e. Temporum incommodis sese accommodantes; patientia and charitate.
serve the Lord, and the times too; how to become all things to all men, in
regard of things civil and extern; they have many wholesome and prudent
latitudes of evasions, absolutions, cautions and distinctions, by which they
unravell the cords of any Oaths, and untwist the bonds of any Covenants, or
Protestations; They have in things merely politic, as many distinctions, as
would furnish any good Casuist, for the absolution of entangled, or the
satisfaction of grumbling consciences; Thus furnished, no wonder if in civil
changes which are fatal, and by them unavoidable, they can never be brought to
Baalams straits; Numb. 22.
where an Angel should meet them with a drawn sword; and the Ass either fall
under them, Utriusque fortunae documento didicerunt, ne contumaciam cum
pernicie mallent, quam securitatem cum obsequio. Tacit. hist. l. 4.
or crush them against the wall on either side.

These Ministers acting according to their consciences cannot justly be blamed
for any refractarinesse, many of whom are so much, every where, in any civil
conformities, that you can hardly lose them in any State alterations, or
labyrinths: nor do they doubt but the Lord will be merciful to them in this
thing, which not private choice and inconstancy, but public force and
necessity puts upon them. Charity commands to judge and hope, that these do
all things, according to that light, and latitude, which is in their
consciences, as to things secular: Wherein they conceive, that the Providence
of God, Mic. 6.9.
which is as his voice teaching us by the event of all humane affairs what is
his will, is a sufficient absolution, as to all preceding ties, civil or
sacred; which they look upon as obligatory only in relation to power
Magistratick public, and effectual, in what men, and in what manner soever
they see it placed and exercised. Thus some learned men and Ministers plead it
as a matter of not only necessity and prudence, but also of justice and
gratitude; that what ever power Christians are by providence cast under, and by
that do, in any order of justice, enjoy civil protection, there they should
pay a civil and peaceable subjection, according to Conscience and equity;
while they have the benefit of Laws and government, they ought to yield
obedience according to Law: and this not so much to the persons of men
governing, who may be unworthy; but to the Ordinance of God, civil government,
which is managed at present by them.

2. 2. Others more pragmaticall and fierce.
There are indeed other Ministers, who are not only of harder metal, but of
hotter tempers; of more choleric constitutions, and feverish complexions; who
love to be moving in the troubled waters of secular affairs; who seem most
impatient of any order, or public rule, in which they have not some stroke,
and influence, ready to undo, what ever is done without them: Their breast is
as full of turbulent and seditious spirits, as the Cave of Aeolus is of winds,
forgetting what spirit becomes the Ministers of the Gospel in all times; who,
though they may denounce hell fire against all impenitent sinners, yet they may
not kindle civil flames of sedition, Luke 9.54.
or imprecate revengefull fire from heaven upon any men to destroy them. To the
misguided activity of such Ministers some think the public may owe much of
its troubles; for whom the best Apology is their repentance, for any transports
and excesses whereto they have been weakly or wilfully carried beyond those
bounds of duty and gravity, which as Ministers and subjects they ought to
observe, both toward God and man; All that can be pleaded in any veniality for
their folly and fury is, the Excuti^^^omnem ingeniis mediceribus constantiam
fatales regnorum and rerumpub: motus. Ju. de pictur. l. 2. c. 13. Plarimum
refoert^n quae eujusque virtus tempora inciderit. Plin. l. not.
common genius and general distemper of times, which slackening by civil
dissensions the cords of humane laws, and loosning the ties of wonted modesty
and observance to Superiors, gave so great temptations, that many Ministers of
more forward spirits, knew not how to resist them.

Alas! who has not sufficiently seen in our days by sad experiences, that
even among Ministers there are not only poor, weak and credulous, but also
heady, turbulent and factious men; prone to affect any miserable way of
popularity, and to debase their function and profession to most pragmatick
impertinencies, as in Ecclesiastical, so also in Secular affairs; though
their gifts be (other ways above the ordinary size) very useful and
commendable, yet they retain much of the vulgar mass and leaven, and are
subject to the same passions and common infirmities; yea no men are more prone
to rash indeavourings and bold activities, by how much they have many specious
fancies, and pretty speculations, suggested to them by those books they read:
which to some men is a kind of Necromancy, (...).
a conversing with the dead, and conjecturing by their counsels; So that some
of them, like Alchymists, by their reading of chymicall lights, grow so possessed
of their Elixars, or Philosophers stones, as if it were within a stones cast of
them; counting it a sinful and shameful laziness, for them to sit still,
when they are tempted to such goodly prizes, as their notions and conceptions
hold forth, in some way of reforming, or wholly changing the State of Religion
and government of any Church; and in order to that they shake even the civil
frame of things; to which they do not think themselves longer bound in
subjection, then they want a party strong enough for opposition; nor will they
easily be persuaded that is the sin of Rebellion, which carries the face of
Reformation: easily dispensing with obedience to man, where they pretend
amendment before God. Studiis in umbra educatis, Sen.
Want of experience in worldly affairs (which is hardly gained, within men's
Study walls) oftentimes prompts warm spirited men, first easily to approve, then
passionately to desire, afterward weakly and unproportionably to agitate,
Consilia callida and inhonesta, prima front laeta, tractatu dura, eventu
tristia. Tacit.
those precipitant counsels and specious designs, which often prove to the
shame, and ruin of themselves, and their seduced party. Indeed few Ministers
of more pragmatick heads, and popular parts, but think themselves fit to be
(and take it ill, if they be not) Counselors of State; Members of Synods, or
moderators and determiners of all affairs both Ecclesiastical and Civil;
hardly acquiescing in any thing, as well settled either in Church or State,
wherein regard is not had to their judgment, party, and persuasion; of which
they are always so very well persuaded, that, when they cry most down others
as Churchmen from having any foot or hand in any civil businesses, themselves
can presently step in over head and ears, so far implunged in State troubles
and secular commotions, that they hardly ever get out of them with honor and
safety, or with inward peace and comfort; Nor can they easily lick off that
blood, which may lie upon them, when they have no weapon left them but their
tongues.

The truth is; no men are more violently and superstitiously devoted to their
own fancies and opinions, than some Ministers are; none more unfeigned
Idolaters of those little Idols, which their own, or others imaginations have
figured; and which they would fain set up, as Gods both in Church and State; To
these, they preach it necessary that all Christians should bow down; that
without this mark of conformity to their way none should either buy or sell:
Rev. 13.17.
And when they have once so far flattered themselves in their own well meaning
projects, that they proclaim God, and Christ to be engaged on their side; then
they conclude, that He can by no means be so wanting to his own glory, as not
to give all speedy and effectual assistances to all their purposes and
designs; which are verbally as much to his honor, as they would be really to
their own advantages, if they should prevail and succeed: If they be defeated,
both God, and all good Christians, (of a different mind from them) are prone
to fall under their hard censures; and if they do not charge him foolishly,
yet they do blame their brethren and betters, for want of zeal to Christ, and
to what they list to call his cause: Such great counsails are often agitated in
the small conclaves of Clergy men: And what they blame in Cardinals abroad, or
Bishops at home; themselves are eager to practice even beyond Richelieu
himself: For they lay designs, not for one Church or Nation, but for the whole
world.

Isa. 55.8. Job. 16.2.
Forgetting, that Gods thoughts are not as man's; who may be never more mistaken,
than when they think, they do God very good service even by killing of others:
Nor are, indeed, the thoughts of the wisest and most learned Ministers, or the
humblest Christians, such as those (men's pragmatick projects are) who by easy
persuasions, and popular presumptions do so much slight all ancient ways, and
Catholic customs of the Churches of Christ, which are the great seals of
Religion, both evidencing and confirming those holy orders and institutions,
which were appointed by Christ and his Apostles: Pretending to follow some new
Scripture rules and patterns in things of extern order, and discipline; which
can never by any sound interpretation of the places alleged be supposed, or
proved to be either diverse from, or contrary to the universal way and use of
the primitive Churches; who, without doubt, were as careful to act in their
outward order and government of the Church according to Apostolical patterns,
and traditionall institutions, which were first the rule of the Churches
practice; as they were faithful to preserve the Canon of the Scriptures which
were after written, and to deliver them without variation or corruption to
posterity. But specious novelties in Religion or Church forms once formed in
some men's heads, are prone to move their hearts, with very quick excitations
and zealous resolutions: Soon after, (like salt-rhewms) they descend and fall
upon their lungs, provoking them to continual coughs; so that they cannot be
silent, or suppress their desires of new things in Church and State; Then they
are violently carried on to the spreading of their opinion, and way to others;
who are easily made drunk with any new wine; At length they run giddily and
rashly to some rude precipice; where if they go on, they are destroyed; if they
retreat, it is not without shame from others, and regret in themselves:
Together with after jealousies of State brought upon their whole function, or
that faction at least; it being a case sufficiently known, that most men are so
much self-flatterers, and self-lovers, that they are impatient of any defeats,
ready to study and watch oportunities of revenge; when they see the children of
their brains, which soon become the darlings of their devotion, to prove mere
abortions; or to be violently dashed in pieces; when, indeed, they never had
the due formations of Scripture, nor conceptions of Reason, nor productions of
Prudence.

Hence, in Politics, many times sharp examples have chastened severely the
preposterous machinations and motions even of Churchmen and Ministers, when
they forsake the ancient refuges of Christians, and Ministers (especially)
which were preaching (...). Naz. (...). 1.
prayers; and tears, and betake themselves to swords, and helmets, to plots and
conspiracies. If those Ministers of hotter spirits do not; yet others do find
themselves sufficiently taught that wiser temper and modest behavior, which
becomes Ecclesiastics in all civil relations and affairs; especially if they
carry any face of change and novelty, or have the least lineament of factious
non-conformities to the established laws and customs in Church or State; wise
men have sufficiently seen those miseries, obscurities, and disgraces, which
(as black shadows) have attended, even Churchmen, in that shame, and those
defeats, by which God has quenched the rash heats, and over boylings of their
fancies, hopes, and activities.

3. 3. Some Ministers errors not imputable to all.
Therefore my answer to the main of this Calumny is, by way of humble request
to all excellent Christians; that the jealousies, which some Ministers
weakness, rashness, or folly may have occasioned, may not reflect upon the
whole function of the Ministry; nor the sins and errors of any men's persons be
imputed to their profession; as if it were among the principles of all
Ministers, never to rest quiet from civil combustions till they have their
wills: That Ministers may have many failings, is not denied; if you would have
them wholly without fault, you must have none of humane race and kind; Not
only Gods exactness, but sober men's fight may easily discover folly in the
purest Angels of his Church; many spots in the brightest Moons, and much
nebulousnesse in the fairest Stars: Yet, God forbid, that any men of justice,
honor, or conscience, should charge upon all Ministers, and the whole
function, the disorders of some; when as there are many hundreds of grave,
learned, wise, humble, meek and quiet spirited men, whose excellent virtues,
graces, endowments, and public merits, may more than enough, countervaile,
and expiate the weakness, or extravagancies of their brethren; Ministers, as
well as other men, (except those, whose opinions and fancies are so died in
grain, that their follies will never depart from them) have learned many
experiences both in England and Scotland; that an overcharged, or an
ill-discharged zeal usually breaks it self in sunder; with infinite danger, not
only to its authors, but to its abettors, assistants and spectators: And
however, at first it might seem levelled against enemies, yet it makes the
nearest friends and standers by, ever after wary, and afraid both of such Guns,
and their Gunners; of such dangerous designs, and their designers. Nothing is
more touchy and intractable, than matters of civil power and dominion, in
which we have neither precept nor practice from Christ or his Apostles, for
Ministers to engage themselves in any way of offense; which their wisdom
avoided. They were thought of old, things fitter for the hands of Cyclops, who
forged Jupiters thunderbolts, than for the Priests of the Gods.

Great and sad experiences (showing how rough, and violent with blood and ruin
all secular changes are: how unsuitable and unsafe to the softer hands of
Ministers) these have added wisdom to the wise; and taught them very sober,
and wholesome lessons, of all peaceable and due subjection, both to God; (who
may govern us by whom he pleases) and to man, Psalm. 75.7.
who cannot have power, but by Gods permission; Dan. 4.17.
which at the best and justest posture, is not to be envied so much, as pitied
by prudent and holy men; who see it attended with so many cares, Habet aliquid
ex iniquo omne magnum exemplum, quod contra singulos utilitate publica
rependitur, Tacit. l. 14. An. Liceat inter abruptam contumaciam, and deforme
obsequium pergere iter ambitione and periculis vacuum. Tac. An. l. 4.
fears and horrors; infinite dangers and temptations; befides a kind of
necessity sometime in reason of State to do things unjust and uncomfortable:
at least to tolerate ways that are neither pious nor charitable.

So that the humble, peaceable, and discreet carriage of all wife, and worthy
Ministers (which only becomes them) may justly plead for favor and protection
against this calumny of pronenesse to sedition, faction, or any illegal
disturbance in civil affairs; even in all the unhappy troubles of the late
years, the wisest and best Ministers have generally so behaved themselves, as
showed they had no other design, than to live a quiet life in all godliness
and honesty; to serve the Lord Christ, and his Church, (peaceably if they
might) in that station, where they were lawfully set; if they could not help in
fair ways to steer the ship as they desired, yet they did not seek to set it
on fire, or split and overwhelm it: If in any thing relating to public
variations and violent tossings, (...). Pind.
they were not able to act with a satisfied and good conscience; yet they ever
knew their duty, was humbly to bear with silence, and suffer with patience from
the hands of men, the will of God; Romans 11.33.
whose judgments they humbly adore, though dark, deep, and past finding out;
If some men's dubiousnesse and unsatisfiednesse in any things (as they are the
works of men, who may sin and err) be to be blamed, (as it is not in any
righteous judgment) yet it is withal, so far to be pitied and pardoned, by
all that are true Christians, or civil men, as they see it accompanied with
commendable integrity, meekness, and harmless simplicity; which only becomes
these doves and serpents, Mat. 10.16.
which Christ has sent to teach his Church, both wisdom and innocence, to
walk exactly and circumspectly in the slippery paths of this world not only
by sound doctrine, but also by settled examples.

Which excellent temper would prevent many troubles among Christians; and much
evil suspicion against Ministers; who could not be justly offensive or
suspected to any in power, if they saw them chiefly intentive to serve, and
fearful to offend God; always tender of good consciences, and of the honor of
true Christian Religion; which was not wont to see Ministers with swords and
pistols in their hands, but with their Bibles and Liturgies; not rough and
targetted as the Rhinoceroes, but soft and gently clothed as the sheep and
Shepherds of Christ. There is not indeed a more portentous sight, than to see
Galeatos Clericos, Ministers armed with any other helmet, than that of
Salvation; or sword, than that of the Spirit; or shield, than that of Faith; by
which they will easily overcome the world, if once they have overcome
themselves: whose courage will be as great in praying, preaching, and suffering
with patience, meekness and constancy, as in busting and fighting; which
becomes Butchers better than Ministers; to whom Christ long ago commanded in
the person of S. Peter to put up their swords; Mat. 26.52.
nor was he ever heard to repeal that word; or to bid them draw their swords;
no, not in Christ's cause, that is merely for matters of Religion, who has
Legions of Angels, Armies of truths, gifts and graces of the Spirit to defend
himself, and his true interests in Religion withal: which are far better and
fitter weapons in Ministers warfare, 2 Cor. 10.4. The weapons of our warfare
are not carnal.
than such swords and staves, as they brought, who intended to betray, to take,
and to destroy Christ. Let secular powers forcibly act (as becomes them) in the
matters of Religion, so far as they are asserted and established by Law,
(whose proper attendant is armed power) It is enough for Ministers zeal to be
with Moses, Exodus 17.
Aaron, and Hur in the Mount praying; when Joshua, in the justest quarrel, i^
fighting with Amalek; that is, the unprovoked and causeless enemies of the
Church. If at any time they counsel or act matters of life and death, they must
be so clearly and indisputably just, and within the compass of their duty and
relation, as may every way become valiant men, humble Christians, and prudent
Ministers.

Object. 4. Of the Engagement.
But to confute all that can be said for the Ministers of England, their
adversaries are ready to object, that many of them scruple the taking of the
Engagement; This they think is a pill, which will either choke their
consciences, if they swallow it, or purge them out of their livings, if they
do not; For, contrary to all other Physic, this operates most strongly on
those, that never take it.

Answ. Truly this is the only tender part, the undipped heel, where (it may
be) some of these Achillesses, able and good Ministers, may be hurt; In which I
humbly crave leave without offense to the power, or prejudice to the wisdom of
any men, to offer thus much in the behalf of peaceable Ministers. That,

1. It is not true of all: many Ministers have showed, by their taking it, in
such a sense of passivenesse under, and non-activity, against the present
establishment, as is satisfactory to the Imposers, and inoffensive to their own
consciences; what others would do, if they could, Perjurio maculare vitam suam
magis timere debet quam finire Christianus. Aust. Ep. 224. Judge 8. 2 Samuel
12.31. (...), Juramenta vereri religiosius. Pythag. dict. Mat. 5.33. 2 Samuel 21.
Zach. 8.17. Jer. 34.18.
with inward peace. And if there were no other excuse or Apology for these
peaceable, and painful M^nisters, (who have not subscribed) but only those
many pleas of Conscience, which have been humbly tendered to public view;
these ought not to be unconsidered by such as profess to be Christians; who
remember, how cruel a thing it is, to make men's consciences pass, as Gideon
did the men of Succoth, or David the Ammonites, under briars and thorns, under
saws and harrows; of either sharp contradictions, or prickly distinctions;
unsafe Salvoes, which if they may seem evasions before men (in matter of Oaths
lawfully taken) yet possibly, may not prove full absolutions before God, who
has often severely exacted the forfeitures of perjury; as of Saul and Zedekiah.
And how ever God in his providence may put suspensions of oaths, as to their
actual execution; yet they cannot find any absolution from the obligation
which goes with inconditionate Oaths, so long as they are within our moral
possibility of keeping them: How any man can swear or promise to be true and
faithful to two different interests, without being forsworn, or false and
unfaithful to the one or the other, seems a Gordian knot which only the sword
dissolves by cutting, not untying.

And who can wonder, that seriously considers the state of humane affairs,
(which are most fully represented in the glass of our times, with as many
variating faces, as the Moon) if some Ministers, (whom both grace and
experience, age and manners have made grave and calm) are tender and wary of
further hampering their consciences on any State cables: Jurandi facilitate in
perjurium prolabimur, Aust*
since they have seen that the former threefold cords, of Oaths, Protestation,
and Covenant, could not resist those tides, and storms, which have driven the
whole Nation (as to extern events and affairs) from those grounds of fidelity
and allegiance, both as to Civil, and Ecclesiastical obedience, whereon they
thought they had conscienciously, safely and quietly cast anchor according to
laws.

Furthermore some men's non-engaging cannot be any great weakening to power,
(however it may so seem to some men's jealousies and policies) since no man's
engaging seems to be any great fortifying of it: For experience has taught us
how easily men are absolved from such public ties, seem they never so strict:
Nor is there any reason to think they will be stronger for the future, than
they were in former times: Public security does not much consist in any
verbal formalities, but in that efficacious power, which men have by the
sword; and which they exercise as long, as the Lord of all the world is pleased
to execute his will, Dan. 4.17.
and pleasure by any men. Next to power, public authority and safety rises
from the satisfaction of men's judgments, as to the justice of men's
proceedings; winning respect and love by that equity in government and
moderation, which is according to Laws settled and known: not by arbitrarines of
will, and mere force; which as to the principle is tyrannous, be it never so
tempered in the exercise. Under any such orderly Government, wise Christians
and Ministers know, how with humility, peace, and patience, to submit as far
as is agreeable to piety, and necessary for the public peace, no less than
for their private safety. Last of all; Possibly those men whose interests made
them most forward at first to go in these new and untrodden ways, found them
not so smooth, (without any rub or scruple) in their own judgments and
consciences; that they should greatly wonder, if others, (who are only driven
that way, without their choice, counsel or consent) do fear, or find
something in it, which makes them startle or stumble. And truly, in this point,
without any further arguing, (which is neither safe nor discreet as to public
resolutions of State, in any private man) it must be freely confessed, that
some Ministers (as well as other sober men) do humbly cast themselves on the
mercy of God, and the Novum imperium inchoantibus, utilis clementiae famae,
Tacit. h. ^4.
clemency of those in power; hoping for such toleration, and connivence in this
particular, as many did plead for, and enjoy in their former non-conformities,
which favor they may best deserve, because they will least abuse it: (...).
Their quiet and godly carriage being as great security to Governors, as any
oath can be from others: Viri boni constans vita vim habet juramenti, Cl. Al.
(...). 7.
Behaving themselves within those bounds of discretion, peaceablenesse, and
civil subjection; which becomes them, and all truly wise and godly men in the
many tossings, and changes, to which they are subjected, as other mortals, in
this mutable world: In all which, if the strictness of religion terrifies any
good Christians with the fear of any thing, Zach. 8.16, 7.
that looks like false Oaths, or perjury, (...). Naz. Car. 158. (...), vocat.
Thucid. l. 1. quos infoederibus pangendis invocabant.
(one of the blackest stains, most indeleble spots and unpardonable sins of the
soul) being a blaspheming, denying and defying of God: yet, certainly it
allows the most conscientious men, (wherever their worldly necessities and
livelihoods force them to live under any power) such latitudes of honest and
peaceable subjection, in things merely civil and external, as may not always
force them upon banishments, prisons, and persecutions; or else, evermore
embroile them with civil wars, and open hostilities; even there where they
cannot hope to preserve themselves, without a miracle. A wise and humble
Christian is never far from his refuge; And when pursued or urged, beyond what
he thinks agreeable to a good conscience, he is not to seek for base and Foxes
shifts, subtle windings, or sinful coverts: He is always ready either fairly
to obey, or fairly to suffer: He needs not wiredraw his conscience, till it
fits every State passage: if the way of the world be strait, yet Gods is still
enlarged to him; if the worlds be large, yet he still keeps to Gods
strictness. Certainly good men ought not too rashly to cast away that just and
fair protection, which they enjoy under any civil power; (which, Christ tells
us, no man can have but from above, Joh. 19.11. Joh. 19.11.
) But rather with all humble gratitude, both to give God the glory; and man,
that respect, which is due for any favor, and indulgence they have in worldly
regards; which will ever seem least heavy to a good Christian; while there is
no torture, rack or tyranny exercised upon the conscience; by forcing to
declare or act there, wherein their judgments are not so fully satisfied, as to
the point of approbation, or actual concurrence.

It is happy if at any time truly conscientious Christians can enjoy any fair
quarter among men of this world; whose high and haughty spirits, if puffed up
with success, are hardly patient of Christ's self-crucifying methods: It is
wisdom in Ministers to merit, by humble and peaceable carriage according to a
good conscience, all moderation from secular powers; who are more easily
provoked against them than other men: Statesmen are often flatterers, seldom
such real friends to Jesus Christ, and his Church, as to deny themselves much
for their sakes: Nor do they usually much regard those holy interests, further
than they are brought to a compliance with their designs: The yoke of Christ
is commonly too heavy for the iron sinews of Conquerours necks; and his gate
too strait for triumphing Armies to march through; with out much stooping and
self-denial; Victoria natura insolens est, and superba. Cic. pro. Mar.
which is a hard lesson for those to learn, whose advantages are in their
hands, unless grace be also in their hearts: It Is always seen that men of
power set up themselves speedily and effectually, in places of honor, and
profit: but to set up Christ and his Kingdom in any real way of godliness
and holy order (further than some verbal, cheap, and popular gratification) is
a work of many ages, and worthy of that pious and magnanimous spirit which was
in Constantine the Great; whose Eagles wings served no less to protect the
Church in peace and prosperity, than the Empire and his own person. Great men
are generally shy of those conscientious strictnesses and self-diminutions,
which true Religion requires; so that Ministers had need study to walk
inoffensively, that they may catch men by honest guile: Laying aside all
uncomely rigor, rude severities; 2 Cor. 12.16.
and what ever may savor of either scorn, or stubbornness; using in civil
affairs all fair submissions, which may consist with the peace of their
consciences before God, and the honor of their profession before men; which is
the purpose, and will be the practice of all truly wise and godly Ministers;
who think it more honest and honorable to be open enemies, than false and
feigned friends; to withdraw from, rather than abuse protection.

But yet in matters properly religious, so far as Ministers are in Christ's
stead, and have the care and charge of true Religion, 5. The courage of
Ministers in things properly religious and in their calling.
of the Church, and of the welfare of men's souls; Herein (O you excellent
Christians) I know, you not only allow, but expect, that all true Ministers
should be faithful to Gods glory, and the souls of them, Non est dicentis
praesumptio ubi est jubentis domini autoritas, Chrysostom. l. 70.
although they should offend them; That they ought to speak the truth
seasonably, and wisely, though they contract enemies; that they must not by
their Honestius est offendere quam odisse. Tac. vit. Agr. (...). Syn. de Regno.
(...). Cl. Al. (...).
pusillanimity, and flattery prostrate the honor of true Religion, nor of
their Ministry; which ceases not to be Christ's Jewel, when it is for its
splendour (which men cannot bear) trodden under feet. Act. 7.55.
They must still look steadfastly to heaven, though men cast dust and ashes,
stones and firebrands in their faces upon the earth. In this holy station and
resolution, which is proper to them, as Ministers of the truth of God, I hope
there are still many so Jer. 9.3. Non quid illi cupiant audire, sed quid nos
deceat dicere considerandum, qui f^lsarum l^udum irrisionibus decipi quam
saluberrimis monitionibus salvari malint. ^l. l. 8. Gr.
valiant for the Truth, so zealous for the glory of God, the name of Christ,
and the honor of the reformed Religion; so faithful also to men's souls, and
their own integrity; that as they will not disdain to serve even wicked
Magistrates, in Gods way, no more than Mark. 6.20.
John Baptist did to preach to Herod) yet they would infinitely disdain to
flatter them in any way, Nude cum nuda loquimur, non verenda retegimus, sed in
verecunda refutamus, Ber. Ep. 43.
as Gods, or agreeable to true Religion, which is not so; or to fear them so,
as to betray the cause of God; (which is always pleading against the
ignorance, or error, or violence, or hypocrisy, or pride of the evil world)
and to sow pillowes under any men's Elbowes, who may perhaps lean uneasily on
the skuls and bones of those they have unjustly slain; 1 King. 20.2. Isai.
30.10.
or like Ahabs 400 false Prophets, to speak only soft and smooth things to
those men, whose hearts and hands are prone to harden by the use of arms both
against piety, equity and charity: so that, at length, they may grow rough as
Esaus, and red as Edoms; military passions and actions, especially in great and
violent changes, Frustra de superatis hominibus gloriatur infaelix victoria,
quae irae and superbiae fuccumbit. Ber. ad mil. Temp.
seldom keeping within the bounds of that justice and mercy which Christian
Religion constantly prescribes without respect of persons, to the strong, as
well as the weak; to the Conquerours, as well as the conquered; Success being
for the most part, an irresistible temptation to men, by power to gratify
their lusts; and to think any thing necessary, and so lawful, which is but
safe and beneficial: not regarding the exact rules of justice (in the Laws of
God and man) which are divine, and immutable; by no advantages of gain, or
honor to be warped or varied: The common places, Sermons and prayers of true
Ministers must not be like some men's Almanacks, calculated just to the
elevation of men's counsels, designs and successes, (wherein flattery would
seem to be Prophetic and foretelling) but without respect of persons the same
at all times to all men, as to the main rules and duties of holiness.

Although it be very impertinent to dispute with power irresistible, to tax
Caesar, when he is able to tax all the world; or to quarrel at his coin, when
he is master of ours; yet a wise Minister and Christian may distinguish between
the public power in men, and the private personal sins of men; A grave and
constant spirited preacher of righteousness, will (as he should, in Gods way
and Word) with all religious freedom, yet with all civil respect tell even
the greatest Princes, and Potentates of their sins: as resolute Eliah, and
honest Micajah did Ahab; as Nathan did David; as Jeremiah did the Princes and
people too; as John Baptist did Herod; as St. Stephen did the Jews, Non par
est, ut deceptus splendore purpurae ignores imbecillitatem corporis, quod hac
regitur. Amb. ad Theodos. Theod. l. 5. Eccles. hist. c. 1^.
and as St. Ambrose did Theodosius the Emperor; who for that Christian courage
loved him the better; professing, that no man was worthy the honor of a
Christian Bishop, or Minister, but he that knew how to own and use such pious
and resolute constancy, as he had done; Yea what will you think of the freedom
used by Menis Bishop of Chalcedon to Julian the Emperor, telling him that he
was an Atheist and Apostate? Being blind and led to the place where they were
sacrificing; Julian with scorn asked him, why the Galilean did not open his
eyes; Sozom. l 5. c. 4.
The old man answered he thanked God he wanted eyes to see so wicked a person.

It is certain no men are better subjects in any time or under any State, than
such plain dealing Preachers; although often times none are less esteemed, by
such men, who had rather enjoy the fruit of their sins with peace, than hear of
them to repentance. But Ministers, who are Gods Heralds, must not consider,
what voice pleases those to whom they are sent; but what he commands that
sends them; It were better that hundreds of them were sequestered, plundered,
imprisoned, banished, or burnt at Stakes in Smithfield, Vitamque impendere
vero, Nec propter vitam vivendi perdere causam. Juv.

Nihil turpius sanctis parasiti^s.


(after the example of many holy Martyrs) than that their votes and suffrages
(as more sollemn parasites) should ever flatter men, either great or many, in
their sins; or Isai. 5.20.
call evil good, and good evil; or speak good of that, and bless those whom
they think Psalm. 10.3.
God abhors, who is as far from approving, as from commanding, any
immorality, or injustice in any agents, (whom he suffers to act and do great
things in the world) when yet he so far approves strange events, as he permits
them in his unsearchable, yet always (...) just wisdom, which knows how to
make good use of evil men and manners. (...). Bas. M. de Sp. 5. c. 21
God can make Bathsheba to be the mother of a Solomon whom he loved; when yet
he never allowed the sin of 2 Samuel 12.14.
David or Bathsheba in their first coming together; the fruit of which the Lord
destroyed. It justifies, as St. Austin says, Gods omnipotent goodness and
wisdom, but not man's impotent passion and folly; when he brings his glory, or
his Churches good out of their evil.

Yet this just and necessary freedom, (...). Demost.
which Ministers of the Church in all duty to God, charity to men, and fidelity
to their own souls, ought always, as they have fit occasion, to use, must not
amount to bitter, rude, importune, and unseasonable reproves; not to public
raylings, seditious reproaches, and popular invectives against any men's
persons, or actions: Nobile plane ac generosum est vincendi genus, alios
humilitate praeoccupare ut vincamus. Sal. Ep. 5. (...). Is. Pel. l. 4. ep. 139.
There must be meekness with zeal; humility with courage; modesty with
freedom; gravity with constancy, and prudence with innocence.

If those, that are at any time in Power, do not like, or will not protect and
encourage such Ministers in all such religious freedom of speaking, as becomes
the Word of God; if they presently make those offenders for a word; and look
on them, Isai. 29.21.
as enemies of their power, who only tell them and all men of those sins, which
the Scripture reproves, equally in all men, and God will mightily punish in the
mighty: If they resolve to destroy all those Preachers, which are loath they
should be damned; Impatientiam reperhensionis sequitur peccandi impudentia;
unde impoenitentia, desperatio damnatio. Ber.
Truly such men deserve to have no Ministers, but those that are not worth the
having; Teachers after their own hearts, and not after Gods; None are worthy
the name of Christ's Ministers, who suffer Christians to sin securely; others
may heap up, and feed on Mellei and sacharati doctores.

but in a Christian charity; not so, as to diminish their power, (which

poisonous kisses? to hear of those faults in a fair way, which he has cause
to be sorry, that ever he committed; and of which he must repent even to a
restitution of injuries, or at least an agnition, if ever he have pardon? True
Ministers are to consider, not what will please poor sinful mortals, but what
will profit men's souls; not what may seem good to them, but what will do
them good; and however they may not transgress the laws of honor, and
civility by a rudeness of Religion; yet they must take that Ezekiel. 2.5.
liberty of speaking, which the word of God allows, and conscience requires,
whether men will hear, or forbear.

6. Ministers quiet subjection merits protection.
If then Christian Religion be not in England grown a mere fable, (as the
Ministers of it, are too many, become a reproach and a byword, a burden, and a
song) If modern-policies has not quite eat up all that piety, which was
sometime professed, in privater and obscurer stations: If Mammon has not
justled God out of the throne of great and strong men's hearts: If Belial have
not deposed Christ: If the enjoyment or catching at the shadows of temporal
power and possessions, have not made men foolishly let go the care to get and
to hold fast eternal life. If Arms have not beaten away the graces of Gods
Spirit; and fighting against Christians have not taught them to fight against
God, and the checks of conscience: If the shedding of man's blood have not taken
away the sense and virtue of Christ's blood: If the noise of war, and the cry
of the slain have not deafned men's ears against the voice of God, and the calls
of his Spirit: If the dreadful and lamentable aspect of poor Christians
supplicating in vain for life, and dying with horror and anguish at the feet
and before the eyes of their brethren, have not taken away the fight of charity
and deprived men of the light of Gods countenance in love and mercy: If there
be any tenderness of conscience, any sense of sin, any fear of God, any
terrors from above, from beneath, or from within; if any belief of the
judgment to come, and accounts to be given; if any thoughts of, and ambitions
for a better Kingdom, than the earth can afford: Nemo potest veracitere esse
amicus hominis, nisi qui fuerit primitus veritatis. Aust. Ep. 52. Charitas pie
saevire, humiliter indignari, patienter irasci novit. Ber. Ep. 2.
No men will be more acceptable, even to the greatest, than those Ministers,
who know, at once how to speak the truth, and yet to keep within the bounds,
both of Charity and civility; Nor does it follow (as the sophistry of some
Sycophants would urge against true Ministers) that those will be most active to
destroy or disturb the powers of this world, who are most faithful to keep
potentates souls from damning, in the world to come.

In these Christian bounds then of peaceable subjection, humility and
holiness, if the Ministers of England, which are able, discreet, and
faithful, might but obtain so much declared favor, and public countenance,
(which all other fraternities and professions have) as to be sure to enjoy
their callings, liberties, and properties, which seem to be many times in great
uncertainties, under the obedience and protection of the laws; as it would much
encourage them in their holy labors, (which always find carnal opposition
enough in men's hearts, and discouragement from their manners) so it would
redeem them from those menaces, insolences, and oppressions, of unreasonable
men; who look upon them as public enemies and perdue; because they think
they have little of public favor and encouragement: Ministers are so much
men, that kind and Christian usage will, no doubt, much win upon them; The
Sunshine of favor is likelyer to make the morosest of them, lay off that coat
of rigor and austerity, which some (perhaps) affects to wear; than that rough
storm and wind, wherewith they are daily threatened, and by which many of them
have been and are still distressed; which makes them wrap themselves up, as
Elias in his hairy mantle, when they think their lives, and liberties, and
livelihoods are sought after; and no such protection like to continue over
them, as they thought in a Christian State and Church they might have both
obtained and deserved, by their quiet and useful conversation. As just
protection invites inferiors to due subjection; so no men pay it more willingly
than they, who besides the iron chains of fear, have the softer cords of lov^,
and favor upon them: By how much (after many violent storms and hard
impressions) they are more tenderly used, the more is respect gained, and
peaceable inclinations raised in men toward such as will needs govern them: The
very best of whom are seldom so mortified, or heightened by Religion, as to
forget they are men; or to be without their passions, discontents, and
murmurings, joined with desires and endeavors to ease and relieve themselves;
At least to change their condition, if they find it Tyrannique and Egyptian;
(that is, unreasonable, arbitrary, injurious, and oppressive: quite contrary to
what is pretended, of honest and just liberties, both Christian and humane,
civil and conscientious; which are, for every one to enjoy, as his private
judgment of things, so what ever is his privilege and property by Law; while
he keeps within the practique obedience and compass of the Law, whereto
Governors, as well as governed, are bound, not only in piety, but also in
policy: Both tyranny and rebellion are their own greatest Traitors:
Magistrates seldom losing or hazarding their power, nor subjects their peace,
but when they wander out of the plain highway of Laws; Non diu stare potest
potentia, quae multorum malo exercetu^. Sen. de Ira.
which are the conservatories both of Governors and governed. It is the least
degree of justice, and short enough of any high favor, to permit, and protect
worthy Ministers (with all other honest and peaceable men) as in doing their
duties, so in receiving their dues: Yet this is as great a measure, as in these
times, they dare either ask, or hope for; Immunities from any burdens, that
lie heavy on them, Additions of honor or augmentations of estate, I think all
wise Ministers despair of: Peace with a little as to this world, would be a
great means, both to compose their studies, and to strengthen their hands in
the work of God; Also to quench that fire, with which many men's tongues are
inflamed against Ministers, their calling, persons and their maintenance;
thinking they may both safely, and acceptably despise those, whom power
delights not to honor; For whose ruin the malice of some Antiministerian
spirits wishes, as many gallowses and gibbets set up, as there are Pulpits.

Dan. 3.18.
But the Lord is able to deliver us: if not; yet, be it known to these violent
and unreasonable men, Hoc posteris dicite, Hominem Christo deditum posse mori,
non posse supera^i. Ieron. Psalm. 68.13. (...). Dictum juvenis inter tormenta;
cum totum vulnus erat, and fornam hominis, at non fidei amiserat. Eusebius. hist.
l. 5. c. 1.
that no learned, judicious and conscientious Ministers will bow down to
worship that papal, or popular Image of Anarchy and confusion, which they seek
to set up, as to the shame and ruin of this and all Reformed Churches, so
infinitely to the detriment and dishonor of this Nation, as to its common
welfare, in peace, plenty, or power, in good learning or true Religion. And
however we are forced for some time to lie among the pots; yet shall we be as
the wings of a dove; nor shall we want an Ark, whither to fly at last: where a
gracious hand will receive us to eternal rest; when we shall retire to heaven,
wearied with the troubles on earth, and finding no rest for our souls, amidst
those overflowing scourges, which the just and offended God will certainly
bring upon all such evil and unthankful men, who love their power or profit
more than their souls; and glory in despising those who profess to be Noah's,
the Preachers only of righteousness and of repentance; but no way the
pragmatick plotters of troubles or seditious movers of civil perturbations.

only left a wary super-politick, and over-cautious spirit to encounter and
dispell; which pleads policy against piety; and prefers outward safety, before
inward peace: Being, as it pretends, loathe, yea and afraid to displease, deny
or gainsay so great and powerful, at least so active, bold and pragmaticall a
party, as is by these Antiministeriall adversaries pretended to be, both among
military men and others, implacably engaged against, not only the persons
present standing, and maintenance of Ministers; but even the very calling,
ordination, and function of the Ministry: which they are resolved to undermine
by calumnies, or overthrow by force; either by fair or foul means: These
Antiministeriall spirits must by all means be gratified; and by no means
displeased; lest impatient of the repulses and elusions often given to their many
petitions and essays against the Ministry they fly out to greater disorders,
than either the Ministers or the Gospel, the reformed Religion, or Christ
himself are worth: Better this one function of the Ministry, (though ancient,
useful and necessary to the Church; yea though holy and of divine institution,
the greatest gift of God, next Jesus Christ, to the world) better this be
destroyed, than a generation of violent spirits should get a head, and destroy
both us and our Nation. Thus some men, whose fears are strong objecters
against their judgments, and consciences; which cannot but acknowledge both of
the Ministry and Ministers of England, that God is in them, and has been with
them of a Truth.

Answ. I see how many Lions the base fears and cowardice of men are prone to
fancy, to be in Prove. 20 13.
their way, when they should undertake to maintain the cause of God, of Christ,
and of true Religion, 1. Men's cowardice in religious matters.
(which the cause of the Ministers indeed, is.) Judge. 9.36.
Here the shadows of mountains and Phil. de Com:
fields of thistles appear like armed men to timorous and degenerous
Christians; when yet all the outward difficulties, all the inward terrors, all
the devils in hell cannot deter some men from those adventures wherein their
worldly interest of profit, safety or honor are concerned; There oft-times
necessities are first made, then they are prosecuted, after they are pleaded as
grounds for excuse, at least, if not of justification, of actions less
warrantable.

If I thought (as truly I do not) that this ungrateful mutiny of some men
against the Ministry, and the mean despondency of others, (their cold and faint
friends) were general and Epidemicall among men of any considerableness, for
quality, number, and estate, that these did either oppose or desert their
Ministers, Sueton. in Jul. Cas.
I conceive it would admit of no better confutation and remedy, than for
Ministers (with Caesar) to open our naked breasts, and to offer them to the
ponyards and swords, or pistols of those, that think it fit to desert us; and
by a second hand to destroy us.

Ministers yield to the sentence of the Nation.
If those that excel in any virtue, or in power, do indeed think the Ministers
and Ministry of England have deserved to be thus vilified and exploded, as the
filth and offscouring of all things: if in reason of state and politic
interest it be found therefore best, because safest; that Learning must yield
to illiteratenesse; study to temerity; knowledge to ignorance; modesty to
impudence; ingenuity to rusticity; order to confusion; gravity to giddiness;
holy eloquence to vain blessings; serious disputings to rude and profane
janglings; That the grave, learned, and venerable Preachers of the true
Christian reformed Religion must give place to cunning and insolent Factors for
all manner of errors, superstitions, and confusions; if this be necessary, or
highly convenient for the public good, they shall do wisely, if not well,
with all speed to stigmatize by public vote and act, both the Ministers and
their Ministry on the foreheads, as so many vile persons, whose craft has
hitherto cheated and abused the English world, in stead of seeking, and showing
men the true way to heaven; Nothing is more just, than to stop such mouths,
whose Oracles are no better than those, which were silenced when Christ came
into the world: Yea, quite to abrogate the function will be the shortest way
whereby to satisfy the Antiministeriall malice: And to expiate the sin or
folly at least of this Church and Nation; which self-displeased for
entertaining them so long, and so liberally, shall now take but a just revenge
in either sterving them, and their families to death, or condemning them to a
wandering beggary; That so by such a penal retaliation, Fu^um vendidisti, sumo
pereas. Sueton. in Vespas.
(as that Emperor commanded a Cheater to be stifled to death with smoke,
because he vented only smoke) Ministers may want common bread to live, who have
pretended to feed men's souls with the bread of life, and have in this only
deluded men; For coming now to be searched by the more accurate eyes of some
new Illuminates, they are found, like the Priests and Temples of the heathenish
devotion, to have in them, in stead of a venerable deity, nothing but the
Images of cats or crocodiles, and the like despicable figures.

If neither God, nor good men have any further pleasure in the life's, labors,
and prosperity of his servants the Ministers of England, against whom the
Shimei's of these times are bold so loudly to cast forth their cursing and
evil speeches; 2 Samuel 16.
Let the Lord do with us as it seems good in his eyes; Lo, we are many of us
in our several places and charges, yet residing: (some are already scattered
and ejected) most of us almost beggered, exhausted, weather-beaten, and
shipwracked in storms and tossings of these times. Some are even weary of
themselves, filled with the daily and bitter reproaches of their insolent
adversaries; 1 King. 19.4.
and even praying with Elias, It is enough, we are not better then our
Forefathers, (thus persecuted they the godly Ministers, the Bishops, the
Presbyters, the Apostles, the Prophets of old;) fit our souls for thee, and
take them to thee; that we may be delivered from so injurious and unthankefull
a generation, whose aim is to destroy the true Prophets, and pull down all the
house of God in the land.

Alas! we of the Ministry have no weapons or arms, Ministers unarmed innocence.
1 Samuel 22.17. Non nobis tanti est vita, ut armis tuenda fit. Tiber. ad Senatum.
Tac. an. 6.
no strong holds, or defenced Cities, besides our prayers, patience, and (as we
hope) good consciences; it will be no hard work for a few Doegs to destroy all
the true Prophets and Ministers of the Lord in the land: That so this great
Hecatomb, so long desired, and expected, may be an acceptable sacrifice to the
Jesuited Papists, and pragmatick Separatists, and all other malicious enemies
of this reformed Church; and that true Religion, which the Ministers of this
Church have professed and preached in many years.

And this, not upon light and unexamined presumptions; not upon customary
traditions, and the mere ducture of education; not upon politic principles,
and civil compliances, with Princes or people; but upon serious grounds; as
solid, and clear demonstrations, as can by right and impartial reasonings, be
gathered from the Word of God: and, (in cases of its obscurity, or our own
weakness) from that light, which the consent and practice of the primitive,
and purest Churches of Christ has held forth to us, in points of Faith,
doctrine, and in all good orders or manners, becoming Christians; either in
their private moralities, or their public decencies. In this integrity,
innocence, and simplicity, (which neither men nor devils can take from us) we
are sure to be destroyed, if it must be so, and to be delivered from an
ungrateful generation of vipers; Matthew. 3.7.
who think it enough to destroy those, who have been a means of their being and
life, as Christians; if our injuries and blood could be silenced with us, yet
the very dust of our feet, Matthew. 1^.14.
will be a testimony against such men at the last day of judgment: when it
shall be more tolerable, for any Christian people under heaven, than for these
in England; since among none clearer truths have been taught, or greater works
done, or better examples given; than have been here, by the Ministers of this
Church.

Where has there been under heaven more frequent, Ministers merit of this
Nation.
and more excellent preaching? where more frequent, and yet unaffected praying?
where more judicious, pious and practical writing? where more learned and
industrious searching out of all divine truths? where more free and ingenuous
declaring of them? so as nothing has been withheld or smothered; where more
devout, holy and gracious living? where more orderly, harmonious and charitable
agreeing, than among those that were the best Bishops, the best Ministers, and
the best Christians here in England? Adorned with these ribands, fillets and
garlands, of good words, good works, and good books, must the Ministers of
England, like solemn victimes, and piatory sacrifices, be destroyed? only to
gratify, some men's petulancy, insolency, covetousness and cruelty, who list
to be actors, or spectators in so religious massacres.

2. Considerations touching the Ministers of England, humbly propounded.
But O you excellent Christians of all ranks and proportions; If there be yet
any ear of patience left free to hear the Ministers plea and apology; if
calumny has not obstructed all ways of justice or charity; if slavish fears
have not so imbased your piety and zeal for the Christian reformed Religion,
that you dare not seem no not to pity the Ministers of it; if the separations
and brokennesse of Religion (in our unhappy times) have not wholly blinded your
eyes and baffled your judgments; so that you have lost all sight both of true
Church and true Ministry here in England; I humbly desire, that before the true
and ancient Ministers be cashiered, and quite destroyed, these things may be
considered.

1. Whether it be a just proceeding to impute the personal failings of some
men to the whole function and profession? whether, at that rate, all Judges,
Magistrates, and Commanders may not be cried down, as well as all Ministers?
Since, where there are many, there are always some, that are not very good. 2.
Whether it be fitting to condemn and destroy any men in any of their rights,
to which they pretend, either of office or reward, (and that by Laws, both
divine and humane) without a fair and full hearing, what can be said for them?
or whether any man would have such measure meted to themselves? 3. Whether
Pride in some Laymen of their gifts; Envy in others, against the welfare of
the Ministers of Christ; Covetousness in others, as to their maintenance;
Profaneness in others against all holiness; Ambition in others to begin or
carry on some worldly ends and secular projects; Licentiousness in others,
against all religious restraints; Impatience in others, to see any govern
without or besides themselves; Malice and spite in others, against this, as all
other reformed Churches; Hopes in others by our confusions to introduce their
superstitious usurpations; Whether I say these, and the like inordinate lusts,
and motions in men's hearts, as their several interests lead and tempt them,
may not be great causes, and influentiall occasions of these violent
distempers, which break out thus against the generality of the Ministers, and
the whole calling of the Ministry in this Church?

Yea, what if all odious clamours, and calumnies against them, and their
calling, have no more of truth in them, than a Jewel has of dirt in it when
filth is cast upon it? (whose innate firmness preserves its inward and
essential purity) What if nothing be wanting to the innocence and honor of
the Ministry of this Church, but only patient, and impartial Judges; pious
patrons, and generous protectours? which was all St. Paul wanted, when he was
accused of many and grievous crimes, by the cruel and hard-hearted Jews;
which were his Country men, and for whom he had that heroic charity, as to
wish himself Anathema from Christ, that they might be saved; Whether ever any
Ministers of learning, honesty and piety, (that had done so much for the
religious welfare of any Christian Nation, as the able Ministers of England
generally have done, for many ages;) were ever so rewarded by Christians? or
whether ever it entered into the hearts of religious men, so to deal with their
Ministers, as some now meditate and design?

It were good for men, how metald and resolute so ever they seem to be in
carrying on their designs, to make some pause and halt, before they strike such
a stroke, as may seem to challenge Christ, Severissime punit Deus cum paenalis
nutritur impunitas. Aust.
and fight against God: whose strokes against men are heaviest, when they are
least visible; and his wounds sorest, when men have the least sense of their
contending against him. The persuasions and confidences of men may be great in
their proceedings, Act. 26.9. Act. 9.4.
(as was in Saul persecuting) when yet their zeal is but dashing against the
goades, or thorns; and a mere persecuting of Christ himself; which will in
the end pierce their own souls through with many errors.

What if (notwithstanding many personal failings in Ministers as men) their
function, calling, and Ministry be the holy institution and appointment of
Jesus Christ; transmitted to these times, and this Church by a right order and
uninterrupted succession, as to the substance of the power, and essence of the
authority? (The talents or gifts were Christ's, and from Christ, delivered to
his Servants the Ministers of the Church: though some of them might be idle and
unfaithful; whose burying them in the earth, or wrapping them up in a napking
at any time was no wasting or imbezling of the substance of them; nor any
lessening of Christ's right to them.)

And for this I have produced, not weak opinions; not light conjectures; not
partial customs; not bare prepossession; 3. A summary of what makes for the
function of the Ministry.
not uncertain tradition; not blind antiquity; not mere crowds or numbers of
men; much less do I solemnly allege my own specious fancies, devout dreams,
uncertain guessings, Seraphick dictates, and magisteriall Enthusiasms; But 1.
evident grounds out of the Word of God, for a divine Ordination, and
institution at first. 2. Scripture history for succession, to four generations
actually. 3. Promises and precepts for perpetuity of power Ministerial, and
assistance, which was derived by the solemn ceremony of the imposition of
hands, by such only, as had been ordained; and so enabled with successionall
power, till the coming of Christ. 4. This primitive root and divine plantation
of the Ministerial office and power, we find often confirmed by miraculous
gifts; besides the innocence, humility, simplicity, piety and charity of those
Apostles, primitive Bishops and Presbyters, set forth in the holiness of their
lives; and the glorious successes of their Ministerial labors; converting
thousands by preaching the Gospel: and by their Ministerial power, and
authority planting Churches in all the then known and reputed world, often
crowning their doctrines and Ministry with Martyrdom. 5. After this I produce,
what is undenyably alleged, from authors of the best credit, (learned and
godly men) famous in the Church, through all the first ages, showing the
Catholic and uncontradicted consent; the constant and uninterrupted succession
by Bishops and Presbyters in every City, and Country; which all Christians in
every true Church owned, received and reverenced, as men endued with such order
and power Ministerial, as was divine, supernatural and sacred, as from
Christ, and in his Name; though by man, as the means and conduit of it. This is
made good to our days in the persons, and office of those Ministers, who were
and are duly ordained in this Church. 6. Next I plead, (with the like evident
and undeniable demonstrations) the great abilities in all sorts of ministerial
gifts; the use and advancement of all good learning; the vindicating of true
Christian and reformed religion; the manifold discoveries of sound judgment,
discreet zeal, holy industry, blameless constancy, and all other graces,
wherein the Ministers of England have not been inferior to the best, and most
famous in any reformed Christian Church, and incomparably beyond any of their
defamatory adversaries. 7. I add to these as credentiall Letters, the
testimonies and seals which God has given of his grace and holy Spirit,
accompanying the Ministry in England upon the hearts of many thousands, both
before and eminently since the Reformation; by which men have been converted
to, and confirmed in Faith, Repentance, Charity, and holy life; the trial of
which is most evident in that patience and constancy which many Ministers, as
other Christians in this Church have often shown in the sufferings, which they
have chosen, rather then they would sin against their Conscience, and that duty
which they owed to God and man. 8. Last of all, if any humane consideration may
hope for place in the neglect of so many divine; the civil rights and
privileges, which the piety of this Nation, and the Laws of this Land, have
always given to Ministers of the Gospel; by the fullest and freest consent of
all Estates in Parliament: that they might never want able Ministers, nor these
all fitting support and encouragements; These I say ought so far to be regarded
by men of justice, honor and conscience, as not suddenly to break all those
sacred sanctions, and laws asunder, by which their forefathers have bound them
to God, to his Church and Ministers, for the perpetual preservation of the
true Christian Religion among them and their posterity.

Furthermore, 4. The fruits of Ministers labors in England.
if the godly Ministers of this Church of England (whom some men destine to as
certain destruction and extirpation, as ever the Agagite did the Jews) if they
be the messengers of the most high God; the Prophets of the Lord; the
Evangelicall Priests; those, by whom Salvation has been brought, and continued
to this part of the world; If they have, (like the good Vine and Figtree) been
serviceable to God and man, to Church and State; If they have labored more
abundantly, and been blessed more remarkably, than any other under heaven; If
they have preached sound doctrine in season and out of season; if they have
given full proof of their Ministry, not handling the Word of God deceitfully;
nor defrauding the Church of any Truth of God or divine Ordinance; If many of
them have fought a good fight, and finished their course with joy, and great
success against sin, error, superstition, and profaneness; If they have
snatched many firebrands out of hell; pulled many souls out of the snares of
the devil; If they have fasted, and mourned, and watched, and prayed, and
studied, and taught, and lived to the honor of the Gospel, and the good of
many souls; If they have like David's Worthies stood in the gap against those
Anakims and Zanzummins, who by lying wonders, learned sophistries, and accurate
policies have, (to this day) from the first reformation, and coming out of
Egypt, sought to bring us thither again; or else to destroy the very name of
Protestants, and reformed Religion from under heaven; If almost all good
Christians, (and not a few of these renegadoes, their ungrateful enemies) do
owe in respect of knowledge or grace, to the Ministers of England, as Philemon
to St. Paul, even their very selves; If they have often in secret wept over this
sinful Nation and wantonly wicked people; (as Christ did over Jerusalem) and
as Noah, Daniel, and Job, often stood in the gap to turn away the wrath of God
from this self-destroying Nation; If, now, they have no other thoughts, or
practices, but such as become the truth, and peace of that Gospel, which they
preach, and that blessed example, which Christ has set them; whom in all
things they desire to imitate; in serving God, edifying the Church, doing good
to all men, praying for their enemies, and paying all civil respects, which
they owe to any men: If all true and faithful Ministers, have done, and
design only to do, many great and good works in this Church and Nation; for
which of these is it, that some men seek, and others with silence, suffer them
to be stoned; as the Jews threatened Christ; and the inconstant Lystrians acted
on St. Paul; who after miracles wrought by him among them, and high applauses
of him from them, was after dragged, as a dead dog, out of their City by them;
Act. 14.19.
supposing him to be dead. If all true and worthy Ministers being conscious to
their own Integrity, (a midst their common infirmities) after their escaping
the late storms, (in which many perished) are easily able, without any
disorder to them, to shake off those Vipers, Act. 28.5.
which out of the fire of some men's spirits now seize upon them with poisonous
calumnies of factious, covetous, seditious, etc. If there be still upon the
true and able Ministers of England, those Characters of divine Authority; those
gifts of the holy Ghost, in all good understanding, knowledge, utterance, zeal,
courage, industry and constancy, which fits them with power for that holy
function; and carries them through it, with all fidelity and patience, not only
to serve, but to suffer for the Lord Jesus and his Church: If they have been
just Stewards, and faithful dispensers of the Mysteries of Christ to his
household this Church; how can they without infinite rudeness, and unchristian
insolence be shamefully used, and driven out of their places and Offices? If
they have been spiritual fathers to many souls, and as tender mothers to
them; not disdaining to bear with the manners of childish Christians, in many
places, (who turned their respect into peevishness, and their love into scorn)
how unnatural will it be for Christians to become patricides, murderers of
their spiritual fathers? to whom in some sense they owe more, Legatis vim aut
^ontum^liam infer nefas. Reg. Iur. Jus Legatorum cum hominum praesidio
munitum, tum etiam divino ju^e est vallatum. Cic. de Arus. resp.
than to their natural? If Ministers be Ambassadors, they ought not to be
violated by the Law of Nations, (behaving themselves, as becomes the honor of
their Embassy, and sender) how much more if from God, sent by Christ, in his
and his Fathers Name; and that with a message of Peace, and reconciliation from
heaven to poor sinners? The greatest and proudest of them, being but worms
meat, may not safely despise, injure, or turn away the least of the servants
and Messengers of our Lord and Master Jesus Christ, which speak in his Name,
(that is, both his Truth, and by his Authority) which can be no where else (in
any ordinary Ministry) but in those, who are daily ordained in this holy
descent and succession.

If they have been watchful Shepherds over their several flocks, for good
and not for evil; how barbarous must it be for Sheep to turn Wolves, and
devour those Pastors, who have fed them, as Jacob did Labans flocks, Genesis
31.40.
with all care and diligence, day and night, leading them by the purest waters,
and in the safest pastures? Nor is there now any more cause to change the wages
of these Shepherds of souls (which is always like to be to their loss) than
covetous Laban had against honest Jacob.

If none other can authoritatively, and as of Office and duty, in the name and
by the mission of Christ, bring the message of peace, and reconciliation to
sinners; (which has besides the Word, sacred and mysterious seals; and other
holy actions of power and authority to be performed by peculiar, fit and
appointed Ministers) how beautiful ought their feet to be, and their steps
welcome; Romans 10.15.
which flow with truth and peace, grace and mercy? How far should they be
from being trodden under the feet of proud, covetous and envious men? who first
casting dirt in their faces, after with much dust and clamor, seek to stir up,
not only the people, Act. 21.36.
but the powers against them; as if they were burdens of the earth, not fit to
live? But wisdom is justified of her children. Matthew. 11.19.


I cannot be so injurious to my country and countrymen, 5. Ministers expect
better things from good Christians.
as to think; that to persons of such worth, standing in such relations between
God and man; invested with so holy authority; managing it with such divine
power and efficacy; crowned with so great successes; recommended to all worthy
Christians with so many public merits, both to Church and State; (as the true
and duly ordained Ministers of the Church of England are) either men of purity
or of power, can be so wanting to, or so shrink from their duty to God, their
love to Christ, their zeal for the reformed Religion, their care of their
country, of their posterity, and of their own souls; as not to dare to
speak, or appear for them; or not to endeavor in all fair ways to improve the
interest they have in the public, by which to preserve so many good and
righteous persons (as to man's tribunal) from poverty, contempt, and ruin; yea
to preserve themselves and their dearest relations from most irreligious infamy
of ungrateful deserting and oppressing so deserving men.

Men cannot but be unholy, that can be so unthankefull: 2 Timothy 3.2.
And if Ingratitude be in all other relations, and merits among men justly
esteemed as the most detestable disease and inhumane deformity in the soul;
shall it only seem beauty, health, and a commendable quality, when it is
offered by Christians to their Ministers? Such as may with equal modesty, and
truth plead their own innocence, and protest against the immanity of their
enemies malice? For setting aside the idleness and pragmatick vanity of some
Ministers in later, and more licentious times, (whose either insufficiency, or
lazynesse, or inordinate activity, or abject popularity, has made them the
stain and shame of their holy function; and whose burden is too heavy for my
pen to discharge them of) if we look upon those learned, laborious, sober and
venerable Ministers, who have been, and still are the glory and crown of their
function, of this Church and Nation, in their several degrees and stations:
Godly Ministers not injurious but meritorious to the public.
I may lowdly proclaim with Samuel this protestation in their behalf: Behold
the 1 Samuel 12.3.
Ministers of the Lord and of this Church, (O you unthankefull Christians and
causlesse enemies) witness against them before the Lord and before his people;
whose Ox or Ass have they taken? whom have they defrauded or oppressed? whose
hurt or damage have they procured? whose good have not they studied, and
endeavored? whose evil of sin or misery have they not pitied, and sought to
relieve? what is the injury, for which so desolating a vengeance must pass
upon them, and their whole function? What is the blasphemy against God or man,
for which these Naboths must lose their lives, 1 King. 21.
and livelyhoods? wherein have they deserved so ill of former or later ages;
that they should be so used ( as Ahab commanded of Micaiah; and the Jews did to
Jeremiah) to be cast into prisons, into sordid and obscure restraints; or to be
exposed to Mendicant liberty, for to be fed only with the bread and water of
affliction, if they can obtain so much? What necessary truth of God have they
detained in unrighteousness? what error have they broached, revived, or
maintained? what superstition have they nourished? what licentiousness in sin
have they encouraged? what true Christian liberty (which always contains it
self in bounds of Gods and man's laws) have they denied to, or defrauded the
people of? unless all things of public peace and extern order, in which the
public wisdom and consent of the Nation confined it self, them and all men in
it, by laws, are to be called superstition, tyranny and oppression, in
Ministers, more then all other men; who being under government, thought it
their duty to submit to every ordinance of man, 1 Pet. 2.13.
which did not cross any divine ordinance; but kept within the bounds of that
liberty, order and decency, which are left to the wisdom of any Christian
Church and State; whereby to preserve the honor of Religion, and the order and
peace of the public.

Those jejune and threadbare objections often used against Ministers in these
things, (wherein there were but obedientiall, and passive; the activity lying
in those, who had the power to enjoyne, and command them, which was done by all
Estates in Parliament) have been so often and fully answered, that all sober and
wise Christians see the weakness of reason, and the strength of passion in
them; as they are charged for faults on Ministers in their respective obedience
and conformity; For which they were like to know better grounds, than any their
enemies had against them: And being in all other main matters, very knowing and
conscientious men, they are not in charity to be suspected, in those lesser and
extern matters, to have sprung any leak of sinful weakness, or to have made
any shipwreck of a good conscience; Later events have much recommended former
duties and laws, Vires inordinatae mole ruunt sua: Quo vehementiores, eo
infirmiores; inque propriam ruinam valentissimae. Salust.
showing how weak, even Truth and Religion, are (as to extern profession) where
(like loose and scattered soldiers) Believers or Professors are destitute of
all order and just discipline.

But if the Ministers of the Church of England had discovered many failings, as
men compassed about with infirmities, 6. Ministers in their weaknesses, yet
superior to their adversaries who cannot supply their room.
which easily beset them, (for which they often mourned; against which they were
always praying and striving) yet what is it wherein the pretended perfections
of their presumptuous, and implacable adversaries do excel the very
weaknesses and defects of Ministers? yea wherein will the vapouring of any new
projectors be able to repair the damage or recompense the want, which
thousands must have; (yea this whole Nation suffer) if by these men's cruel
designs, they be deprived of the blessing of these, whom they please to count
so weak, unworthy, and contemptible Ministers? Will those old pieces, or those
new Proteusses (who pretend and fancy to be new stamped with the mark of
popular ordination, (which is none of Christ's, whose wisdom never committed
any power of Ministry, and holy offices, or divine Ordination to the common
people, as I have proved) who are betrayers, haters, and desertors of that true
power and authority, which they formerly received in that just and lawful
ordination, (which was from all antiquity derived to this Church; from which no
mean and vulgar compliance should have drawn any man of piety, learning, and
honesty, to so great a schism, defection and Apostasy, from the Catholic rule
and ancient practice:) will I say, these new masters, or those heaps of
Teachers, which country people are prone to raise up to themselves, in their
fervent folly, and zealous simplicity; will they furnish Church or State with
better and abler Ministers in any kind, with better learning, better doctrine,
better preaching, better praying, better living, then those former Ministers
did in the midst of their many infirmities?

Yea will not these new obtruders, with most impudent foreheads while they
look you in the face, cheat and deceive you? Will they not (while they smile
upon you, with shows of Gifts, and Spirit, O miserandam sponsam talibus
creditam Paranymphis! Ber. de Cons. Praedatores non praedicatores, peculatores
non speculatores, Raptores non Pastores, Id.
and Prophets, and special calls, and extraordinary ordinations) exchange
counterfeit for true Jewels, brass for gold, stones for bread, pebbles for
pearls, dirt for diamonds, gloeworms for stars, candles full of theives and
soil, for the Sun? In stead of the excellent and useful worth, the divine and
due authority of your learned and godly Ministers, you shall have either
confident ignorance, or fraudulent learning, or Jesuitick sophistry, or
fanatic nonsense, or flattering errors, or factious semblances of truth to
usher in most damnable doctrines and most unchristian practices; Do men gather
grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? Can these bitter fountains send forth
sweet waters? or these burning Etnas breath forth other than such sparks and
flames as their sulphurous spirits, and their hearts full of envy, Jam. 3.12.
and malice, and pride afford? which seek to darken the Sun of Truth at noon
day; or to scorch up the fruits of holiness; to infect the common air of
Christian charity, order, and peace; in which true Christians delight to
breath. When these plagiaries have destroyed, or driven away the fathers of
Christ's family, and Church; will they not either seduce and steal away the
children to their own erratick factions; or even sell these Orphans for a pair
of shoes to Cantors and Tom-a-bedlams; committing, or rather casting away the
souls of men to the careless care of those sturdy vagrants; whose minds are
more unsettled than their eyes, or feet, or tongues; which are so far bent
against true Ministers, as they are intent to their booty and prey from every
quarter?

Will these (who seek to be the maules and hammers of the Ministers of this
Church) either by their skill or power, wit or learning, prudence or policy,
ever forge on the hard anvils of their heads; or bring forth out of the rude
moulds of their inventions, any thing that shall be like a true Minister of the
Gospel? Are there ordinarily any such blocks to be found among them, of which
there is any hope, that they may be shapen to such Mercuries, as are the true
Gods Messengers? Are there any such tempting materials, as any art and industry
may promise to fit them up to such a degree and pitch of competent Ministers,
as may direct the country plainness? and guide that peevish and disputative
madness, which is among even the meanest people in every village? Will these
skippers or skullers, ever furnish out such Pilots, as may safely steer the
ship of this Church, in which the Truth of God, the honor of Christ, the
reformed Religion, the happiness of thousands of souls are embarked, amidst
the rocks of errors, Sirens of secular temptations, and piracies of strong
enemies on every side? They say, that better ships are now built in England
than ever were; and shall we be content with worse Pilots? less able Ministers
in the Church? who are as the Argonautae; bringers of the golden fleece; the
riches, and righteousness of Christ the Lamb of God; the treasures of heaven;
the true gold of Ophir; which has been seven times tried; in stead of which
these new trafiquers intend to trade for nothing, but the Apes and Peacocks,
toys of new opinions: Shall Noah's Ark, the Churches purity, (which is the
Conservatory of Christ's little flock, of the holy seed of a Christian
succession, both for fathers and children) be broken up or dashed in pieces
against the rocks of sacrilegious envy and policy; for these Antiministerial
projects will never be the mountains of Ararat, on which the Church or true
Religion may rest. (...). Is. Pel. l. 4. Ep. 210.
Shall this Island, whose safety consists so much in the guard of the Seas, be
less careful to guard the coasts of the Church and the reformed Christian
Religion? whose narrow frete or strait runs between the rocks of Atheism and
Superstition; of Parity and Profaneness; of Heresy and Schism; of Tyranny and
Toleration.

Will ever these new dwindling Divines, the Prophetical pygmies of this age,
(which oppose the able Ministers and true Ministry of the Church of England)
will they ever bring forth for the service of God, 7. Eminent Bish^ps and
Presbyters of former days in the Church of England.
or for the maintenance of the true Christian reformed Religion, such a race,
and succession of mighty men, of excellent Ministers, of incomparable Heroes,
worthily renowned in their own, and after generations, whose works yet praise
them in the gates; of whom none, but evil tongues, can speak evil; such as
this later age or century has brought forth, to look no further back to those
excellent men of former and obscurer times? Can you expect Crammers, Latimers,
Bradfords, Ridleys, Hoopers, Grindals, Whitgifts, Fletchers, Sands, Elmers,
Jewels, Kings, Abbots, Lakes, Bilsons, Babbingtons, Andrews, Feltons, Fields,
Cowpers, Whites, Davenants, Potters, Prideauxes, and Westfields; with many
others now at rest in the Lord, all venerable in their Episcopal order and
eminency; as fathers of the Church; and as elder brothers, among their brethen,
the other Ministers; whose humility disdained not to be subject to those
reverend Bishops; although some of them might be equal to them in eminent
gifts: Animi nil magnae laudis egentes. Virg. Aen.
Such as were Gilpin, Fox, Knewtubbs, Perkins, Whitaker, Reinolds, Willet,
White, Richard Hooker, Vmphry Overall, Greenham, Rogers, Dent, Dod, Heron,
Bifield, Smith, Bolton, Tailor, Hildersham, Crakanthorp, Done, Stoughton,
Ward, Holsworth, Shutes, Featly, and Doctor Sibs: (which last fragrant name, I
may not mention without special gratitude and honor due to the memory of that
venerable Divine: not only for the piety, learning, devotion and politenesse
of his two genuine writings, (The bruised Reed, and Souls conflict) but also
for that paternall love, care, and counsel, by which he much obliged me to
him in my younger years. Indeed that holy man I found altogether made up of
sweetness and smoothness, oil and honey. As his actions, so his gifts and
graces were set in a kind of Mosaic work, admirable for that meekness and
humility; which while they sought to conceal and shadow over his virtues, they
gave the greatest luster to them.

Besides these, there were an innumerable company of other immortal Angels;
but yet Ministering spirits to this Church of England; who are now made perfect;
and whom nothing would so probably afflict in heaven, as to see the degenerate
succession, both of Ministers and Christians, now likely to follow in this age;
Many of these and other Worthies of this function, in former times (as now)
living and dying in country obscurities, were buried in those sepulchers,
which they had made in the Gardens, (that is, those Dioceses or Parishes) which
they had planted, or diligently watered; and disposed by pious industry to a
pleasant, peaceable and happy fertility: Men, however different in some
external lineaments (as may be among Brethren) yet all of excellent features;
and some of the first three, both in beauty and strength for piety, learning,
judgment acuteness, eloquence, depth, devotion, charity, gravity, industry,
and a kind of Angelick majesty; at once both amiable and venerable, both in
their preaching, writing, and practice.

These great men and greater Ministers, have indeed left us behind them,
Ministers of the present age. Nos ingentium exempl^rum parvi imitatetes. Sal.
ad Agr.
a generation far inferior to them, (for the most part) more feeble, and
unable to work, or war; having more enemies, enjoying less encouragements,
(scarce any now considerable as to this world) bearing greater crosses, and
heavier burdens every way, for charge, duty and reproach; who are often forced
to lay out in public taxes a great part of that little, they have to buy
themselves books or bread: Who have only this advantage of our troublesome,
envious and evil times; that we may learn to be more humble in our selves;
more diligent in our duties; more charitable to others; and more valiant for
the Truth: hoping, that while we have after the primitive pattern, nothing left
to glory in, but the Cross of Jesus Christ, both our afflictions and
infirmities may prove opportunities to exercise, discover and increase the
graces of God and true Ministerial gifts in us, whose power can perfect it
self, and us too in the midst of our infirmities, and support us under the
many unjust oppressions, which threaten us. There are indeed yet left, through
Gods mercy in the field or forest of this Church, and Nation, some goodly old
Trees, both venerable Bishops, and worthy Presbyters, here and there: Some
shrewdly battered, and strangely neglected; which yet retain something that is
very goodly and graceful, amidst their battered tops and shattered arms; being
yet stately monuments or relics of that former benignity which was in this
English soil toward Churchmen and Ministers; many of whom grew to so tall a
procerity, as of learning and worth, so of wealth and honor, in some degree
answerable to their worth, and becoming that real dignity which was in them;
far more useful and considerable by wise men, than any bare descent of titular
honor. These I must be so civil to, as not to name any of them; that I may
avoid suspicion either of envy or flattery; (two most detestable distempers in
men's spirits, and full of malignity) Indeed I need not name some of them, for
although they are left, as cottages in a wilderness, and as beacons on a hill,
yet they are still such burning and shining lights, as cannot be quite hid:
Some of whose fame is in all the reformed Churches; and their eminency renowned
in all the learned world; being indeed the beauty and glory of these British
Nations; the pillar and honor of the Protestant party; the grand examples of
pious Prelacy, learned humility, holy industry; the great lights of this
Northern climate; Which alone might serve to fulfill, Which wonder in heaven
occasioned the learned studies of Ticho Brahe, and did, as he says, foretell
extraordinary light of learning and Religion. Tich. Brahe. Astro. Restius.
what the Cassiopeian flames did portend, by that new star in the year, 1572.
Shall this age be, not only guilty spectators, but cruel actors in their
distresses; whose necessities must needs be some reproach of the Nation; even a
public sin and shame, never to be expiated? Will it not be the height of
barbarity, to compel such persons to Bellisarius his Obolum? After so many
learned victories and triumphs, to force them to turn their books into bread;
or to be their own Cannibals, to feed on their own bowels, or to starve upon
others uncharitableness? O how sad and sordid is it for such learned worth to
be tried with want, and such piety be exercised by penury! O prodigy of
covetous cruelty, capable to astonish heaven and earth; which seeks to hide
its wickedness by its enormity; and to make its self incredible, by its
monstrosity and excess; men will think it a fable, which humanity (much more
Christianity) should so much abhor to act, or suffer to be done, when it is in
their power to help. O Divine Providence, which art indisputable, unsearchable,
uneffable; how do thou thus choose darkness for the garment of thy glorious
lights; and thick clouds of obscurity, wherein to wrap up thy brightest beams
among mankind! Art thou preparing Ravens for such Eliasses; and working
wonders for the nourishment of such Prophets? or shall their retiredness,
poverty and patience be thy greatest wonder, and their Martyrdom thy highest
miracle, by which to convince and convert this crooked and adulterous
generation? Truly, O excellent Christians, it is infinite pity, grief and
shame, that so deserving virtues and most reverend years should be so much
obscured and neglected, whose great learning and excellent gifts in all kinds,
no men or Christians would despise, or not use and encourage, save only such
as are afraid, that either the true reformed Religion, or true Ministers should
have any luster put upon them, or so much as any competent livelihood afforded
to them, here; while forain Churches and Universities admire them, and would
gladly entertain them.

There are also some fair Plantations of young and thrifty trees, yet left, in
this Church; whose luxuriant floridnesse wants nothing but a right Church
government, to culture, prune, and order them; These, rightly planted out by
due ordination, and preserved by wise discipline, would in time bear store of
good fruits; if the coldness and spowinesse of the soil, and inclemency of the
English climate (ever since our Northern blasts) did not make them dwindle,
grow mossy, and shrubbed by popular and plebeian adherencies; or if a violent
hand do not pluck them up by the root, or so bark them round, and circumcise
their maintenance; that no fair fruit can be expected from them, when there is
no sap derived to them; who, if they were duly ordered, and encouraged, would
still make the vain and erratick genius of this age see, That true Religion is
to be preserved, and the Kingdom of Christ in men's hearts advanced, and the
power of godliness maintained in Christians life's, not by new modes and
fancifull fashion, but by old truths, and the old Ministry; of whose line and
measure, these new pretenders coming far short, they strive by their
calumniating activity to supply their defects, after the same arts that the
ungrateful sons of Sophocles did; who, that they might get their fathers estate
(of whose longaevity they were impatient) complained; that he doted, and was
past the use of those admired parts, which formerly had got him the love and
applause of all Athens; beseeching the Magistracy, that they might make their
father their pupil, and manage that estate for him, to which he was
superannuated: The old man hearing of this practice of his unnatural sons,
made and publicly recited the famous, O^^ipus Coloneus.
and last of his Tragedies; which gave the people so great assurance of his
still remaining reason and sufficiency, that they caused the former unjust
grant to be revoked, and his unworthy sons worthily punished.

18. The impertinency and insufficiency of the Antiministerial pretenders.
I must in like manner leave it to the judgment and conscience of all excellent
Christians; whether there be any compare, between the gifts, labors, and
successes of those goodly Trees, the true Ministers; (who have had the right
power and succession derived to them from the Apostolical root) and these new
shooters, or suckers; who seek to starve the ancient trees, which so far exceed
them, and over drop them; Are they not like vines and brambles, thorns and
figtrees set together? Is not the comparison uncomely, and disparaging, not
only to Christians judgments, but to their very religion? Can the exchange
pass without infinite loss, injury, and indignity, to all true Christians, of
this, and all other reformed Churches? And therefore I shall presume such a
commutation can never be desirable or acceptable to any, that are soberly
religious, and truly conscientious; who have no secular interest wrapped up,
under specious pretensions of piety.

Wise and worthy Christians cannot but remember, and be extremely sensible, of
those many great benefits, which their forefathers themselves, and their
country, have evidently received and enjoyed many years, by the labors of the
true Ministers of this Church: equal or like to which, they cannot, with any
probability, (nor by any experience yet had) expect, from the sorry simplicity,
and extravagant ignorance of those Antiministeriall adversaries; who have as
little ability, as authority, to carry on the great and holy work, of saving
souls, either by dispelling ignorance, errors, or prejudices out of men's
minds; or by settling men's judgments in truth; or satisfying men's consciences
in doubts: (or by reforming men's manners in a way of due reproof, and discreet
counsel; or by vindicating the reformed Religion against learned cunning and
powerful opposers; or by preserving any decency, order, and honor in the
outward form and profession of Christian Religion, which will soon deform to
all contrary effects, if other Ministry or Ministers be applied, than such, as
Christ has instituted, and the Church always ordained, and sent in Christ's
Name.

No man then can desire, or design the change of this Ministry, as to the
authority, order, rule, and succession, who does not also aim at the change of
the whole Ministration, and work; Indeed those rude and unchristian novelties,
which some men seem to agitate; carry the aspect, not only of Papists, and
other collateral adversaries against us as reformed; but of Jews, and Turks,
and Heathens, such as would most diametrally oppose the name of any Christian
Church; or, which is as bad or worse, they seem to prepare the way for some
great Antichrists, 2 These. 2.10, 11.
whose coming must be by strong pretensions and presumptions of some new ways
of Ministry, Sanctity, and Piety; in which are hidden the strongest delusions,
most probable to overthrow the true Ministry and Churches of Christ, while they
shall speciously cry up such new ways of Ministry, and spirit, and gifts, and
Churches; which neither we, nor our forefathers, nor primitive Christians, nor
the Church Catholic, ever knew, or were acquainted with, either by Scripture
precept, or any Churches practice; for however the best reformed Churches have
restored many things to their pristine luster, yet they innovate nothing as to
Scripture grounds of doctrine, or Catholic order, succession and Institution.

As, then, those men are most the soldiers friends, 19. Address to men of the
Military order. Clem. Ep. ad Cor.
who advise them, to keep to their able and experienced commanders; and not to
venture their safety upon the activity, and feats of every forward and nimble
fencer: So are they most friends to all good Christians, Magistrates,
soldiers, or others in this Nation and Church, who persuade them (as Clemens
did the Corinthians) to keep to their ancient, able, and true Ministers, of
whom they have had so long, and so good experience; and although their persons
be changeable by death, or other ways of deprivation: yet ought the way and
succession to be preserved, as to that ordination, trial, and mission, which
is Apostolical, and universally practiced in the Church of Christ.

And since herein the Allusion, reason and proportion lies so fit, and equal
between worthy Ministers and able Commanders, who have a right Commission; I
cannot think, that any of the military order, who are persons of any worth,
true honor, conscience, or considerable for piety, prudence, and Christian
valor, (which dares any thing, but sin;) that any such soldiers, (I say)
should be prone to kindle any discontents and mutinies, against the able and
true Ministers of this Church. Docti Ministri f^^tes milites dirigant; justi
milites pros Ministros prot^gant. Illi veritate, hi virtute.
To whom (no doubt) they cannot but thankfully confess; that, under God, they
ow (for the most part) what ever good learning, good breeding, or good
conscience they have: I am the further from suspecting so unchristian, and
unreasonable a tempter in that sort of soldiers, because I know by experience
that in all the troubles and shakings, which have been in these times, those of
them who are sober and ingenuous men, have been both in public, and in
private very loving, civil, and respective to the true Ministers of this
Church: so that those who glory in their affronts, contempts, and oppositions
against the Ministers, do but thereby proclaim, that they are the very dross
and ruder dregs of that profession; (for so it is like to be in England:) Nor
can I think, that the irreligious motions, unruly mutinies, and inconsiderable
menacings, of a few such unbred men, should either over-sway or over-aw, the
sober counsels, and better purposes of those many better gentlemen, who sway
either in counsel or in power.

Whose protection, in all peaceable, and good ways, why the Ministers of
England should not as well deserve, hope for, and enjoy, as any other order, or
rank of men, I see no reason; unless injuries, obloquies and indignities
offered, by some of very mean quality and condition (for the most part) (and
hitherto borne with that Christian courage and patience, which becomes grave
and godly Ministers, should be argument enough to persuade all Christians to
forsake them, and destroy them;) of whose safety, and welfare (no doubt) God
himself, and the Lord Jesus Christ, are very sensible; as much concerned in
their sufferings: Nor can I think but that those men, who are so hardened in
their malice and persecution against the Ministers, and their holy function;
do often hear a voice secretly calling within them; O you Saul's, why do you
persecute me in my servants the Ministers; who preach my Word, in my Name, by
my authority, and accompanied with my grace and spirit?

11. In all Christian and true policy the true and ancient Ministry is to be
preserved. The Declaration of the two Houses, An. 41.
Yea, not only in all true Religion, and fear of God, which becomes true
beleivers, but in all reason, and policy of State, it is, as necessary for
those in places of power to protect the true Ministers, their divine calling
and succession, as for these Ministers to be protected by them; and this, not
only in order to Gods glory, and the good of men's souls, their own and others;
but for their own and the public peace, safety, and honor before men; Nor is
that promise, and obligation, (once given to the public) to be forgotten, by
which it was assured, that the Levying of soldiers, and raising of forces
should be only as scaffolds to build up learning, piety, and the reformed
Religion to higher heights, than formerly; and not as scaling ladders, to help
to storm, plunder, and impoverish the Church; to destroy the Arsenals, and
nurser^^s of good learning, or to pull down the main pillars both of learning
and the Christian reformed Religion; which are the ancient Ministry, and
succession of rightly ordained Ministers.

If those in power and counsel care not to help either in preserving, or
restoring the true Ministers, and their calling, to their due honor, rights or
encouragements: it will be thought rather a want of will, than of power, (of
which the British world has had great experience:) If they would help, but
cannot; they must not think long to enjoy that power, which shall discover it
self so weak, or so pusillanimous, as dares not own to be master of so pious,
safe, and just purposes, as these are, to protect honest and godly men, in so
holy, so useful, and so necessary an employment; as I have proved the Ministry
to be. If they can, and dare; yet do not; Esther 4.31.
either help will come another way, by the gracious hand of God; whose terrors
ought to be upon the highest minds and loftiest looks: Or else we may fear the
Lord has, in his fierce anger, decreed to power upon highest and lowest, root
and branch in this Nation, the vials of his sorest judgments, and severest
wrath, turning our Sun into blood, and our Moon into darkness; removing the
presence of his glory, the Gospel, and the Ministry of it from us, and our
unhappy posterity.

However God shall please to deal with his servants the true and faithful
Ministers in this Church; yet it becomes them so far to be of good courage, as
they have him for their trust, Ioh. 14.27.16.33.
who has overcome the world; who foretold we should have trouble in the world;
but has promised, we should have that peace in him, which the world cannot
give nor take away; This comfort they have, that their labors shall not be in
vain in the Lord: yea and for after times, they may be assured, That this bush
of the true Ministry of the Gospel in its due authority, divine ordination,
and holy succession, (wherein God has so evidently appeared to his Church; and
to none more clearly than to us in this age, and in this Church of England,
shall never be consumed; however it may seem to be set on fire: 2 Timothy 3.12.
Great tribulation threatens those, that will live godly in this present world;
especially those, that contract more of the devils malice on them, by
persuading many to live well; which is the work of true Ministers: whose
labors are great; their burdens many; their encouragement small; and those
greatly envyed: 2 Timothy 4.16. Vere magnum est habere fragilitatem hominis and
securitatem Dei, Seneca.
their enemies increased on every side; their comforters few; their defense
little or none, unless God be on their side; Which he will not fail to be,
though all men forsake them, as they did St. Paul; And he alone is able to bear
them up, amidst the rough encounters of these times, with that Christian
patience, courage and constancy, that becomes learned, and religious men; who
know, whom they have served; in whom they have believed; and may conclude,
there are more with them, then can be against them; whose upright souls, and
generous consciences, are, like Elishas mountain, 2 King. 6.17.
full of fiery charets and horsemen; that is, devout flames of judicious zeal,
which have upon them the harness of wisdom; and are managed with the reins,
of Christian meekness and discretion; far from those politic presumptions,
and enormous confidences of some Phaetons, who never think they enlighten the
Church enough, unless they set Kingdoms and States on fire, with wild and
extravagant furies; who are far from being the charets and horsemen of Israel;
for these, though they are fiery, yet they are orderly; and are patient of
government, though they excel in gifts.

12. Pathetick to true Ministers.
To such Ministers I here crave leave, as Elihu did, to make my address with
all humility and charity, as to my reverend Fathers, and beloved Brethren; You,
who have upon you the marks and characters of right Ordination, and true
Ministerial power; accompanied with competent gifts, Job 32.
sanctified learning, devout industry, holy zeal, unblameable lives, and good
consciences toward God, and toward all men; whose grand design is to give full
proof of those Ministerial gifts and endowments, which you were, upon due
trial, found to have, and to exercise that divine authority, which you
solemnly, and rightly received; to discharge that holy duty, which in the Name
of Christ, and by the power of his Spirit, was enjoined you, in the day of your
Ordination, by those, through whose hand the succession of that Ministerial
authority is derived from the Apostles: By all which, you were qualified and
disposed, not to get a good living or two; but to cast into the Sea of the
world, the net of the Gospel at Christ's word, to gain souls to God, and
Disciples to Jesus Christ; to teach and guide by sound doctrine, and holy
discipline the flocks committed to you, in your several places and
proportions: Your earthly entertainment is from the munificence and devotion of
men; but your heavenly calling and authority to be Ministers, is from Christ;
in whose Name you do all (as Ministers) and not in the peoples, whom some have
taught to grow tumultuous against you, and imperious upon you: Neither your
work, nor your chief reward depends upon men; Minimum sit mercedis quod a
seculo expectamus. Chrysol. (...). Chrysostom.
It is the least of your comfort, or encouragement, that can from thence be
expected, as nothing of your authority is from thence derived. Level not your
selves by popular crowchings, and base compliances in this high point of your
Ministerial power: It matters not much, how you be levelled, as to your
maintenance, for which you chiefly do depend, not upon envious men, but upon a
bounteous God; who will either give you liberally to enjoy all things, or
contentedly to want them; 1 King. 13.
The withered hands of these Jeroboams which are stretched out against you, may
at your prayers be restored to the ancient fullness, and favor used toward the
Prophets of the Lord in this land: If bonds and imprisonment, poverty and
contempt attend you in this world, yet be of good comfort, Christ your great
Master has gone before you, and both by word and example, by his life and
death has called you out of the world; armed you against it, and set you above
it; while insolent dust flies in your faces, and proud worms fight against God
in you, remember the battle is the Lords. Ephesians. 6.12.
The weapons of your warfare are spiritual, and of greatest proof in sharpest
affliction.

If you are to contend with principalities and powers, it must be, not by ill
language, by railing and Satyrick invectives, by secret plottings, and
practice, but by the primitive Ammunition of Patience and Prayers; by holy
perseverance in your Ministry; such as becomes the spirit of the Gospel, in
wisdom, learning, gravity; between the extremes of fear and flattery; with
humble love and charity to all men: Sueton. Vespas. Vit. Imperatorem stantem
mo^i oportere, moriens dixit: inter manus sublevantium extinctus.
It becomes you (as Vespasian said of Emperors) to dye upright in your
spiritual arms and harness, intent to your duty, fighting the good fight of
faith, till you have finished your course with joy. In the midst of crosses,
comforts grow best, as Lilies among thorns: The clouds of your enemies darts,
poisonous opinions, corrupt doctrines, fraudulent dealings, sharp arrows of
bitter speeches, fiery trials of persecuting menaces, your adversaries cruel
mockings, and insultings, your friends prevaricatings with you, withdrawings
from you, and forsakings of you; all these must only ((...)) stir up the more
to quicker flames of study, prayer, meditation, devotion, and holy resolution,
those many gifts and graces, that learning, eloquence, and sufficiency, which
are in you, as Christians, and as Ministers; wherein (to the praise of God) you
are not behind even the chiefest Ministers in the Christian world. You are not
now to expect Prebendaries, and Deaneries, and Bishoprics, as the honorary
rewards and encouragements of your studies, pains and piety; This age could not
bear your enjoying of them, though you used them never so well; It is your part
to know, as well to want them as to have them; Honoribus and divitiis carere
posse magni est animi, at recte uti posse est maximi.
and in stead of those, to prepare for poverty, contempt, and imprisonment; you
may be then at your best, when the evil world thinks you deserve no better;
Never study by any mean ways to merit better of sacrilegious spirits; Be sure
your treasure be out of these men's reach; It is your part to do well, and
worthy of your high calling: Leave it to God, how well you shall be rewarded
here and hereafter: Paul never preached with greater authority, than in his
chains; Act 26 29. Phil. 1.
nor wrote with greater eloquence and majesty then when he styled himself, a
prisoner of Jesus Christ; well doing will be reward enough, and a good
conscience will be good cheer at all times.

You cannot but observe, that your great enemy the devil, has commanded, (as
the King of Syria did) his Legions of Heretics, Schismatics, Fanatics,
erroneous, superstitious, idle, profane, licentious, and Atheistical spirits,
(who jointly combat against the truth of Christian and reformed Religion) that
they should fight neither against small, nor great, but chiefly against the
reformed Ministers, and the very Ministry it self of this Church. Take heed
that these smite you not, 1 King. 22 34
as those did the King of Israel, between the joints of your harness: between
your conscience of duty to God, and your civil compliance for safety with men:
between your love of Christ, and the love of your relations; between your fear
to offend God, and your lothnesse to displease men; between your holding your
livings, and keeping good consciences; between your looking to eternal
necessities, and your squinting on temporal conveniences.

Navigare necesse est, non item vivere, Appian.
As Pompey said, when he set to Sea in a storm, against the advice of the
timorous Pilot and Mariners; so I to you, It is not necessary to live, but it
is necessary to preach that Gospel, which has been committed to your care: 1
Cor. 9.16.
It is not necessary to be rich, and at ease, and in liberty, and in favor
with men; but it is necessary to witness to the Truth of God, and to that
office, authority and divine power of the Ministry of Christ in this Church,
against a crooked and perverse generation; against the errors, pride, falsity,
ignorance and hypocrisies which are in the world: What if Christ calls us in
this age to forsake all, Matthew. 19.22. Age vero, qui relinquere omnia pro
Christo disponis, te quoque inter relinquenda arnumerare memento. Ber. de dil.
and follow him? Shall we go away sorrowful? Truly the world will not treat
you much better, when you have forsaken Christ to follow it: For, having once
drawn you from your conscientious constancy, and judicious integrity, and
pious reserves, it will the more despise you, and with the greater glory
destroy you as Ministers: Our Ioh. 4.34.
meat and drink must be to do the will of our heavenly Father, as it was the
Lord Christ's, our great sender and first ordainer: Better we live upon alms
and beggary, than thousands of souls be starved or poisoned, by those hard
fathers, and terrible step-mothers, who intend to nurse Religion with blood in
stead of milk; and feed the Church of Christ after a new Italian fashion,
commanding stones to be for bread, and giving it Scorpions in stead of fishes;
mixtures of hemlock and Soulesbane, with some shows of herbs of grace, of
wholesome truths, and of spiritual gifts.

Let the envyous, penurious, sacrilegious, and ungrateful world, see that you
followed not Christ for the loaves; Nor as Judas, therefore liked to be his
Disciples, because you might bear the bag; Let no Scribes or Pharisees, Priests
or Rulers outbid your value of Christ, or tempt you to betray him, and his holy
Ministry on you; by any offers, unworthy of him, and you. Piorum afflictio non
est tam poena criminis quam examen virtutis. Aust. de S. Iobo. Act. 27.14.
Show your skill and courage in the storm, wherein you are like, (for a time)
to be engaged. Serener times made you carry slacker sails, and a looser hand;
now your eye must be more fixed, and your hand more strong and steady, in
steering according to cart and compass: the Euroclydons or violent winds of
these tempestuous times will bring you sooner to your Haven: Hitherto you have
(for the most part) appeared, but as other men; (busy, as other ants, on your
molehils) conversing with the beasts of the people, in the valley of secular
aims, and affairs; now God calls you with Moses up to the Mount; (...).
Chrys^st. in Act. ap. hom. 3. Matthew. 17.3.
and with Christ to a transfiguration, where you shall see the meekness, and
charity of Moses, with the zeal, and constancy of Elias appearing with Christ;
in which great Emblemes your duty, your honor, and your comfort will be
evident; when you come to be stoned with St. Stephen, the form of your
countenance will be changed, and you will then most fully see Christ, and most
clearly be seen of men, as the Angels of God. Act. 6 17. C. 7. 56.
Nothing has lost and undone many of us Ministers so much, as our too great
fear of losses and of being undone; our too great desires to save our selves by
complying with all variations, even in Religion; nothing will save us so
certainly, as our willingness to lose our lives, and livelihoods for Christ's
sake; and this, not now for one great truth, which is worth 1000 lives; but for
the pillar and ground of all truths; the office and very Institution of the
true Ministry, whose work is to hold forth, and publish the Truth of the
Gospel to the world in all ages, by a right and perpetual succession.

the Emperor highly incensed against them: Be of good courage; it is a good

may in time provoke this Nation by a sense of its own, and of Gods honor, to
more noble, and constant munificence, which is not so much a liberality as an
equity to able and faithful Ministers; It may be this Church, Gal. 4.15.
which has so much forgot the blessedness she spoke of, in having learned,
able, and rightly ordained, and well governed Ministers, Revel. 2.4.
which seems to have forsaken her first love and honor to the Clergy, when
Religion was (as in all times, preserved, so in these last) reformed, and
vindicated by the labors, writings, lives, and sufferings of those excellent
Bishops and Presbyters, who were heretofore justly dear and honored to this
Nation, so as no worthy mind envyed or repined at the honors and estates they
enjoyed: Possibly it may remember from whence it is fallen, and repent, and do
its first works: which were with piety, order, charity, true zeal, and
liberality, without grudging, or murmuring against the honor or maintenance;
much less the office, and function of the Evangelicall Ministers; whose pious
wisdom casting off only the additaments, and superstitious rags of man's
invention, yet retained with all reverence and authority, the essential
institutions of Jesus Christ; The disguised dress and attire, had no way
destroyed the being and right succession of holy things: but only deformed it
to a fashion, something different from their primitive majesty, beauty and
simplicity; by putting on, what was superfluous rather, than pernicious.

But, if there should not be in our days so just and noble recantations, from
this Church and Nation: yet, as Ministers of Christ it is fit for us to deserve
it; we are reduced but to the primitive posture of those holy Bishops and
Presbyters, who more sought to gain men to Christ, than honor and maintenance
to themselves; Better we cease to be men, than cease to be Christ's Bishops and
Ministers: we must do our duties, (...). Chrysostom. de Paul. (...). Is. Pel.
till we die; (having any opportunities) though we have no encouragements from
men; our lean, wasted, and famished carcasses (such as St. Chrysostom says
the Apostle Paul carried about the world, so much subdued by himself and
neglected, as if he had not been battered, and persecuted enough by others)
those will serve to be Temples of the Holy Ghost, and lively stones or pillars
to the reformed Church of Christ, as well as if they had the fatness of
Monks, and the obeseness of Abbots; whose fullness you will less have cause
to envy, when the pious industry of your poverty shall exceed the lazy
dullness, and useless fogginesse of many of them amidst their plenty; (which
no true reformed Christian grudges them, when they employ in industry,
humility, mortification, devotion and holy contemplation, as some of them do;
and thereby show, that plenty is no enemy to piety in them;) Let us show, that
neither is poverty an enemy to virtue in us: Though the Roman Clergy rejoice at
our penury; let not us repine at their superfluity, but wish them truth and
holiness, as ample, as their revenues; Above all, take heed, you do not
gratify them, or any others, of meaner spirits, with any desertion or abasing
of your holy calling, and Ministry, either in word, or in deed: Neither
adopting a spurious Ministry, of novell and popular production; nor giving over
the conscientious exercise of that, which you have received here by an holy and
right succession; your religious constancy in it will be the highest
vindication of it, to be of no mean and cravenly kind; which preaches more
out of duty and conscience to God, than from secular rewards from them.

Many of your afflictions, have been, still are, and are like to be as great,
so of long continuance: Such, as to which God (no doubt) has proportioned his
gifts and graces in you, that so by this great honorary of suffering, as
becomes you, both God may be glorified further in you; and you may be more
sensibly comforted, and amply crowned, by him; your losses will turn to your
greatest gains; and your desertions as from men, to your happiest fruitions of
God. The highest and spring tides of grace usually follow the lowest ebbes of
estate. Then are holy men at their best and most, when they seem least and
nothing to man; as those stars whose obscurity is recompensed with their
vicinity to heaven. Your restraints will be your enlargements; and your
silencings, will proclaim the worlds folly, and unhappiness, to deprive it
self of your excellent gifts; and also set forth your humility, who know how to
be silent with meekness and patience no less than to speak with wisdom and
eloquence.

I should not need, nor would presume here, to make any particular address to
those reverened Bishops, learned and godly fathers as yet surviving and almost
forgotten in this Church; (whose worth I highly venerate; toward whose
dignity, I never was, nor am either an envious diminisher, or an ambitious
aspirer: whose eminency every way has made good that abstract and character,
which I formerly gave, of a true Christian Bishop) if I did not observe, how
little they are for the most part considered by any ordinary minds, who
generally admire the ornaments more, than the endowments of virtue; Vulgar
spirits seldom salute any Deity, whose shrines and Temples are ruined: Few men
have that gallantry of mind which M. Petronius expressed to Julius Caesar,
when he led Cato to prison, whom he with other Senators followed, out of the
Senate, telling him: He had rather be with Cato's virtue in a prison, (...).
Xiphilin. in Pompeio.
than with Caesar's violence in a palace: The worlds vanity is prone to judge
those the greatest sinners, who are the greatest sufferers; whereas thousands
perish eternally by their prosperous successes, few by their calamitous
sufferings; The methods and riddles of divine dispensation and love are far
different from plebeian censures and flatteries: God suffers his Peter's to be
winnowed, and his Paul's to be buffeted: yea he grindes in the sharpest mils,
(as holy Ignatius desired) the corn he most esteems; casting his gold into the
hottest furnaces, Absit ut hoc argumento religiosos putemus a Deo negligi, per
quod confidimus plus amari, Sal. l. 1. Gub. de Aff.
to make it at once more pure in it self, and more precious to himself: It is
necessary (as Plato in Phado. (...).
Plato says) for the divinest minds to be abstracted from, and elevated above,
and even dead unto the very best of things mundane and sensible; although good,
lawful and laudable; which a wiser than Plato tells us are to be accounted, by
Apostolic and Episcopal piety, but Phil. 3.8.
as loss and dung in comparison of Jesus Christ, which honor and treasure of
your souls no envy, malice, fury or force can deprive you of.

This (no doubt) makes it seem not a strange thing to you, that the Lord has
thus dealt even with you; who have suffered the loss of all things, as to
those public, legal and temporary rewards of your studies, learning and
laborers: while yet you were uncondemned for any sin, that ever I have heard
of, committed either against the laws of God or man: only upon this account,
because you were Bishops or chief Presidents in the order, government and care
of this reformed Church; See the judgment of Bishop Cowper: a learned and holy
Bishop in Scotland: in his life written by himself.
according to the present Laws then in force, an^ agreeable (for the main) to
the practice of all pious Antiquity. I need not put your learned piety in mind
of that voice from heaven, which was audible to blessed Polycarp (a primitive
Bishop and Martyr at Smyrna) when he was haled at fourscore years old to
exe^ution, (the tumultuous rabble crying after him, (...), etc. Away with these
wicked ones, etc.) But the celestial echo was ((...)) O Polycarp be of good
courage, Eusebius. l. 4. hist. c. 14.
and quit thy self like a valiant man, a faithful Christian, and worthy Bishop
of the Church. None merit more to be preserved (many times) than they, whom
vulgar fury and faction seeks to crucify and destroy: Nor are any less
meriting than those, who are by such easy Idolaters commonly adored. I well
know, that there needs not greater incitations to constancy in virtue, or
patience in afflictions (especially if for no evil doing) than those, which
innocence suggests to good consciences; by which the grace of God has (no
doubt) enabled many of you to those ((...)) great agonies and victories of
faith, which you have (as Job) sustained in, and obtained over, the world, by
your meekness, and, to such as observe it, admired patience; Enduring at once
even from those of whom you had deserved, either as Brethren or Fathers, better
things, so great contradictions, and so many diminutions; as not only to have
been despised, yea and by some contumeliously used in your persons, ( venerable
for age, learning, piety and gravity) but also to be quite dejected from that
height, and utterly ejected from the enjoyment of those ancient places, to
which both high honors and ample revenews were anciently annexed; wherewith
your selves were justly invested, and which your predecessors peaceably enjoyed
many hundreds of years past, in this Church and Nation: Herein you have
excelled most of the ancient Bishops; who, although great and commendable
sufferers, as Martyrs or Confessors; yet seldom from those, who were of the
same faith and orrhodox profession; Gregory Naz. indeed was stoned and reviled
when he came to Constantinople; and rejoiced to be so entertained, because they
were of the Arian faction; enemies of Christ's glory and godhead, which is the
Churches greatest glory and comfort: Naz. orat. Lat.
In like sort diverse godly and Orthodox Bishops were molested, banished,
imprisoned and destroyed by prevalent Heretics and Schismatics, who yet ever
set up Bishops of their own leaven and faction: For however men dared much
against several truths and fundamental doctrines of Christianity; yet never
till of later times did they rise to the boldness of denying and destroying
the evident Catholic custom of the Churches government by Bishops as chief
among the Presbyters: how ever single Tenets might be dark and disputable; yet
this was so clear by universal practice and consent, that none ever gainsayed
it, that were of any repute for learning or piety among the ancients. Your
sufferings are the more strange and remarkable in this; that they are from
those, who solemnly protested to maintain the Protestant reformed Religion, as
it was established in the Church of England; in the extern order and policy of
which, you then were, and had at all times been, chief pillars and ornaments.

In this so strange and sudden alteration, men soberly learned and peaceably
pious, (and uncovetously Christian) do still with all respect and reverence to
you and your Order, consider; not only that great and undeniable
justification, which you have from the Laws, wisdom and piety of this Church
and State ever since they were Christians; as also from the Catholic and
undoubted practice of all ancient Churches, blessed every where with the
excellent lives, learned labors, and glorious sufferings of many your famous
predecessors; to whose care and fidelity the Church owes, for the most part,
(under God) as the lawful succession of Ministers, so the preservation of the
Scriptures, of good learning, and of all holy administrations; But also they
lay to heart that great humility, moderation, meekness, candor, and charity,
most worthy of you, and most observable in you; By which you have been as sheep
before the Shearers, not opening your mouths, yea you were, in order to
public peace, content so far to gratify your enemies, and displease your
friends, as in many things to have been lessened, in those rights and
preheminences you had, according to the Laws and ancient customs of this
Church and State; hereby hoping to have drawn others from their exorbitancies,
to such a peaceable temperament, as might have been happy for us all.

Nor is it unobserved by wise men, how great a justification the providence of
God has soon given even to your order and office, (which some Ministers were
so impatient not to root out) not only by the preservation of it, and by it a
constant Ministry and holy order in his Church every where for 1600 years, but
also by that notable confutation and speedy defeat given to the vast hopes and
violent projects of those (for other men's counsels and results upon a secular
account I neither examine nor censure) Ministers, who being of your own tribe,
were your sharpest rivals in a Presbyterian excess: who have now as little
cause to rejoice, in the so much endeavored extirpation not of any Tyrannique,
and Papal, but of all Presidentiall or Paternall Episcopacy; that they have
great cause to repent, and be ashamed of those immoderate counsels and
precipitant actions, which knew not how to distinguish between the failings of
persons, and the benefit of order; between the rectitude of a Canon, or rule,
and the crookedness of depraved manners; which are incident to all sorts and
degrees of men whatsoever, and to Presbyters no less than to Bishops: So that
in such severities, which ruined at a dear and dangerous rate, what they might
have repaired safely and easily, they showed themselves neither good
Churchmen, nor wise Statesmen; neither very pious, nor greatly politic; For,
by snuffing Episcopacy too close, they have almost extinguished Presbytery; and
occasioned this ruin, threatening the order, honor, maintenance, and
succession of the whole function, and calling of the Evangelicall Ministry;
Their zeal not to leave an hoof in Egypt (as some violent spirits pretended) is
probable to bring us back again to Egypt; or so lose us in the wilderness of
Sin, as few heads in after ages shall enter into Canaan: No wonder if the
branches wither, when the root is wasted. It is comely in your piety and
gravity, that you have not rejoiced in these so sudden defeats, and speedy
frustrations of their so bitter and implacable adversaries; whose tongues (it
seems) dividing, their building ceased and soon decayed: But rather you pity
these confusions incident to poor mortals; who so often bruise themselves very
sorely, by the fall and ruins which they maliciously, or unadvisedly bring
upon others: as those violenter Presbyters have done even upon Presbytery it
self, who in its due place and decent subordination is also an ancient,
honorable and Catholic order of the Church of Christ, by their hasty
demolishing of all moderate Episcopacy, where one Minister is preferred before
another, agreeable to the eminency of his gifts and graces; the priority of his
age; the rules of all right reason and order, which ownes any government in any
society of men; The gobdly height and orderly strength of which Prelacy was,
not only as the root for right derivation and succession, but also as the
shelter, stay and protection (besides a great beauty and ornament) to the whole
Ministry, of this and all Churches; yea and to the reformed Religion here as
established; as not with less piety, so (without boasting) with as much (if
not not more) prudence and moderation, as to the externe policy of it, as in
any Church under heaven: The want of that great benefit and those many
blessings, which the Churches of Christ, both in primitive and postern times,
have enjoyed, by the learning, wisdom, authority, care, circumspection, and
good example of excellent Bishops (whom no men will want more, than the
commonalty of Presbyters) may in time (according to the usual methods of
humane folly, and passions, late and costly repentings) make men the more
esteem them, and desire their just restoration; Servil. de Mirand.
The ancient Persians are reported, when their King dyed, to have allowed five
days interregnum; during which time every man might do what seemed good in
his own eyes; That so by the experience of those five days rudeness, riot,
injuries and confusions; wherein rich and poor suffered, they might learn more
to value the necessity and benefit of lawful, orderly and settled government;
Want does often reconcile men to those things, Carendo magis quaem fruendo de
bonis recte judicamus.
which long use has made nauseous, and so offensive to them: when wanton
novelty has glutted and defiled it self with its pudled waters; possibly it
may grow so wise, by an after wit, as (ashamed of it self) to return to the
primitive springs, and purer fountains; where was both far more clearness,
and far wholesomer refreshings. Your charity forgiving and pitying your
enemies, and your humility digesting your injuries and indignities offered you
by any men, will invest you in more, than all you ever enjoyed or lost, as to
real comfort and gracious contentment; By how much you now have less to be
envyed of secular splendour, the more you will be now, and in after ages admired
for your meekness and contentedness in every estate; Primitive poverty of
Bishops will but polish and give luster to your Primitive piety; Humane
disgraces are often the foils and whetstones of divine graces. The highest honor
as of all good Christians, so chiefly of godly Bishops and Ministers, is not
only to (...). Is. Pel. l. 2. 133. (...). Cl. At. (...).
preach and rule; but to suffer also as becomes the eminency of their places
and graces; Christ is (for the most part) on the suffering side; and oftener to
be found, not only in the Temple, but in the furnace and wilderness, than in
Courts and Palaces.

I may not (I hope I cannot) flatter any of you, so, as to tempt you to boast
of your Innocence, to glory in your merits, or your crosses before God; His
exactness finds dross in the purest vessels, and defects in the weightiest
shekels of the Sanctuary, showing the most innocent and meritorious persons (as
to men) so much of sinful infirmity in themselves, as may both justify Gods
inflictings, and provoke the afflicted to true repentings; either for any
excesses, to which they might be transported, as men; or defects, whereto they
might be subject, as Bishops and chief Ministers in the Church of Christ; whose
holy industry and pious vigilance before God ought to be proportioned to those
eminencies, which they enjoyed above others in the eye of the world; All that I
aim at, in this Paragraph, is by this touch of Christian sympathy, to express
a sense of duty, gratitude, honor and love, which I owe to God, and for his
sake to your Paternity: Also to deprecate any offense, which I either really
have, or may seem to have given any of you; To whose hands chiefly I owe, what
I count my greatest honor, my being duly ordained to be a Minister of the
glorious Gospel of Jesus Christ in this Church of England.

times, while you possess your learned and gracious souls in patience. Ad

Gregory Nazianzen and Nissen call it, a sublimity fuller of envy and danger,
than of glory and dignity; A dreadful Precipice, hard in the ascent, laborious

in Act. hom. 3.
Nor does he think it ((...)) a preheminency so much, as pains; rather a
burden and oppression, than any honor or exaltation: And indeed to great and
excellent minds, there was nothing in your former height and splendour, truly
worthy of your ambition or others emulation, save only the larger
opportunities they afforded you, not of being better in your selves, but of
doing more good to others. Of which conveniences being now deprived, as you
will have less to account for to God; so the noblest revenge you can take of
the present age is, by patience under so profuse afflictions, by your prayers
for your most unjust and unplacable enemies, by your constancy in studious
industry and holy gravity, to let the world see, how impossible it is, for true
Christian Bishops, not to be doing, or desiring good (while they live) to all
men; and even to those, from whom they have suffered much evil without a cause.

Your experienced piety knows better, how to act, than I can write; as to true
contentment in the world, contempt of the world, triumphing over the world, and
expectations above the world; your storms and distresses, though (decumani)
great and vast, cannot be long; And to be sure will never be beyond your Pilots
skill, who looks on you as sufferers; if not for the fundamental saving
Truths, yet for the comely order and ancient government of his Church; Many of
you are already in prospect of that fair and happy haven of eternal
tranquillity: To which I beseech our God, and Lord Jesus Christ, the chief
Bishop of his Church, safely to conduct you by the wisdom and power of his
Spirit: As for your fatherly solicitude and Christian care of this Church and
posterity, God will relieve you, by assuring you, that he has so vigilant and
tender care, as will cause all to work together for good; Nor shall the
insolency of enemies, forain or domestic, who are pleased with your disgraces,
and enriched with your spoils, always triumph in the ruins of the Bishops,
Ministers, and this Church of England. Since then nothing is more apposite than
the words of one of your own degree and order, Gregory Nazianzen (famous for
his piety and learning, zeal and patience) I crave leave with all pristine
respects to present you with that elegant and consolatory expression, (...).
Naz. orat. 32.
which he uses to some godly Bishops whom the Arian fury had dethroned from
their seats. Such of you (says he) as are thrust from your Episcopal Chaires
here on earth, yet are not forsaken of God: You shall enjoy surer seats in the
heavenly Cathedral, which is infinitely more high and happy: No good and wise
man but prefers holy obscurity, before prmpous injury. A mind exercised with
such gracious literature as yours, will know better how to enjoy its own
wisdom, and others follies; its own sufferings, and other indignities; than
vain men can their seeming plenty and prosperity: wise and holy men draw good
and wholesome nourishment out of dinners of sour herbs; Non minoris est
gloriae been tolerata paupertas, quam magnae opes innocenter partae and modeste
habitae. Tacit. An. l. 4.
while other turn to poison and surfeit their staled Oxen.

I beseech you therefore Reverend fathers and brethren by the mercies of God,
by the bowels of Christ, by your zeal for the truth, by your love of this
reformed Church, and your Country; by your former experiences of your prospered
labors; by your Christian victories of the many enemies over your order,
profession and calling, who have hitherto only scolded, and railed at you, and
put rude affronts upon you, but neither lawfully fought you with the weapons of
either Scripture, or Reason: I beseech you by the care and charity you have to
your neighbors souls; by the necessity which lies on you to preach the
Gospel, and administer holy things; by the woe which hangs over you, if you
do not, or draw back; by the compassion and tenderness you have to posterity,
that the reformed Religion may not be abolished, and all superstitious
vanities, with fanatic profaneness and confusions, prevail in these sometime
fortunate Islands;

I conjure you by your patience and perseverance hitherto under many trials,
both in war and peace; (which may be to you the sharpest war) by the peace and
joy you have had in the holy Ghost, and in well doing, and comely suffering; by
your hopes of heaven, and the glory, which shall be revealed in you; by the
coming again of Christ your Master and sender; Si pertinacia in errore tantas
ha^et vires, quantas in re ^ona haqere delet vastantia. Aust. Ep. 157.
by the Talents you have received; by the accounts you are to give; by the
Crown you may expect; by all the thoughts of honor, virtue, grace, glory,
immortality, eternity, which your precious souls and raised minds are capable
of; by all that is dear to you, and worthy of you as men, as Christians and as
Ministers: by the obstinate pertinacy of your enemies in their malice against
you: Never desert your station as Ministers of the Church of England; to quit
and forsake your standing, as some have done, is to sacrifice your
understanding to vulgar folly and senseless importunities; cast not away your
holy profession; betray not that due and divine authority you have by your holy
ordination in this Church; wipe not off with your own or the peoples unwashed
hands that sacred unction, which is upon you, by your being duly consecrated,
through the gifts, order, power, authority and appointment of the Spirit of
Christ, to the office and work of the Ministry: Divert not your studies to any
other more gainefull, safe, plausible, and honored profession among men; whose
dishonor it is to think any thing more worthy of their honor; as it is the
honor of Ministers, to suffer dishonor upon that account, because they are
Christ's; whose ways being less agreeable, no wonder if his message, and
messengers be less acceptable to the world: Let not the soft fleeces on any
Wolves backs deceive you; as if you might well spare your labors, when there
are so many spontaneous Preachers: Be sure you outlive them in all ways of
true holiness; you can easily (as you do) far out-preach them and out-pray
them, both for truth, method, judgment, and Oratory: It is neither their
learning, nor their conscience, nor their eloquence you have to contend with,
but their ignorance, hypocrisy, and insolence: when these clouds shall thunder

Cannot you be content to be such poor, despised and persecuted Preachers, as

Such as the most of our brethren are now, or lately have been, or are likely

O glorious spectacle! O venerable Council! O truly Christian Synod, and
sacred Assembly; not of Presbyters, scorning and extirpating their Bishops; but
of Reverend Bishops and humble Presbyters; all of them in their due order and
holy subordination, renowned for their constancy in persecution, and so most
worthy to be Ministers of the mysteries of Jesus Christ! Shall we now be
ashamed (as a more soft and delicate generation) of their scars and maims? Have
we so striven for the right and left hand in Christ's Kingdom of Church
Government, as to forget to drink of Christ's cup, and to abhor to be baptized
with his baptism, which was not of water only, Matthew. 20.22.

enemies? Or as Chrysostom, Ruffin. l. 1. Eccles. hist. c. 14.

If you be indeed conscious to your selves of any fraud and falsity, of any
sinister and unsincere way, by which your predecessors, and you after them,
have either attained or maintained your Ministry, and function in this Church;
if you know any thing unreasonable, unscripturall, uncomely, immorall,
irreligious, or superstitious, in the way or work; in the means, manner, or end
of your Ministry; if you are guilty of any thing different from, or contrary to
the rule and way of Christ, his Churches good, his Fathers glory; dangerous to
your own, or others men's souls; In Gods name, repent of your sin betimes,
recant your learned folly, renounce your ancient standing; Do this (as most
worthy of you) heartily, ingenuously, publicly, that by the foil of your
shame, the luster of Gods glory may be more set off. Gratify at length, (not
now your enemies, but your friends, because your Monitors and reformers) the
Papists, Socinians, Separatists, Brownist^, Anabaptists, etc. with what they
have so long and so earnestly desired, to such an impatience, as you see now
threatens to cudgel you to a recantation of your Ministry, if you will not do
it by fair means and plausible allurements: O how joyful and welcome news
will it be at home and abroad, to hear, that you, as Ministers of the Church of
England, have not only helped to put down Bishops, and abolish Episcopacy; but
you have, (to perfect your repentance, and to cumulate the courtesy) abjured
your Office, renounced your standing, abdicated your calling, prostrated your
Ministry at the feet of any, that list to kick at it, or tread upon it; Calca^e
me saelem insipidum. Eusebius.
and upon you too; as Ecebelians; as unsavory salt, that is good for nothing,
unless it be new boiled in an Independent Gauldron, over a Socinian Furnace,
with a popular fire! O hasten to remove your selves from that rock of ages, the
Catholic ordination and succession, on which the Church and Ministry has so
long stood in all places, as a City on a hill, both in peace and persecutions:
and level your selves to those smoother quicksands, which would fain level
you to themselves.

You will never be able to suffer what threatens you as Ministers of the old
standing and way, with cheerfulness and comfort; where your constancy is but
pertinacy; as it is, unless you have solid grounds, sound minds, and sincere
hearts; if you have any scruples, or thorns in your feet, your motions must
needs be painful, tedious and uncomely. When you are converted, help to redeem
us, (the remnant of your poor seduced brethren) from our errors and mistakes;
from our mists of ignorance, our chains of darkness; from our Catholic
customs; from our Ecclesiastical Canons; from our historical testimonies;
from that holy succession, that Apostolical practice, that Scripture
foundation, that divine institution; by all which we fancy our selves both
solidly built and strongly supported; And this we have done in the simplicity
of our souls, both we and our Forefathers for many generations; not only since
the last reformed century; but for a thousand and half a thousand years
before, even ever since the Christian Religion has been planted, propagated,
and continued, by such consecrated Bishops, and such ordained Ministers in all
the world.

If you have found nothing of God go along with your Ministry, either in your
own breasts, or your peoples hearts, or your Predecessors labors; if you are
justly unsatisfied in that Ordination, and succession, by which not only the
Ministerial authority, but all Christian privileges and rites have been
derived to you in this Church; if you never found it confirmed to you by Gods
blessing on your own, or others Ministry in your way; if you do indeed find
a brighter light, a warmer heat, and a sweeter influence from those new
Parelii, which of late have appeared in our sky, Parelii are the seeming or
mock-sunnes which sometime appear with the true Sun; as there did two here in
England, an. 1640.
as rivals in brightness to our old Sun, in number exceeding it; yea now
threatening to eclipse it, and utterly expel it out of its ancient orb and
sphere: if you really judge, that you have cause to Romans 3.8. (...), etc.
blaspheme, or to speak evil of those seemingly holy, and reputedly excellent
Bishops and Ministers, of this Church; as if they had hitherto to been liars
for God, deceivers for Christ; done evil, that good might come thereby; if you
judge, that you have cause to reproach, traduce, and despise all those
Christians, (whose profession, full of order, humility and holiness has been
the crown and glory of this Church, and the Ministry of it) as if they had
been silly souls, whom Ministers smooth tongues had only deceived; If you
can, or dare to reprobate all those, both godly Pastors and people, to annull
their Ministry; to overthrow their Faith; to wash off their baptism; to cast
out their Sacraments; to despise their Sermons; to laugh at their prayers; to
cancel their writings; to detest their examples; to vilify their graces, as
fancifull, hypocritical, spurious, supposititious, superstitious, imaginary,
unauthoritative, antichristian.

If you find in your consciences good grounds for this boldness of censure;
and consequently for a separation, profanation, and abnegation of your former
way, both as Ministers, and as Christians, (for renounce one, and you must
needs begin both; If you had no true Ministers, then you were no true
Christians; and if no true Christians, you could be no true Ministers;) if so,
follow by all means with speed your later and diviner dictates; please your
selves in your happy inconstancy; hasten to disabuse the people of this Nation,
whom so many holy seducers, the Bishops and Ministers of old have abused: O
undeceive the miserable and only nominall Christians of this age, before they
perish in their errors and confidences of having true Ministers, and true
Sacraments, true Christ, true Faith, true Repentance, etc. O deplore with
bitter lamentation, the many poor creatures, both Shepherds and Sheep, who
are gone down to the pit: death gnaweth upon them, while they dyed in so
zealous and dangerous errors, in so fond a Faith, in so vain hopes, as
mistook the gates of hell for heaven; Antichrist for Christ among us: you may
well bless your selves in so glorious a change; and boast of your gracious
Apostasy: Hasten to beget some new Church body, which may give you a new call
and standing; which may rebaptize you, reordain you, and ere long invest you in
such an office, power, and Ministry, as they and you shall think more valid,
more authentic, more Christian, more comfortable; which has surer footing,
and better standing both in the favor of the times, and of God himself.

But if Scripture, and Reason, and consent of all holy learned men in this and
other Churches; is Catholic custom, particular experiences, and holy
successes; if divine testimony, clouds of witnesses, of blessed Ministers, and
blessed people; of blessed Sermons, and blessed Sacraments; of blessed lives,
and blessed deaths; of blessed Converts, and blessed perseverants in grace; if
these be as mighty bars, cross your consciences, which stop you either from a
weak retrogradation to old Popery, or a wicked precipitancy to new vulgarity;
if neither your judgment, nor your conscience can bear such a rude revolt,
without great violatings of the one, and woundings of the other; if you dare
not in a fit of popularity, so injure the dead, that are at rest in the Lord,
so discourage the living and thriving Christians, so overthrow the Faith of
many, so blaspheme the God, the Savior and the Spirit of those holy men and
women, living and dead, who have been called, and converted, and sanctified,
and confirmed, and saved by that Word of Power, and those holy Ministrations,
which your Fathers, and your Brethren, and your selves the Ministers of this
Church have duly preached and administered, in that office, standing and
authority, wherewith they were and you now are duly invested in this Church;

I beseech you, then, be so valiant, as to dare to be, and still to own your
selves, as true Ministers of Christ in this Church, ordained by him, and for
him: still seeking the things of Christ in the good old way of the ordained
Ministry, while others seek their own in their new models and fashions. Do
not study to disguise your selves (no not outwardly) as if you were afraid your
coat should discover your calling; or as if you pretended to have renounced it
with your changed habit: you may preserve white souls under black clothes; as
others may black souls under spendid colors: your sable color, although very
becoming the gravity of your calling in the best times, yet was never more
decent than now, when (besides that you are Ministers) you have cause to be
mourners: Add not to the other confusion of times, this of your garments; nor
gratify them so far as a shoe-latchet in your clothes, whose aim is to level
and confound your calling with the meanest of the people: Although I placed
heretofore no Religion in clothes and colors, yet now I almost think it piety
to persevere in such a fashion, whose change would argue inconstancy, and so
far be irreligious, as it is acceptable to the erroneous, confirms them in
their errors, and casts some shame upon the truth, both of our Ministry and
our Church; In such a case a few grains of frankincense are not to be offered
to any Idol. It was in ancient times thought an heavy punishment, for a
Presbyter to be deposed from his degree and office, so as to be treated but as
a Layman; O do not seek to desecrate, depose, or disguise your selves; hang not
out the flags of your motly Coats, or pybald colors, as if you had taken from,
or rendered up your orders to high shoes, and quitted that distinction you
anciently have from the Vulgar; Since you did not ordain your selves, but were
consecrated by the Word, and authority of Christ, through the hands of those
who had received power to send you in Christ's Name, into Christ's harvest; why
should you study or affect those mean palliations and miserable confusions,
which are uncomely for men of holy gravity, learned constancy, and religious
honor? Other men have dared much more in worse adventures, and more
unwarrantable undertakings: You cannot adventure your many talents of learning,
and ingenuous parts, your studies, labors, liberties, and life's in a safer
way, or on a better account; than in that ship where Christ is imbarqued, and
so many precious souls with him; you need no other policy entered to insure you,
than this, that you deal for Christ, as his Factours for souls, and Agents for
that heavenly commerce between God and sinners.

Therefore bold fast your profession, so, as neither to be ashamed of, nor a
shame to your holy calling and Ministry; whose honor depends not on factious
fancy, or vulgar novelty, but on divine Institution, and Catholic succession;
Let the souls of men and the purity of Religion, be then dearest to us, when
they are grown cheapest to others: Let our lives be strictest, when liberty is
made a cloak to licentiousness; There will never need more true Ministers,
than when every man shall be tolerated to be a Minister; that so true ones may
be suppressed, and none but false encouraged: That the ties of Duty and
Conscience may lie upon none, either as Ministers, or hearers; as Pastor, or
flock, to attend any holy public worship and service of God: which is the
high way to Atheism, superstition, confusion, any thing but the true Christian
and reformed Religion. Abate not your labors, though men grudge, withdraw, and
deny your wages; What can be more glorious than to see you contentedly poor
for Christ's sake, 2 Cor. 6.10.
and still continuing to make many rich; while you are exhausted and have
nothing? imparting things spiritual, though you receive little or nothing of
things temporal? this is after the pattern in the mount, after the example of
divine munificence, where goodness is of free grace, and not of the reward or
merit. Make any honest shift to live, but use no base shifts to leave your
calling; Better your tongues cleave to the roof of your mouths, than you
should renounce your Ordination and Ministry; or cease to preach in that Name,
while you have power, liberty, and opportunity; Nothing will become us
Ministers better, than threadbare coats, if we can but keep good consciences:
Nothing will be sweeter, than dry morsels and sour herbs, P^ov. 15.7.
and a cup of cold water, (the Prophets portion) if we have but inward peace,
and the love of Christ therewith.

Photius Biblioth. in Chrysostom.
It was articled against Saint Chrysostom, (when he was Bishop of
Constantinople) by some of his envious enemies, as a matter of pomp and
scandal, that he rode in the City upon an Ass, to ease his age. It will be
less offense, when the world shall see holy Bishops and deserving Presbyters
go on foot, Psalm. 45.16. Eccles. 10.7.
and asses riding upon them; Princes (which Saint Jerome interprets Bishops) on
foot, and servants on horseback; Though we be never so low, let us do nothing
below the dignity of our Ministry, which depends not on external pomp, but
inward power; the same faith, which shows to a true beleiver, the honor and
excellency of Christ, sets forth also the love and reverence due to his true
Ministers of the Gospel; who are in Christ's stead, when they are in Christ's
work and way, and need not doubt of Christ's and all good Christians love to
them.

An high point of wisdom, For Verity.
and piety would be in all true Ministers, of what degree soever, As
Constantine the Great, burned all the bills of complaints exhibited by the
Bishops and Churchmen, one against another. Eusebius. vit. Constable. Privatae
simultates publicis utilitatibus condonandae. Tac.
would be to take the advantage of this Antiperistasis; by the snow and salt,
as it were, of papal and popular ambition, they should be the more congealed
and compacted together into one body and fraternity: Having so many unjust
enemies on every side, against every true Minister of this Church, whether
Bishop or Presbyter; all prudence invites us to compose those unkind
jealousies, breaches and disputes which have been among us, because we own our
selves, as brethren; among whom some may be elder in nature, or superior in
authority without the injury of any: This subordination, if Scripture do not
precisely command, yet it exemplarily proposes; Reason advises; and Religion
allows; and certainly Christ cannot but approve; the more, because the pride
of Papal Antichrists on one side, and the unrulinesse of popular Antichrists
on the other side studies to overthrow it, and are the most impatient of it. I
know some men's folly will not depart from them, though they be brayed in a
mortar: But sober men will think it time to bury (as Salvae fidei Regula de
disciplina contendentibus suprema lex est Ecclesiae paex. Blondel. (...). Naz.
or. 14. Vincamur ut vincamus. de dissid. Christianorum.
Constantine the Great burned) all unkind disputes, breaches and jealousies,
which have almost destroyed not only the Government, but the very Ministry it
self of this Church: No doubt, passions have darkened many of our judgments;
earthly distempers have eclipsed our glory; secular and carnal divisions have
battered our defenses, discovered our weaknesses, and invited these violent
assaults from enemies round about; that none is so weak, as to despair of his
malices sufficiency to do us Clergy men some mischief; the most tatling
Gossips, the sillyest she is, who are ever learning and never come to the
knowledge of the truth, undertake, Clemens in his Apostolic Epistle, advised
any one to depart, if he finds for his sake the dissension is in the Church.

not only to be teachers, but to teach their teachers, as Tertullian observed;
yea and to Ordain their Ministers; such (no doubt) as they do deserve, having
such Preachers for their greatest punishments.

The kind closing and Christian composing of passionate, and needless

order and government to be used in the Church, (which have chiefly (if not
only) brought so great misgovernment upon us, in Enggland) would be a great
and effectual means to recover the happiness of this Church, and the honor
of the Ministry; which consists in an holy fraternity and godly harmony of
love, no less than in truth of doctrine, and holiness of manners; By our own
leaks and rents we first let in these waters which have sunk us so low, that
every wave rakes over us. No man, that is truly humble, wise, and holy, will be
ashamed, to retract any error and transport, whereof he has been guilty, and
of which he has cause to be most ashamed; Greg. Nazianzem offered himself to
be the Jonas to the Church then troubled with sedition. in vita Naz.
Ingenuous offers of fraternall agreement, and mutual condescendings to each
other had been exceedingly worthy of the best Ministers both of the
Episcopal, Presbyterian and Independent way, whose wisdom and humility might
easily have reconciled and united the several interests which they pretend to
support, of Bishops, Presbyters, and Christian people. But who sees not that
secular designs, and civil interests have too much leavened the dissensions
of many Ministers, though in the conclusion they have not on any side much made
up their cake by the match? while Church men, Bishops, and Presbyters, had no
such worldly concernments to engage them, they had no such disputes, and
mutinies, as to the order and government of the Church; which no Council, no
particular Bishops, nor Presbyters, no one Church or Congregation of Christians
began of themselves; but all by Catholic and undisputed consent conformed
themselves to that order, Irenaeus, l. 4. c. 43. etc. 45.
which the Apostles and Apostolical men left in common to the Churches in
every place, most suitable to their either beginning or increasing, to their
settling, or their setlednesse.

It is easy to see what Christ would have in the Church, as to extern order
and policy, if Christians would look with a single eye at Christ's ends. You may
easily see how the worlds various interests, (which are as hardly commixt with
Christ's, and true religion's, as oil with water) serve themselves with
Ministers tongues, pens, and active spirits; who should rather serve the Lord
Jesus and his Church, in truth, simplicity, peace, and unity; without any
adherences to secular policies, parties, and studies of sides; by which sudden
and inconsiderate rowlings to and fro, (as foolish and fearful passengers in
a tottering boat) some Ministers of England have welnigh overturned the Vessel
of this reformed Christian Church, which might easily (as the most famous and
flourishing Churches anciently were) have been uprightly balanced, and safely
steered by a just fitness and proportion of every one in their place, either
for Ministry, or Government, and Discipline; where of old the paternall
presidency of Bishops stood at the helm; the grave and industrious Presbyters
rowed, as it were, at the Oars; and the faithful people, as the passengers
kept all even, by keeping themselves in quietness, order, and due subjection.
Nor was it wont in primitive times, to be asked of Princes, or people, how they
would have the Church governed, or by whom; who should ordain Preachers; or
who should preach the Gospel, administer the Sacraments, confirm the baptized,
censure the scandalous, and receive the penitent; These were mysteries proper
to Christian Religion, and entrusted to the Pastors of the Church, at first:
also conserved by them in the midst of hot persecutions from secular
Magistrates, without any variations, save only such, as necessity of affairs
and Christian prudence (yet in an orderly way) required and practiced, as to
some circumstantials: which was no more, than for a child from his coats to
come to breeches, or for the bark of a tree to increase, as the bulk and
branches grow.

What humane passion then, and inconsideration has any way wounded, wisdom
and Christian compassion in Ministers of all sorts should seek to cure; The
wounds of the Church will commonly fester and gangrene, if Ministers stay, till
Lay men take them to heart; nor is the hand of any of them so proper as them,
who have occasioned most hurt: we Ministers ought to be the good Samaritans,
and by first healing the deformed scars of our own scandals; the boiling Ulcers
of our own passions; the gaping orifices of our own religious dissenfions, our
influence will be much more soverain, and benign to draw together, and heal up
the public sores of the Church, and reformed Religion; when we appear fit for
so holy and good a work, it may be God will put it into the heart of those in
power, to call us forth, and encourage us to this happy understanding.

O consider with your selves, how much the men of this world are wiser than you
in their generations; you are commonly but the beaters of the bush for the
mighty Nimrods of the world: what have Ministers got, yea what almost have you
not lost (which wise men would have preserved) of credit, honor, comfort, or
encouragement; while they helped to pull down the Sion of this Church? whose
dust has fallen into their own eyes, and besmeared their garments to a most
uncomely deformity; Will you all leave this Sion thus in her dust, without any
pity of her? is it better she should be ever desolated, than your animosities
laid aside, Mortales c^m sumus immortalis non esse debent odia. Tantaene animis
Coelestibus irae?
and your poor feuds reconciled? Such everlasting burnings become not mortal
breasts; least of all heavenly hearts, such as Ministers should have: Plead no
longer such a zeal for Christ, as over-layes charity and humility; or such a
desire for Reformation, which produces so great deformities; It is not so much
a charity, as a justice for us Ministers to advise, to weep, to pray for the
peace of our Jerusalem; Jer. 23.15.
for from the Prophets in great part evil is gone out into all the land; our
cold or our hot fits, our luke-warmnesse, or our negligence, or our
timerousnesse, have cast this Church and many poor souls into this lingering
distemper; this almost incurable Quartane, which will never be cured, till we
smell the Rose of Sharon; the sweet and celestial temperament of Christ's
fragrancies; in all love and charity; in humility, meekness, kindness,
forbearance, pity, and tenderness to each other.

Not only all policy and honest prudence then, as to the recovery of Ministers
credit and reputation, but all conscience and piety, as to the requisi es of
Gods glory, and charity, as to the dangers and necessities of peoples souls,
require now, such double diligence of us, all, as may compensate any former
failings, and show the world how necessary a good, worthy Ministers are; who
every way fit those places, and fill those orbs, in which God and the Church
have set them: It is high time for us to get beyond all cold formalities,
superficial solemnities, popular complyings, covetous projects, secular
ambitions; Penurious pains, slacker care, and indiligent tendance, will not be
sufficient to cure those diseases, we have now to contend withal; which are
ingenious to avoid all cure, subtle to elude all skill, cunning to increase
their maladies, cruel to spend their infection, and fierce to destroy their
Physicians. Moderate and indifferent industry will hardly at any time convert
sinners, and save souls; They are now like harder metals, which melt not but
in such a degree of heat; Least of all now, when error is adored for truth,
sin and damnation it self are dressed up, and esteemed as a way to salvation:
when hell it self is by some courted for heaven; and chains of darkness counted
liberty (like those Succubas and Empusas, Philostratus in vita Apollon.
T^yanaei.
which some men are reported to have espoused and embraced for beautiful
wives.)

There needs, now, besides preaching gifts, and oratorious breath, that vigor
of grace; that spirit of zeal; that fervency of charity; that humble constancy;
that magnanimous meekness, which may make us Ministers unwearied in our
studies, frequent and fervent in praying, often in fasting, attentively watching,
tenderly weeping, charitably visiting, solidly instructing, and diligently
examining, etc. In all wife and meek condescendings, even to bear with men's
infirmities; to frustrate their passions; to receive their bullets and shot as
upon Wool-sacks; to overcome their oppositions by something of a softer
yielding: still beseeching them and entreating them, to be reconciled to God in
Jesus Christ, when they are to us irreconcilable. All obstructions of private
peevishness, passion, hard speeches, haughty carriage, rough demeanor; all
fashion of disdains, revenge, and secular contestations, must be removed as
uncomely, uncomfortable, noxious: That people may see the blood of Christ
softning us; and the bowels of Christ enlarging us, as brethren, as fathers, or
mothers, as tender and careful Nurses in Christ's family.

It is ever, and now most of all unseasonable (in so short and uncertain a
moment, which is allowed us to preach, or people to hear, to learn, and to live
in order to eternity.) to exercise Christians in continual disputes; to lead
them in perplexed paths, full of briars and thorns; to wast their and our
time in modern impertinencies; which will not profit a poor sinner, either
living or dying. All times and pains is lost, which is not laid out in
Cathechising, Preaching, and applying sound, wholesome, healing, saving,
necessary truths; which really mend both mind and manners: either laying the
foundations in principles, or maintaining them in doctrines, or building
proportionably upon them in practicks and comforts: where the truths of faith
bear up the practice of an holy life; and an holy life adornes the Articles of
true faith; where the Creed and the Decalogue go together: That besides the
shows of leaves in doctrines and opinions; there may appear goodly fruits of
purity, justice, mercy, charity, patience, peaceablenesse, civil obedience,
self-denial, which are grown so much out of fashion.

Alas! while poor people are a mused with novelties, (as Larks with dasing
glasses): or picking up curiosities; or gazing at sublimities; or dubious in
uncertainties; or entangled with subtilties; as Deer in acorn time, they forget
their food, grow lean and fall into diverse snares and temptations; into many
lusts and passions; yea into the grave and pit of destruction, whence there is
no redemption. Many (as leaves from trees in Autumn) every day drop away:
(...). Hom.
and dye in their mazes and labyrinths of Religion, by wearying themselves; in
which they advance no more than birds in a cage, and blind horses in a mill:
whereas a true Christian should every day grieve to see himself nothing
advanced in true holiness, or solid knowledge: with grand steps he should be
daily going onward and upward, with ample progresses and mighty increases, of
sound knowledge, indisputable verities, unquestionable practices, of ly duties
and heavenly conversation: (these are the steps by which holy men and women
have ascended to heaven, and conquered the difficulties of salvation) That thus
all the world might bless themselves to see the happy improvements of true
Christians beyond other men; and the inestimable blessing of true and excellent
Ministers pains among the filliest and worst of men in the dissolutest and
worst of times.

O let not us then of the Ministry stand still, and look on our own, and the
Churches miseries (as the Lepers, or mothers did in sieges) till their children
and themselves grew black with famine: You that pretend to stand before the
Lord of the whole world, and the King of his Church; you that bear the name of
the most compassionate Redeemer, who shed his blood for his Church, and laid
down his life for his sheep; Do you never hear in the sounding of your own
bowels the tears, sighs, and fears, of infinite good Christians; nor the voice
of this English Sion, lamenting and expecting pity, at least from Ministers? Is
it worth thus much misery to root up Episcopacy, to set up Presbytery, and to
undermine both with Independency? All which might be fairly composed into a
threefold cord of holy agreement: such as was in primitive times, between
Bishops, Presbyters, and people; whose passions have now ravelled out peace by
sad divisions, and weakened Religion by uncharitable contentions: Though
Parliaments, and Assemblies, and Armies, and people, should be miserable
comforters, passing by without regard and remorse; yea though some be stripping
the wounded, and robbing this desolated Church; yet do not you forsake her,
now she is smitten of God, Lamen. 1.12.
and despised of men: Is it nothing to you (O you that are more politicians,
than Preachers) that pass by? Stand and see, if there be any sorrows like the
sorrows of this reformed Church of England, wherewith the Lord has afflicted
her in the day of his fierce anger; It concerns no men more than Ministers to
succor her, which has received these wounds most-what in the house and by the
hands of her friends; O give the Lord no rest, until he has returned to this
Church in mercy; if you can by counsels and prayers reform nothing in the
public, yet let nothing be unreformed in your private; if you must be laid
aside, as to the peculiar office of Ministers, yet you may mourn and pray the
more in secret; That the Lord would breath upon us, with a Spirit of Truth and
Peace; of love and holy union; of order and humility; whereby none having any
pride or ambition to govern, every one may be humbly disposed to be governed:
For the great crisis of all Ministers distempers is in this; (not what Truths
we shall believe; what doctrine we shall preach; what holiness we shall act;
but) who shall govern? whether Bishops, or Presbyters, or people? yea the Keys
of some men's pretended power hangs so at the peoples girdle, that it is too
near the apron-strings even of mechanics, and silly women.

When a right temper of Christian humility and love shall be restored to every
part, then will the spirits of Religion be recovered, and aptly diffused into
every member of this Church; which blessed temperament, as Christian Churches
enjoyed in their primitive, and florid strength; nor is it less necessary now,
in their more aged, and so decayed, constitution; O let not after ages say, the
Ministers of England were more butchers, then Surgeons: That they were
Physicians of no value; neither curing themselves, nor others; If any of us
have (not by malice so much as mistake) given stronger physic, and more
grains of violent drugs, than the constitution of this or any well reformed
Church can well bear, let us not be less forward, to apply such cordials,
lenitives, antidotes, and restoratives, of love, moderation, concession, and
equanimous wisdom, as may recollect the dissipated and reinforce the wasted
spirits, which yet remain in this reformed Church, and the Ministry of it; On
which the enemies round about do already look with the greedy eyes of ravens
and vultures, expecting when its languishing spirits shall be quite exhausted,
and its fainting eyes quite closed; that so they may draw away the pillow, and
remaining supports, of civil protection from under its head; and violently
force it to give up the ghost: that the reformed Religion, and Ministry of this
Church may be at length quite cast out, and buried with the burial of an Ass;
that neither the place of reformed Bishops, nor reformed Presbyters, nor
reformed people, may know them any more in these British Islands.

In the last place therefore, 13. Humble address to those in power in the
behalf of Ministers.
I humbly crave leave to remind those that act in highest places and power, who
are thought no slight or shallow Statesmen; That, if neither piety to God, nor
conscience of their duty, while they undertake to govern, nor charity to men's
souls both in present and after ages, nor zeal for the reformed Religion, move
them as Christians; nor yet justice and common equity, to the encouragement and
preservation of so many learned and godly men, the lawful Ministers of this
Church in their legal rights, and liberties; nor yet common pity, and charity
to relieve so many pious men, and their families: If (I say) none of these
should sway them, as men, or Christians, (the least of which should, and I hope
greatly will) Yet worldy policy and right reason of State seems to advise the
preservation and establishment of the (so much shaken) reformed Religion here
in England, which has still deep root and impressions in the minds and
affections of the most, and best people in this Nation: Nor can this be done by
more idoneous means, than by giving public favor, encouragement, and
establishment to the true and ancient Ministry, as to its main support; and to
godly Ministers as its head-most Professors.

If it be not absolutely necessary; yet sure it is very convenient, in order to
the quiet and satisfaction of men's minds, (who generally think themselves most
concerned in matters of Religion) either to confirm and restore to its pristine
honor, order, and stability, the ancient Ministry of the Church of England,
(which I have proved to be the only true succession of divine authority) or
else wholly to remove it; and to set Religion upon some other basis: For
neither the reformed Religion, nor its Ministry, can either long, or safely, or
comfortably stand in so tottering and mouldering a posture; like the walls of
some great old fabric, or ruinous Cathedral, swelling out, and threatening to
fall. It were better to take it down, than to hazard its dangerous breakings,
and precipitious tumblings; Scratches in Religion do soon fester, and easily
turn to Gangrenes, which must either be speedily healed, or discreetly cut off.

It were high proesumption for one to advise, who professes his ignorance, in
State Policies: yet common prudence shows, this to be the high way, and most
compendious pass to public peace. Namely, 1. The settling of the reformed
Religion in this Church of England, and its public Ministry, in comely
government, competent maintenance, and holy succession. 2. The confirming, and
if need be, explaining, or enlarging the Articles of the Church of England, in
the main fundamentals of Religion, as Christian and reformed, both in things to
be believed, and practiced. 3. The restoring of that holy power and ancient
exercise of Discipline to the Church, both in privater Congregations, and in
public associations: which may both carry on true knowledge, piety, and
charity in Ministers and people: Also recover the sacred Ordinances of Christ,
and public duties of Religion to their primitive purity and dignity; which
have been infinitely abased by Laymens policies, Ministers negligences, and
vulgar insolences; These would keep a fair course and form of Christian peace
and holiness in the public, a midst lesser differences; and no less
satisfy, than oblige every sober minded Christian; whose good examples have
great influence on the generality of people.

But if the vulgar rudeness, deformity, and inconsistency, be once taught, (by
being tolerated) to slight, and scorn their Ministers, and in them all holy
things, and true Religion; Either beleiving (as they are prone to do) that
their Ministers are not invested by any due and divine authority in that Office
and Ministry, any more than themselves are; nor are assisted by any special
grace and blessing from God; if they suspect that civil Powers do set Divines
at naught, and regard them no more, than as so many pretenders, (...); Naz.
Celeusio judici. None can make conscience of humane laws, who disregards divine.
falsaries, and intruders: How willingly will the minds of common people,
(whom nothing but Conscience, or the Sword keeps in aw and order) embrace any
thing that makes toward laxation of duty to God, and observance to men? No
water is more easily diffused, or more naturally strives, by its fluid nature
to overbear, what ever bounds pen it up, or restrain it from wasting it self.
Nor are such tempers slack, (where occasion tempts them) to revenge by their
riots, all former restraints cast upon them, by any men, that sought to set
limits, either of power, or piety to their lusts and passions.

To avoid which rude and irreligious extravagancies of common people, 14.

unviolable in their public officiatings; generally esteemed, as sacred, both
for the protection they had from men, and the institution from divine power and
wisdom; Which policy was not more wisely carried in all false and feigned
religions, than justly and most conscientiously to be observed, as it ever has
been by all worthy and noble minded Christians, (either Princes or States) in
that, which we hold to be, and profess, as the only true, Christian and
reformed Religion: whose Oracles, Doctrines, institutes, offices, authority,
and ministry have their original, not from man, but from the only wise and
true God; who, first sent his Prophets, and servants; after that his Son (the
Lord Jesus Christ) to be not only a fulfiller and establesher, but also a
Preacher of righteousness to mankind; whose preaching, Prophetic, or
Ministerial office, (as to extern and visible administrations) the holy order
and due succession of Ministers do supply; and in the same power succeed by
his special mission and appointment in the Church.

Whose most sacred Mysteries, for infinite wisdom; for inestimable mercy; for
unparalleld love; for holy precepts; for divine examples; for precious
promises; for ancient and undoubted Prophesies; for exact fulfillings; for apt
institutions; for suitable Ministry; for beautiful order; for blessed comfort;
for sweet peace, and mutual charity (which are, or ought to be) among the true
professors of it, infinitely exceeds all the wisdom, designs, desires, and
thoughts of all those, that ever pretended to any Philosophy, Religion, virtue,
sanctity, or felicity. All which come far short, as of the inward comfort of
men's consciences, so of that outward beauty, peace, and order, which do most
bless humane societies; which bonds of public tranquillity, all true and
unpragmatick Ministers of the Gospel of peace, do most effectually lay (in
Christ's Name) upon men; In which regard, of all ranks of men and orders, they
deserve best of mankind, where ever they live; while they keep within those
Evangelicall bounds, that holy and humble temper, which becones them; and which
is proper to the Spirit of the Gospel. Constantine the Great writes: Eusebius
Eccl. hist. l. 10. c. 5.
The greatest safety or danger to any State comes by Religion; if the reverence
of it be weakened and honor abated, dangers attend: if by Laws and authority
it be settled and preserved, great blessings follow, etc. So that no men seem
more to fight against their own peace, than those that suffer the ancient
Ministry and true Ministers of Christ to be destroyed, or disregarded in any
Christian Nation; which will be interpreted a fighting against God, and an
opposing Christ Jesus; who as he is the only true rock, on which the Church is
to be built, as to internal comfort, and eternal happiness; so he has
regulated it as to external order, beauty, and harmony; and this not by every
unskilful hand, that has a mind to be mudling; but by such, as he has
appointed to be tried, approved, and rightly ordained to the work of edifying
the Church in truth and love: Vicisti Galilae, vicisti. Julian dying cries. 1
Pet. 2.6.8.
This Galilean must overcome: Christ will no doubt prove as a stumbling stone;
so a rock of ruin and offense, to all those that dash against him, in this
Ordinance of his holy Ministry; which, though it seem small, and contemptible
to those, that think themselves Grandees, (in power, and policy) yet as it was
not cut out by humane hands, so it will be a very burdensome stone to all, that
think to lift it out of the way, and lay it aside, from being an holy function,
and divine institution.

15. The Ministers of Christ not safely to be injured.
I think therefore (under favor) that it will be not the least point of wisdom,
and policy, in those who by exercising magistratick power stand most
accountable to God and man, for the support of the Ministry; to harken to, and
follow that grave counsel; Act. 5.35. Greg. Naz. tells us that Saint Basil the
Great was in so great reverence in the Church; (...). They could not be friends
with God who were at enmity with Basil. orat. 16.
Take heed what you do to these men, who are the rrue Ministers of Jesus
Christ, the messengers of the most high God, who preach to you the way of
salvation. For if their function, mission, and Ministry be from Christ, (which
I have proved, and those can hardly doubt, who are so much enlightened by
Scripture, as some are, who may yet be blinded by secular interests) it shall
prevail, though it be in the way of being persecuted: Humane malice may a while
oppose; but it shall not quite blow out, quench or smother those burning and
shining lights of the Church: Which it would do with no less detriment to the
Church, and State; than if it should extinguish the flame, light, and luster of
the Sun in the Firmament; Vide Jer. 33.20. which Prophecy is clear for a
constant and immutable Ministry in the Church of Christ.
Nor are those ordinances of heaven, and that Covenant God has made in Nature,
more necessary, or less durable, than are these, of holy Ministrations, and
Evangelicall Ministry, which God has appointed for Christ in the Church; It is
but little, and with far less comfort, that we see, of God in the creature;
than what we see of him in Christ; nor are the beams of the Sun so glorious, or
necessary, Mal. 4. Romans 10.18.
as these of the Sun of righteousness, which are diffused by his Ministers;
which are as his wings, by which he has moved into all parts of the earth, and
his voice has been heard to the ends of the world.

And truly the most judicious Christians, who are able to discern the day of
Gods visitation, Gildas de excid. Brit. de plores the sacrilegious injuries and
neglect of holy men and holy duties before those miseries.
do look upon this shaking and battery made by some men, against the public
office, and authority of the Ministry of this reformed Church of England, to be
nothing else, but the effects of those counsels and plots, which are always
contriving by the powers of darkness, and the gates of hell, against God, and
Christ, against the Orthodox Faith, and purest Churches; And however they shall
never prevail to destroy the true Christian reformed Religion, in all places;
yet they may occasion its ebbing, and receding from a negligent, wanton, and
ungrateful people, who love Apostasies, Isai. 1.5.
and increase backslidings; as many in England seem to do: It may provoke
the Lord to transplant the Gospel to some other Nation, which shall bring
forth better fruits; and leave our houses desolate, who brought forth such
sour grapes, as these are, wherewith, after so many hundred years, Decr. 32.6.
some men now seek to requite the Lord and his faithful Ministers in this
Church; what can indeed be expected, but some fatal Apostasy, either to
gross superstition, or Atheistical liberty, or heathenish barbarity? which is
nigh at hand, and even at the door; when once the divine honor, and succession
of the Evangelicall Ministry is outed, and overthrown; for what else can
follow, when people shall either have no true Ministers; or be taught to
believe that they need not any; and have no more cause to regard them that are
such by profession, than so many Mountebanks; whom no man is bound in reason,
honor, conscience, or civility to hear, obey, maintain, or reverence, as
having no higher mandate, mission, or authority, than from their own minds, or
peoples humors?

To prevent which direful sin, shame, and mischief; to give some stay to the
fears, and life to the hopes of thousands, besides (and better then) my self,
I have taken this boldness upon me (by Gods direction and assistance, (as I
trust) though unknown, and not much considerable to the many excellent
Christians, 16. The preservation of the honor of the Ministry most worthy of
all excellent Christians.
which are yet in this Church, and least of all to those in power, whom the
matter most concerns) with all due respects, all Christian charity, and
humility to present to the public view of all those (whom this subject of the
Ministry and reformed Religion does concern) these most sad and serious
thoughts of my heart, which are not bufied about Prophetic obscurities, or
Apocalyptick uncertainties; which may please melancholy fancies, and abuse
curious readers: but about a matter most clear, from Scripture; most necessary,
to the being of any true Church in this world; to the comfort of every true
Christian; to the succession of Religion in after ages. None of which can be
kept in any way of Gods revealed will, and ordinary providence, but only by a
right and authoritative Ministry; which carries a relation and bond of
conscience with it, between Minister, and people; which cannot be had, unless
we still keep to the pattern, which Christ has set us, and the Church of
Christ in all ages followed; without any falsity; though not wholly without
some infirmity.

Nor is there any thing, wherein men of the highest power and excellency can
show themselves more worthy of the name of Christians, than in their
endeavoring effectually to restore, and establish the due authority and
succession of the Ministry; by being patrons, incouragers, and protectors of
all able, and peaceable Ministers and their calling: Whose honor is Gods, and
will redound to theirs, whom God shall so far bless, as to make them
instruments of so noble, and most Christian a work; But they had need to be
Herculesses, men of most divine virtue, and resolution, that encounter the many
headed hydras, and various monsters, which are at present set against the
Ministry of this Church.

What ever censures any other actions of men may ly under (which God will
judge) and of which they may have more cause at last to repent, than to boast)
yet this (the vindicating and establishing of the true Ministry and its
authority) they shall have of all things the least cause to repent of. Nor (I
hope) will any worthy men give me (or any other Minister) cause to repent, that
I have presumed to become an humble suites, and a faithful Monitor, in a
matter of so great and so religious concernment; yea, peradventure I may find
favor, (which God can only give in the eyes of men) as Abigail did in David's;
1 Samuel 25.33^
who blessed God for her seasonable diverting of him from that excess of
vengeance, to which immoderate passion had tempted him; It is not safe to treat
those as enemies, which are Gods friends, and friends to men's souls; It was an
action only fit for Saul, (whom God had forsaken) to destroy the Priests of
the Lord, 1 Samuel 18.
as enemies and traitors. If any consecrated vessels of the Temple should have
soil, or decays on them, yet none but Nebuchadnezzars, Belshazzars, or
Antiochusses would quite break them in pieces, or melt them, and profane them;
No time can be too long, no counsel too deliberate, before Christians put so
severe a purpose in execution, or gratify any party without hearing all sides;
Nor should they, that disadvise from it upon sober, and good grounds, be less
acceptable to men in power; than any of those, that prompt and incite to so
hardy and hazardous an adventure.

This gives me some hope if not of acceptance, yet at least of pardon, for
either that prolixity (for which none can do greater penance than I have) or
for that plainness, by which I may exercise any man's patience, who vouchsafes
to read this my Apologetick defense: 17. The Authors excuse for the prolixity
of this Apologetick defense.
wherein I have not forgot, that, as it is written in a busy and pragmatick
age, so possibly it may fall into the hands of some persons, whose employments
admit of little leisure, for such long discourses, or tedious addresses: But,
as others in reading may be prone too much to remember their momentaries; so I
in writing have chiefly considered my own, and others eternities. I have
weighed with my self, how important a business God had laid in this upon my
heart; and my heart upon my hand; The vehemence and just zeal for which, has
still dictated to my pen both this spur and excuse; That in a Cause of so
great consequence, it were not only a sin for me to say nothing, but to say
little; lest shortness of speech should detract from the worth of the matter;
Weak shadows would argue faint flames; either a dimnesse in that light, or a
chillness in that heat, which ought to attend a business, which (to my
judgment) seems of infinite importance to present, and future times; So
precious a Jewel, as the true Ministry of the glorious Gospel of Jesus
Christ, was not to be set with an unhandsome foil, or by a slight and
perfunctory hand. I know small fires and short puffes, will not serve to make
great irons malleable; No Devil is harder to be unmufled and detected, than
that which conceals it self under Angelick masks, which some weak and credulous
souls think a sin, to lift up, or to suspect. 2 Cor. 2.11.
But we are not ignorant of Satan's devises; No dross, or mass of corruption
is more untamable, and unseparable from man's nature than that of sacrilegious
enmity against Christ, the Gospel, and the Ministry while they have any thing
to lose.

I am sure, what ever we or our posterity of this Nation may want, we cannot
want Christ, or the true light of the Gospel, in its power and authority,
without being a most unhappy Nation; To which, if the preservation of a
learned, godly, and authoritative Ministry in a due ordination and divine
succession, (such as was of late and still is, (though much wasted and weakened
in England) be not thought necessary; truly no more will the Scriptures, nor
the Sacraments, nor the peace of Conscience, nor the pardon of sin, nor the
saving of souls ere long be thought necessary; No nor the excellency of the
knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ; whose Name and Worship will shortly be,
either shamefully abused; scurrilously despised; (as now it is by many) yea and
clean forgotten, by the profane, stupid, sensual, and Atheistical hearts of
men; unless there be some men, whose special calling and commission, from God
and man, shall both enable and ordain them to preach and administer holy things
in Christ's Name; whose duty and conscience so commands them to serve God and
his Church, that they cannot be silent, or negligent without sin.

18. Men's pronenesse to Apostasy without a true Ministry.
To expect that arbitrary, and occasional Preachers will do the work of
Christ, and the Church; is as vain, at to think, that passengers or travelers
will build, and plant, and sow, and fight for men in their civil occasions;
The men of this world, will find many other employments of greater honor,
credit and content, than to preach the Gospel, with the cross of poverty, and
contempt upon them; (which is ever crucifying the world, and must expect to be
crucified by the world;) It Is rare to find any generation of men that are
truly favorers of Ministers, or the Gospel; therefore they are ever grudging
at all cost laid out on Christ's account, as lost and going beside their Mill,
who had rather be savers, than saved by him; Nor is the opinion, which sober
men generally retain of the excellency and necessity of Christian Religion, in
order to their salvation, sufficient to keep it up to a constancy and
succession, without a true powerful and authoritative Ministry: For we see
that, although nothing concern^ men more, than to believe there is a God, (the
supreme good) of whose goodness, bounty, power, and protection we have every
moment need, use and experience; and upon whose mercy our sinful mortality can
(only) with any reason depend, both living and dying for our eternal welfare;
yet many (yea most of men) are ready to run out to Atheism, To Atheism.
and to live without God in the world, unless they have frequent and solemn
remembrances, (besides their own hearts) to put them in mind in their
dependence on, and duty to God; In like manner, although nothing should be more
welcome to mankind, (because nothing more necessary) than the news of a
Savior for sinners; To Unbeleif.
yet the bitter root of unbeleif, and many sensual distractions, which are in
men's hearts and lives, are prone to entertain nothing with less liking, than
the hearing and obeying of this holy Gospel; though applied to them in the
best and winningest matter, that humane abilities can attain: Nature and
Reason teach there is a God, and no miracle was ever wrought to convert
Atheists; but the mystery of Salvation by Jesus Christ crucified is by no light
of nature or reason attainable; and needed both miracles at the first planting,
and a constant Ministry for the continuing of it in the world.

If then men be naturally so much aliens from the life of God, and so much
enemies to the cross of Christ; it is not like they will ever be so good
natured, as seriously to undertake the constant task, care, and toil of
preaching to others; especially, when they have no call to it, but their own,
or others pleasure; no conscience of it, as a divine Office, and duty; no
promise, or hope of divine assistance, or blessing in it; no thanks for it, or
benefit by it, either from God or man: Alas, these warm fits and gleames of
novelty, curiosity, popularity, pride, wantonness, self-opinion, and
self-seeking; (which seem to be in some men, who count themselves gifted,
prophetic, specially called, The valor of cowards, and the virtues of
hypocrites are in the eyes of their Spectators.
and inspired) these will soon damp to coldness and deadness, when once
either their design, which is bad; or their weakness, which is great; or their
folly, which is gross, shall be 2. Tim. 3.9.
manifest to themselves, and to others, as it is already to very many, good
Christians; who find, that all the frolic and activity of those men, is but
helping forward the pragmatick policies of those, who study to ruin this, and
all reformed Churches; For if once true and able Ministers be cried down, cast
out, and cut off as to right succession; the true Religion, as Christian, and
reformed too, cannot (without a miracle) continue, but must needs be overrunne
with brutish ignorance, damnable errors, and barbarous manners; which are
already prevailed much in many places, partly for want of able Ministers, and
partly by the peoples supine neglect of public duties, and despising their
true Ministers, under pretense of engraffing to new bodies, and adhering to new
gifted Teachers and Conventicles; which we find breed up few or none in
knowledge, or piety; but only transplant proficients out of other men's
labors, and nurseries: the mean time the younger sort generally run out to
ignorance, and the elder to what liberties they most affect; for want of that
settled Ministry, order, and government, which ought in Religion, and reason of
State to be both established and encouraged.

For my own particular, 19. The Authors integrity.
I have obtained all I designed by this defense, if I may but put all excellent
Christians, and those chiefly (whom it most concerns) in mind of that, which I
think they cannot forget, or neglect without great imprudence, as well as sin:
nor will any man be excuseable, who does not with his best endeavors promote
it. No private ends, or sinister passion of envy, covetousness, or ambition;
no fear, or contempt of any m^n, has any ingrediency in this piece, Animi
directa simplicitas satis se ipsa commendat. Amb.
(however, in other things, no man is more prone to discover how weak and
sinful a creature he is, without Gods grace) I have nothing of private
interest, for profit, or honor, to crave, or expect from great or good men;
Indeed they have little or nothing left to tempt men with: I have more then I
can merit, or well account for; yea I have enough; through the bounty of God,
Satis habeo si res meae nec mihi pudori, nec cuiquaum on^ri f^rent. Hortalus
apud Tacit. An. 4.
and the blessing of one (to me) Inestimable Jewel: whose virtuous luster both
beautifies and enricheth my life, to an honorable competency, and a most happy
tranquillity, whose every way most over-meriting merits have deserved, as much
as can be, to be consecrated by my pen to an eternity of gratitude and honor.

I have seen so more than enough of the worlds vanity, madness, and misery;
that I do not desire any thing more, than to spend the remainder of my life in
a contented privacy to the glory of God, the honor of this Church, and the
welfare of posterity; If I were offered the choice of all wishes, and the
fulfilling of them in this world; I would desire nothing, next that justice
which is the conservatrix of all civil peace and society, but this, That such
as are able, would so far consider the honor of God, and the welfare of the
Church of England; as to become Patrons, and incouragers of good learning, and
the reformed Religion; and to this purpose, that they would establish that holy
Discipline, right order, ancient government, and divine succession of able
Ministers, which ought to be in the Church of Christ.

In reference to the general function, and fraternity of whom, I cannot but
entreat, and offer thus much at least as I have done, which cannot be to any
good man's detriment, or the Publiques injury: For it is not a pleading for a
restitution of those honors, lands, jurisdictions, and dignities, which were
by pious donation, and devout laws appropriated to that profession: I know how
vain and unseasonable a motion it were to crave the restoring of honors, goods,
and estates of those who are now almost reduced to petition for their liberties
and lives. (It is nobler (since God will have it so) for Clergy men to want
those blessings with content, than to enjoy them with so much envy and anger;
as in this age seems inseparable from Bishops and Ministers in any worldly
prosperity) Nor is it a challenging of those immunities, Primum Ecclesia Dei
jura, atque immunitares sum habeto. inter Leges Edgari.
and privileges, which the laws Imperial, and National, every where among
Christians indulged to the Clergy; we must learn to think it freedom enough, if
we may have leave but to preach and practice the Gospel of Jesus Christ, which
is our duty and dignity; we must esteem it a great privilege now to be but
exempted from vulgar rivalry and mechanic insolency; which dares not only to
intrude into Ministers Pulpits, but to pull them out by unheard of outrages;
not suffering the Church to be their Sanctuary. We claim not exemption from
civil Magistrates Court-censures, and jurisdictions, (as was of old in many
cases) our aim is so to do all things, as shall fear no men to be spectators;
nor our enemies to be our judges: Nor can we have so full and desirable a
revenge on our enemies, as to do well; who are never more sorry, than to see
any true Minister live unblameably and commendably. We dare not crave to be
eased of public taxes, either in whole, or in part; Notwithstanding (for the
most part) our charges are great, our livings small, and but for life; yea and
but the wages for our war and work; (while we serve in a better Militia:) It
matters not what our secular burdens be, so as we may make the Gospel any way
less burdensome, or more welcome to our hearears: We urge not that common
liberty which we have; and our joint interest in the public civil welfare,
as men; while yet we are made incapable, and the only men of any calling that
are excluded from all public votes, counsels, or influence; when yet any
trade may invade our calling, and usurp our Ministry: It is well, if we may be
suffered to be of Gods Counsel; and permitted to acquaint others with it, in
order to their salvation; our ambition is, so to live, that the diminutions,
contempt, and poverty, cast upon the Ministerial order (as to all secular
privileges or interests) may be no disparagement to our function, any more
than it was to Primitive Bishops and Presbyters; who by their constant patience
and humility gave greatest Testimony to the truth of the Gospel: whom their
preaching moved not, their patience did. Yet, Quos praedicatio non potuit,
illos vicit praedicantium patientia; quos documenta Evangelica non moverunt, de
istis been toleratae injuriae tandem triumpha^unt. Hom. de Eccl. prim. persec.
it will be little to the honor of this Nation, which as yet professes the
Christian Religion, to treat the Ministers of Christ after the rate, that
Diocletian, or Maximinus, or Julian did; or as those primitive persecutors,
either heathens, or heretics; or as the Mahumetans at this day do; under
whom, it is a favor to tolerate any Christian Bishops, or Preachers, or
Professors, among whom, even the remaining Embers of Christianity are almost
raked up, and buried, under the oppressions, poverty and barbarity used against
them and their Ministers. Nothing has a deeper and sharper sense upon my
soul, than when I see, not only the great and heavy distresses, which already
have, and will further fall on many, and most of my betters and brethren; (who
as learned, godly, and ingenuous men, merit something at least of compassion;)
but, chiefly, when, by foresight of future times, I consider, not without grief
and horror, the great decays, if not utter vastations, of the reformed
Religion; and of that true piety, which such has heretofore so flourished in
England) through the want of true, able and authoritative Ministers, all those
inundations of ignorance, error, superstition, and confusion will certainly
flow in, which all good Christians would most deprecate both from God and man;
my own, and other men's serious sense of all which, I shall much grieve to find
either unacceptably, Fructus est laboris and finis operis placere melioribus.
Sym. Ep.
or unsuccessefully expressed in this Apologetick defense; which is humbly
presented to the Christian candor, and submitted to the judgment of all those
excellent Christians, whom it most concerns, and to whom it is directed; the
least of whom I would not willingly offend.

20. Deprecation of offense. Non lauds sed laudanda quae^^.
Beseeching them in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to accept in the spirit
of meekness and love, what I have written (I hope) as becomes a Christian, and
a Minister of the Gospel in this reformed Church of England; Also to cover
with the vail of charity, what ever infirmities may appear, as in a frail and
sinful man; who knowing, that I had chiefly to contest with some men, that are
wise in their own conceit, Prove. 26.4.
thought it a part of wisdom, in its season to answer them, according to their
folly. And when I considered, that these Antiministeriall spirits, if they fear
God, yet they seem little to reverence men, either in the hoary heads of pious
antiquity declaring its judgment in the writings of the Fathers, Canons of
Councels, and histories of the Church; or in the learned judgment of those
excellent Authors of later edition, (who are all against them) It has made me
the more sparing in so clear and confessed a cause, to cite their infinite
Testimonies: My intent being, neither to make this Apology a flag of
ostentation, for great reading: nor yet to crowd up and smother these men,
merely with numbers of names and quotations, (which is very easy) but rather
to breath upon them with the breath of life, and to convince them with
Scripture, and right reason; which may serve to meet with any in the ordinary
rodes of rigid Separatists, Papists, and Socinians; as for Seekers,
Enthusiasts, Seraphicks, and Ranters, they commonly fly like Night-ravens and
Scrichowles, so much in obscurities, that I can hardly see them; though I often
hear their ominous voices portending utter darkness, after their evening
fulguratings and flashes: when I meet with any of these, I thought it my duty,
and honor not to give them way; though indeed I know nothing probable to
conquer such obstinate passions, to confute such proud ignorance, or to curb
such wanton liberties, as these unruly spirits pretend to, but only the hand
of God in sickness, poverty, terror, and improsperity: A little winter of
affliction will easily kill all those vermin of opinions, which are bred in a
summers toleration, through health, plenty, successes, preferments; and which
seize at length the very heads and hearts of men.

If any Christian, through mere simplicity, and honest credulity, have erred;
not daring to take the hundred part of that confidence to maintain Truth, or to
assert worthy Ministers, and the right way of the reformed and Christian
Religion, which others do, to broach, and abet their desperate errors and
calumnies: I hope I have (as my purpose is) offered to those well meaning
Souls, in all plainness, and charity, what may redeem them from those many
false, and erratick fires, which seek to seduce them, from their true
Ministers, whom the light of right reason, and Scripture, and experience will
show them, are as much to be loved, honored and est^emed, as ever any
Ministers of the Gospel were to any Christians in any Church, since the
Apostles time.

If any rude and injurious detractors, being over grown with proud and
presumptuous flesh, instead of healing, rise to insolent humors, and
intolerable inflummations, railing, defaming, decrying, and speaking all manner
of evil falsely against worthy Ministers, and their calling; being resolved,
and having vowed, Act. 23.14.
as the forty men against Saint Paul, quite to destroy them; The corrasives or
burnt alum here and there sprinkled on the plaster of this Apology is
purposely to meet with, and to eat out that proud and dead flesh, which may be
in their corrupted minds and benumbed consciences. The sober Christian must not
think, that every one that makes a sour face or wry mouth, or wincheth at this
Apology, or passes a severe, slight, or scurrilous answer upon it, or its
author, is presently hurt or injured by me, or it, further than he whose bones
are broken, is hurt by one that strives to set them; or he that has ulcerated
sores, is by him that seeks to search and heal them. These men I must needs
offend as to their distemper: I did design it; I ever shall offend them, if I
will defend this Truth; It is my duty, and charity, by displeasing them, to do
them good: Apoplectick diseases are incurable, till sense be restored; some men
are benumbed, and past feeling; I cannot live, or dye in peace, if I should
hold my peace, when I ought to rebuke, and with all authority, Ephesians. 4.19.
(because with Truth and good conscience; in the name of Christ, and of all my
brethren) the intolerable vanity, ignorance, pride, arrogance, and cruelty of
those, who have set up themselves above, and against all those, that are the
ordained, reformed, and faithful Ministers of this, or any other Christian
Church; In whom they list to find nothing but faults, and insufficiencies;
while they boast of their own rare accomplishments; which are no where to be
found, but in their proud swelling words, by which they lie in wait to deceive
the simple and unstable souls.

I could no longer bear their insolent Pamphlets, 2 Pet. 2.18.
their intolerable practices, their uncharitable projects, against the glory of
Christ, and the happiness of this reformed Church, and Nation; It grieved me
to see so may Shipwrackt souls; so many tossed to and fro, who are floating to
the Romish coast; so many overthrown faiths; so many willing and affected
Atheists; so many cavilling Sophisters; so many wasted comforts; so many
scurrilous and ridiculous Saints; so many withered graces; so many seared
consciences; so many sacrilegious Christians; so many causeless triumphings,
of mean persons, over learned, grave, and godly Ministers; I was troubled to
behold so many fears, yet so much silence, so many sighs and sorrows, yet so
much dejection, and oppression of spirits, such over-awings, in those men, whom
it becomes in a spiritual warfare to encounter with beasts and unreasonable
men, as being sure to overcome at last; Therefore (among others) I desire, this
apology may be a monument of my perfect abhorrency and public protestation
against all evil counsels, and violent designs used against this reformed
Church, its Religion, and Ministry: when posterity shall see the sad effects of
some men's agitations. I expect no acceptance from any men further, than I may
do them good: Such as refuse to be healed by this application, probably their
smart will provoke them to petulant replies, which as I cannot expect from any
sober, and serious Christian; so to the wantonness of others, who are woeful
wasters of paper and ink, (...). Plato in Crito.
I shall never have leisure to attend; I have better employment, whereto I
humbly devote the short remnant of my precious moment; even to the service of
Christ, of this Church, and of all those excellent Christians in it; to whose
favor this sudden Apologetick defense is humbly dedicated, in the behalf of
the Ministry of this Church of England, by their humblest servant in the Lord
