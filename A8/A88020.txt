A Letter sent to His MAJESTY: by an Honorable Member of the House of COMMONS.
SIR,
BY necessary Persuasion and inducement on the behalf of my self and the
other your faithful subjects members of your house of Commons accused of high
Treason: I am forced to inform your Majesty of the integrity of our affections
and innocence of our proceeding, in the great affairs of this Common wealth
wherein we have bin employed by your Majesty.

Besides our sorrows (which pressed us very sore and still remains upon us)
the troubles and grief that fell upon us, for the lamentable breaches in
Church and State, and so your sacreed Majesty and hopeful offspring filled up
our sorrows and in our thoughts were grieved that such fears and desolations
fell out in your days, we confess that charity suspects not, and the best
minds think the least hurt, and the freer a man is from vice in himself, the
more charitable he is of others, and this is that which has proved prejudicall
to your Majesty, but had your MAJESTY bin the first that had bin misinformed,
or ill rewarded it would be an hard thing to command patience, but grief is
asweged by presidents or examples. It is true your Majesty being misinformed
against us your faithful servants and subjects, your Majesty thought to have
dealt with us, as Joseph thought to have dealt with Mary, and so put them a way
far from you, but with Mary they travilled as it were with child, and that
which they traviled withal might not appear an illegtinate the only wise God
sent as it were an Angel unto you, to let you see that like Mary they being
contracted unto you in love they have not as yet defiled their marriage bed,
but remain like Mary faithful to their head and Sovereign; And your Majesty
seduced by false oppinions from others against them, we hope you will be now
reduced to them by true persuasions; and that you may be so the only wise God,
that gave your Majesty your being, and so knew you better then your self, has
dealt with your Majesty as he did with Adam in Paradise, provided you a meet
helper, when with Adam you thought we need of it; And if your Majesty yield as
Adam did in sparing a superfluous rib, will become a great gainer, for your
Majesty shall not only loose those who may very well be spared, but you will
gain to your self and posterity a meet helper, that will endeavor by all
means that may be lawful to ease you of the many burdens that lie heavy upon
you, and considering the pains of that body whereof you are the head, great
injustice is done them by accusing them; for by this means your good subjects
are bereaved of those benifits that ought to be common to all: As for your
Commons, they go not about to steal your favor, but purchase them legally,
and are become unto you as Abraham's servant was unto his Mr. who would not
either eat or drink, until he had done his Masters business; And J dare say
if your Commons (as the late menopolits and others did seek themselves or
their own advantages more then the good of King and Kingdom, they would have
bin received after so much labor before now, but we say as Adam and let us be
but one and that it might have bin so we have bin willing to be separated from
our demesticke employments, yea, to forsake all and runn through many hazards
and perilous dangers to cleave only to your Majesty in a so^emne contract,
therefore to make up the contract you must part with your evil Counselors
that are near unto you and spare a part to save the rest, being done it will
prove to your Majesty as comfortable and welcom^ as Rebeckca was in Isaakes
tent. This happy match being made, it would not only refresh your people but
make glad your hearts in these tims of fears and dangers, it is the nighest
way to a blessing, and the hopes of this is that which has brought us to renew
and confirm the Covenant that your Majesty made with us; from your first
entrance to the Crown, and because you could not swear by no greater, swore by
the Eternal God that you would defend us, and at the first of our contract we
made but one, your power and all that you had was ours to defend us; and do us
good; But those now near you and about you have set your Majesty against us,
and persuade you to beat us, and force us to obedience; though of our selves
willing to obey: being fore troubled within our selves, when we see your your
Majesty (who is become our head and husband) strange unto us, but we hope
these unnatural breaches being composed and reconciled love will be united
stronger then before, wherefore be reconciled to your Commons and to us your
faithful and Loyal servants shall live love and dye togather and be more
firm in your new unian then ever divided in your heart unkindnesses so shall
you meet in the end and new Por^ but be like Rachell and Leah which two built
up the house of Israel, we have endeavored to put you in away to unity now
you are in the way keep it, it is said that whylest Abraham servant was in in
the way God blessed him, the same God bless your Majesty and for your comfort
and encouragement know by so much that you grow to perfection by how much you
draw nere to unity we confess had the baules and baulums of our times been so
evil as they would have bine the world had been overcome with evil but such
is the wisdom of God that offtimes he hides from evil men those times and
seasons that might prove prejudicicall to his People, but we have seen and
felt, both great inward sorrow and outward perplexity that by the means of our
baalems your Majesty is become to your People and commons as the Angel are
unto Gideon and so made them afraid, but we humbly and earnestly desire your
Majesty to recomfort your People by returning to the wholesome concell of your
Parliament, and enjoy them again by a willing contract and not by ravishment,
we shall you appeace unto your your People like moses who had more glory by his
veil then by his face and we doubt not but when all things thus be made
manifest, and the integrity and innocence of our proceedings rightly understood
by your Majesty, but that one faithful david will be in more account with your
Majesty then all the Pharasites and Atchittophells of your camp, for our
plain conditions we doubt (...) but the effect of our endeavoures will make it
appear to all the world (to the Conunceing or confusion o^ our malitions
enemies, who are no otherwise to you^ Majesty if they might be onceased) and
satisfaction o^ your M. that we have aimed at nothing but the word of God in
defending his true Religion your Majesty person and posterity from force and
violence, and the fundamental Laws of this Kingdom, and just prerogatives of
the Crown from distraction.

FJNJS.
