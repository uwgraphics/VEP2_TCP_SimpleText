THE MANIFEST Presented to the Parliament in Scotland, in regard of the present
troubles in England; Revel. 16. Psalm. 89.119. Acts. 17. Isay 11.32.
according to the eternal Righteousness of God, the Sovereign Judge. And that
they may take heed of causing a new Desolation of the Poor, by inter-medling
with the judgment of God. Psalm 10.
THere is no other Gospel, Galat. 1. John 1.13.15. Romans 12. Colos. 3. 1 Cor.
12.13.
but that which God has caused to be published by his Servants of old, namely,
That every Member of the body of Christ ought by putting on hearty compassion,
of the love of God, to have a tender fellow-feeling and care of the sufferings
of his neighbor or fellow-Member.

And if every Angel from Heaven should preach Gospel otherwise, Philip. 3. 1
Pet. 1.2 1. Io. 2.3.4. Colos. 2. Ephesians. 4. Zephan. 3. Isay 52.54. Acts 20. Gal.
1.5. Colos. 2. 1 Pet. 1.2. Hos. 4.10.12. Romans 16. Ier. 23.30.
then God has caused it to be taught or preached in former times by his
servants the Apostles, and Prophets; Namely, that the true Believers are so
fitly joined and compacted together, that they ought, and do mutually help or
supply one another, for the increase or improvement of the whole body, as the
universal, temporal, and eternal welfare of the Church of God, or the
Members of the Body of Christ, does require the same; let such a one be
accursed together with his vain, false, and perverted doctrine, outward
Temple-service, or pretended Worship of God. Jeremiah 7.8. Whereby the bond of
the Love of God being untied, there ensue such Divisions still, that there is
none at all does care or trouble himself any more for the trouble and
sufferings of another, or for the affliction of Joseph. Amos 6.

According to this Gospel now, Romans 1.2 Cor. 5.
where the Righteous is not to live only to himself, 1 Pet. 4. Gal. 3 John
8.12. Ephesians. 1.2. Colos. 1. 1 Peter 1. 1 Cor. 1.3.15. 1 Pet. 1.2. Romans 1.9.11.
Isay 48. Matthew. 24. Mark 13. Luke 21. 1 These. 5. Isay 45.49. Ps. 14.73,
97.102. Isay 33.52.59, 60, 61. Psalm. 75.89. Acts 17.
Romans 14. But in the spirit unto God, and especially by, or of his Faith,
Habakuk 2. Hebrews 10. and to walk in the light, whereunto also he is
redeemed, and delivered from the power of darkness, and dearly bought by the
blood of the Son of God. 1 Corinthians 6.7. They in England, Scotland, and
Ireland, which do call themselves Christians, according to the Covenant of the
second or new Testament, and have the Word of God, and would be counted his
people by the same, Titus 1, they should long ago already, by reason of the
great Trouble and Tribulation of Mankind, Daniel 12. have lifted up their
heads, desisted from sins, or works of Darkness, been made free, or become
sober from them. 1 Corinthians 15. And thus have soberly observed or given heed
for the Deliverance of Israel, to the work of the Lord. Psalm 28, Jsay 5. or
the help out of Zion, Romans 11. For which end God timely sent his servant
David, whom he raised in that behalf to judge, Jeremiah 30. to come into the
Land or Kingdom. Revelations 16.

But because they were asleep there, Dan. 12. 1 These. 5. Math. 24. Luke. 18. 1 Timothy 1. Gal. 5. 1 Cor. 12.13. John 13.15. Hezek. 22. 1 John 3. James 3.4. Hebr.
10.12. Amos 5. Jeremiah 30. Isay 47. Revel. 16.17. 1 Pet. 2. Hezek. 13. 2 Timothy
3. Romans 16. 2 Pet. 2. Zach. 10.11.13. 2 Timothy 4. Romans 1. Revel. 20.
Mark 13. and the King of England would at no time take the Kingdom and
Judgment of God, Daniel 2.7. for the deliverance of his Elect, into
consideration, according to the Law and Testimony, Isay 8. or in his own
conscience, so as he and his were bound to do out of a true, unfeigned,
Christian Faith, and through the Love of God, that incorruptable seed, 1 Peter
1. Romans 12.13. Therefore has God also caused the fire in manner foretold, to
be thus kindled upon him and his like, by the Canicall, envious, Titus 3.
self-revengefull and implacable proceedings of the Parliament there, who were
altogether as far from considering the oppressed in Germany, but suffered
those their Fellow Members to sink and perish, Soul and Body under the
Babylonian Yoke or Abomination, and instead thereof went about, even against
God and Christ, only to vindicate or avenge themselves, 1 Corinthians 4. and to
maintain and establish the Hypocrisy and lying of the dis-united, distracted,
1 Timothy 1.6. divided, Hosea 10. Sectarian, and contentious courses of their
Shepherds, Jeremiah 23, and temporal or worldly Teachers, whom they have
raised and heaped upon themselves after the manner of those mischievous, Ier.
7.17.19. Ps. 10.12 94. Zach. 1.10. Habac. 3, Psalm. 12.80. Mich. 2.3, 4. Hezek.
22.34.
yea Divellish Tyrants, Isay 29. Psalm 52.68. Thieves and Murderers in
Germany, Isay 1.9.34. through whose godless, insolent, fierce, and barbarous
deportment, ad was turned afterward to prey and ruin, Nahum 2.3. which must
needs be judged yet, by reason of the Desolation of the poor, and for the
shedding of so much innocent blood by it.

And forasmuch as God will no longer endure hereupon his Earth, that robbing,
and murdering in this false Jerusalem, Zach. 5.9.10. Matthew. 21.24. Rev.
3.16.22. Isay 24.26.41.66.
Mark 11.13. And much less, yet the Hypocrisy of those lukewarm, neither
hot nor cold, false practices and professions, Psalm 9.50.96.98. Whereby men
suffer one another to sink and perish, Zephan. 3. Ier. 30.
especially in matters concerning the Soul and Conscience, on which depends
the universal, temporal, and eternal welfare of Mankind; Revel. 6.12.
so as it has been likewise practiced in England, Hezek. 12.32. Luk 12.17.21.
Mat. 24. Mark 15.
when they have worried and destroyed one another, besides the leaving of their
neighbor destitute and helpless; therefore it behooveth those in Scotland, to
open the inward eyes of Conscience to good purpose, and to look well to it,
what they are about, Nahum 3. Ier. 2.7.22. Romans 12.
or how they are to carry themselves in regard of their present troubles and
warlike Commotions, whereby Satan is let quite loose now, Ephesians. 4. James 3.4.
Hebr. 10, 12. Psalm. 10.94. Mich. 3.
Revel. 20. with rage and fury Psalm 2.76. murder, theft, or robberies and
bloodshed committed on the innocent; and that they do not further emancipate
or subject themselves, 2 Peter 2. to the selfe-revenging, Cainicall, 1 John 3.

16.20.21. to fley, and destroy the poor people and Inhabitants of England.

Soldiers indeed there will be required yet, Joel 3. 2 These. 1. Wisd. 5. Rev.
18.19.22.
to serve God in the execution of his vengeance or jealousy, Isa 9. Judgment
and Righteousness; The Method or proceeding whereof would be this; That such
as will eschew the wrath of God (the King of England, Ro^ (...)
and other his like in Authority) do so order their Government according to
Conscience, in the first place: as the (...)bound by God and Right to do in
the behalf of their own, (...) Subjects, Wisd. 6. Isay 32. and then also, that
they be aiding and assisting their suffering or oppressed neighbor or fellow
members for their deliverance. Gal. 5. 1 Cor. 12.13 Luke 17.18. Isay 24.26.
Daniel 12. 1 These. 5. Mal. 3.4. Mat. 24. 2 Pet. ^. Rev. 16.17.18.
Isay 49.60. Which hitherto, for the unbelief, and Gods contempt of the
spiritually Dead Revel. 12.20, that sleep in sin, were forced to perish soul
and body; for which cause many shall awak, and rise again with everlasting shame
and confusion. For there is no peace at hand in the world yet, Hezek. 13.
neither for those under the great Babell or Babylonian Whore, Isay 47.52 63.
nor for any other unbeleevers, and ungodly Hypocrites, Scoffers and Scorners.
Ep. Jude.

But if so be, the Princes and Judges, Governors or Officers of Scotland will
likewise not observe this present and last time according to the Law and
Testimony of their Conscience, Mich. 5 Wisd. 6. D^^^. 8.11.12. Luke 21. Isay 8
51.59 Ier^m. 30. Hez^k. 22. Isay 45. Amos 5. Zeph. 1.3. Psalm. 33.68. Hosea 10,
Isay 8.
Isay 8. nor look upon the universal, temporal, and eternal welfare of
mankind, in their present confusions, great troubles and calamities, Mark 13.
according to Judgment and Righteousness, the very like may befall them, that
hitherto befell others, whose condition they resemble. For God, who has both
light and darkness in his hand i^ as easily able to kindle the fire among
them also. Having suffered none yet, where he sent me, to prosper in their
purposes, human devises, or consultations, against his everlasting Council.
