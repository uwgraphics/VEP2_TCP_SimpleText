News from York: SENT From a Country Courtier to his honorable friend in
this City.
Noble Cavalier,
YOur Country Courtier kisses your hands for the favor you did him in your
last Epistle, and tells you he is of opinion with the Secretary in my Lord
Newcastles last new play, That the times are dangerous; and therefore shall say
nothing but Mum: Letters have miscarryed, so may mine; therefore I will send
you nothing but tail-paper. Tell the Lincolnshire Roundheads I am theirs to
be confided in: I know they covet news, therefore I pray tell them the King is
here, and so am I, but Mum, no more of that. Several Petitions have been
delivered to my Sovereign, but what they are, you shall not know. The King
hawks much at the Hiern, it is a high flight, but no more of that neither, nor
any thing else at this time, only that I am

Yours, T. K.
April 8.
