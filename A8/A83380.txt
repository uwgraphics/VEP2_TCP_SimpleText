THE PETITION OF The LORDS and COMMONS, PRESENTED To His Majesty By the Earl
of Stamford, Master Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Master Hungerford, April
18. 1642. Together with His Majesty's Answer thereunto.

LONDON: Printed by ROBERT BARKER, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty: And by the Assigns of JOHN BILL. MDCXLII.

To the Kings most Excellent Majesty The humble Petition of the Lords and
Commons assembled in Parliament.
May it please your Majesty,
YOur Majesty's most loyal and faithful Subjects, the Lords and Commons in
Parliament have duly considered the Message received from Your Majesty,
concerning Your purpose of going into Ireland in Your own Person, to prosecute
the war there with the bodies of your English Subjects, leavied, transported,
and maintained at their charge, which You are pleased to propound to us, not as
a matter wherein Your Majesty desires the advice of Your Parliament, but as
already firmly resolved on, and forthwith to be put in execution, by granting
out Commissions for the leavying of two thousand foot, and two hundred horse
for a guard for Your Person when You shall come into that Kingdom: wherein we
cannot choose but with all reverence and humility to Your Majesty, observe that
You have declined Your great Council the Parliament, and varied from the
usual course of Your Royal Predecessors, That a business of so great
importance concerning the peace and safety of all Your Subjects, and wherein
they have a special interest by Your Majesty's promise, and by those great
sums which they have disbursed, and for which they stand engaged, should be
concluded and undertaken without their advice: Whereupon we hold it our duty to
declare, That if at this time Your Majesty shall go into Ireland, You will very
much endanger the safety of Your Royal Person and Kingdoms, and of all other
States professing the Protestant Religion in Christendom, and make way to the
execution of that cruel and bloody Design of the Papists every where to root
out and destroy the reformed Religigion, as the Irish Papists have in a great
part already effected in that Kingdom, and in all likelihood would quickly be
atempted in other places, if the consideration of the strength and union of the
two Nations of England and Scotland did not much hinder and discourage the
execution of any such Design. And that we may manifest to Your Majesty the
danger and misery, which such a journey and enterprise would produce, we
present to Your Majesty the reasons of this our humble opinion and advice.

1 YOur Royal Person will be subject, not only to the casualty of War, but
to secret practices and conspiracies, especially Your Majesty continuing Your
profession to maintain the Protestant Religion in that Kingdom, which the
Papists are generally bound by their vow to extirpate. 2 It will exceedingly
encourage the Rebels, who do generally profess and declare, that Your
Majesty does favor and allow their proceedings, and that this insurrection
was undertaken by the Warrant of Your Commission, and it will make good their
expectation of great advantage by Your Majesty's presence at this time of so
much distraction in this Kingdom, whereby they may hope we shall be disabled to
supply the War there, especially there appearing less necessity of Your
Majesty's Journey at this time, by reason of the manifold successes which God
has given against them. 3. It will much hinder and impair the means whereby
this war is to be supported, and increase the charge of it, and in both these
respects, make it more in supportable to your Subject: and this we can
confidently affirm, because many of the Adventurers, who have already
subscribed, do upon the knowledge of your Majesty's Intention, declare their
resolution, not to pay in their money; and others very willing to have
subscribed, do now profess the contrary. 4. Your Majesty's absence must
necessarily very much interrupt the proceedings of Parliament, and deprive your
Subjects of the benefit of those further Acts of Grace, and Justice, which we
shall humbly expect from your Majesty, for the establishing of a perfect union,
and mutual confidence betwixt Your Majesty and Your People, and procuring and
confirming the prosperity and happiness of both. 5. It will exceedingly
increase the jealousies and fears of your people, and render their doubts more
probable, of some force intended by some evil counsels near Your Majesty, in
opposition of the Parliament, and favor of the malignant party of this
Kingdom. 6. It will bereave your Parliament of that advantage, whereby they
were induced to undertake this war, upon Your Majesty's promise that it should
be managed by their advice; which cannot be done, if Your Majesty contrary to
their counsels shall undertake to order and govern it in Your own Person.
Upon which and diverse other reasons we have resolved, by the full and
concurring agreement of both Houses, that we cannot with discharge of our duty
consent to any Leavyes, or raising of Soldiers to be made by Your Majesty for
this your intended expedition into Ireland, or to the payment of any Army or
Soldiers there, but such as shall be employed and governed according to our
advice and direction; and that if such Leavyes shall be made by any Commission of
Your Majesty (not agreed to by both Houses of Parliament) we shall be forced to
interpret the same to be raised to the terror of Your people, and disturbance
of the public peace, and hold our selves bound, by the Laws of the Kingdom, to
apply the Authority of Parliament to suppress the same.

And we do further most humbly declare, That if Your Majesty shall by ill
counsel be persuaded to go, contrary to this advice of Your Parliament (which
we hope Your Majesty will not) We do not in that case hold our selves bound to
submit to any Commissioners, which Your Majesty shall choose, but do resolve to
preserve and govern the Kingdom by the counsel and advice of Parliament for
Your Majesty and Your Posterity, according to our Allegiance, and the Law of
the Land.

Wherefore we do most humbly pray, and advise Your Majesty, to desist from
this your intended passage into Ireland, and from all preparation of men and
Arms tending thereunto, and to leave the managing of that war to Your
Parliament, according to Your Majesty's promise made unto us, and Your Royal
Commission granted under Your great Seal of England, by advice of both Houses,
in prosecution whereof, by Gods blessing, we have already made a prosperous
entrance by many defeats of the Rebels, whereby they are much weakened and
disheartened, and have no probable means of subsistence, if our proceedings
shall not be interrupted by this interposition of Your Majesty's Journey, but
that we may hope upon good grounds, that within a short time, without Hazard of
Your Majesty's person, and so much dangerous confusion to Your Kingdoms (which
must needs ensue) if you should proceed in this resolution, we shall be enabled
fully to vindicate Your Majesty's right and authority in that Kingdom, and
punish those horrible outrageous cruelties, which have been committed in the
murdering and spoiling so many of your Subjects, and bring that Realm to such
a condition as may be much for the advantage of your Majesty; and this Crown,
the honor of your government, and contentment of your people. For the better,
and more speedy effecting whereof, we do again renew our humble desires of your
return to your Parliament; and that you will please to reject all Counsels and
apprehensions, which may any way derogate from that faithfulness and
Allegiance, which in truth and sincerity we have always born and professed to
Your Majesty, and shall ever make good to the uttermost with our lives and
fortunes.

His Majesty's Answer To a Petition presented to Him at York, April 18. 1642.
by the Earl of Stamford, etc. in the name of both Houses: Concerning His
Message lately sent to them, declaring His Resolution to go into Ireland.
WE are so troubled and astonished to find the unexpected reception, and
misunderstanding of Our Message of the eighth of April, concerning Our Irish
journey, that being so much disappointed of the approbation and thanks We
looked for to that Declaration; We have great cause to doubt, whether it be in
Our power to say or do any thing which shall not fall within the like
interpretation. But as We have in that Message called God to witness the
sincerity of the profession of Our only Ends for the undertaking that Journey:
so We must appeal to all Our good Subjects, and the whole world, whether the
Reasons alleged against that Journey be of weight to satisfy Our
understanding, or the counsel presented to dissuade Us from it, be full of
that duty as is like to prevail over Our affections.

For Our resolving of so great a Business without the Advice of Our
Parliament; We must remember you howoften by Our Messages We made the same
offer, if you should advise Us thereunto: To which you never gave Us the least
answer: But in your late Declaration told Us, That ye were not to be satisfied
with words: so that We had reason to conceive you rather avoided (out of regard
to Our person) to give Us counsel to run that hazard, then that you
disapproved the inclination. And what greater comfort or security can the
Protestants of Christendom receive, then by seeing a Protestant King venture
and engage His Person for the defense of that Profession, and the suppression
of Popery, to which We solemnly protested in that Message, never to grant a
Toleration, upon what pretense soever, or an Abolition of any of the Laws
there in force against the Professors of it. And when We consider the great
calamities, and unheard of cruelties Our poor Protestant Subjects in that
Kingdom have undergone for the space of near, or full six Months, the growth
and increase of the strength of those barbarous Rebels, and the evident
probability of Foreign Supplies, (if they are not speedily suppressed) The
very slow succors hitherto sent them from hence; That the Officers of several
Regiments, who have long since been allowed entertainment from you for that
Service, have not raised any Supply or Succor for that Kingdom: That many
troops of Horse have long lien near Chester untransported; That the Lord
Lieutenant of Ireland, on whom We relied principally for the Conduct and
managing of Affairs there, is still in this Kingdom, notwithstanding Our
earnestness expressed that he should repair to his Command; And when We
consider the many and great scandals raised upon Our Self by report of the
Rebels, and not sufficiently discountenanced here, notwithstanding so many
professions of Ours; And had seen a Book lately printed by the Order of the
House of Commons, Entitled; A Remonstrance of diverse remarkable Passages
concerning the Church and Kingdom of Ireland, Wherein some Examinations are set
down, which (how improbable or impossible soever) may make an impression in the
minds of many of Our weak Subjects; And lastly, When We duly weigh the
dishonor which will perpetually lie upon this Kingdom, if full and speedy
relief be not dispatched thither, We could, nor cannot think of a better way to
discharge Our duty to Almighty God, for the defense of the true Protestant
Profession, or to manifest Our affection to Our three Kingdoms for their
preservation, then by engaging Our Person in this Expedition, as many of Our
Royal Progenitors have done, even in Foreign parts, upon causes of less
Importance and Piety, with great Honor to themselves, and advantage to this
Kingdom: And therefore We expected at least thanks for such Our Inclination.

For the danger to Our Person; We conceive it necessary and worthy of a King to
adventure His life to preserve His Kingdom, neither can it be imagined, that We
will sit still, and suffer Our Kingdoms to be lost, and Our good Protestant
Subjects to be Massacred, without exposing Our own Person to the utmost hazard
for their relief and preservation: Our life, when it was most pleasant, being
nothing so precious to Us, as it is, and shall be to govern and preserve Our
people with Honor and Justice.

For any encouragement to the Rebels, because of the reports they raised, We
cannot conceive that the Rebels are capable of a greater Terror, then by the
presence of their Lawful King in the head of an Army to chastise them:
Besides, it will be an unspeakable advantage to them, if any reports of theirs
could hinder Us from doing any thing which were fit for Us to do, if such
reports were not raised: This would quickly teach them, in this jealous Age, to
prevent by such reports any other persons coming against them, whom they had no
mind should be so employed.

We marvel that the Adventurers, whose advantage was a principal Motive (next
the reason before mentioned) to Us, should so much mistake Our purpose, whose
Interest we conceive must be much improved by the Expedition we hope (by Gods
blessing) to use in this Service: this being the most probable way for the
speedy Conquest of the Rebels: Their Lands are sufficiently secured by Act of
Parliament.

We think not Our self kindly used, That the addition of so few men to your
Leavies (for a Guard to Our Person in Ireland) should be thought fit for your
refusal: and much more, that having used so many Cautions in this Message,
both in the smalnesse of the number: In Our having raised none until your
Answer: In their being to be raised only near their place of Shipping: In
their being there to be Armed, and that, not till they were ready to be
Shipped: In the provision, by the Oaths, that none of them should be Papists
(all Which appears sufficient to destroy all grounds of jealousy of any force
intended by them in opposition to the Parliament, or favor to any malignant
party) any suspicion should notwithstanding be grounded upon it.

Neither can it be understood, That when We recommended the Managing of that
War to you, That We intended to exclude Our self, or not to be concerned in
your counsels, That if We found any expedient (which in Our conscience or
understanding We thought necessary for that great work) We might not put it in
practice. We look upon you as Our great Council, whose advice We always have
and will (with great regard and deliberation) weigh and consider: But We look
upon Our self, as neither deprived of Our understanding, or divested of any
right we had, if there were no Parliament sitting. We called you together by
Our own Writ and Authority (without which you could not have met) to give Us
faithful Counsel about Our great Affairs: But We resigned not up Our own
Interest and Freedom. We never subjected Our self to your absolute
determination. We have always weighed your Counsels, as proceeding from a Body
entrusted by Us: And when we have dissented from you, We have returned you the
Reasons, which have prevailed with our conscience and understanding, with that
Candor as a Prince should use toward His Subjects; and that Affection, which a
father can express to his children. What application has been used to
rectify Our understanding by reasons, or what Motives have been given to
persuade Our Affections, We leave all the world to judge. And then We must tell
you, howsoever a Major part may bind you in matter of Opinion, We hold Our
self (and We are sure the Law, and the Constitution of the Kingdom has always
held the same) as free to dissent (till Our Reason be convinced for the
general Good) as if you delivered no Opinion.

For Our Journey it self, The circumstances of your Petition are such, as We
know not well what answer to return, or whether We were best to give any. That
part which pretends to carry reason with it, does no way satisfy Us: The
other, which is rather reprehension and Menace, then advice, cannot stagger Us.
Our Answer therefore is, That we shall be very glad to find the work of
Ireland so easy as you seem to think it, which did not so appear by any thing
known to Us, when we sent Our Message. And though we will never refuse, or be
unwilling to venture Our person for the good and safety of Our People; We are
not so weary of Our life, as to hazard it impertinently. And therefore since
you seem to have received Advertisements of some late and great Successes in
that Kingdom, We will stay some time to see the event of those, and not pursue
this Resolution, till we have given you a second Notice. But if We find the
miserable Condition of Our poor Subjects of that Kingdom be not speedily
releeved, We will (with Gods assistance) visit them with succors, as Our
particular Credit and Interest can supply Us with, if you refuse to ioyn with
Us. And We doubt not but the Leavies We shall make (in which We will observe
punctually the former, and all other Cautions, as may best prevent all Fears
and Iealousies, and to use no Power but what is Legal) will be so much to the
satisfaction of Our Subjects, as no person will dare presume to resist Our
Commands; and if they should, at their peril. In the mean time We hope Our
forwardness, so remarkable to that service, shall be notorious to all the
world, and that all scandals laid on Us in that Business, shall be clearly
wiped away.

We were so careful that Our Journey into Ireland should not interrupt the
proceedings of Parliament, nor deprive Our Subjects of any Acts of Justice, or
further Acts of Grace, for the real benefit of Our People; That We made a Free
offer of leaving such Power behind, as should not only be necessary for the
Peace and Safety of the Kingdom; but fully provide for the happy Progress of
the Parliament. And therefore We cannot but wonder, since such Power has been
always left here by Commission for the Government of this Kingdom, when Our
Progenitors have been out of the same during the sitting of Parliaments: and
since your selves desired that such a Power might be left here by Us, at Our
last going into Scotland, what Law of the Land have you now found to dispense
with you, from submitting to such Authority Legally derived from Us in Our
absence, and to enable you to Govern this Kingdom by your own mere Authority?

For Our return toward London, We have given you so full an Answer in Our late
Declaration, and in Answer to your Petition presented to Us at York the 26 of
March last, that We know not what to add, if you will not provide for Our
Security with you, nor agree to remove to another Place, where there may not be
the same Danger to Us. We expected that (since We have been so particular in
the Causes and Grounds of Our Fears) you should have sent Us word, that you had
published such Declarations against future Tumults, and unlawful Assemblies,
and taken such Courses for the Suppressing of Seditious Sermons and Pamphlets,
that Our Fears of that kind might be laid aside, before you should press Our
return.

To Conclude, We could wish that you would (with the same strictness and
severity) weigh and examine your Messages and Expressions to Us, as you do
those you receive from Us: For We are very confident, that if you examine Our
Rights and Privileges, by what Our Predecessors have enjoyed; and your own
addresses, by the usual Courses of your Ancestors; ye will find many
Expressions in this Petition, warranted only by your own Authority, which
indeed We forbear to take notice of, or to give Answer to, lest We should be
tempted (in a just indignation) to express a greater Passion, then We are yet
willing to put on. God in his good time (We hope) will so inform the hearts of
all Our Subjects, that We shall recover from the mischief and danger of this
Distemper; On whose good pleasure We will wait with all patience and humility.

FINIS.
