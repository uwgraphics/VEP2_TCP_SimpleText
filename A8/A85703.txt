THIS IS A TRUE COPY OF A LETTER, THAT PRINCE GRIFFITH Lately writ to the LORD
WINDSOR; Wherein the Passages that happened betwixt them in FLAUNDERS are
truly Related.
My Lord WINDSOR,
I Received a Letter lately from you, wherein you are pleased to commend the
goodness of my horse which to your own knowledge was a stumbler, hardmouth'd, and
unmannaged, or else you had bought him of my Second, Colonel Apsley, as you
were a running out of Flaunders: Indeed my Lord I can compare him to nothing
more like, then to your Lordship, especially when you are powdered; for the
Horse was indifferent handsome, although unproper for the use I put him to, so
indeed I hear that your Lordship now and then, makes a pritry show before
Ladies, although you are as unproper for their service, as my Horse was to
fight upon, for certainly you have not the impudence to deny, That your Privy
Members, are most commonly supported with a Truss, that you are scarceable (at
any time) for to afford a Lady a Bout: And for your Courage I am resolved also
to unmaske it, although you imagined to support your reputation by hastuing
into England (whither you knew I could not come for the present) and there, as
it seems, cried up your self, for a Gallant Stout Man, when God and your own
conscience can tell you, that there lives not a more Treacherous, nor a more
Lying Cowardly Villain on the face of the Earth, then you are.

This, Windsor, is the true Caracter of you, and no more then what I John
Griffith will just sie to your teeth, whenever, you shall dare to quest on
it; which happy hour, I extremely long for, because I am confident that I
shall clearly make in appear to all the World, that you deserve rather the
Title of a Treacherous Coward, then to be esteemed a Person of a real courage,
or else you could not be so unworthy, as to leave the Field, as you did,
without drawing of blood, when you saw your Second (who was a gallant Man) hurt
to your face, and for your sake, and whole death me thinks you should still
resent; O can there be a greater baseness then this. Yet you had the impudence
to give out, That you had me at your mercy, and thereby thought, as it seems,
that that false report, would expiate your baseness, in suffering your Friend
to be hurt, without seeking the blood of him thus did it: Confess truly
Windsor, Wast thou not so frighted at that instant, thus thou had not thy
wits about thee; I believe it really; for no man but a Knave, a Fool, and a
Coward, would bring a Friend out of England, on purpose for to set, and leave
him in a Trap of ruin, as thou did poor Goff, without endeavoring any
other way (then by Lying) for to revenge the injury he received: Nay more, did
you not likewise deny in the Field to justify either the Ladies actions, or
honor; nay did you not make your braggs in Flaunders, that you intended never
to Marry her, bus only to make a Whore of her; besides you showed a note under
her own hand (as you said). the which she had given you, wherein she did
bind her self to Marry you, if so be you did return within the space of
three months; suppose such a thing bad been, were not you a base fellow to
publish it, she having then not given you the least occasion of distaste, which
might have moved you to divalge those secrets, that had passed betwixt her and
you.

And when persons of Honor shall rightly understand all these Particulars of
you; do not you believe that they will detest you as I do, then consider with
your self to how mean and miserable a condition has your juggling and lying
brought you to, yet to deal truly with you, it is no more then what so base a
wretch as you are, does justly deserve.

And as for the Lady, although she has very much disobliged me, yet I should be
sorry if she proved so unfortunate, as to set a real esteem on your unworthy
Person; I can justly term you no otherwise, especially when I consider how
cunningly you lay at the catch with me, during the time of our difference; and
how unlike a Gentleman you dealt with me: for first you refused to meet in
France, and appointed me for to come into Flaunders, which I did accordingly;
but you after two days stay at Brussells (which was the place where we were by
your appointment for to meet at) were running back for England, as I have
under your own hand to show, and afterward I having sent for you a back from
Bruiggen Ministry came to wait on you as soon as I heard that you were
returned again to Brusselss, and then I could you that my Bills of Exchange
were not yet come; but that I did expect them daily; and that my being in a
strange Country, made me incapable (for the present) of fitting my self for to
give you satisfaction: But howsoever I hearing for a certain, that you had
brought a couple of Horses, to show you that I intended not to delay you, I
told you then, that if you would lend me one of them, that I would fight with
you either that night, or the next morning, which you pleased, but you refused
to do either.

Then I told you, that although you would not lend me a Horse, that I would
present you with a couple of Poast Horses, and that you should take your
choice, but that did so displease you, that you told me that you were not bound
to cast away your life, although I were content for to do it: Next I offered
to fight with you on so-, with a case of Pistolls, but your want of courage
made you both dislike it, and refuse for to do it.

Lastly, I offered to fight with you with a case of Pistolls in a little Wagon
with two Mastiffs before me, such as they daily use at Brussells, and that you
should take another; but that way of fighting you did also dislike; and in
short, you told me, that you had provided a couple of Horses for your self,
and that you being challenged were to appoint the time, place, and mmner of
fighting, and that if I did not meet you within three or four days, that then
you knew what course to take; so we parted, and that night I received a Bill
of Exchange of Fifty Pounds S:erling, for to be paid me at Antwerpe, and going
thither to receive it, I unfortunately lite upon the Nagg upon which I fought,
I may justly rerme him so, for he proved very hard mouthed, and unmanaged; and
the only reason that made me buy him, was, that he was not afraid of the noise
of a Pistol; so borrowing another Horse of a Friend for my Second, I instantly
came to wait on you, and I did (you cannot deny it) observe your desires in
every particular; nay, I did not refuse to meet you in the very Field you
appointed, although you refused to fight with me any where else, or in any
other Country; and indeed you had a great deal of reason for it, as it
appeared afterward, for in another place you might not have had the
convenience of bringing a Boat full of men, and of laying an Ambuscado all
night long in the Dirches, as you did, which was contrary to your promise, and
the agreement which you made with my Second, which was not to have brought any
body but your Second, Leivtenant Colonel Goff, within six miles of the place
where we were to fight at; and for my own particular, I do verily believe,
that you did your best to persuade those Persons you brought along with you (if
they would have been so base (to have destroyed me, either in the Field, or at
least to have strops me, in case you had fallen, for certainly else you would
not have appointed such a close place as that was to fight in.

For first, on the one side of the Field there was such high Hedges, broad
Ditches, and Woods, that it was in possible to have gotten away, and on the
other side, a broad River, that was not passable without a Boat; and by that
time we had done fighting, all the Boats were conveyed on the further side of
the River, so that in two Miles riding, I could hardly get one to carry me over
the Water; although when I came into the Field, several Boats were on that
side the River we sought on; nay more men that, the way out of the Field was
narrow, and so full of great Trees, and such broad Ditches on both sides of it,
as that one man might easily have stayed me; but in case they had mist me
there, I had no other way to save my self but close to the River side, where I
could hardly ride half a Mile on either hand, but that I should be
necessitated to pass over a Bridge, where two men might easily have stopped me;
besides, close to each of the Bridges was a House, where I saw men like
Soldiers: But your saying to my Second, that you did fear the rising of the
Boares, or Country men, I must confess did hinder my curiosity of fisting out
your Villainy then, although I have repented my self a thousand times since,
that I did not question the Fellows what they were, for I do verily believe
that they were set there by your order, and if you had not had some base
design upon me, why should you entice me into such a Trapp as that was, rather
then to give me a meeting in an open Country, there being large Heathes far
nearer those villages we lodged in the night before, then the Field was the we
met in the next morning, and I am sure a great deal more convenient for
fighting a Horseback; and Windsor, if thou were not given to Lying, thou
would not deny, but that this is a true description of the place where we
sought.

Then let the World judge if the carriage of this action be justifiable in a
Man that pretends to have either courage or honor: And indeed I cannot much
blame you to refuse reading my Letters, because it seems you desire not to be
put in mind of your baseness and treachery: Can you forget how you came
sneaking into the Field in a white Capp, as if you had been going to the
Gallows, and how like a Stinkard, as you are, you refused for to pluck off your
Doubler, and that for all your managed Horse, you durst not come within four
or five yards of me, but Carricoled round about me, knowing it your surest play
against me, being upon an unready Horse; yet for all this advantage you
discharged both your Pistolls at so great a distance from me, that you did
neither touch me nor my Horse; howsoever you cannot deny, but that both my
Pistolls did some execution, for with the first, I shot your Horse through the
neck, and with the last I frighted you so (after both your Pistolls were
discharged) that you rid close to your Second, as it were for Protection; and
indeed I finding my Horse so bad, that I could not with all the Art or Skill I
had, come close to you, by reason of the quick turning too and froe of your
Horse's I must ingeniously confess, that it put me so into passion, that I
resolved to venture my Pistol at you at a distance, which it seems narrowly
mist you and (much contrary to my intention, or desire) most unfortunately
killed your Second; which seriously greives me to the very Soul, that so
gallant a Man as he was should suffer, and that such a Foist as you are, should
escape.

Besides, when we came to the Sword, you daring not to come up to me, rid still
round about me, knowing the great advantage you had of me, by reason of the
goodness of your Horse; and indeed I perceiving of it too, clapped Spurrs to my
Horse, thinking to come close to you at last, but missing both you and your
Horse, by reason of a quick some that he nude, my Horse being very ill mouthed,
ran away with me, which advantage you did not neglect, but followed me in the
rear; yet at such a distance, that you were not within five or six yards of
me; but howsoever, I finding my self not able, either to stopp, or turn my
Horse, rather then to ride away, flung my self out of the Saddle, and falling
sidelong on the ground, I instantly stood up again, with my Sword in my hand,
calling several times to you, My Lord, if you are a gallant Man, light; since
my Horse (as you see) is a Jade, and that both you Pistolls and mine are
discharged; show your gallantly if you dare, and let us fight it out a Foot,
with our Swords, but you most cowardly refused to do it, although your Second
lay bleeding before you, and like a base fellow left the Field, when your
Second was even ready to swound, and had not my Second and I taken care of him,
he might instantly have bled to death; so little did you look after him; And
for your charging of me, for bringing Mr Rennolds behind me a Horsback out of
the Field: My answer to it, is this:

That I did it, first to show you that I was not so timorous then, as you were;
and next because the Boat you brought was almost gone out of sight, besides one
of Mr Rennolds ditch Companions, was run away with his Horse, so that not only
in civility, but also in gratitude I was obliged for to do it; for whilst I
was reaching a shirt of my own for to bind up Leivtenant Colonel Goffs hurt,
my Horse slipped the Bridle out of my hand, and run away, and Mr Rennolds brought
him to me again, so he saving me from goding a foot, I thought my self
bound to do him the like courtesy.

And for my being at the mercy of your Horses feet, that is as true as my
demanding my life of you, or your shouting, or your hurting me in the back,
which diverse (that have seen me since we fought) will justify you a Liar as
well as my self; and none but such a Bastandly Rascal as you are, could have
the confidence to report so damnable a Lie, there being (as thou know it
well enough Windsor) not the least tittle of it true.

And as for my taking up your Pistols in the Field, which afterward you were
afraid to receive out of my hands, although they were uncharged; the reason why
I was so civil to you, was the hopes I had thereby to stay you something longer
in Flanders: but your cunning and your Cowardly disposition together, haltned
you for England the very same day we Fought, although it was Sunday, and your
poor Second lying desperately wounded; yet no consideration whatsoever, it
seems, could stay your journey a day, which methinks did show too pannick a
fear in a person that pretends to have so much courage, but the censure of it
I shall willingly leave to Gallant men, that shall read this true Relation of
your actions: And for my own particular all the injury that I received by your
sudden departure was, that a Servant of mine mist delivering you a Letter,
although I sent it the next morning betimes: It is the Letter I mean, that I
sent you last into England, which was much to the same effect than this is off,
and not far different from the matter and phrase, yet you were plesed easily
to digest it, and perhaps you may do this too; but in case you do it, I
shall trouble you no more with my Letters; but I shall (as I have a soul to
save) poast you all over Christendom for a lying, cheating, and a treacherous
Coward: And do not think that although you have crept into the Title of a
Lord, that it shall preserve your Reputation; No Thomas Hickman, I shall make
thy actions appear to all the World to be base, and Cowardly, and thou scarce
a Gentleman by the Father but rather got by some snivling Groom or other, or
else thy courage would not wholly depend (as it does) upon thy Horse and
Horseman ship, and indeed if thou had not mean blood in thee, it were
impossible to be so unworthy, base, and treacherous as thou have been in the
whole carriage of the difference betwixt thee and me.

All this thy conscience will tell thee to be most true, then consider with thy
self, if thou are not one of the unworthiest creatures breathing; and if thou
doubts it, come to me, for thou know that I dare not for the present come
into England, and I will justify it to thy teeth: Besides, I will (upon my
Salvation) give thee fair play for they life, although thou soughtest mine by
treachery, yet thou shall find that thou have to do with a Gentleman that
detests soul actions, as much as he does hate thy Person.

Deceive me once poor Hickman, and prove Gallant; but I fear thee extremely,
for I know thy baseness far exceeds thy courage; yet I am come to Callis a
purpose to try and expect thee, if thou dare come over, I will fight with
thee, if not, I will Poast thee, and this is the Resolution of him that
resolves to make thee an example to all half spirited fellows of evermore
undertaking the Title of a Ladies Champion, Windsor, or Hickman; thou know
how narrowly once thou escapest my fingers, which makes me doubt thy coming
again: I pray thee, if thou have the blood of a Gentleman, and not altogether
of a Mechannick in thee, prove Gallant at last, and let me see thee. I am at
Callis where I intend to stay, until I am assured that thou dare not come
over, for shame be not so base and cowardly, as to refuse me a vifit, the
voyage is nothing, it is not above two days journey from London, fie, sommon
thy Spirits together, rather then to be Poasted, for (upon my says) I am
resolved to do it, and to make thy person, and thy Pintle so ridiculous, that
all Gallant men, and Ladies, shall not only scorn and laugh at thee; but
likewise point at thee, as the greatest cheat of courage and Lecherrie that
ever was borne, and a leffe revenge assure thy self shall not sastisfie me.

John Griffith.
From Callis in France, October. 22. 1649.
This Letter (in the presence of diverse Persons of quality) was delivered to
the Lord Windsor, by Captain Francis Marbles, who came purposely of France for
to do it. The Lord Windsor received it, but durst not so resent it, as to send
Prince Griffith a Challenge, whereupon Prince Griffith having notice of his
Lordships meannesse of spirit, did instantly send to Poast him: A just reward I
assure you, for so counterfeit a courage as the Lord Windsor appears to have
by this action.

O wonderful! The like to this, was never heard of before, that your so much
cried upp fighting Lord Windsor, should thus prove for to be but a Dwighill
Cock at Last: For shame, away with him, away with him, to the Beare-Garden;
there he may find a fit Companion for him to converse withal, and one that
relyes also, more upon his Horse and Horsemanship, then upon his Courage.

Finios coronat Opus. THere is a Pamphlet lately set forth in Print, called the
Lord Windsors Vindication, which is so full of untruthes, as that the Rascal
that writ it, dares as yell be damned as to own it so far, as to subscribe
his name to it: By which the World may easily see; how unworthy and Cowardly a
person Windsor is, who is forced to support that little honor he has, by bry
bing necessious, and Beggarly Pamphlettiers on the oneside, and by maintaining
Brothers of the Sword on the otherside to swear up and down the Tavernes in
London, that the Lord Windsor is a Gallant stout man: When Prince Griffith who
is scarce two days journey often this place, defies him daily, and offers for to
prove him both a notorious Liar, and a Coward to his Teeth, yet Windsor dares
not go to Callis, to question him for it: Although it is well known that
Prince Friffith cannot (for the present) come into England, else I am confident
that he would Gudgell his Lordship to some purpose, and if he be so Valiant,
and Prince Griffith such a Coward as the Pamphlet describes him to be, why then
does not Windsor go and beat him once again, it being so easy a thing to
do: It were more (in my opinion) for his Lordships Honor, for to undertake
it, then to stand railing (as he does) like a Butterqueane behind his
adversaries back; which I am confident Prince Griffith would scorn to do, I
mean to word it, had he the same liberty of coming into England, that the
Lord Windsor has of going into France.

Therefore let the World judge, whether it is possible that Windsor can be a
Person of a real courage, seeing he does endure a Poasting so patiently, as
not to dare to resent it otherwise, then by hyring some mean fellow another,
for to write a scurrilous lying Pamphlet in his Vindication: A poor revenge I
assure you for one that pretends to so much gallantry.

Windsor, I pity thee, for never Fox (^en he was hunted) used more shifts for
to save his life, then thou have done to preserve thy reputation; yet all thy
cunning, it seems, will not serve thy turn, for Prince Griffith is resolved
for to Baffle thee quire; and how to prevent it, I know not, unless thou will
be brought at last for to acknowledge the truth; that is, that thou will
confess ingeniously, that thou dare not fight, either with him, or with any
body else, unless thou art challenged, and then perhaps, thy Horse and
Ambuscado, may make thee give a man a meeting in the Field, which otherwise
thou dare not do.

And Windsor (let me tell thee as a Friend) be not so simple as to think, that
either Stories or lies (without fighting again) will either satisfy the
World, or blemish Prince Griffiths Reputation.

No, thou art hugely mistaken, if thou think so, for this is not the first
Duel (by half a score, or more) that Prince Griffith has sought, and with as
Gallant men as any have been of the English Nation; but I am sure that this is
the first, and I do verily believe, that it will be the last Duel that ever
you will fight, for I perceive (by your shifting and voyding to quarrel with
Prince Griffith again) that he did so frighten you when you sought that you
dare not for your hanging look him any more in the face, so damnable afraid
you are of him.

And as for the Pamphletiers saying, that the Lord Windsor gave Prince Griffith
his life; no man of Hononr and sense, I am sure, will believe, that a man in
one breath, shall both beg his life, and defy his Enemy, as Prince Griffith
did the Lord Windsor; which the Lord Windsors namelesse Villain does
acknowledge himself in his Pamphlet: And as for Prince Griffiths being
unmounted, his Letter will tell you how it came to pass, which you may receive
for a truth; nor is it likely that a man can be thrown out of a great Saddle,
when neither his Clothes nor Body was touched, either with the Lord Windsors
Sword or hands, as it can be made appear to this very hour; nor is it
credible that Prince Griffith should discharge his Pistol at Leivtenant
Colonel Goff, who was but a slander by, when he had such a Valiant Adversary
(as the Lord Windsor makes himself) for to deal withal.

Gentlemen I shall trouble you with no more particulars for the present, not
doubting but that the Lord Windsor, and his Pamphletteirs lying tongues, will
betray them sufficiently in the end, and make them both appear Persons so
contemptible, that they deserve hereafter, rather the scorn, then the anger of
any Gallant Man; For what greater baseness can there be in any man, then to
endeavor to injure a Person of so much honor (as Prince Griffith is) by
lying, as Windsor has done, when he has not the courage for to look Prince
Griffith in the face.

I need not, I believe, forbid Gentlemen for to take heed of so horrid a
Calumniator as Windsor is, who you may perceive has so utterly lost the sense
of Honor, that he is now become a fit Companion only for the Hangman;
therefore, Take him Derrick, Take him Derrick: I am sure thou have the consent
of all honest and Gallant Men, and especially mine:

Francis Marbles.
November the 12. 1649.
This Paper had been published sooner, had it not been prevented at the Press,
by three eminent Knaves; The Lord Windsor, the Knave of Clubs, and the Knave of
Spades; which two last, are resolved not to hate his Lordship an ace, either
for Courage or Honesty. I believe old Hickman, Windsors Father, got them all
three, for they do resemble one another extremely, in Humor, Condition, and
Gallantry.

FINIS.
