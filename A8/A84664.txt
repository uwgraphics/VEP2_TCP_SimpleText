A Declaration of his Excellency Sir Thomas Fairfax and the Council of War,
against a printed Pamphlet, pretending Authority from the Army, to dispossess
or interrupt such Ministers as were put into sequestered Livings by the
Parliament, or Authority derived from them.
WHereas it appears by sufficient proof, that many violent tumults and
outrages, are committed by several persons against diverse Ministers placed by
order or ordinance of Parliament, in sequestered livings. And for their so
violent carriages to and detaining from the said ministers their profits, there
is pretended by the said parties power and authority from the General and the
Army, and for the more plausible justifying of their undue pretenses therein,
have caused to be printed and published a pamphlet entitled, two Petitions of
the sequestered Clergy of England and Wales, one to the Kings most excellent
Majesty, and the other to Sir Thomas Fairfax, with a (pretended) Declaration of
the General and his Council of War thereupon. Of all which actions we
cannot but testify a very ill resentment, and do hereby declare a dislike of
such proceedings, disclaiming not only the actions themselves, to have had any
encouragement from us, but also any ends or intentions to that purpose. And to
the clearing our selves herein, we shall henceforth endeavor the bringing to
condign punishment, such who have or shall exercise the like upon any pretense
whatsoever.

Given under my hand and seal the 12 day of August. 1647. FAIRFAX.
