The general REMONSTRANCE or DECLARATION of the SEAMEN which inhabit in
London and thereabouts, dated the 31, of Ian, 1641.
WHereas we of the true Protestant Religion and the maintainer of the Gospel
under our gracious King and Parliament, and have been continually loving and
faithful Subjects to his Sacred Majesty, and notwithstanding the general and
hard oppressions suffered by subordinate Governors, to the Ruin of our lives,
if it had not been prevented by the providence of God, and the good care of
our King and Parliament, to prevent their designs before it came to
perfection, yet having all liberty of the true Religion from his Majesty out of
the effluence of his Princely care to us, and we waying no Corporal loss in
respect of that great Immunity of the Soul, we are inviolably resolved to
infix our selves in an immutable and pure Allegiance forever to his Sacred
Majesty, and his Successors, for the maintenance of the Gospel under them, and
to subdue all those which does oppose it, if his Majesty would be pleased out
of his Princely care, and providence, to give us leave.

So it is, that if his Majesty and this Honorable Parliament, would be
pleased to give unto Us and the Owners of these Ships the Privileges to have
Letters of Marts and free passage into the Seas, by the providence of the
Almighty GOD, we shall in a short time subdue all these Rebels and any that
does oppose his Majesty, or this Kingdom, or other Kingdoms for the
maintenance of the Gospel which does belong to his Majesty: and knowing none
to be so desirous to maintain it but the true Protestants, and none more
readier then we that does belong to the Sea, and thereby pretending the
general good of his Majesty and this Kingdom.

But we the said Seamen and true Protestants, and loyal Subjects to his
Majesty; do hereby proffer our selves and Lives for the maintenance of it,
touching our Religion in which we were Baptized in and under the Faith of our
Savior JESUS CHRIST.

But likewise, if his Majesty and this Parliament would be pleased to let us
be supported there, for to raise the name of the true Protestants here in
England and Ireland, and seeing this surprise so dangerous, tending absolutely
to the overthrow of the Liberty of our Consciences and Country, if it be not
prevented in time; and also our gracious Kings Power and Privileges forced
from him, in which, and in whose prudent Care have formerly been over Us and
the Gospel, our sole quiet, and comfort consisted, and without the which, the
fear of our present Ruins did prescribe opinion and premonish us to save our
selves; We therefore as well to regaine his Excellent Majesty's said
Prerogative, it being only due to Him and his Successors, and being the
essence and life of Monarchy, hoping thereby to Confirm a strong and
invincible Unity between his Royal and ever happy Love unto us and our
faithful Duty, and Loyalty to his incomparable Majesty. And the Rebels
having taken up Arms, and possessed themselves of the best and strongest Forts
of the Kingdom of Ireland to oppose his Majesty, and all those which does
maintain the Gospel, the which we do hope that the Almighty God, will save
and defend us from the tyrannous resolution of our Enemies, and this in our
Consciences as we do wish the Peace of the same to our selves and posterity,
is the pretense and true cause that does make us to declare our selves to God
and the World for the relief of these our poor distressed Brethren in Jreland.

We do declare unto God and the World, that what we do is for the
maintenance of our King and our Religion, and to defend our Brethren by our
relief at Sea.

We do desire that the Government of that Kingdom of Ireland might be put
into the hands of some godly and Religious man, and not to have any Papists to
inhabit there, nor within the Kingdom of England, nor any Popish Lords to have
place in this Honorable Court of Parliament, but to be utterly cast out.

Also we do desire, that those Commanders which are bound forth for that
service into Ireland, should take the Oath of alleagiance and Supremicie: so
that they which do go under them may be secured that they shall not be
betrayed into the hands of the Rebels, but to stand to maintain the Faith and
the Truth of the Gospel.

We taking it into our serious consideration, do for fear our Brethren
should be overcome of a sudden, and for the security of this Kingdom of
England, we have thought fit to have this our Declaration to be published, that
his Majesty and this Honorable Parliament would be pleased to consider of it,
and give us the Privileges of Letters of Marts for to keep these our Enemies
in subjection.

FINIS.
