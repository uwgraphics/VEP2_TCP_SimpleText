TO THE GENERAL COUNCIL OF OFFICERS.
The Representation of diverse Citizens of LONDON, and others Well-affected to
the Peace and Tranquillity of the Commonwealth.
AS We doubt not but the words of your friends will find acceptance, so our
Lives, Liberties, and All that is dear and near to us, being imbarqued in the
same Bottom with yours, we cannot be so insensible, as not to take notice of
the storm impending, nor so careless of our own Concernments, as not to lay
down our Observations before you.

When by the interrruption of Government you reduced these Nations unto that
condition they are now in, Though you could not be ignorant, that what you did,
would be very grateful to the Common Enemy; who always had the Parliament in
an odious memory for the great things God has done by them, and the little
hopes they have of ever prevailing against their industry and prudence; yet we
cannot in the least suspect, that you could (in that action) have before your
eyes the contentment of your malicious and implacable enemies; But rather a
cordial and sincere intention of settling those things so long contended for,
by a speedier hand then that of the Parliament, (of whose grave, slow, pace you
were impatient) exspecting thereby to give full satisfaction to all your
friends and adherents, to the uniting of them the firmlier to you. Other ends
then these, we hope could not enter into the hearts of many of you; And
therefore, taking this to be the case, and knowing that Experience is the best
Teacher, We desire leave to observe how little the success has hitherto
answered your Ends.

It is visible to all that have any occasion to converse with your enemies,
that they are exceedingly rejoiced at your late transactions, not doubting, but
by the division of your friends, to have an opportunity to destroy both you and
them.

And it is also as visible, that your friends are dissatisfied, not being able
to go along with you in your present undertakings; And that, not only as they
are without any warrantable Call made out to them, but also, as they are
against that acknowledged principle of all just Powers, being (under God)
originally in the People, and derived from them; Beyond which, we cannot be
free to act, or own any thing for Legal or unusurped; Knowing, that what is
settled by a party, will always be unstable, and subject to the wills, and
alterations of that party; especially, when it has the Sword, as the
restoration of the Parliament, though done with the greatest acknowledgment of
duty imaginable, is now made use of by many (though weakly) for the
justification of the late interruption.

We cannot also, but in taking notice that you having already spent near half
as much time upon the Government alone, without bringing any thing to maturity,
as the Parliament did in that and all other affairs, hope you are (to the
vindication of them) convinced of the greatness and difficulty of the work.

And lastly, we may observe, that if by rooting up foundations you must
necessarily give the common Enemy a great advantage, you ought to be assured
of a party able to oppose him; And that if all your friends united, be a body
small enough, for that end, you cannot rationally conceive that less then half
will be sufficient to maintain your quarrel, now your Enemies are
strengthened with the addition of France and Spain, who without doubt are at
this present vigorously at work.

We might say much more upon this subject, but thinking it needless to persons
who will be equally concerned with us in any common Calamity, we shall not
trouble you further then upon the whole to desire (which we do with hearts full
of sorrow and fear) That since (as we do assert) the restless adversary is not
likely to be idle; That he cannot in all probability be opposed but by the
union of your Friends; That there can be no union without restoring
foundations; That the interuption of Government cannot be continued without
weakening your hands to the strengthening those of your Enemies) That as the
only way left us for our preservation you would speedily (least otherwise it be
too late) withdraw the force from the Parliament House door, leaving the
Members lately interrupted to return to the discharge of their trust in
setleing the destracted affairs of this Commonwealth, and making provision for
future Parliaments; In doing which you willunite the hearts of your Friends,
oblige them to a Cordial Conjunction with you in the opposition of the common
enemy, and cause them once more to rejoice in having the less reason to be
afraid of what our adversaries can do unto us.

This Representation was delivered by diverse Citizens of London to the Lord
Fleetwood the 6th, of this present December, 1659. to be by him Communicated to
the General Council of Officers, as the only expedient to deliver this Nation
from (otherwise) inevitable ruin and destruction.
