A Declaration and Ordinance of the Lords and Commons assembled in Parliament,
for new Loans and Contributins, as well from the United-Provinces, as from
England and Wales, for the speedy relief of the miserable and distressed estate
of the Protestants in the Kingdom of Ireland; whose lives are daily sacrificed,
not only to the malice of their and our bloody enemies (the Popish Rebels) but
like like to Starving, Cold, and Hunger
WHereas the gasping Condition of the Kingdom of Ireland is too much manifest,
their estates d^voured, their lives daily sacrificed, not only to the malice
of their and our bloody enemies, the Popish Rebels, but likewise to the more
unavoydable executioners, Starving, Cold, and Hunger; their sorrows hardly to
be equaled, nor their utter destruction possibly to Be prevented, but by the
great and undeserved mercy of God, upon some speedy Supply of their grievous
necessities. In a deep sense and compassion of their sad estate, and not so
much doubting the charity of all good Protest^nts here (which has been so
fully manifested before) as to use many Arguments to invite them to a liberal
Contribution and Loan, for the present relief of those of our own Blood and
Profession, and to hinder the Rebels from being sh^rers in the execution of
those devilish Plots which they and their adherents in England have devised,
and too far effected amongst us (who can expect no safety ^ere, if that Kingdom
be not preserved unto us, that has so near a relation and dependence upon
this) and for the more speedy raising, collecting, and disposing of such Supply
as God shall incline the hearts of his people to afford their brethren in
Ireland, which can be no otherwise procured at this time, by reason of the
unhappy distempers here.

The Lords and Commons in Parliament do hereby order and declare, That all and
every His Majesty's well-affected Subjects of any His Kingdoms or Dominions,
and any person or persons of the Dutch Nation, under the Government of the
States general of the United Provinces, that at any time hereafter shall bring
in, and disburse any Sum or Sums of Money, to be employed and laid out for the
maintenance of the Army in Ireland against the Rebels, or that shall bring in
and deliver any Victual, Arms, Ammunition, Goods, Wares, or Commodities fit
and necessary for the better supply of the said Army, to be received and
indifferently apprized and valued, by such person and persons as shall be
appointed for that purpose by the Committee for the Irish Affairs, made the 30
of September, 1642. or any eight of them, those intrested with this Service,
and that are hereafter named; That all and every such person and persons shall
have the public Faith of the Parliament, and both Houses of Parliament do
hereby engage the public Faith of the Kingdom, to satisfy and content, and

confiscate when it shall please God that Kingdom shall be reduced, in
proportion answerable and according to the several sum and sums of Money, in
manner and form aforesaid to be brought in, and in all respects and things to
their best advantage and contentment, as the Adventurers for Lands in Ireland,
according to the former Propositions and several Acts of Parliament, or any of
them, therefore made and enacted this present Session, shall have their Lands
