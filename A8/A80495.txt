THE COPY OF A LETTER to General Monck.

The Copy of a Letter to General Monck.
My Honored Lord;
THough virtuous inclinations in their Infancy and Cradle, are best Nursed up
with the Milk of Flattery and seeming Courtships; your full grown virtues
(which like Saul amongst the people, make you more eminent than others; and the
eyes of our Israel to look upon you, as their Deliverer) will bear a more
engenuous freedom; which makes me presume (though none more truly honors your
Prudence, Piety and Person than my self) as I am here entrusted to receive the
corresponding intelligences from most Counties that have concentred their Hopes
and Addresses in your Lordship, you will Pardon me; if (as the burning-glasse
that collects the scattered and loose beams of the Sun, to give them a more
powerful and vigorous operation) I reflect the united sense of all to you; in
relation to your Words and Actings.

The last of which, have been so prudent in Conduct; so daring (yet modest) in
the approaches to your proposed ends; and so successful in the great late
changes, we look upon, as inlets to a settlement of the peace and happiness of
this Kingdom; as you stand yet unequalled by any in the opinions and
affections of the people, even above men; and only below God himself (and our
rightful King) who has wrought so great wonders by you: And we hope will set
fast the bars of our gates, and establish peace in our borders by so glorious
an Instrument; and in it record your memory to all posterity, as the deliverer
of this Nation from the high Usurpation and severe Tyranny we have long
labored under.

But my Lord in relation to your words, and Declared desires to the late
restored Members of Parliament, there are few satisfied, but such as hope, that
with Frederick Duke of Austria, you went abroad in a disguise to hear what
others judgments were; by them and their reasons (if convincing yours) to
shape your future proceedings; or (if it were your judgment) that you did
declare and enforce it withal the advantage Oratory or Arguments could
contribute to its support; that in the confutation of them all persons of those
mistaken principles might be reduced by your example; who espouses no interest
but in order to Gods glory and the public good; nor impose your opinion upon,
but submit it to the dispassionate Debates and Resolutions) of a Free
Parliament, which humility and self-denial is the crown and glory of all your
other noble Actions; and that which sets you up a Scepter in the hearts of all
(but Factious and Fanatic people) and gives you a Command of our Persons and
Purses.

Yet give me leave, as the Echo of the Kingdoms voice; to tell your Lordship,
it neither is, or ever was, for the alteration of our Monarchical Government
into Commonwealth foundations, which are inconsistent with our ancient
Fundamental Laws, and the humor of the people of this Nation; who comparing
the long happy and flourishing condition it has for many hundred years enjoyed
under their Kings, and Reverent Episcopacy, with the tragical effects of our
late changes; cannot be in love with their Irons and Shackles; nor be willing
to submit to Papal. Presbyteriall Tyranny (for such is rigid Presbytery) that
have been acquainted with the gentler Yoke; the Fathers of our Church laid upon
us.

And though I might make it appear to your Lordship by clear proofs, and
undisputed authorities from Reason, Nature, Scripture, and Authority.

First, that as all Power is Gods, so there is no exercise of it from divine
Commission, but (paternal) what is seated in the person of one man originally;
and derivatively only from him (as the spring and source) into the lesser
streams of subordinate administrations (which Adam was vested in the state of
innocence;) and that all men are borne to this natural subordination; for the
orderly support of humane societies, (families being the epitomies of
Kingdoms) wherein the person to whom the supreme power belongs, is only
accountable to God for his Actions (Kings being subject only to the direction
not coaction of humane Laws.

Secondly, That our Kings had this right justly conveyed to them by the grace
of God (not gift of man) and by it have a just title to our allegiance and
obedience, both by divine and civil right, as all our laws and Parliaments
have declared.

Thirdly, That King Charles the son (of his late glorious Father and our
Sovereign) has de jure; the same; and cannot without Rebellion (a sin as high
as that of witchcraft) be denied him.

Fourthly, That Episcopacy is of divine institution an order deduced through
all ages of Christ's Church; and continued to us by lawful and undoubted
ordination.

Fifthly, That Bishops have in all ages had Reverence paid them as the Pillars
and supporters of Christianity; by their pious learned and painful labors;
when living and propagating it when dead; by their bloodshed in Martyrdom; when
one dying man made many living Saints.

Sixthly, That it was not the Calling? but exorbitancies in it; not the Tree,
but the Luxurious branches these times at first complained of; and desired to
prune, not digg up.

Seventhly, That it was a Government admired and approved by all the reformed
Churches abroad, as essential to the been esse of a Church; and by many learned
divines (ancient and modern) to the esse, the very being of a Church.

Eighthly, That Presbytery as propounded by our Synod of Divines is of a
bastard extraction, and a late birth; being a stranger to antiquity; and an
action lately legitimated amongst us; a thing so far from being countenanced;
as it was never known in the Christian Church.

Yet waving all these and infinite more considerations, I could offer (humbly
casting my self upon your mercy for a pardon of this deviations) I shall not so
much reflect upon your Lordships reasons against introducing Monarchy and
Episcopacy; as to show you they were never taken away by any just power; (admit
it were in the late Parliament, when full and Free, for until several forces
and violences were acted upon them and the Secluded Members denied their Votes;
There was no Regicide, (no murdering of the heirs that the Vineyard might be
ours) no Votes for altering our ancient (and best fabricated Government in the
world) but on the contrary all the Parliaments Protestations, Declarations,
Actions, and Covenants were for King and Parliament, Conjunctim not divisim;
and were so intended to be adhered to by our Confessors (though not Martyrs)
the lately restored Members; and only surviving honorable mention of that
expired Parliament.

Nor did the people of this Nation ever voluntarily contribute either of their
persons or purses to other ends than the Parliament had declared, even a
confining of arbitrary power, and keeping all things in their own bounds and
channels, a reforming, amending the Watch, not the taking it in pieces.

So as the peoples interests in this are safe, but cannot be entitled to the
endeavors of the chains you mention without a just forfeiture of all they
enjoy; a maintaining of perpetual divisions at home and inviting War from the
injured persons, and their now powerful united confederates abroad; having no
Free nor Full Parliament to countenance them in such actings.

And that this was the sense, the Covenant was taken in, and of the Kingdom
now in General; I desire may be submitted to their Votes in the free
Reprosentative to be called, or that they may have a Ballet for it, and then
they will appear a hundred for one to make it good.

Nor is the glory of the City, and opening of Trade at home and abroad, to be
boyed up by any other Engine than what the name of King actuates: It being the
splendour of Courts, increase of Nobility, Amities abroad, and Peace at home,
that loades the Vine with Clusters, and makes the Wine Press to overflow; as
Londons experience evincingly may prove, if we compare their now withering and
formerly sprouting and flourishing condition together; so as a Commonwealth in
those and many other respects would rather prove a heightening to the disease
than a remedy.

And for the Government of the Church, so far as it is prudentiall, it ought to
be submitted to the Parliament and a Convocation of Divines (justly called) but
what is of Divine Right in it, ought to be preserved and preferred before our
Lives and Liberties.

And therefore I most humbly contend for Episcopacy; as an order at least (if
not to maintain it in its primitive glory; and in that none can be sure there
is a good Ordination without it (unless in case extraordinary) and that all
do agree the Ordination by Bishops lawful; we ought to choose a safe before a
doubtful way, as all Casuists agree.

However, having fully as I conceive, undermined the grounds and satisfied the
reasons, your Lordship laid and urged for a Commonwealth; I shall proceed no
further upon this head, since you have made my Conclusion; That Episcopacy
holds best proportion and semetry to Monarchical Government; and that I have
made it appear, there neither is, nor can be any other form justly introduced
into this Nation.

Yet to take in all Interests, and concenter them in a conscientious obedience
(the sinew of Government) I wish both may be so moderated in their exercise of
power, as there may be no more leading into captivity, nor complaining in our
streets; But that the King with his Parliament, and the Bishops with their
Presbyters may join to make the close of our Harmony most melodious.

For thus our King will have an inexhaustible treasure in the affections of his
People; and they best secure their Liberties in becoming their Sovereigns
favorites; which happy espousals, I will yet hope to see you solemnize it in a
Concurrence with the whole Nation; whose desire it is as well as the Prayer of;

Your Excellencies most humble Servant.
