Now beware of that black Character of the last and worst times, 2 Timothy 3.2.
Unthankful, unholy; whether it be unthankfulness to God, or to men; and
those are unthankful, first, who esteem not mercies to be mercies, as our
Malignants, who had rather things had gone prosperously on the other side:
Secondly, who are not the better for great mercies, victories, deliverances,
discoveries of wicked plots, and precious favors, partly in possession, and
partly in expectation; whereas the goodness of God should lead us to
repentance, Romans 2.4. Yea, many live as if they were delivered to all their
abominations, as in former prosperity, Jer. 7.10. Thirdly, who rest in the
means and men, by whom the mercies were sent; wise Counselors, brave
Soldiers, excellent helps, so resting in the arm of flesh: A carnal
glorying. Our rule is, to give God the glory, whatever we think or say of the
men; as Judge. 5.9. My heart is toward the Governors of Israel, that offered
themselves willingly among the people: Bless ye the Lord. Fourthly, who take
the praise and glory of any good unto themselves; as Herod the praise of his
eloquence, Acts 12.23. Neither God nor their brethren, but themselves must be
magnified; whereas the godly have ever been careful to put it off from
themselves, saying, Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy Name give
glory, for thy mercy and for thy truths sake, Psalm. 115.1.

Consider for motives to thankfulness: First, that the Lord looks for the
honor of his great works; as that the cleansed Leapers should return unto
him; It is his will in Christ Jesus concerning us, 1 These. 5.18. Secondly,
whereas he loses his praises among an unbeleeving and carnal generation, it
is fit he should find it among his faithful ones; He inhabits the praises of
Israel, Psalm. 22.3. if there were not some that mind him in his ways, he should
lose the praise of his great works altogether. Thirdly, it is not only the
employment of Saints on earth, but o^ the Saints and Angels in Heaven, day and
night singing Hallelujah to him that sits on the throne, Revel. 4.8. and
certainly, our life is nearest to perfection, when it is nearest to the life of
Heaven. Fourthly, it is due unto God, as any money is due from one man to
another, and in honesty ought to be paid, 2 Cor. 8.21. Provide for honest
things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but in the sight of men: Beware of
an arrest from the High Court of Heaven. Fifthly, it is an honest and holy
policy to get more at the hands of God; namely, if he shall see us unthankful
for former favors; as also among men, thankfulness for old good turns,
inviteth new: And consider, Christians, we need now a Crown to be set upon the
great works already done for us; even the top-stone of the building: We are not
yet in Canaan.

But wherein stands the due thankfulness?

First, in respect of God, to be drawn up by these his works to a closer and
nearer communion with him, to fall often into ravishing admirations of him, and
of his free love to us; to delight our selves in him, love him, fear him,
honor him, trust in him for time to come; to wait better upon him, without
distraction, and serve him in truth with all our heart, considering how great
things he has done for us, 1 Samuel 12.24. All being purposely done to lead us
nearer to himself; and he is better and greater then any of his works,
whatever they be: And the time will be, that himself will be left to us, to be
all in all for our blessedness; the Temple and the Light, Rev. 21.22, 23.

Secondly, in respect of his great works: About which, we read of diverse acts
of holy men; as first, To have pleasure in them, Psalm. 111.2. As the Lord has
pleasure in the prosperity of his servants, so his servants have pleasure in
him, and in his merciful dealings with them: secondly To seek them out, ibid.
that they may know and be acquainted with them particularly: It suffices not
to hear of them by the by, but they will hearken after them: Eli sat by the
way side, to hear what was become of the Army: thirdly, to observe them, as
things they mean to record and make an holy use of them, Psalm. 107.43. Who so
is wise, and will observe those things, even they shall understand the loving
kindness of the Lord: People love to go forth to see some great pomp or
Pageant that passes by; but the works of God are matters of weight and
substance: fourthly, to prize them, as coming from a precious love and
counsel of peace by Christ, who did greater things for them, and intends to
do more; Psalm. 139.17. How precious are thy thoughts unto me O God! and this
is the best way to breed a real thankfulness, not the having, but prizing of
mercies: fifthly, to think and meditate on them at times with ravishing
thoughts, as men more then Conquerours through Christ, and enabled to triumph
in him over all our enemies; Psalm. 92.4, 5. Thou Lord have made me glad through
thy work, I will triumph in the works of thy hands; O Lord how great are thy
works! and thy thoughts are very deep. At first we consider them but slightly;
but this chewing the cud will make a perfecter digestion. Sixthly, to Remember
and have them still in readiness, for quickening of thankfulness and other
holy uses above mentioned: Psalm. 105.5. Remember his mervailous works that he
has done, his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth: Memory is the treasury
of the soul; fit to lay up such Jewels. Seventhly, to speak of them severally,
so far as we can; that others may be edified and excited unto thankfulness,
and our children after us may preserve the memory of them from one Generation
to another: Psalm. 145.6, 7. Men shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts;
and I will declare thy greatness: they shall abundantly utter the memory of
thy great goodness, and shall sing of thy righteousness.

If ye instance in these times, tell of Edgehill, Marston-moore, Naseby,
Routen-heath, and other Victories; and all that power, glory, wisdom, mercy,
justice and truth, which the Lord has caused to pass before us: Tell of a
great enemy subdued, great prisoners taken, great Garrisons received, great
store of Arms and Ammunition yielded up: Tell of hellish and desperate plots
most happily prevented: Tell of courage in Soldiers, faithfulness in Seamen,
fear melting and chasing our enemis, refreshment to the weary parts of the
Kingdom, fears of evil almost come to an end, hopes of special blessings
which the Lord has in store for us, and how in these Countries we have escaped
the miseries of war, which our Brethren have endured: Tell of Noble Leaders
whom God has raised and blessed to be instruments of our good; of our
excellent Parliament; of our ever to be honored Brethren of Scotland; of
loving and free-hearted Londoners; of Foreigners forbearing to intermeddle; of
other mercies; and our great unbelief all along the trial, incorrigiblenesse
by the rod, unthankfulness in the Covenant, unthankfulness after so great
favors: review the mercies again, and tell of their sweetness and
usefulness, their variety, their plenty and multitude, the freeness of
conferring them, the seasonablenesse, the watchfulness of God to take the due
time, other commending circumstances; willingly lose your selves in relating
them, and adoring our great Benefactor; which is the chief intent and desire
of the Writer, and

Your Remembrancer, W. I.
