A CALL AND A WARNING, TO ALL Priests, Professors and People, Who have and do
profess the Scriptures, that they may try their Doctrines and Practices by it,
and may own condemnation in their Doctrines and Practices, wherein they are
contrary to the Scriptures. AND A TENDER VISITATION TO The whole WORLD, That
they may own this their Visitation, and may be healed and restored to the Lord;
And this may serve for a LOOKING GLASS, wherein People may see what visage they
are of, and how they stand related as unto GOD. By a Sufferer in Hartford
Goal, for faithful witness-bearing, against this sinful generation; known by
the name of JOHN GOULD.

London, Printed for Thomas Simmons at the Bull and Mouth near Aldersgate, 1657.

THis following testimony was given forth chiefly as out of tender love to the
Priests and Professors, and inhabitants of Hartford and Ware, and the country
thereabout, who lies in darkness and ignorance, under blind guides, and so are
ever learning, and cannot come to the knowledge of the truth; and this is
written only for their information, but may be serviceable in any part of the
world, among such who does profess the Scriptures: So let all the sober people
of that country about Hartford consider, and not wilfully contemn and despise
the day of their visitation, which now is upon them from the Lord, that they
may come to the knowledge of his ways, and let all other people weigh what
herein is written, for the very clear day of Gods tender visitation is upon the
whole world: Remember you are warned now in your lifetime.

A CALL AND A WARNING, TO ALL Priests, Professors and People, etc.
O All ye people, Professors and Priests of the world, and to all others every
where, who have an eye to see, and an ear to hear, high and low, rich or poor,
of what sort of profession soever, whether Presbyterians, Independents,
Baptists, or by what other by-name known or distinguished, who are seeking the
Kingdom of heaven in outward observations, Lo here, and lo there, in this
duty, and this days observation, or in the other performances (as you call
them:) Be it known unto you all, from the Lord, that you are out of the way it
is not to be found there, for the Kingdom of God comes not with outward
observations, neither shall they say any longer, lo here, or lo there, for
the Kingdom of heaven is within; So said Christ Jesus to the Pharisees who
were seeking the Kingdom without in outward observations, so say I to you,
their children by the spirit of the same Christ Jesus, whom your fathers slew
and hung upon a tree; for your new Moons, and Sabbaths, your calling of your
Solemn, and your appointed Fasts and Feasts, my soul loathes, they are even an
abomination unto me says the Lord, for your hands are full of blood and
cruelty, even the blood of the innocent cries in mine ears, whom ye like your
fathers have shamefully entreated, and crucified, and hung upon a tree, and yet
are professing his words, whom they slew, and their words, who witnessed him,
and preached him, and your selves found in the same practice with them who
crucified the just one, and required to let loose the murderer, yet ready many
of you to say, as they of old did, if we had lived in those days, we would not
have done so wickedly: Oh what think ye will be in the end hereof; when the
just God shall come to call you to an account for all this, do you think
getting his words, and their words, to profess and talk of, will save you from
the wrath to come, who are despisers and haters of their life, both in your
selves and others, where he is made manifest, and are scoffers and scorners at
them who do witness it, (calling them in derision) Quakers, and yet make a
profession of Moses writings, and David's words, and Habakkuks Prophecy, and
Paul's Epistles, who all witnessed Quaking; ye Hypocrites, search the Scriptures
and see, whether ye are not in their steps, who despised Moses Law, and made
Songs of David, and mocked, and slew the Prophets, and persecuted Paul, and
stoned Stephen, which bare witness to and for the Lord, and against your Idol
Temples, and yet make profession of their words; to the light in all your
consciences I speak, which will let you see that you are out of their life, who
wrote and spoke forth those words; and are ye so foolish to think a profession
of those words will save you, who do not know nor witness the same life from
which those words were spoken, but are enemies to it, and murderers of it in
your selves, and persecutors of it in others, witness some of my righteous
servants, in Hartford Goal, whom ye have cast into prison, some of you, without
the breach of any known Law of your own Nation, and contrary to my righteous
Law which I have placed in all your consciences, unto which you must all be
accountable, in that day wherein God shall come to judge the secrets of all
hearts by my Gospel, which has been declared even in your streets and
Sinagogues, if you had ears to hear: O foolish and slow of heart, to believe
all that the Prophets have written, and all that Christ and the Apostles were
witnesses of, ought not Jesus thus to have suffered and to have entered into
his glory? is there another way for the salvation of your souls but him, who is
the way, the truth, and the life? and can any come to the father but by him,
who is the light of the world, and lights every one that comes into the
world? Is there another Savior, save me, says the Lord? or another Redeemer,
save the Holy One of Israel, our King, whom ye professors, priests, and people,
with bloody hands have crucified and slain, even him, whom God has raised up
to be a Prince and a Savior, to give repentance unto Israel, and remission of
sins? Have ye not evilly entreated his messengers and servants, whom he has
called and chosen to be witnesses hereof, in these your days, as your
Forefathers of old did, so do ye; search the Scriptures which ye profess, and
see if they be not fulfilled by you, and shall be fulfilled upon you, as ever
by them of old; they shall hall you out of their Synagogues, and before Rulers
and Magistrates, and some of you shall they cast into prison and shall do and
speak all manner of evil, falsely and despightfully against you for my name
sake, says Christ; yea, they that kills you, shall think they do God
service; and this will they do unto you for my name sake because they have
neither known me nor my father, see if ye be not they; and if this be not so, O
ye priests, professors and people, who deny the Revelation of Christ, and say
all Revelation is ceased and that none must expect Revelation now, are ye not
such as the Scriptures (which in words ye profess, but in life and power deny)
witnesses against, to know neither the Father, nor the Son? and no marvel ye
are found in such practices, which he whom we have received, and do bear
witness of foretold, and in those days declared of; and so the Scriptures are
owned and witnessed unto by us, who are in the life or them, and in the
possession and enjoyment of him of whom they declare; as also do bear witness
against you, who have the words declared, but are found enemies to the life,
and in the same practices with them, who had Moses and the Prophets, which
declared and prophesied of him to come; but when he came, and was made
manifest, would not own him, nor receive him, but rejected him, and murdered
him, who was the life of Moses and the Prophets words; and yet said, that had
they been in the days of their Fathers, they would not have slain the Prophets
that prophesied of his coming; and ye now in these days, be ye witnesses
against your selves, even of the same generation, who have not only their words
who prophesied of his coming, but say he is come, and have his words, and their
words, who wrought and witnessed him come, to profess, and ready to say, had we
been in their days, we would not have done so wickedly, nor cruelly; and yet
ye your selves doing the same thing, even persecuting, and evilly entreating
them, who now witness him come, who is the end of the Law and the Prophets,
Christ Jesus the righteous, whom ye crucify; and think thou this, O man,
who condemnest another, and do the same, that thou shall escape the
judgments of God, or despisest thou the riches of his grace, long-suffering
and patience, not knowing that the goodness of God should lead thee to
repentance: Oh what will ye do in the end hereof, oh ye people, professors and
priests, who are groaping in the dark even at noon day, when repentance shall
be hid from your eyes, who will not own him, nor receive him, to lead you
unto it, who is the light of the world, and lights every one that comes
into the world, whom the world cannot receive, but reject him as ye do,
(even as the Master Builders and professors of old did) who are calling his
light, which lights every one that comes into the world, natural; and say
it is not sufficient to lead unto salvation all that are guided by it, and live
and walk up to it; and herein are you manifest to be blind leaders of the
blind, and how can you be otherwise, that deny the light which lights
every one that comes into the world? Do you think he I alvvayes vvait and
call upon you, O ye foolish and slow of heart to believe, do ye think he will
check and reprove prove you ever for your evil deeds, and that his spirit shall
always strive with you? O ye priests, professors and people, will ye thus
reject and contemn the Lord your Maker, and still go on to slander the
footsteps of his Anointed, and think to escape and prosper? notwithstanding
all this, are ye not they who say in your hearts, We will none of this man to
reign over, but we will walk on after the imaginations of our own hearts,
adding drunkenness unto thirst, and covetousness unto pride, and yet profess
to know him, and to observe a day to him, and come and pretend to bow and
worship before me, says the Lord, when your hearts are a whoring from me after
your pride and vanity, and lusts and covetousness, and all manner of
iniquities? Will I be enquired after by such a people as this? Shall not my
soul be avenged on such a people as this, who provoke me daily to my face,
notwithstanding all my reproofs, but hate my reproofs, and cast my Laws behind
their backs and say in their hearts, We will not have this man to rule, even my
Son, whom I have sent a light into the world, whom they (as their Forefathers
of old) crucify and slay, and shed the innocent blood in their land, even the
streets of their great City, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where
our Lord is crucified, as well as at Jerusalem; to the light in all your
consciences I speak, which will let you see, is it not so? deceive not your
selves; Can any do thus and be saved? Can any kick and spurn against him and
not be confounded and destroyed? Can any reject him, and he not grind them to
powder? The stone cut out of the mountains without hands smites at the feet of
your great image, even your mighty image, whose head is of gold, back and
breasts of silver, belly and thighs of brass, legs of iron, feet part of iron,
and part of clay, and it shall tumble and crumble down to the dust, and none
shall be able to deliver it out of my hands, says the Lord; for Babylon the
great is come up into remembrance before me, says the Lord, even all her
Enchantments and Sorceries whereby she has bewitched my people Israel to sin
against me, with her lying divinations, and false doctrines, saying, the Lord
has said it, when of a truth I never spoke to them, nor never sent them at
all; therefore have they not profited my people at all, but have taken of my
wool, and of my flax, and of my wine and my oil, and of my kine, and of my
sheep, and have spent it on her lusts, and her lovers; but now am I coming to
require these things at her hands, and I will strip her naked and bare, even
she who has said in her heart, I sit as a Queen, and shall see no sorrow;
sorrow and misery, Widdowhood and loss of children shall come upon her in one
day, and all her lovers with whom she has played the harlot shall not save nor
deliver her out of my hands, says the Lord, your righteous Judge, who judges
not for gifts nor rewards, but will plead the cause of the innocent, and him
that has no helper in the earth, and will recompense double into her bosom,
even for all the blood of the innocent that have been shed in the midst of her,
even blood double, even till it come up to the horse bridles; and happy shall
he be, that takes Babilons brats, and dash out their brains against the
stones, for she is come up into remembrance before me, says the Lord, even she
who has made all the kindreds of the earth drunk with the cup of her
fornication, and all the Kings and Princes, Governors and Rulers of the earth,
has committed incest and fornication with her, and the blood of my Saints have
been shed by them in the midst of her; therefore shall she receive blood to
drink, for she is worthy, even the dregs of the cup of my fury that will I
wring out unto her, says the Lord, shall she drink of, and shall spue, and
fall, and never rise more; and they that have committed fornication with her and
her lovers, and her Merchants, and such as have had traffic with her by Sea,
and all occupiers of ships beholding her shall stand afar off, crying, Alas,
alas, for that great City, which was the glory of the whole earth, wherein was
so much traffic for gold and silver, and needle works, and diamonds, and
pearls, and precious stones, and silks, and velvets, and scarlets, and fine
linen, and all manner of broidered works, and whisks, and vails, and
neck-laces, and powderings, and crispings, and platings, for in one day is her
torment come upon her, and the smoke thereof shall ascend up for ever and ever:
And do ye think the professing of these words will cover ye, O ye priests,
professors and people; or that by your meanings, conceivings, or private
interpretations ye can put them off from you; or that ye are not meant and
concerned in them, who are found in her practices, and doing her service, and
become as a pander unto her, to usher in her wickedness, by denying the light
which lights every man that comes into the world, which convinces the world
of sin, and shows it plainly that these things are not of God, but of the
devil, envy, lying, and swearing, and drunkenness, and whoredom, and pride,
and vanity, and prodigality, by which the Merchants of the earth are waxen rich
and fat, and are become valiant and strong, to reproach the living God, and
slander the footsteps of his Anointed; and are ye not found in such practices,
O ye priests, professors, and people, let the light in all your consciences
answer? is it not so? What mean ye thus to fight against the Lord? Will ye set
briars and thorns in battle against me, says the Lord, shall I not even pass
thorough them, and consume ye together? or will ye Potsherds of the earth still
strive against your Maker? Shall I not dash ye to pieces like a potters vessel,
and rule ye with my iron rod? O ye Kings and Rulers of the earth, who are
joined together against the Lord, and against his Anointed, whom ye evilly
entreat, and despitefully use for my Name sake, says the Lord, saying, Come
let us join together to root out the name of Israel from under heaven; let us
break his bands asunder, and cast his cords from us, for we will not have this
man to rule over us; come, let us sell him into Egypt, let us make strong Laws
and binding against him, so we may cast him into prison, and into dungeons, and
drive him into dens and caves of the earth, even to root out the name of Israel
from under heaven, for Israel shall not go free, says proud Pharaoh, Gods
enemy; but he that sits in heaven laugheth your consultations to scorn, and
has you in derision: O ye Kings and Rulers of the earth, serve the Lord with
fear, and rejoice with trembling; kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye
perish in the mid way, if his wrath be kindled but a little; blessed are all
they that put their trust in him, for this has the Lord determined, even to
exalt and set his King upon his holy hill of Zion, who shall rule the Nations
in his anger with a rod of iron, and shall dash them in pieces like a potters
vessel, for all those mine enemies, says he, that will not that I shall rule
over them, shall be slain by the edge of the Sword, for the mouth of the Lord
has spoken it, and it shall be accomplished upon your heads; for the Lord God
is not a man that he should lie, or as the Son of man that he should repent,
but what he has decreed shall suddenly come to pass; and who is he that shall
dare to withstand him, and say, why do thou so? wherefore hear, O ye Kings,
and be instructed, O ye Rulers of the earth; break off your sins betimes by
repentance, and your iniquities, by showing compassion on the poor, lest I come
upon you in my fury as an armed man, and cut you asunder, and sweep you away
with the beesome of Consumption, and there be none to deliver you out of my
hands, says the Lord; for this will be the portion of their cup, who will
not be guided and counseled by me in their lifetime; but running a-vvhoring
from me after other gods, which have eyes and see not, ears and hear not,
neither have understanding at all, they who make them are like unto them, and
so are all those that put their trust in them; therefore consider what you are
a doing, you who make unrighteous decrees, and establish iniquity by a law to
oppress the poor, and the innocent, and to grind the face of the fatherless,
even the fatherless, the widow, and the stranger, and him that has no helper
in the earth; for I see you, says the Lord, and behold all your thoughts and
purposes, concerning them in secret, and I will declare them openly, and
reprove them openly, and ye shall be ashamed and consounded for all your
wickedness against me, says the Lord, and all your private determinations
against my holy ones, my holy seed, the lot of mine inheritance, says the
Lord, who has loved them, and given my self for them, to redeem them unto my
self for ever, and none shall pluck them out of my hand, nor out of my fathers
hand, for my father is stronger then all; I and my father am one, wherefore in
the dread and power of God I warn you, to take heed what ye do, and what ye
plot and contrive against the innocent, for the Lord is their helper, lest ye
be found fighters against God, but let Israel go free, that he may do service,
and worship the Lord his God in the wilderness, for to that end has he caused
me to write unto you, O ye Rulers of the earth, lest ye be made as Pharaoh for
the hardness of your hearts against my chosen, who is the meek of the earth,
against whom no weapon formed shall prosper, but shall return even as a dart to
pierce through the liver of him that formed it, for Israel is my battle axe and
weapon of war, with which I Will dash the mountains to pieces, and scatter them
as dust before the whirlwind of mine indignation, which shall blow upon the
wicked, till they be utterly consumed from off the face of the earth; thus
shall it be done unto all that will not that I shall reign, and that my Son
shall rule, whom I have sent a light into the world, to lighten them that sit
in darkness, and in the shadow of death, and to guide their feet into the way
of peace; wherefore prepare to meet thy God, O Israel, with fasting, and
weeping, and mourning, by putting away thine iniquities from before mine eyes,
says the Lord, cease from doing evil, learn to do well, come then, and let us
reason together, says the Lord, though thy sins were as crimson, I would make
them as white as wool, and though they were as scarlet, yet would I make them
as white as smow; and if thou would return, my mercy would I not utterly take
away from thee, nor suffer my truth to fail; but if thou will not return, thou
must be destroyed, both thou and thy King; wherefore consider your ways and
doings, O ye priests, professors, and people, do ye think a profession of his
words, who is the life, will save you from wrath to come, who are enemies to
his light and life, and will not have him to rule and reign in you, and over
you, who is the way to the Father, and to his knowledge, whom to know is life
eternal, and Jesus Christ whom he has sent? And do ye think ever to come to
the knowledge of him, O ye priests, professors, and people, who are talking and
professing of serving God in his own way, and that such as will have Christ,
must have him in his own way, and on his own terms, and it will not own him the
way, even the way of his own appointment, the light; Does not the Scriptures,
ye professors, declare it? or does it say it self is it? or is there another
way then what it declares of, or another name given whereby the sons of men
can be saved? what mean ye that ye thus oppose the Lord and his way? are ye
stronger then he? has he not said he will no longer be served and worshipped in
Temples made with men's hands, and will ye still be serving him contrary to his
mind hands, and will, and yet profess to serve and worship him in his own way?
has he not said, that he dwells not in temples made with hands, and will ye
be still seeking of him there, notwithstanding all this? Has he not invited
and called upon all to come unto him, that they might have life? and will ye be
seekign life in the Scriptures for all this? has he not said the Kingdom of
heaven comes not with outward observances? and will ye remain still seeking of
it in those things; and yet be telling the people, and professing that God must
be served and worshipped in his own way, and yet seek to keep people in your
own ways? are ye not deceitful, and deceivers of the people who do thus? ye
are observing days and months, and times, and years: are ye not still carnal?
ye eat and drink, but are ye not still empty and a thirst? ye pray-and fast,
but receive not, for ye ask amiss, to spend it on your lusts; ye observe
days, and diverse watchings, and carnal Ordinances, but are the comers
thereunto made perfect, as pertaining to the conscience? ye cry out, The
Temples of the Lord, the Ordinances of the Lord, the Church of Christ, the
Ordinances of Christ; but which of you is come to witness your bodies to be
the Temple of the Holy Ghost? or that you are made fit Temples for the Spirit
of the Lord to dwell in, or him come to wash you and cleanse you in his own
blood, and so to present you without spot to ^od, even his Father: or which of
you is come to witness the Church of the First born, which is in God the
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Pillar and ground of truth; but on the
contrary, ye profess, teach and say, none can, or must, or shall be set free
from sin here, and so endeavor to preserve your bodies, temples for the devil,
and not Christ, (whilst here) for Christ's Temple is holy, and ye say, none
must or can be set free from sin, and so seek to keep people unholie, and their
bodies Temples of sin; this Doctrine pleases the devil well, and he loves you
for it and will let you profess (to serve God in Gods way) and profess Christ's
Church, say you are Christ's Ministers, so he may but keep you to be his
Temples, and Church, and Ministers still, and thrust Christ out of rule and
dominion; for he that commits sin is of the devil, and his servants ye are, to
whom ye yield your members servants to obey, whether of sin unto death, or of
obedience unto life; O foolish, and exceedingly blinded and besotted men, that
will not see this, and yet profess the Scriptures, and where he is thus come
and witnessed, who changes Ordinances and Laws, and watchings, and
observations of days, and times, and months, and years, and Sabbaths, and
dippings, and sprinklings; do ye not all rise up against him with one accord,
away with him, he is not worthy to live, to prison with him, we have a Law.
Consider seriously, is it not so with you as with them of the same generation
of old? to the light in all your consciences I speak: Do ye think a profession
of these things, and a boasting of these things, will serve your turns any more
then it did your Forefathers of old, from whom God was departed and removed,
who became persecutors of the life of his Son in his Saints? are ye not found
in the steps of those evil husbandmen, who say, behold the heir, let us kill
him, and the inheritance shall be ours? and are ye so blind and bewitched by
the god of this world, to think, that ye shall escape their punishment? will
ye still preach and profess their words, who witnessed Christ within the end
of the Law, the carnal Ordinances, the observations, the Sabbaths and beggarly
rudiments of the world, and cause the Cross of Christ to cease, through your
traditions? will ye still be found thus fighters against God in his Saints;
who now vvitness forth the same, and cannot submit unto those things which
he has redeemed and purchased them out of, even with his own precious blood,
and are made to vvitness against them, and your idol Worshipps, and cry, you
have a Law; will your Law think you excuse you in his sight, who sees you,
your ways, and actions against him and his; nay, nay, deceive not your selves
God will not be mocked, for such as you sow, such shall you reap; if ye sow to
the flesh, think ye, shall ye not of the flesh reap corruption; but if ye sow
to the spirit, of the spirit reap life everlasting. Seriously sit down, and
weigh, and consider, is pride, vanity, lust of the flesh, idleness fullness of
bread, lying, swearing drunkenness, covetousness, deceit, backbiting,
emulation, strife, quarrelling, fighting, reviling, slandering, evil speaking,
whispering, halling out of Synagogues, or Steeple Houses, mocking, stocking,
imprisoning, cruel and evil entreating, fruits of the Spirit? or did ever such
as witnessed the Spirit of God bring forth such fruits? nay, nay, who witnessed
the Spirit of Christ, never were found in such practices; search and see in the
Scriptures, in which ye think to find eternal life, where ever any of the
Saints of Christ (who were possessors, and not professors) brought forth such
fruits; and can ye think, or are ye so far blinded by the devil, to believe ye
shall be saved by professing their words, and enemies to their life, and led
and guided by another spirit, then that which they witnessed to be guided and
led by; or dare ye say, that the Spirit of Christ is changed now from what it
was then, as some of ye do, if not all, that Revelation is ceased now, and that
none must expect Revelation now, and so are deniers your selves of the
Scriptures ye profess: Nay, nay, it will not serve your turns, ye cannot
deceive the Lord, though ye have long deceived men; with the light ye are seen
and comprehended, and the Tree judged of by his fruits: Is it the Spirit of the
Lord that leads you into those things? what means your pride and vanity in
apparel, your excess in eating and drinking, and rioting, and sporting in the
day time, your chambering and wantonness, your idle talk and foolish jesting,
and laughter, which is madness and folly, your lying one to another, and
deceit, and overreaching one another in your dealings and commerce, and
Merchandise one with another, and fighting, and quarrelling, and going to Law,
and swearing: O ye priests, professors, and people, are these the fruits of
Christ's Spirit? or did ever any who were so guided, act thus; and except ye
come to be guided by his Spirit, O ye professors of the Scriptures, ye are none
of his, profess what ye will; for whosoever has not the Spirit of Christ, the
same is none of his; and know ye not that Christ Jesus is in you, except ye be
reprobates; and they that are Christ's, have crucified the flesh with the
affections and lusts: Are ye so sottishlie blinded by the God of this world, to
believe and imagine that ye are Christ's, who are in the lust of the flesh, the
lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, fashioning your selves according to
the vanities of your minds, after the conversation of this world, after the
deceiveable lusts, fulfilling the desires of the will and of the mind, being
children of wrath, and yet imagine your selves children of God: Did ever any of
the Saints do thus, or take the children of Gods words to profess and cover
over themselves withal, whose adorning was not after the fashions of the world,
in the outward adorning as of plaiting and powdering the hair, of gold and
silver, and costly Array, but their adorning was in the hidden man of the
heart, even a meek and quiet spirit, which in the sight of God is of great
price; and are you so blind to think these words will cover you, who are found
contrary to their life? or do you think that the holy women's of old, their
moderate decent attire mixed with gravitie, sobriety, and chastity, and a
quiet spirit, such as accompanies holiness of life and conversation, will be a
fit cover to cover over your excess, and pride, and knots and spots, and toys,
and baubles, and fashions, and vails and neck-laces, and gorgets, and whisks,
and cuffs up to the elbowes, and crispings, and powderings, and rings, and
bracelets, and points, and lace, and ribbons, and tops about men's legs, to make
them straddle, with other evil behavior of bowing and cringing the body, and
idle and vain-lying complements, as you call them, of your servant Sir, or
Madam, or forsooth, when often there is evil in their hearts one against another,
and often laughing, and scoffing and cursing, and wishing evil one of another
behind their backs; or it may be, as soon as they are past each other, plot one
another mischief, or raising evil reports one of another: Is this according to
godliness? laughter, and lightness, and idle jesting and sporting, and minceing
and tinkling with your feet, and dancing and curching, and bowing the body
each to other, like Stage Players, with lightness of behavior, and unchaste
looks and actions? Is this according to holiness of life and conversation;
which the holy women of old lived in? to the light in all your consciences I
speak, which will let you see, that many of you are farther off from God, then
you were many years ago, when it may be ye made not so large a show of
profession as now, and are ye not then hypocrites, hypt above that which then
convinced you of the evil of it, and of them that walked in such things, and so
become worse, instead of witnessing a growth in grace, which the Saints of old
did? and are not these things to be found amongst you, O ye priests,
professors, and people? and do ye think still to cover over your selves with
the good words, who are out of the good life and manners; for if any come to
you who are guided by the good manners, Christ's manners, which is without
respect to persons, and speak thee or thou, the Scripture language, to any
single person whatsoever; are ye not ready to deride them, or thrust them out
of doors, if not worse, or say its filthy language, and methinks ye may have
better manners; or if a man come to speak to some of you with his hat on, and
not doff it, because he dare not act contrary to Christ's manners, nor follow
the vain customs of the world? are ye not ready to deride him, or strike him,
or cast him into prison and say he may lie there till he learn better manners;
and so ye manifest your selves to be enemies to Christ and his manners, and
teachings, and faith, which is without respect to persons, and account it too
low and mean a breeding and behavior for your great worships, who are big
swollen with pride and envy, even ready to burst again, and in your faces
plainly show whose image you bear, and whose mark; Will the Scriptures ye
profess, think you, cover you, who are found in these or such like practices,
vain men and women to be thus miserably deceived and deluded by the devil, to
say pride is not in the apparel, or in outward things, pride is in the heart;
and so it is plainly seen, the day has declared it, even out of thy own mouth
found a witness against thy self, for if it were not, then what means all this,
and much more vanity in thy life, which might be declared and spoken of, enough
almost to defile a chaft mind to write it, and yet if any be sent to declare
the truth to you as it is in Jesus, against your excess and vanity; are ye not
ready to cry out one to another, take heed of being bewitched, or of being
deceived; can any be greater deceived and bewitched by the devil, the old
Serpent, then you are already who are found in such practices. And thus the
devil would fain keep you still his subjects unto sin, lust, and vanities of
the world, by bidding of you take heed of being deceived and deluded, lest he
should lose a member and subject of his Kingdom, but your folly and his
subtilty must be made manifest, it can no longer be hid, for he is come and
witnessed, who makes all things manifest, even your hidden works of darkness,
which are acted by you in secret, are now brought to light, even your
chambering and wantonness; where no eye of man sees, there are your skirts
uncovered, O Sodom and Egypt, where our Lord lies crucified, and that which is
done in secret, is now come to be preached upon the house-tops; therefore in
vain do ye hide your selves, under a profession of the Saints words; fair
fig leaves, but underneath a Serpent; your coverings rent, it will no longer
hide you, the bed is too short to stretch your selves upon, and your covering
is grown too narrow to any longer hide you, your shame and nakedness appears:
And how think ye, can ye ever come to know the covering of his Spirit, who will
not own, nor believe in that which convinces of sin, but say it is not
sufficient to lead, and guide unto salvation? Do ye think a profession of their
words will do it, who did own it, and were led and guided by it, who witnessed
salvation by it, will this save you, who are not led and guided by it, but make
slight of it, even of that which was their leader and conducter into the New
Jerusalem, the City of the living God, which is come down from God out of
Heaven, and yet professes their words, who did believe and were witnesses of
it? O ye foolish and slow of heart to believe all that the Prophets have
written, and that the Apostles witnessed unto, and yet think to profess their
words will save you, who are not in their life? Think you my servants of old
were saved after this manner, by professing my Saints and Servants words, who
went before them into the land of Rest? Think ye Moses, who was a faithful
servant in my house, was saved without Abraham's Faith, which justified him by
Works, who was many hundred years before him? Whom think ye was the Patriark
Abraham saved by, who was many hundreds of years before Moses Writings, who saw
my day, says Christ, and rejoiced, was he think ye saved by ritings? Who
showed Adam his transgression, when he would have hid himself, and run away to
hide his nakedness, knowing that he had sinned; was it not he of whom Moses
declares, saying, A Prophet shall the Lord your God, raise up unto you, of your
Brethern like unto me, him shall ye hear, who though he were dead, yet
speaks? By whom think ye were the Patriarks told there was Corn in Egypt
(who had sold Joseph thither) to preserve them alive in Famine? Was it not by
him of whom Moses declares? By whom did Joseph make mention of the Removing of
his bones, when as he was yet in Egypt, long before their departure? By whom
did Jacob bless, both the sons of Joseph, leaning on the top of his staff? All
these obtained a good report through Faith; having not received the Promise;
who being dead, yet speaks? Whom think ye that my servant Joshua (called
Jesus) was saved by, was it by Moses Writings? Or by Faith in him whom Moses
declared should come, by which he entered the good land? What should I speak of
Jeptha, and David, and Sampson, and Gideon, and many others, who through Faith
removed Mountains, stopped the mouths of Lions, quenched the violence of fire,
fought many battles, overcome great Nations, slew mighty Giants, Ogg King of
Bashan, and Doeg King of the Amorites, and Tidal King of Nations, and Tartan,
Pull, and Lud, who bent the bow? By whom think ye was Abraham strengthened when
he rescued the spoils of the men of the East out of the hands of their enemies,
when Melchisedeck met him, who was without beginning of days, or end of life,
whose Father and Mother none knew, neither had they a name in the earth, unto
whom the Patriarch Abraham gave the Tenth of the spoils that he had taken; who
blessed him who had the Promise, and without doubt the lesser was blessed of
the greater, who was the figure of him who was to come? And do ye think, O ye
Priests, People, Professors, and Inhabitants of the World, that a making of
Profession of these words will save you, who know not him who was to come, nor
will not believe in the light from whence the words were declared forth, who
was the Oath and Promise unto Abraham, when as he was yet uncircumcised, who is
the Father of all who believe in the Oath, who said, Of the fruit of thy Loins
shall he come, in whom all the Nations of the Earth shall be blessed, even by
turning away the Curse for sin, and saving his People from their sin, in whose
Seed all the Nations of the Earth shall be blessed, and again, in blessing, I
will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thee, and thou shall be the
Father of many Nations, and as the stars of heaven, so shall thy Seed be; you
who are professing these words, do ye know the Seed here spoken of, which shall
be as the stars of heaven for multitude, unto which the Promise is, not unto
seeds as many, but unto thy seed, which is Christ, in the Male, and in the
Female, of which Moses in the Spirit testifies? Or how can ye ever come to
this knowledge who deny the light which lights every man that comes into
the World; and so the seed of God ye are strangers and enemies to, who deny
the light to be sufficient to lead unto salvation, all who believe in it, and
walk up to it, and yet profess their words who witnessed salvation by it,
and take their sayings; the holy men of Gods Words which they spoke and vvrote
from the Word that dwelled in them, and was with them, and call them the Word
of the Lord (saying, Hearken to the Word of the Lord) who never knevv his
Word, nor had seen his shape at any time, but are enemies to his Word, and to
those who professes his Word abiding in them, and they in it; and so are such
found to be who have not his Word abiding in you, who call that his Word which
were Writings from his Word, which they who knew the Word, no where did: And so
his Word you are ignorant of, and his life haters of, and despisers of, who
have his words to make a profession of; I wonder how ye should be still thus
ignorantly blindfold as not to see this, when as his so plainly declared of to
you: Do ye not wilfully stop your ears and blind your eyes, O ye priests,
professors and people, that ye will not see this? or do ye think or imagine to
be saved by a Profession without the life and power? or are ye resolved on it
that ye will not be saved, and say still, He Is not sufficient? Will ye profess
to be lovers of God, and Christ, and the spirit, and yet say, He Is not
sufficient, and be haters of them who are so, who are followers of that which
is good, and do witness he is sufficient? Is this to love God, and Christ, and
the Spirit, as ye profess who are haters of the Brethren? Can such a profession
save you? Does the Scriptures ye profess witness forth such a salvation as
this? Or do ye think there is another salvation then what they witness to, which
is the light of the World, Christ Jesus? And can you think to be saved by him,
who will not be led and guided by him? Or does he lead any into sin? You who
profess him yet say, ye shall never be set free from sin here: Are ye guided by
Christ? To the light in all your consciences I speak, which will let you see
who is your Leader and Guide into sin and imperfection, even the man of sin, and
son of perdition, whom Christ is come and made manifest to destroy: And do ye
profess he is come, and it say sin shall not be destroyed, nor none can or shall
be set free from it here? What a profession is this! and what a belief is this!
it even pitties me to see that men should be thus miserably deceived by Christ's
Enemy, and the Enemy of your souls, to be thus deluded; and yet if any one be
moved of the Lord to declare it unto you in love to your souls, cry out one to
another, Take heed of delusion, it is a spirit of delusion which is gone forth
into the world, which the Apostles said should come in the last days, which
privily should bring in damnable errors, even denying the Lord that bought
them: Are ye not there who are led into sin, and say you shall not be free? And
is it not the Devil that tells you this, who is afraid his Kingdom should be
destroyed which is sin in you? What think you? is it not so? and are we not
accounted your Enemies for thus telling you the truth, O ye priests,
professors, and people, and O all ye Inhabitants of the Earth? And do ye not
now plainly perceive how he have been thus long deluded by the Devil and his
Instruments, to deny the light which lets you see this? And will you still
love to have it so? Oh! What will ye do in the end hereof? think ye to be saved
in your sin, seeing ye will not come to him, nor own him, to be saved by him
who sets free? Do ye not love your sin better then him, and it profess to love
him, when in words ye deny him, and so are unto every good Work reprobate?
for such as are come to the good Work, are come to him who was before the evil
Work was; but who are in the evil Work, are not, and so are not in him who
works the good Work, but in him who works the evil, and yet think to be saved
by professing the words of him who works all our Works in us, and for us; for
this is he of whom we are Witnesses, even the Righteousness of God, by which
we are saved and set free from our sin; and this not of our selves, it is the
gift of God, not of Works, lest any should boast, for we are the Workmanship of
God, created in Christ Jesus unto good Works, that we should grow and increase
in them. And is this your Savior who profess and say ye shall never be set
free from sin here? Or are ye not setting up a Savior of your own making,
after your own hearts lust, (which ye love and worship more then Christ) which
is not of Gods appointment, and it talk and profess of worshipping the Lord
after his own appointment, whilst ye are serving of him (by your own
confession) who is not sufficient to set free from sin here? And so the true
Christ and God ye are ignorant on, who saves his people from sin, whom we
witness: And are ye not fighting among your selves in words (almost blood to
Knees) for your God, (and the manner of his Service and Worship, and yet all
joined together against the true Worshippers) who has not saved you from sin,
nor never will, and so not from Wrath to come? Who would take part with such a
God, and fight for such a God, or serve such a God, and Christ, and Gospel, if
they were not ignorantly zealous, and blind? And how can ye be otherwise who
deny the true light which lights every one that comes into the world, to be
sufficient? Is it not just with God ye should be blind still who will not own
his light wherewith he has enlightened you, but are Enemies to it and haters of
it, (calling it natural) and persecutors, and opposers of them that witness it,
and believe in it, and are guided by it, and account them not worthy to live
in the World; who are not of the World, but such as he has chosen out of the
World? And yet, will ye not yet see whose steps ye are in? Search the
Scriptures, and see, are they not plain enough? (to the light in you I speak)
Or will ye still be hireing of a man to give you the meaning? Did they who
spoke and writ that which ye profess, speak one thing, and mean another? Will
ye be such blasphemers against the Spirit of Truth, the Holy Ghost? Know ye
not their portion? search the Scriptures, and see. Or will ye still follow
their meanings rather then it, who are saying, The Scriptures were spoken in
other Tongues, and none can understand them but such as know and understand the
Tongues, Hebrew, Greek, and Latin, which the builders of Babel call the
original? Are not such blasphemers who call Letters and Syllables the
Original, and say none can understand the Scripture but such? Are they not
ignorant of the Original who say so? And will ye still believe and follovv
their meanings and opinions who are out of the Original, and enemies to the
Original? Had not the Jews and Pilate their Original? And were they not
persecutors and murderers of Christ Jesus our Original? Search the Scriptures,
and see. And are there none such to be found amongst you, O ye Priests,
Professors and People? to the Light in all your consciences I speak: If there
be, Will ye still be followers of them? Is this to be followers of God as
dear children, or not followers of them that do evil, from whom the Apostle
bids turn away? And can ye be such lovers of the Apostles Words, (as ye
profess) who will not take his advice (who vvalked in the Grace of God
which he had received, and it was sufficient for him, as the other Saints
did, and witnessed they needed not another Teacher to teach them, but as the
same Anointing which was in them, taught them, which was truth, and in it
was no lie?) Or are ye not rather hypocrites, and haters of the Apostles, and
their words too, though in show ye profess them, calling them Blessed S.
Paul; and Holy St. Peter, and the Evangelical Prophet, and the Holy and Blessed
Evangelists and Blessed St. Stephen that holy Martyr, whose words ye profess,
but cannot abide his Doctrine, because he witnessed against Temples made with
hands, as by your works ye plainly show, for the Tree is to be known and
judged of by its fruits, and that is according to what ye profess? Search and
see, is it not so? Will their Words, think ye, bear ye out any longer to
profess, who hate their Works, and scoff at their Worker, saying, Where was
the Light, I pray, when Paul persecuted the Church of God? Why, even where
yours is, hid under a Bed, or under a Bushel, or under an ignorant blind zeal,
being brought up at the feet of some great Gamaliel, or Doctor, or Expounder
(or Meaning, or Conceiving-giver) of the Scriptures, as Paul then was, who
are found in his steps, and yet querying; Where was the light? I pray ye, blind
Zealots, Think ye it is only to be found or had from Oxford and Cambridge? and
from St. John's College, and not in St. John? Or was he learned it at any such
place, and not by the revelation of Jesus Christ? search the Scriptures and
see. And what was the end (I pray) of your Ministers being it sent to your
Universities, and the design of their Parents in it? Was it the same that
Christ taught and instructed, and designed, and set apart this for? Or was it
not that they might get a livelihood, and good maintenance and preferment (as
you call it) in the World? Was this Christ and his Ministers end? And after
they have been trained up, or educated (as you call it) for some years at the
Craft, and become proficients in it, are they not from thence sent forth,
having commenc't Mr. of the Science, and able to handle their Weapons well in
the defense of their Mother, Mystery Babylon; and afterward being tried by
some able, aged, and more experienced Arts-man, who had long worn his
Philactery (and found expert) is ordained, and sent forth to some certain
place, or Parish, with an Order from man, to enter and creep into a Stone-House
there to lead silly Women captive, laden with their sins, and led about with
diverse lusts, ever learning under them, but never able to come to the knowledge
of the truth; and how should they, when (with a strong Law that none must come
there to declare it under penalty of a House of Correction, or a Parison as a
disturber) it is not their Teachers guide nor end, but two, three, or four, or
five hundred pounds a year, which was in their eye? And was it so in the
Ministers of Christ? search the Scriptures, and see; Was it so? Or does their
Rule (as they call it) teach them to sprinkle Water on a child's face, and call
it baptism, or an Ordinance of Christ; or to call Bread and Wine a Sacrament,
do not such make void the Ordinance of Christ through their traditions? What
pattern have they from Christ, or any of his Ministers, for these things, or
for their Pulpit, as it is called, their long Robes, their walking before the
dead, their words over the dead, their Knells, their Bells, their money for
Buryings and Christenings; their selling Funeral Sermons; their Chancel-money,
their Pulpitmoney, with many other knacks and toys, and pedlary Wares which
they take money for, and call their dues, besides Sweetmeats and Wines for
their Bellies; are these Ordinances of Christ too? No, But these are (say they)
for decency and uniformity: Did not your forefathers say so, who sought under
those Names to usher in popery and idolatry? And who gave ye orders for these
and such like practices? Received ye them from Christ, or from your Rule?
search and see: Or not from your forefathers the Bishops, who taught you to
pray and preach by the hour, and to call upon those for money, who will buy
none of your Merchandise? Are not these covetous practices? And must you not
have your Clark, and Sexstone, and Dog-Whipper too, to attend for decency and
uniformitie? Who taught you it? Were there ever such helpers in the Ministry
of the Gospel? Yet these must have their pay too, from such as require none of
their labor, for uniformitie sake: Does your Rule you pretend to, teach you
such practices; search and see; or does it not rather condemn your
burthensomness: Do you think calling your great Stone-houses by the Saints
Names, is any honor to them; or that ye shall have their benediction for it,
who are Enemies to their Doctrine, practice, manner of life and conversation,
who were called and chosen to the Work of their Ministry, not by the will of
man, nor sent forth into the World in man's will and time, but by the
revelation of Jesus Christ, contrary to man's Will, whose revelation ye deny,
and cannot own nor receive, but say that is ceased, and so are deniers of
Scriptures, and yet would be accounted Christ's Ministers, Gospel Ministers,
Gospel-professors; What Gospel is it you Minister and profess who deny
Revelation, and the Letter also which witnesses to it; and professes that, and
preach that which the Scriptures no where speaks, namely, That Revelation is
ceased; Who revealed that to you, you that deny Christ's revelation; Must it
not needs be his enemy Antichrist: and whose Ministers then are ye who say
that none must expect or wait for revelation now, and that such who do, are a
sort of giddie-brain'd fellows and Apostates, and such as these upstart
Quakers, who profess this newfound light, who are contrary to all men's
opinions and judgments of the Scriptures but their own; and was not truth ever
so, ye blind, leaders of the blind: Is truth to be accounted of according to
men's judgments or opinions of it, or as it is in it self infallible, which
word I know you cannot endure to hear, who are in that which is fallible; and
so measuring truth by a lie, and calling Jesus Beelzebub, and God the Devil,
and Christ a Seducer, and his Ministers Deluders and Deceivers, and
giddie-brain'd fellows, and upstarts, and bringers in of damnable errors, and
such like, raked up out of the pit of your fathers habitations, the Prince of
darkness, who is, and ever was a hater of the light in his children in all
ages; search the Scripture else, and see; and do ye not see your selves in
their steps yet, let the light in you be judge; and will the words think ye
cover you; nay, nay, the words are the words of truth, and shall join with the
light, a witness against you, even to your eternal condemnation, who are found
in life, conversation, doctrine, and practice, contrary to them, and this shall
you witness eternally, who disowns the light, to be guided by it, which leads
into the life of the Scriptures from which they were spoken forth, which was
before the Scriptures were spoken, even before Babel and her Builders, into the
one Language and this according to my measure am I a Witness of, as ever he
was (who am hated, persecuted, and despitefullie used by your generation) who
came to fulfill the Scriptures, for he came not to destroy them, but to fulfill
them; and what do ye witness of them fulfilled in you, who profess and say he
is come, yet are deniers of his light; which way is he come unto you, seeing
you deny that he enlighteneth every one that comes into the World; and he
says he does enlighten every one, and ye say he does not; Who taught ye to
say so; does he, or the god of the World; and what is it lets you see this and
your other confusion, who say ye are enlightened, but not all; and that there is
a common and a special light, a natural and a spiritual light in man;
distinguish them asunder, that we may know them one from another, seeing the
Scriptures ye profess speaks but of one true light, which lights every one
that comes into the World, which is uncreated; if by your natural light you
mean the Sun, Moon, and Stars, and other borrowed Lights, and created, we agree
in that; but are they in man; but if there be two Lights in man, separate them
one from another, that we may know them, or else we may freely conclude,
(according to the Scripture) That the light which is in you is darkness: and
how great is that darkness which has overspread the whole World since the
Apostles days, which is got so high; even into the Seat of God, exalting
himself above God, and boasts himself as if he were God, by making two Lights
in man when God made but one, and the Scriptures witness to but one true
light, and yet he will have two, but knows not how to separate them one from
another; but he who dwells in the light does, and knows his to be darkness,
and to ascend out of the pit of darkness and confusion, unto which he must be
sent again, even by him who is the Father of Light, even of our Lord Jesus
Christ, God blessed for ever; the God of truth, in whom there is no lie, but
bears witness against the Lie, and the Frogs, and the Locusts, and the
Caterpillars, which are ascended out of the bottomless pit, and have
overspread the Nations of the whole earth, even all Egypt, but they must be all
whipped away with the Rod of Moses, and sent into the pit out of which they
ascended, never to infect the Nations any longer; for he is come, and coming,
whose Fan is in his hand, who will thoroughly purge his Flour, and gather his
Wheat into his Garner, but the Chaff will he consume and burn up with fire
unquenchable; for his fire is kindled in the earth, which shall consume, and
none shall be able to hinder it, till he has consumed the wicked from off the
face of the whole Earth; King and Peasant, who will not that he should reign,
Tophet is prepared for them of old, and the glory of all earthly Diadems shall
enter into it; for thus has the Lord decreed, and who shall be able to hinder
him, or say, Why do thou so; Wherefore, O all ye Kindreds of the Earth, high
and low, rich or poor, Kings, Nobles, Priests, Professors and Peasants, tremble
at the Word of the Lord, for it is gone forth, and shall not return empty, but
shall accomplish the end unto which he has sent it; a fire is gone before him,
and it shall be very tempestuous round about him, which shall consume all his
Enemies, till they have left unto them neither root nor branch in the earth,
and til the wicked be no more, nor the place thereof know them no more.

O ye Priests, Professors of the Scriptures, and People, are you not glorying
and boasting after the flesh in Names (and things without) in saying ye are
Christians, and to you is committed the Scriptures, and the Ordinances, the
Baptism, (dipping and sprinkling) and Sacraments, which the Scriptures no where
calls so; and yet are naming your days and Months after the customs of the
Heathens that knows not me, says the Lord. Search the Scriptures and see; Did
ever any true Christians, my Saints and Servants, so do; Did Paul, or Peter, or
James, or John, or Matthew, or Mark, or Luke, (whose Words ye profess) do so;
What, do ye excel the Pope of Rome in these things; Does not he (think ye)
glory in the same, and in many more Names, and Saints days, and carnal things,
then ye profess; And were not the Jews (your forefathers) glorying in such like
things, Are not we Abraham's Seed; And to us is committed the Oracles of God;
and yet were Enemies to me, and persecutors and despisers of my life in my
Saints for all this; And do not ye excel and outstrip them in this also: Did
they make Laws that I should not speak publikelie amongst them; Or did they not
fasten their eyes on the Saints, and say, Brethren, if any one have a Word of
Exhortation for the people, let them speak on: Do ye do so; O ye Professors of
these words; Or do ye not exceed many of them in cruelty in this particular;
For if I send any unto you in my Name, do ye not lay violent hands on them,
and thrust them forth, and hale them before Magistrates, and to Stocks, and to
Prison with them, we have a Law; though ye have and profess my Words, which
say, He that receives you, and hears your words, receives me; and he that
receives me, receives him that sent me; And can ye think ever to receive me
or my Father, who will not hear their testimony who come in my Name; but if any
come to you (or are sent to you by others) in his own Name, him ye are ready
to hear and receive, though he tell you Revelation is ceased, and so neither
knows me, nor my Father which sent me, as my Words in the Scripture testify, O
ye professors and people. And do ye not cry out, An Orthodox man, a learned
man, a great Scholar, a man of excellent parts and gifts, preaches sound
Doctrine, a gallant Gentleman, Mr. such a one, a man of great gifts, certainly
he prays and preaches by the spirit, yet says revelation is ceast; What spirit
is it (think ye) he preaches and prays by, who knows not the Son, For none
knows the Father save the Son, and he to whom the Son reveals him; Do ye think
its the spirit of my Father that prays and preaches in him that knows not the
Son nor the Father, but says Revelation is ceast; it is ceast to him indeed,
because he is a hater of the light, and loves the darkness rather then the
light, because his deeds are evil: And do ye think his works are not in the
darkness, whom it is even a torment to, to hear of the light, and he had rather
see, or speak with the Devil, then to see, or speak with one who owns the
light, and walks in the light, and so has fellowship with God; but whom think
ye his fellowship's with who loves not the light, but is a hater of the light;
Must not his fellowship needs be with the devil, who is the Prince and Ruler of
the Darkness of this World, even the spiritual Wickedness got into high
places, sitting as God in the Temple of God, exalting himself even above all
that is called God, and would be worshipped as God; And think ye this spirit is
no where to be found but at Rome, O ye Priests, Professors and People; Is it
not to be found amongst your selves; To the Light in all your consciences I
speak: What means the Fines and close imprisonments of such who dare not
swear, and so break my commands for conscience sake, and who dare not bow to,
nor worship man for conscience sake? Are these things only to be found at
Rome, and Italy, and Spain, and France; who are called Christians as well as
ye, (I, and boast in it too) and not in England also, where liberty of
conscience is professed, even amongst you? O ye great and tall Professors of the
Scritures! Do you think the Scriptures will cover you any more then they? or
that your Faith, and Gospel, and Christ is better then theirs, who are
respecting one another persons? Will that Faith save ye any more then theirs?
Search the Scriptures, and see. Does the change of the Air, or of the Climate,
or of the Names, or of the Languages, or of the places, or of the profession of
God, and Christ, and the Scriptures, after another form or likeness then
theirs, (for they have the Names, Christian, and God, and Christ, and the
Scriptures, as well as ye, and a form of godliness in some things as near the
Letter as ye) change the nature, or beget a saving-faith which is that which
purifies the heart, and sets free from sin? Or are ye not in your sin as well
as they, and say ye shall not be free here? Only herein they outstrip ye in
profession, for they profess a Purgatory after this life, through which they
must pass, and be cleansed and purified; for they know that no unclean thing
must enter into Heaven, and ye think to enter in with your sins; for here ye
say you shall never be set free, and so are deniers of the Scriptures in that
particular, more then they; for you will not come to me (says Christ the
light) that you may have life: Do ye think that the profession of the
Scriptures will save you any more then them? Or is the Scriptures me? Were the
Scriptures crucified at Jerusalem, or slain since the foundation of the World?
Or do ye think that Letters and Syllables joined together in words, as God, and
Jesus, will save from sin? Or is that the blood which was shed without the
City, which only cleanses from sin, and purges from all unrighteousness? Or
is that to be found in things without? Will the blood of Bulls, or Goats, or
the ashes of a Heifer, think ye, cleanse from sin? If they would, what needed
he have come and been offered up, and shed his blood at Jerusalem, who came to
fulfill the Law, and the Prophets, and the Passover, and the Circumcision, and
the diverse washings, and carnal Ordinances, which could not make the comers
thereto perfect, as pertaining to the conscience? And do ye think that Bread,
and Wine, and Water, which are carnal things, which you call Sacraments, (who
taught you that Word? had you it by Revelation? for the Scripture no where
has it) will do it now? why then the Pope of Rome, and they of Italy, Spain,
and France, have more of them then ye, yet they you say are Antichrist, and
none of the Saints, and Church, and people of God, and we say so too. Or is the
manner or form of eating, and drinking, or dipping, or sprinkling, that alters
the nature, and makes it more saving to one, then to another? for it is only in
that ye differ; for they have the same, and more then ye, and circumstances by
your own Doctrine, alters not, where the ground and foundation is one; for
circumstances does not save according to your own Opinions, nor change the
ground; Why then do you exclude them from being a Church of Christ more then
your selves; who profess more of the carnal Ordinances then ye, and profess
the same Scriptures, the same Faith, the same God, the same Christ, and the
same Sacraments? and where is the difference but in the circumstances? And it
you say they are not a Church of Christ, and profess that you your selves are;
and it say circumstances does not save, if the ground and foundation be one;
What confusion is here! Are you not all in Babylon? Are not Mother and
Daughter both Harlots? Is your Bread, and Wine, and Wine, and Water, better,
and holier the theirs? Are they not all carnal? Or is yours more pure and more
saving? Yet neither of them make the Comers thereunto perfect, by your own
confession; is not their Savior then as good as yours, and their Church as
yours, both imperfect? And is the Church of Christ so? Search the Scriptures
and see. Does they say it is? Or does it not say that he washes and cleanses
it in his own blood, and presents it to God his Father without spot or wrinkle,
or any such thing; And do not the Apostles write to the Church which is in
God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ; and dare ye say that is imperfect, as
by your own confession yours is, and it would be accounted a Church of Christ,
and your Teachers, Ministers of Christ; Is Christ imperfect; Are ye not
ministering the carnal; Is Christ carnal; Are ye not ministering the Letter: Is
the Letter the Spirit; Are ye not ministering the Bread and Wine; Is this
Christ; But it may be you will say, You receive it by faith, but is it faith in
Christ; search the Scriptures, and try Has this faith purified your hearts;
If not; it is not Christ's. Has it given you victory over the world; Has it
subdued and crucified the world unto you, and you unto it; Has it saved and
cleansed you from sin, as by your own confession it has not, nor you say, you
believe never will here; and so is not the faith in Christ which the Saints
witnessed; and if not in Christ, not true, nor saving, nor wel-grounded faith,
which you often talk of, but know it not; for the day is come, and approaching,
that your Foundations shall be shaken; the Light comprehends you, your Faith
and Foundation, which is tottering and sandy. Therefore look about you, (ye
that profess believers) and beware, for your image of Faith will not save ye
any more then the Popes Images. What Is that ye worship and pretend to serve;
Do ye know; Is the Scriptures, or men's meanings of them, He; Is Bread and Wine
He; Is the Ordinances He; It Is like you will say, No, but they lead to him: Which
of you have they lead to him; Are ye found out; Is your Ordinances Christ; Does
any lead to God but Christ; Knows any the Father save the Son, and he to whom
the Son will reveal him; Are ye not making a Christ of your Ordinance, and yet
condemn the Pope and his Church to the devil sor believing the bread and wine
is transubstantiated into the Body and Blood of Christ, and that when they eat
it, they eat his flesh, and drink his blood: What difference betwixt their
eating their God, and yours leading to God, and yet saying it is Bread and Wine
still, which is carnal; Does that which is carnal lead to God, whom to know and
be led unto, is life eternal; And has your dead Christ brought you thither,
yea or nay; The Light sees your Christ, and in it are you comprehended, and
your Christ, and with it denied, and your Faith, which does not purify; for
whilst I was under the leading and conduct of it, I came not to the knowledge
of God by it, and so not to eternal life, which is witnessed through faith in
him, and in his blood, which purifies my heart, and gives me dominion over the
world, and that Christ I know, own and witness which saves from sin all that
come unto him; but your Christ is denied, which you say you believe will not
set you free from sin here, and so is not the Christ of God; which is the true
Light which lights every one that comes into the world, who is manifest to
take away sin, and to destroy the works of the Devil, and in him is no sin: And
this Christ I own, and bear witness of, who is the true Light, the Ordinance
of the Father, whom ye hate and destroy, and make void through your traditions;
and deny your Mock-Christ, which you say will not save you from sin here, but
leaves you in the Devils work, which is sin, (by your own confession) and so
your Christ is but transformed in you like unto an Angel of Light, O ye
Professors and People, and your Ministers like unto Ministers of
Righteousness; and so being not the same Christ, but like him, cannot save ye
from sin, and so not from condemnation, but keeps you in it whilst ye are
here, and persuades you that ye cannot be set free; and this Christ ye believe
in: And here is the mystery of iniquity hid, and discovered (even the spiritual
wickedness got into high places) unto all who have an eye to see, and an ear
to hear, and an heart to understand, and will not wilfully blind themselves by
hating knowledge and instruction: And this mystery of iniquity works not
only at Rome, and Italy, and Spain, and France, but in England also, and in
every particular Member of that Church, which is not in God, the Father of our
Lord Jesus Christ, the pillar and ground of Truth, whom to know is life
eternal, which none comes to know, but such who comes down to know and own the
light within them, which is pure, of God, which convinces of sin and
iniquity, and shows evil deeds; that is the Light which lets ye see when ye
tell a lie, when ye swear, or be drunk, or commit any other sin, that ye are
serving the devil, and not God; when ye are fulfilling the lust of the flesh,
the lust of the eye, and the pride of life, that this is not of the Father, but
of the World; and the World passes away, and the lusts thereof, but he that
does the Will of God, the same abides for ever; and this being obeyed, (which
convinces) and sin denied, it leads unto Christ from whence the light comes,
who leads to the Father of Light, with whom there is no variableness, neither
shadow of changing, who of his own good will has he begotten us by the Word of
his Power, unto a livelie hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the
dead, that we should be as the first fruits unto him, having slain the enmity
on the Cross, and broken down the Partition Wall, and has brought in
everlasting Righteousness, even by washing and purging of us in his own blood;
and his flesh we know, which is meat indeed; and his blood, which is drink
indeed; and his covering we know. But the woe from him is unto all such as are
found covered, and covering themselves with a covering, and not of the spirit
of the Lord; for the Lord our God is come, and coming in the Clouds of Heaven,
with the voice of the Arch Angel, and the shout of a great Trump, to call all
who are in the Graves to arise and stand up to judgment, they that have done
well to the resurrection of life, but they that have done evil, to the
resurrection of condemnation; and the day draws nigh a pace, wherein the
Book of conscience must be opened, and every one come to be judged out of the
book of his own conscience for all that ever has been done in the body,
whether it be good or evil, and he that has done good shall go into life
everlasting; but he that has done evil into everlasting fire, prepared for the
devil and his Angels, where shall be weeping, and hovvling, and gnashing of
teeth, where the worm never dies, nor the fire is not quenched, which is
the second death, out of which there is no Redemption; but blessed and holy is
he that has his part in the first Resurrection, over such the second death
shall have no power, but they shall reign Kings and Priests to God even for
ever and ever; even so Lord Jesus, come quickly, Amen.

Written to you from the Lord God, who is Judge of quick and dead, by a lover
of all your souls, that so with the Light of Christ Jesus within, you might
come to a true sight and discovery of your estates and conditions, that so
coming to be sensible of them, you might return to the Lord in your life time,
before you be sealed up in the pit of everlasting darkness; for the day of
sealing is come, and the Bride (the Lambs Wife) has made her self ready, and
is entered into the Bedchamber, And I John saw the Angel flying through the
midst of Heaven, having the Key of the bottomless Pit in his hand, to seal and
shut up all such who are found bearing the mark of the Beast in their
foreheads, and in their right hand, that they may be shut up and sealed for
ever and ever. And this in love is written to go abroad as a warning from the
Lord to all people, professors, and priests every where, but in particular, to
them in Hartford and Ware, that so if possible some of them may come to
repentance, and to an acknowledgment of the truth in their life time, as it is
in Jesus, before it be hid from their eyes, and may serve also for the use of
any who have an eye to see, and an ear to hear: From a lover of all souls,
known to the world by the name of

JOHN GOULD, But has a new Name, and a white Stone, which none knovvs but
he that has it.

THE END.
