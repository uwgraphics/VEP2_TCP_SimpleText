The humble and thankful Acknowledgement and Declaration Of the COUNTY of
SOUTHAMPTON, PRESENTED By the Grand Jury of the said County at the last sitting
of a Commission of Oyer and Terminer, to be presented by the Knights and
Burgesses that serve for that County, To the Right Honorable, The House of
COMMONS in Parliament assembled.
AS we detest with horror the levying of a new War, so we desire from our
hearts the firm Settlement of a lasting Peace, after so many Applications to
the King made by the Parliament, and especially after the last Address, wherein
the Houses (as we humbly conceive) demand nothing, but what is most Essential
to the Safety of the People; And after the Kings absolute Negative to the last
Message of the Honorable Houses, we exceedingly doubt of any Settlement by
further Application to the King; and therefore we do most humbly acknowledge
the wisdom and goodness of the Parliament, in resolving to settle the Peace of
this poor miserable distracted Nation: And by the Blessing of God (as in Duty
we are bound) we shall not only most willingly and cheerfully submit and
acquiesce in such Settlement, as they in their grave judgments shall find to
be most conduceable to our Peace; but also in our several places and callings,
shall heartily endeavor to promote the same.
