The MANIFEST of the County of KENT.
THat the innocence of our intentions, and justice of all our undertakings, may
more clearly appear to all men of incorrupt understandings, and hearts not made
too servile by the long and odious custom of oppression: We the Knights,
Gentlemen, and Franchlins of the County of Kent, the most free people of this
late flourishing Nation; by the wisdom and valor of our Ancestors, delivered
from the Laws of a Conqueror, and to these late days of unhappy confusion and
distraction enjoying the same, through all the Reigns of the most glorious and
victorious Kings and Princes of this Nation: Do hereby declare and manifest to
all the world, That our assembling and meeting together at this time, is no
other then for a vindication of our selves and purposes, from the scandal, and
aspersions of the Committee of this County; who upon occasion of a Petition in
behalf of the County of Kent, assented and subscribed to by the Grand Jurie at
the Sessions of the Judges upon an especial Commission of Oyer and Terminer
executed at the Castle of Canterbury the 11. of May last, for the said County;
have not only made Orders against the same, and commanded them publicly to be
read in all Churches, sentencing and condemning the said Petition and all the
Abettors thereof: and have summoned the Troops of Horse, and forces of Foot of
this County for suppression of the said Petition: which tends not only to the
suppression of the Liberty, even of the most enslaved persons of the world; but
also, as much as in them lies, show an endeavor upon any causes whatsoever,
which suits not with their humors, to overawe the senses of other men, and
upon opposition therein think they have ground enough to take away the lives
and fortunes, or both, of their said opposers.

In consideration of which, and that now the said Committee finding themselves
unable to involve this County in blood, have made their address to the
Parliament, and Army; and make strange and malicious representations of our
purposes, thereby discovering nothing so much as their own pride and malice.
We the said Knights, Gentlemen, and Free-Yeomen of the County of Kent do
herein appeal to all the world to judge, If it were not high time for us to
put our selves into a posture of Defense; and do further declare, that we will
prosecute our said Petition with our lives and fortunes, not doubting of a fair
reception from the two Houses of Parliament; whom we know to have been
instigated against us by the said Committee: And therefore saving to our selves
the enlarging of the said Petition, we have resolved to charge the said
Committee with increasing the Taxes of this County above the due proportions,
and only for maintaining their own private luxury and pride; with usurping a
power over the Estates and fortunes of the Freemen of this County not granted
to them by any power of Parliament; with a tyrannical and embittered spirit
naturally ingrafted in them, and expressed by words and actions, all along the
exercise of this power, (which makes them unfit for rule) to the exasperating
of the peoples hearts into all animosity, and overthrowing of all love and
peace in this County: which also has been followed to that height of
persecution, That had not the two Houses given a stop to their exorbitant
proceedings, we had suffered much more under the torment of these men's
projected designs: wherein we acknowledge our selves also to have been secured
in the temper and moderation of the Houses. We have no more to say or do, but
to defend our selves, till we can have a right understanding of our purposes
and actions before the Houses; In the mean time, we shall look upon all
opposition, as the provocation of a conscious and enraged Committee: and in
respect of the Invasion lately made upon the persons of our neighbors, we
think fit not to lie at the mercy of Soldiers; but to have refuge to our
Arms, from which no threats, or face of Soldiery shall drive us, knowing well
the justice of our cause, and the temper of our own hearts.

FINIS.
