Commissioners for Charitable Uses.
Midd. ss.
WHereas there is a special Commission directed to Us, under the Great-Seal of
England, by his Higness Oliver Lord Protector of England, Scotland, and
Ireland, and the Dominions thereto belonging, for the redressing of the
misimployment and concealing of Lands, Goods and Stocks of Money heretofore
given to Charitable uses, as well by Kings and Queens of England, as by other
well disposed persons. Some for relief of aged impotent and poor people; Some
for maintenance of Sick and maimed Soldiers and Mariners, Schools of Learning,
Free-Schools, and Scholars in Universities; Some for repair of Bridges, Ports,
Havens, Cause-waies, Churches, Sea-banks, and Highways; Some for education
and perferment of Orphans; Some for or toward relief, Stock or maintenance for
houses of Correction; Some for Marriages of poor Maids; Some for supportation,
aid and help of young Tradesmen, Handicrafts-men, and Persons decayed; And
others for relief or redemption of Prisoners or Captives, and for aid or ease
of any poor Inhabitants concerning payment of Fifteens, setting out of
Soldiers and other Taxes: We do therefore in conscience of our duty toward
God and Man, hereby order and declare That if any poor person or persons
whatsoever, under any the qualifications before specified, do or shall find
themselves justly grieved with fraud or violence, in the concealment,
detention, or abuse of any (though never so Rich and great Oppressors) of any
thing that is or shall be due to them, or any of them by the gift, appointment
or assignment of any well disposed persons, and shall make their greivances
appear before us to be real; That they and every of them so grieved, shall
have and receive sufficient remedy in the same both for what has been
formerly concealed or detained, as also for what is at present concealed or
detained from them amongst such cruel oppressors, their heirs, executors and
administrators, if they or any of them have Assets in Law or Equity, with all
possible speed, and without any fear of their Adversaries malicious power or
greatness, either for the present or for time to come; And also that if any
person or persons shall out of a due sense and apprehension of the oppressed
and perishing condition of the Poor, make any just complaint of any
Concealment or detention of any Gift, Appointment, or Assignement of any
Lands, Rents, or Moneys belonging to any Poor by whomsoever, and shall or can
make a clear and full discovery thereof, every such person or persons so doing
shall and may recover the same before us for the use of the said Poor, together
with all the arreares, against any such unjust dealers whomsoever, their
heirs, executors, or administrators, if they or any of them have Assets either
in Law or Equity. And for their further encouragement herein, the said
Discoverers shall have and receive a fourth part of the damages awarded against
such Delinquents to be allowed them, for their charges, care and pains herein;
and we do hereby further will and require all Churchwardens, Overseers of the
poor, and all other Officers authorized by law, to sue for and recover such
rights to such uses, to account for and pay what they have recovered to the use
of any poor concerned therein, And to sue for where none else will or can
prosecute what they have not recovered, being due, upon penalty to pay damages
for their neglect herein, being found guilty thereof by due Inquisition; And
that none may be ignorant how to perform what they would or should do herein,
We do appoint all that are or may be concerned in what is by us required as
aforesaid, to repair to Walter Sheldon Gent, Clerk of the Commission (at his
house at little Queens-street end, in high Holborne, over against the sign of
the George, by the Kings-Gate that leads into Graies-Inn-Fields, in the said
County of Middlesex) who shall and will be ready to receive their
presentiments, and to direct and instruct them at all convenient times. For the
better effecting whereof, we do hereby will and require all and singular the
Ministers of the County of Middlesex, as well within liberties, as without, to
make publication hereof in their several Congregations both in the forenoon
and afternoon of the next Sabbath Day after his or their receipt of the same,
and afterward to cause it to be fixed on the Church-Doors, where it may be
easily seen and read by all people; And that no person or persons whatsoever
presume or attempt either to deface or take it off from thence, upon their
perils, to be proceeded against as contemners of his Highness Authority and
Commission.
