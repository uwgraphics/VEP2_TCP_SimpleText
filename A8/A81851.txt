A WARNING TO THE PARLIAMENT OF ENGLAND.

A Discovery of the ends and designs of the Popish Party both abroad, and at
home, in the raising and fomenting our late War, and still-continuing troubles:
In an ORATION made to the general Assembly of the French Clergy in Paris,

By Monsieur Jaques du Perron Bishop of Angolesme, and Grand Almosner to the
Queen of England.

Translated out of a Manuscript Copy, obtained from a good hand in France, and
now published for the opening their eyes that hate not the Truth, and that
desire to be thankful for such a DISCOVERY.

And for Caution to those, to whom the Divine Providence has entrusted the
transaction of Affairs, that they may most accurately take heed there be a
sound foundation laid, of the so Generally longed-for Peace of the KINGDOM.

Sed si populus iste vult decipi decipiatur.

London Printed for R.W. 1647.

A Discourse made on the behalf of the Queen of England, in the General
Assembly of the Clergy at Paris, concerning the present Affairs of the
Catholic, Religion in the Kingdom of England: By Monsieur Jaques du Perron
Bishop of Angolesme, Grand Almosner to Her Majesty.
IF the King of Great Britain be constrained by the necessity and exigency of
his Affairs, to come to an Accommodation with his Rebelled Subjects, as he
will at last be enforced, and that in a very short time, if He receive not
speedy and effectual succors, That Accommodation will necessarily bring with
it, the total destruction of the Catholic Religion in that Kingdom. For as
the first and principal Pretext, which the Parliamentarians serve themselves
off, to dress and color over their Rebellion withal, and to Animate, Arm,
and Unite all the Subjects together against their Lawful Sovereign, has been,
to make them believe that he was a Catholic, and that he would introduce, and
bring the Catholic Religion into that Kingdom; And as the first Article of all
the Treaties that have been set on foot, and put forward by them hitherto, has
always been, that of the Ruin and Extermination of the Catholics; it is not
to be doubted, they will never conclude any Accord or Agreement with their
Prince, but upon that rigorous Condition, that the little Catholicisme that yet
remains there, should for ever be Banished from thence, and that all the Arms
and Forces of England and Scotland shall be joined together (as they have long
since resolved amongst themselves, and published in Print) to execute this
unhappy and wicked design plainly, that is to Massacre and cut the throats of
all the poor Catholics, as they have already begun to do in diverse places; And
to drown and extinguish for ever in their blood, the Remainders and relics of
Religion, not only in England and Scotland, but also in Ireland, where they
have been almost all preserved in the Orthodox belief, notwithstanding all the
persecutions that have been raised against them for these hundred years last
past.

Now the destruction of Monarchy in England, and the Establishment of a
Republike, and especially of a Puritan Republike, which is the end that the
Parliamentarians aim at, carries with it the greatest prejudice that may be
to the Catholic Religion: for the Extent of it will not be only in England, in
Scotland, or in Ireland, but in all other parts of Christendom. For if this
Popular and Puritan State, shall once be formed in these three great Kingdoms,
and after that shall Unite it self with the Heretics of Germany, Holland, and
France, as is most agreeable to all Maxims of State, Religion, and Interest,
and which to effect, they are especially concerned, and which is a design, which
the Parliamentarians had formed in their minds from the instant of their
Revolt, and of which they now spare not to make a clear and open profession:
All these powers thus United by the Interests of State, and of Religion, the
most strict and sacred bonds of humane society, will render themselves so
formidable to all the rest of Christendom, as they will be able in succession
of time (if God shall not mightily interpose his hand) to undermine, and
utterly to ruin all the Catholics. And this is that which the
Parliamentarians hope to come unto at last, when they shall have rooted up
Monarchy from among themselves, for they hate the Church, yet more then they
hate Royalty. And is it not to be feared, that if the Catholics of other
Countries, shall show themselves so little sensible of the ruin of Religion in
England, and shall not be ready to give their assistance for the maintenance
and preservation of the same, that God by his just judgment should permit that
themselves should fall into the same unhappiness and misery of Schism and
Heresy, from which they have had no heart to preserve and defend their
brethren, and their neighbors? And is it not to be feared that God to punish
our regardlesnes, and loosenes in the things of his service, and of his glory,
and our little zeal for the Augmentation, and Conservation of the Catholic
Religion, should permit the same Catholic Religion to be wholly ruined, and
rooted out of the rest of those Countries, in which it yet continues in
Europe, as in the Ages past, to chastise the sins of those that lived before
us, he has permitted that it should be wholly destroyed, in all Asia, Afric,
and the greatest part of Europe it self, and to transplant it wholly into
America, and that new world, which were the greatest unhappiness that could
befall us; and which we ought to endeavor to hinder by all the means we can,
all the days of our lives?

The King of England has promised by a Letter which he has written to the
Queen his spouse, to revoke and repeal all those Laws which have at any time
been made against the Catholics in England, in case he can receive from the
Catholics any assistance, to put him into a Condition of power and Authority
to be able to do it. There is now no danger to declare this promise, which has
been kept secret hitherto: for that the Parliamentarians having surprised the
Copy of the said Letter, have Printed and published the same, to render the
King the most odious to the People that they can; and to render the Catholics
the most suspects. And were not this now the greatest good that could possible
come to the Catholic Religion? For were not this to give and establish in a
sort, the liberty of Catholic Religion in England? which if it were once
established there, it is most certain that we should shortly see the greatest
part of that Country reunited to the Church: for there are now already a
fourth part, yea, even near a third part, who are Catholics, either secret or
open; There is one other third part, who are held in Schism, only from the
apprehension of temporal punishment, and the loss of their goods, and by the
fear of the Laws, which being once revoked, as the King of England promises
now they shall, in case he can be assisted, they would also presently embrace
the Catholic faith. And who can tell whether the divine providence has not
permitted that the King of England should fall into those difficulties, and
extremities, into which he is now reduced, to the end, that being pressed by
the necessity and exigency of his Affairs, he might take this good resolution,
which God no doubt has inspired him with for the advantage of his Church? And
who knows whether when this King has been so seasonably and sensibly engaged
and obliged by the Catholics, God may not take that occasion to touch his
heart, and open his eyes to the light of the faith?

The second consideration, which ought to carry you more effectually, and
particularly to this assistance beyond the rest of the Church, is your
particular interest, that is to say, the danger in which you are, in regard of
your vicinity to England, as being nearer then any other Catholic kingdom; so
as when Heresy shall have ruined Religion in England, it may with greatest
speed, pass over to destroy it also in France.

Res tua tunc agitur, paries cum proximus ardet. For we know of certain
knowledge, that this is the design and scope of the Parliamentarians; and that
this is all the hope and the only refuge of the Huguenots; upon this hope it
is, that they travel with so great diligence and vehemence, to help forward,
and to publish the advantages of the Parliamentarians; It Is upon this hope they
Contribute so great sums That the Reader be not mistaken in this particular, he
is to take notice, that the Orator uses this as an Argument, to provoke the
French Clergy to a full contribution to the Queen in Emulation of the
Huguenots; wherein he imposes upon them, there never having been so much as
one penny ever leavied by them, or sent into England, for the use of the
Parliament.
which they leavy upon themselves, and secretly convey into England. And truly
this their hope perhaps is not so vain nor ill grounded, as some may be ready
to imagine: for if the Huguenots at their first birth, and when they began to
appear in this Kingdom, being only upheld by the protection of some petty
Heretical Princes of Germany, made themselves in short time so considerable,
as they were able to set on foot at diverse times such Prodigious Armies, to
give an hundred and an hundred encounters with our forces, to gain many
signal Victories, to take a great number of the best Towns of this Kingdom,
to keep whole Provinces entire, and to ruin and destroy wherever they came the
Catholic Religion, of which we see yet, the lamentable marks and scars in all
parts of this Kingdom, but principally in the Dioceses of Guienne and
Languedoc; what will it be, when beside the succors of the Heretics of
Germany (who are now incomparably more powerful then they were in those
times,) they shall be assisted by the Puritanes of England, Scotland and
Ireland, united in one body of a Republike, the most formidable of all
Christendom? certainly it must be avowed, that all those evils with which they
have afflicted the Church of France in the times past, are nothing, in
comparrison of those with which we are threatened for the future. The truth is,
the Huguenots have been very much weakened, but they have not been yet entirely
rooted out, they are yet in as great number, and have as great animosity
against us as ever; we have taken indeed from them their Towns, and strong
places, but their hatred toward us remains, and their desire of Revenge still
lives, and they attend but for an occasion to make the same appear, which can
never be presented to them more favorably, then by the establishment of a
Puritan Republike in England; and therefore, if this shall ever come to pass,
as without all doubt it will come to pass one day, if it be not presently and
effectually hindered, we shall see again in France, the Churches ruined,
Sepulchers profaned, the ashes of the dead cast into the wind, as they have
done even to some of our Kings and others. Behold, this is that which the
Huguenots of France promise us, this is that which the Parliamentarians of
England prepare for us, in case they can finish their work with their King and
their Queen. Shall it be said to posterity? Shall it be said to the shame of
Catholics, and particularly to the oprobry of the Clergy of France, that the
Huguenots of France contributed so joyfully and freely, great sums for the aid
of the Parliamentarians, that is to say, for the enemies of God, of the holy.
Church his spouse, of your dignities and sacred Character? shall it be said
that they have made great Collections to send into England, to help to destroy,
and root up from the foundation the Kingdom of Jesus Christ, and to advance yet
further, and set up there the Kingdom of Satan; hoping when that shall be
effected to their minds, to do the same thing here in France: and that the
Catholics, and especially the Ecclesiastics, who live only upon the Patrimony
of Jesus Christ, and who have protested in their Ordination in the face and
presence of the whole Church, that they would renounce all the perishable
possessions of this world, and to have none other Inheritance then the Lord, no
other Possession then Jesus Christ, (Dominus pars haereditatis meae and calicis
mei) should not a little retrench and abridge themselves in some small thing,
whereby to help and assist the setting up of the Kingdom of the same Lord and
the same Jesus Christ in England, and to preserve to him the Inheritance which
he has there purchased to himself, at the Price of his own most precious
blood, and with that of so many Martyrs, and by consequence inevitable, to
preserve unto him here in France that kingdom, which he has here possessed
for these sixteen hundred years?

I conclude this discourse with one consideration, which respects you yet more
particularly then the rest of the Church, in regard of the quality you bear as
French. A Consideration nevertheless which the Queen of England has even
commanded me to suppress, conceiving the Interest of her own person, and that
of her children, of so small consideration, as she dares not mingle them with
the Interests of Religion. Notwithstanding it seemed to me, that I could not
omit it without breach of Piety and good Nature that is, to consider a little
the eminent peril and danger, wherein the Queen of England and her children
now are, to fall into a more deplorable and miserable condition then ever
persons of their birth and quality were reduced unto: to see on the one side
six young Princes and Princesses, the tenderness of whose age, is yet within the
verge and Limit of Innocence; Princes, which are the grandchildren, Nephews,
and Cousin Germans of our Kings; Princes, who derive their birth and blood from
twenty or two and twenty Kings of England, and from twelve or fifteen Kings of
Scotland, and who are generally allied to all the Crowned heads of
Christendom, and of whom for that cause, it may as justly be said, as of the
children of the Emperors of Constantinople of old, that they were engendered of
Purple, Cum Majestate creatos,
Nullaque privatae passos contagia sortis.
Born in the glory and midst of the splendour of Sovereign Majesty; nourished
and brought up upon the Royal Throne, in hopes to command one day great and
powerful Nations: To see them I say now at the very point of being despoyled
of three great Kingdoms, which so many of their Ancestors have left them from
hand to hand, as a well-assured patrimony; to be constrained to leave their
native Country now in their tender Age, and to wander in strange countries as
vagabonds to seek the security of their lives and persons, and even there to
eat that bread, which they cannot eat in their own house, and amongst their own
Subjects and Citizens, is a thing, that none who has ought of the tenderness
of a man left in him can speak or think of without tears.

In Servitutem cadere de Regno grave est Was the saying of a despoyled Prince
in the Tragic Poet; to see on the other side a most Catholic Princess, whose
veins contein and hold, and in which there runs along the precious blood of
our St. Lewis, which is not only the life of her body, but also animates, and
impregnates her heart with the same sentments of Piety, which has acquired to
that great Saint a Crown of Glory in the Heavens, and a shrine in our Temples;
A Princess, who in imitation of that most imitable Saint, has set up the
Altars, and the true worship of God in England, and has caused the Catholic
Religion again to grow and triumph there, with all the splendour and glory
imaginable, for the space of 15 or 16 years, in despite of all the opposition
that Heresy could make against it, and that after it had been continually
oppressed and persecuted for the space of an hundred years: yea, so far had
this proceeded, as there has been even in the chief City of the Kingdom, a
Covent of Capuchin Fathers, Preaching, Catechizing, and Confessing every day
publicly, and that not only in French, but also in English, administering the
Sacraments, and Celebrating divine service with as much solemnity and liberty,
and I durst even say in proportion, with as great affluence of people, as in
any Church in Paris, The King saying nothing to it, nor any of the Ministers of
State, or Justice of that Kingdom daring to impeach or hinder it, especially
for these last ten years; yea, even so far, that there has been seen to the
Admiration of all Christendom, that which has not been seen since the time of
the Schism, and that which none could have dared ever to hope to see again,
namely, Residents from the Court of England at Rome, to Treat there with the
Pope of the affairs of Religion, and Reciprocally three Nuntio's from the Pope
in the Court of England, namely, the Seigniours, Gregory Panzani, Bishop of
Mileto in Italy, Georgio Coneo, a Scottish man by Nation, but a Domestic of
the last Pope, and of the Cardinal Barbarini, and Seignior Rossetti, who was
made Cardinal at his going out of England, all these Negotiating in the said
Court, during the space of seven or eight years, with as much liberty, yea,
even familiarity, as in the Court of any other Catholic Prince whatsoever: and
all this by the conduct, zeal, and credit of the Queen of England, who by
these sweet steps walked fairly on toward the Conversion of that Kingdom, and
which it seemed, we might speedily have hoped for, after so happy and
prosperous beginnings (but our sins have turned away that unexpected
happiness) a Princess, who has given a confidence to the poor English
Catholics, to come forth from their retirements, where they remained shut up
in obscurity, and to appear in the light with their faces erected, to profess
and exercise their Religion with all assurance; to aspire after, and actually
obtain Offices and Charges in the Court and State, after they had been for the
space of an age without liberty of breathing, or rather sighing in secret; a
Princess, who by her Alms, or rather by her immense Liberalities (of which I
can give Testimony, for that the most part thereof passed through my hands,)
has restored life to many entire families, (yea, even of the most Noble of
England) who had been despoyled of all their Estates for the cause of Religion,
and who were upon the point to die by a cruel and lingering famine; yet
notwithstanding, we may see at this day this Princess (of so excellent merit,
and who has so deeply obliged all Catholics) has been twice chased from her
own Kingdom, and forced to fly from the cruelty of her enemies with infinite
labor and peril, and that within 14 days after her delivery of a child, who
not content to have prosecuted her criminally, and to death, in their
Parliament, by their devilish Calumnies they have persecuted her in this her
flight, pursuing her both by sea and land, with Cannon discharged, (one shot of
which came into her ship) thinking to interrupt the course of her flight, and
to make her fall into the hands of her enemies, who followed her at the
distance of musket shot, other shot being made against a little house where
she was retired, entering the Chamber of her Lady of Honor, and of her maids of
Honor, and killed some persons of her train; so as this poor Princess was
forced for the saving of her life, with all speed to rise and fly 5 or 600
paces thence, without having the leisure to put on her clothes, and this on
foot, being within night, and in the deep of Winter, in the midst of snow and
frost, (it being in the month of February) and to go hide her self in a ditch,
and behind a little rising ground, to put her self under that shelter from the
Cannon, which continually played for the space of two whole hours, the bullets
flying over her head, and falling down at the feet of her Majesty, the Rebels
having no respect either to her person, or yet to her sex, which has always
found commiseration and pity in the most wild and savage spirits, nor yet
regarding her long sickness, which had brought her even within two fingers of
death; neither yet the Royal Character which she bears, which has been wont
to find Veneration among Subjects, even the most revolted; nor the blood of
France of which she is descended, and which is now redoubted and reverenced
throughout the world; to see her now deprived of that, which of all things in
the world (on this side God) is most dear unto her, namely, the King her
husband, and the Princes her children, and that which Augments her troubles and
anxieties, even to infinite, is the continual apprehensions and fear in which
she is, lest the chance of war should cause them to fall into the hands of
their enemies, who no doubt would forthwith imbrue their sacrilegious hands in
the Royal blood; to see her at the very point now, in the flower of her age,
about 35 or 36 years, to be reduced (she and all her family) into a prodigious
calamity, into which she had been already fallen, as to her own person, had it
not been hindered by the charity that has been extended to her by the King and
Queen. Lastly, to see this Princess suffer all this for the most just cause in
the World, and that which has made all our Saints and Martyrs, that is to say,
for that she is a Catholic, and re-established, and made to flourish again the
Catholic Religion in England: behold this is all her Crime, in the opinion of
the Parliamentarians, this the only fault of which they can convince her, and
of which they have declared her guilty by all their Printed Pamphlets, after
they had with greatest malice and diligence made a more accurate sear^n into
her whole life, then into the life of the most wicked Malefactor, even of those
who are guilty of treason it self. And this seems to me to be a motive that
should so much more excite us to Contribution in this cause, for that it
depends upon us for succor and relief. It is not without the greatest regret,
and with very much unwillingnesse and shame, that she is brought to this point
to ask and importune your aid: but her own Affairs, and the whole Catholic
cause, especially in England, are at present come to that State, that she
believed it was her duty on this occasion, even to offer some violence to her
own disposition, to overcome the greatness of her spirit, and to put out, and
lay by, all sense of that shame, confusion, and repugnancie, which has
hitherto deterred her.

Ne^ turpe putat quid quid miseros fortuna jubet. She knows your hearts so
filled and flaming with the zeal of the Catholic Religion, she knows that you
are so deeply affectionate to the Royal blood of our Kings, she knows you so
Christian-like charitable, and tenderly compassionate to the miseries of all
afflicted, even those of lowest quality and condition, how much mote then of
Crowned heads (whereof her self is one) cast down into, and overwhelmed in the
Abyss, and bottom of all manner of misery and unhappines, that she believes it
cannot be a thing unacceptable to offer you this an occasion, (the most
glorious before men, and most meritorious before God) to give to all
Christendom a public Demonstration, that these good and laudable dispositions
do dwell and work in you. For how can you ever better employ your Liberality
and your Alms, then to hinder the progress of Heresy, to advance Religion,
and to retire out of a total ruin all the Catholics of England? to deliver
from misery, from alms and from beggary it self (I make no difficulty to use
these terms, for that the Queen of England has held it no dishonor to use
them, and to write them with her own hand in the memorial which she gave me
of those things, which I should represent unto you on her part) to deliver
therefore I say, from alms and beggary, a Queen, and Princes who are the
children of those who have founded and endowed our benefices, and who have
bestowed them upon us?

The assistance which the Queen of England desires of you, is, what in your own
prudence you think fit, both for the sums you shall lend, and of the manner of
furnishing thereof, whether at one entire payment, or at diverse, as being
desirous to be as little but then some to the Clergy as she can: which also
she desires not in free and pure gift, but only by way of Loan, and that only
until God shall please to restore her affairs into some better estate. This,
if you shall do, you will have a great part of the glory of the happy
re-establishment of the Catholic Religion and of Monarchy in the Kingdom of
England, you shall be the cause of the salvation spiritual and temporal of an
infinite number of persons, who now stretch forth their hands unto you out of
the midst of their perils, and from the darkness of their prisons, imploring
your assistance, as does also all the remainder of the poor Catholic Church in
England, no more now triumphant as I have sometimes seen it, no more simply
militant, but if I may so say, suffering, persecuted, expiring and dying, which
implore your assistance by the mouth of their Queen, and by me: And who by
their prayers and tears, and it may be also by their blood, (if God shall give
them grace to consummate their Martyrdom by the loss of their lives) will
draw down upon you the benedictions of heaven, and will cause you to merit
immortal praises among men, and a crown of glory to Eternity.

This Speech was made the 19 of February, 46.
