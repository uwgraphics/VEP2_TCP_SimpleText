THE SPEECH OR DECLARATION OF THE LORD FAVLKLAND, TO THE LORDS OF the Upper
House, upon the delivery of the Articles of the Commons Assembly in Parliament:
AGAINST THE LORD FINCH.

LONDON, Printed for John Bartlet, and are to be sold at Austins Gate. 1641.

THE LORD FAVLKLANDS SECOND SPEECH, Made the 14th of January, 1640 after the
reading of the Articles against the Lord FINCH.
THESE Articles against my Lord FINCH being read, I may be bold to apply that
of the Poet, Nil refert tales versus qua voce legantur; and I doubt not but
your Lordships must be of the same opinion, of which the House of Commons
appears to have bin, by the choice they have made of me, that the Charge I
have brought is such, as needs no Assistance from the bringer, leaving not so
much as the color of a color for any defense, including all possible
Evidence, and all possible Aggravation (that addition alone excepted) which he
alone could make, and has made, I mean his Confession, included in his flight.

Here are many and mighty Crimes, Crimes of Supererogation, (So that High
Treason is but a part of his Charge) pursuing him fervently in every several
condition, (being a silent Speaker, an unjust Judge, and an unconscionable
Keeper.) That his Life appears a perpetual Warfare (by Mines, and by Battery,
by Battle, and by Stratagem) against our fundamental Laws, which (by his own
confession) several Conquests had left untoucht, against the excellent
Constitution of this Kingdom, which has made it appear to Strangers rather
an Idea, then a real Commonwealth, and produced the honor and happiness of
this to be a wonder of every other Nation, and this with unfortunate success,
that as he always intended to make our Ruins a ground of his advancement; so
his advancement the means of our further ruin.

After that, contrary to the further end of his place, and the end of that
meeting in which he held his place, he had as it were, gagged the
Commonwealth, taking away, (to his power) all power of speech from that body
of which he ought to have bin the Mouth, and which alone can perfectly
represent the condition of the people, whom that only represents, which if he
had not done, in all probability, what so grave and judicious an Assembly might
have offered to the consideration of so gracious and just a Prince, had
occasioned the redress of the grievances they then suffered, and prevented
those which we have since endured, according to the ancient Maxim of Odisse
quos laeseris: he pursued this offense toward the Parliament, by inveighing
against the Members, by Scandalizing their proceedings, by trampling upon their
Acts and Declarations; by usurping and devolving the Right; by diminishing and
abrogating the power, both of that and other Parliaments, and making them (as
much as in him lay) both useless and odious to his Majesty, and pursued his
hatred to this fountain of Justice by corrupting the streams of it, the Laws;
and perverting the Conduit pipes, the Judges.

He practiced the annihilating of Ancient, and Notorious perambulations of
particular Forests, the better to prepare himself to annihilate the Ancient,
and Notorious perambulation of the whole Kingdom, the Meeres and bounders
between the liberties of the Subject and Sovereign power; he endeavored to
have all tenures in durante been placito, to bring al Law from his Majesty's
Courts, into his Majesty's breast: he gave our goods to the King, our Lands to
the Dear, our Liberties to his Sheriffs; so that there was no way by which we
had not been oppressed, and destroyed, if the power of this person, had been
equal with his will: Or that the will of his Majesty, had been equal to his
power.

He not only by this means, made us liable to all the effect of an Invasion
from within, (and by destruction of our Liberties, which Included the
destruction of our propriety; which Included the destruction of our Industry)
made us liable to the terriblest of all Invasions: that of want, and poverty.
So that if what he plotted, had taken Root (and he made it, as sure as his
Declaration could make it (what himself was not) Parliament Proof) in this
wealthy, and happy Kingdom, there could have been left, no abundance but of
grievances, and coffeehouse, no satisfaction but amongst the guilty. It is
generally observed of the Plague, that the Infection of others, is an earnest,
and constant desire of all that are seized by it: and as this design resembles
that disease, in the ruin, destruction, and desolation, it would have wrought,
so it seems noe less like it in this effect: He having so labored to make
others share in that guilt, that his solicitation, was not only his Action,
but his works, making use both of his Authority, his Interesse, and
Importunity, to persuade; and in his Majesty's name (whose piety is known to
give that Excellent Prerogative to his person, that The Law gives to his place,
not to be able to do wrong) to threaten the rest of the Judges, to sign
opinions contrary to Law, to assign answers contrary to their opinions, to
give Judgment which they ought not to have given, and to recant Judgment, when
they had given as they ought, so that whosoever considers his care of, and
Concernment, both in the growth and the Immortality of this project, cannot but
by the same way, by which the wisest Judgment found the true Mother of the
Child, discover him not only to have been the Fosterer, but the Father, of
this most pernicious, and envious design.

I shall not need to observe that this was plotted and pursued by an English
man, against England, (which increases the Crime in no less degree then
parricide is beyond Murder) that this was done in the greatest matter joined
to the greatest Bond, being against the general liberty, and public
propriety, by a sworn Judge, (and if that salt it self, because unsavory, the
Gospel it self, has designed whither it must be cast) that he poisoned our
very Antidotes, and turned our Guard into a destruction, making Law the ground
of Illegality: that he used this Law not only against us, but against it
self, making it as I may say, Felo de se, making the pretense, (for I can
scarce say, the appearance of it) so to contribute the utter ruin of it self.

I shall not need to say, that either this (or none can be) of the highest
kind, and in the highest degree of Parliamentary Treason, a Treason which need
not a computation of many several Actions, which alone were not Treason, to
prove a Treason altogether, and by that demonstration of the intention, to make
that formality Treason which were materially but a misdemeanor, a Treason,
as well against the King, as against the Kingdom, for whatsoever is against the
whole, is undoubtedly against the head, which takes from his Majesty, the
ground of his Rule, the Laws, (for if foundations be destroyed, the Pinnacles
are most endangered) which takes from his Majesty the principal honor of his
Rule, the Ruling over Freemen, (a power as much Nobler then over Villaynes, as
that is that is over Beasts) which endeavored to take from his Majesty, the
principal support of his Rule, their hearts and affections over whom he Rules
(a better and surer strength and wall to the King, then the Sea is to the
Kingdom) and by begetting a mutual distrust, and by that a mutual
disaffection between them, to hazard the danger even of the destruction of
both.

My Lords, as it were unreasonable in any case to suspect your Justice, so here
especially, where your Interest so nearly unites you, your great share in
Possessions, giving you an equal concernment in propriety, the care and pains
used by your Noble Ancestors in the founding and asserting of our common
Liberties, rendering the just defense of them, your most proper and peculiar
Inheritance, and both exciting to oppose and extirpate all such designs as did
introduce, and would have settled an Arbitrary, that is, an Intolerable form
of Government, and have made even your Lordships and your posterity but Right
Honorable Slaves.

My Lords, Luctando cum larva, in accusing the Ghost of a departed person, whom
his crimes accuse more then I can do; and his absence accuses no less then
his Crime. Neither will I excuse the length of what I have said, because I
cannot add to an Excuse, without adding to the Fault, or my own Imperfections,
either in the matter or manner of it, which I know must appear the greater, by
being compared with that Learned Gentleman's great ability, who has preceded me
at this time: I will only desire by the Command, and in the behalf of the
House of Commons, that these proceedings against the Lord FINCH, may be put in
so speedy a way of dispatch, as in such cases the course of Parliament will
allow.

FJNJS.
