The Committee-mans Complaint, and the SCOTS Honest Usage.
I Am a poor Committee-man
(although there be not many)
Yet where the bonny Blue-Caps come,
those sure are poor, if any.
The North was called the barren Land,
we pitied were at London;
To us the Plagues of Egypt came,
and have our Countries undone.
You need not go too far to ask,
examine M. Needam,
He Will swear, all that the Scots have done,
is for the Kingdoms freedom.
That Money was first sent to them,
but summoned them together;
The next great Sum was for them raised,
that was to bring them hither:
Our loyal friends, who called the Scots,
now heartily abhor them,
But that Sir Thomas Fairfax came,
they had not now sent for them.
You need not etc.
These Northern Locusts to us came
in swarms, like Bees together;
But they may thank their General King,
or they had nere raught hither:
Had he been like Sir Marmaduke,
we then had struck a Battle,
And made the bonny Blue-Cap run
to Tweede, like Summer Cattle.
You need not etc.
But they into our Country came,
and will you know the reason?
'Twas for our gudes they came, they say,
and that could be no Treason.
No sooner were they come, but they
our gudes began to plunder,
And left us nothing but our Soil,
that they could bear or sunder.
You need not etc.
They left us Sicknesses and Sins,
(the Darlings of that Nation)
The Flux, the nastie Pestilence,
Lust, Pride, Dissimulation;
Besides, they have infected us
with strange Religious Treasons,
And maskt them with a Covenant,
more to abuse our Reasons.
You need not etc.
Besides their Money monthly raised,
our Lands were sequestrated,
Two hundred thousand pounds they got,
and all their demands stated:
All what they liked, our Horse and Arms
they took* so they disarmed us,
And left the North as poor as Job,
and swore our wealth but harmed us.
You need not etc.
They out of Yorkshire carried more
then would have bought two Scotlands,
Yet could not keep our Horse alive,
they have less Grass then Oat-lands:
Our men in Scotland died like Dogs,
with change of Air and Diet,
With good Oatmeale, long and short Keale,
yet will they not be quiet.
You need not etc.
This Needam is Britannicus,
so they mis-name the Creature,
There Is scarce a Car-man in the Town,
but dares proclaim him traitor:
And for the bonny Blue-Cap, I
will be so bold to tell him,
Had he his good King Charles again,
for Siller he would sell him.
But since the South, to save themselves,
the Loyal North have undone,
We hope there is a Northern man
may now come even with London.
You need not go too far to ask,
examine M. Needam,
He Will swear, all that the Scots have done,
is for the Kingdoms freedom.
London: Aug: 26: 1647
