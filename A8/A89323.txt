THE ARMIES DUTY; OR, FAITHFUL ADVICE to the Soldiers: GIVEN In two Letters
written by several honest men, unto the Lord FLEETWOOD Lieutenant-Generall of
the ARMY, and now Published for the Instruction of the whole Army, and the
good People of this Commonwealth.

LONDON, Printed, and are to be sold in Pope's Head Alley, S. Paul's Churchyard,
and Westminster Hall, 1659.

To the Reader.
REader, Whoever thou art, it is fit thou should know that the following Letters
were sent to the Lord Fleetwood, and read by him before the calling of the late
Parliament, but were not intended to be published, because those that wrote
them, hoped that this advice would have been followed, and they so much wished
the Lord Fleetvvoods Honor, that they desired the good he should do might
appear to be from the impulse of his own mind, but now finding that our Country
has languished so many months since, and seeing the distraction and confusion,
that his neglect has now brought upon us, and finding the general Counsel of
Officers, to have expressed their sense of our dangers and impending ruin; and
to have interposed in the dissolving the Parliament: when they found by
experience, that a settlement would not be made by them, we thought fit to make
these Letters public, hoping that it may in some measure quicken up the Lord
Fleetvvood himself, upon a second reading of them, and also those Officers that
are now concerned by the utmost peril of their lives, to procure a settlement
of that common freedom, which has cost so much blood and treasure, we have
only to request your reading these Letters, with respect to the season wherein
they were written, and without prejudice upon your minds, and the Lord: Cause
you to understand and do the things that belong to our Countries Peace and
Welfare.

My Lord,
YOu have long been the object of many good men's pity and prayers, who have
judged in charity that the temptations of your late Fathers Court have been too
mighty for you. But now you are become the object of their prayers and great
expectations; hitherto they thought you unable to prevent the wickedness and
apostasy which you have often seemed to mourn for in secret. But now the chief
military power derived from any lawful authority being fallen upon you, and
all such Officers and Soldiers in the Army as have any sense of justice and
honesty in their use of arms, being ready to be commanded by you, and to
rejoice in their return to their first principles. They believe that God has
made your way plain before you to vindicate the profession of Religion from the
black reproaches that rest upon it, to restore the peoples liberties, the
Armies honor, and price of their blood. And therefore they hope and pray that
the Lord may say effectually to you upon this opportunity: Be thou strong and
of a good courage in this my work, and I will be with thee. But if you should
now sit still, they think as Mordecai said to Esther that deliverance and
enlargement shall arise to the people from another; but you and your fathers
house shall be destroyed. Now my Lord, do not imagine us either vain
Enthusiasts or busy bodies that thus mind you, what is expected from you. We
are such as engaged with you in the war against the late King, and do believe
that you and we must render an account to the dreadful God of the justice and
sincerity of our intentions therein, and our souls are deeply afflicted to
behold our righteous ends perverted, the blood of our friends shed in the
quarrel, trampled upon, the binding power of trusts, promises, and oaths,
slighted, and the same (if not worse) principles of Arbitrary power, Tyranny,
and oppression exercised, asserted, and maintained, against which we have so
earnestly contended with a prodigal expense of our blood and estates; and our
hearts are wounded to hear our old cause now made a mock and by*word by our
enemies, and to see such a black brand of infamy set upon all the Parliaments
adherents, as if they had been all the vilest hypocrites, who made pretenses of
Religion, and faithfulness to their Countries Laws and Liberties, to be only a
cloak for the blackest wickedness, as if none of them had ever intended any
more, then by force and fraud to fat up themselves upon the blood and ruins of
other families. But your Lordship knows, that the Kings invasion of our
properties and liberties, by taxes, illegal imprisonments, and opposition of
the Parliament in their supreme trust of ordering the Militia for the peoples
safety, did necessitate us to defend it by arms, as our native right, that the
trust of the peoples safety and welfare, their strength, and purses, was only
in the hands of their successive Parliaments, and that they ought to be
governed only by the Laws: And their consciences, persons, or estates, to be at
no man's will or mercy; And doubtless the defense of these Liberties is
essentially necessary to the well being of any Nation, and to the being of
public moral righteousness amongst men. And your Lordship knows that all the
successes and victories have been owned, as from the wonderful appearance of
God for his people in this honest cause, and that you caused the exercise of
the chief Magistracy in England by a single person to be abolished, because it
was dangerous to this righteous cause, as well as useless and burdensome. Now
my Lord, let us appeal to your conscience whether we ought not to expect those
things we do, we are unwilling lest it should wound too deep to make a
comparison between the principles of Tyranny and oppression that were
attempted to be practiced by the late King, and were declared by you to be
begotten by the blasphemous arrogance of Tyrants upon their servile parasites,
and those that have been practiced and avowed since God gave us victory in the
defense of our Liberties (and though we confess the greatest number of honest
men have hitherto least smarted under them, yet they will infallibly have the
greatest weight of them upon their backs hereafter, should those principles get
root amongst us, they being the only likely men to destroy them, and however,
injustice against Enemy ought to be abhorred by righteous Men.) But let us
tell your Lordship that it is the secret sigh of every honest heart: Oh that
God would now take away the reproach from this People, and their eyes are much
upon you in it, and shoud you slight our eyes and expectations in this case,
assuredly the blood of our friends shed in the Cause, will cry aloud for
vengeance against you.

We have better thoughts of your Lordship, then that you should seek to shelter
your self in your omission of so great a Duty, or in your proceeding in the
evils begun under those vain subterfuges which have been used of late: Oh be
not deceived with pretenses of Providence of God, leading you from your old
Cause into things not to be justified by the moral Laws. The holy God
directs his People only into the paths of Righteousness, that is such Actions
as agree with his Laws, 1, John 3. 7, 8, 10. He that does not Righteousness is
not of God, His Providence and his Laws alalwaies speak the same things,
neither let any man deceive you with pretense of necessity that constrains you
to desert your old Principles for the People of Gods sake and to advance
Christ's Kingdom; For it is not possible there should be necessity to
transgress a Divine natural Law that is Eternal, there may be cases of
extreme inevitable necessity, that may disoblige a man from some Divine
positive Laws, because a Superior that is a Divine, natural Law may oblige
him in that case; Therefore in every case of highest necessities, the
immutable Laws of Nature ought to be Guides and Commanders of what is to be
done: And if your Lordship can make your Actions or Omissions consist with
those, neither God nor his People will blame you. And in so doing only, you
can advance Christ's Kingdom: For then is he exalted when supreme Reverence,
and absolute subjection is given to his Fathers Laws in the denial of our
selves in all Countermands and Temptations, and when the sword of the Spirit is
used to increase the number of such Subjects: For this Scepter, Throne and Wars
are of and in Righteousness.

Therefore, we beseech your Lordship without hesitation or delay, pursue the
exaltation of Christ and his Kingdom, in following in simplicity and integrity
of heart after those righteous ends you proposed and declared in the late
war, and unto which you have obliged your self by all the sacred Bonds of
humane society: be not affrighted with some Parasites, bugbears of Confusion,
if you shake the Diana, by which they hope to subsist, fear not assistance from
every honest heart in England, and though some pretenders to honesty, may out
of cowardice, or ambition, or covetousness, cry, there is a Bear and a Lion in
the way, yet even they shall run after you when they see you forward in your
way; And to avoid delays, let us beseech your Lordship first to examine your
conscience presently what you can answer to the blood of any poor Saint shed,
that cries in your ears to settle that Liberty and Justice in his Country for
which he shed his blood under your command.

Secondly, what you can answer to the blood of Thousands of the enemies, which
are esteemed by God as murdered by you if the Iustifick cause of the war be not
effectually prosecuted. Will not their blood cry to God, and say, Lord, this
Fleetwood killed us upon pretense that we should have destroyed the Liberties
of the People of God, in imposing Arbitrarie power upon them, which we did
ignorantly? And he has done the same thing, and made or suffered more heavy
Yokes to be imposed; Pray remember it, The Scripture says, Think thou O
Man, that judge another, and do the same things thy self, that thou shall
escape the judgment of God, Rev. 1. 3, 4.

Thirdly, We beseech you to examine what Cause you now maintain with constant
expense of blood, and the Peoples Estates, and how you can give an account to
God for it. Remember what are the causes for which God allows men's blood to
be shed without blood-guiltinesse in him that causes it; and try whether that
be one, to make a Nation greater slaves to John a Styles and his Confederates,
then they would have been to John a Nokes. But we pray your Lordship if it be
possible that any pretense can be found for it, state a justifick Cause of
your present posture of Arms, that thousands of tender consciences may be
satisfied how to pray for you in any of your present designs, if God should
not honor you in the work which they now expect from You.

Now My Lord, if we would plead with you by worldly Arguments or motives, that
concern your self, it were easy to evince, that safety, honor, and greatness
to your self, and family, can be certainly compassed by no other means, then
by returning to the Principles from whence you are fallen, your daily tenors
that now attend you and your Counsels, would soon vanish, you might have above
threescore thousand men of honest principles that would take themselves
concerned to be in arms at an hours warning to assist you, and this without
second charge, and an army of prayers 2. times as great, indeed who would or
could hurt you, if you were a naked sincere follower of that which is good. We
appeal to your conscience, whether you do not believ that your late Father was
more safe with a Footboy only following him in the streets when he was
believed to intend that good that your Lordship may if you please effect, then
he was afterward (when he was believed to intend his own ambition) environed
with Guards, and enclosed with locks, and bolts without number; Indeed the
only means of safety for such as will exercise great power over a people to
the subjection of their liberties, is a mercenarie Army. And if that consists
of some of the same people, their interest will change as often as they get
estates that are of more value then their pay, and then they will be ready to
conspire with any of the people to provide liberty and security of their
estate for their children, and then the power of the Tirants shake, And of how
many slaughters of the Kings of Israel do we read by their own service; and
if mercenarie strangers be intended to be Guards for Rulers in England, our
Ancestors taught us the way, when they were not so well instructed in their
liberty to ridd our selves of them in a night, But if your own person could be
secure for a while; what will be the portion of your family, if th eir persons
and estates be left to the mercy of him that gets uppermost, And if you expect
greatness or honor, consider whose names are delivered to us from former ages
with reverence, and esteem, and who have been most admired, honored, and
obeyed, by their country and people: Can a Dionysius compare, command or fain
with a Tymoleon; was ever great Cyrus or Alexander obeyed like the poor young
Fisher-boy Massinello in Naples, whilst the people imagined he sought a
settlement of their liberty? But we suppose the sense and remembrance of your
duty to God and his people, should be of greater weight in your Lordships
heart then all the conceits of the earth, and therefore we also forbear to mind
you of the improbabilitie of settling this Nation according to the rules of
policy, upon any other basis then their liberty; the lands and interests of
this Nation being so dispersed and with so much equality, that whosoever shall
attempt to invade our liberties will not find an interest able to overballance
the peoples interest, and therefore cannot long maintain a Dominion over them;
But we forbear to mention this Capital politic consideration to your Lordship
at present, only let us beg your serious consideration how much the honor of
the profession of the Gospel is concerned in what we move your Lordship to, and
expect from you; And that you would say to your self, is it not better that I
and mine perish, then that a public scandal be brought upon Gospel profession
by my injustice and treachery to my Country under a show of holiness; and if
we shall observe by your Lordships actions from henceforth that there are some
apearances, that God has begun to imprint upon your heart the sense of your
public duty, and that he will put that honor and greatness upon you to be the
restorer of his peoples liberties in this Nation, we shall then think our
selves obliged to write again to your Lordship or wait upon you to strengthen
your hands; In the interim, we shall pray without ceasing, that wisdom,
courage and strength may be given you from the Father of all mercies, and that
out of his fullness you may be in all things prepared for the accomplishing his
own work of righteousness; And if in judgment to this Nation your heart should
be hardened by these poor lines, your Lordship will be left more inexcusable,
and however some satisfaction in the discharge of your duties will arise to the
Conscices of

My Lord, Your Lordships

My Lord,
WE presumed lately to mind your Lordship of your present opportunity, and most
important duty, and our souls wish that the the secrets of your thoughts upon
it were revealed, that our hearts and prayers might be toward you, and for you
accordingly we must tell your Lordship that you have since wounded the hearts
of many precious Saints, by conducting your Army officers, in an action of
such gross hypocrisy, and palpable flattery, as that address you made to your
new Protector, we have reason to believe that it had been impossible for your
Lordship to have said privately to an honest man without blushing, what you
have said there to the world under your hand, and if your Lordship will
remember (with God in your eye) what is said of your father, and your brother
in it, and of an unknown connection between his person and your cause, which a
lso you cannot now, and as now (state to your own conscience as just,) we are
confident your heart will smite you, and if your own heart condemn you, God is
greater then your heart, and must much more condemn you. Truly my Lord, we were
much startled in our hopes from you, and prayers for you, (and we hear the same
of others) when we saw that address, yet our remembrance of your secret
expressions even with tears, of your sense of the Armies backslidings, and your
earnest entreaties of us to pray for you, together with the great respect we
have, for your Lordship has inclined us strongly to the best thoughts of you,
sometimes saying one to another, surely he had not read our letter before his
Address, yet we have been so stumbled, that we had troubled your Lordship no
farther in this kind, if God had not so placed the interest of his cause and
people upon our spirits, that we are restless within our selves, until we
have said so much, as may be either effectual upon your heart, or at least
discharge our consciences, and leave you inexcusable. If therefore the Lord
has made us his remembrancers to you, and revived his fear in your heart,
whilst you considered what we sent you, we have reason to conclude that you
are come to these resolves in your own breast, viz. 1. That the peoples arms
of this nation have been committed to your charge in your several capacities,
as a steward of that high trust for them, to employ them for their benefit, in
preserving their rights and freedom, and that you must give an account to the
eternal God of that stewardship.

2. That you are under all possible sacred and indispensable obligations to be
faithful in your trust.

3. That the cause for which you were trusted was to defend and maintain the
peoples right to make laws for themselves, and thereby provide for their own
welfare and safety, by such persons as they should choose, and that without the
negative control of the King, and also to defend the freedom of their
consciences, persons, and estates, in being over the only government of their
own laws, without subjection to the will or mercy of any man.

And we suppose you may also conclude that you have now power and opportunity
cast upon you to secure this liberty unto Gods people, according to humane
prudence beyond the reach of wicked men, and that if you should hide your
talent of power, in the napkins of fear, cowardice, ambition, or self-interest,
you will be condemned from the mouth of your own conscience, for an
unprofitable and unfaithful servant.

Now if God has enabled your Lordship thus to consider, with a pure
understanding, and with integrity of heart thus to resolve, we know you are
continually saying within your self, men and brethren what shall I do, to show
my faithfulness to the cause of God, and the people, and to vindicate my
possession from scandal; and in hopes that God has thus disposed your heart,
we shall endeavor to inquire into your particular duty.

And in our search we may assert this general maxim, as an infallible pillar
to guide you in your present duty to your generation, viz. that the peoples
liberties cannot be lastingly secured to them by any other means, then an
institution of sense, wise order or method, wherein the people may make and
execute their own laws, and use their own arms and strength, for the common
good of the whole society. This may direct all your Lordships thoughts and
debates, about a settlement, and keep in your eieperpetually the white mark
wherein all your designs and contrivances of public concernment, ought to
center; this may prepare you, to pass a quick sentence upon all the ambitious
proposals of your Court-parasites, this may cut off all those Court debates,
about impowering a Prince, to check and control the people by his negative, in
their making their laws. It ought to be no question, whither the people should
make their own laws, God himself having resolved it, the very point being the
single point whereupon you joined Battle at first with the King, you defending
that the Parliaments Ordinance for the Malitia, was a Law without the Kings
consent, and he denying it to be of any force, and affirming those Traitors,
that obeyed that, and not his Commissions of Array (this by the Kings
Confession was the first quarrel) this liberty then being their blood, cannot
be taken from them, but by the highest robbery and contempt of Obligations to
God and Man. Therefore your Lordships duty is no more then to contrive the
best, most prudent form, and order, wherein the people may enjoy their own,
with the least hazard of being preyed upon by Tirants, or being disquieted by
their own ignorant disorders and confusions: Your duty to the people, is like
to that of a Guardian to an Heir, Not to give them an Estate, but to set down
rules, how it shall be ordered for them, and they put in quiet Possession of
it, to their most advantage and security, and this duty is the more incumbant
upon you, because you have broken, and trampled to pieces, beyond repair all
those old Christian forms, wherein they formerly enjoyed their liberties,
though with continual Disputes, and subject to daily injuries and oppressions.

Now before we propose to your Lordship any Form or Order to be settled, it is
fit that we discover to you the Errors and inconsistencies, of your present
practices, and appearing design, both in themselves, and in relation to the
peoples liberties.

First, it is a grand error in the foundation, if you imagine it possible to
secure liberty or justice to the people, only by advancing good men to power
over them, and trusting to the grace in their hearts, to rule in
righteousness, good men upon the single account of mortality, can be no
lasting bottom, whereupon to settle liberty and justice. It Is beyond the
wisdom of man, to contrive an infallible provision, in the present age that
the ruling power in the succeeding age, shall fall only into good men's hands,
but what age ever produced men of such enlightened pure minds? that of
themselves could discern right at all times, without the least cloud of their
private interest upon their understandings, and also pursue such dictates of
their minds, without interruptions by corrupt affections; we mention this, not
as if our Souls did not wish, that all powers were vested in the best of men,
but because we know that every man is vanity, and a Lie; and yet we believe,
it is often whispered in your ears, by some weak well meaning men, that honest
men's liberty would then be secure, and they satisfied, if they could see good
men put into power, saying we should then need no laws, for they would be a
law to themselves, having Gods law in their hearts, but those that thus by
consequence beg advancement, know not what they ask, scarce intending to be the
peoples lords and to rule them as their slaves, which is necessarily employed
in the arbitrarie power they ask; neither do they apprehend, what horrid
impiety it is, for any man in England now to erect, and exercise an arbitrarie
power, they see not the blasphemous arrogance of such as rule without laws,
being indeed, an attempt to erect their throne, in it is kind, higher then
Almighty Gods, who rules and judges only according to his laws, without
which there is neither justice, nor injustice in things humane, or divine,
therefore the peoples security of liberty, and justice, must be founded upon
excellent laws, or constitutions, for the continued order, from generation to
generation, wherein the people shall choose their own laws and magistrates, and
if good men in power, will in simplicity and integrity join heads, hearts,
and hands to establish such an order, or form of Government, they will be
worthily esteemed the founders, though not the foundation of our Liberties.

Secondly, it is a gross mistake, to think that the securing the peoples
Liberties, and the creating of a Sovereign Prince over them, (under whatsoever
title) can consist together, we mean such a Prince or Potentate, the tenure of
whose power, shall not be upon the people, and who shall not be subject, and
accomptable to the Laws of this Commonwealth, doubtless the people may not be
free, where there shall be a chief Magistrate, whose deserved real honor and
greatness, may justly make him disdain to look down upon the Throne of the
greatest Monarch, yet if he shares in the Soveraigntie, he subverts Liberty
and the foundation of his own glory: the very essence or formal reason of a
Nations freedom, consists in the peoples making their own Laws and
Magistrates, and therefore it is a contradiction to say, we are free under a
Prince controling our Laws in their Creation, or Execution, and imposing his
Officers upon us at his will and the consequence of that practice, even in our
late Kings, has caused all our present bloody ruins, his Officers being
naturally inclined, and resolved to serve their Creator, to the subversion of
our Laws and Liberties; besides, if a Prince be invested with the least
Punctilio of the Soveraigntie, it is exceeding vain to imagine, that he should
not naturally aspire to the top of it: every thing having an innate desire of
its own perfection, and there being no other visible means to preserve from
the peoples reach, that part which he has, but the destruction of their
Liberty, you may as well suppose, fire not to ascend, as such a Prince not to
be wishing and aspiring to be an absolute Lord, if he had neither ambition, nor
pride in himself, nor in his appendixes, his Court Parasites, yet the
unavoydable reciprocal fear, in the people, and such a Prince, least each
should dispoil the other of his share of Soveraigntie, will compel the Prince
to provide for his own security, and do your Lordship think he will believe
himself safe, until he has set himself above the peoples reach, and brought
them to depend upon his will? It may be he that you would create Prince with a
small share of Soveraginty, would at first think his power great, yet in
continuance he would esteem it small, men naturally reaching beyond what they
have attained; Liberty therefore and Principality, are incompatible, and can
never last together: It seems strange to a People, that they should be free,
and yet serve, and be imposed upon it is strange to a Prince, that he should be
chief Lord and not command; The mean of Liberty, is the Mother of Murder, and
Tyranny; any Freedom from Princes Commands being intolerable to them, they
by Violence take it away, or attempt it, and that forces a Violent brutish
Tyrany, instead of Government, We need not look far for an instance of this,
the blood and sufferings of our Ancestors, and our own Age, witness it, has
not our Princes and Ancestors been always struggling for four hundred years,
and thousands perished in it, that are known, besides the ruin of many
Worthies which no History durst mention, unless with Infamy, to please the
Tyrants, And your Lordship has seen, with what an Earthquake, Liberty
subverted Principality, when it found Opportunity. Therefore, if you wish us,
and our Posterities no greater good then only Quiet, it behooveth you to make
us wholly Free, or wholly Slaves.

Thirdly, It is no small fayler of foresight, that you may imagine it feasible
in this Nation, at this time, to establish a Principality, or Monarchy, of
any probable continuance, unless you can destroy all present Real Properties
and vest all, or most of the Lands of ENGLAND, in your Monarch. Every Princes
Power of Command must arise either from a voluntary Submission, and
willingness of a People to serve him, as their Lord, or from a Violent
Compulsion, of them to be subject to Him, and both those are founded upon an
inequality, between him and them, either real or apparent. A Peoples
willingness to serve a Prince (if any such be) arises from their apprehension
of some great inequality and dispropor^ion between him and them, either in
virtue, interest, or power. The two first are proper to a Prince in his native
country* or one that has dominion over only a sovereign Prince* who may be
thought powerful to one people, the last may be proper to protect a people,
and that may be chosen a s the least of some impudent mischiefs; but if any
people ever were, or shall be voluntarily subject to a Prince, upon their high
opinion of his unequal transcendent virtue, that related only to his person,
and never was or can be a solid foundation for an hereditary Monarchy, but an
unequal interest in the lands, may be, and is the common cause, either of a
voluntary or constrained subjection: no man serves for naught, it is the need
that people have of the Lords interest, that procures him servants, and enables
him to compel subjection: so Joseph that new molded the Egyptian Monarchy,
devised a way for the King to get all the possessions into his hands, that so
the people might serve Pharaoh, which was a necessary consequence. It Is evident
that the relation of masters and servants would soon be banished the world, if
all men's interests, virtues* and strength were equal, and much sooner would
the names of princes and subjects be for ever razed out of memory; surely then
(my Lord) it is beyond dispu e that if you intend to settle a Monarchy over us,
it must be by violence, for it cannot enter into your heart, to imagine, that
you shall find a man, whose glorious virtues shall be as a Sun amongst the
stars compared with all the virtues in this nation, and those also to be surely
intailed upon his heirs, neither can your Lordship pretend, to find any family,
whose interest in the lands is now so unequal, to the bulk of the people, that
the nation should be induced by their interest to serve them.

Now that a compulsive subjection to a Monarchy, must be the product of an
unequal power, is as good as written with a Sunbeam, he that forces must be
stronger then-he that is forced, and it is as evident* that such a power is the
only natural fruit of an unequal interest in the lands, upon which the beast
of force must graze, that bears the Monarch power to force a nation, cannot be
inherent in a single person, and multitudes of hands, neither can nor will
serve him to subject a nation, unless they be h^red, (Christ himself says no
man goes to warfare at his own charge) and nothing can afford the constant
growing hire of the Princes own, but his interest in the lands, and if he put
the hirelings to rob and pilfer for their own ^ire, upon the fruits of the
lands, which the people esteem their own, (that is by taxes) the basis and root
of the power, by which the forces live, has not an appearance to be in the
Monarch, nor do his forces seem to have a necessary dependence upon him, but
may as well rob for themselves, and at best, they must remain a fluctuating
body without root, the Monarch not being able to plant them upon his lands with
condit^ons of service; and therefore they will be esteemed of the land owners,
only as the common thieves, whose hands are against every man, and ought to
have every man's hand against them, and the robbery being in such a case, to be
renewed continually upon the land-owners, and the wound always smarting, it is
of more constant danger, to subvert the Monarch, then it were for him to cut
the throats of ten thousand land-owners at once, and possess the lands, to
plant his forces upon, as their standing-quarters upon their masters own lands,
either for their lives, or during his pleasure. Surely (my Lord) it is not to be
denied, that a Monarch in his domestic dominions, has no greater rooted
continuing power over a nation, then he has an interest in the lands,
surmounting in value, the interest of the whole people, as that interest grows,
by murders, oppression, and the other common artifices of Princes, (unless the
wrath of God interposeth) so does his power root, and flourish, all other
seeming power of a Monarch, hangs as the ignorant use to say, by Geometry, and
is without bottom; it is a tree whose root is dead, and may be kept up a little
while by dead props that decays with it. It Is like an armies foraging into an
enemies country* and plundering, not being able to gain the possession of a
town, castle, or house there, as a root of power over it. Indeed, no form of
domestic government can be established to be of duration, in a nation, chiefly
living upon their lands, if property in the land do not accompany the Empire,
that is, if that order which governs (be it one man, or the few, or the people)
do not possess a greater share of the land of that country, then the rest of
the people that are governed; and therefore where the Administration is most
popular; servants, and all such as have no estates are reckoned to have no
share, or voices in the government. And we conceive, thatt the founders of
governments, have either framed their models, according to the balance of
property, which they found amongst the people, or else have divided the
property, and reduced it to their form. And your Lordship may remember when God
himself formed the people of Israel, by Moses hand, into a free Commonwealth,
there was not only a suitable division of the lands at the first, but a
perpetual law of Jubilee, to prevent alienation of lands, and the growth of
any to such unequal interest, as his power might be dangerous to the
government, and when that people rejected Gods form of their Common wealth for
a Monarch, he foretold them, 1 Samuel 8. 11. 17. that the first work of their
King would be to alter the model of property in the lands, settled by God and
take away the best of their fields, vineyards, and olive-yards, and give them
to his servants, for strengthening himself, and so they should become his
servants. And if we should not trouble your Lordship too much, we would show
from History, that all the lasting Monarchies that ever were in the world, have
been built upon this foundation, of possessing the greatest interest in their
countries lands, either immediately, or by their Peers and their powers, being
the natural result of that, they have had their births, decays, and deaths
together. Some kingdoms we say have been founded upon the Monarchs immediate
interest, or property in the lands, as many ancient Eastern Kings, and the
Turk, with other Eastern Princes at this day, who are sole proprietors or
Landlords of the whole Territories where they reign, and the people their
tenants at will, or at best for life, upon conditions of service in war,
proportionable to the value af their farms, whereby the Turk keeps an absolute
power over his subject by their dependence upon his will for their bread, and
with his own proper revenue is able also to maintain an army of strangers to
strengthen the other tie, he has upon his vassalls, and upon this root of his
property, (to the eye of humane reason) his power has grown to that monstrous
height Others kingdoms have been built upon the property in the lands, which
the Monarchs, Peers, have had jointly with and under him: so were these Western
dominions after their conquest by the Northern people, who divided a land, when
conquered, into so many parcels, as they had great Officers, leaving the choice
of the best and largest share to their Prince or leader, he becoming their
King, and the chief Officers, holding their large shares on him by some small
acknowledgements, became his Dukes, Counts, and Earls; and the common soldiers
(who came indeed to seek a country to inhabit) holding together with the poor
natives some small parcels of land under those g eat-men upon such conditions
as made them wholly dependant upon their Landlords, and thus these Dukes and
Earls paying homage and fealty and small acknowledgements to the Prince, became
princes in their own divisions, and thus the interest of the King and his Peers
over-weighed the properties of all other the Inhabitants, whereupon the power
of our ancient Monarchy was founded, and the Kings chief Officers were the
tenants and vassalls of his Peers, to whom he sent upon occasion of trouble
foreign or domestic to leavy arms, who gathered their vassalls together, and
either assisted the King, or fought against him as they l^ked the quarrel,
their soldiers never daring to dispute their Lords commands knowing no
immediate Lord but them.

Thus was the Kings power less or greater, as he agreed with his Peers they
having been able (as your Lord ship knows) to make and unmake Kings of England
as they pleased, and if their property in the lands had so remained, nothing
could have shaken the Monarchs power, if he had kept an union with them, but
the inferior people grew by degrees to better their tenures, and to make some
of their estates hereditary upon easy fines at every change, as our
coppy-holders of inheritance and some to have their estates their own free
hold, and in fine they came to abolish in England the tenures of vassailage and
vill^uinage, which is yet in practice amongst our neigh-bour nations, (whose
Monarchies stand by so much the stronger) and the people having got a better
interest in the lands, soon obtained some share in the government they were
then thought fit to be summoned to the national meetings then called Gamont,
since a Parliament, to consider what way to supply their King with money, which
was to come only from their purses and properties (the nobles then (as now in
France) payiny no Tax or Tollage) and the sense they had of their own
properties in the lands made them soon after challenge it as their right, that
their King could take no tax, toll, or tollage, unless they were pleased to
give it him in their Parliaments, and then the peoples yoakes, growing more
easy, their wealth increased, and lands being commonly suffered to be
alienated, the multitude became the purchasers, and some bought off their
serviccs that still remained due to their Lords, and others bought their Lords
lands, who proved prodigalls, and as occasion was offered, the Churches lands,
and this together with some Kings endeavors to abate the power of their Peers
in their Countries, reduced the English Peerage to an empty name, the greatest
quantity of the lands, and with those, the power being fallen into the Commons
hands, before the War, who being then sensible, they neither depended upon the
King nor his Peers for their Bread, conceived themselves obliged to serve none
but God, and therefore ought not to be commanded, or to have laws imposed upon
them by the King or his Peers, judging it the right of a people, whose property
rendered them free, and independent to choose their own laws and Magistrates,
being intended only for the preservation of their own properties and
liberties; and thus did our House of Commons gradually grow to that power which
in latter time proved formidable to the Kings, there wanting nothing to the
destructon of the Throne, whose pillars were broken, but an occasion for the
people to feel the power they had, and this was the natural cause of our late
Kings projecting to have brought German Horse, or an Irish Army into England, a
mercenary Army being the last refuge of a Monarch, divested of his Nobility,
(though that also will prove but a violent dead prop, and soon rotten, unless
he can suddenly reassume a greater property, and give them root by an interest
in the lands upon conditions of serving him) And this was the cause of the
Kings raising his Guard at York, and leaving the War; being the last means
to support his power; therefore we may say, that the dying pangs of a
Monarchial power in England, caused our Wars, as his violent stranglings for
life, much rather, then that the War caused the destruction of Monarchiall
power; the Parliaments Army did indeed prevent a possibility of the
resurrection of that power, by a forcible changing the property in the lands,
and so reviving a new Monarchy; but the old was dead by a kind of natural
desolution before the Parliament voted it useless, burdensome, and dangerous;
for surely it is neither of the three, where, and so long as it is single
property in the lands, or in union wlth his Nobility, makes the people live
upon him and them, though it is most certainly all the three, where it must be
fed upon the peoples properties; like the Snake in the Rustick's house, till it
be able to oppress them.

My Lord, we hope it will be clear to your Lordship, that England is now
become an unnatural soil for a Monarch. The Governor of the World by various
providence has so divided the land amongst the bulk of the people, that they
can live of themselves without serving, and it is preposterous to impose a
Monarch upon us, as to make a law, that the weaker shall always bind the
stronger; we believe it no less impossible to establish a lasting Monarch in
England without alteration of the interest, the multitude has in the lands,
and natural power, then it were to settle a firm lasting free State, or
Commonwealth in the Turkish Territories, suffering the Ottoman to Family to
remain the sole Landlord of the Territories, as now he is; and we suppose, that
obvious objection, that England has been a Monarchy for many hundred years, is
clearly answered, from what we have said, if you will take us as conquered, as
much by your Army, as by the Normans, and think to settle a Monarchy like
theirs, in a new line; you see the Materials, for your building and theirs,
are of a different form, and can never make a like building; England then
yielded earth to the Conqueror, by vast Earldomes, and Baronies, for the
plantation of his new Potentates, and a few confiscations or forfeitures made
his own and his creatures interest in the lands to exceed all the rest;
besides, the temper of the people, to whom any property in the land was left,
was much different from that you now find, they being then bred to learn, and
know no better; now being bred in some liberty, and the continual claim of the
whole. Neither can your Lordship with reason hope to prop up a new Monarchy, by
an Army of Natives, to be paid by Taxes, if you consider how soon their Estates
of inheritance and natural love to posterity, with their independency upon the
Monarch, a disgust of the universal Odium, they must live under by extorting
Taxes, will make them espouse the national interest as their own, as did the
foreign plants of the Normans, when rooted in lands of inheritance, so that no
sort of Arms, to be maintained by a meet Tax, can long support a Monarch,
because the very Tax, if nothing else, create's and maintain's him Enemies that
have roots in his dominions, when his friends have none: we could now show your
Lordship invincible difficulties (as our Case is) to found a Monarchy though
you should confiscate to your selves most of the peoples ends, to make your
land property over weigh all the rest but we believe the confiscation of a
people, that have never fought against you, but whose arms you have borne, to
be an act so unnatural and so full of blackness and horror, that it can
never be admitted room in your thoughts, and therefore we shall say nothing of
it.

Fourhly, but my Lord thereis a fourth mistake that deserves the first place in
the file of Errors, that is, to conceive it possible to settle your Brother
Richard and his heirs as our Prince, to share in the Sovereign power, if the
wounds of Monarchiall power in England, were not mortal, doubtless his art
and experience renders not him to be a Surgeon fit for the cure; it was poverty
and famine that shot his deadly arrow into the heart of our Monarchy, and no
plaster can heal it, but Mammon to make it self new friends, and do your
Lordship judge his estate and property sufficient to make him friends enough to
compel this Nation to subjection? what can a prudent man fancy as a foundation
of his Empire? wherein is the equality between him and the people, even in your
opinion, or the dictates of the present Armies conscience? it was said in the
last Parliament frequently, that he was a stranger to the people of God, unknown
to the Army, having never actually drawn sword, and one that was never observed
to have had any affection for the Parlaments Cause; if your Lordship please to
consider it, you will find such disadvantages attends your Brother, in his
aspiring to the Throne, as would render his settlement very doubtful, if the
basis for Monarchy stood firm in England; We pray your Lordship think of the
primary of his Education, the tenderness of his years, the meandness of
hisnatural Authority, the slenderness of his reputation as soldier, or
Counselor, and above all, the hatred and contempt the people has conceived
him; either of which, is sufficient to ruin a settled Prince; and add unto
these, the claim and pretense he sets up, by pretending to be our Prince, for
Charles Stewart against himself: (whose interest and friends foreign and
domestique may at the least be put in the balance with your Brothers) which
gives life to a growing root of a civil War; and add farther, your rendering
all knowing conscientious men desperate of their liberty bought with their
blood, and then remember the feeble interest and repute of his Lords, who in
stead of supporting his Throne, as their predecessors did their Princes have
need to be supported by it. And once more add, that his only hope and refuge
being an army for Gods assistance in such designs, ought not to be expected)
that those are natives, not his servants, nor obliged to any dependence upon
him, who must against their trust and oarhs, fight against their own country,
and their own interest, (which is to transmit to posterity their estates in
security and fr^^dome) and that all their pay must be extorted from the people
(wherein their relations are concerned) by taxes and collages, and that your
Brother must have the greatest share of them to subsist upon in his pomp, and
that many of those think their own merit and value equal to your Brothers, and
may not be full proof against ambition, and that they will not discern what aid
he contributes to the paying of the taxes, whereof he spends so much; nor what
need have they of him. Then your Lordship will pass a deliberate resolve,
whether it be probable to settle your Brother as your Monarch, especially if
your Lordship remember w th what difficulty fear and danger your father was
supported for three or four years only under most of the contrary advantages,
and above all his pretense to army and people (believed by many) that he
abhorred the thoughts of the reviving the old Monarchy, and intended to procure
a settlement of true liberty.

Now my Lord, when we think upon these things, and the work you are called to,
it is evident to us that God has hedged up all the by-waies from your duty with
thorns, or rather seas and mountains of difficulties, and made the path of
righteousness plain and easy. It Is your duty to restore the people to their
liberty, and lay solid foundations of common right and justice amongst them,
and in the natural course and order of things, it appears almost impossible to
make them slaves. Oh then give glory to God, vindicate the profession of
religion, and make your own name as sweet odours to all generations in doing
your duty, as a freewill-offering, cheerfully and speedily, least your own
necessities, and the peoples confusions should extort it from you. Your only
business then my Lord) is to settle the order for the continual successive
assemblies of the people, to make their own laws and Magistrates, all present
forms being broken by you, and an absolute necessity upon you, to appoint what
shall be next, though you would return back to that imperfect form of
Parliaments that is now become unsuitable for us as a free people. For it is
essentially necessary to the security of freedom, that the same assembly
should never have the debating and finally resolving power in them, least it
suddenly degenerates into an Oligarchie or Tyranny of some few, that assembly
being in such a case able to perpetuate themselves. Of this the providence of
God has given as an experiment in the long Parliament, who exercising both the
debating and determining power, were strongly tempted to have made themselves
perpetually legislators, and what else they please, and to have governed
according to their private interests, which if it had taken effect, would have
as much destroyed the common interest and common right, virtue and liberty, as
the same power exercised by a single person, who does also naturally make his
whole government, center in his particular interest. Therefore the order that
has always been in effect amongst free people, (although with some variation
of names and circumstances) has been this: They have ranked themselves into
three orders, the people, the Senate, and the Magistrate, whereby they have
made themselves partakers of all the benefit of the natural Democracy,
Aristocracy, and Monarchy; that is, they have had the good effects of all the
excellent endowments for rule and order, which God has dispensed to any of
their people, and by the wise distribution of the power amongst them, with
controuls to every of their corrupt affections, unto which they were prone,
they have prevented the mischiefs apt to ensue, when the governing power
happened to be placed solely in any of the three. By the people is to be
understood, (in large populous places where the body of the people is too large
to meet) the popular assembly chosen by the body of the people of interests and
estates, who have right of sufferage amongst us. This Counsel or Assembly
ought to be numerous, as one thousand or more, and their function ought to be,
to give their affirmative or negative to all laws, matters of peace, war, and
leveys of money, and that without debate, or arguing, which would bring in
confusion in so great an assembly. Therefore the matters ought always to be
proposed by the Senate, a convenient time before, that the popular assembly may
be fully advised of them, before their meeting, and then they are to be
summoned to meet, by one of their own choice for that purpose: and therefore
they ought to reside near the chief City, for the time of their power, which
may be for two or three years, one third going out of Office every year the
Assembly being filled by a new choice, and this is called the Power of the
Common wealth; The Senate is the wisdom and Authority of the Commonwealth,
which is a select Company, not very numerous, chosen by the whole People at the
same time and in the same manner with the popular Council, and to continue for
the same space, with the same changes and recruits: The Office of this
Council, is to manage affairs of Peace and Wars, when the people has Decreed
it, and to prepare all Laws and Decrees, ready for their Sufferage, to command
the Forces by Sea and Land, according to such Laws and Orders as shall be
either Fundamental to the Government, (for there ought to be an Instrument of
Government) or made from time to time by the Senate, and the people. So that
the Senate is to debate and propose, and the people to Decree and resolve all
Laws going in the name of both of these Deputies, both Senate and People ought
to have moderate Sallaries allowed them, to prevent corruption, and in some
recompense for the neglect of their private affairs, those of the popular
Assembly may have forty shillings per week, and those of the Senate may have
five hundred pound per annum, their pains, care, and expense, being to be
probably much greater, regard being also had to their quality, now if it
should not be provided in the foundation, that the Popular Assembly should not
assume the debate, it would come to an Anarchie; but Athens, which perished by
that means: and if the Senate should take upon them the result, it would soon
be an Oligarchy, (or Tyranny of a few) For they might with a Vote perpetuate
themselves, and govern the Nation according to their private interest; but both
Counsels can never agree to perpetuate themselves, for the popular Assemblies
Office, being not of profit, but burden, and being acpable when out of that
Office, to be chosen into the Senate, which is of more profit and authority,
it would be against their interest, which is the most certain Bond upon
Mankind) to perpetuate themselves, and the yearly change of a third in each
Councels, bringing the whole number by Successive Changes, so suddenly into
their private Capacities, to enjoy the Good, or suffer the harms of what is
done by the Council, in an equality with the whole people, it is of natural
impulse, that the whole Government, should be only according to the public
reason and interest, and cannot be imagined to deviate from the proper ends of
Government, neither can any Brazen-wall, be so firm and lasting, against the
private Interest and Pretense of Charles Stuart, as the moulding the people
into these Orders, there being no danger, that the Senate and people should
agree to de-throne themselves, to be yoaked by a Monarch: And we may safely
say, that no people formed into these Orders, if their number held any near
proportion to lie under Monarchy, were ever yet subdued by a Monarch, from the
beginning of the World, until this Day, unless they were first broken in
pieces by themselves, through some inequality in the Constitution of their
Orders, but mighty Monarchs have been often led Captives by such people.

The third Order, is the Magistracy, wherein some are Chief, some subordinate,
some Senatorian, some Popular, and are chosen accordingly, being all
changeable, at certain times, and wholly subject to the Laws and Order of the
Commonwealth. And the Office of these, is to execute impartially all the Laws
made as is before expressed. It is possible it may consist with the Common
Interest, to have one chief Magistrate, in whom the Title and Honor of the
Commonwealth, may reside in public Solemnities and addresses; So that no
public Action be left to his discretion, We shall not mention the Excellent
Order of Arms, that is the Consequence of Casting a People into this Form,
whereby they subsist, and become invincible by their own Armies, not by
Mercinaries. We only mention the first Form, wherein the Foundation of
Liberty to a people ought to be laid, that is by Establishing the Popular
Assembly, the Senate, and the Magistracy; these are Essential unto true
Liberty, the Superstructures have differed amongst several free People,
according to diverse accidents, We shall not presume so well of our selves as to
offer any Direction to your Lordship in them: but if God shall prepare your
heart for such a Work of Righteousness and Honor, we shall readily throw in
our Mite of Advice to your Treasury.

My Lord, We have now not only Cleared it to be your Lordships Duty, to make
us free, but showed wherein the Foundation of our Liberty must be laid, and
the ground is dug to your hand, the Lands being so distributed, that no one
Man, or small number of Men can overpower the whole People, by their
possessions, If we thought it needful to quicken your Affections to your
Duty, we could tell you from Reason and Experience how strangely such a
settlement of Liberty would transform the manners of the people; Luxury
would Change into Temperance, Haughtiness and Envy into Meekness, and
mutual Love and Emulation of Goodness, servilitie and baseness of mind,
into Nobleness and Generositie. Who would not follow Virtue for the Love? When
neither alliance, flattery or any Vice, could make great, but a General
Sentence from Popular Assemblies of Worth and Goodness, we might tell you it
would wash four Garments from the stains of blood, and the Armies honor from
the black reproach that now covers it, and above all the profession of religion
from scandal and infamy; this would show that you had nobler ends then yet the
world believes to be in Christians: If ambition pricks in your breast, for your
self or your brother; in thus doing you may set him upon a Throne more noble,
lofty, and commanding, then ever the Stuarts possessed or designed. His free
conjunction with your Lordship in this work may give him merit of greatness in
the souls of those that now disdain him, you may make your swords shine with a
radiant glory beyond those of Alexander and Caesar, whose honor was only the
same with that of the Plague and Pestilence to destroy mankind, yours may
restore liberty to England, and propagate it to mankind. And what should hinder
your Lordship, surely you can fear no resistance in giving the people their
right, when you feared none in many destructive attempts to their right and
freedoms, besides you have an Army whose interests, consciences, engagements,
yea their very passions and affections lead them this way, and in doing this
you may extinguish all fears, and secure against all plots, and make all
knowing men your voluntary vassalls in thankfulness for their liberty. But if
your private interest should blind your Lordships eyes, and lead you out of the
paths of mercy, righteousness and peace, to hew out a bloody way to empire
against the natural course of things. We believe it will not be long before
oppression and confusion, the consequences of such violent actings will extort
that from you, which with little more trouble then to moddle the elections for
a Parliament (as they ought) you might give us above to your eternal honor. So
wishing the God of mercy and peace to direct you, we remain

My Lord, Your affectionate servants in Christ.

FINIS.
