An Act for a Day of Public Thanksgiving to be observed throughout England
and Wales, on Thursday the First of November, 1649. Together with a DECLARATION
of the Grounds thereof.
THe great and wonderful Providence, wherein the Lord has eminently gone
forth in mercy toward this Nation, have been such, that howsoever many do shut
their eyes, or murmr against them, or at least refuse to join in Public
Acknowledgements, and Thanksgiving to Almighty God for the same; Nevertheless,
the Lord has been pleased to publish to all the world, That it is the work of
his own hand: Nor has his infinite goodness and favor been restrained to
England only, but extended to Ireland, which he has been pleased to remember
in its low estate; and when his People there were as dry bones, He has not
only revived them in a way almost as miraculous as a Resurrection from the
Dead, but been pleased to raise both them and us to a high pitch of hope, That
the Lord will go on to perfect his work in that Land, and make it likewise at
last a quiet Habitation for his People, and establish the power and purity of
the Gospel there. The consideration whereof, and of the Goodness and Power of
God in the late wonderful Victory, which he has been pleased to give unto the
Parliaments Forces there before Dublin (never to be forgotten) And the further
progress God has made in giving in Drogheda, a place of great Strength and
Consequence, defended by a considerable number of their prime Officers and
Soldiers, the particulars whereof are expressed in the Lord Lieutenants and
other Letters, lately Printed; and since that, by striking Terror into the
hearts of the Enemy, so as they have yielded up or deserted many other
considerable Castles and Garrisons, as Trym, Dundalk, Carlingford, the Newry,
and other Places, and some other additional Victories which God has cast in
since, cannot but make a deep impression on the hearts of all that fear the
Lord, and provoke them to exceeding Thankfulness and Rejoicing.

UPon consideration of all which, the Parliament out of their deep sense of so
great and continued Mercies, Have thought fit, as in duty to God, to set apart
a day for public and solemn Thanksgiving to the Lord, the Author of these
Mercies: And they do therefore Enact and Ordain, That Thursday the First of
November next, be kept as a day of public Thanksgiving to the Lord, in all
the Churches and Chapels, and places of Divine Worship within this
Commonwealth of England, Dominion of Wales, and Town of Berwick upon Tweed: And
that the Ministers of the respective Parishes and places aforesaid, be and
hereby they are required and enjoined to give public notice on the Lord's Day
next preceding the said First of November, of the day so to be observed, to the
end the People of their several Congregations may the more generally and
diligently attend the public Exercise of Gods Worship and Service, there to
be dispensed upon this occasion; At which time, that the People may be more
particularly and fully informed of this great Victory and Successes, the said
Ministers are hereby required to publish and read this present Act. And for the
better observation of the day, the Parliament does hereby inhibit and forbid
the holding or use of all Fairs, Markets, and servile works of men's ordinary
Callings upon that day: And all Majors, Sheriffs, Justices of the Peace,
Constables and other Officers, be and are hereby enjoined to take especial care
of the due observance of the said day of Thanksgiving accordingly.

Die Jovis, 11 Octobr. 1649.
ORdered by the Commons assembled in Parliament, That this Act be forthwith
printed and published.
