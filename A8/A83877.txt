Die Lunae 29. November. 1641.
WHereas several Certificates have been presented to this House, of sundry
Defaulters in payment of the sums assessed upon them by virtue of the Bill of
Polemoney, whereby it appears that great sums of money are in arrear, and not
paid in, as the Statute requires, to the great damage of the Common Wealth;
And whereas this House is informed that in diverse parts of this Kingdom great
partiality or connivence has been used in Assessing of this Polemoney in some
parts thereof by the Commissioners, and in other parts by the Assessors and
Certifiers, to the discouragement of such His Majesty's loving Subjects, who
have already most willingly paid in the several sums of money Assessed upon
them by virtue of the said Act: The House of Commons does declare and so order,
that the Collectors shall demand all sums of money in arrear, and not paid in
of the several parties Assessed, and shall accept no less then double the
value, according to the said Act, and shall return such as shall be in default,
that the House may take such order as they shall think fit: And the better to
expedite the business, this House has caused to be published one manner or
form of Certificate to be followed by the Commissioners in each City, Town,
County, Hundred, and Division, referring the sums of money, and the names of
the persons, with their Additionals, to be truly expressed by the said
Commissioners, according to the direction of the said printed Certificate, and
to return the same with all possible speed, to the end that all defaulters may
receive their condign punishment by censure of Parliament, according to their
delinquency, and direction of the said Statute: And the several sums of money
to be received are to be paid unto the several Treasurers of London and York
respectively, as they are appointed by the said Act, and a late Ordinance of
Parliament, as well upon the first Act, as upon Order of review.

Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty: And by the Assigns of John Bill. 1641.
