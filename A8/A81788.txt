in Power.

AS ALSO Petitional Motions unto the supreme Authority of this Nation, the
Parliament of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland, and the
Dominions and Territories thereunto belonging, that they would be pleased to
make use of the Proposer, in entertaining his abilities with Acts of
Parliament, according to the Laws of this and all Civil Nations; that then
thereby he may be empowered lawfully and honorably to put in exercise his
undertakings: The profitable Effects and Conveniences of them being hereafter
sufficiently proved and cleared.

All which Designs are undertaken to be performed by new ways and means, more
speedy, cheap and easy than has hitherto been discovered, and are acquired by

Of THOMAS DUCKET, Esquire

Very well deserving the perusal of persons of all degrees, that love
ingenuity, and the more flourishing prosperity of the Commonwealth.

LONDON, Printed by Thomas Leach, May the last, 1659.

The Preface.
May it please your Honors,
THe alterations in State affairs, and other occurrences, being so many as are
hereafter published, do therefore require this Preface or Introduction, whereby
to give satisfaction unto your Honors and all good people that have so long
expected the fruition of what is here tendered.

The Contents of all after repetitions giving sufficient proof and reason to
convince all Objections and cross Arguments; As also a Breviate of his Bills
as they were prepared by Council Learned in the Law, and afterward approved of
by Committees of a former Parliament, deputed for that purpose, who made their
report of the said Bills, as also of the Proposers ability to perform the
Contents therein contained, when they should be passed into Acts of Parliament.
And although the intent of all that is hereafter declared may seem tedious in
the perusal, yet questionless your Honors and all worthy Perusers will think
the time well spent, for that many Ages never had the like Tender, nor have
delayed such hopeful Successes; and therefore might have required a larger
Scope to demonstrate the great benefits this Nation might long before this time
have received, if that such causes as are after recited, had not obstructed the
Settlement.

And that your Honors may receive an Account from the Proposer why he does
expostulate, and drive so close and home against persons that he does conceive
to have been, and likely to be, Antagonists to such rich and transcendent
hopes; although no such person has as yet published himself in print to be an
Enemy to these new principles so held forth; for answer thereto I am to let
your Honors understand.

First, albeit none but of unreasonable impudence, and depraved nature, dare
let the world judge of their Folly, by subscribing their Names to such a
dangerous discomposure of a national benefit, notwithstanding their high pitch
in Envy; yet they dare vent their spightfull invectives against the Proposer in
malicious and contemptible frothy discourses behind his back; so that since his
first Addresses, which were many years ago, the Proposer has been subject to
the pressure of Multiplicity of provocations in several companies by spightfull
and perverse Detractors, in headless and absurd Arguments, especially by those
who have thought themselves pregnant and Powerful; and there can hardly be a
greater plague upon Earth, than to be liable to Evil Tongues, and Censures, as
the Proposer has always been, which cannot be redressed, for that the Company
of those self-conceited Critics, who will rail against any man's principles but
their own, are numerous, and it is better to have one, two, or three, of such
Malevolent spirits to answer unto, if they durst publish their Malignancy in
writing, than a thousand others, whom reason will not satisfy, but will at all
times, and in all companies, belch forth their spite and Envy against any
thing which exceeds their common capacities; but this many times turns to their
own disgrace and shame, when the Proposer discerns just cause to join in
contest with them, some part of their presumption arising from the Proposers
long delay in gaining an authority, to put in Execution what he has so long
held forth, and diverse other uncought Arguments, as barren of reason as that
aforesaid.

But the Proposers cause being just, does give him the advantage to master them
by Reason, and confute them by Arguments, so much as is sufficient to dash out
of Countenance any unbelieving Critics, Busybodies, Quibling Sophisters,
Pickthanks, trifling Ieerers, Buffoons, or froward Humorists, composed of
indigested Ignorance; and the virtue of those Truths, which the Proposer holds
forth, does so much out bear their brainsick Arguments, that it does increase
the Malevolency of their Spleens, to malign all his proceedings with Gall and
bitterness, which is the cause this relation is so fully proved, to give such
Evidence, as may convince them in behalf of the Commonwealth.

And therefore it is high time for the Proposer to apply himself to your
Honors for a speedy Settlement of the Premises, to the end that he may
perform such service to the Nation, as may quite extinguish all contradiction
by cavelling Detractors, especially those who are impudently resolved neither
to see or hear, although their own Conscience convince them, and bring them to
the unwor hy Odium in the old Proverb, being there is none so blind, as those
that will not see, and none so deaf, as those that will not hear.

And for this cause, by way of Address, the Proposer could present no less
than what does hereafter follow: for of necessity there must be the full
substance and property of his designs, with their proofs of performance, and
answers unto all self-ended Objections, and cavelling Expressions, touching the
commodity or discommodities of Improvements, together with the Prop^sers
justification of his person and reputation, and proofs and attestations of his
knowledge and abilities, as also of the high Degree and Magnitude of what he
has attained unto in Natures Storehouse, with many liberal applauses of the
virtue of his new Enterprises, and with more reiterations, than is usual in
repugning, and publicly defying persons that formerly have, and still may,
breath noisome Air against laudable Actions, that are above their Meridian, and
are thereby prodigious to their own good, and the Nations pleasure and plenty.

And also treating of the glory that your Honors may attain unto, by
entertaining these Tenders, which conduce to a national Improvement, and
therefore with good cause, humbly craving your Honors serious vi^w and rev^ew
of the Proposers real integrity in these works tendered, wherein your Honors
will discern just cause for all these ensuing expressions, and will thereby the
better be induced to hold excused, all the rehersals and recitals in this
dictate, that could not be explained without reiteration and repetition, to
introduce some addition of new matter, fit for observation, though much of
affinity with what has been aforesaid.

And although the full observation of the contents, and the many large promises
there^n contained, may unto the vulgar capacities seem ostentatious; Yet your
Honors prudence will on the contrary weigh them as they are, touching an
universal benefit, and that these new discoveries may be a preferment to the
Nation in general, or to Nations generally, and your Honors will perceive just
cause to confess, that the Theorical, Methoditical, and Practical proceedings
in renowned enterprises, ought to be supported with a more Magisterial
fulness in words, than can belong to the hope of gaining some small profit,
of little value, and short continuance: And therefore by your Honors cannot be
esteemed vain boasting: But if there should escape my pen some faulty branches,
yet I hope it may in wisdom by your Honors receive a pardon, according to the
Proverb, of giving a loser leave to speak, that has spent and disbursed the
best of his years and the best of his estate in this faithful service, and has
had no encouragement, or returns suitable to his merits, the which would nettle
the pen of any b^^ those Naturallists, who do study and observe the conditions
f men, with as much circumspection as they do the natures of Creatures,
Minerals, and Vegetatives, by which inspection, they have acquired so much
discretion as to slight and invalue those constitutions, whose natures want
true season, or some degrees of concoction, to operate in fulness of virtue
and knowledge, the which the Proposer does represent to your Honors, as a just
reason of the great pains and much patience the Proposer is driven unto, in
seeking means by all lenity to convince erroneous opinions, by offering all
manner of courtesy and civil argument, to their cursed contradictions, thereby
to calm them with Reasons, and satisfactory Arguments: for the Proposer has no
other way to qualify their Malice, unless it were in giving some of the
chiefest in pride and presumption, some special share and partnership, in the
honor and profit which ought to accrue unto the Pr^poser and his posterity, by
virtue of those Trophies, that Nature and Industry has endowed him withal.

And therefore for quietness sake, and a more easy proceeding, that the way
may be cleared of all such interruptions to a national good, The Proposer could
have willingly thereunto condescended, but that the Heralds at Arms, and other
honorable Antiquaries, would have thereby just cause to take Recognizance of
the Proposers Transgressions, as to the disgrace of his Name, Descent, and
Pedigree, whereof he is so sensible and tender, that whenever he does make
room for such a blot against his Friends, and falsity against himself, then let
those Officers aforesaid, join in defacing his ancient Coat of Arms, by
creating the Emblem of some corrupt vermin or beast of prey, to be placed
upon the Authors ancient Coat of Arms, The Crest belonging to the Arms of
Ducket, is an Ostrige feather gules environed in a Crownet of Gold.
instead of the present Crest, as an allusion that he so unworthily submitted
to pragmattick greedy persons fraighted with Avarice, but empty of Goodness,
and that Falsehood had overcome Truth, contrary to the known Maxim.

And thus the Proposer in his faithful indulgence to your Honors, and the
weal public, could not possibly say any thing less, than what is herein, and
in the ensuing Relation to be expressed, the length and prolixity whereof, he
hopes will be the rather dispensed withal, because that things of so large and
general a concernment, could not without prejudice and Injury to the matter be
wound up and concluded in so concise a brevity as proceedings of small
consequence; yet all the contents require not above the twelfth part of a
Natural day to be perused, scanned, and considered of; But because many persons
cannot admit of so much time to peruse the whole, the Proposer thought it
necessary to give some good part of satisfaction in every page, or leaf; the
contents whereof, with all humble submission, the Proposer referrs to your
Honors great wisdoms, as also what may seem improper or imperfect in this
dictate, or the Printers mistakes, the Proposer does likewise submit, having
already too much entrenched upon your Honors patience, who are further to be
used in the premises and; therefore, what ever else ought to have been said,
yet in good manners, and order, there must no more be said, but only that the
Proposer in all constant faithfulness is resolved to be,

Your Honors in all devout and devoted Obedience, Thomas Ducket:

A Narrative of the Proceedings of Thomas Ducket Esquire etc.
THat the said Thomas Ducket, The Proposers undertaking.
by his great charge and study in Natures operation, has (by Gods assistance)
discovered several rich, and profitable Secrets, Arts and Mysteries, for the
Improvement of all sorts of Land, by destroying of all sorts of Weeds, Trash,
Shrubs, and other Encumbrances, Raising of Waters, Creating of a new soil or
manure; Together with more expeditions cheap and easy actions, and motions to
perform the same; And likewise for the improvement of Leather of all sorts, in
excellency and perfection of Strength, Grain, and Color, being designs of
great honor and plenty for English People.

The Real performance of which Inventions, first as to Land, The reality of his
inventions for land attested by many persons of honor and quality.
was testified by Certificates under the hands of many persons of Honor and
quality of several Counties unto you the Right Honorable Members of this
present Parliament, not long before your Honors were disturbed, being in April
the 23. 1653. for before those accidents, and alterations in State, your
Petitioner did daily solicit the worthy and most renowned members of this
Parliament then sitting, that they would be pleased to peruse and take into
consideration in the House, the Bill he had prepared by Council learned in the
Law, to be passed into an Act for improvement of Land. But multiplicity of
State Affairs (as it seemed) or else new inventions in these Septe^trional
Countries seeming strange, New inventions being a wond^r to the apprehension of
some people has been a chief remora.
or else National Malediction did retard the settlement of such good fortune,
notwithstanding the exact and clear descriptions of the particulars, and the
confirmation of many honorable and worthy persons as aforesaid, who attested,
and largely satisfied your Honors of the Proposer's ability to perform his
undertakings: yet nevertheless your Honors not putting a dispatch to so great
a National advantage, occasioned a doubtfulnesse in the Proposer, lest his
public tenders, amongst the generality of people, might be reflected on him as
nothing but pretenses; and that he were not able to set forth any additional
thing that were rich, and good for improvement of Land, more than what former
ages, and present time had, or have produced. And there upon the Pro^oser,
minding the good of his Native Country, and the honor of his own reputation,
to avoid all jealousies, mistakes, and controversies of any doubtful, captious
persons, who through their own imbecility might conceit that what he had so
held forth were but a superficial show, without any reality at all; or if he
were a master of such skill, No cause of neglecting so good a tender, for three
reasons.
that then it was bottomed beyond the reach of ordinary understanding, and so
deep, that it did require long consid^ration, and State policy to discern the
depth, scope and center thereof; although the case is evident, clear, and void
of all suspicion and controversy, and would be speedily embraced in any
Southern Nation, for these three reasons, viz.

First, for that it cannot choose but be a universal benefit to any Nation.

Secondly, because no Statesman, nor any belonging to them, or any other
person, shall be charged with any cost, trouble, or damage, until he have a
full knowledge, and possession of the skill.



Therefore to prevent these and such doubts, suppositions, and other
obstructions, the Proposer having long since by his studies in the mysteries of
Nature, acquired a most strange, and unheard of secret, never before
discovered, in this or former ages, which is of so high a degree of
Consequence, in richness, and rarity of art, The Proposer to convince all
dubious minds, and to make known his ability in Land, did demonstrate his skill
in the mystery of Leather.
that for the convincing of all erroneous minds, thoughts and words, as to his
ability in knowledge, He did by his new inventions, convert many score of raw
hides, and skins into leather, without Bark of Oaks, Ash, or any other formerly
used ingredients; as also did make leather of a more rich and profitable
condition, than ever yet was known, by assisting, and bettering of all former
known practices, with new means, and additional ingredients, and liquors to be
mixed and compounded with bark of Oaks, and all others formerly used, which is,
and may be performed easier, speedier, and with less charge than formerly:
which did, does, and may demonstrate his knowledge to be far more profound, and
beyond the reach of all sorts of Artificers, although they have been Masters of
such practice as has ever been by tradition used since this part of the world
was civil^zed.

The excellent perfection which the Proposer has attained unto in the said art
and mystery. The clearness of the proposers skill and ability.
Yet notwithstanding the highest degree of perfection that they have attained
unto by their long practice, by way of emblem and pattern, to make an
uncontradictable certainty in the judgment of all wise and judicious persons,
the Proposer having achieved the knowledge, did produce that most admirable
Masterpiece for all that are concerned in Leather, that thereby your Honors,
and the world may know, that his reach and understanding in improvement of the
fertility of all sorts of lands, does, and may in all likelihood in the
particulars of his intended discoveries, as much surmount the practice of any
Actors, and Authors in Husbandry.

And upon these grounds the Proposer took the pains to demonstrate the great
Mystery for Leather, before he had any Act for the improvement of land: but if
an Act for improvement of land had been granted, his actions had been so
significant to the purpose, beyond what is practiced by others, as would have
induced such a full belief with your Honors, or any other supreme persons
authorized, that his own promise and assertion, would have supported his
undertakings as to Leather, to be of such current truth, that his pains in
setting forth a demonstration of tanning of Leather according to the new
mystery, might have been spared as a needless impertinency.

The Proposers good will to benefit his native Country, did cause him to
neglect no opportunity to get a settlement of his business.
But the Proposer observing the variety of minds, and tempers of people, and
changes of government, with the like, did hold it necessary to make the world
sensible of his abilities by those actions, as aforesaid, and then when he had
created so good a belief, it had been a great want of prudence and good mind in
the Proposer, if he should have neglected his addresses to any supreme
Authority that next ensued your Honors. First, in regard that he was stricken
in years: Next, because he had a great zeal to lend his assistance to help his
own Native Country, before any foreign Nation, and some other causes supported
by the rule of discretion, occasioned him in an elaborate way to make his
addresses unto every sort of supreme Authority, from the dissolution of your
Honors as aforesaid until this present time; and that he might be more certain
of gaining an authority for the exercising of what he so held forth, he first
cleared all doubts and queries by significant demonstration of several parcels
of Leather so tanned and tawed; and likewise by certificates thereupon from
most of the chief Tanners, and other tradesmen as to Leather, of several
Counties in and about London, to his late Highness Oliver Lord Protector, and
his Council, and likewise to the Committee for trade, then in power, the which
Committee by order summoned a numerous company of Tanners, and other tradesmen
as to Leather, to give their approbation, and testimony of the said Leather,
the which persons so summoned, did not only under their hands, but likewise
themselves in person, affirm and testify of the goodness of the said Leather,
and of the ability of the said Thomas Ducket to perform his undertakings, and
of the great benefit that would arise thereby to the three Nations, and
earnestly requested a speedy settlement of the premises.

By the means of which proceedings, His late Highness Oliver Lord Protector's
grant of Patents.
his late Highness Oliver Lord Protector with his Council were so fully
satisfied herein, that his Highness forthwith granted the said Thomas Ducket
two several Patents for the sole exercise and benefit of his said inventions
for improvement of Land and Leather for fourteen years; which upon
consideration, and perusal by the said Thomas Ducket's Counsel in the Law, they
were found not to be of sufficient power and validity to make him a secure
title, by reason of the multitude of the people he was to deal with, as to
land, and certain Statutes, and especially some Statutes as to Leather,
prohibiting the use of any other liquors or ingredients, but Bark of Oaks, and
other ingredients then in use, and limiting set times in Tannage; the maker of
such Statutes (by all likelihood) not imagining that any better way or
invention could be found out, by the means whereof it proved this nations
unhappiness, Reasons why the said Patents were of no validity.
to be suppressed, delayed, and hazarded in the hope of the accommodation of
those rich and precious benefits that might then speedily have ensued by power
of Broad-Seal Patents, if those foresaid old acts had not frustrated the
progress and exercise of the premises.

For although it fell out, that those old bars in Law proved to be against
the law of right and reason, yet nevertheless there was no remedy to avoid the
same, although it were to the daily loss and prejudice of the people, and must
have so continued, until the errors of those former Parliament laws were
through the prudence of some new Parliament-Magistrates, discerned, deserted,
and repealed, to make way for better opportunities, and then the Proposer by a
Parliamentary act empowered.

And upon these, and some other accounts and procrastinations, the said Thomas
Ducket was in reason necessitated to forbear the discovery of his designed
intentions, and so did until there was a Parliament assembled at Westminster,
in September 1656. where then the Proposer after addressing himself and his
cause unto them, then after sufficient debate, and through the virtue of
several Certificates from many worthy Patriots conducing to land, as also the
new testimony of his late Highness Oliver Lord Protector and his Council, as
to Land and Leather, as also the Certificate of the chiefest Tanners, The
Tanners address and certificates to the Parliament and Committees for Trade,
of the Proposers ability
and other tradesmen as to Leather, recommended unto the said Parliament,
together wi^h the appearance of numerous companies of Tanners, and other
dealers in Leather, at several times, did make their personal address unto the
whole body of the house of Parliament in that behalf, and also when occasion
required did present themselves at other times, unto several Committees of
Parliament, and at last through very much inveterate trouble, perplexity,
tediousness incident to English Proceedings; afterward this ensuing report
was made in answer to a grand Committee of that Parliament, by power of an
Order granted by them unto a Sub-Committee, the words being thus returned, viz.

The Report.
The report of a Committee of Parliament.
IN observance of an Order of this Committee, bearing date the 23. day of
December last, we have examined, and considered of the proposals and new
inventions of Thomas Ducket Esquire for the improvement of all sorts of lands, and
also for the converting all sorts of raw hides, and skins into leather, without
Bark of Oaks, or other usual ingredients; and upon conference with him, his
reasons and demonstrations has given us good satisfaction, as well of his
abilities, as of the benefit that may come to this Commonwealth thereby, and we
are the more induced to believe the same, for that his Highness and Council
have certified on his behalf, and l^kewise many other persons of worth and
quality in several Counties to the same effect.

And we do farther report, that we have supervised his bills for improvement of
Lands and Leather, and have made many alterations and restrictions therein, and
do humbly conceive that the said Thomas Ducats undertakings deserve all due
encouragement, that this Commonwealth may enjoy the benefit thereof.

Dated the 1. of May. 1657 The Committee consisted of 5 or 6 but any three of
two were empowered to report. Henry Pickering. Richard Timbs. Robert West.




The bills likewise prepared by the said Commi tee. Sir Henry Pickering ordered
to move it in the house.
After the return of this report from the Sub-Committee unto the Grand
Committee, together with the two bills for Land and Leather, as they were
prepared and made fit to be enacted, it was then resolved, and so ordered by
that Grand Committee, that the then Henry Pickering Esquire now Henry Pickering
Knight, one of the Sub-Committees (whose name is unto the said report) should
with all convenient speed, wait the House daily for an opportunity, and there
to move the Right Honorable Speaker Sir Thomas Widdringto^, to give way for
the publication of those bills so prepared; and the said Honorable Speaker was
made acquainted therewith, who was very writing to give way to the said Sir
Henry Pickerings motion, in causing the bills to be read, and he in his loyalty
and goodness to the Wealpublick (being well satisfied of the proposers ability,
and the great advantage that hereby might arise to the Nation) was contented to
assist those proceedings; and rather then the business should receive any delay
by the motion of Sir Henry Pickering, he was honorably pleased that those
bills should be moved as private bills by himself; Cause why the business was
not settled.
but just at the time when most of the Members were acquainted with these
Proceedings, and were in a readiness to give audience as to a settlement, then
it so pleased God that the said Thomas Ducket was visited with sickness, so
that he could not attend the House, but was forced to let his business lie
dormant and proceed no farther; in which time of his sickness, the Parliament
was first adjourned, and after their next sitting suddenly dissolved; And now
through providence your Honors (with whom were my first proceedings and
addre^es) being reinvested with the Power and Authority, from whence this
Nation may receive those fortunate successes which are to be presented by the
Proposer, who has the good fate once more to make his Addresses to your
Honors, although at present your Honors are full of public employment, The
designs are of so great worth that they merit the result of the Parliament,
more than any other business except the security of the Nation.
yet the Proposer well knowing (that setting aside the security of the Nation)
there is not any thing in the House in agitation, that may better advance a
flourishing plenty to your Honors and the people, than the entertainment of
the premises, which in the peircing eye of Prudence, is a most notable,
precious, public business, and cannot be denied in the Reason, Judgment, and
Wisdom of your Honors, although this Nation is haunted with some injurious
ignorant persons, that will not stick to affirm it to be but a private
business, in regard that the Owner, Founder, and Messenger of this mystery,
lays claim (according to the Law of Nations) to be gratified for fourteen years
with some small diminutive reward; whose penurious unworthy conditioned
language, Sordid Calumniations by Detractors.
or customary equivocation to quibble this Land out of a Success and Character,
must needs consist of a pestiferous malediction to all ingenuity, insomuch that
they do endeavor to blast the glorious Law of National requital of laborious
Masters in profitable new discoveries, with the odium of Monopolies, And other
Cavillations.
unless that such invertors of rich enterprises and high discoveries, do give
the honor and profit thereof, unto the Members of State, and be content to
stand unto their reversion; and questionless there are many, that will whisper
some great m^n to that purpose, although those so whispered cannot but discern,
that they, with those pickthank Flatteries, would fain allure Magistracy, into
a Monopolizing those atchievments which they never sought nor sweat for. And if
your Honors do by Argument and Reason contradict those Motioners, as to a
course improper, yet they, or such as they are, will start some other quaery,
saying, Why should not the Inventor disclose all his skill and manner of
action, as well as demonstration (unto some great Members of Parliament) in
every particular, Reasons that the Proposers undertakings are not to be
discovered to any Members of Parliament, or others, without a settlement first
granted.
before that he has an Act passed? And that it were good policy in any
Committee to urge and press the Proposer home to that point. Now then, when any
of your Honors do reply, (as questionless you may and will) That, if that the
skill were made known to any Members of State, that then, they the said Members
are bound, by virtue of their trust, to publish all politic profits to the
Nation, without any imposition of payment for any skill, that is beforehand
made known, unto their representative, who, by receiving such intelligence from
the Inventor, were thereby disabled to make a Law to that effect: And that the
Master of those Mysteries may better dispense with the breach of promise unto
his particular;
than the whole Nation with the trust reposed in any of its Members. A
discovery in reason not to be requested before the settlement.
Again it may be answered (questionless) that the Proposer will not yield unto
any such thing, in that the likelihood of the profits of his discoveries, do
far surmount (as to the benefit of the Commonwealth) the value of ten,
twenty, or forty Gentlemen's Estates, setting their places or power aside: And
again, that those persons that are studious in any mental mysteries, and are of
perfect knowledge therein, doubtless are so Judicious, that they will not
deliver their principles to the possession of others upon any such
uncertainties, The inconvenience that may arise to the Proposer and others by
making a discovery to any without an Act.
nor will they be guided in any unstable course, for fear of losing their
benefits, and making themselves a simple President to other Authors and
Founders; neither will it become Members of State (in point of honor of the
whole house) to motion any design unto the Proposer concerning his inventions,
wherein there were any doubt of hazard; and for him the Proposer, to submit to
such adventures, is too much below the Honor of a person so endowed.

And thus with trouble and woeful experience, the Proposer is able to
Characterize the disserviceable part of those puzzling Inc^ndiaries, that out
of rancour will endeavor to forestall all good actions and intentions, whereby
your Honors may easily discern, that their prating and practice has a great
affinity, with the skill and artifice of Achitophel; these their agitations
plainly showing, that such persons are none of those godly wise men, What kind
of persons Detractors are, and from whence their natures are, and what is
predominate over them, and what they are addicted to.
who, as the Scripture says, do command the stars; For certainly, these
wretches, for want of Grace, do permit malevolent planets to predominate over
them, even to the naturalizing of their minds, to the love of mischief to
others, and the impoverishing of all but themselves, they being owners of some
small heap of drossie substance, so much as does advance and support them so to
overlook other men's matters as to breed disturbances, controversies, and
cruelties, or else they would not project, and monopolize so many insolences,
to divert the Settlement of Plenty.

And certainly those that have been adverse to these proceedings are none of
the wisest, in seeking to hinder themselves from the good success of
profitable inventions atcheived by ingenuity; it may be they may be witty,
crafty, subtle, and inplacably politic, but yet want Judgment to discern,
that there is no profit on the face of the earth, that takes his first
entrance of settlement, with so little charge and pains as new discovered
mysteries; For in all sea practices and proceedings, and all land affairs and
actions, the events require charge, time, venture, loss and hazard, No person
at one penny charge in settling the discovery but the Proposer.
and many times ill success does cross those enterprises: But in the entrance
of these proceedings, to accommodate the Nation with knowledge, there is not
one penny loss, not a sheet of paper to any Clerk, nor fee to a subordinate
Officer, but what must and shall be satisfied by the Proposer, after that your
Honors have breathed out the concluding vote of an Act for the establishment.

It has been reported, that Charles the fifth Emperor, and Philip of Spain
called by his Subjects Philip the wise,
and other Monarchs great in wisdom and power, said, it was very fitting that
if it did so fall out that any person relating to them, did pretend a new
discovery of any new Art or Science, or profitable Manufactory, if it were
tendered without a charge, or cost at first entrance and entertainment thereof,
that all such affairs should be lovingly embraced by all men of reason, first
for avoiding the discouragement of industry, Secondly, for that if any one
rarity of new skill, or but any part of a special skill prove current,
feasible, laudable, and profitable to a Commonwealth, then if one of twenty
such proffers did thrive effectually and prosperously, the trouble of
Settlement was recompensed more than an hundred times treble; yet this
Proposers designs being many, and several, and also visible and perfect, to the
eyes of sense, and ears of understanding, and as freely proffered without any
cost as can be expected, have been retarded in the settling, by the means of
such persons as have, and will, if they may be permitted and believed, still
endeavor to stupifie the ears of Authority with false pleadings, to the great
loss and inconvenience of the people, and instead thereof gain the Nation a
disgrace, being a rhing very unreasonable and shameful.

Now if these Emblems of the seditious and spightful blasters of the blossoms
and flowers of welfare, will not abate their cross resolutions, A caution not
to regard such Calumniators.
then may they range where they please, and sow tares where they list, provided
that your Honors will vouchsafe, to make it one of your principal businesses
to supervise the laborious works and producements of the Proposer, with more
eager conspicuity than formerly, and then he is confident your Honors shall
find his performances, to be a sufficient antidote against the putrified Air of
those, by whose breath tares (as aforesaid) and other weeds and land
impediments would be continued and increased, if your Honors prevent it not,
The Proposer stands upon his credit and reputation in justification of his
business.
and take hold of occasion, and contemn such peevish Critics, in owning these
proposals as a public business of Parliament, whose profitable effects to the
Nation may well support it with the true title of the same, although the
Proposer will not exclude himself, and the name of Ducats, of that Honor and
share that the Laws of God and Man affords them, which must be so if he would
complie with an Ignoramus to himself and Friend, in disclaiming a moderate
satisfaction, which no way can arise unto him and them by any false, uncouth,
sinister, delusion or evasion, as will presently be made manifest for
satisfaction of your Honors, and for calming the boisterous tempestuous winds
of all that are envious, needy, greedy or factious, unless (the Author of all
mischief) be in it.

Certainly all opposites (though never so ill minded to others) would gladly

favors and Friendships, with a full recompense for any good service, if they
be of a capacity in any of these (as seldom they are) and according to that the
Proposer does but expect to be respected with some little and mean requital,
far beneath the desert of his great service to the Commonwealth, in which
Proceedings no man can be jealous of any falsehood, whereby he might delude, and
draw the Nation to raise him a profit far transcending the benefit of his
discoveries during the fourteen years; for if his designs are of little
consequence, small profit, and hardly of any use, then has he with disgrace
lost all his former time, and charge, yet none but himself damnifi^d. And if
they prove moderately profitable, and prosperously worthy of use, The Proposers
reward will be according to the merit of his designs.
and of some sufficient benefit, then will the shape, size, and quantity of his
reward be suitable according to the beneficial assistance the Weal-publick
receives. But if his designed discoveries should prove to be of a most vast
value in additional honor to your Honors, and a wealthy prosperity to the
Commonwealth, then by a true rule of proportion, a fair and fitting
well-deserved honor, If his designs prove suc^^^efull and good his (...) ought

and large recompense the Proposer does conceive himself (against the World) to
be a meritorious deserver of. And if the numerous small compositions for
Licenses from all that make use of his discoveries should arise to great sums
or Mulcts, yet in despite of contradiction the performer is a well deserving
owner thereof, and questionless will show himself as able in distribution of
what he has gained, upon charitable good ways and uses, The (...)
as he was industrious in atchieving and accomplishing the possession of the
same; for who does know but that he is naturally addicted unto the relief of
the poorer sort, and the practice of laudable actions therewith in some eminent
degree of Religious pious charity, such as may be as great a president in good
works, and gracious liberality, as he has been studious in advancing welfare
and plenty.

A strange case that such wealthy designs should be retarded by detracting
self-ended people. The Proposer will not subject himself to any disgrace, to be
a discouragement to ingenious persons for the future. The P^oposers good will
to benefit his Native Country demonstrated by keeping so long his secrets
undiscovered to foreign Nations. The Proposers studies and natural inclinations
considered, why may not God bless this Nation as well as others to breed a
person of remarkable parts fit perpetually to be m^morized?
Is it not then strange that upon these weak bars of persons indigent in
discretion, or the like incidences, or Epitomies of envy and wretchedness as
are before described, that the Proposers designs might then be raised to the
high name of a special public business, and not otherwise? This is very rigid
in those that would endeavor to have your Honors adhere therewith, but must
necessarily be a great debasing of the Proposers discretion, and very much
beneath any Naturalist that has achieved to perfection in smaller mysteries,
and therefore he cannot submit to such an ignominy, without a foul scorn and
disdain therein to be guilty, as also by such actions to become a discourager
of any Academick, or other ingenuous persons, who in this, or ensuing ages,
shall, or may attain unto eminent knowledge in the mysteries of nature, or the
like.

The P^oposer hops, that he deserves better things than these intricacies of
his native Country, in reference to his good intentions of their future
prosperity, as also his care of their honor, they being so dilatory in the
settlement of their own welfare. Yet has the Proposer hitherto had the
patience not to send his discoveries into any other Nation, although often
solicited to that purpose by several agents of those foreign parts, that would
have raised thereby their own riches, and advanced their pleasure in farther
laughter and derision at the people of this Nation, for slighting and letting
pass the opportunity of every new renowned enterprise.

For it has been noted, that many nations and territories of the world have
produced some persons of singularity in all arts, sciences, faculties and
callings, and all derived from the Meridian of invention; the which illustrious
excellence of persons renowned, have adorned most part of the universe with the
splendent glitter of glorious discoveries, their names and qualities needing no
recital; for that no intelligible person is ignorant of their particular
excellence, in Wisdom and Knowledge; and seeing that it has pleased God to
bless other parts of the world with messengers of transcendent gifts, why then
should England be obnoxious to their own honor and profit in neglecting the
employment of the Proposer? whose intellectuals were ever naturally from the
spring of his youth, addicted to the love of profitable rarities, and new
inventions in the Theorick part of Elements and temperaments, and the methods
of practice, with as much willingness to enrich his native Country, in
resembling former founders of high and mighty things. Yet with all humble
obedience in his submissive apprehension, he has aimed and endeavored at
knowledge, with as much earnestness and eagerness as to his undertakings are
recited, with as faithful intention, as any of those surmounting persons that
acquired to much fame and glory to themselves and their Native Countries. The
which your honors may experimentally know by making use of the Proposer, who
is able to fill up the room and places left void and barren, with the fullness
of skill, and better advantage in husbandry, and other mysteries and
manufactories which were left at too low a gage of perfection by former
discoverers; the which may by virtue of the Proposers care be more perfectly
established and settled, and thereby as he has had place, liberty and room left
him for such performance that others could not do: so when he shall have
perfected what hitherto has been left undone in the premises, he certainly
then shall justly merit a place of remembrance in those lists and rolls in
which learned Authors and Historians have recorded the honor and dignity of
former renowned Discoverers, the which preferment is one of the guerdons
desired by Naturalists, they having felicity in fame beyond the possession of
Riches.

Now if these motives of truth and reason may occasion these humble motions to
be in some convenient time dispatched and settled, The great honor and profit
which the honorable Members of Parliament will attract by a speedy settlement
of the premises.
then will your Honors be made famous with the glory of all those prosperous
agitations and descriptions, together with all sort of satisfactions, which are
at large described in this ensuing address; to the end that your Honors may
be fully satisfied of those rich land affairs, whose wealthy income will in
many degrees surmount the indigency which this Nation is often incident unto;
and the real assurance thereof will appear more evident by your Honors perusal
of this following description, whereof this first part has relation unto,
which will in truth and reason outbear all misconstructions, sordid suggestions
and pretenses, and all such malign Incendiaries, as do, as aforesaid, endeavor
to divert the laudable intentions of the most renowned Magistrates, Any
Honorable Member of Parliament may receive ample satisfaction in the premises
in less than an hours time.
from settlement of any great and public good or benefit, which is like to
ensue to the Commonwealth in general, and to the particular honor of those who
intend to be the chief promoters thereof, who may receive ample satisfaction by
proof, as to Land, and experimental demonstration as to Leather, arguments to
opposition, and response to queries in all the aforesaid passages in about an
hours time, if cause there be that any Honorable Member require the same.

And now the Proposer having given a sufficient account of his proceedings,
humbly craveth your Honors favor to spare a small time in perusal of what is
hereafter to be said; which questionless will induce as great a willingness
in all worthy Patriots to countenance, and further a speedy settlement of the
premises, for the benefit of their respective Countries, as was performed by
his late Highness Oliver Lord Protector, and prudent Council, in their grant
of Patents, as was before expressed. And by such a settlement the Proposer will
be cleared of the Aspersions of various censurers, who often make doubts and
suggestions by reason of the Proposers many expressions and writings, and that
he has been so long in performance of what he has held forth; Reasons why
there has hitherto been no performance of what is held forth.
not considering that it was diverse Alterations in State, Bars in Old Laws,
Mortality of some gracious Friends to good works, Sickness in the Proposer, and
sundry other procrastinations, which hindered and delayed the prosecution, and
actual performance of the premises, and not any failing, or disability in the
Proposer, who has followed his agitations with so much eagerness, that it has
stirred up many detractors, who out of envy to such high undertakings, breath
out trifling susurrations against the Proposers person and undertakings;
Depravers objections answered.
and others ambitious not to be outstript in Ingenuity, or to see another man's
increase of honor, express and cast forth strange, and uncouth prevarications,
with private emulations, that if not discerned, might corrode the hold this
Nation might take of this present opportunity, in advancing their greater
plenty, which they themselves might live to see, after authority is granted to
the Proposer, and other Nations prevented in their hope of Englands declination
thereof, as they have formerly done Columbus, and many other Ministers of
profit, which in this case would appear more strange, for that the charge of
acting, performing, publishing,
and giving possession of the premises, will come clear to the Nation, without
the cost of one penny, and the charge incident to the settlement will be very
little: and moreover the Proposer will carry on his designs and undertakings,
until they be clearly discovered, at his own charge; for he stands upon the
points of his reputation, and just meaning in these particulars, and all
others, as he has done all his life time, The Proposer renounces all bye ends
or favor, other than a legal settlement.
(if not mistaken) and renounces all benefit from any person in the world, in
reference to his undertakings, with as much detestation as is proper to the
most worthy Obliging person in the world, or any favor, other than that Law of
fourteen years privilege, for the Exercise of his Inventions, as is peculiar
in such Cases, for the encouragement of all those who by their Studies and
Endeavors, have attained unto high and laudable discoveries in Elemental
mysteries.

And as much as lies in the power of the Proposer, touching himself and his
designs, the people of this Nation shall not be guilty of the first president
of ingratitude, and suppression of any flourishing prosperity, which might
illustrate the glory of this and other Nations: Therefore God forbid that the
arguments of self-ended and detracting persons, or any such that want parts to
understand Mysteries; or vulgar wits, that love old customs or dull actions,
more than profit; or spleeny Cynicks, who will speak against all things, and
like nothing but what they do themselves; or any such opposites, who may now
make it their business to obstruct the Proposers proceedings; What mischief
Depravers may do in a Nation.
should divert, and prevail with your Honors, to let such an Emolument and
Ornament of a Nation fall to the ground; especially considering that Store can
be no Sore, and that there is sufficient need for profitable supply, and no
want of lawful power of prudent Magistrates; and under favor of your Honors,
no lack of serenity or ability in the Proposer, to give his Native Country the
first Livery and Seisin of those rich inventions, wherewith he is endued.
Neither are there any bars in Law, or any obstacles to blind the Nation from
the lively view thereof, but only the damp and foggy air arising from dullness,
or the dark clouds of brow-bent malice, or the faithless, fruitless blastings
of incredulity, or such like ill-aspected motions; unless that any such
barking and bawling depravers, can face to face, before the Honorable Members
of Parliament, disprove, or make appear any thing against the faithful
Integrity, Skill, Knowledge, Person, Parts or Undertakings of the Proposer: but
if such persons shall not ground their opposition on Truth and Reason, but
think to bear it out with a liberty derived from falsehood and ignorance, they
will find themselves deceived, and in danger to run the hazard of bringing a
lasting disgrace and Odium upon themselves, The Proposers defiance to such
Depravers.
for unworthily endeavoring to obstruct and hinder the increase of such honor
and fertility, as might be advanced to the enriching of your Honors Treasury,
and the Commonwealths future happiness and prosperity. And by this means the
expectation of all worthy persons, may be satisfied; the Pest of envy,
antidoted; the Author, and all other persons studious in good works,
encouraged; your Honors, eternally magnified; and this our Air and Climate
purged of all the contagious infections of Spirits Malevolent to high and
worthy principles; wherein they have not abilities of apprehension to discern
the various mysteries of Nature, which the vast world plentifully affords
unto all those who are serious Observers of her Essence and Deity, and diligent
Searchers into the Multiplicity of her Natural Effects and Causes, with her
other Contingencies: which the Proposer all his life time having been studious,
and conversant in, has attained to the knowledge and perfection, chiefly of
these ensuing Designs, and many others not herein expressed: which if
hereafter entertained and settled, may as well as the rest, be very
advantageous to the Commonwealth.

The particular Heads of which Inventions, contained in the Bills
aforementioned, for the Improvement of all sorts of Land and Leather, are as
follows;
FIrst, The said Thomas Ducket undertaketh to take away for ever, 1. The
Proposers undertakings for Land. To destroy all manner of Tr^sh.
the greatest part of the prejudice and damage which is caused in Land, of
several sorts, by reason of Heath or Ling, Fearn or Brakes, Rushes, Sedges,
Reeds, Thistles, Nettles, Moss, Broom, Furze or Gorse, Brambles, Briars,
Blackthorns, and other Encumbrances, destructive to the growth and goodness of
Corn and Grass, or prejudicial and hurtful to Pasture, Meadow, and arable
Lands.

Secondly, To improve, and enrich the value and goodness of Land, 2. To
improve Shallow Soil.
where the Turf is shallow by reason of Gravel, Sand, Rock, Clunch or Chalk,
lying too near the Superficies of the Earth, that there is not a sufficient
depth of Soil to be plowed; so that it is altogether unprofitable Land for
Corn, neither will it bear any considerable quantity of Grass. The which
Improvement is and may be performed, without the usual great charge and pains
of carrying Lime or Dung of Cattle upon the same.

Thirdly, To keep a great part of all hilly, dry, rising grounds, by water, 3.
To keep moist hilly dry grounds.
more moist and fertile; not with any great chargeable Engines, Leaden Pipes,
Pumps, or any sort of Mills or Water houses, or any new way now in practice, or
held forth; but by ways and means slight, cheap and easy, by ordering of Lands
in various shapes, figures, and proportions, for compassing, and gainecoping
the drift and course of Waters; and by Engines and Instruments of small value,
from five shillings price, unto five pounds and upwards, portable for either
man, horse, or cart, according to their several sizes, as the depth of the
water, and the height of the ground shall require; which will carry up, and
gain advantage of waters so much, as thereby Lands may be soakned, and kept
more moist and fertile, and dry places in Summer may be supplied with water.

Fourthly, To make a sort of rich Soil fit for Agriculture, 4. To fertilize
Land with a new Manure.
and Manuring of ground, much of the nature and effects of Lime, or Dung of
Cattle, where Lime or Dung of Cattle is scarce, and is to be performed with
small charge and pains.

ANd also the said Thomas Ducket undertaketh, (whereas Bark of Oaks, Ash, The
Proposers undertakings for Leather.
Sumack, Galls, Salt and Allom, being the principal ingredients now used in
Tannage, are very scarce and dear, and likewise harsh and corrosive) To
discover and teach all Tradesmen as to Leather, a profound Art and Mystery,
never before practiced in this Commonwealth;

First, to make Leather without any the Liquors or Ingredients now in use, 1.
To tanne Leather without Bark, etc.
in shorter time, and with less charge, far to exceed all former Tannage, in
excellency of Grain and Color; and more lasting, firm and substantial, fit for
all manner of service, according to the nature, sizes, and degrees of the hides
and skins so Tanned and Tawed.

Secondly, If any Tradesman as to Leather, be desirous for custom sake, or
some other private ends or reasons, still to make use of Bark, or any other
Ingredients, now in practice; To make Leather by mixing his new Ingredients
with the old.
The Liquors and Ingredients invented and found out by the said Thomas Ducket,
are of such virtue and quality, that if by his directions some of them be mixed
and compounded with the former used Ingredients, they will make far better
Leather, and in shorter time, than is, or can be made, by the only and single
use of Bark, Sumack, or any other Ingredients now in common practice, and the
harsh and corrosive qualities of the old Ingredients, will be very much
diverted and abated by mixture of the new.

Thirdly, the said Thomas Ducket will discover Liquors of such rare perfection,
that will clarify and prepare all sorts of raw Hides and Skins, for more speedy
and better Tannage; Either in Liquors and Ingredients of his own invention; Or
in Liquors of his own mixed and compounded with those formerly used; To prepare
raw Hides and Skins for more speedy and better Tannage.
Or in Liquors made with Bark, Sumack, and the rest now in Common practice;
And further the said Liquors are of such influence, that they will relax and
soften the Natural hardness in raw Hides and Skins, and cause the Callus and
Gelly in them, to be more expeditiously digested in the Tanning or Tawing; And
moreover the said Liquors will prevent the putrefaction incident to great Hides
intended for Soal Leather, for the Tanners by Stifeling them on great heaps
close together, do taint and perish them on the Grayn side, with a rottenness,
as is apparent by the easy cracking of them if forced or bended.

The Proposer undertakes to discover his new Arts.
A l which said Arts, Mysteries, Secrets, and Inventions, both for Improvement
of Land and Leather, the said Thomas Ducket undertaketh to make known in print
or otherwise, for the public good of this Commonwealth, and to direct and
teach the method, use, and practice of them.

The real performance of which Inventions, are sufficiently attested, and
cleared as aforesaid, and need not so great Evidence, but that any rational
person will Conceive that the undertaker is well versed in the Mysteries of
Nature, and able to perform many rarities of skill and knowledge for the
Improvement of Land;
seeing that by his study in Natures Operation, he has attained unto the
whole scope and body, of the Science and Mystery, for converting all sorts of
raw Hides and Skins into Leather, beyond all expectation and probability, as is
actually made apparent, for that the make thereof, transcends in such a degree
of goodness, all former Tannage, as never was performed, or accomplished, by
the most profound Ingenuities of this or former Ages; And it is apparent that
much Land continues sterril and barren, for want of help to assist Nature,
Land holders and Land-owners having been hitherto as Stupid and Negligent in
Improvements, as Tanners and others were in Improvement of Leather.

And if there may be now a speedy settlement of the premises, it will be an
Extraordinary help and benefit to all Tanners, A present convenience for
Tanners.
and other Tradesmen as to Leather, who will thereby save great Charge and
pains, which otherwise they must be at in seeking for Bark; and other
Ingredients, to furnish themselves withal, which are both Scarce and Costly.

That therefore the said Thomas Ducket in recompense of his great charge and
pains, and love to his Native Country, and for the encouragement of all
ingenious Artists for the future, may be empowered to have the Sole exercise and
benefit of his said Inventions, Grant of Settlement.
for improvement of Land and Leather, for fowerteen years, according to the
Laws and Statutes of this and other civil Nations.

And may have power and authority during the said Term, to grant Licenses to
all persons within the three Nations and the Dominions thereto belonging,
Humble motions and argumental reasons why there can be no good settlement
without sufficient penalties.
to practice his said inventions, which are new, and never before in present or
frequent occupation, in the same Method, Form, and Manner, with such additions
and alterations; And although the benefit of them be never so great, yet no man
is compelled as in such cases in other Nations, to make use of any of the said
Inventions, but left at will and pleasure to be Pilots to their own wills.

And these rich designs aforementioned,
which may so much advance the Commonwealth, being the Rights, and due Treasure
of the Proposer, and no-other person having an interest and property in them,
but himself; These Reasons why the Proposer ought to have good penalties are
not included in the Bills.
that therefore in all Equity and Reason, it is requisite for him by way of
Treaty with the honorable Members, humbly to lay claim to some fitting
assurance, and square and legal conditions, thereby to be certain of some
reasonable satisfaction, for those wealthy benefits, which are by him to be
presented to those persons, who are concerned to make use of them, and
therefore in all Right and Equity, your Honors cannot but grant him such a
power, as is congruent and incident to any venturers, who have used great
industry, and spent their best times and fortunes in bringing from foreign parts
of the World into their Native Country, some enriching Merchandise, at which
time the Owners thereof are at liberty to make their own conditions, with those
they furnish; and therefore accordingly that the Proposer may not be defeated
of the honor and reward which ought justly to accrue to him, for his new
Inventions, which are of far greater value than any kind of Merchandise, and
made ridiculous to the discouragement of ingenious Artists for the future, and
this Nation subject to the evil effects of ingratitude, and likewise this Act
made invalid by evill-minded persons, who although their composition for
Licenses, will be little or nothing in comparison of their benefit; yet most
people are of such perverse and ill-disposed natures, that they will rather
endeavor deceitful practices, than be conformable to the Laws; Therefore to
prevent such fallacious people, and that his recompense and satisfaction, for
his great Charge, Study, and pains, may be answerable to his Merits and
Deserts, and that he may have a secure Title, the Proposer under your Honors
favor, by way of civil bargain, Why the penalties ought to be so great.
does humbly lay claim to such good penalties, as are hereafter to be named,
wherein there cannot be a wrong or prejudice to any that mean well, for that
all good-minded people, will not make use of the Proposers skill without due
License, and therefore regard not penalties be they never so great, and those
who are of small ability will never run the hazard of them, and moreover those
persons who are unjustly and fraudulently intended, may be better ordered and
subdued with fear of good penalties, for it will suit with your Honors
prudence, and wisdom, that those persons who regard nor fear either Laws or
Honesty, but wilfully contemn and break them, should be severely punished, and
largely suffer; for the use of Justice, will be prevented by a well settled
Justice.

And therefore that the penalty of forty shillings may be imposed upon all
persons whatsoever, for every Acre of Land, whereon they shall without License
first had and obtained from the said Thomas Ducket or his Assigns, Penalties
for Land.
use or practice any of his ways, means, methods, or directions, for the
improvement of Pasture, Meadow, and arable grounds, in any of the particulars
aforesaid; And also the Sum of twenty shillings, upon every Acre of Land, for
every years continuing the use of them (without License) after Conviction; And
also that the penalty of twenty pounds, may be imposed upon all persons that
shall make use, or exercise (without License) any of his Engines, to carry up
water to any Cities, Towns, Villages, particular Houses, or any other places
whatsoever, other than for Improvement of hilly dry grounds in manner as
aforesaid; And twenty shillings for every days continuing the use of them
(without License) after Conviction.

And moreover to prevent unjust and indirect practices by Tanners, that the
penalty of one hundred pounds, may be imposed upon any Tanner, or other person,
that shall (without License first had and obtained from the said Thomas Ducket
or his Assigns) make, Penalties for Leather.
use, or practice, all or any part of his ways, means, directions, Liquors, or
Ingredients for the Tanning, Tawing, or preparing of Leather as aforesaid; And
forty shillings for every days continuing the use of them (without License)
after the first Conviction.

How the penalties ought to be recovered.
And that the Offenders in any the premises aforesaid may upon Oath of two
Witnesses, before one or two Justices of the Peace be Convicted.

And that all Justices of the Peace, may be empowered and required upon such
Conviction, to issue out their Warrants to the Constables of the place where
the Offenders live, for the levying by distress, the aforesaid penalties.

And that no person whatsoever (may without License as aforesaid) alter,
Counterfeit, Change, or falsify, either by addition to, or substraction from
the same, No false Pretenders or Counterfeitors.
or other alteration, all or any the aforesaid Inventions, Engines,
Instruments, or other utensils, Manure, Liquors, or Ingredients, either for
improvement of Land or Leather as aforesaid, thereby to pretend him or
themselves, to be the Inventors or Devisors thereof, upon pain of the
forfeitures and payments aforesaid.

That whereas Printers, Sta^ioners, Booksellers, and other persons, may by
false and counterfeit Books and Copies very much wrong and prejudice, Penalties
for Printers, etc.
not only the said Thomas Ducket, but likewise the Commonwealth; That to
prevent such inconveniences, which may thereby arise, a good penalty to the
value of one thousand pounds, may be imposed upon them, for printing or putting
to sale (without License) any of his Books or Copies of Directions, either for
improvement of Land in any the particulars aforesaid; Or for Tanning, Tawing,
To be recovered by Action of Debt.
or preparing of Leather as aforesaid; And also to forfeit five pounds for
every Book or Copy of direction, which they shall print or expose to sale,
after the first Discovery and Conviction; And the said penalties to be
recovered by Action of Debt in any Court of Record in the three Nations, where
no essoyn or wager of Law shall be admitted or allowed them.

And that the said Thomas Ducket or his Assigns, may by warrant from a Justice
of the Peace, Liberty to make search in case of suspicion for discovery of
Offenders.
to a Constable or other Officer, make search for the discovering of such
persons, as they shall suspect to make use of any of his Inventions, either for
improvement of Land, or Leather, (without License as aforesaid.)

That all the penalties and forfeitures aforesaid, are to be divided into three
equal parts, one third part to your Honors, to be paid into the Exchequer,
Penalties divided to three parts.
one other third part thereof, to be to the said Thomas Ducket or his Assigns,
and the other third part to the Informer.

And now your Honors having heard, Alluding his Inventions to Merchandary
commodities as a rational inducement though no part of the Bill. The small and
reasonable satisfaction which the Proposer expects for his discoveries.
what penalties have been humbly desired, with Reasons why they ought to be so
great, ye will bethink with your selves, what satisfaction and reward, it is
fit for the Proposer to expect, and in this case to satisfy your Honors, the
Proposer does not intend, that his recompense and gain, shall compare with a
Venturer, or Merchant, that brings in Gold, Silver, Bullion, precious Stones,
or Jewels, to grace, pleasure, adorn, and enrich a Nation, who will not part
with their Commodities, unless at very dear rates, or the full worth of them;
But the Proposer intends not by many degrees to be so costly, to the receivers
of the profit, which those whom he has to deal withal will receive; for
although not only the present profit, but likewise the perpetual good and
benefit, which will arise, by a comparative rule of proportion, will be
extraordinary great, yet the owner of these riches will expect from each
particular person, that shall by virtue of a License, have the benefit of his
Treasure, little more money from first to last of his authority, than the Baggs,
Cases, Chests, Vessels, or any other manner of outsides, wherein those rich
commodities were enclosed and contained, and then afterward all people, are to
have both outsides and insides, and all rights and privilege to his Discoveries
and Inventions, be they never so rich, and profitable, without any payment or
acknowledgement, and so to continue to this and after ages for perpetuity.

That no Justice of the peace or other Officer, shall be sued, or prejudiced,
No Officers to be prejudiced for what they shall do in persuance of the said
Acts. That the said Acts may be good and effectual, notwithstanding any former
Acts or Customs.
for what they shall do, in persuance and execution of the said Acts.

That the said Acts both for improvement of Land and Leather, may be good and
effectual, in all Courts of Justice to the benefit of the said Thomas Ducket,
Notwithstanding the Statute made in the first year of the reign of King James,
touching the duty of Tanners, Curriers, Shooemakers, and other cutters of
Leather; Or any imperfection in the said Acts; Or any former Act, Statute,
matter, or thing, concerning either Lind or Leather, to the contrary in any
wise Notwithstanding.

The Breviats of the forementioned Bills, and some other matters inserted in
them, being set forth, the Proposer does prepare these after answers to some
objections that have, and may be made by Covetous, Malevolent persons.
ANd first whereas it may be objected by some cross people, Several Objections
answered as to Land.
that improvement of Land, will necessarily induce such a plenty of all things,
as will cause a general cheapnesse, and abate the price of all commodities, and
by consequence diminish the Rent of Lands, and the revenues of Noblemen, and
Gentlemen, by disabling the Tenant to pay his rent (to this it may be answered.)

That this Objection proceeds from a Root of private interest, "Answer.
and respects only the profits of particular persons, and those who are against
improvements are Enemies to the Commonwealth where they live, for improvements
do not impoverish, but enrich a Commonwealth, for these following reasons;

First although Land be improved, that it bear more Corn and Grass than
before, and that plenty thereupon causes cheapness; yet the quantity being
much more will make that good again and out-bear the cheapnesse;
that there needs no abatement of Rents, for Land will for the most part
receive an improvement, N^ abatement of Rents by improvements.
proportionable to the value and goodness that it is now of, as for example, if
the improvement be to a third part of the value of the Land, then Land of two
shillings an Acre will be improved to be as good as Land of three shillings an
Acre; Land of twenty shillings an Acre to be as good as Land of thirty
shillings an Acre, and so in proportion.

More Land may be spared for several uses
Flax, Cole-seed, Rape-seed, woad or madder, which will increase a manufacture,
and produce an improvement, and mantainance for innumerable poor people.

More Land for Pasture then formerly.
for plenty of Butter and Cheese, to relive the poor, and for transportation
beyond the seas, and likewise to breed and mantain great Cattle for provisions
for the Land, and Navy at sea, and for the increase of that staple commodity of
Leather; and also to breed and maintain sheep for the increase of that other
Staple commodity of Wool, for the making of Clothes and Stuffs, and other
commodities; not only for the use of this Commonwealth, but for Transportation,
and maintaining innumerable poor people on work.

(...) A far greater pl^^y will be raised.
will be raised in this Commonwealth, insomuch that it may be a Storehouse of
plenty for perpetuity, and have so great an overplus of Food and Raiment, as
that it may supply and help the wants of Foreign Nations, and so bring vast
sums of money, honor and profit to this Commonwealth, and yet have at home
such a fullness of plenty, as that the Act for Transportation, made by a late
Parliament, may rather be enlarged than abrogated, as now it is in part,
several commodities exceeding the Rates in that Act limited and appointed.

Rents rather increased than lessened.
Lastly, no man's Incomes or Revenues will be less, by reason of the
improvement, but rather bettered, for their cause of expense in such a plenty
will be lessened, and they will have all manner of provisions and homebred
commodities at very cheap rates.

And if fertile bottomes are not better than barren mountains, and if the
abundance of the Fruits of the Earth, are not beside a blessing, a great
support and establishment of the policy of a Nation, then why do the Laws of
England indulge such privileges to arable Lands beyond Pasture? What mean the
Statutes to restrain the converting of arable Lands into pasture grounds, to
the hindrance of Tillage? Why are all Heath and other barren grounds exempt
from the payment of Tithes, the first seven years after improvement, by a
peculiar privilege?

Besides, Improvements are very advantageous for hospitality, and relief of the
poor, A general benefit.
in setting Old and Young, and all idle persons, to some slight work, who can
endure no hard Labor, and so there will be no wandering poor as now, nor any to
be relieved, but lame and blind persons, which will be very great honor and
profit to this Commonwealth; for that Nation is most honored, and regarded,
by foreiners, wherein is the most fertility and ingenuity.

But if there be any who are not sensible of the blessing and advantage of
plenty, questionless it were fit that such persons would confine themselves,
for some years, to inhabit upon the tops of some barren Hills, or Mountains, to
make trial of such provisions, as Nature there affords,
without the help of improvement, and there to learn by experience, the truth
of these assertions, rather than to be convinced by the strength of argument in
a plentiful Country, where perhaps the fulness of their stomachs may dull
the acuteness of their apprehensions.

And for a further satisfaction of what has been before expressed, Several
Obj^ctions answered and Reasons for Improvement of Leather.
and now especially concerning that staple commodity of Leather.

First, that all Leather made by the new Art, and Invention, of the said Thomas
Ducket, will in all degrees of perfection, so far exceed all former Tannage,
that a great trade may be raised in this Commonwealth, by that Commodity; for
in what Nation soever, any new Art, or profitable Science, 1. That Nation where
this new Art is first discovered will receive the greatest benefit.
is first invented and found out, that Nation will for many years after, have
the sole trade, and benefit thereof, and all Nations will address themselves
thither, conceiving there will be the best made, where it was first invented;
and the chief parts of this new Art participating of rare Mysteries, and neat
and private practices, yet are cheap and easy to be performed without the plain
and common drudgery now used in Tannage, and may be so disposed of by the
Proposor in this or other Nations, that during many score years, no other part
of the world may receive any knowledge or benefit thereof. And may keep the
said new Art a long time secret amongst themselves.


Upon which grounds, how happy may this Nation be, in the speedy settlement of
these Mysteries and Inventions? for the said Science may be many years here
kept amongst our selves, and Foreign Nations induced to import their raw Hides
and Skins, into this Commonwealth, to be converted into Leather after the said
new Art; Or if we please, the said accomplishing ingredients may be sold, The
Leather by reason of its goodness may be transported into other Nations.
and transported at very good rates, into other Countries, where they are not
found; for Leather converted after the said new Art, will be of such lasting
wear and goodness, that a third part thereof may be spared and sold beyond the
seas, at double or treble the price that now it is, and yet here amongst our
selves, it may be afforded at a more cheap and reasonable rate than now is sold
at.

And the ingredients, to prepare the said liquors, The new Ingredients cheap
and easy to be found.
are most of them to be had within this Commonwealth, at cheaper rates, than
the aforesaid old used ingredients, and will be of good benefit to the owners
of the Grounds and Lands, where the said ingredients are found.

Secondly, whereas Tanners are commonly a whole year, 2. More speedy Tannage
and a quicker return.
three quarters of a year, half a year, and the like, in Tannage, according to
the sizes of the Hides, and Skinns, they may hereafter by the use and practice
of the inventers directions, make far better Leather, and in shorter time,
whereby a quick return may be made thereof, which is the only advantage of a
manufacture.

Thirdly, although Bark of Oaks, and some other ingredients, 3. Bark and the
Ingredients now used are harsh and corrosive.
now principaly used in Tannage are very scarce, and costly; yet by their harsh
corrosivenesse, they do very much perish and destroy the stability and
fastness of all raw Hides and Skins, (which in themselves are some of the
wonders of Nature in strength and toughness) and thereby Leather is much
weakened of its natural force, and no remedy was ever known for the same before
this present time.

Fourthly, that Bark of Oaks, and other ingredients used by Tanners, 4. The
Trade of Tannage like to fail for want
are of such high price and scarcity, that by means thereof, there is very much
bad Leather made in in all parts of the three Nations, for want of full and
perfect Tannage; And the said trade is like within few ages, to be near
exti^^uish'd by (...) Bark is like to be far more scarce, than now it is, if
not in process of time quite consumed.

5. Timber is felled at unseason^ble times for the use of Bark.
Fifthly, the necessity of the use of the aforesaid Bark is so great, that the
Laws compel the owners of timber to fell and cut down the same, at unseasonable
times, when the sap is in it, which makes the timber so much worse in price and
goodness, as the rate of Bark does amount unto, and their loss in the Bark,
will in great Families be countervailed in the goodness, and lasting wear of
the Leather made after the said new Art.

The scarcity of Bark is the destruction of much young wood.
Sixthly, that in this time of dearth, and scarcity of Bark, Tanners are so
necessitous thereof, that by giving great prices for the same, they do thereby
tempt, and procure the owners of groves and copses, to make sale of the same,
when it is of very young growth, which if it were not to supply the Tanners in
reference and and recompense of their high prices, the owners of many such
groves and copses would permit and suffer the growth of them to continue,
until they came to be very good Timber, to serve either themselves or their
posterity.

7. The sale of Bark may not be utterly extinguished, for several Reasons.
Seaventhly, the sale of Bark of Ash and some other ingredients, now in Common
use, will not be utterly extinguished, for these reasons following; First, by
the mixing and compounding the liquors and ingredients, now in Common use, with
his new prepared liquors and ingredients, will take away the corrosive quality
of the old, and make most exquisite Leather; Secondly, in some parts of the
three Nations, the new ingredients may be scarce to be found, and the other
ingredients very plentiful; And Thirdly, some English people are affected very
much with the disposition of their neighbor Irish, and are altogether fond of
old customs, being a thing, whereunto vulgar capacities are much addicted.

A present necessity of settlement for fear of future disasters.
Lastly, these designs of so great consequence, which are now in being, and are
so freely tendered for the good of the Commonwealth, may in all likelihood, by
mortality, and other disasters (if not speedily embraced by the Supreme
Rulers) be as long hid from this Commonwealth, as it has before wanted it,
for none do know, but that after ages may be as long destitute of such an
opportunity, as former ages have been deficient of it.

And now the Proposer hopes, having cleared all objections, with these
satisfying reasons, that now he has no opposite to answer, unless it be some
particular persons concerned in the sale of Bark, and the quick wearing out of
ill Tanned Leather, who respect their own private interest, more than the
general good of the Commonwealth, and such as those, he can divert and cross
by several ways, (if they should endeavor to hinder a settlement of the
premises) with this one assertion, that it lies in the power of the Proposer
to discover and make known these his secrets in some industrious Foreign Nation,
who being thereby skilfully enabled in that masterpiece of knowledge, will
attract unto themselves so high a degree of perfection, A defeat to Covetous
and Malevolent Spirits.
in the said Art and Mystery, as will highly advance a manufacture there, and
so much diminish the progress thereof in these parts, as will occasion Bark to
sell at as low a rate, as if the Proposers directions, were here in frequent
action: for all Leather made by the said new Art, will be of such lasting wear
and goodness, that it will be most in request, and this Nation will altogether
make use thereof, and be supplied with the same, and so such malevolent persons
may be defeated of their covetous intentions, and this Nation attract loss,
and disgrace for their incredulity, and other contempts against flourishing
plenty, and other Nations gain the honor and profit, which ours, if not
obvious to their own good, might have enjoyed by (...)

Postscript.
ANd whereas it is before apparent, that the Liquors, and Ingredients, now used
in Tannage, are corrosive and destructive unto all sorts of Leather; So
likewise your Honors may be pleased to take notice of the great loss and
prejudice this Nation does suffer, in the dying of those precious Commodities
of Silk and Wool into Blacks, which being in themselves some of Natures
rarities, are notwithstanding very much perished, and destroyed, for want of
knowledge in Dyers, how to divert and qualify the inflaming and corrosive
Natures of those Ingredients, which they use in dying black, which prejudice
and inconvenience, the Proposer does admire, The prejudie^ in dying of Blacks
is e^s^^ to be preve^te^ and addresse^
that the Naturalists of former Ages could not prevent, it being a thing so
easy and open to the Proposers skill and knowledge, although he does not
mention or promise performance thereof in the aforesaid Bills, by reason if he
should, now with the rest, tender his service in another so material a
business, he should gain distaste from the envious and unskilful in Natures
Operations and Secrets, and should unjustly be very much clamoured and repined
at by many, for directing how to uphold and continue the full strength and
force of Wool and Silk in the dying, which would be great loss to the
quickness of the Trade of Dyers, Silkmen, Drapers, Mercers, Tailors, and other
Trades as to Silk and Wool: And although it is a business of small difficulty,
for the Proposer to set forth a means of redress, unto all Dyers, as well as
Tanners, how to qualify and divert the harsh and corrosive Natures of their
now used Liquors and Ingredients, and to make all Silks and Woollen so dyed
into black, to be as plump, soft, and strong for lasting wear, as any other
artificial color; As also to strike and permanently fix, those staining,
fading, and decaying colors, both in Silk and Wool, which are dyed with
Logwood, Brazil or the like, to continue in their fresh and lively Luster, unto
the uttermost wear thereof, and yet without the help of that costly ingredient
called Cutchoneal; And although this last clause, Colors may be made more
ilustrious, fix^ and permanent.
concerning fastening of colors in dying, be no great additional help to the
Weal public, yet it will be a perfect new Art of special good consequence, in
point of Reason and Ingenuity, to the English people; But the spoiling of the
aforesaid rich commodities, by dying them into Black, can be no other than a
very unworthy practice, for that it is much loss to men, and questionless an
offense to God, especially if it may be redressed; Yet England must lose this
Masterpiece, unless the Proposer be desired and encouraged thereunto, by the
wise and prudent Magistrates of Parliament. And whereas the Hollanders have now
some more honor and profit, beyond this or other Nations, in dying of Blacks,
and preserving the strength thereof, yet is not their skill in that particular,
of so great and high a degree of perfection, but their Art may be so much
exceeded by the English, as will remove the glory and profit which they attract
from other Nations, unto this our English Continent, if the Magistrates
thereof, in respect of their own welfare, do desire to make use of the Industry
of him, who truly honors all those that love the flourishing prosperity of
their Native Country, beyond others,

Thomas Ducket.

An Introduction to a Remarkable Breviary in Verses which are drawn in
allusion that this Nation may receive as much glory and wealthy preferment by
the Industry and new Inventions of Thomas Ducket Esquire as other fortunate Nations
have gained by embracing the Discoveries of persons famous in Knowledge and
Action.
To the Worthy Reader,
I Having been a long time Servant to the Author of these ensuing Transactions,
and Conversant in his Agitations, and now being employed by him to attend the
Impression containing several rarities of Nature by him brought to perfection
for the advance of this Nation, and many other fignificant advertisements to
the high Court of Parliament concerning the stttlement of a glorious national
preferment in honor and wealthinesse, being Masterpieces of that eminence as
they deservedly merit the approbation of the Universe, called to mind a
Poetical Berviarie of the said Mr. Ducats undertakings, done by a Person of
worth, being Fellow of a College in Cambridge, who having had experience of the
said Mr. Ducats abilities in many things as to Improvement of Land, and having
himself viewed, and had the Testimony of diverse Tanners and other knowing
Persons, that the Leather made by the said new Art, did far exceed all former
Tannage, in this or other Nations, thereupon was pleased, upon the grain side
of some of the said Skins, to give an Epitomy of the real perfection, and
excellency of the said Mr. Ducats Art, and Ability to perform his undertakings
for Improvement of Land and Leather; which for the Concisenesse of them, being
composed in a few lines in verse, and so full of matter, that they could not be
expressed in many sheets in prose, I therefore in reverence of the gravity of
the person and his verses, and the Truth therein contained, with their just
allusions to honorable Achievements, gainful Inventions, and lively
explanation of the Glory and Profit which might ensue to this Nation, could not
contein my self, but assume the boldness, without their privity, to cause an
impression of the said verses, which may well merit perusal and consideration
according to the humble conception of him who is

A Faithful Servant to the Author, And a Well-wisher to the Commonwealth.
Richard Cookson.

To his worthily honored Friend Thomas Ducket Esquire upon his diligent search
into the Mysteries of Nature.
Jason brought the stock of fine-woold sheep fi st into Spain. Virg^l the Roman
taught Husbandry. The Chinois devised the making of China dishes. De Serres
brought into France the making of silk. Columbus enriched Spain by discovering
to them the Gold and Silver Mines of India.
WHat praise brave Jason got of old,
By bringing home the Fleece of Gold;
What Fame Heroic Virgil wan,
By ayding of the Husbandman;
What benefit the Chinois found,
In the right use of Pursline ground;
What great advance De Serres made,
By teaching France the Silkworms trade;
What wealth Columbus did impart,
To Spain by his Seafaring Art;
What renown did ere accrue,
To the Inventors of things new,
That worthy Ducket is thy due:
And if authority shall stand,
Thy Friend in these designs, this Land
May as great praise and prize obtein,
As Greece, Room, China, France or Spain.
Thy knowledge then let none cry down,
The Author of these verses does allude the renown that England may possess by
the Proposers Ingenuity, unto the good success that Spain enjoys by that
sort of sheep, that were at the first brought thither by the industry of Jason;
The which sheep were said to bear Fleeces of Gold, in respect to the most
exquisite finenesse thereof, the Emblem of which Fleeces have been ever since
worn as trophies of honor to the memory of Jason upon the breasts of the most
famous Monarchs of Christendom. And by that type or figure, it may as clear
and properly be said that the English Cattle do bear golden hides and skins,
for that Mr. Ducket by his transcendent new Art has achieved unto the glory
and honor of converting them i^to the most exquisite Leather of the World in
value and perfection. The Leather of the new make is very tough and strong, and
will not rot by wet, nor wear out near so soon as Leather of the old make. This
or any other Nation that has this skill may be enriched where the Inventor does
communicate his Sciences.
That by thy Golden Skins is shown,
Made Leather without Bark at all,
Corrosive Shumack, Salt, or Gall,
Or any Composition which
Beyond Seas came to make it rich;
But with Ingredients of our own,
Whose influence was never known:
Which Leather makes that glory wins,
As if our Beasts had Golden Skins:
Yet puts the Tanners Liquors down,
That Leather makes so coarse and brown;
Compared with thine, it is but dross,
An Emblem of the Worlds great loss.
Which had continued but for thee,
Throughout all times Eternity;
Which now thy prudence can divert,
When Honor shall advance thy Art:
By turning Hides to Leather rare,
In show and gloss like Silken ware;
Soft in the hand, white, plump, and full,
Like felt well wrought of Beavers wool;
In Color, grain, in strength and touch,
The Universe had never such;
Whose substance in the lasting wear,
Does exquisite, and firm appear;
And that which makes the profits large,
It Is done with little time and charge;
Since in what Land thou do derive,
Thy Science needs in wealth must thrive:
Yea to confirm how well it is Tanned,
None of the Trade denies his hand;
But labors for thy Patents grant,
Lest we such good should longer want;
And that by thy encouragement,
We may enjoy what is eminent
From others too who shall devise,
Hereafter new discoveries.
Besides in Husbandry thou do,
Supply with little pain and cost,
Where Nature to defect declines,
In Barren Lands, Fruit, Trees, and Vines;
What former Authors did not reach,
Thy pregnant Judgment now can teach;
New Methods of perpetual gain,
Nature by Natures to sustein:
The drought of Land thou can prevent,
By Art and watery Element;
Thou can suppress the force of weeds,
That grass does Choke, and kills good seeds;
With wealthy secrets thou can fill,
Those Nations shall embrace thy skill;
Thou have recourse to Natures store,
To fortunate both rich and poor
With wealth of such a large degree,
That all good men will pray for thee; The Author alludes the Inventors
knowledge in several mysteries to the Mine and Mint, in relation to his
Theorical, Methodical, and practical parts, as also to his rich discoveries
that are of as great goodness as mines of Gold.

Thy skill is such, that to conclude,
With what rare gifts thou art indu'd,
Few can conceive in the extent;
And what makes all more excellent,
All Is thine, to silence barking tongues,
That to the Mine and Mint belongs:
So that his parts must be Divine,
Who can in part but add to thine.
Jeremiah Collier.
