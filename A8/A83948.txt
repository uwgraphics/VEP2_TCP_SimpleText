Impartial Reader
I Intend not to make a Preface that may swallow up this short Treatise;
Epistles are commonly but the clogges, and burdens of Books, and express
little more then the Title page. Others have spoke enough to the argumentative
part of our Affairs, and have proved by reason what God has acted by
providence; this discourse is rather directed to the consciences, then the
fancies of men, and may serve as a serious memorial of what God has done for
us, and an aviso to men in their rash, and bitter censures, that this state and
change, which though it be new, that it may not seem strange, God has ushered
it in with the greatest ceremonies of providence, and put extraordinary
characters of his presence and glory in it. I have no more to trouble thee
with, but the reading of it, which yet may be profitable, if not persuasive,
which is the end of the discourse.

ENGLANDS APOLOGY FOR ITS LATE CHANGE.
THough it is not probably to be expected that any argument or reason should be
forcible to persuade the hearts of men, when so many wonderful providence,
and glorious appearances of God have made no impression, or that words should
prevail, where things are undervalued. Yet because every Christian ought to
endeavor to make his own heart, and others sensible of public miseries or
mercies, and seeing the intent of this discourse is to unite, not divide, and
that it is high time to leave off quarrelling with persons, and actions, it is
possible this paranetick may not be in vain, if either the miseries of a
civil war (which has almost ruined this Nation) or the horror of dead
carcasses lying always in our way; if the cry of blood, which has been powered
out, not from one, but every vein of this Nation; if the desolation^ of
Towns, and Cities, the mournings of widows, and Orphans in every corner,
the mischief of factions, and d^visions in our own families; if lastly, the
effectual workings of the very finger of the Almighty, if all or any of these
were fit to work on our affections, to thirst after a settlement of this State,
and to persuade m^n to acquiesce in what God has done for this Nation, and to
comply with the Parliament in securing this Commonwealth, we needed no
paper-exhortation, and this might well have been spared. But its to be feared,
and lamented, that Gods works among us, as his Word has had different, and
sometimes contrary effect, some are hardened under the dispensations, others
softened, and that most of this Nation are under a judicial blindness, and
stupidity, which will hardly be remedied, but by the ruin of this generation,
who have so highly provoked God, in opposing his great designs in the latter
days; for though God has walked up and down in garments of blood for this
almost ten years, and has not spared the flesh of Princes, and great men, and
has showed himself directly against that royal party which at first began
these miserable wars, and showed forth most eminently his indignation against
that person, and family, with all that have adhered to them, yet (which is most
sad) not only are their hearts hardened, and their necks stiff against the
Lords work, but in any who acted at first with vigor and vehemence against
that party, have turned their faces, and have been of late the most dangerous
opposers of this Parliament and Army, and are become the hopes of the common
enemy, yea many lost in prejudices, and discontent, have wholly espoused
others, are courting that interest, as if they would unravell all these lines
of providence, whereby we have been blessedly led into a Commonwealth; And
like the children of Israel would rath^t turn back to eat Garlic and Onions,
under Pharoahs bondage, then be led by providence under the conduct of Moses,
th^ugh to Canaan.

It is from these secret quarrels and murmurings, and disaffections (among
godly men) (which have though they had their first rise from private
animosities,) yet they have been formed, and aggravated by close, and subtle
enemies) from these are the foundations of our ruin, and of our enemies
designs, and hopes, who (while we are discontented among our selves, for
trifles) are preparing engines to cut us off both at once, many essays have been
used to that end, which had not God from heaven disappo^nted, had took effect
ere this, and occasioned the sad repentance of the mistaken actors.

And doubtless, among all the hardships this Parliament and Army has gone
through, either in opposing the common enemy, or working out their own
distempers, they have met with nothing more sad, and dangerous, then the
slightings, and disrespects of these, who were once, and should be still
friends; who have but one, and the same common enemy still, how ever we may
subdivide into several parties, rather by the delusion of names, then reality
of differense.

But its better to bewail these distempers with our tears, then express
them; my intent is not to open our wounds, but to cast in some Balm to heal
them; we have too long been petting, and objecting, while God has been
acting, and doing us good, without our observance, or notice; the great design
of this paper is but to mind us what God has done for us, to press all
honest hearts to an improvement of our mercies, with sense of the worth of
them; And to persuade honest, and inquiring men to a compliance in time with
this Commonwealth, least they come to unite with the common enemy, who is yet
acting in both Nations, in one more visibly, to ruin us by our divisions.

Its worthy consideration what we have been doing all this while, and why we
are disquieted with the present State, seeing these things have been brought
forth among us, which have not been the events of long contrived plots, but of
special administrations of Gods wisdom, and respect to this Nation, and
merely acted by God, beyond the policy, and engagements of the wisest men; yea
the whole series of workings in these affairs has been demonstrative, that it
was not of men, nor of their wills, but of Gods. And how ever particular
observances may judge of things, yet if the whole be viewed, and the harmony of
every part in this great work, all dissenters must needs have their
consciences under conviction, while their interests are unsatisfied.

Let us take a short account only, for to help our memories of our first
principles, and Gods actings, to improve them, and we shall see that few of us
have eyed what we first undertook, or what God has (beyond our thoughts)
done for us.

Our first principle we acted from, and from which we stated our Cause (from
which we had then no dissenters but Malignants) was to bring Delinquents to
condign punishment, (who had abused this State by the Royal Consent, and
Authority) and to oppose the tyranny of the King, and flattery of the
Countiers. A principle large enough to work on, and to take in by consequences
of affairs the utmost improvement; upon this ground all the Parliamentary
party acted together, (not being able to see, or hope for any thing more then a
reformation) (and that of the grossness of actings) and so firm were we in
this, that we never changed our thoughts, until the delays in war; and the
influences of the Court, together with wearied, and neutrall friends, and the
thoughts of places and preferments, made men to study new ways of compliances,
and to leave the first principle for the present enjoyments. But God (who
overruleth the counsels of men, and had a further design) will not suffer so
good a beginning to make a fatal end. And according to his usual way, from
small beginnings brings forth his greatest glory, acting things beyond our
first thoughts, or designs. The King was first opposed universally in his
personal capacity, and reserved in his public, in these who fought against
him, this went down current, and without any demurre among us; and upon this
we waged war; but God (who still meant to carry on a higher design) keeps
us equal and fair for a long while together, now giving the advantage to us,
now to him, still making drawn battles, (while there was a lesser piece of
royalty opposing a greater) owning the Cause so far as not to discountenance
that side he meant to honor at the last; but no effectual work was done, but
honorable retreats, and days of thanksgiving for non-routing, and security,
rather then for any victory we ever had over the Kings party, except
especially that of Marston-Moore, (wherein the chief instruments of the new
model were agents) (which was soon recruited) and ballanst by our own parties
negligence in the South, and their diligence over their affairs. God kept all
this while a kind of equality, persons were engaged of different tempers, not
of different principles, and it had been well (for all our reports then at
London,) that we kept our ground, into such straits we were then brought,
(though we seemed to have a great and potent Army) that nothing could serve in
the view of the whole Parliament, but a wise disbanding that Army, and framing
a new Model, (which was a cause of strange necessity at that time) and a
hopeful way of our ruin by many, even in Parliament, who gave their votes for
it out of another end, who are since discovered) but it has since proved the
ordinance of God. This is the poor Army that the great repinings and
discontents are made from: This Army, which has been preserved by Gods right
hand, who have done that work which is wonderful to relate) against this Army
all the arrows of malice and design are shot, to wound either their persons
or names; It Is sad to think that our eyes should be evil, because Gods is
good; that we should repine at instruments, when God does the work? let us as
men that would feign see into Gods ways, consider what has been done since
that change, what a continued continuation of providence (I might say
miracles, if they had not some means to produce them) have we had since that
despised model. The thoughts of these things are only repeated for our
conviction: There are two things very remarkable in these affairs since our
first engaging against the late King (each of which shall have their due
consideration.)

First, That all our affairs were hardly kept in aequilibrio, in a fair and
right correspondency until this new Model; but that the King got more ground
by his influence, then we by our Armies; the Army under the Lord of Essex,
being a petty Royal Army, made up of all sorts of humors and Confederates of
either side, rather kept the Parliaments credit, then gave them any use for
the^r money: and we never had a battle fought by him; but we came off, and that
barely, and with loss as well as the King.

2. That never since this poor, (at first despised; though now envied Army)
was modeled, we never either received a considerable loss or check in our
proceedings, though the action of this Army has been in three Nations, and
accompanied with miserable discouragements from all parties, and difficulties,
that other Nations would have thought insuperable, and so acted, that nothing
but God has visibly appeared: It cannot, it must not be forgotten, it will be
written in marble (if not in our hearts) and the place it self will be made
immortal to all posterity) the first testimony of God to the first action of
this Army at Naseby, when all Politicians were securing of themselves; and our
wisest friends fearing what the issue would be, and the royal power at the
greatest height, and going on in the fullest carrere, what a glorious turn was
there given to the designs of the Enemy, and reviving to the hopes of this
Nation; God never before so peculiarly, and in our low condition owning his
poor people; and ever since God set up his Standard there, he has made bare
his arm, and never suffered one eminent, nay hardly any defeat to be given to
this Army, making that the earnest of the Conquest of Gods Enemies in these
three Nations, whereas in all our former Battails, we could never say we had a
victory (except some special formerly named) which had their recruits very
soon) from this time (I say) as if God had the idea of this Army in his eye,
and had with his own hands framed the model of it, and culling out the Army
he meant to bless; he has ever uninterruptedly afforded his presence, though
the difficultyes, and multitude of Enemies have been more then could be
expected, or then ever Army under-went, who served a State in such
transactions. What eye cannot see the plots and contrivances, both of the
common, and secret Enemies, how many ways have been used to overthrow this
Parliament and Army, and what humors have been predominant among themselves to
ruin that body: yet how strangly, and beyond all men's thoughts, have they been
carried through; if we were delighted in viewing divine actings, or had a
design to make a History to astonish all the world. Let us follow the Army
from Naseby, up and down England, at home; from thence after two Wars, the
second more dangerous then the first, being upon more cunning pretenses, and
made out of our divisions among our selves, and especially levelled against the
Parliament, and Army, a war that divided the Army, as well as the first
confiding instruments; yet with what wonder of glory did God break forth their
deliverance; for after God had helped them to drive the K. into the Scots Army
(a presage of his sons reserve) new Insurrections are in the most special
Counties round about the Parliament, which first began more remote in Wales,
that they might more insensibly supply the whole, and the design might be
thought more barbarous, and less considerable, while stronger and more
effectual influence were operating nigher hand, yet this poor Army must
through all; the General in Kent and Essex, the Lieut. General in Wales, and
Major-Generall Lambert in the North, having all their hands full, and the Scots
under Hamilton, when the conjunction of Langdale, and the old Malignants,
making up the harmony of malignancy, though in a discord: No sooner had our now
worthy General ordered the affairs of Wales, but new work was provided for
him. In the North Major General Lambert had long expected him; and though he
had by his wisdom and valor kept his own ground, yet the Enemy (who grew
like a snow-ball by going) got mighty advantages: and taking their way through
Lancashire, a place they thought good Quarters for their Army, as to find
capable and zealous Subjects for their design: but God (who ever appears in the
best opportunity) to show forth his continual displeasure against any
conjunction with the royal party, upon what pretense sover,) brought up then
Lieut. General Cromwell to join with the Major General, who both with all
their Forces, could not make a third part of the Army they were to encounter
withal; but God so appeared, that they routed that vast Army, which carried
with them the highest design, and had more advantages of power, and plea, then
any Army of such a mould that ever came into England.

What can be more immediately from God then such overtures; will God justify
the wicked so po^itively, and perpetually against the godly (and that by his
own power, not only by permission.) Is there nothing in these affairs can take
our hearts? Does God do strange and unexpected things for to be dis-respected?
Let any Nation show a parallel, and not draw such conclusions as we now draw.
It Is true, (and it must be one cause of our daily humiliation) that we have not
answered God in our duties, suitable to those manifestations; but yet the
neglect on our parts should not annihilate, or darken the glory of God in his
own actings, but rather shame us, and heighten Gods goodness unto us, who is
so in love with Englands liberties, that our unworthiness, and unsutablenesse
cannot stop him in his course of grace, and mercy. Let us, if we must needs
take our prejudices, and satisfy them as to all Gods actings in England: yet
when we look on Ireland, and it is sad condition before, and how, and when
restored, and by what instruments, and then let malice act to the utmost, if
there be but a spark of honesty, or any glance of a spiritual eye left, and we
must needs stand amazed, though discontented at Gods goings with these whom we
despise; How have we cried out against these bloody rebels (as we had just
cause) for how many years were monthly public fasts throughout the Nation
kept for poor Ireland? (besides all the private unknown bleeding of the
souls of many Saints in corners) and yet no fruit considerable that we could
call an Answer, until God appeared by himself (when this Army was on the
Seaside in readiness to be transported) and in what a manner, and method of
miracles, God has appeared, there is not to be expressed at a distance: God gave
in the first wonder at Dublyn by that ever to be honored, Coll. Jones, ere the
Army came over, that they might not have their flesh and blood too much
discouraged, both at home, and abroad, and yet would have them ready ere he
began, that they might improve, and finish it.

What of design had the Parliament in this Expedition, to divide their Army,
which was so small at home, among so many enemies, or what hopes could that
part of the Army have to encourage them to leave their own Nations without God
had moved them; when they lay at the water side ready for a wind to sail from
their own Nation, where God had made them so prosperous against the common
enemy, and to leave all their friends, and to arrive at a a Nation, wholly
engaged and enraged against them, and but two Towns, Dublyn and Derry, that
were left as receptacles of them, or earnests of hopes, and these both besieged
by far more then the full Number of this Army could Muster, and yet how
willingly did they go, and how gloriously did God appear, making a whole
Nation, both of bloody rebels, and royal Malignants, to be overthrown by
them, not suffering them to give them one defeat, though they had multitudes
of advantages, and in one year almost to reduce that Nation to a new
obedience: and were that History of Ireland well printed, how far would it
exceed all the Relations of its first Conquest by this Nation, when little else
save ambition of domination, and of enlarging our power, not to execute Gods
righteous judgments against bloodthirsty men, did put them upon endeavoring
the Conquest of that Nation.

What of flesh and blood can be demonstrated to be predominaut in these
transactions, but love, and zeal, in the instruments, to free the Protestant
party from further cruel miseries by the Popish, and royal party there, (who
became soon one) and power from God to back these undertakings. Are we sorry
because God imployes not these instruments that suite with our particular
humors, and stated interests? is the work of God the less to be eyed, because
he uses despicable, and poor instruments? or moves beyond our Model? the
generations to come, will remember these things, and take them in, though we,
thorough the clouds, made by the vapors of our own engagements, and factions,
see little in them: Irelands Protestants will doubtless keep a Chronicle of
these acts, and bless God for the instruments when they are entombed in the
blood of the enemies of the Gospel, and who knows, but Ireland, who has never
yet soild the Gospel, but have been under the sad persecutions for the little
light they had in it, and have not yet extracted factions and divisions out of
Gods mercies, to advantage the common and watchful enemy.

If Irelands wonders will not make you in love with Gods actings, (which was
nothing else but the prosecution of the same cause beyond the Sea) yet let the
harmony and continuance of Gods appearances to own this cause, and this
Parliament in the three Nations (the motions in each) deserve a particular
History) let the universal proportion of divine actings (for I dare not call
them otherwise pardoning men's insirmities) be a confirmation of each other; for
what ever the pretenses and pleas have been either civil or sacred in England,
Ireland, or Scotland, yet God has drawn one line of providence thorough all,
and given, an equal, and astonishing success against every party, in each,
which have but appeared against them. If we pass by all the rest and come
into Scotland, a privileged place, and, one would think, holy ground, yet
when once they came to dally with malignancy, and comply with the royal party,
though they had the Temple of the Lord written in their foreheads, and the
Covenant on the palms of their hands, and used it as their Phylacteries, yet
opposing this design (which God has put into the Parliament to prosecute by
their Army, how has God owned them in the face of their chief despisers. I
am not now in kindling fire of diffention, (miserable man is he that lets fall
a spark willingly to contribute to this fire) but to lay before honest and
inquiring men, what reason we have to stand and pause upon Gods actings, and
mollify our hearts by these continual droppings.

God knows with what heart that Expedition was undertaken, and with what
little provision of outward advantages it was managed on our side; for after
our March into the North, with so much leisure and delay, to see what overture
might be offered from heaven to prevent us, (which was passionately longed for
by the General and his Officers) when we came to the borders, and marched
thorough Berwicke, we had not three days provision, nay not one day, neither
could there either for love or money be obtained a present necessary supply, as
if we were rather going to visit our friends, and to help them, then to
fight; and yet if all circumstances be duly weighed, Gods actings by this Army
in Scotland are farther, and more glorious progresses of his wisdom and power
in the same principle, and a clearer demonstration of Gods owning this Cause,
then any which have been yet.

Let us consider first, whom God appeared against, not the Irish rebels, nor
the absolute malignant party, but those who professed to walk under the shadow,
and protection of the Covenant, who were thought by all diffenters, not only
to be Patrons, but principalls of all reformation; a people who had only
professed opposition to this Parliament, and Army, and that for the most part in
spiritual pretenses, these who had first invented the names of shame and odium
on the Army, as Sectaries, yea who had annihilated this Parliament, and its
Authority, and set a King over them and this Nation, in the exactest idea; to
which if we add the state of our Army among them, with their height and
confidence, all the world must see that no power but of the Almighties, could
have done it for us.

For our Army, (though they have had more opportunity of action, which they
delighted in) yet were they never brought to such extremities, to so low an
ebb, by both want of victuals, and all necessaries: neither have any former
example of Gods appearing with them in England after such a manner; for though
they were oftentimes fewer in number then their enemies, yet never reduced to
such a disproportion, as at Dunbarre. In England, yea, and Ireland, they fought
against Forts, and Bulwarks, stout and perfect enemies; but there they fought
against hunger, and cold, sickness, and diseases, and lost their natural
spirits, and strength, when they should have had most use of them. None can
express the low condition they were in, their men falling sick, and dying
like rotten sheep, their Horses hardly able to carry their riders, and yet
were their beasts provided for better then themselves; the most part of their
work all the while they were in Scotland until the battle, was but a
continual march; from Mussleborough, and Penclan hills unto Dunbar for
necessary provisions; But that God (who has still done all for us) might exalt
his own name, and give a demonstrative testimony not only of his continual
presence with them, but a sign for unbeli^f; he brought them as low as it was
ordinarily imaginable, and the enemy as high, and confident, as flesh and blood
could make them; all relations of our necessities at that instant, with the
circumstances of it, can be but as the painting of hungry and starved men, with
a few open mouths, and pined faces; and on the contrary as the enemy had, by
all the policy and stratagems of war endeavored to being them into this
condition, by waving to fight them, so they then thought they had their end,
and the blessed opportunity was instant; nothing else was expected but to have
them all devoured at one morsel; and that they might not fail in their
assurance, they made the covenant their word (then as formerly their pretense)
as the infallible earnest of a full victory, and some of their eminent Officers
called in scorn to some of our men, that now was the day come the Covenant
should be avenged of the Sectaries, and that their name should be blotted out
from the earth; thus did they triumph through the covenant, and play with that
sacred bond.

But that all good people may see at what a height of confidence, not only the
Army, but Kirk were attained unto, and how God appeared both against
Ecclesiastical prophecies, and civil designs; I shall relate a story of as
great credit as wonder; on the same day this glorious mercy was wrought for us
at Dunbar, one of the Ministers of Edinburgh (I take it his name was Hagoe) was
preaching to a great congregation in that City railing on our Parliament, and
Army, raising the expectations of th people for to expect some more then
ordinary vengeance, and that from Heaven on them, and (like a false Prophet)
told them to stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord, and whereas he and
his fellow Ministers, had often told them of this Army, and of their
wickedness, and denounced the judgment of God on them, they should now see,
and that (it may be) ere they went from that place, that God would confirm the
words which he had so often spoken by the mouth of his Ministers to them
concerning this cause, (for he knew in what straits we were, and what their
hopes were that day, but he knew not the counsels of the Lord) Immediately as
he had finished his prophecy, or at least ere he had done his work, God sends
in some men that came from the battle, all bloody, and with sad countenances,
which was seconded by fresh witnesses; all the congregation is amazed, the
Minister silenced by his own mouth, and so trembling that he could not hold the
Bible in his hand; and though there were some children to be baptized, yet he
could not do it, and thus abruptly left the Congregation, with horror for his
false prophecy against Gods people.

This relation has its confirmation from the Scots themselves, and multitude
of hearers in Edinburgh, and it may well be believed without witness, if we
knew the temper of most of the Scots Ministers, and how much given they are to
such a method of prophecy; But the Gentleman might have considered that they
had not the Kings malignant, or Hamiltons false Army to excommunicate; but an
Army (I may say) formed, I, and helped by the Lord. What shall we say to these
things, If God be for us, who can be against us? Its dangerous meddling with
those whom God ownes. Shall all these things be forgotten, and spilt as water
on the ground, is there nothing of glory sparkling out through these
manifestations, that may convince us of our opposition, and disaffection to
these proceedings? It cannot be, but some men conquer their convictions, as the
Army has done malignant persons, who yet hate them because of their own
interests.

But to go on, how gloriously has God appeared ever since; while the enemy
beyond the water have been studying with what solemnity to Crown their Kings,
God has crowned our cause with many Diadems of his glory, and mercy; for after
that Battle at Dunbar, and the strangeness of the issue contrary to all their
faith, and assurances, and many who were accounted the honest party, began to
reflect on their former principles, and carriages, and having rallyed in the
West, by their friends add more strength, and remonstrate against the State
for their tampering so much with the King, and their juglings among themselves,
which they have largely expressed in print, whereby they show some sense of Gods
hand against them, yet nevertheless, what ever thought they had of their own
party at home, they continued their enmity against us, and not withstanding all
overtures made to supple their spirits, and improve these convictions, (which
if truly weighed, are from the same principles with ours, and no more
difference then of a Scots and English interpretation of the same thing)
notwithstanding all these fair, and cordial affections we to the utmost
expressed to them, yet they cunningly watched their opportunities) First, to slip
into England (of which they were prevented; and then Secondly, to fall upon a
part of our Army in their quarters, where God appeared again, and both took
their chief Leaders, and ^cattered their whole party; this great, and further
appearance of God wants not its circumstances to make it an eminent mercy, and
to strike deep into our spirits; for First, they were the Army which had most
of the hearts of the godly with them, as being separated from the grossnesse of
the royal principles, protesting with more zeal and honesty for the Kirkes
interest, and so would have gained more then ordinary on men's spirits; and
again they had the great command in the West, whereby they did great damage to
our Army, and had advantages of stealing into England, both to withdraw part of
our Army from them, and stirring up new fires among us, which would too soon
have been effected by their Covenant pretenses; besides the manner of their
overthrow is as remarkable, (God striving in all this war to leave signal
characters of his own hand in every of our mercies) for when the General had
marched a great way from Edenborough toward the West, and sent express orders
to the Major General, to meet him without fail at such a time in such a place,
where the General came according to his appointment with a great body of Horse,
and foot, they could not hear any news of the Major Generals approach, the
weather being so bad, and provisions so scanty both for horse and man; his
Excellency was forced to march back with all his forces, and frustrate his own
intentions; the Country people hearing of the Generals retreat, run to Kerr
and his party, tell them of the estate of things, and how his Excellency was
returned to Edinburgh, and that Major General was left alone: Kerr seeing his
advantage (which he had long waited for) presently falls on his Quarters,
promising himself a full defeat of that party; But they being in readiness,
received them valiantly with some few Troops, and quite routed him, and pursued
and took, and shattered all his confidents, whereby we may see, how every
deliverance, and victory, is circumstantiated with some beam of peculiar glory
and providence.

And if the delivery of Edenborough Castle, (that impregnable Fortress) were
added, and the manner of obtaining it, it would bring forth a new matter both
for praise and conviction, but I intend not this for an exact history.

Thus it has been from first to last, and every victory like one star that
differs from another in glory; and however there may be a difference between
persons, and parties, in respect of profession or holiness, as there was
between the Army under Kerr, and that under Lieut. General Leslye, the former
being more purged, and professing of principles, with more zeal, and indeed we
may justly call them a Sectarian Army, opposing, and divided from the public
proceedings of Kirk and State, yet they are all one looked on by God as to
help, and prosperity, when they either with others or by themselves have
lifted up their hands against this cause, a consideration which is not slightly
to be rejected, and which may well make men wary of second actings against them.

God has yet made that good in these Nations, to this Commonwealth and Army
(so far as they have had sincere intentions in the management of this war)
which he did once to Israel; No weapon that is formed against thee, shall
prosper; though carved, and whetted by the fairest glosses, and religious
instruments. We have hitherto in sum (and as in transitu) given the Reader
an account of the series of Gods workings for us, since he thought fit to make
use of this Army against the common enemy. Let us now reflect with wonder, and
astonishment at the dullness of our apprehensions and strangeness of the
opposition and inward murmurings of many, otherwise observant, and godly,
against this Commonwealth, and Army; for which God give us leave a little to
expostulate with their spirits; with whom are you angry? who has done all
these things? is there nothing of the image of Gods mercy, power, and wisdom
written on any of these victories? could so small a bulk of flesh and blood
destroy such potent Armies, storm such brazen walls, clime such high places,
with so little loss, if the Almighty had not seconded, and engaged his right
hand with them? These are far from Rhetorical, but they are real
expostulations? Are we angry that God has heard our prayers which we so long
time put up to him for subduing the common enemy, in the three Nations, or that
he has done his own work without our mediums? What shall be said, shall all
these actions of Gods power in, and so much goodness, be buried in a
discontented humor, and the glory of them blasted by a designed prejudice? God
forbid: the ages to come shall remember our insensiblenesse with tears of
blood, and own themselves to be our children, as high-raised up-starts do
their poor parents, who blush when they are named.

But if any spirit be so slight as to say, all these are but events, and no
proper declarations of the truth of a good principle, they being oftentimes
occasional, and permissive by God to a bad as a good cause. I answer in
general, that its true, that commonly and ordinarily God keeps such an even
course in the universe, that all things fall alike to all, and the same event
unto both the bad, and the good cause; thus God suffers it for a long time, for
the hardening some, and destroying others, and to draw off the hearts of his
front depending on these enjoyments, or advantages in this world, yet at the
same time he would not have his people put the right of their sufferings or his
enemies prosperity, on ^o large and indifferent a supposition, but to look into
the Will of God in thus disposing of their states, and to find-out the
particular end of God to them in it.

But as there is a general and special providence of God in the World, so there
are events suitable; these special Providence of God call on all men for
serious observation, for in them God goes out of his ordinary course, and they
do show either his special owning, or dis-respect, whether to a person or
party, and are often distinctions of the truth of Principles and Actings; and
if there were nothing to be seen of God more by these then other
manifestations, the World might grow careless and secure from expecting any
evil from the hand of God, or any punishment for iniquity more then what a
godly man himself may have by the same strokes: And if this principle should be
true, what reason have the Malignants or Papists to look any more into Gods
hand on them, or to think their cause the worse because Providence overthrows
their Armies, why should any cry out on them for hardened and obstinate persons,
saving they have no more but events to convince them, being still confident of
the justness of their cause: And to what end have we kept so many days of
Thanksgiving for Victories, if there be nothing in the issues of affairs
restifying to the Truth of things, it can be nothing else but a mocking of God,
to give him solemn praises for that which can neither show us the goodness of
our cause, or Gods peculiar respect to us more then our enemies; for we have no
more witness to the Truth of our Principles then they have, save our
confidence, which is as firm and stablished in them as us: Let our Brethren
look and remember what expressions they used formerly in their thanksgiving
sermons, both before the Parliament, in the City, and up and down all the
Kingdom, for any show of a Victory, when the Army was commanded by the Lord of
Essex, when any party was routed under Sir William W^ller, or any of the first
Commanders, though we lost it as soon as we gained it, and they were far from
the Victories are now despicably called Events of War; with what affection and
zeal did they prove the equity of our fighting against the King by these
mediums; it became a common expression at such days, That our God was not as
their God, our enemies themselves being Judges: and by what should our enemies
be judges against themselves for us, but by Gods appearing against them, and
ordering the issue of things beyond all their height of confidence and
expectation. Many other such like expressions have been with much heartiness
expressed in such days, blessing God for owning his people in a day of need and
making a difference between them and their enemies the testimony of all which
they gathered from particular succes^es.

But why trifle we in a matter of such consequence? are all these actings in
England, Scotland, and Ireland for these many years so neg^igently to be taken
notice of only as Events of ordinary actings? What can then be called Glorious
Appearances of God in this World or what Victories can we have so much
c^nscience as to write Gods Name as on these? How can a model of the workings
of God for his people be drawn in fairer and clear^r colors? Had God acted
with these that dissent and by these instruments which they had sanctified for
the work, though far lower than he has door wi^h these whom they despise, the
world should have another account, and these providence should have been
proclaimed in other names then accidents and events, if not the persons
canonized long ere this in every Church and Chapel; and if God had permitted
such an overture, that the Scots had beaten and overcome our Army at D^nbar
(which would have been the saddest day that ever Englishmen saw) we need not
question but the name of all these former eminent and con^icued Victories both
in England and Ireland, would be blotted out from the earth, (except these
hear^^ in whom the glory and mercy of them were engraven with the same finger
that wrought them) and nothing else but the just judgments of God declared to
be executed against the Sectarian Parliament and Army, by Gods faithful and
Covenant-keeping people; who can imagine that tryumphant conclusion that would
then be made of the wickedness of our Cause, Principles, and Persons, of the
truth of men's railings, and the reason of their discontents; how would all men
be exhorted from henceforth to beware upon penalty of the like judgments of
God, to withdraw from any compliance or conjunction with these who were the
declared enemies of God, against whom he had bent his Bow utterly to destroy;
telling all men to consider ^ow God had at last found his secret enemies, and
vindicated the cause of his Covenant, especially in Scotland where it was made
and preserved; we may easily without uncharity guess that a thousand such
inferences would soon be drawn from such an event: But seeing God has given us
the use of such an argument, and added that mercy to all the rest with a
cleerer representation of his face toward us than ever before, why shall we
think them common or unclean? are our Victories less precious to us than thei^s
would be to them? are we more glad to see another Nation conquer us, than we to
defeat them in their Designs against us? or can we rejoice that God uses
foreign Instruments in his work, rather than these of our own Nation? How are
we degenerated? how surprised in our affections, that we should desire more for
the Scots to conquer us than for the English to preserve us from them? If we
have lost our consciences, yet let us retain our natural affections; and if
this Government be evil in our eyes, yet let us have so much wisdom and
selflove left, as to prefer it before a Scottish Tyranny; if our mercies be
not in every point and circumstance fashioned according to our model, let us
not throw away the substantialls of our Liberties, by maligning and opposing
those which are the visible preservers of them.

Let us once again look back upon Gods providence for us, and mind the series
of them, with the variety and manner of bringing them forth, and study more the
nature of them, for they deserve the most refinedness of our thoughts to be set
on them, and the purest place in our hearts to have them registered; if every
fly and gnat, every piece of dung and filth shows forth something of God to be
observed by us, what do these choice unparalleld workings of him against the
Powers of this world, who stand in his way to the advancement of his Sons
Throne?

God writes his mind sometimes in his Works, as well as in his Word, and there
are many overtures in Civil affairs which the Word does not so positively
direct, but providence and the necessity of affairs must be the rule in; and
how ever the providence of God are not demonstrations a priori (as they say)
yet they may very well be a posteriori; though they do not state things, yet
they do distinguish them; and as God will rather have heaven and e^rth to pass
away, then one iota or tittle of his Word to fail, so he will have all men to
give him the glory of his Works, else he will destroy all the civil Heavens and
earths which men sets-up; and God blames his people as often for not observing
his Works as for disobeying his Statu^es: If the permissive acts of Gods
justice in the world ought to make all men fear and tremble, how much more
these positive and errectual assistances of Instruments in executing his
righteous judgments? the children of Israel were blamed for nothing more, than
that they forgot the wonders of God at the red Sea, and in the Wilderness: But
that we may not look on these things at large, let us view what have been
accompanying all our transactions in these last years, which make them more
than events to convince our spirits. First, all that God has yet acted for us,
has been from the smallest and contemtiblest beginnings, that even wise men
have been afraid of their own Acts, and our enemies have laughed in secret at
us, seeing our ruin in our first foundation; and so weak we were, that we were
rather objects of the pi^y of our friends, and scorn of the contrary party; who
would ever have imagined that such a new Model should have thriven better than
so great and well accomplished Army which preceded? or what could wise men
either foresee, or Christians* believe concerning any great matters to be
accomplished by such Pigmies?

Secondly, As God took the lowest condition to begin this work, so he ever
brought our estates unto the greatest straits ere he appeared; to point out to
all men, that he would be alone seen in the prosecution of this cause, and that
he would have the glory of making this Nation a Commonwealth. In England
remember especially Naseby, when the King was the ^ighest that ever he was
since the war began, where was the first experiment of Gods engaging with them;
at Kent, Essex' Wa^es, especially at Preston, when the Nation was most divided,
and incensed against these proceedings, and our Army scarce a third part. In
Ireland, when all was lost but two Towns, Dublin and Derry. But above all in
Scotland, when we fed on our Vital Spirits more than Bread, and lived by our
courage and Gods support more than food; how has God helped? I have often
looked on it as an absolute and general observation in Gods actings, that he
never brings his enemies into straits to help them, but it is his usual way
where he means to make his providence glorious, and his people most praising,
to let them be past saving in their own sense, and their enemies hopes: and
truly our Victories were seldom given, until not only our means, but almost our
faith failed us.

Thirdly these successes have been uniform and universal in every part, and
against every party which have upon any pretense whatever banded themselves
against this State and their transactions; yea so eavenly has God gone forth,
and so impartially, that how ever we may at first question the principles, we
cannot deny the acts but to be from God: Yea not only height of Royalty, and
the grosness of Malignancy, but the flourishes of the best precenses have been
blasted and overthrown by these manifestations, the Church as well as the World
have been under a Divine censure for opposing themselves, and complying with
the first or new modeled enemy against this State; which may make all godly
hearts serious and wary, if not to tremble at their fire and heat in their
reflections on these things. If these things be not timely considered, but our
obsti^acy grows with Gods admonitions, the next work will be Excommunication.

Fourthly, all these works we now see, have been begotten and brought forth in
the midst of the plots of open and secret enemies; plots laid so secret and
sure, that nothing but he that discovers the hidden things of darkness could
discern or prevent; and so has God ordered and casted the season of our
deliverances, that they have been beyond the enemies designs and perfectest
persuasions, and our expectations of the most observant spectators, that God
might have all the glory: Who could imagine what has been working in hell, and
the corners of darkness, against this work of God now in part brough^ forth,
and yet all disappointed and frustrated, with condignet punishment on the heads
of principal Authors

It will be endless to run over the variety of these discoveries, and other
circumstances, which if well considered, are as much as the mercies themselves
amount unto.

The last great demonstration of Gods presence with this Army in Scotland, may
serve instar omnium to Uniting our confidences, if all the rest be of no value;
which was, Gods determination of the iustness of our Cause after solemn appeal
to God on both sides, especially on ours; this being the public expression of
our Army in that candid Remonstrance, ere they entered Scotland; that they did
appeal to God, the righteous Judge of quick and dead, if their hearts were not
sincere in what they remonstrated, and in their affections to that Nation, and
did moreover put it only on God, if ever they came to engagement (pardoning
human infirmities) to deal with them, according to the justness of their Cause,
and the truth of their hearts, I quote this especially, because as it was the
most solemn appeal to Divine Justice, so what God did in this, was the
confirmation of all the rest of his public actings by them, and the Umpire
only left to God to own them or destroy them as his wisdom, and justice saw
their hearts, and cause; how was Gods arm made bare for them at last, though he
carried himself a long while, as if he meant to make good the reproaches of
their enemies against them. It must be confessed, Appeals are of a very high, and
dangerous nature, if not done with the greatest seriosity, and upon the surest
grounds; and they do either argue abundance of carnal confidence, or integrity
and pureness of spirit; that they ought not to be frequent, and common, but
where no other way is or can be found out of deciding controversies of a high
and controvertible nature, where confidence on both sides are equally positive,
and immovable by mediate arguments: yea, It is without question, trivial and
common affairs cannot be grounds of Appeal to God, there being thousands of
other ways at hand to determine them. But in matter of war, and the grand
decisions of the justice and equity of taking up Arms and entering Nations or
opposing persons in great power in the world, where arguments are strong on
both sides, and parties violent, if in such case Appeals be solemnly made to
God, the issue of such affairs are to be accounted higher then nature, and
truly to be judged as revelations of Gods will, at least at present, and to
that affair which they appealed to God in; as only righteous to give verdict
unto by his own appearance, since all other means of conviction failed. Much
of the same nature is that determination by lots, though it be more mediate,
and not so solemn, being but generally used, and often without sense from whom
the disposal of them are, yet the issue is judged to be from God, and an
absolute express of his mind and will, not of blind Fortune or Chance; much
more then may we say of the issue of that Appeal, which was made with as much
sense of unworthiness, and vileness in themselves, as confidence of their
integrity, and willingness to let God judge; as also when it was made, in
dealing with these who had laid all the reproaches that malice could invent, or
fiery zeal vomit upon both their Cause and persons, what ever the secrets of
God may be which are infinite depths (or what ever he may permit in the
general rule of the world, yet if men are put to such straits in actings,
their names so vilified that none but God can right them, and men have at the
same time so much sense of Gods justice, and faith in his truth as to make him
sole umpire, God will not in justice condemn the righteous, and spare the
wicked; for these appeals as they are extraordinary ejacusations of our spirits
in the most difficult and doubtful cause so they are pressings of the Almighty
to let forth the beams of his wisdom and justice, to convince the sons of men,
after all experiments of nature and reason; and God is so put to it (if I may
humbly express it) to give forth righteous judgment, that even the heathens
and his enemies have found his appearance, when they have appealed to him
against the Christians who owned God, and had not dealt justly with them. I
would not be thought to circumscribe the wisdom of God or his justice, that it
must of necessity always be manifested immediately on such Appeals but I affirm
that it is Gods usual way, and the events of them are to be weighed and
remembered again and again, as the most probable clearing up of hard and
formerly questionable enterprises; when the Army went into Scotland ^ow were
they vilified by that Nation? ^e^en with reproaches of the highest scan^a^ and
inf^^^y, slighted with the basest contem^t, as men given over by God, hating
his truth and people, and now at last invading them, to show their utmost
malice to that Nation the A^^y f^y to heaven, leave all to God, and desire his
(...) power to determine whether these things were not quite contrary, the Lord
looked on their condition and has helped them, in the sight of their enemies;
what can we conclude on these things? are these only acts of* permission
toward us, and of mere pa^ience and long-suffering? what can be more apparent
that we acted upon right and just principles and to honest ends; seeing God
himself, who was made the Judge, has given the sentence?

We may remember, and know the nature and ominousness of Appeals with
trembling, by Gods actings to the late King, and his, who to make his designs
take the better with the people, in every declaration Appeals to God so to deal
with him, and his, as he was true to the Protestant Interest, when he had
Papists in his bosom as his chief Counselors, and that he never intended to
raise war against the Parliament, when all his end of withdrawing from them,
was to form an Army against them; How has God Judged both himself, and his,
for it ever since, never leaving to follow him with Judgments, until he had
made himself a Public spectacle of his justice, and has now laid aside all
his Fa^^ily: God may for some secret ends let his enemies prosper for a long
time over his people, to afflict and chastise them, and make them partakers of
his glory; but he never, or very seldom after manifold deliverances, and
absolute appeals to his righteousness, has afforded them assistance;
especially when its among his own people in their controversies, and truth is
on the one side, and prejudice on the other. I could (if I were a challenger)
dare all the world to show an instance after an immediate Appeal, whether God
has not either eminently given the sentence on the right side, or at least,
whether upon such is^ue all men have not so interpreted it: has God nothing to
do with this world? Has he given over his Supremacy to Fortune and Chance? Or
when can God be seen in Determinations, if not after such Addresses to his
peculiar Moderation? Where shall the Righteous fly when they are condemned? Or
how shall men know that Vengeance only belongs unto God, but by such Divine
Conclusions? But we must leave the conclusion to God to confirm, as the
Determination in it self; There was much to be observed in the Scots Answer to
that Clause of our Appeal, rather leaving us to do it, and threatening us upon
it, than putting their Cause and Confidence on Gods approbation and issue; for
whereas they were positive and peremptory enough in their Charges; yet they
were very faint and staggering in the manner of Appeal to God, as either
fearing their Cause through inward conscience of carnal complyances, or
assurance of their own strength to do the work by themselves; it is enough what
God has done, he will in his time either convince or destroy men.

But besides all, (which seems to be more considerable than any yet, after not
only Appeals, such yet may be too confident) but after the contradicting
prayers of his own people, God has cast the scale on this side, and made
answer according to the Requests of the vilified Party; never was heaven so
much troubled with interests, and oppressed with contrary Petitions (if we may
modestly express it) then in these few years; the Saints formerly have made but
one public cry, How long, Lord Jesus? Come quickly; and there has been a
pure harmony in their Addresses to God, though in different conditions; but now
heaven suffers a strange kind of violence, the violence of Truth and Error in
the same Petitioners; but God has made the Heavens Brass, and his Ear heavy
to all the Prayers even of many of his own People in these Affairs, and ordered
Events contrary to their prayers; I know in what causes God may do this, but
when Saints and Saints shall pray and God answer only the one, the other may
well look round about them.

If aay one question why I put so much right on this? It Is answered, that there
is nothing more clear, that where his People are engaged in several parties,
some by mistakes and ignorance of Gods mind, others out of Truth, and they both
pray to him, God will always hear th^se prayers which are most according to
his mind, and give forth issues answerable; for all our prayers are no farther
to be expected to be answered, then they are according to Gods Will, and that
Will of God does manifest the truth of our prayers; when prayers clash in
heaven, it is the same with opinions and judgments of Saints on earth
concerning Gods mind, which have but one truth to rule them, and according to
the consonancy of apprehensions to that, God owns or dis-owns all their actings.

It is most sad and dangerous to do any public act wherein any which are
godly shall dissent, much more that which any of them shall pray against; and
this very consideration has made this Parliament, and the Army to make so many
pausings in their actings, as fearing themselves and their own mistakes, when
so many good men seem to be against them; yet it is as sad, and should be much
weighed, that God should continually answer one sort of prayers, and quite
neglect the other, when they come both from godly persons whom God loves: What
one petition has God ever seemed to receive as made by his own Spirit against
these proceedings? but has clearly demonstrated that at least he is angry with
the dissenting Prayers of his own people: I leave these things on men's
Consciences, how they can interpret Gods actings against their prayers, and how
they can digest Gods hearing of these they judge their enemies, at the same
time, and work out contrary issues. All these considerations put together, may
suffice to work us to a meditation at least of what God has done, and to
parley with our own hearts, why we should yet refuse our full consent to the
establishment of this Commonwealth; shall any that professes the name of
Christ maintain secret war and malice against his actings, or think to prosper
by helping the common enemy.

But if nothing yet said will move us to have better thoughts of these
Transactions, let us once again consider in what times these things are door,
against whom, and by whom: First, all these workings have been in the latter
days, when God is throwing down the old heavens and earth, and has his notable
designs to effect, and all these mysteries of Prophesies to open, which have
lain hid for many ages, and seemed formerly quite buried in the prosperity of
the Kings and Princes of this world.

Secondly, against whom has God appeared, but against those persons both in
Church and State, who has adorned this Nation with the rags of Popery and
Antichristianisme, or with Tyranny and Oppression; and as they have raised
themselves, God has discovered them; and as they have shifted their Quarters,
God has followed them with his just displeasure and indignation against any
complyers with them.

Thirdly, however God may permit for a long while his enemies to triumph, yet
when ever he begins, he will make an end; and these principles which seem
general and easy at the first, God will improve, and has done, beyond all our
intentions; for it was hardly possible in the multitude of these overtures, to
lay any deep plot beforehand of them, new and unexpected emergencies of their
designs, and Gods providence always on a sudden breaking fo^th, which were
not only difficult to foresee, but sinful to withstand. And truly, those that
think of plots deeply laid beforehand to bring out these great things, may as
well suspect the Providence by which they have been necessitously led into
them.

Fourthly, for however we may make little account of providence, yet they are
the most exact comments on divine prophesies of any other, and are the special
visible key whereby God opens all those seals that are in that book: and what
ever special inspirations we may have from heaven to guess at Gods intent, yet
the words are so dark wherein God has written his mind of these affairs, and
so blurred by Antichrist, that until God come to open them by his actings, we
know not how to interpret them with safety or comfort; hence it has come to
pass, that many pages must now be blotted out of many worthy and learned (and
in most things) clear Comments on Daniel and the Apocalypse, because every day
God acts beyond their present thoughts, and gives occasion of reforming their
own confident apprehensions of the nature and issue of those prophesies; so
that if Gods providence, compared with his words of prophecy be not looked
into, we must still be in the dark, as to the understanding of these great
mysteries; by what can we hope that God is about to fulfill his word concerning
the destruction of Antichrist but by his keen and severe prosecution of every
limb and member of that body, yea and beginning first among his own people,
that the enemies may not have cause to reflect, and tell God to reform first at
home; how can we know that God is pouring out the via^s of his wrath, and upon
whom, but as God discovers it by his terrible actings among the sons of men, by
which he calls on all men to hear and obey, not to murmr or dissent? But if
the manifestation of God (notwithstanding all this) seem uncleer and
unperswasive to dissenters to gain their full consent to this Commonwealth,
let our own interest prevail upon us and if heaven be too light, let earth be
added to it to weigh down our judgments; God has given us an opportunity
against our wills to make our selves the freest and happyest Nation on this
earth, and we are the first of so large a Continent that God has advantaged
with such a blessing; our Ancestors for these 500. years have bin struggling to
get but the name of freedom and liberty, and have for this end deposed one
King, and set up another, who had commonly a worse title and reign, but God
has given us our choice, whether royal bondage, or English liberty; were we
ever so nigh the regaining our conquered privileges as now? what is there but
a name between us and a Free State, and nothing wanting to perfect all (besides
Gods assistance to prosecute what is begun, and direct what is not done) but
our own election of what may make us happy, which happiness if we imagine
consists only in the title of a king among us; let us remember what we have
spent on that name already, of our measure of blood, and how God has made it
contemptible.

We may all now see how Gods great design is to bring to naught the Princes of
this world, and has his principal quarrel with them, because they have bin the
greatest shedders of the blood of Saints that cr^es under the Altar, and the
only mighty upholders of the throne of the Beast, and are still those that lies
in Christ's way to his royal Throne, and the glorious exercise of his Kingly
power shall be first on the Powers of this world who have combined together
against the Lord and his Anointed and have bin the most undermining and professed
enemies that Christ and his Saints have had in the world; and all those that
seek to underprop that tottering state, must expect to fall with it; for God
has either laid aside or destroyed the best sort of men, who (though with
never so much tenderness or zeal) put forth a hand to uphold this Monarchy; and
if ever Haman begin to fall before Mordecai, he never rises more but to his
utter ruin. What is it that lies so weighty on our spirits, that no
providence, no argument can balance? I wish it were not to be feared of many,
they have made snares for their Consciences, and then catch themselves
willingly in them. Are not the days of Mourning for the late King yet expired,
and our hearts refreshed by what God has acted since in these three Nations?
Its now high time for us to wean our hearts from the flash ravishments of Names
and Titles, when we have so long suffered for our affections; Surely if we were
impartial Judges of that Act (which I may call the first clear and through Act
of Justice that ever was executed in the Western World) and if we did (like
good and wise men) observe the nature and fruit of Actings, we shall find, that
as never an Act of Justice was accompanied with more remarkable observations,
and blessed with more happy Testimonies of Approbation, then the beheading the
late King. Besides the righteous grounds upon which they gave sentence of death
against him, which when looked into, we had rather need to wonder such a Head
should s^^nd on his shoulders, then that it was solemnly severed from it, being
one who was the Author of the shedding so much blood in three popolous Nations,
merely for his prerogative tyranny, for all other things he might have had, and
much of that also, with the hearts of all good subjects.

But the circumstances (if they do not deserve a better name) in his execution
may inform us something more then ordinary if we shut not our eyes.

First that God should so order it to bring him to his death, and shed his
blood before that very place where the first blood in this war was shed, while
he looked out through that window with sport: God does sometimes write men's sins
in their punishments.

Secondly that in so populous and vast a City, among millions of his most
entire, and desperate friends, there should not be found the least tumult, or
motion, or insurrection for to rescue him, all men being under a divine
restraint, and awed by the dreadfulness of Gods justice in such an act; what
was that poor Army who were dispersed up, and down the City, to the legions of
enemies that were against them, who might have destroyed them in a moment and
eat them up at one morsel?

I am loath to strain these things too far, but only to name them to make us
consider, that they are not ordinary, It was one of the great circumstances
named in the childrens of Isreal's deliverances out of Egypt, that not a dog did
bark at them, but doubtless never was such an act of such concerment done since
that time in the world with less noise, and silence then that, which argues
that something more then humane, was at the doing of it; and which may not be
omitted, God has not suffered the least hair of the heads of any of the prime
Instruments in that glorious piece of service, to be touched by any
Assassinate, notwithstanding all the threatenings and bloody malice that works
strongly in dissolute and desperate spirits.

And if we have had but any eyes to view the consequences, and issues of it, we
cannot say but that there is at least occasion of seriousness, and
ponderousness of spirit, ere we have a thought amiss concerning the lawfulness
and justness of it, for as until that time, we did but trifle, and dally with
the sword, and were but off and on, up and down, more in hazards then hopes; so
from that day has God blessed us, and without intermission or halt, freely
fought our battles, and entirely engaged himself in England, Ireland, and
Scotland; and which is more hardly a drop of blood has been spilt in England
on that Quarrel ever since, as if God should say, the sacrifice is offered up,
the Achan is destroyed, my wra^h is appeased, all the blood you shed before was
an aggravation of your sin, while that person who was the Author of all and the
common person, and head to give life and motion to all the rest was untouched;
in such a dialect God seems to speak to open and attentive ears by all his
actings since; I leave these as considerations to employ second and more serene
thoughts upon: yet if any be of so tender Conscience in that particular that
they still scruple, let them not judge others who are clearly satisfied; they
have their liberty of dissent, yet let them know they are bound to present
duties, which if we had but a faculty of arguing, how easy might we draw the
necessity of cutting of the late King? commune with your own thoughts; was not
he guilty of all the blood which has been so prodigally spilt among us? It
must either ly on him or the Parliament, if on the Parliament, we condemn our
selves for joining with them, and we are partakers of the same murder; if it
lay on the King, what way had we to free this Nation of the guilt, but letting
him bear his own punishment, all other acts of friendship would be but
contracting of his guilt on us, for as there be two ways of making a man
guilty, either by his own personal act, or by compliance with another, which is
done by countenancing the malefactor, as by coacting with him, as he that
keeps a murderer in his house, and gives him any coun^enance, is in law made
equally guilty with him; It would have been thus with our Parliament had they
gone on in any other way then to preserve this nation, but by revenging blood
with blood: for how ever public wars may seem to be an excuse and mitigation
of guilt of killing of man, yet its the cause that gives the advantage of
innocence and righteousness in these acts, and the wrong cause make all the rest
murderers in Gods sight, and he will prosecute them as murderers, especially
the prime agents in such affairs; yet all means was used to the utmost, until
we had almost lost our selves, and the sense of our cause; again let us
seriously contemplate what good we could have of such a person after all his
high and bloody actings against this Nation, when he refused to grant the
propositions of the Parliament so necessary for this Nation, and only showing a
willingness to grant some of them, and that only for time which would of it
self pass away, and which he meant by all designs to cut as short as he could;
the best advantage that ever we could have hoped to have by that persons life,
was but a cessation of our miseries, until he had recruited and persected his
designs, and patcht a peace, with the utter loss both of the sense and fruit
of the first undertakings; and here let us make a stop, and pause with sad, and
mournful hearts on the condition of poor Germany, who after all their powerful
wrestings with tyranny in a long and horrid war, have got nothing but a
miserable peace, and the protestant interest left to shift for it self, and
strangers that came first to help them have made up their own gains with their
utter ruin; let Bohemia especially speak, where the Protestant, has ^ardly an
article for their prosperity, but what is general, of little advantage, and the
Emperor, and Sweeds, (like the Sco^s, and their King,) divide all among
themselves; the Papists, and great men most followed the Emperor, and the
Protestants the Swede, for friendly assistance and brotherly pretense, and now
they have made a peace both for themselves; and thus would it have been with us
if God had not raised up some instrument to have no respect of persons; let
Germanies example be an occasion to us to think on the King and the Scots;
while we slight the mention of a Commonwealth, which God has given us all
advantages to make not only sure, but the freest and choicest in Europe. And if
any be affrighted at the change, as that which seems to be dangerous and
unlawful, and putting by the heir of the Crown; I hope they are not
ignorant, how many changes have been in England by the tyranny and usurpations
of Kings, and of foreign powers over us, but never yet had we the happiness
to change into a Commonwealth, although our best histories tell us, that the
first of this Nation when they were most free, was without Kings; but we need
not be so stumbled at this change, seeing the necessity and conveniensie of it,
and that it is only change of persons and not of the Laws, and privileges by
which we are governed, which were long since, and yet at diverse times purchased
by the blood of our ancestors, rather then the goodness of our Princes; and
if we look warily, we must needs see all the series of Gods actings have
directly led us to this change, which we have been pressed unto by the necessity
of our own affairs, and the continual dictates of Gods providence; and who
has resisted his will, we see by experience, that God changes all men's states,
as they oppose, or fall in with it; But yet if the thoughts of the Covenant be
brought in as the main objection, why many cannot so freely join in with the
Commonwealth; I must commend the tenderness of their consciences, but not
their wisdom, and understanding, in making a difference between things, and
persons, and judging of the nature of obligations. No former covenant can
hinder me from obedience to a present duty, and serving my generation according
to special opportunities; obedience to oivill powers, is a duty at prepresent,
and must not be superseded by any former engagement, without I make two sins
instead of one; a sin in omitting my duty, and a sin in covenanting not to do
it; As for that clause in the Covenant of maintaining the Kings Person, its
sufficiently explained, and limited in the next words (in the preservation of
Religion, and liberties) both which have been publicly Voted inconsistent, and
the one positively necessary for preservation; And when we Covevenant to
maintain his person; we suppose to find in it such a capacity as not opposite
to Religion or liberties, nor to be found in the lest Article among delinquents
against the State, which we have covenanted to endeavor to bring to condign
punishment, under which capacity the Parliament have found the late King; and
his Son CHARLES STVART; and under that account prosecuted him, and kept the
Covenant, as every honest Christian must do in all the rest of the Articles,
that seem to be dark without they be made the interpreters one of another; and
however we may gnaw on the Covenant, and rifle it to maintain our prejudices,
yet, we may better take the Engagement to this Commonwealth, notwithstanding
the Covenant, then take up Arms against the King notwithstanding the Oath of
Allegiance; for that Oath did absolutely, without any limitation (as is fully
expressed in the Covenant) bind us to the maintenance of the Kings Person, and
Heirs, yet when our dissenting friends, came to persuade the people to help
the Parliament against the King, they could make little of that Oath, yea,
could go quite against the letter of it, to prevent a mischief, and raise a
necessary war against his person, while they kept their Oath to defend his
person; and is that lawful and honest to take up Arms, and raise a dreadful
war against his personal capacity, notwithstanding a solemn* Oath in such
distinguishing terms, only out of pretense to preserve his public capacity
which is greater, that is the state; and is it not the same, and may it not be
done with as good conscience to remove his person, to preserve Religion, and
liberties, both which if they were not in eminent danger, let all men judge; in
a word, no more does the Covenant hinder me from taking the Engagement, then
the Protestation did men from taking the Covenant, though there were many other
words of a different dialect inserted into it.

Had the Parliament imposed on the consciences of godly, and honest spirits any
new Articles of the Creed, or an Ecclesiastical government, without any
tenderness to godly consciences, or drawn a new Model of Religion, and
required obedience of all unto it; this great piece of intolerable Tyranny
could have no more raised the spirits of some or exasperated men's passions,
then the imposing an Engagement to a Civil government; which has nothing of
sin in it to reflect any guilt upon the consciences of any, seeing all Civil
Governments are alike lawful in themselves, the convenience of them, and good
use, makes them profitable, yet disobedience to them is sinful, it being a
res^stance of an Ordinance of God. And therefore it cannot but be worthy of
much blame (though to be lamented also) that Ministers of the Gospel (those
that should be the blessed Messengers of peace, and joy) should make their
Pulpits Stages of bitterness, and Satyrs against the present Authority; this
has happened much among us of late, (through the pride of men's hearts and
instigations of subtle enemies) that these good Ministers who in other things
have had the Vrim and Thummim, shining with much brightness on their breasts,
yet have made their Sermons, like the malignant sort of Diurnals, that when
poor souls come hungring, and thirsting to hear something of the Lord Jesus
to refresh their sad hearts, they find little else but Histories of Civil
affairs, revilings, and defamings of authorityes, and casting fire bals of
sedition, up and down Congregations, to incense men's spirits against the
present Government.

This is one of the greatest reasons which I can by observance find out that
the Ministry is so low, and in such contempt, because they mingle Christ and
this world so promiscuously together, and do not keep within the bounds of the
Gospel, in their public preachings to the world. But speak more in the
language the of Stage, then of a crucified Christ, and this makes many withdraw
from the public assemblies, because they can hear little but cavils in
Pulpits, and Christ in private houses; I wish the honor of the Ministry might
shine in the glory of the Gospel for other respects, they will find them to be
but temptations, and hindrances to their work.

Is there any thing else which stands in our way, (for strawes must be removed
as well as real blocks before prejudiced eyes) are there any complaining, we
are yet unsettled, and oppressed: Let these men answer themselves, that if they
will have a settlement, they must contribute to the procuring of it; for while
every one divides, who shall settle? If they cry out of oppressions; its very
unjust, they should expect otherwise, who will not come under protection; as
its most unreasonable any should desire protection, who will not engage to be
serviceable to promote the Commonwealth.

I shall end with proposing some Queries to zealous, and honest men, with a
word of application from what is done in Scotland, and no more trouble the
Reader in this kind.

First, Whether must there be an act of oblivion past, for all the mercies,
and victories we have had over the common, or secret enemies of this State? or
to what use shall we put all these wonders?

Secondly, What lower improvement could there have been of so much blood, and
continual deceit among us, by the name of the King, and his family, but a
cutting off the one, and racing out the name of the other? or whether ever any
peace with these persons could be sound, or acceptable, without some special
sacrifice of them to Justice? let it lie on our consciences.

Thirdly, Whither we can imagine that God had not higher ends then we first
proposed in our engaging against the King, or then what could be at first by
us foreseen? or whither any condescension in us could have gaind him, without
hazard, and loss of our maine liberties, and privileges.

Fourthly, Whither the providence of God; (seeing they have been so peculiarly
acted,) are not to be guides and rules to us in prosecuting a general and
indefinite principle? or how we can with comfort satisfy our selves in civil
quarrels, but by providentiall events, or what is that event we think most
demonstrative of Gods mind, if these are not?

Fifthly, Upon what hinge will we turn the door of our affairs, if not upon
the continual, and daily manifestations of God? having our end, and principle
right? or whither any person, or power can foresee all the turnings and changes
in a multiplied affair, without some leading providence of Jehovah.

Sixthly, Whether is the better foundation for action, a supposed principle
with contrary actings of providence, or the like supposed principles, with
extraordinary lettings forth of Gods power, and Majesty.

But what need we querie, humors, and discontents will soon turn all these
expostulations to encouragements; we are now (through Gods blessing) come to a
period at home, all the expectations of our enemies, is from the broken reed of
Scotland, but the veil is now off, the malignant party is but retired there
under another head, and if we may believe the Scots themselves, and those
which are accounted the honest party, and their Remonstrances; we have nothing
to fight against, but the malignant party in Scotland, the honest party, who
were first deluded, being first subdued, and now, beyond the water, they are
put to the shifts of a general compliance, which will be no discouragement to
us, as formerly; for then we fought against many pretenders to the Covenant,
and who were with a conscience engaged, (and yet God esteemed it not) but now
we have a full mark, the old enemy newly crowned, and all things made up in
Scotland to follow this design. But I hope Englishmen can do no less then
the honest Scots have done, remonstrate against those proceedings, and yet God
makes them know that bare Remonstrance, against that party, without union with
Gods instruments, will not serve, but there must be an unanimous correspondency
of all good men against these shifting zealots: And we have now a more ground
of hope against them; if God has owned us when they seemed to keep at a
distance from the malignant party, and to fix their principle on a surer, and
more clear foundation, how will he now appear for his people, when they have
past thorough all delusions, and are to meet again, with their old enemy, but
what horror of spirit will fall on these good men, who will rather venture
themselves, with malignant assistances, then comply with Gods workings.

I have no more to say, he that cannot trust God now with our cause, has
either too much interest, or too much ignorance, after all the ways God has
taken to open our eyes. Let our Parliament, and Army, never doubt
encouragement, but keep up their spirits high for Gods ends, seeing they have
none now to encounter, but their old enemies, without any pretense, that may
trouble their consciences, or delay their marches; And let godly men know (who
stand yet out) as God has done all for us without them, so he will now more
especially, because they are now under the first consideration, and must come
under the same vial, and at least expect the sprinkling of it, while they have
any conjunction with that party, which God has devoted to destruction; if our
consciences be not quite asleep, and if we have any sensiblenesse of our
present advantages, and future miseries, let us set our seals to Gods actings,
and rejoice in the Lords will so gloriously manifested, and not strive against
the stream of providence, but as men convinced by God, not by men, engage our
selves to maintain this Commonwealth, which is the only Bulwark left us,
both to keep out tyranny, and preserve our liberties, which in due time we
shall have most free, and stablished, if our own fond affections to strangers,
and prejudices of our friends, do not undo all.

FINIS.
