TO THE READER.
Dear Friends,
ACcording to the Gentle and Friendly Dealings of the Lord to my Soul, whose
Love I feel has a Constraining Virtue in it; therefore, as he has set before
all Men Good and Evil, my Desires are, That all may make the better Choice; and
as there is Diversity of Gifts and Operation by one and the same Spirit:
Likewise, I do believe, there is a service for all the Gifts of God, as they
are improved to the Honor of the Giver, who is God over all in his
unchangeable Power, blessed for ever.

AN EPISTLE In the Love of GOD, to FRIENDS, etc.
Dear Friends,
IN that True and Universal Love which God has begotten in me, this is with me
to send amongst you, feeling the Spring of Life to be opened from an Inward
sense of the Word of God's Immortal, Divine, and Quickening Power; by which
Power and Word, all things were made and created in the Beginning; by which,
and taking heed thereto, the Lord has made many of you Living Witnesses of
that saying, and it is fulfilling in this our Day. Behold, says the Lord, I
Create a new Heaven and a new Earth, wherein dwells Righteousness; for which
the Lord is only, and alone Worthy of all Praise, and to him be it given, from
all you who are made living Partakers of this his Everlasting Kindness. And
Friends, we have all good cause to wait for the Lord's Teaching, who Teaches
his People to Profit, as he has done many that are gone before, in those
things that belong to their everlasting Well-being, through believing in Christ
Jesus, who is the Wisdom of God, and the Power of God, by which many know, as
sure as ever it was spoken, that Faith is the Gift of God, begotten through the
Divine Influences of his Blessed Spirit; a measure of which is given to every
Man to profit withal, and there is not another Way or Name given under Heaven,
by which Lost Man can be saved and brought back again out of the Fall, to God
his Maker and Creator, but by the Name and Power of Jesus: You know, dear
Friends, who have felt his Restoring Arm to be at work in you, by which you can
testify it is that alone which brings Salvation; and therefore this is no new
thing to you, who also know God's Arm is not shortened, neither is his Word or
Power lessened; but through the same saving Word of Power, you with me, and I
with you, may admire the Virtue that is through it manifest in this our Day, by
which the Blind Eye has been opened, the Deaf Ear unstopp'd, the Lame not only
to walk, but leap as an Heart, through the safe Conducting Power that is in it:
and therefore, Friends, let us all go Hand in Hand together, in this the Good
Old Way, which is also livingly renewed in you that walk in it day after day;
in the sense of which let our Spirits bless the Lord together, and all go
forward toward the Lord's Holy Mountain, for you know Holiness becomes his
House for ever, you to whom the Gospel Sun has so clearly shined, which will
yet more and more, by which many will yet see the Glory that is in it, and
flock to the arising of it, for the Lord has not left himself without
Witnesses, having brought many to a right Understanding of the Blessed way to
the Kingdom of Heaven, which many are yet seeking, which is Christ Jesus, who
gave himself a Ransom for Mankind, that he might redeem them from all Iniquity;
and that is the Universal Love of God for all to Receive, who has sent his Son
to bless us, in turning every Man from the Evil of their ways; for many we know
have been turned to God, and made partakers of that great Blessing, and I would
to God that there were many more in this our Nation brought out of the Fall of
the first Adam, through believing in Christ Jesus the second Adam, the Lord
from Heaven, who is a quickening Spirit, who said, I am the Resurrection and
the Life, he that believes in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live; and
blessed be the Lord, Dear Friends, he has made you living Witnesses of many of
those Blessed Sayings Recorded in the Scriptures of Truth, by the Inspiration
of the same Holy Spirit that gave them forth; and I know it is your desires
with mine, that all who have believed in the Spiritual Appearance of Christ,
may so wait upon him, as to know the end of his coming in them, that thereby
they may come to know the only true God and Jesus Christ; whom to know, is Life
Eternal; which Life Men cannot enjoy, while they are dead in Trespasses and
Sin, whatever they may talk of, read or hear of God and Christ, or the
Scriptures, which they call their Rule: But how few walk according to the
Directions thereof, which directs them to him who saves his People from their
Sins; You also know who are the saved of the Lord, who is of Purer Eyes than to
behold Iniquity with Pleasure; therefore, I think it great pity, that any that
come amongst us, should give or take liberty to such Looseness and Evils that
others were Strangers to, before they knew the precious Truth, as it is now
made manifest. Therefore, to such this Word of Counsel is in my Heart, that
they may now consider, that the Lord is calling all Men every where to
Repentance; and that it is also Cause of Grief to all those tender Hearts, who
receive the Truth in Love, and for the Purity of it, and love the Truth,
because of the true Edification that is in it; and it is you, my Friends, I
know, that feel the Love of God reaching in you, to encourage others to love
him and that which is good; and embrace the Testimony of Truth in their own
Hearts, although some in our Day have turned their backs upon the Truth, and
embrace those things which once they were led out of by it; and others, through
an evil surmising, and prejudicial Spirit, put a slight esteem and value upon
it: But blessed be the Lord, I am thoroughly satisfied there are many that
retain their first love to it, and abide in that Charity which becomes all that
have the true Knowledge of it; and you, my Friends, feel the Sweetness and
Comfort of the Truth: And you, I know, cannot but love all that truly love the
appearance of Christ Jesus, although his Visage is more marred than any Man's,
in and amongst too too many: But you, Friends, who have seen him, as he is the
express Image of his Father's Substance, to you he is most Lovely; and
therefore, feeling the Comforts of God's Holy Spirit with me, I am willing to
send these Lines amongst you, that so together, we may be made Living Partakers
of the Renowned Mercies of our God, who does not forget to be gracious, to his
Children and People, who wait and think upon his Name, whose Name is above
every Name, to which every Knee must bow, and confess to the Name of Jesus, who
is Emanuel, God with us; and by that measure of his Blessed Spirit given to us,
he is in us, by which measure, many have, and all may know a Profiting toward
God, and those things that belong to their Everlasting Peace which according to
the Apostles Ehortation, let us all endeavor to keep with all Men. But Dear
Friends, let there be a moviance and particular concern for it and the
preservation of it, in and amongst all the Called and Gathered by the Lord, to
the Testimony of his Spiritual Appearance in us; and therefore, Dear Friends,
in the Love of God, I beseech you all dwell, that we may be a People preserved
from all those hurtful things, wrong and unruly Spirits, that we see take so
much place in some, but blessed be the Lord, there is an Eye open that sees the
Foundation of God stands sure for ever, and the Lord knows who are his People,
and the Sheep of his Pasture; them he has and will feed, and they shall drink
of the Streams of Shilo's Brooks that run softly, and will refresh all the
truly thirsty Souls, for them the Lord has and will fill; and it is for your
sakes, dear Friends, that the Lord opens the Sluices of his Love, that you may
all drink of the Streams of Living Water, and be revived this day in him, and
comforted in one another; for he will fill your Hearts with the Treasure that
is Heavenly, and never fades away, nor wears; and as you all walk in the Truth,
and continue in that Love, which was begotten by the Truth, in which Love I
know you all can do no less, than put a right esteem and value upon the
continued Goodness and Mercies of the Lord, in which Love of God, none can
hurt, wrong, or evilly entreat one another; and this Love will bring and keep
all things in good order amongst the Called, Faithful and Chosen People of the
Lord, in this present Age and Day: Therefore, dear Friends, it is my hearty
desire to the Lord, that all may feel this Love of God, to draw their Hearts
more and more to love him, and that Grace and Truth that comes by Jesus Christ,
that so all may draw water out of the Well of Salvation, and drink abundantly
of the River of God's Pleasure, which proceeds from under the Throne of our
God, and the Lamb for ever.

A few Lines Chiefly to the Tender Children of FRIENDS*
TEnder Friends, There is a little with me in the Love of God to you, some of
which may be better qualified, and more ready to receive that which is Good,
than others are: But Tender Friends, for want of a a true Regard and
Consideration of the Love of God, some rather give way to gratify a vain Mind,
which is ready and apt to be taken with Pride, and the vain Glory of this
fading World, which does greatly Eclipse that Good in your first Nature, that
otherwise would appear more Beautiful, and it does also hinder the Good Seed
that is sown in your Hearts from taking Root downward, by which it should bring
forth Fruit upward to the Praise of the Lord, who is the Good Husbandman; and
therefore tender Friends all, consider the Love of God that is shed abroad in
many Hearts, and yet runs toward you, who are the Younger Generation, for that
end that you may all have a true Regard to the Lord, and to your Tender
Parents, whose Tender Love and Care may be over you for good; for I have many
times thought it great pity, that any Children should evilly treat their
Parents for their Tender Love and Care toward them, but since it is so, as we
have sometimes seen, Parents may the better receive every good Caution, and in
the Authority of Truth, keep Children in Subjection, and according to the
Apostles Exhortation, Children will have cause to take it well, they are
learned when they are young to obey their Parents in the Lord, for this, says
he, is right; and therefore, Tender Children, incline your Hearts to love the
Lord, his Way and Truth, and obey your Parents, that live therein; for although
it has happened ill with some through their Disobedience, yet there is good
cause to hope well for many others of you, who may be a succeeding Generation
of the Faithful, many of which are gathered to their everlasting rest; and
hoping well for many, we cannot but desire well for all our Children, that they
may be Wise, and learn the Fear of the Lord, which will be a Fountain of Life
to preserve them from the Snares of Death, and keep them from those many sorts
of Evils, and hurtful things, which otherwise may possibly bring such an Evil
Day upon them, as to dishonor God, grieve their Tender Parents, and disappoint
themselves of true Happiness here and hereafter. Therefore it is again with me
to say, Hear and fear the Great God, for there is need of renewing this
Exhortation amongst some Children and young People that come amongst us: And
again, The fear of the Lord was said to be the beginning of true Wisdom; and I
know many, for your encouragement, can confirm the Testimony, that to depart
from Evil, will give, or bring you to a good Understanding what will Become,
Adorn, or Accomplish you, as Men and Women fearing God: And truly, Friends, all
other will stand you in little or no stead, as you come to love and embrace the
Plain and Modest way of Truth, and dwell therein. And again, let me tell you, I
know some were Educated in many things commendable amongst other Sober People;
yet when it pleased the Lord to open their Eyes to behold the Light of this
glorious day that is sprung from on high, and has visited us, to give the
Light of the Knowledge of God in the face of his Son Christ Jesus, we then saw
that many of those things were not consistent with the Truth, as it is now made
manifest; therefore I know some were not only willing to cast off, forsake, and
deny, but desirous to be stripped of all, that they might be Clothed with the
Heavenly Robe of Righteousness, and wear those Garments that they so often
heard recommended by the Servants of the Lord, which you may all wear, as you
take heed to the Sanctifying Word of Life in your own Hearts, which the Apostle
recommends as that most sure Word of Prophecy, which, says he, You will all do
well to take heed unto, as unto a Light that shines in a dark place, till the
day dawn, and Day Star arise in your Hearts, which blessed be the Lord, many in
our day have known, whose desires are, that you may also come to behold the
Glory of the Son of Righteousness to shine in and through you, that thereby
others may be invited to come and taste and see how good the Lord is; and
therefore Dear Children, all hasten from off the Borders of Rebellion, and be
faithful to God, that you may be Partakers of his everlasting Blessing, and
learn Submission with humble and due respects to God, and your tender Parents,
in which mind you will all be ready to return Thanksgiving to the Lord and them
for his Love, their Care, and wholesome Advice to you, for your true and
everlasting well-being.

Then you the Golden Age may see,
As in the Truth you grow;
And in the Love and Fear of God,
His Secrets you may know.
Therefore, dear Children, seek the Lord,
And love his Holy Truth;
Be Meek, be Sober, and be Grave,
This will become the Youth.
And then the Lord will Riches give,
Durable you shall see;
Heavenly Treasure from above
To you will opened be.
As you do prize the chiefest good,
And from all bad refrain;
And shun all evil to do good,
God's Favor you will obtain.
In order unto which seek God,
With broken Hearts this day,
And love his Light and Truth, and walk
Undefiled in the way.
That so his wrath may not break forth,
But he may stay his Hand,
And in the room of Judgments may
Send Blessings on our Land.
So in true Love unto you all,
I bid you all farewell;
And recommend you to God's Fear;
Where you and I should dwell.
That we may be preserved
From all presumptuous things,
And in true Love to God submit,
On Earth to Heavenly things.
That all may find the peace,
Which in true Love does flow;
For God is Love, and no other
Can the Devil overthrow.
And therefore Children all,
Grow in Love and good Will,
That your Age may Excel
God's Royal Law fulfill.
These following Lines are to you, my tender Friends, who may be counted of the
Younger Generation that are already sensible of the Love of God, manifest through
the appearance of the Son of his Love, the Hope of that Glory which is revealed
in you. Dear Friends, the Bowels of true Love yearns toward you with many
desires to the Lord, that you may all be preserved near to him, by a daily
waiting upon him, that so your strength may be more and more renewed in him,
for the Enemy of all Righteousness will endeavor by one means or other to draw
your Minds from the true and safe Center, where you may be preserved Close and
Inward with the Lord, for he has many ways to deceive: Sometimes, he may be
endeavoring to hurry your Minds, and lead you too fast; and other times he may
be seeking to hinder you from walking in the strait and narrow way which leads
to Life Eternal; therefore, dear Friends, as my experience in that and other
things, let me tell you, there is no safety in any state that I have yet seen,
but as the Watch is kept, diligently waiting upon the Lord, by which you may
come more and more to know his Mind and Will, and then all be careful how you
perform it, and in the Love of God, all be careful, that you go not from that
measure of his Spirit given you to profit withal: But all wait more and more to
be taught by it, that more advantage by the Grace of God, you may all receive
to your Immortal Souls, as you continue in the self-denying way, in taking up
the Cross to all those things that may present, or are of a contrary nature to
the plain and moderate way that Truth leads in, for the Lord is the same as
ever he was, and all that come to him, must come by the same Door of entrance,
into the Sheep fold of Eternal Rest; for there is no other way, but by Christ
Jesus, whose Appearance is still the same as ever, although through the Faithful
Sufferings of many Faithful Friends, there was gained Outward Liberty; which
blessed be the Lord, is yet continued amongst us, by which the way is made more
easy: Yet my Friends, there is the same grand Enemy of Truths Prosperity to
encounter withal; but blessed be the Lord, Friends, you do know your Weapons
are not Carnal, but Spiritual and Mighty through God, and therefore keep on
your Spiritual Armor, that you may be able to quench all the Fiery Darts of the
Wicked One, which may be many, as you walk in your Spiritual Travel the same
way that the Lord has led and brought many out of Spiritual Aegypts Darkness,
and through the Waters, who has also fed them in the Wilderness, by whose Care
and Kindness, blessed be his Name, many have been and are, as the good Spy,
ready to give Testimony of the good Land that flows with Milk and Heavenly
Divine Sweetness, which is the Spiritual Honey, by which the Spiritual Man is
nourished, and good Will daily increased, which through the Love of God, will
more and more be manifested; therefore, Friends, be all encouraged to go on in
the Light of the Lord, where you may see the Enemy in all his approaching, that
you may be safely conducted in that way that the Lord would have all his People
to walk in, that by walking in Christ the way, you that are of the Younger
Generation may partake of God's everlasting Blessing, which he promised to
Abraham his Servant, when he said, In blessing I will bless thee, and in
multiplying I will multiply thy seed: For the fulfilling of which, Dear
Friends, let us all wait upon the Lord, that thereby we may receive Grace for
Grace from him; that in the receiving of his Grace and Mercy, our Hearts may be
more and more bowed, and Spirits broken, that a Sacrifice of Praise and
Thanksgiving may be offered unto him of his own preparing, who is worthy of all
Praise, Glory and Honor, to whom be it given at this time, henceforth, and for
ever, says my Soul, your Friend, Sister, and Fellow Traveller in Spirit for
Sion's Prosperity.
