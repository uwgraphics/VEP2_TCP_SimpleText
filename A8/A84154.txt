Virtus post Funera vivit. Mors mihi lucrum. Aetatis Suae 48

funerary monument
AN ELEGY, Consecrated to the inestimable MEMORY of our late most Famous
MONARCH, CHARLES the First, by the Grace of God, King of England, Scotland,
France, and Ireland; who was Beheaded on Tuesday, Jan. 30. 1648.
Together with the manifold Miseries and Calamities that since have lamentably
afflicted these Three Nations, and the MEANS now left to procure a speedy, and
a safe Redress.
WEep, ENGLAND, weep; help all to raise our Cry,
Here ENGLANDS Glory, and her Shame does lie!
Who Innocent was to the Scaffold lead,
And low as Death stooped his Anointed Head:
Who did a willing Sacrifice become,
To expiate those procured his Martyrdom.
And by rude Hands being brought upon the Stage,
Lost his own Life to please the Peoples Rage:
So loud his Virtues do his Praises sing,
As if not only he had been the King
Of England, Scotland, Ireland, and of France,
But King of Prudence, Justice, Temperance,
And noble Fortitude: and thus had more
Crowns, then all Kings of Europe had before.
And though in the Days of his Serener Reign,
We did not so much suffer, as complain:
Yet since his Death we feel the Times far rougher,
And still the more we plain, the more we suffer.
So much we suffer, we have seen of late
Religion run to Ruin with the State:
That Sleeves of Lawn may now in pity stand,
To wipe the Blood off from Religion's hand.
We Superstition feared, when all in haste,
Profaneness entered, and laid all things waste:
And Schism of no Religion now admits
But what the Fever of her Fancy fits.
Thou did not dye alone, Great CHARES, thy Fate,
Involved Three Kingdoms, and the Churches State;
That now without a Shepherd we do stray,
And are to every Wolf become a prey:
Nor is there Hope of any sound Redress,
(So desperate are all our Griefs) unless
Heaven shall be pleased, our Shepherd being gone,
To send soon to us our dear Shepherds Son.
London, Printed by R. W. for R. G. 1660.
