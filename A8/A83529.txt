An Act for regulating of the Privy Council, and for taking away the Court,

WHereas by the Great Charter many times confirmed in Parliament, It is
enacted, That no Freeman shall be taken or imprisoned, or disseised of his
Freehold, or Liberties, or free Customs, or be Outlawed, or exiled, or
otherwise destroyed, and that the King will not pass upon him, or condemn him
but by lawful Judgment of his Peers, or by the Law of the land; And by
another statute made in the fifth year of the Reign of King Edward the third,
It is Enacted, That no man shall be attached by any accusation, nor forejudged
of life or lim, nor his Lands, Tenements, Goods, nor Chattels seized into ^he
Kings hands against the form of the great Charter, and the Law of the land. And
by another statute made in the five and twentieth year of the Reign of the same
^ing Edward the third, It is accorded, assented and established, that none
shall be ^ken by petition, or suggestion made to the King or to His Council,
unless it be by indictment or presentment of good and lawful people of the
same Neighborhood ^here such deeds be done, in due manner, or by process made
by Writ original at ^e common Law, and that none be put out of his Franchise
or Freehold, unless he ^^ duly brought in, to answer, and forejudged of the
same by the course of the Law, ^^d if any thing be done against the same, it
shall be redressed and holden for none, ^^d by another statute made in the
eight and twentieth year of the Reign of the same ^^ng Edward the third, It is
amongst other things Enacted, that no man of what estate ^^condition soever he
be, shall be put out of his Lands or Tenements, nor taken, nor ^^prisoned, nor
disinherited, without being brought in to answer by due process of ^^w, And by
another statute made in the two and fourtieth year of the Reign of the said
King Edward the third, It is Enacted that no man by pur to answer with out
presenament before Justices, or matter of Record, or by due process and Writ
are ginall, according to the old Law of the land, and if any thing be done to

statute made in the six and thirtieth year of the same King Edward the third,
It is amongst other things Enacted, That all pleas which shall be pleaded in
any courts before any the Kings Justices, or in His other places, or before any
of his other Ministers, or in the courts and places of any other Lords within
the Realm, shall be entered and enrolled in latin, And whereas by the statute
made in the third year of King Henry the seventh, power is given to the
Chancellor, the Lord Treasurer of England for the time being, and the Keeper
of the Kings privy seal, or two of them, calling unto them a Bishop and a
Temporal Lord of the Kings most honorable Council, and the two chief
Justices of the Kings bench and common pleas for the time being, or other two
Justices in their absence to proceed, as in that act is expressed, for the
punishment of some particular offenses therein mentioned, And by the statute
made in the one and twentieth year of King Henry the eighth, The President of
the Council is associated to join with Lord Chancellor and other Judges in the
said statute, o^ the third of Henry the seventh mentioned, But the said Judges
have not kept themselves to the points limited by the said statute, but have
undertaken to punish where no Law does warrant, and to make Decrees for things
having no such authority, and to inflict heavier punishments then by any Law
is warranted.

And forasmuch as all matters examinable, or determinable before the said
Judges, o^ in the Court commonly called the Star Chamber, may have their proper
remedy an^ redress, and their due punishment, and correction by the Common Law
of the Land and in the ordinary course of Justice elsewhere; And forasmuch as
the reasons and motives inducing the erection and continuance of that Court do
now cease, and the proceedings, Censures, and Decrees of that Court, have by
experience been foun^ to be an intolerable burden to the subject, and the
means to introduce an Arbitra^^ power and Government; And forasmuch as the
Councell-Table, has of late time assumed unto it self, a power to intermeddle
in Civil causes and matters, only ^^ private interrest between party, and
party, and have adventured to determine ^^ the Estates, and Liberties of the
Subject, contrary to the Law of the Land, and the rights and privileges of the
Subject, by which great and manifold mischiefs, an^ inconveniences have
arisen, and happened, and much incertainty by means of su^^ proceedings has
been conceived concerning men's rights, and estates; For setli^^ whereof, and
preventing the like in time to come;

Be it Ordained and enacted by Authority of this present Parliament, That t^^
said Court commonly called the Star Chamber, and all Jurisdiction, power, and
a^^ thority, belonging unto, or exercised in the same Court, or by any the
Judges, Officers, or Ministers thereof, be from the first day of August, in the
year or our Lo^^ God, one thousand six hundred forty and one, clearly and
absolutely dissolved, takeaway, and determined, and that from the said first
day of August, neither the Lord Chancellor, or Keeper of the great seal of
England, the Lord Treasurer of England the Keeper of the King Privy Seal, or
President of the Council, nor any Bishop temporal Lord, Privy-Councellor, or
Judge, or Justice whatsoever, shall have an^ power, or authority to hear,
examine, or determine any matter, or thing whatsoever, in the said Court
commonly called the Star Chamber, or to make, pronounce, deliver any Judgment,
sentence, Order, or Decree, or to do any Judicial, or Minsteriall Act in the
said Court; And that all and every Act, and Acts of Parliament and all and
every Article, clause, and sentence in them, and every of them, by which any
Jurisdiction, power, or authority is given, limited, or appointed unto the
said Court, commonly called the Star Chamber, or unto all, or any the Judges,
Officers, or Ministers thereof, or for any proceedings to be had, or made in
the said Court, or for any matter, or thing to be drawn into question,
examined, or determined there, shall for so much as concerns the said Court
of Star Chamber, and the power, and authority thereby given unto it, be from
the said first day of August repealed, and absolutely revoked and made void.

And be it likewise enacted, That the like Jurisdiction now used and exercised
in the Court before the President, and Council, in the Marches of Wales, and
also in the Court, before the President, and Council established in the
Northern parts: And also in the Court, commonly called the Court of the Duchy
of Lancaster, held before the Chancellor, and Council of that Court. And also
in the Court of Exchequer, of the County Palatine of Chester, held before the
Chamberlain and Council of that Court; The like Jurisdiction being exercised
there, shall from the said first day of August, one thousand six hundred forty
and one, be also repealed, and absolutely revoked and made void, any Law,
prescription, custom, or usage, Or the said ^tatute, made in the third year of
King Henry the seventh; Or the Statute, made ^he one and twentieth of Henry the
eight, Or any Act, or Acts of Parliament here^ofore had, or made, to the
contrary thereof in any wise notwithstanding; And that from henceforth no
Court, Council, or place of Judicature shall be erected, or^ained,
constituted, or appointed within this Realm of England, or Dominion of Wales,
which shall have, use, or exercise the same, or the like Jurisdiction, as is,
or ^ath been used, Practiced, or exercised in the said Court of Star Chamber.

Be it likewise declared, and enacted by authority of this present Parliament,
That neither his Majesty, nor his Privy-Councell, have, or ought to have any
Jurisdiction, power, or authority, by English Bill, Petition, Articles, Libell,
or any other Arbitrary way whatsoever, to examine or draw into question,
determine, or dispose ^f the Lands, Tenements, Hereditaments, Goods, or
Chattels, of any the Subjects ^f this Kingdom: But that the same ought to be
tried, and determined in the ordinary Courts of Justice, and by the ordinary
course of the Law.

And be it further provided, and enacted, That if any Lord Chancellor, or
Keeper of the great seal of England, Lord Treasurer, Keeper of the Kings Privy
^al, President of the Council, Bishop, Temporal Lord, Privy Counselor,
Judge, (...) Justice whatsoever, shall offend, or do any thing contrary to the
