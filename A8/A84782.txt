A DISCOVERY Of some fruits OF The Profession Religion Ministry Government
of this NATION, Which makes the Land to mourn, and vexes the soul of the
Righteous from day to day.
Also the Relation of the world discovered, and wherein it differs from the
pure Relation.
With a few words to the Magistrates that do cast Christ into prison, and will
not visit him when they have done, nor suffer his friends and brethren to visit
him.
OH how does the Profession, Religion, and Ministry, and Government of this
Nation shame it self, that drunkenness, oaths, and cursing is heard in the
streets, which causes the Land to mourn, and destroys the creatures of the
Lord, and such the Lord commands his servants, and children, to reprove, and
they are made a prey upon who reprove in the Gate, sin and evil, drunkenness,
cursing and swearing, which is heard up and down the streets, by their faith,
by their troth, and many other oaths, when the creatures of God cross their
will they will bid a pox on them, and swear, as Gods wounds, and these cursed
languages, cursed speakers, for reproving such the children of God are hated
and persecuted by them that should punish evil doers; here justice falls in
the streets, and righteousness is stopped for running down, for the cry of
righteousness is spoken against, for when the cry of righteousness is sounded
in the streets against unrighteousness, against drunkenness, against
deceitful merchandise, cozening and cheating, they are sent to prison as
peace-breakers; and when they cry in the streets against oaths, that the
Covenant of light might be received, and to turn from their oaths unto him who
says, Swear not at all (which cause the Land to mourn) such are cast into
Prisons, and because they cannot swear but abide in the Covenant of light and
life, which says, Swear not at all. And now is the cry at midnight among all
the professions in the world, and now is all profession seen and Religion seen
to be in the night, it is midnight with it: and now is the voice cried among
you, that says. All flesh is grass, and shall wither and fade as the flower,
and God will stain the glory of man and lay the Crowns in the dust, and bring
the honor into contempt, for the end of Religion and Profession is seen to be
without the life of what they do profess, for what mocking scorning,
reproaching, plotting and inventing against them that be the children of light,
who be in the possession and the life of the Scripture, what hallowing and
shouting there is against them in the streets, which is unbeseemly, and how do
the people manifest that they are ill bred, and how do the people manifest
their corrupt manners by their evil communications, as let the streets and the
high ways witness; but how is youth run into wantonness which should be kept
in soberness, and ancient people how are they turned into foolishness, and
shame themselves, and the breeding of their children, which should be trained
up in modesty and soberness and the fear of the Lord, and they themselves walk
in gravity adorned with meek and quiet spirits, which is with the Lord of great
price: O how can you but expect Gods judgments to come upon you, and his wrath
to be turned against you, and his fury, who with your lips profess him, but
your hearts be found afar off, and his life in practice deny; where will you
stand in the day of Judgment, for you that be wicked will be as the chafe,
who in words profess God, but in works deny him. Was it ever in any age as it
is now, men that profess the Kingdom of Christ, and of God, and yet cannot
endure to have the Kingdom of Satan to be cried against, to have pride cried
against openly, works of darkness cried against openly, pleasures cried
against openly, drunkenness cried against openly, oppression cried against
openly, that which is not just, not holy, not good, cried against openly, and
deceitful merchandise in the markets, and lying, cried against openly, and
fighting, quarrelling, oaths and cursed speaking, cried against openly, which
Christ cried openly against, and said, Swear not at all, whose Kingdom is not
of this world, and testified against the world that the works thereof are
evil, therefore they hated him; and now men profess his kingdom, and yet
cannot endure these things to be cried against; and Deceivers, and blind
guides, cried against openly, they cannot endure, as Christ did, Mat. 23. and
false Teachers to be cried against openly, or writ against openly, as Peter and
Jude did, and as the Prophets Jeremiah, Isaiah, Micha, and Ezekiel did; but
such as are commanded of the Lord to cry against such, and to witness against
such, are with them that profess the Kingdom of Christ persecuted, and cast
into holes and prisons, and yet shame does not strike their persecutors in the
face, but God will cover your face with shame, and night shall be upon you, and
all your tinkling, and haughtiness, and bravery, God will bring down. O awake
and tremble you careless ones that are grown so lofty, and fear before the
Lord, to make a profession of his Son, which are not come to own his light,
which from him does come, and is given to you to believe, which if you do
believe, you shall not abide in darkness, but shall have the light of life;
but not believing in the light which is given you to believe, this is your
condemnation, the light says Christ.

Oh how do the Teachers of the world manifest now their folly, and madness,
and their persecuting blind zeal, which does incense the Magistrates to cast
the lambs of God into prison: how does the profession of the world who profess
a Church, and Gospel, and Christ, young men, young women, old men, old women,
but now are turned scoffers and mockers, which shows the end of their
profession, to be without the possession: Oh how has pride stolen away the
heart of man from sincerity, which carries him after toys and fables, and
after fashions and lusts of his eye, which manifests to be as the wild
Asse-colt, and shows to be as the wild Heifer, that shame and modesty is
wanting in the streets, and there is instead of that scorn and derision.
Therefore every one of you having a light from Christ the light of the world,
who does enlighten every one that comes into the world, which light loving it,
leads you from the ways of the world and the world, for ye cannot be Heirs of
two Kingdoms. And you that cannot endure that wickedness should be reproved
in the Gate, but persecute them that do, and cast them into prison, you are
the incouragers of evil doers, and not of that which is good; but the Lord God
of glory is come and coming to exalt his Kingdom, and overthrow wickedness
out of its place, and give the glory to his Son, and the glory of man stain
and confound, and exalt his truth and his Kingdom over all, which shall answer
the light in every man.

I am the light of the world, and do inlighten every one that comes into the
world: Now every one of you being ^inlightned with the light that comes from
Christ, which light shows you, you should not lie, tells you, you should not be
drunk, tells you, you should not take Gods name in vain, tells you, you should
not follow whoredom, which light tells you, you should not cozen, nor cheat
one another, nor swear, but keep to yea and nay in all your communications: Now
with this light in you which Christ has enlightened you withal, you see evil
thoughts, and evil d^sires, and evil affections, this is the true light that
does manifest these things before mentioned, and this is the true light which
does reprove when you act those things contrary to the light, which if you love
the light and walk in it, you will come to learn of Christ, who says, Learn of
me from whence it comes, who inlightneth every man that comes into the world,
that all men through him might believe. Now you poor people you all are
enlightened with this light, and you all know these things before mentioned to
be contrary to the light, with the light which it manifests: And you rich
people and great men you have a light in you which comes from Christ Jesus
which shows you your hearts and sin and evil, when that your hearts are gross
and deceitful, this light within shows it you, which is the light that comes
from Christ the true light, who lights every man that comes into the world,
that all men through him might believe, and he that believes receives the
Gospel which is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believes: And
every one in particular waiting in the light given to you to believe which
comes from Christ, who says, Learn of me, I am the way, I am the truth, and
no man comes unto the Father but by me; here you will feel your Teacher that
cannot be removed into a corner, Christ Jesus, who says, Learn of me; This is
my beloved Son hear ye him, says God: And here every one having a light from
Christ given to you to believe, who says, Learn of me, here is your Teacher,
but if you hate this light, which from Christ does come, and follow the worlds
Teachers, the hireling which deceives you, and follow such as the Apostles and
the Prophets and Christ cried against, as Isaiah Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Micha,
and Peter, and Jude, and Mat. 23. as you may read, now these that gave forth
Scripture say these are the Deceivers, and were witnessed against; and Christ
has said, Learn of me, I am the way, no man comes unto the Father but by me,
now if you hate this light, and follow the forementioned contrary to the light,
this is your condemnation, the light, says Christ; but if you love the light
which is Christ, who says, learn of me, you will find your Teacher, as you lie
in your beds, and as you are in your occasions; which will keep you to yea and
nay in your communications, for whatsoever is more is evil from the light
contrary to the truth.

THe Relation that stands in destroying is by the children of light denied, all
such who live out of the light and out of it walk, who wear the old Garment,
whose minds is corrupt, and has a wisdom and with it know not God, and has a
knowledge and with it corrupt themselves, and has a humility but feigned, and
has a worship but in the will, and has a righteousness but in the self, and
speaks the high words but it is in the hypocrisy, and has a liberty but in
the flesh, where the Spirit is in prison, who in Cains way is gone, has not an
habitation in God whose affections are below in the Earth and to it, and serve
the lusts and the pleasures, whose conversation is among the wicked and there
is the worlds Relation, where lodges the strife, and debate, and deceit, and
disdain, and setting up that which God will throw down, now while this is
standing which is contrary to the light, they that in the light do walk and be
in it those they deny, and see that which leads nature out of its course, which
set the whole course of nature on fire, and there the whole world are in
confusion, and all the tongues are unbridled where power over them is not while
that reigns that leads nature out of course, his Religion is vain and that
Relation stands out of truth, but all such as to the light be turned see with
the light, that does manifest, what leads nature out of course, the marriage
that is honorable and the marriage that is not honorable, and what sets the
whole course of nature on fire, and what leads nature into course, where the
pure Relation the entrance of it is received, where the self and its
righteousness is denied and the righteousness of Christ received, where the
worship of the will is denied and the worship of God in Spirit and truth is
received, where self righteousness is denied and Christ the righteousness of
God received, and the former conversation put off and the conversation in
Heaven witnessed, and the affections below changed and the affections which are
above come to, here is the pure Relation known without guile, which are out of
Cains way, where the habitation in God is witnessed and seen, where the just
lives by his faith, and the honoring in the Lord known, the true humility
learned of Christ, who is not of the world, though it by him was made, who
lights every man that comes into the world, who is man's way out of it, which
light is man's condemnation if he does not believe in it: And the Relation which
is in the world who hate light is in the lust where the perverseness is, in the
love of the world, where the envy is, where the invention is, selfishnesse,
crossenesse, perverseness, backbiting, maliciousness, filling with
unrighteousness, yet they have a love, yet they have a Relation; now the light
which comes from Christ, the beloved of God, where the love of God is received,
the worlds Relation denied, for the Relation of the world destroys and
devoures, but the children of light, which be in the Relation out of the world,
live in peace, unity, and fellowship, and comfort enjoyed in the Holy Ghost. So
all you that profess Relation in word, and envy lodges in your heart against
one another, and yet flatter one another to your faces, and back-bite one
another behind the back, such Relations we do deny, and have a witness in your
own conscience against it. And all that profess Relation to one another, and
love and friendship with the tongue, and in heart deceive one another, and
cozen one another, and cheat one another, and lie and dissemble one with
another, all such Relations we deny and have a witness in your conscience
against it. And all such as profess Religion, or worship, or humility,
righteousness and the Scripture, Christ and the Prophets words, and live out
of their life, and live in envy and malice, and yet profess you have a
Relation to Christ and God whom you have not seen, and you love him and do not
love them whom you have seen, such Relations we do deny. And all such as cry
up your experiences, high notions, your manifestations as you call them,
dispensations as you call them, and live in pride, strife, and envy, debates,
derision, scorn loftiness, high-mindednesse, be out of the light, and out of
the way in Cains, and out of the pure Relation, we have a witness in your
conscience against those things, which lets you see what you possess, and let
you profess no more if to it you hearken, which turns from the world and the
Relations therein, for all who believe not the light and are not to it come,
have a love but it is in the world, and a Relation but it is in the world,
which is enmity to God, so that relation which is enmity is denied with the
light, that love which is enmity is denied with the light which leads to the
pure Relation, the pure love which envies not, where the destroyer and devourer
is rebuked.

YOu that be Magistrates which do cast Christ into prison and will not visit
him when you have done, nor suffer his friends and brethren to visit him in
prison, and there you keep him in prison till he hunger and thirst, and you
prison him as a vagabond, who has no place to lay his head, sick and in prison
and you visit him nor: but the corner stone is set up, and the rock of ages
manifest, and him who bears the Government upon his shoulders, whose kingdom
is without end, and dominion has no end, which is an everlasting dominion,
which dominion is over all dominions, whose Scepter is righteousness, whose
Law royal stands over all, answers that of God in all, and respects no man's
person, but is holy, just, and righteous, persect and good, whose Priesthood is
royal everlasting that never changes, who lights every man that comes into
the world, that men might believe and see the way out of the world, Christ the
light, the way, the truth, who is the Covenant of light, of peace, and of life.
Was not Christ crucified in Sodom and Gomorrah spiritually? and are not they
Sodomites that imprison him? and are not the Sodomites them that live in
fullness of bread, and idleness, and the filthy conversation, which the
righteous soul grieves and vexes, which Christ is Shepherd of, and the
Bishop, who is a witness in all consciences which witnesses against the lusts
that war against the soul? Was not all the profession of Christ before he was
manifest in the flesh, and when he was manifested in the flesh, hypocrisy
among them that profess him in words and did not believe in him who was the
light but cast him into prison, and he was sick and they visited him not, and
was hungry and they fed him not, and he was naked and they clothed him not,
such as neither knew his voice, nor the Prophets that showed the coming of him:
and is not all the profession of Christ now hypocrisy among them that profess
him in words and do not believe in him who is the light that lights every
man that comes into the world, but cast him into prisons, and holes, and
dungeons, and he is sick and you visit him not, and hungry and you feed him
not, and thirsty and you give him no drink, and naked and you cloth him not,
but into prison cast him as a vagabond who has no place to lay his head, The
foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests, but the Son of man has
no place to lay his head, Christ the same yesterday to day and for ever.
Therefore awake you Rulers and fear the Lord and hear the voice of the Son of
God that you may live, for now is Christ come to reign, the same that ever was,
whom into prison you do cast, and with your wills would not suffer him to
reign; but Christ will reign who is not borne by the will of man, who is King
and rules, and now reigns in his Kingdom and dominion which is without end,
and in his power and in his fulness, who fills all things, and thousands of
his fullness have received, and of his power, as many as have received him, to
become the Sons of God. From them whom the world scornfully calls Quakers.
