DECLARATION OF HIS EXCELLENCY JAMES MARQVES OF MONTROSE, EARL OF KINCAIRN,
LORD GRAEME, BARRON OF MONTDEV, LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR AND CAPTAIN GENERAL FOR
HIS MAJESTY OF THE KINGDOM OF SCOTLAND.

At Gottenberge. ANNO MDCXLIX.

DECLARATION, OF HIS EXCELLENCY, JAMES MARQUIS OF MONTROSE.
THough it may seem, Public (both) and Private Injury, Rather then matter of
Duty or Just Procedeur, to do any Act whatsumever that can in so much as
appear to dispute, the Clearness of this present service, or to hold such
enemies as a Party; The Justice of his Majesty's cause, The wickedness of those
Rebels, and my oun Integrity, Being (all of them) so weell and so thoroughly
knoun as they are;

Yet the further to confirm the world, The more to encourage all who are to
engage, And the Pouerfullier to convince many, who have Harmlesly been
envolved, and Innocently Inveigled, in those desperate courses; I do in the
name of his most sacred Majesty, and by virtue of the Pouer and Authority
granted by him unto me. Declare.

That Howbeit there has been (and still are) ane Horrid and Infamous Faction of
Rebels within the Kingdom of Scotland [who most causlesly at first did hatch
Rebellion against his late Majesty of Glorious Memory, And when he had granted
unto them (by their oun acknouledgement) all their Violent and most unjust
desyrs, They were so far from resting, notwithstanding, satisfied (as being
Themselves able to find no further Pretenses) They did Pernitiously Solicit ane
Party in the Kingdom of England, to beginn, where Shame and Necessity had
forced them to break off, And when Those of the English (being by much less
wicked) would have often Satisfied themselves by his Majesty's extraordinary
Concession; (They then not intending the desperate lenths which fatal success
and their hollow Practisers did thereafter dryve them too) Then did they still
thurst in (as Oyll to the Fire, and Ganger to the Wound) until they had
randred all Irrecoverable; Neither were they contented in the Fox skinn allone,
to act this Their so Brutish a Tragedy (which indeed could never have served
their ends) But while they had received all Imaginable Satisfaction at Home,
(As their werry oun Acts of Parliament does witness, wherein, They say, That
his Late Majesty parted a Contented King from a Contented People,) Fynding
their Rebel Brood, how they had begot in England beginning to lessen, and that
his Majesty's Party appeared to have by much the better, They not only contrary
to the Duty of subjects, But all Faith, Covenants, Oaths, Attestations, to
which they had so often Invoked God, his Angels, the World, and all as
witnesses, Did enter with a strong Army the Kingdom of England, Persecute
their Prince, in a Foreign Nation, Assist a company of stranger Rebels,
against their Native King, and those of his Loyal Party within that same
Kingdom, Except for which the whole world does know his Majesty had without
all Peradventure Prevailed; And not ashamed of all this, (which even many of
their oune Party did blush to awow) when his late Majesty was by (God knows)
how many unhappy treacheries, redacted to think upon extreme Courses for his
safety, He was pleased, out of his so much Invincible goodness, and Natural
Inclination toward his Native People (Notwithstanding all Their former
Villainies) To choose that Ignoble Party to fall upon, Thinking that Those who his
Greatness and their Duty could not obliedge, His Missery, and their
Compassion, might perhaps move with Pity; Yet too Justly fearing their Punik
Faiths, He first resolved to Engage them by a Treaty, After which, when by many
Intercourses, his Majesty had received all manner of Assurances, (which tho
Shame would make them willingly excuse, Yet guylt will let Them have nothing to
say for it, It being so undeniable and to all the world so knoun a Truth)
Casting himself in their hands, They (Contrary, to all Faith and Faction, Trust
of Friends, Duty of subjects, Laws of Hospitality, Nature, Nations, Divine and
Humane, to which there has never been Precedent, nor can ever be a Follouer)
Most Infamously, and beyond all Imaginable Expression of Invincible Baseness,
(to the Blush of Christians Abomination of Mankind) Sold their Sovereign ower,
to their Mercyles Fellow Traitors to be destroyed; with whom How they have
Comploted his Destruction, Their secret Intercourses, both before, In the time,
and since his Horrid Murder, do too evidently declare; Of all which Villainies,
They are so little touched with the guylt, as they now beginn with his Majesty
upon the same Scores they left with his Father, Declaring him King with
Provisoes, so Robbing him of all Right while they would seem to give some unto
him, Pressing him to Join with Those who have liged all his Dominions in
Rebellion and laid all Royal Pouer into the Dust, That in effect he would
Condemn the Memory of his Sacred Father, Destroy himself, and Ruin his
Faithful Party within all those Dominions; Their are Those who at First entered
England, Soliciting all to Rise in this Desperate Rebellion (as the Prologue of
their enseuing Tragedy (who who were the Cheeff and Main Instruments of all the
Battles; Slaughters, and Bloody Occasions, within that Kingdom, who sold
Their Sovereign unto the Death, And that yet Diggs in his Grave, and who are
more Pernitiously Hatching the Destruction of his present Majesty, by the same
bare, Old, Outdated Treacheries, then ever they did his Sacred Fathers] Yet the
People (in General) Having been but Ignorantly misled to it (Whose eyes now for
most part, God hes opened, and turned their hearts, (at least in their Desires)
to Their Dutyful obedience, And that there hes still been a Loyal Party, who
have givvin Such Proffs of their Integrity, as his Majesty is mowed with a
tender Compassion; for those Righteous sakes, in behalf of All, who now at last,
have Remorse for their former misdemeanors. His Majesty is not only willing
to Pardon every one, (Excepting Such who upon clear evidencies shall be found
guylty of that most Damnable Fact of the Murder of his Father) (who upon sight
or knouledge heerof do Immediately or upon the First Possible Convenience,
Abbandon those Rebels and Rise and Join themselves with ws and our Forces in
this present service) But also to assure all who are or will turn Loyal unto
him of that Nation; That it is his Majesty's Resolution (which He does Assure,
and Promise unto them, upon the word of a Prince (to be ever ready to Ratiefy
(so soon as it shall pleas God to put it in his Pouer, According to the advyce
of the Supreme Judicatories of that Kingdom) All what hes been done by his
Royal Father in Order to their Peace; Desyring nothing More, but Their
dutyfull Obedience, and Faithful Services, for the Rewenge of the Horrid
Murder of his Father, His Just Reestablishment, and their oun Perpetual
Happienes, under his Government.

Wherefore, All who have any Duty left them, to God, their King, Country,
Friends, Homes, Wyves, and Childreen, Or Would chang (now at Last) the Tyrrany,
Violence, and Oppression, of Those Rebels, With the Myild and Innocent
Government, of their Just Prince; Or Revveng, the Horrid, and Execrable Murder
of Their Sacred King, Redeem their Nation from Infamy; themselves from
Slavvery, Restore the Present, and Obliedge the Ages to come; Let Them, as
Christians, Subjects, Patriots, Friends, Husbands, and Fathers, Join
themselves Furthvvith with ws, In this Present service, that is so full, of
Conscience, Duty, Honor, and all Just Interrests, And not apprehend any
Evils, (which they may fear Can befall) Half so much, as Those they Presently
lie under, For tho there may appear many Dificulties, Yet let them not Doubt of
Gods Justice, Nor the Happy Providence that may attend his Majesty, Nor their
oun Resolutions, Nor the Fortuns of Those, who they are Joynd withal; Resolving
with Joab; to play the Men for their People and the Cittyes of their God, And
let the Lord do whatever seems him Good; Wherein, whatsum ever shall behappin,
They may (at least) be assured, of Crastinus Recompense, That Dead, or Allyue,
the World will give Them Thanks.

MONTROSE.
