bringing over of Soldiers, Money, Ordnance, and other Ammunition from beyond

WHereas the Lords and Commons now Assembled in Parliament, do find by
continual experience, That very great quantities of Ordnance, Arms, and other
Warlike Ammunition, and many Commanders and Soldiers have bin brought into
Newcastle, and other parts of this Kingdom from foreign parts, and especially

the United Provinces to that effect) to be employed against the Parliament, and
their Adherents, the well-affected persons of this Realm,

And whereas diverse of his Majesty's well-affected Subjects out of their Loyal
respect to His Majesty, their pious disposition to the peace and happiness of
this Kingdom, and as much as in them lies to prevent and hinder all such
supplies as shall be sent from any foreign parts, to the prejudice of this
Nation, have lately made known to the said Lords and Commons their voluntary
disposition and readiness to set forth some Ships and Pinnaces warlikely
appointed, equipped, manned, and victualled, at their own proper cost and
charges, so that in recompense of their charge and adventure therein, they may
have and enjoy to their own uses al such Ships, Munition, Goods, Moneys, and
Merchandises which they shall take and surprise by Sea or by Land, intended or
designed against the Parliament and their Adherents, the well-affected perfons
of this Kingdom, as aforesaid, or that have carried, or they shall take
carrying any the said supplies to the intents aforesaid, Which being well
approved by the Lords and Commons in Parliament as a good and acceptable
service, they do commend the same for a pious and laudable undertaking, and
are willing to give it all the encouragement and advancement that may be, to
bring it to a good and successeful issue, as tending very much to the honor of
the King, and the welfare of this Nation; And therefore for the better enabling
the performance of this so free and commendable undertaking and enterprise, It
is Ordered, established, and Ordained by the Lords and Commons Assembled in
this present Parliament, and by the authority of the same; That it shall and
may be lawful for any of his Majesty's good and loyal Subjects of this
Kingdom of England (to be approved and thereto appointed by the Commissioners of
the Admiralty established by the Parliament) in warlike manner to equippe and
furnish for the said intended employment, such and so many Ships and other
Vessels as they shall think fitting, and to place in them competent numbers of
Soldiers, Mariners, and Gunners, with necessary Arms and Provisions for that
service, and to appoint over them such Commanders, Captains, and Officers as
they shall think fit; and the same Ships and Vessels so manned, equipped,
armed, and provided to set forth to the Sea, and with the same to seize,
surprise, and take all, and all manner of Ships and Vessels with the Ordnance,
Ammunition, Goods, Commanders, and Soldiers therein, that they shall find or
understand are sent, or are come to any parts of this Kingdom, to the
prejudice thereof, as aforesaid; and further to surprise and take all and all
manner of Pirates and Sea-rovers of what Nation soever, and their Ships and
goods whatsoever; And for the better encouragement of all such Adventurers in
the said enterprise, It is by the Lords and Commons likewise Ordered and
Ordained, That the said adventurers shall have and enjoy as their proper goods,
all Ships, Goods, Moneys, Plate, Arms, Ammunition, Victuals, Pillage and
Spoil which shall be seized, or taken by any persons by them to be employed by
force and virtue of this Ordinance, which by definitive sentence to be given in
his Majesty's high Court of his Admiralty, shall be pronounced at the time of
the taking or seizing thereof, to have bin sent, designed, or intended to come
into this Kingdom against the Parliament, and all welaffected persons their
Adherents in this Nation, or to have belonged to any Pirates or Sea-Rovers
whatsoever: and the same to have and enjoy to their own use, without any
account whatsoever thereof to be made; Only reserving the Tenths accustomed in
such cases to be paid to the Admiral. And it is further Ordered and Ordained,
That there shall be true and faithful Inventories taken of the Ships,
Ammunition, Moneys, Goods, Plate, Pillage and Spoil which shall be taken by
virtue and authority of this present Ordinance, and a true Appraysement made of

examined before the chief Officer of the next Port of England, and the said
Examinations with the said Papers, Inventories, and Appraisements, shall be

or Creek, to meet with any Ship or Ships that shall not willingly yield
themselves to be visited, and proved by Law and Justice, but will defend
themselves by force and violence, then they shall by all means possible, and
with all force compel them to yield, and submit themselves to reason and
Justice; although it do fall out, that by fighting with them one or more be
maimed, hurt, or slain in the resistance.

And it is further Ordered and Ordained, That the Owners, Captains, Masters,
and two or three other of the principal Officers of every of the Ships and
Pinnaces, so to be set forth upon the said enterprise, shall before their going
to Sea, enter into a Bond in the High Court of Admiraltie, in the sum of two
thousand pounds, to the use of the Kings Majesty; That the said Ships or

of the same Ships as is before declared, returned into the Registry of the High
Court of Admiraltie aforesaid.

And lastly, it is hereby further Ordered and Ordained, That this Ordinance nor
any benefit thereby, shall extend to the setters forth of any Ship or other
Vessel, upon the enterprise aforesaid, where Bonds shall not be given as is
before expressed, and a Certificate under the Admiraltie Seal, obtained of the
putting in of such caution.

Ordered by the Lords and Commons assembled in Parliament, that this Ordinance
shall be Printed and published.

A Declaration of the Lords and Commons Assembled in Parliament, For the
speedy setting forth of a Fleet of Ships to Sea for the defense of the
KINGDOM.
THe Lords and Commons in Parliament Assembled, foreseeing the great
Inconveniences, Distractions, and Troubles, that must of necessity befall
these Kingdoms, by the approaching of Foreign Forces, now in preparation
against the well-affected Subjects of both Kingdoms, and that the woeful
effects thereof do begin to appear by the narrow Seas being already
infested, not only by Sea-Rovers, by Commissions from the Rebels in Ireland,
but also by Pirates of our own Nation, lately come forth of Falmouth in English
Bottomes, to destroy their own Countrymen, and in all probability to join
with our Foreign Enemies, and so hinder all the good endeavors of the
Parliament for relief of distressed Ireland, and intercept all Trade and
Commerce in these Seas.

Wherefore the Lords and Commons, for the prevention of these great Mischiefs,
do once more Declare and Ordain, that the Fleet now in preparation to go
forth, and all things thereunto conducing, may hasten to Sea with all possible
expedition; And that the for better encouragement of the Officers and Seamen,
who shall be employed in the said Fleet, there shall be allowed unto those in
the Kings Ships, besides their pay, one full third part of all Prizes that they
shall take in this their employment, the other two thirds to be reserved to the
State; and to those in the Merchants Ships, one full third part for the
Officers and Seamen, and another third part to the Owners, in respect of their
hazarding their Ships, and the other third part reserved to the State as
aforesaid, which divisions are to be according to the custom of men of War.

Ordered by the Lords and Commons Assembled in Parliament, That this
Declaration be Printed and published.

John Brown Cler. Parliament.

FINIS.
