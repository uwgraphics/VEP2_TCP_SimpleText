News from York. WITH HIS MAJESTY'S PROPOSITIONS TO THE LORDS THERE.
SIR,
I Conceive my Lord of Lindsey is Admiral of England, and the Lord of Ormond
Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. The King has this day made diverse Propositions to
the Lords here; As, First, to have the declaration of both Houses of the 19. of
May to be disavowed, Secondly to have Justice in Hull business.

Thirdly, to have the Militia declared to be his right.

Fourthly, to have tumults punished.

Fifthly, To have the Parliament adjourned to Oxford, Cambridge, Winchester,
York, Coventry, Bristoll, Nottingham, or any of those places where his Majesty
shall command, and other things which I have not leisure to add.

To morrow they meet again, and I believe the maine question will be,
whether a Declaration shall be made here, or the Lords to agree here, and vote
in the house, and in what equipage to go. Our Court increases daily, and we
believe, notwithstanding the offer of an hundred thousand pound, by the Common
Council, that the King may have as much money from the Citizens as they, and I
believe here is ground for such a conceit. Here is no possibility for the Kings
sudden remove hence, though some think he may step hence to Lincoln, for 3.
or 4. days, to settle that Country, but I am not of that opinion.

Printed for Hugh Perry, 1642.
