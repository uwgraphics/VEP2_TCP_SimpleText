TO ALL THE People of the LORD, Gathered or Scattered.
IN the fear of God, and love to his Truth, and People, do I declare, in the
Spirit of Meekness, what has long oppressed my Soul, concerning those Unclean
Spirits gone out from the Unity of the Truth and Light, by which we have been
called and gathered into one Christ Jesus, the Head over all his blessed for
ever: Whose Name has been greatly dishonored by many wild Actings, and his
Innocent Spirit grieved, and many simple Souls deceived, many oppressed, and
many offended against the Truth; for which work my Soul has been much
troubled: Who to this day raven about from place to place amongst the People of
God, seeking to enter where they can, so to strengthen themselves into parties,
to trouble such as they cannot enter, seeking to spoil the pleasant Pasture of
the Lambs, that they should not feed in Peace; and for that end, haunt after
the meetings of the People of God. All which Practices and pretenses, I deny in
my Soul, and the Spirit that acts therein.

And the more it lies upon me, from the Lord to warn the simple innocent ones
of his thereof openly, in that through me these Spirits have got much head and
entrance into the minds of some who were simple toward Gods Truth: And this
the Envious One has done, in the Night of my trial, and hour of Darkness and
Temptation, taking advantage of my sufferings, in the day when my Judgment was
taken away, and led captive under the power of Darkness, which all along has
sought my life, had not the Father held, and with his hand upon me, stayed me
in those great Temptations, to whom alone I give the glory of my Deliverance
from that great destruction, as his promise was to me before I came into that
trial, who also has brought me up again, and has given me to see those Evil
Spirits; and that the work of the Murderer and Devourer is therein, against
the life of God in his Temple: Which, though they seek entrance under pretense
of Humility, promising some great things, and more holiness in that way, to
steal into simple minds, yet being got in, exalts himself above the Seed of
God, and tramples the meek Spirit under foot, and so darkens the Vessels, and
being exalted in the openings of the Imaginations, leads the Creature as God
above that of God, and so against that of God, he wars in others, where God
is above.

And this mystery of deep in quity has the Lord God in the spirit of the Lamb
revealed unto me, whose powerful working I have felt, working in me above the
pure measure and unspotted life of God. And also in the simplicity of Jesus
Christ, I had given up my body all along a Free Offering to the will of God in
Life or Death, for the Seeds sake yet ungathered in the World (as God knows I
lie not) yet could I often feel that Exalted One above, secretly tempting to
envy against the people of God already gathered, pretending another thing to
come some other way. But this was ever judged the life of God also. I was often
buffered therewith, sometimes so strongly as to force words from me above the
meek and lowly principle, all which words were soon judged with the sufferer
which lay under, and with his life be they condemned for ever, and this lies
upon me to declare openly, which God has revealed unto me, for the sake of the
simple ones, who may be deceived therewith, but would not did they know his
subtilty.

And by this you shall all perceive that Spirit, whatever it pretends, it will
secretly withdraw your entire love from the Flock of God, already gathered, and
cool your affections and zeal toward their present meetings, and if you judge
it not there, it will grow on with an evil eye, to spy out for their
failings, and to delight to hear of them with an hidden joy, whispering them to
others, and adding thereunto, with a desire to see them broken, and their
nakednss laid open, if any thing be amiss.

And thus it has wrought in a mystery of wickedness in some unjudged, until
it be seated in the Throne of open enmity and strife against the Lambs of
Light, preferring the society of the profane before them, and taking part
therewith against them, joining to any who seek to scatter them.

And whatever pretense this Spirit covers it self with, this I declare against
it, having been kept by the good hand of God, to see it revealed in its ground
and end, that it is the old spirit of the Ranters, which now in a new way make
head against the Light of Christ and life of the Cross, which is the only thing
which stands in its way, by condemning its filthiness in every Conscience.

And so they, in whom this is entered, being exalted above the living Witness
in themselves, would devour it in others, and this in the presence and fear of
God I declare, without the least prejudice against any man or woman, but in
obedience to God, and for his Seeds sake, lest any more of the simple should be
deceived, and that such as are deceived already may recover themselves out of
Satan's snares, having no selfish end therein, God knows.

And long time has my soul travailed, ere I could obtain power herein (so
strongly has he that lets withstood my way) and therefore in the bowels of
tender love I warn you all, to take heed how ever you come under that Spirit
under what pretense soever, but let the fear of God and sound judgment in the
spirit of meekness preserve you all above it, for wheresoever it enters by
consent, it is hard to be got out again, and if it be, it is not without much
sorrow. And this I have found in the depth, which for your sakes I declare in
plainness and in truth, as I have learned of the Lord, laboring with him
without ceasing, that the rest of the people of God every where may be saved
from this Devourer, who daily goes about to deceive, and whosoever he takes he
casts into the earth and into the sea; for wichednesse is with him
wheresoever he goes.

Even the Lord God almighty arm you all against his wiles, being warned thereof
in his love, and the eternal power of Holiness preserve you all clean to
himsef, who are dearer to me then ever, and that in no other thing but that
innocent Principle in which you were kept free from all the pollutions of the
world, and fleshly liberty, and do stand Witnesses for God against it before
all men, and in no other thing have I fellowship with any, which is that I seek
to set up above all.

And this I was moved to give forth, to go every where a witness against that
unclean spirit wherever it goes, feeling its work is to run to and fro to
deceive, and that all may be warned by what I have learned in Suffering; and
that they that will not may be left without excuse.

James Nailor.
