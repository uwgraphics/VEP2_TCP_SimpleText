LONDON, Printed by M. O. for H. S. June, 24. 1644.

A LETTER from an Eminent Personage at the Leagure before York, dated there
the 16. of June. 1644.
UPon Friday morning early the Marquess New Castle wrote to our Generals
offering a Parley to begin that afternoon at three a clock, and to continue
till eight at night, and a cessation of Arms for three hours before, and
three hours after to be held in Tent without the Walls, betwixt our Fort and
theirs; with a ^i^a^ion of Guards, to such number and distance as should be ^se
and necessary: he named for Commissioners only to treat ^or himself. The
Lord Widrington, Sir Thomas Glemham, Sir ^ichard Hutton, Sir William Wentworth,
Sir Robert Strickland, ^ir Thomas Mesham, and Master Robert Rockley: Our
Generals accepted the offer in all points, and sent for them; the Earl of
^indsey, the Lord Humby, Lieutenant General Baylie, Sir William Fairefax
Colonel Hamond, Colonel Russell, and Colonel White: These fourteen met on
Friday last, and the enemy propounded to our men certain Articles which they
brought in ^n writing, but would not suffer our Commissioners to read nor other
copy them. The Heads of them were such as appear in t^^ other P^p^r therewith
sent. Our Commissioners propound to them also certain conditions, the true
Copy whereof I se^ here also, offering a Copy to the enemies to carry into
York, be considered of, and after to return Answer. The enemies Commissioners
would not accept the Paper, but scornfully and prou^ly said, They were below
their condition, and much other pro^^ language, which I c^nno^ now write: so
the Commissioners p^^ted. But when General Lesley heard that the adversaries
Commisioners refused to take the Paper containing the Conditions; h^ presently
closed the Paper in a Letter to the Marquess Now casile, and sent it by a
Drum: Unto which Letter and Pr^posi^ons the Marq New castle yesterday
afternoon returned an Answer to this effect following. That our Generals
pretending a desire to prevent the effusion of blood, had framed and rendered t^
him such Conditions as neither he nor any man of Hono^ with him could
condescend unto any one of them: yet he would still be teady to deliver up the
Town upon such term as he had offered him by his Commissioners the day before
So you see the business is now plainly left to be decided by the Sword, of
which the common Soldiers on out Party are nothing sorry: The last night the
enemy made fires on the to^ of the Minster, and Cliffords Tower, and were
answered b^ the like from Pomfret Castle, which is a signal of succors
coming toward them: but I see no likelihood of any: for yesterday and and
this day also, we have Letters from Manchester that Prince Rupert has on
Sa^urday and Friday las^ sent part of his Army and Ordnance over the River
Mers^^ into Cheshire, and has lost one of his greatest Pieces in the passage
of the Water: Some conjecture he intends to besiege ^arrington: others think
he goes to succor the King: If he ^omes this way, our Armies are ready to
encounter him.

After I had concluded this letter, word was brought me that ^he Earl of
Manchesters men never acquainting our other Forces ^ith their intention, sptung
a mine this afternoon, which d^d ^ood execution, making a large breach in the
walls into the man^^u^, by which those forces entered and possessed themselves of
^he Manor, the enemies guards laying down their arms: But ^he enemy drawing
all their forces that way, beat out our men gain, with the loss of 200. of
our partee, and the other armies ^ould not come to their succor, having no
notice of it.

The heads of their Propositions, as I heard them reported by our
Commissiioners at their return, made by the Marqesse of Newcastles
Commissioners, touching the Rendition of York, June 14, 1644.
First, That himself, with all the Commanders and soldiers, should march away
to the King with all their Ordnance, Arms, ammu^ition, money, plate, bag and
baggage, drums beating, colors fly^ng, matches lighted, etc.

2. That the Parliaments forces should furnish them with victuals, ^arriages,
and convoy through their Quarters, they marching one^^ eight miles a day.

3. That the Citizens and others in York should not be questi^^^d for pass^d

5. That the Churches and all belonging to them should be preserved from
violence or defacing, and that the books of Common Prayer should be allowed to
be used in them.

6. That before their forces march out or render the Town, th^^ should be
allowed 20. days liberty to expect forces from the King (...) prince Ru^e^t,
and if any came in the mean time, then they not (...) be tied to render the

T^is I conceive was the substance, but I have them only b^ memory, which is
apt to fail.

Propositions sent from the three Generals for the Parliament to the Treaty,
June 14. 1644.

their Persons, goods, and Houses protected ^^om violence, and shall have the
same free Trade and Comerce ^s others under obedience of the King and
Parliament, and that ^o Regiments or Companies shall be admitted or quartered
in ^he Town of York, except those that are appointed for the Garrison thereof.

3. That the Officers of all qualities shall have liberty to go to their own

case they shall not be then ^^^ted, we shall not then hold our selves bound to
them; and in (...) mean time we declare that there is no Cessation after 3.
ho^^^ already granted.
