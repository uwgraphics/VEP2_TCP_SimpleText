DIE SEPTEMBER 29. 1642.
THe Lords and Commons in Parliament do conceive and find it so necessary that
1000. Dragoones, with some Troops of Horse should be raised speedily, and be
set forth for the suppressing of the Malignant Party in Lancashire, and such
other parts, as my Lord General shall oppoint for protecting the well affected
people, and preventing offorreigne Power from landing, that it will not only
be taken and recented by the House for an acceptable Service in a time of great
need, if any the well affected and disposed persons of the City of London shall
advance the sum of sixteen thousand pounds, for setting forth of such a
Power. But do declare, that such Advancers shall have the public faith for
the repayment of such moneys so to be advanced with Intrest after eight pound
per cent. As also shall be taken into consideration by the House, for a further
recompense of their so forward and pious Act in a time of so great necessity
and danger.

It is ordered by the House, that Sir John Wolleston, John Rowse, John Warner,
and Tho. Andrews, Aldermen of the City of London, are appointed Treasurers for
the foresaid Subscription Moneys.

All persons who are willing to go Soldiers in the Service under Colonel Sir
John Seton as Dragoniers, are to resort to Captain Henry Legh at the sign of
the Sun near Criplegate and Captain William Stackhouse at his house in Saint
Thomas Apostles, and there are to be listed for that Service.

Ordered by the House of Commins that this be forthwith printed and puplished.
