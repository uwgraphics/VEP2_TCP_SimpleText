LONDON, Printed for Henry Hutton. Oct. 7. 1642.

A Covenant for RELIGION, KING, and COUNTRY, made by a new Ordinance of
Counsel at the desire of the general assembly of SCOTLAND.
WEall, and every one of us underwritten, protest that after long and due
examination of our own consciences in matters of true, and false religion, are
now thoroughly resolved of the truth by the word and Spirit of God; and
therefore we believe with our hearts, confess with our mouths, subcribe with
our hands, and constantly affirm before God, and the whole world: that this
only is the true Christian Faith, and Religion, pleasing God, and bringing
salvation to man, which now is by the mercy of God revealed to the world by the
preaching of the blessed Evangel: And received, believed, and defended by many
and sundry notable Kirks and Realms; but chiefly by the Kirk of Scotland, the
Kings Majesty, and our Estates of this Realm, as Gods eternal truth and only
ground of our salvation; as more particularly is expressed in the Confession of
our faithstablished and confirmed by many Acts of Parliaments, and now of a
long time has been openly professed by the Kings Majesty, and whole body of
his Realm, both in Burgh and Land. To the which Confession and form of
religion we willingly agree in our consciences in all points as unto Gods
undoubted truth and verity, grounded only upon his written word: and therefore
we abhor and detest all contrary religion and doctrine: but chiefly all
kind of Papistry, in general and particular heads, even as they are now
damned and confuted by the word of God, and Kirk of Scotland: but in especial,
we detest and refuse the usurped authority of that Roman Antichrist upon the
Scriptures of God upon the Kirk, the civil Magistrate, and consciences of men,
all his tyrannous laws made upon indifferent things against our Christian
liberty; his erroneous doctrine against the sufficiency of the written word,
and the perfection of the Law, the office of Christ and his blessed Evangel.
His corrupted doctrine concerning original sin, our natural inability and
rebellion to Gods law, our justification by faith only, our imperfect
sanctification and obedience to the Law, the nature, number, and use of the
holy Sacraments. His five bastard Sacraments, with all his rites, ceremonies,
and false doctrine added to the ministration of the true Sacraments, without
the word of God. His cruel judgment against infants departing without the
Sacrament, his absolute necessity of Baptism, his blasphemous opinion of
Transubstantiation, or real presence of Christ's body in the elements, and
receiving of the same by the wicked or bodies of men; his dispensations with
solemn Oaths, periuries, and degrees of marriage forbidden in the word, his
cruelty against the innocent divorced, his devilish Mass, his blasphemous
priesthood, his profane Sacrifices for the sins of the dead and the quick,
his Canonization of men calling upon Angels or Saints departed, worshipping of
imagerie relics, and crosses, dedicating of kirkes, Alters, days, vows to
creatures, his purgatory, prayers for the dead, praying or speaking in a
strange language, with his processions, and blasphemons lettany, and multitude
of advocates or mediators, his manifold orders, auricular confession, his
desperate and uncertain repentance, his general, and doubtsome faith, his
satisfaction of men for their sins, his justification by works, opus operatum,
works of supererogation, merits, pardons, peregrinations and stations, his holy
water, baptizing of bells, conjuring of saints, crossing, fanning, anointing,
coniuring, hallowing of Gods good creatures with the superstitous opinion,
joined there with his wordly Monarchy, and wicked Hierarcy, his three solemn
vows, with all his shavelings of sundry sorts, his erroneous and bloody
decrees made at Trent, with all the subscribers, and approvers of that cruel
and bloody and band conjured against the Kirk of God; and finally we detest all
vain allegories, rites, signs, and traditions, brought in the Kirk, without or
against the word of God, and doctrine of this true reformed Kirk; to the which
we join our selves willingly in doctrine, faith, religion, discipline, and use
of the Holy Sacraments, as lively members of the same in Christ our Head,
prominsig and swering by the name of God our Lord, That we shall continue in
the obedience of the doctrine and discipline of this Kirk, and shall defend
the same according to our vocation, all the days of our lives, under the
pains contained in the law, and danger both of body and soul in the day of
Gods fearful Judgments. And seeing that many are stirred up by Satan, and
that Roman Antichrist to promise, swear, subscribe, and for a time use the
holy Sacraments in the Kirk, deceitful against their own consciences, minding
thereby first under the External cloak of religion, to corrupt and subvert
secretly Gods true religion, within the Kirk; and afterward when time may serve
to become open enemies and persecutors of the same, under vain hope of the
Popes dispensation, devised against the word of God to his greater confusion,
and their double condemnation in the day of the Lord Jesus Christ.

We therefore willing to take away all suspicion of hypocrisy, and of such
double dealing with God and his Kirk, protest, and call the searcher of hearts
for witness, that our minds and hearts do fully agree with this our
Confession, Promise, Oath, and Subscription; so that we are not moved for any
worldly respects, but are persuaded only in our consciences through the
knowledge and love of Gods true Religion printed in our hearts by the holy
Spirit, as we shall answer to him, in the day when the secrets of all hearts
shall be disclosed: and because we perceive that the quietness and stability
of our Religion and Kirk does depend upon the safety and good behavior of the
Kings Majesty, as upon a comfortable instrument of Gods mercy granted to this
Country, for the maintaining of his Kirk, and ministration of justice amongst
us; we protest and promise with our hearts under the same oath, hand, writ,
and pains, that we shall defend his royal person and authority, with our
goods, bodies and lives, in the defense of Christ his Evangel, Liberties of our
country, ministration of justice, and punishment of iniquity, against all
enemies within this Realm or without, as we desire our God to be be a strong
and merciful defender to us in the day of our death, and coming of our Lord
Jesus Christ, to whom with the Father and the holy Spirit be all honor and
glory eternally.

A Worthy Speech spoken to the Kings most Excellent Majesty by the Recorder of
Hereford.
MOst gracious Sovereign, according to our Allegiance we are here assembled
to entertain your Majesty, and to give that welcome which shall become us your
distressed Subjects, yet loyal liege-people.

We with all joy acknowledge, that the Sun never appeared more welcome to the
half starved traveller, benumbed with the cold moisture of a hory morn, where
the white dew like to congealed Pearl hangs on his hair, (by which he dos
appear almost a frozen Statue,) then now your gracious presence is to us,
almost despayring, frozen up with fear, with visible appearances of danger,
death, and destruction, rapine, and thousands more calamities, such, as will
bring terror in the mere relation.

O my dread Sovereign, let but your Servant put into your mind the dire
effects of War, when flourishing Cities shall be turned to dust, nay this yet
flourishing Kingdom shall become it is own destroyer, buried in the tomb of
blood and slaughter, when our young infants shall be rudely torn from the sad
mothers, breast whose shrieks and cries serve as sad music to the sacrifice,
when our young virgins and our wives shall be subject to bloody cruelty, when
death shall triumph, and the friends of Rome, (whose only aims are to destroy
the Laws, religion of the Kingdom, nay the King too, if not prevented) your
self most gracious Sov^raigne must suffer with your Subjects, if their
hell-bred designs should ever take effect, therefore great King, now while you
may, return, and join in peace with those, who like to teeming mothers long
for your wished presence, or like to loving children, who finding the want of
an indulgent parent, with an excessive sorrow mournes his absence, even so your
Council with an industrious care and loyal sorrow mourn for your sacred
self, because your splendant favor has been kept so long from shining on
them, their actions like to flowers in a dry summer, want the dew of your high
favor, which should make them flourish with natural sweetness, wherefore
they are enforced to use sOme art to bring them to a growth, and make them
useful for the general good, bu would you deigne to cast one splendant beam
on their endeavors, and to lend a hand to raise their drooping hopes, then
peace should flourish: those that seek for war, should fall into that pit
themselves have dug: O then Dread sovereign abandon straight those Achans
of the Land, let not atscintion or domestique strife revell within this
Kingdame, but let peace, a bleffed religious peace be straight embraced, so
shall your Crown and Throne endure for ever, and joy shall circumvent you, your
Subjects fear shall cease, and you shall see, let Law have power who is an
enemy to Englands peace, and what they are that strive to ruin England could
their Plots but thrive. I fear I have displeased (if not your Majesty, yet
some of your retinue) which if I have, I must conclude that they are guilty of
what I mention, for otherwise what need they seem offended at that which they
are free of? As touching what Your Majesty shall command, we are ready to obey,
so far as Law, or Religion will give way; but if any command shall happen
contrary, our lives and fortunes shall be exposed to the most eminent danger,
in opposition of any such command. Thus trusting in Your Majesty's Royal
disposition, we rest, (according to our bounden duty) Your Majesty's loyal and
obedient Subjects, in which we are resolved to live and die.

FINIS.
