THE ENGLISH IRISH SOVLDIER With his new Discipline, new Arms, Old Stomach,
and new taken pillage: who had rather Eat than Fight.
IF any Souldate
think I do appear,
In this strange Arms
and posture, as a jeere,
Let him advance up to me
he shall see,
I Will stop his mouth,
and we will both agree.
Our Skirmish ended,
our Enemies fled or slain
Pillage we cry then,
for the Soldiers gain,
And this complete Artillery
I have got,
The best of Soldiers,
I think, hates not.
My Martial Arms
dealt I amongst my foes,
With* this I charged stand
against hungers blows;
This is Munition
if a Soldier lack,
He fights like John a dreams,
or Lents thin Jacke.
All safe and clear,
my true Arms rest a while,
And welcome pillage,
you have foes to foil;
This Pot, my Helmet,
must not be forsaken,
For lo I seized it
full of Hens and Bacon.
Rebels for Rebels dressed it,
but our hot roast,
Made them to fly,
and now they kiss the post
And better that to kiss,
then stay for Pullits,
And have their bellies
crammed with leaden bullets.
This foul my Feather is,
who wins most fame,
To wear a pretty Duck,
he need not shame:
This Spit my well charged
Musket, with a Goose,
Now cries come eat me,
let your stomachs loose.


This Dripping pan's my
target, and this Hartichoke
My Basket-hilted blade,
can make 'em smoke,
And make them slash and cut,
who most Home puts,
I Will most my fury
sheath into his guts.
This Forke my Rest is,
and my Bandaleers
Canary Bottles,
that can quell base fears,
And make us quaffe down
danger, if this not do,
What is it then? can raise
a spirit into fearful men.
This Match are linkes
to light down to my belly
Wherein are darksom chinks
as I may tell ye,
Or Sassages, or Puddings,
choose you which,
An excellent Needle,
Hungers wounds to stitch.
These my Supporters,
garter'd with black pots,
Can steel the nose,
and purg the brain of plots;
These tosts my shooestrings,
steept in this strong fog,
Is abl^ of themselves
to fox a Dog.
These Arms being vanished,
once again appear
A true and faithful Soldier
As you were;
But if this wants,
and that we have no biting
In our best Armours
we make sorry fighting.
FINIS.
