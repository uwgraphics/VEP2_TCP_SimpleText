FOrasmuch as notwithstanding diverse good Acts and Ordinances of Parliament
London sc.
made for the better observation of the Lord's Day, days of Public
Humiliation, and Thanksgiving; and the many endeavors used for the due
execution thereof: It is observed that the Lords day is very much profaned,
and the observation thereof, and others the days aforesaid, are very much
neglected within this City and the Liberties thereof, by Vintners, Inholders,
Ale-house-keepers, Butchers, Fruiterers, Cooks, Tobacco-sellers, Keepers of
Ordinaries, and such like, by suffering tippling and drinking in their houses;
and by them and others in Selling, and exposing to sale diverse Commodities, and
in unlawful Pastimes, and Traveling, and working upon the days aforesaid,
within this City and Liberties thereof, to the great dishonor of Almighty God,
scandal of Religion and the Government of this City: And whereas also several
persons do keep Hackney-Coaches, and Watermen by rowing upon the river of
Thames, do ordinarily exercise their Callings upon the days aforesaid; I have
therefore thought fit for the better discovering and suppressing of the
several Offenses aforesaid, and for the more exact execution of the several
Laws and Ordinances made for that purpose, to appoint, and do hereby
accordingly appoint the persons here-under named, Inhabitants within the said
City and Liberties, diligently and by all Lawful means to make discovery of
all persons offending contrary to the Laws and Ordinances aforesaid, to my Self
or any the Justices within the said City and Liberties, or to any Constable or
other officer who are authorized by the said Acts, or any of them, to apprehend
such Offenders: And for that end do also will and require, and in the name of
his Highness the Lord Protector of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland, and
Ireland, hereby straightly Charge and Command all such Constables and others,
Officers and Ministers, within the said City and Liberties thereof, to whom it
shall appertain, to be diligent in the execution of the Powers and Authorities
given them by the said Laws, or any of them, And also to be aiding and
assisting unto them the said persons hereunder particularly named, and every,
or any of them in the finding out, and causing to be apprehended, all and every
such person and persons, as shall offend in any of the kinds aforesaid, or
otherwise contrary to the Laws aforesaid, And them and every of them to bring
before me, or some other the Justices of the Peace, within this City and the
Liberties of the same, to the end that such offenders, and every of them, may
be further dealt withal as to Justice shall appertain: I do judge it to be
my Duty to use the utmost power that God and Men has betrusted me with, to
find out all Offenders in the premises, and to inflict on them the utmost
punishment that the Law requires for such offenses, and do desire all persons
entrusted herewith, to make Conscience of doing their utmost, to bring all
offenders herein to punishment, That so this City may not lie under the guilt
of this Crying sin; and such as are required by the Law upon a penalty to see
these Laws duly executed, must expect to suffer what ever the Law does lay on
them, if they shall be found negligent in their duties: And the Ministers of
every congregation, are hereby desired to be frequent in minding and exhorting
their People to use their Constant, and Vigorous endeavors, to prevent this
growing Evil, by bringing the Offenders to their due punishment, which is a
work that will doubtless be highly pleasing to God and all good men, and
greatly Honorable to our Religion and Government, which ought to be the desire
and endeavor of all that profess to own God, Jesus Christ and the Gospel:

Dated the (...) day of (...) 1656
And to all Constables and other Officers and Ministers of Justice within the
said City and Liberties thereof whom it shall concern.
