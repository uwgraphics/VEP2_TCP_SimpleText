Oct: 17 LONDON, Printed for A. N. 1643.

Another great Victory obtained by the Lord Fairfax his Forces against the
Popish Army near Hull.
NOw all men may see the grand effect and operation of the Covenant, thus it
was with Scotland, God carried on their Design without impediment, it was the
mere force of their Covenant which wrought it, and brought them on so
successefully, and ever since the first day of striking in and Confederating in
such a wonderful manenr, God has given us success; the victory at Newberry,
the relief of Gloucester, were even when we were considering and consulting,
and taking our Covenant, and now very lately upon the second solemnity of it by
the house of Lords, a Messenger came with the joyful tidings of the Earl of
Manchesters victory near Bullingbrooke.

And now one Captain Clayton, an Officer in the Lord Fairfax Army came hither
the 17 of October from Hull in Yorkshire at 3. of the clock, that place which
was formerly b^sieged with the Earl of Newcastle's Army, he having diverse
times shot into the Town hot flaming bullets which to the wonder and
astonishment of all never fell but on some Malignant house in the town, but now
the Newcastelian Forces lying still in their siege, and fancying to themselves
some unexpected success either by treachery within, or by their constant lying
before it, hoping at length to work some terror in the Inhabitants, and to
bring them into straits, it pleased God to put into the hearts of the noble
Lord Fairfax, Sir John Meldrum, and the rest of the noble Council of War to
take into their thoughts and designs how to fall upon the enemy who lay before
the Town, they called a secret or Cabinet Counsel, and deliberated seriously
upon the business, and disputed the feaseablenesse of it, for there were many
difficulties in it; as first the adventuring any considerable party out of the
Town, and then the discouragements which might follow, if any loss or
defeature should happen, then the great Army and Forces which the Earl of
Newcastle had; and though they might sally out upon one Work, yet he might with
his numbers so supply the assailed, that it would prove a mighty hazard; these
things thus agitated, it pleased God to warm the spirits of our worthy
Commanders, the Lord Fairfax, Sir John Meldrum, and the rest, and to put new
resolutions into their hearts, and they resolved to sally forth; then order was
given to diverse Captains to make ready for drawing forth; and 800 were
appointed by the Lord General Fairfax, and they were only designed for this
great victory: They marched forth upon Wednesday last, being the very day on
which the Earl of Manchester, and Sir Tho Fairfax, Lord Willoughby, and
Colonel Cromwell obtained their famous victory upon the place near
Bullinbrooke, which is a very wonderful and observable Providence, for God did
seem to give us a complete victory in two several Counties at the same time,
the one being a victory over Horse, the other over Foot, so as now the whole
body of the popish Army is routed, having divided it self into two parts, viz.
Lincolnshire and Yorkshire, Newcastles Forces lying in their Trenches, and
having made several works one within another, in a very strong and
Artificial manner, our forces fell upon their main Quarter, beat them from one
Work into another, and so out of all the works of their Quarter, but the
Popish forces came one again and beat ours back again, and recovered their
works, then it pleased God to put new courage and resolutions into our men and
then they went on again drove them all out, killed 80 on the place took 100
prisoners, routed all the rest, took 9 great Pieces of Ordinance whereof one of
them was called her Majesty's Gog and Magog being their greatest Cannon,
shooting Bullets of 36 pound weight, these being taken thus, all his army run
away and they pursued and might have followed them to the gates of York, the
enemy was in that great astonishment, but the forces of my Lord Fairefax
contented themselves for the present with these, only this further, such was
the disorder and distraction of the enemies army upon this admirable difeate
the diverse of the newcastlians came into Hull to surrender themselves to the
Lord Fairfax mercy; now there are such sad ^amentings in the Popish army, that
they know not wh^t course to take, they are at their wits end, now they are
thinking it is verily supposed of providing for themselves; either by flight to
Newcastle and so to take shipping, or to Scarbrough and so to be gone for
Ireland.

Sir Hugh Cholmley is in great distraction and it is thought would come over
again to the Parliaments side, if he might be received; for he has had little
sound comfort and content since he revolted.

The quarters now which the Enemy had about Beverley, Cottingham, Newland,
Stoneferis, Stamfordbrigge, and other places are now left very empty, and they
are intending to gather all into a body, and to retreat to York but it is
thought by those that run away from the enemies side daily, that the design
will not hold, and that they will rather run all away and so desert the
Marquess of Newcastle and leave him with his naked title; who of all men that
ever took up Arms against the Parliament serves most to be hanged and have his
quarters hung, the one upon York minster the other upon Lincoln minster, and
the other upon Durham minster and the other upon Westminster, because he first
gave a rise to the Papists of this land.

And let all men take notice of that wicked and unfortunate Marquess, who has
been the only General for the Popish Army, giving them all the encouragement
he could, and being the greatest observer of the Queen, and her jesuiticall
faction, doing their Commands like a packhorse.

And now all men are desired to look upon our Cause, and not to faint, but to
raise up their spirits in the south, that we may now totally end the business,
and hasten our peace and happiness which must only be by victory over our enemy.

This is Licensed and entered according to order.

FINIS.
