THE Lords and Commons in this present Parliament assembled, having received
advertisement of extraordinary preparations, made by the neighboring Princes,
both by Land and Sea: the Intentions whereof have been so represented, as to
raise an apprehension in both Houses, that the public Honor, Peace, and
Safety of his Majesty, and his Kingdom cannot be secured, unless a timely
course be taken for the putting of this Kingdom into a condition of Defense,
at Sea as well as Land. It is therefore ordered by the Lords and Commons
aforesaid, that the Earl of Northumberland, Lord high Admiral of England, do
forthwith give effectual direction, and Order, that all and every the Ships
belonging to his Majesty's Navy, which are fit for service, and not already
abroad, nor designed for this Summers Fleet, be with all speed rigged and put
in such a readiness, as that they may be soon fitted for the Sea; and that
his Lordship do also make known unto all the Masters, and Owners of such
ships as now are in, or about any the Harbors of this Kingdom, and may be of
use for the public defense thereof, that it will be an acceptable service to
the King, and Parliament. If they likewise will cause their Ships to be rigged,
and so far put in readiness, as they may be at a short warning set forth to
Sea, upon any immergent occasion, which will be a means of great security to
his Majesty, and his Dominions.

IT is ordered, that the Masters of the Merchants Ships, shall be allowed after
the rate of ten shillings a month, to every one of his men for rigging of the
Ships, and 21. shillings a month for every one of his men when they are at
Sea, and to have one third part of the money in hand and another part at four
months end and the last payment at six months end, being the expiration of
the time, for which they are impressed, or when they come to Black-Wall. and to
have their Colors and Surgions, Chests furnished at the Kings charge, out of
the Kings Storehouse, and presse-mony allowed them, but if any Ship chance to
be cast away in the Kings service, they are to have no allowance, but the Kings
pay for six months.
