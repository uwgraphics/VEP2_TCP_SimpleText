THE INTERPRETER TO Him that READS.
I Have here to deal with three sorts of Persons; the Learned, the Ignorant,
the Scrupulous; and something must be said to them all.

To the Intelligent, and those who shall be apt to think, I have levelled too
great a part of Philosophy, such as was locked up for them only, to whom the
Keys of her profounder mysteries are due; I reply, that the five remaining
(...), or (as one may say) Sanctuaries of Nature, whose Closets and Recesses
have never yet been so much as violated in the least degree, may well justify
me from Sacrilege; especially, since my design has been herein no other, then
to make men admirers of the Rites of Philosophy, and in love with that
knowledge and work, without which (if we dare credit the most Learned) so small
a progress can be made in either.

Ad has autem utilitates, quae ex hoc politissimo Scriptore capiuntur
gravissimae, accedunt item aliae non minores. Hic enim videre licet quanta
elegantia and Art, Graeca Epicuri, aliorumque Philosoph. ac Poetarum decr^ta
and Sententias poeta Lat. verbis expressa reddiderit: adeo ut vel hic Liber
exemplo nobis esse possit, ad optimum interpretandi genus comparandum. Deinde
ad Cicer. Plutarchi, Diogenis, Virgil. aliorum Scripta commodius percipienda,
nimium quantum utibile est hoc opus and opportunum. At poetae quem veri^s
imitandum sibi proponant, quam quem ipse Poetarum Princeps Maro penitus
rimatus, diligentissime expressit, ut haud sciam mirarine superioris nostraeque
aeta^ is stultitiam, an miseriam deplorare de beam; cum plerosque repent
existere videam Poetas, qui Lucretium vix unquam legerint; Maronis lumina, quia
ab aliis and a majoribus pleraque sunt sumpta, minime intelligant, etc.

Thus far Gifanus in his Preface ad Sambucum, in pure commiseration of such as
neglected this ^uthor, without whose intimate acquaintance and special
cognizance, no man (he thought) was ever capable of becoming either good
Philosopher, or tolerable Poet. Peter Crinitus, lib. 23. cap. 7. de honesta
disciplina, reports the judgment which Marullus gives of the Latin Poets: I
will not ci^e him at large, but show you what he concludes, after particular
recital and censure of the rest. Itaque legendi quidem sunt omnes (says he)
sed ^i maxim probandi pro suo sunt quisque genere, Tibullus, Horatius, Catul
us and in Comoedia Terentius; Virgilium ver^ and LUCRETIUM ediscendos, Vide
Dan. Paraeum de T. Lu^r* admiratoribus, etc.
etc. Which that he might the better eternize to posterity, he thus elegantly
expresses,

Amor Tibullo, Mars tibi Maro debet,
Terentio Soccus Levis.
Cothurnus olim nemini, satis multum
Horatio Satyra and Celys.
Natura magni versibus LUCRETII
Lepore musaeo illitis.
Epigramma cultum test Rhallo ad huc nulli,
Docto Catullo Syllabe.
Nos si quis inter caeteros locat vates,
Onerat quam honorat veri^s.
And we thus interpret,

Love to Tibullus, Mars to Maro owes,
And the Light Sock to Terence bows;
To none the Buskin yet; Satyr and Lyre
Grave Horaee do thee most admire;
Nature to great LUCRETIUS numbers yields
Which with Musaean grace he gilds:
Cult Epigram to none yet Rhallo says;
Catullus claims Phalcucian Bays.
If any Us amongst the rest shall place,
He does Us burden more then grace.
Besides, when I shall have assured the world how difficult an attempt he
undertakes, who makes account to pursue the design; I am persuaded men will
rather take the pains to converse the Original, then stay till the rest be
translated into English; which yet might peradventure be sometime performed, if
the Learned Dr. Casaubon, doubting whether it be possible for any Traduction to
reach the excellency and Elegancy of the Or^ginal, did not pronounce it far
safer and better not to be meddled withal, then spoiled in the translation;
with whose opin^on I so concur, that had not this Essay been pre-ingaged
long before we were so happy as to see his learned Enthusiasms, I should
cheerfully rather have given check to this bold attempt (as in obedience to his
judgment, I shall to any farther) then exposed my reputation to the censure of
so grave and discerning a person. But however, I must now bewail my temerity. I
have yet been as industrious as I could to explain the Poets sense and meaning
in his own natural way; using very little Paraphrase, where I could possibly
contract him without impeachment of his Argument, or defacing of the Ornament:
so that if I have seldom exceeded the number of Verses, save where the Rhyme it
self obliges me sometimes to multiply Epithetes, and protract the line; I hope
I have neither made a disadvantageous bargain for our Language, nor in the
least violated the limits of an Interpreter, which are yet infinitely more
indulgent, and give a far greater latitude, as I could abundantly exemplify.
And if Lucretius himself made it such a difficulty to express those -- Graiorum
obscura reperta,
in Latin Verse: suppose I had now and then (as to my best notice I have no
where) wrested a syllable unjustly, or adopted an illegitimate word, I had yet
been no less excusable even by the verdict and indulgence of our Author*

Multa novis verbis, praesertim cum sit agendum
Propter egestatem Linguae, and rerum novitatem.
I have omitted no considerations which I thought might import the Author, or
improve the Version; nor were it at all the least dishonor in speculations thus
nice and abstracted, to consult with the most able; so that I ingenuously
confess with one of our Poets most industrious Illustrators, Si quando me
explicare satis comm^d? nescirem, Viros eruditos consulere non erubui.

There remain some yet whom I expect should look severely on the numbers of
this piece, and carp at the cadences of the verse, as we have been able to
adorn it but since I presume they will be found of no other then of that second
degree of persons with whom I have to deal, and such as have little
acquaintance with the Original, nor ever so much as once assayed what it was to
tamper with Lucretius, I shall be the less solicitous, especially since our
Author himself has left them so apposite and full a character,

Omnia enim stolidi magis admirantur amantque
Inversis quae sub verbis latitantia cernunt*
Veraque constituuut quae belle tangere possunt
Aures, and lepido quae sunt fucata sonore.
For we know with Tasso, an extreme Admirer of our Carus,

-- Che la corre il mondo, ove p^u versi
Di sue Dolcezze il lusinghier Parnasso: Ca^t. 1. Stro. 3. Gerus. lib.

E che'l vero condito, in molli versi,
I piu Schivi allettando ha persuaso.
Thither the vulgar run where they may meet
Parnassus Lure in numbers that are sweet,
And truth in gentle measures so conveyed,
Has often the most illiterate betrayed*
Nor will it concern Lucretius, though he be not suddenly understood of all.
For if Memmius himself, a person of so profound a judgment and excellent
parts, needed to be so often reminded seriously to weigh and ponder the subject
matter; as you will find in many places of our Poem he is; how highly requ^site
will it be, that even our most confident Reader diligently intend to what is
here faithfully presented; whilst in the mean time to the rest of the more
unsettled spirits that yet delight in books, I may safely affirm what our
illustrious Verulam has somewhere pronounced of the study of the
Mathematiques* Aug. Scient. l. 2.
they will find this work an excellent specifique, and rare ingredient for
unstayed and Bird-witted men; since that here, as there, if the mind be not
seriously fixed, the Demonstration is ever to begin.

But to render a perfect and lively Image of this excellent piece, and speak of
its colors in the Original, cannot be better accomplished, then in the
resembling it to the surprising artifice of some various Scene, curious
Landscape, or delicious prospect; where sometimes from the cragginess of
inaccessible Rocks, uneven and horrid precipices (such as are to be found,
respecting those admirable plains of Lombardy) there breaks and divides (as the
Wandering Traveller approaches) a passage to his eyes down into some goodly and
luxurious valley; where the trembling serpenting of some Crystal rivolet,
frngied with the curtous diaper of the softer meadows, the umbrage and
harmonious warbling of the cooler groves, the frisking and lowing of the
wandering cattle, the exuberant festoons of a bountiful Autumn, the smiling
crops of a hopeful harvest, and all the youth and pride of a teeming and
cheerful Spring, conspire to create a new Paradise, and recompense him the
pains of so many difficult accesses. For our Poet seems here to have been of
counsel with Nature herself, when she disposed the Principles of things (to
speak in the dialect of those times) and framed that beautiful Machine, which
we daily contemplate with so much variety and admiration.

In this Piece it is She sits triumphant, wanting none of her just Equipage and
Attendance; whilst our Carus has erected this everlasting Arch to her memory,
so full of Ornament and exquisite Workmanship, as nothing of this kind has
ever or approached, or exceeded it.

Where the matter he takes in hand is capable of form and luster, he makes it
even to ou^-shine the Sun it self in splendour: and as he spares no cost to deck
and set it forth; so never had man a more rich and luxurious fancy, more keen
and sagacious Instruments to square the most stubborn and rude of materials,
into that spiring softness you will every where find them disposed, in this
his stupendous and wel-built Theater of Nature.

I do here purposely omit to speak of the Authors life, as reserving it to
adorn a more entire Volume by whomsoever perfected; only for his studies and
genius, his affection to the Greek Poets is perspicuous; as having from them
and the Garden of Epicurus, culled the greatest part of his profound knowledge*
for which very regard he is observed to have much affected Empedocles (using in
some encounters even his very expressions) who before his time had (it seems)
treated on the same subject, (...).
and particular Argument; so that what Aristotle attributes to that
Philosopher, (...), etc. for his being so grave and Homer-like in his manner of
expression; so Metaphorique and skilful in the usages of Poets, and their
Institutions, hand scio an in ullo alio P^eta Latino invenias quam in solo
Lucr^tio, is the voice of a very learned and judicious person. Other excellent
Poets he likewise imitated, and was so fortunate in the esteem of succeeding
Ages; that it even rose to a frequent Proverb, If amongst the Poets Ennius were
generally reputed to be the Grandfather, and Virgil the Son; LU^RETIUS must
needs be acknowledged for the Father as well of him, as of all that should come
after; as if the whole Assembly of the Epick Latin Poets were to be summ^^ up
and anacephaliz'd in this select ^riumviri.

To the Scrupulous now, which are the last sort of persons I have prom^sed to
treat with, and shall endeavor to satisfy: They are such as seem greatly to
declaim against our Author, as altogether Irreligious and Profane; and
therefore not fit (say they) to be so much as read or entertained amongst
Christians. But if this be the sole and grand objection, I would likewise
enquire, why those nicer and peevish spirits should at all approve, or in the
least make use of any other Heathen Writer whatsoever? The Stoics affirmed God
(who is the only source and veritable Original of all things) to be fast
linked and chained to a Series of Second Causes, obnox^ous to the Laws and
Decrees of Destiny and Necessity. Plato was a Leveller, and would have Wives
and most other things to be profane and impropriate* Aristotle bears us in
hand, that the World is Eternal a part ante, and post. Infinite other are the
exorbitant Chymaera's we encounter amongst the opinions and Placits of the
ancient Philosophers. In fine, why do we read any Poet of them all, since there
is none exempt of the most gross and absurd Fictions, apparent Levities, and
horrible Impieties imaginable? yet who is it amongst them, that does not even
embosome Juvenal, the most vicious, Aristophanes, Anacreon, Catullus, Martial,
Ausonius, and Petronius (to spare Beza, Buchanan, and others) the most loose,
and beyond comparison, abandoned, like so many pious Offices and Manuals;
celebrating their luxurious and disboashed spirits, whose fancies breath
nothing but their prodigious bestialities, and prostitute Cynaeduse's as so
many petty Oracles, or inspired Prophets? But grant them all this, and what
were yet worse (if more impious can be) (...), 1 Tit. 15.
that there was noth^ng able to corrupt a virtuous and honest mind, was the
opinion of Aristippus, as Laertius truly reports of him, Socr. Schol. l. 3. c.
14. Basil. de legend. Ethnicorum Scriptis. Aug. de doctrina Christiana.
being constrained one day to be present at a Ball in his reverend purple. And
that even the best of Christians were as capable to derive from them benefits,
as incontaminate and innocent, we may easily imagine and conceived; whilst we
find S. Paul that great Apostle himself, citing Parmenides, Aratus and
Menander; enough (I suppose) to justify how lawful it is to make use of the
good even in the midst of Evil. And if our Poet have any one passage (as where
he prevaricates on Providence, the Immortality of the Soul, the spontaneous
coalition of Principles, and some other sublime points of speculative
Theology) which seems to concern, or be any whit obnoxious to our Faith; he
has a thousand more, where amongst the rest of his most excellent Precepts,
and rare discourses, he persuades to a life the most exact and Moral; and no
man, I hope, comes hither as a Spider, to swell up his bag with poison only,
when with half that pains, he may with the industrious Be, store and furnish
his Hive with so much wholesome and delicious Honey.

Indignum profecto ob aliqua mala tam multa bona expungere, Gassend. de vita
and Morib. Epic. in Epist.
ac rosetum exscindere, quod spinas rosis intextas ferat.

ON MY Son Evelyns Translation OF THE FIRST BOOK of Lucretius.
IF Gulilaeus with his new found glass,
Former Invention does so far surpass,
By bringing distant bodies to our sight,
And make it judge their shape by nearer light,
How much have you obliged us? in whose mind
You Have coucht that Cataraect which made us blind,
And given our soul an optic can descrie
Not things alone, but where their causes lie?
Lucretius Englished, Natures great Code
And Digest too, where her deep Laws so showed,
That what we thought mysteriously perplexed
Translated thus, both Comment is and Text;
This polisht ^ey opens and let us us in
To her Conclave, Treasure and Magazin,
Where she majestic in bright rays appears
Unvailed o'ch' Cloud of seventeen hundred years.
That hoary mist of Ignorance is displaid
And brought to light what lay involved in shade;
By this your Sacred Clue severely led
Her intricat'st Meanders we do tread.
How spruce (thus trimmed) Philosophy looks now,
Which was morose before in beard and brow?
What we abhorred then, we now embrace;
A Nymph is seated in a Satyrs place,
And has a Palace for her gloomy School;
That Is a clear stream which was a muddy pool.
With how much pleasure then we now rehearse,
The crabbed'st part of learning in your verse,
And with the Muses to this reed of thine
We dance over horrid clifts, we could not clime,
Taking that wholesome pill with great de^ight,
Which, until gilded thus, did so affright*
Pedants ^arewel, this to our years affords
That whole half-age we lost in learning words:
Thus, in the worlds decline, the life of man
(Was but an Inch before) is made a Span.
Our infancy may now with milk and pap
Suck in deep Science in our Mothers lap;
Whilst at such ease to be both learned and wise
Be but born English, and it does suffice.
The North-west-passage would not prove so swi^^,
Nor make abridgement like to this your gift.
In which to our immense content we find
All that the Stagyrists envy burnt, refined.
Thus to the immortal glory of our Tongue,
This British Phoenix from those ashes sprung:
The Atoms of those volumus lost in Greece
(Gathered at Rome) You have made Jasons fleece,
Each grain whereof like the Elixar does
Fruitful projection in our minds bring forth*
Of that rare skill which by the vulgar much
Needs no^ be valued; nor by bulk, but touch.
What we since him did pure invention deem
Dilated memory, not wit does seem;
We now believe't demonstratively true
Under the Sun, there is nothing that is new.
And he that would no emptiness maintain
Belyes himself, the Vacuum's in his Brain.
Vain then it were to undertake to write
All old mistakes; error is infinite.
It Is thus, Inspired Lucretius, alone,
Is th'Oracle of all that can be known;
Steward to Fate, Creations Notary,
Truths Register, Natures Secretary.
Proceed (dear Youth) and in thy noble Verse
Perfect this Canon of the Universe,
For great example to thy self prefix
That Architect, which wrought from one to Six.
Richard Brown, Knight and Baronet.

To his Worthy Friend Master EVELYN, UPON HIS TRANSLATION OF LUCRETIUS:
LVCRETIVS with a Stork-like ^ate, According to the Institution of Epicurus in
relation to whom these Verses were intended, and no^ that the Interpreter does
justify this irreligion of the Poet, whose Arguments he afterward resutes:

Born and translated in a State,
Comes to proclaim in English Verse
No Monarch Rules the Universe;
But chance and Atoms make this All
In Order Democratical,
Where Bodies freely run their course,
Without design, or Fate, or Force.
And this in such a strain he sings,
As if his Muse with Angels wings
Had soa^'d beyond our utmost Sphere,
And other Worlds discovered there;
For his immortal boundless wit
To nature does no bounds permit;
But boldly has removed those bars
Of Heaven, and Earth, and Seas and Stars,
By which they were before supposed
By narrow wits to be enclosed,
'Till his free Muse threw down the Pale,
And did at once dispark them all*
So vast this Argument did seem
That the wise Author did esteem
The Roman Language which was spread
Ore the whole world in Triumph led,
A Tongue too narrow to unfold
The Wonders which he would have rold.
This speaks thy Clorie, noble Friend,
And British Language do^s commend;
For here Lucret^us whole we find,
His Words, his Music, and his mind:
Thy Art has to our Country brought
All that he writ, and all he thought.
Ovid translated, Virgil too
Showed long since what our Tongue could do;
Nor Lucan we, nor Horace spared,
Only Lucretius was too hard.
Lucretius, like a Fort did stand
Untoucht, till your Victorious hand
Did from his head this garland bear,
Which now upon your own You wear:
A Garland made of such new Bays
And sought in such untrodden ways,
As no man's Temples ere did Crown,
Save this great Authors and your own.
Edmund Waller.

Non, quia gente vales quae late clara per Anglos
Fixerit hinc, illinc, dives ubique, Lares:
Nec tantum quia communes nurtitus in arts
Ingenii lauds, quas sequor, ipse tenes:
Idcirco quacunque moror, quacunque morabor,
Ev'^^ni credam non meminisse nefas,
Cum mihi nota fides, and moribus insita virtus,
A grato Sali^m vate sonandus eras.
Nil mediocre potes quicquid sub pectore volvis,
Sive sit ingenii, seu pietatis opus.
Tu mihi Memmiades, reliquis Lucretius audi,
Magna geris de te victor, and alta canis:
Natales Coelorum and concrescentia Secla
Et motis spatium rebus inane paras.
Quae nunquam loquimur, nec adhuc been novimus Angli
Vnde datis, mirar, vocibus aucta refers
Hos ego non ausim libros tentare profanus
Nam metuens altum litora tuta lego.
Ergo age quod solus potes, and quod patria poscit
(O mul^um and merito culte, colende mihi,
Rure vaces tantisper, and hortis utere cultor
Ne Furnum docta^ polluat usque manus)
Fae mihi deducas ad mundi funera carmen
Supremum, vates quem canit, add rogum:
Non nisi cum coelo, terraque, mariq^ solutis
Hoc opus impleri, sive sperire potest.
Christophorus Wasi.

For my Honored FRIEND and KINSMAN John Evelyn Esquire
NOBLE COZEN,
YOurs of (...) instant, together with a Manuscript which your modesty is
pleased to entitle, An Essay upon the first Book of Lucretius, found me out in
this remote corner; whereby I perceive a friend (how clouded soever with
absence and mifortunes) can no more be hidden to your kindeness, then the most
abstruse Author to your Apprehension, or (by that time you have done with him)
to any man's else: Yet absence alone is a death, not that it uses to kill
friends, but friendship. The Spaniard calls it, putting of earth between; so
both Death and Burial too, and he has a proverb that tells us, A muertos y a
ydos no ay Amigos; the crossing whereof is the thing I now take so kindly at
your hands. Then (to evidence that no Author whatsoever can stand in your way)
I know not where you could have made so crabbed a choice as you have done,
though for intrinsic value an incomparable one, and well quitting your pains.
On my word (Cozen) this Piece is The taming of the Shrew. What shall I say
more? Having (as skilfully as I could) confronted his Latin with your English,
they appear to me Life's both: or rather both pictures of one life, the features
being exactly the same in each, only yours (as the younger) so the smoother.
It puts me in mind of the two Amphitruo's in Plautus, where the Translation
was taken for the Original by her that should best have known; which mistake
had probably not happened, if the Divine Counterfeit could not have spoken the
Husbands Thoughts, as well as induced his Shape. And if that Metamorphosis made
a long night; this of yours, I am sure, makes the day short. But I injure it
with the name of a Translation, it is Lucretius himself. A judged Case in a
certain Italian Comedy. Thus, a Bondsman of Naples is apprehended in open
street: No running away now, no denying the fact for which he is accused. What
then? he changes his language, facing both the Officers and his Prosecutors
down in perfect Spanish (a concealed quality he had) that he is not the man
they take him for; nay, not so much as of the Nation. In this manner fences for
a good space against them All (the Scene is not unplesant.) But do you think it
served his turn in the end* No, nor would have done, though he had for his
better disguise shifted himself into a Gentile habit and garb. And so shall we
know LUCRE^IUS in your Book, though it retains neither his voice* nor yet his
lineaments; nor have you in my conceit (however I find it difficult to
explain) so much put him into your clothes, as out of his own person,

-- Sic parvis componere pulchra solebam.
One thing I must needs acquaint you with, and it is, that this came to my
hands, just when I had made an end of reading a Posthumous Translation by Mr.
or Dr. Bat hurst, lately printed at London (I presume you have seen it) of
Spencer's Shepherds Calendar into Latin; as if opportunely to prevent my
idolizing that Language: to the advantage whereof above ours, I do not now
impute that admirable work, which (unless my Augury deceive me) will, where its
true Origin shall be unknown, pass for a Native of old Rome, and that as far,
as the utmost bounds extend of the Commonwealth of Learning. For if the great
wonder there be, how a Poem, which the Author made it his business to cloth in
rugged English, could be capable of so smoath Latin; certainly it is no less a
one here, how so rugged a Latin Poem (rugged in spite of your Authors teeth,
through the stubbornness of the Stuff, and poverty of words, as himself
confesses) can be rendered in so smooth English. And if Mr. Bathurst by that
exported commodity do more honor to England Abroad; You, by this imported, will
more enrich it at home, making our Income proportionable to our Expense.

Thus (Cousin) since you will make a Country Fellow a Judge) I have parted the
Apple between you; although it is true, the other Gentleman's Cause is not
before me; yet, because his Merits are. But that which I give you entirely to
your self, is

Tankersley 27 December. 1653. Sir, Your very affectionate Kinsman and humble
Servant, Richard Fanshawe.

The Argument.
THe Poet invocates Venus, by whom, as a Philosopher, he understands the
Goddess Nature, or rather, Nature it self; and under the persons of Venus and
Mars, most ingeniously infers his design to speak of Generation and Corruption.
Then after the dedication of his work, he intreates of the nature of Gods; and
from them falls upon the praise of Epicurus, for his bold discovery of the
absurd superstition of the times; the great inconveniences whereof he
illustrates by the cruel Sacrifice of Iphigenia. Then having divinely
celebrated the Poet Ennius, introduces his opinion touching the separation of
souls from their Bodies, with diverse other speculations concerning the nature
of Spirits* the difficulty of which Argument causes him to acknowledge the
insufficiency of the Latin Tongue to treat of ma^ters so Philosophic and
abstracted. Then he proves that nothing can be created out of Nothing; but that
there are certain Principles which belong to all kinds of things: that nothing
may be totally annihilat^d; but that from the Corruption of one another still
proceeds, and is generated. Then he discourses of the admirable effects of
the Rain of Bodies imperceptible: of the violence of Winds, of the course and
monstrous Inundations of Waters; of Smells, Heat, Cold, of the Voice; of
descent of the Dew into Cloach; of those things which diminish by frequent use
and handling; likewise of Void, of Fishes in the Water, of Solid Bodies which
Separate themselves, and how Void and Bodies constitute the nature of all other
things: That there is no such thing as any Third Nature. Of Accidents, of Time,
and of the other Principles of Things. Of things which consist of a soft
Nature, as of Water and Atoms. Disputes and argues against Heraclitus, who
would maintain Fire to be the Universal Principle. Against Empedocles, that
affirms the same Original to result out of all the four Elements. Against
Anaxagoras, who confounds Nature by his similar parts. Then he sublimely
entreats of solid Bodies, and of Infinite; affirming last of all, that there is
no such thing as Center, toward which all things do tend, and are
spontaneously carried.

T. LVCRETII CARI DE RERUM NATURA. LIBER PRIMUS.
Lib. I.
AeNeadum genetrix, hominum Divumque voluptas,
Alma Venus, coeli subter labentia signa
Quae mare navigerum, quae terras frugiferentis
Concelebras; per te quoniam genus omne animantu^
Concipitur, visitque exortum lumina Solis;
Te dea, te fugiunt venti, te nubila coeli,
Adventumque tuum; tibi suavis daed^la tellus
Summittit flores; tibi rident aequora ponti
Placatumque nites diffuso lumine coelum.
Nam simul ac species patefacta est verna diei;
Et re^erata riget genitalis a^ra Favon I,
Aeriae primum volucres te, DIVA, tuumque
Significant initium percussae corda tua vi;
Inde ferae pecudes persultant pabula laeta;
Et rapido^s tranant amnis; ita capta lepore,
Te sequitur cupide, quo quamque inducere pergis.
Denique per maria, ac montis, fluviosq, rapaci^,
F^ondiferasque domos a^ium, camposque virentis,
Omnibus in^^tiens blandum per pectora amore^,
Efficis, ut cupide generatim saecla propagent.
Quae quoniam rerum naturam sola gubernas,
Nec sine te quidquam dias in luminis oras
Exoritur* neque sit laetum, nec amabile quidquam,
Te sociam studio scribendis versibus esse,
Quos ^go De Rerum Natura pangere conor
Memmiadae nostro; quem tu DEA tempore in omni
Omnibus ornatum voluisti excellere rebus.
Quo magis aeternum da dictis diva leporem
Effice, ut interea fera moenera militiai
Per maria, ac terras omnis sopita quiescant.
Nam tu sola potes tranquilla pace juvare
Mortalis: quoniam belli fera moenia Mavors
Armipotens regit: in gremium qui saepe tuum s^
Reficit aeterno devinctus volnere amoris.
A^que ita suspiciens tereti cervice reposta,
Pascit amore avidos inhians inte dea, visus;
Eque tuo pendit resupini spiritus ore.
Hunc tu diva, tuo recubantem corpore sancto
Circumfusa super, suavis ex ore loquelas
Funde, petens placidam Romany incluta pac^m:
Nam neque nos agere hoc patriai tempore iniquo
Possumus aequo animo: nec Memmi clara propago
Talibus in rebus, communi deesse saluti.
Quod superest, vacuas auris mihi Memmius and te
Semotum a curis adhibe veram ad rationem,
Nec mea dona tibi studio disposta fideli,
Intellecta prius quam sint, contempta relidquas.
Nam tibi de summa Coeli ratione, deumque
Disserere incipiam; and rerum primordia pandam:
Vnde omnis natura creet res, auctet, alatque
Quove eadem rursum natura perempta resolvat:
Quae nos materie^m, and genitalia corpora rebus
Reddunda in ratione vo^are; and semina verum
Adpellare suemus and haec eadem usurpare
Corpora prima quod ex illis sunt omnia primis.
Omnis enim per se Divum natura necesse est
Immortali aevo summa cum pace fruatur.
Semota a nostris rebus, sejunctaque long.
Nam privata dolor omni privata periclis.
Ipsa suis pollens opibus: nihil indiga nostri,
Nec been promeritis capitur, nec tangitur ira.
Humana ante oculos foede cum vita jaceret
Interris oppressa gravi sub Religione:
Quae caput a coeli regionibus ostendebat,
Horribili super adspect^ mortalibus instans:
Primum Graius homo mortalis tollere contra
Est oculos ausus, primusque obsistere contra;
Quem nec fama Deum nec fulmina nec minitant^
Murmr compressit coelum: sedeo magis acr^^
Virtutem irritat animi, confringere ut arta
Naturae primus portarum claustra cupiret.
Ergo Vivida vis animi pervicit, and extra
Processit long flammantia moenia mundi:
Atque omne immensum peragravit men^e, animoque
Vnde refert nobis Victor quid possit oriri
Quid nequeat; finita potestus denique cuique
Quanam sit ratione; utque alte terminus hereat.
Quars Religio pedibus subjecta vicissim
Obteritur; nos exaequat victoria coelo.
Illud in his rebus vereor, ne forte rearis
Impia te rationis inire elementa, viamque
Endogredi sceleris: quod contrae saepius olim
Relligio peperi^ scelerosa, atque impia facta:
Aulide quo pacto Triviai virginis aram,
Iphianassai turparunt sanguine foede
Ductores Danaum delecti, prima virorum:
Cui simul infula virgineos circumdata comptus
Ex utraque pari malarum part profusa est;
Et maestum simul ante aras adstare parentem
Sensit, and hunc propter ferrum caelare ministros;
Adspectuque suo lacrumas effundere cives;
Muta metu, terram genibus summissa petebat.
Nec miserae prodesse in tali tempore quibat,
Quod patrio princeps donarat nomine regem:
Nam sublata virum m^nibus, tremebu^daque ad aras
Deducta est, non ut sollemni more sacrorum
Perfecto, posset claro comitari hymenaeo;
Sed casta inceste nubendi tempore in ipso
Hostia concideret mactatu maesta parentis:
Exitus ut classi felix, faustusque daretur.
Tantum relligio potuit suadere malorum.
Tutemet a nobis jam quovis tempore vatum
Terriloquis victus dictis desciscere quaeres.
Quippe etenim quam multa tibi me fingere possum
Somnia, qu^e vitae rations vertere possint;
Fortunas que tuas omnes turbare timore?
Et merito, nam si certam finem esse viderent
Aerumnarum homines; aliqua ratione valerent
Relligionibus, atque minis obsistere vatum:
Nunc ratio nulla est restandi, nulla facultas,
Aeternas quoniam poenas in morte timendum:
Ignoratur enim, quae sit natura animai:
Nata sit; an contra, nascentibus insinuetur:
Et simul intereat nobiscum morte dirempta;
An tenebras Orci visat, vastasque lacunas:
An pecudes alias divinitus insinuet se;
Ennius ut noster cecinit, qui primus amoeno
Detulit ex Helicone perenni frunde coronam;
Per gentis Italas omnium quae clara clueret.
Et si praeterea tamen esse Acherusia templa
Ennius aeternis exponit versibus edens;
Quo neque permanent animae, neque corpora nostra;
Sed quaedam simulacra modis pallentia miris.
Vnde sibi exortam semper florentis Homeri
Commemorat speciem, lacrumas and fundere salsas
Coepisse, and rerum naturam expandere dictis:
Quapropter been cum superis de rebus habenda
Nobis est ratio; solis, lunaeque meatus
Qua siant ratione; and qua vi quaeque gerantur:
In terris; tum cumprimis ratione sagaci,
Vnde anima, atque animi constet natura, videndum
Et quae res nobis vigilantibus obvia, mentes
Terrificent, morbo adfectis, somnoque sepultis:
Cernere uti videamur ^os, audireque coram,
Morte obita qnorum tellus amplectitur ossa.
Nec me animus fallit Graiorum obscura reperta
Difficile inlustrare Latinis versibus esse:
Multa novis verbis praesertim cum sit agendum,
Propter egestatem linguae, and rerum novitatem.
Sed tua me virtus tamen, and sperata voluptas
Suavis amicitiae, quemvis efferre laborem
Suadet, and inducit noctes vigilare serenas,
Quaerentem dictis quibus, and quo carmine demum
Clara tuae possim praepandere lumina menti;
Res quibus occultas penitus, convisere possis.
Hunc igitur terrorem animi, tenebrasque necesse est
Non radii solis, neque lucida tela diei
Discutiant, sed naturae species, ratioque;
Principium ^inc cujus nobis exordia sumet,
Nullam rem e nihilo gigni divinitus umquam.
Quippe ita formido mortalis continet omnis,
Quod multa in terris fieri, coeloque tuentur:
Quorum operum caussas nulla ratione videre
Possunt; ac fieri divino numine rentur.
Quas ob res, ubi viderimus, nihil posse creari
De nihilo: Tum, quod sequimur, jam rectius inde
Perspiciemus, and unde queat-res quaeque creari;
Et quo quaeque modo fiant opera sine divum.
Nam si de nihilo fierent, ex omnibus rebus
Omne genus nasci posset: Nihil semine egeret.
E mare primum homines, e terr a posset oriri
Squamig erum genus, and volucres, erumpere caelo
Armenta, atque aliae pecudes: Genus omne ferarum
Incerto partu culta, ac deserta teneret.
Nec fructus iidem arboribus constare solerent,
Sed mutarentur: far omnes omnia possent.
Quippe ubi non essent genitalia corpora cuique,
Qui posset matter rebus consistere certa?
At nunc seminibus quia certis quaeque creantur:
Inde enascitur, atque oras in luminis exit.
Materies ubi inest cujusque and corpora prima.
Atque hac re nequeunt ex omnibus omnia gigni,
Quod certis in rebus inest secreta facultas.
Praeterea, cur vere rosam, frumenta calore,
Vites auctumno fundi sudante videmus:
Si non, certa suo quia tempore semina rerum
Cum confluxerunt, patefit quodcumque creatur,
Dum tempestates adsunt; and vivida tellus
Tuto res teneras effert in luminis oras?
Quod si de nihilo sierent; subito exorerentur
Incerto spatio, atque alienis partibus anni:
Quippe ubi nulla forent primordia, quae genitali
Concilio possent arceri tempore iniquo.
Nec porro augendis rebus, spatio foret usus
Seminis ad coitum, e nihilo si crescere possent.
Nam fierent juvenes subito ex infantibus parvis:
E terraque exorta repent arbusta salirent.
Quorum nihil fieri manifestum est; omnia quando
Paulatim crescunt, ut par est, semine certo:
Crescendoque genus servant, ut noscere possis
Quaeque sua de materia grandescere, alique.
Huc accidet, uti sine certis imbribus anni
Laetificos nequeat fetus summittere tellus:
Nec porro secreta cibo natura animantum
Propagare genus possit, vitamque tueri.
Vt potius multis communia corpora rebus
Multa putes esse, ut verbis elementa videmus,
Quam sine principiis ullam rem existere posse.
Denique cur homines tantos natura parare
Non potuit, pedibus qui pontum per vada possent
Transire, and magnos manibus divellere montes,
Multaque vivendo vitalia vincere saecla:
Si non materies quia rebus reddita certa est
Gignundis, e qua constat quid possit oriri?
Nil igitur fieri de nihilo posse fatendum est:
Semine quando opus est rebus, quo quaeque creatae
Aeris in teneras possint proferrier auras,
Postremo, quoniam incultis praestare videmus
Culta loca, and manibus meliores reddier fetus;
Esse videlicet in terris primordia rerum:
Quae nos fecundas vertentes vomere glebas,
Terraique solum subigentes, cimus ad ortus.
Quod si nulla forent; nostro sine quaeque labor
Sponte sua multo fieri meliora videres:
Huc accedit, uti quaeque in sua corpora rursum
Dissolvat natura, neque ad nihilum interimat res.
Nam si quid mortale e cunctis partibus esset;
Ex oculis res quaeque repent erepta periret:
Nulla vi foret usus ei, quae partibus ejus
Discidium parere, and nexus exsolvere posset.
Quod nunc, aeterno quia constat semine quaeque,
Donec vis obiit, quae res diverberet ictu,
Aut intus penetret per inania, dissolvatque;
Nullius exitium patitur natura videri.
Praeterea, quaecunque vetustate amovet aetas,
Si penitus perimit, consumens materiem omnem,
Vnde animale genus generatim in lumina vitae
Reducit Venus? aut reductum daedala tellus
Vnde alit, atque auget, generatim pabula praebens?
Vnde mare, ingenui fontes, externaque long
Flumina suppeditant? unde ether sidera pascit?
Omnia enim debet, mortali corpore quae sunt,
Infinita aetas consumse anteacta, diesque.
Quod si in eo spatio, anteacta aetate fuere,
E quibus haec rerum consistit summa refecta
Immortali sunt natura praedita certe.
Haud igitur possunt ad nihilum quaeque reverti
Denique res omnis eadem vis, causaque volgo
Conficeret, nisi materies aeterna teneret
Inter se nexus, minus aut magis endopedita.
Tactus enim, leti satis esset caussa profecto:
Quippe ubi nulla forent aeterno corpore: eorum
Contextum vis deberet dissolvere quaeque.
At nunc, inter se quia nexus principiorum
Dissimiles constant; aeternaque materies est:
Incolumi remanent res corpore: dum satis acris
Vis obeat pro textura cujusque reperta:
Haud igitur redit ad nihilum res ulla: sed omnes
Discidio redeunt in corpora materiai.
Postremo pereunt imbres, ubi eos pater ether
In gremium matris terrai praecipitavit:
At nitidae surgunt fruges, ramique virescunt
Arboribus; crescunt ipsae, fetuque gravantur.
Hinc alitur porro nostrum genus, atque ferarum:
Hinc laetas urbes pueris florere videmus;
Frundifer asque novis avibus canere undique silvas.
Hinc fessae pecudes pingues per pabula laeta
Corpora deponunt: and candens lacteus humor
Vberibus manat distentis: hinc nova proles
Artibus infirmis teneras lasciva per herbas
Ludit, lacte mero mentis percussa novellas.
Haud igitur penitus pereunt quaecumque videntur;
Quando aliud ex alioreficit natura; nec ullam
Rem gigni patitur, nisi morte adjuta aliena.
Nunc agesis, quoniam docui nihil posse creari
De nihilo, neque item genita ad nihilum revocari:
Ne qua forte tamen coeptes diffidere dictis;
Quod nequeunt oculis rerum primor dia cerni;
Accipe praeterea, quae corpora tute necesse est
Confiteare esse in rebus, nec posse videri.
Principio venti vis verberat incita portus,
Ingentisque ruit navis, and nubila differt:
Interdum rapido percurrens turbine campos
Arboribus magnis sternit, montisqne supremos
Silvifragis vexat flabris: ita perfurit acri
Cum fremitu, saevitque minaci murmr pontus.
Sunt igitur venti nimirum corpora caeca;
Quae mare, quae terras, quae denique nubila coeli
Verrunt, ac subito vexantia turbine raptant.
Nec ratione fluunt alia, stragemque propagant;
Quam cum mollis aquae fertur natura repent
Flumine abundanti, quod largis imbribus auget
Montibus ex altis magnus de^ursus aquai
Fragmina coniciens silvarum, arbustaque tota:
Nec validi possunt pontes venientis aquai
Vim subitam tolerare, ita magno turbidus imbri
Molibus incurrit validis cum viribus amnis:
Dat sonitu magno stragem, voluitque sub undis
Grandia saxa, ruit qua quidquid fluctibus obstat*
Sic igitur debent venti quoque flumina ferri;
Quae, veluti validum flumen, cum procubuere:
Quamlibet in partem trudunt res ante, ruuntque
Impetibus cr^bris: interdum vertice torto
Conripiunt, rapidique rotanti turbine portant.
Quare etiam atque etiam sunt venti corpora caeca:
Quandoquidem factis, ac moribus, aemula magnis
Amnibus inveniuntur, aperto corpore qui sunt.
Tum porro varios rerum sentimus odores;
Nec tamen ad nares, venientes cernimus umquam:
Nec calidos aestus tuimur, nec frigora quimus
Vsurpare oculis; nec voces cernere suemus:
Quae tamen omnia corporea constare necesse est
Natura; quoniam sensus impellere possunt.
Tangere enim and tangi, nisi corpus, nulla potest res
Denique fluctifrago suspensae in litore vestes
Vvescunt: eaedem dispansae in sole serescunt.
Vt neque quo pacto persederit humor aquai,
Visum est, nec rursum, quo pacto fugerit aestu.
In parvas igitur parts dispergitur humor;
Quas oculi nulla possunt ratione videre.
Quinetiam multis solis redeuntibus annis
Anulus in digito subterten^atur habendo:
Stillicid I casus lapidem cavat: uncus aratri
Ferreus occulte decrescit vomer in arvis:
Strataque jam volgi pedibus detrita viarum
Saxea conspicimus: tum portas propter ahena
Signa manus dixtras obstendunt attenuari
Saepe salutantum tactu, praeterque meantum:
Haec igitur minui, cum sunt detrita, videmus:
Sed quae corpora decodant in tempore quoque,
Invida praeclusit speciem natura videndi.
Postremo, quaecunque dies, naturaque rebus
Paulatim tribuit, moderatim crescere cogens;
Nulla potest oculorum acies contenta tueri.
Nec porro quaecunque aevo macieque senescunt:
Nec, mare qu^e impendent vesco sale saxa peresae,
Quid qu^que admittant in tempore cernere possis.
Corporibus caecis igitur natura gerit res.
Nec tamen undique corporea stipata tenentur
Omnia natura; uamque est in rebus inane:
Quod tibi cognosse in multis erit utile rebus;
Nec sinet errantem dubitare, and quaerere semper
De summa rerum, and nostris diffidere dictis.
Quapropter locus est intactus, inane, vacansque.
Quod si non esset, nulla ratione moveri
Res possent: namque officium quod corporum exstat,
Officere, atque obstare, id in omni tempore adesset
Omnibus: haud igitur quidquam procedere posset*
Principium qua^iam cedendi nulla daret res.
At nunc per maria, ac terras, sublimaque caeli,
Multa modis multis varia ratione moveri
Cernimus ante oculos; quae, si non esset inane,
Non tam sollicito motis privata carerent,
Quam genita omnino nulla ratione fuissent:
Vndique materies quoniam stipata quiesset:
Praeterea quamvis solidae res esse putentur;
Hinc tamen esse licet raro cum corpore cernas:
In saxis ac speluncis permanat aquarum
Liquidus humor, and uberibus flent omnia guttis:
Dissupat in corpus sese cibus ^mne animantum:
Crescunt arbusta, and fetus in tempore fundunt,
Quod cibus in tota usque vel ab radicibus imis
Per truncos, ac per ramos diffunditur omnis:
Inter saepta meant voces, and clausa domorum
Transvolitant: rigidum permanat frigus ad ossa:
Quod, nisi inania sint, qua possent corpore quaeque
Transire, haud ulla fieri ratione videres.
Denique cur alias aliis prestare videmus
Pondere res rebus, nihilo majore figura?
Nam si tantumdem est in lanae glomere, quantum
Corporum in plumbo est; tantundem pendere par est:
Corporu^ officium est quonia^ premere omnia deorsum:
Contra autem natura manet sine pondere, inanis.
Ergo quod magnum est aeque, leviusque videtur,
Nimirum plus esse sibi declarat inanis.
At conta gravius, plus in se corporum esse
Dedicat, and multo vacui minus intus habere.
Est igitur nimirum, id quod ratione sagaci
Quaerimus, admistum rebus quod inane vocamus.
Illud in his rebus ne te deducere vero
Possit, quod quidem ^^ngunt, praecurrere cogor
Cedere squamigeris latices nitentibus aiunt;
Et liquidas aperire vias: quia post loca pisces
Linquant quo possint cedentes confluere undae:
Sic alias quoque res inter se posse moveri,
Et mutare locum, quamvis sint omnia plena.
Scilicet id falsa totum ratione receptum est:
Nam quo squamigeri poterunt procedere tandem,
Ni spatium dederint latices? concedere porro
Quo poterunt undae, cum pisces ire nequibunt?
Aut igitur motu privandum est corpora quaeque:
Aut esse admistum dicendum est rebus inane;
Vnde initium primum capiat res quaeque movendi.
Postremo duo de concursu corpora lata
Si cita dissiliant; nempe der omne necesse est
Inter corpora quod fiat, possidat inane:
Is porro, quamvis circum celerantibus auris
Confluat; haud poterit tamen uno tempore totum
Complere spatium: nam primum quemque necesse est
Occupet ille locum, deinde omnia possideantur.
Quod si forte aliquis, cum corpora dissiluere,
Tum putat id fieri, quia se condenseat aer,
Errat; nam vacuum tunc fit, quod non fuit ante;
Et repletur item, vacuum quod constitit ante.
Nec tali ratione potest denserier aer;
Nec si jam posset, sine inani posset, opinor,
Se ipse in se trahere, and partis conducere in unum.
Qua propter quamvis caussando multa moreris,
Esse in rebus inane tamen fateare necesse est.
Multaque praeterea tibi possum commemorando
Argumenta, fidem dictis contradere nostris:
Verum animo satis haec vestigia parvi sagaci
Sunt, perque possis cognoscere cetera tute.
Namque canes ut montivagae persaepe ferai
Naribus inveniunt intectas frunde quietes
Cum semel institerunt vestigia certa viai:
Sic aliud ex alio per te tute ipse videre
Talibus in rebus poteris, caecasque laterbras
Insinuare omnis, and verum protrahere inde.
Quod nisi pigraris, paullumve recesseris ab re;
Hoc tibi de plano possum promittere Memmi,
Vsque adeo largos haustus de fontibus magnis
Lingua meo suavis diti de pectore fundet;
Vt verear, ne tarda prius per membra senectus
Serpat and in nobis vitai claustra resolvat,
Quam tibi de quavis una re versibus omnis
Argumentorum sit copia missa per auris.
Sed nunc jam repetam coeptum pertexere dictis:
Omnis ut est igitur per se natura, duabus
Consistit rebus nam corpora sunt, and inane,
Haec in quo sita sunt, and qua diversa moventur.
Corpus enim per se communis dedicat esse
Sensus: quo nisi prima fides fundata valebi^,
Haud erit occultis de rebus quo referent^s
Confirmare animi quidquam ratione queamus.
Tum porro locus, ac spatium, quod inane vocamus,
Si nullum foret; haud usquam sita corpora possent
Esse, neque omnino quaquam diversa meare:
Id quod jam supra tibi paullo ostendimus ante.
Praeterea nihil est, quod possis dicere ab omni
Corpore sejunctum, secret umque esse ab inani,
Quod quasi tertia sit numero natura reperta.
Nam quodcunque erit, esse aliquid debebit id ipsum
Augmine vel grandi, vel par (...) denique, dum sit:
Cui si tactus ^rit quamvis levis, exiguusque;
Corporum augebit numerum, summ^mque sequetur:
Sin intactile erit, nulla de part quod ullam
Rem prohibere queat per se transire meantem;
Scilicet hoc id erit, vacuum quod inane vocamus.
Praeterea per se quodcunque erit, aut faciet quid,
Aut aliis fungi debebit agentibus ipsum;
Aut erit, ut possint in eo res esse, gerique.
At facere and fungi sine corpore nulla potest res:
Nec praebere locum porro, nisi inane, vacansque.
Ergo praeter inane, and corpora, tertia per se
Nulla potest^ erum in numero natura relinqui,
Nec quae sub sensus cadat ullo tempore nostros;
Nec, ratione animi quam quisquam possit apisci.
Nam quaecumque cluent, aut his conjuncta duabus
Rebus ea invenies; aut horum eventa videbis.
Conjunctum est id, quod nunquam sine perniciali
Discidio potis est sejungi, seque gregari:
Pondus uti saxis, oalor ignibus, liquor aquai,
Tactus corporibus cunctis intactus inani.
Servitium contra, libertas; divitneque,
Paupertas, bellum, concordia; cetera, quorum
Adventis manet incolumis natura, abituque;
Haec soliti sumus, ut par est, eventa vocare.
Tempus item per se non est; sed rebus ab ipsis
Consequitur sensus, transactum quid sit in aevo;
Tum quae res instet; quid porro deinde sequatur:
Nec per se quenquam tempus sentire fatendum est,
Semotum ab rerum motu, placidaque quiet.
Denique Tyndaridem raeptaem, belloque subactas
Trojugenas gentis cum dicunt esse, videndum est,
Ne forte haec per se cogant nos esse fateri,
Quando and saecla hominum, quoru^ haec eventa fuere,
In revocabilis abstulerit jam praeterita aetas.
Namque aliud rebus, aeliud regionibus ipsis
Eventum dici poterit, quodcunque erit actum:
Denique materies si rerum nulla^ fuisset;
Nec locus ad spatium res in quo quaequo geruntur;
Numquam Tindaridis formae conflatus amore
Ignis Alexandri Phrygio sub pectore gliscens
Clara accendisset saevi certamina belli.
Nec clam durateus Troianis Pergama partu
Inflammasset equus nocturno Grajugenarum,
Perspicere ut possis res gestas funditus omnis,
Non ita uti corpus per se constare neque esse,
Nec ratione cluere eadem, qua constat inane:
Sed magis ut merito possis eventa vocare
Corporum, atque loci, res in quo quaeque gerantur.
Copora sunt porro partim primordia rerum;
Partim concilio quae constant principiorum.
Sed quae sunt rerum primordia, nulla potest vis
Stringere; nam solido vincunt ea corpore demum,
Etsi difficile esse videtur credere quidquam
In ^ebus solido reperiri corpore posse:
Transit enim fulmen caeli per caepta domorum;
Clamor ut, ac voces: ferrum candescit in igne;
Dissiliuntque fero, ferventi saxa vapore:
Quin labefactatus rigor auri solvitur aestu:
Tum glacies aeris flammae devicta liquescit:
Permanat calor argentum, penetraleque frigus,
Quando utrumque, manu retinentes pocula rite,
Sensimus infuso lympharum rore superne.
Vsqueadeo in rebus solidi nihil esse videtur.
Sed quia vera tamen ratio, naturaque rerum
Cogit, ades, paucis dum versibus expediamus,
Esse ea, quae solido, atque aeterno corpore constent,
Semina quae rerum, primordiaque esse docemus;
Vnde omnis rerum nunc constes summa creata.
Principio quoniam duplex natura duarum
Dissimiles rerum long constare repertae est,
Corporum, atque loci, res in quo quaeque geruntur:
Esse utramque sibi per se, pur^mque necesse est.
Nam quacumque vacat spatium, quod inane vocamus
Corpus ea non est qua porro cumque tenet se
Corpus, ea vacuum nequaquam constat inane.
Sunt igitur solida, ac sine inani corpora prima.
Praeterea quoniam genit is in rebus inane est,
Materiam circum solidam constare necesse est:
Nec res ulla potest vera ratione probari
Corpore inane suo celare, atque intus habere,
Si non, quod cohibet, solidum constare relinquas.
Id ponro nihil esse potest, nisi materiai
Concilium, quod inane queat rerum cohibere.
Materies igitur, solido quae corpore constat,
Esse aeterna potest, cum cetera dissoluantur.
Tum porro si nihil esset, quod inane vacaret;
Omne foret solidum: nisi contra corpora certa
Essent, quae loca complerent, quaecunque tenerent;
Omne quodest spacium, vaouum constare inane.
Alternis igitur nimirum corpus inani
Distinctum est; quoniam nec plenum navitur exstat:
Nec porro vacuum. sunt ergo corpora certa,
Quae spatium pleno possint distinguere inane.
Haec neque dissolvi plagis extrinsecus icta
Possunt, nec porro penitus penetrata retexi;
Nec ratione queunt alia tentata labare:
Id quod jam supera tibi paullo ostendimus ante.
Nam neque conlidi sine inani posse videtur
Quidquam, nec frangi, nec findi in bina secando:
Nec capere humorem, neque item manabile frigus,
Nec penetralem ignem, quibus omnia conficiuntur:
Et quo quaeque magis cohibet res intus inane,
Tam magis his rebus penitus tentata labascit.
Ergo si solida, ac sine inani corpora prima
Sunt, ita uti docui, sint haec aeterna, necesse est.
Praeterea, nisi materies aeterna fuisset,
Ante hac ac nihilum penitus res quaeque redissent:
De nihilo quoque nata forent, quaecumque videmus.
At quoniam supra docui nihil posse creari
De nihilo; neque quod genitum est, ad nihil revocari:
Esse immortali primordia corpore debent,
Dissolvi quo quaeque supremo tempore possint,
Materies ut suppeditet rebus reparandis.
Sunt igitur solida primordia simplicitate;
Nec ratione queunt alia servata per aevum,
Ex infinito jam tempore res reparare.
Denique si nullam finem natura parasset
Frangendis rebus; jam corpora materiai
Vsque redacta forent, aevo frangente priore,
Vt nihil ex illis a certo tempore posset
Conceptum, summum aetatis pervadere finem.
Nam quidvis citius dissolvi posse videmus,
Qnam rursus refici: quapropter, longa diei
Infinitae aetus anteacti temporis omnis
Quod fregisset adhuc disturbans, dissolvensque,
Numquam reliquo reparari tempore posset.
Ac nunc nimirum frangendi reddita finis
Certa manet, quoniam reficirem quamque videmus,
Et finita simul generatim tempora rebus
Stare, quibus possint aevi contingere florem.
Hoc accedit, uti, solidissima materiai
Corpora quom constant, possint tamen omnia reddi
Mollia, quae fiant aer, aqua, terra, vapores,
Quo pacto fiant, and qua vi cumque gerantur:
Admistum quoniam simul est in rebus inane.
At contra si mollia sint primordia rerum*
Vnde queant vallidi silices, ferrumque creari,
Non poterit ratio reddi: nam funditus omnis
Principio fundamenti natura carebit:
Sunt igitur solida pollentia simplicitate;
Quorum condenso magis omnia conciliatu
Artari possunt, validasque ostendere vires.
Denique jam quoniam generatim reddita finis
Crescendi rebus constat, vitamque tuendi:
Et quid quaeque queant per foedera naturai,
Quid porro nequeant, sancitu^ quandoquide^ exstat:
Nec commutatur quidquam, quando omnia constat;
Vsqueadeo, variae volucres ut in ordine cunctae
Ostendunt maculas generales corpori inesse:
Immutabile materiae quoque corpus habere
Debent nimirum nam si primordia rerum
Commutari aliqua possent ratione revicta:
Incertum quoque jam constet, quid possit oriri,
Quid nequeat; finita potestas denique cuique
Qua nam sit ratione, utque alte terminus hereat;
Nec toties possent, generatim saecla refer
Naturam, motus, victum, moresque parentum.
Tum porro, quoniam extremum quojusque cacumen
Corporis est aliquod, nostri quod cernere sensus
Jam nequeant, id nimirum sine partibus exstat
Et minima constat natura: nec fuit umquam
Per se secretum, neque post hac esse valebit;
Alterius quoniam est ipsum pars: primaque and ima,
Inde aliae atque aliae similes ex ordine parts,
Agmine condenso naturam corporis explent.
Quae quoniam per se nequeunt constare; necesse est
Herere, unde queant nulla ratione revelli.
Sunt igitur solida primordia simplicitate:
Quae minimis stipata coherent partibus art,
Non ex ullorum conventu conciliata,
Sed magis aeterna pollentia simplicitate:
Vnde neque avelli quidquam, neque diminui jam
Concedit natura, reservans semina rebus.
Praeterea nisi erit minimum; parvissuma quaeque
Corpora constabunt ex partibus infinitis.
Quippe ubi dimidiae partis pars semper habebit
Dimidiam partem, nec res perfiniet ulla;
Ergo rerum inter summam minimamque quid escit?
Non erit, ut distent. nam quamvis funditus omnis
Summa sit infinita; tamen, parvissuma quae sunt,
Ex infinitis constabunt partibus aeque.
Quoi quoniam ratio reclamat vera, negatque
Credere posse animum, victus fateare necesse est
Esse ea, quae nullis jam praedita partibus exstent,
Et minima constet natura: quae quoniam sunt;
Illa quoque esse tibi solida, atque aeterna fatendum,
Denique ni minimas in partis cuncta resolvi
Cogere consuesset rerum natura creatrix;
Jam nihil ex illis eadem reparare valeret:
Propterea, quia quae multis sunt partibus aucta,
Non possunt ea; quae debet genitalis habere
Materies, varios connexus, pondera, plagas,
Concursus, motus; per quae res quaeque geruntur.
Porro si nulla est frangendis reddita finis
Corporibus, tamen ex aeterno tempore quaedam
Nunc etiam superare necesse est corpora rebus;
Quae nondum clueant ull^ tentata periclo:
At quoniam fragili natura praedita constant;
Discrepat, aeternum tempus potuisse manner
Innumerabilibus plagis vexata per aevum.
Quapropter, qui materiem rerum esse putarunt
Ignam, atque ex igni summum consistere solo:
Magnopere a vera lapsi ratione videntur:
Heraclitus init quorum dux proelia primus,
Clarus ob obscuram linguam magis inter inanes,
Quamde gravis inter Graios, qui vera requirunt.
Omnia enim St^lidi magis admirantur, amantque,
Inversis quae sub verbis latitantia cernunt;
Veraque constituunt, quae belle tangere possunt
Aures, and lepido quae sunt fucata sonore.
Nam cur tam variae res possent esse, requiro,
Ex vero si sunt igni, puroque creatae.
Nihil prodesset enim calidum denserier ignem.
Nec rarefieri, si partis ignis eandem
Naturam, quam totus habet super ignis, haberent.
Acrior ardor enim conductis partibus esset;
Languidior porro disjectis, disque supatis.
Amplius hoc fieri nihil est, quod posse rearis
Talibus in caussis: nedum variantia rerum
Tanta queat densis, rarisque ex ignibus esse.
Atque hi si faciant admistum rebus inane,
Denseri poterunt ignes, rarique relinqui:
Sed quia multa sibi cernunt contraria esse:
Et fugitant in rebus inane relinquere purum;
Ardua dum metuunt, amittunt vera viai.
Nec rursum cernunt exempto rebus inani
Omnia denseri, fierique ex omnibus unum
Corpus nihil ab se quod possit mittere raptim;
Aestifer ignis uti lumen jacit, atque vaporem:
Vt videas non e stipatis partibus esse.
Quod si forte ulla credunt ratione potesse
Ignis in coetu stingui, mutareque corpus;
Scilicet ex ulla facere id si part reporcent,
Occidet ad nihilum nimirum funditus ardor
Omnis; and ex nihilo fient quaecumque creantur.
Nam quodcumque suis mutatum finibus exit,
Continuo hoc mors est illius, quod fuit ante.
Proinde aliquid superare necesse est incolume ollis,
Ne tibi res redeant ad nihilum funditus omnes;
De nihiloque renata virescat copia rerum.
Nunc igitur, quoniam certissima corpora quaedam
Sunt, quae conservant naturam semper eandem;
Quorum abitu aut aditu, mutatoque ordine, mutant
Naturam res, and convertunt corpora sese:
Scire licet non esse haec ignea corpora rerum.
Nihil referret enim quaedam decedere, abire,
Atque alia attribui mutarique ordine quaedam,
Si tamen ardoris naturam cuncta tenerent:
Ignis enim foret omnimodis quodcumque crearet.
Verum, ut opinor, ita est: sunt quaedam corpora quoru^
Concursus, motus, ordo positura, figurae
Efficient ignis; mutatoque ordine mutant
Naturam, neque sunt igni simulata; neque ullae
Praeterea reii, quae corpora mittere possit
Sensibus; and nostros adjectu tangere tactus.
Dicere porro ignem res omnis esse, neque ullam
Rem veram in numero rerum constare, nisi ignem,
Quod facit hic idem; perdelirum esse videtur.
Nam contra sensus ab sensibus ipse repugnat:
Et labefactat eos, unde omnia credita pendent:
Vnde hic cognitus est ipsi, quem nominat ignem.
Credit enim sensus ignem cognoscere vere:
Cete^a non credit, nihilo quae clara minus sunt:
Quod mihi cum vanum, tum delirum esse videtur.
Quo referemus enim? quid nobis certius ipsis
Sensimus esse potest, quo vera, ac falsa notemus?
Praeterea quare quisquam magis omnia tollat,
Et velit ardoris naturam linquere solam;
Quam neget esse ignis, summam tamen esse relinquat?
Aequa videtur enim dementia dicere utrumque.
Quapropter qui materiem rernm esse putarunt
Ignem; atque ex igni summam consistere posse.
Et qui principium gignundis era rebus
Constituere: aut hum^rem quicumque putarunt
Fingere res ipsum per se: terramve creare
Omnia and in rerum naturas vertier omnis;
Magnopere a vero, longeque errasse videntur.
Add etiam, qui conduplicant primordia rerum,
Era jungentes igni terramque liquori:
Et qui quattuor ex rebus posse omnia rentur,
Ex igni, terra, atque anima procrescere, and imbri:
Quorum Agrigentinus comprimis Empedocles est;
Insula quem triquetris terrarum gessit in oris:
Quam fluitans circum magnis amfractibus aequor
Ionium, glaucis adspergit littus ab undis:
Angustoque fretu rapidum mare dividit undis:
Italiae terrai oras a finibus ejus.
Hic est vasta Charybdis; and hic Aetnaea minantur
Murmura flammarum rursum se conligere iras:
Faucibus eruptos iterum ut vis evomat ignis:
Ad caelumque ferant flammai folgura rursum.
Quae cum magna modis multis miranda videtur
Gentibus humanis regio, visendaque fertur,
Rebus opima bonis, multa munita virum vi:
Nihil tamen hoc habuisse viro praeclarius inse,
Nec sanctum magis, and mirum, clarumque videtur
Carmina quin etiam divini pectoris ejus
Vociferantur, and exponunt praeclara reperta:
Vt vix humana videatur stirpe creatus.
Hic tamen, and supra quos diximus, inferiores
Partibus egregie multis, multoque minores,
Quamquam multa been, ac divinitus invenientes
Ex adyto tanquam cordis responsa dedere
Sanctius, ut multo certa ratione magis, quam,
Pythia quae tripide ex Phoebi, lauroque profatur;
Principiis tamen in rerum fecere ruinas;
Et graviter magni magno cecidere ibi casu:
Primum quod motus exempto rebus inani
Constituunt; and res mollis rarasque relinquunt.
Era, solemn, ignem, terras, animalia, fruges;
Nec tamen admiscent in eorum corpus inane:
Deinde quod omnino finem non esse secandis
Corporibus faciunt, neque pausam stare fragori;
Nec prorsum in rebus minimum consistere quidqua^:
Cum videamus id extremum cujusque cacumen
Esse, quod ad sensus nostros minimum esse videtur.
Conicere ut possis ex hoc, quod cernere non quis,
Extremum quod habent, minimum consistere rebus:
Huc accedit item, quoniam primordia rerum
Mollia constituunt, quae nos nativa videmus
Esse, and mortali cum corpore funditus. atqui
Debeat ad nihilum jam rerum summa reverti;
De nihiloque renata vigescere copia rerum.
Quorum utrumque quid a vero, jam, distet, habebas.
Deinde inimica modis multis sunt, atque venena
Ipsa sibi inter se. quare aut congressa peribunt;
Aut ita diffugient, ut tempestate coorta
Fulmina diffugere, atque imbres, ventosque videmus
Denique quattuor ex rebus si cuncta creantur,
Atque in eas rursum res omnia dissoluuntur:
Qui magis illa queunt rerum primordia dici,
Quam contra res illorum, retr^que putari?
Alternis gignuntur enim mutantque colorem,
Et totam inter se naturam tempore ab omni.
Sin ita forte putas, ignis, terraeque coire
Corpus, and aerias auras, roremque liquorum,
Nihil in concilio naturam ut mutet eorum:
Nulla tibi ex illis poterit res esse creata;
Non animans; non exanimo cum corpore, ut arbos.
Quippe suam quidque in coetu variantis acervi
Naturam ostendet: mistusque videbitur aer
Cum terra simul, atque ardor cum rore manner.
At primordia gignundis in rebus oportet
Naturam clamdestinam, caecamque adhibere:
Emineat ne quid, quod contra pugnet, and obstet,
Quo minus est queat proprie quodcumque creatur.
Quin etiam repetunt a coelo, atque ignibus ejus:
Et primum faciunt ignem se vertere in auras
Aeris; hinc imbrem gigni, terramque creari
Ex imbri, retroque a terra cuncta reverti;
Humorem primum, post era, deinde calorem:
Nec cessare haec inter se mutare, meare
De caelo ad terram, de terra ad sidera mundi:
Quod facere haud ullo debent primordia pacto.
Immutabile enim quiddam superare necesse est;
Ne res ad nihilum redigantur funditus omnes.
Nam quodcumque suis mutatum finibus exit,
Continuo hoc mors est illius, quod fuit ante.
Quapropter quoniam, quae paullo diximus ante,
In commutatum veniunt; constare necesse est
Ex aliis ea, quae nequeant convertier umquam:
Ne tibi res redeant ad nihilum funditus omnes:
Quin potius tali natura praedita quaedam
Corpora constituas, ignem si sort crearint,
Posse eadem demptis paucis paucisque tributis,
Ordine mutato, and motu, facere aeris auras:
Sic alias aliis rebus mutarier omnis.
Et manifesta palam res indicat, inquis, in auras
Aeris e terra res omnis crescere alique:
Et nisi tempestas indulget tempore fausto
Imbribus, and tabe nimborum arbusta vacillant:
Solque sua pro part fovet, tribuitque calorem:
Crescere ne possint fruges, arbusta, animantes:
Scilicet and nisi nos cibus aridus, and tener humor
Adjuvat; amisso jam corpore, vita quoque omnis
Omnibus e nervis, atque ossibus exsoluatur.
Adjutamur enim dubio procul, atque alimur nos
Certis ab rebus; certis aliae atque aliae res.
Nimirum quia multa modis communia multis
Multarum rerum in rebus primordia mista
Sunt, ideo variis variae res rebus aluntur.
Atque eadem magni refert primordia saepe,
Cum quibus, and quali positura contineantur:
Et quos inter se dent motus, accipiantque.
Namque eadem coelum, mare, terras, flumina, solemn
Constituunt: eadem fruges, arbusta, animantis.
Verum aliis, alioque modo commista moventur.
Quin etiam passim nostris in versibus ipsis
Multa elementa vides multis communia verbis:
Cum tamen inter se vorsus, ac verba necesse est
Confiteare and re, and sonitu distare sonanti.
Tantum elementa queunt permutato ordine solo.
At rerum quae sunt primordia, plura adhibere
Possunt unde queant variae res quaeque creari.
Nunc and Anaxagorae scrutemur homoeomerian,
Quam Graeci memorant, nec nostra dicere lingua
Concedit nobis patrii sermonis egestas.
Sed tamen ipsam rem facile est exponere verbis,
Principium rerum quam dicit homoeomerian:
Ossa videlicet e pauxillis, atque minutis
Ossibus, sic and de pauxillis, atque minutis
Visceribus viscus gigni, sanguenque creari,
Sanguinis inter se multis coeuntibus guttis:
Ex aurique putat micis consistere posse
Aurum; and de terris terram concrescere parvis;
Ignibus ex ignem; humorem, ex humoribus esse:
Cetera consimili fingit ratione putatque.
Nec tamen esse ulla part idem in rebus inane
Concedit; neque corporibus finem esse secandis.
Quare in utraque mihi pariter ratio ne videtur
Errare, atque illi, supra quos diximus ante.
Add quod imbecilla nimis primordia fingit:
Si primordia sunt, simili quae praedita constant
Natura, atque ipsae res sunt; aequeque laborant
Et pereunt: neque ab initio res ulla refrenat.
Nam quid in oppressu valido durabit eorum,
Vt mortem effugiat, leti sub dentibus ipsis?
Ignis, an humor? an aura? quid horu^? sanguisne, an ne ^s?
Nihil, ut opinor: ubi ex aequo res funditus omnis
Tam mortalis erit, quam quae manifesta videmus
Ex oculis nostris aliqua vi victa perire.
At neque recidere ad nihilum res posse, neque autem
Crescere de nihilo, testor res ante probatas.
Praeterea quoniam cibus auget corpus, alitque;
Scire licet nobis venas, and sanguen, and ossa,
Et nervos alienigenis ex partibus esse:
Sive cibos omnis commisto corpore dicent
Esse, and habere in se nervorum corpora parva.
Ossaque, and omnino venas, partisque cruoris;
Fiet, uti cibus omnis and ardus, and liqu^r ipse,
Ex alienigenis rebus constare putetur,
Ossibus, and nervis, venisque, and sanguine misto.
Praeterea quaecumque e terra corpora crescunt,
Si sunt in terris; terras constare necesse est
Ex alienigenis, quae terris exoriuntur.
Transfer item; totidem verbis utare licebit:
In lignis si flamma latet, fumusque, cinisque:
Ex alienigenis consistant ligna, necesse est
Linquitur hic tenuis latitandi copia quaedam:
Id quod Anaxagoras sibi sumit, ut omnibus omnis
Res putet immistas rebus latitare; sed illud
Apparere unum, cujus sint pluria mista,
Et magis in promptu, primaque in front locata:
Quod tamen a vera long ratione repulsum est.
Conveniebat enim fruges quoque saepe minutas,
Robore cum saxi franguntur, mittere signum
Sanguinis: aut aliquid, nostra quo corpora aluntur,
Cum lapidi lapidem terimus, manare cruorem.
Consimili ratione herbas quoque saepe decebat,
Et latices dulcis guttas, similique sapore
Mittere, lanigerae quali sunt ubera lactis:
Scilicet and glebis terrarum saepe friatis
Herbarum genera, and fruges, frundesque videri
Dispertita, ac in terris latitare minute:
Postremo in lignis, cinerem, fumumque videri,
Cum praefracta forent, ignisque latere minutos:
Quorum nihil fieri quoniam manifesta docet res;
Scire licet non esse in rebus res ita mistas:
Verum semina multimodis immista latere
Multarum rerum in rebus communia debent.
At saepe in magnis fit montibus, (inquis) ut altis
Arboribus vicina cacumina summa terantur
Inter se, validis facere id cogentibus austris;
Donec fiammai fulserunt flore coorto,
Scilicet and non est lignis tamen insitus ignis;
Verum semina sunt ardoris multa: terendo
Quae cum confluxere, creant incendia silvis.
Quod si tanta foret silvis abscondita flamma:
Non possent ullum tempus celarier ignes:
Conficerent volgo silvas, arbusta cremarent.
Jam ne vides igitur, paull^ quod diximus ante,
Permagni refer eadem primordia saepe,
Cum quibus, and quali positura contineantur;
Et quos inter se dent motus, accipiantque?
Atque eadem paullo inter se mutata creare
Ignis e lignis? quo pacto verba quoque ipsa
Inter se paullo mutatis sunt elementis,
Cum ligna, atque ignis distincta voce notemus.
Denique jam quaecumque in rebus cernis apertis,
Si fieri non posse putas, quin materai
Corpora consimili natura praedita fingas:
Hae ratione tibi pereunt primordia rerum:
Fiet, uti risu tremulo concussa cachinnent,
Et lachrumis salsis humectent ora, genasque.
Nunc age, quod superest, cognosce and clarius audi.
Nec me animi fallit, quam sint obscura: sed acri
Percussit thyrso laudis spes magna meum cor:
Et simul incussit suavem mi in pectus amorem
Musarum; quo nunc instinctus, mente vigenti
Avia Pieridum peragro loca, nullius ante
Trita solo: juvat integros accedere fontis,
Atque haurire: juvatque novos decerpere flores;
Insignemque meo capiti petere inde coronam,
Vnde prius nulli velarint tempora Musae:
Primum quod magnis doceo de rebus; and artis
Relligionum animos nodis exsolvere porgo:
Deinde quod obscura de re tam lucida pango
Carmina, musaeo continguens cuncta lepore.
Id quoque enim non ab nulla ratione videtur:
Sed veluti pueris absynthia tetra medentes
Cum dare conantur, prius oras pocula circum
Continguunt mellis dulci flavoque liquore,
Vt puerorum aetas improvida ludificetur
Labrorum tenus; interea perpotet amarum
Absynth* laticem, deceptaque non capiatur,
Sed potius tali facto recreata valescat:
Sic ego nunc, quoniam haec ratio plerumque videtur
Tristior esse, quibus non est tractata; retroque
Volgus abhorret ab hac; volui tibi suaviloquenti
Carmine Pierio rationem exponere nostram;
Et quasi muoseo, dulci continguere melle:
Si tibi forte animum tali ratione tenere
Versibus in nostris possem: dum perspicis omnem
Naturam rerum, qua constet compta figura.
Sed quoniam docui solidissima materiai
Corpora perpetuo volitare invicta per aevum:
Nunc age summai ecquaenam sit finis eorum,
Nec sit, evolvamus: item, quod inane repertum est,
Seu locus, ac spatium, res in quo quaeque gerantur,
Pervideamus utrum finitum funditus omne
Constet; an immensum pateat vel adusque profundu^.
Omne quod est igitur nulla regione viarum
Finitum est: namque extremum debebat habere.
Extremum porro nullius posse videtur
Esse, nisi ultra sit, quod finiat: ut videatur,
Quo non longius haec sensus natura sequatur:
Nunc, extra summam quoniam nihil esse fatendu^ est,
Non habet extremum: caret ergo fine, modoque.
Nec refert quibus adsistas regionibus ejus.
Vsqueadeo quem quisque locum possedit, in omnis
Tantumdem partis infinitum omne relinqui^.
Praeterea, si jam finitum constituatur
Omne quod est spatium: si quis procurrat ad orat
Vltimus extremas, jaciatque volatile telum;
Invalidis utrum contortum viribus ire,
Quo fuerit missum mavis, longeque volare:
An prohibere aliquid censes, obstareque posse?
Alter utrum fatearis enim, sumasque necesse est;
Quorum utrumque tibi effugium praecludit, and omne,
Cogit, ut exempta concedas fine patere.
Nam sive est aliquid, quod prohibeat, officiatque,
Quo minus, quo missum est, veniat, finique locet se;
Sive for as fertur: non est ea finis profecto:
Hoc pacto sequar, atque oras ubicumque locaris
Extremas, quaeram, quid telo denique fiat.
Fiet, uti nusquam possit consistere finis;
Effugiumque fugae prolatet copia semper.
Praeterea, spatium summai totius omne
Vndique si inclusum certis consisteret oris,
Finitumque foret; jam copia materiai
Vndique ponderibus solidis confluxet ad imum:
Nec res ulla geri sub caeli tegmine posset:
Nec foret omnino caelum, neque lumina solis;
Quippe ubi materies omnis cumulata jaceret
Ex infinito jam tempore subsidendo.
At nunc nimirum requies data principiorum
Corporibus nulla est quia nihil est funditus imum,
Quo quasi confluere, and seeds ubi ponere possint:
Semper and assiduo motu res quaeque geruntur
Partibus in cunctis, aeternaque suppeditantur
Ex infinito cita corpora materiai.
Postremo ante oculos rem res finire videtur:
Aer dissepit collis, atque era montes.
Terra mare, and contra mare terras terminat omnis.
Omne quidem vero nihil est quod finiat, extra.
Est igitur natura lo^i, spatiumque profundi;
Quod neque claraesuo precurrere fluminae cursu
Perpeti^o possint aevi labentia tractu:
Nec prorsum facere, ut restet minus ire meando
Vsqueadeo passim patet ingens copia rebus
Finibus exemptis in cunctas undique partis.
Ipsa modum porro sibi rerum summa parare
Ne possit natura tenet: quia corpus inani,
Et quod inane autem est, finiri corpore cogit:
Vt sic alternis infinita omnia reddat.
Aut etiam, alterutrum nisi terminet alterum eoru^,
Simplice natura pateat tamen immoderatum:
Nec mare, nec tellus, nec caeli lucida templa,
Nec mortale genus, nec divum corpora sancta
Exiguum possent horai, sistere tempus.
Nam dispulsa sue de coetu materiai
Copia ferretur magnum per inane soluta:
Sive adeo potius numquam concreta creasset
Vllam rem, quoniam cogi disjecta nequisset.
Nam certe neque concilio primordia rerum
Ordine se quaeque, atque sagaci mente locarunt:
Nec quos quaeque darent motus pepigere profecto:
Sed quia multa modis multis mutataper omne
Ex infinito vexantur percita plagis,
Omne genus motus, and coetus experiundo;
Tandem deveniunt in talis disposituras;
Qualibus haec rebus consistit summa creata:
Et multos etiam magnos servata per annos,
Vt semel in motus conjecta est convenientis,
Efficit, ut largis avidum mare fluminis undis
Integrent amnes, and solis terra vapore
Fota novet fetus, summissaque gens animantum
Floreat, and vivant labentes aetheris ignes.
Quod nullo facerent pacto, nisi materiai
Ex infinito suboriri copia posset,
Vnde amissa solent reparari in tempore quoque.
Nam veluti privata cibo natura animantum
Diffluit amittens corpus: sic omnia debent
Dissolvi, simul ac defecit suppeditare
Materies resta regione aversa viai.
Nec plagae possent intrinsecus undique summam
Conservare omnem, quaecumque est conciliata.
Cudere enim crebro possunt, partemque morari,
Dum veniant aliae, ac suppleri summa queatur:
Interdum resilire tamen coguntur and una
Principiis rerum spatium, tempusque fugai
Largiri, ut possint a coetu libera ferri.
Quare etiam atque etiam suboriri multa necesse est.
Et tamen ut plagae quoque possint suppetere ipsae,
Infinita opus est vis undique materiai.
Illud in his rebus long fuge credere, Memmi,
In medium summae quod dicunt omnia niti,
Atque ideo mundi naturam stare sine ullis
Ictibus externis; neque quoquam posse resolvi
Summa atque ima, quod in medium sint omnia nixa;
(Ipsum si quidquam posse in se sistere credis)
Et quae pondera sunt sub terris, omnia sursum
Nitier, in terramque retro requiescere posta:
Vt per aquas quae nunc rerum simulacra videmus.
Et simili ratione animalia subtus vagari
Contendunt neque posse e terris in loca caeli
Recidere inferiora magis, quam corpora nostra
Sponte sua possint in caeli templa volare:
Illi cum videant solemn, nos sidera noctis
Cernere, and alternis nobiscum tempora caeli
Dividere, and noctes parilis agitare diebus.
Sed vanus stolidis haec omnia finxerit error;
Amplexi quod habent perverse prima viai:
Nam medium nihil esse potest, ubi inane, locusque
Infinita: neque omnino, si jam medium sit,
Possit ibi quidquam hac potius consistere caussa,
Quam quavis alia long regione manner.
Omnis enim locus, ac spatium, quod inane vocamus,
Per medium, per non medium concedat oportet
Aeque ponderibus, motus quacumque feruntur,
Nec quisquam locus est, quo corpora cum venere,
Ponderis amissa vi possint stare inani.
Nec quod inane autem est, illis subsistere debet,
Quin, sua quod natura petit, concedere pergat.
Haud igitur possunt tali ratione teneri
Res in concilio medii cuppedine victae.
Praeterea, quoniam non omnia corpora fingunt
In medium niti, sed terrarum atque liquoris,
Humorem ponti magnisque e montibus undas,
Et quasi terreno quae corpora contineantur:
At contra tenuis exponunt aeris auras,
Et calidos simul a medio differrier ignis,
Atque ideo totum circumtremere aethera signis;
Et solis flammam per caeli caerula pasci,
Quod calor a medio fugiens ibi conligat ignis:
Quippe etiam vesci e terra mortalia saecla;
Nec prorsum arboribus summos frundescere ramos
Posse, nisi a terris paullatim quodque cibatur.
Ne volucrum ritu flammarum, moenia mundi
Diffugiant subito magnum per inane soluta.
Et ne cetera consimili ratione sequantur:
Neve ruant caeli tonitralia templa superne,
Terraque se pedibus raptim subducat, and omnes
Inter permixtas terrae, caelique ruinas
Corpora solventes, abeant per inane profundum;
Temporis ut puncto nihil extat relliquiarum,
Desertum praeter spatium, and primordia caeca:
Nam quacumque prius de parti corpora cesse
Constitues, haec rebus erit pars janua leti:
Hac se turba for as dabit omnis materiai.
Haec si pernosces parva perductus opella;
(Namque aliud ex alio clarescet,) non tibi caeca
Nox iter eripiet, quin ultima naturai
Pervideas. Ita res accendunt lumina rebus.

AN ESSAY On the First Book of T. LVCRETIVS CARVS DE RERUM NATURA.
Lib. I.
ROMES Parent Venus, joy of Gods above
And Men, who under those bright signs that move
In heaven, do all comfort bring and mirth
To the ship-bearing Seas, Corn-bearing Earth;
By thee conceived since all things living be
Beholding the Suns light, the Winds do flee
O Goddess, and the clouds which skies benight
Are dissipated, when thou come in sight
Smooth seas and heavens smile; under thy feet
Th'inamel'd earth does her sweet flowers submit;
For when the Springs return brings the clear day
And Genial West with kindly gales does play,
First aerie birds, whose breast thy powrdoth touch
Chant forth ( o Goddess) thee and thine approach:
Then savage Bruits jump ore the flowery meads,
Or take the streams, where ere thy beauty leads,
Each Creature does with eager passion go;
Lastly, through Seas, and Hills, where Rivers flow
With rapid course; or where the Birds do build
Their leafie roosts, and through the verdant field,
Soft flames thou do in every breast infuse;
So a fresh Offspring still the Age renews.
Since then ore Nature thou sole Queen do reign,
Nor ought without thee may the light attain,
Or can be frolic, or be pleasant made;
Assist these studious numbers with thine aid,
Which I essay of Natures works to tell
For honored Memmius, who does most excel
By thee accomplished; Goddess, O bestow
Eternal grace on what from me shall flow,
That whilst I write, by Seas and land may cease
Fire Wars closed in an everlasting peace:
To Mortals thou alone can rest afford;
Since Mars, who is of direful wars, the Lord,
On thy fair Bosom resting often his head
With lasting wounds of Love is vanquished,
And bending his round neck which on thee lies,
With greedy passion feeds his amorous eyes;
Whilst on thy lips his fainting soul is plac'^,
And he within those sacred arms enchac'^;
Let charming accents thy sweet lips i^spi^e,
And for sad Rome an happy peace require;
For whilst our Country thus afflicted lies,
With what content oan we Philosophize!
Nor may brave Memmius then wanting be
To th'Publike peace in such perplexity.
Then Memmius it remains, that free from care,
To sound discourse thou lend a willing ear,
Nor let my gift framed out of just respect
Ere understood be answered with neglect:
For I of Gods and Heaven will discourse (source,
And show whence all things else derive their
Whence Nature does create, augment, and cherish
To what again resolve them when they perish.
What things in our discourse we Matter call,
Prolis^que bodies, and the seeds of all.
Or if such terms do not the things comprise,
Prime Bodies name them, whence all other rise.
Gods in their nature of themselves subsist
It Is certain, nor may ought their peace molest
For ever, unconcerned with our affairs
And far remote, void of or grief or cares,
Need not our service, swim in full content,
Nor our good works accept, nor bad resent:
Whilst sometimes human life dejected lay
On earth, under gross superstitions sway,
Whose head aloft from heaven seemed t'appear
And mankind with its horrid shape did scare,
With mortal eyes to look on her that durst
Or contradict; a Grecian was the first:
Him nor the fame of gods, nor lightnings flash,
Nor threatening bruit of thundering Skies could dash,
But rather did his courage elevate,
Natures remotest doors to penetrate;
Thus did he with his vigorous wit transpierce
The flaming limits of the Universe.
All that was great his generous soul had viewed,
Whence what could be produced, what not be showed
And how each finite thing has bounds, nor may
By any means from her fixed limits stray:
Wherefore fond Superstition trampled lies
Beneath; we rear our Trophies to the Skies.
Yet fear I least thou think my Arguments
Should lead you into impious rudiments,
When as Religion it self, often times
Has perpetrated foul and bloody crimes.
Thus when the Grecian chief's of prime repute
The unwed Trivian Altar did pollute
With Iphigenias blood at Aulis, where,
When as the Chaplet round her Virgin-hair
Dischevel'd down her Cheeks on either side,
She near the Altar, her sad Father spied,
And from his eyes the Priests the Knife to keep,
Whilst all the people round about her weep:
She mute with fear, kneeling, the Earth does press,
Nor did her Birth avail in that distress,
Or that the King first she a Father made,
But to the Altar, trembling was conveyed;
Not so, as when in Hymen's solemn rites
The Bride is led to Nuptial delights,
But ripe for marriage she pure Sacrifice,
By her sad Sires consent, impurely dies,
That a safe Expedition might be made,
To so much ill could foolish Zeal persuade!
Thy self (so long) with Poets frightful lies
O'rcome, wilt our opinions soon despise.
How many dreams yet could I to thee fain
Sufficient to confound thy very Brain.
And all the enjoyments with vain fear offend;
And well; for did men think their woes had end,
After a sort perhaps resist they might
Poetique Threats, and Superstitions fright.
But now in vain alas! no help remains
Since after death they dread eternal pains:
For in this ignorance men live amused
Whether the Soul be born, or else infused
They know not, or expiring with our breat^,
Visits those Lakes, and gloomy shades beneath*
Or else into some Beasts does transmigrate
As learned Ennius has sung of late,
The first among the Latins ere put on
A never dying crown from Helicon;
Whose luster never Mortal did excel:
Though this man does in lasting numbers tell
On Acherontian banks, what Temples stand,
Where nor our Souls nor Bodies ever land,
But some pale frightful Spectrum, like to that
Which he of Homer does commemorate,
Whose Ghost dissolved in briny tears came in
And to interpre^ Nature did begin,
This so, we will first inquire of things above,
The Reasons how the ^un and Moon do move:
By what force all things on the earth are swayed
With strict enquiry, first each reason weighed.
The Nature of the Soul wherein the mind
Consists, and what it is we waking find
So terrifies our thoughts, whether diseased,
Or when dead sleep our faculties has seized,
So that we seem to hear, and see the faces
Of those whose buried bones cold earth embraces.
In Latin verse, it is hard I must confess
The Greeks obscure conceptions to express:
And principally, since there is so much
New terms requires, the novelty being such
Of The Matter, of our Tongue the poverty,
But yet thy worth, and the felicity
I find in thy sweet Friendship me persuade
Cold nights to watch, and through all dangers wade
What numbers, and expressions I may find,
Which may clear lights present unto thy mind,
By whose bright rays thou may both speculate
Nature, and her deep secrets penetrate.
Dark fears of mind, then banish quite away,
Not with the Sunbeams, or the light of day,
But by such species, as from Nature flow,
And what from right informed reason grow;
Which unto us this principle does frame,
That Out of nothing, nothing ever came.
It Is only thus, That men are awed with fear,
Because such things in Heaven and Earth appear,
Of which, since they a reason cannot find
To a celestial Author they are assigned.
But when we find that naught of naught can be,
What we pursue, we shall more clearly see,
And show, whence all things first produced were,
And yet the gods still unconcerned are;
For, if of Nothing formed, no use of Seed,
Since every sort would from all things proceed.
Men from the liquid Seas might then arise,
Fishes and Fowl, from Earth; Beasts from the Skies,
And other Cattle; Bruits uncertain birth
Would fill the w^ste, and cultivated earth.
Nor could from the same trees the same fruit spring
But al would change, and all things all would bring.
For were not Bodies seminal to each kind,
How should we then a certain Mother find
Legitimate? since then from certain seeds
Each thing results, and naturally proceeds,
Where proper matter, and first bodies grow
From thence, and thus produced their essence show.
Therefore from All things All things cannot rise,
Since certain things have distinct faculties.
Whence is it we see the Rose in Spring, the Corn
In Summer, and ripe Grapes in Autumn born?
But that of every thing the constant seed
Concurring with the time in which they breed,
What ere's engendered in due season grows,
When the quick Earth her tender offspring shows.
Things made of nothing, would at once appear
In doubtful space, and unfit times of the year;
Because there would no Principles remain
Which at improper times might them restrain
From Generation, nor yet would there need
(If things of nothing grew) a space for seed.
Then Infants presently Young Men would be,
And from the Earth, the Shrub, as soon a Tree;
Which cannot be it is plain, since every thing
So slowly from it is proper seeds does spring,
And rising do their kinds preserve to show
How of their matter nourished they grow.
So that unless some Annual showers descend,
The Earth no fruits to human use can lend,
Nor Animals would propagate their kind,
Or live, unless due nourishment they find:
Then rather think, that many Bodies be
Common to many things, even as we see
To Words their Elements, never surmise
Any without their Principles can rise.
In fine, why has not Nature Mankind made
So huge, that he on foot through Seas might wade
Whole Mountains with his monstrous hand displace,
And sundry Ages in long life surpass;
Unless to the production of all things
There need a certain matter whence it springs?
Of Nothing then Nothing we must conclude
Results; but each thing is with seed indu'de,
From which all that is created comes to light
And clearly manifest themselves to sight.
Since then rich fields surpass the barren ground,
Which culture makes in choycer fruits abound,
We well perceive the causes of each thing,
How they result, and from Earths bowels spring,
As often as we turn up the Soil, and tear
The Gleabe with Spades, or with the crooked Share;
Else should you see Nature would still produce
Things of her own accord, and better use.
Add unto this, Nature to their first state
Does all dissolve, nothing annihilate,
For if in all parts any thing could fail,
Death over all things would in time prevail;
Nor needed there a force to discompose
Their parts, or their strict union unloose:
But since in all eternal Seeds reside.
Till such a blow it meets, which it divides
Or else dissolves by subtle Penetration,
Nature preserves it whole from dissipation.
Beside what things are with their ages past,
If time did kill, and all their matter waste
Whence does sweet Venus give to souls new birth
Through all their kinds? how should the various earth
Augment each kind with proper diet fed?
Whence flow the Seas? whence have free Springs their head?
Whence do the far extended Rivers rise?
And Stars, how are they nourished in the Skies?
Since length of times, and days so many past,
All mortal bodies had ere this defaced.
If then from that large tract, ought has remained
From whence the sum of things has been maintained
Sure an immortal nature does inspire
Them, nor can any thing to naught retire:
All from like force and cause dissolved would be,
Did not eternal matter keep it free:
And more or less them to their subjects bind,
One touch to them a cause of death they would find.
Had bodies no eternal permanence,
They would dissolve with the least violence:
But since the bands of various causes are
(Though matter permanent) dissimilar,
Bodies of things are safe 'till they receive
A force which may their proper thread unweave,
Naught then returns to naught, but pa^^ed falls
To Bodies of their prime Originals.
Those showers which Heaven Father-like does send
Down on our mother Earth there seem to end,
Yet thence delicious fruits from trees enlarge,
And the fresh branches with their burden charge:
Hence she mankind and animals does nourish,
And hence with numerous children Cities flourish
Hence the thick Groves with new fledged birds resound
And fat Herds rest their limbs on fertile ground,
Hence pure milk from distended teats distills,
And late fallen Young warmed with sweet suck it fills,
Who frisking over the Meadows as they pass
Frolic their feeble limbs on tender grass;
Then nothing sure its being quite forsakes,
Since Nature one thing, from another makes;
Nor is there ought indeed which she supplies
Without the aid of something else that dies.
Since then I teach that naught of nothing breeds,
Or once produced, to naught again recedes.
Least yet thou should my Arguments diffide
Because that Elements cannot be spied
By humane eyes; behold what bodies now
In things thou can not see, yet must allow.
First, mighty Winds, the rolling Seas incite,
Huge Vessels wrack, and put the clouds to flight;
Rushing through fields, sometimes tall trees they crack;
And with their tearing blasts high mountains shake
The Seas likewise in thundering billows rise
And with their raging murmur threat the Skies.
Winds therefore unseen bodies are, which sweep
The fleeting clouds, the Earth, the Azure deep,
Bearing with sudden storm all things away,
Yet thus proceeding, do they naught destroy
Other then as the yielding water flows,
Augmented by large showers, or melted snows rend
Which from deep clifts in Cataracts descend,
Whole trees they float, and prostrate woods they
Nor can strong Bridges their approach sustain,
Whose rapid torrent does all check disdain.
The River with immoderate showers repleat,
Against their Piles impetuously does beat:
Roaring it ruins, huge stones along it rowles,
All things it spoils, and nothing it controles.
Even so the gusts of sturdy winds do tend
Like swiftest Rivers when they downwards bend,
And carry all before with double might,
Sometimes they snatch, and hurry things upright
In rapid whirle, Therefore I add again
The Winds are Bodies, and yet are not seen.
Since their eff^cts, and motions every where
Like Rivers be, whose bodies do appear,
Besides, of things we smell the various sents,
Which yet no substance to our sight presents;
We with our eyes see neither Heat nor Cold,
Nor can we any Voices sound behold
Which of Corporeal nature yet consist,
For they the Sense affect it is manifest.
Touch and be touched, naught save a body may:
Clothes become moist, which we on shoars display;
Spread in the Sun, again, they dry appear:
But neither how that humor entered there
Can we perceive: nor by what means it flies
The heat so soon, and consequently dries.
Therefore that which is humid separates
By minute parts, which no eye penetrates:
Thus at the bare return of sundry years
The Ring which one upon his finger wears
Diminishes: Drops which do often distill,
Hollow hard stones; And whilst the field we till,
The Coulter of the Plough is lessened:
And paved ways, whereon the people tread
Wear out we see: Brass Statues at our gates
Show their right hand, which frequent tonch abates
Of such as visit often, or pass the way;
Therefore things often worn the more decay:
But in each time, what bodies do discar'd
Is a fine sight from our gross eyes debarred?
Lastly, what Nature by minute degrees
And time applies, our sharpest eyesight flees;
Nor what through age or leanness does decay,
Nor what from rocks at Sea time frets a way
With gnawing salt consumed, do we espy:
Nature with bodies then unseen to the eye
All things does manage; not that I suppose
Nature with Bodies does each thing enclose
On every side, for there is a Void in things
Which rightly to conceive, much profit brings:
Nor will it suffer thee to err, or doubt,
Or our assertions slight in finding out
The sum of things, therefore there is a place
Intangible, and void: else in no case
Could ought be moved; for Bodies which resist
And naturally stop, would all molest,
And each thing would be at a certain stay
Because it could not to the next give way.
But now through Seas, on Earth, in lofty Skies
We many things contemplate with our eyes
Move various ways, which if no void you grant,
Would not so much, their proper motion want
As they by no means e're could have been made:
For matter blocked up on all sides had stayed.
Now though things seem as if condensed they were,
Yet there is good Argument to think them rare;
Since through the Rocks and Caves moist humor slides,
And in abundant drops the water glides,
Through each thing living alimental juice
Extends, shrubs grow, and fruit in time produce.
Because the sap drawn from the root it spreads
Into the Trunk, and through the branches sheads.
Thus Voices through closed Walls insinuate,
And rigid cold, the hard bones penetrate.
Whereas a Void denied, you will never define
How Bodies can a Thorow-fare assign.
Whence is it some things others out weigh we see,
Whilst they in bulk, and figure both agree?
If in a Ball of Yarn, the substance were
Equal with Lead, like weight it ought to bear:
Since Bodies do by nature downwards fall,
Whilst (contrary) Void has no weight at all.
When things of equal size much lighter are,
It Is cause the Void contained is greater far.
But that which does exc^ed in heaviness
More Body has, and less of emptiness.
Therefore there is, that which our reason shows,
A mixed void, which all things does enclose.
Least this from truth seduce thee, as is feigned
By some, to antedate I am constrained.
That Waters yield to shoving fish (say they)
When gliding through they cut the liquid way;
Because as they advance, they leave behind
A place, to which receding waves may wind.
That ought can move, if all the world be full
Is an opinion which does sense annul.
For how could fishes move from place to place,
Unless the yielding waters gave them space.
Or how returning are the waters mixed
If all the fish immovable are fixed?
Then either we to Bodies must allow
No motion, or mixed Vaccum avow
Scattered through all the parts, from whence each thing
Does its first Principle of motion bring.
Lastly, let two large Bodies in carrier
Strike and recoyle, Air needs must take up here
All that wide space of Room that lies between,
But this successively must enter in:
For though with a swift blast it flow about,
Yet fills it not at once, the space throughout:
For first, the first place must be filled, the rest
Immediately will after be possessed.
If any now think when the Body cleaves
That then the air's condensed, he much deceives
Himself; for then a void must needs ensue
Where there was none, and that be filled anew
Which empty was, nor can Air thus condense:
Or, if it did, could you with Void dispense;
Might it contract it self; nor into one
Unite its parts by Penetration.
Much you may cavil here, but still must come
To this at last, There is a Vacuum.
And now more Arguments might I produce
Which would to our assertions much conduce,
But these may well suffice a studious mind,
By which the rest thou shall most surely find;
For like as Dogs draw to thick coverts where
The Mountain beast is couched within the Lair,
When once they are in train, even so one thing
Thou from another may in order bring;
Peircing the hidden Cells which do conceal
The Truth, and thence the verity reveal.
Set but thy self to it Memmius, and pursue
The way, I Am confident you will find it true;
Whilst my sweet tongue, from my rich bosom brings,
Such copious draughts, pout'd out from ample springs,
That I may fear least creeping age prevent
My feeble life, ere I the Argument.
On each particular in Verse explain.
But now repeat we what was said again:
Nature as of her self two things implies,
A void and solid Corporieties;
The things in place, and places where they move,
That there is Body Common sense does prove;
On which unless the first opinion found,
We shall in things occult but hardly ground
A judgment rational; for where is no room
That empty is, there can no bodies come:
Or could they ever by each other move
As we have plainly showed to thee above.
Things from all Bodies utterly dis-joyn'd
And separate from Void you none will find;
As if in Nature a third Entitie
There should be; for something it ought to be
If once it do exist, be it great or small,
Or capable of the least touch at all
How slight so ere it be, it must needs come
Into the list of Bodies, and their sum.
But if intangible the sid^s be all,
Hindering no passage, That we Vacuum call.
Besides, whatever of it self depends
Is always doing; or else to other lends
Subject to act on, or '^is so ordained
Things may in it be moved and sustained:
But act and suffer naught save Bodies may,
Nor any thing save Void give place or way;
Therefore besides those two no Third can rest
To strike our sense, or sink into our breast.
For each apparent thing this you will find
Either to one of these two things is joined,
Or else they only are the pure events
Of them, or in some kind their consequents,
Now that's conjoined which one can truly never
Without the ruin of the subject sever.
As Water's wet, Earth heavy, Fire is hot:
So Bodies may be touched and Vacuum not.
On the other side, Subjection, Freedom, War,
Peace, Riches, Poverty; be they what ere.
With, and without which, Nature's still entire.
These justly of Events the name acquire.
Nor is Time of it self, but from the things
Results a sense what every age forth brings:
For present, past, or future, it is confessed
Without things motion, and convenient rest,
Can never of themselves discerned be
By any sensible capacity.
Let Us therefore see (in fine) how men have sed
That Troy was sacked, and Helen ravished;
Least such expressions us perchance constrain
To yield they yet in Essence do remain;
When that whole race of men, from whom alone
Flowed these events, is long since past and gone.
What Action then so ere we understand,
Call it the Event of such a Thing, or Land;
Lastly, were Matter from all things abstracted,
Nor space, or place wherein they each were acted,
No such things ere had been, that Paris breast
Had (with the fire of Helens love possessed)
Kindled a War for bloody Bittel's famed,
Nor had the wooden horse Troys Towers inflamed
Of them not once suspected, by a slight,
With disembowel'd Greeks in dead of night:
That Actions done then it is manifest,
Do not like Bodies of themselves subsist;
Nor yet as Vacuums themselves present,
But rather such as we must call event
Of Bodies, and of place, by which and where
Such Actions and such Things performed were.
Bodies are either Principles of things,
Or such as from their adjunation springs;
But Elements no strokes can violate,
Their solid bodies dos all force rebate,
Although it may not over easy seem
In Nature any solid to esteem:
For Lightning often our thickest walls strikes through;
Voices and Cries; Iron in fire does glow,
The stony rock with fervent vapor cleaves,
And rigid gold fusion in heat receives;
And brass congealed melts i'ch' flame; both cold
And heat the silver pierce; as when we hold
A Mazor in our hands one both perceives,
When powered aloft it a moist dew receives;
So that no solid seems in things to be:
But since the certain cause and true decree
Of Nature calls on us, a while give ear,
We in few lines will this assertion clear,
That of a solid, and eternal frame
Bodies there be which Principles we name,
And seeds of things, from whence the total sum
And mass of all created being^ come.
Since of two things, two Natu^es then we see,
Which no way in their properties agree
Bodies, and place, which does all motions bear
Each do subsist and uncompounded are.
For wherefoere of Room, Empty is said,
No Body is, again where ever's laid
A Body, is no void: firm therefore be
Prime Bodies, and from empty spaces free.
But since in things there is a void confessed,
'Bout solid matter it must surely rest:
Nor can it by right reason be supposed
That Void is hid in Bodies, or enclosed,
Unless you grant, what must in Justice follow,
Those Bodies solid are which hold the hollow,
And they be naught else, but that firm composed
Matter, in which this Vacuum is enclosed,
Matter then which confists in solid may
Be permanent, though all things else decay.
Besides did naught a Vacuum contain
All would be solid, and did not again.
Some real Bodies stand which fill up Places,
All were mere emptiness where now are spaces
Alternatly, then we must grant there be
Bodies distinct, and a vacuitie.
Since then nor all is full, nor empty space,
Some Bodies are that garnish every place.
These nor by blows extern can wronged be,
Nor riveted between asunder flee;
Nor by what ere effort attaqu'd will ^lide,
That which above to you we justified:
For broken, cut in two, or once annoyed
Could nothing be, unless there were a Void:
Nor wet, nor cold admit, nor fires keen ray,
Which through all Concrete bodies makes his way:
And how much more things do include a void,
By these assailed, they sooner are destroyed.
If (as I taught) then Principles are free
From void, they likewise must eternal be.
Besides, had matter not for ever been,
We had long since all things reduced seen:
But (as we showed) Naught can of Nothing be,
Nor being once, revert to Nullitie.
Bodies immortal, Principles require,
To which all compounds may at last retire,
That there may matter be for things supply*
Then Principles have pure soliditie;
Nor may we else conceive ought lastinglie,
Can for eternal reparation be.
Did Nature when she does in pieces take
Things, to her self no Bounds nor Limits make,
Matter ere this, had been so near reduced
To their first cause, as naught could be produced
That e're would have attained perfectly
To their full age, and due maturity:
For things much sooner perish, then attain
( Being once dissolved) to be repaired again:
Wherefore long tract of time, which did expose
Their naked bodies to eternal blows.
Could not in a large space repair anew
What it so long together overthrew,
But now to such destruction it is most plain
Limits are fixed, since they are restored again;
And to all sort of things Times set, in which
They may attain their ages perfect pitch.
Again, though matter be most solid taught,
Yet concret's may nevertheless be Soft:
So Air, Earth, Water; so are Vapors bred,
By what e're power, and how engendered;
Since void to mix in things we entertain.
But if the Principles were soft again,
How Flints, and Iron harden, could be found
No cause, since Nature then would want a ground.
Bodies then simply solid, we suppose,
Which more condensed can render all things close*
And being thus together more compact,
Are thence indu'd with greater power to act.
Lastly, since Nature to each thing does give
A bound and term, wherein they grow and live:
Since it is decreed what each thing can advance
And do; what not, by the same ordinance,
Yet nothing change, but all things still remain,
Hence Birds with proper spots their plumage stain
To their own Family, from whence we see
Bodies unchanged in their matter be.
Could Principles of things be altered
Or by corruption once be vanquished,
Then were it also an uncertain thing
What had the power, and what had not to spring.
How the activity of things is bounded,
And how their force with limits is surrounded:
Nor would successions always be inclined
To live, move, feed, and do after their kind.
Moreover, each Bodies extremity
Being something which the sharpest sense does fly,
In such a point of matter does consist
Without all parts, that it had never the least
Division; nor can, since what we name
The first, or last, in bodies, is the same:
Hence, similar parts one by another still
Drawn up in order Bodies nature fill;
Which since they cannot of themselves subsist,
They must of force one with another twist;
Whence no divorce is, then first bodies be
Of a most pure solid simplicity.
Which Pact in minute parts in one combined,
Nor by the access of other things conjoined
Are of eternal simple purity,
Nature not suffering them at all to be
Diminished or dissolved, but does reserve
Them for a seed perpetual to serve.
Unless you grant a least, the smallest mite
Of Body would admit parts infinite.
For if one part of half does yet pretend
An half part still, of things would be no end:
Which being so, what difference would there be
Betwixt the least and greatest quantity?
Were infinite the sum of things, the least
Would then of parts as infinite consist.
Which since, nor sense, nor judgment does allow
To think, then vanquished, you must avow
Such are, as of no parts compounded be,
And the least magnitudes; then must agree
They Are solid and Eternal. Now suppose
Nature from whence all things created rose,
Did not each thing into least pieces take,
She never could anew the same things make:
Since things of many parts made up can not
Admit those qualities we must allot
To matter that is generative; as thus,
Poize, Concourse, Stroke, Connection various,
Motion which manage all in Natures round.
Besides, admit, there were at all no bound
To Bodies dissolution, yet it is sure
Some Bodies from eternity endure:
But since that a frail nature they retain,
It contradicts they always should remain
And vexed, midst so many strokes subsist,
Which them uncessantly do thus molest.
More wide are they from reason that suppose
Fire the first matter from whence all things rose,
And that of fire consisted the whole mass,
Of these the Captain Heraclitus was.
Cried up for's dark expressions by the light
Not sober Greeks, such as in Truth delight.
For fools t'admire and love are most inclined,
What lurking midst obscurest terms they find;
And only hold for truth what accents quaint
Strike the pleased ear, and which trim phrase does paint.
But how things can thus differ, I enquire
If they proceed from pure and real fire,
For it would naught avail condensed or rare,
If every part of the same nature were
With the whole fire; for the united heat
Of Ignite parts, would be more fierce and great,
And it again would be as much abated
And languish, if they were once separated.
But more then this, you nothing can expect
Which should in the like causes have effect,
Nor is it Fire condensed, or rare which brings
In nature such variety of things,
Though would they grant, that there a Vacuum were,
Then Fire indeed might be or Dense or Rare:
But since who none admit do plainly see
Themselves gainsaid with contrariety,
And a pure Emptiness in things oppose,
Whilst they the hard way fear, the right they lose,
Not seeing how without vacuitie
All things would dense, and but one Body be;
Which of it self could not project aright,
As glowing Fire darts forth the smoke and light:
So that from hence you clearly may enact,
It Is not of solid parts alone compact.
If happily some persuade themselves that fire
May shift its body, and in the mass expire,
If once it should do so, its heat must fade
To naught; and all created things be made
Of nothing; since what does its limits pass
By change, quite perishes from what it was.
Therefore something must needs entire remain,
Least all things else annihilate again.
And this whole heap of things from nothing grow*
Since therefore certain Bodies we allow
Of constant nature, by whose being near
Or absent (order changed) things changed appear
In Nature too, and compounds do dissolve:
Then Fi'rie bodies (we with ease resolve)
Are not things Principles; neither at all
Imports it what goes out, or what does fall;
What Is joined to others, or from order swerve,
If all things did Fires nature still preserve:
For whatsoever then produced were,
Would be but only one continued fire.
But thus I take it, Bodies there be whose right
Encounter, Motion, Order, Figure, Site,
Compose the Fire, which if you shall transpose,
Will with their order, their own nature lose,
Neither resembling Fire, nor any such
As bring their Bodies to our sense or touch:
TO affirm then all things to be Fire, and naught
Real and true, but Fire, as this Man taught,
Is most egregious folly, for he goes
The Senses by the Senses to oppose,
And shakes their proof to whom all Truths we owe,
From whom, what he calls fire, himself does know
Believes the Sense knows fire, but not the rest,
Though full as clear, which seems to me a jest.
For what thing can there be more sure then Sense,
By which we truth discern from false pretense?
Besides, why should one rather all remove,
And heat the only nature left approve?
Then Fire deny, and all things else allow,
Both which were equal madness to avow:
Who ere then takes for Matter which frames all
The Fire, and that of Fire consists this Ball;
Who Air, the universal so^rce have deemed,
Or that pure water, or Earth have esteemed
Forms All, and is into all Nature made,
Have all alike at large from Truth estrai'd.
Add those, who Principles of things combine,
Who Fire to Air, and Earth to Water join,
And who think all of four things have their birth;
Spring up of Air, of Heat, of Shower and Earth:
An Agrigentine Citizen amongst these
Is chief and principal, Empedocles,
Born on the shore of Sicils triple-bounds,
Which the Ionian in wide bays surrounds,
Laving its Cliffs with azure waves, whose force
And rapid current Italy divorce
By a small strait; Here Is vast Charybdis seat,
And here the murmuring Aetna's flames do threat
To reinforce once more their dreadful ire,
And vomit yet again devouring fire,
Belching it forth out of his sooty jaws,
Which he at Heaven in lightning flashes throws.
Although this Isle for sundry things may seem
Famous, and many Nations it esteem
Renowned for wealth, and many gallant men;
Yet never had it ought more glorious then
This Personage, naught more miraculous,
More holy, or which was more precious.
His Verse divine, and his Inventions rare;
The Fruits of that rich breast, do so declare
An Universal knowledge, that some doubt,
Whether or no, he sprung from humane root:
Yet this man, and the rest that mentioned are
Beneath him greatly, his inferiors far;
Though, as if they divinely were inspired,
Have sundry things so difficult inquired,
And as if Oracles had from them broken,
More rational, and sacred things have spoken
Then Pythia herself, whose voice did breath
From Phoebus Tripod and the Laurel wreath;
Yet these great Persons all received great falls,
And split themselves on things Originals.
First, that they Motion without void avow,
And yet of things do soft and rare allow;
As Air, Sun, Fire, Corn, Earth, the Animal;
Yet in their bodies mix no void at all.
Next, that they will at all no limits give
To Bodies sections, nor from breaking leave,
Nor yield a least in things, whereas we see
That the extreme and top of all to be,
Which to our sense seems least, from whence we learn
There is a least in things which none discern.
Into another error here they fall,
Who hold that soft is things Original:
Which we perceive from other causes flow
And into those resolve; if this were so,
Each thing to naught would turn, and all renew
From nothing, which are equally untrue:
For whilst these are at mortal jars together,
It comes to pass that when they meet each other
They perish, or else scatter, as in sight
Winds, Lightnings, Showers, and Storms are put to flight.
Lastly, if of four things composed be all,
And in these four again dissolved fall.
Why should we then Originals esteem
Of things; not things Originals of them?
Since thus by turns successively they rise
And change their hue, their nature still disguise.
But if thou think bodies of Earth and Fire,
Air, and moist dew together here conspire;
That in this combination Nature's said
To make no change, naught from them can be made:
No living thing, nor things inanimate,
As Trees, for that it would discover strait
Their natures in one variant heap, and show
Air mixed in one with Earth, and Heat with dew.
Bnt Principles, in things production crave
Nature occult, and clandestine to have,
Least ought appear by which it be gainsaid,
Things to be truly that which they are made,
This too from Heaven, and from his Fires they bring,
And first the Fire to Air transformed they sing,
Hence Rain sublimed, and Earth condensed of Rain:
And so from Earth they all retire again,
First Water, then the Air, and Fire in train;
Nor once this course to cease; but too and fro
From Heaven to Earth, from Earth to Heaven they go:
Which Principles refuse, somewhat must stay,
Least all to nothing vanish quite away.
For whatsoever once its bounds does pass,
Strait perishes from what before it was.
Since therefore thus they change, as is confessed
Before; then must it needs be manifest
That they to other Principles relate
Immutable: lest all annihilate:
Rather such Bodies state that fire shall make
Add some few things, away some other take;
Order and Motion changed, turn to thin Air,
Thus every thing does every thing repair.
But you will object all things from Earth do spring
Up into the Air, and thence have nourishing;
And that unless a proper season sends
Indulgent showers, and kindly moisture lends
Unto the shrubs; except the Sun them nourish
And distribute his heat, no Grain can flourish;
No Trees, nor Animals, and even we
Our selves unless sustained and fed we be
With solid meats, and with mild juice to drink,
Our Bodies ruined, our whole Life would shrink
From off our Nerves and Bones; for without doubt
We are maintained and nourished throughout
With certain things, as other Creatures be
Of certain other: Since there do agree
Causes of many things, in many joined,
When various things by various nursed we find.
And now it would be truly comprehended
How these Originals are often times blended;
Their site and subject, and what motion they
Do mutually receive and give away:
For they are the same which Heaven constitutes
Sun, Seas, Earth, Streams, Shrubs, Animals and Fruits;
Although with different motions mixed they be,
Just as each where in these our lines you see
To diverse words are many Letters found
Common, which differ much in sense and sound:
Such change variety of Letters brings:
But Elements, which are indeed of things
The Principles, are able to induce
Greater, and more variety produce.
And now let us a little cast our eye
On the Anaxagoran Homoeomerie,
By Greeks so termed, and which our native speech
Poor in expression cannot fully reach,
However yet the thing it self be found
Facil in words, and easy to expound.
These Principles, or Homoeomerie
By this Philosopher so called, imply
That Bones of small and minute bones proceed,
That Intrails do of little Intrails breed,
And Blood of sanguine drops, which meet; likewise
That Gold of little grains of Gold does rise;
And Earth her form from small Terrella's takes;
That sparks the Fire, and humor Water makes:
By like proportion fains the rest to be,
And to no place assigns Vacuitie:
Nor any term or end does he allow
To Bodies sections, both of which we know
Extremely err, much like to those which we
In that which went before have let you see.
Besides, if these his Principles he name,
They are too feeble, being just the same
Even with those things of which they do depend,
Which fail together, and together end
Reciprocally; nor can ought them free
From ruining: For what thing can there be
Which may (in such a violence oppressed
Death to envade) Deaths very teeth resist?
Can Fire? or Water? can Air? Blood or Bone?
Or any one of these? I think not one.
Since the whole sum of things must be as frail
As what we see before our eyes to fail:
Then I attest what we before related,
Naught springs of Naught, or is annihilated,
Besides since, Meats augment the body, and
Do nourish it, then may we understand
That Veins, Blood, Bones, and likewise Sinews may
Consist of diverse parts; or if they say
All meats are mixed Bodies and contain
Certain small Bodies under them again,
As Nerves, Bones, Veins, and particles of blood:
Then of all meats it must be understood
Whether or no they dry or liquid are,
They all consist of parts dissimilar,
As Bones, Nerves, Veins, and Blood, likewise the Earth
If she contain all which from her have birth,
Then of strange parts the Earth must needs consist
Which thence arise, it is very manifest.
Change now the Subject, keep the terms still good,
If Flame, Smoke, Ashes all do lurk in Wood,
The wood of diverse parts it will imply.
Here is some slender probability
For Anaxagoras, which he assumcs.
Who all things thus to lurk in all presumes:
But only that appears which has most mixed,
And is more obvious in the front prefixed,
Which is as far from Truth; for then should Corn
Beneath the weighty millstone ground and worn,
Into small parts, some stains of blood there shed,
Or something whereof we are nourished.
Then should a stream of blood out-flowing gush,
When we one stone do with another crush.
By the same reason too, Herbs must distill,
And taste like Milk which from Ews teats does drill.
Thus stirring up the Gleab one often should find
Parcels of herbs, and grain of every kind,
With scattered boughs hid in the ground thus broke:
Lastly, in Wood cleft one should spy the Smoke,
Ashes, and sparks of Fire therein to nest:
But since no such effects are manifest,
Mixtures of things with things no such we see,
But that the seeds of many things there be
Diversely mixed, which latent are, and ought
To be amongst themselves in common thought.
But thou affirmst on Mountains which aspire,
That tops of Trees are often times set on fire
Till they do flame again with glowing heat,
When Southern winds them on each other beat:
And be it so, yet in wood by nature breeds
No fire; but there of heat are many seeds,
Which clash together, and the Groves inflame,
Whereas, were so great Fires hid in the same,
They could them not conceal, but they would out,
The Trees consume, and burn the shrubs about.
See you not then, (as we observed even now)
It much imports of the same seeds to know.
With what, and in what posture being joined,
What motions are received, and what assigned:
And how together changed they create
Fire out of Wood, just as the words relate,
The Letters but a little changed, when we
Lignum and Ignem plainly signify.
Lastly, if in things obvious to our eyes,
You think they cannot be made otherwise,
Except you shall a similar matter find
For every body in its several kind;
Then, by this means the Principles of all
Are quite destroyed, so that it must befall
They might into excessive laughter break,
Or wet with briny tears the face and cheek.
Now give good heed, and well observe the rest,
I know it most obsure, but my warm breast,
Brave hope of praise, has pierced with his dart,
And raised Poetique fervor in my heart:
By which instinct, where foot did never tread,
My fancy through unhaunted coasts is led.
Pleasant it is, pure streams in unknown bowres
To drink; it pleasant is to cull fresh flowers,
Whence a fair Wreath be for mine own head made,
With such the Muses never brow did shade.
First then, I teach great things, and so the mind
From superstitions pressing chains unbind.
Next, that dark things in such clear verse I write,
And season't with Poetical delight,
In this too I my due design shall drive;
For as who children bitter Wormwood give,
For healths sake, do the Cup first round the lip
With the sweet yellow dew of honey tip,
That so the silly child allured by the taste,
Off with the bitter wormwood Potion haste,
And unadvised, may with a harmless cheat
To perfect health be brought by this deceit.
So now, since this discourse perhaps may show
Harsh unto some, who scarcely of it know
As yet; since so uncouth to the Vulgar, I
My reasons do intend to signify
In soft Pierian verse, whose sweet appast
May recommend our Muse unto thy taste,
Whilst thou the nature of all things do see
Decked with such beauty and variety.
But since I taught that Bodies most compact,
Unvanquished perpetually do act*
Whether their sum defined be or no;
Void too, be it space, or place where all things go,
Let Us search if it admit of any Bound,
Or stretch immensely to a vaste profound.
Then sure this All can no way finite be,
For then it must have some extremity
Now naught has an extreme, unless beyond
Some other thing be, which should give it bound.
So that one may discern the utmost space,
Then which no further it our sense can trace.
Since then beyond the whole we needs must grant
Nothing remains, it Term and Bound must want.
Nor ought imports it on what clime one stands,
Since infinite its equal-self expands
Throughout; Besides, were all which now is space,
Finite, suppose one running to the Place
Where that extreme were, should throw forth a Dart,
Think you it would fly directly to that part
The strong arm aimed it at, and pass outright,
Or would something oppose it in the flight?
For one of them you must at least confess,
Whilst either does your Argument distress,
So that no end to All you must concede;
For were there ought which did the dart impede,
That whither it were sent it could not tend,
Or flew beyond, then that were not the end.
Then thus I urge, where ere you fix the bound,
I ask ye where the Weapon may be found;
But 'twill fall out, an end will no where be,
The Void affording room eternally
For flight. Besides, if this All every where
With Bounds impaled be, and finite were;
Then would the store of Matter on each side
Beneath through poyse of solids downwards slide;
Nor could there ought under heavens cope be done,
Nor would there be a Sky, or glittering Sun,
Because all matter must in one heap lie
Prostrate, and sunk from all Eternity.
But now have Principles no rest at all,
Since there is no bottom into which they fall,
Or flowing tend, and make a fixed repose;
But each thing by assiduous motion goes
Through all parts, and the Eternal Bodies be
(Thus moved) supplied from infinity.
Lastly, that one thing the other bounds it is plain,
For Air invests the Hills, Hills Air again;
And Earth the Seas; the Sea the Earth embraces;
But naught beyond the whole it is limit places.
Then is the space of place thus deep and wide,
For else the famous Rivers could not glide
With everlasting course, nor ever gain
That near their journeys end they should attain:
So that throughout vaste compass does extend
Into all parts, leaving for things no end.
Nature her self seems this to have designed,
That the whole mass of things be not confined.
Because she Bodies both in void includes,
And into Bodies void again intrudes
Alternatly; so that with one and other,
She renders all things infinite together.
For unless both of them contained were
Reciprocally, then would each appear
In their own nature Boundless, Seas, nor Earth,
Nor bright celestial Mansions mortal birth;
Nor sacred Bodies of the Gods so pure
Could the least portion of time endure:
For this vast matter being once become
Dissolved, had sattered through this Vacuum.
Rather it nothing could have ere created,
Because it nere could join, being dissipated.
For let us not think these Principles did range
Themselves in order, and by Counsel change;
That each particular motion was decreed
Before by Compact: But 'twas thus indeed,
That passing frequent changes, and in those
Enduring as it were eternal blows,
After all Trials, did in fine quiesce
In the same posture which they now possess.
Whence the whole sum of al things else are made,
And keeping in due motion do not fade,
Nor are at all impeacht, for many years
This mass preserved in its fit posture steers
The course of Rivers, and does cause they keep
With pregnant waves entire the greedy deep.
That the Sun-quickned-Earth renews her fruits:
That Animals bring forth, and new recruits
Cherish Etherial Fires, which in no wise
Could be, unless abundant matter rise
From infinite, whence all that lost have been
Are wont in time to be repaired again.
For as in Animals of nourishment
Deprived, Bodies are lost, and Natures spent:
So all things must dissolve, when Matter flies,
Or deviating, fails of due supplies.
Nor could encounters in the mass each where
United keep all that congested were.
Strike they indeed might often, and thereby
Retard a part, till they the whole supply:
Others again rebound, and are compelled
A space for Principles of things to yield,
And Time to slip away, that they might be
Thus disunited, set at liberty.
Therefore there is extreme necessity
That still of things spring up vairety:
And that there should be infinite supplies
Of matter, which may for those strokes suffice.
To these things Memmius then no credit lend,
When they say all things to the Center tend:
And for this reason that the World alone
Subsists unpropt by outward motion:
And that nor base nor superficies be
Resolved, since all things to the middle flee.
Should you suppose ought on it self can rest,
And all those weights beneath be upwards pressed,
That they may on this Hemisphear repose,
Whence they maintain that as calm Water shows
Shadows, and Images of things, that so
Beneath our feet some Animals do go,
Which on the inferior Regions of the Sky
Can no more fall, then may our Bodies fly
Up to Celestial Thrones, that they see light
Of Sun, when we enjoy the Stars of night,
And the Annual seasons interchang'd, always
Divide with us, and have nights for our days:
But some fond error first these things devised,
Amongst silly men; for that they never comprised
The pure Originals of things aright;
For since that void and place are infinite,
Nothing can Center be, or if there were
A Medium, yet no reason does appear
To prove that it should but in one place dwell,
And in another not be found as well.
For every place and space we empty call,
Be It Medium or no, it must yield all
Alike to pond'rousness, even wheresoever
Its motion drives; nor any place is there
Whither, when heavy bodies are arrived,
They can in Vacuum stand of weight deprived.
Nor may the Void to Bodies yield a Base;
But, as its Nature is, must still give place.
Things therefore cannot in such sort be joined,
As to the middle by desire inclined.
Besides it is clear, because they do not fain,
As if all bodies would the Center gain:
But such alone as the most Earthy be,
And liquid, like the waters of the Sea,
And Cataracts which from steep mountains fall,
And what of Bodies is terrestrial.
Against this they oppose, that the hot fire,
And Airs thin breath from the midst both retire:
That thence the Orbs revolve their trembling light,
And Sols bright flame fresh nourishments invite
In azure Spears, 'cause heat the Center flies,
And joins to exhalations which arise.
But each thing mortal food from earth receives:
Nor could top branches of the Trees shoot leaves,
Unless insensibly the Earth them fed:
For else, like hasty flames already fled;
The Worlds bright walls would vanish suddenly
Through the vast Void dissolved, the rest would be
After the same sort hurried, that from high
Would drop the thundering Turrets of the Sky:
And under foot the sinking earth to bend,
Whilst the same ruin Earth with Heaven would blend,
Crushing all Bodies with disordered force,
Through the profound Abyss to steer their course,
So that one Moment would no relic leave,
Save Elements, which no eye could perceive;
And Desert space, for from what part soever
You would that Bodies first receding were,
That part an open sluice of death must prove,
Where Matter issuing forth would downwards move.
If then by this slight work, thou knowledge gain,
(For one thing will the other much explain)
Thou can not err, but shall perceive aright
Natures extremes: So Things to Things give light.
The end of the First Book.
The Stationer to the Reader.
I Must acknowledge ingenuously, That these Animadversions following, were some
scattered Collections encountered at the end of this Copy, which it was the
Authors express desires I should totally suppress; as being conscious how
justly they might importune the Learned, to whom (he told me) they were so
little considerable: But to advance our particular Interest, and gratify the
Printer (who objected the Volume was too small of it self) I have adventured to
publish this Addition: and (since I cannot but believe it will please some)
shall beg pardon both of the Writer and Reader, for this presumption of

their Most humble Servant G. BEDEL.

ANIMADVERSIONS UPON THE FISRT BOOK OF T. LVCRETIVS CARVS DE RERUM NATURA.
Aeneadum genitrix, hominum Divumque voluptas,
Alma Venus, -- etc.
Romes parent Venus, joy of Gods above;
And men, -- etc.
THe renowned Prince of Troy, Aeneas, feigned to be the Son of Anchises, and
the Goddess Venus, espoused to his first wife Creusa, daughter of King Priamus,
after the sack of that City, with twenty ships he wandered into Italy, and
carried along with him his Son Ascanius, Dyonis. Hali.
named also Julus, where in ad Nuptials, he married Lavinia, relict of the
vanquished Turnus King of the Latins, whom he succeeded. Now after the
Apotheosis of Aeneas, Ascanius his successor left a son called Julus Sylvius,
of whom linealy descended the great Julius Caesar, Virg. Aen. 1.
who for this cause, as is reported, dedicated a Temple, Veneri Genetrici. Thus
the Goddess, becomes Patroness of the Family of the Emperors, and so by a
figure, of the Imperial City, according to that of the Poet,

-- Genus unde Latinum
Albanique Virg. Aen. 10.
patres, atque altae moenia Romae
-- Whence Latins come
Great Albans Ancestors, and towering Rome.
But as Ven^s is here invocated by our Carus (otherwise no great friend to Gods
or Goddesses) either it is because it was the custom of Poets in all Heroical
works of this nature to implore the Divine aid: or more probably, for that
Venus was feigned to preside in Gardens; whence, according to Varro, she was
frequently styled hortensis, and wherein our Lucretius his Master Epicurus
spent so much of his time, was so delighted, and first delivered his so
celebrated Institution. But to approach the design of our Poet, by Venus, we
are to understand that inseparable appetite and inclination to propagate and
engender; which (says Cicero) is by Nature diffused into all living ^reatures;
for so the Etymologists Venus a Venire, Cic. de Not. Deor. l. 2.
because of her universal access. The old Poets have derived her original from
the Genitors of Coelus cast into the sea; whence mixing with the (...), or scum
of its waters, the Greeks named her Aprodite. Cicero in his book of the Nature
of Gods, makes mention of no fewer then four of this name; but for that the
Poets chiefly celebrate only the second, to whom they usually attribute all
the actions of the rest, we shall purposely omit them. This was she on whom
Mercury begat Cupid. It is said, that this Goddess being conceived in a great
Concha, or shell of mother of Pearl, floated therein by the propitious aid of
Zephyrus (mentioned also within few lines of the beginning of this Poem by the
name of Favonius, a wind which spireth from the occidental point of the
Aequinox, especially in the spring, as being most generative) to the Isle of
Cyprus, where she fortuned to be taken up by certain Nymphs of that Coast.
Plato in his Banquet reckons up two more; the one very ancient, daughter of the
Heavens, Urania, or Coelestis; intimating the brightness and re^ulgency of the
Divinity, together with a most secret affection which she produces,
endeavoring to attract our souls, and unite them to the Essence of God. But the
second and younger, daughter of Jupiter and Dione, whom he names Pandemia,
popular, carnal and voluptuous, comes nearer to the instance of our Poet in
this place. For Pausanias in his Misen: and Plutarch in his Problem's, make her
with Jupiter, Juno, Suadela and Diana to preside at Marriages. In sine, this is
the Lady that became so desperately enamored with Anchises, by whom she had
Aeneas, nor less it seems with Mars himself; for therefore does our Poet
implore her intercession with that ^urious God.

Nam tu sola potes tranquilla pace juvare
Mortalis: quoniam belli fera moenera Mavors;
Armipotens regit: in gremium qui saepe tuum se
Reficit aeterno devinctus volnere amoris.
To Mortals Thou alone can rest afford,
Since Mars, who is of direful Wars the Lord,
On thy fair bosom resting often his head,
With lasting wounds of Love is vanquished.
And even immerged in her luxurious embracements, in which plight he could
refuse his Mistress nothing; such charms and puissant attracts had love, even
over the Gods themselves. But to resolve the Mythologie to the purpose of out
Author; we understand by Venus here, that universal Appetite of procreating its
like, which inclination for receiving its birth together with the world it
self, caused her to be feigned of so near relation to Coelum whence those who
have affirmed that the humane soul descended from Heaven into our bodies, and
that again it passed from one Orb to another, extract out of each Sphere,
diverse particular affections: as that the Soul has from Venus (besides many
others) all her c^ncupiscible appetites, etc. She is affirmed to be born of the
Sea, not only to represent the continual estuations of disorderly livers, and
lascivious persons; but rather for that the salacious liquor aideth greatly to
the generative virtue, inciting the inclinations, by its acrimonious mordacity.
Lastly, she is supposed enamored with Adonis, who is taken for the Sun,
because her embracements prove ineffectual, without the assistance of a
generative and fermenting heat: for which cause were roses, myrre, etc. sacred
to her, as allectives, and incentives of pleasure, Or rather God, who gives
being to all things: for Deus ipsa natura est: Lac. l. 2. c. 8. The Schools
distinguish inter Na^uram natarantem, and naturam naturatam, etc.
yet not without their punctures, blushes and fading, for such is the nature
and close of all sensual commerce and delights whatsoever. And thus much of
Venus, or rather Nature it self, which for giving Title to our Poets present
works, we did purposely illustrate: But let us hear how Statius describes the
Goddess Tellus in imitation of our Author.

-- O hominum div^inique aeterna creatrix The said. lib. 8.

Quae fluvios, sylvasque animasque, and semina mundi
Cuncta, promethaeasque manus, Pyrrhaeaque Saxa
Gignis, and impastis quae prima alimenta dedisti,
Mutastique viros, quae pontum ambisq, vehisque
Te penes and pecudum gens mitis, and ira ferarum,
E^ volucrum re^^ies; ^irmum atque immobile mundi
Robur inoccidui: te velox machina Coeli
Aere pendentem vacuo, te currus uterque
Circuit, O rerum media, indivisaque magnis
Fratribus; ergo simul tot gentibus alma, tot altis
Vrbibus, ac populis, subterque ac desuper una
Sufficis --
Eternal source, whence Gods and men proceed,
Who S^ereams, Woods, Souls, the universal seed,
Promethean clay, and Pyrrhan stones indu'st
With life, ^^ed'st Babe^, and humane shapes renew'st:
Do the vast Sea encompass and sustain,
Do over wild Beasts, and Milder Cattle reign
And roosts of Birds, the firm and stable world:
The heavens swift Orbs with rapid motion hurled
Thee (Stretching in the empty air thy wings)
With Sun and Moon dance round: O m^dst of things
Amongst the mighty brothers thou do stand
Unshar'd, and feed'st all Nations with thy hand*
On thy broad back, and on thy equal chest,
So many Towers, and high-built Cities rest, etc.
Thus having invocated his Goddess, in the next he deprecates the War; during
which, neither could Poets well write, nor Patrons have leisure to read: for
much about this time happened those unfortunate broils, and furious commotions,
wherein Claudius was slain by Milo, the Gauls divided by Caesar, and the whole
Empire it self almost out of frame by the Conspiracies of Cateline, and his
bloody Accomplices, during all which stirs and public disa^lers

-- Neque nos agere hoc patriai tempore iniqu^
Possumus aequo animo: nec Memmi clara propago
Talibus in rebus, communi deesse saluti.
For whilst our Country thus afflicted lies
With what con^ en^ can we Philosophise?
Nor may brave Memini^s then wanting be
To th'publique peace in such perplexi^y.
For Memmius he knew, as a Loyal Cavalier, could not but be engaged, and it was
this illustrous person to whom our Lucretius nuncupates his present work;
concerning whose extraction (since a Name so frequently mentioned throughout
this Author) diverse curious in Antiquities have taken the pains to deliver his
Pedigree, which some of them have out of his almost contemporary M^^e, not
blushed to derive even from the Trojans themselves,

Mox Italus Mnesiheus, genus a quo nomine Memmi.
Certain it is, he sprung from a very ancient stock. C. Memmius recorded by
Livy, Livius, l. 41.
being created Praetor about the time of the war with Perses King of Macedonia,
obtained the Province of Sardinia, and was ^nvested with many other dignities,
as Quaestor, Aedile, etc. after which he was removed to the Praetory of Sicili:
And of this Memmius were two sons, C. and L. Memmius, so celebrated for their
learning and eloquence by the father of Orators. C. L. Memmii (says Cicero)
fuerunt Oratores mediocres, Cic. in Brut.
accusatores acres, atque acerbi, etc. Cajus (as Orosius writes) when for his
integrity and parts, he stood to be Consul, Cic. in. Catil. Appian. l, 1. (...)
in libello de viris Illust. Romans
was by one Saturnus a Tribune of the Commons (who feared his Virtues)
barbarously murdered in Campo Martio. There was also another Memmius of the
same family, supposed Brother or Cousin-German to the former, by marriage
allied to Pompeius, with whom he went into Spain in the Expedition contra
Sertorium, where he valiantly lost his life in the Service, as Cicero pro
Balbo, Plut. Orosius and others report. But to come to that Memmius unto whom
our Poet dedicates this Book; he was (as Cicero affirms) son to the
abovementioned Lucius, a person so studious in his youth, that besides the name
of Learned which he had acquired, he was held in very great estimation with all
the wisemen of his time. It seems He and Lucretius had been Contemporaries at
Athens, when afterward returning to Rome, he was then by the favor of
Pompeius, advanced to eminent honor; for being first made Praetor, he went
Governor of Bythinia, in which voyage the Poet Catullus accompanied him, and as
its believed, our Carus also, together with Curtius Nicas, a famous and noble
Grammarian of those times, whom he exceedingly cherished, as is related by
Suetonius. But quitting Bythinia (upon what occasion something uncertain,
though there be, who lay his ill administration there to his charge) he was
shortly after accused by Cajus Caesar and others; out of all which Memmius
emerging, he contends with Domitio Massallas, Scaurus, and others, for the
Consulat* in which the difference grew so sharp, that in conclusion there could
be none elected for that year* Sundry Interregnums in the mean time happening, as
Cicero himself testifies; for Memmius and Caesar being now reconciled, Caesar
stood much for him in the litigation; Suetonius
but all in vain, for those four Candidates, and diverse others, being accused
of Bribery, and other indirect dealings, the year after Cn. Pompeius being
Consul, Anno LOCI our unfortunate Memmius condemned ( Lege Pompeia de ambitu)
with one Hypseus, and the rest, was exiled into Greece, where he spent some
time at Athens, in which place he had first o^ all sucked in the Elements of
that Philosophy, which he ever after so much affected; being so great an
admirer of the Epicurean Sect, that he certainly intended to have erected
something in honor of that great Institutor; but afterward (it seems) being
diverted from that design, he removed thence to Mytelene, thence to Patre, a
Town in Achaia, near Corinth; where being in fine ascribed amongst the number
of Citizens, he adopted for his heir, the son of one Lyso, a Citizen of Patre,
being a person of much integrity, and one of Ciceroes special friends; and so
shortly after ended his days in that place. Thus much I thought it convenient
to mention concerning our Memmius, for the reasons before alleged. Those who
desire to receive farther satisfaction herein, may consult Cicero de Clar is
Oratoribus ad Brutum, and in Rabiriana: Agellius, Charisius, Priscian, Gellius,
etc. where as well of his vices as virtues, and what works he left to
posterity; add to these Tacitus, Suetonius, Fasti Consul, Capitolin, etc. the
Medails and ancient Inscriptions amongst the curious, Ang. Politianus, P.
Victor, and others. It concerns us no farther, then to show the Reader how
worthy a Patron our Poet made choice of, soofren by all the endearments of
friendship conjured to give diligent attention to what he is delivering.

Nam tibi de summa Coeli ratione, deumque
Disserere incipiam; and rerum primordia pandam:
V;nde omnis natura creet res, auctet, alatque:
Quove eadem rursum natura perempta resolvat:
Quae nos materiem, etc.
For I of Gods, and Heaven will discourse,
And show whence all things else derive their source,
Whence Nature does create, augment and cherish
To what again resolve them when they perish.
And indeed the nature of the Gods, according to his own Doctrine, did not
result from these principles: Epicurus, it is believed, made them to proceed
from a certain fourth incorrupt nature; and therefore it was an error which
some delivered, that the Gods were likewise composed of Atoms, as other
Philosophers had before him thought them to consist of Numbers: for so did
Pythagoras, some of Fire, as Heraclitus, etc. Our Poets design here being
Vniversa Rerum Natura, as it concerns the fabric of the world in general, Adeo
religio esse non potest, ubi metus nullus est.
which yet he erroneously believed was not to be attained, whilst the
cogitations of men were any way restrained or distracted with this (...), and
apprehension of the Gods, or rather (as I interpret it) misled by the
superstitions of the times: wherefore he endeavors to persuade Memmius to take
it for a truth undeniable, Lact. de Just. c. 2. and de ira dei.
that those celestial inhabitants took little account of what Mortals did on
earth: for says he,

Omnis enim per s^ Divum natura necesse est
Immortali aevo summa cum pace fruatur,
Semota a nostris rebus, sejunctaque long:
Nam privata dolor omni, privato periclis,
Ipsa suis pollens opibus: nihil indiga nostri,
Nec ^^ne promeritis capitur, nec tangitur ira.
Gods in their Nature of themselves subsist
It Is certain; nor may ought their peace molest,
For ever, unconcerned with our affairs,
So far remote, void of our grief or cares,
Need not our service, swim in full content,
Nor our good works accept, nor bad resent.
Dissolvitur autem religio, Lact. de ira dei c. 8. Auson.
si credamus Epicuro illa dicenti, Be this our Faith, and farewell all
Religion, as the Father Lactantius has it, reciting this passage. But so
another of the same Creed, Quod est beatum, morte and aeternum carens, nec sibi
parit negotium, nec alteri: For it is a sad truth, that the Doctrine of
Epicurus had infected our Carus, though not with a positive belief (as some
will have it) that there were indeed no Gods at all; ^et with an opinion, that
they did not interess themselves in humane affairs, or were at all concerned
with the productions of Nature; which they affirmed came to pass from other
causes, and sine delectu, as it were, good and bad sharing alike in this world.
Quod si Mundus divina providentia, and alicujus numinis a^ctoritate regeretur;
nunquam mereretur Phalaris and Dionysius regnum, nunquam R^tilus and Camillus
exilium, nunquam Socrates Venenum. Had there been any such thing as Gods
providence over the actions of men, Tyrants had never usurped, nor had honest
men suffered, says Caecilius in M. Felix; but now

Marmoreo Lici^^s tumulo jacet, Varr^.
at Cato parvo
Pompeius nullo; credimus esse Deos!
In vaulted marble Licin is enclosed
A turf does holy Ca^^ hide;
Uncovered Pompey lies abroad exposed,
Can providence these actions guide?
Fortuna certa, aut incerta Natura, something which they knew not what to call,
had charge of these sublunary things; those that suffered innocently, and those
who swim in the streams of prosperity were all of like Religion; which makes
Selius in Martial affirm it positively,

Nullos esse Deos, inane Coelum
-- Probatque quod se
Factum, dum negat haec, videt beatum.
Gods there are none, heaven is void.
Nay proves it, since whilst this he does deny
He sees himself swim in prosperity.
And therefore the Oracle to the Boetians demanding how they might become
happy, made answer, (...), by being wicked.

But that so indeed it sometimes pleases God to over whelm impious men with the
^elicities and affluence of this world. Se R^b. M. May. mon: More Nevochim par.

But the holy Poet King David to the contrary, Psalm. 8. and as Seneca himself
proceeds there, Magna ira est, quando peccantibus non ^^ascitur Deus. See S
Hier. whole Epist. 8. 1. ^. ad Castrutium.
or rather th^^ of Chrysostom, St. Aug. Salvianus, Viperanus, Plutarch and
Seneca the Philosopher, in a book expressly, Cicero, l. 3. de not, Deor. de
Harpalo, and Dionysius the Tyrant, Lactantius de ira Dei, de justitia, and
sundry others, who have rendered ample satisfaction concerning this method of
the Divine providence. But as touching the other opinion, that there should be
no Gods, History is not capable to make a rational man believe that ever any
were so barbarous, Nulla enim gens tam ^era, In Tusc. l. de lege. and 2. de
Natura Deor.
says Cicero: There is no body so mad, etc. and yet thus it is recorded, that
besides this Selius, Prothagoras, Theodorus Cyrenaeus, and many others, there
was one Diagoras of old, surnamed the Atheist, who with the foolish-hearted in
the Psalm, affirmed openly that there was no God, to discard that superstition
which he affirmed had possessed the minds of men, whose fears first created
them. But let us observe the event, himself was shortly after banished, and his
damnable books burnt by a solemn decree of the Athenians, it being reported
that himself likewise perished in a storm at Sea, God having once before
cleansed the whole world by a universal Cataclysm for this impious and
irrational blasphemy.

Lucretius indeed seems rather in this place, and the many other instances
through the following work, to express their neglect of humane affairs, then
totally to disavow their existence. Ego Deum genus esse semper dixi, and dicum
Coelitum (says Ennius) sed eos non curare opinor, quid agat humanum genus: and
so the forecited Minutius introduces Caecilius, deriding the Christians of his
time, Deum illum suum quem nec ostendere possunt, nec videre in omnium mores,
actus omnium, verba denique and occultas cogitationes diligenter inquirere?
discurrentem scilicet and ubique praesentem? This they thought insupportable to
the divine nature, and indeed impossible that the Gods could attend the actions
of every particular person and place; cum nec singulis inservire possit per
universa distractus, nec universis sufficere in singulis occupatus: No, says
he, there is no appearance to believe it, concluding with that of Socrates,
Quod supera nos, 4. Acad* 2. de divin.
Nihil ad nos; For he supposed (as the Orator of Dicaearches) id esse alienum a
majestate deorum, causas omnium introspicere, videant quid cuique conducat,
etc. But I leave the man, and all of his mind, to the confutations of the
incomparable Octavius, Divin. Inst. l. 5.
of whose ability in this kind, the Father Lactantius has rendered a very
worthy Character, and what pity it was, he made not this business of reducing
Atheists, Lact. de Falsa sap.
a greater part of his studies and employment.

The very truth is, Leucippus (not our Philosopher) was the first broacher of
this irreligious stuff: for he impudently denied, not only the providence and
power of God, but likewise the immortality of the Soul* as for Epicurus his
opinion, take it in short thus, He held God to be (...), perfectly happy in
himself; as for other matters, that they were all effected by certain natural
weights and motions; nay with much reverence, that men were to adore and
worship this God, for his Omnipotency, Excellency, Beauty, Immortality, and
other transcendencies; but in no wise to be afraid of him for any thing which
men did; 4. de Denesi.
for as Seneca has interpreted this passage almost in the very words of our
Poet, Deus nihil agit, nec magis illum beneficia, quam injuriae tangunt, and of
the same mind it seems was his Country man, where he affirms,

-- Nunquam se curadeorum Lucan. l. 5.

Sic premit, ut vestrae vitae vestraeq, Saluti
Fata vacent --
The Gods can never well so low descend,
That Fates should on your death or li^e attend.
All other things Fortuna non Art regi^etc. Claud.
as if it were to subvert the very being of the Divinity, to give it the
perpetual anxiety of administering so vast and unwealdy a Commonwealth; that the
Gods should have no leisure to enjoy themselves, whilst they took any th^ught
or cognizance of others* some imagining them so full of employment, some too
intent in their pleasures; such as it is likely the Prophet derided in the
Priests of Baal, Forsitan loquitur, aut in diversorio est, aut in Itinere, 3.
Reg. 18. 27. Ephesians. 2. 12.
etc. for to all these diversions and necessities, Lucian blushes not to oblige
even Jupiter himself. Thus were these miserable men without God in the world,
utterly ^stranged from the speculation of his omnipotent Nature, whose chief
delight is in the doing of good, and whose inex haustible bounry and
providence, even over things the most inconsiderable, is without any perplexity
at all, or the least molestation; for in him we live, Act. 17. 28. Luc. 12. 6.
7. Vide Arrianum Epict. (...), l. 1. c. 6. 16. Et l. 2. c. 20.
and move* and have our being; not a sparrow falls to the ground without his
appointment, quinetiam capilli capitis omnes numerati sunt, and what is more
trivial then a Hair? But thus I say, did these Gentiles grossly mistake the life
and essence of the Infinite Deity, imagining him of some Humane form, nature
and imbecility, whose power is Omnipo^ence it self, whose will is the principle
of all things, and whose desires are Consummated works, as the Eloquent
Monsieur D' Espagnet has defined in his incomparable Physica restituta. Sad
and certain it is, that however some (...), Ephesians. 2. 12
even in this pretending age of ours, talk so much of the providence of God,
yet so live they, as if they denied it in their Actions; to convince whom,
since it is the duty of the Preacher, I should here beg pardon for having said
so much, did not the present Argument, and frequent objection against our Poet,
sufficiently justify me. The great Lipsius in his book de Constantia, has
spoken well on this subject; or to come nearer home, the learned Dr. Hackwel in
his excellent Apology, as this of our Carus, with all his eight reasons,
refuted by the ingenious Dr. Charlton, to all whose discourses I suppose
nothing can easily be added, besides trouble to the Reader. But will you now
learn who it was that first removed this Bugbear out of the minds of Mortals?
Hear we Lucretius thus describing him.

Humana ante oculos foede cum vita jaceret
In terris oppressa gravi sub Religione:
Quae caput a Coeli regionibus ostendebat,
Horribili super adspectu mortalibus instans:
Primum Grajus homo mortalis tollere contra
Est oculos ausus, primusque obsistere contra, etc.
Whilst sometimes humane life dejected lay
On earth, under gross super^titions sway,
Whose head aloft from heaven seemed t'appear,
And Mankind with its horrid shape did scare,
With mortal eyes to look on her that durst
Or contradict, a Grecian was the first, etc.
And a bold man he was indeed, Ponere os in coelum, thus to out face heaven.
Diog. Laert. l. 10.
Epicurus it seems was the person. (...), (...), (...), etc* Epicurus was the
son of Neoclis and Chaerestrata, of the tribe of the Garti^ns, within the City
of Athens, of the family of the Philaides. Metr^dorus in lib. de Nobilit.
About the age of eighteen he went and studied at Athens, near the time of the
death of Alexander the great, when Zenocrates and Aristotle, those famous
persons flourished. In that University having procured many Scholars that
favored his opinions, he first founded that Institution, which afterward
preserved his memory and name; but he received (it seems) the first hint of
these opinions from the books of Democrates touc^ing Atoms, and Anistippus
concerning pleasure; which yet the world is infinitely mistaken in, Vide
Gassend. in vita Epic. in Epist. Nam quod ad bonos attinet mores evincam facile
opinor, etc.
whilst they fondly imagine he placed it in those luxurious and carnal
appetites of the sensual and lower man; upon which account so many have made
his name to become a Characteristick of reproach, Verum isti, a quibus talia
objiciuntur, insaniunt: as the forecited Laertius; for, says he, he was a
person of super-excellent candor and integrity, as testified by his Country in
general; the costly Statues, and glorious Inscriptions erected to his memory;
his many Friends and Disciples; and lastly, that promiscua erga omnis
benevolentia; nay, and (what the Reader little expected) even his Religion and
Charity: for ^uch are the successive expressions of Diogenes. (...), namely to
the Gods his piety, and affection to his Country, both of them so conspicuous
in him. And then for his Di^t: he was (says Diocles) so frugal and Ascetick,
Cont. Des. Herald. l. 1. in Apol. Tertul. Com.
that his drink was nothing save a small sort of wine, or for the most part
water of the rock only; nay, it is reported, that one day sending for a morsel
of cheese to his bread, he was heard to prosess, that it was a very great
Extraordinary, Hujuscemodi ergo Ille fuit, qui Bonorum finem Voluptatem esse

Why Mortals plot you wickedness for gain
Unsatiable, strifes and wars maintain?

Hero was born in the hundred and ninth Olimpiad, the third year after the
death of the Divine Plato. (...) Apollodorus in Chron. Suaveest, and nihil
curo. Cic. 2. Tuscul. qu.
He instituted his School and Sect being about thirty years of age: and
finally, ended ^is life at Athens, in the second year of the 127 Oly^piad,
after he had lived about 72 years, being tormented with the fatal Stone in the
bladder, during which conflict (which continued no less then fourteen days) he
expressed such an admirable patience and tranquillity of Spirit, gave so many
incomp^rable precepts to those which were about him, that the empty and
impatient Epicures of our age (unworthy that Character) who execrate and fret
at every trifling accident, See Mascardi discorso. 7. part. 3. Gassend. de vita
epic. in Epist.
may blush to style themselves after his illustrious name, to whose virtues
they can pretend so little title, piget, imo pudet omnino delacerari ipsum
abiis, qui simulantes Curios vivuntinterim Bacchanalta, and ab illius
moderatione prolixissimis absunt intervalli^. The Epistle which he writ to
Idomeneus in that very paroxism that carried him away, sufficiently testifies,
that the Felicity which he cherished and taught, was only to be enjoyed in the
command over his Passions, the memery of his excellent inventions, Philosophy,
and incomparable Reason. And if this hasty design do not fully represent him to
the Reader, Vide Ciceronem in epist. famil. l. 15. 19.
le^ him behold him described to the very life, by the skilful Pensil ^f
Laertius, where he shall also see his Testament, Doctrine, Disciples and
Writings; where likewise his Books de Natura, de Atomis, Inani, de Amore, and a
just Liberary more by that Biographer enumera^ed, Less then this I could not
well have said concerning our great Epicurus, of whose Doctrine and Pla^its our
Lucretius was the express Trumpet in Roman Verse, his Philosophy being the very
subject matter of all that which he has in six books comprehended. This, I
say, was that bold person, who whilst he derided the most superstitious of his
Country, seemed not aff^aid to violate the Sanctuaries of Nature, and even
Heaven it self; slighting the thunderbolts of their fantasti^al Deities, which
till then had preserved men within the limits of fear, and a false Religion, an
oppression he believed to a knowing person altogether vain and insupportable.
Thus therefore after he had speculated the uttermost efferts and design of
Nature,

Atque omne immensum peragravit mente, animoque
Vnde refert nobis victor, -- etc.
All that was great* his generous soul had viewed.
Behold him now like another Behemoth, c. 41. 25.
of whom Job, Omne sublime videt, ipse est rex superbiae super universos filios
superbiae, and like a Conqueror boldly triumphing over the whole Empire of
Nature, and celebrating himself in this glorious Pean of the Poet,

Felix qui potuit Rerum cognoscere Causas, Virg. Geor. 2.

Atque metus omneis, and inexorabile fatum
Subjecit pedibus, strepitumque Acherontis avari.
Happy who can things and their causes reach,
Has cast all fears and ridgid fate beneath
His feet, and the vain dread of greedy death.
Epicurus thus Deified, and his small Devotion commended by our Poet, he
proceeds like a wary Atheist, to sortifie his assertion, pretending as if he
meant nothing less then the desbauching of his friend Memmius into any
rudiments of Impiety, farther then to demonstrate the great evils and
inconveniences which proceeded from the actions and pretended Devotion of
superstitious men; instanced by the cruel Sacrifice of a fair Virgin Princes^,

Aulide quo pacto Triviai Virginis arma,
I^hianassai turparun^ Sanguine foede
Ductores Danaum delecti, prima virorum, etc.
Thus when the Grecian Chie^s of prime repute
The unwed Trivian Altar did pollute
With Iphigenias blood, at Aulis, etc.
As our Carus here relates the passage. 3. de Offic.
For it seems Agamemn^n had formerly made a promise ( promissum (says Cicero)
potius non faciendum quam tam taetrum facinus faciendum fuit) to Sacrifice the
fairest birth of that year, which falling out to be his own daughter, and only
child, Iphigenia, he so long deferred, that the winds proving contrary to his
Trojan design (so that the Fleets could by no means get out of the Port of
Aulis) it was told him by Calcas, Vide Elect. Soph. and Eurip. Iphig. Virg Aen.
2.
that Dianas being incensed for the procrastination of his vow, was the cause
of the soul weather, which hindered his expedition; whereupon the superstitious
King imm^dia^ely, and most u^mercifully sacrifices his Daughter. The reason is
clear by our Poet,

Exitus ut Classi feliae, faustusque daretur.
Tantum religio potuit suadere malorum.
That a safe expedit^on might b^ made
To so much Ill, could foolish zeal persuade!
Though some there are who write that the Goddess taking pity on the Virgin,
accepted of an Hind in her ^tead. But strange was the power of Superstition in
those Ages, that so wise, and so great men should suf^er that extreme delusion;
insomuch, as some did not only design others, but even themselves for Victims
to those blood-thirsty infernal powers. Vide Eurip. in Phaenissis. Val. Max.
for so we read of Menaeceus the son of Creon, in the wars of Thebes to Mars;
Codrus in his generous disguise, and Curtius in his vainglorious precipitation.
Besides the Decii, and infinite others, of whom see Plutarchs Themistocles, and
Pausania^, Lyctiorum in Creete, the Lesbians, and Phocoensis, of which Clemens,
Alexand. in protreptico. They used yearly to sacrifice a Gaul of either Sex to
Jupiter, and in some parts of Africa, Dionys. Haliar. l. 1.
the immolated little babes to Saturn; nay, as Lactantius reports, the
Carthaginians sacrificed no less then two hundred Noblemens children at once,
to pacify that Idol after their overthrow by Agathocles King of Sicily, O
dementian insanabilem! quid illis isti dii amplius facere possent, s^essent
iratissitni? etc. as the Father there exclaims. De falsa Relig. l. 1. c. 21.

In Ponticus and Egypt in the rites of Busiris* they sacrificed strangers, as
Throseus the Southsayer found upon sad experience: And not long since, what
inhumane butcheries they exercised in the West Indies at Montezumas Temple in
Mexico, the Spanish histories relate; nay, the madness it seems was so
universal, that even amongst our own Countrymen, the Britains here, Cruore
Captivo adolere aras, as Tacitus in Annal. 14. Pliny and others report, Sed de
Barbaris non est adeo mirandum; quorum, religio cum moribus congruit: Since,
even the Romans themselves, as much civilized as they boasted themselves to be,
suffered this brutish custom to prevail very long upon the world, for it
continued even to the time of the elder Pliny, when it was a usual thing upon
every finister event, Vid. Plin. l. 28. c. 1.

was with much difficulty at last redressed; albeir, these bloody Rites had
been long before prohibited by a solemn decree of the Sena^, Cornelius
Lentu^us, and Lucinius Crassus, being Coss. But to instance in what comes
nearest our Poet, we find in Marius against the Cymbryans, who sacrificed
Calphurnia his daughter, whom he had only promised in a dream, to obtain the
victory over that people. Certain it is, that the vow of Jeptha so rhetoricaly
related by Josephus out of Judges the 11. does exceedingly resemble this story,
and diverse other examples we could introduce of like barbarity, not only in
profane, but even the sacred story, particularly in the cruelty of the
perplexed King of Moab, the very sight whereof moved the enemy to raise the
siege, and give over the enterprise; and in what an horrible manner they used
to fry their little ones in the seventh receptacle of the Idol Moloch, Paulus
Fagius does somewhere describe, not much unlike to the Phalarian Bull. In the
present story it is very observable, that when Timantes a famous Painter, would
represent the Sacrifice of Iphigenia, whilst he expressed Chalcas, Ulysses,
Menelaus, and the rest of the Spectators with very sad and lugubrous
countena^ces, to show that the grief of her afflicted father ( quoniam summum
illum luctum penicillo non posset imitari (as Cicero very ^legantly in Orat.)
could by no Art of the Pencil be counterfeited, most ingeniously drew Agamemnon
with a vail over his face. But I will enlarge no farther on this sad argument,
illustrable by a volume of like examples, if I would give my self leave to
stroy, and weary the Reader; only as touching the Trivian Altar, whereon this
Cruelty is said to be perpetrated, because it was dedicated to Diana Casalius
in his ancient Egyptian Rites, cap. 20. thinks it to be Isis, taken frequently
for the Moon, whom they Hieroglyphiz'd with an head furnished with a triple
ornament of Horns, a Crown and Ears, and possent haec tria signa (says he)
denotare, quod Isis, sive Luna Trivia and Tergemina seu triformis sit
nuncupata. And this shall suffice,

Tutemet a nobis jam quovis tempore vatum
Terriloquis victus dict^^s desciscere quaeres.
Quippe etenim quam multa tibi me fingere possum
Somnia, --
Thy self (so long) with Poets frightful lies
Overcome, wilt our opinion soon despise,
How many dreams yet could I to thee feign? etc.
As if he should have said, these doting Fables of the Poets, such were the
stories of Cerberus, Acheron, Tantalus, Titius, Sicyphus, etc. have so
strangely possessed you; and the truth is, I my self were capable to dash all the
precious enjoyments, that (...), repose and tranquillity of thy life, were it my
design to pursue those terriculamenta and old-wives fables. Nor indeed, says
he, do men without reason believe them, and are become thus superstitious,
whil^st they remain so ignorant of the nature and essence of their Souls, which
they suppose to be Immortal, and yet know not what will become of them
hereafter; viz. Whether all their miseries shall determine in this world or
not; for indeed Epicurus totally denied the Immortality of this precious
Particle; and it is prodigious to consider only the wonderful variety of men's
opinions concerning it: For (to take but a sh^re survey) some, as the Stoics,
held, that the Soul did insinuate into the body) with which it was congenial,
and that per traducem. Aristotle of old, and Senertus of late, were favorers of
this tradition, as if grated from the souls of the Parents, it only lurked in
semine, by which argument it cannot be preserved from perishing and expiring
together with them. D'escartes Method.
The same Author will have some parts of the Soul, which reside in corporeal
receptacles, to live and expire with them, and in the mean time, that the
Intellect (which enjoys no instrument of the body as perpetual) is separated
from that which is corruptible. This notion, I confess, is hugely controverted.
Alexander Aphrodiseus peremptorily affirms, that he has hereby rendered the
soul mortal; and yet it is thought that Gregory Nazianzen favored this opinion:
But against these is Plato; and of the Christians, Tho: Aquinas, a stout
Aristotelean, who interprets the opinion altogether in favor of Immortality;
yet Averroes, another Commentator upon this Prince of Philosophers, supposes
that every man has a peculiar soul which is mortal, distinguished from the
Mind, Arnob. adver. G^nt.
which he calls immortal. The Platonists, Pherecydes, and old Academiques
believed, that the soul did precede the body eternally.

Crates the Theban admitted of no Soul, ascribing only a natural motion to
bodies: There are none of the Elements but some have fetched the soul from. The
great Hyppocrates will have it a tenuous spirit, diffused through the body.
Asclepiades says plainly, it is Flesh. Zeno makes it to be a quintescence, or
certain quality and complexion of the Elements. Chrysippus, Archelaus and
Heraclytus Ponticus taught, that it was light. Nor are they at all agreed about
the residence thereof; for some place it in the head, others in the heart,
(...), as Diagoras. Epicurus in the stomach: And there be, who will assign it
no dwelling at all, but a thing secluded from any determinate fixure; for of
this conceit, I find Xenophanes, Colophonius, Aristoxenes, and many others:
and hence it is (I suppose) that Xenocrates terms the Soul an automote-Number,
which is conformable to what the Chaldeans taught of old, when they named it a
Virtue void of any determinate form, receptive yet of all heterogenious forms.
Aristotle happily stamped his Entelechia, to express the perfection of a
natural Organick-body, potentia vitam habentis, etc. Nor indeed were the
Heathen the only men who dissented about this Speculation: The most learned
Origin and others, conceived that the Soul of the first man assumed its
original with the Celestial Creatures, and make it more ancient then the body.
Some there were, fancied, that one Soul produced another, as one body
procreates another; of which opinion was Apollinaris Bishop of Laodicea,
Tertullian, Cyrillus, and Luciferanus. who are all mainly oppugned by S.
Hierom. The forecited T. Aquin. affirms, that there is a quo^idian creation
of Souls; for that (says he) it is the form of the body, and cannot have a
separate creation: And to this opinion the Schools, and many later Divines have
generally assented, amongst whom, our Countreyman Occam affirms, that there be
two Souls in every man, the Sensitive of the Parent, and the Intellective of
the Creator: But others again confound them both together, and will admit of no
distinction: In fine, those who think they have nearest approached the truth
(besides such as ingenuously confess they understand it not (for such I find
Seneca in Lactantius to have been) will have the Soul to be a certain Divine
Substance, entire, indivisible, omnipresent to the parts, and depending only
upon the virtue of the Agent, and not of any matter. Of this opinion (besides
sundry others) were Plutarch, Porphyrie, Vide Tert. c. 15. de Anima. Cic. Tusc.
q. 1. Aristox. music. l. 3. Harmonic. Lact. de divin. praemio. l. 7. Mat. 22.
23. Josephus. Hieron. Ovid.
Timeus, Zoroastes, Hermes Trismegistus, Orpheus, etc. To conclude, the more
sollid define it to be a Substance, or certain modus of the Body, an Attribute,
etc. not produced by any Seminal Traduction, but by a Divine and Spiritual
emanation. Cicero in his 1. Tusc. Qu. tells us of one conceited fellow (we have
already named him) who denied that there was any soul at all, or at least, no
more then was in a Fiddle, comparing the Chords and Consent of the Instrument,
to the members and nerves of the body: quo nihil dici delirius potest. And then
about the continuance of the Soul, besides the Saduces, Democritus, our Poet
and his Master, the Brachmani, Pythagorean-metempsycosists, Essens, and other
Speculative men, to abate the terror of death, and render their Disciples
courageous upon all adventures, though they denied the Immortality of the Soul
in the Christian notion, yet taught they a certain immorral Transmigration
thereof into the bodies of other creatures; of which Xenophanes, Timon,
Hermippus, Lucian, and diverse others have discoursed at large; nay, Jamblicus
with Trismegistus held, that the Souls depart not only from men to irrational
creatures, but from them to one another of the same kind; yea, that they
descend into Plants; of which conceit are many modern Jews, Vide Aonium
pasearium de an Immortal l. 1. Albo. l. 2. c. 12. See Luc. l. 1. Non tacitas
Erebi seeds, etc.
who talk of an Angel Turn-key to a certain Magazine of Spirits, ready created
for all the bodies that shall ever have being, which Guardian Intelligence they
call Intellectum agentem: but to quit these differences and Turco-Jewish
dreams, it is believed that the Poet Ennius (so exceedingly celebrated here by
our Poet) was the first that broached this Transmigration amongst the Latins;
who for all this tells us no news of either infernal places or pains,

Sed quaedam simulacra modis pallentia miris, etc.
But some pale frightful Spectrum's.

report, that being returned from Hell, and being demanded what he had
remaining of his knowledge: He should answer, that he remembered nothing but
pain. There are many other instances of Ghostly apparitions, by which we might
farther illustrate the certainty of the Souls Immortality. The Oracle of Apollo
Milesius is well known; nor were the Epicureans so obstinate, but that they
understood there was then an art of raising spirits. Sed quia non pervidebant
animae rationem, quae tam subtilis est, ut oculos humanae mentis eff^giat,
interire dixerunt: for it seems in this they went no farther then the eye: But
here we might introduce that of the Druids delivered by Caesar and Strab^, of
the Brachmani, whereof Porphyrie in his Book Prohibiting the eating of Flesh.
The same was affirmed likewise by the Egyptians, who for that very respect did
not burn their dead, eodemque cura and de infernis persuasio says Tacitus,
speaking there of the Jews; nor were the very Indians less religious, says
Strabo, where he discourses (...), of the Judgments in the other world; which
likewise it is reported those in America believed, pointing to certain places
beyond the mountains as to Elysian Fields, where those who had behaved
themselves well, kept eternal Revels, and enjoyed their repose. In all which I
find them to have been much better assured, and more confident then even many
great Philosophers; for having spoken something in favor thereof, (...), which
yet they are very cautious of overmuch pressing; Tusc. quest.
and it is evident, that Cicero exceedingly wavered therein, Praeclar^m autem
nescio quid adepti sunt quod dedic^runt se, cum tempus mortis venisset, totos
esse perituros: quod ut ita sit (nihil enim pugno) quid habet ista res aut
Laetabile, aut gloriosum? and as little assured was the Divine Seneca, Et
fortasse (says he) si modo sapientum verae fama est, recipitque nos locus
aliquis) quem putamus perisse, praemissus est. But to deliver this vast
controversy over to the Divines, as touching the Immortality thereof,
Christians are sufficiently instructed; Vide Aonii ^alcarii de A^: ^m^^ort.
Carmina.
and mere Rationalists as sollidly convinced in that learned and renowned Piece
of the honorable Sir K. Digby. It remains only, that we now close with, and
qualify the opinion of our Poet, who where he treats on this subject, intends
only (a^ is conjectured) the material soul, not the Intellectual, which he
imagined to be corporeal, as consisting of certain concurrent terse and smoth
Atoms, not much different from those whereof he makes fire to proceed;
Corporibus parvis and levibus atque rotundis; which being reduced into a
tenuous and delicate Substance, See Plat. 3. de placit. 4.
easily diffuse^h it self throughout the whole mass, actuating and furnishing
it with all its passions, motions, and faculties, as might be demonstrated more
clearly from certain passages in the third Book of our Abstruse Author, who, if
(whilst he thought to plant repose and recollection in the minds of men) he
believed there was in earnest no Hell, or other entertainment of the separated
spirits; nor therefore respects to be had to the Gods, it undoubtedly proceeded
from that infinite plurality of Deities, Idols, and abused fancies of the
times, which really to a natural man might exceedingly qualify the scandal
which he took at the Religion of his times: for let us but suppose one of our
wisest men to have received his education with our Poet, would he (can we
imagine) have more believed the existence of so many Gods and Goddesses, born
of the Heavens, Earth, and Seas, then Epicurus, who derided Pan, and the rest
of those santastick Romances? Or is it reasonable to entertain harder thoughts
of Lucretius, then of those who so brutishly sacrificed unto them? Cicer^
impleads C. Verres, of adultery, and yet does his devotions to Jupiter, who
filled both heaven and earth with his desbaucheries. Deorum stupra. Euripides*
The truth is, the Salians and Priests of Cybele, were not a jot more veritable
in their strange Religion, and prodigious superstitions, notwithstanding
Leucippus, Empedocles, Epicurus, and our Poet have so handsomely derided them,

Qua propter been cum superis de rebus habenda
Nobis est ratio; Solis, Lunaeque meatus
Qua siant ratione; and qua vi quaeque geruntur
In terris, etc.
This so, we'll first inquire of things above,
The Reasons how the Sun and Moon do move.
By what force all things on the earth are swayed.
Since therefore so it is, that by reason of an Epidemical ignorance in natural
causes, men are become so stupid, and remain thus misetably pe^pl^xt, we are
resolved (proceeds Lucret^us) to take a general survey both of heaven and
earth, to treat of the essence of the soul, and what it is which makes us so
much afraid awake or sleeping; as when we dream of people long since departed.
In sum, Vid. Lact. de opific. dei. Lib. Latet autem men's oppressa somno, etc.
his design is to interpret the universal nature of things, and justify the
Title of his work, which yet he confesses is a task very difficult to
undertake in his native language, nothing so copious and artificial as the
scientifick and extensive Greek.

Multa novis verbis praesertim cum fit agendum,
Propter egestatem linguae, and rerum novitatem, etc.
And principally since there is so much
New terms requires, the novelty being such
Of the matter, of our tongue the poverty.
And therefore might sometimes be well allowed to coin a word for his need: L.
3. de finibus and ad Manil.
cum uteretur in lingua copiosa factis tamen nominibus, ac novis, quod nobis in
hoc inopi lingua non concedit^r, etc. as Cato in Cicero explains it.

And yet so great was his affection and friendship to his Patron Memmius, that
there should no difficulty discourage a resolution to present him with a Scheme
and Cycle of Philosophy, as clear and manifest as the beams of the very Sun it
self.

Res quibus occultas penitus, convisere possis:
Hunc igitur terrorem animi tenebrasque necesse est, and^.
By whose bright rays thou may both specula^e
Nature, and her deep secrets penetrate;
Dark fears of mind then banish quite away,
Not with the Sunbeams, or the light of day,
But by such species as from nature flow,
And what from right informed reason grow.
And indeed it is a great truth, (...). The Superstitious man is religious and
fainthearted. Away therefore (cries he) with those vain apprehensions, primus
in orb deos timor fecit, the considerations of death, and hypochondriack fits
of discomposed persons; this we will effect, not by the aid of the Sun beams,
the Lamp of day, or a superficial view of things; but the study Physilogie and
Natural Reason, in which the Epicureans believed to consist the perfection and
very top of all humane felicity; for Inest in eadem explicatione naturae (says
the Orator) insatiabilis quaedam e cognoscendis rebus voluptas, in qua una
(without either dread of death, or the troubles of Devotion, quod Epicuro
videtur, as a little before) confectis rebus necessariis, vacui negotiis,
honest, ac liberaliter poss^mus vivere.

Hunc igitur terrorem animi -- etc. which verse he frequently repeateth in the
second, third, and sixth Books; for indeed it was his great Masters doctrine,
(...), etc. Si nihil conturbaret nos, quod suspicamur, veremurque ex rebus
sublimibus; Diog. Laert. in vita Epic. l. 10.
neque item, quod ex ipsa morte, ne quando nimirum ad nos pertineat aliquid: ac
nosse praeterea possemus qui germani fines, dolorum atque cupiditatum sint.
What then? (...), we should all be perfect Physiologers, and emerge knowing men
indeed. The Theory and Contemplation whereof, Gordiano Bru. del Infinito
universo in Epist. proemiali. His terroribus ab Epicuro soluti non metuimus
Deos. Cic. l. de Not. deorum.
makes the rational (it may be) more then religious Bruno, break out into these
expressions, Dalla qual contemplatione ( viz. that of Nature) auverra, che
nullo strano accidente, ne dismetta perdogla o timore, etc ne estogla, etc. --
onde haremo la via vera alla vera immortalita saremo magnanimi, spreggiatori di
quel che fanciulleschi pensieri qui Dei che il cieco volgo adora, perch
dovenerremo very contemplatori dell historia de la Natura -- etc. And a little
after, not being able to contain his Ecstasies, Eccone dunque, etc. Behold us
then indeed, beyond the power of Envy, free from the anxiety of breathing after
a good (as at a great distance from us) which we even already possess so near
our own doors. Is not this the very voice and hands of our Carus? For hence it
comes to pass (pursues our Poet) that when men behold things, the reasons
whereof exceed their slender capacity, Lucr. l. 6.


-- Fieri divino Numine rentur, etc.
To a Celestial Author they are ass^gn'd, etc.
Whereas indeed, the Gods (says he) are little concerned with it. But this
has been sufficiently illustrated and confuted.

And hitherto has our Carus prepared only the mind of his Memmius, and in
him the Reader to assent to his Principles, which in the following Periods he
now propounds; and first,

-- Nihil posse creari
De nihilo --
That Naught of Naught can be, etc.
This Aristotle has cleared in his first Book of Physics, to which there has
been since an universal consent; for that it should be otherwise, quis hoc
Physicus dixit unquam? says Cicero; De divinit. l. 2.
and how Aristotle, and all that have since reverenced his dictates de^end this
Argument, every Sophister can tell. The subsequent verses of Lucretius were
almost the very expressions of Epicurus; for if every thing had uncertain
principles, (...), etc.

Fierent ex omnibus rebus
Omne genus nasci posset: nihil semine egeret.
For if of nothing formed, no use of seed,
Since every sort would from all things proceed.
Nor needed there any stated seasons for the production of things, Vid. Lact.
delra dei.
but we should pluck the blushing rose, and gather the delicious fruits, as
well in the midst of the cold winter, as in the flowery spring, and pregnant
Autumn. Our children and young suckers should immediately become tall men, and
overgrown trees, since there would arise no cause of any delay or retardation,
if things thus sprung from Nothing. But now (says he) Natura non facit saltum,
she is not so hasty, all things operate gradually, and augment by little and
little from their peculiar and specifying seeds or Atoms, which do first
require a convenient space, and a very happy chance, before they can propagate
and encounter,

Huc accedit, uti sine certis imbribus anni
Laetificos nequeat fetus summittere tellus:
N^^ porro, etc. --
So that unless some Annual showers descend,
The Earth no fruits to humane use can lend,
Nor Animals, etc.
For all seeds would putrify in the bowels of the earth, nothing could sprout;
or in case it did ever appear above ground, would immediately wither and
dwindle away to nothing. If things proceeded from nothing, they would likewise
need as little to assist them; Sine Cerere and Libero friget Venus; if they
receive no nourishment, neither can they propagate; and if things result from
Nothing, they clearly need it not; or admit it could be so, Aen. 3.
Why then has not Nature produced us more races of the Giants, such as the
Poet has seigned the Cyclopean breed, that could stalk over the sea, and of
lives like Methusala, Artephius, or the wandering Jew? since in Nature there
could be no defect why these prod^ctions should happen so rarely: nor indeed
any definite magnitude or duration of Natural things, if men sprung thus of
Nothing; wherefore upon evidence of the contrary, he concludes, That things
have as well their principles, as words their Elements whereof they be
composed. Lastly,

-- Quoniam incultis praestare videmns
Culta loca, and manibus meliores reddier fetus;
Quae nos, etc.
Since then rich fields surpass the Barren ground,
Which culture makes in choicer fruits abound.
For if it were not so, as good fruits might grow in Greenland, and under the
Polar Star, as in Peru nor would there be any further need of manuring the
earth; all which we find to be most experimentally false.

These, with some other, were the Arguments which the School of Epicurus had
furnished, to prove that Nothing could result out of Nothing. And indeed to a
mere natural (though never so discerning) man, 'twere a truth undeniable,
according to the course of Nature, I say, and the ordinary constitution of
things which are generated by motion or transmutation; but to us that are
taught to confess the Omnipotency of the great Lord of Nature, it is nothing
difficult to believe how something was first made by simple Emanation; that is,
by Creation. Voluntas Dei (says S. Aug.) est causa Coeli and terrae: 2 Cor. 4.
6.
God educed light out of the obscurity which involved the Chaos; which was
certainly created immediately out of Nothing; for it had no means proportional
to it; and of what materials the Glorified Spirits were made (setting aside the
Rabbinical conceits) it is no where apparently delivered us. Clearly therefore,
God created the world out of the praeexistent Chaos, and that Chaos or matter
of Tohu, nothing; as it is excellently and elegantly expressed by Lactantius,
against that of Cicero and Seneca, De Orig. Error. lib. 2.
which I would here recite at large, were it not already done to my hand,
though long since the writing of these Animadversions, by an ingenious person,
treating upon this subject out of Gassendus.

And thus Lucretius having finished his Argument, assumes the following, That
as Nothing proceeds of Nothing, so is Nothing annihilated.

Huc accedit, uti quaeque in sua Corpora rursum
Dissolvat natura, neque ad nihilum interimat res.
Add unto this, Nature to their first state
Does all dissolve, Nothing annihilate.
Which Persius thus expresses, Sat. 3.


De Nihil, Nihil, in Nihilum, Nil posse reverti:
For he held them to be solid, simple and permanent; therefore since they never
reverted into their first principles, it is evident, says he, that of them
they consisted. Besides, if we admit them reducible to nothing, what should
hinder their instantaneous destruction, which might undoubtedly annihilate them
without the least force or cause given them; for in Nothing, as there is no
action, so neither is there resistance, nor any delay of time at all, which
might impede their instantaneous discomposure; all which the leisurely failing,
and minute decay of things does experimentally oppugn.

Praeterea, quaecunque vetustate amovet aetas,
Si penitus perimit, consumens materiem omnem:
Vnde animale genus generatim in Lumina vitae
Red^lucit Venus? --
Beside, what things are with their ages past,
If time did kill, and all their matter wast,
Whence does sweet Venus give to souls new birth
Through all their kinds? --
As if he should say, how is it possible that Generation, Alteration,
Augmentation and supply of things, should succeed in the world, if things thus
annihilate; for both the Seas, Rivers and fountains had been long ere this
dried up, and utterly exhausted. Beside,

-- Vnde ether sidera pascit?
Stars, how are they nourished in the skies?
Whence that of Virgil -- Polus dum sidera pascet. Aen. 1.
For we must understand that some Philosophers, as Cleanthes Anaximander,
Dionysius, Epicurus and diverse others, supposed these Celestial bodies to
receive nourishment from the thinner and more subtle part of the air named
ether; as in this place our Poet from terrene evaporations and exhalations of
the Sea: And therefore it is very pretty what some conceited, that the oblique
motion which the Sun observed from one Tropique to another, was only to find
out drink and humor wherewithal to refresh his extreme thirst; as if he were
some African Tiger, hunting out the springs of the parched deserts; which
opinion albeit Aristotle seems to deride; yet says Cicero, Cum sol and ingens
sit, De Not. Deor.
Oceanique alatur humoribus, quia nullus ignis sine pastu aliquo possit
permanere: necesse est aut ei similis sit igni, quem adhibemus ad usum atque
victum: aut ei, qui corporibus animantium continetur (it follows) probabile^,
igitur est praestantem intelligentiam in sideribus esse, quae and aetheream
mundi partem incolant, and marinis, terrenisque humoribus longo intervallo
extenuatis alantur. For to omit the drunken Catch in Anacre^n, (...), etc. it is
very evident, that (besides the sore-rehearsed) Seneca was of this faith, as
may be collected out of his sixth Book of Not. quaest. c. 16. and Plutarch in
Libello de Iside; as also Pliny in hist. Not. l. 2. c. 9. Sydera vero haud
dubie humore terreno pasci etc. which albeit our Schools deny, as in relation
to the Earth, yet some excellent modern Inquirers are very magisterial, that
the warers above the Convexity of the heavens perform it; of which opinion I
find our Countryman Lydiat, in his praelect. Astronom. and Book de origin
fontium, c. 10. and of later date our Cabbalistical and ingenious Moor; as if
by this means ( viz a Percolation through those glorious bodies) a continual
supply of Air for the furniture of Nature were derived. Patritius de Coelor.
numero, l. 12.
To which doctrine (I conceive) may appositely be cited those conceits of the
Rabbis, and some ancient Philosophers who attribute Animum and Intellectum,
nay the very members and discourse of men to them; as Albubechar fancies in lib
Chai Beu Ikthan, part. 5. and R. Moses Maimon de fundamentis legis, c. 3. But
to let these pass as to the nourishment from hence, that the Sun (not Stars) is
really a material fire, and has a sufficient and never-failing pabulum from
its own substance and body, See Hevelius Selenogr. Scheiner in Rosa Vrsina. l.
4. Fr. Patritius, l. 19. Reita a Talleacotio in Meteorol. l. 1. de Met^^ign. c.
10.
I nothing at all doubt; and of which there might be more said, if we had
arrived to the fifth Book of our present Author, whilst the following Argument
serves only to press the solidity and immortality of his unimpeachable
Principles; and that even those Bodies and Concretes which are composed of
them, remain likewise safe, till some force competent and proportionable to
this their composition and texture arrive. Lastly,

-- Pereunt imbres, ubi eos pater ether
In gremium matris terrai praecipitavit, etc.
Those showers which Heaven father-like does send
Down on our Mother Earth, there seem to end.
The late Nardius Syllogizes thus, If there be any thing in the world which
seems totally to perish and annihilate, it is a shower of rain, which
descending into the bowels of the Earth, is never after seen any more; because
it is drunk up by her many thirsty jaws: but yet after a while, we behold it
springing up again into a thousand varieties, and natural productions in a most
wonderful manner. Ergo, Cuncta suos ortus repetunt, matremque requirunt.
There is nothing undoubtedly perishes, but one thing supplies the other, and
by this circulation; as Virgil speaks of the Serpentine year, -- In se sua per
Vestigia volvitur annus. Geor. 2.

It treads in the same steps again; the Ocean is replenished by the Rivers, the
Earth by the dissolution and reversion of those bodies which derive their
original and nutrition from her; nay Death it self does not so destroy bodies,
-- Vt materiai
Corpora conficiat, sed coe^um dissipat ollis.
To use our Poets expression in the following Book; or as the Tragoedian has
best expounded it, Eurip.


-- Genitum nihil emoritur
Sed transpositum ultro citroque See Macrobius, l. 2. c. 12. de some. Scip.

Formam priorem alterat,
-- Nothing that is born does dye,
But being transposed here, and there
Another form and shape does bear.
So that the Species are still preserved by a continual succession of new
Individuals, and every portion of every Element immediately transmutable into
their contiguous and next-neighboring. Infinite more might be added to this
Argument, but I conceive what we have said sufficient to prove, that there is
nothing which does penitus perire.

Quando aliud ex alio reficit natura; nec ullam
Rem gigni patitur, nisi morte adjuta aliena.
Since Nature one thing from another makes,
Nor is there ought indeed which she supplie^
Without the aid of something else that dies.
All things in this world, aut corvi sun^^t Cadavera, as Petronius with a
little alteration: for so concludes the Poet, and so the Divine, ut Deus ex
nihilo contra rationis and naturae leges cuncta creavit: ita in nihilum abire
rerum creatarum aliqua nunquam potest, nisi contra rationis naturaeque leges
per supernaturalem Dei potentiam fiat. Which opinion I remember the reverend D.
Hackwel (who has said all that can be produced on this very Argument) thus
confirms, Apol. l. 5. p. 159.
That as Almighty God proceeded in the works of the Creation, by bringing the
world from nothing to something without means; so no doubt but he may, and in
all likelihood will, without means reduce it from something to nothing, that so
the end may in all points hold correspondency with the beginning, and both be
known to be his immediate work.

Ne qua forte tamen coeptis diffidere dictis:
Q^od nequeunt oculis rerum primordia cerni, etc.
Least yet thou should my Arguments diffide
Because that Elements cannot be spied
By humane eyes -- etc.
For our Poet, notwithstanding all this, jealous lest his Reader might be
scandalized at his assertion, because the Principles he so much contends for,
consist of things altogether invisible, readily produces an instance from the
winds, and the effects thereof; which though they consist indeed of Atoms
altogether inconspicuous to our weak organs, yet do their monstrous effects
(which he there compares to that of precipitating Rivers and Cataracts, which
have violated their banks, and spoiled the adjacent places) prove them to be
bodies. All which he does most elegantly express, imitated by that of the
inimitable Virgil,

-- Aut rapidus montano flumine torrens
Sternit agros, Aen. 2.
Sternit sata laeta, boumque labores, etc.
As when a raging torrent rushes down
Lodges the Corn and Plowmens toil does drown.
For indeed incredible it is what such Euroclydons, Turbo's and Whirlwinds can
perform, when (as the same Poet expresses it)

Vna Eurusque Aen. 1. and: Luc. l. 5.
Notusque ruunt creberque procellis
Africus and vastos volvunt ad littora fluctus.
East, South; South-west-winds, rushing at once roar
In fearful gusts-huge billows roll to th'shore.
And that the Cardinals meet together. I shall not need to assemble many
accidents of the power of winds, those that have been on the Deep have there
beheld it; and whosoever has read of the Prester or Hurocan that happened at
Naples, See Sir F. D. redivivus.
Anno 1343. or the tranfrentation of our renowned Drake through the Streights
of Magellan into the South Sea, may imagine such a description of a storm, as I
think was never before recorded in any History. But to show what the winds can
do at Land as well as at Sea, and that nearer home, Jo. Stow in the life of W.
Rufus, reports for a certain, that in the year 1095. it overthrew at London no
less then 600 houses, and blew off the roof of Bow-Church, which, together with
its vast beams and timber-work, flew like so many feathers in the air, to so
incredible an height, that six of them, being 27 foot in length, with their
fall pitched themselves 23 foot deep in the Streets (which lay then unpaved) a
thing almost exceeding belief; and yet certainly this wind was no otherwise
seen then by its terrible effects. Those who are curious of more instances of
this nature, Olaus Magnus l. 1. c. 4, 5.
may consult Olaus Magnus his Northern Hist. lib. 1. de Vehementia Venti
Circii, and De Septentrionalium Ventorum violentia, etc. Plato in his Timaeo
(who composeth all things of tetrahedrical and hexahedrical Corpuscles) will
have us to conceive these puissant principles so small, thin, and minute, that
they remain altogether (...), indiscernable, except when they are aggregated of
many, as we may imagine them to be in a mountain, where their angles are of
another cut. And in like sort our Poet here in the following instances of
Odors, Heat, Cold, the penetration of the voice, etc.

Quae tamen omnia corporea constare necesse est
Natura; quoniam sensus impellere possunt.
Which of corporeal nature yet consist,
For they the Sense affect it is manifest.
But to proceed,
Tangere enim and tangi, nisi corpus, nulla potestres.
Touch and be Touched, naught save a body may.
This was a Proposition established by Epicurus; and the tenent is so
Catholic, Ar. 4. Phys.
that no Philosopher ever made doubt of it; viz. as it is a contact of two
bodies, secundum superficiem, by which the sensation is made. Our Poet goes on
to illustrate his former assertion, by the insensible evaporation of moisture
in wet cloth, or sails displayed in the Sun: as also by the curious decrement
of such things as we continually touch and handle: such are rings long worn
upon our fingers, and stones wasted by the frequent and uncessant distillation
of water, according to that old one, Gutta cavat Lapidem, Ovid.
non vi, sed saepe cadendo.
Iron it self, and paved ways diminish by the perpetual use; nay, our very
delicate and softer kisses make impressions on the hardest Figures of Brass and
Metal; For they used to place Statues in the Porches before their houses.
Hence Seneca, Non facit nobilem atrium plenum fumos^s imaginibus: animus est
qui facit nobilem. And Martial, Atriaque immodicis artat imaginibus.
Over which they had also their Titles or Pedigrees engraven, Vt eorum virtutes
posteri non solum legerent, verum imitarentur. Valerius. l. 5. c. 8. And then
for the touching of them, it was by kissing them, as Cicero in Verrem. l. 5,
speaking of that rare Statue of Hercules in brass. And Lipsius Electorum, l, 2.
citing this of our Author --

-- Tum portaes propter, aena
Signa, -- etc. --
Says, Saepe etiam eminus osculabantur: porrecta manu. What reverence they
bore them, may also be gathered from that passage in Minutius his Octavius. And
it seems it was a custom, that those who went out of the Cities, and returned
into them, were used to salute the Images of their Gods (which were frequently
placed at the Gates of great Towns) with a ki^^* and indeed, wheresoever they
saw them. The like did they to the Effigies of their Patrons, placed over their
Palaces, which their Sycophants used to kiss and complement as often as they
went in and out: of which manner of saluting, Martial in Epist. l. 4. somewhere
takes notice of; and Alciat in his (...) juris, l. 8. c. 10. in imitation
whereof, peradventure the Arms or Statues of the Cardinal Patron is to this day
in Rome so frequently placed over every Favorites Gate. And as for the
impression which kisses make, I my self have seen at Rome, and other places,
superstitious Devota's even wear the very marbles of reputed Holy Places and
Shrines with the often kissing and touching them, particularly the Scala Santa
near St. Jo* de Laterano, etc. And this I rather take to be the meaning of this
place, then that they should be Rings, Knockers, or other Ornaments of Doors
and Gates, as Nardius seems to interpret.

But as things wear thus insensibly away by decrement, so do they also as
strangely delude our curiosity by Increment and Augmentation. Touching which
Additionals, as we perceive not how we our selves decay, become lean, and
consume; so neither do we discover how we grow tall and burnish; nor how trees
shoot up to that monstrous height and bulk; and particularly, that as the
corrosive sal^ness of the Ocean frets away the very rocks in some places; so in
other again, the stones and quaries themselves do manifestly increase: as may
be seen in a certain Well in Somersetshire called Ochy-holle, the petri^ying
Well at Knaresborow near York, Vide Hevernium. H. ab Here Is. Dr Jordan. Maginum.
Boetium. etc.
in many parts of Derby-shire, and as I my self have beheld in the Cave
Goutiere near Tours in France, from which rock I brought away many morsels
which the water had augmented, superinducing a viscid calculous humor, or
matter like scales, or new coa^s upon them, through the uncessant trickling of
a cold spring, very ^ar in the bowels of the earth, to which we were lighted by
torches. Not to omit those stately pillars of the high Altar in St.
Chrysogono's Church at Trastevere in Rome, which seeming to have been formed of
the purest oriental alabaster, the Friars assured us were made of conjealed
water, accidentally found in an old Aquaeduct, amongst whose ruins they were
digging. I could readily produce other instances of this nature. But that Rocks
and Stones themselves grow, and daily increase, I think no Philosopher can
doubt. Those extravagant shells, and pretty curiosities which we find in the
very ^^trails of some of them broken, do (methinks) evidently discover that
they were sometimes enclosed in a softer and less copious matter.

Now the cause of this Petrifying property, is a stonyjuice; for the water
which contains the Seeds of so many things, that of stones does especially
coagulate therein, producing those wonderful varieties which we daily
encounter: some diaphanous and transparent, other dull and opake, according to
the purity or impurity of that lapidescent humor (and the vapors) which happ^ns
to subside in their Matrixes and Cavities wherein they are hardened by the Sun
and the Air: And hence it is, that they have observed the reason why diverse
Insects, Leaves, Straws, and the like, are so frequently found even in the very
bodies of stones: an admirable collection whereof is showed (amongst other
Rarities) by Signor Rugini an Illustris. of Venice. Thus it chances that many
Plants, and pieces of Wood, nay Fishes, Beasts, and even Men themselves (
Niobe-like) have been sometimes found Metamorphosed, and plainly Lapidescere
(subeunte puriore humore) insinuating its lapidious particles into the pores of
such substances, by which they become in time so united to them, that they do
even induere Lapideam naturam. For indeed the principia soluta of all things
are in a liquid form, however in stones they become so exceedingly concrete; as
was curiously observed by Jo: Brunus the French Chyrurgeon mentioned in vita
Peireskii, L. 4 p. 250.
who having taken three stones from a child, the first that came was
altogether hard, the second soft, but the last almost fluid, and little more
consistent then a jelly; which yet, after a few days, became as hard as the
rest: Not to repeat what is there spoken also of the flexible Whetstone,
mentioned by the same Author, etc. And thus it is (without question) that those
innumerable quantities of stones are engendered upon many Plains and places
(especially such as are obnoxious to slimy Inundations) which gathered off
never so industriously, are yet within a short time covered as plentifully with
them again, receiving their variety of form by their receptacles, volutation,
detrition, and often breakings, whilst their matter (as we affirmed) was not
yet arrived to that perfect concretion it afterward attained,

Corporibus caecis igitur natura gerit res.
Nature with bodies then unseen to the eye,
All things does manage --
With which our Carus concludes this present Argument.

We are now arrived to that great Vacuum, which has for so many ages exercised
the pens and enquiries of the most refined spirits; but in order to the end
proposed by our Poet, it will not be irrequisite, that something were first
spoken concerning Atoms: And indeed there was long since this, and much more
prepared to have been delivered upon this occasion, and some others which of
necessity will follow it; yet since there are lately extant so many ample
volumes upon the subjects, some of them not strangers to our tongue, I should
totally have forborne to repeat (as I will only touch them)* could the frame of
this discourse (which has so long slept by me) have supported so considerable
an imperfection as the total omission of saying something would have amounted
to.

The first that brought this Doctrine into credit was Leucippus, Vide Gal. in
hist. Philosophica.
I say, before Democritus, as Plutarch, Laertius, Tully, and others affirm; so
that even Aristotle tells us, the opinion was exceeding rife in his time: Now
as Epicurus from those, so our Poet from Epicurus has constituted them for the
very (...) Principles, and incompositas of all Natural things whatsoever. I am
clearly of opinion, that the Pythagorean (...), or unites, were near of kin to
these Atoms: (...), something insecable it was, indissoluble, and perfectly
sollid. Nomen ex a privativa particula and (...) divido. Tam min. ta ut nulla
sit acies ferri tam subtilis, quasecari, ac dividi possint. Lact. de Ira dei.
And yet by the way, we must not conceive (as many have dream^) that they
consisted of points so nicely indivisible, as it they retained no magnitude at
all; but such rather as in respect of their strict compactedness, no force
whatsoever is able to separate, non quod, minima, sed quod non possit dividi;
(...); and therefore that which is taught of the (...), or Materia prima by the
Schools, as to the incorruptibility thereof, we may safely suppose concerning
these, with this only difference, That Epicurus determines into what nature
their resolutions fix; viz. ad insectilia Corpuscula, or Atoms, which none of
the Peripatetikes have any where described touching their Principles. But then
again, That these Elements should be thus (...), the very original of all
things whatsoever, as is the seed of Animals, seems in truth, something
difficult to admit. Lact. l. 2. c. 9. Plutarch. de plac. phil. l. 2 c 4. De die
Natali. c. 3. Archilaus phys Avicen, etc.
For Epicurus held, that even Man himself sprung at first out of the womb of
our common Mother the Earth, and ^ater, olerum more, and out of the
Parsley-bed, as we say, like the productions of the Cadmean teeth, or rather
after the manner that the monsters of the mud of Nilus, Mushrums, and other
fungous excrescences arise, as Censorinus and others recite.

Crescebant uteri terrae radicibus apti. So our Poe^, l* 5.
That of Diogenes Laertius in Democrito, (...), etc. that Void and Atoms were
the Principles of all things (which makes Leucippus, Plutarch, Cicero, and the
rest seem, as it were, to deliver that these two were the very Elementa rerum
generalium) is upon no hand to be so understood, since we are only to receive
Atoms upon this account, to which Vacuum affords nothing besides place and
discrimination. For albeit indeed we find it mixed with all bodies, yet we are
in no wise to admit it as any constituent part of them, and therefore Plutarch
wittily expresses Corpus by (...)* and Inane by (...), as if he would have
said, 1. adu. Colot.
abody is something, void nothing: which sense, we must be sure to carry about
us throughout the Poet. In the mean time there is a middle and more probable
opinion, as some conceive, who allowing of no such Atoms, pitch upon
Insensible parts infinitely divisible, which being u^ited with many, become
sensible. Now to proceed how these Atoms were fancied to be hurried about in
that immense inanity, wherein was neither extreme, top, middle, nor any bound;
how some of them being light, some sharp, others round, angular, crooked, etc.
fell into that goodly form of the heavens and earth, by a certain fortuitous
coition, encounter, and happy concourse we shall demonstrate more at large in
its proper place; having here only cleared the meaning of the notion, whilst
we proceed with our Poet; who that we may the better comprehend it, tells us
first, that there is

-- In rebus inane
Quod tibi cognosse in multis erit utile rebus, etc.
-- A Void in things
Which rightly to conceive much profit brings.
Seeing there would else want room* for his established Principles to move in.
This therefore our Poet signifies frequently by the name of Locus, Place; not
as Logicians understand that term, where we never encounter it without a body,
but conceive it as absolutely devoid of body, as the Principles or Atoms
themselves are sollid, compact, and without the least imaginable vacu^ty*
Aristotle names it (...), the space of body, we may happily English it Room.

Qua propter locus est intactus, inane, vacansque
Quod si non esset, nulla ratione moveri
Res possint, etc. --
-- Therefore there is a place
Intangible and void, else in no case
Could ought be moved, etc. --
If there be motion, there must of necessity be a void; for so Epicurus
Syllogizes, (...), etc. nor were it otherwise possible that a body could
subsist in place already assumed, without the dislocation or thrusting some
other body out of the place pre-occupied and taken up, to salve the absurdity
of penetration; and therefore unle^s the first body recede to the succeeding,
there could be no such thing as any principle of motion or lation; neither
indeed could any thing proceed and stir any more, then those flints and
extravagant shells, which now and then are found in the very heart of huge
stones, and the entrails of the hardest rocks. Nor is it possible to relieve
this by any device of Rare or Fluxil nature (which some have contrived) unless
there be first admitted an intermixtion of inanity. Lucretius therefore most
industriously labors to fix this speculation in particular, to demonstrate that
unless we admit of Void, all things would be pressed, constipated, and so
wedged in on all parts, that they could not only not move at all, but there
would be no production of things, Local motion being a requisite so absolutely
indispensible to all generations whatsoever. Yea, so frequent is this inanity,
that even the most solid Concretes have no contexture without it; as he very
dexterously proves by the insinuation of moisture through the very rocks of the
most obdurat marbles: The diffusion of Nouriture, the congelation of obstinate
things; and lastly, by the strange penetration of voices: All which pass
through by those intercepta spatiola's and pores, which before we mentioned,

Nam si tantundem est in Lanae glomere, quantum
Corporum in plumbo est tantumdem pendere par est:
If in a ball of yarn the substance were
Equal with Lead, like weight it ought to bear.
Each body consisting of more or fewer Atoms and abounding more plentifully in
Void. The size proceeds from the various participation which it h^th of
naturally Ponderous Bodies, Salts, and Vacuum. For all this, some it seems
there were who maintained a Lation or bodily motion without Vacuum, and that by
a certain cession, as they termed it, which they endeavored to exemptifie in
the progress of Fishes: but our Carus more positive and constant to his
principle, therefore concludes, that,

Aut igitur motu privandum'st corpora quaeque*
Aut esse admistum dicendum'st rebus inane, etc.
-- Either we to bodies must allow
No motion, or mixed vacuum avow.
Touching which disseminated Vacu^m, and Inane spaces, the most learned Petrus
Gassendus makes a famous illustration, by the depressing of wheat in a Bushel,
whilst being crowded forwards with its particles, easily propels the more
aerial interstices; but above all, by that ingenious invention of the Wind-Gun,
which indeed does wonderfully elucidate this condensation and rarefaction in
bodies. I will not repeat the experiment, because the curious have read it in
his books, and every man may see it exactly translated by Dr. Charleton. And
for the water, which is the instance of our Poet, of what very forms those
Loculamenta and interspersed vacuities are therein, the same admirable
Gassendus does happily discover, by the proportion of Salts to such a quantity
of water as was only necessary to their dissolution, injecting those of
different figures, as the menstrue became sated with the former; whence it
might rationally be concluded, Vide D. Davison. Pyrotech. part. 4. de operat.
Chym. c. 30.
that there are in water receptacles of sundry forms, into which angular salts
adapted for those matrices, might possibly wedge in and insinuate themselves.
See this learned persons animad versions on the Doctrine of Epicurus, p. 173,
174, etc. where likewise the experiment of Tinctures is established on the
former. But our Poet proceeds by other instances,

Postremo duo de concursu corpora lata
Si cita dissiliant; nempe aer omne necesse est*
Inter corpora quod fiat, possidat inane.
Lastly, let two large bodies in cariere
Strike and recoil, Air needs must take up here
All that wide space of room that lies between.
Imagine two sollid or large Bodies butting and recoiling, necessary it is
(says he) that when they separate (be the space never so momentary) there
follow as sudden a succession of circumfluent air into the vacuum which was
made by this their hasty recoil; which air must enter leasurely, by degrees,
and not at the same instant that the bodies divide. Now if any shall object,
that this is not performed in relation to the vacuum, but by contraction and
condensation of the air, this absurdity will ensue, that what was before
granted to be full, must now be empty, and ( vice versa) what was empty, full:
and yet admit it yielded, that such a compression of the disjoined and laxed
parts of air might be effected; yet even that would be hugely distressed,
without admitting an interspersion of vacuum; for otherwise all things would be
full, solid, and mere bodies, whose property no ways admitting of penetration,
could not possibly suffer the least condensation. These one would think were
instances sufficiently pregnant to convince the obstinacy of a Peripatetick
Sophister, but so has custom hither to prevailed, that men will rather (with
Melissus in Aristotle) grant the whole Universe to be immovable, then once
admit the Postulatum of Vacuum. Some Philosophers have contrived how the
pulsion of one part impels the next, and that the next, etc. till the extremes
exceed its limits, as one circle in the water solicites another; or (by a
nearer resemblance) as when one thrusts from him a pole at the end next him,
the pole does at the same moment advance at the other; by all which
illustrations, one may clearly discern, that albeit they seem totally to abhor
a Vacuum in terms, yet they are compelled to admit of one in effect: After this
manner they will grant a concavity in the body of the air, which yet they affirm
to be repleate both of Spirits and Air. It were endless to pursue this
argument through all their evasions; but I would only deliver you (amongst
infinite others) that solitary Experiment described by the forecited Gassendus,
as he received it from a most ingenious Person, were it not also interpreted to
my hand, and set forth in a very perspicuous Diagramme. It shall suffice
therefore to reason, that the Mercury having encountered an equilibration and
subingression of aerie parts in those inanities and repulses of the air, when it
has met with an equal balance, the matter is of necessity hindered from
sinking any lower: For as Giovanni Bap. Hodierna in his learned Treatise of the
Pe^dant Cloud, Dove la for^a del motore ^strinseco contrapeza in equilibrio,
etc. where the strength of the extrinsick motor conterpoises in aequilibrio to
the inclination of that which is ponderous, the matter which is heavy will
continue immovable, both in relation to its descent and ascent. Now whether
what remains quit of the Mercury, infallibly prove this Thohu or Vacuum
contended for, I believe may seem difficult to refu^e; both the matter and the
glass being bodies so extraordinarily compact and close* I say, so little
porous, that even the most rectified spirits enclosed within either, preserve
themselves in extreme vigor, till the very vessel be it self consumed, In furno
Philospart. 5.
or else some other accident unstop it, as the late Radulphus Glauberus would
teach by sundry experiments. But the learned Regius enquiring upon the same,
will have a more subtle part of air to pass through, and insinuate by the
vehement condensation of that which is external, Philos. Not. l. 3. p. 151.
through the poise of the Mercury in the immersion of the Tube; and this he
labors to confirm by the different Subsidencies, thereof; the experiment being
made in Climates and Countries where the air is gross, and less pure: For
(says he) in Holland and Sweden the descent is apparently less then in Florens
or Paris; more upon the top of a Mountain, then in the bottom of a Valley, etc.
To these trials might be added, a description of the late fountain Glasses,
which are filled with water, after the manner that the Wind Gun, and other
Pneumaticks are charged with air: but that I suppose to have abundantly
demonstrated (be that which we call inane in these instances what it will) that
there is no evading the interspersedness of Vacuum in some of the spatiold's
either of the Mercury or the Glass. For even Fishes, which will live and grow
in a Phiol of water^ so long as the orifice thereof abides open, do certainly
expi^e in a moment, so soon as the same is exactly stopped; by which it is most
evident, that as it is an error which some have affirmed, that they require
water only for respiration; so is it as apparent, that without ^ire mingled
and dispersed through their element (though in reguard of its fluxibility we
cannot perceive the very spaces wherein that air resides) they would
immediately perish and expire. And therefore when we say, Na turam abhorrere
vacuum, it is after a Metaphorical sense; That is, in relation to a Coacervat
inanity, and no way impeading, but that an infinity of invisible pores reside
amongst our most sollid concreates, principles only excepted. And with this I
close this curious digression, proceeding with our Poet, who next presents us
with a pair of natural Principles,

Omnis ut est igitur per se natura, duabus
Consistit rebus, nam Corpora sunt, and inane.
Haec in quo sita sunt, and qua diversa moventur.
Nature, as of her self two thing implies
A void, and solid Corporieties:
The things in Place and places when they move.
Whose opinion this was, we have already showed, and what they meant by (...),
etc. full, Empty, Solid, Individual needs no farther enquiry. But Plato,
Empedocles, and some others, totally denied this doctrine, except it were a
certain extramundan inanity, I know not where. The Vacuum introduced by our
Philosopher, and wherein he scituates his body, we may safely take for that
Region or Space, which the Greeks so familiarly expressed by (...), being in
truth the same which we commonly call Place, albeit some of them have defined
Natura intactilis by a more nice (...) and (...), of which several distinctions
consult Gassendus, or the sensible demonstration of a vessel full, and empty.
In a Physical sense that Place, Region, or Space, which being susceptible of a
body, Sixth. Philos. phyrrhon. Hypot. l. 3. c. 16. de loco
yet destitute of a body, is denominated empty. And thus Locus imports the
space which is occupied by a body, Vacuum the space not actually employed, but
receptive of a body. Now as concerning these Bodies or Atoms. Epicurus held,
that even our common senses were competent Judges of them, which he believed
infallible; In lib. 10. Diog. Laert. p. 126
but of this way of probation the learned Animadversion of the often cited
Gassendus de sensu Criterio primo will afford the Reader best satisfaction, to
which I recommend him.

Having therefore (as we see) established these twin-principles, he proceeds in
the following verses to prove, that besides these, we are to expect no Third
whatsoever, Let us here him best express himself,

Praeterea nihil est, quod possis dicere ab omni
Corpore sejunctum, secretumque esse ab inani
Quod quasi tertia sit numero natura reperta.
Things from all bodies utterly disjoined
And separate from Void, none thou will find,
As if in Nature a third entitie
There should be: --
Which Natura tertia, or per se may happily allude to the (...); the meaning
whereof is, that whatever we find in Rerum Natura, is either Corpus or Inane,
there being no third numerical Principle, imagine it never so small or immense;
for if it be in the least degree tangible, it must of necessity acknowledge it
self of the family of Bodies; if on the contrary, intangible, it will as
inevitably appertain to the praedicament of Vacuum.

Praeterea per se quodcumque erit aut faciet quid,
Aut aliis fungi debebit agentibus ipsum, etc.
Besides whatever of it self depends
Is always doing; or else to other lends
Subject to action, etc. --
If any such principle there be, it must be subject either to Action or
Passion, and so still either a Body or Vacuum, for other third there is none;
and as touching the event, or any consequents of them, it is but a faint shift.
Seeing they may be present or absent without the least impeachment; for what is
really united, is so by propriety: And according to the definition of our Poet,

Conjunctum'st id, quod nunquam sine perniciali.
Discidio potis est sejungi seque gregari.
Now that is conjoined which one can truly never
Without the ruin of the subject sever.
As he readily instances in the weight of Stones, and hea^ of fire, which are
altogether inseparable to their composition and denomination, the thing it self
being destroyed by the utter defect of either; and as requisite are,

Tactus Corporibus cunctis, intactus inani.
So Bodies may be touched, and Vacuum not.
That is Space, and the intactile nature of Void, or incorporeity, which can
neither act nor suffer, but only afford space and room for bodies to range,
change and move in. The Philosophers have named these conjuncta and eventa,
(...) and (...) in relation to that which in Logic we term Proper and
Accident: And thereupon as for other matters, which do not at all discompose
our established principles, they were to be esteemed as out of the Series and
order of entities, seeing they are indeed neither inane nor yet bodies; such as
in the following Verses, he reckons to be things extrinsecal to any action.

Servitium contra, Libertas; divitiaeque
Paupertas, bellum, Concordia; Caetera quorum, etc.
On the other side, subjection, freedom, War
Peace, Riches, Poverty, be they what e're.
And further,
Tempus item per se non est, --
-- Nor is time of it self, etc. --
That is Natura per se, but (as was said) events and conjuncta, as where
Aristotle calls Substantia ens perse, Metap 12
and Accidens ens in alio; the meaning is they are not separated by our senses
from rest and motion, according to the vulgar definition; for it being by his
description mensura motus there cannot be imagined any instantaneous partition
thereof, without those considerations first admitted, seeing whilst it is in
flux, it is not, and being yet future, it is no other then if it were not; Sex.
Empir. cus. l. 9. de tempore.
and therefore cannot be properly said to have any Essence: but something,
which (with S. Aug. Confess.) may indeed better be conceived then expressed.
And as Gallen, quippiam divinum, of a nature incomprehensible. For the Time
present has no indivisible motion, though it be so mistaken* but it has
indefinite parts, so that it may be truly affirmed Vnum esse rerum tempus,
albeit each has its peculiar duration. The whole affair in short is, Epicurus
would not have it taken for any such thing as a Body, the conceit of
Aenesidemus, and therefore difficult it were to define what it signifies, after
the odd manner of Schools, per genus and differentiam. Our Poet makes it (as it
were) the Event of Events, or Accident of Accidents; and yet a huge reality,
even as day and night be the accidents of the ambient air illuminated by, or
deprived of the Sun, of which space and time the hours consist; or as motion
and rest be the accidents of bodies, the velocity or retardation whereof, we
measure out by time; after the same manner that men discourse of
Impatibilities, passions, joy, or grief, not as substances, but accidents of
such as suffer them for the space they possess, affect and concern them. All
which notions differ much from the opinions of other Philosophers; especially
the Peripateticks, who will needs have it to consist in pure motion of the
celestial orbs, to be a body; to be Animam Coeli, a motion of number secundum
prius and posterius, etc. And those who seem nearest the truth, and will have
the three principal Tences to be measured by the motion of the Heavens, or
earth circum Ao^em; which is therefore ( mensura taken pro re mensurata)
tropically Time. For the better comprehending whereof, since our most judicious
and eloquent Hooker, speaking of the natural causes and convenient institution^
of Festivals in the Church, has so perspicuously rendered it, it were worth
the reading a Paragraph: but I cannot stand to recite him at large. Eccles.
pol. ^ 5. p. 373.
The conclusion is, That Time does but measure other things, and neither
works in them any real effects, nor is it self ever capable of any; and
therefore when commonly we use to say, that Time is the wisest thing in the
world, because it brings forth all knowledge, and that nothing is more
foolish then Time, which never holds any thing long, but whatsoever one day
learneth, the same another day forgets; again that some see prosperous and
happy days, and that some men's days are miserable: In all these and the like
speeches, that which is uttered of Time, is not verified of Time it self, but
agrees unto those things which are in Time, and do by means of so near
conjunction, either lay their burden upon the back, or set their crown upon
the head of Time; yea, the very opportunities which we ascribe to Time, Hipp^c.
L^b. qui inscribitur praeceptiones.
do in truth cleave to the things themselves wherewith Time is joined: as for
Time, it neither causes things, nor opportunities of things, although it
comprize and contain both. Thus far the pious and sober Hooker. I may not stand
to examine some exceptions which lie against what he has said, being only to
show what our Poet (who extracts all out of Epicurus) endeavors to render it;
viz. a space something analogical to locus, as being real, eternal, and so
perfectly immutable, absolute, independent, and nothing material, as he would
exemplify in the Rape of the beautiful Helen, daughter of Tyndarus K. of
Lacedemoni^, whom Paris the son of Priamus desbauched from her husband
Menelaus, and the artificial Horse, by which stratagem the City Troy was
sacked, Virg. Aen. 2.
and the fair Lady recovered, Seeing (says he) these exploits were only the
events of that age wherein they were done; so long since past and gone, as that
the bare remembrance only of them scarcely remains unto us. Therefore
concludes, that every thing must not pretend to the same Prerogative which
Bodies and Vacuum are born too, but must be satisfied with the notion of Event
and Accidents, etc. which kind of Argument, if it satisfy the Reader, it is
more (I confess) then it does the Writer of these observations. But now to our
Principles again,

Esse ea, quae solido, atque aeterno corpore-constent,
Semina quae rerum, primordiaque esse docemus,
Vnde omnis rerum ^unc constet summa creata.
That of a solid, and eternal frame
Bodies there be, which principles we name.
And seeds of things, from whence the total sum
And mass of all created Beings come:
Shortly thus, the principles of things (says he) consist of a most simple,
mere, and altogether abstracted constitution: Now Corpus and Inane are the
principles we speak of; ergo, they are infallibly thus sincere, simple,
immixed, and exactly qualified. Now by Bodies, as we a^e to understand
something most solid, and which admits not of the least imaginable ingredient
of Vacuum: so likewise by Vacuum is meant, something as simple and merely void;
for otherwise they could in no wise be principles, it follows therefore,

Esse utramque sibi per se, puramque necesse est.
Each do subsist and unconfounded are:
Again, Bodies and Vacuum are incompatible, the Illation he thus proves by
their respective definitions,

Nam quacumque vacat spatium, quod inane vocamus;
Corpus ea non est: qua porro cumque tenet se
Corpus, ea vacuum nequaquam constat in^ne.
Sunt igitur solida, ac sine inani corpora prima, etc.
For whereso'ere of Room empty is said
Nobody is, again where ever's laid
A body, is no void; firm therefore be
Prime Bodies, and from empty spaces free.
The second Argument invited to prove his Atoms thus solid: You object (says
our Carus) that they imprison and include a Vacuum within them: if so, then by
consequent you grant whatsoever is comprehensive of that Vacuum to be most
solid.

Nec res ulla potest vera ratione probari
Corpore inane suo Celare, atque intus habere,
Si non, quod prohibet, solidum constare relinquas.
Nor can it by right reason be opposed
That Void is hid in Bodies, or enclosed
Unless you grant (what must in justice follow)
Those Bodies solid are, which hold the hollow.
And with this he rests satisfied to have sufficiently asserted the solidity
and immixture of his principles. But now besides all these properties of
compactedness and extraordinary simplicity, our Philosopher will have them to be
likewise Eternal; and he proves it,

-- Quoniam nec plenum naviter exstat;
Nec porro vacuum, sunt ergo corpora certa,
Quae spatium pleno possint distinguere in^ne.
Haec neque dissolui plagis extrinsecus icta
Possunt, etc. --
Since then nor all is full, nor empty space
Some bodies are that garnish every place,
These nor by blows extern, can wronged be
Nor riveted between asunder flee, etc.
It concerns the Reader to remember, how exactly full, and exqulsitely void our
principles are understood to be. In these lines be shows only how the whole
Universe cannot be said to be only and merely full, le^t men should imagine
this All to be but as one entire body; nor on the contrary, simply void, for
then could there be neither body nor thing in the world. Rather thus, Corpus
and Inane are things perfectly distinct; so as there is space and convenience
for the one to move and reside in the other, which he so frequently repeats to
confirm the necessity of his Atoms, whose bodies are of that permanency and
composition, as nothing can destroy or impeach, however they be treated, and
his reason is their non admission of the least vacuum, which he constitutes for
the sole principle of destruction where ever it is ingredient; for so these
following lines import,

Et quo quaeque magi^ cohibet res intus inane,
Tam magis his rebus penitus tentata labascit.
And how much more things do include a void
By these assailed they sooner are destroyed.
By reason of heat, cold, moisture, etc. which brings every concreate body to
its period and destruction sooner or later, according as Void domineers in
their composition, which admits access and entrance to those things that ruin
and confound them: therefore concludes,

Ergo si solida, ac sine inani corpora prima
Sunt, ita uti docui; sint haec aeterna, necesse est.
If (as I taught) then principles are free
From void, they likewise must eternal be.
As ingenita, aeterna, and incorrupta from this their noninanity.

Praeterea, nisi materies aeterna fuisset,
Ante hac ad nihilum penitus res quaeque redissent, etc.
Besides had matter not for ever been,
We had long since all things reduced seen, etc.
If in extreme resolutions things should absolutely annihilate, then certainly
all things had long ere this perished, and every individual extant, resulted
from nothing, which were a most absurd conceit: therefore (says he) they
undoubtedly return to some solid matter again, without which property,

Nec ratione queunt alia servata peraevum,
Ex infinit^, jam tempore res reparare.
Nor may we also conceive ought lastinglie
Can for eternal reparation be.
And that he may demonstrate how Nature proceeds to some final and determinate
resolutions, without any pretense to Infinite, he shows; for

-- Si nullam finem natura parasset
Frangendis rebus; jam corpora materiai
Vsque redacta forent, aevo frangente priore,
Vt nihil ex illis, etc.
Did Nature when she does in pieces take
Things, to her self no Bounds nor limits make,
Matter e're this had been so near reduced
To their first cause, as naught could be produced, etc.
There are therefore some solid Principles that can never be destroyed. And
unless there were a certain period stated for the decay of things, when it is
proceeded as far as those bodies or Atoms, they had long ago failed and been
utterly annihilated; nor were we for the future to have ever expected any
successive mature productions; since those Moleculae had e're this, been
obnoxious to so many strokes, continual and uncessant encounters as must of
necessity have reduced them.

At nunc nimirum ^rangendi reddita finis
Certa manet, quoniam refici rem quamque videmus
Et finila simul generatim tempora rebus
Stare, quibus p^ssent, aevi contingere florem.
But now to such destruction it is most plain
Limits are fixed; since they are restored again,
And to all sort of things times set, in which
They may attain their ages perfect pitch.
For as much as those perpetual agitations terminate, being once vared to those
solid and irrefragable principles* which nothing can eternally alter.

And thus having partly asserted the Perennity of his Elements, he endeavors in
the next to demonstrate by another instance, that notwithstanding his bodies
are thus hard and wonderfully compact; yet (by being joined and coupled to
Void) they may in composition of things be said to be of a Soft Nature.

-- Quae fiant aer, aqua, terra, vapores,
Quo pacto fiant, and qua vi cunque gerantur, etc.
So Air, Earth, Water, so are vapors bred
By what e're power, or how engendered.
Continually pursuing the immutability of his Principles; viz. by the
indivisibility, inconspicuity, and simplicity of his Atoms, which do not
constitute bodies by the least mixture, but a certain fortunate adhesion in
which our Poet discovers the difference 'twixt Aristotle and Epicurus; the one
affirming that a body was divisible into parts infinite, how small soever,
obnoxious yet to eternal divisions. This our Carus refells by a plain deduction
ad absurdum. Empedocles was it seems of this judgment. But the Other taught
that his principles were so small, that they were neither actually nor
potentially subject to any farther division; which Argument our Poet seems here
to refer to the Treatise which his Praeceptor expressly writ, (...), such a
minimum as one may speculate to reside in the very point of an angle of some
most acute Atome; for of such the universal body of his principles consist, or
at least, something Analogical to them, as most meet for the generation and
supply of things; which if actually and infinitely divisible, could determine
to nothing certain* neither (if so) could there be any difference 'twixt the
greatest and the least, which were most repug^ant to reason. This admitted, you
are (says our Author) necessitated to concede a minimum. Let the Reader be
again admonished, that he mistake not our Poets minim for such a Mathematical
point as is represented Sans magnitude; our principles enjoy it, and likewise
figure as infinitely variable as their^ is divisible amongst the Peripate^icks:
which Apices, or least of things, upon serious and speculative disquisition,
may happly prove a notion to be hardly denied, whether Physically or
Mathematically taken, as the much admired Gassendus largely demonstrates, where
he speaks de non esse magnitudinem Epicuro infinite dividuam; whether I refer
the curious, and to something which we shall speak hereafter. Lastly,

-- Si minim^^ in Partis cuncta resolvi
Cogere consuesset rerum natura Creatrix:
Jain nihil ex illis eadem reparare valeret, etc.
-- Now suppose
Nature from whence all things created rose,
Did not each thing into least pieces take
She never could a new the same things make.
The various readings of which Verses, I suppose to have here reconciled: The
drift of the Poet being still to oppose the infinite divisibility of principles
from their then incapacity of new productions. Having thus established his own,
he falls next to examine and refel the opinions of some other renowned
Philosophers: And first he encounters Heraclitus, who taught, that Fire was the
very first matter,

-- Atque ex igni summam consistere solo, etc.
And that of Fire consisted the whole mass.
This is that Sceptick who also affirmed, that the world was repleat with
Demons or Spirits: Plut* de placit. Philos. l. 11. c. 6
that the Sun was only an actual flame, which yet he sensually believed to be
no bigger then its Phenomenon. But to return to our subject, Thus Laertius,
(...), etc. That all things consisted of fire, and reverted again into it by a
certain rarefaction and condensation, flowing much after the manner that rivers
do: That Fire when it became condensed grew moist, and so was made Air; Air
congregated, resolved into Liquor; and Water congealed and waxing more
concrete, turned into Earth; all which was performed downwards, (...). etc. and
then it ascended gradually again, beginning with the lowest and most ponderous.
The Earth attenuated dissolved into Water, of the Water rarefied was made Air,
(...): the re^^ after the same process, which makes our Poet worthily reproach
this Ephesian Philosopher as one

Clarus ob obscuram linguam magis inter inanes
Quam de gravis inter Graios, qui vera requirunt.
Omnia enim stolidi magis admirantur, amantque
Inversis quae sub verbis La^itantia cernunt,
Veraque constituunt, quae belle tangere possunt
Aures, and lepido quae sunt fucata sonore.
Cried up for's dark expressions by the light
Not sober Greeks, such as in truth delight:
For fools t'admire and love are most inclined
What lurking midst obscurest terms they find;
And only hold for truth what accen^s quaint
Strike the pleased ear, and with trim phrase does paint.
This was that Maudline Philosopher whom they report to have wept so often at
the vanities of other men, which yet say some he did but dissemble out of
excess of fast and disdain, Cic. f 4. quaest. Acad.
as conceiting himself the only person in the world for profoundness of
Learning and Wisdom. By the Character our Poet gives him, it seems he much
delighted to be little understood; and Lucretius was no admirer of
Hierogliphical learning; yet not out of disaffection to pure and natural
Eloquence, but when it was empty and jejune of matter; or that any science was
delivered in obscure language, which have made some write on this place, as if
by Inversis quae sub verbis, etc. signified how Heraclitus was addicted to the
childish spelling or pronouncing his words backwards, because Vitruvius and
some others have named him (...), for his affected obscurity; and Laertius,
where he repeats diverse reproachful Nicknames given to sundry of the
Philosophers, (...) (says he) (...), quasi nimirum turba^orem, confusoremve,
etc. ob affectatam in scribendo obscuritatem; a great lover of enigmatical and
tropical expressions, which makes Nardius on this place very much in choler
against our poor Chemists, at whose canting he is exceedingly bitter and
impatient. But to our Poet, whose first quarrel against Heraclitus is,

-- Cur tam variae res possent esse, requiro
Ex vero si sunt igni, puroque creatae, etc.
But how things can thus differ I enquire,
If they proceed from pure and real fire.
To prove that no solitary thing, or Element alone can possibly be this
catholic Principle; especially, since (as it follows) they neither admit of
Rarefaction, Condensation or Vacuum, without which it must of necessity still
remain Fire, such, yet, as (in defect of Vacuum to move in) it could not be;
the principle being thus destroyed by reason of its density incompatible with
its nature; as is evident by the light, heat and effects thereof, which
evidently discovers its Rarefaction and Admixtion with Vacuum. But

Quod si forte ulla credunt ratione potesse
Ignis in Coctu stingui, mutareque corpus, etc.
If happily some persuade themselves that fire
May shif^ it is body, and in the mass expire, etc.
And by this shift become Earth, being endued with more crasse and thick
particles (for so Plutarch seems to deliver it for him) viz. that by
contraction it becomes Earth, and again by laxation, Water, this evaporated and
extenuated, Air, etc. It should by this process utterly lose the being and
prerogative of fire, as exceeding its terms; and so not being what it is
established for, must of necessity annihilate: of which Nothing, we have
already proved it impossible that any thing should consist. Fire therefore by
being extinct, cannot properly be said to be changed into any other substance;
seeing a simple body is incapable of alteration without a total perdition. And
then if ought remain, it is Atoms, the common matter and principles which we
all this while contend for; and which by their Addition, Detraction,
Transposition, etc. sometimes indeed appear in the form of Fire, and sometimes
of other things, as the has here expressed it. Heraclitus (says he) believes
his senses, by which he understands what Fire is, it is perspicuous. Why does he
not as well credit them when it perceives or feels other things which be
altogether as obvious and visible; such as Air, Earth or Water, which may all
by this argument, be as well Principles as his pretended Fire?

As much (says our Poet) have erred those other Philosophers,

-- Qui principium gignundis era rebus
Constituere, etc.
Who Air the universal source have deemed.
I suppose he means Cleanthes and Anaximenes Milesius. Anaximents Infinitum
era dixit esse ex quo omnia gignerentur: as Cicero. The like is affirmed by
Plutarch, who also ascribes the same opinion to Archelaus the Athenian; and
thence it is reported that Apolloniates Diogenes believed it to be the common
God, or rather, Principle, in respect of its immense extension, and the vast
space which indeed it employeth.

-- aut Humorem qui^umque putarunt
Fingere res ipsum perse, terramve creare
Omnia, etc. --
Or that pure Water, or the earth have esteemed
Forms all, etc.
Of which opinion was Thales Milesius one of the seven Sages, the same who
named God, the Mind: though he reported water to be the first Principle out of
which the Mind educed all other materials; moisture the Principle, and God the
Cause. Of which see the elegant Lactantius, Cicero de Not. deor l. 1.
Vitruvius, l. 2. c. 2. and in proaem, l. 8. Indeed though some hardy men father
this Philosophy on Moses, yet that Water is really a very (...), or universal
Principle, besides the forecited Tha^es; Hippon, Empedocles and Theophrastus
were of the same says; Hippocrates himself attributes much to it: and of later
times, the great Sendivogius, and generally the best learned Spagirists. But
above all, is famous that experiment delivered us by Helmont of the growth of
his tree, supplied only by this humor: Let the curious consult his works; for
I hasten.

As concerning the Earth, Hesiod and some others, first broached. In fine, he
concludes, that whoever they are that constitue Fire, Heat, Air, the Water, or
indeed any other solitary Element, to be the Universal and Common Principle,

Magnopere a vero longeque errasse videntur.
Have all alike at large from truth estray'd.
Add etiam, qui conduplicant primordia rerum.
Add those who principles of things combine.
The (...) or General of these Philosophers (such were Archelaus, and
Parmenides, the one making Fire and Water, the other Earth and Water, to be
rerum principia) was the learned Empedocles, by Sect a Pythagorean, by birth a
Citizen of Agrigentum, Plin. l. 31 c. 7.
a town in Sictly now called Naro and Gergento, whose coast our Poet here most
elegantly describes, together with the rivage and vorago of Charybdis: the
horrible and ignivomous mouth of Aetna, not improperly mentioned in this place,
as into whose jaws some report he precipitated himself: his hopes were to have
made men think he had passed some extraordinary way to Immortality, if the
unlucky ejection of his iron Sandals (which he forgot to dispose of) had not
detected his ambition and folly. Some say, he fell into that Barathrum by
accident, as the elder Pliny perished at Vesuvius, whilst he was Philosophizing
upon the cause of those terrible Vulcano's. The particulars mentioned here by
our Carus, are only in honor of this Illustrious Hero, whom he even
Canonizes, and makes a Demi-god of. But certainly a very extraordinary person
he was, in imitation of whose former work upon the like subject, some affirm
that our Poet composed these six Books de Rerum Natura; and how great a man he
was, may be seen at large in Diog. Vid. Orig. coat. Ce^sum.
Laertius, where he informs us how nearly he approached to the description of
God, whom whilst some, with the Anthropomorphite, imagined to be composed of
humane form and shape; that is to say, with the very members of a man (as is
easily collected out of those Verses in Ammonius comment (...)) he affirmed to
consist only of a divine and holy mind moving and governing the Universe by
cogitations most swift and incomprehensible. To this add his conjecture, that
all things were created by a certain amity, consent or harmony amongst the
Elements, and that they perished only by some unhappy discord; as for the
Soul, that it only resided in the blood essentially (which was also the
opinion of Critias) whence the Poet, Purpuream vomit ille animam. And that
those who were best furnished with that crimson humor, were more generous
spirited then other men, and consequently of better judgment: but I quit this.
It should seem he was a very rare person indeed, that the great Aristotle
should ascribe the invention of Rhetoric to him, and whose discourses our
Lucretius (who else believed little of those fabulous divinations and Spirits)
should prefer to the very Oracles of Apollo; the descant of whose Responses if
our Carus have not sufficiently described, let the curious Reader consult
Porphyrius, recited by Aug. de Civit. dei l. 20. Herod. l. 1. etc. And yet this
person, as learned and universal as he was; for his thus blending and marring
of Principles with the rest, as the Stagyrist somewhere pronounces of other
Philosophers, (...): which our Poet interprets,

Principiis tamen in rerum fecere ruinas;
Et graviter magni magno cecidere ibi casu.
Yet these great persons all receive great falls,
And split themselves on false originals.
And such it seems (besides Empedocles, etc.) were those who

-- Motus exempto rebus inani
Consti^uunt; and res mollis rarasque relinqunt, etc.
-- Motion without void avow;
And yet of things do soft and rare allow.
For Lucretius is far from denying the four vulgar (...), as they are
compositive parts of the Universe; but only when usurping on that prerogative
of Atoms, men affirm them to be the principles of the Concretes. And again,
for that they utterly reject all Vacuum; and yet admit of other things, which
cannot possibly subsist without it. In the second place, that they affirm all
things to be infinitely dividuous, rejecting Atoms, to which when once a
division is arrived, there is a certain period to all farther Anatomization of
Bodies. Thirdly, that they constitute soft, and per consequens mutable
principles (such as Fire, Earth, Air, Water, etc.) which must of necessity
annihilate. Fourthly, for that they produce contrary and repugnant Elements,
such as Fire and Water, etc. expressed in our Poet by Inimica and Venena inter
se, reciprocally destructive. Fifthly, that they make the Elements to be the
principles of Bodies, rather then Bodies to be the principles of the Elements.
And lastly, because they acknowledge the four common elements to be changed
into things (being once dispoil'd of their natures) which are immediately to
revert into the Elements again; or in case they still preserve their natures,
remain only capable of making some confused and rude heap, without producing
any thing perfectly distinct.

Non animans; non exanimo cum corpore, ut arbos,
Quippe, etc. --
No living thing, nor things inanimate,
As Trees, for that, etc. --
For Epicurus did not admit of any Soul to reside in Plants, but held, that
they were governed and grew by virtue of a certain nature not vegitable, proper
to them alone, and yet affirmed, that they live, that is, enjoy a peculiar
motion, as the water of Crystal springs, the fire which we excite to a flame,
is called living water, and living fire; something analogical to that which I
think is more difficult to express then comprehend: for such is fire without
light, etc. But concerning this, see the express Treatise written by the
learned T. Campanella, in his Book De sensu Rerum and Magia, etc. The sum is,
that those four vulgarly reputed Elements are not the Principles of natural
things to the prejudice of Atoms. Lastly, for that, This too

-- Repetunt a coelo, atque ignibus ejus
Et primum faciunt ignem se vertere in auras
Aeris, hinc imbrem gigni; terramque creari
Ex imbri; retroque a terra cuncta reverti;
Humorem primum, post era, deinde calorem
Nec cessare haec inter se mutare, meare
De Coelo ad terram, de terra ad sydera mundi
Quod facere haud ullo debent primordia pacto.
From heaven, and from his fires they bring
And first the fire to air transformed they sing,
Hence rain sublimed, and Earth condensed of rain
And so from Earth, they all retire again:
First Water, then the Air, and Fire in trains
Nor once this course to cease, but to and fro
From heaven to earth, from earth to heaven they go:
Which Principles refuse, etc.
Making a Transmutation to preserve them from destruction, as repaired by a
compensation of parts; even as the Species are still conserved by a continual
succession of new Individuals. Thus like Antimonie, they operate (...): which
doctrine is wholly repugnant to the nature of Principles, which ought to be
stable and fixed, as has abundantly been showed: All which considered, says
Carus,

-- Potius tali natura praedita quaedam
Corpora constituas, ignem si forte crearint,
Posse eadem demptis paucis, paucisque tributis
Ordine mutato, and motu, facere aeris auras:
Sic alias, aliis rebus mutarier omnis.
Rather such bodies state that fire shall make
Add some few things, away some other take;
Order and motion changed turn to thin air,
Thus every thing does every thing repair.
For so it is, spontaneous things are produced, as by the mutual conversion of
Water and Air; viz. by the various disposition and conjugation of the very
identical parts; and so in like sort by access and addition: as those things
which spring up of seed by Fermentation, Coagulation, etc. till they specify
accordingly: so also by Detraction of parts: as Wax by separating it from the
honey, Spirits from the Phlegm, and other Chemical principles by fire, as might
be infinitely exemplified.

At manifesta palam res indicat, inquis, in auras:
Aeris e terra res omnis crescere, alique, etc.
But you will object all things from Earth do spring
Up into the Air^, and thence have nourishing*
To which objection that the Plants and Animals derive their nutrition from the
four Elements, it is answered, That those Elements are nor really the first
Principles of them; for they are indiscernable, these are evident: But thus it
is, that in these compounded Elements those so abstracted and inconcrete are
disguised and latent: through which it happens, that whilst these Vegetables
seem to receive their nouriture from the moisture of the showers, and
propitious warmth of the Sun, each of our Poets Corpuscles contribute to those
of the same nature, and which are homogeneous to them.

Namque eadem coelum, mare, terras, flumina, solemn
Constituunt: eadem fr^ges, arbusta, animantis.
Verum aliis, alioque modo commista moventur.
Quinetiam passim nostris in versibus ipsis
Multa elementa vides multis communia verbis:
Cum tamen inter se versus, ac verba necesse est
Confiteare and re, and sonitu distare so^anti
Tantum elementa queunt permutato ordine solo.
For they are the same which heaven constitutes
Sun, Seas, Earth, Streams, Shrubs, Animals and Fruits:
Although with different motions mixed they be,
Just as each where in these our lives you see
To diverse words are many letters found
Common, which differ much in sense and sound:
Such change variety of Letters brings, etc.
They all consist of the very same Atoms and Corpuscles, however different and
remote they seem to be, as being generally composed of the same common matter;
and therefore since all sublunary things have their principles common with the
Celestial, it is not hard to conceive how things are thus daily repaired and
nourished* by participating of their aid and influence: nor how by this
wonderful permutation of posture and order, such Essential differences of
things should be produced: but so it fares with them, as with the disposition
and various location of those Miranda Naturae (as Vossius calls them) a few
Letters: Diodor. Sic. l. 12. Tus. qu. 1. de Art Gram.
the position of six or seven notes in Music, the admirable and stupendous
variety of Sums by Figures, the distinction of words, change of tunes, and
diversity of numbers; if it be really so in these familiar Instances, what
admirable variety cannot then the chances and sundry postures of Atoms (our
(...) and Principles produce? And indeed the comparisons are exceedingly
apposite; since in all confused and tumultary commission of either, neither
articulate words, nor proportionable numbers: nor lastly, harmonious Consorts,
could possibly result from them. So neither in these Natural things, Atoms are
not in general to be thought fit, and apt to produce and constitute all sorts
of Concretes; but such only as are endued with a particular and prone
disposition. The same is likewise to be conceived of their final dissolutions
and destruction: Conclude we therefore in our Poets Epiphonema,

Tantum Elementa queunt permutato ordine solo.
At rerum quae sunt primordia, plura adhibere
Possunt, unde queant variae res quaeque creari.
Such change variety of Letters brings;
But Elements, which are indeed of things
The Principles, are able to induce
Greater, and more variety produce.
But now room for another Philosopher, whom our Carus thus ass^ults,

Nunc and Anaxagorae scrutemur homoeomeriam, etc.
And now let us a little cast our eye
On the Anaxagor^an Homoeomerie.
This Anaxagoras was disciple of Anaximenes and Pherecydes the Syrian, Arist.
de not, deor. l. 1. Polyd. de Invent. rer. l. 1. c. 11. Plin. l. 2. c. 58.
and the opinion there recited by Lucretius, is thought to have been taken out
of a Book which he composed of Physiologie, so recommended by Socrates in
Plato. He confessed God to be a Spirit diffused through all the creatures,
which he represented under the notion of Intellectus. In this encounter our
Poet shows* how Epicurus's Principles differed from his (...) similar parts, or
rather (...), which we may better interpret similarity, (...), from the
similitude and resemblance of the parts to the things resulting of them; as if
the things we eat and drink, bread, wine, flesh, etc. did actually contain
within them some latent particles of blood, flesh, bones, nerves, etc. because
of such our bodies are both composed and nourished; whereas Particles rightly
separated by the natural faculty, are indeed applicable to the bloody, carnous,
bony, etc. pre-existent parts; for albeit such parts as he comprehends under
(...), be dissimilar one to the other, as ^ones, stones, blood, entrails, etc.
yet consisted they of similar parts; which here our Carus thinks best to
express by a Greek word (as in some editions the characters likewise themselves
declare) being by his own confession unable to find a term sufficiently
significant and comprehensive throughout the whole Latin tongue. Lambini.
In short, this Philosopher taught, that bones were made, and did increase of
small and minute bones, blood of united drops of blood, Gold of golden grains.
Fire of Sparks, etc. and (as the notion imports) that all things else in the
world consisted of similar particulars: but with all this he yet utterly denies
a vacuum, and maintains the infinite divisions of bodies, contrary to the
doctrine of Epicurus: by both which, as well Principles themselves, as what
resulted from them, were obnoxious to ruin and destruction, which our Carus
condemns as most egregious errors in Philosophy,

Add quod imbecilla nimis primordia ^ingit;
Si primordia sunt, etc. --
Besides, if these his Principles he names
They are too ^eeble, etc. --
Whereas Principles remain most solid and unimpeachable: Now these for
consisting but of the same nature with their corruptible compounds, cannot in
reason be imagined capable to survive them, but must in conclusion fail and
annihilate.

Praeterea quoniam cibus auget corpus, alitque;
Scire licet nobis venas, and sanguen, and ossa,
Et nervos alienigenis ex partibus esse, etc.
Besides since meats augment the body, and
Do nourish it, then may we understand
That veins, blood, bones, and likewise sinews may
Consist of diverse parts, etc.
The body augments, and is nourished with meats; but that very food which we
use for this purpose, consists not of one kind alone: some of it is bread,
some flesh, fruit, wine, etc. which are rarely all of them alienigenous and
dis-like inter se; ergo, neither do our entrails, veins nor blood, nor indeed
any other parts of composition consist of similar parts. And if this be not
instance sufficient,

Transfer item; totidem verbis, utare licebit:
In lignis si flamma latet, fumusque, cinisque:
Ex alienigenis consistant ligna, necesse est, etc.
Change now the subject, keep the Terms still good;
If flame, smoke, ashes, all do lurk in Wood,
The wood of diverse parts it will imply, etc.
Thus, if Anaxagoras object, that all things are blended and confusedly mixed
together in all things, but do so internally lie hid, that nothing appear to
view, save what is most gross, extrinsecal, predominant and abounding therein;
as, admit them particles of milk, or blood, which did domineer in any
composition; then he called that, which so appeared, by the name of blood,
milk, etc. a praedominio.

Quod tamen a vera long ratione repulsum 'st.
Which is as far from truth --
And why?
Conveniebat enim fruges quoque saepe minutas,
Robore cum saxi franguntur, mittere signum
Sanguinis: aut aliquid, nostra quo corpora aluntur, etc.
-- For then should corn
Beneath the weighty millstone ground and worn
Into small parts, some stains of blood there shed,
Or something whereof we are nourished.
And other things which we feed on, and which generate our blood, and produce
our humors, bowels, bones, etc. would appear; and by the same reason we may as
well expect milk from herbs, small cions; trees and seeds of every species,
when men delve the earth, without the industry of planting; for if all things
be thus universally mixed, we might then certainly find as well all things in
every particular thing; yea, Grapes of Thorns, and figs of Thistles.

For all this, sain would Anaxagoras confirm his opinion; because (says he) I
see fire to be produced by the collision of stones, and other obstinate things
forced one against another; which in the mean time, our Poet conceives to be
only the seeds of fire, since if it were really fire, we must of necessity
perceive also the smoke, ashes, and other inseparable accidents thereof, when
at any time men cleave or excorticate wood for their use:

At saepe in magnis fit montibus (inquis) ut altis
Arboribus vicina cacumina summa terantur
Inter se, validis facere id cogentibus austris,
Donec flammai fulserunt flore coorta.
Scilicet, etc.
But thou affirm'st on Mountains which aspire,
That tops of trees are often times set on fire
Till they do flame again with glowing heat,
When Southern winds them on each other beat:
That this sometimes succeeds, an accident in Thucydides, and frequent
experience confirms, and our Carus denies it not; yet it does not proceed from
any actual fire in them; but there are certain seminal Atoms which include
indeed a potential fire, which being extremely agitated, moved, and by that
means the body opened are freed from their prisons, can produce such an effect,
or conflagration: but far from what Anaxageros dreamed of, and therefore he is
fixed to the purity and immixture of his Principles, which being common to many
things, according to their position, compose and terminate in such and such
Individuals,

Jamne vides igitur, paullo quod diximus ante,
Permagni refer eadem primordia saepe,
Cum quibus, and quali positura contineantur?
Et quos inter se dent motus, accipiantque?
Atque eadem paullo inter se mutata creare
Ignes e lignis? quo pacto verba quoque ipsa
Inter se paullo mutatis sunt elementis,
Cum ligna, atque Ignis distincta voce notemus.
See you not then (as we observed even now)
It much imports of the same seeds to know
With what, and in what posture being joined,
What motions are received, and what assigned,
And how together changed they create
Fire out of wood, just as the words relate,
The Letters but a little changed when we
Lignum and Ignem plainly signify.
For wood is compounded of a very vast variety of Corpuscles, which being so
and so disposed, constitute the forms as well thereof, as of diverse other
things less concrete; as some purer and moveable bodies therein may specify
and produce fire, flame, smoke, etc. according to its composition, density,
coherence, laxity and resolution, etc. so that there is in truth only this
simple connection, disposition and fabric of the parts at any time destroyed,
when the matter is fired and (to all appearance) consumed; viz. its external
form, species, and accidents which denominate it wood; the rest being resolved
into flame, fire, smoke, ashes, phlegm, spirits, salts, etc. all which are
those minute particles that do seminarily lurk therein, though never so
imperceptible to our senses: And as touching their connection of what forms, and
how apt our principles are to effect that work, we shall shortly demonstrate.

Denique jam quaecumque in rebus cernis apertis,
Si fieri non posse putas, quin materiai
Corpora consimili natura praedita fingas:
Hac ratione tibi pereunt primordia rerum;
Fiet, uti risu tremulo concussa cachinnent,
Et Lacrumis falsi^ humectent ora genasque.
Lastly, if in things obvious to our eyes,
You think they cannot be made otherwise,
Except you shall a similar matter find
For every body in its several kind,
Then by this means the principles of all
Are quite destroyed, so that it must befall
They can into excessive laughter break,
Or wet with briny tear the face and cheek.
If there remain nothing save Corpuscles in the world, and that they result
from similar principles, then must they in like manner be concrete, rational
and animate things, such as principles cannot be imagined; for if things
sensible necessarily consist of parts of the like nature, this absurdity will
of consequence ensue, that functions, affections and actions should distinctly
be ascribed to certain Elements proper only to them; and so those membranes
and nerves, the pores, etc. The pores of the brain opened by the received
motion of several objects, which do not only concern and stir up such and such
particular muscles, apt to the moving of those members, but which do even touch
the very fibers of the Heart it self, and other Organs; upon which, as on a
Harp, expressions and accents of sorrow, joy, fear, anger and other
perturbations and affections of spontaneous motion are incited, must forthwith
have every one of them its particular ridiculous or lachrymant principles; now
that principles should be joyful or Lugubrous, were very ridiculous Philosophy
indeed. However, some later Philosophers seem to favor the Anaxagoran opinion,
and that these affections do really praeesse in Elementis; though nor
altogether after the same manner quo in homine. S. Augustine may be a little
suspected too, where he asserts Omnium rerum Sem ina occulta extare ab initio.

And so our Poet concludes his dispute with the Greek Philosophers, who were in
truth the chief oppugners of his doctrine. But because what remains will be
somewhat difficult to comprehend, in most elegant Verses (which really declare
him to have been an incomparable Master in the faculty) ingeniously confesses
what it is which makes him so indefatigably pursue it; namely, the fame and
future glory of his person, especially, when (like him) men attempt such
difficulties as were never before adventured on; and the rather in Verse, that
being matter hugely abstruse, the deliciousness of his charming numbers may
render it more agreeable to the Reader, carmen autem compositum, and oration cum
suavitate decipiens, capit mentes, and quo voluerit impellit, says the
eloquent Lactantius, emulating herein the Physician, who being about to
administer any unpleasant dose, De vero cultu c. 21. Muret. var. lect. l. 6. c.
3.
either gilds the Pill, or conveys it in some sweet and tempting potion; which
passage, not only Themistius in an oration ad Nicomedienses did make bold
with, but the incomparable Tasso has thus translated in his first Canto, Str.
3.

Sed veluti pueris absinthia, etc. --
For as who children bitter wormwood give.
Cosi a l'egro fanciul porgiamo aspersi
Di so avi licor gli orli del vaso:
Succhi amari ingannato intanto ei beve,
E dal' Inganno suo vita receve, etc.
And I thus Interpret,
So we to the sick child a cup appoint
Whose brim with some sweet liquor we anoint;
That so he drink the bitter juice we give,
Deceived, and being thus decived, Live.
The nature of Infinite being the next discourse, he thinks a proposition so
confounding and intricate, cannot be huisher'd in with too soft and elegant
language; for now he endeavors to show what bounds are prescribed to the
unstable and eternal motions of his foregoing principles, what space or vacuum
they really employ, as whether,

-- finitum funditus omne
Constet; an Immensum pateat vasteque profundum.
-- It admit of any bound,
Or stretch immensly to a vast profound*
That is, whether there be any term and limits to this vast sum of principles.
For Epicurus raught, (...), etc. That an infinite concourse of atoms required
an inanity and space as infinite to comprehend them: Which opinion our Poet
here asserts, and the Orator thus, In hac igitur immensitate Latitudinum,
Longitudinum, Altitudinum, De Not. Deor.
infinita res innumerabilium volitat Atomorum, quae interjecto inani, etc. For
so our Philosopher. That this Universe or (...), was Infinite, not an unlimited
Vacuum, extramundum or Coelum, as it seems, some others; his reason is
subjoyned,

Omne quod est igitur, nulla regione viarum
Finitum 'st: namque extremum debebat habere, etc.
Then sure this All can no way finite be,
For then it must have some extremity.
The Nature of Finite is to have an extremity, the property of extreme, that
something contain it; ergo, that which is finite is circumscribed by something;
but that which is extra universum is nothing; therefore has it also no
extremity, and is consequently unlimitted: Which, says Cicero, the eyes in our
head, as well as those of our imagination convince us of; for the one ex alio
extrinsecus cernitur; at quod omne est, id non cernitur ex alio extrinsecus: as
he has acutely argued it, lib. 2. de divinitate,

Nunc, extra summam quoniam nihil esse fatendum est,
Non habet extremum: caret ergo fine, modoque,
Nec refert quibus adsist as regionibus ejus,
Vsque adeo, etc.
Since then beyond the whole we needs must grant
Nothing remains, it term and bound must want,
Nor ought imports it on what clime one stands,
Since infinite, etc.
Nature indeed, according to the Schools, abhors Infinite, nay even the
plurality of Infinites is contradictory and impious; but our Philosopher not
herewith satisfied, endeavors to show us something which may involve all, and
that there is nothing more absurd, then to enquire for any thing extra
Infinitum.

For, says he, let it be imagined that one can run never so far with hopes to
arrive at the last to this wall or fantastic limit; yet he shall soon find
himself at an infinite loss; for where ever he goes, or conceits it to be, he
shall perpetually encounter infinite parts* or admit yet that there were indeed
such an imaginary extreme,

-- Si quis procurrat ad oras
Vltimus extremas, jaciatque volatile telum;
Invalidis utrum contortum viribus ire,
Quo fuerit missum mavis, longeque volare;
An prohibere aliquid censes, obstareque posse?
Alterutrum fatearis enim, sumasque necesse est,
Quorum utrumque tibi effugium praecludit, etc.
-- Suppose one running to the place
Where that extreme were, should throw forth a dart
Think you 'twould fly directly to that part
The strong arm aimed it at, and pass out right,
Or would something oppose it in the flight?
For one of them you must at least confess
Whilst either does your Argument distress:
Which convincing instance, I find also used by the rational Bruno, who has
written an express and curious treatise, See Scipionis Capici lib. 1. de rerum
principiis
not only to prove the Infinity of Space; but that even of worlds, what
concerns our Poet, hear him thus describe, Mi pare cosa ridicola, etc. In
earnest (says he) methinks it is extremely ridiculous to affirm, that without
the heavens there should be nothing, and that the heaven is a thing in it self,
placed as it were per accidens (i.) Dialog. 1.
by its own parts (or be their meaning by these notices what they please
themselves) it is impossible, and they cannot decline it, but they must make
two of one; since there will eternally remain one and another; viz. the
containing, and the contained, and in such sort another and another, that the
continent must be incorporeal, the contained corporeal; the one immovable, the
other moveable; the one Mathematical, the other Physical; but be this
Superficies whatever, I demand eternally what there is beyond it? if it be
replied, that there is nothing, then it is Void; and such an Inanity as has no
extreme; bounded indeed on this part toward us, which is yet more difficult to
imagine, then that the Universe should be immense and Infinite, because we can
then no way avoid Vacuum, if we will admit the Whole to be finite, etc. But I
pursue him no farther* Our Metaphysical eyes discern (as they conceive) the
bounds of two worlds, whereof some imagine the upreamest heaven to be the term
of this; and the convexity of that, the boundary of the other; but how that
should then be habitable (as likewise they assert) where is neither Locus,
Plenum, nor Vacuum, Time, nor Motion, nor any thing else (for so they affirm
also) is infinitely strange, and will require second Cogitations. Well, but our
Author concludes, as there is a space in which this material world of ours
actually is; so it may not be denied, but that another, and another, even to
infinite, perpetually equivalent to what this Machine employs, may likewise
subsist in that vast and unlimited Space.

As for the Weapon by which our Poet introduces the Explorator of this
boundary, if any thing resist the flight thereof, needs it must be something
that is a body; but we learn that Corpus is in universo; if now nothing impead
it, then there is no end: for if there were, then should the dart either stick
in the pale, or recoil toward the Jaculator: farther then this it could not
possibly proceed. Now this Argument is alleged to answer this objection, that
the Universe might se ipso finiri, and its extremity be taken comparatively to
the internal parts, and not by any relation ad aliquid exterius, and he
subjoyns the absurdity, because, as it follows soon after; for,

-- Spatium summai totius omne
Vndique si inclusum certis consisteret oris,
Finitumque foret; jam copia materiai
Vndique p^nderibus solidis confluxet ad imum, etc.
-- If this all every where
With bounds impaled be, and finite were,
Then would the store of matter on each side
Beneath through poise of solids downwards slide.
That is, if it were finite, and had either center or medium to which matter
might tend, it would have long since come to pass, that al Matter being
depressed in that place, could never have afterward produced any thing; which
term I make bold to use, that I may express both Geri and Geni, for which there
is no little stir 'twixt the Critical Interpreters of this place. The sense of
our Author is, Principles could never have altered their present position and
conjunctu^^s; and so by consequent, men must have expected no more creations.
New compositions or repairing of things decayed in the world, which we have
hitherto described to be their constant and natural office whilst they were
thus pressed, and surcharged under a burden so vast and weighty; for that
being naturally heavy as devoid of inanition (the sole principle or cause of
Levity) they must of necessity have been thus miserably percipitated,

At nunc nimirum requies data principiorum
Corporibus nulla est; quia nihil est funditus imum,
Quo quasi confluere, and seeds ubi ponere possint:
Semper and assiduo motu res quaeque geruntur
Partibus in cunctis, aeternaque suppeditantur
Ex infinito cita corpora materiai.
But now have principles no rest at all,
Since there is no bottom into which they fall
Or flowing tend, and make a fixed repose;
But each thing by assiduous motion goes
Through all parts, and the eternal bodies be
(Thus moved) supplied from Infinity.
Lastly,
Postrem^ ante oculos rem res finire videtur:
Aer dissaepit collis, atque era montes:
Terra mare, etc.
-- That one thing the other bounds is plain,
For Air invests the Hills, Hills air again,
And Earth the Seas, etc. --
Our incomparable Poets last argument, taken from the evidence of our own
senses, which the learned Bruno thus illustrates: Our very eyes (says he)
acknowledge as much; because still we see that one thing ever comprehends the
other; and may sentiamo ne con esterno, ne con interno senso cosa non compresa
da altra O simile, etc. And there is nothing which terminates it self: In fine,
after no less then eight arguments he concludes, Che non si puo negare il
spacio infinito se non con la voce, come fanno gli pertinaci, etc. nor can it
be denied (he adds) but by the lewdness and clamor of some impertinents, whom
he there convinces in no fewer then twenty skilful and very close arguments,
which it would be here over prolix to repeat. In short thus, There is nothing
which contains or can indeed be said to embrace and bound the Universe, but is
immensly profound, and in a manner infinite, so as the most rapid rivers, and
exuberant streams in the world can never arrive to the limits thereof; and
therefore do they uncessantly glide. Out of this vast space new and never
failing supplies are brought to every thing by a perpetual succession of a like
number of Atoms to a like number, Et medesime parti di materia c^n le
medesime, sempre si convertano, as the same Bruno expresses it, which is
clearly the mind of Epicurus; who proves that not only the Universe is
infinite from its number of Atoms or indefiniteness of Vacuum, but by both
together (for so the verses immediately declare) yet, not as if this Universe
were continuous, but that there are some empty interstices or intermundiums
distant from the body; for

Ipsa modum porro sibi rerum summa parare
Ne possit, natura tenet: quia corpus inani,
Et quod inans a^tem'st, finiri corpore cogit:
Vt sic alternis infinita omnia reddat.
Nature her self seems this to have designed,
That the whole mass of things be not confined.
Because she bodies both in void includes,
And into bodies void again intrudes
Alternately; so that with one and other
She renders all things Infinite together.
Excluding all manner of doubt touching their immensity, without at all
contradicting their natures and operations. In the mean time the obscurity of
the three ensuing lines, has made some learned Commentators desert them as
inexplicable, whilst yet, they seem to present us with this sense. If either
there were only an Infinite or immoderate-immixed* Vacuum, without as infinite
a number of Atoms or bodies to give it term and limits; or were there an
infinity of bodies, and not as infinite a spice for them to act in (for Corpus
terminatur inani, and inane corpore) then

Nec mare, nec tellus, nec Coeli lucida templa,
Nec mortale genus, nec divum corpora sancta
Exiguum possent horai sistere tempus.
-- Seas nor Earth
Nor bright celestial mansions mortal birth,
Nor sacred bodies of the Gods so pure
Could the least portion of time endure.
Nor could any thing enjoy the least permanency, but all would incontinently be
dissolved; for it does not appear that he any where affirmed, the Corruption of
one thing was the product of another, according to the vulgar sense of Schools;
and peradventure he had considered those creatures which are so long nourished
by sleep and other solitary ways: as Bears, Tortoises, Dormice, some sorts of
Summer Birds, In locum.
Flies, and other Insects; which makes Nardius thus wittily exclaim, Edaciores
proinde atque infirmiores sunt Lucretiani Divi, gliribus abstinentibus, etc.
That Lucretius's Gods were more hungry, voratious and weak then even Dormice,
and such abstemious and inconsiderable Animals. He thought that portion of
matter which is necessary for the quotidian supply of decaying compounds, would
have else been lost, and utterly dispersed in so vast, bottomless, and
indeterminate Abyss: nor that any thing could ever likely meet again, produce,
or create, if supplies were not equally as infinite. The truth is, there is no
such extreme difficulty to comprehend a space in a manner indeterminate (to say
Infinite were impious) so many learned persons having contended; the Infinite
God being able to effect things infinitely exceeding our slender speculations.
Heraclitus says, (...). That the greatest of Gods wonderful works were not
known to some men, because of their incredulity. And as Chrysippus adds,
Lactant. de ira dei.
Si quid est quod efficiat ea, quae homo licet ratione sit praeditus, facere
non possit; id profecto est majus, and fortius and sapientius homine, etc. if
there be any thing created which exceeds the skill and utmost comprehension of
the wisest man upon earth, See Mountague. Ess^ys, l. 2 p 695. paris, 1587.
it is certainly made by one who is infinitely greater, more powerful and wiser
then man, etc. And so an actual multiplicity, though not infinity of worlds
there may be, whilst we content our selves with the belief of a possibility
that there may be more then we are aware of: For Indefinite is not Infinite,
man may not find the Term, and yet a Term there may be. Let men only modestly
remember to reserve the Infinite which the Divines term Essentiae, that the
speculation may be the safer. The rational and acute Bruno (so frequently
cited) has traveled far on this Argument: Sed Concedamus, ut impune de mundis
deliravit. We are not to look on him as the first that broached it, Anaximenes,
Xenophon, Zeno being all of the same Creed; Thales indeed affirmed that there
was but one World, and that created by God. Empedocles taught the same, but yet
he held it to consist of a very small particle of the Universe. Democritus and
Epicurus spoke aloud that there were infinite worlds, these are followed by
their disciple Metrodorus, who believed them innumerable, because their Causes
were so: and that it was not less absurd to affirm but one World in the
Universe, then that a fruitful and luxurious field should produce but one
single spike of Corn. As for the plurality of Continents (of which Monsieur
Borel has promised an express Treatise) truly such as are conversant in those
admirable Speculations which the late most perfect Telescops present us, may
(in my judgment) without the aid of any extraordinary fantasy, imagine the
many apparences both of the Moon and other celestial Bodies to be something
more analogical to what many late writers have reported and delivered of them,
then those who only gaze on them with a less discerning and discoursive eye,
the want of Instruments, or a prejudicate and obstinate opinion; and for my
part, so long as the consideration of these things does rather add to and
heighten the adoration of that infinite power of the great God, who is said to
have created the worlds, I shall forbear to censure such as have favored and
promoted these Doctrines and Opinions; Heb. 1, 2. 11. 3.
amongst whom I esteem many of our late and best Astr^nomers, not only
thinking, but rational and exploring persons; for such were Kepler, Tyco,
Galilaevs, Descartes, Gassendus, Hevelius, and diverse others of extraordinary
note; and yet I shall not be obstinate or too dogmatical, adeo nefas
existimandum est, Lact. de origin erroris.
ea scrutari quae Deus voluit esse caelata. Whether there be or no, God only
knows, who is both intus and foris, not as in Loco; but as being Ens Infinitum
principiumque cui omne innititur Ens. Conclude we therefore this infinitely
confounding discourse, so difficult and incomprehensible, with those apposite
words of Pliny writing of the Globe of this vast Universe, Lib. 2. c. 1. hist.
not.
Furor est (says he) profecto furor est egredi ex eo, and tanquam ejus cunct a
plane jam sint nota ita scrutare extra; qua vero mensuram ullius rei possit
agere qui sui nesciat, aut men's hominis videre quae mundus ipse non capiat.
It Is a madness in earnest, a mere madness to go out of it, and so to be
perpetually seeking without, as if already we had attained to a perfect
cognizance of the things which are within; as if he who knows not his own,
could take the exact dimensions of another thing; or that the wit of any man
should pretend to perceive those things which the very world it self cannot
comprehend.

Well, but possibly to salve this prescribed number of Atoms, some it is
conceived might yet object, that albeit the Space were never so infi^ite, and
that indeed the Principles being finite, might therein seem to be at so
desperate a loss, as in all likelihood never to make an hapy encounter again;
yet by a Providence, or some Almighty power all this might be composed, and
they brought about to meet and unite as at the first: when as Mercator and some
others with a little alteration fancied, that the great Architect should fasten
a Center into the Vacuum or Thohu, qualified so, as that it could summon into
it self all the congenial parts of the Chaos, which in a moment properate to
it, and so become coagmentated into one Globe by an equilibration of parts to
the Center of gravity.

This hypothesis that Epicurus might absolutely resute (who as has been
showed, had but a very slender opinion of any divine hand in the oeconomic and
moderation of sublunary things, besides his dismission of any Center) the
greatly mistaken man tells us, that we are in no wise to conceive as if these
Principles did range themselves into so goodly an order by any such disposion,
providence, or regular proceedure,

Nam certe neque consilio primordia rerum
Ordine se quaeque atque sagaci mente locarunt:
Nec q^os quaeque darent motus pepigere profecto:
Sed quia multa modis multis mutata per omne
Ex infinito vexantur percita plagis,
Omne genus motus, and coetus experiundo;
Tandem deveniunt in talis disposituras,
Qualibus haec rebus consistit summa creata, etc.
For lets not think these principles did range
Themselves in order, and by counsel change,
That each particular motion was decreed
Before by compact; But 'twas this indeed,
That passing frequent changes, and in those
Enduring as it were eternal blows,
After all Trials did in fine quiess
In the same posture which they now possess,
Whence the whole sum of all things else are made.
The Stoics were of opinion, that the Worlds had been frequently destroyed, or
rather decayed and dissolved by time; but that still, Phoenix like, they were
continually restored from the ashes as it were of the expiring Fabric. Now
Epicurus makes this restoration to proceed from the changes and fortunate
encounter of his Atoms; or indeed it was rather the invention of Leucippus
first; touching the fortuitous motion whereof, we do not take our Philosopher
as intending Fortune, or any divine and disposing Cause, but merely the happy
and chancely coition of those bodies and principles which begat the Universe.
This magazine or Caos of Atoms being of so different figures, shapes,
dimensions, indefatigably and restlesly moving too and fro, up and down, in
Space unlimitted and infinite inanity, Lib. 1. de finibus.
in quo (says Cicero) nec summum, nec infimum, nec medium, nec ultimum, nec
extremum sit; these Individua Corpora (I say) continually justling, urging and
crowding one another by so incessant an inquietude and estuation, upon all
encounters imaginable, and for so many myriads happly of ages, and long time,
having thus essayed, as it were, all possible configurations, changes,
postures, successions, mutual and reciprocal agitations, chanced (O wondrous
chance!) See Bruno. Dialogo 2 p. 47 ad 50. Virg. Ecl. 6. Namque canebat uti
magnum per inane coacta.
at last, once, every one of them, to encounter, consent (those of like forms
meeting and uniting together) and fall into that goodly Fabric and admirable
Architecture of the Universe or World, which with so much Ecstasy and wonder we
daily contemplate; and in this instant it was that the gross precipitated
down^wards, compelling the more easy and light upwards, which convening in the
circumference of the immense Poles wedged each other into the form of that
Canopy which we call the Heaven or expansum. Hence from the more compacted
resulted the mass of Earth, whilst the remanent of a more middle nature, upon
the concourse of its condensed particles ran into the humid substance; part
whereof being afterward fitly prepared, was exalted into those glorious
luminaries which adorn the celestial concave; whilst the residue was reserved
for the composition of other bodies. What shall I add more? Implevit numerum
perfectae insaniae, Lact. de ira dei.
ut nihil ulterius adjici posset, whilst he denies God to have any hand in all
this, and makes the Creation of the world not unlike some fears performable by
the supreme Elixir or Philosophers stone. For indeed what greater madness can
there be, then to imagine that a Sword or a Book were made propter finem, for
some end, and that the whole Universe, the great Code of Nature, our Eyes and
other members, Plants, and a thousand natural and wonderful Curiosities (so far
surpassing all things of Art) should result from chance only? But yet however
new and very ridiculous this Systeme may seem, as oppugned by the eloquent
Lactantius, and the captiv'd-learned of other Ages since, who have parted with
their liberty to the Stagirit, by an absolute bargain and sale without power of
redemption ( Automation only, and so fortuitous, casual and impiuos
conjuncture exploaded) this Methodical Hypothesis is not of so vast difficulty
for a rational, pious, and practical Philosopher to believe and rely on, as
happily appears at the first discovery. Method.
I remember it is the opinion of the great Cartesius, that though God had given
no other form to the World then that of the Chaos, so that, establishing Laws
to Nature, he had afforded his concurrence that it should so act, as usually
she does, one might safely believe (without violating the Miracle of the
Creation) that by it alone all things which are purely material, might in time
have rendered themselves such as we now behold them to be: But if there be any
who shall please to dissent, or desire a more evident demonstration of our
former seeming Paradox, let the Reader consult the incomparable and often cited
Petrus Gassendus his Animadversions on Diog. Laert. l 10. p. 193. and
particularly de exortu mundi; or if he will be satisfied by tradition, as it is
rarely well explained to his hand in that learned digression of our ingenious
Dr. Charleton, where this our Poets Theory of Atoms is most artificially and
perspicuously demonstrated; the sum whereof being much to our present purpose,
is, that the dissiculty of resolving how this Mass on which we dwell, and of
which indeed we partly are, should be composed of Principles so described, will
appear to be no such vast incongruity, if we give our selves leave but
gradually to consider, and imagine the earth as but one solitary part of the
Universe, composed of many such congestions; and then by consequence we must
grant that the Ball may be coagmentated of many smaller portions or masses
heaped one upon another; as sometimes mountains from an aggregation of rocks;
these rocks from an accumulation of Stones; these stones again, from a
multitude of grains of sand; that sand, from an assembly of dust; and lastly,
the dust, from a less (but innumerable) collection of imperceptible Atoms or
Principles. I shall not proceed to his exact Arithmetical suppositions upon 25
ciphers successively posited to exhibit a number of granules or terrella's
competent to the bulk of the world it self; because I will not weary my Reader.
But touching the fortuitous production of the Universe, frustis quibusdam
temere concurrentibus, ^^w indeed of the Ancients favored the opinion, Lact. de
ira dei.
and therefore with the Father, quanto melius fuerat tacere, quam in usus tam
miserabiles, tam inanes habere linguam! yet what they have said, written and
confessed of the First Mover, is very admirable, considering that they had
only natural reason for their guide. Thales Milesius, Pythagoras, Plato, etc.
the learned Grotius in his assertion of the verity of Christian Religion, sums
them all together, and makes it evident that they ascribed it only to God;
nay, that the Almighty was even himself in all things; as the Apostle does
truly and divinely philosophize to the superstitious Athenians; Acts 17. 28.
yea, and Aristotle (as much an Atheist as many take him to have been) held it
in his more mature and serious thoughts, as may be deduced from diverse
expressions in his book de mundo (if his with Justin Martyrs esteem thereof; or
the late Fort. Licetas, who has somewhere given us a learned vindication of
that great man. As for any other chancely production (such as our Epicurus, de
Religione Aristotelis. Vide Cic. de Fat^.
Heraclitus, Empedocles, Parmenides, Democritus, Leucippus and Aristotle seemed
at first to endulge) by which all things were constrained to act by certain
fatal necessities; that objection how those curious animals, perfect and
admirable plants, etc. could by a commencement so ex^^aordinary be so
exquisitely built, composed and excogitated, as that the mere consideration
even of a Gnat, or the eye of a silly Fly, the least particle of the Microcosm
(man's body) has been able to open the eyes of one of the worlds most learned
Atheists, without the Divine Providence and some Omnipotent Cause, Galen. de
usu partium. l. 3.
is undoubtedly not to be imagined, much less demonstrated, well therefore
might he thus break out, Compono hic profecto canticum in creatoris nostri
laudem; and who that shall seriously contemplate this, can hold from joining in
the Canticle with him? for so may we with as much reason believe that a great
volume of exquisite Sentences, the historical relation of some intricate and
veritable affair, or Epique Poem in just and exact measures should result from
the fortuitous and accidental mischance of a Printers Alphabet, the letters
falling out of their nests confusedly, Plin. l, 37 c. 1. Alex. ab. Alex.
genial. dier. l. 5. c. 9. Albert. Mag. in Meteor Majolus. Pancirol. c. 17.
without the disposition of either Author or Artist. It is very true, that a
pregnant and mechanic imagination may in such a multifarious variety of some
variegated Achates, and extravagantly veined marbles, fancy many pretty, and
even wonderful things; but besides that this is very rare, save in Chymaera's,
and that for most part to melancholy persons; I presume never any yet affirmed
to have seen them move, Relieve or discourse, unless such as were abused
Oracles, and those who yet discern not the imposture of the blood, sweat and
motion of Images, like that which commended St. Tho. of Aquine, and bad St.
Bernard good morrow: of which number it were at present somewhat difficult to
make me.

Well, the fortunate marriage and co^tion of these Principles happening during
the progress of so many attempts into so goodly a fabric, has ever since
continued so; affording matter, and all competent supples, both for the
repar^tion and composition of each individual; having ever since directly
steered that course and orderly posture, from whence the sum of all things are
derived: or as our Poet better,

Qualibus haec rebus consistit summa creata:
Et multos etiam magnos servata per annos.
Vt semel in motus conjecta est convenientis,
Efficit, ut largis avidum mare fluminis undis
Integrent amnes, and solis terra vapore, etc.
Whence the whole sum of all things else are made,
And keeing in due motion do not fade,
Nor are at all impeach't: for many years
This mass preserved in its fit posture, steers
The Course of rivers, and does cause they keep
With pregnant waves entire the greedy deep:
That the Sun quickened earth renews her fruits:
That Animals bring forth, and new recruits
Cherish ethereal fires, which in no wise
Could be, unless abundant matter rise
From infinite; whence all that lost have been
Are wont in time to be repaid again.
That is, they have never since that moment deviated from their original
designed, stated and equal motions; nor sunk any lower, to hinder or discompose
the rest; for without this infinite supply of matter, Rivers themselves would
have become channels of dust; the Sun and Planets waxed cold, dim, and without
influence: the Vegetables wither, and our very bodies emerge to an utter
destruction both of the Species and Individual.

Nam veluti privata ^ibo natura animantum
Diffluit amittens corpus; sic omnia debent
Dissolvi, simul ac defecit suppeditare
Materies recta regione aversa viai.
For, as in Animals of nourishment
Deprived, bodies are lost, and nature's spent;
So all things must dissolve, when matter flies,
Or deviating fails of due supplies.
To show us after what sort, without constant and material supplies, the decay
of compounds and concretes would infallibly happen: for he supposed that even
the world it self was obnoxious to this decay and final dissolution by a
perpetual percussion; yet that so ordered, as that the force was every where
partial, and no where affecting the whole; so that in this respiration or
escape of Principles, there remains a convenient space and opportunity for new
recruits, where there is need of them. And this I take to be the mind of our
Author in this obscure passage,

Cudere enim crebro possunt, partemque morari.
Dum veniant aliae, ac suppleri summa qu^atur:
Interdum resilire tamen coguntur, and una
Principiis rerum spatium, tempusque f^gai
Largiri, ut possint a Coetu libera ferri, etc.
Strike they indeed might often, and thereby
Retard a part till they the whole supply:
Others again rebound, and are compelled
A space for principles of things to yield
And time to slip away: that they might be
(Thus dis-united) set at liberty, etc.
For Principles do not eternally cohear and remain thus in compounded bodies;
but those which are loose and disengaged wander up and down at liberty, till
they be coupled with some others by the same just encounter and fortunate
chances; since it is perpetually that principles do wear off from things, and
have no lease of eternity to continue them for ever. He concludes,

-- Suboriri multa necesse est.
Et tamen ut plagae quoque possint suppetere ipsae
Infinita opus est vis undique materiai, etc.
Therefore there is extreme necessity
That still of things spring up variety;
And that there should be infinite supplies
Of matter, which may for those strokes suffice.
But we hasten to another,
Illud in his rebus long fuge credere, Memmi,
In medium summae quod dicunt omnia niti, etc.
To these things Memmius then no credit lend
When they say all things to the Center tend;
Pursuing his opinion of Infinite, our Poet admonishes his friend of the
infection of the Peripateticks, Stoics, and ancient Academicks: And in short,
whoever asserted but one solitary and finite universe, and by consequent that
there was no definite center toward which every ponderous thing did
spontaneously incline and verge; as on the contrary, that every light thing did
mount upward; v. g. that the earth was sustained by the endeavor and shouldring
up of something beneath it; seeing Epicurus (who both affirmed a plurality of
worlds, Infinite extension, etc.) granted neither middle nor extremes to any
thing: so that upon our Poets account, there was none of those natural
tendencies of heavy and light things, since in a space undeterminate and
unlimitted, every place might with as much reason be said to be center as any
particular; and indeed Plato himself seems to question any Sursum or Deorsum in
nature at all* ^l^t. in Tem.
for (says he) the whole heaven is round, 'twere absurd therefore to call any
part higher or lower as in relation to the middle. Nor think, says our Carus,
That,

-- Quae pondera sunt sub terris, omnia sursum
Nitier, in terramque retro requiescere posta, etc.
All those weights beneath be upwards pressed
That they may on this Hemisphere repose.
At the very Central Subterranean point, which ascend to the Superficies, and
there remain like a piece of coin in the bottom of a basin of water, which to
one that obliquely observes, seems by the continual refraction to ascend and
librate upon the surface thereof,

Vt per aquas quae nunc rerum simulacra videmus.
Et simile ratione animalia subtus vagari
Contendunt, neque posse e terris in loca Coeli
Recidere inferiora magis quam corpora nostra
Sponte sua possint in Coeli templa volare:
Illi cum videant solemn, nos sidera noctis
Cernere. etc.
Whence they maintain that as calm water show^
Shaddows, and Images of things, that so
Beneath our Feet some Animals do go,
Which on th'inferior regions of the sky
Can no more fall, then may our bodies fly
Up to Celestial thrones; that they see light
Of Sun, when we enjoy the stars of night.
For he laughed at the conceit of Antipodes, where weights also tended to the
Center, as with us; or that men should really walk as our shadows appear to do*
when we are by the margent of some calm water: That there were places where the
inhabitants enjoyed succession of seasons; and where Creatures could no more
fall downwards, then our bodies here mount upwards, and knock their heads
against the opposite hemisphere; of which it seems a few (even in our Poets
time) had some faint conjectures, as may be collected by the scoff which
Demonactes put upon one that discoursed with him of those who inhabited the
regions (...), where leading one of them to the mouth of a we^l, Numquid (says
he) tales esse Antipodas asseris? The same conceit I suppose it was, which made
Lucius (as Plutarch reports) deride those opiners in his time, De mac. in Orb,
Lun.
who fancied men to crawl there with their backs downwards, like Cats, Mice,
and Spid^s upon the walls and ceelings of our houses,

Sed Vanus stolidis haec omnia finxerit error:
Amplexi quod habent perversae prima viai, etc.
But some fond error first these things devised
Amongst silly men, for that they nere comprised
The pure originals of things aright.
And indeed I easily believe that our Poet (who ^tis likely with Justin Martyr
and others, took the heavens for a Tent or the flat cover of a box) little
dreamt of our Antipodes; De Divin. Just. l. 3. c. 23. De civit. dei l. 16. c.
9. See Acosta, l. 1. c. 11.
when even many wi^e men, and greatly illuminated persons, particularly
Lactantius, and St. Augustine, were for sundry ages so difficult of belief, as
may be well perceived in the story of Virgilius a German Bishop, recited by
Aventinus in hist. Bojorum* who had like to have shrewdly suffered for a little
savouring of this mistaken Heresy; only we find in Plutarch de Placitis
Philos. that Oecetos affirmed there were two earths, 'twixt which Philolaus a
disciple of his interserted another continent of Fire; which opinion
Sandivogius and other Hermetick Philosophers have also illustrated: In novolum:
In Medea.
but that which the Tragedian has left us upon record, if it were not by
inspiration and prophecy, was certainly (next that of our Poets rare encounter
of Atoms) most happily gu^ssed,

Venient anni^ secula seris
Quibus Oceanus vincula rerum
Laxet, and ingens pateat tellus,
Typhi^que novos detegat Orbs
Nec sit Terris ultima Thule,
Hereafter there an Age shall spring,
Wherein the bands of every thing
Seas shall enlarge, Typhis moreover
Large Tracts, and New worlds shall discover,
Then Thule the Earth shall bound no more.
In the mean time Lucretius imagined the Earth to be as it were riveted, or
rooted in the Air, as Anaxagoras did according to Aristotle, and that the
radices thereof were fungous, light, and of no considerable weight toward its
foundation: where as it approached ^igher and deeper, so it became more thin,
delicate, and of near affinity to the air, so as we may conceive some sponge
or plant to grow in the sea; and that only the ^uperior face or inhabitable
part, was the compacted, solid and heavy. Thus Lucretius and some others,
thought good to give the world a Cushion, whilst commiserating the mistakes of
the rest of mankind, he tells them that their ignorance only proceeded from
this ill comprehending and misinformation of his Principles;

Nam medium nihil esse potest, ubi inane loc^sque
Infinita: n'que omnino, si jam medium sit,
Possit ibi quidquam hac potius consistere caussa,
Quam quavis alia long regione manner.
For since that void and place are infinite,
Nothing can center be; or if there were
A medium, yet no reason does appear
To prove, that it should but in one place dwell,
And in another not be found as well.
For, as has been said, Epicurus admitted not of any Center or Medium, the
space being infinitely Vacuum. But as touching the motion of his Principles, he
affirmed that there was a Superior or an Inferio^ Region from whence they
freely came in a perpendicular and paral^l motion perpetually descending; yet
so, as that from whatsoever part they issued (as suppose it in respect to our
common accep^ation, from beneath our feet, or over our heads, Zenith or Nadir)
ye^, that, he established for above, whence they came; and, that, for, beneath,
whither they tended: albeit, I say, they seemed in our apprehension, to mount
upwards, fly obliquely, or collaterally, from what point of the Compass soever.
As for Plato's opinion of medium and extremum we are to understand it
comparatively, as that to be inferum toward which a body did spontaneously and
naturally ^end: that supremum whither that body was compelled by force; of
which sort of motions, whether they be performed naturally, or by some
clandestine and magnetic attraction impressed, or by any other existent
qualities of the Peripateticks, let the more learned define, it would appear a
digression incapable of an Apology, to dilate thereon in this place. We
conclude therefore with our Poet.

Haud igitur possunt tali ratione teneri
Res in consilio medii cuppedine victae:
Things therefore cannot in such sort be joined,
As to the middle by desire inclind.
Praeterea, quoniam non omnia corpora fingunt
In medium niti, sed terrarum, atque liquoris,
Humorem ponti, etc. --
Besides it is clear, because they do not faign
As if all bodies would the center gain;
But such alone as most terrestrial be
And liquid, like the waters of the sea, etc.
Which two last verses together with a full dozen following, Dionysius Lambinus
has placed next the four extreme lines of the first book: but finding no other
edition to follow him in the transposition; nor indeed that it does much import
the sense (which all agree to be one of the most obscure passages in our
Author) I have chosen rather to follow the more frequent and general
impressions, the thing being no more then this* Lucretius finds fault with his
Antagonists, that whilst they first affirmed all things tended to the Center;
now, as unmindeful of what they had formerly established, seem only to destine
some bodies particularly to the medium, such as the Earth and Water: which
(^^ith our Poet) is utterly false, since it is notorious, that even the most
ponderous bodies ascend also. This he infers from the production of Animals and
Plants which both arise out of, and are nourished by the Earth; that is, by the
ascension thereof in juice and other materials whereby they are fed and
propagated; nay, the trees seem to be even thrust out from beneath it; piercing
as it were the surface thereof with their circular or boaring motion, whereas
they (whom here he contends withal) affirm only the more light (such as Air
and Fire) to mount upwards and minister nourishment to the Planets: and so per
consequens, move from the medium, contrary to what they before asserted. And if
this be not the interpretation of this difficult place, I shall leave it to the
more penetrant judgments, and satisfy my self with what a learned Author has
said thereon (who yet has not adventured upon this exposition) Omnino hic
locus est aliquantum difficilis, atque obscurus (together with the rest which
follows, for even the Critical Lambinus is forced to confess it) Totus hic
locus qui deinceps sequitur, miserabilem in modum perturbatus and confusus
erat, ex qua ordinis perturbatione, ita obscurus erat, ut nulla ex ea
probabilis sententia elici posset, etc. which makes him (though to small
purpose) repeat,

Quin, sua quod natura petit, concedere pergat.
But, as its nature is, must ^till give place:
Which verse he used once before, speaking of the Center; and Johann^s Nardius
to insert,

Terra det at supra circumtegere omnia Coelum:
Ne Volucrum ritu, etc. --
But Pareus ^will have it joined to the antecedent Verses,

Illud i^ his rebus long fuge credere, Memmi, etc.
As we have already explained it, which makes him to exclaim also on this
passage as an ingens (...). But I conclude,

Ne volucrum ritu flammarum, moenia mundi
Diffugiant subit^ magnum per Inane soluta,
Et ne cetera con^imili ratione sequantur:
Neve ruant Coeli tonitralia templa supurne,
Terraque se pedibus raptim subducat, and omnes
Inter permixtas rerum, coelique ruinas
Corpora solventes, abeant per inane profundum etc.
For else like hasty flames already fled
The worlds bright walls would vanish suddenly
Through the vast void dissolved, the rest would be
After the same sort hurried; that from high
Would drop the thundering turrets of the sky,
And under-foot the sinking ^arth to bend,
Whilst the same ruin earth with heaven would blend,
Crushing all bodies with disordered force
Through the profound abyss to steer their course,
So that one moment would no relic leave,
Save Elements which no eye could perceive,
And desert space; for from what part so e're
You would that bodies first receding were,
That part an open sluice of death must prove
Where matter issuing forth would downwards move.
Deriding the opinions and Panick fears of the Stoics, who whilst they
obstinately maintained their medium and extreme, without infinite space, were
compelled to acknowledge an absolute ruin, and total dissipation of this
goodly fabric, unless the limits thereof had been exceedingly fortified, and
strongly hooped about: for they taught that it hung ponderibus librata suis, by
a magnetical vigor impressed upon the entire machine at the first by the
Almighty; but principally communicated from the Center to both the Extremes,
and that by meridional projection, through which combination and conjunction of
parts, as by hoops the whole Universe was steadfastly compacted, so as it could
not be moved, least otherwise, like a broken hourglass, or leaking Vessel, all
should issue out, sink, and be dissipated through its many cra^ic chinks and
overtures, and so all things resolve into their first Principles,

-- Sic cum compage soluta
Secula tot mundi suprema coegerit hora,
Antiquum repetens iterum Chaos, omnia mistis
Sidera ^ideribus concurrent; ignea pontum
Astra petent: tellus extendere littora nolet,
Excutietque fretum: fratri contraria Phoebe
Ibit, and obliquum bigas agitare per orbem
Indignata, diem poscet sibi: totaque discors
Machina divulsi turbabit faedera mundi, etc.
As Lucan expresses it, Phars* l. 1. May.
and his Interpreter thus,

So when this knot of Nature is dissolved,
And the worlds ages in one hour involved
In their old Chaos, seas with skies shall join,
And stars with stars confounded lose their shine;
The Earth no longer shall extend its shore
To keep the Ocean out: The Moon no more
Follow the Sun; but scorning her old way
Cross him, and claim the guidance of the day:
The falling Worlds now jarring frame no peace
No league shall hold, etc. --
And nothing remain but the vast and desert Vacuum, some relics, Atoms and
broken pieces which by some happy chance might one day be cast again into
another mould, perhaps different in shape from what we now behold it, according
as the materials of the fragments fortuned to light. Aristotle indeed and
Averroes, Cicero, and Xenophanes affirmed the world to be eternal, and no way
obnoxious to this catastrophe: for seeing (as Censorinus has it) they could
not comprehend whether were first, the Bird, or the Egg; so neither could they
investigate that the World had any commencement, or should have conclusion. But
Pythagoras and the Stoics held it corruptible: with these accord Thales,
Hierocles, Anaximenes, Avicen and Philo the Jew; but Plato will not have it
finite, but of the nature of the God that made it; and Democritus said it
should be once destroyed, and never more repaired. Empedocles and Heraclitus
taught that the world was continually repairing and decaying together. But our
Epicurus that it should and might be eternally recreated, that it was to have a
period and be infallibly dissolved; only, he ^ailed about the Agent, as
conceiving it to proceed merely from some natural force, which therefore
rendered it corruptible and subject to dilapidation; namely, in as much as it
had no other production then that of a Plant or Animal. Also from internal and
intestine causes, the intermistion of Vacuum, the perpetual repercussions and
discessions of Atoms, etc. That therefore the World did also man-like
Senescere, as it had together with him its Adolescency and Virile vigor, as
appears in the following, and our Poet once before,

Nam veluti privata cibo, etc. --
Which opinion however peremptorily affirmed as well by Christians as Heathens,
St. ^^pr. and alii.
how false and erroneous it will appear to a just and sober disquisition, I
refer the Reader to the learned Apologist against the Natural decay.

Haec si per^osces parva perductus opella;
(Namque alid ex alio clarescit) non tibi caeca
Nox iter eripiet, quin ultima materiai
Pervideas; Ita res accendunt Lumina rebus.
If then by this s^ight work thou knowledge gain
(For one thing will the other much explain)
Thou can not err, but shall perceive aright
Natures extremes: so Things to Things give light:
These few particulars thus briefly delivered, well underst^o^, and ex^ctly
compared; our Poet assures his (...) friend Memmius will soon render him a
perfect Master in the knowledge of all Natural ca^^^^ whatsoever, in which
Lucretius, as a sworn Epicur^^m, bel^eved to consist the Summum Bonum of
mankind, and most transcendent felicity.

FINIS.
JUst as I was now concluding this Discourse, I received the following Epitaph
from a worthy and learned Friend out of France: It is the Inscription upon the
Monument of the admirable Gassendus, who for being so great an Assertor of
Epicurus's Institution, the Doctrine delivered by our Carus, and a person of
such excellent erudition, deserves highly to be remembered by Posterity.

The Epigraph is as follows:

ERRATA.
IT was not without just occasion that we find the great Lipsius deploring the
negligence of Printers, to have thus complained of the Art, In. praef. ad Lect.
l. Antiq. lect.
Bona sane studiorum nutrix, sed audax, lucri-cupida, calida, and quae non
minus vere corruptrix librorum audiet, quam propagatrix. A censure (if ever)
most applicable and deserved here, and for which (the Author being absent the
whole time that this Piece was in the press) there now remains no other
expedient, but to desire the favorable Reader to reform these Errata subjoined,
before he pass any farther.
