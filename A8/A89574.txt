Speculum Libertatis Angliae Re restitutae: OR THE LOOKING-GLASS OF Englands
Liberty REALLY RESTORED, etc.
Dear Country man,
HERE is no Obscoenity, Scurrillity Sedition, or Calumny exposed to thy view,
to corrupt thy sober mind, or cause the to abuse and mis-imploy thy precious
time and thoughts (as is in the swarms of foolish and rediculous Pamphlets
that shamefully are permitted to fly up and down with uncliped wings, tending
rather to debauch, corrupt, distract, and divide the minds of men, then any way
to compose us to the reception of those sounder and soberer principles and
notions, that may [by Gods affiistance] reduce and happily establish us in a
just and equitable crasis and constitution of a real Commonwealth, which is
the sole and only aim the Author of this Looking-Glass of real Liberty
proposes to himself. And that we may enjoy not only the title and name, but
the very substance and thing it self we have so dearly purchased, our
Parliament has so solemnly promised, and the almost miraculous providence of
their late re-investment and admittance to the full power and opportunity of
effecting it all, call aloud for at their hands: For if they loose and squander
away this gracious season by their slavish fears, self-interests, and their old
deferments and slackness; this is the last expectation (in all probability)
that either God or good men will evermore entertain of them, and they shall
most certainly entaile perpetual and indeleable shame and ignominy on their
name and posterity; and utterly and finally expose this poor Nation (in the
eye of humane reason) to irrecoverable vassallage and slavery, who will rather
choose to endure the worst of evils, than to be enslaved under them, by whom
they have been so often and unsufferably frustrated and deceived. But, that we
are very confident (through the Lords help) should they fail us the second
time, that yet God will not suffer this his own work (wherein from time to time
he has so signally appeared to go backward) but will of his mercy find out,
and raise up such other instruments as shall at last be found worthy and meet
in his hand, to carry it on till it be fully accomplished, and we are made in
very deed as now we are only in name, a real Commonwealth.

In effecting whereof, our Example or Pattern neither must nor can be the old
mode of our Monarchy, new vamped and set up in an other single person; this is
but to put a new piece into an old garment, whereby the rent is made worse, as
we have already experimented: Nor must it be (save in some few particulars that
suit with common reason and justice) the constitution of the Hollanders our
neighbors, or any other, whose forms are chiefly adapted to their several
and respective Scituations, Interests, Relations, Dependencies, Religions, and
manners, and in very many things composed and mixed with base allays of tyranny
and injustice: But ours must be that which will really reduce us to the full
possession of our ancient birthrights as freeborn Englishmen, not only that
small and inconsiderable part or piece thereof, now only Extant, contained in
the magna charta or great Charter (so called) that (...) us so many seas of
blood and millions of treasure to purchase and maintain which yet could never
be fully enjoyed to this day, but also all that right equity and justice, both
in reason and religion, that a free people, and under no force, but of their
own in their representatives, chosen and elected by themselves, can think or
devise to bestow upon themselves to make the constitution of their Government
more just, equitable, and easy; all our interests by our being become a real
Commonwealth, being swallowed up into one common interest, truly and really
intending and regarding the good and benefit as of the whole, so also of every
particular and individual member of the same, by one and the selfsame rule
of equity, which is the only expedient (under God) to unite the hearts of all
true Englishmen in one, and to induce an everlasting peace and settlement to
these warwearied, distracted, and divided nations, which is the earnest prayer
and endeavor of him that is thine and his Countries real friend and
well-willer,

R. M.

An Epitome or Representation of some of the chief Maxims of the Policy, and
laws absolutely requisite, and necessary to the making and constituting the
Nation a real Commonwealth.
THat the Governors and People of these Nations have one and the self-same
equal and common Interest, Privileges, and benefits, in the Policy and Laws
by which they are governed; for if we are a Free State or Commonwealth, every
man, high, or low, rich or poor, Magistrate or Subject, has and ought to
have, one and the self-same right protection and defense from the Law without
exception.

And as this is, and ought to be enacted as one branch of the great Charter,
for, and in respect of the regulation of men's manners and deportments
correcting, and preventing wrongs and injuries, and the preservation of
particular and private interests, (for our great Charter takes especial care
to maintain and secure each man in his particular and private interests) yet is
not private interest, as to Meum et Tuum, that is to mine and thine, left
utterly lawless, unlimited and boundless; for our Commonwealth, though it
may admit of poor, yet must have no beggars, or any that want necessaries, for
we have but three ranks or estates of men amongst us; viz. either those that
have sufficient to supply necessity, or secondly, those that have for
convenience of a more free and comfortable livelihood; or thirdly, those that
have for superfluity and abundance; the superfluity is caused to make a
comfortable supply to the necessity, to prevent beggary; this, and convenience,
do defray the public expense and charges of the Commonwealth, and by this
rule we lay and leavy out public Rates and Taxes; those poor that can and
will work, we take care to set them on work (if they want it) and pay them
liberally; those that can but will not, we compel them to be willing by due
correction; those that would but cannot, as aged persons, children, sick folks,
and diseased, we comfortably provide for them without it in the way aforesaid,
and if we are ncecessitated to raise any public tax or rate over and above
those that are the constant and usual ones of the customs, and excise of Beer
and Ale, etc. sold in Innes and Victualling-houses, we leavy it by way of
subsidy, wherein those bear the burden that are best able, and the tax in it
self is most equal and contentfull.

As to the Legislative power, that is to say, the power of making Laws that
only by the great Charter, is to be and reside in the great and general
assembly of the peoples representatives in Parliament, who alone have power to
make new Laws, and to repeat those that are old, unnecessary, and out of use;
saving, that they have no power given them, by the great Charter aforesaid, to
make any new Law that may break, infringe, or destroy the constitution of our
government, as a Commonwealth. For he, that once but makes a motion of that
either in, or out of the house, is adjudged and executed as a Traitor. And if
our representatives, shall so far forget their oath to God and the Nation, as
to falsify the trust reposed in them, and that the Major part, or the whole,
should vote and enact against the constitution and Character of the government,
then there is a clause in the Character that declares them Traitors, and
absolutely dissolved, and that the People are thereby required to endeavor as
one man, to bring them to condign punishment, and to elect and choose new ones
in their stead, more faithful and better principled to the freedom and common
good of their Country.

These repesentatives are to be chosen by the people of the Nation, in every
Province or County, and at their first fittingare all sworn inviolably to
maintain the great Charter of the Commonweales constitution, in the aforesaid
choice and election, no man's suffrage or vote, is ecepted but only men of
dessolute lives and conversations, and very suspicious, or openly disaffected
persons to the Commonwealth; for such as these may neither choose, nor be
chosen, to bear any public office of trust, and profit, in this Commonwealth.

This great assembly, or Parliament, is to be called trienially, that is to say
once every three years, at least.

As to the executive power, it is by them to be put into the hands of such
persons quallified, without any of the exceptions aforesaid, as they shall
think fit.

And because the same Representative or Parliament, is not to fit durante vita,
during their lives, there is a competent time set; viz. one year at farthest;
with in which time, they are obliged by the Charter of the Commonwealths
constitution to desolve; and before such their desolation, to appoint and elect
a Counsel of State out of themselves, who are to manage all affairs in the
intervalls, according to such Laws, Ordinances, and instructions, as shall be
made and enacted by the said Parliament before its desolution, and not
otherwise under account, unto the next Representative of such their
transactions and administrations, wherein if they have behaved themselves
wisely, justly, and faithfully, they are honored and thanked, if otherwise,
discarded, disgraced, and punished. As soon as the new Representative sits, as
aforesaid, the power of the Council of State shall cease and be determined
until another be by them newly elected, and by this means our Grandees of
State will know, and be made sensible, as well what it is to obey, and be
subject, as to rule and govern, experimenting both conditions.

This council of State forementioned, has power and instruction upon great
and necessary emergencies of State, as in case of foreign invasions, making
war, and concluding peace, or, raising new impositions and taxes on the people,
to call a Parliament before the trieniall course revolve and come about, for
they are not entrusted to transact such important affairs on their own heads,
without the advice and consent of the great assembly of Parliament, yet may
they issue forth any Proclamations and orders, that they shall see fit and
necessary, for the better observation, and execution of the Laws, already made
and enacted for the peace and well Government of the Commonwealth.

The title that we give this counsel of State is, viz. The keepers of the
Liberties of the Commonwealth of England, authorized by act of Parliament: and
in this manner, both our selves and foreign States make our addresses to
them, and in like manner run all our Law processes, and commissions to any
Ministers of State, millitary or civil, in the intervalls.

The Commonwealth gives no honors unto any man, other than his virtues merit,
in being servicable to the State in this, or in some honorable trust and
employment for the public: Wealthy men, and of great estates, otherwise are of
small reputation and account, but amongst their own Tennants and Creditors.

If any entrusted in state affairs, grows rich insensibly, if he were not so
before, we forthwith lay him aside, as suspected of secret deceit, falsnesse,
and bribery.

All offices of trust and profit, as they are conferred on the most able and
deserving men, without respect to private relations, so are they given freely
also, that the greater may their obligation be to use them without oppression
of the people, and the more their shame and guilt if they abuse them.

Those deserving men of smaller estates, and are preferred to places of profit;
and those of greater, to places of honor and trust, but all must be alike
faithful and honest, in all respects that are employed in the one or other.

And as we do in civil, thus also we do in millitary commands, and offices,
for we keep a small Army always of about ten thousand Horse and Foot, besides
these in some four or five of our most considerable Ports: and garrisons, to
hinder intestine insurrections, or foreign invasions and to take up all loose
straggling and martial spirits, whose minds cannot settle to any civil calling
or employment, who yet by discreet discipline will be kept out of harms way,
and made very serviceable to the Commonwealth, for the ends aforesaid. These
also serve for a guard to the great assembly of Parliament, whilst they fit,
and to the Council of State, in the intervalls to suppress and keep under
the headiness, ininsolency, and disaffection of the the baser sort of our
Metropolis, if not in other respects, yet in regard of their opinions and
principles to the Commonwealths government, who by their self conceit, Pride
and rashness, would soon unsettle our Commonwealth, and undo themselves,
were it not for these, and the Tower, of which especial care must be taken,
that it be in the hands of a man of great sufficiency of parts of most approved
fidellity and sincerity to the Commonwealth.

We have also our Militias of trained bonds, of horse and foot, raised in each
County, and disciplined and trained in the exercise of arms at certain set
times, at least four times in a year, commanded by able and honest Commanders,
that they may be ready upon some few hours warning, to appear in arms for
the defense of their Country, and of their Laws and Liberty.

Our Representatives retain the power and office of Generalissimo in their
own hands, whilst they fit, and delegate it to the Keepers of the Liberties of
England, in the intervalls.

They themselves appoint their Leivtenant General by act of Parliament, who
ought to be a man, not only truly valiant, but also one really possessing the
quallifications declared by the Commonwealth, viz. one truly fearing God, a
lover of all the people of God, and if he have these two, he can hardly want
all the rest that becomes of a Commonwealths man, the which is absolutely
required, in the person that shall command our Army.

Our Laws are few, necessary, plain, and easy, (without any quirkes and
quiddities) to be understand by the most vulgar capacities.

Our Lawyers and Administrators of Justice are as few. Our Law processes,
tritalls, and determinations are as speedy unexpencible, and as little
verations as may be, for we have our Law administered de deie in diem, daily, at
our own doors, as it were, that is to say, in every County: the Judges and
administrators constantly attendin on that business.

No Lawsuit or cause after the first day of hearing (wherein there must be no
delay used) must depend undetermined above one month, nor any above one year
and a day, and that is only when some of the material parties or witnesses to
the cause, are beyond the seas, and cannot have notice and warning, and this
under a great penalty to the Judges, before whom the said cause depends.

The Plaintiffs and Defendants, and their witnesses, are to speak before the
Judges, viva voco, and to plead their own causes; for neither incriminall nor
judicial causes do we allow any advocates, except the Plaintiff and
Defendant, one or both be Idiots, natural Fools, or not compos mentis, that
is, mad, or besides themselves.

The Judge of our Courts have no Fees, bnt constans set salleries paid them by
the State for that service, these, salleries are partly paid out of the fines
and amercements set on Litigious persons, that are cast and condemned in their
causes, for the Judges are to lay severe fines on them, as for disturbing the
private peace of their honest neighbors, so also for troubling the
Commonwealth.

We allow Appeals from our County Courts, to the highest Court of our
Metropolis; but he that will appeal must give good bond and security, that he
shall make good his appeal, or else to forfeit the same that he is bound in,
the one half to the party, for whom the cause was adjudged, in the said County
Court, and the other half to Commonwealth toward the use aforesaid.

We have no particular Court of Chancery, that may Monopolize the determination
of all causes of equity wholly to it self, but all our Courts have power, as to
Judge of the jus, and Law, so also of the equity and conscience of any cause,
that depends before them. We have none Prerogative Courts, for the very name is
abominable, and the thing diametrically opposite to the charter of our
Commonwealths constitution. But all maritime causes are determined, in the
other Courts, under whose jurisdictions and precincts they happen and fall, who
have power to determine according to reason and equity in all such cases, for
the Civil law or jus gentium is no other, besides some few sea customs and
usages, which are well known to every experienced Seaman, and therefore the
jurors in all maritime causes ought to be of Seamen and Mariners.

And as for the probate of wills, and differences about them, they also are to
be decided in the usual Court, Save that the willis to be recorded by the
register of each County, as all other public acts and contracts of that
nature, ought to be as hereafter is expressed.

And if any Judge, or any other Officer or administrator of justice, take any
bribe, directly or indirectly, by himself, wife, servant, or friend, and it be
proved he shall loose his place, and office, durante vita, during life, and
forfeit treble, the vallue of the bribe, so taken to the Commonwealth, as also
shall the Person that gave it him, to delay or pervert justice

We have a Court on purpose erected in every County, for the Trial of all men's
claims and titles to any estate and therefore Proclamation is made to all such
as pretend to have any such right, title, or claims, to any inheritance, or
estate as well as aforesaid; (if the said claimers live within the Land) that
they bring in, and make forth their claim, in three months, next after such a
Proclamation made, as aforesaid, or in one year and a day at farthest, or else
they are to be for ever after, fore-judged and concluded by their own voluntary
and wilful neglect. Thus all titles and claims to all estates in the Nation,
being cleared and the property, assertined a public register is appointed in
every County, Market Town, and Town corporate, those in the Market Towns,
and corporate Towns aforesaid, to be the deputies of the register of the
County, with whom all men's inheritances, and all other public bargains,
sales and contracts shall be from time, to time registered, and recorded, and
thence transmitted unto the register General of the Metropolis, once in a
quarter* or sooner.

No man shall be imprisoned for debt (except such of whom it is doubted that
they are running the Country, and then not above three days or a short space,
during which time, he at whose suit he was imprisoned shall give and allow him
3s a day to maintain him there until the matter may be examined by the Judges,
and if no just cause be found for his imprisonment, he at whose suit he was so
imprisoned shall pay him 5 lb an hour for his false imprisonment. But if it be
found just, the imprisoned is forthwith to agree with his Creditor, or to pay
the debt, which if he refuse so to do, he shall make a true confession upon
oath of the real value of his estate, and where, and what, and in whose hand,
or custody it remains, and payment is to be appointed by the Magistrate;
(...) of it the, said goods and estate being sold to the best advantage, and
the overplus, (if any be) to be rendered unto the said Debtor; but in case the
estate and goods will not reach to the payment of the debt, and to leave the
Debtor 5 lb to begin the world again, if the debt be one hundred, or so many
five shillings of each pound, as the debt is under an hundred, for the
Creditor, if he think fit, shall leave so much in his hands; which sum so
left, shall be as an obligation to the Debtor, if ever God make him able, to
pay his Creditor the whole debt due to him, but if the Creditor will take all,
and leave him nothing, he shall be debarred in Lawsuits for ever from
challenging the remainder of the said debt, from his said Debtor. But in case
that the Creditor shall prove that the Debtor has forsworn himself, and
concealed any part of his estate, to defraud him, that then by the Law the
Debtor shall be esteemed, and punished as a Cutpurse or Fellon.

No man shall be arrested by Sergeants or Bailiffs for debt, save only in the
case aforesaid, but a summons in the nature and form of a Subpaena, is left at
his dwelling house or the last and most usual place of his abode; the summons
expressing the day when, the time and place where, before whom, at whose suit,
of what nature, under what penalty, and if the party summoned shall not
appear, as aforesaid, then shall Proclamation be made in three of the next
adjacent Market Towns, to summon the party and command him to appear within a
certain time limited, and if he then also fail of appearance, if he be within
the Land, he shall be out Lawed, and an execution and extent shall issue
against him and his goods and estate.

That the Religion publicly professed and practiced in this Commonwealth,
shall be the true Protestant Religion, in opposition to Popery, Prelacy, and
all other false Religions.

That a well gifted, honest, able Preaching Ministry be set up in every Parish
in the Commonwealth, to instruct the people to lead their lives in the fear
of God, and in due obedience to the Common wealth.

That the said Parochial Ministry, shall duly Administer the Sacraments of
Baptism and the Lords Supper unto all their Parishoners, that shall make
profession of their faith in God, according to the model thereof laid down in
the Apostles Creed, and are not otherwise men of openly scandalous
conversations, even unto as many of them as shall desire the same.

That those that shall voluntarily and desiredly submit to the public form,
and Administration of the Ordinances as aforesaid. And those that in respect of
scruple consciences shall not, that neither of these disturb each others
assemblies or practice of the ordinances, and that the magistrate command that
Christian peace to be kept among them, one toward the other.

That the Ministers maintenance be Tithes until they have obtained more faith
to trust God, the Christian Magistrate, and the people for their maintenance in
a Gospel way*

That for the encouragement and advancement of humane learning the Universities
of this Nation be kept up and so ordered and regulated that they may be the
Nurseries of good literature, and manners, and not of ignorance idleness,
pride, luxury, irreligion, and other such like sordid vices, and that Latin be
commonly spoken in the Schools, and Colleges, and amongst the Students and
Scholars, that our Nation may not be so generally defective that way as they
are found to be when they come abroad into foreign Nations to their great
shame.

That care be taken, that the Teachers of all public Grammar Schools, be men
well principled in the Protestant Religion, and very able Grammarians, and
expert Linguists at least in two of the Languages, viz. Latin and Greek.

That in every Market Town or great Parish, Free-Schooles be set up to
instruct and teach poor peoples children of both sexes, at least to read,
until they be fit to be put forth, or placed in services, both which to be at
the puplick and common charges.

That no Corporations exercise any laws, customs, usages, or prescriptions
contrary to reason, equity, common right, and liberty of every freeborn
Englishman, as is expressed in the great Charter of the Commonwealths
constitution.

That any freeborn Englishman, or native, may set up and use any Mechanical
Trade, Profession, or Occupation, in any City, Town, Corporate, or in any place
of this Nation, without exception, whether he have been bound apprentice to it
or no.

That any poor Labourer or Tradesman, as aforesaid, may remove his dwelling
and family into any place of these Nations, where he finds he can get most work
and employment, for the comfortable subsistence of himself and family, without
disturbance, or being sent back again, or enforced to give security that he
shall not be chargable to the Parish, there being due provision made for all
such in the manner here-to-fore mentioned.

We have customs for the maintenance of our Navy, paid upon all imported and
exported commodities, and we do also upon necessity of increasing our Navy,
above the number of our usual guard, impose a new Impost, or Excise as we call
it, which is no other than the doubling the customs on some, or trebling of it
upon other commodities, less useful to the Nation, and more superfluous but
all is managed and collected by one and the self-same Set of officers appointed
for that purpose by means whereof, very much charge and expense is saved to the
Commonwealth, and the Merchant far better contented as being enabled to carry
on his business and trade with much less trouble and perplexity

We have excise also upon Cider, Ale, and Beer, sold in Innes and Alehouses
after the rate of three shillings the Hogshead, allowing one Hogshead in ten
for grounds, and wast Beer, this excise is set, assessed, and assertained on
each Inn and Ale-house-keeper by the Justices of Peace of each County
annually, when they give Licenses to the said Ales-houses.

As also on other customed Alehouses, having taken the best information
possible of the weekly draughts and expense of Beer and Ale sold and
expended in every the said-houses, and the sum being thus accounted, reckoned
and assertained, the several Ale-house-keepers shall enter into bond unto the
Commonwealth, to pay it quarterly, and the moneys so due and payable, to be
received and collected by the Justices of the Peace in their respective
devisions, and transmitted by them into the public treasury; the said
Justices of the Peace, at the time of their annual setting and assertaining of
the excise as aforesaid, transmitting a true and certain account of all such
sum and sums of money, and from whom they are due and payable unto the
Parliament or Counsel of State.

We hold it our interest, if it may any ways stand with the honor and safety
of the Commonwealth, and that we be not justly and unsufferably provoked to the
contrary, to have peace with all Foreign Nations, as finding this most to
conduce to the profit and benefit of the Commonwealth, in advancing trade.
Ballancing the interests and differences of our Neighbors, rather by our
Christian and civil addresses, mediations, and interpositions, than by the
Sword; And seeing we have room enough in the New-sound-World to swarm forth
and discharge our selves with safety of our inhabitants, when we grow Populons,
think it as impolitique, so also un-Christian, to cast away our men and wast
our treasure, and to impoverish and in danger our Commonwealth at home, in
hopes only of enlarging our Dominions abroad. We permit no goods or
Merchandise to be imported in foreign bottomes, that are not really and indeed
of the growth, production and manufactory of the same Nation, unto whom the
said bottom or vessel does truly appertain, and whereof the master and the
greatest part of the ships company be the real natives and inhabitants of the
Country unto which the said vessel belongs, without collusion, upon the
confiscation of ship and gaods.

We allow no Monopoly of trades, or farming of any public revenues it being
coutrary to the freedom of the people, as being always oppressive and
vexatious to them, and alienating there affections from their Governors.

That the fishing trade here at home on our own seas, (so greatly neglected)
be again revived, advanced, and encouraged it tending much to the increasing
navigation, and enriching of the Nation; witness the vast benefit the
Hollander, (our industrious neighbors) yearly make of it, which might be our
own if we pleased.

The narrow Seas we challenge to be Masters and sovereigns of, by ancient and
just prescription and though we have peace with our neighbors as aforesaid,
yet we constantly maintain a competent number of stately frigots for a Summer
and Winter guard, well provided and managed with stout and faithful Seamen and
Commanders as to keep up our said prescription and secure our trade against
Pirates, so also to be always ready to occur any invasion that we may not be
surprised without warning, and unnprovided in case our Alleys should prove
false and play fast and loose with us, when it will best suite with there own
interest and occasion, which they are very apt to do.

That the Nations of Ireland and Scotland be included and concerned in all the
privileges, rights and immuniteys of the great Charter, we being all reduced
into one form of a Commonwealths government.

That when, and as soon as it shall please God, that the present supreme
authority of this Nation, shall have settled and secured it in some good and
convenient measure from foreign fears, intestine insurrections, by peaceable
treaties with our neighbors abroad and settling the Malitia in the hands of
faithful persons at home in every County, and have disposed the reception of
the public revenues, and other offices of trust into sure and trusty hands,
noe way tainted with the Leaven of Villinage that then some such, or much more
just, reasonable, equitable and necessary rules or heads of a real
Commonwealth Government may be considered and drawn up as the magna charta or
great Charter, and presented to the people of every Parish, in every County, on
the Lords day in the Church after the after noone Sermon, and read to them and
ably and plainly for their subscriptions, allowance and free consent: whereunto
it cannot be doubted but the most part of the good people of the Nation: (The
thing so much concerning their own freedom, and good, when they are thus once
made really to understand it) will be Universally forward and free unto it, as
seeing themselves thereby put into full posof their hopes and expectations and
their subscriptions as aforesaid being sent unto the supreme authority, they
forthwith issue writs to summon a new Representative elected and chosen out of
the subscribers, who (such only being chusers in each County as aforesaid) may
by act of Parliament confirm the soresaid Charter of Government and union of
the three Nations in one Commonwealth.

So shall we begin to act again upon such a Basis and foundation in Religion,
Law, and reason, as shall be just and undeniable and wipe of the shame of all
our former unsteadfastnesse in our engagements to Gad and man.

And the good and honest people in all the three Nations (through Gods
merciful providence) shall fully reap and enjoy the blessed fruit and benifit
of all their Prayers, Tears, Vows, Sufferings, and expense of their blood and
treasure. And all the misaffected in the Nations be experimentally convinced
that they have opposed that through their passion, preejudice, and ignorance,
which can alone make them and their posterity truly happy both as men and as
Christians.

The Magna Charta or great Character of the Commonwealth constitution, so
agreed upon and subscribed by the major part of the good people of the Nation
may be kept in every Parish Church, bound up within the end of the great Church
Bible, and read unto the People by the Minister, once every Quarter on the
Lords day in the Afternoon, after the Sermon, before the blessing, upon the
penalty of the loss of his living.

And thus all hearts being souldred in one, we shall sit down every one under
his own Vine and Figtree in tranquillity and peace, none within, or without us
being able to make us afraid but we, and much more our posterites singing
perpetual praises unto the Lord the God of ou settlement and deliverance.

FINIS.
