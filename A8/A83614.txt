Die Jovis 2. Junij, 1642.
WHereas it does appear to the Lords and Commons in Parliament, That the King,
seduced by wicked. Counsel, does intend to leavy War against his Parliament;
And whereas Information has been given, That the Jewels of the Crown (which by
the Law of the Land ought not to be alienated) are either pawned or sold in
Amsterdam, or some other parts beyond the Seas, and thereby great Sums of Money
provided to be returned to York, or to some of His Majesty's Servants or Agents
for His Majesty's use: And whereas it is more then probable, That this great
Provision of Moneys in such an extraordinary way, is to maintain this intended
War, and thereby to bring the whole Kingdom into utter ruin and combustion.
It is therefore declared by the Lords and Commons in Parliament, That whosoever
has been, or shall be an Actor in the selling or pawning of any of the Jewels
of the Crown, or has, or shall pay, lend, send, or bring any Money in Specie
into this Kingdom, for, or upon any of those Jewels; Or whosoever has, or
shall accept of any Bill from beyond the Seas, for the payment of any sum of
Money for, or upon any of those Jewels, and shall pass any sum according to
such Bill, after notice of this Order, without acquainting this House with the
receipt of such Bill before he accept the same; Or if he have already accepted
any such Bill, then with the acceptance thereof before the payment of the
Money, Every such person shall be held and accounted a promoter of this
intended War, an enemy to the State, and ought to give satisfaction for this
public damage out of His own Estate.
