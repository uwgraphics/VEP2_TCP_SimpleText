A DECLARATION Of the People of ENGLAND for a FREE-PARLIAMENT.
WHereas by a wonderful Revolution of the Divine Providence, those Members of
the long Parliament which were strangely brought in by the Army ( May the 7th.
1659.) and as strangely outed by them ( October the 13th. 1659.) are now
strangely returned to sit in the House, as before, we judge it our Concernment
to call to mind the ACT by them made and published, immediately before their
forcible Interruption, entitled, An Act against raising of Money upon the
People without their consent in Parliament: which Act of theirs proceeds in
these words; And be it further enacted, that no Person or Persons shall after
the 11. of October 1659. Assess, Levy, Collect, Gather or Receive, any Custom,
Imposts, Excise, Assesment, Contribution, Tax, Tallage, or any sum or sums of
Money, or other Impositions whatsoever, upon the People of this Commonwealth,
without THEIR CONSENT in Parliament, or as by Law might have been done before
the 3d. of November, 1640. And be it further enacted and declared, that every
person offending against this Act shall be, and is hereby adjudged to be guilty
of HIGH TREASON, and shall forfeit and suffer as in case of High Treason.
Hereupon we judged it meet and equitable to make this following DECLARATION.

We do therefore declare that we do freely, cordially and unanimously assent to
the Equity of this Act, as consonant to the Fundamental Laws of our Nation, the
benefit whereof we doubt not but we may justly claim, as our Birth-priviledg in
all such cases and concernments.

And accordingly we do hereby declare that we are ready and willing, as soon as
an opportunity is given us, to make choice of such Persons as may declare our
Consent in Parliament, for the raising of such sums of Money, as by them shall
be thought necessary to defray the public charges, and manage the public
concerns of the Nation, seeing most of those persons that were formerly chosen
by us for this purpose, are either taken away by Death or by Seclusion debarred
from sitting in the House.

And we do hereby further declare that we neither do nor shall ever give our
consent, that any Assesment should be made, or Imposition laid upon us by any
person or persons whatsoever, until our consent be so declared by persons thus
chosen and entrusted by us for this end and purpose.

And therefore if any Person or persons whatsoever shall contrary to the
forementioned Act, and the Fundamental Laws of this Nation, lay any Assesment
or Imposition upon us before our consent is thus declared, under what pretense
or color soever of Authority or Necessity it shall be done, we do hereby
declare to the World, that we are under manifest Constraint and Force, and our
Goods and Estates are violently extorted from us, contrary to Law and Justice,
which injuries we shall no longer bear then an opportunity shall be offered us
to right our selves, and repossess those privileges that pertain to us by the
Laws of our Nation.

And hereunto so universal and unanimous is our Concurrence, that it would be
endless for us to subscribe our Names (which neither this nor many such papers
could contain) but yet if any doubt or mistrust of the truth of the matter
hereby declared should be conceived or pretended by any, and the Members of
Parliament now sitting (whom we conceive it does in a special manner concern)
shall desire a visible Testimony hereunto, for their further satisfaction and
more full assurance of the truth and reality hereof, we shall be ready upon the
least intimation thereof by them given us, in the several Cities and Counties
of the Land, to own and subscribe to what is hereby declared, and act
accordingly.

For some proof of the Premises, we Citizens of LONDON, capable of the choice
of Knights and Burgesses to serve in Parliament, have to this present
Declaration subscribed our hands; and so much the rather that we might hereby
take occasion to signify to the whole Nation our cordial concurrence with our
COMMON COUNCIL, in what was done by that Honorable Court in the behalf of us
all, in their DECLARATION (of 20. of December.) for a FREE-PARLIAMENT. Michaell
