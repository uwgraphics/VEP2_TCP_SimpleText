ANOTHER DECLARATION FROM BOTH HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT: Sent to His Majesty, March
22, 1641.

LONDON, Printed by R. Oulton and G. Dexter. 1641.

ANOTHER DECLARATION FROM BOTH HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT to His Majesty.
May it please your Majesty,
YOUR Majesty's most Loyal Subjects, the Lords and Commons, cannot conceive
that the Declaration which your Majesty received from Us at Newmarket, was such
as did deserve that Censure your Majesty was pleased to lay upon Us, in that
Speech which your Majesty made to Our Committees there, and sent in writing to
both Houses: Our Adresses therein being accompanied with Plainness, Humility
and Faithfullnes, We thought more proper for the removing the Distraction of
the Kingdom, then if We had then proceeded according to your Majesty's Message
of the 20. of January, by which your Majesty was pleased to desire that we
would declare what we intended to do for your Majesty, and what We expected to
be done for Our Selves; in both which, We have bin very much hindered by your
Majesty's Denial to secure Us and the whole Kingdom, by disposing the
Militia, as We had diverse times most humbly Petitioned; and We have not bin
altogether negligent of either, having lately made good proceedings, in
preparing a Book of Rates to be passed in a Bill of Tunnage and Poundage, and
likewise the most Material Heads of those Humble desires which We intended to
Make to your Majesty, for the good and contentment of your Majesty, and your
People: But now, if these could not be perfected till the Kingdom be put
into Safety, by settling the Militia; and until your Majesty shall be pleased to
Concur with your Parliament in those necessary things, We hold it impossible
for you to give the world, or your People such satisfaction, concerning the
Fears and Jealousies which We have expressed, as We hope your Majesty has
already received, touching that Exception which you were pleased to take to Mr.
PYMS Speech.

As for your own Fears and Doubts, the ground whereof being from Seditious
Pamphlets and Sermons, We shall as carefully endeavor to remove it, as soon
as: We understand what Pamphlets are by your Majesty intended, as we have bin
to prevent all dangerous Tumults. And if any Extraordinary Concourse of People
out of the City to Westminster, had the face and show of Tumult and Danger, in
your Majesty's, apprehensions, it will appear to be caused by your Majesty's
Denial of such a Guard to your Parliament, as they might have cause to Confide
in; And by taking in White Hall such a Guard for your self, as gave just Cause
of Jealousy to the Parliament, and of Terror and offense to your People. We
seek nothing but your Majesty's peace, and the prosperity of your Kindomes;
and We are heartily sorry We have such plentiful Matter of an Answer to
that Question, Whether you have viclated Our Laws? We beseech your Majesty to
remember, that the Government of this Kingdom, as it was in great part managed
by your Ministers, before the beginning of the Parliament, consisted of many
continued and multiplied Acts of violation of Laws, the wounds whereof were
scarcely healed, when the Extremity of all their violations was far exceeded
by this late, strange, and unheard of breach of our Laws in the accusation of
the Lord Kimbolton, and the five Members of the Commons House, and proceedings
thereupon, for which we have yet received no full satisfaction.

To your Majesty's next Question, Whether you had denied any Bill for the case
and security of your Subjects? We wish we could stop in the midst of our
Answer, That with much, thankfulness we acknowledge that your Majesty has
passed many good Bills, f^ll of contentment and advantage to your People, but
truth and necessity inforceth us to add this, That even in or about the time
of passing those Bills some: design or other has bin a foot, which if it had
taken effect would not only have deprived us of the fruit of those Bills, but
have reduced us to a worse condition of confusion then that, wherein the
Parliament found us.

And if your Majesty had asked us the third Question Intimated in that Speech,
What We had done for your Self? Our Answer would have bin much more easy;
That We have paid two Armies, wherewith the Kingdom was burdened last year.
That we have undertaken a War with Ireland: all which great mischief, and
the Charges thereupon have bin occasioned by the evil Counsels, so powerful
with your Majesty, which have and will cost this Kingdom more then two
Millions, all which in Justice ought to have bin borne by your Majesty.

As for the free and general pardon, your Majesty has bin pleased to offer,
it can be no security to our Fears and Jealousies, for which your Majesty
seems to propound it, because they arise not from any Guilt of our own
Actions, but from the evil designs and attempts of others.

To this our humble Answer to that Speech we desire to add an information
which we lately received from the Deputy Governor of the Merchant Adventurers,
at Rotterdam in Holland, That an unknown Person appertaining to the Lord
Digby, did lately s^llicite on James Henly a Mariner, to go to Ellinore and
there to take charge of a Ship in the Fleece of the King of Denmark, there
prepared, which he should conduct to Hull, in which Ships likewise he said a
great Army was to be transported: And although we are not apt to give credit to
Informations of that nature, yet we cannot altogether think it fit to be
neglected, but that it adds somewhat to our fears and Jealousies, considering
with what Circumstances, it is accompanied of the Lord Digbyes preceding
expressions, in a Letter to her Majesty, and Sir Lewis Dives; and your
Majesty's succeeding course of withdwrawing your self Northward from your
Parliament, in a manner very suitable and correspondent with that evil
Counsel, which we doubt will make much deeper impression in the generality of
your people: and therefore we most humbly desire, for the procuring and settling
our and their confidence, and the other Reasons concerning the recovery of
Ireland, and securing this Kingdom, which have been formerly presented to
your Majesty, you will be graciously pleased, with all convenient speed to
return to these parts, and to close with the advice and desire of your
Parliament: Where you shall find their dutiful affections and endeavors,
ready to attend your Majesty, with such entertainment as shall not only give
your Majesty just cause of security, in their faithfulness, but other
manifest evidences of their earnest desires, to advance your Majesty's service,
Honor and contentment, and to establish it upon the sure foundation of the
Peace and Prosperity of all your Kingdoms.

FINIS.
