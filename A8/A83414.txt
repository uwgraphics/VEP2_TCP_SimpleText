A REMONSTRANCE OR THE DECLARATION Of the LORDS and Commons, now Assembled in
PARLIAMENT, 26. of May. 1642.

In answer to a Declaration under His Majesty's Name concerning the business
of Hull, sent in a MESSAGE to both Houses the 21. of May, 1642.

According to an Order made in the House of Commons, on Saturday last, I have
examined this Copy with the Original, and have mended it.

THE THIRD REMONSTRANCE.
ALthough the great affairs of this Kingdom, and the miserable and bleeding
condition of the Kingdom of Ireland, afford us little leisure to spend our time
in Declarations, and in Answers and Replies, yet the Malignant party about His
Majesty, taking all occasions to multiply Calumnies upon the Houses of
Parliament, and to publish sharp Invectives under His Majesty's Name against
them and their proceedings, a new Engine which they have invented to heighten
the destructions of this Kingdom, and to beget and increase distrust and
disaffection between the King and His Parliament and the People, We cannot be
so much wanting to our own Innocence, or to the duty of our Trust, as not to
clear our selves from those false aspersions, and (which is our chiefest care)
to disabuse the Peoples minds, and open their eyes, that under the false shows
and pretexts of the Law of the Land, and of their own Rights and Liberties,
they may not be carried into the Road way, that leads to the utter ruin and
subversion thereof. A late occasion that these wicked spirits of division have
taken to defame, and indeed to arraigne the proceedings of both Houses of
Parliament, has been from our Votes of the 28. of April, and our Declaration
concerning the business of Hull, which because we put forth, before we could
send our Answer concerning that matter unto His Majesty, those mischievous
Instruments of dissension, between the King, the Parliament, and the People,
whose chief labor and study is to misrepresent our Actions to His Majesty and
to the Kingdom, would needs interpret this as an appeal to the people, and a
declining of all Intercourse between his Majesty and us, as if we thought it
to no purpose to endeavor any more to give him satisfaction, and without
expecting any longer our answer, under the name of a Message from His Majesty
to both Houses, they themselves have indeed made an Appeal to the people as the
message it self does in a manner grant it to be, offering to ioyn issue with us
in that way, and in the nature thereof, does clearly show it self to be no
other, Therefore we shall likewise address our Answer to the Kingdom, not by
way of Appeal as we are charged) but to prevent them from being their own
executioners, and from being persuaded under false colors of defending the
Law, and their own Liberties, to destroy both with their own hands, by taking
their lives, Liberties and Estates out of their hands whom they have chosen and
entrusted therewith, and resigning them up unto some evil Counselors about
His Majesty, who can lay no other foundation of their own greatness, but upon
the Ruin of this, and in it of all Parliaments, and in them of the true
Religion, and the freedom of this Nation. And these are the men that would
persuade the people, that both Houses of Parliament containing all the Peers,
and representing all the Commons of England, would destroy the Laws of the Land
and Liberty of the people; wherein besides the trust of the whole, they
themselves in their own particulars, have so great an interest of honor and
estate, That we hope it will gain little credit, with any that have the least
use of reason, that such as must have so great a share in the misery, should
take so much pains in the procuring thereof, and spend so much time, and run so
many hazards to make themselves slaves, and to destroy the property of their
estates, But that we may give particular satisfaction to the several
imputations cast upon us, we shall take them in Order as they are laid upon us
in that Message First, we are charged for the avowing of that act of Sir John
Hotham, which is termed unparalelled and an high and unheard of affront unto
his Majesty, and as if we needed not to have done it, he being able, as is
alleged, to produce no such command of the Houses of Parliament. Although Sir
John Hotham had not an Order that did express every circumstance of that case,
yet he might have produced an Order of both Houses which did comprehend this
Case, not only in the clear intention, but in the very words thereof, which
knowing in our Consciences to be so, and to be most necessary for the safety
of the Kingdom, we could not but in Honor and Justice avow that Act of his,
which we are confident will appear to all the world to be so far from being an
affront to the King, that it will be found to have been an act of great Loyalty
to His Majesty, and to his Kingdom.

The next charge upon us is, that instead of giving his Majesty satisfaction,
we published a Declaration concerning that business as an appeal to the
people, and as if our intercourse with his Majesty, and for his satisfaction,
were now to no more purpose, which course is alleged to be very unagreeable to
the modesty and duty of former times, and not warrantable by any Presidents,
but what our selves have made. If the Penner of this Message had expected a
while, or had not expected that two Houses of Parliament, (especially burdened
as they are at this time with so many pressing and urgent affairs) should have
moved as fast as himself, he would not have said that Declaration was instead
of an Answer to His Majesty, which we did dispatch with all the speed and
diligence we could, and have sent it to His Majesty by a Committee of both
Houses, whereby it appears that we did it not upon that ground, that we thought
it was no more, to any purpose to endeavor to give his Majesty satisfaction.
And as for the duty and modesty of former times from which we are said to have
varied, and to want the warrant of any Presidents therein, but what our selves
have made: but if we have made any Presidents this Parliament, we have made
them for posterity, upon the same or better grounds of reason and Law then
those were upon which our Predecessors first made any for us, and as some
Presidents ought not to be rules for us to follow; so none can be limits to
bound our proceedings, which may and must vary according to the different
condition of times, and for this particular of setting forth Declarations for
the satisfaction of the people, who have chosen and entrusted us with all that
is dearest to them, If there be no example for it, it is because there were
never any such Monsters before that, ever attempted to disaffect the people
from a Parliament, or could ever harbor a thought that it might be effected;
were there ever such practices to poison the people with an ill apprehension of
the Parliament, were there ever such imputations and scandals laid upon the
proceedings of both Houses; were there ever so many, and so great breaches of
privilege of Parliament, were there ever so many, and so desperate designs of
force and violence against the Parliament, and the Members thereof, If we have
done more than ever our Ancestors have done, we have suffered more than ever
they have suffered, and yet in point of modesty and duty we shall not yield to
the best of former times, and we shall put this in issue, whether the highest
and most unwarrantable presidents of any of His Majesty's Predecessors, do not
fall short and much below what has been done unto us this Parliament; And on
the otherside, whether if we should make the highest Presidents of other
Parliaments our patterns, there would be cause to complain of want of modesty
and duty in us, when we have not so much as suffered such things to enter into
our thoughts, which all the world knows they have put in act.

Another Charge which is laid very high upon us (and which were indeed a very
great Crime if we were found guilty thereof) is that by avowing this act of Sir
John Hotham, we do in Consequence confound and destroy the title and Interest
of all his Majesty's good subjects to their lands and goods, and that upon this
ground, That his Majesty has the same title to his town of Hull, which any of
his subjects have to their houses or lands, and the same to his Magazin and
Munition there, that any man has to his money, plate, or Jewels; and therefore
that they ought not to have been disposed of without or against his consent, no
more then the house, land, money, plate, or Jewels, of any subject ought to be
without or against his will.

Here that is laid down for a Principle which would indeed pull up the very
foundation of the liberty, property and interest of every subject in
particular, and of all the subjects in general, if we should admit it for a
truth that his Majesty has the same right and Title to his Towns and to his
Magazin (bought with the public moneys as we conceive that at Hull to have
been) that every particular man has to his house, lands, and goods, for his
Majesty's towns are no more his own, then his Kingdom is his own, and his
Kingdom is no more his own, then his people are his own, and if the King had a
propriety in all his Towns, what would become of the subjects propriety in
their houses therein, and if he had a propriety in his Kingdom, what would
become of the subjects propriety in their lands throughout the Kingdom; or of
their liberties, if his Majesty had the same right in their persons, that
every subject has in their lands, or goods: and what should become of the
subjects interest in the Towns and Forts of the Kingdom, and in the Kingdom it
self, if his Majesty might sell or give them away, or dispose of them at his
pleasure, as a particular man may do with his Lands and with his Goods. This
erroneous maxim, being infused into Princes that their Kingdoms are their own,
and that they may do with them what they will as if their Kingdoms were for
them, and not they for their Kingdoms) is the Root of all the subjects misery,
and of the Invading of their just Rights and Liberties; whereas indeed they are
only entrusted with their Kingdoms, and with their Towns, and with their
people, and with the public, Treasure of the Commonwealth, and whatsoever is
bought therewith and by the known Law of this Kingdom: the very Jewels of the
Crown are not the Kings proper goods, but are only entrusted to him for the
use and ornament thereof. As the Towns, Forts, Treasure, Magazin, Offices and
people of the Kingdom, and the whole Kingdom it self is entrusted unto him for
the good and safety and best advantage thereof. And as this trust is for the
use of the Kingdom; so ought it to be managed by the advice of the Houses of
Parliament, whom the Kingdom has trusted for that purpose; it being their duty
to see it be discharged according to the condition and true intent thereof, and
as much as in them lies by all possible means to prevent the contrary: Which if
it has been their chief care and only aim in the disposing of the town and
Magazin of Hull in such manner as they have done, they hope it will appear
clearly to all the world, that they have discharged their own trust, and not
invaded that of His Majesty's, much less his property which in this case they
could not do.

But admitting His Majesty had indeed had a property in the Town and
Magazine of Hull, who doubts but that a Parliament may dispose of any thing
wherein His Majesty or any Subjects has a right, in such a way, as that the
Kingdom may not be exposed to hazard or danger thereby, which is our case in
the disposing of the Town and Magazine of Hull. And whereas His Majesty does
allow this and a greater power to a Parliament, but in that sense only as he
himself is a part thereof, we appeal to every man's Conscience that has
observed our proceedings, whether we disjoined His Majesty from His
Parliament, who have in all humble ways sought his Concurrence with us, as in
this particular about Hull, and for the removeall of the Magazine there, so
also in all other things, or whether these evil Counsels about him have not
separated him from his Parliament, not only in distance of place, but also in
the discharge of this joint trust with them for the peace and safety of the
Kingdom in this and some other particulars.

We have given no occasion to His Majesty to declare His resolution with so
much earnestness, that he will not suffer either or both Houses by their Votes
without or against his consent to enjoyne any thing that is forbidden by the
Law, or to forbid any thing that is enjoined by the Law. For our Votes have
done no such thing, and as we shall be very tender of the Law (which we
acknowledge to be the safeguard and custody of all public and private
Interesses) so we shall never allow a few private Persons about His Majesty,
nor His Majesty Himself in His own Person and out of his Courts to be Judge
of the Law, and that contrary to the judgment of he highest Court of
Judicature: In like manner that His Majesty has not refused to consent to any
thing that might be for the peace and happiness of the Kingdom, we cannot admit
it in any other sense, but as His Majesty takes the measure of what will be
for the peace and happiness of the Kingdom from some few ill affected persons
about him, contrary to the advice and judgment of His great Council of
Parliament. And because the Advice of both Houses of Parliament has through
the suggestions of evil Counselors been so much undervalued of late, and so
absolutely rejected and refused, we hold it fit to declare unto the Kingdom
(whose honor and interest is so much concerned in it) what is the privilege
of the great Council of Parliament herein, and what is the Obligation that
lies upon the Kings of this Realm to pass such Bills as are offered unto
them by both Houses of Parliament, in the name, and for the good of the whole
Kingdom, whereunto they stand engaged both in conscience and in justice to
give their royal assent; In conscience, in respect of the Oath that is or
ought to be taken by the KINGS of this Realm at their CORONATION, as well to
confirm by their Royal assent such good Laws as their people shall choose,
and to remedy by Law such inconveniences as the Kingdom may suffer, as to keep
and protect the Laws already in being, as may appear both by the form of the
Oath upon Record, and in books of good Authority, and by the Statute of the
25. Edw. 3. entitled the Statute of Provisors of Benefices, the form of which
Oath, and the cause of that Statute concerning are as follows: Rot. Parl. 1.
H. 4. N. 17. 2.

A Clause in the Preamble of a Statute made 25. Edw. 3. Entitled the Statute
of Provisors of Benefices.

Whereupon the said Commons have prayed our said Lord the King, that since the
right of the Crown of England, and the Law of the said Realm is such, that
upon the mischiefs and damages which happen to his Realm, he ought, and is
bound by hid Oath with the accord of his people in his Parliament, thereof to
make remedy and Law, and in removing the mischiefs and damages which thereof
ensue, that it may please him thereupon to ordain remedy.

Our Lord the King seeing the mischiefs and damages beforementioned, and
having regard to the said Statute, made in the time of his said Grandfather,
and to the causes contained in the same, which Statute holds always his
force, and was never defeated, repealed, nor adnulled in any point, and by so
much he is bounden by his Oath to cause the same to be kept as the Law of his
Realm, though that by sufferance and negligence it has been sithence
attempted to the contrary, also having regard to the grievous complaints made
to him by his people in diverse His Parliaments holden heretofore, willing to
ordain remedy for the great damages and mischiefs which have happened, and
daily do happen to the Church of England by the said cause.

Here the Lords and Commons claim it directly as the right of the Crown of
England, and of the Law of the Land, and that the King is bound by his Oath,
with the accord of his people in Parliament to make remedy and Law upon the
mischiefs and damages which happen to this Realm, and the King does not deny
it, although he take occasion from a Statute formerly made by his Grandfather,
which was laid as part of the grounds of this Petition, to fix his Answer upon
another branch of his Oath, and prefermits that which is claimed by the Lords
and Commons, which he would not have done if it might have been excepted
against.

In justice they are obliged thereunto in respect of the trust reposed in them,
which is as well to preserve the Kingdom by the making of new Laws where there
shall be need, as by the observing of Laws already made. A Kingdom being many
times as much exposed to ruin for the want of a new Law, as by the violation
of those that are in being, and this is so clear a right, that no doubt His
Majesty will acknowledge it to be as due unto his people as his protection; but
how far forth he is obliged to follow the judgment of his Parliament
therein, that is the question. And certainly, besides the words in the Kings
Oath, referring unto such Laws as the people shall choose, as in such things
which concern the Public Weal and good of the Kingdom, they are the most
proper Judges who are sent from the whole Kingdom for that very purpose, so
we do not find that since Laws have passed by way of Bills (which are read
thrice in both Houses, and committed, and every part and circumstance of them
fully weighed and debated upon the commitment, and afterward passed in both
Houses) that ever the Kings of this Realm did deny them otherwise then is
expressed in that usual Answer, Le Roy savisera, which signifies rather a
suspension then a refusal of the Royal Assent, and in those other Laws which
are framed by way of Petitions of Right, the Houses of Parliament have taken
themselves to be so far Judges of the Rights claimed by them that when the
Kings answer has not in every point been fully according to their desire, they
have still insisted upon their claim, and never rested satisfied till such
time as they had an answer according to their own demand, as was done in the
late Petition of Right, and in former times upon the like occasion, and if the
Parliament be Judge between the King and his people in the Question of Right
(as by the manner of the claim in Petitions of Right, and by Judgments in
Parliament, in Cases of illegal Impositions and Taxes, and the like it
appears to be) why should they not be so also in the question of the common
good, and necessity of the Kingdom, wherein the Kingdom has as clear a
right also to have the benefit and remedy of Law, as in any thing whatsoever,
and yet we do not deny but in private Bills, and also in public Acts of
Grace, as Pardons and the like grants of favor, His Majesty may have a
greater latitude of granting or denying as he shall think fit.

All this considered, we cannot but wonder that the Conniver of this Message,
should conceive the people of this Land to be so void of common sense, as to
enter into so deep a mistrust of those that they have and his Majesty ought to
repose so great a trust in as to despair of any security in their private
Estates, by Discents, Purchases, Assurances, or Conveyances, unless His
Majesty should by his Vote prevent the prejudice they might receive therein, by
the Votes of both Houses of Parliament, As if they who are especially chosen
and entrusted for that purpose, and who themselves must needs have so great a
share in all grievances of the Subject, had wholly cast off all care of the
Subjects good, and His Majesty had solely taken it up; And as if it could be
imagined that they should by their Votes overthrow the rights of Discents,
Purchases, or of any Conveyance or Assurance, in whose judgment the whole
Kingdom has placed all their particular Interesses, if any of them should be
called in question in any of those Cases, and that (as knowing not where to
place them with greater security) without any appeal from them to any other
person or Court whatsoever.

But indeed we are very much to seek how the case of Hull should concern
Discents, and Purchases, or Conveyances, and Assurances, unless it be in
procuring more security to men in their private Interesses by the preservation
of the whole from confusion and destruction, and much less do we understand
how the Sovereign Power was resisted and despised therein; Certainly no
command from His Majesty, and his high Court of Parliament (where the
Sovereign Power resides) was disobeyed by Sir John Hotham, nor yet was his
Majesty's Authority derived out of any other Court, nor by any legal
Commission, or by any other way, wherein the Law has appointed His Majesty's
commands to be derived to his Subjects, and of what validity his verbal
Commands are, without any such stamp of his Authority upon them, and against
the order of both Houses of Parliament, whether the not submitting thereunto be
a resisting and despising of the Sovereign Authority, we leave it to all men
to judge, that do at all understand the government of this Kingdom.

We acknowledge that His Majesty has made many expressions of his zeal and
intentions against the desperate designs of Papists, but yet it is also as
true, that the Counsels which have prevailed of late with him, have been
little suitable to those expressions and intentions: For what does more advance
the open and bloody design of the Papists in Ireland, (whereon the secret
plots of the Papists here, do in likelihood depend) then His Majesty's
absenting himself, in that manner that he does from his Parliament, and
setting forth such sharp Invectives against them, notwithstanding all the
humble Petitions, and other means which his Parliament has addressed unto him
for his return, and for his satisfaction concerning their proceedings. And
what was more likely to give a rise to the designs of Papists, (whereof there
are so many in the North near to the Town of Hull) and of other malignant and
ill-affected persons, which are ready to join with them, or to the attempts of
forrainers from abroad, than the continuing of that great Magazin at Hull at
this time, and contrary to the desire and advice of both Houses of Parliament;
So that we have too much cause to believe that the Papists have still some way
and means, whereby they have influence upon his Majesty's Counsels for their
own advantage.

For the Malignant party his Majesty needs not a definition of the Law, nor
yet a more full Character of them from both Houses of Parliament for to find
them out; if he will please only to apply the Character that himself has made
of them to those unto whom it does properly and truly belong, who are so much
disaffected to the peace of the Kingdom, as they that endeavor to disaffect
his Majesty from the Houses of Parliament, and persuade him to be at such a
distance from them both in place and affection: Who are more disaffected to
the government of the Kingdom, than such as lead his Majesty away from
harkning to his Parliament, which by the constitution of this Kingdom is his
greatest and best Council, and persuade him to follow the malicious councels
of some private men, in opposing and contradicting the wholesome advices, and
just proceedings of that his most faithful Council and highest Court? Who are
they that not only neglect and despise, but labor to undermine the Law, under
color of maintaining of it. But they that endeavor to destroy the fountain
and Conservatory of the law, which is the Parliament; and who are they that set
up other Rules for themselves to walk by, then such as are according to Law,
but they that will make other Judges of the Law; then the Law has appointed,
and so dispense with their obedience, to that which the Law calls Authority,
and to their determinations and resolutions to whom the Judgment does
appertain by Law: For when private persons shall make the Law; o be their
Rule, according to their own understandings, contrary to the judgment of those
that are competent Judges thereof; they set up unto themselves other Rules than
the Law does acknowledge: Who these persons are, none knows better than his
Majesty himself: And if he will please to take all possible caution of them,
as destructive to the Common wealth, and himself, and would remove them from
about him, it would be the most effectual means to compose all the
destractions, and to cure the distempers of this Kingdom.

For the Lord Digby his le ter, we did not make mention of it as a ground to
hinder his Majesty from visiting his own fort, but we appeal to the judgment
of any indifferent man that shall read that Letter, and compare with the
posture that his Majesty then did, and still does stand in, toward the
Parliament, and with the circumstances of that late action of his Majesty, in
going to Hull, whether the Advisor of that Journey, intended only a visit of
that fort and Magazin? as to the ways and overtures accommodation, and the
meffage of the 20 of January last, so often pressed, but still in vain, as is
alleged Our Answer is, that although so often as the 20. of January has
been pressed, so often have our privileges been clearly infringed; that a way
and method of proceeding should be prescribed unto us, as well for the settling
of his Majesty's Revene, as for the presedting of our desires (a thing which in
former Parliaments has always been excepted against as a breach of
privilege) pet in respect of the matter contained in that message, and out of
our earnest desire to beget a good understanding between his Majesty, and us,
we swallowed down all matters of Circumstance, and had ere this time presented
the chief of our desires to his Majesty, had we not been inrerrupted with
continual Denyalls even of those things that were necessary for our present
security and subsistence, and had not those denyalls been followed with
perpetual Invectives against us and our proceedings, and had not those
invectives been beaped upon us so thick one after another, (who were already in
a manner wholly taken up with the pressing affairs of this Kingdom, and of
the Kingdom of Ireland) that as we had little encouragment from thence to hope
for any good Answes to our desires, so we had not so much time left us to
perfect them in such a manner as to offer them unto his Majesty.

We confess it is a Resolution most worthy of a Prince, and of his Majstie, to
shut his ears against any that would incline him to a civil War, and to
abhor the very apprehension nf it, but we cannot believe that mind to have bin
in them that came with his Majesty to the House of Commons, or in them teat
accompanied his Majstie to Hampton Court, and appeared in a warlike manner at
Kingston upon Thames, or in diverse of them that followed his Majesty now
latley to Hull, or in them that after drew their Swords at York, demanding who
would be for the King, nor in them that advised his Majesty to declare Sir John
Hotham a Traitor before the Message was sent concerning that business to the
Parliament, or to make Propositions to the Gentlemen of the County of York, to
assist His Majesty to proceed against him in a way of force before he had, or
possible could receive an Answer from the Parliament, to whom he had sent to
demand Justice of them against Sir John Hotham for that Fact; and if those
Malignant spirits shall ever force us to defend our Religion, the Kingdom, the
Privileges of Parliamants, and the Rights and Liberties of the Subjects, with
our swords, the blood and destruction that shall ensue thereupon must be wholly
cast upon their Account, God and our own consciences tell us that we are
clear, and we doubt not but God and the whole world will clear us therein.

For Captain Leg we did not say that he was accused, or that there was any
charge against him for the bringing up of the Army, but that he was employed in
that business. And for that question concerning the Earl of New Castle
mentioned by his Majesty, which is said to have bin asked long since, and that
is not easy to be answered; We conceive that it is a question of more
difficulty and harder to be answered: Why, when his Majesty held it necessary,
upon the same grounds that first moved from the Houses of Pa liament; That a
Governor should be placed in that Town, Sir John Hotham a Gentleman of known
Fortune and Integrity, and a person of whom both Houses of Parliament had
expressed their confidence, should be refused by his Majesty, and the Earl of
New Castle (who by the way was so far named in the business of the bringing up
of the Army, that although there was not ground enough for a judicial
proceeding, yet there was ground of suspicion, at least his reputation was not
left so unblemished thereby, as that he should be thought the fittest man in
England for that employment of Hull) should be sent down in a private way from
his Majesty to take upon him the government, and why he should disguise
himself under another name when he came thither, as he did. But whosoever shall
consider, together with these circumstances; that of the time when Sir John
Hotham was first appointed by both Houses of Parliament to take upon him that
employment, which was presently after his Majesty's coming to the House of
Commons, and upon the retiring of himself to Hampton Court, and the L. Digbies
assembling of Cavaliers at Kingstone upon Thamis, will find reason enough why
that Town of Hull should be committed rather to Sir John Hotham by the
authority of both Houses of Parliament, then to the Earl of New Castle, sent
from his Majesty in that manner that he was. And for the power that Sir John
Hotham has from the Houses of Parliament, the better it is known and
understood; we are confident the more it will be approved of and justified: And
as we do not conceive that his Majesty's refusal to have that Magazin removed
could give any advantage against him to have it taken from him, and as no such
thing is done, so we cannot conceive for what other reason any should council
his Majesty not to suffer it to be removed, upon the desire of both Houses of
Parliament, except it be that they had an intention to make use of it against
them.

We did not except against those that presented a petition to His Majesty at
York for the continuance of the Magazine at Hull, in respect of their
condition, or in respect of their number, because they were mean persons, or
because they were few; but because they being but few, and there being so many
more in the County of as good quality as themselves (who have by their petition
to His Majesty disavowed that act of theirs) that they should take upon them
the style of all the Gentry and Inhabitants of that County, and under that
title should presume to interpose their advice contrary to the Votes of both
Houses of Parliament; and if it can be made to appear, that any of these
petitions that are said to have been presented to the Houses of Parliament, and
to have been of a strange nature, were of such a nature as that, we are
confident that they were never received with our consent and approbation.

Whether there was an intention to deprive Sir John Hotham of his life, if His
Majesty had been admitted into Hull, and whether the information were such, as
that he had ground to believe it, we will not bring it into question; for that
was not, nor ought to have been the ground for doing what he did, neither was
the number of His Majesty's Attendants, for being more or fewer, much
considerable in this case: For although it be true, that if His Majesty had
entered with twenty horse only, he might happily have found means for to have
forced the entrance of his Train, who being once in the Town, would not have
been long without Arms; yet that was not the ground that Sir John Hotham was to
proceed upon, but upon the admittance of the King into the Town at all, so as
to deliver up the Town and Magazine unto him, and to whomsoever he should give
the command thereof, without the knowledge and consent of both Houses of
Parliament, by whom he was entrusted to the contrary; and His Majesty having
declared that to be his intention concerning the Town, in a Message that he
sent to the Parliament not long before he went to Hull, saying, That he did not
doubt but that Town should be delivered up to him whenever he pleased, as
supposing it to be kept against him; and in like manner concerning his
Magazine, in his Message of the four and twentieth of April, wherein it is
expressed, That His Majesty went thither with a purpose to take into his hands
the Magazine, and to dispose of it in such manner as he should think fi^; upon
these terms Sir John Hotham could not have admitted his Majesty, and have made
good his trust to the Parliament, though his Majesty would have entered alone,
without any Attendance at all of his own, or of the Prince, or Duke, his sons,
which we do not wish to be less than they are in their number, but could hea
tily wish that they were generally better in their conditions.

In the close of this Message, His Majesty states the case of Hull, and
thereupon infers that the act of Sir John Hotham was levying of war against
the King, and consequently that it was no less then high Treason, by the
Letter of the Statutes of 25 Edw. 3. cap. 2. unless the sense of that Statute
be very far differing from the Letter thereof.

In the stating of this Case diverse particulars may be observed wherein it is
not rightly stated: As first, That His Majesty's going to Hull was only an
endeavor to visit a Town and Fort of his; whereas it was indeed to possess
himself of the Town and Magazine there, and to dispose of them as he himself
should think good, without and contrary to the Advices and Orders of both
Houses of Parliament, as does clearly appear by his Majesty's own Declaration
of his intentions therein, by his Messages to both Houses immediately before
and after that journey. Nor can we believe that any man that shall consider the
circumstances of that journey to Hull, can think that his Majesty would have
gone thither at that time, and in that posture, that he was pleased to put
himself in toward the Parliament, if he had intended only a visit of the Town
and Magazine. Secondly, it is said to be His Majesty's own Town, and his own
Magazine: which being understood in that sense as was before expressed, as if
his Majesty had a private interest of propriety therein, we cannot admit it to
be so. Thirdly, (which is the main point of all) Sir John Hotham is said to
have shut the gates against his Majesty, and to have made resistance with armed
men in defiance of his Majesty; whereas it was indeed in obedience to his
Majesty and his authority, and for his service, and the service of the kingdom,
for which use only all that interest is that the King has in the Town; and it
is no further his to dispose of, then he uses it for that end: And Sir John
Hotham being commanded to keep the Town and Magazine for his Majesty and the
Kingdom, and not to deliver them up, but by his Majesty's authority signified
by both Hourses of Parliament, all that is to be understood by those
expressions of his denying and opposing his Majesty's entrance, and telling him
in plain terms he should not come in, was only this, That he humbly desired
his Majesty to forbear his entrance, till he might acquaint the Parliament, and
that his authority might come signified to him by both Houses of Parliament,
according to the trust reposed in him. And certainly if the Letter of the
Statute of 25 Ed. 3. cap. 2. be thought to import this, that no war can be
levied against the King, but what is directed and intended against his person;
or that every levying of forces for the defense of the Kings authority, and of
his Kingdom, against the personal commands of the King opposed thereunto,
though accompanied with his presence, is levying war against the King, it is
very far from the sense of that Statute; and so much the Statute it self speaks
(besides the authority of Book-causes, Presidents of diverse Traitors condemned
upon that interpretation thereof:) For if the Clause of levying of war had been
meant only against the Kings person, what need had there been thereof, after
the other branch of Treason in the same Statute of compassing the Kings death,
which would necessarily have employed this; and because the former clause does
imply this, it seems not at all to be intended in this latter branch, but only
the levying of war against the King, that is, against his Laws and Authority,
but in the maintenance thereof, is no levying of war against the King, but for
him. Here is then our case; In a time of so many successive plots and designs
of force against the Parliament and Kingdom; in a time of probable invasion
from abroad, and that to begin at Hull, and to take the opportunity of seizing
upon so great a Magazine there; In a time of so great distance and alienations
of his Majesty's affections from his Parliament, and in them from his Kingdom,
which they represent, by the wicked suggestions of a few Malignant persons, by
whose mischievous counsels he is wholly led away from his Parliament, and their
faithful advices and counsels; In such a time the Lords and Commoos in
Parliament command Sir John Hotham to draw in some of the trained Bands of the
parts adjacent to the Town of Hull, for the securink of that Town and Magazine,
for the service of his Majesty and of the Kingdom; of the safety whereof there
is a higher trust reposed in them then any where else, and they are the proper
judges of the danger thereof.

This town and Magazine being sntrusted to Sir John Hotham, with evpresse order
not to deliver them up, but by the Lings authority signifies by both Houses of
Parliament; his Majesty, contrnry to the advice and direction of both Houses
of Parliament, without the authority of any Court, or of any legal way wherein
the Law appoints the King to speak and command, accompanied with the same
evil Council about him that he had before, by a verbal command repuires Sir
John Hotham to admit him into the Town, that he might dispose of it, and of
the Magazine there, according to his own, or rather according ao the dleasure
of those evil Counselors, which are still in so much credit about him: in
like manner as the Lord Dygby has continual recourse unto, and continuanne
from the Queens Majesty ie Holland, by which means he has oppertunity still to
communicate hss traiterous suggestions and concieptions to bosh their
Majesty's, such as those wos concerning his Majesty's retiring to a place of
strength, and declaring himself, and his own advancing of his Majesty's service
in such a way beyond the seas, and after that resorting to his Majesty in such
a place of strength; and diverse other things of tna nature, eontained in his
letter to the Queens Majesty, and to Sir Jews Dsves, a person that had not the
least part in this late business of Hull; and was presently dispatched away
into Holland, soon after his Majestys return from Hull, for what purpose we
leave the world to judge.

Upon the refusal of Sit John Hotham to admit his Majesty into Hull,
presently without any due process of Law, before His Majesty had sent up the
norration of his fact to the Parliament, he was proclaimed Traitor; and yet it
is said, that therein there was no violalation of the Subjects right; nor any
breach of the law, nor of the privilege of Parliament; though Sir John Hotham
be a Member of the House of Commons: And that his Majesty must have better
reason then bare Votes to believe the contrary. Although the Votes of the Lords
and Commons in Parliament, being the great Council of the Kingdom, are the
reason of the King and of the Kingdom, yet these Votes do not want clear and
apparent reason for them: For if the solemn proclaiming a man a Traitor
signify any thing, it puts a man, and all those that any way aid, assist, or
adhere unto him, into the same condition of Traitors, and draws upon him all
the consequences of Treason; and if his may be done by Law, without due
process of Law, the Subject has a very poor defense of the Law, and a very
small, if any portion of liberty thereby: and it is as little satisfaction to a
man that shall be exposed to such penalties, by that declaration of him to be a
Traitor, to say he shall have a Legal trial afterward, as it is to condemn
a man first, and try him afterward: And if there be a necessity for any such
proclaiming a man a Traitor without due process of Law yet there was none in
this case; For his Majesty might have as well expected the Justice of the
Parliament (which was the right way) as he had leisure to send to them to
demand Justice against Sir John Hotham. And the breach of Privilege of
Parliament in this case as the subversion of the Subjects common right: For
though the Privledges of Parliament do extend to those cases mentioned in the
Declaration of Treason, Felony, and breach of the peace, so as to exempt the
Members of Parliament from punishment, nor from all manner of Process and
trial, as it does in other cases, yet it does privilege them in the way and
method of their trial and punishment, and that the Parliament should have the
cause first brought before them, that they may judge of the fact, and of the
grounds of the accusation, and how far forth the manner of their trial may
concern or not concern the Privilege of Parliament: otherwise it would be in
the power not only of his Majesty, but of every private man, under pretensions
of Treasons, or those other crimes, to take any man from his service in
Parliament, and so as many one after another as he pleases, and consequently
to make a Parliament what he will, when he will, which would be a breach of so
essential a privilege of Parliament, as that the very being thereof depends
upon it: and therefore we no ways doubt, but every one that has taken the
Protestation, will according to his solemn Vow and Oath, defend it with his
life and fortunes. Neither does the sitting of a Parliament, suspend all or any
Law, in maintaining that Law which upholds the Privilege of Parliament, which
upholds the Parliament which upholds the Kingdom; And we are so far from
believing that his Majesty is the only person against whom Treason cannot be
committed, that is some sense we acknowledge he is the only person against
whom it can be committed; that is, as he is King, and that Treason which is
against the Kingdom is more against the King, then that which is against his
Person, because he is King: For that very Treason is not Treason, as it is
against him as a man, but as a man that is a King; and as he has relation to
the Kingdom, and stands as a person entrusted with the Kingdom and discharging
that trust. Now the case is truly stated, and all the world may judge where the
fault is, although we must avow that there can be no competent judge of this or
any the like case but a Parliament, and we are as confident, that His Majesty
shall never have cause to resort to any other Court or Course, for the
vindication of his just Privileges, and for the recovery and maintenance of
his known and undoubted Rights, if there should be any Invasion or violation
thereof, than to his high Court of Parliament. And in case wicked Counselors
about him shall drive him into any other Course from and against his
Parliament, whatever are his Majesty's expressions and intentions, we shall
appeal to all men's consciences, and desire that they would lay their hands upon
their hearts, and think with themselves, whether such persons as have of late
and still do resort to his Majesty, and have his care and favor most, either
have been or are more zealous Assertors of the true Protestant Profession
(although we believe they are more earnest in the Protestant Profession, then
in the Protestant Religion) or of the Law of the Land, the Liberty of the
Subject, and the Privileges of the Parliament, then the Members of both Houses
of Parliament, who are insinuated to be the Desertors, if not the Destroyers
of them: And whether if they could master this Parliament by force, they would
not hold up the same power to deprive us of all Parliaments, which are the
ground and p^llar of the Subjects Liberty, and that which makes England only
a free Monarchy.

For the Order of Assistance to the Committees of both Houses, as they have no
directions or instructions, but what have the Law for their Limits, and the
safety of the Land for their ends; so we doubt not but all persons mentioned in
that Order, and all his Majesty's good Subjects will yield obedience to His
Majesty's Authority signified therein by both Houses of Parliament: And that
all men may the better know their duty in matters of that nature, and upon how
su^e a ground they go that follow the judgment of Parliament for their guide,
we wish them judiciously to consider the true meaning and ground of that
Statute made in the eleventh year of Hen. 7. cap. 1. which is printed at large
in the end of His Majesty's Message of the fourth of May. This St^tute
provides, that none that shall attend upon the King, and do him true Service,
shall be attainted or forfeit any thing: What was the scope of this Statute? To
provide that men should nor suffer as Traitors for serving the King in His
Wars according to the duty of their Allegiance. If this had been all, it had
been a very needless and ^idicalous Statute: Was it then intended (as they
may seem to take the meaning of it to be, that caused it to be printed after
his Majesty's Message,) that they should be free from all crime and penalty
that should follow the King and serve him in War in any case whatsoever;
whether it were for or against the Kingdom, and the Laws thereof? That cannot
be, for that could not stand with the duty of their Allegiance; which in the
beginning of this Statute is expressed to be, to serve the King for the time
being in his Wars, for the defense of Him and the Land; and therefore if it
be against the Land, (as it cannot be understood to be otherwise if it be
against the Parliament, the representative body of the Kingdom,) It is a
declining from the duty of Allegiance, which this Statute supposes may be
done, though men should follow the Kings Person in the War: Otherwise there
had been no need of such a Proviso in the end of this Statute, that none should
take benefit thereby that should decline from the Allegiance. That therefore
which is the Principle Verb in this Statute, is the serving of the King for the
time being; which cannot be meant of a Perkin Warbeck, or any that should call
himself King; but such a one as what ever Title might prove, either in
himself or in his Ancestors, should be recieved and acknowledged for such by
the Kingdom; the consent whereof cannot be discerned but by Parliament; the
Act whereof is the Act of the whole Kingdom by the personal suffrage of the
Peers, and the delegate consent of all the Commons in England: And Aen. 7. a
wise King, considering that what was the Case of R. 3. his Predecessor, might
by chance of battle be his own, and that he might at once by such a Statute as
this, satisfy such as had served his Ptodecessor in his Wars; and also secure
those that should serve him, who might otherwise fear him in his Wars, lest
by chance of Battle that might happen to him also if a Duke of York had set
up a Title against him) which had happened to his Prodecessor: he procured this
Statute to be made, that no man should be accounted a Traitor for serving the
King in his Wars for the time being; that is, which was for the present
allowed and recieved by the Parliament in behalf of the Kingdom; and as it is
truly suggested in the Preamble of the Statute. It is not agreeable to reason or
conscience that it should be otherwise, seeing men should be put upon an
impossibility of knowing their duty, if the judgment of the Highest Court
should not be a Rule and guide to them: and if the judgment thereof should be
followed, where the question is who is King? Much more, what is the best
service of the King and Kingdom, and therefore those that shall guide
themselves by the judgment of Parliament, ought what ever happen to be secure
and free from all account and penalties, upon the grounds and equity of this
very Statute.

We shall conclude, that although those wicked Counselors about his Majesty,
have presumed under his Majesty's name to put that dishonor and affront upon
both Houses of Parliament, as to make them the countenancers of Treason; enough
to have dissolved all the bands, sinews of confidence between his Majesty and
his Parliament, (of whom the Maxim of the law is, That a dishonorable thing
ought not to be imagined of them) yet we doubt not but it shall in the end
appear to all the world, that our endeavors have been most hearty and
sincere, for the maintenance of the true Protestant Religion, the Kings just
Prerogatives, the Laws and Liberties of the Land, and the Privileges of
Parliament; in which endeavors by the grace of God we will still persist,
though we should perish in the work: which if it should be, it is much to be
feared, That Religion, Laws, Liberties and Parliaments, would not be
long-lived after us.

FINIS.
