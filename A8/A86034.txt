The Epistle Dedicatory.
TO THE Professors and Practisers Of the COMMON LAW OF ENGLAND.
Candid Reader.
THis Tract in French, was bequeathed to me by an Alliance, William Glisson
Esquire deceased, which I have translated into our own Language for the Common
benefit of all. I am not singular in it, for daily experience manifests the
contrary: neither is it a Novelty for Law Books to appear in this dress.
Antiquity may be plead^d, Sr. Germin Perkins, Stanford, Cromp^on, Lambert, Sr
Henry Finch, Dalton, and diverse others have in former days trodden this path.
My desires are it may not be perused by those who read only to fault, what they
cannot mend, but by those whose judicious Pen will correct the errors as
Cognizances of humane frailty, I wish it successful to all, be he Pleader or
Practiser, and that the Common Law of England may shine forth in these Cloudy,
and ecclipsed days is the prayer of him, who is

Account against a Guardian in Soccage.
In what Court Account lies against a Gardein in Soccage.
IT lies in the County or Common Ban. Not. br. 117. b.

It lies not before the Shrieve 43 Edw. 3. fol. 21. pl. 11. Thorp; For Brook,
Account 14. says the Shrieve cannot assign Auditors.

A good plea to say the Land is ancient demean, because the reality may come in
question, Coke 5 part, fol. 105. A. Aldens case.

It lies not in the Marshalsey: Coke 10. part, 74. b. Marshalsey.

Who shall have a Writ against Gardein in Soccage.
The Heir in ward shall maintain an Action after the age of fourteen years, or
at his full Age at his election. Littleton.

But Not. br. 118. b. he shall not have it till the age of 21 years. Crook

If the heir in such case dye before his full age, his Executor shall maintain
an Action of Account, Crook 131. Pl. 106.

Yet note the heir in Gavel-kinde at fifteen years brought an account against a
Guardian in Soccage, and shows, by the Custom he may alien at such age; and
for this cause he was awarded to account, per Welby. 29 Edw. 3. fol. ^. pl. 13.

The Executor of an Heir shall have an Account: per Westminster. 2. cap. 23.
Littleton 27. A. Crook 131. Pl. 106.

Executor of an Executor shall have an Account by 25 Edw. 3. cap. 23. Com. 290.

Filius and Here Is Domini defuncti non habebit breve de computo, quia pertinet
ad executionem administrationis bonorum defuncti. Regist. Orig. 135. b.

Recusant shall not have an action for any thing that is seized into the hands

But if one occupy, and after Guardian in Soccage recover in right of the
Ward, the party shall not render an account to the Heir, for the Guardian ought
to account for this* 27 Edw. 3. 79. Guard. 22.

The reason is (as it seems) that the Writ does not make mention of the blood.
Regist. origin. 136. b. neither the Count. Lib. intra.

Account lies not against an Executor of a Guardian, Littleton. Nam non jacet
versus executores, quia mere pertinet ad Curam Christianam, cognoscere de
compto reddendo versus executores. Regist. origin. 135. b. 28 Hen. 8. Dyer: 23.

But if Executors account, an Action of debt lies for the Arrearages. 2. Hen.

And if the Testator covenants to account to the Heir and does not, Covenant

For the Marriage of the Heir, if he marry before the Age of fourteen years:
Littleton 27. A.

If the marriage be not as great in value as the marriage of the Heir:

present thereunto. Not. br. 33. T. 28 Edw. 3. 89. 29. Edw. 3. 5. 8. Edw. 2.

But by Daniel Justice Trin. 1 Jac. Com. Ban. Rott. 853. Shopland against

It lies for writings, 32 Edw. 3. Account. 60.

The Account against a Guardian in Soccage.
The Heir counts that it was ordained by the Common Council the Guardian should
account, etc. and shows the tenure specially, and that the Defendant had the
custody of the Lands, etc. from such a day for 12 years ensuing and has not
accounted for the issues and profits, etc. and that at such a day the heir was

Note this Writ lies against any one that occupies the land during the nonage
of the ward, whether it be the parents of the Heir or not, Regist. origin. 136.
b. for it makes no mention of the blood, but only of taking the profits.

Account of the Receipt of Moneys by the hands of the wife and a stranger not
good, because they ought to have been several issues, 43 Edw. 3. 33. Pl. 34.

But if the Account be of the delivery by the hands of the wife of the
Plaintiff it had been good, 5 Edw. 3. 146. pl. 6. Count of Baylment by the

And so of the delivery of a stranger and the wife of the Plaintiff, 43 Edw. 3.

Account that the Defendant sold a thing to A. and recived 20 l. and another to

Bar.
Bar in detinue is a bar in account, per Briau. 2 Rich. 3. 14. Pl. 19. for the
one and the other affirm property.

Coverture.
The Defendant said that the Plaintiff at the time, etc. was under Covert Barn,
and this was good, 6 Edw. 3. 184. Pl. 5. Vide 18 Hen. 6. 3. pl. 3. 2 Hen. 7. 15.

Delivery.
Delivery to another by the command of the Plaintiff Male: but to say that he
was Bailey to deliver to B. of the which he had a deed, this is good; because he
had not confessed it by the account render, 19 Hen. 6. 5. Pl. 10. 26 Hen. 49.
Pl. 7. 30 Hen. 6. 5. Pl. 4. 41 Edw. 3. 31. Pl. 37. Lib. Iutra. 20. A. Sect. 5.

Account against a Carrier who said that goods were delivered to him to deliver
to B. which he had done without that he was Receiver in any other manner, this
is a good bar, Mich. 40. 41 Eliz. Com. Ban. Burrel versus Callice.

So if the plt. deliver to one 20 p. to carry to Lombard to be exchanged, and
he brings a bill of exchange for the money without that that he was a Receiver
for account render, for by this he does not confess the recits for
Account-rendering. 5 Hen. 5. 4. pl. 10. 28 Hen. 6. 9. pl. 1. 3 Hen. 6. 4. pl. 4.

So if the plt. deliver to one 20 p. to obtain a discharge under the great
Seal of Customs 10. Hogsheads of wine, the which he has done this is good. 30
Hen. 6. 5. pl. 4.

Redelivery.
Redelivery to the plt. without accquittance not good. 39 Edw. 3. 19. pl. 21.

So if it be with an accquittanc. 3 Edw. 3. 52. pl. 13. becuse by this he has
confessed the receipt for account-render.

But this is good before Auditors. 29 Edw. 3. 35* pl. 1.

The defendant pleads that he, as messenger of the plaintiff received of C.
being provost to the plaintiff and this paid and delivered to the plaintiff,
this is no bar because by the Receipt he is liable to the account. 6 Edw. 3.
185. pl. 7. 29. Edw. 3. 20. pl. 11.

More.
An account of a Receipt by the hands of B. 1. of May, till the first of July,
it is no plea that B. is dead 3 of May because because he may receive this the
2 of May. 8 Hen. 6. 32. pl. 28.

Obligation.
A. delivers 20 l. to B. to redeliver; B. binds himself to pay this; no bar in
account. 4 Edw. 3. 125. pl. 45.

Payment.
Defendant pleads, the plantif being in his debt commands him to receive of B.
so much to his own use as will satisfy his debt, which he does without that
that he was his Receiver for account-render, and good. Lib. Intra. 20. A. et B.
sect. 6. 5 Edw. 4. 29. B. Brian.

But if he confess the receipt upon account and commands him afterward to
retain the debt, this is no bar. 28 Hen. 6. 7. pl. 9.

Robery.
No plea that he was factor and was Robbed, but a good plea before Auditors.
Coke. 4. part. 84. A. 41 Edw. 3. 3. pl. 9.

Vende.
Vende and takes an obligation no bar. 28 Hen. 8. Dyer. 29. pl. 193.

Unison Receiver.
Upon Recipt by others hands, a good plea that he was never Receiver by their
hands. 10 Edw. 4. 8. A. 7 Edw. 3. 259. pl. 13. 8 Edw. 3. 285. pl. 34. 7 Edw. 3.
242. pl. 1. 24 Edw. 3. 66. pl. 74. 25 Edw. 3. 39. pl. 24.

But 5 Edw. 3. 159. pl. 22. this is not good* but shall say generally, that he
never was his Receiver.

If one testify his receipt by deed he cannot plead that he never was his
receiver. 10 Edw* 3. 383. pl. 18.

Defendant pleads that he is executor of B. and that he received the money as a
debt of B. this not good, because the Plantiff supposes him his receiver; but
ought to say, without that, that he received it as the money of the Plaintiff,
11 Hen. 4. 79. pl. 20. 13 Hen. 4. pl. 1.

Note if the Receipt be by the hands of the Plaintiff the Defendant may wage his
law, 7 Edw. 3. 269 pl. 52.

So upon the delivery of the wife of the Plaintiff, 13 Hen. 4. 8. 43 Edw. 3.
33. pl. 31.

But upon a Receipt by other hands he cannot, 9 Eliz. Dyer 265. pl. 2. 22 Hen.
6. 39. pl. 10. 5 Edw. 3. 159. pl. 22. 33 Hen. 6. 8. B. Moyle. because the
Receipt lies in notice of the Country.

An Executor brought an account upon the delivery of the Testator, the
Defendant cannot wage his law, 7 Edw. 3 269. pl. 52.

Outlary.
Outlary of the Plaintiff after the Receipt a good bar, although he had a
Charter of pardon, 28 Edw. 3. 92. pl. 10.

Accord.
A good plea that after the Receipt he married the daughter of the Plaintiff,
and it was then agreed that he should keep the money, 12 Hen. 4. 18. A.

So that he put the money in a bag, and that he should keep it in liew of a
debt, 28 Hen. 8. 7. pl. 9. Delivery and Redelivery.


Delivery over by command of the Plaintiff a good plea, 19 Hen. 6. 5. pl. 10.
Lib. Intr. 20. A. Sect. 5. 42 Edw. 6. pl. 21.

Redelivery.
Re-delivery good without an acquittance, because he cannot compel the
Plaintiff to make an acquittance, 29 Edw. 3. 35. pl. 1. 6 Edw. 3. 185. pl. 7.
29 Edw. 3. 20. pl. 11. but it seems it may be a good plea before Auditors.

Expenses.
Expenses reasonable shall be allowed to a Factor, 3 Edw. 3, 56. pl. 30.

A Factor pleads that he was robbed, Coke 4. part. 84. A. Southcots case 41
Edw. 3. 3. pl. 9.

So for goods lost by Tempest, 3 Edw. 3. 56. pl. 30. 41 Edw. 3. 3. Pl. 9.

So for goods sold under value by reason of war, 3 Edw. 3. 56. pl. 30.

Receipt in Satisfaction.
Defendant said he received money in full satisfaction of a debt of another,
etc. this was held void, because he did not name that he never was his
Receiver, the which was found before Hill. 43 Eliz. Com. Ban. Rott. 1707.
Treshams case.

Vendee.
Vendee takes an obligation in the name of the Plaintiff, a good plea, 28 Hen.
8. Dyer 29, pl. 193.

But then he ought to show that the obligor was sufficient at that time, 3 Edw.
3. 56. pl. 30.

The judgment against a Receiver, 1. of Account. 2. to recover,
1. The judgment is quod computet, and ideo in miserecordia quia prius inde
non computavit, Coke 11. part. 38. A. Metcalfs case, Lib. Intr. 19. D. sect. 1.

Quod computet for parcel, and bar for the remainder, Lib. Intr. 22. A. Sect. 2.

But if he confess part and traverse the other, no judgment shall be till the
other be tried, 41 Edw. 3. Account 34.

The judgment is, Ideo consideratum quod praedictus W. recuperet versus
praefat. M. so much as is found in Arrerages, and dampna occasion
implacitationis, etc. Coke 11. part. 40. A. Metcalfs case.

The King is not held to account against any as Receiver, but generally, quod

But there is another form of a Writ founded upon the Statute of Marlebridge,
Cap. 23. Not. br. 117. H. Regist. orig. 136. B.

A good plea to the Writ that he was Bailey and not Receiver, for otherwise he
shall be twice charged, 3 Edw. 3. 70. pl. 28. 18 Edw. 4. 3. pl. 17.

A good plea to the Writ that he was Guardian in Soccage, 18. Edw. 4. 3. pl. 17.

The Writ shall be always general, and if the cause be special it shall be in
the County, Not. br. 118. F.

The Defendant pleads the Receipt by deed, and demands judgment of the Writ
without showing it, this is no plea to the Writ; because the Receipt and not the
dead is the cause of Action, 1 Hen. 6. 8. 28 Hen. 8. Dyer 20. pl. 121. But the
9 Edw. 4. 50. B. per Choke contra. 2 Hen. 6. 9. quaere.

No plea to the Writ if they do not agree with the Plaintiff concerning the
manner of the Receipt, 4 Hen. 6. 12. pl. 4.

The Process against a Receiver, 1. before Appearance. 2 after.
At the common law the Process was but a distress infinite, Coke 3. part. 12.
A. Harberts case.

But per Marlebridg cap. 23. a Capias is given, Coke 3. part. 12. A.

And by Westminster. 2. cap. 11. Process of Outlary is given, Coke 3. part. 12. A. 17

And if he come not upon summons returned, Judgment shall be given against
him, 5 Edw. 3. 159. pl. 20. 21 Edw. 3. 1.

Conusor of a Statute shall have a Scire facias against a Conusee de Account,
Coke 4. part. 67. B. 47 Edw. 3. 11. Pl. 9. and fol. 25. Pl. 63.

So the Assignee of a Conusor, 25 Edw. 3. 53. Pl. 17.

But then he cannot surmise that it was appraised and found of base value, 17
Edw. 3. 36. Pl. 6.

If a Receiver come in by a Capias or Exigend, he shall be forthwith committed
to the Fleet, 29 Edw. 35. Pl. 63.

So if he come in by distress, and the account be adjudged against him, 29 Edw.
3. 35. Pl. 63.

But if the account be adjudged against him, and he be not present in Court, a
Capias ad computandum shall issue out, 1 Edw. 3. 2. Pl. 10. 1 Hen. 7. 1. Pl. 1.
Townsend Lib. Intr. 18. Sect. 1, 2, 3

Judgment given quod computet, the Plaintiff dies, the Executors shall have a
Scire facias, which being served, if he appear not an Exigend. shall issue
forth, 14 Hen. 4. 1.

But if the Defendant be taken per Capias ad computandum, and dies in prison, a
Scire facias lies not against his Executors, 10 Edw. 4. 7. 41. Assize.

Bar by a Receiver. 1. to an Action of Account. 2. before Auditors.
Bought.
The Defendant pleads, he bought the goods of the Plaintiff, and he brought
this Action for them, a good Bar, 14 Hen. 4. 19. Pl. 21.

Accord.
The Defendant pleads, that it was agreed that he should be bound to the
Plaintiff for the principal and use, the which he did, this is a good Bar, 22
Hen. 6. 55. Pl. 32. for this drowns the contract: otherwise he ought to plead
this before Auditors.

So if the Plaintiff grant, that if the Defendant pay 20 l. will withdraw his
Action, a good Bar: because by way of Accord, 7 Edw. 3 325. Pl. 11. 18 Edw. 3.
39. Pl. 35.

No plea that he put it in a bag, and that the Plaintiff agreed that he should
keep it in liew of a debt; because the Receipt for account-render is confessed,
28 Hen. 6. 7. Pl. 9.

The Count was that he did account of such a Sum such a day, and year, and
place, before A. and B. Auditors assigned by the Plaintiff, a good Bar, Lib.
Intra. 19. D. Sect. 3. 25 Edw. 3. 39. Pl. 1. 2 Edw. 3. 45. Pl. 13.

Count of diverse sums received between such and such a day, and pleads to
parcel of the time, that he has fully accounted, and to the Remainder that he
was not his Receiver, there he ought to show of what he had accounted, 30 Edw.
3. 1. Pl. 4.

That he accounted to the Plaintiff from three months to three months a good
Bar, 39 Edw. 3. 5. Pl. 22.

A good Bar that he did account 1o April. but then he ought to say, without
that, that he was his Reciever before or after, 21 Edw. 4. 66. Pl. 47 7 Hen. 4.
14. Pl. 17. 45 Edw. 3. 14. Pl. 13. 34 Hen. 6. 44.

Counts that he was Receiver for seven years it is no Bar, that he accounted 1o
Maii Anno 5o without answering for the two other years because he is to answer
for the whole time, as well for the increase as principal, 7 Hen. 6. 5. Pl. 8.

As to 20 s. received 1o Jun. fully accounted for, and to the receipt afterward
or before that he never was Receiver, 27 Hen. 6. 1. Pl. 8.

A good Bar quod 21. Jannarii Anno, etc. to D. in the County of W. he fully
accounted with the Plaintiff, Lib. Intr. 20. B. Sect. 8, 9, 10. 11. Before the
Writ he did account with the Plaintiff, a good Bar, 4 Hen. 6. 43. pl. 4.

But he ought to account to the Plaintiff before he is imprisoned, or else no
Bar, 22 Edw. 3. 3. pl. 32. 7 Hen. 4. 14. 34 Hen. 6. 44. pl. 4.

For the Plaintiff cannot commit him to prison, for Westminster. 2. cap. 11. gives
this only to Auditors, 45 Edw. 3. 14. pl. 13.

Account brought by Executors a good Bar, that they did account to the Testator
and show his acquittances, 1 Edw. 3. 2. pl. 10.

Defendant pleads award by Arbitrators that he redeliver the goods, this is
naught; but if he had been charged only with the safety of them, then good, 2
Hen. 5. 2. pl. 6.

Account upon a Receipt by other hands, Arbitrament is a good Bar, 22 Hen. 6.
39. pl. 10.

Execution against a Receiver, 1. per Common Law. 2. per Statute Law.
1. By the Common Law it was but a Levari facias, or Fieri facias, Coke 3.
part. 12. A. Harberts case.

And this only within the year, for if the year was past, then an Action of
debt.

Unless the Process be continued, 33 Hen. 6. 49. pl. 33.

2. Per Westminster. 2. cap. 45. a Scire facias is giv en after the year, Coke 3.
part. 12. A.

same law is if he will not account before Auditors, 10 Edw. 3. 387. pl. 28.

But this shall be forthwith, Coke 8. part. 119. B. Bonhams case, 27 Hen. 6. 8.

An administratrix desires ^o be forborne till such a time and then she will

count there, and needs not say in the count that she has assets for it shall

Fobearance.
The same law is of a strangers promise, Coke. 9. part. 94. A.

Com. Ban. Milwards case.

Then the count ought to show how the debt grew due, Coke. 10. part. 77. A.

Yet A. counts that B. was indebted to him in 20 l. but shows not how long, and
that the 10. of September. 7. Jac. promises if the plaintiff would not arrest
him, but forbear till the 21. of September he would pay him, and sets forth

forbearance for a certain time there it is good without showing, when the debt
grew due, but otherwise when the forbearance is for a time uncertain, Trin. 9.
Jac. Ban. Regis. Deane et Nuby.

This count was that the Intestate was indebted to him in a 100 l. and the
admistrator in consideration of forbearance by a reasonable time assumes to pay

Justice said forasmuch as the intestate was indebted and the administrator
promised, etc. and pleaded non assumpsit, it shall be intend h^ had notice of
the debt therefore good to which there was no answer, 2. forbearance by a
reasonable time is a good consideration because the Court may judge of it, but
forbearance per paululum temporis is not good to which the court agreed, Trin.
14 Eliz. Ban. Regis. Lingill et Broughton.

The Count was that where A. was indebted to him in 32 l. for which he sued A.
and that it was agreed between him and A. to stay the suit and if he paid it
not before Mich. he should give security, 1. he need not show how the debt grew
due because the forbearance is the cause of action, but otherwise when the
Testator is indebted and promises for, there the debt is the cause of the
action, 2. Cok. Chief Justice that he needs not show that he did surcease his
suit, because it was but a reciprocal agreement, but if A. in consideration
that the plaintiff shall surcease his suit promises to pay it, then he ought to
show that he did surcease, Pasc. 14. Jac. Ban. Regis. Fullers case.

W. indebted to B. delivers goods to L. to pay him, L. prays B. to stay 2 or 3
days and he will pay him, L. pays it not, B. shall have an action against L.
for it is a good consideration in so much that L. had goods to satisfy, Mich.
7. Jac. Ban. Regis. Brande et Lister.

A. pledges goods to B. and if A. pay not at such a day that B. shall have the
goods after and before the day, etc. C. requests B to forbear tell another day,
and he would pay it, yet B. may have an action against C. for if C. pay the

Rayneforde.

4. A. promises to B. that whereas his son was a suitor to his daughter, if
B. would give his assent A. would give to B. 50 l. this is a good
consideration, 1. because the daughter ought to have the consent of her
parents, 2. because the son of A. was to have advancement by the marriage,

cap. 3. statute. 1. 17. Edw. 2. 46. pl. 3.

Plene administravit, the Judgment is for so much of the principal as they had

Edw. 3. 66. pl. 83. 46 Edw. 3. 9. pl. 6. Judgment special for the debt.

Upon such plea the defendant prays execution forthwith, because it is a
confession of the debt, but no execution until the defendant had goods of the
testators, Coke. 8. part. Shippleys case. vide 21 Hen. 6. 40.

But if it be found to the defendant no scire facias lies against them, 4 Hen.

Lands. 4. Of what goods.

At the common law it was but a scire facias, Coke. 3. part. 12. or a levari

his action, of debt, Coke. 3. part. 12. A. Harberts case. unless the process be
continued, 33 Hen. 6. 49. pl. 33.

But for Recovery against an heir then it was but one Liberate, com. 441. A.

Mich. 41 and 42 Eliz. Com. Ban. if the Plaintiff dye after Execution, yet the
Shrieve may levy it, and if there be no Executor or Administrator, the moneys
shall remain in Court. But if the Defendant dye before Execution, there the
Shrieve cannot make Execution; for the words of the Writ are, that it shall be
levied of the goods of the Defendant. Thoroughgoods Case.

Upon a non est inventus returned of the Principal upon Judgment in Com. Ban.
the party shall have Execution against the Bayl, because the debt being by
original is certain, there the Lands which they had at the day of the taking
the recognizance shall be liable, but quaere in ban. Regis if more lands are
liable than they had the day of the original, because the debt is uncertain,

The King grants the Advowson to A. (the Church being void, and presents, 13
Eliz. Dye^ 330. pl. 36. grants or presents by Lapse, 21 Eliz. Dyer 364. pl. 28.

But the Issue in Tail ought to allege presentment in the Donor, because he
derives his title from him, Com. Mauxels case, fol. 4. B.

Presentation in him by which he claims.
If it be alleged in the Donor or Donee, Lessor or Lessee it is not double,
because the presentment of the Lessor or Donor is only traverseable, Coke 5.
part 98. A. Northumberlands case.

For the Lessee ought to allege it in the Lessor, Coke 5. part 98. A.

Yet Presentation by him is good, 8 Hen. 25. 4.

But in the Judgment of the Law, this is the Presentation of the Lessor, Coke

Edw. 3. pl. 29. 1. 6. Edw. 3. 204. pl. 7. Not. br. 33. H.

The Process in a Quare Impedit, 1. before appearance, 2. after.
Vide Lib. intra, 52. B. Sect. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. At the Common Law it was
but a Distress infinite, 11 Hen. 6. 3. Martin.

But per Marlebridge, cap. 12. if he appears not at the Grand Distress, a Writ

48. 7 Eliz. Dyer 241. pl. 1. Not. br. 38. N.

The same Law in a Scire Facias by the King upon A Judgment in a quare

Hankeford, 21 Hen. 6. 56. pl. 13. 11 Hen. 6. 3. pl. 8. because the process is
determined, vide 27 Hen. 6. 5. pl. 32.

And this is for the mischief of the Lapse, 24 Edw. 3. 37.

But if a Nihil be returned upon the summons Attachment and distress, quaere,
11 Hen. 6. 3. a Writ to the Bishop 4. yet the better opinion there is that a
Writ shall Issue to the Bishop.

And if a Quare Impedit be against two, one appears at the Grande* Distress the
other makes Default, a Writ shall Issue to the Bishop pro querente against him
that made Default, Not. br. 39. B. 14 Hen. 7. 19.

But if the title of one be found, and another present, and request is made to
admit the Clerk, for which it was found, it is not Litigious, 22 Hen. 6. 28.

Seisin.
When the Lord varies from the truth of the quantity of his services by reason
of seisin, there he cannot traverse the seisin, Coke 9. part 33 A. Com. 94. B.

But if they vary of the quantity by reason of seisin, there the seisin is
traversable, Coke 9. part, 33. A. Bucknals case, Com. 94. B. Mantels case, 18
Edw. 2. Avowry 217.

Not seized generally a good Bar, for by this he shall have no remedy of the
Lord, Coke 9. part 34. B. Bucknals case, 22 Hen. 6. 3 A. 30. Henry 6. Avowry 15.

But if he avow and alleadg seisin by the hands of the Plaintiff or other, the
Plaintiff shall say, never seized by his hands, Coke 9. part 35. A. Bucknals

alleged of a superior service, as if tenure be alleged per Homage fealty,

Not seized within 40 years a good bar, 32 Hen. 8, cap. 2. Coke 9 part. 36.
Bucknalls case, 14 Eliz Dyer. 315. pl. 101.

But he that pleads this ought first to confess a tenure to the intent that
the Lord may have a writ of customs and services 15 Rich. 2. avowry 214. Coke
9 part. 34. B. Bucknalls case.

But this is no plea in avoury for rent upon a grant or reservation by deed
because the deed is the title, Coke 8 part. 65. A. Fosters case.

Or upon a gift in Tail because the commencement is within the time of memory,
Coke 8 part. 64. A. Fosters case, 4 part 11. A. Bevills case.

Or if it be for casual services as homage, fealty or to go to war because

Seisin avoided in avowry.
1. The Issue in tail shall avoid seisin by the hands of the tenant in tail,
Coke 9 part. 34. A. Bucknalls case, 34 Edw. 3. Avowry 131.

But this is intended when the tenant makes a gift in Tail remainder in fee,
for the tenant in tail shall himself avoid the encroachment between, by the
donor because he ought to show the commencement of the reservation, Coke 8
part. 65. A. Fosters case, 10. part. 108. Lofeilds case.

5 Such seisin shall be avoided because it was by cohersion of distress, Coke 9
part. 34, B. Bucknells case, 12 Edw. 4, 7, pl. 18. 8 Hen. 6, 18, pl. 1. 47 Edw.

But then the tenant ought to confess the tenure in part, for he needs not
traverse all the tenure, but may disclaim or plead out of his fee, Coke 9. part
35. A. Bucknals case, 10 Hen. 6. 6, 7. pl. 20. 37 Hen. 6. 25. pl. 13. 15 Rich.

But note 11 Hen. 4. 10. pl. ^2. the Tenant said, that the Avowant did give the
Lordship to A. in tail, the remainder to B. in tail, A. dies without issue, B.
yet living, there he needs not suffer* a Disclaymer, or plead out of his fee,
but there fol. 7. pl. 40. he had judgment of the Avowry and admitted.

alsque hoc, that he held modo and forma, or that he held one only, Coke 9.

part 35. B. Bucknals case, 9 Henry 6. 26 pl. 24. 2 Ed. 3. 34 pl. 19.

But if he vary in the quantity of the Land and of the services, he may not
confess the tenure according to the verity, he traverseth modo and forma, or
with one only, Coke 9 part 35. A. and B. Bucknals case, 5 Henry 5. 4.

3. When one distrayns for fealty, rent, and suit, and alleadges seisin in all,
and avows for rent, the Tenant may confess that he held by fealty and rent, and
to the rent nothing arrear, without that that they held by fealty, rent, and
suit, modo and forma, and good, and if upon issue joined it be found, that he
held by fealty and rent, and not suit, although that the Avowry be for rent,
yet in so much that the tenure alleged by the Avowant was traversed and found
against him, Judgment shall be given against the Avowany, for in vain shall he
make this traverseable, and yet that he should have the return when it is found
against him, Coke 9. part 35, and 36. Bucknals case.

return awarded without an Avowry, 27 Hen. 6. 3. pl. 35.

One avows for rent at two days, one is not come, the Plaintiff is nonsuited;

Trespass lies not against the Lord per Marlebridge, cap. 13.

But before this Statute trespass lies against the Lord, vi and armis, 48 Edward
3. 20. pl. 16. Thorp.

The reason that it lies not against the Lord is insomuch that he cannot come
within his fee against the peace, although he had not cause to distrain, 47 Ed.
3. 7. pl. 3. Finchden.

This Statute is intended as well of every Lessor as of the Lord, 9 Hen. 6. 43.
pl. 21.

If the Lord distrain where nothing is in arrear, yet trespass lies not against
him, Coke 4. part 11. B. Bevils case, 9 part, 76. A. because he may do this as
Lord.

But if the Lord distrain where there is nothing arrear, and the Mesn will put
his Cattle in the Pound for the Cattle of the Tenant, and the Lord will not
permit him, trespass lies against the Lord, Coke 9 part. 22. B. Case of Avowry.

6. pl. 10.

If he cut the Trees, or stay all night, 11 Hen. 4. 75.

The Lessee cuts Trees to repair, the Lessor carries them away, and Trespass

35. pl. 34.

It lies by a Copyholder against the Lord that outs him, 21 Edw. 4. 80. Coke 4
part, 22. A.

The reason in all these Cases is when one has authority, license, or entry by
the Law given him by the misusing it, or the not doing, he is a Trespasser ab
initio, Coke 8. 146.

Deaf and dumb.
It lies against one that is deaf and dumb, Digist. br. 72. A.

Tenant at will.
If Tenant at will make voluntary; waste, Coke 5. part 13. B. Salops case,
Littleton, 15. A. fo. per 3 Mariae, Dyer 122. B. This is a determination of the
Will, and Trespass lies without entry.

For Cutting underwood, 2 Edw. 4. 24. pl. 25. Tenant by sufferance.


It lies not against Tenant by sufferance, because he comes lawfully to the
possession, 22 Edw. 4. 13. pl. 3.

Tenant in Common.
If two Tenants in common of a foldage by prescription, one shall have trespass
against the other, for the breaking the fold, Not. br. 91. A. H. Meer-stone.

I Will of Man.
Erroneous judgment given in the Isle of Man may not be redressed in England,

2. Within the Realm in Court superior as Parliamen^. Ban. Regis.
Judgment given Ban. Regis, Error lies in the sane Court per Common law, if it
be error in process, or default of Clarks, Not. br. 21. I. 7. Hen. 6. 28. pl.

But error in process or default of Clarks ought to be redressed in the same
Term; or otherwise it lies not in the same Court as it seems by the Justices,
Trin. 7 Jac. Ban. Regis, Prowse and Skeynner.

But one case was Mich. 41 and 42 Eliz. Rot. 639. which is a rule that error
lies in another Term upon Error in Process, when the party cannot have error in
the Chequer Chamber.

But by the 27 Eliz. cap. 8. if judgment be given in Ban. Regis, upon a suit
commenced, there the writ of error lies in the Chequer Chamber, before the
Justices of the Common ban. and Barons of the Chequer, or fix of them, Coke 3.
part 7. B. 4. part 7. B. 4. part 53, and 86. A. 5 part 18. B. 28. A. 43 A. 97.

But then it ought to be in Debt, Detinue, Account, Covenant, Ejectione firmae,
Trespass upon the case.

And also nothing shall be assigned for Error in Jurisdiction of the Court, or
form of the Writ, Return, Plaint, Bill, Declaration, Pleadings, Process,

And also a writ of Error lies upon this in Parliament.

But another subject upon this being grieved shall have this redressed in
Parliament, 16 Edw. 3. bre. 651. 37 Hen. 6. 13.

in Ban. and judgment given there it shall be redressed in Ban. Regis, 8 Hen.

12. 6 Hen. 4. 8. pl. 30.

Note.
But note in a writ of Error upon a judgment given in Chester, day shall be
given for so long time that three Counties may be held there, before the return
of the writ in Ban. Regis, within the which time the Justices or Lieutenant of
the same County may redress the error by the usage of the said County, Regist.
orig. 17. A.

But in a Writ of Error upon a Writ of Error they have no such power, but the
Record and the Process ought to be remanded at the first County into Ban. Regis,
Regist. orig. 17. A. Lib. intra. 290. A. sect. 1. Chester.

And by usage in the same County, nine Countyes shall be held one year, and
eight another year, etc. Regist. orig. 17* A.

The usage is to have a Writ out of the Chancery retornable in Ban. Regis, for
Writs of Error are excepted in Charters granted at Chester.

And in this Error there the Justices may award a Scire facias against the
Defendant, returnable at the next County, and if the judgment be affirmed the
party may have a Special Writ of Error, reciting the former Writ, and have the
Records and Process of both judgments removed in Ban. Regis, there to be
examined, and a Scire facias awarded against the Tertenant, for otherwise the
party shall not be restored to that which he lost, 15 Eliz. Dyer 321. pl. 20.
21 Hen. 7. 34. pl. 32. Fineux, 34 Hen. 6. 42. 6 Hen. 4. 8. pl. 36. Lib. intra.
290. B. sect. 1. Chester.

And by 18 Eliz. Dyer 345. pl. 6* if the judgment be reversed the party shall
be restored* and the Judges there forfeit to the King 100 l. although the
judgment was given by their Predecessors.

But then it is not intended of Error in deed, but only of Error within the
Record or Process, No. Lib. intra. (...) A. sect. 2.

Stannarie^.
If erroneous judgment be given in the Stannaryes, it shall be redressed
before the Warden of the Stannaryes and after, before the counsel of the
Prince, and after before the King himself.

Pasc. 7. Iac. Regis per Flemming chief Justice, a writ of Error or false
judgment lies not upon judgment given in the Court of the Stannaryes, as was
resolved by all the Justices, and it seems the reason is because it is but an
English Court,

Pasc. 1. Jacobi Regis, Rot. 426. Countess of Bedford against Foster, 1. Error
assigned, because the Writ of Covenant was of 8 Messuages, and 2 Tofts, the
Fine certified is of 8 Messuages, 2 Messuages but non allocatur, because the
Record has relation to the Writ of Covenant, 2. Error assigned, because the
indorsement was Executio istius brevis patet in quadam panella, etc. where it
should be in quadam scedula, sed non allocatur, because in substance it is the
same.

Mich. 30 Eliz. Ban. Regis, Austein and Steed versus Conaway and Web, a Fine

Note.
Note when a thing is a mendible before the Writ of Error brought, it is
amendible as well after, and this by a Superior Court, as well as an
Inferior, Coke 8. part 162. A. Blackamores case*

Note.
Note that those things that are not amendible are Errors at this day.

When Judgment is given, but not upon verdict of 12. upon Issue joined there
are seven Errors not amendible, Coke 8. part 162. A. Blackamores case.

1 Original.
Fault of the Original, No. Lib. intra. 246. D.

2 Form.
Misprison of the form of the Original, false Latin, or variance from the
Register.

3 Count.
Material variance between the Original and the Count, as C. W. in the Writ,
and W. W. in the Count, Coke 5. part 37. Bishops case.

4 Pleading.
Jeofayl, fault of Color, insufficient pleading, or some default of the
person, or of his Counsel.

Error, or misprision of the Judges in another Term, Misericordia pro Capiatur,
and e contra, Coke 8. part 59. A. 41 Eliz. Dyer 315. pl. 99.

6 Warrant. 7 Appeal.
Fault of warrant of Attorney.

Error in pleas of the Crown and Appeals, or in proceedings upon them, they are
not amendable, for they are excepted, out of the Statute of Amendments, and
also Error in the Exigent to make one to be outlawed, Coke 8. part 162. A.
Blackamores case.

What things are amendable after verdict. ^ Material varience.
When judgment is given upon verdict of twelve, upon issue joined there are
twelve misprisions not to be remedyed, Coke 8. part 163. Blackamores case.

Material variance between the Original and the Count, Coke 5. part 37 Bishops
case.

The Original is Barbara, and the Count is Barbaria, this is erroneous, Mich.
9. Jac. Ban. Regis, Harrison and Fettiplace.

Waste brought in Burrum Appleby, and Flackebridge, and the Account is of waste
made in Burrum Appleby and Flackbridge Park in Langton, and it is variance,
because there is more in the Count, then in the Writ, Hill. 12 Jac. Com. ban.
Countess of Cumberlands case.

When the Original of the Count differs in the substance, Coke 5. part 45.

Husband and Wife brought debt, or an Action for rent due to them where it was
due to the Wife before Coverture, this is aided by the Statute, and good after
Verdict, Trin. 9 Jac. Ban. Regis, Poor versus Boule.

Hill. 36 Eliz. Ban. Regis, Rot. 610. Griffin versus Elliot.

Ejectione firmae, fault (vi and armis) yet this is but a form, and shall not
stay judgment after Verdict, and then it was also said, that these words are
not material, for it may be without them, 7 Hen. 6. 4. 17 Edward 3. 1.

3 Misprion of the Visne.
When the Venue is mistaken.

The issue was that within the Manor of Wargrave, and it was of the manor of
Wafield, demiseable by Copy of Court Roll, etc. the Venue was of the Manor of
Wargrave, and good, because the issue was upon the Custom within the Manor of
Wargrave, Coke 11. part 18. A. Nevils case, but if one Manor was in one County
and another in another, then otherwise, Mich. 11. Ia^. Ban. Regis in the same
case.

1. Trin. 11 Iac. Ban. Regis, Morton versus Orde resolved in Error 1.

Infancy during Nonage shall be tried by the Justices, Coke 9. part 30. 17
Edw. 2. Account 122. 46 Ed. 3. 8. 48 Edw. 3. 11. 14 Hen. 4.

3. 19 Hen. 6. 51.

4. If it be an Action personal as Ejectione firmae, it shall be tried where
the Action is brought, 21 Edw 3. 7. 3 Hen. 6. 40. 34 Hen. 6. 50. and so it was
adjudged.

4 Shreives Return.
When the Return is by the Shrieve, where it ought to be by the Commoners, or e
converso.

5 Jury.
When the Shrieve puts not his name to the Return of the Jury.

6 Venire facias.
When there is no return indorsed upon the Venire facias, so if the name of the
Shrieve be not put to the Writ of Inquiry, Damages, Mich. 9 Jac. in the
Chequer Chamber, Shackly versus Porter.

7 Verdict.
When one gives the Verdict that was not returned in the Venire facias.

8 Action.
When it appears by all the Record, that the Plaintiff had no cause of Action.

9 Crown.
In Appeal, or Pleas of the Crown, or in any proceedings upon them.

Or to the Writ, Bill, or Action, Informations, upon popular or penal Statutes.

10 Law. Judgment.
Error in Law by misprision of the Judges in the judgment entered in another
term, Coke 5. part 57. B. Specots case.

Action upon the case in Cur. Wallingford, the judgment was, quod deft.
capiatur, this is error being but an Action upon the Concessum est pro (...)
eratum est.
case, Trin. 9 Iac. Ban. Regis, Northcot versus Heywood,

Concessum est, where it should be Consideratum est, this is error although
there are 21 Presidents in my Lord Cooks Reports, for by Man Secondary the
Books are false printed, Mich. 18 Iac. Ban. Regis, Rot. 641. and by Williams,
if it be videbitur Curiae, this is erroneous.

If it be Capiatur against the Defendant in Ejectione firmae, Mich. 8 Iac. Ban.
Regis, Rot. 232. Dolby versus Holbrook.

Jurisdiction of Court.
It is ordained per 27 Eliz. cap. 8. that if Error be brought in the Chequer
upon a judgment in Ban. Regis, they shall not assign in the Jurisdiction of
the Court, or in form of the Writ, Return, Plaint, Bill, Declaration, Pleading,
Process, Verdict* or Proceedings.

And also there is a Proviso if it be in debt, detinue, account, covenant,
ejectione firmae, traverse, action upon the Case.

In process.
The party cannot show Error in Process in delay, unless he show that it is for
his disadvantage, 7 Edw. 3. 25. Coke 8. part 59. A. Beechers case.

Judge.
Nothing that is contrary to the Office of a Judge shall be assigned for Error,
Not. br. 21. B. 7 Hen. 7. 4.

Granting of Aid where it shall not be is not Error, so of Receipt, 7 Edw. 4.
12. 21 Edw. 4. 65. B. 5 Hen. 7. 8. 8 Hen. 7. 9. 11. 14 Hen. 6. 5. pl. pl. 25.

So of Garnishment, 14 Edw. 4. 1. pl. 3.

So of making Attorney, Not. br. 22. D. 21 Edw. 4. 77.

Visne.
But denial of Aid or Receipt where it ought to be is error, Edw. 4. 65. B. 5
Hen. 7. 8. 8 Hen. 7. 9.

Visne.
When the Visne is mistaken.

In Replevin.
Replevin, the Defendant prescribes to have all the Pasture of such a place in
in W. except Common for the Inhabitants of D. and the prescription being
traversed, the Jury was of the Visne of W. only, and this was a good rule in
Error, because the exception to the Inhabitants of D. was void, therefore this
was not in issue, Trin. 11 Iac. Ban. Regis, Wicker versus Stockeman.

In waste.
Waste brought, the Issue was for certain Oaks cut for repairing of the Castle
of Burrum the Visne was of the Village of Burrum, where it should have been of
the Castle of Burrum, this is Error, Hill. 12. Iac. Com. ban. the Countess of
Cumberlands case.

Trover and Conversion.
Trover and Conversion brought in Coventry, upon not guilty pleaded the Visne
was De Vicineto Civitatis Coventriae, and this showed in arrest of Judgment,
sed non allocatur, and Error upon it brought, and it seems that by Williams and
Yelverton Justices, that it is Error, for it shall be of Coventry, for
Vicinetum is of the Neighbors, and excludes the City, and the Shrieve of the
County ought to make it out, 7 Hen. 6. 36. B. 4. Edward 4. 39. 7 Henry 4. 12.
80. Enquest. 36. quaere tamen, for the Court did advise about bringing a new
Action, Pasc. 9. Iac. Ban. Regis, Procter versus Clyfton.

Trespass.
Trespass for lopping of Wood in Hurslay, the Defendant pleads that the place
is parcel of the Manor of Mamden in the Parish of Hurslay, and the Custom is,
that the Copyholder may cut, etc. and found for the Plaintiff, and the Visne
was of Hurslay, and it was moved that it was not good, for the Parish is not
certain, because it may comprehend more Villages, but it was good per Curiam,
because Hursley shall be taken to be a Village and Parish, and shall not be
intended, that there are more Villages in one Parish, 5 Edw. 3. 20. Mich. 9
Iac. Ban. Regis, Brocke versus Spencer. Condition to pay money.


Hill. 9 Jac. Ban. Regis, Savil and Cavendish Condition to pay money in the
Church Porch of the Parish of H. and pleads performance, the Visne was of H.
and yet good, for as it seems the Village and Parish shall be intended all one,
and the Parish shall not be intended to comprehend more Villages.

Obligatition.
Debt upon an Obligation, and shows the breaking of the Condition, because a
stranger recovered the Land at Westminster upon a good Title, where the Land
lies in Com. Berks, the Defendant said that it was by Covyn, without this, that
it was a good Title, the Plaintiff said that it was upon a good title, the
Visne shall be of the County of Berks where the issue is joined upon the good,
Title, and where the Land lies: but contrary if the issue be joined upon the
County, but it was said, if it were a personal Action it shall be where the
Recovery is alleged, Mich. 9 Iac. Ban. Regis, Hausaker versus Kirby.

cannot be but upon the Land, Mich. 9 Iac. Ban. Regis.

Debt.
Debt for 20 l. Defendant pleads that at another time, the Plaintiff sued him
in London in such a Parish and shows the Record certain, etc. and that he had

another 20 l. for the which execution was awarded absque hoc that the plaint
and the execution was for the same 20 l. yet the Visne shall be in both
parishes, because the issue is as well of the execution as of the plaint, 5.
