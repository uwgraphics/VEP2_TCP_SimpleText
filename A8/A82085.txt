A LETTER FROM Major General Lambers Quarters, at PENRITH.
SIR,
WE have intelligence now come to Major General Lambert, that the Scots are
come into England, with a considerable force, both of horse and foot, under the
command of Duke Hamilton, the time of their entering is said to be about four a
clock on Saturday morning.

Duke Hamilton himself came in person to the City of Carlisle that night, and
was entertained with great rejoicing by the Soldiery there, Ordnance were shot
off, and bells rung, and great acclamations. The Van of the Scots forces, lie
now about Wigton, some five miles west of Carlisle. When they have consulted
there with Sir Marmaduke Langdale, it will be resolved whether they will march
toward Lancashire, or, which is more likely, toward Newcastle. Duke Hambleton
marched himself in the Van of the Scots Army, with his Trumpeters before him,
all in scarlet cloaks full of silver lace, like a Prince in state. With the
Duke did march a lifeguard, of Scotch men, all very proper and well clothed,
with standards and Equipage like a Prince. There marched then all the Horse in
the Van of the Army, who were 4 Regiaments, 7 Colors in a Regiament, that is
28 Colors, and in every Regiment some 500. that is about 2000 in the said 4
Regiaments in the Van. Then marched their body of Foot, in the middle, led by
Major General Middleton The foot are 7 Regiaments, having 72 Colors, 10
Colors to a Regiament, and 12 to the Major Generals.

The foot are nigh a 1000 in a Regiament, most of the companies being complete
100 a piece, They are in all of Foot about 7000. The Foot have brought some
carriages, but the Artillery, and completing of the carriages is to be from
Carlisle, which was one great reason of the Dukes so much hasting thither, as
soon as he entered England, In the Rear of the Scots army, march another
division of Horse, with the Earl of Kallender. The number of the Horse that
march in the Rear are much about the number of those in the Van, only the
Troops are not altogether so full, but they are above 1500. Major General
Monro it is said) will join 3000 with them from Ireland, of the Scots that are
there under his command, only some few Irish that have recruited the
Regiaments.

Sir Marmaduke Langdale has about 3000 English that he can arm, and draw into
the field to join with them, So that their whole Army does consist of these
numbers, Viz. Of those already in England.

2000 Horse in the Van of the Scots Army, 1500 Horse in the Rear of the Scots,
7000 Scots Foot now in England, 3000 English Horse and Foot under Langdale,
3000 Expected from Monro in Ireland.
16500 or thereabouts, is the number of the field-Army, which they expect to
complete.

There is some speech, as if they intended to make two Armies of them, if they
prevail, thus: First, that they all joining intend to march toward Newcastle,
and if they be not impeaded, but get thither well, then the Scots are to
attempt the storming of it, and if they gain it, that they shall have the
profits thereof toward the maintenance of their Army. And that then (it is
said) Prince Charles is to march in the head of the English into the South, and
the Scots stay in the North of England.

I have sent you here enclosed the copies of some papers from Scotland that
came to my hands.

Heads of Instructions concerning a DECLARATION to be published by the
Committee for DANGER.
THe Committee of Parliament, taking into their serious consideration the
dangers imminent to the true Protestant religion to the solemn League and
Covenant, His Majesty's person, and authority, and peace of the Kingdoms, from
the prevailency of Sectaries, and their adherents, and from Papists,
Malignants, and Prelaticall party: And considering the occasion thereby given,
not only to the public Enemies of Religion, but even to any disaffected
persons at home, to labor so far as in them lies to subvert Religion and
Government, and disturb the peace of this Kingdom; and finding themselves
obliged in duty and conscience, to make speedy use of all means, for
preventing the practices of such, for preserving of the peace, and keeping of
his Majesty's subjects in a dutiful obedience to the Laws and Judicatures,
and in a Christian unity amongst themselves. They have resolved to advance an
Army into England, under the command of his Highness Duke of Hamilton, for the
better and more speedy effectuating thereof.

The Copy of a Letter from an Eminent Officer in Major General Lamberts Army.
Noble Sir,
WE have received intelligence even now that the Scots are come into England,
with a considerable Force both of Horse and Foot, under the command of Duke
Hamilton, who we hear came himself into Carlisle, on Saturday night last, and
that his forces lie now about Wigton, The best intelligence we have, says,
that they have 27 Colors of Horse in the Van, and a great body of Horse in
the Rear, which we conceive to be answerable to the former. The Foot, from
several hands, we understand are 72 Colors.
