A Common Observation upon these TIMES.
AS I about the town did walk,
I heard the People how they talk,
Of the brave Parliament.
Some praise the Lords, and some the Scots,
Some think that they have further plots,
Some blame the Government.
Cause Oxford Lords can swear and rore,
And break a Lance half broke before,
They talk of mighty Fights.
But when they come to Leshlyes hand,
He made them quickly understand,
They were but Carpet Knights.
The Caluinists may plainly see,
That all election now is free,
Yet Schismatics complain:
Though Canterbury to their Face,
Has proved a Man may fall from grace,
And never rise again.
Poor Prin and Bastwick now appears,
And Osbaston may show his Ears,
The Justice being known:
Of that high Court where plannets ruled,
Who too long had the World befoold,
With knavery of their own.
Yet some of them did keep a stir,
And said they only did concur,
With those were wiser known.
It Was Rhetorcick betrayed their ears,
And he has none Long Philip swears,
Were it to save his own.
Thom Trevor made a just complaint,
That he in Laws was ignorant,
How far they would encroach:
But Spanish Franck cannot say so,
Nor some tunns else that I do know,
Which are not yet abroach.
There is a new Lord Keeper in,
And for to pray can be no sin,
To keep his Conscience free:
And not grow greazy like his Purse,
Who had no Wife to make him worse,
As had old Coventrey,
Our Secretary knavery,
Has left his Brother Vanity,
Who is of prattle full:
And yet he could not find a speech,
For to protect the Reverend Breech,
Of Tom the great Mogull.
Some say her ioyncture made the Queen,
So often at Westminster to be seen,
Though Carlisle show her Face,
To steel the forehead of that Lord,
For whom the State proclaimed accord,
More proper then such grace.
And Heath they say might safely swear,
He never did a bribe for bear,
What ere was the condition;
When he was judge with thieves he shard,
And yet it is known that he was spard,
His son brought the Petition.
Although that Goring have a stroke,
In tavernes and the Indian smoke,
Let Dorset escape for one.
Though he approves of Venus play,
I never yet heard mortal say,
He loved the whore of Rome.
The Popes did never keep such stirs,
As his late Grace and Officers,
For every small offense.
For Venery was in their days,
Which I remember to their praise,
at most but sixteen pence.
Let Arundell be punished then,
That plagud all were not Gentlemen,
Which makes me much afraid.
That he or his Posteritee.
Will prove as poor as thee or me,
When all his debts be paid.
Our Churches now are purged clean,
From Prelates, Chapters, and the Deane,
Who long have lived like Hogs.
God gave no Warrants for such toys,
Nor can he but abhor the noise,
they made like masty Dogs.
Will the German may rejoice,
To hear that Mal that has such choice,
Does place him by her side.
Nor can the State be counted free,
Unless they set up Monarthy,
to gratify the Bride.
Here is no room for Conaway,
Nor many more that run away,
Of pardon that despair.
Nor Hopton that no charge refused
Who has already been abused,
Sufficient for his share.
I may be thought an Heritick,
Although I speak it in this fit,
I sin in that and wine.
Because I creep not to the Cope,
But hold the Bishops from the Pope,
But not by right Divine.
If that the House continues still,
To punish those that have done ill,
and these our wars do cease.
The purer sort i will celebrate,
To whom I owe both Life and State,
I say God send us peace*
FINIS.
