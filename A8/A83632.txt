AN ACT OF THE COMMONS of ENGLAND Assembled in PARLIAMENT, For the keeping a
day of Humiliation upon Thursday the 19 day of April, 1649.
Whereas this Nation has long labored under many Miseries and Judgments, as
a just fruit of our multiplied transgressions, and amongst other sins, more
especially for our unthankfulness and unfruitfulness under unparalleld mercies
and deliverances, and for our unbelief, to the dishonor of our mighty, wise,
and good God, who has through a Wilderness of Temptations brought us even to
the entrance of a Canaan, and to the hope of a blessed Reformation; as also for
our uncharitablenes and want of a good affection to the public, and of love
one to another, the very fountain of our late Civil Wars and Desolations: And
whereas we have learned from the word of God, and the example of his people in
all ages, and our own experience, That the humbling of our souls for sin, and
the seeking the favor of God in the mediation of our Lord and Savior Jesus
Christ by prayer and fasting, has been, through his grace and acceptance,
effectual both for the preventing and removal of the greatest Judgments, and
also for procuring the choycest Mercies: The Commons of England assembled in
Parliament, having through the wonderful goodness and assistance of God,
restored this Nation (as far as in them lies, and the present interruptions
will yet admit) to their just Liberties, and laid Foundations for the well
Government thereof in the way of a Commonwealth, Do Enact and Ordain, and be it
Enacted and Ordained by this present Parliament, and by Authority thereof, That
Thursday the 19 day of April, 1649. shall be observed and kept in all Parishes
and other places in England and Wales, a solemn day of Fasting, Prayer, and
Humiliation, for the aforementioned sins, and all other the abominations
whereof this Nation is guilty; and for the imploring of the Lord our God, (who
is Holiness, Love, and Wisdom, and the Father of Spirits) to give unto this
people the Spirit of Reformation, Faith, Understanding, and Union, That so our
sins, the cause of our sufferings, may be forgiven, and this Commonwealth may
be settled in a lasting Peace and Happiness: And be it further Enacted and
Ordained, That all Ministers, and other people within England and Wales, do
with all possible care and pious diligence, solemnly observe the same
accordingly, under the penalties contained in any Order or Ordinance of
Parliament heretofore made, concerning the due observation of the Lord's Day, or
days of public Humiliation.

Die Sabbathi, 17 Martii, 1648.
ORdered by the Commons assembled in Parliament, That this Act be forthwith
printed and published; and that the Members of this House be required to take
care to disperse the same in the several Counties.
