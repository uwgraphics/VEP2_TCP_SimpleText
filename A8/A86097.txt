A True Copy of a Letter from the Right Honorable Lady, the Lady ELIZABETH
HATTON, left at the remove of her Honors Household from Stoke near Windsor
(upon hearing of Prince Ruperts approach toward those Parts) to be delivered
to his EXCELLENCY.
SIR,
THe great Honor and comfort I (though unworthy) have had in the knowledge and
favor of that most Excellent Princess the Queen your Mother, made me often
joy in my constant resolution to serve her Majesty and all hers, by the best
ways and means in my power; and therefore must be infinitely, or most
heartily sorry to fly from this dwelling, even when I hear Your Excellency is
coming so near it, which howsoever, with all in or about it, is most
willingly exposed to your pleasure, and Accommodation in particular, as it must
also ever be commanded by his Majesty. But Sir, let me humbly offer what my Age
and experience of others wisdom and observation has offorded my
understanding; which concludes, that the Parliament is the only firm
foundation of the greatest establishment, the King, his Posterity, or Allies,
can wish and attain; the defense or conservation whereof, is no way to be
effected but by its own Body. And therefore if you should persist in the
unhappiness to support any advice to break the Parliament upon any pretense
whatsoever; you shall concur to destroy the best groundwork for his
Majesty's prosperity; whereon there is so great dependence as makes my
apprehension withdraw my pen from your farther trouble, that gains me leave to
rest

Excellent Sir, A true Beades-woman for his Majesty's best prosperity: And your
most humble Servant, ELIZABETH HATTON.
Stoke the 24th. of October, 1642.
