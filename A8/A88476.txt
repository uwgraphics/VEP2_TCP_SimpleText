House of Commons, it is declared, That the Parliaments Army in the Northern
parts are in a sad and distressed condition for want of Food and other
necessaries; And that a present supply must of necessity be made: and to that
purpose it is desired that Twenty thousand pounds should be forthwith advanced
by the City, out of the Arrears of the several Assessements made within this

And for the better getting in of the said Arrears, it is required by the said
Orders, that the Common Council do forthwith send and certify to the said
Committee, the Names of such persons that have not paid their said
Assessements, and the sums they are in Arrear, to be by the said Committee
reported to the said House of Commons. Upon the reading of which Orders,
Letter, and several other relations made by the said Committee concerning the
great necessity of the said Army and Northern parts; the Common council have
declared their sensibleness of the Premises, and their desire to answer the
expectation of the said Committee, in effecting to their power what is desired,
as a thing of great consequence to the City and Kingdom; And in pursuance of an
Order of the Common Council thereupon made; And for the prevention of further
inconveniences that may ensue; These are to will and require you, that
presently upon sight hereof, you call the several Collectors within your Ward
before you; And that the said Collectors, with some of your selves, do on
Thursday and Friday next use your best diligence and endeavors for the
Collecting and getting in of the said Arrears; and acquaint the several
persons that are to pay the same, that the Names of all that do not now pay
their Arrears are to be certified as aforesaid; And that they may expect that
further trouble and dangers will fall upon them for their neglect therein. And
further, that you or some of you do examine the said Collectors accounts, and

the Orphans Court, of your doings and proceedings therein; and also a List of
the names of all such persons within your Ward, as shall be found to be in
Arrears for the said Assessements, and the sums by them owing, and the
reasons by them given, why they refuse to pay the same, under the hands of the
respective Collectors, with your opinions therein: And if you find any of the
Collectors or others, remiss or careless in the performance of their duties,
in any thing herein required, or that might conduce to the furtherance of the
work, that then you also certify to the said grand Committee at the time
aforesaid, the names of him or them so neglecting or refusing to perform their
duties concerning the same, that they may be also certified to the said
Committee of Parliament, and otherwise proceeded against, as the neglect of
such a weighty business shall deserve. And herein I require you to use all
