Some special PASSAGES FROM Warwickshire.
Mr. John Gibbes,
IT is here in Warwicke-Shire, we are like to fall into great calamities and
distresses, if the Lord above do not hold his holy hand over us; For you know
that the Lord Brook was made Lord Lieutenant for Warwickshire, in my Lord
Comptons place. Now any Lord Brook being chose by the Parliament, and n^^ by
the King, My LORD Compton and my Lord Brook are in great variance, for the
Kings Majest^ has given Warwick Castle unto the Lord Compton; Whereupon my
Lord Brook has placed four great pieces of Ordnance in the Castle, one of
them is placed upon the round Tower, the other is placed at the Gate, the other
at Caesar's Tower, and the other over the Gate.

Likewise my Lord Brook sent his warrants abroad in two or three hundreds of
the Shire to gather the Train band together at Stradford upon Avon, and as
many Volunteeres as every Constable could raise. So there were aimed to be very
near two thousand of Volunteeres of Horsemen, and Foot men. I was there my
self, I see it, but there were but very few train men would come in, because
my Lord Brooks warrants did not give the Country satisfaction, for his
warrants run in the name of the Parliament, and not one word of the King: So
my Lord Brook took distaste at the Constables, because they would not obey
his first warrants, and then he made a new Proclamation that his warrants
should go in the Kings Majesty's name and the Parliaments, together and those
Const^bles that did not bring in their ^^aine Soldiers unto Stradford, he
commanded them in his Proclamation that they should bring them unto Sutton
Cofild, where there was a great meeting, the next Monday following, and so they
did, and my Lord Brook spoke in his Proclamation that he was, (and had took
his oath) appointed by the Parliament to fetch away the Magazine from Coventry,
which my LORD Compton had laid there for the good of the Country and so within
one day after he had been at Stradford, my Lord Brook went unto Coventry unto
the Major to demand the Magazin, he delivered it unto him, he brought it unto
Warwick Castle with him, and there it is. It was two great Cart loades, and a
Wagon loaded with Gunpowder bullets and match, now my Lord Compton within
four or five days after (with threescore horsemen, with Hats and Feathers)
went unto Coventry to know of the Major the reason why he had delivered the
Magazine unto the Lord Brook his answer was thus because he showed his
Commission from the Parliament; So the Major told my Lord Compton that the City
would lay in as much of their own proper Cost and charges as my Lord Brook
took away, and so my Lord Compton was content with that promise: now my Lord
Brook he is in great fears that my Lord Compton will come and cease upon the
Castle, for the last Monday, my Lord Brook did raise up three hundred men all
with their muskets and swords to keep the Castle, he thinking my Lord Compton
would come with his forces then, but he did not, so our men came all home
again; for he had a great company out of our Town of Alcester and from
Stradford and from Brummy chum side, and all the Country over, now my Lord
Brook sent one of his chief men that he keeps, unto Master Bridges of our
town which is my Lords chief Steward, to certify Master Bridges that he
would come unto dinner unto him, so there was greater providing for my Lords
coming and about ten of the Clock in the morning my Lords Post came unto
Master Bridges to tell his LORD could not come at that time. But wished him to
send him as many lusty men as the Town could spare and to bring their Arms
with them: So the Constables went about the Town to get as many as they could
so upon Thursday night the Bayliffes and Constables sent half a score, and all
that go, my Lord has promised them five shillings a week, and their beer
and their lodgings, so upon Friday night last, my Lord sent another Post unto
the Town for more men and so there went four more, and now this day there are
more men to go out of our Town of Alcester, there was a hundred brave men
went from Brummichum unto War-wicke Castle upon Saturday with their Arms of
Muskets and Swords; and a hundred more went from Stradford, Henly, and Cosill
unto the Castle this last Sunday, for the King came unto Lecester upon Saturday
last with his troop to demand the Magazine and the Arms of the Town, so the
Major denied, and told the King that it should be kept for the good of his
Majesty, and for the Parliaments good. I could tell you more, but I have not
time, but in the next place I will tell you how the King is to come unto
War-wicke as this day, or to morrow with my Lord Comptons forces to demand the
Magazine, which my Lord Brook fetched from Coventry, and upon Friday next my
Lord Compton meeres at Stradford, he has sent out warrants already to the high
Constables, that all other Constables meet there to hear his Proclamation,
concerning the settling of the Commission of Array for the which my Lord Brook
will oppose, he says, if he lose his own heart blood, for he is a sworn man
unto the Parliament, and he will oppose it, and then it is supposed and
thought that the King comes unto our Town to demand the arms here, but they
will not be delivered, but yet nevertheless the Town will be for the King in
a fair way as long as they live, and so the King, it is supposed will go unto
Worcester, from thence unto Ragnole Castle in Wales, where the Earl of
Worcester dwells, and now I have writ so largely unto you how matters go
with us, I would entreat you either in print or in writing, to send unto your
friend what news you have in London, for here is nothing but providing of
arms. The Lord Compton went last Friday with three hundred Horsemen to meet
the King, now there is such providing in Warwick Castle for the Kings coming
the like has not been this many years, to receave him Royally, if he come
in peace, if otherwise, I am afraid we shall have a woeful time of it and so
God of his mercy think upon us, I commit you unto God.

This which I have written is very true.

Samburne Your friend, Thomas Iohnsons.

FINIS.
