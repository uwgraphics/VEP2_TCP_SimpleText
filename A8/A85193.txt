A Warning to England In GENERAL.
And the Cities of LONDON and BRISTOLL in PARTICULAR.
The 11th. of the 10th. Month, 1693.
IT came upon me to write as follows. Oh! Nation of England, and City of
London, how often have you been warned, and called to Repentance, yet how slow
have your Inhabitants been in answering the Lord by Humiliation and unfeigned
Repentance. I am truly concerned for thee, Oh City of London! lest thou have
given the Lord cause to complain against thee, and upbraid thee as he did
Corazin and Bethsaida; for the Lord does not send his Judgments without great
Provocation; therefore think not Repentance to be a hard thing for thee, for
God wills not the Destruction of any, but their Destruction is of themselves. I
pray God, O Nation of England, thou might be prevailed with to turn to God,
and he will turn to thee, and instead of Ashes thou shall have Beauty, and
instead of Mourning, Joy, and for Heaviness, a Garment of Praises: And thy
People shall be called Trees of Righteousness.

And now Oh City of Bristoll! What have thou to say for thy self, when the Lord
makes Inquisition for Blood and Persecution, that has been in thee: Have thou
made thy Peace with the Lord, or have thou sought thy Peace with the great good
God. To thee this is the Word of the Lord, If thou be willing to come out of
the Pool or Puddle of Sin and Transgression, a Pool of Water (or Desolation)
thou shall not be. The Mouth of the Lord has spoken it. Oh City of Bristoll, I
am truly concerned for thee, that thou might shine with the Beauty of Holiness,
to the Praise and Glory of the great God.

This from him that desires the good of the whole Creation, and is seeking the
good of all People,

Known by the Name of Leonard Fell.
