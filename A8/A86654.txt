THE VISITATION OF THE Rebellious Nation OF IRELAND.
ALas, alas, woe is me for thee thou desolate Nation of Ireland, thou art to be
pitied, and lamented, because of thy backslidings, and rebellion against the
Lord, thou abounds in iniquity, and thy transgressions cannot be numbered. O
thou art a fruitless habitation, and barren of righteousness, and mercy, and
true judgment; even from the head to the tail, thou art corrupted, and thy
wickedness is marked before the Lord: thy Rulers, and Teachers, and people,
are all gone out of the way, and are disobedient children, having backslided
from the pure ways of the Lord God, a deceitful heart is found among them,
and a lie is in their hand; even the best of men are as a bryar, and the most
upright among men sharper then a thorn hedge; a cursed seed has taken root in
thee, and fruit of a cursed taste is abundantly sprung forth; thou art turned
into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto God, and are become abominable
in his eye; thy vines brings forth a sour grape, and the Lords soul has no
delight therein; thou art altogether untilled, and thy flowers gives an ill
smell; thy inhabitants have set themselves to do wickedness, they imagine
mischief upon their beds and brings it forth in the morning, cruelty is their
weapon against the innocent, and hard heartedness is their defense against the
upright.

Woe is me for thee thou desolate Nation, who has rejected the counsel of the
Lord, and neglected the day of thy Visitation, wherein the Lord would have
gathered thee, but thou would not; How often has the Lord spoken unto thee,
and thou will not hear his call? By judgment has he spoken, and by mercy has
he drawn, but thou refusest to return, and wilt not be reclaimed, but
continues in thy Rebellion against the Lord, and forgets the work of his hand,
in ages and generations past; even since the beginning have thou been a Land of
wickedness, and a people of a cursed seed, drinking up iniquity as an Ox that
drinks up water, and filled up the measure of Transgression, till the Lord was
forced in grievous judgments to deal with thee, even his wrath in a day broke
forth upon thee, and the fire of indignation was kindled in thee, and thy
Princes were cut off in fury, and thy inhabitants fell by the plague and sword
in great numbers, and thou was given up to be a prey to thy enemies in thy
treasures, and the cruel hearted took the spoil, thou wast laid level in the
dust of deep misery and confusion, and thy lamentation and sorrow was heard
among the Nations, and the stroke of the Lords hand was heavy upon thee, and
his judgments was just upon thy head, and he gave no rest unto thee for many
years, but thou wast as a trembling leaf and as a forsaken bough, and thou
wast made desolate and comfortless, and misery girded thee about, and then thy
stout heart was brought down into sorrow when the Lord contended with thee; but
now thou have ease from thy bitterness, and a day of rest from thy sore
trouble, yet have thou forgotten the day of thy distress, and art again more
abundantly exalted, and thy sins are much more increased, the pride of thy
heart is become equal with Sodom, and thy transgressions are increased to her
number and thy rebellion against the Lord is grown more high, and through
mercies and deliverance art thou waxen fat, and now thou kicks against the
Lord, and in thy heart says, Who is he?

O when will thou consider, what the Lord has wrought? when will thou call to
mind his just and righteous dealing? who have forgotten the day of thy former
visitation, and is becoming more vile in the sight of the Lord, by thy secret
hypocrisy of deceitful profession, then thou wast in thy open profaneness,
when thou layest naked in thy open sins.

O Desolate Nation, the Lord once and again has stretched forth his hands
unto thee, in pity for thee, and he sent his servants and witnesses to warn
thee of these thy transgressions, and to call upon thee to awake thee out of
thy carelessness, and he gave thee a glorious day of visitation, and free
tenders of salvation, wherein thou might have made thy peace with him, and
repent thee of thy sin; And his servants were faithful in thee, and lamented
over thee, and gave themselves to be spent for thee, and gladly suffered the
reproach of the heathen, and the cruelty of the wicked, that thereby thou
might be reclaimed out of thy Rebellion and wickedness, and they gave their
back to the smiter, and loved not their life unto death, nor prized not their
liberty unto bonds, but diligently in sufferings, and labors, and
perplexities, called unto thee, and through thy Towns and Cities proclaimed
the visitation and message of the Lord concerning thee, and was accounted as
sheep for the slaughter, that they might finish their Testimony to the
gathering of thee, but thou would not, but have to this very day stopped thy
ear from counsel, and hardened thy heart against reproof, and contemned the
day of thy visitation, and hereby added to thy measure of wickedness in
dealing cruelly with the Lords servants, who rewarded them evil for good, and
entreated them shamefully, and laid thy hand of oppression upon them, and
rejected their message of glad tidings, and would not be instructed in the way
of the Lord unto salvation, but gave heed unto the false visions of thy lying
Prophets, and took counsel against the Lord of thy Inchanters, and persecuted
the faithful by unjust Imprisonments, and dealt wickedly with the Lords
chosen, and made unrighteous decrees in thy wrath, and sealed them in thy
cruelty, and made a purpose in thy heart to root out the Seed of Jacob, and to
lay wast the Lords Heritage.

O Ireland, hereby in the Name of the Lord (thus far) I seal my Testimony in
faithfulness unto thee, and binds up my many burdens, and travells, and
reproaches, and Trials, and sufferings in thee, in a few words, which is the
word of the Lord concerning thee.

Ye Heads, and Rulers, that sits upon the Throne, Repent, and turn to the
Lord, from whom you are grievously revolted by woeful backslidings, a grievous
sin have you committed, a gross sum of heinous abomination is recorded against
you, the righteous God will meet you in his judgments, and once more will
appear in the fire of Indignation against you, and your mountains of pride, and
vainglory, and selfe-exaltation, shall be laid wast, as your enemies were
before you, and as you have thought to do (to root out the Seed of Jacob, and
to spoil the tender grapes of the Lords vintage) even so shall it be done unto
you, and your destruction comes as an armed man, and you cannot escape, nor
fly to hide your selves, from the wrath that comes, which is kindled already
to devour the pleasant Palaces of your wicked hearts delight.

Woe is me for you; you that are exalted upon your mountain of ease and
liberty, having forgotten the rock from whence you are hewn, who were raised
out of weakness to reprove the mighty, and gives not glory to the Lord,
neither considers what he has done for you, but are become ungrateful, and
disobedient children, and of a double heart and tongue, professing liberty of
the pure conscience, but living in corrupt fleshly bondage, oppressing the
just, and slaying the holy One, and neglecting the cry of the innocent, having
made your fingers as heavy as your Fathers loins; the hand of the Lord is
against you, and his wrath will break out upon you, who strengthens the hand of
evil doers, and gives liberty in your dominions, unto the scum of the Nations,
to possess your Land in peace, and will not give place unto the Seed of Jacob,
but fortifies your selves against him, and will not suffer him to inherit; how
full is your Land of murderers, of drunkards, of liars, and swearers, and of
profane persons, of sugitives, and vagabonds, and runnagades, who is protected
by your Law, to possess in peace? but in wrath have you turned your sword
against the upright, and have made Laws to limit the Spirit of the Lord, and
to uphold deceit.

Therefore Repent of this your sin, who has endeavored to prevent the Lord;
and humble your selves ye lofty, for the purpose of your hearts are broken, and
a scattered Seed remains in your Dominions, which the Lord will bless, and
which you cannot be able to suppress, and as pricks in your eyes will it stand
a witness against you in your hypocrisy, and cruelty, and the more ye lay
yokes upon it, the more it will spring forth.

Therefore be wise ye Rulers, and Judges, and leave to imagine mischief, and
lay your hands upon your mouths, and open them not any more, and turn in your
minds to the light of Christ Jesus, wherewith you are enlightened, and it will
let you see what you have done, and will set your sins in order before your
eyes, and will justly reprove you, who have not done, as you would be done
unto, but have cast the Law of God behind your backs, and not regarded the call
of equity, and if you love the light of Christ it will change your minds, and
will bring you to Repentance from sin unto God, and from the Dominion of ^a^an
unto the Kingdom of Christ Jesus; the light is your Teacher if you love it,
and will guide you in the ways of God, but if you go on in your wickedness,
it is your condemnation eternally, and shall seal to the justness of the
judgments of God when they come upon you; now you have time and a fair
warning, prize the day of your visitation before the decree of vengeance be
sealed against you, and repentance be hid from your eyes, lay it to heart, you
are but men and not God, and your strength flesh and not spirit; if you own the
light it will manifest the will and counsel of the Lord unto you, and give you
power to act righteousness unto God, wherein you will be accepted; Consider,
least you go down to destruction, and there be none to deliver you.

ANd unto all you that do profess the name of the Lord, and have got the
form of the Saints worship in your imaginations, and have separated your
selves into an outward conformity, without the power of righteousness brought
forth in you, and would be called members of the Church of all sects and sorts;
Repent ye, of your hypocrisy, and stop your mouths in the dust, for you are
weighed in an equal balance, and are found wanting; and are tried by the
searcher of hearts, the light of the world, and are found corrupted; deceitful
are you in the root, and cursed in your branch, of deep and secret hypocrisy,
pride and coveteousnesse, and the love and glory of the world, and fleshly
exaltation abounds among you, as branches of the root wherein you grow; and how
can you bring forth good fruit out of your cursed ground? your knowledge is
brutish and vain, and your outward conformity is a weariness to the Lord;
for you are found fighters against him, and opposers of Christ Jesus, and
denyers and contemners of his light, by which he has lightened every man that
comes into the world; you stumble at the foundation and builds upon the sand,
one of you building a wall, and another daubing it with untempred mortar; your
hearts are not upright with the Lord, but flatters your own souls; which of
you has denied the world for Christ, or what have you laid down for him? in
your vain imaginations you worship God ignorantly, making his Commandments
void through your transgressions.

You stand in the cursed Nature, alive to the world, following the vain
delights thereof, resisting the way of the Lord, through your wisdom, which is
foolishinesse with God, you have the profession of the Scriptures in your
natural knowledge, but you are without the life thereof; out of the unity of
the one spirit of life in several meanings, and opinions, which is death; and
in vain conceits are you scattered upon the barren mountains, where your
souls are starved, and strayed, in the cloudy and dark day; and you are
devoured under your dumb Idol Shepherds, who are in Cains way of wickedness,
and in the steps of all the false Prophets, and of the Scribes and Pharisees,
fulfilling their measure of wickedness and persecution, against them is the
wrath of God kindled to consume them as stubble; they preach for hire, and they
divine for money, and they seek for their gain from their quarter, and they
run, and was never sent, and you are not profited by them, but are ever
learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.

Awake ye Professors, God calls unto you, give ear unto his voice, Come out of
Babylon and turn unto Sion, that her desolate places may be builded, you
wander abroad in the darkness, groping as blind men, your profession will
wither, and all your knowledge will consume away, and your righteousness is
abomnation to the Lord, your praying God hates, and your oblations is a
weariness to him, for you are in the enmity against God, and the Serpents head
is not bruised.

Come down ye Cedars, who are exalted above the Cross of Christ, and make not
a cloak of the Saints words to cover your unrighteousness; grievous is your
Idolatry, who have painted your selves with the likeness of the Saints life,
and bows to the Image set up in your imaginations, drawing near God with your
mouths, but with your hearts going after your coveteousnesse: Repent, the day
of the Lord is coming upon all flesh, and meet the Lord, and prepare his way;
and bow your heads you lofty Oaks, who says in your hearts you are the only
people, but your lying hearts deceives you, and you are found naked and without
a covering.

All ye that desire after the way of the Lord, of all sorts of people who are
simple and honest hearted, whether profane or professor, you have a day of
visitation from the Lord, yet stretched forth unto you, Come ye unto the Lord,
and forsake all your lovers, lay aside your evil hearts which has led you
aside from the way of salvation, and now learn the fear of the Lord, which is
the beginning of wisdom, and mind the one thing needful, which is of great
prize, even the salvation of your souls, press after, and come out of the
broad way of perdition, wherein the world goes on to destruction, and enter
into the straight way, where the unclean walks not; cease from all the
deceitful ways and worships of the world, and love truth, and walk in
simplicity.

Cease from all your Idol Temples, for God dwells not in them, but his Saints
are his Temples, wherein he dwells and walks: cease from all your Idol
worships, and feigned prayers, and praises, for God is not worshipped in vain
traditions, as in observing days, and times, and outward things, but in Spirit
and truth is he worshipped, and such he seeks to worship him, and a broken
spirit and an upright heart is accepted with him. Cease from all your Idol
Shepherds, and Priests of Baal, that preaches for hire, and divines for money,
and seeks for their gain from their quarter, for they profit not the people at
all, who are ever learning while they live upon earth, and none able to come to
the knowledge of the truth: therefore cease from man, and wait upon the Lord,
who is now risen to teach his people by his Spirit in his way of truth and
righteousness, in his peace and purity, where his blessing is received from
his presence, which is with all that fear him.

Therefore awake, awake, out of darkness, and love not to slumber in the dark
night, which long has ruled over you; this is the day of your return, and of
your visitation, wherein the Lord would gather you; Therefore resist not the
love of the Lord, wherein he calls you to repentance from dead works to serve
him in righteousness; but every one turn your minds inward to the light of
Christ Jesus, wherewith every one of you is lightened, which light is it which
convinces you of sin, and lets you see your evil deeds, and whom you have
served, and how you have spent your time; the light shines in darkness, and
reveals unto you the secret intents of your dark hearts, and does secretly
reprove the wicked purposes of your minds: with this light in your consciences,
your sins are written, and all that ever you have done is recorded; and this
light shall be the swift witness, of the condemnation of the wicked, in the
day of the Lord; and by it all your works will be brought to remembrance, and
your sins will be set in order before you, to receive judgment by Christ
Jesus: And here is the free love and gift of God unto you, who has given you a
light to guide you in his way; if you own it, and wait in it, it will manifest
the judgments of God against sin in you, and will condemn sin in your flesh,
and will reveal the righteousness of God to be your covering; if you dwell in
the light, it is your teacher, and way unto life eternal, and if you bring all
your deeds to it, it will reprove every evil word and work, and give you
discerning of things that differ it will manifest the secretest deceit of your
hearts, and the windings of the Serpent, and will be judge thereof, till
unrighteousness be taken away, and a birth brought forth from above, and born
of another nature and seed, which if you be not born again, you cannot enter
into the Kingdom of God.

Therefore in the fear of the Lord all consider, and search your selves, in
tender love to all your souls I write: You must be judged in the flesh, that
you may be justified in the Spirit, and you must be made poor, and emptied of
all your knowledge, and wisdom, that you may be filled and made truly wise. So
if you believe in Christ Jesus the light, and life, of the world, your hearts
will be cleansed by the word of God, which endures for ever; and the Covenant
of peace will be established with you, where sin is no more remembered, being
condemned, so now you have all time, this is to you all a warning, as I was
moved of the Lord.

Repent, the dreadful day is at hand, and meet the Lord, by confessing and
forsaking your sins, and prepare the way of the Lord, his coming draws near,
least his judgments come upon you unawares, and his wrath sweep you away in
fury, and your Nation become more cursed then the rest: All your applying of
Christ's righteousness, while your selves are sinners, is to no purpose, for no
hypocrite can enter into life, nor none that works wickedness, has eternal
life abiding in them, but are in the death, which has passed over all men, and
the curse remains upon the disobedient, and all in the first nature are
children of wrath.

Therefore every one wait in the light, that you may be changed, and take up
the daily Cross of Christ, that your own wills, affections, lusts, and
desires, may be crucified, and you may become dead to the world, and may live
unto God, in his nature and likeness, that your souls may be satisfied
therewith; and all that hunger and thirst after righteousness, shall be filled
with the true food.

Therefore wait, all you that fear the Lord, and meet together in his counsel,
and wait for his Law that you may walk therein, and lay aside the works of
darkness, which are made manifest by the light, and also condemned, in all
that come to Sion. Spend not your time in the vain deceits of the world, nor
follow not the delights thereof, for according to your works must you be judged
in the day of the Lord. Depart from iniquity, and all the works of the flesh,
pride, and coveteousnesse, lying, swearing, and double-dealing, and all the
fruits of unrighteousness, let them be judged, and let the time past be
sufficient that you have wrought evil, and now return, and work
righteousness in God, by the light, which all that lovees, works in God.

And deceive not your selves, with a deceitful covering, of self making, and
self righteousness, professing the Scriptures in your carnal minds, which
was given forth by the Spirit, and is not understood, but by the same Spirit;
while the first nature stands alive in you, you cannot please God, but is in
the enmity against him: humble your selves, and come down to the light* and
search your hearts thereby.

Woe unto the lofty, and high minded, who will not be instructed, but hates
reproof. Woe is unto all liars, and swearers, and whoremongers, and vagabonds,
and profane persons* such cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor enter to
within the gates of the City, but are to be trodden in the winepresse of the
wrath of God for ever and ever.

Therefore awake, awake, ye careless and unbelieving, and fear and tremble ye
children of disobedience, who hates the light, and loves your evil deeds, and
upholds your false Prophets, whom God never sent, and will not own the Lord to
be your teacher, the light in your conscience is your condemnation, for this is
the condemnation of the world, that light is come, and men hates it.

So be you warned all people, the day of the Lord is at hand, and now he calls,
therefore hear his voice, and hearken to his light, which is of Christ, which
only is needful to salvation; and there is no other name given for salvation.
And if you will not hear and receive this day of visitation, which in love
appears unto you, you shall hear in the day of visitation of vengeance; and
behold the Lord comes quickly, make straight his paths; the light is your
teacher if you love it; and your condemnation if you have it.

Written from London, to go abroad in the Nation of Ireland, as a visitation to
all sorts of people, and is the sealing of the Lords testimony unto that land,
as moved of the Lord, in love, and pity, to lost souls, by Edw: Borough.

A Warning to the Heads, and Rulers, and people of Dublin.
HEar the word of the Lord oh ye Inhabitants of the City of Dublin, ye Rulers,
and Magistrates, Governors, Colonels, Captains, and Soldiers, and all ye
people of the City, and ye Inhabitants of the Land of Ireland, my word is to
you all, says the Lord.

Oh thou City of Dublin, in the day of thy calamity, when sorrow, fear, pain
and tribulation was upon thee, when thou was compassed about with adversaries,
who cried ah, ha! we will make thee as a plain, and as a wilderness, as we
have done the rest of the Nation: And they said in their hearts none should be
able to deliver you out of their hands, but said, we will cut off and destroy
at once, that our selves may be exalted; I the Lord who changes not, was as a
fortress, and as a bulwark about thee, and made thy heart courageous against
them, and delivered thee out of their hands, even from a people whose hands was
full of blood, and whose mercies were cruelty, and whose hearts were hardened
against me, and had sold themselves to work evil in my sight, and counted it
their glory to despise my name, and to abhor all righteousness in their
hearts: And in that day when they opened their mouths wide, as a Leviathan, to
swallow thee up, and make thee a heap of stones, and a desolation; Then I made
thy walls as iron, and thy gates as brass, and thy batteries strong, and
guarded thee, and compassed thee about with my strength, and I made thy face as
an Adamant against them, and delivered thee by my outstretched arm, and by my
power, out of their hands, and brake the teeth of thy enemies, and put a hook
in their jaws, and brake them before thee as a potters vessel, and powered out
my indignation against them as a flood, and my wrath as a stream swept them all
away, and I gave their carkases to fall by the sword, and for the fowls of the
air to feed upon, and has made them perish in my wrath, and cut them off in
my sore displeasure, and made their names stink in the Nations, and their
Princes are cast out as a withered branch, and are perished with the
uncircumcised, and their glory and renown is turned into reproach and
everlasting infamy, and are rotten and become as dung and as mire to tread upon
in the streets. Therefore thus says the Lord unto thee oh Dublin, and to thy
Inhabitants O Nation of Ireland, take heed and beware least thou be lifted up
in thy heart, and say, my hand has done all this, but give glory and honor to
me, says the Lord, who am the God of the living, who dwells in the light; and
now beware that the same root of bitterness spring not up in thee, as did in
them whom I cast out before you.

And oh you Rulers and Heads of the people, I have sent to try you, and this I
require of you, Do justice, love righteousness, and ease the oppressed, and
take heed of seeking your selves, and your own honor, and glory, and renown in
the earth, nor Lord it not over your brethren, who have born a part of your
suffering, and the Nations, in the heat of the day: Lift not up your selves as
the Gentile Lords whom I cast out, who exercised dominion one over another, and
did grind the face of their brethren, and made them as slaves, and entreated
them shamefully; and because of this I cast them out, and has given their
dominion to others, and their houses and lands you possess, which you builded
nor planted not. Now therefore take heed unto your selves, and be of a perfect
heart before me; For my righteousnosse is to be revealed in the earth, and now
I am about to declare my name, and my power and my glory will I reveal in the
earth, and will pour out my Spirit upon my sons and my daughters, whom I have,
and will send abroad to publish my name, and declare my counsel to the ends of
the earth, that the Nation may know me, whom for many generations they have
worshipped ignorantly. Therefore be ye all warned, stint not me, (...) not me
the holy one of Israel, says the Lord, by your power, nor make no Law against
me so as to think in your hearts to make me subject to any creatures will, for
I am the Lord who works, and who shall hinder? and will bring my purpose to
pass and none shall let; therefore I say unto you, limit not me, how, where,
by whom, and when I must speak, for I have chosen the weak things to confound
the wife, the mighty, and the honorable: and now I will be no longer flattered
with words, but he that is of an upright heart will I honor, and he that seeks
himself will I abase; therefore now while you have time prize it, and neglect
not the day of your visitation.

And oh you Rulers, uphold not these by a Law whom I have made the people of my
curse, who have devoured Gods heritage, and have flattered the Nations, and
their Princes, and their Rulers, and have sought themselves, every one seeking
for his gain from his quarter, for with them, above all, my controversy is
against, and my wrath shall be accomplished upon them, for they have caused my
people to err, and they that said they have spoken in my name know me not,
therefore my people is lost because there has been no vision among them: But
now says the Lord, a stem is sprung up, and the star of Jacob shall arise, and
the earth shall be filled with light, and my righteousness shall flow as a
stream; and my glory have I, and will I to my servants reveal, who have denied
and do deny themselves and follow me, unto them is my will revealed.

Therefore hearken oh ye people, and give ear thou Nation of Ireland, and all
your people from highest to the lowest, thus says the Lord, Though thou be
parched, and thy skin peeled off thee, and become as a wilderness, and as a
reproach, and as a lamentation for all that pass by; thy walls I will build,
and thy breaches which is as the Sea will I make up, and thou shall be no more
a proverb, nor a reproach, nor a hissing to the Nations, and to all that pass
by; for because of unrighteousness the Land said I wast, and gave it to the
spoiler; so now if thou will hearken unto me, I will repsenish thee again, and
the remnant that I have spared shall be blessed* Therefore all ye people give
ear, and take need of lying swearing, cursing, drunkenness, coveteousnesse
whoredom, drunkenness, hypocrisy, dissimulation, and worshipping strange Gods,
for those and many more abominations that was committed among the people, I
cast them out, and made them a reproach, and executed my wrath upon them.
Therefore fear me, who am near, who inhabites eternity, and dwells in the
light; I am near, says the Lord, and my light is revealed in your consciences,
and there mind my light which convinces and shows you every one your sins, and
love it, and bring all your deeds to be tried by it, and there you will see me
revealed in righteousness, to all you that wait upon me, and keep your selves
from the pollution of the heathen, and so the way of righteousness you will
know as you hearken unto me, says the Lord, who dwells in the light, which is
the life of men, and searches the hearts of the sons of men by the light.
Therefore unto the light take heed, this is present with you, in which God
manifests himself, here is all your teacher loving it, here is your
condemnation, hating it, as Christ says who is the light. So all people of the
Nation, I have cleared my conscience unto you, as I was moved of the
everlasting God; And so be you all warned, least the same thing come upon you
as did upon them whom I cast out and trod under foot, says the Lord.

Dub. 16 of the 6 Month, 1655. A lover of your souls, and one that has borne
with you in suffering, and shall rejoice with you as you own the Lord, who has
visited you, called after the flesh, Francis Howgill.

An Information to the Heads, and the ground of the Law laid down to the
Judges and Justices, and to all that handle the Law in that Nation.
ALL ye Heads, and Rulers, and Judges, and Counselors, and all you that sit
in Counsel together in the Seat of Justice and Judgment, from whom the Law
does go forth into the Nation, and all you that handle the Law take heed to
your selves, for the living God of power is judge of you and over you all, to
you all I speak the word of the Lord, without respect to any of your persons
(but is a lover and respecter of righteousness, and true judgment, and
justice) that I may stand clear of your blood, for God has laid it upon me to
give you warning, which if I do not your blood will be upon me, and if this
you refuse to hear and obey, your blood be upon your selves for ever.

Christ Jesus is the light of the world, the true light, which lightneth every
man that comes into the world, and by which every one of you is lightened, which
light, if it you love and be guided by, it will lead you out of the worlds way
and nature and unrighteousness, and will give you an entrance into eternal
life and peace, and an assurance in Christ when this world ceases to be, and in
this world it will teach you how to serve God in righteousness in your
generation, and to give righteous judgments and counsel among your brethren
without respect of persons, for the Law of God respects no man's person, nor
Justice regards not the person of the mighty; the light of Christ Jesus in all
your consciences, and in all men's consciences, is just, and one with Christ,
and one with the Law of God, in its measure, and condemns the unjust and all
works of wickedness, who against it does act; by which light every one of you
being guided, your own consciences in particular will be exercised toward God
and toward men, and by him you being ruled and judged will know how to rule
and to judge for him in the world among men, who are required for God to rule
and judge in righteousness and equity, and none can rule for God but who are
ruled by him, with his light which shines in the conscience, by which you being
governed, will by it govern in the earth righteously. You are not to judge for
gifts and rewards, for if you do you judge not for God but for your selves,
and you and your judgment is to be judged and condemned with the righteous Law
of God which is free but such who fear God and hates coveteousnesse and gifts
and rewards, are to bear rule, and such will handle the Law righteously, and
will be a terror to evil doers who does not fear God but acts contrary to the
light of Christ in their own consciences, and so transgresses the just Law, and
brings themselves under the guilt and so under condemnation, and such a
Government will stand for the praise of them that do well and encouraging of
the upright, but if such bear rule and handle the Law which know not God nor is
not ruled by him, these will abuse the Law, and will be a terror to
righteousness and good works, and will strengthen the hands of evil doers and
will let vice and wickedness escape unpunished. This I speak in love to all your
souls, to the informing of all your minds, that you may know your place and
how to exalt justice and judgment; the light of the Son of God, by which every
man is lighted, is but one in all, just, righteous, and equal, the same in him
that hates it and transgresses the righteous Law, as it is in him that loves
it, and judges all transgressions. And this light of Christ, by which all men
is lightened, is the seat of justice and of true judgment, and the ground of
all good wholesome Laws, and every Law that is contrary to it is for
condemnation by it: Therefore I say, wait in the light, by which you are
lightened, to receive the pure Law of God to judge all causes by, and make no
Law in your own wills, nor act not in such Laws made by the will of man, for
such Laws is oppression, and tyranny lodges in them, and false judgment, and
such God has and will cast out, who acted from that ground. So be ye warned by
their fall, and judge not after your own thoughts, nor sensual carnal
wisdom, nor follow not your own wills, nor the counsel of your own hearts,
but stand in Gods counsel, and fear his name, and tremble at his presence, and
wait to be guided by him in his holy Law, which all unrighteous counsels, and
vain affections, and false judgments will condemn in your own hearts, and
then you will truly know how to judge your brethren in equity and righteousness,
how to reward well doers, and how to punish evil doers according to the measure
of their transgressions, and according to the light in their own consciences,
by which they being convinced from your Law of the evil of their
transgression, will confess your Law and judgment to be just and equal, and
you to be righteous Judges; here you judge for God, and bears not the sword in
vain, but is a terror to transgressors, and to the disobedient, and lawless,
against which the Law was only added to slay unrighteousness, but it was not
made for the righteous whose consciences are exercised toward God and toward
man, by the pure Law of God written in the heart, and upon such and over such
your Law has no power, for they are one, and in union with that Law which is
righteous and does witness the justness, and goodness, and holiness of it,
but if you make a Law in your own wills, and judge by such a Law, then you will
make the innocent suffer, and oppresses them who walks in the Law of God and in
the exercise of a pure conscience, Christ was put to death by such a Law, and
the Saints in all generations was persecuted by such Laws which was made in the
will of man contrary to the will and Law of God; therefore take heed to your
selves least God hew down you and your Law together, and condemn you by his
righteous Law eternally, which Law of God needs not to be made but is made
already, and to be witnessed by the light in every man's conscience to
justification or condemnation, and is revealed in all that love righteousness.
So take heed what you do, and know your place and the length and breadth of
your Law which is committed to you, which is to keep the outward man in good
order, and the Nations in peace and truth, and from theft, and murder, and
adultery, and fighting and quarrelling, and drunkenesse, and wronging one
another, and such like; such who acts these things walks contrary to the light,
and so brings themselves under the penalty of the Law; but over the inward man
your Law which is outward has no power to bind, to limit, or to tie too or
from any way of worship in Religion, but let Religion defend it self, and lay
not your Law upon the conscience to exercise dominion over it, for it is
Christ's seat in whom he will rule, least you be found tyrants and numbered for
destruction, nor limit not the Spirit of the Lord how, when, where, and by whom
it must speak, for the holy men of God in all ages ever cried against such Laws
as was contrary to the Law of God, and did limit the Spirit of the Lord, and
against such Rulers as did judge false judgment, and for gifts and rewards,
and against such Priests and Prophets as preached for hire, and divined for
money, and sought for their gain from their quarter, and made a prey upon the
people, and through coveteousnesse made merchandise of souls; therefore be ye
warned, if such you uphold by a Law which acts those things which the Scripture
declares against, which the holy men of God gave forth by his Spirit, the
Scripture which you profess shall stand a witness against you, and the Law of
God will condemn you, and God will lay your honor in the dust, and cast you
out of the seat of Judgment, as he has done the power of the King and Bishops
before you, but judge the cause of the poor and needy, of the widow and
fatherles, and join mercy with judgment, and lay your swords upon oppression
and all tyranny and wrong dealing, that the land may be cleansed of evil
doers, and equity and righteousness may flow down, and the Nation in good
order may be kept in peace and righteousness, and so God will establish you
among his children, who are taught of him alone, and are far from oppression,
to the light of God in all your consciences I do speak which if you make Laws
contrary to it, and judge contrary to it, it is the eternal condemnation of
you, and of your Laws and judgment. And remember you are warned in your life
time, and my conscience is cleared to you, and in the day of the Lord you shall
witness me to be true, and this to be the word of the Lord to you, whether you
will hear or forbear. Written to you by a friend of righteousness and true
judgment from the Spirit of the Lord, as moved of him in love to all your
souls, to go abroad among the heads and Rulers and Judges in Dublin and else
where through the Nation of Ireland, from one who is called a Quaker by
scorners whose name in the flesh is,

Edw: Borough.
Written at Dublin the 23 of the 8 month, 1655. And now O ye Heads and Rulers,
happy had you been if you had taken the counsel of the Lord, and submitted to
have obeyed his word, which came to you as moved of him, but in that you have
neglectted, and have made Laws in your will, and exercised Lordship over the
conscience, and have limited the Lord, and have purposed to be a terror to
good, and strengthened the wicked* and have not regarded the will of God, but
have persecuted and imprisoned the innocent, and judged after your own hearts;
therefore according to the word of the Lord, your blood will be upon your own
heads, for you have not taken warning, and I am clear thereof for ever.
An Exhortation sent to the chief Commander and his Counsel, and the just
cause of the Innocent laid at their door.
WE who are servants of the Lord of Hosts, who is the Protector of heaven and
earth; we who stand in his fear, and knows his counsel, are moved of him who
lives for ever, who is, I am, and there is none besides him; to clear our
consciences, and our Lords truth, from the lies and slanders which are cast
upon us, and the good way of the Lord, which envious Spirits who are proud and
knows nothing, that cannot abide sound doctrine, does reproach and slander us,
and by false accusations lay things to our charge which we never knew;
therefore we being innocent and clear cannot but deny and bear witness against
all those proceedings, which is not according to the Law of righteousness and
equity, and lay them at your door, whom it nearly concerns.

Unto thee Henry Cromwell, who is Commander in chief for the affairs of
Ireland, and to thy Counsel we write. We have seen two several Warrants under
your hands, dated at Dublin, and in them both you say you have received
information at your board, of great disorders, and disturbances of late in the
County of Cork, and places adjacent, by Francis Howgill and Edward Borough.
This we say unto you, Your Informer has declared an untruth at your board, and
we desire that you may make it appear wherein we have made any disturbance, or
disorder, all these things in your Warrents we deny, and do charge you in the
name of the God of justice to send for them that so informed you, that have so
abused you, and are so bold and impudent, as to declare unto you any such
thing, and so has caused you to bring guilt upon your selves, in sending out
your Warrants to bring the Innocent before your judgment seat, and caused us
to be dragged a hundred miles from place to place, as malefactors, and as
though we had done some criminal act, and when we have come before you, you
had nothing to lay to our charge, but has endeavored to give sentence of
banishment of us out of your Nation, who are free born English men, and have
always been faithful and true to the Commonwealths interest from first to
last, even until now, neither have been burden some to your Nation, nor
transgressed any known Law of the Nation, and you have judged us before our
accusers come, and herein you do us great injustice, and you act contrary to
the Law of equity, and that which you your selves in your own case would not
allow; to that in all your consciences I speak. Oh that ever you should thus
requite the Lord for his love and mercy, in breaking the yoke of the oppressor
from off your necks, and now power is given into your hands to relieve the
Innocent, and to set the oppressed free, to execute judgment and
righteousness upon the transgressors, whom the Law is against: and this does
God require of you, that his will may be done, and your wills denied, that so
the Nation may be established in righteousness, and that your latter end may
be better then your beginning; but if you go on in the way you are beginning,
and turn justice backward, and let equity fall in the streets, and not suffer
judgment to enter, then misery will be your end.

Woe is me, for you have all forgotten the rock from whence you were hewn, and
the deliverances of the Lord to you in the time of distress, yea you have
forgotten, and your hearts are lifted up, and by your policy think to establish
your own wills, and to limit the holy one a way, and set up your standard by
his, and trust in the arm of flesh; what is become of the liberty of tender
consciences you have spoken of* and we have engaged with you to purchase? and
is it ended in this? Oh horrible hypocrisy! that they who bear witness
against all sin, and iniquity, and against all deceit, that they should now be
made a prey of. And we charge all in the name of the living God, in Ireland to
convince us of evil, or the transgression of any Law; and if it cannot be
done, let none lay hold on us, to abridge us of our liberty, least you bring
guilt upon your selves. And do not take counsel at them* ^or hold them up,
who are hirelings, and in the steps of the false Prophets walks, and in the
error of Balaam, who speaks for gifts and rewards, who in all generations
resisted every appearance of God in his Saints; and now would make all bow to
their Image, and they bend their tongues, and reports lies, and makes lies
their refuge, the hand of the dreadful God of Heaven and earth is against
them, yea the Lord will thunder from Heaven against them, they shall be blown
away in the whirle wind of Gods wrath, who have perverted the way of the Lord,
because they stand not in the counsel of the Lord, but slatter you, as they
have done the Princes in all generations, till all was laid wast together.

Woe is me for you, have you consulted, have you taken counsel together
against the Lord, and his servants, whom he has sent unto you, and do ye thus
requite the Lord already? Have you sent out your decree, to shut out and root
out the seed of Jacob in a day, whom the Lord has made choice of above all the
families of the earth, surely your decree will be broken, and your cords will
be but as a bulrush; for them whom you now set at naught is precious in the
eyes of the Lord, and unto our God shall you bow and worship at his seet.
Consider if there be any honesty left among you, what is become of all the
persecutors of old? what became of the Bishops, and what became of that power
that held them up, are they not all sunk as a stone into the Sea, and become a
reproach? And will you tell of reformation, and yet act in the same footsteps?
if you go on you are at the bank of destruction, and at the sides of the pit,
and you will be made as a ruinous heap, and as desolate as mount Esau* which is
a place for Dragons; was not persecution ever blind? would they ever own
themselves to be such? for verily if you knew us, you would not have done so
unto us. When Herod stretched out his hand to vex certain of the Church, the
next you hear of him he is eaten up of worms; the dread of the Lord of Hosts is
upon all the proud, and lofty, and high oaks, and the wind of the Almighty
shall blow them all down root and branch, and all your strength, in which you
trust, if you take counsel at Egypt, will become as a bowed wall, and as a
rotten hedge; and God will make them that exalts themselves against him, as a
dunghill, and as the Princes of Gog, of Mesek, and Tuball, which are all
perished among the rest of the uncircumcised. Oh ye potsheards do you think
you can limit the Lord, will he be instructed by you? he that reproves him let
him answer it* Can you command the wind that it blow not upon the earth? Can
you stop the waves of the Sea, and say unto them be still? Can you stop the
bottles of Heaven that it rain not? If you cannot, all be silent, and strive
not to resist the Lord in his own work which he is bringing to pass in this
his own day, he will confound the wisdom of the wise, and bring to naught the
honorable of the earth, and make all as a plain before him, who can withstand
him? Oh ye potsheards fear and tremble before him, who is a consuming fire to
all the ungodly, who is visiting the transgressors with vengeance dread and
fury, and putting into their hands a cup of trembling, and making Jerusalem a
burden some stone, all that meddle with it shall be wearied, they shall faint
and bow themselves, and sink under it, and be crushed as with a cart wheel to
pieces, and their names shall rot from under heaven, and all shall know our God
is the living God, yea the God of gods, yea there is none like him; and know
this, no power you had of us except it had been from above, we were with you in
the City of Dublin* near three months, some of us, and none laid hands on us,
but the time was not come, and till the testimony of the Lord was near
finished, which he sent us to do, none could lay hands on us: and know this,
though this be a time of temptation and trial, yet it shall be for the
furtherance of the Gospel of Christ; and though you think in your hearts by
sending us out of your Nation that so all will cease, and deceit will stand
without molestation; I tell you, nay, even the children who are yet in the womb
shall be brought forth and bear witness against the deceit of this generation.
And know this, there is a stump which is but little, which is bound about as
with iron and brass, and out of it shall spring fire that shall be kindled and
flame to the torment of all them who worship the Beast and have received his
mark, and to the tormenting of all the false Prophets in the Nation, and it
shall burn and none shall be able to quench it* many shall bear witness unto
us, that we came not in our own names, but in the name of the living eternal
God* who by his power has accomplished his own work, for his own glory, and
many shall bless us in the name of the Lord; and all our opposers shall gnash
their teeth, and gnaw their tongues for pain, for the torment that is coming
upon them; all that have resisted the counsel of the most high God* and have
gaine-sayed the Lord, they shall perish in their gaine-saying, and we are clear
and free from the blood of all men in this Nation thus far, yea of every City
Town and Village unto which we were moved to go, and the blood of all the rest
be upon those that have resisted us, and a good savor we are unto God in them
that have believed in his name, of whom we have borne true witness unto, and
in them that perish we are clear in the sight of God.

And oh thou City of Dublin, thou art as Moab at ease, and art lifted up in thy
heart, and rejoicing in thy spoil, and art making thy self merry in the
abundance of thy delicacies; oh how full of profaneness art thou? oh how full
of pride and vain glory, of deceit and unrighteousness, of lust and filth,
lying and swearing, and full of briars and thorns? a careless untoward people:
Oh your abominations is loathsome to all the children of light, professing God
in words, but in your lives and works denies him; oh that thou had known in
this thy day the things that belongs to thy peace, a crooked generation you
are, the yoke must be laid upon your necks, will neither plague, famine, nor
sword bring thee into subjection unto the Lord, will neither mercy nor
judgment take place in your hearts; Oh how long shall the Lord bear with you?
how long shall he spare you? his long suffering is near at an end, his patience
is near out concerning you, and then woe woe to him that shall see the day
which will come, the Lord will arise as a Lion, and will rend and tear you, and
his sword shall be bathed in the blood of his enemies, and he shall be wrath as
in the valley of Acor, and as in the days of Gibea, and will bring ye down the
mountains, and level you ye hills, and will make his name known in your
overthrow, except ye repent, and they that are round about you, when they shall
see calamity coming upon you, this shall be their Proverb, This is the City
and people that despised the counsel of the Lord, and contemned the
instruction of the most high God, and provoked the Lord to wrath, till his
patience was worn out, and his long-suffering came to an end, and therefore is
this evil come upon them. Therefore gird your selves in sackcloath, and pour
ashes upon your heads, houle and weep ye careless people, misery is coming
upon you, the dreadful God will visit with a scourge, and will make you know
he is the Lord; blessed is he that hears, and considers, and repents, and
turns from his iniquity, before the decree be sealed against you, which will
never be altered. This is the day of your visitation, and if you contemn it woe
unto you for ever, and so we are clear in Gods sight of you all from the
highest to the lowest, and your blood if you perish will the Lord require at
your own hands, from this time forth and for evermore.

Dublin 24 of the 12 Month, 1655. We are friends to all just power and are
subject to the highest power for conscience sake, but witness against all
deceit, and unrighteousnes, and against all that holds the truth in
unrighteousnes; who are prisoners of the Lord for the testimony of Christ, our
consciences bearing us witness in the Holy Ghost, Francis Howgill. Edw:
Borough.


The unjust suffering of the just declared, and their appeal to the just
witness of God in all men's consciences.
TO all ye Colonels, and Commanders, and Officers, and to all the honest
hearted in the City of Dublin, and else where, to whom this may come. Hereby we
the prisoners of the Lord for the testimony of Jesus, and for the exercise of a
pure conscience, do lay down our cause before you, and to the light of Jesus
Christ in all your consciences we appeal in this our cause of righteousness and
innocence to be judged thereby; We are men fearing God, and working
righteousness, and are friends to the Commonwealth of Israel, and are
exalters of justice and true judgment in the earth, and are subject to all
just power, and to every just ordinance of man for conscience sake, and have
suffered the loss of all, and have borne part of the burden with you, that we
might obtain the freedom of the righteous seed, and the liberty of tender
consciences, to serve the Lord in his own way, and we are well known to the
Lord, though strangers to you, and are free men in the record of heaven, though
now sufferers unjustly under your present authority, who has taken the place
of exercising Lordship over our pure consciences, and has imprisoned us, and
endeavored to give judgment of banishing us, only upon false accusations and
informations, and slanders, without the proof or testimony of any accusation
of evil justly laid to our charge. And to you hereby be it known, that not for
evil doing do we thus suffer, for to this present no man has convinced us of
any evil, nor justly proved the transgression of any Law (martial or civil)
against us, though we stand accused of many grievous things, of which we are
clearly innocent in the sight of him that lives for ever, and does nothing more
desire herein but to be tried by the Law of equity* and righteousness, and
judged according thereunto. By virtue of command given unto us, by the eternal
Spirit of the Lord came we into this Land of Ireland, contrary to the will of
man, not to seek our selves, nor our own glory, nor to prejudice your Nation
nor Government, nor to be hurtful to your Commonwealth, but with the message
of the Gospel of Christ Jesus we came to turn from darkness to light and from
the power of Satan to the power of God, and to minister the word of
reconciliation and salvation freely without a gift or a reward unto lost
souls, and hereof God is our witness, and also we have the seals of our
Ministry, which unto us herein can give testimony by the same Spirit, and this
are we ready to seal with our blood: And these six months, and upward have we
labored in travells, and sufferings, and reproaches, and have passed through
your Cities and Towns in soberness, and meekness, have we preached the
kingdom of God, and have holden forth the word of truth, and the testimony of
Jesus, and our lives have we not loved till this day, though sometimes dangers
on every side has beset us, that we might hold forth the faith of Jesus, the
author of our profession, in the exercise of a pure conscience, both by
doctrine and conversation, and herein we are justified in the sight of God, and
who is he that condemns us? and does call heaven and earth to record, and the
light in all men's consciences who have heard our doctrine, or seen our
conversation, to witness for us herein, and we challenge all you Nation of
Ireland, our very enemies, to prove the contrary, though otherwise we stand
falsely accused, and falsely reputed, to be disturbers, and makers of disorders,
to the breach of public peace, and such like grievous things upon the false
information; whereof a Warrant was issued out from the chief Ruler and Counsel
of Ireland, and we thereby was apprehended in the City of Cork, and haled by
guards, as malefactors to, before the Counsel in this City, where none of all
these false accusations was or could be proved against us, nor the
transgression of any known Law could we be convicted of, and though occasions
was sought against us, yet none could be found, and though snares was laid for
our feet, yet were we not entrapped, but was cleared in the sight of God,
witnessed by the light in all their consciences, and was found innocent and
without reproof in the eye of the Lord, and by our innocence was their orders
of false accusations made of none effect, and we thus far proved to be guiltles
before the throne of true judgment; yet notwithstanding contrary to the light
in their own consciences, and contrary to the just Laws of the Nations (which
afordeth freedom to the freeborn and righteous) were we committed to prison,
without conviction or any guilt charged upon us, or the least appearance of
evil toward any man's person, though falsely accused, yet nothing given true
testimony of against us, whereby our boldness in the way of the Lord could be
discouraged, as having the testimony of the Spirit of God bearing us witness
in the Holy Ghost, that in all good conscience toward God and toward man we
have lived unto this day, and so are without reproof in the sight of God and
all just men; and though upon search and examination we were found guiltles
thus far, yet further has the enemy the Devil prevailed in cruelty against the
innocent, that it is endeavored that we be banished, under the account of
vagabonds, which last accusation is the most false and urighteous, for we
challenge this, of whom have we begged? or to whom have we been burdensome? or
whose bread have we eaten for nothing? or what evil have we done? where is the
testimony of your slande^s? but innocently do we suffer these things, bearing
reproaches, and binding the cruelty done unto us as chains about our our
necks, and as crowns upon our heads, having the assurance that for well doing
we suffer these things from the hands of the Rulers, through the lies and
slanders of the teachers, who are in Cains way of persecution, till they have
fulfilled their measure of wickedness, and be laid wast as the wilderness.
And this is our cause, and hereby it comes before you, by the light of Christ
in your consciences to be judged, if your hearts be not altogether hardened and
your minds wholly blinded, and we lay it at the door to receive sentence from
you, and without respect of your persons, holds forth our guiltless cause
before you, not begging any thing from you, but herein to clear our
consciences, that you may save your selves from this untoward generation, whose
root is corrupt, and fruit bitterness, for while we have breath from the Lord
and injoynment of his presence, our duty is to serve the Lord in bearing
witness against injustice and all cruelty and oppression, and shall appeal to
receive justice from the present power which now rules; for in the name of the
Lord we challenge our privilege of freedom as being freeborn* till we be
accused guilty by the just Law of equity, unto which we are subject for
conscience sake, and not to any man's will, but by word and writing is bound by
the Law of God to bear witness against the unjust proceedings herein of the
Heads and Rulers of Dublin, and shall seal our witness against them, and
against their unrighteous decrees sealed in their cruelty against the innocent
with our blood, if thereunto we be called.

Dub. 26 of the 12 Month, 1655. Francis Howgill. Edw: Borough.


A Challenge to the Priests of Dublin, to try their God, and their Ministry,
and their worships.
WE the servants and faithful witnesses of the most high God, called and
chosen of him, and redeemed out of Nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, who
are Ministers of the word of life, and reconciliation, and messengers of glad
tidings, and salvation, unto captive and weary souls, our glorying is only in
the Lord, and not in our selves, who are by the world in scorn called Quakers,
who are at this present in outward bonds for the testimony of Jesus Christ in
Dublin, and who have been in the labor and travel of the Gospel of God, this
six months and upwards, in this Nation of Ireland, according to the will of God
ordained hereunto, and moved, and commanded by his eternal Spirit into this
his work, for the Seeds sake which is not of this world, to the gathering of it
into the fold of everlasting peace, and to the clearing of the Lord from the
blood of his enemies, that they may be left without excuse, by his powerful
word given unto us, and uttered by us (and herein we are a good savor to God,
both in them that perish and in them that believe) and for this cause have we
denied our dearest and nearest Relations, and loves not our lives unto death,
that our testimony we may finish which is committed to us of the Lord; and
because of this are we laborers under many burdens, and travells in many
afflictions, and sufferings, and are abundantly reproached, and our Lords truth
of which we bear witness, greatly infamed, by many slandering, and backbiting
tongues, especially by the Teachers, and professed Ministers, in the ears of
their people and hearers, slandering us with being Jesuits, and deceivers, and
seducers, and heretics, and blasphemers, and witches, and such like; and we of
those false accusations being clear, and our Lords truth, the testimony* which
we hold wholly innocent, and are willing to be tried, and proved, and made
manifest to the Inhabitants of this City and Nation, in the sight of God.

This therefore am I moved to give forth; and hereby in the name of our living
eternal God of heaven and earth, whom we serve, and worship, in that way which
is called heresy, do send it abroad as a Challenge to to all you Teachers,
and pretended Ministers of what sort and form soever, and to all you people
whom it may really concern, and especially to all you in the City of Dublin,
and places elsewhere in Ireland, to whom this may come, that you meet us in the
City of Dublin, at some public place, at a conveniant time appointed by you,
at which place and time if the Lord permit (by the permition of the Counsel of
Ireland, whose prisoners we are) we shall you meet then there, to have a fair
and sober dispute in the presence of all people, who may desire to be informed,
or satisfied, concerning us and you, in these things whereof you can accuse us;
and also of those things, by way of sober questions, which we have to propound
to you, not for any end to our selves, not to set up a kingdom of our own (God
is our witness) but that the way of our God may be made manifest, and all
deceit, and error discovered, and all people may be informed the way to
salvation, and as you are true to your God, and will answer for him, and are
willing to be made manifest in your way of worship, and doctrine, and Ministry,
you are not to neglect, but hearing to answer our desires, and the desires of
many hundreds, that you and we may be made manifest in the sight of God, to all
men's consciences, who are in truth, and who are in error, that shame and
condemnation may come upon the guilty, and truth may be exalted over all deceit.

Given under our hands, who are prisoners for the testimony of Jesus, whose
names in the flesh are Francis Howgill and Edw: Borough.
You are desired to send your Answer of these Propositions to us, and if you
consent to meet us, let sufficient notice be given abroad, that the Inhabitants
of the City and country may know five or six days time before.

Sent forth the 23 of the 12 Month, from the Sergeant at Arms his house in
Dublin.

This was sent to the Priests of Dublin, but no answer to this day have we
received from them; whereby it is manifest that they are not true to their God,
nor willing to be tried and made manifest, but loves darkness and hates the
light, and back-bites in secret, and cannot give a witness openly but falls
before the trial, and truth reigns over them, and is exalted over their deceit.



A Discovery of the Idol dumb Shepherds in that Nation, and a Lamentation
over their starved and strayed flocks.
THe day of the Lord is approaching, and the day of account draws near upon you
the Inhabitants of the earth, the time of your Covenant is expired made with
death, and hell, and the Lord God will plead with you, and reckon with you, and
give unto you a just reward, every one according to your deeds, even the
condition of your Bond.

Ye Shepherds, and Pastors of the flock, and Teachers of the people, what
account will ye render to the Lord in the day of his appearing? Should you not
have gathered the flock, and fed them, and taught them in the way of
righteousness, and preserved them from straying abroad, but instead thereof you
have scattered them upon the barren mountains, and have starved them, and have
strayed them, and led them into by paths of idolatry, and made a prey upon
them, and have fed your selves of them, and the heritage of the Lord has been
wasted by you, and the pastures of the fold eaten up by Wolves, and devourers,
and Lions whelps, which made the flock afraid, driven them into secret corners
of darkness, leanness, and poverty, where they are dead for want of food.

O ye Shepherds your account will be woeful, and miserable, in the dreadful
day which is hastening upon you; not one lamb have you brought forth to
perfection, to lie down in peace in the fold, but have nourisht it into the
nature of a dog; and a wolf, and you have fed them with swines flesh, and with
the husk, and milk they have not received from you, thereby to grow up unto God
in his Image; and not one fleece has the Lord gathered from all your flock,
you Teachers, Shepherds, and Pastors, your debt of wickedness is a gross sum
of great abomination in the Record of account, you have taught innocent
children into subtle hypocrisy, out of uprightness into guile, you have
taught lies instead of truth, and thereby has the people been instructed into
error, sects, and false opinions, and not one child have you taught perfect in
the way of the Lord, neither one of your hearers have you presented perfect in
Christ Jesus unto the Father, but for gifts and rewards have you taken the
charge of the learners, and not one has come to the knowledge of the truth by
you under your teaching, for you have been a cursed example, in pride, in
coveteousnesse, in oppression, and in hypocrisy, and how could you teach
children in the way of purity when your selves have walked in the way of
Idolatry, the language of Babylon have you instructed the people, and not one
verse have they learned in Sions Record, you have nurtured them in the nature
of whoredom, and their virginity have they lost.

What will ye do ye Shepherds, and Teachers, the Arrest of judgment from the
Court of equity is come forth against you, and sealed never to be changed;
whether will you fly to hide you? Gods judgments will pursue you, and your
reward will be indignation and vengeance, and your charge will be the devouring
and murder of souls, and the flock will be required of you, and every Lamb,
which carelessly you have starved, the blood thereof will be put upon your
account, and every child you have taught in the way of iniquity, the iniquity
thereof will be laid to your charge.

O doleful reckoning! when the Lord appears, a grievous sum are you guilty
which you are never able to pay, and just he is that calls you to account,
and the truth of his Bill will be sealed with the light in your own
consciences, which is the Lords witness, which has been privy to all your
abominations, one year after another have you been spared, and interest upon
interest will be put upon your score, not one day of faithful service and true
watching over the flock can you give testimony of, but idle Shepherds have you
been, and slumbring watchmen have you proved, and the whole flock has been
devoured, and scattered, and not one lamb is found in the fold, nor one strayed
sheep brought home from wandering, but the fences of the fold is laid wast, and
the door is shut up, and bolted against him that would enter* and you have
removed the pastures out of the pleasant valleys, into the desolate, and wild,
and untilled mountains* where every wild beast plays, and every desolate
bird inhabiteth.

What will you plead for your selves? Oh ye deceitful Hirelings, who have run
and was not sent, by whom the people is not profited at all: But you leaders of
the people have caused them to err in unknown paths, and you have taken the
charge of that you were not able to perform, you have wasted the Masters
goods, and his children have not been taught the way of holiness; you have
spent his portion among Harlots, and have given your Lords money to abominable
uses, nothing is gathered of your vines, but wild grapes, and sour grapes,
which the Lords soul loatheth, no figs of your thorns has been reaped, but
your best fruit has been of a loathsome taste, the most innocent among you has
been found guilty of innocent blood of souls.

Woe is me for you ye flocks of these Shepherds folds, alas, alas, your souls
are starved, and your feet are strayed, and into by paths of whoredoms have
you been instructed, and the door of the true Shepherds fold has been shut
against you, and the key of true knowledge has been hid out of your sight, and
obscurity and darkness has been cast before you, and the way of the Lord has
been undiscovered to your understanding, and into secret and subtle Idolatry
and witchcraft have you been nurtured, and your wound has been healed falsely,
and it will break out into more incurable dangers. O how have you been driven
away into strange pastures, and into barren heaths, and deserts, scattered lo
here, and lo there, by the voices of strangers, now when the Lord is come to
search you, instead of lambs you are found in the nature of wolves, and dogs,
and Lions, biting and devouring, and scorning and reproaching the children of
the true seed, and instead of children of light and truth, are you found strong
men of darkness and error; how is your nature changed since the first
creation in the innocent Image of God, strayed have you been, and not one
brought home by your Shepherds into the fold of truth, you have been a prey to
devourers, and meat for the wild beasts of the desolate forests, and a strong
language have you learned of the Egyptians character, and your delight has
been therein, even you have loved to have these things so, and like Shepherds
like sheep strayers and strayed, devourers and being devoured; what account
will you give in the day of the Lord? for your sin is written with a pen of
Iron, sealed in your foreheads, children of the womb of wickedness, a gross
sum of abomination is put upon your account, even lovers of darkness, and
haters of the light, how many times have you been called by the true Shepherds
voice, and you neglect and will not be gathered? how many good instructions
have you heard? and what profit have you received? much teaching and many
Sermons have you heard, and yet to this day the way of truth have you not
learned, but are groping in the dark in blindness and ignorance, and you blind
have been led by the blind, and the mouth of the ditch is opened to swallow you
uptogether, and you have refused knowledge and cannot endure to be reproved,
you love to stray rather then to be gathered, and you delight in leanness and
poverty upon the barren mountains rather then to be fed in the fat pastures of
true food. Shall not the Lords soul be avenged upon you? Ye Shepheads and
flocks, ye Teachers and people, your debt is summed into a large sum of
grievous abomination, the Indictment of vengeance is read, and sealing against
you, proved to be just in the Register of heaven, everlasting prison in the pit
of darkness, and everlasting Banishment from the presence of the Lord is
signing against you, in the eternal Law and righteous decree; the light of the
Lord Jesus Christ which shines in all your consciences will arise to be the
evidence of this just proceeding. God is grieved with you, you spiritual
Idolaters. Repent, Repent ye Idol Shepherds, and deceitful Teachers, and ye
scattered flock, and deceived people; This is the day of your visitation, and a
warning in your ears, the sword of the Lord is drawn against you, and the
whirlwind of his wrath is gone forth, your builded wall shall fall, and the
pillars of your habitation shall be shaken. God will gather his flock out of
your mouths, and feed them in his own fold, and your nakedness shall appear, and
your deceits shall be laid open, and your secret whoredoms shall be discovered,
your beginning was in darkness, and your time is out of the light, and your end
will be in destruction, now you have all time prize it.

Writ in Cork City in I^eland as moved of the Lord concerning the Shepherds
and flock, the Teachers and people in that Nation. From him who is a lover of
all your souls, but a witness against all your deceits* E. E.

An Invitation to all the poor desolate Soldiers to repent and make their
peace with the Lord, and their duty showed them what the Lord requires of them.
TO all you poor desolate Soldiers of the lowest rank, who are scattered up
and down in this desolate Land of Ireland, and lives a careless and a desolate
life, without the fear of the Lord, in lying, in swearing, in drunkenness, in
whoredom, in oppression, and in the wickedness of the world, and are past
feeling and senseless of the operation and power of God, careless of your
eternal happiness: The dreadful day of the Lord God is coming, in power the
Lord is risen, and the wrath of the Lord is gone forth, with the strength of
indignation and sury will you be besieged, and fearfulness shall surprise you.
Repent of your transgressions, and fear and tremble before the presence of the
living God, who is commander in chief over heaven and earth; prize your
souls, this is the day of your visitation, and make your peace with the Lord;
the righteous Judge the Lord sees you in your darkness, and searches you in
your desolate obscurity, and the soul is pressed under your iniquities, and he
has not disrespected any of your persons or desolate places, but God is light
and has lightened every one of you with the true light of life eternal, if you
love it and be guided by it or of death everlasting if you hate it and disobey
it, and walk contrary to it; that is the light which convinces you of sin, of
lying, and swearing, and cursed speakings, and drunkenness, which are the
fruits of the cursed tree, which cumbers the ground of the Lord, which the axe
is now laid to the root of, to cut it down and cast it into everlasting
burning; and while you act against this light in your consciences, you crucify
the life of Christ Jesus, and are enemies unto him, and servants of the Devil,
and loves your evil deeds, and upholders of the Devils conquest, which is the
dominion of sin; this light reproves you in secret of violence, and false
accusing, and all unjust words and actions which are contrary to God, so turn
your minds to the light, which will lead you to repentance, from dead works,
out of the broad way of destruction, which many are in (as Christ Jesus says)
and it will teach you in your places to serve the living God and to do
violence to no man, but to be terror, and reprovers, and correctors of all
violence, and of such who lives in it; and it will teach you not to strengthen
the hands of evil doers, but to lay your sword in justice upon every one that
does evil, and it will teach you not to make war but to preserve peace in the
earth; and this is your place and duty required of you from the Lord God
commander in chief, unto whom you must all give an account, and receive a just
reward according to your deeds, everlasting punishment to him that does evil;
but if you stand in the fear of the Lord, your sword will be a terror and
dread to them that fear him not but lives contrary to the light in their own
consciences, which light if you love it is your command to march by, and your
rule to judge by, and weapon to fight withal, and your chief commission for
duty. And now you have all time take heed to your selves, go not on in your
course of evil, nor take not your pleasure in unrighteousness, but to the
light in your conscience take heed, it is your teacher to God if you love it,
or your condemnation from God if you hate it; And this is your terms with the
Lord, prize the acceptance of his love to your souls, and the day of your
visitation, least you perish in your rebellion eternally. Written in love to
your souls,

Written in Ireland at Caterlough. E. B.

A Warning from the Lord to the Natives of that Nation of Ireland, who are made
a curse, and a prey to be destroyed of your enemies.
REpent, Repent, ye that remain from being devoured, whose days are yet
stretched forth, that you may return to the Lord, from whom you are grievously
degenerated into filthiness, and uncleanesse, being a cursed brood, and are
become unhuman in your impudent shameless, practices of ungodlines, and are
brazened in your filthiness, and cannot blush when you have done evil, the
plagues of God, and his wrath waits to consume you from off the face of the
earth, you are shut up in blindness and covered with darkness which may be
felt, and you are as deaf Adders, void of understanding, and past feeling, and
given up to work all unrighteousnes with delight, counting it your glory to
work wickedness, having sold your selves to commit sin, you have wholly slain
Gods witness, and are become wild and brutish as the beasts of the field, and
untamed as savage Colts, the indignation of God is against you, who are as dead
trees and withered branches, and scorched heaths, not sensible of good nor
evil, but as wild Asses, who neither fears God nor regards man; to the light
in your consciences, wherewith Christ has lightened you, do I now speak; Gods
murdered witness shall answer me, by which you are inexcusable, for with the
light you know lying, swearing, stealing, murder, drunkenness, and whoredom, are
sins and transgressions; the light will let you see these abounds among you, by
which you are reproved, and eternally to be condemned if you do not repent of
these your grievous abominations: And if you love the light and turn to it, it
will lead you out of sin, and out of your vain foolish traditions, and
imitations, and sorceries, and witchcrafts, which deceives your souls; and
this light in your consciences will change you into sobernes, and humanity, and
will lead you into the way of life and salvation, out of the way of death and
hell* wherein you walk, to eternal misery. Therefore prize your souls, and the
dreadful God fear, and tremble before him ye profane wretches, and cease from
your filthy, nasty, poluted ways of Idolatry, lying, swearing, stealing,
drunkenness, and such like, God forbids with the light in your consciences,
and he that does these things shall eternally perish in condemnation for ever.
And this to you is a warning, in pity to your lost souls, whose hearts are
desperately wicked, and set to do mischief; the vengeance of God is against
you, the light in your consciences shall witness me, and justify the Lord, in
the day of recompense, when every man receives according to his deeds, the
righteous unto life, the wicked unto eternal wrath. Now you have time, prize
it; the light is your teacher loving it, and your condemnation for ever hating
it.

Edw: Borough.
