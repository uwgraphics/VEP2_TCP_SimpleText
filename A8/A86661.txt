To the Honorable JOHN LEVERET Esquire Governor of the Colony of the
Massachusetts; JOSIAH VVINSLOW Esquire Governor of the Colony of Plymouth; WILLIAM
LEET Esquire Governor of the Colony of Connecticut.
NOtwithstanding the great and unvaluable good that has in all ages of the
World accrued to Mankind by Order and Government, yet such is the depravedness
of man's nature, and imperfection of his knowledge, that it is as well hard to
find out, as difficult to maintain, such a Form and Order of Government as will
prove a sufficient Fence and security for so great a treasure as is the common
good, and public safety. After the sad and long experience of former times,
some have thought no means can be found out so effectual for the upholding and
and preserving the same, with all the sacred and civil rights and privileges
thereunto belonging, as a liberty for people to design and choose out from
among themselves, the persons that are to be entrusted with those great
concerns. Whatever may be said for the extolling the happiness of them that
have such an advantage in their hands, all that may be comprehended within the
compass of such a power, it is for the present in the principal and leading
part thereof devolved upon your selves in all the three Colonies of
New England; who by the choice of the free people in those your several
Jurisdictions, are now called to act your several parts as chief on the public
stage of Government. Ever since you have taken your turns at the helm, there
have been very boisterous winds and rough Seas, threatening the shipwreck of
all; which notwithstanding, you need not be discouraged, while due
consideration is had, to whom, and what you have embarked with you. When once
the great Roman Conqueror, and chief founder of their Monarchy, was passing the
Adriatic Sea in a disguize, the Pilot being dismayed with the fierceness of
the wind, the raging of the waves, his Passenger pulled off his disguize, and
bid him be of good courage and not fear, for he carried Caesar, and all his
Fortunes: Surely Jesus Christ and all his promises, in which you are not a
little concerned, is a far better ground of comfort and encouragement in a
stormy season. Luther was wont to say, or did once in a great ex^gent say, that
he had rather ruere cum Christo quam stare cum Caesare; accounting Christ a
better friend, though falling as to the world to t^ust to, then Caesar standing
in power, according to the words of Christ himself, greater is he that is in
you, then he that is in the World: So as all such may say with the Prophet,
Rejoice not against me O mine enemy; for when I fall, I shall rise, when I sit
in darkness, the Lord shall be a Light unto (...); which I trust your selves
have had so much experience of, in these late dark dispensations, that if
sometimes you have not seen, yet always you have believed that Light was sown
for the righteous, and that there shall be a clear breaking forth of the sun,
after the tempest is over; what God has planted, shall not by man, or any of
Satan's Instruments be plucked up. It is with young Colonies, as it is with
trees newly planted, which those winds, as one says, that are not so
boisterous as to blow down, do so far advantage as to shake them to a greater
fastness at the root. The Sovereign Ruler of the World does usually by such
ways and means b^ing about his peoples good, at the first, not well
understood, nor easily brooked, till the quiet fruit of righteousness be
discerned to spring ^p unto all such as are exercised therein. It has been no
small advantage that the staff of Government, and the shields of this part of
the earth were put into your hands (before the Boar out of the Wood has broke
into this Vineyard) who under God we trust may be found the repairers of the
breach, and the Restorers of Paths to dwell in, while both your selves, and
those under your charge, and conduct, are looking unto him, who is promised to
be the peace of his people when the Assyrian shall come into their land.

The consideration of the power wherewith you are invested, together with the
great Wisdom, Faithfulness and Courage by which it has been managed by you,
in your several stations, has induced me to desire that the Historical
d^scourse ensuing might pass into public view under the umbrage of your
Protection. If a reason be demanded for the entituling so many names of worth
to the patronage of so small and inconsiderable a Volume I need no other
Apology at this time, ^e^ I find in the words of the W^se Man; there are cases
wherein two are better then one, and a three fol^ Cord is not easi^y broken:
For it being like to p^ss through your several Jurisdictions, I conceived it
might need a pasport of safe conduct from him that does preside in either of
them. It carries nothing with it but truth, (as I hope will be found) which may
well expect to meet with a ready Welcome, and suitable entertainment in every
honest mind; but all men are not so equally balanced in their affections as to
bear with plain dealing, and give that harmless dove a resting place in their
minds for the sole of her foot. O^ all Writings, those that are historical,
specially while the things mentioned are fresh in memory, and the actors
themselves surviving, had need be pursued with a wary space. Notwithstanding
the great care that has been taken to give all and every one, any way
concerned in the subject of the discourse, their just due, and nothing more or
less, yet perhaps some critical Reader will not let every sentence pass without
some censure or other. It was once by a great man accounted no small offense in
an harmless Poet, that some of his titles were misplaced as they were
marshalled up in their order: If any Historian should commit an error parale^
thereunto, a pardon, as it may be needed, in such a Script as is the present
Narrative, so may it be the better expected while passi^g up and down under the
guard of your authority, yea tho it should chance to be an offense of an higher
nature; as the mi^iming of some p^ssages, mistaking he distance of some places,
or too often touching upon the same particulars, which could not be well
avoided in a Collection of so many occurrents too hastily drawn up, though
true, yet unseasonably, or out of due time coming to light without a total
omission of some material passages. It was intended at the first only as a
private essay, wherein to bind up together the most memorable passages of
divine providence, during our late, or former troubles with the Indians; it
might have remained in the place where it was first conceived and formed, or
been smoothered as an imperfect Embrio, not worthy to see the light, if some
such as your selves had not both quickened the being, and hastened the birth
thereof. Something of this nature may be of use to post^rity, as well as to
those of the present Generation, to help them both to call mind, and carry
along the memory of such eminent deliverances, and special preservations
granted by divine favor to the people here; as it was of old commanded of God
himself, that a Register should be kept of thos^ Wars, which in opposition to
others, were in a peculiar manner to be called the Wars of the Lord; and such
are these here treated of, if any, since miraculous deliverances have ceas^d,
may truly be said to deserve that title. If it had fallen into some able^ hand,
it might have been set forth with better choice of words, and more fit
expressions, that might have left a deeper impression on the minds of those who
are most concerned to retain it; however it being now like to be brought to
public view, I have presumed to offer it to your selves, as on the accounts
forementioned, so also as a testimony of my thankful and deserved
acknowledgment of that wisdom and integrity abundantly shown forth in the
administration of your authority.

Much honored and Honorable, I have nothing more to add, but the engagement
of my continual and daily prayers to the God of the Spirits of all flesh, that
he would carry you through all troubles, difficultyes and trials you may be
conflicting with, whither personal or political, and that he would bless your
Counsels at home, prosper your enterprises abroad, and long continue your
light in the present Generation, for his own glory, and his peoples good, that
after you have served your Generation here, your memory like that of the just,
may be blesed, and that you may leave peace as the inheritance of the remaining
Israel of God in these ends of the earth, which is and shall be the earnest
wish, and constant desire of

Your most humble and Devoted Servant, William Hubbard.
From my Study 16th. 12th. 1676.
An Advertisement to the Reader.
THe following historical Essay, was when first drawn up, intended only for the
satisfaction of a private Friend, and not for the use of the public, therefore
hope I may be excused, if I fall short therein of that exactness, which might
be expected from one that designedly undertook a Work of this nature: however
trusting more to the judgment of some who have accidentally had the perusal
thereof, then mine own, I am not unwilling that others should receive benefit
thereby. The Compiler of an History can challenge little to himself but
methodizing the work, the materials being found to his hand: diligence in
gathering them together, and faithfulness in improving them, is all that is
upon point required of him, in both which I have endeavored to make good, what
the profession I have now taken up obliges me unto. The matters of fact therein
related (being rather Massacres, barbarous inhumane outrages, then acts of
Hostility, or valiant achievements) no more deserve the name of a War, then
the report of them the title of an History, therefore I contented my self with
a Narrative. Much of what is therein mentioned, depending on the single
authority of particular persons, an exact description of every occurrent was
hardly to be obtained: All Soldiers are not like Caesar, able to describe with
their pens, what they have done with their Swords: But the most material
passages inserted, were either gathered out of the Letters, or taken from the
mouths of such as were eye or ear-witnesses of the things themselves; and
those also persons worthy of credit. In such passages as were variously
reported by the Actors, or Spectators, that which seemed most probable is only
inserted. If any error be committed about the Situation or distance of places,
it may deserve an excuse rather then a censure: For our Soldiers in the
pursuit of their enemies being drawn into many desert places, inaccessible
Woods, and unknown Paths, which no Geographers hand ever measured, scarce any
vultures eye had ever seen, there was a necessity to take up many things in
reference thereunto upon no better credit sometimes then common Report. One or
two passages need a more particular excuse, or at least explication: As where
it is said, p. 2. that the first Colony was sent hither Anno, 1606, The mistake
is easily helped, by minding the Reader that the Patent or Commission was that
year granted, when also Capt. Henery Challons was sent over upon some further
discovery of the Country, before the Adventurers would hazard a greater charge:
soon after the departure of the said Challons, the same year Sr. John Popham,
one of the principal undertakers, sent out another ship to second him under the
Command of Capt. Haman, Martin P^in of Bristow being Master, who not finding
Challons (for he miscarried in his design being seized by some Strangers in the
way) yet returning with good news the next year they sent out two ships with an
hundred men, with Ordnance and other Provision, under the conduct of Capt.
George Popham and Capt. Rawley Gilbert, who built a Fort in some place about
Saga de hoch, called S. Georges Fort, the ruins of which are remaining to this
day, as some say. Probably other like mistakes may be observed, in describing
the bounds and dimensions of some of the Patents, and grants of land belonging
to the other Colonies; but an Historian being no Pretorian Judge, his report
cannot prejudice any peoples Jurisdiction, or persons propriety.

Further also where it is said, p. 7. That the Indians had lived peaceably with
the English here near forty years, ever since the Pequod War; it is to be
understood with reference to public acts of Hostility; for particular
mischiefs have been committed by several Indians in some parts of the Country
but the actors were not abetted therein by any of their Countrymen: As at
Nantucket, an Island to the eastward of Cape Cod, where in the end of the year
1664. some villainous Indians murdered some that suffered shipwreck upon that I
stand, yet justice was done upon two or three of the chief actors. In like
manner within a few years after the P^quod Wars, Mris. Hutchinson was killed
by the Indians near a Dutch Plantation; about which time some other insolences
of like nature were acted by the Indians southward, either upon long Island, or
in some place within New Haven Colony. Also a murder was committed at
Farmington, another at Woburn, by some Indians in their drunken humors, upon a
maidservant or two, who denied them drink. All which hinder not the truth of
what is affirmed in the Narrative, such murders being too frequently committed
in the most peaceable places in the world. Such errors as are the
forementioned, being overlooked by the Candid Reader, it is presumed, there
will not be many other faults to be complained of, unless such as are merely
Typographical, or else were ocasioned by the dropping in of particular
passages, after the whole was drawn up, which I was willing to insert, although
it occasioned the discourse in some places, to be a little more confused then
else would have been. If ever the matter require another edition, more
acurateness may be observed. If those into whose hand these shall happen to
come, find any satisfaction about the occurcurrents, that have here fallen out,
the Publisher shall account his pains well bestowed.

To the Reverend Mr. William Hubbard on his most exact History of New-Englands
Troubles.
WHen thy rare Piece unto my view once came
It made my Muse that erst did smoke to flame:
Raising my Fancy so sublime, that I
That famous forked Mountain did epsy;
Thence in an Ecstasy I softly fell
Down near unto the Helliconian Well,
Where Poetry, in Prose, made I did see
By a Mercurian Brain, which sure was Thee;
Such is thy modest Style enriched with Sense,
Invention fine, faced with Eloquence:
Thy florid Language quintly does express
The Truth of matter in a comely Dress;
Couching the Sense in such a pleasing Strain
As makes the Readers Heart to leap again:
And sweetly draws him like those Lotteries
Which never miss but always win the Prize:
But whither roves my Muse? What can be done
By'm that augments the Sea, or lights the Sun?
Go on brave Worthy, and let these Essays,
Like fair Aurora usher in the Rays
Of a Refulgent Sun arising clear
Hence to illuminate our Hemisphere;
That th'after Ages may extol the High-One
For's Loving kindness to our little Sion:
And may our Senators with due regard
These and thy future labors all reward;
Though not in full, yet such encouragement,
As may in them be just, to thee content;
For th'present Age, and those that shall ensue,
Will be perpetual Debtors unto You.
Fame shall with Honor crown thee; and we will raise
Thy lasting Monument in Groves of Bays.
Heavens bless thee in thy Work, and may success
Attend thee here, hereafter Happiness.

BY Reason of the Authors long, and necessary absence from the Press, together
with the difficulty of reading his hand, many faults have escaped in the
Printing, either by mistaking of words, or mispointing of Sentences, which do
in some places not a little confound the Sense, which the Reader is desired to
correct before he begins to read.

A NARRATIVE OF THE TROUBLES With the Indians in NEW ENGLAND, From the first
Planting thereof to the present time.
KNown unto God are all his works from the foundation of the world, though
manifest to us, only by the events of time, that fruitful mother of all things,
which in the former age did bring forth, at least did bring to light the
knowledge of this western World, called America, that in all foregoing times
and ages, lay hid in this obscure and remote Region, covered with a veyle of
ignorance, and locked up from the knowledge of all the rest of the Inhabitants
of the Earth. To whom the honor of its investigation does of eight more
properly belong, is sufficiently declared by the Hystory and Reports of such as
were ey witnesses thereof, and not intended to be any part of the present
disquisition. The most considerable part of all the North side of America, is
called New England. In the fertility of the Soil, salubriousness of the Air,
and many other commodious advantages, most resembling the Country from whence
it borrowed its appellation. For the knowledge thereof the World is most
beholding to the discoveries of the English, under the conduct of Sebastian
Cabbot a famous Porteguez about the year 1497. though since much perfected by
the industry and travels of Captain Gosnold, Captain Hudson, Captain Smith, and
others of the English Nation. North America this posthumous birth of time, is
as to its nativity, of the same standing with her two elder Sisters Peru and
Mexico, yet was suffered to ly in its Swadling-clothes, one whole Century of
years, nature having promised no such Dowry of rich Mines of Silver and Gold to
them that would espouse her for their own, as she did unto the other two, which
possibly was the reason why she was not so hastily deflowred by her first
discoverers, nor yet so early courted by any of the Princes of Europe, lying
wholly neglected as it were, until a small company of Planters, under the
command of Captain George Popham, and Captain Gilbert were sent over at the
charge of Sir John Popham in the year 1606. to begin a Colony upon a Tract of
Land about Saga de hoch, situate on the south side of the River of Kennibeck
and about that called Shipscot River, about twenty miles south-West from
Pemmaquid, the most Northerly bound of all New England. But that design within
two years expiring with its first Founder, soon after some honorable persons
of the West of England, commonly called the Counsel of Plymouth, being more
certainly informed of several Navigable Rivers and commodious Havens, with
other places fit either for Traffic or Planting, newly discovered by many
skilful Navigators, obtained a Grant by Patent, under the great Seal from King
James of blessed memory, of all that part of North America, called New England.
From the 40 to the 48 gr. of North Latitude. From which Grand and Original
Patent, all other Charters and Graunts of Land from Pemmaquid to Delaware Bay,
along the Seacoast, derive their Lineage and Pedigree; thus was that vast tract
of Land, after the year 1612. cantoned and parcelled out into many lesser
Divisions and parcels, according as Adventurers presented, which said Graunts
being founded upon uncertain, or false Descriptions, and Reports of some that
Traveled thither, did many of them interfere one upon another, to the great
disturbance of the first Planters, and prejudice of the Proprietors themselves,
as is too well known by any that have had occasion to stay never so little
amongst them, many of whom are yet surviving. For notwithstanding the great
charge and vast expenses the first Adventurers were at, the first Proprietors
of the whole Province of Main and others (reaching from the head of Casco Bay
North-east to the mouth of Pascat^qua River about sixty miles Westward) and the
hopes they might have conceived of being the first Founders of New-Colonies,
and of enlarging their Estates and Inheritances by those new acquired
possessions and Lordships, there was little profit reaped from thence after the
rich fleeces of Beaver were gleaned away, nor any great improvement made of
those large portions of Lands, save the erecting of some few Cottages for
Fishermen, and a few inconsiderable Buildings for the Planters, which were on
those occasions drawn over the Sea, to settle upon the most northerly parts of
New England.

But whither it were by the imprudence of the first Adventurers, or the
dissoluteness of the persons they sent over to manage their Affairs, or whither
want of faithfulness or skill to manage their trust, they were by degrees in a
manner quite deserted almost of Laws and Government, and left to shift for
themselves, by which means at last they fell under the Jurisdiction of the
Massachusetts Colony, not by Usurpation, as is by great mistake suggested to his
Majesty, but by necessity, and the earnest desire of the Planters themselves;
to accept of whom, those of the Massachusetts Colony were the more easily
induced; in that they apprehended the bounds of their own Patent, by a
favorable Interpretation of the words describing the Northern Line [Three
miles beyond the most Northerly branch of Merimack River] do reach somewhat
beyond Pemmaquid, the North-west limits of all New England.

This was the first beginning of things in New England, at which time they were
not unlike the times of old, when the people of Judah were said to be without a
Teaching Priest, and without Law; and no wonder things were no more
successfully carried on.

In the Year 1620. a Company belonging to Mr. Robinsons Church at Leyden in
Holland, although they had been courteously entertained by the Dutch, as
Strangers sojourning amongst them, yet foreseeing many inconveniences like to
increase, and that they could not so well provide for the good of their
Posterity, under the Government of a foreign Nation; they resolved to entreat
so much favor from their own Sovereign Prince King James, as to grant them
liberty under the shelter of his Royal Authority, to place themselves in some
part of New England, then newly discovered; wherefore having obtained some kind
of Patent or Grant, for some place about Hudsons River, they set sail from
Plymouth in September for the Southern parts of New England, but as they
intended to bend their course thitherward, per varios casus, per tot difcrimina
rerum; they were at last cast upon a bosom of the South Cape of the
Massachusetts Bay, called Cape Cod, about the 11 th of November, from whence the
Winter so fast approaching, they had no opportunity to remove; and finding some
encouragement from the hopefulness of the Soil, and courtesy of the Heathen,
they resolved there to make their abode for the future, which they did, laying
the foundation of a new Colony, which from the remembrance of the last Town in
England they sailed from, they called New Plymouth; containing no very
considerable Tract of Land, scarce extending an hundred miles in length through
the whole Cape, and scarce half so much in breadth where it is broadest. The
first Founders of that Colony aiming more at Religion then Earthly Possessions,
aspiring not to any large dimension of Land, in their settling upon those Coasts.

At Weymouth also was a Plantation begun by Mr. Weston in the year 1622. but it
came to little.

The North and South Border of the Massachusetts Bay being thus planted, the
middle part was the more easy to be filled up, which thus was brought about.
Some Gentlemen and others, observing how it fared with those of New Plymouth,
were desiring upon the like ground to make the same attempt for themselves,
wherefore having by a considerable sum of money purchased of the Council of
Plymouth, all their right and interest in a Plantation there begun in the
Massachusetts Bay, and having attained a confirmation thereof by Patent from
King Charles of famous memory, in the year 1628, they sent over a Governor with
several persons to lay some foundation of an other Colony in the Massachusetts
Bay: and in the year 1630, more of the persons interested in the said Patent
(thence commonly called Patentees) with several other persons, intending to
venture their lives and all with them, transported themselves and their
Families into the said Massachusetts, who did in a short space of time by the
accession of many hundreds, who every year flocked after them, make such
increase, that in the space of five or six years, there were twenty
considerable Towns built and peopled, and many of the Towns first planted,
became so filled with Inhabitants, that like Swarms of Bees they were ready to
swarm^, not only into new Plantations, but into new Colonies, insomuch that in
the year 1635 a new Colony began to be planted upon Connecticut River, partly
by combination amongst themselves, removing from some Towns about the
Massachusetts Bay, and partly by the interest of a Patent purchased of that
honorable Gentle man Mr. Fennick, Agent for the Lord Sey, and Lord Brook, the
Lords Proprietors of the said River Connecticut, at the mouth of which River
they had built a Fort, (called after their own titles Sey-Brook Fort)
commanding the passage of the said River. Yea such was the Confluence of people
making over into those parts, that in the year 1637 a fourth Colony began to be
planted, bearing the name of Newhaven from the first Town erected therein,
seated near the midway betwixt Hudsons River and that of Connecticot. The Sea
coast from the pitch of Cape Cod to the mouth of Connecticot River, inhabited
by several nations of Indians, Wompanoogs (the first Authors of the present
Rebellion) Narhagansits, Pequods, Mohegins, as the more inland part of the
Country by the Nipnets (a general name for all inland Indians betwixt the
Massachusetts and Connecticut River) The Seacoast South-west from Plymouth was
first possessed by some discontented with the Government of the Massachusetts
Colony, from which some being exiled, others of their friends accompanying of
them, settled themselves upon a fair Island to the South-west of Cape Cod, now
called Road-Island, others settled upon the Mayn, at a place called Providence,
and so by degrees planting toward Narrhaganset Bay, made another Plantation
called Warwick, which places are since by Patent conferred upon the Inhabitants
of Road-Island; the rest of the Country from Pequod River to the River of
Connecticot, falling within the bounds of Connecticot Colony by Patent also,
since confirmed to the said Colony. Things had been very prosperously and
succesfully carried on in all the foresaid Colonyes and Jurisdictions, from the
year 1620, to the year 1636, at which time the Pequod Indians, the most warlike
and fierce of all the Indians in that part of the Country, who had made all the
rest of the Indians to stand in awe, having committed many barbarous outrages
upon their neighbor Indians, both Narhagansets on the east side, and Mohegins
on the west side of them: and also upon the English and Dutch, as they came
occasionally to traffic with them: and in the year 1634, having barbarously
murdered Capt. Stone and Capt. Norton, as they were trading with them.
Afterward one Oldham coming amongst them upon the like account. In like manner
having committed several outrages upon the planters about Connecticut River,
the Inhabitants of all the Colonyes, unanimously setting upon them in the
beginning of the year 1637, they were easily suppressed, about 700 of them
destroyed, the rest either fled to the Mohawkes, by whom they were all cut off
that escaped, or else sheltring themselves under the Narhagansets and Mohegins
their neighbors, they were by the power of the English all subjected to one of
those two Nations of the Indians. Miantonimoh the chief Sachem or Lord of the
Narhagansets, expecting to be sole Lord and Ruler over all the Indians, after
the Pequods were subdued, began to quarrel with the Mohegins upon the account
of Sovereignty, notwithstanding a firm Agreement was made betwixt the English
and the said Narhagansets in the year 1637, when they had helped to destroy the
Pequods, and also notwithstanding the tripartite League between the said
Narhagansets, the Mohegins, and the English at Hartford (the chief Town of
Connecticut Colony) made in the year 1638, wherein the said Indians were
solemnly engaged not to quarrel either with the Mohegins, or any other Indians,
until they had first asked the advice of the English, to whose determination
they had likewise obliged themselves to stand, in all following D^fferences
among them. Yet did these ambitious Narhagansets specially their chief Leader
Miantonimoh; bare such an inveterate hatred against the Mohegins, that they
were every year picking quarrels with them. The Mohegins on the other side
though not so numerous, yet a more warlike people and more politic, always
made their recourse to the English, complaining of the insolences of the
Narhagansets, contrary to their League, so as they would hardly be kept from
making open war against them, when they saw all other attempts to kill and
destroy Vncas the Mohegin Sachem, by Treachery, poison, and Sorcery prove
ineffectual. Insomuch that at last the malice of Miantonimoh and his
Narrhagansets grew to that height, that they began to plot against the English
themselves, for defending of Vncas. But it being discovered by Vncas and some
of his men to the English; Miantonimoh was sent for by the Massachusetts Court
to come to Boston, when he came there, he would have denied those things laid
to his charge, he was convicted by one of his own fellowers; and instead of
standing to his promise, to deliver him to the Mohegin Sachem whose Subject he
was, going homeward he cut off his head, to prevent his telling more tales. And
with great discontent as he was going home said he would come no more at
Boston, wherein he proved a truer prophet then he himself believed when he
uttered the words, for in the end of the same year 1643 making war upon Vncas,
he was taken prisoner by him, and soon after by the advice of the Commissioners
of the four Colonyes, (at that time united firmly into a League offensive and
defensive, on which account they were after that time called the united
Colonyes of New England: though since that time they are reduced but to three
Colonyes; that of New Haven and Connecticot by the last Patent being conjoined
in one) his head was cut off by Vncas, it being justly feared, that there would
never be any firm peace, either betwixt the English and the Narhagansets, or
betwixt the Narhagansets and the Mohegins, while Miantonimoh was left alive:
however the Narhagansets have ever since that time borne an implacable malice
against Vncas, and all the Mohegins, and for their sakes secretly against the
English, so far as they durst discover it.

In the years 1645, and 1646. they grew so insolent, that the Commissioners of
the united Colonyes were compelled to raise Forces to go against them, but when
they perceived that the English were in good earnest, they began to be afraid,
and sued for peace, and submitted to pay a tr^bute to satisfy for the charge of
preparation for the war, but were always very backward to make payment until
the English were forced to demand it by new Forces, so that it appeared they
were unwillingly willing to hold any friendly correspondence with the English,
yet durst they never make any open attempt upon them, until the present
Rebellion, where in that they had no small hand, is too too evident,
notwithstanding all their pretenses to the contrary, as will appear in the
sequel of this History.

Thus it is apparent upon what Terms the English stood with the Narhagansets,
ever since the cutting off Miantonimoh, their chief Sachems head by Vncas, it
being done from the advice and Counsel of the English Anno. 1043. As for the
rest of the Indians, ever since the suppressing of the Pequods in the year 1637
until the year 1675, there was always in appearance amity and good
correspondence on all sides, scarce an English man was ever known to be
assaulted or hurt by any of them, until after the year 1671, when the son of
one Matoonas, who as was supposed, being vexed in his mind that the design
against the English, intended to begin 1671 did not take place, out of mere
malice and spite against them, slew an English man traveling along the Road,
the said Matoonas being a Nipnet Indian, which Napnets were under the command
of the Sachem of Mount-hope the Author of all the present mischiefs. Upon a due
enquiry into all preceding transactions between the Indians and the English,
from their first settling in these coasts, there will appear no ground of
quarrel that any of them had against the English, nor any appearance of
provocation upon one account or other; for when Plymouth Colony was first
planted, within three months after their first landing, March. 16. 1620.
Massasoit the chief Sachem of all that side of the Country repaired to the
English at Plymouth, and entered into a solemn League upon sundry Articles
printed in N.E. Memorial 1669. p. 24. the words are as follows.

1. THat neither he, nor any of his should injure or do hurt to any of their
people. 2. That if any of his did any hurt to any of theirs, he should send the
Offender that they might punish him. 3. That if any thing were taken away from
any of theirs, he should cause it to be restored; and they should do the like
to his. 4. That if any did unjustly war against him, they should aid him; and
if any did war against them, he should aid them. 5. That he should send to his
neighbor Confederates, to certify them of this, that they might not wrong
them, but might be likewise comprised in these Conditions of Peace. 6. That
when his Men came to them upon any occasion, they should leave their Arms
(which were then Bows and Arrows) behind them. 7. Lastly, that so doing, their
Sovereign Lord King James would esteem him as his Friend and Ally.
The which League the same Sachim, Sept. 25. 16^0. a little before his death,
coming with his eldest Son, afterward called Alexander, did renew with the
English at the Court of Plymouth, for himself and his Son, and their Heirs and
Successors: and after that he came to Mr. Browns, that lived not far from Mount
Hope, bringing his two Sons, Alexander and Philip with him, desiring that there
might be Love and Amity after his death, between his Sons and them, as there
had been betwixt himself and them in former times: yet it is very remarkable,
that this Massasoit, called also Woosamequen (how much soever he aff^cted the
English, yet) was never in the least degree any ways well affected to the
Religion of the English, but would in his last Treaty with his Neighbors at
Plymouth when they were with him about purchasing some Land at Swanzy, have had
them engaged never to attempt to draw away any of his People from their old
Pagan Superstition, and Devilish Idolatry, to the Christian Religion, and did
much insist upon it till he saw the English were resolved never to make any
Treaty with him more upon that account, which when he discerned, he did not
further urge it: but that was a bad Omen that notwithstanding what ever his
humanity were to the English, as they were Strangers) for indeed they had
repayed his forme^ kindness to them, by protecting him afterward against the
insolences of the Narrhagansets) he manifested no small displacency of Spirit
against them, as they were Christians: which strain was evident more in his Son
that succeeded him, and all his People, in so much that some discerning persons
of that Jurisdiction have feared that that Nation of Indians would all be
rooted out, as is since come to pass. The like may be observed concerning the
Narrhagansets, who were always more civil and courteous to the English then
any of the other Indians, yet never as yet received the least tincture of
Christian Religion, but have in a manner run the same fate with the rest of
their Neighbors of Mount Hope, there being very few of them now left standing.
Nor is it unworthy the Relation, what a person of quality amongst us has of
late affirmed, one being much conversant with the Indians about Merimack River,
being Anno. 1660. invited by some Sagamores or Sachims to a great Dance (which
solemnities are the times they make use of to tell their stories, and convey
the knowledge of fore past and most memorable things to Posterity)
Passaconaway, the great Sachim of that part of the Country, intending at that
time to make his last and farwell speech to his Children and People, that were
then all gathered together, to whom he addressed himself in this manner:

I am now going the way of all Flesh, or ready to die, and not likely to see you
ever met together any more; I will now leave this word of Counsel with you,
that you take heed how you quarrel with the English, for though you may do them
much mischief; yet assuredly you will all be destroyed, and rooted off the
Earth if you do: for, said he, I was as much an Enemy to the English, at their
first coming into these parts, as any one whatsoever, and did try all ways and
means possible to have destroyed them, at least to have prevented them sitting
down here, but I could no way effect it (it is to be noted that this
Passaconaway was the most noted Pawaw and Sorcerer of all the Country)
therefore I advise you never to contend with the English, nor make war with
them: And accordingly his eldest Son Wonnalancet by name, as soon as he
perceived that the Indians were up in Arms, he withdrew himself into some
remote place, that he might not be hurt by the English, or the Enemies, or be
in danger by them. This p^ssage was thought fit to be inserted here, it having
so near an agreement with the former, intimating some secret awe of God upon
the hearts of some of the principal amongst them, that they durst not hurt the
English, although they bare no good affection to their Religion, wherein they
seem not a little to imitate Balaam, who whatever he uttered, when he was under
the awful power of divine illumination, yet when left to himself, was as bad an
Enemy to the Israel of God as ever before.

But to return, whence there has been this Digression:

After the death of this Woosamequen or Massasoit, his eldest Son succeeded him
about twenty years since, Alexander by name, who notwithstanding the League he
had entered into with the English, together with his Father, in the year 1639.
had neither affection to the Englishmens persons, nor yet to their Religion,
but had been plotting with the Narhagansets, to rise against the English, of
which the Governor and Council of Plymouth being informed, they presently sent
for him to bring him to the Court, the person to whom that service was
committed, was a prudent and resolute Gentleman, the present Governor of the
said Colony, who was neither afraid of Danger, nor yet willing to delay in a
matter of that moment, he forthwith taking eight or ten stout men with him well
armed, intended to have gone to the said Alexanders dwelling, distant at least
forty miles from the Governors house, but by a good providence, he found him
whom he went to seek at an Hunting House, within six miles of the English
Towns, where the said Alexander with about eighty men were newly come in from
Hunting, and had left their Guns without doors, which Major Winslow with his
small company wisely seized, and conveyed away, and then went into the Wigwam,
and demanded Alexander to go along with him before the Governor, at which
message he was much appalld, but being told by the undaunted Messenger, that if
he stird or refused to go he was a dead man; he was by one of his chief
Counselors, in whose advice he most confided, persuaded to go along to the
Governors house, but such was the pride and height of his Spirit, that the
very surprizal of him, raised his Choler and indignation, that it put him into
a Fever, which notwithstanding all possible means that could be used, seemed
Mortal; whereupon entreating those that held him Prisoner, that he might have
liberty to return home, promising to return again if he recovered, and to send
his Son as Hostage till he could so do; on that consideration he was fairly
dismissed, but dyed before he got half way home: Here let it be observed, that
although some have taken up false Reports, as if the English had compelled him
to go further or faster then he was able, and so fell into a Fever, or as if
he were not well used by the Physician that looked to him, while he was with
the English, all which are notoriously false; nor is it to be imagined that a
person of so noble a disposition as is that Gentleman (at that time employed to
bring him) should himself, or suffer any else to be uncivil to a person allied
to them, by his own, as well as his Fathers League as the said Philip also was;
nor was any thing of that nature ever objected to the English of Plymouth, by
the said Alexanders Brother, by name Philip, commonly for his ambitious and
haughty Spirit nicknamed King-Philip, when he came in the year 1662. in his own
person with Sausaman his Secretary and chief Counselor to renew the former
league that had been between his Predecessors and the English of Plymouth: but
there was as much correspondence betwixt them for the next seven years as ever
had been in any former times, what can be imagined therefore, besides the
instigation of Satan, that either envied at the prosperity of the Church of God
here seated, or else fearing lest the power of the Lord Jesus, that had
overthrown his Kingdom in other parts of the World, should do the like here,
and so the stone taken out of the Mountain without hands, should become a great
Mountain it self, and fill the whole earth, no cause of provocation being given
by the English; For once before this in the year 1671 the Devil, who was a
Murderer from the beginning, had so filled the heart of this salvage Miscreant
with envy and malice against the English, that he was ready to break out into
open war against the Inhabitants of Plymouth, pretending some petite injuryes
done him in his planting land, but when the matter of controversy came to be
heard before diverse of the Massachusetts Colony, yea when he himself came to
Boston, as it were referring his case to the Judgment of that Colony, nothing
of that nature could be made to appear, whereupon in way of submission, he was
of necessity by that evident conviction forced to acknowledge that it was the
naughtiness of his own heart, that put him upon that Rebellion, and nothing of
any provocation from the English, and to a Confession of this nature, with a
solemn renewal of his Covenant, declaring his desire, that this his Covenant
might testify to the world against him, if ever he should prove unfaithful to
those of Plymouth, or any other of the Eng^sh Colonyes therein, himself with
his chief Counselors subscribed in the presence of some Messengers sent on
purpose to hear the difference between Plymouth and the said Philip. Bu^ for
further satisfaction of the Reader, the said Agreement and Submission shall
here be published.

Taunton, April 10th. 1671
Whereas my Father, my Brother and myself have formerly submitted our selves
and our People unto the Kings Majesty of England, and to this Colony of
New Plymouth, by solemn Covenant under our hand; but I having of late through
my indiscretion, and the naughtiness of my heart violated and broken this my
Covemant with my friends, by taking up Arms, with evil intent against them,
and that groundlesly, I being now deeply sensible of my unfaithfullness and
folly, do desire at this time solemnly to renew my Cov^nant with my ancient
Friends, and my Fathers Friends above mentioned, and do desire this may
testify to the world against me if ever I shall again fail in my Faithfulness
toward them (that I have now and at all times found so kind to me) or any
other of the English Colonyes; and as a real pledge of my true intentions, for
the future to be faithful and friendly, I do freely engage to resign up unto
the Government of New Plymouth, all my English Arms, to be kept by them for
their security, so long as they shall see reason. For true performance of the
premises I have hereunto set my hand together with the rest of my Council.

TO which for the further clearing the Justice of the present war, the Result
of the debate o^ the Commissioners of the united Colonyes about the matter of
the War shall here be inserted.

At a Meeting of the Commissioners of the united Colonyes held at Boston,
September 9 th. 1675.
WE having received from the Commissioners of Plymouth a Narrative, showing
the Rise and several steps of that Colony, as to the present War with the
Indians, which had its beginning there, and its progress into the Massachusetts,
by their insolences and outrages, murdering many persons, and burning their
Houses in sundry Plantations in both Colonies. And having duly considered the
same; do declare, that the said War does appear to be both just and necessary,
and its first Rise only a defensive War. And therefore we do agree and
conclude that it ought to be jointly prosecuted by all the united Colonies, and
the Charges thereof to be borne and paid as is agreed in the Articles of
Confederation.

Yet whatever his submission was before, or his subjecting himself and his
people to our King, or his engagement to pay a sum of money in part of the
Charges then occasioned by him (nor have the English in or about Plymouth,
since, or before that time been any ways injurious unto him, or any of his
people) all which are fully declared in a Narrative given by the Commissioners
of the Colony of Plymouth, wherein they also signify that the settlement and
issue of the former controversy between Philip and them, was obtained and made
(principally) by the mediation, and interposed advice and counsel of the other
two confederate Colonyes, and also in a letter under the Governors hand, in
these words, -- I think I can clearly say, that before these present troubles
broke out, the English did not possess one foot of Land in this Colony, but
what was fairly obtained by honest purchase of the Indian Proprietors: Nay,
because some of our people are of a covetous disposition, and the Indians are
in their Streights easily prevailed with to part with their Lands, we first
made a Law, that none should purchase or receive of gift any Land of the
Indians without the knowledge and allowance of our Court, and penalty of a
Fine, five pound per Acre, for all that should be so bought or obtained. And
lest yet they should be straightened, we Ordered that Mount-Hope, Pocasset and
several other Necks of the best land in the Colony (because most suitable and
convenient for them, should never be bought out of their hands or else they
would have sold them long since. And our neighbors at Rehoboth and Swanzy
although they bought their Lands fairly of this Philip and his Father and
Brother, yet because of their vicinity, that they might not trespass upon the
Indians, did at their own cost set up a very substantial Fence quite cross that
great Neck between the English and the Indians, and paid due damage if at any
time any unruly horse or other beasts brake in and trespassed. And for diverse
years last past (that all occasion of offense in that respect might be
prevented) the English agreed with Philip and his, for a certain sum yearly to
maintain the said Fence, and secure themselves. And if at any time they have
brought Complaints before us, they have had Justice impartial and speedily, so
that our own people have frequently complained, that we erred on the other hand
in showing them over much favor.

Jos. Winslow.
Marshfield, May 1. 1676.



Yet did this treacherous and perfidious Caitiffe still harbor the same or
more mischievous thoughts against the English then ever before, and has been
since that time plotting with all the Indians round about to make a general
insurrection against the English in all the Colonyes; which as some prisoners
lately brought in have confessed, should have been put in execution at once, by
all the Indians rising as one man, against all those plantations of English,
which were next them. The Narrhagansets having promised, as was confessed to
risewith 4 thousand fighting men in the Spring of this present year, 1676. But
by the occasion hereafter to be mentioned about Sausaman, Philip was
necessitated for the safety of his own life to b^gin his Rebellion the year
before, when the Design was not fully ripe. Yet some are ready to think, that
if his own life had not now been in jeopardy by the guilt of the foresaid
Murder of Sausaman, his heart might have failed him, when it should have come
to be pu^ in execu^ion, as it did before in the year 1671. which made one of
his Captains, of far better Courage and resolution then himself, when he saw
his cowardly temper and disposition, fling down his Arms, calling him white
Liver'd Curre, or to that purpose, and saying, that he would never own him
again, or fight under him; and from that time has turned to the English, and
has continued to this day a faithful and resolute Soldier in their quarrel.

That the Indians had a Conspiracy amongst themselves to rise against the
English, is confirmed by some of the Indians about Hadly, although the plot was
not come to maturity when Philip began, the special providence of God therein
over ruling the Contrivers: For when the beginning of the troubles first was
reported from Mount-Hope, many of the Indians were in a kind of a Maze, not
knowing well what to do, sometimes ready to stand for the English, as formerly
they had been wont to do; sometimes inclining to strike in with Philip (which
at the last they generally did) which if it had been foreseen, much of that
mischief might have been prevented that fell out in several places, more by
perfidious and treacherous dealing then any other ways: the English never
imagining that after so many obliging kindnesses received from them by the
Indians, besides their many engagements and protestatitions of friendship, as
formerly, they would have been so ungrateful, perfideously false and cruel as
they have since proved.

The occasion of Philips so sudden taking up arms the last year was this,
There was one John Sausaman a very cunning and plausible Indian well skilled in
the English language, and bred up in the profession of Christian Religion,
employed as a Schoolmaster at Natick, the Indian Town, who upon some
misdemeanour fled from his place to Philip, by whom he was entertained in the
room and office of a Secretary, and his chief Counselor, whom he trusted with
all his affairs and secret counsels: But afterward, whither upon the sting of
his own Conscience; or by the frequent Solicitations of Mr. Eliot, that had
known him from a child, and instructed him in the principles of our Religion,
who was often laying before him the heinous sin of his apostasy, and returning
back to his old vomit, he was at last prevailed with to forsake Philip, and
return back to the Christian Indians at Natick, where he was baptized
manifesting public Repentance for all his former offenses, and made a serious
Profession of the Christian Religion: and did apply himself to Preach to the
Indians, wherein he was better gifted then any other of the Indian Nation; so
as he was observed to conform more to the English manners then any other
Indian: yet having occasion to go up with some others of his Country men to
Namasket; whither for the advantage of Fishing, or some such occasion, it
matters not; being there not far from Philips Country, he had occasion to be
much in the Company of Philips Indians, and of Philip himself: by which means
he discerned by several circumstances, that the Indians were plotting anew
against us; the which out of faithfulness to the English, the said Sausaman
informed the Governor of, adding also, that if it were known that he revealed
it, he knew they would presently kill him. There appearing so many concurrent
testimonies from others, making it the more probable, that there was a certain
truth in the information; some inquiry was made into the business, by examining
Philip himself, and several of his Indians, who although they would own
nothing; yet could not free themselves from just suspicion; Philip therefore
soon after contrived the said Sausamans death, which was strangely discovered;
notwithstanding it was so cunningly effected, for they that murdered him met
him upon the Ice on a great Pond, and presently after they had knocked him
down, put him under the Ice, yet leaving his Gun and his Hat upon the Ice, that
it might be thought he fell in accidentally through the Ice and was drowned:
but being missed by his friends, who finding his Hat and his Gun, they were
thereby led to the place, where his body was found under the Ice: when they
took him up to bury him, some of his friends, specially one David observed some
bruises about his Head, which made them suspect he was first knocked down,
before he was put into the water, however, they buried him near about the place
where he was found, without making any further inquiry at present: nevertheless
David his friend, reported these things to some English at Taunton (a Town not
far from Namasket) it occasioned the Governor to inquire further into the
business, wisely considering, that as Sausaman had told him, that if it were
known, that he had revealed any of their plots, they would murder him for his
pains: wherefore by special Warrant the body of Sausaman being dug again out
of his Grave, it was very apparent that he had been killed and not drowned. And
by a strange providence, an Indian was found, that by accident standing unseen
upon a Hill, had seen them murdering the said Sausaman, but dir^t never reveal
it for fear of losing his own life likewise, until he was called to the Court
at Plymouth, or before the Governor, where he plainly confessed what he had
seen. The Murderers being apprehended, were convicted by his undeniable
Testimony, and other remarkable circumstances, and so were all put to death,
being but three in number; the last of them confessed immediately before his
death, that his Father (one of the Councellers and special Friends of Philip)
was one of the two that murdered Sausaman, himself only looking on. This was
done at Plymouth Court, held in June 1675. insomuch that Philip apprehending
the danger his own head was in next, never used any further means to clear
himself from what was like to be laid to his charge, either about his plotting
against the English, nor yet about Sausamans death: but by keeping his men
continually about him in Arms, and gathering what Strangers he could to join
with him, marching up and down constantly in Arms, both all the while the Court
sat, as well as afterward; the English of Plymouth hearing of all this, yet
took no further notice, then only to order a Military Watch in all the adjacent
Towns, hoping that Philip finding himself not likely to be Arraigned by Order
of the said Court, the present Cloud might blow over, as some others of like
nature had done before; but in conclusion, the matter proved otherwise, for
Philip finding his Strength daily increasing, by the flocking of
Neighbour-Indians unto him, and sending over their Wives and Children to the
Narhagansets for security (as they use to do when they intend War with any of
their Enemies) Immediately they began to Alarm the English at Swanzy (the next
Town to Philips Country) as it were daring the English to begin, at last their
insolences grew to such an height, that they begin not only to use threatening
words to the English, but also to kill their Cattle and rifle their houses;
whereat an Englishman was so provoked, that he let fly a Gun at an Indian, but
did only wound, not kill him, whereupon the Indians immediately began to kill
all the English they could, so as on the 24 th. of June 1675. was the Alarm of
War first sounded in Plymouth Colony, when eight or nine of the English were
slain in and about Swanzy: They first making a shot at a company of English as
they returned from the Assembly where they were met in way of Humiliation that
day, whereby they killed one and wounded others, and then likewise at the same
time, they slew two Men on the Highway, sent to call a Surgeon, and
barbarously the same day murdered six men in and about a dwelling House in an
other part of the Town, all which outrages were committed so suddenly, that the
English had no time to make any resistance: For on the 14 th. of the same
Month, besides endeavors used by Mr. Brown of Swanzy one of the Magistrates of
Plymouth Jurisdiction, an amicable Letter was sent from the Council of Plymouth
to Philip showing their dislike of his practices, and advising him to dismiss
his strange Indians, and not suffer himself to be abused by false Reports,
concerning them that intended him no hurt, but no answer could be obtained,
otherwise then threatening of War, which it was hoped might have been prevented,
as heretofore it had been, when things seemed to look with as bad face as then
they did. However the Governor and Council of Plymouth, understanding that
Philip continued in his resolution, and manifested no inclination to peace,
they immediately sent up what Forces they could to secure the Towns
thereabouts, and make resistance as occasion might be, and also dispatched away
Messengers to the Massachusetts Governor and Council, letting them know the
state of things about Mount-Hope: and desiring their speedy assistance: upon
which care was immediately taken with all expedition to send such supplies as
were desired: But in the mean time two Messengers were dispatched to Philip, to
try whether he could not be diverted from his bloody enterprise, so to have
prevented the mischief since fallen out, hoping, that as once before, viz. Anno
1671. by their mediation, a stop was put to the like Tragedy; so the present
war might by the same means have been now turned aside: For in the said year
Philip had fi^mly engaged himself, when he was at Boston, not to quarrel with
Plymouth until he had first addressed himself to the Massachusetts for advice
and approbation: But the two Messengers aforesaid, finding the men slain in the
Road June 24. as they were going for the Surgeon, apprehended it not safe to
proceed any further, considering also, that a peace now could not honorably be
concluded after such barbarous outrages committed upon some of the neighbor
Colony: Wherefore returning with all speed to Boston, the Massachuset Forces
were dispatched away with all immaginable have, as the ex^gent of the matter
did require, some of them being then upon, or ready for their March, the rest
were ordered to follow after, as they could be raised. The sending forth of
which, because it was the first engagement in any warlike preparations against
the Indians, shall be more particularly declared.

On the 26 th. of June a Foot-Company under Capt. Daniel Henchman, with a Troop
under Capt. Thomas Prentice, were sent out of Boston toward Mount-Hope; it
being late in the afternoon before they began to march, the central Eclipse of
the Moon in Capric. happened in the evening before they came up to Naponset
River, about twenty miles from Boston, which occasioned them to make an halt,
for a little repast, till the moon recovered her light again. Some melancholy
Fancyes would not be persuaded, but that the Eclipse falling out at that
instant of time, was ominous, conceiving also that in the center of the Moon
they discerned an unusual black spot, not a little resembling the scalp of an
Indian: As some others not long before, imagined they saw the form of an Indian
Bow, accounting that likewise ominous (although the mischief following was done
by Guns, not by Bows) both the one and the other, might rather have thought of
what Marcus Crassus the Roman General, going forth with an A^my against the
Parthians, once wisely replied to a private Soldier, that would have dissuaded
him from marching that time, because of an Eclipse of the Moon in Capricorn
[That he was more afraid of Sagitarius then of Capricornus] meaning the Arrows
of the Parthians (accounted very good Archers) from whom as things then fell
out, was his greatest danger. But after the Moon had waded through the dark
shadow of the Earth, and borrowed her Light again, by the help thereof, the two
Companies marched on toward Woodcocks House, thirty miles from Boston, where
they arrived next morning; and there retarded their motion till the afternoon,
in hope of being overtaken by a Company of Volunteers, under the Command of
Captain Samuel Mosely, which accordingly came to pass, so as on June 28 th.
they all arrived at Swanzy, where by the advice of Captain Cudworth, the
Commander in chief of Plymouth Forces, they were removed to the Headquarters;
which for that time were appointed at Mr. Miles his house, the Minister of
Swanzy, within a quarter of a mile of the Bridge, leading into Philips Lands.
They arriving there some little time before night, twelve of the Troop
unwilling to loose time passed over the Bridge, for discovery into the Enemies
Territories, where they found the rude welcome of eight or ten Indians firing
upon them out of the Bushes, killing one William Hammond, wounding Corporal
Belcher, his Horse being also shot down under him; the rest of the said Tropers
having discharged upon those Indians that ran away after their first shot,
carried off their two dead and wounded Companions, and so re^ti^ed to the main
Guard for that night, pitching in a Barricado about Mr. Miles his house. The
Enemy thought to have braved it out by a bold assauld or two at the first; but
their hearts soon began to fail them when they perceived the Massachusetts and
Plymouth Forces both engaged against them: for the next mo^ning they shouted
twice or thrice, at half a miles distance, and nine or ten of them showing
themselves on this side the Bridge: our Horsemen with the whole body of the
Privateers under Captain Mosely, not at all daunted by such kind of Alarms, nor
willing so to loose the Bridge, ran violently down upon them over the said
Bridge, pursuing them a mile and quarter on the other side: Ensign Savage,
that young Martial Spark, scarce twenty years of age, had at that time one
bullet lodged in his Thigh, another shot through the brims of his Hat, by ten
or twelve of the Enemy discharging upon him together, while he boldly held up
his Colors in the Front of his Company: but the weather not suffering any
further action at that time, those that were thus far advanced, were compelled
to retreat back to the main Guard, having first made a shot upon the Indians as
they ran away into a Swamp nearby, whereby they killed five or six of them, as
was understood soon after at Narhaganset: This resolute charge of the English
Forces upon the Enemy made them quit their place on Mount-Hope that very night,
where Philip was never seen after; till the next year, when he was by a divine
Mandate sent back: there to receive the reward of his wickedness where he first
began his mischief: the next day Major Savage (that was to command in chief
over the Massachuset Forces, being come up with other Supplies about six a
clock over night) the whole Body intended to march into Mount-Hope, and there
beat up the Enemies quarters, or give him Battle, if he durst abide it: but the
weather being doubtful, our Forces did not march till near noon, about which
time they set out, with a Troop of Horse in each wing, to prevent the danger of
the Enemies Ambuscadoes; after they had marched about a mile and and half, they
passed by some Houses newly burned: not far of one of them they found a Bible
newly torn, and the leaves scattered about by the Enemy, in hatred of our
Religion therein revealed; two or three miles further they came up with some
Heads, Scalps, and Hands cut off from the bodies of some of the English, and
stuck upon Poles near the Highway, in that barbarous and inhumane manner
bidding us Defyance, the Commander in chief giving Order that those monuments
of the Enemies cruelty should be taken down, and buried: the whole body of the
Forces still marched on, two miles further, where they found diverse Wigwams of
the Enemy, amongst which were many things scattered up and down, arguing the
hasty flight of the Owners; half a mile further, as they passed on through many
Fields of stately Corn, they found Philips own Wigwam; every place giving them
to perceive the Enemies hasty departure from thence; after they had marched two
miles further they came to the Sea side, yet in all this time meeting with no
Indians, nor any sign of them, unless of their flight to some other places. The
season like to prove very tempestuous, and rainy, Captain Cudworth with some of
the men of Plymouth passed over to Road-Island. The Forces under Major Savage
were forced to abide all night in the open Field, without any shelter,
notwithstanding the abundance of rain that fell, and in the morning, despairing
to meet with any enemy on Mount-Hope, they retreated back to their Quarters at
Swanzy, in the way meeting with many Indian dogs, that seemed to have lost
their Masters. That night Capt. Prentice his Troop for convenience of Quarters,
as also for discovery, was dismissed to lodge at Seaconke or Rehoboth, a Town
within six miles of Swanzy. As they returned back in the morning, Capt.
Prentice divided his Troop, delivering one half to Leiutenant Oak^s, and
keeping the other himself, who as they rode along, espied a company of Indians
burning an house; but could not pursue them by reason of several Fences, that
they could not go over till the Indians had escaped into a Swampe. Those with
Leiutenant Oaks had the like discovery, but with better success, as to the
advantage of the ground, so as pursuing of them upon a plain, they slew four or
five of them in the Chase, whereof one was known to be Thebe a Sachem of
Mount-Hope, another of them was a chief Counselor of Philips; yet in this
attempt the Lieutenant lost one of his company, John Druce by name, who was
mortally wounded in his bowels, whereof he soon after dyed, to the great grief
of his companions. After the said Troop came up to the Headquarters at Swanzy,
they understood from Capt. Cudworth that the enemy were discovered upon
Pocass^t, an other neck of Land lying over an arm of the Sea, more toward
Cap^e Cod: However it was resolved that a more narrow search should be made
after them, both upon Mount-Hope, and upon the ground between Swanzy and
Rehoboth to scour the Swamps, and assault them if they could find where they
were entrenched. Capt. Henchman and Capt. Prentice were ordered to search the
Swamps, while Capt. Mosely and Capt. Paige with his Dragoons attending on Major
Savage, should return back into Mount-hope that they might be sure to leave
none of the enemy behind them, when they should remove to pursue them elsewhere.

About ten a clock the next morning, July. 4. Capt. Henchman after a long and
tedious March, came to the Headquarters, and informed that he came upon a
place where the enemy had newly been that night, but were escaped out of his
reach: But that night before they were determined of any other motion, Capt.
Hutchinson came up from Boston with new Orders for them to pass into
Narrhaganset, to treat with the Sachems there, and if it might be, to prevent
their joining with Philip. Capt. Cudworth, by this time was come up to the Head
Quarters, having left a Garrison of forty men upon Mount-Hope Neck. The next
morning was spent in consultation how to carry on the Treaty; it was then
resolved, that they should go to make a peace with a Sword in their hands,
having no small ground of suspicion that the said Narhagansets might join with
the enemy wherefore, they thought it necessary to carry all the Massachuset
Forces over into the Narhaganset Country, to fight them if there should be
need, Capt. Mosely passed over by water to attend Capt. Hutchinson in his
dispatch; the other Companys with the Troopers riding round about: as they
passed they found the Indidians in Pomhams Country (next adjoining to Philips
Borders) all fled, and their Wigwams without any people in them.

After they came to the Narhaganset Sachems, three or four days were spent in
a treaty, after which a peace was concluded on sundry Articles between the
Messengers of Connecticut Colony (who were ordered to meet with those of the
Massachusetts) and the Commanders of the Forces sent against Philip: Hostages
were also given by the said Narhagansets for the performance of the agreement.
A Copy of the said Agreement, and the Articles on which a Peace was concluded,
here follow. It being always understood, that Plymouth Colony was included in
the said Agreement, although their Forces were not then present, but remained
at home near the enemies Borders, to secure their Towns, and oppose Philip as
there might be occasion, if he offered to make any new attempt in the mean time.

ARticles, Covenants and Agreements had, made and concluded by and between
Major Thomas Savage, Captain Edward Hutchinson, and Mr. Joseph Dudley, in
behalf of the Government of the Massachusetts Colony, and Major Wait Winthrop and
Mr. Richard Smith on behalf of Connecticut Colony on the one party, and
Agamaug, Wompsh, alias Corman, Taitson, Tawageson Counselors and Attournies to
Canonicus, Ninigret, Matataog, old Queen Quai^pen, Quananshit and Pomham the
six present Sachims of the whole Narhaganset Country on the other party,
referring to several differences and troubles lately risen between them; and
for a final conclusion of settled Peace and Amity between the said Sachims,
their Heirs and Successors for ever, and the Governors of the said
Massachusetts and Connecticot, and their Successors in the said Governments for
ever.

I. That all and every of the said Sachims shall from time to time carefully
seize, and living or dead deliver unto one or other of the abovesaid
Goverments, all and every of Sachim Philips Subjects whatsoever, that shall
come or be found within the precincts of any of their Lands, and that with
greatest diligence and faithfulness.

II. That they shall with their utmost ability use all Acts of Hostility
against the said Philip and his Subjects, entering his Lands or any other Lands
of the English, to kill and destroy the said Enemy, until a cess^tion from War
with the said Enemy be concluded by both the abovesaid Colonies.

III. That the said Sachims, by themselves and their Agents, shall carefully
search out and deliver all stolen goods whatsoever taken by any of their
Subjects from any of the English, whether formerly or lately, and shall make
full satisfaction for all wrongs or injuries done to the Estate of any of the
Subjects of the several Colonies, according to the judgment of indifferent
men, in case of dissatisfaction between the Offenders and the offended Parties,
or deliver the offenders.

IV. That all Preparations for War, or Acts of Hostility against any of the
English Subjects, shall for ever for the future cease; together with all manner
of Thef^s, Pilferings, killing of Cattle, or any manner of breach of peace
whatsoever shall with utmost care be prevented, and instead thereof their
strength to be used as a Guard round about the Narraganset Country, for the
English Inhabitants safety and security.

V. In token of the abovesaid Sachims reality in this Treaty and Conclusion,
and for the security of the several English Goverments and Subjects, they do
freely deliver unto the abovesaid Gentlemen, in the behalf of the abovesaid
Colonies, John Wobequob, Weowthim, Pewkes, Weenew, four of their near Kinsmen
and choice Friends to be and remain as Hostages in several places of the
English Jurisdictions, at the appointment of the Honorable Governors of the
abovesaid Colonies, there to be civilly treated not as Prisoners, but otherwise
at their Honors Discretion, until the abovesaid Articles, are fully
accomplished to the satisfaction of the several Goverments, the departure of
any of them in the mean time to be accounted breach of the Peace, and of these
present Articles.

VI. The said Gentlemen in the behalf of the Goverments to which they do
belong, do engage to every the said Sachims and their Subjects, that if they or
any of them shall seize and bring into either the abovesaid English Goverments,
or to Mr. Smith Inhabitants of Narhaganset, Philip Sachim alive, he or they so
delivering, shall receive for their pains, forty Trucking cloth Coats, in case
they bring his Head they shall have twenty like good Coats paid them: for every
living Subject of said Philips so delivered, the deliverer shall receive two
Coats, and for every Head one Coat, as a Gratutty for their service herein,
making it appear to satisfaction, that the Heads or Persons are belonging to
the Enemy, and that they are of their seizure,

VII. The said Sachims do renew and confirm unto the English Inhabitants or
others, all former Graunts, Sales, Bargains or Conveyances of Lands, Meadows,
Timber, Grass, Stones, or whatever else the English have heretofore bought or
quietly possessed and enjoyed to be unto them, and their Heirs, and Assigns for
ever; as also all former Articles made with the Confederate Colonies.

Lastly, The said Counselors and Attorneys do premeditately, seriously, and
upon good advice, Covenant, Conclude and Agree all abovesaid solemnly, and call
God to witness they are, and shall remain true Friends to the English
Goverments, and perform the abovesaid Articles punctually, using their utmost
endeavor, care and faithfulness therein: In witness whereof they have set
their Hands and Seals.

During this Treaty of Peace with the Narhagansets, Captain Cudworth with the
Forces of Plymouth under his Command, found something to do nearer home, though
of another nature as it proved, sc. to make War whilst the other were (as they
thought) making peace: in the first place therefore he dispatched Captain
Fuller) joining Lieutenant Church together with him in Commission) with fifty
in his Company to Pocasset, on the same account, as the other went to
Narhaganser; either to conclude a Peace with them, if they would continue
Friends, and give Hostages for the confirmation thereof, or fight them if they
should declare themselves Enemies, and join with Philip; himself intending to
draw down his Forces to Rehoboth, to be ready for a speedy March to Taunton,
and so down into the other side of the Country upon the news that some of the
Enemy were burning and spoiling of Middleburrough and Dartmouth, two small
Villages lying in the way betwixt Pocasset and Plymouth. Upon thursday July 7.
Captain Fuller with Captain Church went into Pocasset to seek after the Enemy,
or else as occasion might serve, to treat with those Indians at Pocasset, with
whom Mr. Church was very well acquainted; always holding good correspondence
with them: After they had spent that day and most of the night, in traversing
the said Pocasset Neck, and Watching all night in an House which they found
there, yet could hear no tidings of any Indians; insomuch that Captain Fuller
began to be weary of his design: Mr. Church in the mean while assuring him that
they should find Indians before it were long: yet for greater expedition they
divided their Company, Captain Fuller taking down toward the Seaside, where it
seems after some little skirmishing with them, wherein one man only received a
small Wound, he either saw or heard too many Indians for himself and his
Company to deal with, which m^de him and them betake themselves to an House
near the Waterside, from whence they were fetched off by a Sloop before night
to Road-Island. Captain Church (for so may he well be styled after this time)
marched further into the Neck, imagining that if there were Indians in the
Neck, they should find them about a peas-field not far off: as soon as ever
they came near the said field he espied two Indians in the pease, who also had
at the same time espied him, and presently making some kind of shout, a great
number of Indians came about the field, pursuing the said Capt. Church and his
men in great numbers to the sea side: there being not above fifteen with
Church, yet seven or eight score of the Indians pursuing after them. Now was a
fit time for this young Captain and his small Company to handsel their valor
upon this great rout of Indians, just ready to devour them: But victory stands
no more in the number of Soldiers, then Verity in the plurality of voices: And
although some of these fifteen had scarce courage enough for themselves, yet
their Captain had enough for himself, and some to spare for his friends, which
he there had an opportunity of improving to the full. When he saw the hearts of
any of his followers to fail, he would bid them be of good Courage and fight
stoutly, and (possibly by some divine impression upon his heart) assured them
not a bullet of the enemy should hurt any one of them; which one of the
Company, more dismayed then the rest, could hardly believe, till he saw the
proof of it in his own person, for the Captain perceiving the man was notable
to fight, made him gather Rocks together for a kind of shelter and Baricadoe
for the rest, that must either of necessity fight or fall by the enemies. It
chanced as this faint-hearted soldier had a flat stone in his arms, and was
carrying it to the shelter that he was making upon the Bank, a bullet of the
Enemy was thus warded from his Body by which he must else have perished, which
experience put new life into him, so as he followed his business very manfully
afterward, insomuch that they defended themselves under small defense hastily
made up all that afternoon, not one being either slain or wounded, yet it was
certainly known that they killed at least fifteen of their Enemies: and at the
last, when they had spent all their Ammunition, and made their Guns
unserviceable by often firing, they were fetched all off by Capt. Goldings
Sloop, and carried safe to Road-Island in despite of all their Enemies; yea,
such was the bold and undaunted courage of this Champion Capt. Church, that he
was not willing to leave any token behind of their flying for want of courage,
that in the face of his Enemies he went back to fetch his Hat, which he had
left at a Spring, whether the extreme heat of the weather, and his labor in
fighting had caused him to repair for the quenching of his thirst an hour or
two before. It seems in the former part of the same day, five men coming from
Road-Island, to look up their Cattle upon Pocasset Neck, were assaulted by the
same Indians, and one of the five was Capt. Churches Servant, who had his Leg
broke in the Skirmish, the rest hardly escaping with their lives: this was the
first time that ever any mischief was done by the Indians upon Pocasset Neck.
Those of Road-Island were hereby Alarmed to look to themselves, as well as the
rest of the English of Plymouth, or the Massachusetts Colony.

This Assault rather heightened and increased then daunted the courage of Capt.
Church; for not making a cowardly flight, but a fair retreat, which providence
offered him by the Sloop aforesaid, after his Ammunition was spent, he did not
stay long at Road-Island, but hasted over to the Mattachuset Forces, and
borrowing three files of Men of Capt. Henchman with his Lieutenant: Mr. Church
and he returned again to Pocasset, where they had another skirmish with the
Enemy, wherein some few of them fourteen or fifteen were slain, which struck
such a terror into Philip, that he be ^ook himself to the Swamps about
Pocasset, where he lay hid till the return of the rest of the Forces from the
Narhagansets, like a wild Boar kept at a Bay by this small party till more
hands came up.

Thus were the Plymouth Forces busied, during the time of the Treaty with the
Narhagansets, which being issued as it was.

On Friday July 15. Our Forces Marched for, and araived at Rehoboth where
having no intelligence of the Enemy nearer then a great Swamp o^ Pocasset,
eighteen miles from Taunton; they marched next day twelve miles to an House at
Matapoiset (a small Neck of Land in the bottom of Taunton Bay, in the midway
between Mount-hope and Pocasset Neck) from whence they marched for Taunton.
July 17. whither after a tedious March of twenty miles they came in the
evening, and found the People generally gathered into eight Garrison Houses:

On Monday July 18. they Marched eighteen miles before they could reach the
Swamp where the Enemy was lodged; as soon as ever they came to the place,
Plymouth Forces being now joined with them, our Soldiers resolutely entered in
amongst the Enemies, who took the advantage of the thick under-wood, to make a
shot at them that first entered whereby five were killed outright, seven more
wounded, some of whose wounds proved mortal: After the first shot, the Enemy
presently retired deeper into the Swamp, deserting their Wagwams (about an
hundred in all) newly made of green Barks, so as they would not burn: in one of
them they found an old man, who confessed that Philip had been lately there:
having spent some time in searching the Swamp, and tired themselves to no
purpose, yet it was said one half hour more would have at that time utterly
subdued Philip and all his power. The Commander in chief, (night drawing on
apace) not thinking it safe to tarry longer in so dangerous a place, (where
every one was in as much danger of his fellows as of his foes, being ready to
fire upon every Bush they see move (supposing Indians were there) ordered a
Retreat to be sounded, that they might have time to dispose of their dead and
wounded men, which accordingly was attended: Plymouth Forces who had entered in
the rear, retreating in the front. It was judged that the Enemy being by this
means brought into a Pound, it would be no hard matter to deal with them, and
that it would be needless charge to keep so many Companies of Soldiers
together to wait upon such an inconsiderable Enemy, now almost as good as
taken: whereupon most of the Companies belonging to ^he Massachusetts were drawn
off, only Capt. Henchman with an hundred Foot being left there, together with
Plymouth Forces, to attend the Enemies motion, being judged sufficient for that
end. Major Savage, Capt. Paige with Capt. Mosely and their Companies returned
to Boston: Capt. Prentice with his Troop were ordered toward Mendham, where it
seems, about the middle of July, some Indians, wishing well to Philips design,
had made an ^ssaul^ upon some of the Inhabitants, as they were at their labor
in the Field, killing five or six of them: as soon as they had done, flying
away into the Woods, so as they could not easily be pursued: The Inhabitants of
the same Village, lying so in the heart of the Enemies Country began to be
discouraged, so as within a little time after they forsook the place,
abandoning their Houses to the fury of the enemy, which by them were soon after
turned into ashes. But to return to king Philip, who was now lodged in the
great swampe upon Pocass^ N^ck, of seven miles long: Capt. Henchman and the
Plymouth Forces k^p a diligent eye upon the enemy, but were not willing to run
into the mi^e and dirt after them in a dark Swamp being taught by late
experience how dangerous it is to fight in such dismal Woods, when their eyes
were muffled with the leaves, and their heads pinnioned with the thick boughs
of the trees, as their feet were continually shackled with the roots spreading
every way in those boggy Woods. It is ill fighting with a wild Beast in his
own den. They resolved therefore to starve them out of the Swamp, where they
knew full well they could not long subsist: To that end they began to build a
Fort, as it were to beleaguer the enemy, and prevent his escape out of the
place, where they thought they had him fast enough. Philip in the mean time was
not ignorant of what was doing without, and was ready therein to read his own
doom, so as if he tarryed much longer there, he knew he should fall into their
hands from whom he could expect no mercy: The case being therefore desperate,
he resolved with an hundred or two of his best fighting men to make an escape
by the Water, all passages by the land being sufficiently guarded by the
E^glish Forces. The Swampe where they were lodged being not far from an arm of
the Sea, coming up to Taunton, they taking the advantage of a low tide, either
waded over one night in the end of July, or else wafted themselves over upon
small Rafts of timber very early before break of day, by which means the
greatest part of his Company escaped aw^y into the woods, leading into the
Nipmuck Country, altogether unknown to the English Forces, that lay encamped on
the other side of the Swamp. About an hundred or more of the women and
Children, which were like to be rather burdensome then serviceable were left
behind, who soon after resigned up themselves to the mercy of the English.
Philips escape thus from Pocasset could not long be concealed after the day
appeared, there being much champaign Land through which he was to pass, so as
being discovered to some of R^hoboth, the Inhabitants presently followed him,
together with a Party of the Mohegins (that a little before came to Boston,
off^ring their Service against Philip, and were sent up into those parts to be
o^dered by Capt. Henchman but before they came to him were easily persuaded to
go along with any of the English that were engaged in the pursuit of Philip)
News also thereof was carried to Capt. Henchman, who as soon as he could get
over with six files of men (rowing hard all or most part of the day to get to
Providence) followed after the enemy. The Mohegins with the men of Rehoboth,
and some of Providence came upon their Rear over night, sl^w about thirty of
them, took much plunder from them, without any considerable loss to the
English. Capt. Henchman came not up to them (pursuing them only by the Track)
till the Skirmish was over, and having marched twenty two miles that day was
not well able to go any further that night; on the other hand, the Forces that
came from Rehoboth and that belonged to Plymouth, having left their horses
three miles off could not go back to fetch them without much loss of time, and
therefore looking at it altogether bootless to go after them in the morning,
returned back the next day, leaving Capt Henchman with his six Files, and the
Mohegins to pursue the Chase to Nipsatchet, which he did the next morning.
Capt. Henchman, that he might the better engage the Mohegins to march with him
thirty miles gave them half his provision, and was himself recruited again by
the care of Capt. Edmunds of Providence, and Leiutenant Brown, who brought
provision after him to the N^pmuck Forts. Mr. Newman the Minister of Rehoboth
deserved not a little Commendation for exciting his neighbors and friends to
pursue thus far after Philip, animating of them by his own example and
presence: But what the reason was why Philip was followed no further, it is
better to suspend, then too critically to enquire. This is now the third time
when a good opportunity of suppressing the Rebellion of the Indians, was put
into the hands of the English; but time and chance happens to all men, so that
the most likely means are often frustrated of their desired end. All humane
endeavors shall arive at no other success, then the Counsel of God has
preordained, that no flesh might glory in their own Wisdom, but give unto God
the praise of all their Sucesses, and quietly bear whatever Miscariages he has
ordered to befall them. It appears by the issue of these things, that although
this wound was not incurable, yet much more blood must be taken away before it
could be healed. But by this means Philip escaped away to the Westward,
kindling the flame of War in all the Western plantations of the Massachusetts
Colony wherever he came, so that by this fatal accident, the fire that was in a
likely way to be extinguished, as soon almost' as it began, did on the sudden
break out through the whole Jurisdiction of the Massachusetts, both Eastward and
Westward, endangering also the neighbor Colony of Connecticut, which has also
suffered somewhat by the sury of this Flame, though not considerable to what
the other Colonyes have undergone.

While things after this manner proceeded in and about the Colony of Plymouth,
the Commissioners of the rest of the Colonyes were consulting and advising what
was to be done for preventing the mischief threatened from spreading any
further, fearing (as indeed there was too much cause) that although Philip only
appeared to make the first attempt yet more either already were, or soon might
be be persuaded to join with him in acting this bloody Tragedy.

It has been already declared what has been done for the securing of the
Narhagansets, those that were sent as Messengers on that errand, always
reported that the elder people were in appearance, not only inclinable to
peace, but seemed very desirous thereof, insomuch as their two eldest Sachems
expressed much joy when it was concluded; but as since has appeared, all this
was but to gain time, and cover their treacherous intents and purposes, that
they might in the next Spring fall upon the English plantations all at once, as
some prisoners lately brought in have owned and confessed; nor have any of
those Indians with whom the present War has been, ever regarded any agreements
of peace made with the English, further then out of necessity and slavish fear
they were compelled thereunto, as may be seen by the Records of the united
Colonyes from the year 1643 to the present time, notwithstanding all their fair
pretenses, for Ninigret, the old Sachem of the Narhagansets, who alone of all
the rest of that Country Sachems disowned the present war, and refused to have
any hand therein, yet was it proved to his face be-before the Commissioners, in
the years 1646 and 1647, that he had threatened they would carry on the war
against the Mohegins, whatever were the mind of the Commissioners, and that
they would kill the English Cattle, and heap them up as high as their Wigwams,
and that an English man should not stir out of his doors to piss, but they
would kill him; all which he could not deny; yet did this old Fox make many
promises of peace; when the dread of the English ever since the Pequod-war
moved him thereunto; foreseeing as he is said to have told his neighbors, that
they would all be ruined if they made War with the English, as is since come to
pass. However the good hand of God was seen in so ordering things, that the
Narhagansets were for the present restrained from breaking out into open
Hostility against the English, at that time when Philip b^gan which if they had
then done, according to the eye of reason, it would have been very difficult,
if possible for the English to have saved any of their inland plantations from
being utterly destroyed. Thus has God in his Wisdom suffered so much of the
rage of the Heathen to be let loose against his people here, as to become a
Scourge unto them, that by the wrath of men, praise might be yielded to his
holy Name, yet has he in his abundant goodness restrained the remainder that
it should not consume.

The next thing in order to be related, is the calamity that befell the Village
of Brookfi^ld which notwithstanding all the care that was taken, ^ell into the
hands of the perfideous Nipnet Indians, as shall here in the nex^ place be
declared; only as we pass along to remind the Reader in a few words, what was
the issue of Capt. Henchmans pursuit of Philip: the Plymouth Forces being
returned home, as was said before, Capt. Henchman with his six ^iles of men,
and the Mohegin Indians, having continued in the pursuit of Philip till they
had spent all their provision, and tired themselves, yet never coming within
sight of Philip, the Mohegin Indians in their Company direct^d them to Mendham,
and then leaving them, returned also to their own Country. Capt. Henchman in
his ma^ch toward Mendham, or at Mendham, met with Capt. Mosely coming up to
bring him Provision, and advertizing him of what success he had met withal in
the pursuit; they attend their course, for Captain H^nchman was sent down to
the Governor and Council, to know what they should do: they presently rem^nded
him to Pocasset, and ordered him to stay there if there were need, or else to
draw off, surrendering the Fort he had been building to Plymouth Forces, which
last was chosen by those of Plymouth, whereupon Capt. Henchman returning to
Boston, was ordered to disband his m^n. Capt. Mosely was ordered to march to
Quabaog or Brookfield, where he continued a while, the other Captains sent up
for the relief of the People there, and to seek after the Enemy in those Woods,
and after some time spent in ranging the Country thereabouts, and not meeting
with any of the Infidels, he with his Company came downwards, searching the
Woods betwixt Lancaster (where a Man and his Wife with two Children were slain
on the Lord's Day, Aug. 22.) and Malberough, where also a Lad keeping Sheep, was
shot at by an Indian that wore a sign, as if he had been a Friend: the Indian
was supposed to belong to the Hassanemesit Indians, at that time confined to
Melberough, where they had liberty to dwell there in ^k^d of a Fort: The next
day the Inhabitants sent to demand their G^ns, Capt. Mosely acquainted
therewith, marched to the Fort and found much suspicion against eleven of them,
for singing and dancing, and having Ballets and Slugs, and much Powder hid in
t^i ^aske^s; insomuch that eleven of them were seat down Prisoners to Boston
upon suspicion, that they had an hand in killing the four at Lancaster and
shooting at the Malberough Shepherd: But upon T^yal, the said Prisoners were
all of them quitted from the Fact and were either released, or else were with
others of that sort, sent for better security and for preventing future trouble
in the like kind to some of the island, below Boston toward Nantasket.

About this time Capt. Mosely was sent with a Company of Soldiers to some
Indian Plantations up Merri^ack River, as high as Penny-cook, but they found no
Indians there; thos^ that belonged to the place having withdrawn themselves
from that Na^ive place, that they might not meddle in the prese it quarrel, as
is confidently believed that Woonalanset the Sachim of that Country had so
resolved. That Coast being clear of the Enemies, Capt. Mosely soon after was
sent up with his Men to the Towns Westward about Haaly, if it might be, to
subdue the Enemy, who a little before, and at that time, was doing all the
mischief he could in those Western Plantations, both by Fire and Sword.

But to return and pursue the Rebelious Indians, and keep pace with them in our
History, though our Forces as yet could never overtake them in the Woods. The
Governor and Council of the Massachusetts were sensible of as much danger from
the N^pnet Indians, as from the former: they being the Inland part of the
Country betwixt the Seacoast and Connecticut River Westward, and the Towns
about the Massachusetts Bay Eastward, whereupon some persons that used to Trade
with the said Nipnets, were sent to sound them, and find how they stood
affected, for which also there was the more reason, because they were always
in subject on to the Sachim of Mount Hop^, and so were the more like to engage
in the present quarrel; of which there had been sufficient proof already: when
on the 14. of July, some of the Nipnet Indians next bordering on Philips
Country, set upon some of Mendham (a Town situate Northward from Mount-Hope,
within 36^ Miles from Boston,) where they killed four or five persons which was
the first mischief done upon any of the Inhabitants within the Jurisdiction of
the Massachusetts, ^cted as was said by one Matoonas who was Father to him that
had committed a murder soon after Philips first Rebellion, An. 1671. The
Messenger that was sent thither, brought word back that they found the said
Indians wavering; the young men very surly and insolent, the elder ones,
showing some inclination to maintain the wonted peace: Soon after, July
28.1675. Capt. Wheeler was sent to assist (Capt. Hutchinson with a party of
twenty Horse to Treat further about the Peace, who going first to Quabaog or
Brookfield, a Town situate about sixty or seventy miles from Boston, in the
Road of Connecticot. lying about twenty five miles from the said River, and not
far distant from the chief seat of the Nipnet Indians. The Inhabitants of the
said Brook field had been so delu^d by those Treacherous Villains, that they
fearing no danger, first ob^ined of those Nipnets, the promise of a Treaty upon
the second of August, whereupon some of the chief of the Town riding along
unarmed with the said Wheeler and Hutchinson, with their party of Horse until
they came to the place appointed, but finding no Indians, so secure were they,
that they ventured along further, to fine the Infidels at their chief Town,
never suspecting the least danger, but when they had rode four or five miles
that way, they fell into an Ambush, of two or three hundred Indians, laid in
such a narrow passage, betwixt a steep hill on the one hand, and an hideous
Swamp on the other, that it was scarce possible for any of them to escape,
eight of them being shot down upon the place (whereof three were of
Brookefield) and three mortally wounded whereof Capt. Hutchinson was one, Cap.
Wheeler also was near loosing his life, whose horse was shot down under him,
and himself shot through the body, so that all manner of hopes to escape had
been removed from him, had it not been for his Son, who was (by Gods good
providence) near or next unto him, being a man of undaunted courage
(notwithstanding his own Arm was broken with a Bullet) yet with great
nimbleness and agility of body, dismounting himself, speedily mounted his
Father upon his own Horse, himself getting upon an other, whose Master was
killed, by which means they both escaped, and were afterward cured. Much ado
had those that were left alive to recover Brookefield, which in all probability
they had never done (the common Road being way laid with Indians on every side
as was afterward known) had it not been for one well acquainted with those
Woods, who led them in a by path, by which means they got thither, a little
before the Indians, who quickly came flocking into the Town, with full intent
to destroy it with fire and Sword. But by special providence the Inhabitants
were all gathered to the principal house of the Village (there being scarce
twenty in the Town) before the barbarons Miscrean^s came upon them, immediately
setting fire upon all the dwelling houses, with most of the other Buildings in
the Town save that one into which the Inhabitants were retired, the which they
several times attempted to born, but were almost miraculously defeated of their
purpose by the immediate hand of God. In the Mount of the Lord it shall be
seen. For when they had for two days assaulted that poor handful of helpless
people, both night and day pouring in shot upon them incessantly with gunns,
and also thrusting poles with Firebrarnds, and rags dipped in brimstone tied to
the ends of them to fire the house.

At last they used this devilish Stratagem, to fill a Cart with hemp, flax and
other combustible matter, and so thrusting it backward with poles spliced
together a great length, after they had kindled it; But as soon as it had begun
to take fire, a Storm of rain unexpectedly falling, p^t out the Fire, or else
all the poor people, about seventy souls, would either have been consumed by
merciless flames, or else have fallen into the hands of their cruel enemies,
like Wolves continually yelling and gaping for their prey.

Thus was that distressed Company strangely delivered, who have for ever cause
to say with the Psalmist, Blessed be the Lord, who has not given us a prey to
their teeth, our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the Fowlers, the
snare is broken and we are escaped. For the next night Major Willard, by
accident hearing of the danger the People were in, as (...), came with forty
eight Dragoons to their relief. The occasion which brought Major Willard and
Capt. Parker of Groton with forty six more, so timely to their relief was this
Major Willard in pursuance of his Commission from the Governor and Council,
was upon Wednesday August the 4 th in the morning, marching out after some
Indians to the Westward, to secure them: just as they were setting forth, some
of Malberough, who had intelligence by those that were going to Connecticot,
and forced to return, what distress Brookfield was in, and knowing of Major
Willards purpose to go out that morning from Lancaster, sent a Post to acquaint
him therewith, which though it did not find him in the Town, yet overtook him
before he had gone above four or five miles from the place: whereupon,
conceiving it more needful to succor Brookfield in so eminent danger, then to
proceed further upon his intended design: he altered his course and marched
directly thither, being about thirty miles distant when the tidings were
brought him; so he arrived there that night very seasonably, about an hour
after it was dark, or else in probability they had all perished before the
relief sent up from Boston could have reached them, which was not till three
days after. The providence of God l^kewise in bringing in the said Major so
safely, as well as seasonably to their relief, was very remarkable. For the
Indians had subtly contrived to cut off all relief sent, before it could come
at them, by laying Ambushes, and placing their Scours, at two or three miles
distance round the Town: About an hundred of them were lodged at an house not
far off in the way toward Boston, to cut off any Succor that might come from
thence: but it is supposed they were so intense upon the Project they were
about for firing the House, conclud^ng it would without fail take place, that
either they did not mind their business of Watching, or making such a no^se
for joy thereof, that they did not hear their Sentinels when they shot off
their Guns, at two miles d^stance. It is said that another party of the
Indians, let the Major and his Company purposely pass by them, without any
opposition, waiting for the blow to be given at their first approach near the
house, then to have themselves fallen upon their Rear, and so to have out them
all off, before the besieged understood any thing thereof. But it pleased God
so to order things in providence, that to notice was taken of them b^ the
Besiege^s, nor were they at all discerned by them till they had made themselves
k^own to their Friends; and were admitted within the Court of Guard; which when
the Enemy had notice of, they poured in their sh^t abundantly upon them; but
they were now sheltered from the danger thereof: only it seems their Houses
were expos^d to their fury, so as many of them were ^maimed and killed, as were
most of the Cattle belonging to the Inhabitants of the place soon after. This
Honored Person Major Willard continued at Brookfield after this famous exploit
for the preservation of the poor besieged at Brookfield, diverse weeks to order
such Companies as were sent up that way for the securing of the Plantations on
that side of the Country; and not long after he went himself also to Hadly upon
the like service of the Country in the present War: But after some time spent
in those parts, he returned back to his own place, to order the affairs of his
own Regiment, much needing his presence, and leaving the Forces about Hadly
under the command of the Major of that Regiment.

But to return to what was in hand before, after the Indians understood that
succors were come in to the beseiged, they fired all that they had left
standing for their own shelter while they had beseiged the place before
mentioned, ran all away into their own dens, in the neighboring woods: however
it was confessed by one of themselves, that the enemy had eighty of their men
killed and wounded in this business. But ere we pass any further in pursuit of
the History of these matters, it will not be amiss to let the Reader understand
the horrible perfidious and treacherous dealing of these Nipnet Indians, who of
all other had the least reason as to any pretense of injury, yet did most
deceitfully and barbarously join with Philip and his Indians, after they had
been several times sent unto by the Governor and Council of the Massachusetts,
by the advice of Plymouth, to have prevented their R^sing, as well as the
rising of the Narhagansets, and also had faithfully promised not to meddle in
the quarrel, as may more fully appear by the Engagement under the hands of
their Sachems, some time before Capt. Hutchinson and Capt. Wheeler were sent up
to them, which by reason of the have and unskilfullness of the Messengers on
that behalf sent, is not so fit for public view: but the account of it from
their return, under their hand and oath, July 24.75. when Leiut. Ephraim
Gurtice spoke with five of the Nipnet Sachems, four too many to govern so small
a people, but lying upon the head of the principal Indian Territoryes, they
were divided into so many small parties, two of whom, viz. Sam Sachem of
Wesha^um, and Netaump were executed together afterward at Boston. All of them
did at that time solemnly renew their Covenant and promise under their hands to
come to Boston to speak further with the Governor, instead of which what they
perfidiously did against Capt Hutchinson and others, has already been declared.

Upon the report of this sad Disaster that befell the Inhabitants of
Brookefield, Forces were sent up under the Command of Capt. Lothrop and others,
to pursue after those Indians, harboring about those places, and if it might
be, to prevent them from joining with the Indians upon Connecticut River, who
as yet had not discovered themselves as willing to espouse Philips interest,
but rather made some semblance to the contrary. There was much time spent by
Major Willard, and several Companyes of Soldiers left under his command, about
the Nipnet Country, but all to no purpose; for partly by the treachery of some
of the Indians that came to their assistance, that seemed to favor the
English, but rather acted in behalf of the enemy, partly by the subtletyes of
the enemies themselves, who could easily by their scouts discern the approach
of our soldiers, and by the nimbleness of their feet escape them: our
Soldiers could never meet with any of them, but only by that means driving
them further Westward, they gathered all the Indians they could to their party
about Pecomptuck, alias Dearfield, Swamscot, and Squakeag, where were some
plantations of the English newly began, whom they assaulted in the next place,
and did what mischief they could upon them.

It is here to be noted that although that worthy Patriot and experieneed
Soldier Major Willard hearing of the distress of Brookefield by some that were
traveling to Connecticut was the first that relieved the distressed people of
Quabaog or Brookefield, yet Major Pinehen of Springfield also by accident
hearing of their Calamity, had not only sent word thereof to Hartford (from
whom he received a supply of five and twenty or thirty soldiers under Capt.
Wats) but did also send a Band of men under Lieut. Cooper (who was afterward
villanously slain by Springfield Indians) who with those sent from Hartford,
and some Indians belonging to Springfield (seemingly forward to help the
English) made up fourscore or thereabouts; these marched down to Brookefield
the same day that Capt Lothrop and Capt. Beers came up from the Massachusetts,
who having spent some time in searching the woods about Springfield, and
finding none of the Indians, did the next day march up to a pluce called
Meminimisset by the Indians, where Capt. Hutchinson and Capt. Wheeler were
assaulted, and finding no sign of any Indians amongst those woods and Swamps;
the Company that came from Springfield, left the other Soldiers (who returned
to their Quarters at Brookefield) and went up themselves further northward, at
least twenty miles from the said Brookfield, and finding no track of Indians in
all those woods, they returned back to Springfield, leaving enough to defend
the people of Brookefield, and the garrison there.

By this it appears, that the Indians by this occasion were driven more
westward into the woods between Hadly and Squakheag. where they soon effected
their design, viz. to leaven the Indians on that side the Country with the same
prejudice and malice against the English, with which they themselves were
(though without cause) imbittered; for in a few days the device took place
amongst Hadly and Dearfield Indians, and was presently put in execution by the
said Indians, withdrawing from the English and assisting Philip and the Nipnets
to spoil and destroy all the towns westward, as soon after came to pass: yet
at the first some of the Hadly Indians pretended real friendship to the
English, and offered themselves to fight against Philip, but the Mohegin
Indians that came afterward from Harford began to suspect the Treachery of the
other, and told the English plainly, that no good would be done, while any of
that Company went along with them in pursuit of the Enemy, for as was said,
they would always give some shout when they came near the Enemy, as if they
should thereby wish them to look to themselves; insomuch that the said Hadly
Indians fell into great suspicion with the English, and for a proof of their
Fidelity, they were required to bring in their Arms to the English, but upon
that motion they delayed a little, but that very night they fled away from
their Dwellings, which was in a Wooden Fortification, within a mile of
Hatfield, whereby they plainly discovered that they had secretly plotted to
join with Philips Party, as far as they had an opportunity to do them any
eminent service: some think the English failed in point of prudence not
managing that business so warily as they might, which if they had done, their
defection had been prevented, but it is most probable that Philip had hired
them to own his quarrel, by sending them gifts in the Spring; and that the body
of the said Indians were most readily inclined thereunto: But the Sachims and
the elder ones of them, seemed loath at first to engage against the English. In
conclusion, when they had so falsely left their Dwellings, and were running
after Philip and the Nipnet Indians (at that time harbored in those Woods) the
English were so provoked, that were under Capt. Lothrop and Capt. Beers, that
they pursued after them very early the next morning, and overtook them about
ten miles above Hatfield, at a place called Sugar Loaf Hill, and had a small
skirmish with them, wherein there were nine or ten of the English slain, and
about twenty six Indians: yet the rest escaped; and so joined with Philip and
his Company, presently after which accident, they were so emboldned, that upon
the first of September, about seven days after they set upon Dearfield, killed
one Man, and laid most of the Houses in ashes. About two or three days after
they fell upon Squakoag, an other new Plantation, fifteen miles higher up the
River, above Dearfield, where they killed nine or ten of the People, the rest
hardly escaped into the Garrison house.

The next day, this disaster not being known, Captain Beers, for fear of the
worst, with thirty six men, was sent up to the said Squakeag, with supplies
both of men and provision to secure the small Garrison there, but before they
came very near to the Town, they were set upon by many hundreds of the Indians
out of the Bushes by a Swamp side, of whom Capt. Beers (who was known to fight
valiantly to the very last) with about twenty of his men, were by this sudden
surprifal there slain, the rest flying back to Hadly. Here the Barbarous
Villains showed their insolent rage and cruelty, more then ever before, cutting
off the heads of some of the slain, and fixing them upon Poles near the
Highway, and not only so, but one (if not more) was found with a Chain hooked
into his under jaw, and so hung up on the Bow of a Tree, (it is feared he was
hung up alive) by which means they thought to daunt and discourage any that
might come to their relief, and also to terrify those that should be
Spectators with the beholding so sad an object: insomuch that Major Treat with
his Company, going up two days after, to fetch off the residue of the Garrison,
were solemnly affected with that doleful sight, which made them make the more
have to bring down the Garrison, not waiting for any opportunity to take revenge
upon the Enemy, having but an hundred with him, two few for such a purpose,
Captain Appleton going up after him, met him coming down, and would willingly
have persuaded them, to have turned back, to see if they could have made any
spoil upon the Enemy, but the greatest part advised to the contrary, so that
they were all forced to return, with what they could carry away, leaving the
rest for a booty to the Enemy, who shall ere long pay a sad reckoning for their
Robberies and Cruelties, in the time appointed: but the sufferings of the
English were not as yet come to their height, for after they were come to
Hadly, the Commander in chief taking Counsel with the Officers of the
Soldiers, ordered them that were then present to Garrison the Towns about; some
to be at North-Hampton, Hatfield, Dearfield, and some to remain at Hadly where
were the Headquarters of the English. But perceiving that little good was to
be done upon the Enemy in those parts, it was agreed that what Corn was left at
Dearfield, being threshed out as well as they could in those tumults (about
three thousand Bushels was supposed to be there standing in stacks) should be
brought to Hadly, and wait further time to fight the Enemy. It came to C.
Lothrops turn, or rather it was his choice with about eighty men to guard
several Carts laden with Corn, and other Goods, the Company under Capt. Mosely
then quartering at Dearfield intended that day to pursue after the Enemy. But
upon September 18. that most fatal day, the saddest that ever befell
New England, as the Company were marching along with the Carts (it may be too
securely) never apprehending danger so near, were suddenly set upon, and almost
all cut off (not above seven or eight escaping) which great defeat came to pass
by the unadvised proceeding of the Captain (who was himself slain in the first
assault) although he wanted neither courage nor skill, to lead his Soldiers;
but having taken up a wrong notion about the best way and manner of fighting
with the Indians (which he was always wont to argue for) viz. that it were best
to deal with the Indians in their own way, sc. by skulking behind Trees, and
taking their aim at single persons, which is the usual manner of the Indians
fighting one with another, but herein was his great mistake, in not considering
the great disadvantage a smaller Company would have in dealing that way with a
greater multitude; for if five have to deal with one, they may surround him,
and every one take his aim at him, while he can level but at one of his Enemies
at a time: which gross mistake of his, was the ruin of a choice company of
young men, the very slower of the County of Essex, all culled out of the Towns
belonging to that County, none of which were ashamed to speak with the Enemy in
the gate: their dear Relations at home mourning for them, like Rachel for her
children, and would not be comforted, not only because they were not, but
because they were so miserably lost. (The like mistake was conceived to be the
reason of the loss of the former persons, slain with the said Lothrop, pursuing
the Indians that ran away from Hadly, and of the twenty slain with Capt. Beers
men, who betook themselves at first to their Trees and at the last a few got to
their Horses soon after their Captain was shot down.) For had he ordered his
men to March in a Body, as some of his fellow-Commanders advised, either
backward, or forward, in reason, they had not lost a quarter o^ the number of
them that fell that day by the edge of the Sword. For the Indians,
notwithstanding their sublety and cruelty, durst ^o look on Englishmen (...) he
face, in the open field, nor ever yet were known to kill any m^n with their
Guns, unless when they couldly in wai^ for him in an ambush or behind some
shelter, taking him undiscovered; so that although it was judged by those that
escaped, that there was seven or eight hundred Indians at least that encountered
that Company of eighty of English, yet if they had k^pt together in a Body, and
fought Marching, they might have escaped the numbers of the Enemy, with little
loss in comparison of what they sustained. For the valiant and successful Capt.
Mosely and his Lieutenant, coming (though too late) to their rescue, marched
through and through that great body of Indians, and yet came off with little or
no loss in comparison of the other. And having fought all those Indians for
five or six hours upon a ma^ch, lost not above two men all that while, nor
received other damage besides eight or nine that were wounded, which yet were
carried to their quarters at night at Hatfield, whereas if these had proceeded
in the same way of fighting as Capt. Lothrop did in the morning, they might
have been surrounded, and so have been served as the former were: but God had
otherwise determined in his secret counsel, and therefore that was hid from the
one which was a means to preserve the other Company.

Other releif also was seasonably sent in, viz. a Company of English, and
Mohegin or Pipuod Indians under the Command of Major Treat, who was in the
morning marching another way, viz. up toward Squakheag to seek after the enemy
that way, with about an hundred soldiers, Indians and English, upon whose
approach the enemy, pretty well acquainted by this last encounter with the
valor of the English, immediately went clear away, giving Major Treat and
Capt. Mosely, who returned to Dearfield that night, an opportunity to bury the
slain the next day. As Capt. Mosely came upon the Indians in the morning he
found them stripping of the slain, amongst whom was one Robert Dutch of
Ipswich, having been sorely wounded by a bullet that rased to his skull, and
then mauled by the Indian hatchets, left for dead by the Salvages, and stripped
by them of all but his skin, yet when Capt, Mosely came near, he almost
miraculously as one raised from the dead came toward the English, to their no
small amazement, by whom being received and clothed, he was carried off to the
next garrison, and is living and in perfect health at this day May he be to the
friend and relations of the rest of the slain, an emblem of their more perfect
resurrection at the last day to receive their crowns among the rest of the
Martyrs that have laid down or ventured their lives as a testimony to the
truth of their Religion, as well as love to their Country.

This sore defeat of Capt. Lothrop and his men, was the more to be lamented in
that (falling out so soon after two other of the like nature) it so emboldned
the enemy, that they durst soon after adventure upon conside^able towns, though
well garisoned with soldiers, and gave them occasion of most insolent Braving
the Garrison at Dearfield the next day, hanging up the garments of the English,
in fight of the Soldiers, yet on the other side of the river. However it
pleased God, who is always wont to remember his people in their low estate, to
put such a restraint upon them, that when they passed very near the Garrison
house at Dearfield (wherein were not left above twenty seven soldiers) their
Captain using this stratagem, to cause his trumpet to sound as if he had
another troop near by to be called together, they turned another way and made
no attempt upon the house where that small number was, which if they had done
with any ordinary resolution, so small an handful of men could hardly have
withstood the force of so many hundreds as were then gathered together.

What loss the Enemy sustained by the resistance of Capt. Lothrop and his men,
(who no doubt being all resolute young men, and seeing they should be forced by
the hard law of the sword to foregoe their lives, held them at as high a rate
as they could) is not certainly known. It has since been confessed by some of
the Indians themselves, that they lost ninety six of their m^n that day. Capt.
Moselyes men coming suddenly upon them when they were pillaging of the dead,
fell upon them with such a smart assault, that they drove them presently into a
swamp following them so close, that for seven miles together they fought them
upon a march, charging them through and through. Perez Savage and Leiut,
Pickering his Leiutenants deserving no little part of the honor of that days
Service, being sometimes called to lead the Company in the front, while Capt
Mosely took a little breath, who was almost melted with laboring, commanding,
and leading his men through the midest of the enemy.

The Indians gathered together i^ those parts, appearing so numerous, and, as
might justly he supposed, growing more confident by some of their last
successes, and the number of our men being after this sad rate diminished,
Recruits also not being suddenly to be expected, at so great a distance as an
hundred miles from all supplies, the Commander in chief with the Officers, saw
a necessity of slighting that Garrison at Dearfield, employing the Forces they
had to secure and strengthen the three next towns below upon Connecticut River.
And it was well that counsel was thought upon; for now those wretched Caitiffs
begin to talk of great matters, hoping that by degrees they might destroy all
the towns thereabout, as they had already begun: Their hopes no doubt, were not
a little heightened by the accession of Springfield Indians to their party, who
had in appearance all this time stood the firmest to the interest of the
English of all the rest in those parts: But they all hanging together, like
Serpents eggs, were easily persuaded to join with those of Hadly (there being
so near alliance between them, for the Sachem of Springfield Indians was the
father of Hadly Sachem) not only by the success of their treacherous and
bloodthirsty companions, but by the same inbred malice and antipathy against
the English manners and Religion.

The Inhabitants of Springfield were not unsensible of their danger, and
therefore had upon the first breaking forth of these troubles been treating
with their Indians, and had received from them the firmest assurance, and
pledges of their faithfulness, and friendship that could be immagined or
desired, both by Covenant, promises and Hostages given for security, so as no
doubt was left in any of their minds: Yet did these faithless and ungrateful
Monsters plot with Philips Indians to burn and destroy all Springfield, as they
had done Brookfield before: to that end they sent cunningly and enticed away
the Hostages from Hartford, where they were, perhaps too securely watched over,
a day or two before: Then receiving above three hunderd of Philips Indians into
their Fort, privately in the night time, so as they were neither discerned nor
suspected: Yea so confident were such of the inhabitants as were most
conversant with the Indians at their Fort, that they would not believe there
was any such plot in hand, when it was strangly revealed by one Toto an Indian
at Windsor, better affected to the English, (about eighteen or twenty miles
below Springfield, upon the same River) and so by Post tidings thereof brought
to Springfield the night before; insomuch that the Lieutenant of the town,
Cooper by name, was so far from believing the Stratagem, that in the morning
himself with another would venture to ride up to the Fort, to see whether
things were so or no. The Fort was about a mile from the town; when he came
within a little thereof, he met these bloody and deceitful Monsters, newly
issued out of their Equus Trojanus to act their intended mischief, they
presently fired upon him diverse of them, and shot him in several places
through the body, yet being a man of stout courage, he kept his horse, till he
recovered the next garrison house, his companion they shot dead upon the place,
by this means giving a sad alarm to the town of their intended mischief, which
was instantly fi^ed in all places where there were no Garrisons. The poor people
having never an Officer to lead them, being like sheep ready for the slaughter,
and no doubt the whole town had been totally destroyed, but that a report of
the Plot being carried about over night, Major Treat came from West field time
enough in a manner for their rescue, but wanting boats to transport his men,
could not do so much good as he desired. Major Pynchon coming from Hadly with
Capt. Appleton and what Forces they could bring along with them, thirty two
houses being first consumed, preserved the rest of the town from being turned
to ashes, in which the over credulous Inhabitants might now see (what before
they would not believe at the burning Major Pynchons Barns and Stables a few
days before, to a very great damage of the Owner) the faithless and deceitful
friendship amongst those perfidious, cruel and hellish Monsters.

Amongst the ruins of the said dwellings, the saddest to behold was the house
of Mr. Pelatiah Glover, Minister of the Town, furnished with a brave Library,
which he had but newly brought back from a Garrison wherein it had been for some
time before secured, but as if the danger had been over with them, the said
Minister a great Student, and an helluo librorum, being impatient for want of
his Books, brought them back to his great sorrow, fit for a Bonfire for the
proud insulting enemy. Of all the mischiefs done by the said enemy before that
day, the burnof this town of Springfield did more then any other, discover the
said Actors to be the children of the Devil, full of all subtlety and malice,
there having been for about forty years so good correspondence betwixt the
English of that town and the neighboring Indians; But in them is made good
what is said in the Psalm, that though their words were smoother then oil, yet
were they drawn swords.

After some little time spent in garisoning the place, and helping the
Inhabitants to secure what they had left, the English soldiers most of them
returned back to Hadly their headquarters, and Major Pynchon being so full of
encumbrances, by reason of the late spoils done to himself, and his neighbors
at Springfield, could not any longer attend the Service of commanding in Chief
as he had done before, wherefore being according to his earnest Request to the
Council eased of that burden, Capt. Samuel Appleton was ordered to succeed in
taking the charge of the Soldiers left in those upper towns, by whose
industry, skill and courage, those towns were preserved from running the same
fate with the rest, wholly or in part so lately turned into ashes. For the enemy
growing very confident by the late successes, came with all their fury the
nineteenth of October following upon Hatfield, hoping no less then to do the
like mischief to them, they had newly done to Springfield: But according to the
good providence of Almighty God, Major Treat was newly returned to Northampton,
Capt. Mosely and Capt. Poole were then garisoning the said Hatfield, and Capt.
Appleton for the like end quartering at Hadly, when on the sudden seven or
eight hundred of the enemy came upon the town in all quarters, having first
killed or taken two or three of the Scouts belonging to the town, and seven
more belonging to Capt. Mosely his Company: But they were so well entertained
on all hands where they attempted to break in upon the town, that they found it
too hot for them. Major Appleton with great courage defending one end of the
town, and Capt. Mosely as stoutly maintaining the middle, and Capt. Poole the
other end; that they were by the resolution of the English instantly beaten
off, without doing much harm. Capt. Appletons Sergeant was mortally wounded
just by his side another bullet passing through his own hair, by that whisper
telling him that death was very near, but did him no other harm. Night coming
on, it could not be discerned what loss the enemy sustained, diverse were seen
to fall, some run through a small river, others cast their guns into the water
(it being their manner to venture as much to recover the dead bodies of their
friends, as to defend them when alive)

At last after the burning of some few barns, with some other buildings, the
enemy hasted away as fast as they came on, leaving the English to bless God who
had so mercifully delivered them from the fury of their merciless foes, who had
in conceit without doubt, devoured them all: But this resolute and valiant
repulse, put such a check upon the pride of the enemy, that they made no
further attempt upon any of those towns for the present, but winter drawing on,
they retired all of them to their general rendezvouze at Narhaganset, where we
shall leave them for the present plotting their general design of accomplishing
their intended mischief against the English the next Spring.

Our Western Plantations upon Connecticut River, were the stage whereon were
acted the most remarkable passages of this barbarous War hitherto, which was
soon after removed into many other places of the Country in the Winter and
Spring following, whither our discourse must in the next place pursue it: There
was not any great matter acted by the Enemy amongst the Plantations upon the
great River during the Winter, after the assault made upon Hatfield October 19.
It is evident that the body of them returned to Narrhaganset upon the approach
of the Winter, which set in more early then it used in other years: where
Philip did bestow himself in the winter season is not so certain, some say that
he repaired further wellward, to try his fortune with those Indians that ^ly
toward Albany, near the Dutch River: others more probably conceive that he lay
hid in some part of the Narrhaganset Country; for though he was not certainly
known to be about the Fort at Narrhaganset, when it was taken by our Forces in
the winter, yet as soon as ever they were driven out of the Country in
February, he was found amongst them that did the mischief at Lancaster in that
month.

Some straggling parties of them remained about North-Hampton, West field and
Springfield some time after their defeat at Hatfield: seven or eight of the
Inhabitants of North-Hampton in the end of October, venturing to fetch in some
of their Harvest, that was left somewhere out of the Town, were in danger of
being surprised, having laid their Arms under their Cart, so as being destitute
of means to make their defense, they were glad to fly away with the Horses out
of their Cart, leaving what they were about to the pleasure of the Indians that
assaulted. Major Treat upon the hearing the Alarm, presently repaired thither,
but could not come time enough to destroy any of the Enemy, nor yet to prevent
their burning of four or five Houses, with two or three Barns that stood
somewhat out of the Town. Within a little time after they killed three of the
same Town, as they were at work in a Meadow not far from the Town: they
intended also to have burned the Mill, but it was too well guarded by two files
of Musketeers lodged there for the purpose, who put them beside their intent,
Six or seven of Springfield soon after going to the Mill at Westfield (that
which belonged to their own Town being burned October 5 th.) and venturing
without Arms, three of them were killed by some of the Enemy, who took the
advantage also to burn four or five Houses that belonged to the said West
field: but by the end of November the coast was pretty clear of them, unless
some few of them that lay lurking in the Swamps thereabouts all the winter,
doing some small mischief upon some out-dwellings of Springfield.

The expedition into the Narrhaganset Country follows in order in the next
place to be related; but before we come thither, a little notice must be taken
by the way, of an unsuccessful attempt upon the Indians about Hassanemesit and
Poppachuog, whither Capt. Henchman was sent in the beginning of November; where
also Captain Sill was ordered to meet him with another Company from Cambridge,
with intent to have bear up the Indians quarters in those parts: they being
known to have had an hand in the outrages committed upon those that belonged to
Malberough and Menaham; cutting off the scalp of a millers Boy, who is yet
alive.

November 1. 1675. Capt. Henchman marched out of Boston intending to visit the
Indians about Hassenemesit: the third day they saw some fires of the Indians,
yet could not meet with them that made them: the 4 th day they marched to some
part of the Indian Plantations called Hassenemesit: the Captain would have
taken up his quarters a mile on this side, but some of his Officers overruled
him, to whose importunity he gave way, and marched a mile further toward the
Enemy, and by that means saved the Millers youth, taken the week before from
Malberough; for in the morning very early, as the Scouts were looking out, they
spyed a Wigwam, where some Indians that had carried away the youth, had lodged
all night in some Wigwam near by, when the Indians saw our Soldiers, they
hasted away, and left the Malberough youth behind them, who by that means
escaped their hands. Our men under Capt. Henchman marched on to Poppachuog, and
finding the Indians all fled, (although they perceived by a Messenger
accidentally sent back, that the Indians followed them all that way they
marched) they came back to Mendham to settle things in that Town: some of the
Inhabitants informed them of some Indian Wigwams about ten miles off: the
Captain with Philip Curtice his Lieutenant, resolved to give them a camisado in
their Wigwams that night; to that end, they mounted two and twenty upon Horses,
riding up ten miles into the Woods, and when they came near the Wigwams, they
dismounted, and intended presently to march up, and give an assault upon them,
after they had first made a shout to fright the Enemy: they ordered one half to
follow the Lieutenant, the other to follow the Captain, when they came within a
quarter of a mile of the place, their Dogs began to bark, at which they stopd,
and by and by marching again, intended presently to fire in upon them, but the
Captains foot slipping, he could hardly recover himself, when suddenly looking
behind him, he saw no man following of him: the Lieutenant had five behind him,
who with those five resolutely fired on that side he was appointed to make the
assault upon; but they were repulsed by the Indians, who firing out of their
dens, shot down the Lieutenant and another, the rest presently ran away to a
fence: the Captain with all vehemence urged them to stay, they replied, they
went back but only to charge, yet went clear away, by which means, together
with the cowardice of the former, so sad a loss befell the Company, which could
not easily be rep^ed: however the Enemy presently deserted the Wigwam and gave
our men the next day an opportunity to fetch off their two dead men, and bury
them, and so with grief and shame were constrained to return to their quarters
at Mendham, to whose Inhabitants they gave notice of 200 bushels of Corn
belonging to the Indians, that might have been preserved, which for want of
hands was lost by the fire, that the Enemy might not be benefited thereby. It
appears by the foregoing passage, that the time of our deliverance was not yet
come, and that God had further trials to acquaint us with before he would turn
his hand upon our Enemies. But it pleased the Lord in mercy so to order things,
that they themselves fell into that pit they were digging for others, as shall
appear more fully in what follows.

The English Plantations about Hadly being for the present set a little at
liberty by the Indians drawing off, like Seamen after a Storm, counted it their
best course to repair their tackling against another that may be next coming,
wherefore the Inhabitants concluded it the safer way to make a kind of
Barricado about their Towns, by setting up Pallizadoes or cleft wood about
eight foot long, as it were to break the force of any sudden assault which the
Indians might make upon them; which counsel proved very successful; for
although it be an inconsiderable defense against a Warlike Enemy, that has
strength enough, and confidence to besiege a place, yet it is sufficient to
prevent any sudden assault of such a timorous and barbarous Enemy as these
were, for although they did afterward in the Spring break through those
Pallizadoes at North-Hampton, yet as soon as ever they began to be repulsed,
they saw themselves like Wolves in a Pound, that they could not fly away at
their pleasure, so as they never adventured to break through afterward upon any
of the Towns so secured.

As for those of Springfield, they were now and then Alarmed with a few
skulking Indians lurking about in the adjacent Woods; as once at the Long
Meadow, where half a score of them were seen about an house remote from the
Town, who were pursued by a party of the English toward Windsor, and so
escaped, after the English had made one shot upon them, not knowing certainly
how many they killed. So at another time, a few of those barbarous wretches
killed a poor man belonging to Springfield, as he was going to his house to
look after his Corn on the other side of the River, and after they had killed
the man, they burnt down his house; yet attempted no further mischief upon that
part of the Town that had escaped the fury of the Flames, October 5. By which
it is evident, that all the number of Indians that had assaulted them before,
had not drawn themselves for the present to their winter quarters, some to the
Dutch River, but the greatest number of them to be sure were found in the
winter at the Narrhaganset Fort, where we shall leave them for the present till
the Forces of the United Colonies shall fire them out of their nests.

The Soldiers continuing some time at Hatfield after this victory, as we may
well call it (for it seems to have given the first check to the rage of the
heathen within the Jurisdiction of the united Colonyes, they have been observed
ever since to have been on the losing hand, seldom or never da^ing to meet our
Soldiers in the open Field, unless when they have very great advantage as to
their numbers, or covert of the woods and bushes: although like some ranging
Beasts they have done much mischief several times since, when they were ready
to expire or when the pangs of death were coming upon them) our forces
therefore being all called home, save some left for garisoning the towns
thereabouts.

The Commissioners of the united Colonyes taking into serious Consideration the
present state of things, viz. that there were before this time so many hundreds
gathered together into one Body, and that there was great reason to fear, if
they were let alone till the next spring they might all rise together as one
man round about us, and that one Town after another might easily be destroyed,
before any help could be dispatched to them. On the one hand the sharpness of
the winter in these parts was well weighed, so extreme that it might hazard the
loss of a thousand men in one night, if they were forced to lodge abroad in the
open field, as also the difficulty, if not impossibility of sending any relief
to them at any distance, the depth of snow usually making the ways unpassable
for diverse months together.

On the other hand it was considered, that if the enemy were let alone till the
next summer, it would be impossible to deal with them, or find them any where,
but they might waste one company of Soldiers after another, as was seen by the
experience of the former year. Considering also that the Narhagansets, the most
numerous of all the rest, and the best provided of provision of all the other
Indians, had now declared themselves our enemies, who if they were let alone
till the winter was over, we should be unable to deal with so many enemies at
once, that could on a sudden on any occasion spread themselves like grasshoppers
all over the Country.

It was therefore finally agreed upon by the general consent of all, to to fall
upon the winter quarters of our enemies, by a more considerable Army (if I may
so call it) gathered out of all the three Colonyes, and that with all
expedition, at farthest not to exceed the tenth of December before they should
have a thousand men in arms ready for the design.

As for the late League made or rather renewed with the Narhagansets, it was
sufficiently evident and known, that they had all along from the first day when
it was confirmed broken every article of it, specially in not delivering up the
enemies which had sheltered themselves with them all this while, which though
they did not positively deny, yet did nothing but find excuses, to defer it one
week after another, till at the last they would be excused till the next
Spring, upon pretense that they could not before that time get them together.
Beside the favoring of those that fled to them, and supplying the whole Body
of the enemy with victuals, upon all occasions. It was likewise strongly
suspected that in all the late proceedings of the enemy, many of their young
men were known to be actually in arms against us, many of whom were found
either wounded amongst them in their wigwams, or else were occasionally seen
returning back, after exploits abroad, to be healed of their wounds at home.
Also some of our men's guns that were lost at Dearfield were found in the Fort
when it was fired. Therefore all scruples as to the justness and necessity of
the war being removed, the only question was, whether it were feasible and
expedient in the winter. The exigent was very great, and the choice very hard:
But as David when he was streightened with many difficultyes at once, chose
rather to fall into the hands of God whose mercyes were great, though he might
be provoked to cause his jealousy to smoke against those of his own heritage
for a time: so in this exigent it was generally conceived to be most expedient
for the Country, to cast themselves upon the providence of a merciful and
gracious God, rather then by delays to expose themselves to the treachery and
cruelty of a perfidious enemy.

A War therefore speedily to be carried on in the very depth of winter, being
agreed upon, care was taken for supplies, as the difficulty of such an affair
so circumstanced did require, though possibly not with so much necessary care,
and so suitable provision, as had been desired, if what came afterward to pass
could have been foreseen (which peradventure might be the reason things went on
so heavily for want of well oyling the wheels) in the mean time a small Army of
a thousand fighting men, well appointed, were ordered by the Commissioners to
be gathered by proportion out of all the Colonyes; of which number the share of
the Massachusetts was to be five hundred and twenty seven, the rest were to be
supplied out of Plymouth and Connecticut Colonyes, All other supplies were
taken care for, as well as the suddenness of the Expedition, and difficulty of
the season would allow. The said thousand men, beside some Volunteers of Indian
Friends, were by the time and place appointed as near as could be had, called
together, and a Commission granted to the honorable Josiah Winslow Esquire the
present Governor of Plymouth Colony, a man of known ability and integrity,
every way so well qualified with courage and Resolution, as well as prudence
and discretion, as might have preferred him to the conduct of a far greater
Army then ever is like to be gathered together in this part of the world, in
this or in following Generations. And indeed as he was the first Governor over
any of the united Colonyes in New England of them that were born in the place,
so may he well pass for a pattern of any of the succeeding race, that may come
after.

Under him as Commander in Chief were ordered six Companyes from the
Massachusetts, under the Command of Major Appleton, Capt. Mosely, Capt.
Gardener, Capt. Davenport, Capt. Oliver, Capt. Johnson, Five Companyes from
Connecticut under Major Treat, Capt. Siely, Capt. Gallop, Capt. Mason, Capt.
Wats, and Capt. Marshal, Two Companyes from Plymouth, under Major Bradford and
Capt. Goram.

Under the Governor of Plymouth as Commander in Chief in this Expedition, were
sent as Majors of the Forces belonging to each Colony, Major Robert Treat for
the Forces belonging to Connecticut, and Major Bradford for those of the Colony
of Plymouth, and Major Samuel Appleton for those of the Massachusetts, to whom
by the honorable Major General of the said Colony were six Companyes of Foot
delivered at Dedham, December the 9 th. 1675, containing in number 465 fighting
men, besides a Troop of Horse under the Command of Capt. Thomas Prentice
attending upon them. That night they marched to Woodcocks about 27. miles from
Dedham. The next night they arrived at Seaconck; Capt. Mosely and his Company
went from thence with Mr. Smith by water, the rest ferried over the water to
Providence.

The next day, December. the 12 th. they passed over Patuxet River, and then
marching through Pomhams Country, at night they met with Capt. Mosely and his
Company at Mr. Smiths in Wickford, the place intended for their Headquarters.
Capt. Mosely in his way thither had happily surprised thirty six Indians, one
of whom he took along with him as a Guide, Peter by name, that was at that time
under some disgust with his Countrymen, or his Sachem, which made him prove
the more real friend to our forces in that service, wherein he faithfully
performed what he promised, and without his assistance our men would have been
much at a loss to have found the enemy, until it had been too late to have
fought them.

Two days after, December. 14. Five Files of men sent out under Sergeant Bennet
and another, upon the Scout, killed one man and one woman, and brought in four
more by one of the clock: the whole Company marched after into some of the
Sachems Country, where they burnt an hundred and fifty Wigwams, killed seven of
the enemy, and brought in eight Prisoners when they returned at night.

The next day an Indian called Stone-wall-John pretended to come from the
Sachems, intimating their willingness to have peace with the English, yet could
the Messenger hardly forbear threatening, vapouring of their numbers and
strength, adding withal that the English durst not fight them: whatever were
pretended by this treacherous fellow, some of his Crew as he went home met with
some of Capt. Gardners men, that were straggling about their own business
contrary to order, and slew his Sergeant, with one or two more. Two also of
Capt. Olivers men were killed in like manner; a solemn warning for Soldiers
not to be too venterous in an enemies Country. For preventing the like mischief
upon other Companyes, more care was taken as they passed to the Headquarters,
some of the Companyes being lodged three miles there from. Capt. Moselyes,
Capt. Davenports and Capt. Olivers Company being also sent about that time to
bring Major Appletons Company to the general Quarters, a few desperate Indians
creeping under a stone wall near the place, fired twenty or thirty gunns at
Mosely in particular, a Commander well known amongst them, but the rest of the
Company running down upon them, killed one of them, and scattered the rest.

The next day Capt. Prentice with his Troop, being sent to Petequamscot,
returned with the sad news of burning Jerry Bulls Garrison house, and killing
ten English men and five women and children, but two escaping in all. This is
the chance of war which they who under take, must prepare to undergo.

The next day brought from the same place a little better news, though not
enough to balance the sorrow of the former, viz. that Connecticut Forces were
come thither with three hundred English, and an hundred and fifty Mohegins,
ready fixed to war on the behalf of the English against the Narhagansets their
mortal enemies; and by the way meeting a Party of the enemy, they slew five or
six of them and took as many Prisoners. The whole number of all our Forces
being now come, the want of provision with the sharpness of the cold, minded
them of expedition, wherefore the very next day, the whole Body of the
Massachuset and Plymouth Forces marched away to Pettyquamscot intending to
engage the enemy upon the first opportunity that next offered it self: To the
which resolution those of Connecticut presently consented, as soon as they met
together, which was about five a clock in the afternoon: Bulls house intended
for their general Rendezvouze, being unhappily burnt down two or three days
before, there was no shelter left either for Officer or private Soldier, so as
they were necessitated to march on toward the enemy through the snow, in a cold
stormy evening, finding no other defense all that night, save the open air, nor
other covering then a cold and moist fleece of snow. Through all these
difficultyes they marched from the break of the next day, December 19. till one
of the clock in the afternoon, without either fire to warm them, or respite to
take any food, save what they could chew in their march. Thus having waded
fourteen or fifteen mile through the Country of the old Queen, or Sunk Squaw
of Narhaganset: they came at one a clock upon the edge of the Swamp where their
guide assured them they should find Indians enough before night.

Our Forces chopping thus upon the seat of the enemy, upon the sudden, they had
no time either to draw up in any order or form of Battle, nor yet opportunity
to consult where or how to assault. As they marched Capt. Mosely and Capt.
Davenport led the Van, Major Appleton and Capt. Oliver brought up the Rear of
the Massachuset Forces; General Winslow with the Plymouth Forces marched in the
Center; those of Connecticut came up in the Rear of the whole Body: But the
Frontiers discerning Indians in the edge of the Swamp, fired immediately upon
them, who answering our men in the same Language, retired presently into the
Swampe, our men followed them in amayne, without staying for the word of
Command, as if every one were ambitious who should go first, never making any
stand till they came to the sides of the Fort, into which the Indians that
first fired upon them betook themselves.

It seems that there was but one entrance into the Fort, though the enemy found
many ways to come out, but neither the English nor their Guide well knew on
which side the entrance lay; nor was it easy to have made another; wherefore
the good providence of Almighty God is the more to be acknowledged, who as he
led Israel sometime by the Pillar of fire, and the Cloud of his presence a
right way through the Wilderness, so did he now direct our Forces upon that
side of the Fort, where they might only enter though not without utmost danger,
and hazard. The Fort was raised upon a kind of Island of five or six acres of
rising land in the midst of a Swamp; the sides of it were made of palizadoes
set upright the which was compassed about with an hedge of almost a rod
thickness, through which there was no passing, unless they could have fired a
way through, which then they had no time to do. The place where the Indians
used ordinarily to enter themselves, was over a long tree over a place of
water, where but one man could enter at a time, and which was so waylaid that
they would have been cut off that had ventured there: But at one corner there
was a Gap made up only with a long tree, about four or five foot from the
ground, over which men might easily pass: But they had placed a kind of a
Block-house right over against the said tree, from whence they sorely galled
our men that first entered, some being shot dead upon the tree, as Capt.
Johnson, and some as soon as they entered, as was Capt. Davenport, so as they
that first entered were forced presently to retire, and fall upon their bellyes
till the fury of the enemies shot was pretty well spent, which, some Companyes
that did not discern the danger, nor observing, lost sundry of their men, but
at the last two Companyes being brought up besides the four that first marched
up, they animated one another to make another assault, one of the Commanders
crying out. They run, they run, which did so encourage the Soldiers that they
presently entered amain. After a considerable number were well entered, they
presently beat the enemy out of a Flanker on the left hand, which did a little
shelter our men from the enemies shot, till more Company came up, and so by
degrees made up higher, first into the middle, and then into the upper end of
the Fort, till at the last they made the enemy all retire from their Sconces,
and fortified places, leaving multitudes of their dead Bodies upon the place,
Connecticut Soldiers marching up in the Rear, being not aware of the dangerous
passage over the tree, in Command of the enemies Block-house, were at their
first entrance many of them shot down, although they came on with as gallant
resolution as any of the rest under the conduct of their wise and valiant
Leader, Major Treat

The brunt of the Battle, or danger that day lay most upon the Commanders,
whose part it was to lead on their several Companies in the very face of Death,
or else all had been lost; so as all of them with great valor and resolution
of mind, as not at all afraid to die in so good a cause, bravely led on their
men in that desperate assault; leaving their lives in the place as the best
testimony of their valor, and of love to the cause of God and their Country:
No less then six brave Captains fell that day in the assault, viz. Capt.
Davenport, Capt. Gardner, Capt. Johnson of the Massachusetts, besides Lieutenant
Vpham, who died some months after of his wounds received at that time. Capt.
Gallop also, and Capt. Siely, and Capt. Marshal were slain of those that
belonged to Connecticut Colony. It is usually seen that the valor of the
Soldiers is much wrapped up in the lives of their Commanders, yet was it found
here, that the Soldiers were rather enraged then discouraged by the loss of
their Commanders, which made them redouble their Courage, and not give back
after they were entered the second time, till they had driven out their Enemies:
So as after much blood and many wounds dealt on both sides; the English seeing
their advantage, began to fire the Wigwams, where was supposed to be many of
the Enemies Women and Children destroyed, by the firing of at least five or six
hundred of those smoaky Cells.

It is reported by them that first entered the Indians Fort, that our Soldiers
came upon them when they were ready to dress their Dinner, but our sudden; and
unexpected assault put them besides that work, making their Cookrooms too hot
for them at that time, when they and their Mitchin fried together: and probably
some of them eat their Suppers in a colder place that night: most of their
Provision as well as their Hutts being then consumed with fire, and those that
were left alive forced to hide themselves in a Cedar Swamp, not far off, where
they had nothing to defend them from the cold but Boughs of Spruce and Pine
Trees: for after two or three hours fight, the English became Masters of the
place, but not judging it tenable, after they had burned all they could set
fire upon, they were forced to retreat, after the Daylight was almost quite
spent, and were necessitated to retire to their quarters, full fifteen or
sixteen miles off, some say more, whither with their Dead and Wounded men they
were to march, a difficulty scarce to be believed, as not to be paralleld
almost in any former age.

It is hard to say who acquitted themselves best in that days service, either
the Soldiers for their manlike valor in fighting, or the Commanders for their
wisdom and courage leading on in very face of death; There might one have seen
the whole Body of that little Regimental Army, as busy as Bees in a Hive, some
bravely fighting with the Enemy, others haling off, and carrying away the Dead
and Wounded Men (which I rather note) that none may want the due testimony of
their valor and faithfulness, though all ought to say, not unto us, but unto
thy Name, O Lord, etc.

For though there might not be above three or four hundred at any time within
the Fort at once, yet the rest in their turns came up to do what the exigence
of the service required in bringing off the Dead and Wounded men: The Major of
the Regiment, together with Captain Mosely, was very serviceable, for by that
means the Fort being clear of the Dead bodies, it struck a greater terror into
the Enemy, to see but eight or ten dead bodies of the English left, then to
meet with so many hundreds of their own slain and wounded Carcasses. The number
of the slain was not then known on the Enemies side, because our Men were
forced to leave them on the ground: but our victory was found afterward to be
much more considerable then at the first was apprehended; for although our loss
was very great, not only because of the desperateness of the attempt it self)
in such a season of the year, and at such a distance from our quarters, whereby
many of our wounded men perished, which might otherwise have been preserved, if
they had not been forced to march so many miles in a cold snowy night, before
they could be dressed) yet the Enemy lost so many of their principal fighting
men, their Provision also was by the burning of their Wigwams, so much of it
spoiled, at the taking of their Fort, and by surprising so much of their Corn
about that time also; that it was the occasion of their total ruin afterward:
they being at that time driven away from their habitations, and put by from
Planting for that next year, as well as deprived of what they had in store for
the present winter. What numbers of the Enemy were slain is uncertain, it was
confessed by one Potock a great Councellor amongst them, afterward taken at
Road-Island, and put to Death at Boston, that the Indians lost seven hundred
fighting men that day, besides three hundred that dyed of their Wounds the most
of them: the number of old men, women and children, that perished either by
fire, or that were starved with hunger and cold, none of them could tell. There
was above eighty of the English slain, and a hundred and fifty wounded, that
recovered afterward.

There were several circumstances in this Victory very remarkable.

First, The meeting with one Peter a fugitive Indian, that upon some
discontent, flying from the Narrhagansets, offered himself to the service of
the English, and did faithfully perform what he promised, viz. to lead them to
the Swamp where the Indians had seated themselves within a Fort raised upon an
Island of firm Earth, in the midst of a Swamp, whither none of the English
could have Piloted them, without his assistance, the place being near eighteen
miles from the place where they were quartered.

Secondly, There being by a special providence directed just to a place where
they found so easy entrance, which if they had missed they could never have
made a way through the Hedge, with which they had surrounded the Pallizadoes of
the Fort in half a days time.

And Thirdly, If they had entered by the way left by the Indians for passage,
they might have been cut off, before they could have come near their
Fortification.

Lastly, In directing their motion, to begin the Assault just at the day they
did, for if they had deferred but a day longer, there fell such a storm of Snow
the next day, that they could not have passed through it, in diverse weeks
after: And then on the sudden there fell such a Thaw, that melted away both Ice
and Snow, so that if they had deferred till that time, they could have found no
passage into their fortified place.

All which considerations put together, make it a signal favor of God to carry
them through so many difficulties to accomplish their desired end. For after
they were retired from their quarters, but sixteen miles from that place, there
was so great want of Provision, the Vessels being frozen in at the Harbor
about Cape Cod, that should have brought them relief, and the Frost and Snow
set in so violently, that it was not possible for them, with all the Force they
could make (so many of their ablest Soldiers being slain and wounded) to have
made another onset: But the goodness of Almighty God was most of all to be
admired, that notwithstanding, all the hardship they endured that winter, in
very cold Lodgings, hand Marches, Scarcity of Provision, yet not one man was
known to die by any disease or bodily distemper, save them that perished of
their wounds.

Our Forces being compelled by the foresaid occasions, to ly still some Weeks
after, hoping also that the Enemy so sorely broken, would gladly have sued for
peace: But as was said of old, God hardened their hearts to their own ruin and
destruction afterward. For as soon as our Soldiers were able to March,
finding that all the Enemies overtures of peace, and prolonging of treaties,
was only to gain time that they might get away into the Woods. They pursued
after them, and sometimes came upon their Rear, but then they would immediately
fly an hundred ways at once into Swamps, so as our men could not follow them,
or if they did, could not see two of them together; so that now there was
little good like to be done, unless they could take them at some advantage. At
length having spent all their Provision, and tiring themselves in pursuing of
them sixty or seventy miles, up through the Woods toward Malberough and
Lancaster, Towns that ly in the Road to Connecticot, having killed and taken
near seventy of them: our Soldiers were ordered to return toward Boston, to
recruit themselves, supposing that the Narrhagansets, and those with them were
so enfeebled that they would have no mind suddenly to assault any of the
English Towns.

If any desire a more particular account of the loss which we sustaind at the
taking of the Narhaganset Fort, December 19 th. 1665. they may take it as here
it follows.

Besides the six Captains mentioned before, that either were slain in the
assault, or dyed afterward of their wounds, to whom may be reckoned Lieut.
Vpham, that dyed lately at Boston, of the wounds he then received.

There were slain out of the Company belonging to Major Appleton. 3. Wounded.
22. Capt. Mosely. 9. 10. Capt. Oliver. 5. 10. Capt. Gardener. 7. 11. Capt.
Johnson. 3. 11. Capt. Davenport. 4. 15. in all, 31. in all 79. There were slain
and wounded. Of New Haven Company, 20. Of Capt. Siely his Company. 20. Of Capt.
Wats his Company. 17. Of Capt. Marshal his Company, 14. Of Plymouth Company
under Major Bradford and Capt. Goram. 20. In all, 91.

If there had not been so great a distance between the place of the fight and
their Quarters, and so much cold attending them in their retiring thereunto,
some better account might have been given of that expedition, then now they
were able to do. For a March of sixteen or eighteen miles is too much to
breathe a fresh Soldier, unless he were well mounted, but enough to kill the
heart of them that have been wearied with a long and tedious fight. As for the
coldness of the weather, although it be a good Be some to sweep the Chamber of
the Air (which might be the reason there was no more Diseases amongst them) yet
it is an unwelcome Companion to wearied, especially to wounded men, in so long
a Retreat.

But the want of Provision falling in conjunction with the unseasonableness of
the Weather, and length of the way hindered our Forces from any new attempt upon
the enemy, which if they could have attended, it was thought it might have put
an end to our troubles; but he that holds the scales of victory in his hand,
turns them to which side, and by what degrees pleases himself best.

The rest of the winter was spent in fruitless Treaties about a peace, both
sides being well wearied with the late desperate Fight, were willing to refresh
themselves the remaining part of the winter, with the short slumber of a
pretended peace, at least with a talk or Dream thereof: our Commanders aim
therein was Christian and good, if it had proceeded, sc. to have prevented the
shedding of more blood: And possibly some of the elder and wiser of the enemy,
did really desire what was pretended by them all, (for they had now full proof
of the valor and resolution of the English, which some of them upon former
successes might be ready to question) and they could not but see their
destruction already begun, in the loss of their dwellings, and all their
provision, as well as the slaughter of the best part of their fighting men; but
either through consciousness of their barbarous treachery, and falsehood they
could not trust others, and so were willing to run the utmost hazard, as people
hardened to their own destruction. The particular passages of the treaty being
carried on by the enemy only impretence, and by our men (that soon discerned
their fraud) rather out of necessity, to conceal their incapacity of engaging
them anew, then any real expectation of a good effect, are not worthy the
relating. However though the Foot were unable to do any Service in the depth
of the snow, and sharpness of the cold, The Troop was sent out upon all
occasions to scout about the Country, who brought in daily much of the enemies
corn and Beans, which they had hid in Barns under the ground, or at least kept
them from making use of their own provision, or spoiling the English Cattle;
now and then also bringing in Prisoners from their Quarters, as they were
straggling about to get victuals.

On the twenty seventh of December, Capt. Prentice was sent into Pom^ams
Country, where they burnt near an hundred Wigwams, but found never an Indian in
any of them.

On the 28 th, of December a Squaw was sent to them, who had been taken in the
Fight, with a proffer of Peace, if they would submit to such Terms as were
propounded; the principal of which was, the delivering up all Philips Indians
that were with them; The Squaw returned not pretending that she was lame and
unable to come again, but the thirtieth of December, an Indian came from the
Sachems with seeming thanks for the peace proffered, yet complained, we made war
upon them and gave them no notice; but his mouth was soon stopped, by the
answer which was made him: he owned, as the Squaw had said before, that they
lost three hundred of their best fighting men, and so did two Prisoners of
theirs taken January the 4 th, whereof one being of Philips Company was put to
death. The Messenger that was sent was fairly dismissed, with the express
mention of what terms they must expect, if they desired a peace.

Jan. There came two Messengers from them, as they said to make way for a
treaty of Peace; who laid the blame upon Canonchet, that came down to Boston,
in October last, to confirm the peace with the Commissioners of the united
Colonyes, as if he had misinformed them, viz. that they were not by the former
treaty to have delivered up the Wompanoogs, or Philips Indians, until the said
Canonchets Brother one of the Hostages at Hartford, was released. This was but
a mere pretense, for he and they too better understood the particulars of the
agreement: For by chance the Articles which they had of the peace concluded
with them were found open (whether purposely or accidentally was not known) in
a Wigwam in the Fort when it was taken, so as they could hot be ignorant of the
Articles of the Agreement

Jan. 5. An English child of about three or four years old, taken from Warwick,
was sent in to put the better pretense upon the treaty mentioned.

Jan. 8. The Messengers were sent back, and told what they must trust to. In
the afternoon a Messenger came from Ninigret the old Sachem of Narrhagansets,
who brought a letter from Mr. Stanton the Interpreter, signifying the reallity
of the said Ninigret his friendship to the English, and the streights of the
enemy, that corn was two shillings a pint with them. Yet notwithstanding all
their difficultyes, they rather delayed the time till they could get away, then
really endeavored the making a peace, as was soon manifest: For that young
insolent Sachem Canonchet, and Panoquin, said they would fight it out to the
last man, rather then they would become Servants to the English.

Jan. 10. Fresh supplies of soldiers came up from Boston, wading through a
sharp storm of snow, that bit some of them by the heels with the frost. The
next day one that came with them going out with the Scouts, fell amongst the
Indians Barns, in one of which, as he was groping to find corn for the relief
of his horse, he catched hold of an Indians hair under the leaves, who
presently held up his hands, when the soldier was drawing his sword, to spare
his life, which was granted; but after he was brought to the Headquarters, he
would own nothing but what was forced out of his mouth, by the woolding of his
head with a cord, wherefore he was presently judged to dye as a Wompanoog.

Jan. 12. Another Messenger came from Canonicus, desiring the space of a month
longer, wherein to issue the treaty, which so provoked the Commander of our
Forces, that they resolved to have no more Treatyes with the enemy; but prepare
to assault them, with Gods assistance as soon as ever the season would permit;
and it was high time to take up that resolution, for within a few days after,
they understood by some that were taken Prisoners; that the enemy were gone, or
going into the Nipmuck Country.

Within a few days after, about the 16 th. Jan. the scouts brought in one
Joshuah Tift a Renegado Englishman, of Providence, that upon some discontent
amongst his neighbors, had turned Indian, married one of the Indian Squaws,
renounced his Religion, nation and natural Parents all at once, fighting
against them. He was taken by Capt. Fenner of Providence, who with some of his
neighbors were pursuing some Indians that had driven away their Cattle, This
Tift being one of the Company was wounded in the knee, and so was seized by the
English he had in his habit conformed himself to them amongst whom he lived.
After examination he was condemned to die the death of a Traitor. As to his
Religion he was found as ignorant as an Heathen, which no doubt caused the
fewer tears to be shed at his Funeral, standers by being unwilling to lavish
pity upon him that had divested himself of nature it self, as well as
Religion, in a time when so much pity was needed elsewhere, and nothing left
besides wherewith to relieve the Sufferers.

Jan. 21. Capt. Prentice his Troop being abroad met with a Party of the enemy,
of whom they took two Prisoners and killed nine; in which exploit, something
happened very remarkable, for one W. Dodge of Salem riding in company with
another Friend, they happened to meet with two Indians, the said Dodge being
better horsed then his friend, made after the foremost, leaving his friend to
deal with the hindmost, but his Pistol missed firing, whereupon the Indian
taking him by the leg turned him off his horse, and getting upon him was about
killing him with his knife, which W. Dodge by chance espied, and came time
enough to rescue his friend, and dispatch the Indian lying upon him, and yet
overtook the first Indian he was pursuing, time enough to do his business
also: by that means he did three good offices at once, saved the life of one
Friend, and slew two of his Enemies. But within two or three days after, the
weather much altering from what it was, induced our Forces to take the first
opportunity to pursue the enemy, who as they understood by Messengers from
Providence, were now upon their flight into the Nipmuck Country: But so many
difficultyes were cast in their way, that they could not be ready time enough
to prevent the mischief they did at Warwick, as they took their Farewell of
their Country: For,

Jan. 27. They dispoyled Mr. Carpenter of two hundred sheep, and fifty head of
Neat Cattle, and fifteen horses; all which they drove along with them, and were
gone too far to be rescued before our Forces set out. Two that belonged to the
said Carpenter were wounded, and one of the enemies slain. As they marched
after the enemy, they found a good house burned, with a barn belonging to it.
They perceived also that the enemy dealt much in Horseflesh, meeting with no
less then sixty horses heads, in one place which they had left behind them. Our
Soldiers in their pursuit came upon their Rear, killed and took about seventy
of them, yet never could come to charge them, for they would presently betake
themselves into Swamps, and not two of them run together, so as they saw it was
an endless work to proceed further in the chase of such an enemy; but our
Forces having pursued them into the woods between Marlborough and Brookfield in
the Road toward Connecticut, were constrained to turn down to Boston in the
beginning of February for want of provision, both for themselves and their
horses, which gave an occasion to the loss of those lesser Towns that were
destroyed by the Napnet Indians who presently joined with the Narrhagansets,
upon their first approach, as shall be related afterward.

About the tenth of February next, some hundreds of the Indians whether Nipnets
or Nashaway men (is uncertain) belonging to him, they call Sagamore Sam, and
possibly some of the stoutest of the Narrhagansets that had escaped the Winter
brunt fell upon Lancaster a small Village of about fifty or sixty Families, and
did much mischief, burning most of the Houses that were not Garisoned: and
which is most sad and awful to consider, the House of Mr. Rowlandson, Minister
of the said Lancaster, which was Garisoned with a competent number of the
Inhabitants; yet the Fortification of the House being on the back side, closed
up with Firewood, the Indians got so near, as to fire a Lean-too, which
burning the House immediately to the ground, all the persons therein, were put
to that hard choice, either to perish by the flames with the House, or to yield
themselves into the hands of those cruel Salvages, which last (considering that
a living Dog is better then a dead Lion) they chose, and so were forty two
persons surprised by the Indians, above twenty of the Women and Children they
carried away Captive, a rueful spectacle to behold, the rest being Men, they
killed in the place, and reserved for further misery: and many of the rest were
not slain in fighting, were killed in attempting to escape. The Minister
himself was occasionally absent, to seek help from the Governor and Council,
to defend that place, who returning, was entertained with the Tragical news of
his Wife and Children surprised, and being carried away by the Enemies, and his
House turned into Ashes, yet it pleased God so to uphold his heart, comforting
himself in his God, as David at Ziklag, that he would always say, he believed
he should see his Wife and Children again, which did in like manner soon come
to pass within five or six months after; all save the youngest, which being
wounded at the first, died soon after among the Indians.

And such was the goodness of God to those poor Captive Women, and Children,
that they found so much favor in the sight of their Enemies, that they offered
no wrong to any of their persons, save what they could not help, being in many
wants themselves. Neither did they offer any uncivil Carriage to any of the
Females, nor ever attempted the chastity of any of them, either being
restrained of God, as was Abimelek of old, or by some other accidental cause,
withheld them from doing any wrong in that kind.

Upon the report of this Disaster Capt. Wadsworth then at Malberough with about
forty resolute men, adventuring the rescuing of the Town that was remaining:
and having recovered a Bridge they gat over safe, though the Planks were pulled
off by the Enemy, and being led up in a way, not discovered by them, they
forced the Indians for the present to quit the place, after they had burnt and
destroyed the better half of it. Yet afterward it not being judged tenable, it
was abandoned to the pleasure of the insulting Foe.

Ten days after they were so flushed with this success, that two or three
hundred of them came wheeling down to Medfield a Town twenty miles from Boston,
westward from Dedham, which they surprised very early in the morning (and
though there were one hundred and sixty Soldiers in it or more, besides the
Inhabitants) they burnt near one half of the Town, killing about twenty
persons, but by the resistance of the Soldiers, as soon as ever they could be
gotten together (it being at or before break of day, none in the least
s^specting such an assault so early) they were quickly forced to forsake the
place, and so (not without some loss) took their way to Plymouth Colony.

The Western Towns above Connecticut, were the chief Seat of the War, and felt
most of the mischiefs thereof in the end of the year 1675. but the Scene is now
to be changed; and the other Towns and the Villages that ly Eastward nearer
Boston, must bare their part in the like Tragedies: for as was said before, the
Narrhagansets having been driven out of the Country, fled through Nipnet
Plantations, toward Watchuset Hills meeting with all the Indians that had
harbored all Winter in those Woods about Nashaway, they all combined together
against the English, yet divided their numbers, and one half of them were
observed to bend their course toward Plymouth, taking Medfield in their way,
which they endeavored to burn and spoil, Feb, 21. 1675. as their fellows had
done Lancaster ten days before.

The surprizal of this Medfield in regard of some remarkable circumstances it
was attended with, is not unworthy a more particular Relating the manner
thereof: the loss of Lancaster had sufficiently awakened and alarmed the
neighboring Villages, all to stand upon their guard; and some had obtained
Garrison Soldiers for their greater security, as was the case with the Town of
Medfield, within twenty two miles of Boston. And at that time were lodged
therein several Garrison Soldiers, besides the Inhabitants; yet being billated
up and down in all quarters of the town could not be gathered together till a
great part of the Town was set on fire, and many of the Inhabitants slain,
which how it could be effected is strange to believe: But most of those inland
Plantations being over run with young wood (the Inhabitants being every where
apt to engross more Land into their hands then they were able to subdue) as if
they were seated in the midst of a heap of Bushes: their Enemies took the
advantage thereof, and secretly over night, conveyed themselves round about the
Town, some getting under the sides of their Barns and fences of their Orchards,
as is supposed, where they lay hid under that covert, till break of day, when
they suddenly set upon sundry Houses, shooting them that came first out of
their doors, and then fired their Houses, especially those houses where the
Inhabitants were repaired to Garrisons, were fit for the purpose: some were
killed as they attempted to fly to their Neigbours for shelter: some were only
wounded, and some taken alive and carried Captive: in some Houses the Husband
running away with one child, the wife with another, of whom the one was
killed, the other escaped: they began at the East end of the Town where they
fired the House of one Samuel Morse, that seems to have been a signal to the
rest to fall on in other parts: most of the Houses in the West or Southwest end
of the Town were soon burnt down: and generally when they burnt any outhouses,
the Cattle in them were burnt also. Two Mills belonging to the Town were burnt
also: a poor old man of near an hundred years old, was burnt in one of the
Houses that were consumed by fire. The Lieutenant of the Town, Adams by name,
was shot down by his own door, and his Wife mortally wounded by a Gun fired
afterward accidentally in the House. After the burning of forty or fifty
houses and barns, the Cannibals were frighted away out of the Town over a
Bridge that lies upon Charls-River, by the shooting off a piece of Ordnance 2
or 3 times: when they had passed over the Bridge they fired one end thereof, to
hinder our men from pursuing them, they were thought to be above five hundred:
There were slain and mortally wounded seventeen or eighteen persons, besides
others dangerously hurt. The loss sustained by the Inhabitants amounted to
above two thousand pounds. This mercy was observed in this sad providence, that
never a Garrison house was lost in this surprisal; nor any of the principal
Dwellings, so as the chiefest and best of their Building escaped the fury of
the Enemy, who as they passed the Bridge left a writing behind them, expressing
something to this purpose, that we had provoked them to wrath, and that they
would fight with us this twenty years (but they fell short of their expectation
by nineteen) adding also, that they had nothing to loose, whereas we had
Houses, Barns and Corn: these were some of the bold threats used by the
barbarous crew, but their rage shall proceed no further then the counsel of God
had determined. The week before was heard a very hideous cry of a kennel of
Wolves round the Town, which raised some of the Inhabitants, and was looked
upon by diverse as an ominous presaging of this following Calamity.

Another assault was feared, but as soon as the Soldiers could be gathered
together, they turned their backs, as if they never intended to visit them
more: whether these Indians went when they left Medfield is not so certainly
known; the Soldiers in the Town not having opportunity to pursue them over the
River, by reason that the Bridge was part of it burned: but it is most probable
that they took their way toward Plymouth, and continued about that side of the
Country for the future, waiting opportunities to do what mischief they could to
the English in those parts: For within a month after this assault of Medfield,
there was near six hundred of them seen about Patuxit and Providence, where
Capt. Pierce with about fifty of his men were lost, though with no great
advantage to the Enemy, who at that time lost above double that number: our
worthy Captains in this and other exploits being called to imitate Sampson, who
was content to dye with his enemies, that he might overthrow them thereby: it
having so fallen out with many of our choice Commanders and Soldiers at
Deerfield, Narrhaganset, Patuxit, and likewise not long after at Sudbury.

The Governor and Council of Plymouth perceiving by the report of these
outrages committed upon the Towns of the Massachusetts, that they were like to
be visited this Spring by their old Neighbors, sent out Capt. Pierce of
Situate about the latter end of March, with about fifty English, and twenty of
their Christian Indians about Cape Cod, who proved none of his worst Soldiers,
as the sequel of this his last expedition will declare.

Capt. Pierce, as is said before, being sent out to pursue the Enemy, marched
toward Patuxit, where he understood the Indians were many of them gathered
together: he being a man of resolute courage, was willing to engage them though
upon never so great disadvantage: some say the Indians by counterfeiting,
drilled him into a kind of Ambush, possibly more of them discovered themselves
after he began to engage then he was aware of: and being gotten over the River
in pursuit of them, where he discovered so great a number of them, he drew down
toward the side of the River, hoping the better by that means to prevent their
surrounding of him, but that proved his overthrow, which he intended as his
greatest advantage: for the Indians getting over the River, so galled him from
thence, that he was not able to defend himself thus assaulted on all sides, and
himself not being able to travel much a foot, was thereby hindered from retiring
to any better place in time; so as he saw himself constrained to fight it out
to the last, which he did with most undaunted Courage, and as is said, to the
slaughter of an hundred and forty of his enemies, before himself and his
Company were cut off. It is said also that being apprehensive of the danger he
was in, by the great numbers of the enemy, like to overpovver him with their
multitude, he sent a Messenger timely enungh to Providence, for relief, but, as
Solomon says, A faithful Messenger is as Snow in harvest, another is as smoke
to the eyes and vinegar to the teeth. (whether through sloth or Covvardize, is
not much material) this message was not delivered to them to whom it was
immediately sent; by accident only some of Rehoboth understanding of the danger
after the evening exercise (it being on the Lords day, March 26. 1676.)
repaired to the place, but then it was too late to bring help, unless it were
to be Spectators of the dead Carkases of their friends, and to perform the last
office of love to them.

It is vvorth the noting, what faithfulness and courage some of the Christian
Indians with the said Capt. Pierce shevved in the Fight: one of them, Amos by
name, after the Captain was shot in his leg or thigh, so as he was not able to
stand any longer, would not leave him, but charging his gun several times,
fired stoutly upon the enemy, till he saw that there was no possibility for him
to do any further good to Capt. Pierce, nor yet to save himself; if he stayed
any longer; therefore he used this policy, perceiving the Enemy had all blacked
their faces, he also stooping down, pulled out some blacking out of a pouch he
carried with him, discolored his face therewith, and so making himself look as
like Hobamacko as any of his Enemies: he ran amongst them a little while and
was taken for one of themselves, as if he had been searching for the English,
until he had an opportunity to escape away among the Bushes: therein imitating
the Cuttle Fish, which when it is pursued, or in danger, casts out of its
body a thick humor, as black as Ink, through which it passes away unseen by the
pursuer.

It is reported of another of these Cape Indians (Friends to the English of
Plymouth) that being pursued by one of the Enemies, he betook himself to a
great Rock, where he sheltred himself for a while, at last perceiving that his
Enemy lay ready with his Gun on the other side, to discharge upon him, as soon
as he stirred never so little away from the place where he stood: in the issue
he thought of this politic Stratagem to save himself, and destroy his Enemy,
(for as Solomon said of old, Wisdom is better then Weapons of War:) he took a
stick, and hung his Hat upon it, and then by degrees gently lifted it up, till
he thought it would be seen, and so become a fit mark for the other that
watched to take aim at him: the other taking it to be his head, fired a Gun,
and shot through the Hat; which our Christian Indian perceiving, boldly held up
his head and discharged his own Gun upon the real head, not the hat of his
Adversary, whereby he shot him dead upon the place, and so had liberty to march
away with the spoils of of his Enemy.

The like subtle device was used by another of the Cape Indians at the same
time, being one of them that went out with Capt. Pierce; for being in like
manner pursued by one of Philips Indians, as the former was, he nimbly got
behind the but end of a Tree newly turned up by the roots, which carried a
considerable breadth of the surface of the Earth along with it (as is very
usual in these parts, where the roots of the Trees ly very fleet in the ground)
which stood up above the Indians height, in form of a large Shield, only it was
somewhat too heavy to be easily weilded, or removed: the Enemy Indian lay with
his Gun ready to shoot him down, upon his first disserting his station; but a
subtle wit taught our Christian Netop a better device, for boring a little hole
through this his broad Shield, he discerned his enemy, who could not so easily
discern him; a good Musketier need never desire a fairer mark to shoot at,
whereupon discharging his Gun, he shot him down: what can be more just then
that he should himself be killed who lay in wait to kill another man? -- neque
enim Lex jnstior ulla est,
Quam necis Artifices art perire sua.


Instances of this nature show the subtlety and dexterousness of these Natives,
if they were improved in feats of Arms: and possibly if some of the English had
not been too shye in making use of such of them as were well affected to their
interest, they need never have suffered so much from their enemies: it having
been found upon late experience, that many of them have proved not only
faithful, but very serviceable and helpful to the english; they usually proving
good Seconds, though they have not ordinarily confidence enough to make the
first Onset.

But to return to the proceeding of the Indians toward Plymouth.

Feb. 25. They assaulted Weymouth, and burned seven or eight houses and barns
there, which Weymouth is a town lying toward Plymouth Colony.

March 12. following, They assaulted the house of one Mr. Clark in Plymouth,
cruelly murdering eleven persons that belonged to two Families that lodged
therein, and then fired the house. The cruelty toward these persons was the
more remarkable, in that they had often received much kindness from the said
Clarke. It is the usual custom of such Debtors, to use them worst, of whom
they have taken up much kindness upon trust before hand.

March 17 th. Another party of them fell upon Warwick, a place beyond Philips
Land; toward the Narrhaganset Country, where they burnt down to the ground all
but a few houses, left standing as a Monument of their barbarous fury. The like
mischief was acted by them upon the houses of the English remaining in the
Narrhaganset Country.

This 26 of March being the first day of the week, as the first of the year
after our Julian account, seemed ominous at the first on sundry accounts,
threatening a gloomy time, yet proved in the issue, but as a louring morning
before a lightsome day:

For besides the burning of Marlburrough, at least a great part of it on the
same day; a very sad accident fell out the same time at Springfield, as shall
he specified hereafter; besides that which befell Captain Pierce, which is
already related, with whom fell so many of his Soldiers on the same day also:
yet had the Enemy no cause to boast, being forced by the valor of the English,
to give so many of their own lives in exchange: some few made their escape, as
is said by subtle devices: besides the three forementioned, another by a like
shift, not only saved himself, but helped an English man to escape also, whom
he ran after with his Hatchet in his hand, as if he were about to kill him;
whereby both of them made a shift to get away; the rest were all lost (the
unfaithfulness of the Messenger being as was intimated before, the cause of
their slaughter) unto a few that hardly escaped by the advantage of the bushes,
giving them opportunity to pass unseen, yet was it confessed by a Prisoner of
the enemy, taken afterward by the English, that they lost an hundred and forty
in that encounter. And had not the said English by wading after the enemy over
a River, made their ammunition useless, there had not half so many of them been
cut off. From thence they turned back toward Rehoboth near Swanzy, where on
March. 28. they burnt thirty Barns, and near upon forty dwelling houses,
thereby as it were threatening the utter desolation of that poor town; and so
proceeding on that side the Country, they burnt the very next day about thirty
houses in Providence in the way toward Narrhaganset.

But it was now full sea with Philip his affairs, for soon after the tide of
his successes began to turn about the Sea coast, which made way for the falling
of the water up higher in the Country. For about this time news came to Boston
that our neighbors and friends of Connecticut Colony hearing of the attempts
of the enemy on that side of the Country, sent a party of their Soldiers,
under the Command of Capt. George Denison with some friendly Indians, part
Mohegins and Pequods, part Nianticks belonging to Ninigret a Narrhaganset
Sachem, who never engaged in this quarrel against the English: who in pursuit
of the enemy; meeting with a considerable part of them about the Narrhaganset
Country, killed and took forty and five of them, without the loss of one of
their own men. This Victory was the more considerable, in that several of the
chief Captains of the enemy were at this time killed or taken; amongst whom was
Canonehet (who came down to got seed-corn to plant at Squakheag) he was the
chief Sachem of all the Narrhagansets: the son of Miantonimoh, and the heir of
all his fathers pride and insolency, as well as of his malice against the
English, a most perfidious villain, who had the last October been at Boston,
pretending to make a firm peace with the English, but never intending to keep
one Article thereof: Therefore as a just reward of his wickedness was he
adjudged by those that took him to dye, which was accordingly put in execution
at Stonington, whither he was carried: There his head being cut off was carried
to Hartford: The Mohegins and Pequods that had the honor to take him prisoner,
having the honor likewise of doing justice upon him, and that by the prudent
advice of the English Commanders, thereby the more firmly to engage the said
Indians against the treacherous Narrhagansets. There are differing reports
about the manner of his taking, and by whom, whither the Indians or the English
first took him, however it was sufficient matter of rejoicing to all the
Colonyes of the English, that the Ringleader of almost all this mischief, and
great Incendiary betwixt the Narhagansets and us, dyed himself by that sword of
war which he had drawn against others.

Not long after Capt. George Denison of Stonington, with sixty six Volunteirs,
and an hundred and twelve Pequods, killed and took seventy and six of the
enemy, amongst whom were two Narrhaganset Sachems, one of which was the
Grandchild of Pomham (who is accounted the most warlike and the best soldier
of all the Narrhaganset Sachems) taking at the same time 160. bushels of the
enemies corn, no small damage to our Enemies at that time, and all this without
the loss of one man of the said Captains followers.

The greatest mischief which after this time was done by the enemy in Plymouth
Colony, was by burning of houses and barns, which they might easily do, the
Inhabitants in most of those Towns being repaired to garrison houses for their
greater security: For about the 20 th. of April, fifty of the enemy burnt about
nineteen houses and barns at Situate, but were so resolutely encountered by a
few of the Inhabitants, that they were driven away, and thereby prevented from
doing of further mischief.

Not long after, May. 8. they burned about seventeen houses and barns in
Bridge-water, a small town in Plymouth Colony, twenty seven miles on this side
Taunton, but it pleased God just at the time to send a Thunder-shower, which
put out the fire, or else it might have prevailed much further.

It is very remarkable, that the Inhabitants of the said Bridge-water never yet
lost one person by the sword of the enemy, though the town is situate within
Plymouth Colony, yet have they helped to destroy many of the enemy. None knows
either love or hatred by all that is before them in things of this nature: nor
ought standers by that may escape think, themselves less sinners then those
that so perish by the sword of the enemy: Yet about this time four of the
Inhabitants of Taunton were killed, as they were at their work in the field,
whereby it is said, thirty children were made Fatherless: So unsearchable are
the judgments of the Almighty, and his ways past finding out.

During these Calamities, Gods Dispensations have been very various, as well in
reference unto Towns and Villages, as unto persons: As if some places had been
by special providence marked out to preservation, as others unto destruction;
of which no other reason can be rendered according unto man, then the good
pleasure of God so to order and dispose of events, which sometimes as Solomon
says are all one to the good, and to the clean, and to the unclean.

And because special notice is taken of the Town of Bridge-water, the which
although it is seated, as it were, in the midst of danger, and has been often
assaulted by considerable numbers of the Enemy, yet never lost any one of their
Inhabitants, young or old; a particular account shall here be given of the most
remarkable passages of divine providence relating to that Plantation since the
War began. June 26. 1675 When Philips malice against the English, mixed with a
particular prejudice against Governor Winslow, began to boil up to the height
of an open Rebellion, the people of Swanzy being like to be distressed by the
Indians, a Post was instantly sent to the Governor of Plymouth, the way lying
through Bridge-water, the said Post returned the next day: and about 9 or 10 of
the clock, as he passed through the Town, left an Order from the Governor for
the raising of twenty men, well armed and furnished with Horses, to be
forthwith dispatched away for the relief of Swanzy; seventeen were all that
could be raised on the sudden, who were sent thither that night, and were the
first that were upon their march in all the Country; and possibly they fared
not the worse for their forwardness: as Deborah the Prophetess, blessed God
for, them that offered themselves willingly among the People: These seventeen
of Bridge-water were June 21. ordered by Capt. Bradford to Metapoisit a place
at twelve miles distance from Swanzy, to strengthen the Garrison at one Bourns
House, wherein were seventy persons, amongst whom were only found sixteen men.
After they had marched five miles of their way, having Mr. Browns Son for their
Pilot, they met with some Swanzy people, newly turned out of their Houses (by
which they were to pass) who having not as yet resisted unto Blood, yet made
doleful lamentations, wringing of their hands; and bewailing of their losses,
very much also persuading Bridge-water men to turn back, because of the danger,
but they having so clear a call, had also more courage, then cowardly to desert
the cause of God and his People, lest they should thereby betray the lives of
so many of their friends into the Enemies hands; and so by the good hand of God
toward them, came safe to Metapoiset that night.

The next day in the morning, a part of them went to guard Mr. Brown their
Pilot back to his quarters; in their return they came suddenly upon a party of
Indians, about thirty in all; they were within shot one of another, but the
English having no Commission to fight, till they were assaulted, and not being
impeached in their passage, they returned safe to their Garrison at Metapoiset:
the Indians presently drawing off, and firing three Guns (though not with
intent to do them any hurt, as was conceived) gave a shout, and so left them,
when this party of the English drew near to their Garrison, they met with a
company of Carts going to fetch Corn from an house deserted near by, about a
quarter of a mile off from Mr. Bournes House, the Soldiers gave them notice of
the Indians which they had discovered, and withal advised them by no means to
venture any more, because of the danger; but they were resolved notwithstanding
these earnest persuasions of the Soldiers to have another turn, which they
soon found to be to the peril of their own lives, six of them being presently
after either killed right out, or mortally wounded, as soon as they came to the
Barn where was the Corn; these six are said to be the first that were slain in
this quarrel. The Soldiers at the Garrison hearing the Guns, made what haste
they could to the place, but being most of them in that interim, gone to look
their Horses they could not come time enough to the relief of their friends,
yet upon their approach, they who had done the mischief presently fled away:
one Jones hard pursued by two Indians was by their coming delivered from the
extent of the Enemies cruelty, but having received his mortal wound, had only
that favor thereby, to die in the Arms of his friends, though by the wounds
received from his Enemies.

The next week, fifteen of those Soldiers looking after their Horses, fell
into an Ambush of twenty of the Indians, but being prepared for the encounter,
they discharged their Guns upon each other: but our men received no hurt, some
of them felt the wind of the bullets passing by their faces; what damage the
Enemy received is uncertain, yet some of the English report they found some of
their enemies dead bodies in the place afterward.

Thus were they not only preserved in many perils themselves, but became
instrumental also; for the preservation of most of that Garrison, who with their
goods by their means, with the help of a small party of Plymouth Forces sent
thither after the six were killed (as is mentioned before) were soon after
transported safely to Roud Island.

Many outrages were that Summer committed upon their Neighbors at Taunton and
Namasket, yet it pleased God to protect this poor Town of Bridge-water from any
other hurt; till the beginning of April next, when themselves with their
Neighbors of Taunton and Rehoboth, were strongly solicited to desert their
Dwellings, and repair down to the Towns by the Sea side, but God encouraged
them to keep their stations notwithstanding the extreme danger then presented.
It is reported that Philip gave order that Taunton and Bridge-water should not
be destroyed till the last, which is all the favor to be expected from an
enemy, but these things are only in the hands of God, and not to be determined
by man.

April 9. being Lords day, A small party of the Enemy came down upon the said
Bridge-water, burnt an out-house and barn, broke up and rifled several other
houses in the same quarter of the Town, which are notwithstanding yet
remaining; they sent out a party of their men to pursue them that night, and
many days after, but could not hear of them.

May 7. the Lords day also (no doubt but the betterness of the day, will
increase the badness of their deed attempted thereon) they had intelligence of
a great body of Indians dispersed that way, with intent to have fallen upon the
Town that very day, but were casually prevented by a great deal of rain that
fell the night before: however they were resolved to foreslow no opportunity,
wherefore on the next day ( May 8. about three hundred of them, one Tisguogen
being their chief Leader, at 8 or 9 in the morning made an assault upon the
east end of the Town, on the South side of the River: many of the Inhabitants
stayed at home that morning because of the intelligence the day before, and so
were the more ready to entertain them; some that not taking that warning
vertured into the field about their occasions, were in danger of surprizal, but
by the special favor of God, escaped, and came time enough to help defend
their own and their neighbors dwellings, being shot at, and hard pursued a
considerable way.

The Indians presently began to fire the town, but it pleased God so to spirit
and encourage several of the Inhabitants, issuing out of their Garrison houses;
that they fell upon them with great resolution, and beat them off; at the same
instant of time, the Lord of Hosts also fighting for them from heaven, by
sending a storm of thunder and rain very seasonably, which prevented the
burning of the houses which were fired: The Soldiers also fighting under the
banner of Gods special protection were so successful in repelling the Enemy,
that they neither had any of the Inhabitants killed or taken, and but one
wounded. The Indians by this stout resistance, being beaten off to the skirts
of the Town, made a fresh onset upon another quarter thereof, on the north side
of the River where they had done much more mischief, but that God stirred up
sundry of the people to venture out of their fortified houses, who fired upon
the enemy, and beat them from their dwellings, so as in the evening they drew
off to an out-house, three miles distant from the town: the next day the
Inhabitants expected another assault, but the enemy having burned the house and
barn, where they kept their Rendezvouze over night, and one house more not far
distant, they marched all clear away for that time.

Thus it pleased God so to order his dispensations, toward this small Town, as
a brand plucked out of the fire, that they did but just taste of this bitter
cup, which others drank deeper of; yet had they not such mercy, as these had,
mixed therewith: under God, the courage of the Inhabitants was a great means of
their preservation, for they fired so stoutly upon the Enemies, that they durst
not come very near any of the Garisoned Houses, saluting them only at a
distance. God was eminently seen upholding the spirits of all sorts, men and
women, so as no consternation of mind was seen upon any of them, during the
whole time of the dispute.

In this assault they lost but thirteen dwelling-houses, whereof five only were
in the Town (the rest being outhouses and deserted for the present) with some
few Barns, and some of their Cattle; all which was a very inconsiderable loss,
in comparison of what befell others, and themselves might have endured, if God
had not by his special favor prevented,

July 14, and 15. Another party of Indians came down upon the North-west side
of the Town, but with no better success; for they had no Commission from the
Lord of Hosts to touch any of the persons of the Inhabitants, their power
reaching only to the slaying of their Cattle at this time.

July 18, 19, 20. They sent our parties after the Enemy to pursue them by their
Track, who fell upon some of them. On the twentieth they took sixteen, whereof
two were men: on this day they had to assist them, it seems some of the Bay
Indians sent them from Captain Brattle; some of the Captives informed, that
there were but 70 or 80. in the Company, and but ten or twelve men amongst
them: but within a few days, these Bridge-water-men, shall find better
success in pursuit of their Enemies, when Philip himself shall hardly escape
their hands as shall be seen afterward.

While one party of the Enemy thus acted their part in and about Plymouth
Colony. toward the Seacoast, other parties of them were not idle in the
Massachusetts Colony, where they assaulted many places, doing what mischief they
could by firing of Houses, and killing several persons in the inland
Plantations.

March 2. They assaulted Groton: the next day over night Major Willard with
seventy Horse came into the Town; forty Foot also came up to their relief from
Watertown, but the Indians were all fled, having first burned all the Houses in
the Town, save four that were Garisoned, the Meeting House being the second
house they fired, Soon after Capt. Sill was sent with a small Party of Dragoons
of 8 Files to fetch off the Inhabitants of Groton, and what was left from the
spoil of the enemy, having under his conduct about sixty Carts, being in depth
from front to rear above two mile: when a party of Indians lying in ambush, at
a place of eminent advantage, fired upon the front and mortally wounded two of
the vaunt Carriers, who dyed both the next night; and might (had God permitted)
have done eminent damage to the whole Body, it being a full hour before the
whole Body could be drawn up, which was done with care and Courage: but the
Indians after a few more shot made. without doing harm, retired, and made no
further assault upon them, being the same Party of Indians which the day before
had burned some part of Chelmsford. Soon after this Village was deserted and
destroyed by the enemy: yet was it a special providence, that though the carts
were guarded with so slender a Convoy, yet there was not any considerable loss
sustained.

The Surprizall of Groton was after this manner.

On March, 2. The Indians came in the night and rifled eight or nine houses and
carried away some cattle, and alarmed the Town.

On March, 9. About ten in the morning, a parcel of Indians (having two days
lurked in the town, and taken possession of three outhouses and feasted
themselves with corn, diverse swine and poultry which they there seized) laid an
ambush for two Carts, which went from their garrison to fetch in some hay,
attended with four men, two of which espying the enemy, made a difficult
escape, the other two were set upon, and one of them slain, stripped naked, his
body mangled, and dragged into the highway, and laid on his back in a most
shameful manner: the other taken Captive; and after sentenced to death, but
the enemy not concuring in the manner of it, execution was deferred, and he by
the providence of God escaped by a bold attempt the night before he was
designed to slaughter, and fled to the Garrison at Lancaster, the cattle in both
towns wounded, and five of them slain outright.

March, 13. Was the day when the enemy came in a full body, by there own
account 400. and thought by the Inhabitants to be not many fewer. The town was
at this time (having been put into a fright by the sad Catastrophe of Lancaster
the next bordering town) gathered into five Garrisons, four of which were so
near together, as to be able to command from one to the other, between which
were the cattle belonging to those Families driven into pastures, which
afterward proved their preservation; the other was near a mile distant from the
rest.

This morning the Indians (having in the night placed themselves in several
parts of the town) made their Onset; which began near the four Garrisons; for a
body of them having placed themselves in Ambuscado, behind a hill, near one of
the Garrisons, two of them made discovery of themselves, as if they had stood
upon discovery. At this time diverse of the people, nothing suspecting any such
matter (for the day before, many had been upon discovery many miles, and found
no signs of an Enemy being so near) were attending their occasions, some
foddering their cattle, some milking their Cows, of whom the Enemy might easily
have made a seizure, but God prevented; they having another design in hand, as
soon after appeared: These two Indians were at length espied, and the Alarm
given; whereupon the most of the men in the next Garrison, and some also of the
second (which was about eight or nine pole distant) drew out and went to
surprise these two Indians, who kept their station till our men reached the
brow of the hill, then arose the ambush and discharged a volley upon them,
which caused a disorderly retreat, or rather a rout, in which one was slain,
and three others wounded: mean while another ambush had risen, and come upon
the back side of the Garrison so deserted of men, and pulled down the
Palizadoes: The Soldiery in this rout, retreated not to their own, but passed
by to the next Garrison, the women and children mean while exposed to hazard,
but by the goodness of God made a safe escape to the other fortified house
without any harm, leaving their substance to the enemy, who made a prey of it,
and spent the residue of the day in removing the corn and household stuff (in
which loss five Familyes were impoverished) and firing upon the other Garrison:
here also they took some Cattle. No sooner was the signal given by the first
volley of shot, but immediately in several parts of the town at once, did the
smoakes arise, they firing the houses.

In the afternoon they used a stratagem not unlike the other, to have surprised
the single Garrison, but God prevented. An old Indian if an Indian passed along
the street with a black sheep on his back, with a slow pace, as one decrepit:
They made several shot at him, but missed him, at which several issued out to
have taken him alive, but the Watchman seasonably espying an ambush behind the
house, gave the signal, whereby they were prevented.

The night following the enemy lodged in the town, some of them in the Garrison
they had surprised, but the Body of them in an adjacent valley, where they made
themselves merry after their savage manner. The next morning they gave two or
three Volleyes at Capt. Parkers Garrison, and so marched off, fearing as was
thought that supply might be nigh at hand. This assault of theirs was managed
with their wonted subtlety and barbarous cruelty: for they stripped the body of
him whom they had slain in the first onset, and then cutting off his head,
fixed it upon a pole looking toward his own land. The corpse of the man slain
the week before, they dug up out of his grave, they cut off his head and one
leg, and set them upon poles, and stripped off his winding sheet. An Infant which
they found dead in the house first surprised, they cut in pieces, which
afterward they cast to the swine. There were about forty dwelling houses burnt
at that time, besides other buildings. This desolation was followed with the
breaking up of the town, and scattering of the Inhabitants, and removal of the
Candlestick, after it had been there seated above twelve years.

Concerning the surprising of Groton, March 13. There was not any thing much
more material, then what is already mentioned, save only the insolency of John
Monoco or one eyed John, the chief Captain of the Indians in that design; who
having by a sudden surprizal early in the morning seized upon a Garrison house
in one end of the Town, continued in it, plundering what was there ready at
hand, all that day; and at night did very familiarly in appearance, call out to
Capt. Parker that was lodged in another Garrison house, and entertained a great
deal of Discourse with him, whom he called his old Neighbor: dilating upon the
cause of the War, and putting an end to it by a friendly peace: yet often mixing
bitter Sarcasmes, with several blasphemous scoffs and taunts at their praying
and worshipping God in the meeting house, which he deridingly said he had
burned. Among other things which he boastingly uttered that night: he said he
burnt Medfield (though it be not known whither he was there personally present
or no) Lancaster, and that now he would burn that Town of Groton, and the next
time he would burn Chelmsford, Concord, Watertown, Cambridge, Charlstown,
Roxbury, Boston, adding at last in their Dialect, What Me will, Me do: not much
unlike the proud Assyrian (if his power had been equal to his pride) sometime
threatened against Jerusalem, but was by the remarkable providence of God, so
confounded within a few months after, that he was bereft of his four hundred
and fourscore (of which he now boasted) and only with a few more Bragadozio's
like himself, Sagamore Sam, old Jethro, and the Sagamore of Quobaog were taken
by the English, and was seen (not long before the writing of this) marching
toward the Gallows (through Boston Streets, which he threatened to burn at his
pleasure) with an Halter about his neck, with which he was hanged at the Towns
end, September 26. in this present year 1676. So let thine Enemies perish O
Lord, and such contempt be poured on all them that open their mouths to
blaspheme thy holy Name.

Things looked with a pretty sad face about those parts at this time; yet
though the Righteous fall seven times, let not their Enemies rejoice, for the
Righteous shall rise again, but their wicked Enemies shall fall into mischief,
and rise no more. It was ebbing water with New England at this time, and a
while after; but God shall turn the stream before it be long, and bring down
their Enemies to lick the dust before them.

After this April 17. Captain Sill, being appointed to keep Garrison at Groton,
some Indians coming to hunt for Swine, three Indians drew near the Garrison
house, supposing it to have been deserted, were two of them slain by one single
shot made by the Captains own hands, and the third by another shot made from
the Garrison.

The danger which these inland Towns were like to be exposed unto from the
Enemy, after they were driven out of the Narrhaganset Country, was foreseen by
the Council of the Massachusetts, yea they had some intimation thereof from the
Enemy themselves: but they were not well able to prevent it, in that
unseasonable time of the year; no way fit for marching of Soldiers, and
transporting of Provisions (the Winter then beginning to break up in this
Country) for while our Forces were up in the Narrhaganset Country, in the
Winter, a couple of Christian Indians were sent as Spies into the Nipnet and
Narrhaganset Country, through the Woods in the depth of Winter, when the ways
were impassable for any other sort of people: these two, by name James and Job
ordered their business so prudently, as that they were admitted into those
Indian habitations, as Friends, and had free liberty of Discourse with them;
they were at the first a little jealous of them, but by the means of one eyed
John (a great Captain of the Indians, that afterward led them that spoiled
Groton, who having been a Companion of one of the said Spies both in Hunting
and in fighting against the Mohawks formerly; so esteemed of him, that he would
not suffer any of the rest to touch him) they passed through all the Indian
Towns lying thirty miles distant from Quobaog, and twenty miles northward of
the Road to Connecticut: one of the said Spies returned about Jan. 24.
informing those that sent him, what he had observed, both the number of the
Indians (about three hundred in all) also their several Towns, and what
provision they had: plenty of Venison, much Pork from the English men's Hogs
which they had taken, they confessed likewise that he and some of his party had
killed the People at Nashaway the last year, suspected to have been done by the
Indians of Malberough: he told them also they intended to burn Lancaster within
three weeks after that time, which accordingly they did much about the same
time: adding moreover that some Frenchmen were with them at Pocomptuck,
encouraging of them to go on with their designs, promising them assistance,
which made some ready to think the Indians were stirred up by the French to do
all this mischief, but more of that afterward: what might be gathered from the
foresaid premises is easy to conceive; whereupon new Forces with as much speed
as the season would allow were raised and sent up into those parts, under the
command of Major Savage in chief: they were dispatched away in the beginning of
March, and appointed to meet with such as should be sent from Connecticut
Colony, which they did about Quabaog, and so intended to march directly up to
those Indian Towns about Watchuset Hill to the Northwest: but the Indians were
gone, and our Forces in the pursuit of them, taking the wrong path missed of
them, yet ranging through those woods, they were at one time sudenly assaulted
by a small party of Indians firing upon them, wounding Mr. Gershom Bulkly, by a
shot in his Thigh, and killing one of their Soldiers, after which as they
marched along, they accidentally fell upon another small party of the Enemy, of
whom they slew some, and took others, to the number of sixteen, yet could not
meet with the main Body of the Enemy who it seems had passed over a great River
by Rafts, so our men could follow them no further, wherefore turning down
toward Hadly and North-hampton, whether it was supposed the Indians intended
to pass, They came very seasonably to the relief of the said Towns, which else
had been in danger of being lost. For,

March 14. The Enemy fell upon North-Hampton, and in three places broke through
the Fortification of Palizadoes, set up round about the Town a little before,
for their better security: but the Town being at that time full of Soldiers,
they were quickly repulsed, after they had killed four men, and two women, and
fired four or five dwelling houses, and as many barns, with the loss of many of
their lives as was supposed.

While our Forces under Major Savage continued on that side of the Country, a
sad accident fell out at Springfield, the certainty of which, it is judged meet
here to relate, to prevent mistakes: the matter having through a great
oversight been otherwise represented, then indeed it was, not only to the
prejudice of Truth, but to the disadvantage of some persons concerned therein.
While the Soldiers were quartered amongst the several Towns upon Cinnecticut
River; a party of the Troop were quartered at a place belonging to Springfield
called the Long Meadow, three miles from the Town below toward Windsor: several
of the Inhabitants having most of the Winter kept from the public meeting on
the Lords days, for fear of the Enemy, were encouraged to adventure to the
Assembly, on the 26 of March, riding in the company of the Troopers; but having
heard of no Indians thereabouts a good while, were more secure then they had
cause; for riding some of them with women behind them, and some with their
Children in their Arms yet not so careful as to keep in the middle, but rather
in the Rear, and at a pretty distance straggling from the rest of the Company, a
party of Indians lying in the Bushes as they rode along, fired upon the
hindmost, and killed two and wounded others: those in the Front having also
Women and Maids behind some of them, were at a stand to know what to do,
fearing they might expose those Women they had in their company, if they should
ride back (in that winding Road made through a woody place for a mile or two
together) to look after them that were behind, at the last one that came riding
up, told the foremost company there was no hurt, and that they were all coming:
they that were before rode away with all speed to the end of the Town, where
setting down the Women, the Troopers returned back, but too late to recover too
poor Women and two children, who upon the first assault were thrown off their
horses, and immediately haled into the Bushes, and through a swamp on the other
side of a steep Bark, so as they could not be heard of all that afternoon, nor
the next day, till toward night, although they were diligently searched after
by all the Troopers in and about the Town; At last when they were discryed just
by a Swamp side, the cruel wretches endeavored to have killed them all, but in
haste only wounded them with their hatchets, yet so as one of the poor
creatures recovered; the other with the children dyed of their wounds before
they were brought home, or within a little time after. They did not complain of
any incivility toward them while they were in their power; but by the Farewell
given them at their parting, they found it true by their own experience, that
the tender mercyes of the wicked are cruelty.

There happened no other matter of moment worthy the reporting, while our Forces
tarryed in those parts, and the Commanders observing that the enemy was turned
back again through the Woods, toward the Massachusetts Bay, after a months time
retired back, yet could never meet with the enemy in their return through the
Woods, although while they were at the towns aforesaid, they understood of
several attempts made upon Sudbury, Marlberough, the most part of which last
they destroyed March 26. which made the Inhabitants forsake their Dwellings,
leaving only a few houses garisoned with Soldiers, the better to secure a
passage to the towns westward upon Connecticut River.

The Inhabitants of Sudbury, with the soldiers under Leiut. Jacobs of
Marlberough sufficiently alarmed by the late mischief done about those Towns,
resolved to try what work they could make with the enemy in the night,
whereupon going forth March 27. toward morning, they discerned where the enemy
lay by their fires, (near three hundred of them) and that within half a mile of
a garrison house, near the place where they had done so much mischief the day
before. Such was the courage and resolution of the English, though but forty in
number, Townsmen and Soldiers, that they adventured to discharge upon them as
they lay by their fires, when it was so dark that an Indian could hardly be
discerned from a better man, yet God so directing, they discharged several
times upon them, wounded thirty, fourteen of whom either dyed of their wounds
the same day or soon after, which had been chief agents in this present
mischief against the English. Such was the success of this skirmish that the
Assailants came off without the loss of one man.

After this time the enemy began to scatter about in small parties, doing what
mischief they could about the Massachusetts, killing a man at Weymouth, another
at Hingham, as they lay skulking up and down in Swamps and holes, to assault
any that occasionally looked never so little into the woods, sometimes alarming
the towns about Boston by discharging gunns upon particular persons; at
Billerica, Braintree, and at Reutham, near about which place in the Road to
Rehoboth, they assaulted one Woodcocks house, killed one man, and one of his
sons, wounded another, and burned his sons house.

Notwithstanding the little success of former attempts, Philip and his men have
one prize more to play in the Massachusetts Colony, before they go off the
stage, and then we shall soon see their power visibly declining every where,
until their final overthrow come upon them. There were several small Parties
of them scattered up and down all over the Country, yet the main Body of them
was still lurking up and down in those woods that lie between Brookefield,
Marlburrough and Connecticut River. Possibly they had some hope of driving all
the Country before them to the towns upon the seacoast; for having burned the
deserted houses at Marlburrough, April, 17. the next day they set upon Sudbury
with all their might, (hoping it is like) to do there, as they had done at the
Towns next beyond it. They did at the first prevail so far as to consume
several houses, and barns, and kill several persons, ten or twelve of the
English, that came from Concord to assist their neighbors at Sudbury, a town
distant five miles from them, at the first hearing of the alarm; who unawares
were surprised near a Garrison house, in hope of getting some advantage upon a
small Party of the enemy that presented themselves in a Meadow; a great number
of Indians that lay unseen in the bushes, suddenly rose up, and intercepting
the passage to the Garrison house, killed and took them all.

But our sorrows and losses that day are not yet come to their height; for in
the after part of the same day, that resolute stout-hearted Soldier, Capt.
Wadsworth (who had not long before, with not above forty men, rescued
Lancaster, when it was in danger to have been all lost at once) being sent from
Boston with fifty Soldiers to relieve Marlburrough, having m^rched five and
twenty miles, and then understanding the Enemy was gone through the Woods
toward Sudbury: this unwearied Company, before ever they had taken any
considerable rest, marched immedietely back toward Sudbury (that lies ten miles
nearer Boston) and being come within a mile of the Town, they espied a party of
Indians not far from them, about an hundred, not more, as they conceived, these
they might easily deal with; who retiring back a while, drew Capt. Wadsworth
and his Company above a mile into the Woods, when on the sudden a great body of
the Enemy appeared, about five hundred as was thought, who compassing them in
round, forced them to the top of an hill, where they made very stout resistance
a considerable while; but the night drawing on, and some of the Company
beginning to scatter from the rest, their fellows were forced to follow them,
so as the Enemy taking the chase, pursued them on every side, as they made too
hasty a retreat, by which accident, being so much overpowred by the Enemies
numbers, they were most of them lost: the Captain himself, with one Captain
Brocklebank (a choice spirited man, much lamented by the Town of Rowly to which
he belonged) and some others that fell into his Company as he marched along,
scarce twenty escaping in all; so as another Captain and his fifty perished at
that time, of as brave Soldiers as any were ever employed in the present
service.

Thus as in former attempts of like nature; too much courage and eagerness in
pursuit of the Enemy, has added another fatal blow to this poor Country.

The same day another party of the English coming from Brookefield, whithey
they were sent as a Convoy with Provision for the Garrison, were in danger
likewise of falling into the hands of the same Indians, yet riding upon a good
speed, and keeping their Guns always ready presented against them they met,
they never durst fire at them: only three or four having unadvisedly first
discharged their gunns against the Enemy, and falling too much in the rear of
their Company, were cut off and lost. It is reported by some that afterward
escaped, how they cruelly tortured five or six of the English that night: yet
whatever their success was this day, it was observed by some (at that time
their Prisoners, and since released) that they seemed very pensive after they
came to their Quarters, showing no such signs of rejoicing, as they usually
were wont to do in like case; whither for the loss of some of their own
Company in that days enterprise, (said to be an hundred and twenty) or whither
it were the Devil in whom they trusted, and to whom they made their address the
day before, by sundry Conjurations of their Powawes? or whither it were by any
dread that the Almighty sent upon their spirits, upon their execrable
Blasphemies, which it is said they used in the torturing of some of their poor
Captives (bidding Jesus come and deliver them out of their hands from death if
he could) we leave as uncertain, though some have so reported, yet sure it is
that after this day, they never prospered in any attempt they made against the
English, but were continually scattered and broken, till they were in a manner
all consumed. After this time, however they had braved it before, they seemed
to apprehend that it was scarce feasible for them to withstand the power of the
English, and therefore seemed more inclinable to a peace, by several overtures
made by them, if they knew how to have brought it about. For during these
encounters they were willing to admit of some kind of treaty with the English,
about the releasing of sundry of their Captives, which they took at Lancaster
in February last, and elsewhere: To that end sundry attempts were made by help
of several of the Praying Indians (as they use to be called) about the
redemption of some of the women and children, which were at time in their
possession, and by degrees something was effected that way: possibly their own
present sufferings and wants that were upon them, might induce them thereunto:
For by this time the Spring of the year came on, their provision was all spent,
and they forced to live wholly upon ground-nuts, and upon the flesh of the
English creatures, both horse and neat cattle, which they daily plundered. The
Ground-nuts running up to seed in the summer, began to grow so sticky, as they
were scarce eatable; the flesh also of the English cattle proving unwholesome
for their Bodies, filling them with sundry diseases. One of them having eaten
much horseflesh, complained that he had before eaten horse, and now horse
began to eat him, meaning some deadly disease growing upon his eating such
rank flesh, unwholesome for their Bodies, especially without salt, as their
usual manner is. The fishing season also began now to come in, wherein they use
to take abundance of all sorts, with which those great Rivers up the Country
are abundantly stored: they use to take thereof, and drying it in the smoke,
make provision thereof for the greatest part of the year; and if the war
continued, they could not but see they should utterly be cut off therefrom, and
that if the planting season also were lost, they should be in great want of
summer fruits, sc. beans and squashes (besides their corn) with which they were
wont to live all the latter part of the summer. Upon all considerations, they
seemed pretty inclinable to hearken to a peace, though some were apt to think
they would never have kept it, further then would stand with their own
advantage, and that their present desire thereof was only to gain time.

A person formerly acquainted with the Indians about Lancaster, did adventure
upon the forementioned overtures, to go amongst them to try if he could not
prevail with them for the redemption of the Ministers wife, taken Captive in
Febraury last from Lancaster, and through the favor of him who having the
hearts of all in his hand, inclines them as he pleases, obtained the desired
end upon an inconsiderable sum, which gave encouragement to the Council to
send two Messengers on the like errand the same week, to procure the redemption
of others, not without success: The former, viz. Mrs. Rowlandson being brought
to Boston upon the Election day, May, 3 d. it was generally looked at as a
smile of providence, and doubtless was a return of prayer, and answer of faith,
with which her husband had been upheld, and supported from the day of her
Captivity; his two children also were returned back not long after, more by the
overruling hand of God ( that turns the Captivity of his people as the
streams of the South; and sometimes inclining them to pity his Servants, that
are of themselves more cruel then the Sea Monsters) then by any other
contrivance of man's policy,

And yet notwithstanding motions of this nature about the redemption of some of
our Prisoners still in their hands, there was no cessation of arms between us.

About this time Letters were sent down from Connecticut Colony, informing the
General Court then assembled at Boston, that some of the Mohawkes (a sort of
fierce and savage Indians, yet mortal enemies to these we were at wars
withal) had fallen upon some of Philips. Party, and destroyed many of them:
likewise that many of them were destroyed by Fevers and Fluxes, with other
distempers falling amongst them, which was some reviving to our hopes, that the
foot of our enemy should slide in due time, and that destruction was hastening
upon them, though still they were permitted to do mischief in sundry particular
places of the Country, which must be minded as we pass along.

Those Indians that were our professed enemies, after they had been beaten out
of the Narrhaganset Country, Febr. 1. tarried awhile at Winimazeag, a place two
days journey north of Quabaog, where they divided themselves into two
Companies, one of them tarried on that side the Country, the other made toward
Plymouth Colony, taking Medfield in their way, from whence as they marched
along they met with a notable repulse at Boggiston, a small Hamlet, or Company
of Farms not far from the said Medfield where they attempted a Garrison, but
meeting with stout resistance, they left the enterprise; and kept on their way
toward Plymouth Colony, where they scattered themselves up and down, waiting
for opportunityes to spoil and destroy the English Plantations on that side of
the Country.

Besides what is already mentioned, on May, 11. a party of them assaulted the
town of Plymouth, burnt eleven houses and five barns belonging thereunto: on
the other side, a small party of the English scouting about in pursuit of the
Indians, fell upon a Party of them, that lay waiting in ambush; but being
discerned by an Indian in the Company of our men that gave timely notice, our
soldiers had an opportuity thereby to make the first shot, and thereby not
only prevented a mischief to themselves, but killed also some of the enemy,
(one of whom was observed to be of more note then his fellows by his attire)
the rest fled away from them that pursued, though but a small company; so that
there were daily reciprocal acts of hostility in those parts.

Within a few days after this, seven houses and two barns more were burnt by
the enemy, in and about Plymouth: who did the like mischief about the same time
to the remaining houses of Namasket or Middleborough.

About this time, another sort of Indians that belonged to Wamesit a place near
Chelmsford, bordering upon Merrimack (who had been provoked by the rash,
unadvised, cruel act of some of the English, about October. 27. and November. 4.
had fired upon them several gunns, both at Chelmsford and Woburn, to the
killing of some, and wounding of others upon suspicion that the said Indians
were guilty of burning a Barn, and Hay-stack not far off) suddenly turned our
enemies, after the winter was over; having first withdrawn themselves from the
place assigned them, and where they had been relieved all the winter (some of
them after a former revolt) and took their opportunity to fire Mr. Falconers
house in Andover town early that Spring, and wounded one Roger Marks, and
killed his horse. Two more houses about Shawshin beyond the said Andover, were
burned about Mar. 10. Also they killed a young man of the said town, Apr. 8.
the son of George Abbot; And another son of his also was carried away the same
day, who yet was returned some few months after, almost pined to death with
hunger.

At the same time they killed some of their Cattle, cutting out only the
tongues of some of them for haste, being shot at by several of the Inhabitants
from their Garrisons.

Mar. 10. At Concord two men going for Hay one of them was killed.

At Chelmsford, the said Wamesit Indians, about March 18 before, fell upon some
houses on the north side of the River; burnt down three or four that belonged
to the Family of Edward Colburn: the said Colburn, with Samuel Varnham his
neighbor, being pursued, as they passed over the River to look after their
Cattle on that side of the river; and making several shots against them, who
returned the like again upon the said Indians, (judged to be about forty) what
success they had upon the enemy, was best known to themselves; but two of
Varnhams sons were slain by the enemies shot before they could recover the
other side of the River. Apr. 15. also were 14. or 15. houses burnt there.

Not long before this, Febr. 1. 1675. Tho. Eames that kept a Farm at Sudbury,
whose dwelling was three or four miles out of the town, had his house assaulted
and fired, his wife killed, and his children carried Captive among the Indians.

Also two men were killed at a Farm about Concord, Isaac and Jacob Shepard by
name, about the middle of February, and a young maid that was set to watch upon
an hill, of about 15. years of age, was carried Captive; who strangly escaped
away upon an horse that the Indians had taken from Lancaster a little before.
In the like strange manner did one of Eames his children escape away about May
3. last; traveling thirty miles alone in the woods, without any relief till he
came to an English town. Eames his house was assaulted when himself was from
home, by an Indian called Netus (not long after slain at Malborough) which had
been very familiar with the English, with nine or ten more of his company, as
perfidious and barbarous as himself: They burned all the dwellings that
belonged to the Farm, Corn, Hay and Cattle, besides the dwelling house with
what was therein; it is probable those at Concord were killed by the same hands
about a fortnight after.

Many such like remarkable instances of special providence might be mentioned,
if it were convenient to insert such particular passages into the general
Narrative of the late troubles from our barbarous enemies.

On May 3. a party of them killed a man at Haverhill, upon the edge of
Merrimack River; and passing over the said River to Bradford, spoiled another
Family; killing one Thomas Kemball, and carrying his wife and five Children
captive, forty miles up into the woods; although it was questioned whether this
last mischief were done by any of Philips party, but rather by some that
belonged to the Eastward Indians, of which there may be occasion (God willing)
to speak more afterward.

For the suppressing of these insolences, several Companies of fresh
soldiers, both horse and Foot were raised in the Massachusetts, by the
Governor and Council of that Colony, and sent out to suppress the common
enemy; the Foot under the command of Capt. Sill, Capt. Cutler, Capt. Holbrook,
the Horse under the Command of Capt. Brattle, Capt. Prentice, Capt. Henchman,
Commander in chief: these several Companies modelled as aforesaid, were sent
out Apr. 27. 1676. to range the woods toward Hassanamesit.

Upon the 6. of May, they met with a considerable party of the enemy: they were
first discovered by the Natick scouts pursuing a Bear and at the first not
discerning that the Natick Indian scouts belonged to our men, it gave some
advantage to our forces; our Horsemen falling upon them before they were well
aware, killed and took of the Enemy about sixteen, which they took notice of at
the present, although it was confessed by the enemy, that they lost twenty that
encounter. It was reported that the sounding of a trumpet without order, did
much hurt, but the Commander in chief affirms, that it was no disadvantage to
the service in hand, it neither being heard by our own Foot, nor yet by the
enemy. If any error was committed by the English Companies, it was in that the
Horse did not timely enough draw down from the top of the hill, whereby they
came to be discovered by the enemy; who thereupon made the more haste to
escape: However it was no small loss to the enemy, some of the slain being
known to be considerable persons; and it struck such a terror into them, that
they never durst face our men afterward; for although after our men returned
to their Quarters at Medfield, they saw two hundred fires in the night, yet
they could never come near them again to fight any company of them: but the
season proving rainy, hindered any further pursuit of them at that time. And
soon after this the soldiers being visited with sickly distempers by reason of
an Epidemical Cold at that time prevailing through the Country, they were for
the present released for the recovery of their health, with intent to be called
together again at a more convenient time; this was done May the tenth.

During this interval of time, upon a report that a party of the Enemy that
were discovered about Rehoboth, busy in fishing in a River thereabouts, Capt.
Brattle was sent up about the 23d. of May, who with the help of some of the
Inhabitants, killed eleven or twelve of them without the loss but of one of our
men: Had they not discovered some of ours on the opposite shore, it was
conceived a greater spoil might have been made amongst them.

But in the next place we must take notice of the proceedings of the enemy
about Connecticut: The greatest Body of them made toward Plymouth Colony early
in the Spring as was said before, where we shall leave them for the present,
and observe what the remaining part of them did westward.

Some scattering parties were skulking about Springfield, and those lower
towns, upon a small numbe of whom Capt. Holioke (newly chosen Captain or
Springfield in the room of his father lately deceased) handselled his office,
early in the Spring: for having notice of some of them in those woods, he
marched after them with ten or twelve resolute young men, and waiting his
opportunity, surprised them near the great River, so as two or three of them
were left dead upon the place, another mortally wounded, got on to an Island in
the river, where it was concluded be took his last nights lodging The other
being sorely wounded, was taken alive, and brought home to Springfield, where
he confessed many things to one of the Inhabitants that understood their
language, owning the truth in many things against his own company, and soon
after dyed of his wounds.

This was but a Preparative to an higher piece of service, which Capt. Holioke
was soon after engaged in and wherein he acquitted himself beyond expectation;
and taking more pains then ordinary, in making his retreat, he gat a Surfeit,
that ended his days in September following about Boston.

About the beginning of April likewise some of the Inhabitants about Hadly,
attending their tillage at Hockanum, within three miles of the town, and having
a guard of soldiers with them, yet three of the company were casually slain by
a party of the enemy, that lay in wait for such an opportunity. One of them was
Mr. Goodman, a deacon of the Church, that went a little beyond the Command of
the Soldiers that came to guard them, to view the fence of his own land: and
two others that contrary to express order, would venture upon the top of an
high hill, near by, to take a needless and unseasonable view of the Country,
were shot down by the enemy before they could recover their Corpse du guard.

But the great Company of the enemy, that stayed on that side of the Country,
and about Watchuset Hills, when the rest went toward Plymouth, though they had
been disappointed in their planting, by the death of Canonchet, were loath to
loose the advantage of the fishing season then coming in; wherefore having
seated themselves near the upper Falls of Connecticut River, not far from
Deerfield, and perceiving that the English Forces were now drawn off from the
lower towns of Hadly and Northampton, now and then took advantages to plunder
them of their Cattle, and not fearing any assault from our Soldiers, grew a
little secure, while they were upon their Fishing design, insomuch that a
couple of English lads lately taken captive by the enemy, and making their
escape, acquainted their friends at home how secure they lay in those places,
which so animated the Inhabitants of Hadly, Hatfield and Northampton, that they
being willing to be revenged for the loss of their cattle, besides other
preceding mischiefs, took up a resolution with what strength they could raise
among themselves (partly out of garrison soldiers, and partly of the
Inhabitants) to make an assault upon them, which if it had been done with a
little more deliberation, waiting for the coming of supplies expected from
Hartford, might have proved a fatal business to all the said Indians: yet was
the victory obtained more considerable then at first was apprehended. For not
having much above an hundred and fifty fighting men in their Company, they
marched silently in the dead of the night, May 18. and came upon the said
Indians a little before break of day, whom they found almost in a dead sleep,
without any Scouts abroad, or watching about their wigwams at home; for in the
evening they had made themselves merry with new milk and roast beef, having
lately driven away many of their milch cows, as an English woman confessed,
that was made to milk them.

When they came near the Indians rendezvouze, they allighted off their horses,
and tied them to some young trees at a quarter of a miles distance, so marching
up, they fired amain into their very wigwams, killing many upon the place, and
frighting others with the sudden alarm of their Gunns, made them run into the
River, where the swiftness of the stream carrying them down a steep Fall, they
perished in the waters, some getting into Canooes, (small boats made of the
barks of Birchen trees) which proved to them a Charons boat, being sunk, or
overset, by the shooting of our men, delivered them into the like danger of the
waters, giving them thereby a pasport into the other world: others of them
creeping for shelter under the banks of the great river, were espied by our men
and killed with their swords; Capt. Holioke killing five, young and old, with
his own hands from under a bank. When the Indians were first awakened with the
thunder of their gunns, they cried out Mohawks, Mohawks, as if their own native
enemies had been upon them: but the dawning of the light, soon notified their
error, though it could not prevent the danger.

Such as came back spoke sparingly of the number of the slain, some say there
could not in reason be less then two or three hundred of them that must
necessarily perish in the midst of so many instruments of destruction managed
against them with such disadvantages to themselves. Some of their prisoners
afterward owned that they lost above three hundred in that Camizado, some
whereof were principal men Sachems, and some of their best fighting men that
were left, which made the victory more considerable then else it would have
been; nor did they seem ever to have recovered themselves after this defeat,
but their ruin immediately followed upon it. Yet such was the awful hand of
Providence, in the close of this victory, mixing much bitter with the sweet,
that it might well be called a costly victory to the Conquerors, that so no
flesh should glory in it self.

The Indians that lay scattering on both sides of the river, after they
recovered themselves, and discovered the small number of them that assailed
them, turned head upon the English, who in their retreat were a little
disordered, for want of the help of the eldest Captain, that was so enfeebled
by sickness before he set out, that he was no way able for want of bodily
strength (not any way defective for want of skill or courage) to assist or
direct in making the retreat: For some of the enemy fell upon the Guards that
kept the horses, others pursued them in the rear, so as our men sustained
pretty much damage as they retired, missing after their return thirty eight of
their men: And if Capt. Holioke had not played the man at a more then ordinary
rate, sometimes in the Front, sometimes in the flank and rear, at all times
encouraging the soldiers, it might have proved a fatal business to the
assailants. The said Capt. Holiokes horse was shot down under him, and himself
ready to be assaulted by many of the Indians, just coming upon him, but
discharging his pistolls upon one or two of them, whom he presently dispatched,
and another friend coming up to his rescue, he was saved, and so carried off
the soldiers without any further loss.

It is confidently reported by some that were there present at this engagement,
that one told above an hundred Indians left dead upon the place; and another
affirmed that he told near an hundred and forty swimming down the Falls, none
of which were observed to get alive to shore, save one.

The loss that befell our men in the retreat, was occasioned principally by the
bodily weakness of Capt. Turner, unable to manage his charge any longer, yet
some say they wanted powder, which forced them to retire as fast as they could
by Capt. Turners order.

It is said also by one present at the fight, that seven or eight in the rear
of the English, through haste missed their way, and were never heard of again;
and without doubt fell into the Indians hands, and it is feared some of them
were tortured.

About seven days after this, they were minded to try the chance of War
again, and see if they could not recover their loss, by returning the like upon
the English: For,

May 30. A great number of them appeared before Hatfield, fired about twelve
houses and barns without the Fortification of the town, driving away multitudes
of their Cattle, and their Sheep; spreading themselves in the meadow near the
town: which bravado so raised the courage of their neighbors at Hadly, that
twenty five resolute young men ventured over the river, to relieve Hatfield in
this distress, who charged the enemy with such undaunted courage and resolution
(Audaces fortuna juvat) that they beat down five or six at the first shot they
made, so making way through the thickest of their enemies, that lay ready to
take aim at them behind every tree, as they passed by; yet they escaped all
their shot till they came within a little of the town they came to relieve,
where they lost five of their twenty five.

The enemy being amazed at the resolution of our men, being but so small an
handful, that they fled immediately from the town; having lost twenty five of
their men in the enterprise.

The Council of the Massachusetts, gathering by these proceedings of the
Indians, that their desire of peace was only to gain time, Ordered that the
forces raised before Apr. 27. and for a time released should be hastened out
again to range the woods toward Hadly, and those parts; made an agreement with
Hartford Colony to send forces from thence to meet them about Brookfield, and
so to scour along on both sides Connecticut River, to disrest the enemy what
they could, and keep them from fishing in those waters, their hope of planting
being now almost over.

To this end about May 30. 1676. the Forces under Capt. Henchman were called
together again, and sent to Brookfiold to meet with those expected from
Hartford Colony: In the way, ours by the direction of Tom. Doublet (a Natick
Indian, who was a little before employed in the redemption of Captives)
following tracks of Indians, came upon a party of the enemy fishing in Weshacom
Ponds toward Lancaster, of whom they killed seven, and took 29. most women and
Children; yet belonging to consirerable Persons, it made the success the more
to be valued. Our Forces being by this means retarded, could not meet with
those of Connecticut at Brookfield; but followed them the week after; having
first returned from Weshacom to Malborough to supply themselves with
ammunition; and so marched directly toward Hadly, where they met with
Connecticut Forces; and from thence accoding to mutual agreement, ours marched
on the east side of the river, and Connecticut Forces on the West, up toward
Squakheag, coming to Deerfield, and the great Falls thereabouts, they sent up
their Scouts, but not hearing of the enemy, they marched up no higher, being in
no good capacity to have gone further if there had been occasion, by reason of
a tedious Storm of rain, which occasioned much damage in their Ammunition and
Provision. While our Forces lay about Deerfield, some of our soldiers ranging
lighted upon the Body of Capt. Turner, about Greens River, in passing of which
stream he was supposed to have received his mortal wounds.

While our Forces continued thereabouts, they did the enemy some little spoil
in seizing much of their Fish, and goods stolen from the English, and hid in
their barns, under ground; conjecturing also that they found 4. or 5. places
where some of the English had been tortured to death by cruel burning, after
they had been fastened between stakes set in the ground: but not meeting with
any of the enemy; they all hasted homewards, conceiving that having been forced
from their quarters in those parts, they were drawn down lower, toward the
English plantations, eastward viz. Plymouth and the Massachusetts. What success
C. Henchman's forces had in their retiring homeward, and what they observed of
the motion of the Indians, take in the words of his own Letter June, 30. -- Our
Scouts brought intelligence, that all the Indians were in a continual motion,
some toward Narrhaganset, others toward Watchuset, shifting gradually, and
taking up each others Quarters, and lay not above a night in a place. They 27.
ditto, brought in two Squaws, a boy and a girl, giving account of five slain.
Yesterday, they brought in an old fellow brother to a Sachem, six Squaws and
children, having killed five men, and wounded others if not killed them, as
they supposed by the blood found in the way, and an hat shot through. These and
the other inform that Philip and the Narrhagansets were gone several days
before to their own places, Philips purpose being to do what mischief he could
to the English. By advice I drew out a commanded Party under the conduct of
Capt. Sill, viz. sixteen Files of English, all my Troop, and the Indians,
excepting one File, being all we could make provision for, for what with the
falling short of the Bread promised us, and a great deal of that we had proving
moldy, the rest of the Forces had but one Biscuit a man to bring them to this
place: This party were ordered toward Watchuset, and so to Nashaway and the
Washakem Ponds, where we have notice Indians were, and so to return unto this
place. whereby your Honors Letter that came to me yesterday morning I
understood that provision was ordered for us; and which we found to our great
relief, which we found last night coming hither weary and hungry. The commanded
Party we left at Quonsiquomon, where they intended to stay awhile for the last
Scouts we sent out: Eleven Prisoners we had in all, two of the oldest by
counsel we put to death, the other nine the Commissary is ordered to convey to
Boston, with the Baggage, horses and some of their attendants not fit for the
Service.




Daniel Henchman.

It appears plainly by the contents of the said Letter, as well as by many
other testimonies, that about this time the Indians our Enemies, who hitherto
had been linked together as Brethren in iniquity, and cruelty, were now
strangly divided and separated the one from the other: some impute it to an
assault made upon them by the Mohawkes, who falling upon Philip with the Inland
Indians, slew about fifty of them, whereupon they of Philips Company resolved
to return to their own Country, and do what mischief they could to the English
thereabouts: This was reported by an Indian brought to Seaconk, June, 29. 1676.
taken at Providence. Others are ready to think, that it was upon some quarrel
amongst themselves, occasioned by an evil spirit sent from God upon them, that
thereby they might, being scattered, the more easily be taken and ruined by the
English, now that the time of vengeance was come, when they shall be called to
an account for all their former outrages and crueltyes; for now is the snare
hastening upon them, wherein they shall be hampered in their own devices, so to
be taken and destroyed: it cannot but be acknowledged as a very remarkable
Providence, that Capt. Henchman in his late expedition to Hadly, killed and
took about eighty four of the Enemy, without the loss of any one of his own
men: the like favorable success happened to Major Talcot, in his passage from
Norwich to Quabaog, as was said before, and soon after his return.

But by that time our Forces were returned home as far as Sudbury; they were
ordered upon the solicitation of the Governor of Plymouth, two Companies of
them at least, to march away immediately to Dedham, and so to Seaconk or
Rehoboth, to join with Major Bradford in the pursuit of Philip, who was it
seems with many hundreds of his Barbarous Followers fallen upon the English
Plantations thereabouts, and whither also a little before, Capt. Brattle with a
Troop of Horse, and Captain Mosely with a Foot Company were sent up from Boston
to pursue after them, now flocking in great numbers into those Woods; there was
at this time no small hope of surprising Philip: several reports being brought
that he was seen in this and that place, not with above twenty or thirty men
attending on him: but his time was not yet fully come, nor had he as yet fully
accomplished all that mischief, he was like to be suffered to do: For upon July
1 st. 1676. a party of his Indians committed an horrid and barbarous Murder
upon Mr. Hezekiah Willet in Swanzy, an hopeful young Gentleman, as any in those
parts; they used frequently to keep a Sentinel on the top of their House, from
a Watch-house built thereon, whence they could discover any Indians before they
came near the house, but not hearing of the Enemy in those parts for a
considerable time, that necessary piece of circumspection was omitted that day,
whereby that deserving person was betrayed into their cruel hands, for within a
quarter of an hour after he went out of his own doors, within sight of his
House, he was shot at by three of them at once, from every one of whom he
received a mortal wound; they after their barbarous manner took off his head;
and carried it away with them (which yet was soon after recovered) leaving the
Trunk of his body behind, as a sad monument of their inhumane cruelty: the same
Indians, not being above thirty in number, took away a Negro belonging to the
same Family, who being faithful to his Masters, and the Countries interest,
ventured his life to make his escape, which was the preservation of many
others; for the said Negro being a little acquainted with their Language,
discovered to the English after his escape, Philips purpose to seize such and
such places: in the first place to assault Taunton, which in all probability
had been in great danger, if their treacherous plots and purposes had not so
wonderfully been made known before hand. The said Negro affirmed, that there
was near a thousand of them, for he observed, that although they had killed
twenty head of Neat Cattle over night, yet there was not any part of them left
the (...)

Next day at eight of the Clock in the morning: by this special Providence the
Enemy was defeated of their purpose, and never after had any opportunity of
doing any considerable damage to the English in that part of the Country. So as
after this day we may truly date the time of our Deliverance, and beginning of
Revenges upon the Enemy: Now is their own turn come, when it shall be done
unto them, as they have served us: They that before led others into Captivity,
must themselves hence forth go into Captivity: And they that killed with the
Sword, must themselves be killed with the Sword, as in the Sequel of this
Narrative will abundantly be manifest; The History of which before we shall any
farther pursue, we must a little while wait upon our Friends, (those Forces
sent from Connecticut) in their return back into their own Colony, which before
it be done, some things should be premised concerning the occasion of their
coming, and the Success that did attend them in their march thither.

Our Friends and Brethren of that Colony, although they had never actually felt
half of those miseries, that befell the people of the other two, yet never
denied their Assistance to the suppressing of the common Enemy, yea, sometimes
they did afford it, before it was expressly desired; according to the Tenor of
the Articles of Confederation, and Rules of common prudence; considering that
if the fire of this War were not timely extinguished, it would endanger their
own Fabric: Therefore according to Agreement, the Council of that Colony
ordered their successful Commander Major Talcot to meet with our Forces at
Brookfield, or Quabaog in order to the pursuing of the Enemy in those parts: In
the way as they were from Norwich marching thither, Divine Providence so far
smiled upon the Enterprise, as to give them an opportunity to surprise fifty
one of the Enemy, of whom nineteen were slain, without the loss of any one of
their own Company, which could not but much enhanse the price of the victory to
the Conquerers.

The like Success had their friends which they left behind (the Volunteers
gathered out of the three Towns by the Sea side, New London, Stonington, and
Norwich;) and who were some of them released by Major Talcot, when he first
began his March, that they might the better in the absence of the Army, guard
their own Towns: for before the return of the Forces under Major Talcot, to
that side of the Country, they had made two Expeditions against their Enemies
the Narrhagansets, that were sculking up and down on that side of the Country;
In one of which they killed and took above thirty, the most of which being men,
are said to have been slain by them.

In the other about forty-five, the most of which probably were women and
Children, but being all young Serpents of the same brood, the subduing or
taking so many, ought to be acknowledged as another signal victory, and pledge
of Divine favor to the English. But to return, it was not without the special
direction of Providence that those Hartford Forces were sent to those Western
Towns a week before those of the Massachusetts could get thither; for otherwise
one or more of those Towns might have been lost; seeing that on the twelfth of
June, soon after, if not the next day, after they arrived there; The Enemy, as
if resolved to try the utmost of their power, violently assaulted the Town of
Hadly, with a body of about seven hundred men, at five or six in the morning,
laying an Ambush at one end of the Town, while the greater part of them were
alarming the other: But the Connecticut Forces being at that time quartered in
the Towns thereabouts, (who were English, and friendly Indians, Peq^ods, and
Mohegins, about five hundred in all) that were ready at hand, besides, those
that had been quartered there, ever since March, (who had been left by Major
Savage when he left those parts, under the Command and Charge of Captain
Turner, slain at the great Falls, as is noted before,) but since commanded by
Captain Swam. These by their joint and ready resistance, wherein the Fence of
Palizadoes surrounding the Town, was no little advantage, gave the Indians such
a smart Repulse, that they found the place too hot for them to abide it. For
the Soldiers or Townsmen within, firing a piece of Ordnance, it so affrighted
the Salvages, or a party of them, against whom it was discharged, that although
they had just before surprised, and possessed an house at the North end of the
Town, if Information mistake not, yet they instantly fled, leaving some of
their d^ad upon the place; Not did they any considerable mischief with all
their numbers, save firing a Barn about that end of the Town, and slaying two
or three of the Soldiers, or too daring Inhabitants, who would against express
order adventure to go without the Fortification.

It was accounted by some, that were present near the time of that Assault, a
great over sight, that having so fair an opportunity to chase the Enemy upon so
considerable advantage, it was let slip, and not improved: For Connecticut
Souldie^s being all, or most of them furnished with horses, they might have
been soon overtaken, and many of them destroyed: but God hid it from their
Eyes; The Commander in chief, it is said, quartered at one of the Towns on the
West side of the River, and did not apprehend the advantage, till the Season
was over: Nor was any such thing as an Assault expected from the Enemy, so
early in the morning; It being a general observation heretofore, that they
seldom, or never used to make any Attempt in the night time; part of which
could not but be improved in way of preparation for such a design.

But the Lord of Hosts who is wise in Counsel, and wonderful in working, would
find some other way to destroy our Enemies, wherein the hand of his Providence,
should more remarkeably be seen, that so no flesh should glory in its own
wisdom or strength, but that Salvation might appear, to be from the Lord alone.
The rest of this Month was spent without any other matter of moment happening
therein.

The Governor and Council of the Massachusetts, taking into serious
consideration, the many merciful O^currents that had been returned upus,
notwithstanding the mixing of many dispensations of a contrary nature,
accounted themselves bound to make some public acknowledgment thereof, to him
whose Name alone is worthy to be praised. The 29 th. of that month of June, was
set apart as a day of public Thanksgiving to God, who had remembered his people
thus in their low Estate. And that matter of Thanksgiving might not be wanting
at the day appointed, the very day before were most of our English Captives
brought back from the Indians, and many more soon after, to the number of
sixteen, whose mouths might then well be filled with Laughter, and their
Tongues with singing, both of themselves, and all that were any ways concerned
in their welfare.

And as this day appointed for solemn and public Thanksgiving, was ushered in
by several special mercies, so also was it followed with many remarkable
benefits.

For besides the preserving the Town of North-Hampton, March, the fourteenth,
and Hadly, June the twelfth, by the opportune sending of our Forces the very
night before they were Assaulted: The saving the people of Marlborough from
being cut off, was very observable, when Mr. Graves by his occasional going
from the Sermon, being forced thereunto by the extremity of the Tooth Ach,
March, 26. discovered the Indians ready to Assault the Town, and so else the
people might have been cut off, had not that Accident Intervened. It is
certain, that after the end of this Month, the power of the Enemy began every
where to fail; for the Body of the Enemy, that had lurked about Connecticut
River all this Spring, being visited with sundry diseases, disappointed of
their fishing, and put by their planting, began to fall at variance amongst
themselves; the Hadly and Pocumtuck Indians quarrelling with Philip for
fetching all this mischief about, and occasioning the English and them to fall
out, with whom they had always good Correspondence, and lived lovingly
together, but now they were like to be ruined by the War. This quarrel
proceeded to that height, that from that time forward, those several Indians
that had for so long time been combined together, resolved now to part, and
every one to shift for themselves, and return to their own homes: Philip to
Mount-hope, and the Narrhagansets to their own Country again: the Nipnets and
the River Indians, bending their course some Westward, others Northward
toward Pennicook upon Merrimack, intending to shift for themselves, as well as
they could for the future; all which is like to be the real and true state of
the Case with the Indians which were our Enemies: for the next News we heard of
Philip, was that he was gotten back to Mount-Hope, now like to become
Mount-Misery unto him, and his Vagabond Crew, and that his Friends and Allies,
that had hitherto stood as Neuters, waiting only which way the Scale of Success
and Victory would turn, began now to sue for mercy at the hands of the English:
The Massachusetts Government having understood something of this nature, put
forth a Declaration, that whatsoever Indians should within fourteen days next
ensuing come in to the English, might hope for mercy.

Amongst sundry that came in, there was one named James the Printer the
Superadded Title distinguishing him from others of that name: who being a
notorious Apostate, that had learned so much of the English, as not only to
read and write, but had attained likewise some skill in printing, and might
have attained more, (had he not like a false Villain ran away from his Master
before his time was out) he having seen and read the said Declaration of the
English, did venture himself upon that Faith thereof, and came to sue for his
Life; he affirmed, with others that came along with him, that more Indians had
dyed since this War began of discases (such as at other times they used not to
be acquainted withal) than by the Sword of the English.

Not long after many of them came and offered themselves, to the number of near
two hundred, Men, Women, and Children; and many more would have done the like,
but their Consciousness of guilt made them conclude, that their Cruelties and
barbarous Murders could never be forgiven by the English.

But what Occurrents happened next shall be declared in their order.

About the end of June News was brought to Boston, that Philip with a small
party of his men, lurked about Swanzy or Rehoboth, and that he might easily be
taken; an Indian offering to bring them to the place where they might find him;
whereupon Soldiers was instantly sent away, from Boston who spent some time in
searching all the woods on that side of the Country, but at last were forced to
return having missed of what they aimed at.

Plymouth Colony likewise sent out Soldiers upon the same account, under Major
Bradford, who by the help of some Indians of Cape Cod, always true to the
English interest, not only escaped an Ambush laid for them, whereby most of
them might have been cut off, but slew many of those that laid wait for them,
without any loss to themselves: yea further a Squaw Sachem of Sakonet, one of
Philips Allies, having first sent three Messengers to the Governor of
Plymouth, to sue for life and liberty; promising submission to their Government
on that condition, but understanding that Plymouth Forces were abroad, before
her Messengers returned, she with her People, about ninety in number, rendered
themselves up to Major Bradford, so that above one hundred and ten were killed,
and taken upon composition that day.

The like success had the Connecticut Forces sent into the Narrhaganset Country
under the conduct of the wonderfully successful Major Talco^, Capt. George
Denison, Capt. Newbery, with other worthy Commanders of the said Forces; for
about the second of July, 1676, As the said Commanders with the Forces under
them were pursuing the Enemy in, and about the Narrhaganset Country toward
Mount-hope, hearing that Philip with his black Regiment of Wempanoags was
thereabouts, their Indian Scouts from the top of an hill discovered a great
number of the enemy that had newly pitched their Station within the semicircle
of a Swampe. The English Soldiers were all mounted on horseback, to the number
of near three hundred; wherefore the Commanders ordered the Indians to be ready
at the top of the hill upon a signal given to run down amain upon the enemy
securely lodged in the hollow of the Swampe just opposite against them, while
their Horsemen being divided into two squadrons to ride round the hill, so that
at the same instant, both the Horsemen upon the two wings, and the Indians a
foot rushing down suddenly upon the enemy put them into an horrible fright,
making a lamentable outcry, some getting into the Swampe, the rest that were
prevented by the Horsemen, and the friendly Indians coming so suddenly upon
them were all taken prisoners; Capt. Newbery with his troop allighting from
their horses ran into the Swampe after them, where they killed at least an
hundred, as was judged by some then present; taking also many prisoners out of
those habitations of darkness; the enemy scarce daring to make any resistance;
for none of the English, and but one or two of the Mohegins and Pequods were
hurt in that assault: Yet it was affirmed by a Captain present on the place,
that with those they killed and took at Warwick neck, in their return home
(which were not much above sixty) that they killed and took of the enemy at
that time above three hundred young and old. At the same time was taken the old
Squaw of Narrhaganset, commonly called the old Queen.

They were necessitated with this booty to return homewards to gratify the
Mohegin and Pequod Indians that accompanied them, who had done them very good
service in the pursuit, having lost one or two of their men in the chase: But
their return home, was, as it proved in the issue, more beneficial, then their
longer stay might have been, to have made a fruitless pursuit after Philip
(whose time was not yet come although hastening apace) for in their return they
met sixty of the enemy, all of whom they slew and took, so as their Sword
returned not empty.

Within a few days after, two hundred of the enemy within Plymouth
Jurisdiction being distressed with Famine, and fear of danger, came and
submitted themselves to the Government there: But three of the company were
presently detected of a cruel murder, and villainous assault upon one Mr.
Clerks house of Plymouth; by a well minded Squaw that was among them (hoping
that possibly such a discovery would be pleasing to the English) and
accordingly adjudged forthwith to undergo condign punishment, which the rest
that surrendered themselves were no whit troubled at, such kind of Villains,
being always exempted from all acts of favor and mercy. Those two hundred
that had newly surrendered themselves, that they might give full proof of their
fidelity, offered to lead a Party of the English to a place not far off, where
twenty more of the enemy might be surprised, amongst whom also was one, known
to be a bloody murtheret of an English man that year before; accordingly eight
English men took fourteen of the said Indians, and the next day brought in all
the aforesaid twenty of the enemy, with the said murderer; who was presently
executed, the rest being accepted into favor.

It is affirmed likewise that five or six Sachems of Cape God, toward the
eastern part of it, came with three hundred Indians to make peace with the
English, on the 6 th. of July; one of the said Sachems earnestly desiring the
English that none of them might be suffered to sell any strong Liquors to the
Indians, the trading of which, possibly has had no small influence into the
present mischiefs.

The next day, July the 7 th. a small party of ours, with a few friendly or
Christian Indians with them, killed and took seven of the enemy in the woods
not far from Dedham, one of which was a Narrhaganset Sachem; who either
himself, informed, or by some other at that time, certain intelligence was
brought to Boston, that some of our enemy Indians were gotten to Albany,
informing people there, that they might the more easily get powder and
ammunition, that the English and they were now at peace: One of the said Indians
was the Sachem of Springfield, a bloody and deceitful villain; It is hoped
that he is now taken in the snare from whence he shall never be suffered to
escape.

Philip by this time could not but think his ruin hastened apace; yet that he
might, in imitation of him that stirred up all this mischief, express the more
wrath, because he knew his time was but short, intended if possible, to destroy
one town more of the English before his turn came; wherefore July, 11. with all
the Force he could get, or that he had left he intended to set upon Taunton,
having as was conceived, many hundreds in his company; but his design being
strangly discovered by a Negroe, whom they had taken captive a little before,
that having lived near the Indians before, understood much of their Language,
who making his escape from them, acquainted the Inhabitants with the plot; who
having timely notice, furnished themselves with Soldiers, whereby they were
able to repulse the enemy upon his first approach: so as he only fired two
houses, and then fled away: Except the Lord keeps the City the Watchman
watches but in vain.

The 22 d. of this month of July, as is hinted before, the Companyes sent from
Concord, May, 30. up toward Hadly, having spent much time and pains in
pursuit of Philip all the Country over (whom they could not yet overtake)
having tired themselves with many long and tedious Marches through the desert
woods, before they returned home some of them were sent toward Mount-Hope, yet
was their labor well improved, and followed with good success at the last: for
in ranging those woods in Plymouth Colony, they killed and took, by the help of
Capt. Mosely's Company and Capt. Brattles Troop joining with Major Bradfords
Company of Plymouth Colony, an hundred and fifty Indians, with the loss of
never an English man.

It was feared that Philip and his Company would have returned into the Nipnet
Country, to prevent which, several Horsemen were sent to guard the passage; but
he lurked about his own Country in swamps and other secret places, where he was
as yet hid from the sight of the English, although many times they happened to
lodge very near him, insomuch as an Indian Captive promised in two hours time
to bring our Soldiers to the very place where he was; but they not being able
to pass the nearest way, came a little too late; for they being so hotly
pursued, hasted away, leaving much of their treasure behind them; their Kettles
boiling over the fire, their dead unburyed, and twenty of their party were
overtaken, that fell into the English hands: Philip himself, and some few of
his straggling followers, making their escape by a Raft over an arm of the Sea,
into another neck of land on Pocasset side, not daring to trust himself any
longer in Metapoyset woods, so full of our English Soldiers, as well those of
Plymouth, as of the Massachusetts Colony, who almost every day meeting with some
of his party, much lessened his number. Capt. Church, that active and unwearied
Commander of Plymouth Colony, was at this time as well as long before, out upon
the chase with but eighteen English, and twenty two Indians that were friends,
had four several engagements with Philips party, wherein he spoiled seventy six
of the enemy, without the loss of one of his own men. In several of these
skirmishes, those Indians that upon submission had their lives given them, have
done notable service in hunting out the enemy in all their lurking places.

At another time they took Philips Squaw, and one of his chief Counselors; and
about that same time, another Sachem about Pocasset, with forty Indians
submitted himself to the Government of Plymouth, on promise of life and liberty.

It seemed that now the time of our deliverance was come, and the time also for
the destruction of our enemies: for the last week in July, the Massachusetts
understanding that some Indians were seen roving up and down the woods about
Dedham, almost starved for want of victuals, sent a small Company of twenty six
Soldiers, with about nine or ten Christian Indians, who pursued and took fifty
of the enemy, without any loss to the English; at which time also, a good
quantity of Wampampeag and powder was taken from the enemy. That which
increased this victory was the slaughter of Pomham, who was one of the stoutest
and most valiant Sachems that belonged to the Narhagansets; whose courage and
strength was so great, that after he had been mortally wounded in the fight, so
as himself could not stand; yet catching hold of an Englishman that by
accident came near him, had done him a mischief, if he had not been presently
rescued by one of his Fellows. Amongst the rest of the Captives at that time,
was one of the said Pomhams sons, a very likely youth, and one whose
countenance would have bespoke favor for him, had he not belonged to so bloody
and barbarous an Indian as his father was.

These successes being daily bruited abroad among the Indians, put many of them
into a trembling condition, not knowing well how to dispose of themselves: some
that had been less active in these Tragedies, and were rather led by others,
then any wise inclined to mischief themselves, adventured to submit themselves,
of which number was one of Nipnet Sachems, called Sagamore John, who July 27.
came to surrender himself to the Governor and Council of the Massachusetts at
Boston, bringing along with him one hundred and eighty of the Enemy Indians.
This John that he might the more ingratiate himself with the English, whose
friendship he was now willing to seek after, did by a wile get into his hands,
one Matoonas, an old malicious Villain, who was the first that did any mischief
within the Massachusetts Colony, July. 14. 1675. baring an old grudge against
them as is thought, for justice that was done upon one of his Sons, 1671. whose
Head ever since stands upon a Pole near the Gibbet where he was hanged up: the
bringing in of this malicious Caitife, was an hopeful presage, that it would
not be long before Philip himself, the grand Villain, would in like manner
receive a just reward of his Wickedness and Murders.

Sagamore John, that came in July 27. affirmed, that he had never intended any
mischief to the English at Brookefield the last year (near which Village it
seems his place was) but that Philip coming overnight amongst them, he was
forced, for fear of his own life, to join with them against the English.
Matoonas also when he was brought before the Council, and asked what he had to
say for himself, confessed that he had rightly deserved Death, and could expect
no other, adding withal, that if he had followed their Counsel, he had not come
to this; for he had often seemed to favor the Praying Indians, and the
Christian Religion, but like Simon Magus, by his after practice, discovered
quickly, that he had no part nor portion in that matter.

About this time several parties of English, within Plymouth Jurisdiction, were
willing to have a hand in so good a matter, as catching of Philip would be, who
perceiving that he was now going down the wind, were willing to hasten his
fall. Amongst others a small party, July 31. went out of Bridge-water upon
discovery, and by providence were directed to fall upon a Company of Indians
where Philip was, they came up with them, and killed some of his special
Friends, Philip himself was next to his Uncle, that was shot down, and had the
Soldier that had his choice which to shoot at, known which had been the right
Bird, he might as well have taken him as his Uncle; but it is said that he had
newly cut off his Hair, that he might not be known: the party that did this
exploit were few in number, and therefore not being able to keep altogether
close in the rear, that cunning Fox escaped away through the Bushes undiscerned
in the rear of the English: that which was most remarkable in this design, was
that trembling fear discerned to be upon the Indians at this time, insomuch
that one of them having a Gun in his hand well laden, yet was not able to shoot
it off, but suffered an English Soldier to come close up to his breast, and so
shot him down, the other not being able to make any resistance: nor was any of
the English hurt at, this time.

The like terror was seen in others at that time, for within two days after,
Capt. Church, the terror of the Indians in Plymouth Colony, marching in pursuit
of Philip, with but thirty Englishmen, and twenty reconciled Indians, took
twenty three of the Enemy, and the next day following them by their Tracks,
fell upon their Headquarters, and killed and took about an hundred and thirty
of chem, but with the loss of one English man: in this engagement God did
appear in a more then ordinary manner to fight for the English, for the Indians
by their number, and other advantages of the place, were so conveniently
provided, that they might have made the first shot at the English, and done
them much damage; but one of their own Countrymen in Capt. Churches Company,
espying them, called aloud unto them in their own Language, telling them, that
if they shot a Gun, they were all dead men; with which they were so amazed,
that they durst not once offer to fire at the English, which made the victory
the more remarkable: Philip made a very narrow escape at that time, being
forced to leave his Treasures, his beloved Wife and only Son, to the mercy of
the English, Skin for Skin, all that a man has will he give for his life: His
ruin being thus gradually carried on, his misery was not prevented but
augmented thereby; being himself made acquainted with the sense and
experimental feeling of the Captivity of his Children, loss of Friends,
slaughter of his Subjects, bereavement of all Family Relations, and being
stripped of all outward Comforts, before his own life should be taken away. Such
Sentence sometime passed upon Cain, made him cry out, that his punishment was
greater then he could bare.

This bloody wretch has one week or two more to live, an object of pity, bu^
a spectacle of divine vengeance, his own Followers beginning now to plot
against his life, to make the better terms for their own; as they did also
seek to betray Squaw Sachem of Pocasset, Philips near Kins-woman and
Confederate. For,

August 6. An Indian willing to shift for himself fled to Taunton, offering to
lead any of the English that would follow him, to a party of Indians, which
they might easily apprehend, which twenty attempted, and accordingly seized the
whole Company, to the number of twenty six all but that Squaw Sachem her self,
who intending to make an escape from the danger, attempted to get over a River,
or arm of the Sea near by, upon a Raft or some pieces of broken wood; but
whether tired and spent with swimming, or starved with cold and hunger, she was
found stark naked in Metapoiset, not far from the waterside, which made some
think, that she was first half drowned, and so ended her wretched life, just in
that place where the year before she had helped Philip to make his escape: her
head being cut off and set upon a Pole in Taunton, was known by some Indians
then Prisoners, which set them into an horrid Lamentation; but such was the
righteous hand of God, in bringing at the last that mischief upon themselves,
which they had without cause thus long acted against others.

Philip, like a Salvage and wild Beast, having been hunted by the English
Forces through the Woods, above an hundred miles backward and forward, at last
was driven to his own Den, upon Mount-hope, where retiring himself, with a few
of his best Friends into a Swamp, which proved but a Prison to keep him fast,
till the Messengers of death, came by Divine permission to execute vengeance
upon him, which was thus accomplished.

Such had been his inveterate malice and wickedness against the english that
despairing of mercy from them, he could not bear that any thing should be
suggested to him about a Peace, insomuch as he caused one of his Confederates
to be killed, for propounding an expedient of peace; which so provoked some of
his Company, not altogether so desperate as himself, that one of them (being
near of kin to him that was killed) fled to Road-Island, whither, that active
Champion Capt. Church was newly retired, to recruit his men for a little time,
being much tired with hard marches all that week) informing them that Philip
was fled to a Swamp in Mount-hope, whether he would undertake to lead them that
would pursue him. This was welcome news, and the best Cordial, for such Martial
Spirits: whereupon he immediately, with a small Company of men, part English
and part Indians, began another March, which shall prove fatal to Philip, and
end that controversy betwixt the english and him: for coming very early to the
side of the Swamp, his Soldiers began presently to surround it, and whether
the Devil appeared to him in a Dream that night, as he did unto Saul,
foreboding his Tragical end (it matters not) as he intended to make his escape
out of the Swamp, he was shot through the Heart by an Indian of his own Nation
as is said, that had all this while kept himself in a neutrality until this
time, but now had the casting vote in his power, by which he determined the
quarrel that had held so long in suspense; in him is fulfilled what was said in
the Prophet, Woe to thee that spoilest, and thou wast not spoiled, and dealest
treacherously and they dealt not treacherously with thee; when thou shall cease
to spoil thou shall be spoiled, and when thou shall make an end to deal
treacherously, they shall deal treacherously with thee, Isai. 33.1.

With Philip at this time fell five of his trustiest Followers, of whom one was
said to be the Son of his chief Captain, that had shot the first Gun at the
English the year before. This was done August 12. 1676. a remarkable testimony
of divine favor to the Colony of Plymouth, who had for their former successes,
appointed the 17 th day of August following, to be kept as a day of solemn
Thanksgiving to Almighty God. There having been so strange a turn of providence
observed in the late successes obtained in and about Plymouth Colony, it may
not be amiss here to enquire into the occasions that did lead thereunto, and
also into the progress and continuance thereof, after the slaughter of Philip
that grand Rebel.

In the precedent Narration frequent mention has been made of one Capt.
Church, whom God has made an instrument of signal Victories over the Indians
in that Colony, and of great advantage in that respect to that whole
Jurisdiction. It hapened that the said Capt. Church some time in June last,
viz. of this present year, 1676. passing over in a Canoo from Pocasset to
Road-Island, as he used frequently to do (having had much employment upon the
said Neck of Land, so called) several Indians whom he had known before at
Lakenham (a Village on Pocasset side) beckned to him, as if they had a mind to
speak with him; he having had so much experience as well as others of their
Treachery, was not willing to adventure presently to come near them; but when
they seemed to urge very much, and made many signs to him, and at last laid
down their Guns in his sight, he began to think with himself, there might be
something in the matter more then ordinary, therefore resolved to go a little
nearer to the shore, and then he perceived they had a great mind to speak with
him, using much importunity for that end, insomuch as he ventured to go a shore
amongst them, having but one Englishman, and two Indians with him, he directed
them to keep off the Canoo, while he discoursed with the Indians ashore: as
soon as ever he came amongst them; they told him they were weary of fighting,
and that they had fought so long by Philips instigation, but they could not
tell for what end, and therefore were resolved they would fight no longer; and
that which they desired of him only was, that he would make way for them to the
Governor, that they might live quietly amongst the English, as they had done
before, and that they would deliver up their Arms, or would go out with them,
if he pleased to accept of them, and fight for him: to that end they desired a
time to parley with him, further about that business, at what time and place he
would appoint: He told them he would meet them two days after at Saconet, a
place up higher upon the said neck, about twelve a clock; accordingly he came
to the said place, and found the same Indians, with some others, and their
Sunk Squaw, or chief woman of that Indian Plantation, there ready to meet him.

After they had fallen into discourse about the beginning of the war, as well
as the success and mischief of it, they would have put the blame off from
themselves, and laid it upon the English: But he presently convinced them by an
undeniable evidence, that they first began the war; For said he upon this
Pocasset, July, 7. 1675. you first fought with some of Road-Island, whereof one
was my own Servant, whose leg you brake, and the same day you shot at my self
and Company, before ever we meddled with you: They were so fully convinced
herewith, that they found nothing to reply, but fell into other discourse about
a peace, which they seemed very desirous to obtain upon any equal terms, as
was said before.

There were about fifteen of the Indians present, beside their Sunk Squaw
(which is with us their Governess or Lady) in conclusion they engaged for ever
after to leave Philip, and to go out with him; which they did forthwith, as
soon as he had obtained a peace for them with the Governor.

It is here to be minded, that these were not properly Philips Indians, but
belonged to the Sakonet Squaw, who was nearly related to Philip, and her
Subjects had hitherto fought in Philips Quarrel, till they saw nothing but
misery and mischief like to be the issue of it to themselves, as well as their
neighbors. About twenty or thirty of these Sakonet Indians have constantly
gone out with Capt. Church ever since, and not only been faithful and
serviceable to him, but very successful in every enterprise they have gone
about, nor has he lost any of them in any skirmish with the other Indians: And
it is said that this act of these Indians broke Philips heart, as soon as ever
he understood it, so as he never joyed after, or had any success in any of his
designs, but lost his men one time after another, till himself at last fell
into the hands of these Indians under Capt. Churches Command: For at the swamp
when Philip was slain, Capt. Church appointed an English man and an Indian to
stand at such a place of the swampe, where it happened that Philip was breaking
away; the morning being wet and rainy, the English man's gun would not fire, the
Indian having an old Musket with a large touchhole, it took fire the more
readily, with which Philip was dispatched, the bullet passing directly through
his heart, where Joab thrust his darts into rebellious Absalom.

Thus did divine vengeance retalliate upon this notorious Traitor, that had
against his league and Covenant, risen up against the Government of Plymouth,
to raise up against him one of his own people, or one that was in league with
him, as he was with the English: The Indian that did this execution was called
Alderman of Sakonet that had never done any act of hostility against the
English.

By these passages it is manifest, that as the hearts of all are in the hand of
God, so he turns them as he pleases, either to favor his people, or to hate
and deal subtly with his Servants, as seems good to him.

Since this engagement with the Sakonet Indians, to leave Philip, and to go
out with Capt. Church, it is credibly affirmed; that such has been their
success, that since June aforesaid, to the end of October next following, there
have been seven hundred Indians subdued, either by killing or taking Captive,
by the means of Capt. Church and his Company, part Indians and part English,
besides three hundred that have come in voluntarily to submit themselves to the
Government of Plymouth.

It appears thus by the sequel of things, that after the Lord has
accomplished his work upon his people, that he is beginning to call his enemies
to an account, and punish them for the pride of their hearts, and for all their
treachery and cruelty against his Servants.

Philips Captains have run the same fa^ with himself, some before and some
after his own Fall.

In June last one Tiashq a great Captain of his, his wife and child, or
children being taken, though he escaped himself at first, yet came since and
surrendered himself.

The next noted Captain of Philips Indians that was brought in after Philips
death, was one called Tespiquin, a notorious Villain, next to Philip, he was
called the black Sachemsson: It was this Tespiquin that burnt so many houses in
Plymouth lately. Capt. Church with his Company were in pursuit of him in
September last, two days before they could get near him, at the last on the
third day, they found the track made by the said Tespiquins party, as they went
to fetch apples from the English Orchards: This was something a blind track,
therefore they were forced to take up their quarters that night without
discovering any place of their Rendezvouze. The next morning about nine of the
clock, they came to their first Rendezvouze, from which they were newly gone:
at one a clock they came to the second, and missing them there, they soon after
(...) the third track, wherein after they had marched awhile, they perceived
they grew very near them, by the crying of a child which they heard: the place
was near Lakenham upon Pocasset neck, so full of bushes that a man could not
see a rod before him: Capt. Church ordered his men to march up together in one
rank, because he discovered the Indians were laid in one Range by several
fires; so that by that time they all came up into an even rank pretty near
together, within a few yards of them, as he had appointed, they all suddenly
rushed altogether in upon them, and catched hold of them, not suffering any to
escape; there being about fifty of them in all: Tespequins wife and children
were there, but himself was absent; as also one Jacob, and a girl that
belonged to that company. The Captains leisure would not serve him to wait till
they came in, (though the Indians said they might come that night) wherefore he
thought upon this project; to leave two old Squawes upon the place, with
victuals, and bid them tell Tespiquin, that he should be his Captain over his
Indians if he were found so stout a man, as they reported him to be; for the
Indians had said that Tespiquin could not be pierced by a bullet, for said
they, he was shot twice, but the bullets glanced by him and could not hurt him.
Thus the Captain marched away with his booty, leaving this Trap behind him to
take the rest; the next morning he came to see what his Trap had caught, there
he found Jacob aforesaid (a notorious wretch) and the girl he missed before,
but not Tespiquin: But within a day or two after, the said Tespiquin, upon the
hopes of being made a Captain under Capt. Church, came after some of the
Company, and submitted himself in the Captains absence; and was sent to
Plymouth, but upon trial (which was the condition on which his being promised a
Captains place under Capt. Church did depend) he was found penetrable by the
English gunns, for he fell down at the first shot, and thereby received the
just reward of his former wickedness.

About a Fort night after the surprising of Tespiquin, was one Totosons company
taken, wherein were above fifty persons: but Totoson himself escaped, and is
out still in Rebellion, unless vengeance has overtaken him since.

The next that was seized after the former, was one called Annawan; a very
subtle, politic Fellow, and one of Philips chief Counselors; he had about
twelve men, and as many Women and Children in his Company, who were discovered
by their shooting at the English Horses, and other Cattle; some of whom being
taken, they made known the rest. Capt. Church at that time had but five English
men, and twenty Indians. The place where this Annawan had betaken himself, was
a ledge of Rocks inaccessible, but at one place, which by a few hands, might
easily have been defended against a great number of Assailants: but Capt.
Church by direction got up to their Wigwams before they were aware: and
pleasantly told Annawan, that he came to sup with him that night; whereat the
said Annawan (who had fallen flat upon the Earth, expecting to have his head
cut off) looked up and cried Taubut, in their Language; thank you, as one being
much affected with the generosity of our English Captain; they found some of
the English Beef boiling in their Kettles: After Supper much discourse had with
the said Annawan, they lay down to sleep together in the Wigwam: Capt. Church
laying one of his legs upon Anawans Son, and the other upon himself, that he
might have notice, if any of them offered to stir: after midnight Annawan rose
up, and Capt. Church was presently awake, and intended to watch after his
Prisoner: he thought at the first he might have gone forth upon some necessary
occasion; but not long after, he returned again, having fetched out of a Swamp
hard by, two Horns of Powder and a large Belt of Peag, supposed to be Philips
Belt, all which he delivered to Capt. Church, in way of thankful
acknowledgement of his courtesy. Amongst other Discourse that passed between
them, concerning the occasion of the War, and carrying of it on: the Indian
would fain have excused Philip, and laid the blame upon the Praying Indians (as
they are distinguished from others by that Character) and others of the younger
sort of his Followers, who coming with their several tales (which he likened to
sticks laid on a heap) till by the multitude of them a great fire came to be
kindled: they make much use of parabolical expressions; for so said Solomon,
Where no wood is, there the fire goes out; so where there is no talebearer,
the strife cease, Prove. 26.20. But Philip had had large and long experience
of the gentleness and kindness of the English, both to himself and to his
People, so as unless he had born an evil and malicious mind against the
English, he would never have hearkened to those stories, contrary to his
faithful promise and Allegiance.

The said Annawan confessed also, that he did believe by all those late
occurrents, that there was a great God, that overruled all; and that he had
found, that whatever he had done to any of those, whether Indians or English,
the same was brought upon himself in after time. He confessed also, that he had
put to death several of the English, that they had taken alive, ten in one day:
and could not deny, but that some of them had been tortured: and now he could
not but see the justice of the great God upon himself, with many other things
of like nature. But whatever his confessions of this nature were, being forced
from him by the power of Conscience, after he was delivered up to Authority, he
was put to death, as he justly had deserved.

It is said that Philip when he first began his Rebellion, had about three
hundred fighting men under him, besides those that belonged to his Kins-woman,
Wetamoe, drowned about Taunton, that had almost as many under her, as himself.
And one Quenopin, a Narrhaganset Sachem, that lived near him, and joined with
him in his quarrel with the English: But it is certain that there are scarce
any that are now left that belonged to either of them: so as although the
Almighty has made use of them to be a scourge to his People, he has now
turned his hand against them, to their utter destruction, and extirpation from
off the face of the earth, peradventure to make room for others of his People
to come in their room, and in their stead.

As for the rest of the Narrhagansets, that joined in Philips quarrel, it is
already declared, what end they were come unto. As for the rest of the Indians,
whither Nipnet, Nashaway, Pacomptuck, or Hadly and Springfield Indians; it is
not so certain what is become of them: But after their separation one from the
other about July last; it was observed by all the Tracks in those Woods, they
went still westward, and about the middle of August last, a great party of them
were observed to pass by Westfield, a small Town to the west of Springfield,
and were judged to be about two hundred: News thereof being brought to Major
Talcot, he with the Soldiers of Connecticut Colony under his command, both
English and Indians, pursued after them as far as Ausotunnoog River (in the
middle way betwixt West field, and the Dutch River, and Fort Albany) where he
overtook them, and fought with them; killing and taking Prisoners forty five,
whereof twenty five were fighting men, without the loss of any one of his
Company besides a Mohegin Indian: many of the rest were sorely wounded, as
appeared by the dabbling of the Bushes with blood, as was observed by them that
followed them a little further.

It is written since from Albany, that there were sundry lost besides the forty
five forementioned, to the number of threescore in all; and also that an
hundred and twenty of them are since dead of sickness: so as Vengeance seems to
be pursuing of them as well as the rest.

Several of their Friends that belonged to Nashaway, and the places adjoining,
repaired to Pascataqua, hoping to shroud themselves under the Wings of some
honester Indians about Quechecho, under pretense of a Declaration set out by
the Governor and Council of the Massachusetts in the beginning of July last:
but some of our Forces, under Capt. Hathorne and Capt. Sill, with the help of
Major Walden, Captain Frost, and others residing in those parts, being then in
a readiness, separated the vile, and wicked from the rest, and sent them down
to the Governor at Boston, where eight or nine of the Ringleaders, such as
one eyed John, Sagamore Sam of Nashaway, chief Actors of the late outrages, and
bloody mischiefs had justice done upon them soon after.

As for the Massacres and Calamities that befell the English further Eastward,
they shall in the second part of this Narrative be declared.

The Indians being thus dispersed several ways, were strangly confounded, and
destroyed one parcel after another, until there was none left in the western
or southern parts, that durst make any opposition all the following part of the
year.

As for those that fled westward toward Albany, we shall there leave them for
the present, wishing we may never hear more of them: Only a person of Quality
informs, that at Hartford, in September last, he was present at the
examination of one Choos, an Indian, formerly of Connecticut, but one of the
Narrhaganset Fort the last winter, who confessed that he was one of that
Company of Indians that went westward the month before toward Hudsons River;
but after the fight at Ausotunnoog, he said he returned back to Connecticut for
fear of the Mohawks; and that he lay hid about Farmington, till he was almost
starved; and then he went to the Seaside, to make use of the Oister bank at
Stratford for his relief, where he was espied by the Indians, and so brought to
Hartford.

He affirmed, that there were above two hundred and fifty fighting men amongst
those Indians that fled westward, besides women and children; and that near two
hundred of them passed the great River below Albany, and were sheltered by the
Indians of that place, called Moheganders; but about eighty of them tarried on
the hither side of that River near a Dutch village. But he being convicted of
fighting against the English, was condemned to dye, and executed about the same
time.

Some few of the rest were skulking about the Narrhaganset Country the last
Fall, hoping to shelter themselves under Vncas, but he not willing to give them
countenance against the mind of his friends at Connecticut, has since
abandoned them to shift for themselves, who have been most of them taken and
brought in prisoners to the English this winter.

About the Month of October last, Mr. Stanton chanced to come from Seaconke
with three Indians in his company Pequods, or Mohegins, they hearing by a
Captive at one of the next towns that there was a parcel of the enemy not far
off, presently left Mr. Stanton, and pursued after them, whom they soon after
overtook, and made them all prisoners: amongst them was an old man, not able to
go their pace, but promising to come after them, they spared his life: but as
soon as the men returned at night from hunting, the old man told them what had
befalne their women and children; whereupon the next morning they presently
following after them, overtook them, and so recovered the prisoners, and slew
one of the three that carried them away; the other two hardly escaped; one of
them is called Major Simon, being part a Pequod and part a Narrhaganset, but of
extraordinary strength and courage; he perceiving the danger they were in,
challenged to fight hand to hand with any five of them with their hatchets; but
they unwilling to hang their success upon the hazard of a single Combat, came
all toward him at once, whereupon first discharging his gun amongst the whole
Company, he brake through them all by force, and so escaped their hands, with
one more that was one of his companions. This Simon has since been very active
in killing and taking many of the enemy; some say that he with his own hands
has taken and killed above threescore; and either out of hatred to the enemy,
or love to the English, is this last week gone with the Soldiers to the
eastward, in pursuit of our quarrel against them in those parts.

At another time not long before, when he was out against the enemy; he came
suddenly upon a great number of them, as they were spread under a steep bank,
from whence leaping down into the midest of them he killed diverse, and took
others: Fighting it seems is a recreation to him, for he is seldom at home
above four or five days together.

Some say that in one of his former expeditions, being much wearied and spent,
he laid him down to sleep; but toward morning he fell into a dream, wherein be
apprehended the Indians were upon him, where suddenly rising up he espied the
Indians coming toward him; but presently presenting his gunns against them, he
so frighted them, that they gave him an opportunity to make an escape from a
multitude of them.

Since the beginning of December last, News coming down to Boston, that
mischief was done about Seaconk, and Rehoboth, by some remainder of the Indians
thereabout, killing their swine and horses; several of Medfield went out after
them, and pursuing them by their track, came upon a small party, of whom they
took three, one of which escaped, while some of the company were going after
the rest: They which were taken confessed there were a parcel about
threescore, that were lurking up and down in those Woods, the said two Indians
were brought into Boston, Jan. 8.

A Commission was formerly granted to Peter Ephraim an Indian of Natick, to go
out in pursuit of them, with twenty nine of his Company: a few of the English
went with them from Medfield, who being tired with marching in the Snow soon
returned. The Indians kept on in their design, and lighted upon a considerable
party of the Enemy, having traced them, till they found where they lodged over
night; they surrounded them early in the morning, as their manner is, and then
offered them quarter, if they would yield: eight resolute fellows refused, who
were presently shot down, the rest were all seized, the whole being in number
forty two. This was done about the middle of January last, since which time,
several such exploits have been done by them.

Jan. 23. last, The same Company of Natick Indians took two and twenty of the
Enemy, among which were five able men, and five Arms: they sent the Prisoners
home by five of their Company, the rest went further in the chase.

Jan. 26. last, Another parcel of the Enemy were brought in, eight in number,
of whom five were men; amongst whom was the Indian called Cornelius: who three
years since was indicted for killing an Englishmans Cow; upon which he is said
to have uttered several threatening speeches, that he would kill English men,
and their Cows too; which was now remembered against him, when he was in
particular called to account, for having an hand in killing some of the English
and Indians also in league with us, for which he was sentenced to die, and was
accordingly executed on Febr. 15. last.

Concerning the rest of the Indians, either in the Colony of Plymouth,
Connecticut, or the Massachusetts; there is no occurrent more of moment come to
light, since the end of August last, save what is last mentioned before; yet is
it very remarkable that although terms of peace were offered to all that would
come in and surrender themselves (as appears by a Declaration put out July
last) and that a Nipnet Sachem called John, did thereupon with a considerable
number of his Company come in, and offer themselves, and were accordingly
secured of their lives, and other concernments; yet did that treacherous Varlet
make an escape away, this winter from Capt. Prentices House (under whose charge
he was put, about Cambridge Village) and with above twenty more fled away into
the Woods, to shift for himself, amongst the rest of his bloody Companions;
they were presently pursued, but had gone too fast and too far to be overtaken:
whither it were consciousness of their own guilt, that having had an hand in
the blood of the English, they feared vengeance hung over their heads: or
whither they liked not the English manners so well, as to be confined
thereunto: wild creatures ordinarily love the liberty of the woods, better than
the restraint of a cage. They made none acquainted with their design before
they went away; and as yet little account can be given of them: only it is
known that one or two of their number have since been killed; and that one or
two of their Families are entertained by Vncas; but what is become of the rest
is yet uncertain: There were but seven of the Company men; so as they are not
capable to do much mischief. Some of late have travailed through the woods to
Connecticut, but met with no Indians, nor did they hear of any in their passing
between that place and this.

And because in the present Narrative, there has been frequent mention made of
Vncas the Mohegin Sachem, and of his faithfulness to the interest of the
English, I add in this place, that it is suspected by them that knew him best,
that in his heart he is no better affected to the English; or their Religion,
then the rest of his Countrymen; and that it has been his own advantage, that
has led him to be thus true to them who have upheld him, as formerly against
the Pequods, so of late against the Narrhagansets: yet has he not long since
been convinced of the truth of our Religion, and vanity of his own, as himself
has solemnly confessed; which will evidently appear by this following passage,
which I shall here represent just as it was, from under the hand of that
Reverend person it relates unto, viz. Mr. Fitch, Pastor of the Church at
Norwich, near unto which Vncas his place is.

There was a great drought the last Summer, but as it seems, it was more
extreme in those parts then with us about the Massachusetts; and although
probably, the English might have prayed for rain themselves without any motion
from the Indians, yet their address to the said Mr. Fitch on such an account,
with the consequences thereof, is very remarkable, which take in his own words,

Concerning the Drought etc. the true Narrative of that Providence is this,

In August last, such was the want of rain, that the Indian corn was not only
dried and parched up, but the apple trees withered, the fruit and leaves fell
off as in Autumn, and some trees seemed to be dead with that Drought: the
Indians came into town and did lament their want of rain, and that their
Powawes could get none in their way of worship desiring me that I would seek to
God for rain: I appointed a Fast day for that purpose. The day being come, it
proved a clear day without any clouds, until nigh sun setting, when we came
from the Meeting, and then some Clouds arose; the next day remained cloudy,
then Vncas with many Indians came to my house, Vncas lamented there was such
want of Rain; I asked whether if God should send us rain, he would not
attribute it to their Powawes: He answered no, for they had done their
uttermost and all in vain: I replied, if you will declare it before all these
Indians, you shall see what God will do for us; For although this year he has
shown his anger against the English, and not only against the Indians, yet he
has begun to save us, and I have found by experience twice in the like case,
when we sought him by Fasting and Prayer, he has given us Rain, and never
denied us. Then Vncas made a great speech to the Indians (which were many)
confessing that if God should then send rain it could not be ascribed to their
powawing, but must be acknowledged to be an answer of our prayers. This day the
clouds spread more and more, and the next day there was such plenty of rain,
that our River rose more then two foot in height.

By all that is recorded in the Narrative foregoing, there are none into whose
hands it shall come, but will be sensible that the present time has been a day
of great rebuke and trouble to the poor people sojourning in this wilderness,
upon whom sundry calamities have broke in at once this last as well as in the
former years: in many places they have been visited with sickness, and
mortality more then in many years before, depriving them of many worthy and
useful persons; amongst others the loss of Mr. John Winthrope the late worthy
Governor of the Colony of Connecticut, is as it ought, much lamented by all,
who dyed at Boston, April 5. 1676. in the 73. year of his age, whither he was
occasionally called the last winter to sit with the rest of the Commissioners,
of the united Colonyes, to consult about the great affairs of them, now newly
engaged in these troubles from the Heathen. He was the eldest son of the famous
Governor of the Massachusetts, deceased, March, 26, 1649. Proles similima
Paronti. The memory of the Father, though he dyed so long ago yet lives still
in the minds of the surviving Generation, and is like to continue much longer,
by the remembrance of the eminent virtues found in this the eldest of his
offspring, who being not long after, or about that time called to take up his
residence in that Colony, was by the importunity of the people there, prevailed
with to accept of the Governors place, which for a long time after, he held
over that Colony though annually chosen thereunto; being so well furnished with
many excellent endowments, as well moral as political and philosophical, which
rendered him most fit to be an healer of that people. Though we are dealing in
another subject, yet shall not pass by his Tomb, as we go along, without
paying the homage due to the memory of so honorable a Gentleman.

After all the forementioned Calamityes and troubles, it pleased God to alarm
the town of Boston, and in them the whole Country, by a sad Fire, accidentally
kindled by the carelessness of an Apprentice, that sat up too late overnight,
as was conceived; which began an hour before day, continuing three or four, in
which time it burned down to the ground forty six dwelling houses, besides
other Buildings, together with a Meeting house of considerable bigness: some
mercy was observed mixed with the judgment, for if a great rain had not
continued all the time (the roofs and walls of their ordinary buildings
consisting of such combustable matter) that whole end of the town had at that
time been consumed.

Whereby we see that God by his providence can turn our dwellings into ash^s,
without the help of either foreign or domestic enemies. Which consideration
may awaken all from security, and confidence in these uncertain and unstable
possessions, that have no firmer Foundation, that may so soon after their first
erection, be eaten up by the flames of fire, before the iron teeth of time have
had leisure to devour and feed upon them.

God grant that by the Fire of all these Judgments, we may be purged from our
Dross, and become a more refined people, as Vessels fitted for our Masters use.
A SUPPLEMENT Concerning the WAR with the PEQUODS.
Reader,
I Could willingly have now expected that my Indenture being cancelled, I might
have had a discharge from any further labor of this nature; but least I be
found to have falsified my word passed in the Title of the Narrative, according
to the Civilians Rule, Nihil dicitur factum quamdiu aliquid super est ad
agendum; as also that other, Non absolutus est debtor qui multa reddit, sed
qui omnia; being some intimation has already been made of great trouble with
the Pequod Indians, at the first settling of the Plantations upon Connecticut
River, that I may make even, though not over measure, I shall in the last place
give this following account thereof, either left under the hands of such as
commanded in chief in that action, or from the mouths of some faithful
Witnesses, that were not only then present, but personally concerned and
engaged in that Service.

THere was a Nation of the Indians in the Southern parts of New England, called
Pequods, seated on a fair Navigable River, twelve miles to the Eastward of the
mouth of the great and famous River of Connecticot; who (as was commonly
reported about the time when New England was first planted by the English)
being a more fierce, cruel, and warlike People then the rest of the Indians;
came down out of the more inland parts of the Continent, and by force seized
upon one of the goodliest places near the Sea, and became a terror to all
their Neighbors, on whom they had exercised several acts of in humane cruelty;
insomuch that being fleshed with Victories over their Fellow-Indians; they
began to thirst after the blood of any Foreigners, English and Dutch that
accidentally came amongst them, in a way of Trade, or upon other Accounts.

In the year 1634. they treacherously and cruelly murdered Captain Stone, and
Captain Norton, who came occasionally with a Bark into the River to Trade with
them. Not long after, within the compass of the next year, they in like
treacherous manner, slew one Mr. Olaham (formerly belonging to New Plymouth,
but at that time an Inhabitant of the Massachusetts) at Block Island a place not
far from the mouth of their Harbor, as he was fairly Trading with them:
besides some other such like acts of perfideous cruel^y toward some of ^he
Dutch, that had formerly been trading up Connecticut River: by which practices
perceiving that they began to stink in the nosthrils of their Neighbors, whose
revenge they now began to fear, and not willing to have to deal with too many
Enemies at once, they imitated the subtlety of the Children of Am^on, when they
began to stink before David; endeavoring to strengthen themselves with
alliance of some of those they had formerly provoked, that by their assistance
they might defend themselves against the rest, not doubting but to make their
part good with their foreign Enemies, if they could be reconciled to their
Indian Neighbors, the Narrhagansets, or other homebred Enemies, if they could
but fortify themselves by a League of Friendship with any of their foreign
Neighbors that were newly come to plant in these parts. To this end they sent
Messengers with gifts to the Massachusetts in the latter end of the same year
1634. the first Messengers were dismissed without an answer: but they being
sensible of their own danger, and of the great importance a peace with the
English of the Massachusetts might be, pursued the business very earnestly,
sending Messengers a second time, who offered much Wampam (Indians Money) and
Beaver, with these second Messengers: the Governor and Council of the
Massachusetts had much conference many days; and at last after the best advice
they could take amongst themselves, concluded a Peace and Friendship with them,
upon these Conditions.

1. That they should deliver up to the English those persons amongst them that
were guilty of Captain Stones Death, and the rest that were with him.

2. That if the English desired to Plant in Connecticut they should give up
their right to them.

3. That the English should thence forward Trade with them as their Friends,
which was a chief thing aimed at; the said Pequods being at that time in War
with the Dutch, and the rest of their Neighbors, on the Reasons forementioned,
to these conditions they readily agreed, and also cunningly insinuated their
desire that their new Confederates, the Massachusetts should medi^ie a peace for
them with the Narrhagansets; intimating likewise then willingness that a part
of the Present which they promised to send should be given to them, standing so
much upon their honor, that they would not be seen to give any thing
themselves; such was the pride and height of Spirit lodged in this company of
Treacherous Villains, the Dregs and Lees of the Earth, and Dross of Mankind.

As for Capt. Stone's death they stily evaded the guilt of it, falsely adding
that there were but two left that had any hand therein, and that it was a just
quarrel wherein he was slain: for, said they, he surprised some of our men, and
would by force have compelled them to show him the way up the River, whereupon
the said Stone coming ashore, with two more, was watched by nine of our men
(say they) who finding them asleep in the night, slew them to deliver our own
men, one of whom going afterward to the Barque, it was suddenly blown up,
whereas the truth of the matter was thus,

The said Capt. Stone formerly belonging to Christophers in the West Indies,
occasionally coming to these parts, as he passed between this place and
Virginia put in at that River, where the Indians after they had been often on
board his Vessel to trade with him; at the last came friendly on board as they
used to do, but finding the Captain asleep in his Cabin, took the opportunity
to murder him as he lay, casting a Covering over him that he might not be
discerned by the rest whom they presently after dispatched one after another,
all but Capt. Norton, who made stout resistance, for a long time defending
himself in the Cook-room of the Bark, till the gunpowder which he had set in
an open vessel, to be more ready for his use, accidentally took fire, by which
fatal accident he was so burned and his eyes so blinded that he could not make
any longer resistance, but forthwith fell into the hands of these cruel and
bloodthirsty wretches, who after they had taken away his life made a prey of
all that was in the Vessel.

As for Mr. Oldman he was indeed murdered at an Island called by the Indians
Manisses (since known among the English by the name of Block-Island) but those
that murdered him (probably Inhabitants of the said Island,) fled presently to
the Pequods, by whom they were sheltered, and so became also guilty themselves
of his blood, which ere long was revenged by them, as is in the next place to
be declared.

The English of the Massachusetts after the peace concluded with the Pequods,
sent a Bark thither for trade, that trial might be made of the reality of
their friendship, but they found them treacherous and false, and that no
advantage was to be had by any commerce with them, insomuch as they took up a
resolution never more to have to do with them; which the said Indians
perceiving, made no account of the former peace, but took all advantage to do
us mischief, not only by harboring those who had murdered Mr. Oldham, but
surprising many of the English in the year 1636. when Connecticut River began
first to be planted, diverse of whom were killed (nine at one time in April
1637.) by them about Wethersfield, when the Plantation then first began, so as
they could not pass up and down the River without a Guard, but they would be in
danger of being cut off or carried away, as two Maids were said to be; thirty
men have been killed by them in all; those who fell into their hands alive,
were cruelly tortured after a most barbarous manner, by insulting over their
Prisoners in a blasphemous wise, when in their dying Agonies, under the
extremity of their pains (their flesh being first flashed with knives, and then
filled with burning Embers; they called upon God and Christ with gasping
groans, resigning up their Souls into their hands; with which words these
wretched Ca^tifs used to mock the English afterward, when they came within
their hearing and view.

About the same time some Agents sent over by the Lord Say, and the Lord Brook,
built a Fort at the mouth of Connecticut River, wherein was placed one
Lieutenant Gardener, and a convenient number of Soldiers to secure the place,
intended soon after to be planted, but all the winter following (scil.) in the
end of the year 1636. they were little better then besieged by the said
Salvages, not daring to stir out of command of the Fort, but they were ready to
be seized by these their barbarous Enemies: At one time the Lieutenant himself
with ten or twelve of the Soldiers; marching out of the Fort, with an intent
to pass over a Neck of Land, to burn the Marshes; as soon as ever they were
passed over the straight of the Neck, they espied a Company of Indians making
toward the said Istmus, which if they could not recover, they see they must
all perish; whereupon returning back with all speed, they very narrowly
escaped, and were two or three of them killed notwithstanding, before they
could get back into the Fort, which was presently surrounded with multitudes of
them; but the discharging of a piece of Ordnance gave them warning to keep
further from the Walls: sometimes they came with their Canooes into the river
in view of the Soldiers within the Fort, and when they apprehended themselves
out of reach of their gunns, they would imitate the dying groans and
invocations of the poor Captive English, which the English Soldiers were
forced with silent patience to bear; not being then in a capacity to requite
their insolent blasphemies. But they being by these horrible outrages justly
provoked to indignation, unanimously agreed to join their Forces together to
root them out of the earth with Gods Assistance.

The Colony of the Massachusetts did immediately set about it in the latter end
of the Summer (1636) by sending out fourscore men under the Command of Capt.
Endicot of Salem; who went to the Pequod Country by water, with Commission to
treat with the said Pequods, first offering terms of peace, if they would
surrender the Murderers of the English, and forbear further acts of hostility,
or else fight them.

The Captain aforesaid coming ashore with his Company, by a message sent them
by an interpreter, obtained some little speech with a great number of them at a
distance; but after they understood what was propounded to them, first
cunningly getting behind a hill, they presently ran away into the Woods and
Swamps, where there was no pursuing of them: however one discharging a gun
among them as they were taking their flight, stayed the course of one, which
was all that could be done against them for that time.

Winter approaching, and no encouragement presenting further to pursue them, at
that time it was resolved better to return back for the present, and wait a
further season when more Forces could be gathered together to pursue the
quarrel to the utmost.

During this interim the Pequods perceiving that they had by several late
injuryes and outrages, drawn upon themselves the hatred of all the English, as
well as of their own people by former wrongs; and distrusting their own ability
to deal with them all at once, did at the last by all subtle insinuations, and
persuasions, try to make their peace with the Narrhagansets, using such
Arguments as to right reason seemed not only pregnant to the purpose, but also
(if revenge that bewitching and pleasing passion of man's mind had not blinded
their eyes) most cogent and invincible: But they were by the good providence of
God witheld from embracing those counsels, which might otherwise have proved
most pernicious to the design of the English: viz. That the English were
Strangers, and began to overspread the Country, the which would soon be
possessed by them to the depriving the ancient inhabitants of their right, if
they were not timely prevented; and that the Narrhagansets would but make way
for their own ruin, by helping to destroy the Pequods; for after themselves
were subdued, it would not be long ere the Narrhagansets themselves, would in
the next place be rooted out likewise: Whereas if they would but join together
against the English they could demonstrate how the English might easily either
be destroyed or forced to leave the Country, and that without any danger to
themselves: telling them also that they never need come to any open Battles,
they might destroy them only by firing their houses, and killing their Cattle,
and lying in wait for them as they went about their ordinary occasions; which
course if it were pursued, they said their new and unwelcome neighbors could
not long subsist; but would either be starved with hunger and cold, or forced
to forsake the Country.

Matchiavel himself if he had fate in counsel with them could not have
insinuated stronger reasons to have persuaded them to a peace.

It is said that so much reason was apprehended in these motives, that the
Narrhagansets were once wavering, and were almost persuaded to have granted an
ear to their advice and persuasion and joined all against the English; but when
they considered what an advantage they had put into their hands by the strength
and favor of the English, to take a full revenge of all their former injuries,
upon their inveterate Enemies, the thought of that was so sweet that it turned
the scale against all other considerations whatsoever.

The report of the unheard of cruelties forementioned filling the ears of the
English throughout the Country; it was agreed by the joint consent of the
English throughout the three Colonies to unite all their Forces together, for
the suppressing the common Enemy, early in the Spring Anno, 1637. who were also
moved thereunto by their own necessities as well as by the earnest request of
their Friends at Connecticut.

Those of Plymouth being written unto by the Governor of the Massachusetts,
appeared very cordially willing thereunto, to which end they agreed to send
fifty men at their own charge, with as much speed as the matter required, with
sufficient Leaders appointed, and a Bark provided to carry them Provisions,
and tend upon them on all occasions; but before they could be dispatched away
the next Spring, News was brought that the Enemy was wholly routed, so as their
journey was stopped, and their good will accepted for the deed; as if they
really had been there to have born their part in the Service, their
nonappearance in time and place being not to be imputed to any backwardness in
their minds; but to their too late invitation to the Service; the motion
fetching a large compass from Connecticut down to the Massachusetts; from whom
in the last place they were solicited thereunto. And for the other two
Colonies, those of Connecticut being quickened on by the spurr of necessity, and
present sense of the insolency daily acted at their very doors, were soonest
upon their March, and by the good hand of God upon them, had given the main
stroke before their Friends of the Massachusetts could come up with them, yet
was there no repining for the want of the glory of the Victory, nor was their
any cause, those that were the chief actors therein being forward to give God
the glory of the whole, and not willing to pocket up any thing thereof
themselves, acknowledging that they never saw more of God, or less of man in
any business of that nature, as may more fully be understood by particulars
ensuing.

The Colony of the Massachusetts determined to send an hundred and sixty, of
whom an hundred and twenty were ordered under the conduct of Capt. Patrick of
Watertown, and Capt. Trask of Salem Capt. Stoughton of Dorchester, being to
command in chief; with whom was sent that holy man of God Mr. John Wilson
(Pastor of one Church of Boston) the Charets and Horsemen of our Israel, by
whose Faith and Prayer as sometimes was said of Luther (in reference to
Germany) the Country was preserved, so as it was confidently believed that no
Enemy should break in upon a place whilst he survived, which as some have
observed accordingly came to pass.

The matter requiring great expedition, and it being long before the whole
company could be dispatched away, Capt. Patrick with forty men were sent away
before hand, to be sure to meet with those of Connecticut in case they should
be in action, before the rest of our Forces could get into a readiness, which
accordingly came to pass; for the main business in taking the Fort was over,
even before the said Patrick could get thither. Capt. Underhill was sent by Mr.
Vane the Governor to Saybrook the winter before to strengthen the Garrison
there. The assaulting and surprising of which, being the most remarkable piece
of service in that whole expedition; take it as it was delivered in writing by
that valiant, faithful and prudent Commander Capt. Mason, chief in the action,
who lived long after to reap the fruit of his labor, and enjoy the benefit of
that days service, having an Inheritance given him in that part of the
Country, as a just reward of his faithful service on that day as well as at
other times. Wequash a Pequod by Nation, but disgusted by the Sachem, proved a
good guide by whose direction they were led to a Fort near Mystic River, some
miles nearer then Sassacous his Fort, which they first intended to assault.

'On the second Wednesday of May, being the tenth day of that Month, we set
sail with ninety men of the English in one Pink, one Pinnace, two Boats toward
the Pequods, with seventy River Indians, having somewhat a long passage to
Saybrook Fort, about forty of our Indians desired to go down by land on
Saturday, but on Monday they went forth from the Fort, and meeting seven
Pequods and Nianticks, they slew five outright, took one Prisoner and brought
him into Saybrook Fort, where he was executed by Captain Underhill, the other
escaped.

'On Monday we all landed at Saybrook Fort, and stayed there till tuesday;
Capt. Underhill joining nineteen men with himself to us: whereupon we sent back
twenty of ours to strengthen our Plantations: and so set sail on thursday
toward Narrhaganset, and arrived there on friday.

'On Saturday my self, with Capt. Underhill, Leiftenant Sealy, with our guard
marched to Canonicus by land, being about five miles distant, where we were
kindly entertained after their manner: having had parley with him, we sent to
Miantonimo, who would give no present answer; and so our Sabbath being on the
morrow, we adjourned our meeting until Monday, at which time there assembled
Miantonimo with the chiefest of them about two hundred men; and being solemnly
set for Consultation after their manner; we told them we were now going God
assisting, to revenge the wrong committed and blood shed by their and our
enemies, upon our native Countrymen, not any way desiring their aid, unless
they would voluntarily send, which they did exceedingly approve of: moreover we
told them that the English and they had always been friends for ought we knew,
and so we were with the Indians that had not wronged Englishmen, the which
they acknowledged, and so made a large description of the Pequods Country, and
told us they would send men with us; so we resolved there to keep our
rendezvouze at Canonicus his Plantation on the morrow night being Tuesday: but
the wind being stiff, we could not land our men till five or six of the clock
in the afternoon, at which time I landed on Narrhaganset shore with thirty two
men and so marched to the place of Rendezvouze formerly appointed: Capt.
Underhill and my Leiftenant landed the rest, and so came up to me that night.
About two hours before day came an Indian with a Letter from Capt. Patrick,
being then at Mr. To. Williams his plantation with forty men, who desired us
to stay for his coming and joining, not intimating when that would be: the
which being considered and debated, we thought could not be our safest course,
(though his present assistance was much desired) for these Reasons.

First. Because the day before when we had absolutely resolved to go, the
Indians plainly told us they thought we were but in jest, and also that
Englishmen did talk much but not fight, nay they concluded that they would not
go on: and besides if we should defer, we feared we should be discovered by
reason of the frequent recourse between them by certain Squaws (who have mutual
recourse) whereupon we were constrained to set forward toward the Pequods, with
seventy seven English, and about sixty River Indians, and as I suppose near
about two hundred Narrhagansets, and marched that night to the eastern
Nianticks, where we kept our Rendezvouze that night; The Sachem of the place
adding about an hundred of his men unto us.

We set forward and marched about ten miles, where making an Alta (or halt)
there we held a consultation with the Indians that desired to know what we
intended; we told them that we resolved to assault Sassacous his Fort, at which
they were all stricken, and as it were amazed with fear, as they plainly
confessed; and so after long debate and pressing of them, taxing them with
cowardice, some of them resolved to go along with us, though I suppose they
had no such intent, as appeared afterward; some of them left us to the number
as I suppose of an hundred or less; and marching on five miles further, we
made another Alta, where they told us we had near a dozen miles to Saffacous
his Fort as we gathered by their relation: Being very weary in traveling with
our arms, ammunition and provision; we were constrained to alter our resolution,
and resolve to attempt that Fort the which they had formerly described to be
three or four miles nearer; and also one of Capt. Vnderhills men failing put it
out of doubt. But whosoever says that Capt. Underhill had any falling out
about that or any thing else, does speak untruth: for we both resolved to
Sassacous his Fort, as we concluded in our consultation at Narrhaganset, and so
continued our resolution till we received the former reasons as grounds
sufficient to persuade us to the contrary, and to prosecute that which was most
likely to be accomplished.

They drew a Plot of the situation of the Pequods and described Sassacous his
Fort to be the nearest, which was the chief cause we determined to assault that
first, and had no reason leading till our last Alta, where upon the reasons
formerly mentioned, we changed our resolution: this they much desired and very
much rejoiced; for it was dreadful to them to hear the name of Sassacous.

From thence we marched two or three miles where we kept our rendezvouze,
supposing we had been within one mile of the Fort: They having sent an Indian
to discover beforehand, brought us news that they were secure, having been
fishing with many Canooes at Sea, and diverse of them walking here and there.

About two hours before day we marched toward the Fort, being weary and much
spent; many of us having slept nothing at all.

And so we began to march toward the Fort, the Lord being pleased wonderfully
to to assist and encourage us; after a tedious march of three or four miles,
about break of day we came fair in view of the Fort standing on the top of an
hill not steep; the Indians all falling back, were suddenly vanished out of
sight, so we made an Alta, and sent back for our Guide, who had promised to go
with us to the Fort, but his heart we saw much failed him; we asked him what
they intended who promised to wing us, and to surround the Fort; he told us
they were much afraid; but he seeing our resolution went to them and prevailed
with diverse of them to come up to us; we told them their best course would be
to flank the Fort on both sides, and having no time longer to confer, we
proceeded; Capt. Underhill to the western entrance with one division, my self
with the other to the eastern as silently as possibly we could, so it pleased
God we came up with the Palisado within two rod, before we were discovered, at
which time a dog began to bark, and an Indian cried out, but not being my self
rightly informed by the Indian of the right entrance, though there was a little
postern door, the which I had thought to have attempted to break down with my
foot; but the Lord directed me otherwise for the better; for I then feared we
could not there enter with our arms, which proved true, so I suddenly hasted
to the Palisado, and putting in the muzzle of my piece, discharged upon them,
and so the rest with all celerity; and suddenly hastened on toward that side
which stood toward the water; where I concluded was an entrance, and instantly
fell upon it, being only barred with two great forked boughs, or branches of
some tree, and hasting over them, I drew one after me my Lieutenant the other
way outward; then we suddenly fell upon the Wigwams, the Indians cried out in
most hideous manner, some issuing out of the Wigwams, shooting at us
desperately, and so creeping under beds that they had. We had resolved awhile
not to have burned it, but being we could not come at them, I then resolved to
set it on fire, after diverse of them were slain, and some of our men sore
wounded: So entering one of their wigwams, I took a firebrand [ at which time
an Indian drawing an arrow had killed him, but one Davis his Sergeant cut the
Bow-string with his Courtlace] and suddenly kindled a fire in the matts
wherewith they were covered, and fell to a retreat and surrounded the Fort; the
fire increasing violently, insomuch as that they were constrainned to climb to
the top of the Palisadoe; from whence they were soon fetched down, I suppose to
the number of an hundred and forty; many of of them issuing forth were suddenly
slain either by the English or Indians, who were in a ring without us, all
being dispatched and ended in the space of an hour, having two of our men
slain, and sixteen wounded.

Being very hot and dry we could very hardly procure any water, where we
continued one hour not knowing what course to take or which way to go, our
Pinnaces not being come in, neither did we know how far, or which way to go to
them; our Interpreter being an Indian and they so hurried and distracted with a
few hurt men, but chiefly as I conceive with fear of the Enemy, who suddenly
approached, that we could hardly come to speak with him, who knew nothing what
they intended.

But the Enemy approaching they began to cleave unto us, and I verily think
durst not leave us.

Our Pinnaces then coming in view with a fair gale, being guided as it were to
serve our necessity by the good hand of God, which I think was never more
eminently seen in a matter of like moment and less of man in several passages.
Then we set our men in order and prepared for fight and began to march toward
the Harbor where the Pinnaces were to ride: the Enemy approaching Capt.
Underhill with diverse Indians and certain English issued out to encounter them,
but they would not stand to it, for the most part they lay behind Rocks, Trees
and Bushes, we marched on they still dodging of us; sometimes desperately
hazarding themselves in open field, where some of them were slain in open view,
and as we hear many wounded: I was somewhat cautelous in bestowing many shot
upon them needlessly, because I expected a strong opposition; and thus they
continued to follow us till we came within two miles of our Pinnaces where they
wholly left us, which was near six miles as I conceive, having then about two
miles more to the River.

Four of our wounded men we were forced to carry our selves, while at length we
hired the Indians to bear them, both in this and all their following
enterprises against the Pequods:

Here note that one Wequash a Pequod fell from his Countrymen, and proved a
Guide to the English.

This service being thus happily accomplished by these few hands that came from
Connecticut, within a while after, the Forces sent from the Massachusetts under
the conduct of Captain Stoughton as Commander in chief arrived there also, who
found a great part of the work done to their hands, in the surprizal of the
Pequods Fort as aforesaid, which yet was but the breaking of the nest, and
unkenneling those salvage Wolves; for the Body of them, with Sassacous the
chief Sachem (whose very name war a terror to all the Narrhagansets) were
dispersed abroad and scattered all over their Country, yet so far dismayed,
that they never durst make any assault upon the English, that in several
parties were scatered about in pursuit of them.

It was not long after Capt. Stonghtons Soldiers came up before news was
brought of a great number of the Enemy, that were discovered by the side of a
River up the Country, being first trapanned by the Narrhagansets, under
pretense of securing them, but they were truly hemmed in by them, though at a
distance, yet so as they could not, or durst not stir from the place, by which
means our Forces of the Massachusetts had an easy Conquest of some hundreds of
them who were there couped up as in a Pound: not daring to fight, not able to
fly away, and so were all taken without any opposition: the men among them to
the number of thirty were turned presently into Charons Ferry-boat, under the
command of Skipper Gallop, who dispatched them a little without the Harbor;
the Females and Children were disposed of according to the will of the
Conquerers, some being given to the Narrhagansets, and other Indians that
assisted in the service.

The rest of the Enemy being first fired out of their strong hold, were taken
and destroyed, a great number of them, being seized in the places where they
intended to have hid themselves, the rest fled out of their own Country over
Connecticut River, up toward the Dutch Plantation. Our Soldiers being resolved
by Gods assistance to make a final destruction of them, were minded to pursue
them which way soever they should think to make their escape, to which end in
the next place, our Soldiers went by Water toward New Haven, whether they
heard, and which in reason was most likely) they bent their course? soon
after they were informed of a great number of them, that had betaken
themselves to a neighboring place not far of, vvhither they might hope it was
not like they should be pursued; but upon search they found fifty or sixty
Wigvvams, but without any Indians in any of them, but heard that they had
passed along tovvard the Dutch Plantation, vvhereupon our Soldiers that were
before, all embarked for Quillepiack, afterward called New Haven, and being
landed there, they had not far to march unto the place where it was most
probable they should (...) find or hear of them; accordingly in their march
they met here and there with sundry of them, whom they slew or took prisoners,
amongst whom were two Sachems, whom they presently beheaded; to a third that
was either a Sachem or near a kin to one, they gave his life upon codition that
he should go and enquire where Sassacous was, and accordingly bring them word;
this Indian overlooking all other national or natural obligations, in
consideration of his life that was received on that condition, proved very true
and faithful to those that sent him, his order was to have returned in three
days, but not being able within so short a time to make a full discovery of
the business, and also find an handsome way to escape, he made it eight days
before he returned, in which something fell out not a little remarkable; for
those he was sent to discover, suspecting at the last by his withdrawing
himself that he came for a Spy, pursued after him, so as he was forced to fly
for his life, and getting down to the Seaside he accidentally met with a
Canooe a little before turned adrift, by which means he padled by some shift or
other so far out of the harbor, that making a sign he was discerned of some
on board one of the Vessels that attended on our Soldiers, by whom being taken
up he made known what he had discovered: But after he was gone Sassacous
suspecting (and not without just cause) what the matter was, made his escape
from the rest with twenty or thirty of his men to the Mohawkes, by whom himself
and they were all murdered afterward, being hired thereunto by the
Narrhagansets, as was confidently affirmed and believed.

Thus this treacherous and cruel Villain with his Companions, having against
his Faith and promise, as well as contrary to the Laws of nature and nations,
murdered several others, both of the Dutch and English Nation, is in the same
manner himself against the laws of Hospitality murdered by those to whom he
fled for refuge; Vengeance is mine says the Lord, I will repay it.

It is worthy our observation, that this Sassacous the chief Sachem of the
Pequods, as Philip of Mount-hope, (both of them in their several times and
places the contrivers of many bloody and cruel mischiefs, yet) escaped the
hands of those whom they had so many ways provoked to the utmost degree of
indignation, that so they might not too much gratify their own spirits in
taking revenge; but it must be brought about by those means, in which the glory
of divine vengeance and justice shall more eminently shine forth, that it might
be truly said of them as Adonibesek confessed of himself, A^ I have done, so
God has requited me. But to return.

(...) ^erest of the Pequods from whom Sassacous had made an escape, ^tted
every one for himself, leaving but three or four behind them (when a party of
our Soldiers according to the direction of him that was sent as a Spy came
upon the place) who would not or could not tell them whither their Company were
fled; but our Soldiers ranging up and down as providence guided them, at the
last, July 13. 1637. they lighted upon a great number of them, they pursued in
a small Indian town seated by the side of an hideous Swamp (near the place
where Fairfield or Stratford now stand) into which they all slipped as well
Pequods as natives of the place; before our men could make any shot upon them,
having placed a Sentinel to give warning; Mr. Ludlow and Capt. Mason with half
a score of their men happened to discover this crew. Capt. Patrick and Capt.
Trask with about an hundred of the Massachuset Forces came in upon them
presently after the alarm was given; such Commanders as first happened to be
there gave special order that the Swamp should be surrounded (being about a
mile in Compass) but Lieutenant Davenport belonging to Capt. Trask his Company,
not hearing the word of Command, with a douzen more of his Company in an over
eager pursuit of the enemy, rushed immediately into the Swamp, where they were
very rudely entertained by those evening wolves that were then kennelled
therein, for Lieft. Davenport was sorely wounded in the Body, John Wedgwood of
Ipswich in the belly, and was laid hold on also by some of the Indians; Thomas
Sherman of the said Ipswich in the neck; some of their neighbors that ventured
in with them were in danger of the Enemies arrows that flew very thick about
them, others were in as much hazard of being swallowed by the miery boggs of
the Swamp wherein they stuck so fast, that if Sergeant Riggs of Roxbury had not
rescued two or three of them they had fallen into the hands of the enemy; but
such was the strength and courage of those that came to the rescue, that some
of the Indians being slain with their Swords, their friends were quickly
relieved, and drawn out of the mire and danger.

But the Indians of the place, who had for company sake run with their Guests
the Pequods into the swamp, did not love their friendship so well as to be
killed with them also for company sake, wherefore they began to bethink
themselves that they had done no wrong to the English, and desired a parley
which was granted, and presently understood by the means of Thomas Stanton an
exact Interpreter then at hand, upon which the Sachem of the place with several
others their wives and children, that liked better to live quietly in their
wigwams then be buried in the Swampe, came forth and had their lives granted
them: after some time of further parley with these, the interpreter was sent in
to offer the like terms to the rest, but they were Possessed with such a spirit
of stupidity and sullenness that they resolved rather to sell their lives for
what they could get there; and to that end began to let fly their arrows thick
against him as intending to make his blood some part of the price of their own;
but through the goodness of God toward him, his life was not to be sold on that
account, he being presently fetched off.

By this time night drawing on, our Commanders perceiving on which side of the
Swampe the enemies were lodged, gave order to cut through the Swamp with their
swords, that they might the better hemme them round in one corner, which was
presently done, and so they were begirt in all night, the English in the
circumference plying them with shot all the time, by which means many of them
were killed and buried in the mire, as they found the next day. The Swamp by
the forementioned device being reduced to so narrow a compass, that our
soldiers standing at twelve foot distance could surround it, the enemy was
kept in all the night; but a little before daybreak (by reason of the Fogge
that uses to arise about that time observed to be the darkest time of the
night) twenty or thirty of the lustiest of the enemy brake through the
Besiegers, and escaped away into the woods, some by violence and some by
stealth dropping away, some of whom notwithstanding were killed in the pursuit;
the rest were left to the mercy of the Conquerers, of which many were killed in
the swamp like sullen dogs, that would rather in their self-willedness and
madness sit still to be shot through or cut in pieces, then receive their lives
for the asking at the hand of those into whose power they were now fallen: Some
that are yet living and worthy of credit do affirm, that in the morning
entering into the Swamp, they saw several heaps of them sitting close together,
upon whom they discharged their pieces laden with ten or twelve pistol bullets
at a time, putting the muzzles of their pieces under the boughs within a few
yards of them; so as besides those that were found dead (near twenty) it was
judged that many more were killed and sunk into the mire and never were minded
more by friend or foe: of those who were not so desperate or sullen to sell
their lives for nothing, but yielded in time, the male Children were sent to
the Bermudas, of the females some were distributed to the English towns, some
were disposed of among the other Indians to whom they were deadly enemies as
well as to our selves.

Thus overthrow given to the Pequods struck such a terror into all the ^ndians
in those parts (some of whom had been ill-affected to the English before) that
they sought our friendship, and tendered themselves to be under our protection,
which they then obtained, and have never since for feited it any of them till
this late rebellion of Philip the subject of the discourse foregoing. Amongst
the rest of the Prisoners special notice was taken of the Wife of a noted
Indian called Mononotto, who with her Children submitted her self, or by the
chance of the war fell into the hands of the English: it was known to be by
her mediation that two English maids (that were taken away from Wether^field
upon Connecticut River) were saved from death, in requital of whose pity and
humanity, the life of her self and her children was not only granted her, but
she was in special recommended to the care of that honorable gentleman Mr.
John Winthrop, for that time being the worthy Governor of the Massachusetts;
who taking notice of her modest countenance and behavior, as well as of her
only request (not to suffer wrong either as to the honor of her body or fruit
of her womb) gave special charge concerning her according to his noble and
Christian disposition.

After this slaughter at the Swamp the Pequods being upon every turn exposed to
revenge of the Mohegins on one side, and Narrhagansets on the other, chose
rather to submit themselves to the English, by whom they were put, some under
the Mohegin, and some under the Narrhagansets, which at last proved the
occasion of the present quarrel as is conceived, through the ambition of
Miantonimo, as was at first related.

This was the issue of the Pequod War, which in the day of it here in
New England was then as formidable to the Country in general as the present
War with Philip; the experience of which because it may administer much
matter of Comfort and encouragement to the surviving Generation, as well as of
praise and thanksgiving to almighty God from all those who have thus long
quietly enjoyed the benefit and reaped the fruit of their labor, and courage
who engaged therein: the more pains has been taken to search out the broken
pieces of that Story and thus put them together before the memory thereof was
buried in the ruins of time, and past the recovery and knowledge of the present
age, the which though it be here in the last place recorded, should in the
first be remembered.

A Table showing the Towns and places which are inhabited by the English in New
England: those that are marked with figures, as well as expressed by their
names, are such as were assaulted by the Indians, during the late awful
revolutions of providence.
NVmb. 1. Mount-hope. A gallant neck of Land where Philip dwelt who first began
the insurrection against the English, June 24. 1675.

2. The place where stands the town of Swanzy consisting of forty dwelling
houses, most of them very fair Buildings, just at the entrance on to
Mount-hope, where were June, 24. 1675, slain six men at Bournes Garrison, in
Metapoiset (another Neck marked *) not far from the former) and three wounded
as they came from the public Meeting, two killed that went for the Surgeon:
and a negro of Mr. Mile's wounded, so as he dyed soon after. Also Layton Archer
and his son were slain June 25. which three belonged to Road Island, but were
killed at the Fall River, though by misinformation it is elsewhere published
that it was done June 24. Also eighteen houses were burnt within Mount-hope,
that belong^d to Swanzy town; the rest of the town being all burned the next
year. June 16. 1676. save six houses that are yet standing: besides the
barbarous murder of Mr. Hezekiah Willet, June 26. 1676.

3. Middleburrough, formerly called Namasket, where Sausaman was slain: it is
situate between Plymouth and Tanton, and is misplaced in the Map. Here one J.
Marks was walking in a field of Indian corn, in July 1675. had his thigh bone
broke by a shot from an Indian, after which he lay forty eight hours before he
was found, and yet was alive, but his wound was so putrefied, that he dyed
thereof. When the town was first assaulted, the Miller running back to shut
down his mill, was assaulted by seven Indians at one time, by eleven at
another, had several bullets shot through his coat, yet gat safe to the
Garrison; but the people were forced to retire to Plymouth with their goods
soon after, when the whole village was destroyed by the Indians.

4. Dartmouth, where in July 1676. a man and a woman were slain by the Indians;
another woman was wounded and taken; but because she had kept an Indians child
before, so much kindness was showed her as that she was sent back, after they
had dressed her wound; the Indians guarded her till she came within sight of
the English.

5. Seaconke or Rehoboth, where were burned eight farm houses in the end of
June, and beginning of July 1675. on March 28. 1676. forty five dwelling houses
were there burned, whereof thirty eight were inhabited, and the owners thereby
turned out of doors, and left without house or harbor. Beside 21. barns, two
corn mills, one Saw Mill burnt at the same time. June 16. 1676. eight farm
houses were there also consumed by the fire of the enemy. The persons slain
here were seven, four with Capt. Pierce, March 26. 1676. another March 28.
another Apr. 28. The last May 29.

6. Pocasset, where were some houses burned July 1675. and seven or eight slain
in the Swamp near the place: here also Capt. Church gave the enemy a notable
defeat the same month.

7. Tanton, where were fifteen persons slain by the Indians, eleven men, two
maids, and two youths: besides a man slain in the fight with Capt. Beers; some
in the year 1675. and some 1676. Page 25. 26.

8. Mendam, where were the first English slain within the Massachusetts Colony,
to the number of five or six, July 1675. within a few months after the whole
village was destroyed. page 26, 27, 31.

9. Brookefield or Squabaog, was destroyed by the Indians August 2. 1675.
thereof the chief inhabitants viz. John Eires, John Pritchet and Richard Coy,
treacherously slain under pretense of a treaty. page 32. 33.

10. Deerfield or Pocumtuck a village newly planted, where Sept. 12. 1675.
diverse were slain, and the houses burned by the enemy. Between this place and
Northampton was a Skirmish with the enemy, 1675. eight or nine of the English
were there slain, and twenty six of the enemy. Near unto this place was Capt.
Lothrop set upon with seven or eight hundred Indians, whereby himself, and most
of his Soldiers, to the number of 73. cut off Sept. 18. 1675. page 36, 37, 38,
39. The fight at the Falls, a little beyond Deerfield. page 91. It is
considerable that that the evening before Capt. Turner and Capt. Holioke gave
the enemy a Camizado in the wigwams, they had been feasting and dancing, having
before they laid down to sleep filled their bellyes with new Milk, (as an
English woman then in their hands, did declare, who was made to milk Hatfield
Cowes, which a day or two before they had driven away. So that when they were
most secure, destruction came upon a great part of them, to the number of three
hundred and fifty, as was judged by such as were there. vide page 91.

11. Squakheag, another village newly begun, which was also destroyed Sept.
1675. near unto this place Capt. Beers was slain, and nineteen of his men, as
they went to relieve the garrison there. page 37.

12. Springfield, which was treacherously assaulted October. 5. 1675. by three or
four hundred Indians, when L. Cooper and two more were slain, and 35. houses
burned with other buildings belonging thereunto. Some others were there slain
in the winter following, page 41. Within a few miles of this place Capt. Samuel
Holioke handselled his office with the slaughter of four or five of the enemy.
Three or four were here slain the winter following.

13. Hatfield, a small town seated on the west side of Connecticut River, over
against Hadly, which was furiously assaulted by 700 Indians, October. 19. 1675.
yet was the place preserved by the valor of the English with the loss but of
one man, Sergeant Norton by name, page 42. although seven or eight of the Scouts
were that day surprised and slain by the enemy, and one or two of the town. It
was assaulted also 1676. when five men were slain that came to their relief
from Hadly. page 93.

14. North-Hampton, a fair town three or four miles distant from Hatfield,
which was several times assaulted by the enemy, yet was preserved with the loss
but of a few of the people, and the burning of seven or eight of the houses
thereof, page 44. 77.

15 Hadly, a considerable town on the east side of Connecticut River, violently
assaulted by the enemy, yet no considerable hurt done, June 12. 1676 only some
few were surprised and flain, page 94. that without order would venture without
the Palizadoes. In the March before one Goodman Deacon of the Church, was slain
at Hoccanum, belonging to Hadley, and two more that went against order and
Command, to the top of mount Holioke.

16. West field, a small town seven miles west from Springfield, where some few
houses were burned before or in the winter, 1675. and three or four persons
slain, as they passed toward Springfield, page 44.

17. A Village called Quonsigomog in the middle way between Marlborough, and
Quabaog, consisting of about six or seven houses.

18. Jer. Bulls garrison house, at Pettiquemscot, surprised and sundry persons
slain; a very great damage to the design then in hand against Narrhaganset
Fort. page 50 51.

19. Canonicus Fort taken by the Forces of the three Colonyes, December. 19.
1675. though with the loss of many of the English, 79. being slain right out,
and about an hundred wounded, of the enemy were slain by the confession of some
prisoners, about 300. of their best men; though Ninicrafts men who buried the
dead there left, speak not of a third part so many, page 51. 52.

20. Warwick a town near Providence seated upon a neck of land, environed by
the sea, was all of it burned by the enemy at several times, the chief mischief
there done, was upon the 16. March 1676. and the place wholly deserted by the
Inhabitants for a time; yet but one man killed, that was too confident of his
safety, as is said.

Providence, is the town next Warwick where were eighteen houses burned June
28. 1675. March 29 following, fifty four houses were there burned, and most of
the rest as they were deserted by the Inhabitants withdrawing to Road-Island.

Petuxet is another small place within four miles of Providence, where were
twelve houses burned in the beginning of March, 1676. page 66. 67. It was by a
small brook called Abbots Run, that falls into Patuxet, (a River near
Providence) where Captain Pierce and his men were slain. ibid.

Bridgwater, a small town between Tanton and Weymouth. page 68.

21. Lancaster, or Nashaway. a small town of about 50. familyes, was assaulted
Febru. 10. 1675 by 500. Indians in five several companies; yet they took but
one garrison house; wherein were forty two persons, but eight or nine
soldiers, whereof but one escaped; the rest were women and children, who were
most of them returned after some months Captivity. And to prevent mistakes, let
it here be observed, that none of the women were abused, or murdered, but one
that was big with child, unable to travel, and much discontented, whom the
Indians, having made a great fire, and gathered a Ring about her, first knocked
her on the head, after they had pulled off her clothes, then barbarously cast
her into the Fire. No credit is to be given to any other reports of Cruelty
toward any English Woman in that part of the Country.

23. Groton, surprised March 2. as is related page 60. and 61. the place
consisting of about 60. families, was soon after deserted, yet are there 14. or
15. houses left standing to this day, though not inhabited for the present.

the Indians; seventeen persons slain, and much of the town burned, page 61, 62.

31. Marlborough, a town ten miles beyond Sudbury, in the way to Connecticut,
the people repairing in time to garrison houses, were not many of them slain;
yet were many or most of their houses burned that were deserted, March 26. 1676.

32. Sudbury, A convenient town, violently assaulted Apr. 18. 1676. p. 79. by
eight or nine hundred Indians (the Inhabitants speak of 1400) a tripartite
company intending to have carried all before them, yet slew but three of the
inhabitants, besides ten or eleven that came to their relief from Concord, that
were sadly lost for want of good conduct. Feb. 1. 1675. Tho. Eames his house at
a farm three miles distant from the town, his corn, cattle, barns all burned,
his family captived; the next day his sons wife dyed; Eames himself being from
home.

33. Concord, a considerable town five or six miles to the North-west of
Sudbury; they sustained not much damage in the town, save only in some Farms
that were at some distance there from: two men threshing at a Barn, a young
maid set to watch, was carried captive and the men both slain; the maid
strangly escaped soon after. page 80.

34. Chelmsford, where were many deserted houses burned in the beginning of
April 1676. belonging to one Ed. Colburn, that had formerly purchased the seat
of Capt. Web. And to Samuel Varnham, who had two sons slain in the Boat as they

bundle of linen, in which was found wrapped up the scalp of one or both the
children.

40. Casco, a large Bay scatteringly inhabited and full of Islands, where Sept.
1. 1675. Mr. Purchase his house was plundered.

Sept. 9. following Wakely's house and family were spoiled.

12. ditto. Two houses burned of Mr. Mountjoy's, and two young men slain as
they were fowling.

19. One slain at Blew-point; another wounded, so as he dyed the next day,

20. A man and his wife slain.

October. 19. following, eleven or twelve houses burned at Scarborough a place
not far from Casco. with 500 bushels of corn in barns.

October. 9. Lieut. Augur mortally wounded, and his Brother slain; and two more
wounded.

10. ditto. Henery Williams sorely wounded on Sawco sands or Downs, marvelously
escaped from two Indians passing to Blackpoint.

13. Capt. Wincol, that came to relieve Black-Point, had two of his men slain,
and two more with an Inhabitant wounded; himself and his Party engaged the same
day with an hundred Indians or more; yet was delivered by the shelter of an
heap of Bolts: But nine men coming to their relief from Sawco were all slain on
the Downs the same day; Thomas Rogers one of the nine, his house burned the
next day. Part. 2. page 25. 26.

page, 16, 17.

The 3 d. of November. twenty of the Inhabitants of Scarborough or Black-Point,
were set upon by sixty Indians, by whom they had been destroyed, but that
Ensign Tipping, the week before sent from Boston for the Relief of that place,
came seasonably to their relief.

6. ditto, a Boston Soldier was mortally wounded: several houses that day
burned, yet were they by the valor of the English beaten into Swamps, but what
number of them was slain, is uncertain.

21. Two houses more burnt at Saweo.

51. Wells, where two or three were killed, Par. 2. page 26.

murdered, Sept. 25. 1676. Par. 2. page 51.

48. Totonnock Fort, which lies up Kennibeck River, whither the Indians are
said to have fled, when Major Walden arrived there with his Soldiers in
February last, 1676. and from whence the enemy came down when they seized the
Inhabitants of Kennibeck, and Arowsick Island, Aug 11. 1676. which is situate
in the mouth of the said River.

It is Reported by some of the Inhabitants of Kennebeck, lately fled, or rather
driven from thence, that about five years since, four English men were slain by
the Amoroscoggin Indians, up Pegypscot River, that runs into Kennebeck; but it
was concealed by the wicked Traders of those parts, for fear of discovering
their wicked manner of trading with the Heathen; which if it had been duly
enquired into, when it was first done, much of what followed might have been
prevented; -- Quid non mortalia pectora cogis
Auri sacra Fames?


But such Gains have proved like Aurum Tholousanum to some of the Inhabitants
of those parts.

Kennibeck, how taken and when, Par. 2. page 41. there is said to be about
fifty three killed and taken about Kennibeck, and at Arousick Island. Aug. 13.
1676.

A Postscript.
COncerning the Narrhagansets, this is further to be added here, that Mr.
Thomas Stanton, and his son Robert, who have a long time lived amongst them,
and best acquainted with their language and manners of any in New England, do
affirm that to their knowledge, the Narrhaganset Sachems before the late
troubles had two thousand fighting men under them, and nine hundred arms, yet
are they at this day so broken and scattered, that there is none of them left
on that side of the Country, unless some few, not exceeding seventy in number,
that have sheltered themselves under the Inhabitants of Road-Island, as a
Merchant of that place worthy of credit, lately affirmed to the Writer hereof.
It is considerable by what degrees they have been consumed and destroyed.

The first week in April last, viz. 1676. Caronchet their chief Sachem, having
with this people been driven out of his own Country, by the sword of the
English the winter before; breathed still nothing but rage and cruelty against
them, bearing himself upon his great numbers: yet as appeared in the issue
himself and they that escaped with him, were not so much preserved from the
present calamity that befell the rest in their Fort, as reserved to another and
more ignominious death. For all the whole Body of the Indians to the westward
trusting under the shadow of that aspiring Bramble; he took a kind of care of
them upon himself: wherefore foreseeing so many hundreds could not well subsist
without Planting, he propounded it in his Council, that all the West
Plantations upon Connecticut River, taken from the English, should this last
Summer be planted with Indian-Corn: which was indeed in it self a very prudent
consideration: To that end he resolved to venture himself with but thirty men,
(the rest declining it) to fetch seed-corn from Seaconk, the next town to
Mount-hope; leaving a Body of men, not fewer then fifteen hundred to follow
him, or meet him about Seaconk the week after. This Adventure brought him into
the snare, from whence he could not escape: For Capt. George Denison of
Stonington, and Capt. Avery of New London, having raised forty seven English,
the most part Volunteers, with eighty Indians, twenty of which were
Narrhagansets belonging to Ninogret; commanded by one called Carapazet. The
rest Pequods under Casasinnamon, and Mohegins under Oneco, Son to Vncas, being
now abroad upon their third Expedition, which they began March, the twenty
seventh, 1676. and ended on the tenth of April following. They met with a stout
Indian of the Enemies, whom they presently flew, and two old Squaws, that
confessed Nanunttenoo, alias Canunchat, (those chief Sachems usually changing
their names at every great dance, and by that name of Nanunttenoo was he then
known,) was not far of; which welcome News put new Life into the wearied
Soldiers, that had traveled hard many days, and met with no Booty till now;
especially, when it was confirmed by Intelligence the same instant, brought in
by their Scouts, that they met with new Tracks which brought them in view of
some Wigwams not far from Patucket, by some called Blackstones River, in one of
which the said Sachem was at that moment divertizing himself, with the recital
of Captain Pierces slaughter, surprised by his men a few days before, but the
Alarm of the English at that time heard by himself, put by that discourse,
apalled with the suddenness thereof, as if he had been informed by secret Item
from Heaven, that now his own turn was come: so as having but seven men about
him, he sent up two of them to the top of the Hill, to see what the matter was,
but they affrighted with the near approach of the English, at that time with
great speed mounting over a fair Champagna on the other side of the Hill, ran
by, as if they wanted time to tell what they saw; presently he sent a third,
who did the like; then sending two more on the same Errand, one of these last
either endued with more Courage, or a better Sense of his duty, informed him in
great have that all the English Army was upon him; whereupon, having no time to
consult, and but little to Attempt an escape, and no means to defend himself;
he began to dodge with his pursuers, running round the Hill on the contrary
side; but as he was running so hastily by, Catapazat with twenty of his
Followers; and a few of the English, lightest of foot, ghessed by the swiftness
of his motion, that he fled as if an Enemy, which made them immediately take
the Chase after him, as for their lives; he that was the swifter pursuer, put
him so hard to it, that he cast off first his Blanket, then his silver laced
Coat, (given him at Boston as a pledge of their friendship, upon the renewal of
his League in October before,) and Belt of Peag, which made Catapazat conclude
it was the right bird, which made them pursue as eagerly as the other fled; so
as they forced him to take the water, through which as he over hastily plunged,
his foot slipping upon a stone, it made him fall into the water so deep, as it
wetted his Gun, upon which Accident, he confessed soon after, that his heart
and his bowels turned within him, so as he became like a rotten stick, void of
strength; insomuch, as one Monopoide a Pequod, swiftest of foot, laid hold of
him within thirty Rod of the River side, without his making any resistance;
Though he was a very proper man, of goodly stature, and great Courage of mind,
as well as strength of body; one of the first English that came up with him,
was Robert Stanton, a young man that scarce had reached the twenty second year
of his Age, yet adventuring to ask him a question, or two, to whom this manly
Sachem looking with a little neglect upon his youthful face, replied in broken
English; you much Child, no understand matters of War; let your brother, or
your chief come, him I will Answer, and was as good as his word; Acting herein,
as if by a Pythagorean Metempsychosts, some old Roman Ghost had possessed the
body of this Western Pagan: And like Attilius Regulus, he would not accept of
his own Life, when it was tendered him, upon that (in his account) low Condition
of Compliance with the English, refusing to send an old Counselor of his to
make any motion that way, saying, he knew the Indians would not yield; but more
probably he was not willing they should, choosing rather to sacrifice his own,
and his peoples lives to his private humor of Revenge, than timely to provide
for his own, and their safety, by entertaining the Counsels of a Peace, so
necessary for the general good of all; He continuing in the same his obstinate
Resolution, was carried soon after to Stonington, where he was shot to death,
by some of his own quality, sc. the young Sachem of the Mohegins, and two of
the Pequods of like quality. This was the Confusion of a damned wretch, that
had often opned his mouth to blaspheme the Name of the living God and those
that make profession thereof. He was told at large of his breach of Faith, and
how he boasted he would not deliver up a Wampanoog, or the paring of a
Wampanoogs nail, that He would burn the English alive in their houses, to
which he replied, others were as forward for the War as himself; and that he
desired to hear no more thereof. And when he was told his Sentence was to dye,
he said, he liked it well, that he should die before his heart was soft, or had
spoken any thing unworthy of himself. He told the English before they put him
to death, that the killing him, would not end the War; but it was a
considerable step thereunto, nor did it live much longer after his death, at
least, not in those parts; For after Sudbury fight, when the Sun of their hopes
was at its highest. April the eighteenth following, it visibly declined, till
it set in a night of obscure and utter darkness upon them all, as is to be
feared.

The Inhabitants of New London, Norwich, and Stonington, appr^hensive of their
danger by reason of the near bordering of the Ene^, and upon other prudent
considerations, voluntarily listed themselves under some able Gentlemen, and
Resolute Soldiers amongst themselves, Major Palms, Captain George Denison,
Captain Avery, with whom, or under whom, within the compass of the year, 1676.
they made ten or more, several Expeditions, in all which, at those several
times they killed and took two hundred and thirty nine of the Enemy, by the
help and assistance of the Pequods, Mohegins, and a few friendly Narrhagansets.
Besides thirty taken in the long march homeward, after the Fort fight, December
the nineteenth, 1675. and besides sixteen Captived in the second Expedition,
not reckoned within the compass of the said Number: together with fifty Guns;
and spoiling the Enemy of seven Bushels of Corn.

In January they went again in pursuit, and took five men and a Boy. Certain
Nipnets intended to have sheltred themselves under Vncas; but he perceiving it
would be distastful to the English, soon shab'd them off; so as they were in
the beginning of the Winter brought into Boston, many of them by Peter Ephraim,
and Andrew Pityme, with their Fellows.

In all which Exploits, neither they, nor any of their Followers sustained any
loss by the Sword of the Enemy, or sickness: As is expressly declared by the
Reverend Minister of Stonington, Mr. James Noyce, which is a matter very
Admirable to consider, engaging all that were any way concerned in such signal
Testimonies of Divine Favor, to be ready to pay their Vows to the most High,
who alone teaches the hands of his people to war, and their fingers to fight.

But the greatest Blow given to the Narrhagansets was by Connecticut Forces
under Major Talcot, July the second, as is related, part, 1. page 97.

Amongst the rest of the Prisoners then taken, was a young sprightly Fellow,
seized by the Mohegins; who desired of the English Commanders that he might be
delivered into their hands, that they might put him to death, more majorum;
sacrifice him to their Cruel Genius of Revenge, in which brutish and div^lish
passion they are most of all delighted: The English though not delighted in
blood, yet at this time were not unwilling to gratify their humor, lest by a
denial, they might disoblige their Indian friends, of whom they lately made so
much use: Partly also that they might have an ocular demonstration of the
Salvage, barbarous Cruelty of these Heathen: And indeed, of all the Enemies
that have been the Subjects of the precedent discourse; This Villain did most
deserve to become an Object of Justice and Severity: For he boldly told them,
that he had with his Gun dispatched nineteen English, and that he had charged
it for the twentieth; but not meeting with any of ours, and unwilling to loose
a fair shot, he had let fly at a Mohegin, and killed him; with which, having
made up his number, he told them he was fully satisfied. But as is usually
said, Justice Vindictive has iron hands, though leaden feet: This cruel
Monster is fallen into their power, that will repay him seven fold: In the
first place therefore, making a great Circle, they placed him in the middle,
that all their Eyes might at the same time, be pleased with utmost Revenge upon
him; They first cut one of his Fingers round in the joint, at the Trunck of his
hand, with a sharp knife, and then brake it off, as men use to do with a
slaughtered Beast, before they uncase him; then they cut off another and
another, till they had dismembered one hand of all its digits, the blood
sometimes spirting out in streams a yard from his hand, which barbarous and
unheard of Cruelty, the English were not able to bear, it forcing Tears from
their Eyes; yet did not the Sufferer ever relent, or show any sign of Anguish:
For being asked by some of his Tormentors, how he liked the War? he might have
replied, as the Scotch Gentleman did after the loss of a Battle, that being
asked how he liked the match sc. with our Prince of Wales, (which then was the
occasion of the quarrel) made Answer, he liked the match well enough, but no
whit liked the manner of the wooing written by such Lines of blood; but this
unsensible and hard hearted Monster Answered, he liked it very well, and found
it as sweet, as English men did their Sugar. In this frame he continued, till
his Executioners had dealt with the Toes of his feet, as they had done with the
Fingers of his hands; All the while making him dance round the Circle, and
sing, till he had wearied both himself and them: At last they brake the bones
of his Legs, after which he was forced to sit down, which it is said he silently
did, till they had knocked out his brains. Instances of this nature should be
Incentive unto us, to bless the Father of Lights, who has called us out from
the dark places of the Earth, full of the Habitations of Cruelty. When the
Dayspring from on high shall visit those that sit in this Region of darkness,
another Spirit will be poured upon them, and when the feet of them that bring
the glad Tidings of Gospel Salvation will appear more beautiful to them than at
present they seem to do. And when these Mountains of Prey shall become the holy
Mountain of the Lord, they shall neither hurt, nor destroy, nor exercise
Cruelty therein.

Moreover, in the beginning of April, 1677. Certain Intelligence came from
Pascataqua; That some strange Indians had fallen upon Major Walderns Indians,
and destroyed several of them.

It is also informed, that the Indians of Kennibeck have lately surprised five
or six of the Soldiers by an Ambush, as they were about to have buried some of
the bodies of their Friends, slain in those parts before the last Winter: And
that they had the last week done the like mischief to such a number of the
Inhabitants of Black-point, which is a solemn Presage of another Storm like to
fall upon those Eastern parts, unless God prevent, this Summer ensuing.

For the further satisfaction of the Reader concerning the perfidiousness and
falssness of our Enemies, and the Justice of our Cause, we shall close this
Narrative with the Articles which Philip Sachem of Paukamaket, or Mount-hope,
