ANAGRAM Of his EXCELLENCY the Lord General GEORGE MONCK, KING COME ORE.
YOu Divine Cabalists who raise your Fame,
By your expounding every Word and Name;
See here is a Name, makes all the World to Ring!
GEORGE MONCK interpreted, is COME ORE KING.
COME ORE KING CHARLES, receive Your triple Crown,
I Will give You them, yet give You but Your own
Says the most Loyal and most prudent Knight,
That virtue ever taught: for his delight
Is to teach all, Justice and Loyalty,
That his unparalled example see.
The Fleets and Flocks, meeting on Seas and Shore,
Extol GEORGE MONCK that caused the KING COME ORE;
His Name foretold what now himself has done
By bringing in the lawful Heir and Son
Of CHARLES the first, undoubted successor;
To Brutus, Fergus and the Conqueror;
When Statesmen heard we would the King restore,
They asked who durst do it? we said KING COME ORE*
He signed a blanck, and sent it to the KING,
Our MONARCH asked no more, but ORE did bring
His Loyal Royal Train big with content
T'imbrace GEORGE MONCK, and's true Free-Parliament*
Vive GEORGE MONCK, for since the KING came ore
We reap those Joys, we sowed in Tears before;
Propitious Heaven's the STUARTS long preserve,
And MONCKS as long our gracious Kings to serve.
W. DRUMMOND, Gent.
