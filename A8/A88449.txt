A Common Council holden in the Chamber of the Guild Hall of the City of
London the eleventh day of September in the year of our Lord 1655.
An Act of Common Council for the better avoiding and prevention of Annoyances
within the City of LONDON, and Liberties of the same, and for the preservation
of the same from all manner of Filth and filthy Stenches and unwholesome Smells.
FOrasmuch as it is found by daily experience, That notwithstanding many good
Laws, Orders, and Ordinances heretofore made for amoving and preventing of
annoyances and abuses by Dust, Dirt, and Soil, Filth, noisome Stenches and
Smells within the Streets, Lanes, and other places of this City and Liberties
thereof; yet through the great unskilfulnesse, ignorance, and negligence of the
Officers called Scavingers, and their Substitutes, principally occasioned by
the yearly renewing and change of the persons, and the many particularities
and divisions of them and their powers and authorities restrained and limited
into, and unto every Parish and Precinct; the Streets, Lanes, and Alleyes of
the said City, and Liberties thereof, are continually much pestered and made
extreme offensive to the Inhabitants and Passengers, with ashes, dust, dirt,
rubbish and filth, and with noisome and unwholesome smells, the Common Sewers and
passages for Water are choked up, and the River of Thames made daily less
Navigable by the Seacole-Ashes and other Soil washed out of the Streets. For
the prevention and hinderance of all which annoyances, and preservation of the
said City and Liberties thereof, in all possible cleanness and wholsomnesse,
an expedient and fit means has been contrived and propounded by John Lanyon
Esquire, which having been thoroughly and duly considered of, and judged most
advantageous, and conducing to that end, is allowed and approved of: And the
said John Lanyon has undertaken the execution and performance thereof. For the
better effecting whereof, Be it Enacted by this Common Council, That the
