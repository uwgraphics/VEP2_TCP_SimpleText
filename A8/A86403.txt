The History of the Second Death OF THE RUMP.
To the Tune of, The Parliament sat as snugg as a Cat.
I.
COme buy my fine Dity
Of News from the City,
As it was told in Devonshire;
The Pimp that wipes weekly
Your Breech Politickly
Sells not so much Truth in a Quire.
II.
Tom Kings-man, near undone
With long stay in London,
Last week to the Country did gallop,
Where he took Cavaliers
With his News by the ears,
As they did the Pot to drink all-up.
III.
Quoth he. I once went
To the late Parliament,
Whose Members (when I had seen 'em)
Made me think of a Rat,
That was caught by a Cat,
And eat up to the Tail, that is venom.
IV.
But yet to the stump
Of that Poisonous Rump,
The Old Mouth, did soder in season;
And when that was done,
Like a Lay-Elder Gun,
It stunk at both ends of High Treason.
V.
The Monster did come
Of mere Mouth and Bum,
Most cunningly thus compacted,
That if questioned it were,
For Mischief done there,
It might swear, 'twas by No Body acted.
VI.
OF the Nature and name
Of each Member that came,
Should I give a full relation,
You Would guess by the stink,
That I raked in the Sink,
And Common-shore of the whole Nation.
VII.
Religious you might
Find all there, but the right;
For through the same Sieve they ran,
Which Noll used before
To sift the House 'ore,
Till nothing was left but the Bran.
VIII.
But of those they had,
Division being made
By Fortune's hand (which is uncertain)
Some Members got many,
Some few, some not any,
As Nevil complained, and Martin.
IX.
Indeed from Usurpers
They freed us, and our -- Purse,
And praise of Thanks had been their hire,
For taking us than
Out of the Drying Pan,
Had they not cast us into the fire.
X.
From Cromwell they voted
A Tyrant, though rotted,
Cause when they first footed their Game,
He Would not let 'em tarry
To prey on the Quarry,
But gorged himself on the same.
XI.
And King Oli-ver's Sons,
(Like Prince-playing Whore-sons,
That on too high parts had ventured)
They stripped with a hiss
Of their State-Properties,
And exeunt two Fools as they entered.
XII.
What else they do,
By our Purses we knew,
As well as that scribbling Knave Nedham;
Some good Laws they un-did,
And some bad they founded,
And shortened our Chain for our Freedom.
XIII.
To quell this fierce Monster,
A Knight did anon-stir,
Who wanted Arms; yet from a Wagon
OF though Pope's he would take none,
But from Prester-John,
And so St. George fell by the Dragon.
XIV.
Then Lambert's Wife chid him,
And (like Cromwell) bid him
Confound it, and mount the Throne royal,
Your Weapon's as long
Quoth she and as strong,
My self of 'em both have made trial.
XV.
He find's the Anabaptist,
For his purpose aptist,
And treds the steps of Knipper Dolin,
He fasts, and he prays,
In The new canting phrase,
As if heaven were taken with drolling.
XVI.
Some Packs he inveagles,
Of The blood-coated Beagles,
To's party, the Rump-men did so to,
And victuall'd so well,
Th'adjaceut fort Hell,
As if they no other would go to.
XVII.
Little John thus did draw,
Against Robin the Outlaw,
(Good King) to try who should have thy Deer,
And thus for both poisons,
A quarrel did rise once
Betwixt the foul Toad and the Spider.
XVIII.
Bold Lambert advanced,
He picquier'd, and pranced,
And's party with speeches did urge on,
But though he and Morley
Did snarl and look surly,
They cheated the De'il, and the Surgeon.
XIX.
For soon the Red-coat,
(Who Will not fight, but Vote)
When Lambert's side stronger was found,
By (at least) two foot,
And a Trooper to boot,
Did let the Rump fall to the ground.
XX.
And with General Leuthall,
The House they ore went all,
Religion and Laws they never stood on,
But sought still to hold,
Ill got Land and Gold,
Which first made the Old Cause a Good one.
XXI.
So fell the aged sway,
Of five months and a day,
We yet see no heir apparent,
But from scabberd pregnant,
Expect Posthume regnant,
If Midwife Monck kindly take care on it.
XXII.
The Swordmen address to's,
Pleas, and Manifestos,
Which show 'em less honest than crafty,
Whilst a Tyrannous crew,
Our dangers renew,
That Is called a Committee of Safety.
XXIII.
But Fleetwood and Whitlock,
(The Law's cunning Picklock)
With Salloway and Vane, two prime praters,
Loved Treason so well,
That again to it they fell,
And betrayed even their own fellow Traitors.
XXIV.
In's villainy Bradshaw,
Of constancy made show,
For scorning Repentance as fickle,
His life he soon ended,
And to Hell descended,
This of my faith is an Article.
XXV.
Yet Politicus,
(The Deill's Succubus,
To teem for his commendation)
Advizes us all
To mourn, and we shall,
Whilst that Hell-hound yelps in our Nation.
XXVI.
And now Lambert's Cohorts,
And Monk's (which makes woe hearts)
Do seem to contest, but anon,
We ship-wrack't shall be,
When they can agree,
From what Coast the storm shall fall on.
XXVII.
Whilst Buff and Red-coats,
Are sanctified notes,
Of Christ's, and his Gospel's Protectors,
But among themselves solely,
Do they pass for Holy,
As Bessus and's Sword men for Hectors.
XXVIII.
They that heard this story,
First sighed, and were sorry,
To hear to poor England's confusion,
Then drank a full Bowl,
To that Royal soul,
That must settle all in conclusion.
Vivat.
FINIS.
