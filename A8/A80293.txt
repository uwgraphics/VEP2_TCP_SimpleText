To the Reader.
Courteous Reader.
THE great Antiquity of Justices of Peace in this Nation speaks not only the
manifest Vtility, but also the necessity of that weighty office, which has
been established and enlarged by the grave wisdom of our Ancestors by many
succeeding Acts and Ordinances of Parliament, as you may perceive by the
perusal of this ensuing Enchiridion, and although in the former Impressions
thereof, the Reader has been much injured by corrupt Editions, yet in this
present Tract you may be securely confident of very few or no Errors at all, in
regard it has been revised with mature, and elaborate diligence, and therefore
now no such cause of discouragement for the buying of this beneficial
Collection as formerly; you shall find in it also much new matter added,
concerning the said Office.

Affray and Affrayers.
An Affray may be without word or blow: ^s, to be armed with armor or weapon
not ^sually born, Lam. 126.

It is no affray properly unless there be some weapon drawn, or stroke given,
or offered to be given; or some such attempt, Dal. 34.

Constable or other Officer may lay no hands on any intending to make an
affray, till weapon drawn or offer of blow, Dal. 34. Lam. 132. Cro. 146. a.

An affray is in an house, and the doors are shut, the Constable may break into
the house to see the peace kept, Dal. 34.

If the Affrayers fly into another house, in to a Franchise or other County,
the Constable upon fresh suit may pursue them, but cannot meddle out of the
County, but as a private man, Dal. 34.

Affrayer may be commanded by the Constable or other officer to avoid upon pain
of imprisonment: And if the affray be great, they may make proclamation, and
command the parties to prison for a small time, whom he must deliver without
fine, Lamb. 132. Dal. 34.

After an affray, a Justice of Peace may commit the offenders till they find
sureties (if the affray were in his presence;) if out of his presence, he may
send his Warrant, and commit them till they do find sureties. Vide Surety of
the peace.

If a man be dangerously hurt, and the wound mortal, although the Justic^ of
Pea^ may bail the offender, yet it is the safest wa^ to commit him till there
appear some hop^ of recovery, Dal. 35.

If an assault or affray be made upon Justice or Constable, they may defen^
themselves. The Justice may cause them to be arrested, the Constable may commi^
them to the Stocks, and after carry them before a Justice of Peace, Dal. 35.
Vid^ Peace.

An affray is in a corporate Town (which has Justices within it self) while
the Sessions be held there: the Justices of Peace shall not meddle there; but
it is otherwise at the Assizes, Cro. 146. b.

Every private man present at an affray, assault, or battery, may part them,
stay them that come to the affray with weapon, stay the affrayers till the heat
be over, and then deliver them to the Constable; but may not commit them,
unless one of the affrayers be in peril of death. And if he fly into a house,
upon Hue and Cry break open the house, and take him, Dal. 33. Lamb. 131. Cro.
146. a. V^de plus Constable.

Agnus Dei, Crosses, Beads, etc.
If any person to whom any of these, or any other superstitious things from the Sea of Rome or authority thereof be offered. do disclose the name, dwelling, or
place of resort of such offerer or deliverer to any Justice of Peace of the
same Shire, the same Justice must within fourteen days next after declare the
same to some one of the privy Council, ^ pain of Praemunire, 13 El. cap. 2.
Dal. 105. ^^e plus Treason, Misprision, and Praemunire.

Alehouses.
Two Justices, one being of the Quorum, ^ay license one to keep a common
Ale^ouse, taking bond with good surety for ^ood rule to be kept in his house, 5
Ed. 6 cap. 25. And an Alehouse-keeper put down by two such, cannot be allowed
by any other two but in open Sessions, Dal. 29.

Twelve pence is given to the two Justices of Peace, for taking a recognizance
of him that is allowed to keep a Common Alehouse, 5 Ed. 6. cap. 25. Lam. 370.
Condition of a recognizance for an Alehouse, Lam. 354.

He that keeps an Alehouse of his own authority, without license of two
Justices, one being of the Quorum, or after prohibition of two such Justices,
may by two such Justices be committed to prison for three days without bail,
and till he be bound with two sureties to keep none after, Dal. 29. Lam. 354.
Vide Stat. 3 Car. 3. which allows selling of beer and ale in Fairs (though
unlicensed:) As also the punishment of persons unlicensed.

Information of the offense, and recognizance taken by two Justices, one being
of the Quorum, of an Alehouse kept against the Statute of 5 Ed. 6. ca. 25. and
certified by them to the Sessions, is a sufficient conviction without further
trial at the Sessions: and they may assess the fine of 20 shillings without
making process against the offender, Lam. 572.

Information made in Sessions, that an Alehouse-keeper has done an act,
whereby he has forfeited his recognizance, they may award process against him,
to show why he should not forfeit his recognizance. Quaere what process, Lam.
524, 529.

Enquiry whether Alehouse-keepers have forfeited their recognizance, ought to
be at the Quarter Sessions, 5 Ed. 6. 25.

Fines imposed by the Stat. of 5 Ed. 6. cap. 25. concerning Alehouses cannot be
altered by the Justices of Peace 5 Ed. 6. c. 25. Lam. 578.

Justices of Peace must certify the recognizance taken for Alehouses at the
next Quarter Sessions after they are taken, or lose 5 Marks, 5 Ed. 6. cap. 25.

Any directly or indirectly selling Ale or Beer unto any Alehouse-keeper not
licensed, more then for his necessary provision for his household, shall lose
after the rate of 6 shillings 8 pence for every barrel. For the levy and
disposal of the penalty, see Victuals 4 Iac. 4.

Alehouse-keeper or Inn keeper suffering any tippling contrary to the 1 Iac.
cap. 9. 4 Iac. cap. 5. 7 Iac. cap. 10. 21 Iac. cap. 7. forfeiteth 10 shillings,
and every such tipler 3 shillings 4 pence: for not ability of payment, the
Alehouse-keepers, etc. to be committed to the Gaol till the penalty be paid,
which penalty is to be paid within 6 days, or the distress to be sold, 1 Iac.
cap. 9. the tipler to the tocks for four hours, 4 Iac. cap. 5. Dalt. 28. Car. 4.

Justice of Peace has power in those cases ^o minister an oath to witnesses,
wherein ^ath of one. witness is sufficient, 1 Car. cap. 4. ^ Iac. 9. 21 Iac. 7.

The Constables and Churchwardens neg^ecting to levy, or to certify the cause
^hereof by 20 days to the Justice that granted the distress, do forfeit 40
shillings ^n default thereof to be sent to the Gaol till payment be made, 1
Iac. cap. 9. Dal. 28. Cro. 78. a.

Alehouse keepers and Inne-keepers ought to lodge travelers. Quaere how he is
compellable, and see the opinion of Sir James Ley chief Justice at Lent
Assizes, 1622. Dal. 28.

No Inne-holder, Alehouse-keeper, or other Victualler shall be compelled to
sell victuals to others, or to have lodging, except the party first pay ready
money, Dal. 28. Cok. lib. 9. fol. 87. b. Brook, action surle case 76.

Selling of less then a full Ale-quart of best Beer or Ale for 1 d. and of 2
quarts of small for 1 d. upon oath of one witness, the penalty is 20 shillings,
1 Iac. cap. 9. 4 Iac. c. 5. 21 Iac. cap. 7. Dal. 26.

Any tippling in any Inn, Alehouse, or Victualling-house, wheresoever his
habitation be, forfeiteth 3 shillings 4 pence, 21 Iac. cap. 7. Dal. 28.

A feme covert keeps an Alehouse, and sells Ale, etc. without license,
contrary to her husbands will, the husband is punish able, Dal. 30.

The voluntary confession before one Justice of Peace of any offender against
the Statute of 1 Iac. cap. 9. or 4 Iac. cap. 5. i^ sufficient to convince the
party offending. And after confession, the oath of the party confessing is
proof against any other offending at the same time, Dal. 26. 21 Iac. cap. 7.

Alehouse-keepers are disabled to keep Alehouse for three years after;

1. If they suffer tippling, Dal. 31.

2. If they sell not a quart of the best, and two quarts of small Beer or Ale
for a penny, Ib^d.

3. If they be convicted by Indictment at the Assizes, Sessions, or Leet, for
being drunk, 4 Iac. cap. 5. or before one Justice upon oath of one witness, 21
Iac. cap. 7.

4. Continue drinking in another Alehouse, 7 Iac. 10. 4 Iac. 5. Dal. 32. Vide
plus Victuallers confession.

In all these cases, if he be licensed again within three years, such license
is void, and he to be punished as victualling without license. Dal. 32.

If any unlicensed Alehouse-keepers be convicted by the view of any Justice of
the Peace, confession of the offender, or oath of two witnesses, he loses
twenty shillings to the use of the poor of the Parish, to be levied by way of
distress by warrant from the Justice of Peace convicting, and within three

All enditements ought to contain certainty, and therefore five principal
things be requisite in presentiments, Lam. 487.

1. The name, surname, and addition of the party endited. 2. The year, the day,
and place in which the offense was done. 3. The name of the person to whom the
offense was done. 4. The name and value of the thing in which the offense was
committed. 5. The manner of the fact, and the nature of the offense; as the
manner of the treason, murder, felony, or trespass, Lam. 487.

Lam. 488.

An offense done before midnight, must be supposed the day before; if after,
then the day after, Lam. 492.

c. 12. Lam. 493.

The value is to be declared in felony to make it appear petty larceny; in
trespass to aggravate the fault.

is not good, unless they be taken in a Park or a Warren that be liberties, Lam.
469. 497.

15. 24. b. nu. ^ 34. b. nu. 15. Lam. 143.

Who cannot be put out.
The King cannot be disseised, therefore an ^dictment upon the statute 8 H. 6.

Every Justice upon complaint or notice given, ought at the cost of the party
grieved to ^o execution: viz.

1. He must go to the place, Dal. 57. Lam. 147.

2. Take sufficient power of the County, or of the Town, and the Sheriff also
(if need be) ^s well to arrest offenders, as also for remo^ing of the force,
and for conveying them to ^he Goal, Dal. ibid. Lam. ibid.

4. The Justice ought to make a record of ^he force, and either keep it by him
or indent ^, and certify one part either into the Kings ^ench, or to the Clark
of the Peace, and keep ^he other, Dal. ibid.

One Justice of Peace upon his own view of forcible detainer, may record the
some by 15. R. 2. c. 2. Cro. 61. l. nu. 9.

The Justice or Justices recording a force upon his or their view, may not put
the party put out into possession, but must first enquire by a Jury, and the
force being found, put the party outed into possession, Dal. 59.

The record of the Justice is a sufficient conviction of the offender, and is
not traversable, ibid.

5. The Justice ought to commit immediately to the next Goal, those which he
finds continuing the force, until they pay their fine, ibid. and 115. or
forfeit an 100 pounds, ibid.

But such force must be in the presence or view of the Justice.

6. The Justices, or some of them that see the force, are the proper Judges of

Dal. 115. and is to be st^eated into the Exchequer; upon which assessing and
estreating the party is to be delivered, Dal. 58. Lam. 159.

And so upon payment of the fine to the Justice, or recognizance for payment,
Dal. 58. vide Lam. 159.

Quaere, for the Sheriff is accountable for all fines: and Lamb. advises to
refer it over to the Kings Bench, Lam. 159.

Or the Justice may record the force, commit the offenders, and certify the
record to the Justices of Assize, or to the Sessions, and there the offenders
be fined, Dal. 58.

But ought more properly to be assessed by them that record the force, Dal. 91.
and to be of value.

Or the Justice may certify the record into the Kings Bench, refer the fine
thither, Dal. 58. which Lambert thinks the best course* Lam. 159.

The fines must be reasonable, secund ^^ quantitatem and qualitatem delicti,
Lam. 577.

the ^orce was, Da. 58. and that within a month, ^f it be a riot, Dal. 115. One
Justice may en^uire, Dal. 58.

Enquiry may be though the offenders be ^ot present, or though the Justice go
not to ^ee the place where the force is. Dal. 58, Lam^ert 152.

Without enquiry there can be no restitu^on, Dal. 59. Cro. 161. b. 164. a.

Upon enquiry making, the Justice must di^ect his precept to the Sheriff to
summon ^4 of 40 shill. a year land per annum, Dal. ^13. vid. the form, Cro.
132. b. Dal. 400.

If the Sheriff do not duly execute the Justices precept for the returning of
a Jury, he forfeiteth 10. li. 8. H. 6. c. 9. Dal. 58.

Upon default the Justice may award an ^lias and pluries infinite till they
come.

The Sheriff, at the day of the second pre^ept, must return 40 shill. in issues
upon every ^ne, at the third Writ 5 pound, and at every ^ay after the double, 8
H. 6. c. 9.

If any Jurour have not 40 shillings land, ^et the enditement is good for the
King. Quare if there shall be restitution, Lam. 152. Dalton 213.

Returning of smaller issues then the statute, ^indreth not the inquiry, Dal.
ibid. Lam. ibid.

8. Upon enquiry the Justice may make re^itution, wherein the Justice needs
not to ^xamine the title, Dal. 214. Lam. 156.

No restitution before inquisition, ibid Cro. ^61. b. 164. a. Dal. 214.

Homicide.
Homicide is the killing of a man by a man, Dal. 234.

It is no difference whether the slain be ali^n, denison, or English man, if he
lives under ^he Kings protection Lam. 237. Crom. 21. a. nu. ^. Dal. 239.

To kill one attainted of treason, or of felony, ^r outlawed for felony, or
attainted in Pre^unire, is felony, Dal. 239. Cro. 24. a. nu. 39. ^tamford 13.
quaere.

Homicide is either killing himself, felo de ^e, or another.

Felo de se forfeiteth to the King his goods and chattels real and personal,
and his debts ^ue by speciality, Dalt. 240. but no lands, nor ^loud corrupted,
ibid.

His goods are not forfeited till his death, ^bid.

Infant, or non compos-mentis do not forfeit; ^ut a lunatic killing himself
out of his ^unacy, does forfeit his goods, Dal. 240.

Homicide of another is Voluntary, Involuntary.


Voluntary is Murder, vide Murder, Manslaughter.


Manslaughter is when two fight together upon the sudden, without malice
precedent, and one of them does kill the other, Cro. 26 ^. Lam. 248. Dal. 247.

Manslaughter is By chance medly. Se defendendo person. house and goods,



Manslaughter by chance-medly is felony, but may have his clergy, Dal. 247.

The servant fighting in his masters defense, though there were malice in the
master not told to the servant, Lam. 248. so a stranger suddenly taking part,
Lam. 248. it is chancemedly.

Two that were in malice are reconciled, fall out upon a new occasion, and one
is killed; it is manslaughter only, Lam. 250. Dal. 248.

Se defendendo, when one kills another in the necessary defense of himself
or his, thereby to save himself or his possessions or goods, or some other
persons which he is bound to defend from peril, and it is either against a
felon, as murderer or thief, or a loial subject, Lam. 252. Dal. 253.

Against a loial subject, if he be assailed by another man, he must fly so
much as he may till he be let by some wall, ditch, hedge, prease of people,
or other impediment, that his necessity of defense may seem inevitable, and he
shall be committed till the time of his trial, lose his goods, and seek his
pardon, Lam. 253. Dal. 254. It is not material though he strike again, if
before he give any deadly wound he fly to the straight.

A man flies to a wall, and holding out his weapon, the other runs upon it
and is slain, it is se defendendo, and forfeiteth his goods Dal. 274. Cro. 28.
a nu. 7. But if he had fallen on the ground and drawn his knife, and the other
fall on it, and kills himself, he forfeiteth no goods, for he could not fly
and the slain is in a sort felo de se, ibid. P. R. 122. b. ^tam. 1^. a.

Neither is it material though there were former malice, unless he lie in wait
for the other, or agree for the place of fight, or strike ^he first stroke,

Recognizance is taken by discretion or upon suit, the King cannot release or

Whether the good abearing taken upon complaint may be released by any special
person, Quaere Lam. 123. Dal. 197.

Neither the Justice of the Peace, nor the party can discharge a recognizance
of the Peace by the release out of the Sessions; for first the recognizance is
made to the King* and therefore none but the King can release o^ discharge it.
Secondly, the recognizance i^ taken for the parties appearance, and the release
cannot discharge the appearance, Dalt. 180. Brook. Peace 17.

The appearance is requisite notwithstanding any release made; first, for the
safety of the recognizance; secondly, that others may object in open Sessions,
if he have broken the Peace, that he may be indicated thereupon, Dal. 180.

E contra Cro. If the Justice of Peace at the Sessions do certify the release,
by this the obliged is discharged, and shall not be called upon for his
recognizance, nor his default recorded; for the principal cause of the
recognizance was the keeping of the Peace, the which is discharged by the
release which is certified at the Sessions, and then the appearance is but
accessory to the same, and the intent is only that then he should find new
surety if the party will not release; and this is the common usage, Cro. 139.

No restitution is to be made where there was only a possession in law, Lam.

Justices of Peace ought not to award restitution where the indictment is

He may prevent a riot before it be done, or stay it in the doing, and in the
doing may take and imprison the rioters, and bind them to their good behavior,
Dalt. 109. Lam. 181.

A riot being done, Justices of Peace can neither record the riot, nor make

as a trespass against the peace, or upon the statute of Northampton of forcible
entry, Dal. 110. Lam. 181.

Justices of Peace sitting in a judicial place, and seeing a riot, may command

A Justice of Peace not finding the rioters come to the place, may leave his
servants to restrain the rioters when they come, or else arrest them if they
offer to break the peace, Dal. 110. Lam. 181. Br. Peace 7.

What two Justices of Peace may do in a Riot
They ought to send for the Sheriff or Undersheriff, if none of them come,
Dalt. 112. Lam. 327.

under the degree of Barons, upon pain of imprisonment, fine and ransom, Dal.

It is not good to raise the power of the county without certain information

be excused, or without information, if when they come they find one, Dal. 114.
Lam. 315, 316. Cro. 64. b. nu. 49.

3. They shall arrest all such offenders, or cause them to be arrested, and
remove the force, commit to prison the rioters, and take away their weapons,
Dal. 114. Lamb. 316, 317.

And all such as come into the company, if they be present, shall be arrested,
imprisoned, and fined, as it seems, Dal. 115.

Such as they meet coming from the place riotously arraied, they may arrest and
imprison, but cannot record any riot done by them, but after enquiry may fine
them, Dal. 114. Lam. 316. Cro. 63. a. nu. 32.

The Justices see the riot committed, and the rioters escape; they must record
it, and cannot arrest them but upon fresh suit, which record must be sent into
the Kings Bench, that process may come from thence, Dal. 115. Lam. 318.

The Justices may grant a warrant for such as they saw escaping, to be bound to
the good behavior, Dal. 115. Cro. 196. a. nu. 27.

And so they may do upon information, but it is best to do it upon inquiry, and
so to fine them, Dal. 115.

In execution of the said arrest of rioters, the Justices may justify the
beating, wounding, or killing of any the rioters which resist or will not
yield, Dal. 115. Lam. 316. Cro. 62. b. nu. 20. and 158. b.

4. After arrest the Justices, Sheriff or Under sheriff shall record the riot

ought to be formal and certain, as time, place, number, weapons, manner, etc.

If the rioters make a riot upon the Justices, they may record it also, Dal.

Justices record a riot, and upon examination it appears no riot, or saw it
not, or there was no riot, yet the parties are concluded, Dal. 116. Cro. 63. a.
nu. 33, 65. a. nu. 56, 130. a. Lam. 317.

5. The Justices are presently to commit rioters to the goal, and the power of
the county ought to be aiding to the Sheriff or Undersheriff, Dal. 116, 117.

None may commit the rioters but the Justices who had the view, Dal. 116.

If the Justices and Sheriff or Undersheriff commit to prison the offenders,
and do not record the riot, every one of them loses 100 pound, or do record
the riot, and do not commit the offenders, Dal. 117. Cro. 61. ^. nu. 10.

6. The said Justices and none other shall assess the fine upon the offenders,
which by the statute of 1 H. 5. c. 8. ought to be of good value, that thereout
the charges of the Justices and other officers may be born, yet must it be
reasonable and just, Dal. 116. Lam. ^17. Cro. 161. a. nu. 45.

The fines must be imposed upon every offender severally, Dal. 117. Co. lib.
11. 43, 44.

The fine must be estreated into the Exche^uer, Dal. 117 and then to deliver
the offen^er as it seems, ibid.

The Justices, as it seems, may out of the ^ines pay the charges of the said
Justices, and of the Jury who made the enquiry, for their diet, and the
Sheriffs fees; and the Ju^ices Cla^k who makes up the record, may ^ave his
fees out of that money, or rather ^ay take of every offender 12 pence when ^hey
pay their fines, Dal. 119.

Or the Justices may record the riot, commit the offender, and after certify
the recordto the Assizes, Sessions, or Kings Bench, Dal. 11^.

The record may be delivered at the Sessions to the Clark of the Peace,
together with the residue of the money remaining of the fine, Dal. 119.

rioters gone before their coming, two Justices at least within one month next
after must enquire thereof by a Jury returned by the Sheriff, and record the
riot being found, which is to remain with one of the said Justices, Dal. 117.
Lam. 321.

The form of such enquiry, vide Dal. 402. Lam. 329.

Enquiry shall not be unless the rioters be gone, Dal. 117.

It is not necessary that one of the Justices of Peace be of the Quorum, Dal.
118. Cro. 62. b. nu. 25.

The enquiry may be made at any time after the month; but if it be not within
the month, the Justices are in danger to lose 100 pound: yet if the Jury be
charged within the month, and have day after to give up the verdict, the
statute is not broken, Dal. 118. Lam. 322.

At the enquiry the Sheriff or Under-sherif must be present, but then as
Ministers only, Dal. 118. Lam. 321.

The Justices assemble to enquire within the month, the parties agree, and the
Justices dismiss there upon the Jury, the Justices shall be fined, though none
will solicit the Inquest, or give evidence to the Jury; for the Justices ought
to proceed ex officio, seeing some of the Jury may have knowledge of the riot,
and they ought to make proclamation if any will give evidence, Dal. 118. Lam.
322.

If at the parties request the Justices dismiss the Jury without enquiry, they
are sineable in the Star Chamber to the King, Dal. 118. P. R. 29.

The Justices may bind to the good behavior the parties complaining of the
riot, who caused them to meet, and will not prosecute for the King, but have
agreed it, Dalton 118.

Though the Justices go not to see the riot, yet they may enquire within a
month after, Lam. 321.

8. After enquiry had and the riot found, the Justices have power to hear and
determine the same, (viz.) First to make out process against the offenders
under their own test. Secondly, to assess the fine. Thirdly, to commit till
they have paid the fine. Fourthly, to deliver them after payment of their fine,
or sareties taken by recognizance, or otherwise they may receive their
traverse, if the matter will serve, and dismiss them, Dal. 119. Lam. 323. Br.

But the Justices should send such Indictment or inquisition to the next
Quarter Sessions, or into the Kings Bench together, with the said traverse,
there to be tried, P. R. 30. Dal, 119.

9. If the riot upon enquiry cannot be found, the Justices and Sheriff must

fact and circumstance, with the names of the offenders sub poena, Dal. 120.

Though two Justices with the Sheriff see the riot, yet two other Justices may
make the enquiry, and they all together, or the first two, or last two, with
the Sheriff or Undersheriff, may make the certificate, Dal. 121. Lam. 325.

Where the several certificates be made, or certificate and enquiry do
disagree, the best for the King shall be preferred, Dal. 121. Lam. 325.

If the Jury find but some guilty, the Justices may certify the rest, Dal.

The Sessions of the peace is an assembly of any two or more Justices of Peace,
one being of the Quorum, at a certain day and place within the limits of their
Commission, appointed to enquire by a Jury or otherwise to take knowledge, and
thereupon to hear and determine according to their power of causes within the
Commission and statute referred to their charge, Lam. 378.

Sessions held without summons are good, but then none shall lose any thing for
default of appearing, Lam. 380, 381.

Summons of the Sessions is usually by precept written to the Sheriff, and by
him to be returned at the Sessions, Lam. 381.

Precept for summoning the Sessions may be mad-by any two Justices of Peace,
one being of the Quor. but not the Custos Rotulorum alone; and summons cannot
be discharged by Supersedeas of all the other Justices, but by Supersedeas out
of the Chancery, Lam. 382, 383.

Sessions held by one Justice of Peace is not good, although it were summoned
by two and styled by their names; but by two sufficient Justices it is good,
though it be styled by the name of three, Lam. 383.

Quarter Sessions are to be held four time in the year, (v. z.) the first week

third, between the Feasts of Pentecost and St. John Baptist: the fourth within
the Octaves of St. Michael, 36 Ed. 3. c. 12. Cro. 123. b. nu. 16.

Where Crompton notes, that by 12 R. 2. c. 10. it is ordained that the Quarter
Sessions should be held every quarter of a year at the least, and three days
if need be; by which it appears that the usual day is not of necessity, so it
be kept within a quarter of a year, Cro. ibid.

By the statute 2 H. 5. c. 4. Justices of Peace shall keep their Sessions four
times in the year, viz. in the first week after S. Michael, in the first week
after the Epiphany, in the first week post claus. Paschae, and in the first
week after the Translation of St. Thomas the Martyr, which is the 7 of July,
and oftener if need be, Cro. 123. b. nu. 17.

Cro. 123. b. nu. 18. says, that upon the stat. of 17 R. 2. c. 9. (which
permits to keep Sessions so often as is expedient,) in Kent they keep their
Sessions at other times then the times appointed by 2 H. 5. c. 4. and that it
is good.

The place where the Sessions are to be holden is a^b^trable, and therefore
though by summons they be to be kept in one place, yet they may be kept in
another; but then there can be no amerciament for default of appearance, Lam.
383, 384.

Two Sessions at one time for one County law^ully summoned at two places, both

The Justices of Peace if need require, may keep a special Sessions by virtue
of their commission, or by the statute 2 H. 5. c. 4. Lam. 623.

Summons of a special Sessions is for the most part for some special enquiry,
and not to the general service of the commission, Lam. 623.

All matters within the commission or statute may at a special Sessions of the
Peace be given in charge, yet they are at liberty to give in charge either all
or any of them, Lam. 623, 624.

If two Justices of the Peace, one being of ^he Quorum, make a precept to the
Sheriff for the holding a Sessions at such a place and day, and to return a
Jury before them, other Justices cannot by their Supersedeas to the Sheriff
inhibit him, Cro. 122. b. but the King by his writ of Supersedeas may discharge
it, ibid.

A man is bound to appear before a Justice of Peace within forty days after,
in the mean time a general Sessions is kept, he ought to appear before the
Justices at the Sessions, Cro. 123. a. nu. 8.

A Justice commands one on pain of 10 li. by his precept to appear at the next
Sessions, and he does not, no Scire facias shall go against him more then upon
a Sub poena, but it seems he may be attached upon a contempt, Cro. 123. a.

complaint and examination of the matter upon oath shall be freed from any
arrest upon Original process, Lam. 402. Cro. 190. b.

Supersedeas.
Supersedeas is sufficient, though it neither name the sureties, nor contain
the sum wherein they are bound; but it is better if it do both, Lam. 96. Dal.
172.

Supersedeas delivered to the officer, if he ^rge new sureties, the party may
refuse; and if he be committed, he may have his actio^* Lam. 99. Dal. 172.

Supersedeas out of the Chancery will discharge surety of the P. in the Kings

Peace; and an attachment lies against him if he surcease not, and he may be
imprisoned and fined for it, Lam. 99. Dal. 172, 173.

Supersedeas received by a Justice of Peace out of an higher Court, he should
forbear to make any warrant, or if one be made, to send out his Supersedeas to
the Sheriff, or other officer, to desist to put it in execution, Lam. 99. Dal.
172.

Supersedeas out of the Chancery is to be certified at the next Sessions,

that he has found surety in the Chancery only unto a certain day, which day
is after those Sessions, if the Supersedeas come to his hands after his
Recognizance taken Dal. 173. Lam. 113. for peradventure the recognizance was
broken before the Supersedeas purchased.

Supersedeas for the good abearing, quaere if it may be granted by a Justice of
Peace, Lam. 123. Dalt. affirms it, 197.

A Supersedeas made by a Justice of Peace, and returned under his seal, is a
sufficient record to prove a recognizance taken for the Peace, and warrant to
call the party bound, and if he make default, to record the same, Lam. 97.

If a Justice of P. will by a Supersedeas discharge a Precept for the Peace
awarded by another by virtue of his office, and not by ^upplicavit, the
recognizance would be taken according to the form of the Precept, Lam. 96. Dal.

Certiorari to remove a record is in it self a ^upersedeas to the Justices,
yet the party may ^ave a Supersedeas to the Sheriff that he arrest ^im not upon
the Justices record, Lam. 515.

Supersedeas, to stay ^roceeding upon the record, quaere Lam. ibid.

An Exigent awarded against one indicted of ^ trespass before the Justices of
Peace, may be ^ayed by Supersedeas out of the Chancery, upon surety found there
to appear at the day ^ the Writ, though he be taken upon it, Lam. 526, 527.

Yet Dal. and Cro. say, by one Justice of P. Dal. 319. Cro. 234. a.

If a Supersedeas be directed to the Justices of Peace and Sheriff, the Justice
to whose hands ^t shall be delivered, may keep it, and deliver ^he label to the
party, Dal. 173.

Supersedeas granted for the Peace, or good ^ehaviour, out of the Chancery or
K. Bench, ^s void, unless it be upon motion in open Court, and upon sureties of
five pounds in ^ands, or ten pounds in goods in subsidy, and unless it appear
to the Court that such process of P. or good behavior is prosecuted against
the desirer of such Supersedeas bona fide by some grieved in that Court out of
which the Supersedeas is desired, 21 Jac. ^* 8. Dal. 174.

party appeare^ and prayed allowance, etc.

Supplicavit.
He only to whom the Writ of Supplicav^^ is delivered, must execute it, Dal.
186.

The Justice that receives the Writ, man make the warrant to the Constable or
other party indifferent; and if he refuse to find^ sureties, to carry him to
prison, Dal. 186.

The party attached can be bound only ^^ fore him that sent out the Warrant,

The Justice is to execute the Supplicavit a^ it directs, Dal. 187.

If the sums be left to discretion, it is safe t^ take good sums, Dal. ibid.

After sureties taken, the Just. may make him a Supersedeas, Dal. 187.

The Justice needs not return the Supplicavit, nor make certificate, until a
Certiorarid^ come to him, Lam. 109. Dal. 190.

Supremacy.
To refuse the oath of supremacy, the fir^^ offense is Praemunire, the second
Treason, ^^ Eliz. cap. 1.

Surety of the P. is the acknowledgement of a recognizance to the King (taken
by a competent Judge of record) for the keeping of the Peace, Dal. 161. Lam. 75.

How the surety of the Peace is to be commanded and executed.
A Justice of Peace may command the Peace by word writing.


By word.
The party being present in the presence ^^ the Justice of Peace, threatens
another, o^ makes an assault or affray upon another, o^ does any other act
tending to the breach o^ the Peace, Dal. 169. Cro. 138. b. nu. 8. La^ 84, 85.

One demands the surety of the Peace being present, and takes his oath he is
affrayed, etc. the Justice may command the other to find surety, Dal. 169. Cro.
138. Lam* ibid.

The Justice in such cases may command the Constable or other known officer, or
his own servant being present, to arrest such party to find surety of the
Peace, and may commit to the Goal such party refusing to find surety, Dal. Cro.
Lam. ibid.

By writing.
The Justice by precept or warrant in writing under his seal directed to some
known officer, or other indifferent person, containing the cause and at whose
suit, to the end the parties may provide the sureties, and take them with them,
Lam. 87. Dal. 170.

The Justice may make his warrant to bring the party before him, but the usual
manner is ^o bring the party before the same Justice, ^r some of the Justices
of the County, Dal. ^^0.

Who may serve the Warrant, vide Warrant.
The Constable is first to acquaint the party with the matter in the Warrant;
and if he refuse to go before the Justice to find sureties, he may arrest him
and carry him to the Goal, without carrying him to the Justice, Lam. 90. Dal.
170. Br. Faux Impris. 18.

If the party yield to find surety, the officer is not bound to go up and down
with him, but may keep him until he can procure sureties to come to him; if
afterward he make resistance, or offer to go away, he may by his warrant carry
him to the Goal, and set him in the stocks till he can get aid to convey him to
the Goal, Dal. 170. Lam. 92.

The arrest is not justifiable except the Officer do carry him to the Goal that
refuses to find sureties, Cro. 171. b. Dal. 171.

The party may go before any other Justice (if the warrant proceed ex officio)
to offer the sureties, but cannot force the Officers to travel out of the
division where they dwell. Nay it is at the election of the officer to carry
the party to any other Justice, rather then to give the election to the
delinquent, Dal. 171. Lam. 94.

The party coming before the Justice is to offer his sureties, or else the
Justice is to commit him, for the Justice needs not to demand them, Dal. 171.

If the party refuse before the Justice of Peace to find sureties, the Officer
by the first Warrant may commit him, Dal. 171. Lam. 92*

The Officer is fineable if he arrest the party, and do not carry him before a
Justice of Peace, if he be willing to find sureties; secondly, if upon refusal
they arrest him, and do not carry him to the Goal, Dal. 171.

The party being imprisoned, the Justice of Peace may make him his L^berate;
first, if the complainant die; secondly, if he do enter surety of the Peace,
Dal. 171.

If the imprisoned have a suit depending in the common Pleas, by some opinions,
the imprisoned may be discharged by a Writ of privilege. Quaere tamen, Dal.

A sworn and known officer needs not to show his Warrant, but the servant of
the Justice must show it if it be required, Lam. 89. Dal. 340.

If Husband and Wife be bound to appear, and in the mean time to keep the
Peace, and the Husband only appears, the recognizance is not forfeited, Dal.

Suspicion and sus^ects of felony.
A suspect of felony ought not to be arrested by a Warrant from a Justice of
Peace, unless he be indicted before: for if the Bailiff which serves the
Warrant does suspect him, he may do it of himself without a Warrant; and
without suspicion the Justices Warrant is no Warrant, Lam. 188. Dal. 339. Cro.

Suspicion only without felony committed, is no cause to arrest another, Cro.

A felony being committed, every man may arrest suspicious persons that be of
evil fame, etc. and if such person make resistance, the other may justify to
beat him, Dal. 345.

The Constable or other person that arresteth one for felony or suspicion, must
himself suspect, Dal. 311, 345. Cro. 99. b. nu. 43.

In an arrest for suspicion of felony, the party that causes the arrest must
suspect him, and also show some cause of supicion: otherwise every man may
arrest another for felony done, Cro. 99. b. nu. 44. Dal. 311, 312. where he
makes a quaere.

Swans.
Taking away from his own or another man's grounds Swans eggs of another man's,
upon conviction and examination of witnesses is imprisonment for a year and
day, and loss of ten pound, Lam. 446.

To steal Swans unmarked, if they be domi^i, and kept in a man's manor or
private rivers, is felony, Dal. 267.

Swearing.
He that swears or curses, being convicted by hearing of any Justice of the
Peace, or by oath of two witnesses, or confession of the party before a Justice
of Peace, loses 12 perce to the poor, where the offense shall be committed, to
be levied by distress, the offense being proved within twenty days; or for
default of a distress to be set in the stocks three hours, 21 Jac. c. 20. and 3
Car. c. 4.

The Warrant for distress is to be made to the Constable, Churchwardens, and
Overseers of that parish where the offense is committed, 21 Jac. c. 20.

The offender being under twelve years of age, and not forthwith paying his
twelve pence, by warrant of a Justice of Peace, or head-officer, is to be
whipped by the Constable, or by the parent or master in his presence, ibid.

Testimonial.
Testimonial under the hand of one Justice of Peace sealed, is sufficient to
pass in haytime and harvest time from one County to another, Lam. 190.

In all testimonials and passports some assured marks of the party, by which he
may infallibly be distinguished and known from others, are fit to be specified,
Lam. 206.

Testimonial for a serving-man turned from his masters service, or whose master
is dead, ought to be made by two Justices of Peace, 27 E^. cap. 11. Lam. 331.

Theft.
Theft is a fraudulent and felonious taking of another man's personal goods, in
the absence of the owner, and without his knowledge, Lam. 272. Dal. 262.

Theft is either Grand-larceny, or Petty, larceny.

Grand-larceny is when goods stolen are above 12 pence, and it is felony of
death, except the party be saved by his book, Dal. 263.

Yet if the goods be of more value, and the Jury find it did not exceed 12
pence, it is not Grand-larceny, Dal. ibid.

Petty larceny is if the goods do not exceed 12 pence, and is not felony of
death, but imprisonment for some time, or whipping, or some other punishment by
the discretion of the Justices before whom the party is arraigned, Dal. ibid.

For petty-larceny, the Justice of Peace before whom the offender shall be
brought is not to punish him, but either to send him to the house of
correction, or to bail him, Dal. ibid.

Petty-larceny is forfeiture of goods and chattels.

Six pence, four pence, and three pence, being taken by one at several times
from one and the same person, may be put together in one indictment, Dal. 263
Lam. 273 Stam. 24.

If two or more steal above 12 pence from one, it is felony of death in every
one, Dal. ibid. Lam. 273.

The manner.
To make an act larceny, there must be first a taking, secondly, a carrying
away, Lam. 277. Dal. 263.

Yet it may be felony though the offender came to it by the delivery of the
owner, Lam. 278. As,

Resolutions of the Judges of Assizes, 1633.
1. Question.
WHether the Churchwardens and Overseers of the poor of a Parish with assent of
two Justices of the Peace, one being of the Quorum, may by the Statute of 43
Eliz. cap. 2. or any Law enforce a Parishioner of the same Parish, to take a
child of a poor Parishioner of the same Parish, who is not able to keep his
said child, to be an apprentice?

Resol. The Statute of 43 of Elizabeth, which faith, that the Churchwardens and
Overseers of the Parish shall put out children to be apprentices, necessarily
implies, that such as are sit must receive Apprentices, and the putting out of
poor children to be Apprentices is one of the best ways for the providing for
the poor.

2 Q.
If they may, then whether they must not give money with him, and who shall
determine what money shall be given with him, if the party that is to take such
an Apprentice, and the Churchwardens, and Overseers cannot agree thereupon?

Resol. There is no necessity that money must be given, but that must be left
to the discretion of the Churchwardens and Overseers, all circumstances of age
and ability being considered, and if they cannot agree with the party, then the
Justices of Peace near adjoining: or in their default the Sessions of Peace are
to determine these Controversies.

3 Q.
Whether a Knight, Gentleman, Clergy man, or Yeoman, or one that is Sojourner,
using husbandry, clothing, or grasing, or the like, may be enforced to take
such an Apprentice?

Resol. Every man who is by calling or profession or manner of living, that
entertaineth, and must have the use of other servants of the like quality, must
entertain such apprentices, wherein discretion must be given upon due
consideration of circumstances.

4 Q.
Whether a wealthy man keeping few or no servants, not wanting a servant, but
living privately may be enforced to take such an apprentice; if not, then
whether he may be taxed toward the putting forth of such an apprentice?

Resol. For the receiving of such apprentices, the answer may be referred to
the question next before; but out of doubt every such person must contribute to
the charge, as to other charges for the provision for the poor.

5 Q.
Whether they may enforce a Parishioner that is of one Parish, to take such a
child apprentice, that is of another Parish, but within the same County, or
division, if the proper Parish be not able to provide for the children of the
same Parish?

Resol. The Justices may provide Masters for them in other Parishes within the
same Hundred; if the same Hundred be not able, then out of that Hundred in the
rest of that County, as for other provision for the poor, which must be at a
Quarter Sessions.

6 Q.
If such a Parishioner may be enforced to take such an apprentice, and shall
refuse not only to take such an apprentice, but also refuse to be bound to
appear at the next Qu. Sessions, or Assizes, what shall be done to him?

Resol. If any refuse; let such a one be bound over to the next Sessions or
Assizes; if he refuse to give such bond, let him be sent to the Gaol, there to
remain until he will give such bond.

7 Q.
If such a Parishioner who refuses to take such an apprentice shall be bound
over to the Sessions for not taking such an apprentice, and when he appears
there, shall likewise refuse, what shall be done to him, and what shall be done
to the parents who refuse to suffer their children to be put out to be
apprentices, themselves not being able to maintain them?

Resol. If at the Sessions or Assizes such a one refuses to take an
apprentice, and his excuse be not allowed, it is fit he be bound to the good
behavior, and it will be a good course to indict such a refuser for a
contempt, and thereupon to fine and imprison him, if he refuse to be bound to
the good behavior, let him be imprisoned until he will; and the Kings books of
orders directs that such be bound with good sureties to appear at the
Councel-board; and if the Parents of such poor children refuse to suffer their
children to be bound apprentices, or being bound, entice them away, themselves
not being able to maintain them, let them be committed to the house of
correction.

8 Q.
Whether it be in the power of any general Quarter Sessions to mitigate any
penalty upon a Statute law; if the party indicted shall submit himself to the
fine of the Court, and wave the traverse?

Resol. If the party be convicted or confess the fault, it is not in the power
of the Court to mitigate the fine, in such cases where the Statute makes it
certain: but if the party indicted protesting his innocence, yet quia noluit
plitare cum domino Rege puts himself up into the grace of the Court, the Court
may impose a moderate fine, and order to forbear the prosecution.

9 Q.
If any be bound to appear at the Sessions, and shall tender submission to the
Court, whether the Sessions may stay the indictment, and mitigate the fine
aforesaid upon the confession of the fact?

convicted, or any other Justice of the Peace, may discharge him of all or part
of the Forfeiture or punishment appointed by the Statute?

the Statute appoints the measure of the punishment.

11 Q.
Whether a Constable may upon a warrant for carrying one to the house of
correction for keeping an unlicensed Alehouse upon the second conviction break
open the house wherein the party convicted is, to apprehend him?

year, in one Parish, and there be gotten with child, and then goes from thence
unto another Parish, where she is settled in service by the space of two or
three months, and then discover that she is with child; The question is,
whether she shall be settled in the parish where she was begotten with child, or
in the Parish where she was last settled?

Resol. The place where such a woman was lawfully settled, is the direction in
this case, not where she was begotten with child.

13 Q.

Mistress service, before or after it is discovered that she is with child, and
the reputed father be run away, or is not able to free the Parish: whether the

cap. 5. and not to be removed by Certiorari, unless the party indicted first

Resol. This Statute gives the forfeiture but to one 20 shill. for one Sabbath
day, Although the driving of that day be through diverse Parishes. Therefore
where the action is first attached, and the distress first taken, that Parish
shall have the benefit of the forfeiture and not the other.

maidservant, or brought up in any of the Arts or trades mentioned in the

received from other Parishioners; and what shall be said visible ability?

Resol. The land within each Parish is to be taxed to the charges in the first
place equally and indifferently, but there may be an addition for the personal

discretion, wherein if there be any mistaking, the Sessions, etc. or the

Parish: or whether such as occupy lands in that Parish, and dwell in another

her, whether that Parish shall provide for her till her delivery, if she cannot
provide for her self; and so also if her time be expired before her delivery,
who shall provide for her after her time ended?

Resol. If a woman being with child procure her self to be retained with a
master who knows nothing thereof, it is a good cause to discharge her from
his service. And if she be begotten with child during her service, it is all
one, but the Master in neither case must turn away such a servant of his own
authority. But if her term be ended, or she lawfully discharged, the Master is
not bound to provide for her, but it is a misfortune fallen upon the Parish,
which they must bear, as in other cases of casual impotency.

23 Q.
Whether being delivered of a bastard child in one Parish, and goes into
another with her child; and becomes vagrant, and so is sent to the place of her
birth: her bastard child being under the age of seven years, shall be settled
with the mother, and there maintained if the mother be not able, nor the
reputed father known, found, or whether it shall be sent to the place of its
birth, or being settled with the mother, whether the Parish where it was born
shall be ordered by the two next Justices to pay a weekly sum toward the
maintenance of it?

Resol. The Bastard child must be placed with the mother, so long as it is
within the quality or condition of a Nurs-child, which shall be till seven
years of age; and then it is sit to be sent to the place of its birth to be
provided for, the mother or reputed father not being able. And the Parish where
the child is born shall not be forced to contribute to the charge, as long as
the mother lives, and the child be under seven years old.

24 Q.
A man with his wife and children takes an house in one Parish, for a year; and
before the end of his term is unlawfully put out of possession, and after
takes part of an house as an inmate in another Parish, from whence he is also
put out, and then not being able to get any dwelling, they come to lie in a
Barn in a third Parish where the husband falls sick, and the wife is
delivered of another child, where ought these to be settled?

Resol. If a man of woman having house or habitation in one Parish be thrust
out, this is an illegal unsetling which the Law forbids, for none must be
enforced to turn vagrant, and such one must be returned to the place where he
or she was last lawfully settled, and the child also born in the time of this
distraction.

25 Q.
Whether an apprentice put out by the Churchwardens, etc. according to the
Statute, to a Master in another Parish, if his Master die and leave no Executor
or Administrator fit to keep an apprentice, or able to place him: He shall be
provided for in the Parish where he was apprentice, or shall be sent back to
the Parish from whence he was put out?

Resol. Servants and apprentices are by law settled in that parish, and if they
become impotent there, the Parish must abide the adventure after their term or
time of service be lawfully ended.

26. Q.
What is accounted a lawful settling in a Parish, and what not?

Resol. This is too general a question to receive a perfect answer to every
particular case which may happen: but generally this is to be observed, that
the law unsetleth none who are lawfully settled; nor permits it to be done by
practice, or compulsion, and every one who is settled is a native houshoulder,
sojourner, an apprentice or servant for a month at the least, without a just
complaint made to remove him or her, shall be held to be settled.

27 Q.
A rogue is taken at C. and will not confess the place of his birth; neither
does it appear otherwise but that he confesses the last place of his
habitation to be at S. hereupon he is whipped and sent to S. at his coming to
S. the place of his birth is there known by some to be at W. and thereupon the
rogue confesses it to be so: whether he might without any new vagrancy be sent
to W?

Resol. In this case it is fit to send such a rogue to the place of his birth;
for this is but a mistaking, and no legal settling.

28 Q.
If an indictment be preferred to the grand Jury of the Quarter Sessions of the
P. against one for murder, manslaughter, for robbery, felony, or pety-larceny,
and ignoramus found the reupon, whether the said Sessions may deliver the party
by Proclamation or not?

Resol. Not by Proclamation at all, but for pety-larcenies, and other
pety-felonies, in discretion the Gaol may be delivered of them.

29 Q.
If a Constable be chosen and refuses to take his Oath, what shall be done,
and whether a Constable may make a deputy, and by what means?

Resol. The refusal or neglect to take Oath in such a case is a contempt worthy
of punishment, and thereupon to fine, and imprison him, and the making of a
deputy is rather by toleration, then by law.

30 Q.
If a Constable die or remove out of the Parish where, etc. how is his place to
be supplied?

Resol. By the Lord of the Leet, if that time fall near, otherwise by the
Sessions, but if tha^ be too far off, then by the next Justices.

31 Q.
If a poor weak man be chosen Constable or Tithingman, and be unfit for the
same place, how may he be removed, and a fi^ man sworn in his room?

Resol. The Justices of Peace must help this and if the Lord of the Leet have
power to choose a Constable or Tithingman, and perform so ill, it is a Just
cause to seize his liberty*

32 Q.
If a Nurse-child, a Scholar at a Grammar School, or in the University, prove
to b^ impotent by sickness, lameness, lunacy, or discovery of ideocy, etc. how
such persons shall be disposed?

Resol. A Nurse child, or a Scholar at the Grammar School, or at the
University, o^ persons sent to Common-gaol, Hospital, o^ houses of Correction,
are not to be esteemed as persons to be settled there, no more the^ Travelers
in their Inns, but their settling i^ where their Parents are settled; and
children born in Common-gaols, and houses of Correction, their Parents being
Prisoners, are to be maintained at the charge of the County.

33 Q.
What proportion Parsonages, o^ Tithes shall bear to the taxation of the poor
o^ the Parish?

Resol. The Parson or Vicar presentative, shall according to the reasonable
value of his Par^onage, having consideration to the just de^uctions.

34 Q.
Whether for placing the poor of the Parish, not to be removed by consent of
the Parish, these poor men may not be placed as ^nmates for a time?

Resol. They may by express words of the Statute of the 43 of Elizabeth.

35 Q
If a Parishioner or owner within a Parish, do bring into the Parish without
the ^onsent of the Parish, a stranger of another ^arish, which is, or
apparently is like to be ^urthensome unto the Parish, how they may ^ase
themselves?

Resol. By taking such a one to the charge of he rates of the poor, not only
having respect ^o his ability or the land he occupies, but ac^ording to the
damage and danger he bring^th to the Parish by his folly.

36 Q.
For warding in the daytime for ap^rehending of Rogues, whether the Constable
^ay not enlarge it to a farther time?

Resol. Warding in the daytime is of great ^se, and must be left to the
discretion of the Constables, or direction of the Justices to vary according to
the occasion.

37 Q.
Whether Alehouses ought to be al^owed only in thorofare Towns, and others ^n
other places to be restrained only to sell to ^he poor out of doors.

Resol. The Justices shall do very well to al^ow none but in places very fit
for their scitu^tion and uses, and to moderate the number.

38 Q.
A man for his quality otherwise fit to be a Constable, or of other Office of
tha^ nature, procures himself to be the Kings servant extraordinary, and by
that mean would excuse himself to serve in the Country*

Resol. A servant extraordinary may we^ perform his ordinary service in the
Countr^ according to his quality.

The Justices opinion touching the Commissions by which the Justices sit at
Newgate.
THE Justices at Newgate sit by virtue o^ two Commissions, viz. Jail-deliver,
an^ Oyer and Determiner,

By the Commission of Jail-delivery the^ may try all prisoners in the Goal or
by Bail, o^ such as be indicted will render themselves, generally for all
Felonies: and also for such other offenses as are particularly assigned t^ them
by Statute.

The Statute of 4 Eliz. c. 2. does give the^ power to receive Indictments
against Prisoners or such as are upon bail, and to procee^ to try the same,
viz. Indictments taken before the Justices of the Peace, and by equity thereon
all Indictments before Coroners, 3 Mar. Br^ Commission. omnium 24 says, That
the Commission is ad delibr and. Gaol. de prison. in eisde^ existen. But they
cannot take Indictments a^ Justices of Jail-deliver, but being Justices o^ the
Peace, they may take Indictments against Prisoners, but not against them that
be a^ large: for as much as power is given them consequently they must have
means to do so which is by Indictments. Id quaerend.

Howsoever it is clear, that they may enquire of many offenses, and take
indictments in such cases where power by the Statute is given to the Justices
of Gaol delivery, in such cases where they have authority by Law or Stat. there
the title of Indictments is, that Ad gaolam deliberationem tent. before the
Commissioners of Jail-deliver, I. S. was indicted, and the Record must be made
up so.

And whereas by the Statute of 4 Eliz. c. 2. Indictments taken before Justices
of Peace or Coroners, or any other against any Prisoners, then the entry of the
Indictments is returned taken, Memorand. quod ad generalem Sessionem tent.
before A. B. C. Justices ad pacem in Com. Middlesex or London, I. S. was
indicted, and then tried before Justices of Jail-deliver, and by virtue of the
said Statute, Indictments taken before Justices of the Peace of London, or
Middlesex, are tried before Justices of Jail-deliver.

The Commissioners of Oyer and Terminer is Ad triand. inquirend. audiend. and
determinand. They may enquire all offenses mentioned of in the Commission*
albeit the offenders be at large, but they cannot try Prisoners upon
Indictments taken before any other then themselves, as the Justices of
Jail-deliver may by the aforesaid Statute, unless there be a special
Commission made, as it was in the case of the Earl of Leicester, mentioned in
Plow. Com. for the ordinary Commission of Oyer and Terminer is ad inquirend.
audiend. and determinand. therefore they cannot determine of things, unless
they made enquiry first, and on the otherside also the Justices of Gaol
delivery may try Indictments taken before Justic^ so the P. yet if one be
indicted before Commi^sioners of Oyer and Terminer, the Justices o^
Jail-deliver cannot try the same, because the Records of the Commission of
Oyer an^ Terminer are to be returned in the King Bench, 44 E. 3. 31.

The Commission and the Records of the proceedings before the Justices of
Jail-deliver, are to be returned to the Custo^ Rotulor^ of the County, when
the same persons are Justices of Gaol delivery, and of Oyer and Terminer, they
may sit the same day and place and enquire by the same Jury, but the entry o^
the Records must be several, according as the^ Indictment is.

At the Assizes in the Country, the Justices have their several power as the
Justices of Jail-deliver, Oyer and Terminer, and Justices of Peace.

But when the Records are made up, they must be according to the power they
made election to proceed upon.

This is the regular and legal course. But the Clarks of the Assizes
promiscuously make entry thereof; but if a Writ of Error be brought, they must
certify according to Law, or else it will be erroneous, and so upon a
Certiorari.

The Sessions of London may be begun at the Guild Hall, and then adjourned to
Newgate, If some Indictments be at Guild Hall, then those must be certified: if
others at Newgate: then the adjournment must be mentioned, and that the
Indictment was then taken.

Note that the trial of Indictments taken before Justices of the Peace of
London, cannot be tried at Newgate, as in nature of a trial before Justices of
the Peace at London, for many of the Commissioners for Jail-delivery, are not
Justices of the Peace for London, but in such cases the trial must be before
the Justices of Jail-delivery: as upon Indictments taken before the Justices of
the Peace of London, as in the case of Indictments taken before the Justices of
the Peace of Middlesex.

But if Indictments at Newgate be originally taken before them, as Justices of
Jail-deliver, then it is inquirable how the Jury sworn and impannelled to
enquire at the Sessions of the P. for London or Middlesex, do serve to present
Indictments before the Justices of Jail-deliver at Newgate, unless the custom
and usage will warrant, the two several Juries, sworn at the Sessions of the
Peace for London, or Middlesex, are also by the same Oath and impannelling to
serve for the grand Jury for the Commission of Jail-deliver, and Oyer and
Terminer.

Upon conference with Mr. Keeling, and the Clarks for Newgate of London and
Middlesex, and the Clarks of Assizes, and view of the several Entries, a more
mature and certain resolution may be given, this being in haste, and without
such considerations as were requisite,

Cases and Resolutions upon the Statutes of 18 Eliz. cap. 3. touching
Bastard-children. And upon 43. Eliz. cap. 2. concerning the poor, and provision
for them.
Hammonds Case Mich. 3 Car. Kings Bench.
Bastard. HAmond having got a child, the examination thereof was referred to
the two next Justices according to the Statute: upon which the Justices made an
order, which Hamond refused to perform; thereupon they cause him to enter into
bond to appear at next Sessions, where he appeared, the Justices there made
another order; and because he refused to perform this, they committed him to
prison. Resolved the imprisonment was illegal, being not warranted by the
Statute, but they ought to have proceeded against him upon his bond.

By Hide chief Justice, the Justices ought not to commit for not performing
their order of Quarter Sessions, where they alter the former order made by the
Justices who had first the examination; for by the second order the first was
made null.

Concerning providing for Bastard-children.
Smiths Case Mich. 6. Car. R. B. R.
IT appeared by proof before two Justices that Smyth was the reputed father of
a bastardchild, and the Justices made an order for maintenance of the child,
and for discharge of the Parish according to Law; and afterward committed him
for not performing the order: Resol. the commitment was void, and that the
Justices should have taken bond of him to appear at the next Sessions.

The Case was further:

Sir Henry Pool and Doctor Standard being the two next Justices, did examine
this matter, upon which it then appeared that one Field was the reputed father,
and made their order against Field, that he should maintain the child,
discharge the Parish, and enter into bond for his appearance at the next
Quarter Sessions, and to abide their order there made: He refused to enter into
bond, but appeared at the Sessions, and there showed that Smyth was the reputed
father; the former order was certified, but the Justices did noth^ng upon it,
but granted a new reference unto Doctor Standard and Master Gregory, Ri^ Henry
Pool being gone out of the Country: And they made the last order contrary to
the former; and by this they charged Smyth as the reputed father. Res. that the
Justices at their next quarter. Sessions ought to have made a final order, or
to have affirmed or disallowed the former order. And then afterward have
granted a reference to the same next Justices which made the first order, to
consider better of it, and o^ the proof; and this had been according t^ Law.

Resol. That after an appeal to the Sessions ^ and the Justices there do repeal
the first order, the matter then is as res integra before them; and they may
then grant a referenc^ to the two next Justices.

Note. That the Recognizance thought to b^ in the disjunctive, viz. To perform
the orde^ by them made, or to appear at the next quarter Sessions, and to abide
the order there.

Note. One Justice of Peace by his warran^ may commit, but the Mittimus being
showed and it not pursuing the Statute, and the Recognizance not being in the
disjunctive Smyth was bailed to appear at next Sessions* etc.

Resol. The reference by the Justices at the Sessions, before they had allowed
or disallowed the first order was illegal.

Bower against Panter, Pasch. 8 Car. B. R.
Resol. That upon the Stat. of 18 Eliz. cap. 3* that the Justices of P. at
their Sessions, not the Justices of Assizes have power to meddle with
bastard-children but upon an appeal and settling But this is to be done by the
two next Justices*

At Salop Assizes. 19 Martii 7 Car. 1631.

This question was propounded to Sir W^liam Jones Knight, Justice of Affise, by
a Just. o^ P. viz. upon the stat of Eliz. c. 3. and 7 Jac. c. 4. touching
bastard-children, by the first Stat punishment is inflicted; and by the second,
i^ ^he offend the second time, she is to be sent to the house of Correction,
etc. Upon this, question was; one had a bastard child, but she was not
questioned for it, no proceedings being had against her upon the Statute of 18
Eliz. 3. Afterward she had a second bastard; whether she shall be proceeded
against upon the S^at. of 7 Jac. 4. for the second offense, or whether the
second offense shall not be taken for the first.

Resol. She shall not be punished upon the ^tat. of 7 Jac. as for her second
offense, unless ^he had been before questioned and punished ^or her first
offense; but this second offense shall be now taken to be as her first offense,
and so is to be punished for the same according to Law.

^own of Tewksbury against the town of Twyning at Assizes, 9 Julii 8 Caroli
1632.

A servant maid dwelling in Twyning was got ^ith child, and being near her time
was con^eyed by practice into an out-house in ^wksbury, where the child was
born; after^ard Twyning gave her relief, and the Minister ^f Twyning christened
her child, and as soon as ^e was able to remove, they of Twyning gave (...) and
her child relief for two years; after^ards the mother being sick, they sent her
any with her child to Longden in Com. Wigorn. ^here the mother died: then they
of Longden (...) the child unto Twyning, and they of Twy^^^g sent the child
(being under the age of ^^^ee years) unto T^wksbury, and they sent it ^^ck to
Twyning.

Resol. The child regularly is to be kept ^here it was born, if no practice was
used to ^^ve it born here, but if by practice, then it is ^^ be kept by the
parish where she did dwell, and where she was got with child, and which used
practice to have the child born in another Parish, which is the Parish of
Twyning and so was ordered: referred to the Justices o^ Peace to examine the
practice.

Ad Assizes, 20 Julii 13 Caroli 1637. at Glove'.
Anne Tarling having a bastard-child, upon complaint made thereof to the
Sessions it wa^ refe^red to the next two Justices to examin^ and order; who did
make an order again^ John Wood to be the reputed father, and ordered him to
allow 1 s. 4 d. weekly, and ^ Wood appeals to the Sessions, where the sai^
order was disallowed, and one William Co^ charged to be the reputed father:
Jones Just^ce without examining the cause, confirme^ the last order made at
Sessions, which wa^ final, and no appeal to be admitted against i^

And in a Lincolnsh^re cause one Pridgeon being questioned, and found by two
Justices t^ be the reputed father of a bastard-child, an^ so made an order
against him for allowance^ etc.

Afterward he appeals to the Sessions where the said Pridgeon was discharged,
an^ another was found to be the reputed father and an order made against him.

Afterward at another Sessions of the ^^ upon a re-examination another order
wa^ made against the last order, whereby Pridgeo^ was found again to be the
reputed father, an^ so ordered to maintain the child. Pridgeo^ appeals to the
Judges of the Kings Bench. Resol. that Pridgeon shall be freed from the second
order at Sessions, it being illegal. And the first order made by the
Quarter Sessions upon appeal to them to stand in force, and no appeal to be
admitted against it, the same being final, and not to be altered by the Judges
of Assise. And so it was resolved by the Judges of the Kings Bench.

And so upon the Stat. 43 Eliz. cap. 4. for charitable uses, if the
Commissioners make an order or decree in the Case, and upon appeal to the Lord
Keeper, and exceptions put in, if upon that the decree made by the
Commissioners be confirmed by the Lord Keeper, this decree is by this made to
be final, and no subsequent appeal to be admitted.

Cases concerning provision for poor people.
Reves Case, Mich. 7 Car. R. B. R. Stat. 43 El. c. 2.
Poor. REve was brought to the Bar by Hab. Corp. being committed by the Stat.
of 43 Eliz. cap. 2. for that he being the reputed father of one Ben. Gregory, a
poor child, who was main^ained by the Parish of S. G^les in the Fields, and he
being a man of ability refused to maintain the child, or to find sureties for
his appearance at next Sessions. Reve moved that the comm^tment was illegal,
being grounded upon the said Stat. wherein is this clause, ^^at the Father and
Grandfather, Mother* and Grandmother, the Children and Grandchildren of ^very
poor person not able to work (they being of abil^ty) shall pay such rates, and
in such wise as the Justices of that County where such person dwells, at their
next Quarter Sessions shall assess, upon pain of forfeiting 20 s. per men's.
Wherein there is no such person taken notice of as the reputed father of a
bastard, which is filius populi.

It also appeared that Reve dwelt in Suffolk, and coming to London about
Lawsuits was taken by a warrant of a Just. of P. of Middlesex.

Resol. The granting the warrant was illegal, and all the proceedings in Mid.
coram non Judice

Nor have the Justices any power at their Sessions in Middlesex to make any
order, the party living in another County. And he i^ not to be committed until
an order made, and a refusal to pay the 20 s. a month, and if he refuse this,
then (for want of distress) to be committed, and not before.

By Jones and Croke Justices, it is reasonable that he should contribute to the
maintenance of the child, he being of ability, but this is no^ the way to
compel him. The Justices in Suffolk may make an order in it, and so cause the
money to be sent up.

Draper and Town of Glenfield in Com. Leic'.
At Summer Assizes before Hutton and Crok^ Justices was this Case; A
grandmother being a person of ability had a poor granchild relieved by the said
Parish, the grandmother marries with Draper; the question was, whether Draper
should be taken to be a grandfather within the Statute 43 Eliz. cap. 2. and so
liable to maintain the child.

Resol. That he shall, for that the wife after her marriage had no ability at
all, her estate being a gift in Law to the husband.

By Croke. Where the grandmother was of good ability at the time of the
marriage, it is good reason the husband should be charged, but not otherwise.

Mich. 7 Car. Regis. Gerrards Case.
Gerrard married the grandmother being a poor Widow, but had no means nor
advancement at all by her, the husband also had but small estate; but having
been married 18 or 19 years by industry of the wife are come to be of ability:
and whether he should provide for a poor grand child of his wives was the
Question.

Croke Just. If grandfather and grandmother have no estate they shall not be
charged. Secondly, if the grandmother have no means; and she afterward marry
with one that has, he shall not be charged with keeping this child.

But if the husband have sufficient means with the grandmother in marriage,
there he shall be charged during the life of the grandmother and no longer.

If land descend to the grandmother after marriage, and the husband enjoys it
in her right, here he shall be charged with the child.

When the wife has ability at the time of the marriage he shall be charged,
because by the marriage he has gotten the means which the grandmother had, out
of which the child is to be maintained, and so transit cum onere.

Whitlock Justice. The making the order against the grandfather in this Case
was well, he being become of ability by the industry of his wife. Croke contra.
The Justices dissering in opinion, ordered a trial at Law.

Town of Kimalton against Laystas, 7 Car. at H^reford Assizes 1621. Stat 43
Eliz. cap. 2.
Wind and his Wife dwelt at Laystas five years; and after came into Kimalton,
and did there rent a house for a year, and having children, the Town fearing
they would be chargeable to them, they procure a Justice of P. to charge the
Landlord to warn them out of his house, or put in security to save the Town
harmless: The Landlord put them out at the years end, and let his house to
another.

Wind complains to the Justices, who order, that the Town of Kimalton should
provide a house for him and his wise, paying a yearly rent, or else that the
overseers of the poor do provide for them, which they refuse to do; whereupon
Wind complains to the Judges of Assise.

Resolved by Whitlock Justice, that the order made by the Justices of the P.
was against Law, because that W^nde was neither poor nor impote^t, he being
able to work and had means, and paid his rent: But Wind is to provide for
himself where he can get a house; and he might when he pleased go again to
La^stas, where he formerly lived and had means.

Ad Ass. 19 Martii, 7 Car. Regis 1631. at Salop. Stat. 43. Eliz. cap. 2.
Margaret Brown was begot with child by one G^ugh, the child born in Drayton in
Com. Salop 11 years since, and Gough the reputed father took the child from the
mother, and placed him at nurse elsewhere, and after marries another woman and
dwells with her at S. Chad, the bastard-child dwelt with him; afterward Gough
the reputed father dies, leaving his wife and diverse children, and the said
bastard-child all poor and maintained by the Parish.

The mother of the bastard had been all this while in service, but is a simple
woman, yet able to work, and had 3 l. left by friends, but not yet come into
her hands.

Whether this bastard shall be sent to the Town of Salop where he lived for 10
years, or at Drayton the place of his birth, or to his mother who is not able
to maintain him.

Resol. by Jones and Whitlock Justices, that this bastard-child is to be sent
to his mother to be kept by her if she be able, if she be not, then to the Town
of Salop, in regard he had been there formerly settled with his reputed father,
and because it is the place of last settling, he being there for 10 years, and
the Law respects the place of last settling, as well as place of birth.

At the Assizes, 28 Iulii, 5 Car. 1629. Stat. 34 Eliz. cap. 2.
Dorothy Clavely with a child under the age of 7 years going about as wanderer,
came to Arlee in Com. W. and there desired a Warrant to be conveyed to Egleshal
in Com. S. where the child was born: The Constable of Arlee made her such a
Pass, and delivered her to the Constable of Rippesford, who delivered her to
the Constable of B. in Com. W. where by the way she died; they sent the child
Rippesford, they send it to Arlee, Arlee sent it back to Rippesford.

Whether the Parish where the mother died, or where the child was born was to
keep the child?

Another Case being a wanderer with three children, born in three several
Parishes, came with them unto Dale in the Parish of Sale unto one Burton her
sister, where she died, and left the three children there.

By Jones and Whitlock Justices, etc. That the children ought to be kept and
provided for by the several Parishes where they were born, and not in the
Parish where the mother died in transitu, and was so ordered accordingly,
because the place of birth is a settling of these children in a place certain;
and the wandering of the mother afterward with them does not alter the Case.

Resol. also, that the place of birth, or place of last habitation, if the same
be known, are in judgment of Law said to be the places of settling. So that if
a man be born in one Parish, and afterward is an inhabitant and servant in
another Parish, and after this becomes a wanderer; he is here to be sent to the
place of last settling, to be there kept and provided for.

Note. These children in the two last Cases were sent to the places of their
births as poor, not as wanderers or vagabonds.

Note also, that the Statute of 39 Eliz. 4. for punishing rogues, that the last
Proviso therein shall not extend to children under the age of 7 years, for such
shall not be accounted wanderers within this Statute.

At Lincoln Assizes, 11 Martii 9 Caroli Regis, 1633
Upon complaint by Sir Anthony Irby that the Assessments for the poor by the
Town of Boston and Overseers were unequal.

By Hutton and Croke Justices; such assessments ought to be made according to
the visible estate of inhabitants there both real and personal there, and not
for what estate he has in other Parishes.

He also complained that he had diverse tenants there, and that they taxed both
him and his tenants.

Resolved, they are by stat. 43 Eliz. 2. to assess the occupiers of land, and
not the lessor who receives the rent, the occupier being by law charged to pay
that Sessment.

At Worcester Assizes, 11 Martii 14 Car. Reg. 1638. Stat. 43 Eliz. cap. 2.
Inter Vill. de Suckley, and Vill. de Whitborn.
William Chapel a Creeple born in Whitborn, 20 years since he went from thence
and dwelt in Suckley, and paid rent for a house. And afterward he came to the
Town of Luston, and there continued 20 weeks, and wrought as a labourer in a
Quarrey of stone, and by a fall of a stone his back was broken, and so he was
made impotent, and there was taken as a vagrant wandering and begging; upon this
he was sent to Whitborn where he was born, but they refused to receive him.

By Jones Justice: If he did beg and wander at Luston he is then by the Law to
be sent to Whitborn where he was born, and they ought to provide for him as one
of their poor.

Note. At this time it was also resolved, that if one great with child be sent
to the house of Correction, and there she is delivered, the child shall be sent
to the Parish from whence the the mother came, there be provided for, it being
the place where she was last settled.

Note. It was also resolved that a rogue ought not to be sent to the house of
Correction, but he is to be whipped and sent to the place where he was last
settled, if the same be known, otherwise to the place of his birth.

Now seeing Iustitia est duplex, viz. The punishing part, and the preventing
Justice, the premises only touching the former, therefore the conclusion shall
point something at the latter, with a direction how it may be effected: We find
by experience that it is not frequent punishment that prevents offenses,
praestat cautela quam medela, it is better preventing then redressing offenses.
This preventing Just. consists in three things (according to a learned Author
of our Laws, Co. 3 Inst. Epilogue.)

First in the good education of youth, which ought to be by instruction in the
knowledge of Religion, and by learning some trade in their tender years, so as
their should not be an idle person, or a beggar according to the Scripture,
Deuteronomy. 15. 4. But that every child whose Parents are poor, might at the age of
seven years earn their own living; and this for the time to come would by
preventing Justice avoid idleness in all, which is the mare lethum where so
many souls perish, and by honest trades cause them to become good members in
the Commonwealth.

Secondly, in the execution of good Laws, which are already enough to punish
idleness, but none of sufficient force to set idle people or youth on work.

Thirdly to frequent pardons, which make many offend in hope. This preventing
Justice is better then punishing Just, as obedience is better then sacrifice,
for in sacrifice we do but repent of sin, but in obedience we prevent sin, and
it is better preventing then repenting sin. And therefore worthy every man's
consideration and endeavor to promote this preventing Justice according to
such good Laws as are already in force.

FINIS.
