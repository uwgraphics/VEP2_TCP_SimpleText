THE DECLARATION OF The Lord General, AND His Council of Officers, Showing
the Grounds and Reasons for the Dissolution of the Parliament, April 20. 1653.
The effect and sum of it, as follows.
AFter it had pleased God not only to reduce Ireland, and give in Scotland,
but so marvellously to appear for his people at Worcester, that those Nations
were reduced to a great degree of peace, and England to perfect quiet, and
thereby the Parliament had opportunity to give the people the harvest of all
their labor, blood, and treasure, and to settle a due Liberty both in
reference to civil and spiritual things, whereunto they were obliged by their
duty, their engagements, as also the great and wonderful things which God has
wrought for them; it was matter of much grief to the good and well-affected of
the Land, to observe the little progress which was made therein, who thereupon
applied to the Army, expecting redress by their means: Notwithstanding which,
the Army being unwilling to meddle with the Civil Authority, in matters so
properly appertaining to it, it was agreed, That his Excellency and Officers of
the Army, which were Members of Parliament, should be desired to move the
Parliament, to proceed vigorously in reforming what was amiss in Government,
and to the settling of the Commonwealth, upon a foundation of Justice and
Righteousness; which having done, we hoped that the Parliament would
seasonably have answered our expectation, but finding (to our grief) delays
therein, we renewed our desires in an humble Petition to them, which was
presented in August last: And although, they at that time, signifying their
good acceptance thereof, returned us thanks, and referred the particulars
thereof, to a Commit of the House, yet no considerable effect was produced,
nor any such progress made, as might imply their real intentions to
accomplish what was Petitioned for: But on the contrary, there more and more
appeared amongst them, an aversion to the things themselves, with much
bitterness and opposition to the people of God, and his Spirit acting in them;
which grew so prevalent, that those persons of honor and integrity amongst
them, who had eminently appeared for God and the public good, both before and
throughout this war, were rendered of no further use in Parliament, then by
meeting with a corrupt party to give them countenance to carry on their ends,
and for effecting the desire they had of perpetuating themselves in the Supreme
Government. For which purpose the said party long opposed, and frequently
declared themselves against having a New Representative: And when they saw
themselves necessitated to take that Bill into consideration, they resolved to
make use of it to recruit the House with persons of the same spirit and temper,
thereby to perpetuate their own sitting. Which intention diverse of the most
active amongst them did manifest, laboring to persuade others to a consent
therein: And the better to effect this, diverse Petitions preparing from
several Counties, for the continuance of this Parliament, were encouraged, if
not set on foot by many of them.

For obviating these evils, the Officers of the Army obtained several
meetings with some of the Parliament, to consider what fitting means and remedy
might be applied to prevent the same; but such endeavors proving altogether
ineffectuall, it became most evident to the Army, as they doubt not it is also
to all considering persons, that this Parliament, through the corruption of
some, the jealousy of others, the non-attendance and negligence of many, would
never answer those ends, which God, his people, and the whole Nation expected
from them. But that this Cause which the Lord has so greatly blessed, and bore
witness to, must needs languish under their hands, and by degrees be wholly
lost, and the lives, liberties, and comforts of his people, delivered into
their Enemies hands.

All which being sadly and seriously considered by the honest people of this
Nation, as well as by the Army, and wisdom and direction being sought from the
Lord, it seemed to be a duty incumbent upon us, who had seen so much of the
power and presence of God going along with us, to consider of some more
effectual means to secure the Cause which the good people of this
Commonwealth had been so long engaged in, and to establish righteousness and
peace in these Nations.

And after much debate it was judged necessary, and agreed upon, that the
Supreme Authority should be by the Parliament, devolved upon known persons, men
fearing God, and of approved integrity, and the Government of the Commonwealth
committed unto them for a time, as the most hopeful way to encourage and
countenance all Gods people, reform the Law, and administer justice
impartially, hoping thereby the people might forget Monarchy, and understanding
their true interest in the election of successive Parliaments, may have the
Government settled upon a true Basis, without hazard to this glorious Cause, or
necessitating to keep up Arms for the defense of the same.

And being still resolved to use all means possible to avoid extraordinary
courses, we prevailed with about twenty Members of Parliament, to give us a
Conference, with whom we freely and plainly debated the necessity and justness
of our Proposals, on that behalf: And did evidence that those, and not the Act
under their consideration, would most probably bring forth something answerable
to that work, the foundation whereof, God himself has laid, and is now
carrying on in the world.

The which notwithstanding found no acceptance, but in stead thereof, it was
offered, that the way was to continue still this present Parl. as being that
from which we might reasonably expect all good things. And this being
vehemently insisted upon, did much confirm us in our apprehensions, That not
any love to a Representative, but the making use thereof to recruit, and so to
perpetuate themselves, was their aim.

They being plainly dealt with about this, and told, That neither the Nation,
the honest interest, nor we our selves would be deluded by such dealings, they
did agree to meet again next day in the afternoon for mutual sat is faction,
it being consented to by the Members present, that endeavors should be used,
that nothing in the mean time should be done in Parliament, that might exclude
or frustrate the Proposals before mentioned.

Notwithstanding this, the next morning the Parliament did make more have then
usual in carrying on their said Act, being helped on therein by some of the
persons engaged to us the night before, none of them which were then present
endeavoring to oppose the same; and being ready to put the maine Question for
consummating the said Act, whereby our aforesaid Proposals would have been
rendered void, and the way of bringing them into a fair and full debate in
Parliament, obstructed.

For preventing whereof, and all the sad and evil consequences, which must
upon the grounds before said have ensued, and whereby at one blow the interest
of all honest men, and of this glorious cause, had been endangered to be laid
in the dust, and these Nations imbroyled in new troubles, at a time when our
Enemies abroad are watching all advantages against us, and some of them
actually engaged in War with us, we have been necessitated, though with much
relunctancy, to put an End to this Parliament.

And desire, That all men, as they would not provoke the Lord to their own
destruction, should wait for such issue as he shall bring forth, and to follow
their business with peaceable spirits, wherein we promise them protection by
his assistance.

FINIS.
