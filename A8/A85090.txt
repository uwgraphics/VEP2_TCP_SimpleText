London, Printed for Edw. Husbands, in the Middle Temple. 1644.

A Remonstrance of Grievances Presented to his most Excellent Majesty, in the
behalf of the Catholics of IRELAND.
To the Kings most Excellent Majesty.
MOst gracious Sovereign, We your Majesty's most dutiful, and loyal
subjects, the Catholics of your Highness kingdom of Ireland, being
necessitated to take arms for the preservation of our Religion, the
maintenance of your Majesty's rights and prerogatives, the natural and just
defense of our lives and estates, and the liberties of our country; have often
since the beginning of these troubles attempted to present our humble complaint
unto your Royal view, but were frustrated of our hopes therein, by the power
and vigilance of our adversaries (the now Lords-Iustices and other ministers of
State in this kingdom) who by the assistance of the malignant party in England
now in Arms against your Royal person, with less difficulty to attain the
bad ends they proposed to themselves of extirpating our Religion and Nation,
hither to debarred us of any access to your Majesty's justice, which
occasioned the effusion of much innocent blood and other mischiefs in this
your kingdom, that otherwise might well be prevented. And whereas of late
notice was sent unto us of a Commission granted by your Majesty to the right
honorable the Lord Marquis of Ormond and others, authorizing them to hear what
we shall say, or propound, and the same to transmit unto your Majesty in
writing, which your Majesty's gracious and princely favor, we find to be
accompanied with these words; viz. ( Albeit we do extremely detest the odious
rebellion which the recusants of Ireland have without ground or color raised
against us, our Crown and dignity) which words, we do in all humility conceive
to have proceeded from the misrepresentations of our adversaries; and therefore
do protest, we have been therein maliciously traduced to your Majesty, having
never entertained any rebellious thought against your Majesty, your Crown, or
dignity, but always have been and ever will continue your Majesty's most
faithful and loyal subjects, and do most humbly beseech your Majesty so to
own, and avow us, and as such we present unto your Majesty these ensuing
grievances, and causes of the present distempers.

1 In primis, the Catholics of this kingdom, whom no reward could invite, no
persecution enforce to forsake that Religion professed by them, and their
ancestors for thirteen hundred years or thereabouts, are since the second year
of the reign of Queen Elizabeth made incapable of places of honor, or trust in
Church or Commonwealth, their Nobles become contemptible, their Gentry
debarred from learning in Universities, or public Schools within this
kingdom, their younger brothers put by all manner of employment in their
native country, and necessitated either to live in ignorance and contempt at
home, or (to their great discomfort and impoverishment of the land) to seek
education and fortune abroad; misfortunes made incident to the said Catholics
of Ireland only (their numbers, quality, and loyalty considered) of all the
Nations in Christendom.

2 Secondly, that by this incapacity, which in respect of their Religion was
imposed upon the said Catholics, men of mean condition and quality, for the
most part, were in this kingdom employed in places of greatest honor and trust,
who, being to begin a fortune, built it of the Ruins of the Catholic Natives,
at all times lying open to be discountenanced, and wrought upon, and who
because they would seem to be carfull of the government) did from time to time,
suggest falls and malicious matters against them, the said Catholics, to render
them suspected and odious in England; from which ungrounded informations and
their many other ill Offices, these mischeifs have befallen the Catholics of
Ireland: First the oppositions given to all the graces, and favors of your
Majesty, or your late Royal Father promised or intended to the Natives of this
Kingdom. Secondly, the procuring of false inquisitions upon fained Titles of
their estates against many hundred years possession, and no travers or
petition of Right admitted thereunto, and Jurors denying to find such Offices,
were censured even to their public infamy, and ruin of their estates, the
finding thereof being against their consciences and clear evidences, and
nothing must stand against such offices taken of great and considerable parts
of the Kingdom, but Letters Patent under the great Seal, And if
Letters Patent were produced, (as in most cases they were) none must be
allowed, valid, nor yet sought to be legally avoided: So that of late times by
the underhand working of Sir William Parsons, now one of your Lords-Iustices
here, and the arbitrary illegal power of the two impeached Judges in
Parliament, and others drawn by their advice and counsel, one hundred and
fifty Letters Patent were avoided in one morning, which course continued
until all the Patents of the Kingdom, to a few, were by them and their
associates declared void, such was the care those ministers had of your
Majesty's great Seal, being the public faith of the Kingdom, this way of
service, in show only pretended for your Majesty, proved to your disservice,
and the immoderate and too timely advancement of the said ministers of state,
and their adherents, and too near the utter mine of the said Catholics.

3. That whereas your Majesty's late Royal Father King James, having a
princely and fatherly care of this Kingdom, was graciously pleased to grant
several large and beneficial Commissions under the great Seal of England, and
several instructions and Letters under his privy Signet, for the passing and
securing of the estates of his subjects here by Letters Patents under the great
Seal, and Letters Patents accordingly were thereof passed, fines paid, old
rents increased, and new rents reserved to the Crown, And the said late King
was further graciously pleased, at several times to send diverse honorable
persons of integrity, knowledge and experience, to examine the grievances of
this kingdom, and to settle and establish a course for redress thereof. And
whereas your Majesty was graciously pleased, in the fourth year of your reign,
to vouchsafe a favorable hearing to the grievances presented unto you by
agents from this kingdom, and thereupon, did grant many graces and favors unto
your subjects thereof, for security of their estates, and redresses, or remove
off those heavy pressures under which they have long groaned; which acts of
Justice and grace extended to this people, by your Majesty and your said Royal
Father, did afford them great content, yet such was, and is yet, the immortal
hatred of some of the said Ministers of Sat, and especially of the said Sir
William Parsons, the said impeached Judges and their adherents; to any welfare
and happiness of this Nation, and their ambition, to make themselves still
greater and richer, by the total ruin and extirpation of this people, that
under pretense of your Majesty's service the public faith involved in those
grants was violated, and the grace and goodness intended by two glorious Kings
successively to a faithful people, made unprofitable.

4 The illegal, arbitrary, and unlawful proceedings of the said Sir
William-Parsons, and of the said impeached Judges, and their adherents, and
instruments in the Court of Wards, and the many wilful erroneous decrees, and
Judgments of that Court, by which the heirs of Catholic Noblemen, and other
Catholics were most cruelly and tyranically dealt withal, destroyed in their
estates, and bred in dissolution, and ignorance, their Parents debts
unsatisfied, their Sisters and younger brothers left wholly unprovided for, the
Ancient and appearing Tenures of Mesne Lords unregarded, estates valued in Law,
and made for valuable considerations, avoided against Law, and the whole Land
filled up with the frequent swarms of Escheators, Feodaries, Pursevants, and
others by authority of that Court.

5 The said Catholics notwithstanding the heavy pressures before mentioned,
and other grievances in part represented to your Majesty by the late Committees
of both houses of Parliament of this kingdom, whereunto they humbly desire that
relation be had, and redress obtained therein, did readily and without
reluctation or repyning contribute to all the Subsidies, Loanes, and other
extraordinary grants made to your Majesty in this kingdom, since the beginning
of your Reign, amounting unto well near on Million of pounds, over and above
your Majesty's Revenue, both certain, and casual: And although the said
Catholics were in Parliament, and otherwise the most forward in granting the
said sums, and did bear nine parts of ten in the payments thereof, yet such was
the power of their adversaries, and the advantage they gained by the
opportunity of their continual addresses to your Majesty, to increase their
reputation in getting in of those Moneys, and their authority in the
distribution thereof, to your Majesty's great disservice, that they assumed to
themselves to be procurers thereof, and represented the said Catholics as
obstinate and refractary.

6 The Army raised for your Majesty's service here at the great charge of the
kingdom, was disbanded, by the pressing importunity of the malignant party in
England, not giving way that your Majesty should take advice therein with the
Parliament here, alleging the said Army was Popish, and therefore not to be
trusted: And although the world could witness the unwarrantable, and
unexempled invasion, made by the malignant party of the Parliament in England,
upon your Majesty's Honor, Rights, Prerogatives, and principal Flower of your
Crown, And that the said Sir William Parsons, Sir Adam Loftus Knight, your
Majesty's Vice-Treasurer of this kingdom and other their adherents, did declare
that an Army of ten Thousand Scots was to arrive in this kingdom, to force the
said Catholics to change their Religion, And that Ireland could never do well
without a Rebellion, to the end the remain of the Natives thereof might be
extirpated, and wagers were laid at general Assizes, and public meetings, by
some of them, then, and now employed in places of great profit and trust in
this kingdom, that within one year no Catholic should be left in Ireland, and
that they saw the ancient and unquestionable privileges of the Parliament of
Ireland unjustly, and against Law incroached upon, by the orders, Acts, and
proceedings of both houses of Parliament in England, in sending for, and
questioning to, and in that Parliament, the Members of the Parliament of this
kingdom, sitting the Parliament here, And that by speeches, and orders Printed
by the authority of both houses in England, it was declared; that Ireland was
bound by the Statutes made in England, if named, which is contrary to known
truth, and the Laws here settled, for four hundred years and upwards. And that
the said Catholics were thoroughly informed, of the protestation made by both
houses of Parliament of England, against Catholics, and their intentions to
traduce Laws for the extirpation of Catholic Religion, in the three kingdoms,
and that they had certain notice of the cruel and bloody execution of priests
there, only for being priests, and that your Majesty's mercy and power could
not prevail with them, to save the life of one condemned priest, and that the
Catholics of England, being of their own flesh and blood, must suffer or
depart the Land, and consequently others not of so near a relation to them, if
bound by their Statutes, and within their power. These motives, although very
strong, and powerful, to produce apprehensions and fears in the said
Catholics did not prevail with them to take defensive Arms, much less
offensive, they still expecting that your Majesty in your high wisdom, might be
able in a short time, to apply seasonable cures, and apt remedies unto those
evils and innovations.

7 That the Committees of the Lords and Commons of this Kingdom, having
attended your Majesty for the space of nine Months, your Majesty was
graciously pleased (notwithstanding your then weighty and urgent affairs in
England and Scotland) to receive, and very often with great patience to hear
their grievances, and many debates thereof at large, during which debates, the
said Lords-Iustices, and some of your privy Counsel of this Kingdom and their
adherents, by their malicious and untrue informations conveyed to some
Ministers of state in England (who since are declared of the malignant party)
and by the continual solicitation of others of the said privy Counsel gone to
England of purpose, to cross and give impediment unto the justice and grace
your Majesty was inclined to afford to your subjects of this Realm; did as much
as in them lay, hinder the obtaining of any redress for the said grievances;
and not prevayling therein with your Majesty, as they expected, have by their
Letters and instruments, labored with many leading Members of the Parliament
there, to give stop, and interruption thereunto, and likewise transmitted unto
your Majesty, and some of the state of England, sundry misconstructions, and
misrepresentations of the proceedings and actions of your Parliament of this
your Kingdom, and thereby endeavored to possess your Majesty, of an evil
opinion thereof, and that the said Parliament had no power of Judicature in
Capital causes (which is an essential part of Parliament) thereby aiming at
the impunity of some of them, and others, who were then impeached of high
Treason, and at the destruction of this Parliament. But the said Lords-Iustices
and privy counsel, observing that no art, or practice of theirs, could be
powerful to withdraw your Majesty's grace and good intentions from this
people, and that the redress granted of some principal grievances was to be
passed, as Acts in Parliament; The said Lords Justices, and their adherents,
with the height of malice envying the good union, long before settled, and
continued between the Members of the house of Commons, and their good
correspondency with the Lords, left nothing unattempted, which might raise
discord and disunion in the said house, and by some of themselves, and some
instruments of theirs in the said Commons house, private meetings of great
numbers of the said house were appointed, of purpose, to raise distinction of
Nation, and Religion, by means whereof a faction was made there, which tended
much to the disquiet of the house, and disturbance of your Majesty's, and the
public service. And after certain knowledge that the said Committees were by
the waterside in England with sundry important and beneficial Bills, and other
graces to be passed, as Acts in that Parliament of purpose to prevent the same,
the said faction by the practice of the said Lords-Iustices and some of the
said privy Counsel, and their adherents, in tumultuous, and disorderly manner,
on the seventh of August 1641. and on several days before, cried for an
adjournment of the house, and being overvoted by the voices of the more
moderate part, the said Lords-Iustices and their adherents told several
honorable Peers, that if they did not adjourne the Lords house on that day,
being Saturday, that they would themselves prorogue, or adjourne the Parliament
on the next Monday following; by means whereof, and of great numbers of
proxies of Noblemen not estated, nor at any time resident in this Kingdom
(which is destructive to the liberty and freedom of Parliament here) the Lords
house was on the said seventh day of August adjourned, and the house of Commons
by occasion thereof and of the faction aforesaid, adjourned soon after, by
which means those Bills and graces according your Majesty's intention, and the
great expectation, and the longing desires of your people, could not then pass
as Acts of Parliament. Within a few days after this fatal, and enforced
adjournment, the said Committees arrived at Dublin, with their dispatch from
your Majesty, and presented the same to the said Lords-Iustices and Council,
expressing a right sense of the said adjournment, and besought their Lordships
for the satisfaction of the people, to require short heads of that part of the
dispatch, wherein your Majesty did appear, in the best manner, unto your
people, might be suddenly conveyed unto all the parts of the Kingdom: attested
by the said Lords-Iustices, to prevent despair or misunderstanding, this was
promised to be done, and an instrument drawn, and presented unto them for this
purpose; and yet (as it seems) desiring rather to add fuel to the fire of
the subjects discontent, than quench the same, they did forbear to give any
notice thereof to the people.

8 After this, certain dangerous and pernicious petitions, contrived by the
advice and Counsel of the said Sir William Parsons, Sir Adam Loftus, Sir John
Clotworthy knights, Arthur Hill Esquier, and sundry others of the malignant
party, and signed by many thousands of the malignant party in the City of
Dublin, in the province of Vlster, and in sundry other parts in this kingdom,
directed to the Commons house in England, were at public Assizes, and other
public places' made known and read to many persons of quality in this kingdom;
which petitions contained matters destructive, to the said Catholics, their
Religion, lives and estates, and were the more to be feared by reason of the
active power of the said Sir John Clotworthy in the Commons house in England,
in opposition to your Majesty, and his barbarous and inhumane expressions in
that house against Catholic Religion, and the professors thereof. Soon after,
an order conceived in the Commons house of England, that no man should bow unto
the name of JESUS (at the sacred sound whereof all knees should bend) came to
the knowledge of the said Catholics, and that the said malignant party did
contrive, and plot to extinguish their Religion and Nation, hence it did arise
that some of the said Catholics begun to consider the deplorable and desperate
condition they were in by a Statute Law here found among the records of this
kingdom, of the second year of the reign of the late Queen Elizabeth, but
never executed in her time, nor discovered till most of the Members of that
Parliament were dead, no Catholic of this kingdom could enjoy his life, estate
or liberty, if the said statute were executed, whereunto no impediment
remained, but your Majesty's prerogative, and power, which were endeavored to
be clipped or taken away, as is before rehearsed, then the plot of destruction,
by any Army out of Scotland, and another of the malignant party in England must
be executed; the fears of those twofold destructions, and their ardent desire
to maintain that just prerogative, which might encounter and remove it, did
necessitate some Catholics in the North about the two and twentieth of
October, 1641. to take Arms, in maintenance of their Religion, your Majesty's
rights, and the preservation of life, estate, and liberty; and immediately
thereupon, took a solemn Oath, and sent several Declarations to the
Lords-Iustices and Counsel to that effect, and humbly desired they might be
heard in Parliament, unto the determination whereof they were ready to submit
themselves, and their demands: which Declarations being received, were slighted
by the said Lords-Iustices, who with the swaying part of the said Counsel, and
by the advice of the said two impeached Judges, glad of any occasion to put off
the Parliament, which by the former adjournment was to meet soon after, caused
a Proclamation to be published on the three and twentieth of the said Month of
October 1641. therein accusing all the Catholics of Ireland of disloyalty, and
thereby declaring that the Parliament was prorogued, until the six and
twentieth of February following: within a few days after the said three and
twentieth day of October, 1641. many Lords and other persons of rank and
quality, made their humble address to the Lords-Iustices and counsel, and made
it evidently appear unto them, that the said prorogation was against Law, and
humbly besought the Parliament might sit, according to the former adiournment,
which was then the only expedient to compose or remove the then growing
discontents and troubles of the land; And the said Lords-Iustices, and their
party of the Counsel, then well knowing that the Members of both houses
throughout the kingdom, (a few in and about Dublin only excepted) would stay
from the meeting of both houses, by reason of the said prorogation, by
proclamation two days before the time, gave way the Parliament might sit, but
so limited, that no Act of grace or any thing else for the peoples quiet or
satisfaction might be propounded or passed; and thereupon a few of the Lords
and Commons appeared in the Parliament house, who in their entrance at the
Castle-bridge and gate, and within the yard to the Parliament House door, and
recesse from thence, were environed with a great number of Armed men, with
their match lighted, and Muskets presented even to the breasts of the members
of both houses, none being admitted to bring one servant to attend him, or any
weapon about him within the Castle-bridge; yet how thin soever the houses were,
or how much overawed, they both did supplicate the Lords-Iustices and
Counsel, that they might continue for a time together, and expect the coming
of the rest of both houses, to the end they might quiet the troubles in full
Parliament, and that some Acts of security granted by your Majesty, and
transmitted under the great Seal of England, might pass to settle the minds
of your Majesty's subjects. To these requests, so much conducing to your
Majesty's service, and the settlement of your people, a flat denial was given,
and the said Lords-Iustices and their party of the Counsel, by their working
with their party in both houses of Parliament, being then very thin as
aforesaid, propounded an order should be conceived in Parliament that the said
discontented Gentlemen took Arms in rebellious manner, which was resented much
by the best affected of both houses, but being awed as aforesaid, and credibly
informed of some particular persons amongst them, stood in opposition
thereunto, that the said Musketeers were directed to shoot them at their going
out of the Parliament house; through which terror, way was given to that
order. Notwithstanding all the before mentioned provocations, pressures, and
indignities, the far greater and more considerable party of the Catholics, and
all the Cities and Corporations of Ireland, and whole provinces stood quiet in
their houses, whereupon, the Lords-Iustices and their adherents well knowing
that many powerful Members of the Parliament of England, stood in opposition
to your Majesty, made their principal application, and addressed their
dispatches full fraught with calumnies and false suggestions against the
Catholics of this kingdom to them, and propounded unto them to send several
great forces to Conquer the kingdom; those of the malignant party here were by
them armed; the Catholics were not only denied Arms, but were disarmed, even
in the City of Dublin, which in all successions of ages past, continued as
loyal to the Crown of England, as any City or place whatsoever, all other
ancient and usual Cities and Corporate Towns of the kingdom, by means whereof
principally the kingdom was preserved in former times, were denied arms for
their money to defend themselves: and express order given by the said
Lords-Iustices, to disarme all Catholics in some of the said Cities, and
Towns, others disfurnished, were inhibited to provide Arms for their defense,
and the said Lords-Justices and Counsel having received an order of both
houses of Parliament in England, to publish a proclamation of pardon, unto all
those who were then in rebellion (as they termed it) in this kingdom, if they
did submit by a day to be limited. The said Sir William Parsons, contrary to
this order, so wrought with his party of the Counsel, that a proclamation was
published of pardon, only in two Counties, and a very short day prefixed, and
therein all freeholders were excepted: through which every man saw that the
estates of Catholics were first aimed at, and their lives next: The said
Lords-Iustices and their party having advanced their design thus far, and not
finding the success answerable to their desires, commanded Sir Charles Coot
Knight and Baronet, deceased, to march to the County of Wickloe, where he
burnt, killed, and destroyed all in his way; And in a most cruel manner, man,
woman and child, persons that had no appearing wills to do hurt, nor power to
execute it; soon after some foot-companies did march in the night by direction
of the said Lords-Iustices, and their said party, to the Town of Sawntry in
Fingall, three miles off Dublin; a Country that neither then, nor for the space
of four or five hundred years before did feel what troubles were, or war
meant, but it was too sweet and too near, and therefore fit to be forced to
arms; in that town innocent husbandmen, some of them being Catholics, and
some Protestants, taken for Catholics, were murdered in their Inn, and their
heads carried triumphant into Dublin; next morning complaint being made of
this, no redress was obtained therein; whereupon some Gentlemen of quality,
and others the inhabitants of the Country, seeing what was then acted, and what
passed in the said last march toward the County of Wickloe, and justly fearing
to be all murdered, forsook their houses, and were constrained to stand
together in their own defense, though ill provided of Arms or Ammunition.
Hereupon a proclamation was agreed upon at the Counsel board on the thirteenth
of December, 1641. and not published or printed till the fifteenth of December,
by which, the said Gentlemen, and George King by name, were required to come
in, by or upon the eighteenth of the said Month, and a safety was therein
promised them. On the same day, another proclamation was published, summoning
the Lords dwelling in the English-pale near Dublin, to a Grand-Counsell on the
seventeeth of the said Month; but the Lords-Justices, and their party of the
Counsel, to take away all hope of Accommodation, gave direction to the said
Sir Charles Coote, the said fifteenth day of the said Month of December, to
march to Clontarff, being the house and Town of the said George King, and two
miles from Dublin, to pillage, burn, kill, and destroy all that there was to be
found; which direction was readily and particularly observed (in manifest
breach of public faith) by means whereof the meeting of the said
Grand-Counsell was diverted, the Lords not daring to come within the power of
such notorious faith-breakers; the consideration whereof, and of other matters
aforesaid, made the Nobility and Gentry of the English-pale, and other parts of
the province of Leinster sensible of the present danger, and put themselves in
the best posture they could, for their natural defense, and employed
Lieutenant Colonel Read, to present their humble Remonstrance to your Sacred
Majesty, and to declare unto you the state of their affairs, and humbly to
beseech relief and redress therein; the said Lieutenant Colonel, though your
Majesty's servant and employed in public trust (in which case the Law of
Nations affords safety and protection) was without regard to either, not only
stopped from proceeding in his employment, but also tortured on the rack at
Dublin.

10 The Lord-president of Munster, by direction of the said Lords-Iustices
(that province being quiet) with his accomplices, burnt, preyed, and put to
death, Men, Women and children, without making any difference of quality,
condition, age, or sex, in several parts of that province. The Catholics,
Nobles and Gentlemen there mistrusted and threatened, and others of inferior
quality trusted and furnished with Arms and Ammunition; The province of
Connaght was used in the like measure; whereupon, most of the considerable
Catholics in both the said provinces were enforced (without Arms or
ammunition) to look after safety, and to that end to stand on their defense,
still expecting your Majesty's pleasure, and always ready to obey your
commands: Now the plot of the said ministers of State and their adherents,
being very ripe, applications were incessantly by them made to the malignant
party in England, to deprive this people of all hopes of your Majesty's justice
or mercy, and to plant a perpetual enmity between the English and Scottish
Nation and your subjects of this kingdom.

11 That whereas this your Majesty's kingdom of Ireland, in all successions of
ages, since the reign of King Henry the second, sometimes King of England, and
Lord of Ireland, had a Parliament of their own, composed of Lords and Commons
in the same manner and form, qualified with equal liberties, powers,
privileges, and immunities with the Parliament of England, and only dependant
of the King and Crown of England and Ireland; and for all that time, no
prevalent Record, or authentic president can be found, that any Statute made
in England, could or did bind this kingdom before the same were here
established by Parliament: yet upon untrue suggestions and informations given
of your subjects of Ireland, an act of Parliament, entitled, An Act for the
speedy and effectual reducing of the Rebels in his Majesty's kingdom of
Ireland, to their due obedience to his Majesty, and the Crown of England; and
another Act, entitled, An Act for adding unto and explaining the said former
Act, was procured to be enacted in the said Parliament of England, in the 18.
year of your Majesty's reign, by which Acts, and other proclamations your
Majesty's subjects unsummoned, unheard, were declared Rebels, and two Millions
and a half of Acres arrable, meadow and profitable pasture within this
kingdom, were sold to undertakers for certain sums of money, and the Edifices,
Loghes, Woods, Bogs, wastes and their appurtenances, were thereby mentioned to
be granted and past gratis: which Acts the said Catholics do conceive to have
been forced upon your Majesty, and although void, and unjust in themselves, to
all purposes, yet continue matters of evil consequence, and extreme prejudice
to your Majesty, and totally destructive to this Nation. The scope seeming to
aim at Rebels only, and at the disposition of a certain quantity of Land, but
in effect and substance, all the Lands in the kingdom, by the words of the said
Acts may be distributed in whose possession soever they were, without respect
to age, condition or quality, and all your Majesty's Tenures, and the greatest
part of your Majesty's standing Revenue in this kingdom taken away, and by the
said Act, if it were of force, all power of pardoning, and of granting those
Lands, is taken from your Majesty; a president that no age can instance the
like; against this Act the said Catholics do protest, as an Act against the
fundamental Laws of this kingdom, and as an Act destructive to your Majesty's
right and prerogatives; by color whereof most of the forces sent hither to
infest this kingdom by Sea and Land, disavowed any authority form your Majesty,
but do depend upon the Parliament of England.

12 All strangers and such as were not inhabitants of the city of Dublin, being
commanded by the said Lord-Iustices, in and since the said Month of November,
1641. to depart the said city, were no sooner departed then they were by the
direction of the said Lords-Iustices, pillaged abroad, and their goods seized
upon and confiscated in Dublin, and they desiring to return under the
protection and safety of the state, before their appearance in any action, were
denied the same; and diverse other persons of rank and quality by the said
Lords-Iustices employed in public service, and others keeping close within
their doors without annoying any man, or siding then with any of the said
Catholics in Arms, and others in several parts of the kingdom, living under,
and having the protection and safety of the state, were sooner pillaged, their
houses burnt, themselves, their Tenants and servants killed and destroyed then
any other, by directions from the said Lords-Iustices, and by the like
direction when any Commander in chief of the Army promised or gave quarter or
protection, the same was in all Cases violated, and many persons of quality,
who obtained the same, were ruined before others. Others that came into Dublin,
voluntarily, and that could not be justly suspected of any crime, if Irishmen,
or Catholics, by the like direction were imprisoned in Dublin, robbed and
pillaged abroad, and brought to their trial for their lives; The city of
Dublin, and Cork, and the ancient Corporate Towns of Drogheda, Yeoghell, and
Kinsale, who voluntarily received garrisons in your Majesty's name, and the
adjacent countries who relieved them, were worse used, and now live in worse
condition than the Israelites did in Aegipt: So that it will be made appear,
that more murders, breaches of public faith, and quarter, more destruction
and desolation, more cruelly not fit to be named, were committed in Ireland, by
the direction and advice of the said Lords-Justices and their party of the said
Counsel, in less then eighteen Months, then can pe paraleld to have been
done by any Christian people.

13 The said Lord-Justices and their adherents, have against the fundamental
Laws of the Land, procured the sitting of both houses of Parliament for
several Sessions (nine parts of ten of the natural and genuine Members
thereof being absent) it standing not with their safety, to come under their
power, and made up a considerable number in the house of Commons, of Clerks,
Soldiers, Serving-men and others, not legally, or not chosen at all, or
returned, and having no manner of estate within the kingdom; in which sitting,
sundry Orders were conceived, and dismiss obtained of persons before impeached
of Treason in full Parliament, and passed or might have passed some Acts
against Law, and to the prejudice of your Majesty and this whole Nation; and
during these troubles, Terms were kept, and your Majesty's Court of chief
place, and other Courts sat at Dublin, to no other end or purpose, but by
false and illegal Judgments, Outlawries, and other Capital proceedings, to
attaynt many thousands of your Majesty's most faithful subjects of this
kingdom, they being never summoned, nor having notice of those proceedings, and
Sheriffs made of obscure mean persons, by the like practice appointed of
purpose, and poor Artificers, common soldiers, and mecanicall servants
returned Jurors, to pass upon the lives and estates of those who came in upon
protection and public faith.

14 Therefore the said Catholics, in the behalf of themselves, and of the
whole kingdom of Ireland, Do protest and declare against the said proceedings,
in the nature of Parliaments, and in the other Courts aforesaid, and every of
them, as being heinous crimes against Law, destructive to the Parliaments, and
your Majesty's prerogatives and authority, and to the rights and just liberties
of your most faithful subjects.

Forasmuch, Dread Sovereign, as the speedy application of apt remedies unto
these grievances and heavy pressures, will tend to the settlement and
improvement of your Majesty's revenue, the prevention of further effusion of
blood, the preservation of this kingdom from desolation, and the content and
satisfaction of your said subjects, who in manifestation of their duty and
zeal to your Majesty's service, will be most willing and ready to employ
10000. men, under the conduct of wel-experienced Commanders in defense of your
Royal rights and prerogatives. They therefore most humbly beseech your
Majesty, That you will vouchsafe gracious answers to these their humble and
just complaints. And for the establishment of your people in a lasting peace
and security, The said Catholics do most humbly pray, that your Majesty may be
further graciously pleased to call a free Parliament in this kingdom, in such
convenient time, as your Majesty in your high wisdom shall think fit, and the
urgencie of the present affairs of the said kingdom does require; and that the
said Parliaments be held in an indifferent place, summoned by, and continued
before some person or persons of honor, and fortune, of approved faith to your
Majesty, and acceptable to your people here, and to be timely placed by your
Majesty in this government, which is most necessary for the advancement of your
service and present condition of the kingdom; in which Parliament, the said
Catholics do humbly pray these and other their grievances may be redressed,
and that in the said Parliament, a statute made in this kingdom in the 10.
year of K. Henry the 7. commonly called Poynings Act, and all acts explayning
or enlarging the same, be by a particular Act suspended, during that
Parliament, as it has been already done, in the 11. year of Q. Eliz. upon
occasions of far less moment then now do offer themselves; And that your
Majesty, with the advice of the said Parliament, will be pleased to take a
course for the repealing, or further continuance of the said Statutes, as may
best conduce to the advancement of your service here, and peace of this your
Realm, and that no matter whereof Complaint is made in this Remonstrance, may
debar Catholics, or give interruption to their free votes, or sitting in the
said Parliament; And as in duty bound they will ever pray for your Majesty's
long and prosperous Reign over them.

FINIS.
THis Remonstrance was delivered, by the Lord Viscount Gormonstown, Sir Lucas
Dillon Knight, Sir Robert Talbot Baronet, and John Walsh Esquire, thereunto
authorized by the Confederate Catholics of Ireland, to His Majesty's
Commissioners at the Town of Trim in the County of Mead, on the 17. of March,
1642. to be presented to His most Excellent Majesty.

Printed at Waterford by Thomas Bourke, Printer to the Confederate Catholics
of IRELAND. Anno Dom. 1643.

To the Kings most excellent Majesty.
YOur Majesty's most loyal and obedient Protestant Subjects of Ireland,
groaning under the heavy pressures of the confederate Roman Catholics of
Ireland, who to add to all their other injuries, have printed a book
entitled A Remonstrance, delivered by the Lord Viscount Gormanstowne, and
others, authorized by the said confederate Catholics, to Your Majesty's
Commissioners at Trym, the 17. of March, 1642. (which came not to the knowledge
of Your Majesty's Protestant Subjects of Ireland till of late) wherein they
have endeavored by confounding of times, and by other subtle conveyances, to
put a show of reason upon their wicked and unnatural acts: We therefore
beseech Your most sacred Majesty to cast your eye upon the ensuing Collection
of some passages and unknown truths, wherein will appear part of the
grievances of Your Majesty's said Protestant subjects, and part of the many
untruths and scandalous aspersions by the said Remonstrants cast upon Your
Majesty's gracious government, and upon Your said Protestant subjects. And
although these Collections in some measure answer the Remonstrance, and come
attired in round and plain expressions, as the woeful case requires, the just
vindication of Your Majesty's gracious government pressing also that all
vizards and palliations be laid aside; yet it is humbly prayed, that nothing
herein may be construed as to proceed of malice, or desire of aggravation
against any person therein concerned, how intolerable soever the projects and
actions of many of them have been; or to be contrived to avert, foreclose, or
shorten Your Majesty's grace or clemency, which Your Majesty shall extend to
any of them in Your Majesty's abundant indulgence, as a Princely parent to your
people, and may stand with Your Majesty's honor and sovereignty, and the peace
and future security of Your Majesty's Kingdom and good people of Ireland.

First to the Preface.
THat the Remonstrants were no way necessitated to take Arms for the
preservation of their Religion; for which long time before their taking arms
they were not troubled, nor so much as questioned (having also in their actions
varied from the rules of all Christian Religion) nor for maintenance of your
Maties rights and prerogatives, there being no opponents in the kingdom of
Ireland in that matter, except the Remo^strants themselves, who knew that
Governors and Officers there, have with all zeal, and constancy from time to
time maintained, and with extreme hazard of their lives to maintain the same,
and that none in the said Kingdom has offered to oppose or diminish them,
save what these Remonstrants have done by laying aspersions on your Majesty in
your Goverement, and striving to abridge both your profit and Authority under
that popular and specious pretense of grievances, which is one of their maine
ends in all their unruly actions; and now having possessed themselves almost of
all your Majesty's Revenues both certain and casual, and also of the estates
of your Protestant Subjects, do undutifully assume unto themselves, and
exercise a Papal Jurisdiction in that Church, and a tyrannical power in that
Commonwealth, as well by sea as by land, a presumption never adventured upon
in any former rebellious times, and which can be nothing but a ground-plot of
insurrections hereafter: They publish new Laws for Government, erect new
Courts, and Tribunalls of all kind of Judicature; they ordain Magistrates,
Judges, and Officers of all sorts, as well of State, as Civil and Marshall;
they make War and Peace at pleasure, they punish with death, and all other
corporal punishments, they pardon and protect at pleasure, they publish
Proclamations as well in pain of death as otherwise in their own names; they
convoke general Assemblies out of all Counties in nature of Parliaments; they
have Assembled, and held Synods and Convocations of their Titulary
Archbishops, and Bishops, and other Popish pretended Clergy, and therein made
Canons and Constitutions for the government of the Church; they have
excommunicated many of your Majesty's Subjects, and thereby enforced them to
join with them in their confederacy; they have taken possession of the
Churches, and seized the whole means of the Protestant Clergy into their own
hands, and exercise the whole Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction and function; they
have received, and yet entertain a Nuncio from the Pope, and two Agents from
France and Spain, as themselves give out; they treat with foreign States in
matters of the Kingdom; they annoy the seas, and hinder traffic; they coin
money, make it current, and advance and Decree Coins already current; they
settle and alter Possessions, and in sum by way of exclusion to all Your
Majesty's Prerogatives, Rights, and Authorities, they published an Act in print
that no temporal Government or Jurisdiction shall be assumed, kept or
exercised within that Kingdom, or any Province or County thereof, during the
troubles, other then what is approved, or instituted by their general
Assembly, or supreme Counsel, and have in this and other acts showed
themselves in the highest degree to be Antimonarchicall, and contemners of Your
Majesty's Royal Scepter and Sovereignty; neither were they necessitated to
take up Arms for the defense of their lives, estates, and liberties of their
Country, they being in no fear of their lives or estates by any violence, or
illegallity, so much as offered or intended by Your Majesty's Governors, or
Protestant Subjects, neither can it be instanced than at any time since the
Reformation of Religion, either Your Majesty's Governors, or Protestant
Subjects ever offered any open violence against the person or estate of any
Papist quatenus a papist, nor otherwise except in case of Rebellion, wherein
there was necessity to desend Your Majesty's good people, or repress the
Rebels unjust insolence by way of just chastisement; Your Majesty's Governors
and Officers there using all their skill and labor to preserve the happy peace
of that Kingdom, which they well knew Your Majesty esteemed the highest
blessing of Almighty God upon earth; and for just Liberties of Subjects it
equally concerns Your Majesty's Protestant Subjects with the Papists, and each
of them have so freely enjoyed them during the gracious Reign of Your Sacred
Majesty, and Your most illustrious Father until this present Rebellion, as no
Nation in Christendom has exceeded them in that blessing, as it will best
appear, if comparison be made with former times, when for many ages there was
in Ireland absolute tyranny in the Chieftaines ruling in an Irish manner, and
direct slavery in the inferiors, which it seems these Remonstrants do rather
affect, then the legal peaceable regiment of Your sacred Majesty, and the
wholesome Laws of England; and since that Rebellion began, Your Majesty's
people of Ireland have by the confederates been wholly subjected to illegal
Ordinances, oppressions, and Arbitrary powers, and indeed to the will of a
raging, and sinisterly incensed multitude; and therefore those Figg-leaves of
their feigned excuses are ill put together, pretending the murder, robbery,
and destruction of Your Majesty's Protestant Subjects should be for the
preservation of the said confederate, whereas in truth Religion might teach
them to discern that the innocent blood they have thus cruelly and wantonly
spilt would cry to Heaven, and to Your Sacred Majesty, Gods Vicegerent within
Your Dominions, for a just revenge against them.

Touching the frustrating of these Remonstrants attempts to present complaints
to Your Majesty since the Rebellion began, there will appear no truth in this
suggestion, when all things are duly examined; nay it will appear that the
Lords Justices and Counsel have not concealed or debarred them, or any thing
that came from them, to their Lords hands, but have furthered the same to Your
Majesty's view or knowledge so fast as they could: As first about the sixth of
November 1641. the Rebels of the County of Cavan sent up a presumptuous
Proposition to the Lords Justices and Counsel, which their Lordships answered
with all the moderation and satisfaction that could stand with their duty, as
may appear by the same, and forthwith certified the one and the other to the
late Lord Lieutenant, to whom Your Majesty had expressly commanded them to send
all addresses for the affairs of Ireland; after that when about the 23th. of
December, 1641. certain Lords of the Pale had declared by a former Letter that
they would stand on their guard, and after they had joined with the Northern
Rebels in the siege of Drogheda, the Lords Justices received a Letter from
seven Lords of the Pale, wherein (after some unjust Challenges made to the
Lords Justices and Counsel) they signified they would not come to them (though
before they the Lords Justices and Council, had sent them security for their
persons, and published the same by Proclamation) and desired that the Lords
Justices and Council, would send them certain Commissioners to confer
concerning the Common peace, and other things. This the Lords Justices and
Council thought not good to descend unto, considering their former great
undutifullnesse. And hereof they forthwith certified the late Lord Leiutenant
also; but the truth is that (for several months in the beginning of this
Rebellion) they little regarded any thing the Lords Justices could say or do,
while they hoped to carry all before them by surprise, or open force; And
indeed until your Majesty's Armies (by access of succors sent out of
England) had redeemed such of your protestant Subjects, as with life only
escaped from that overwhelming destruction by these confederates prepared
against them, and enabled your Majesty's distressed subjects to make head
against their bloody cruelties, and that they felt their own weakness to
maintain their disloyalty against so potent a Monarch as your Majesty is;
Neither indeed had they any color of complaint, the cause of grief being
entirely on our side. And at the beginning of this Rebellion they had less
reason then ever, having lately received so much grace. And satisfaction in all
their pretended greivances, though they had not he duty and patience to
forbear force, and humbly to reap the fruits thereof.

The second overture which any of them made unto the Lords Justices and
Council, was by a Letter written to the Earl of Castlehaven, dated the 16th
of March 1641. signed only by the Lords Gormonstowne, Netterville, and Slane,
in the style of united Lords, wherein they desired to have a meeting in some
convenient place, and that in the mean time there might be a Cessation of
Arms: This the Earl sent to the Lords Justices the 23th of the same month,
which was long after the Irish Army was beaten from Drogheda, and that your
Majesty's Army was fully Master of the field in all parts of the Pale, And then
the Lords Justices and Council thought not fit of themselves to harken unto
it, but forth with certified the same to the then Lord Lieutenant, desiring
your Majesty's directions therein. And for their further proceeding on the 23th
of March 1642. the Lord Montgarret sent to the Earl of Ormond then Lientenant
General of your Majesty's Army, a paper of the grievances, as well concerning
things done in England as Ireland, and desired it might be showed to the Lords
Justices and Council, that redress might be given (which lay not in their
Lordships powers) yet this also they sent to the then Lord Lieutenant to be
showed to your Majesty. About August, one thousand six hundred forty and two,
the Remonstrants sent to the said Lieutenant General of your Majesty's Army, a
Petition directed to your Majesty, which his Lordship presented to the Lords
Justices, who forthwith sent it away to your Majesty's principal Secretary,
and since then no other complaint has been heard of except that Remonstrance,
and except some particular motions hereafter mennoned; By all which it fully
appears the Lords Justices and Council, did no way frustrate any of their
attempts to complain to your Majesty.

For the sense these Remonstrants seem now to have of the late effusion of
innocent blood there: It Is well if they now begin to be sensible of the
effusion of the innocent blood whereof indeed themselves only are guilty, which
will more plainly appear by distinguishing the times, which they causelessly
confound: Your Majesty's subjects being in full peace, and trusting only to the
protection of your Majesty's laws, these confederates and their bloody
instruments did in many parts of the Kingdom suddenly and treacherously
assault and glut their long contealed malice, in cruelly murdering by sundry
kind of tormenting deaths, some hundred thousands of your Majesty's harmless
Protestant subjects, and dispoiling both them, and all the rest of all their
esTates and substance, as is too manifest to the world, nothing limiting their
outrageous aims, but professEd to all, extirpation of all British and
Protestants. All which time neither your Majesty's Governors, nor your
surprised subjects were able to make any considerable resistance: And when
afterward your Majesty's forces out of England enabled your subjects to stand
upon their defense, and by your Majesty's Princely direction and authority to
take due vengeance on their unparraleld wickedness, no man, no not the
confederates in their own consciences can justly charge your Majesty's
Governors or protestant Subjects with blood undeservedly shed in that
necessitated way of their own defense; and just punishment of those former
heinous acts. But the confederates ought to bewail the blood of your Majesty's
officers and servants fighting in your just quarrel, as an addition of weight
to their former guilt. Vid. Proclamation October. 3. 1641.


Whereas on the other side, as well your Majesty by your Princely Proclamation
under your royal signature and privy Signer, commanded them to lay down
Arms, Vid. Proclamation 1 Nove^a. 1641.
with intent doubtless to have mercy on them in a fit measure; And your
Majesty's Governors there partly by Proclamations promising in your Majesty's
name mercy to all that should desist from force (as hereafter is set down) And
partly by employing unto them a committee of Parliament there, whom they
scornefully rejected by tearing as well the Committees Letters sent to them from
Drogheda, as the order of Parliament therewith sent; And at another time by
sending unto them certain of their own Clergy to treat and persuade with
them, whom they abused; And partly by letters and fair messages moving them to
cease and stay violence, by appointing the Lord Moore and others to treat with
them: By appointing Sir Richard Barnwell, and Patrick Barnwell to treat and
persuade with them; Did their utmost to induce them to return to due
obedience, To come and submit their discontents to your Maties known Clemency,
and stop the issue of blood, which they so wilfully had opened and enraged;
And which gives further evidence of your Maties servants and subjects peaceable
inclination: Your Majesty's Justices and Counsel did in the beginning of this
Rebellion give several Commissions to Lords and prime Gentry of the Natives
in the Pale, and all the adjacent Counties, authorizing them to gather the
Forces of the Country, and to govern and command them for preservation of the
Subjects in peace, authorizing them in those Commissions to parley with Rebels,
protect, and promise mercy to all that would return to obedience; so much
confidence had the Lords Justices in those old English, and did desire to make
them assured of their trust: As the Lord Gormanston in Mead, Lord Montgarret
in Kilkenny, Nicholas Barnwell in Dublin, Walter Bagwell in Catherlagh, Lord of
Lowth in Lowth, Sir Thomas Nugent in Westmeath, Sir Robert Talbot in Wickloe,
Sir James Dillon in Longford, and several others as well in Munster as
Conaught. All which Commissions so issued, even to so many of of the
Remonstrants themselves, were issued after the 23 of October, and before the
last of November, 1641. In all which time, or afterward, if they pleased, they
might have staid the spreading of the Rebellion, if promise of mercy could have
done it, besides several Commissions of Martial Law to the Natives in each
County. But they, contrary to all hope, not only forbear to protect or reduce
any, but they soon after joined with the Northern and other Rebels, to the
confusion of the State and Government, and destruction and banishment almost of
all British and Protestants: and as for those few Roman Catholics who stood
firm in loyalty in those unseasonable times, they have been embraced and used
with that love and affection by your Majesty's Governors and Protestant
subjects, which the Protestant subjects formerly showed to them, and as the
Protestants have been.

As to their undutifull Challenge to your Majesty's Princely and deeply merited
expressions in your gracious Commission to your said Lieutenant General of
your Army, granted in compassion to these Remonstrants, Your Majesty's loyal
subjects cannot observe their presumption without grief of heart, but do in
all humility leave the same to Your Majesty's most discerning judgment: Your
Majesty's Protestant subjects do not believe, nor ever could observe that any
of Your Governors or Protestant subjects there have either directly or
collaterally in adverse affection toward the Confederates, advertised against,
or otherwise represented those Confederates to Your sacred Majesty, then the
truth urged, and their bounden duty to Your Majesty and your service pressed
them to do.

To the first Article.
Artic. 1. It runs upon generals, and is in substance generally untrue: yet
in further dutiful care to give Your Majesty satisfaction, Instances herein
are humbly offered to maintain the truth.

First; as to their vaunt of 1300 years unalterable profession of the now
Romish Religion: It is most apparent in the learned Treatises of the Lord
Archbishop of Armagh, and otherways, that for above 600 years within the said
time of 1300 years, the Religion professed by the Clergy and people of
Ireland, was more agreeable to the true Protestant Religion now by law
established, and by public Authority maintained in that Kingdom, then unto
that Roman Catholic Religion, as they call it, which they do now profess,
the free exercise whereof throughout that Kingdom, they by their confederacy
and oath of Association are to maintain, and do now by force authorize: And
for most of the time after the said 600 years, the Religion professed in that
Kingdom was far otherwise then now it is professed and practifed by these
Confederates and some of their Ancestors; for the Council of Trent (which
ended about the year 1563.) brought Articles of Faith into the Church, far
different from the former Catholic faith; And this new Religion of Popery, is
the Romish Religion, which they call Catholic, and is now professed by them.
And this is the great Antiquity of these Romanists present profession, which
they fay, they and their Ancestors have so long unalterably professed (though
that also in so large an extent is utterly untrue) for besides what is declared
in the Statute laws in Ireland, enacted in the Reign of King Henry the 8. and
Queen Elizabeth, expressing the detestation of those Paliaments against the
Popes usurped authority in that Kingdom, his wresting of Gods holy word and
Testament to his worldly and carnal affection, and entangling and troubling
the jurisdiction and Regal power, and much unquieting the people, making that
unlawful which by Gods Word is lawful, and many such like expressions in
several Statutes; which shows the genius of the people of Ireland at that
time. It is clear, that since the Reformation in the latter end of the Reign
of King Henry the 8 in all the time of King Edward the 6. and Queen Elizabeth,
the Natives of that Kingdom, Ancestors to these Confederates, (howsoever
perhaps in mind popishly affected) according to the ignorance of those times,
did generally without scruple resort to the Protestant Ceurches in all places
where any Protestant Clergy could reside, until about the 13. year of Queen
Elizabeth, that the Bull of Pius Quintus was sent into Ireland; And then began
some persons of note to stand at distance: But after that they did also
generally come to Church both in Towns and Country, till about the 30 year of
Queen Elizabeth, that the Spaniards, wracked upon that Coast, dispersed
themselves into the Towns and several other parts, and left generally many
evil impressions, which caused some more wilfulness in Recusancie; yet after
that most of the Natives of Ireland, all the residue of Queen Elizabeth's
Reign, (for then there were few new English) and most of the Reign of King
James, partly by fair inducements, and partly by the weak impulsives of the
Statute of 2. Eliz. did still for the most part, till of late years, come to
Church, which is all that Your Majesty's Government, and Your Laws there do
enjoin them generally unto, not offering to enforce the Conscience with
torture, death, or otherwise, as the Romanists do: Neither were they so
unalterable in their supposed Catholic profession, but that of late years
several of them (even of noted pregnancie in the Doctrinal part) did for a
Majoraltie in a City, or to save a pension in some times, or some other
employment in others, forsake their Mass for that season, to come to Church:
Sir Philonty O Neal makes it more plain in his Letters of triumph to his holy
Confessor, that his purpose was conquest, and not defense of Religion, his
Majesty's Prerogative, or their Liberties, there being none there that offered
any offense to either of them, and for Liberty in their profession, they had
little or no restraint, Vid. the epistle of Paul Harris Priest, to P. Urban the
8. in his book entitled Fratres sobrii estoie. An 1634. It is as hard to find
what numbers of Friars be in Dublin, as to count how many frogs therewere in
the 2d. plague of Egypt.
for they had by the patience of the Governors, their titular Archbishops,
Bishops, Vicar general, and provincial Consistories, Ecclesiastical Deanes,
Abbots, Priors, Moncks, Nuns, Jesuits, Priests, and Friars without number,
all officers proper to that Hierarchy, and free use of Mass, as well in Towns
as Country (they not so much as in truth doubting or fearing any violent
cruelty of the English, knowing their nature and disposition as they did) so as
fear of being massacred for their Catholic Religion, was not their motive
for taking Arms, as they fraudulently pretend.

It is utterly untrue that ever since the Statute of second Elizabeth, the
Catholics of that Kingdom, were debarred from places of honor and trust in
Church or Common wealth, for after that Statute many Noblemen of the old
English were made Councillors; who were bred in the ignorance of those times,
though afterward they came to Church; And after that Statute ten several
Judges of that Birth and education, possessed successively all the prime Places
of all the Benches of the Law, and likewise all the Inferior Judges of those
Benches were of the same birth and education, though afterward most of them
came to Church, and the officers in Courts of Justice and otherwise were
exercised by men of like condition, the Malignity of Popery being in those
times not discerned to be so perilous, as of later times, the Spanish Armado
in 88; Tyrones Rebellion, the Powder Treason, this present Insurrection, and
many other treacherous and mischievous machinations and plots have discovered
it to be; (It Is true, that about the 29. year of the Reign of Queen Elizabeth,
upon the death of Sir John Plunket Chief Justice of the Kings Bench, Sir
Robert Gardner was sent out of England, who was the first English Judge sent
into that Kingdom in many years before: And after upon the death of some of
the rest, a little before the end of the Reign of the same Queen, three more
were sent thither, and so from thenceforth, as the rest dyed, others were sent
thither; And how the reformation of the Kingdom, and Your Majesty's services
were advanced before the coming of those English Judges, the Stories and
Records do show: And for the Natives of that Kingdom, such as would conform
and come to Church, were freely admitted to be Counselors, Judges, and
Officers, as many of them were, and yet are; Besides, for matter of trust, many
of the Lords, and prime Gentry of the old English (though reputed Catholics)
were throughout that Queens time made Commanders of men in her Army, and very
many made chief Commanders in several Counties, and of the forces in those
Countries; All which time that Kingdom was kept almost in continual garboyle;
and as well then as ever since her decease, the Noblemen and other Natives of
fit capacity and breeding, have been trusted and employed in all Commissions
from the Courts, or otherwise, in all matters as well concerning the King as
other subjects in equal degree with Protestants; the Gentry also from time to
time, even till this Rebellion were appointed Sheriffs, Justices of the Peace,
high Constables, Marshalls upon occasion, and all other Officers in the Country
that the Law appoints: They were also allowed chief Officers, and Judges in
Corporations, and other Liberties and Franchises (their sons also admitted
Clerks in the Courts, and other under Officers, which are graces and favors
rarely allowed to the pretended Catholics in England, though Natives of this
Kingdom, so as very few of that Kingdom have been observed to seek fortunes
in other Countries, except some that do pass into this Kingdom for their
preferment, and except such as do voluntarily travel beyond Seas to the
wars, and to become Clergy-mer, and some students in the Arts, as natives of
England do the same; their Lawyers also to our dear experience,
notwithstanding different in Religion, are and have been admitted to the Bar,
and all other practice as Protestants are, by which they grow popular, and in
short time far richer, and greater purchasers then the Protestant Lawyers, or
Judges now employed can do in many years, a favor not allowed to like
natives here in England, which has been an extreme mischief to that Kingdom
of Ireland, as hereafter shall appear, many of the prime Gentry have by suite
to Your Majesty, and Your most blessed Father, been advanced to honor of
several degrees, have been dignified with titles of Baronets and Knights, and
for preferment in the Church; It is apparent that after the Statute of Secundo,
many of that Nation were then continued Bishops, and other Dignitaries, and
many newly created upon the yielding to the externe part of the Reformation
(though it is to be remembered what is declared of some of them by Statute in
that Kingdom enacted in the eleaventh year of Queen Elizabeth, Cha. 6. In
which is this expression, viz. Where the right honorable sir Henry Sidney,
Knight of the honorable Order, now Lord Deputy of Ireland has in his late
Progress into Munster and Connaught found (amongst other experiences) the
great abuse of the Clergy therein, admitting of unworthy Personages to
Ecclesiastical dignities, which has neither lawfulness of Birth, Learning,
English habit, or English Language, but descended of unchaste and unmarried
Abbots, Priors, Deanes, Chaunters and such like, getting into the said
digniries, either with force, symony, friendship or other corrupt means, to
the great overthrow of Gods Holy Church, and the evil example of all honest
Congregations. Be it therefore, etc.

Yet they were continued during their lives, howsoever afterward none were
admitted to those places, but such as were known Protestants, and therein the
Natives of that Kingdom being so conditioned, were freely entertained, and
many of them so dignified, as they are at this day, it being not thought fit to
put that charge into the hands of Recusants; because it has been since
observed, as it is now clearly manifest, that they are in that Kingdom of
Ireland, the Seeds-men and womb of all the distempers and miser able
sufferings of the now deplorable Commonwealth, which is by many of
considerable quality now lamentably acknowledged; neither indeed are the
Recusants capable of that charge by the Laws of the Land; and if they take
offense at those Laws, supplications, not Murders, Rebellions and
depredations, were a proper way to sue for the repeal of them; but the Nobles,
(that they are become contemptible) is a strange affirmation (they have been
graced by Your Majesty, and Your Governors from time to time, with all the
respects of Honor and Privilege, that is any way due to them, and in no less
measure then the Protestants have been; besides it is well known that since
the Protestant subjects, British and others, became their neighbors and
Tenants, and inhabited their now desolate estates, the Rents and Revenues of
those Lords were so raised, as they were brought into a condition to livel ike
Noblemen in a civil Commonwealth, which they were not before able to do, nor
(it is believed) will ever be again, if some as perillously credulous as the
Protestant Subjects (now ruined, have been) do not make such adventures, as
they have done to their cost. Lastly, where those confederates do boldly, and
untruely affirm that their Gentry were debarred from Learning in Universities,
and public Schools; first their children (though themselves and their
Parents Papists) were freely admitted into all public Schools, as well of
Your Majesty's foundation as other ways, without question of Religion, wherein
they attained to the knowledge of the Latin and the Greek Tongues, and full
introduction into the Arts, and all other humane learning. And for
Universities, they know there is but one only College in Ireland founded by
Queen Elizabeth, and endowed by Your Majesty's most blessed Father for the
education of the youth of that Kingdom. That College is of small capacity, yet
can it not be instanced, that any the son of a noble man, or Gentleman were
refused to be admitted thereunto, if they would conform to the Laws of the
Land, and Statutes of that Society, neither are they there pressed with the
Law, till they come to be Graduates, and it is well known that as well from
that University, as Innes of Court here in England, very many of them have
gained learning and knowledge, which in many of them now is employed to the
extreme annoyance and harm of Your Majesty, and Your Kingdom, and though they
were not so freely admitted into those Societies, and in Corporations, because
they would not conform to the Laws of the Land, and Charters, Orders, and
Customs of that society, yet many of those lived there and here with greater
freedom from those Laws, then the Natives of England of the Popish Religion
did in England; and yet it is humbly conceived (that if their numbers, quality,
and loyalty be rightly weighed and considered, there will not be found any good
cause or found reasons, why the Native Papists of Ireland should have more
freedom in Ireland, then the Native Papists of England have in England; and
whereas they so needlessly press for the free admittance into the School of
the Kingdom, as they have clearly received that freedom as is above
mentioned (which also well appears in the men of this age, educated sarre
beyond all former times) so they should have laid their challenge with all
hample acknowledgment and thankfulness to Your sacred Majesty, and the famous
ProresTant Princes preceding Your Muesty, and Your English Government. For
first in the 28th. year of King Henry the 8th. it was enacted that every
incumbent should keep a School in his Parish to teach English. Secondly,
Queen Elizabeth by a Statute in the 12th. year of her Reign, ordained that
there should be a Free School kept in every Diocese of that Kingdom, to be
maintained by her own Clergy, and her senants of impropriate Parsonages and
Viccaridges. Thirdly, Your Majesty, and Your Royal Father in all the
Plantations erected many Free Schools and endowed them. Fourthly, many
Protestants have built, and endowed Free Schools in special places, whereas
before there were few, and those only in some Towns, supported by very small
salaries; not able to give the Teachers subsistence, and so in a manner
discontinued, as well appeared by the ill iteratenes, and indeed barbarism of
the people in former times; and it cannot be showed that any Papist there has
built or endowed any School: nay which is worse, all the Popish Clergy, and
all other Popish Laiety, from whom that Clergy can draw any such charity (much
being so gotten) do send all that can be so gathered to Schools and
Universities beyond the seas, whereby that Kingdom is much impoverished, and
the love and dependency of the people much translated from Your Crown to
foreign Princes and Potentates.

To the second Article.
As they have not spared scandalous and untrue aspersions against Your Majesty
and your Government, and against Your Officers and Ministers, Arti. 2.
which is no other then Art used to cover, or (if it were possible) excuse
their odious murders, and other cruelties now committed upon Your Majesty's
Protestant Subjects, so they have presumed to tax Your gracious Majesty, and
Your glorious predecessors with want of love and care of their Subjects of that
Kingdom, by placing, (as the Remonstrants pretend) in the seat of Government
and other Offices of eminency, men of mean condition and quality, who were to
begin their fortunes upon the ruins of the Catholic Natives, which tax
untrue in it self, is so undutifull to those Sovereign and gracous Princes, as
no person of honor will appear in it; but it must be devised by the Romish
adversaries of the Clergy or Iesuited Lawyers, who now appear to have been the
chief firebrands of all these horrible flames, which have almost consumed that
Kingdom, for it cannot be denied that Your Royal Majesty, and the other
excellent Princes Your predecessors have since the said Statute of Secundo,
sent thither to govern, Earls, Barons, and others of noble extraction, and
plentiful esTates in England; and when in intervalls for short times Justices
were appointed, they were sometimes Noble men, and otherwise men of the best
rank, sufficiency, and ability to undergo that charge, and it cannot be
showed that many of them have built their fortunes on the ruins of Your.
Majesty's Subjects, either Protestants or Priests, to whom they (...); equally
in all things; but on the contrary, some of them have lost themselves and have
been much damnified in their estates by their employment there, partly by the
unjust clamours and maliciou; accusations of of some of those Catholic
Natives, never enduring long any English Governor, or other servants of the
King; of England, that endeavored the peaceable and legal obedience to the
Crown; And it is manifest, that of 21 Lieutenants, Deputies, and Justices
successively, Thirty Privy Counselors, and Twelve prime Judges, and several
inferior Judges sent thither out of England, since the Statute of 2do. no one
of them has left any Estate there, neither were they enriched by that service:
And though some others (and not many) left esTates, it only was for the most
part by bounty of the Crown, and very few or none by their purchase, except
the Earl of Strafford, who paid great sums of money for all he bought:
whereas on the other side, of eleven prime Judges, and many inferior Judges of
the birth of Ireland, employed there since the Statute of 2do. every one of
them left visible and valuable estates, many of them equal at least with the
prime Gentry, and several of them, in themselves or their posterity, since
advanced to titles of honor, by the favor of your Majesty and your Royal
Ancestors; whereby your Majesty may be pleased to judge whether the English or
Irish officers have most built their fortunes on the ruins of Catholic
Natives. It is true, that no Natives have been employed as Chief Governors
there, since the 27. of King Henry the 8. but in former times many of them
were, until the last of them gave cause to the King to alter that course; And
yet since that time, most of the prime and inferior Judges and the Officers
were of the Natives, even until toward the latter end of the Reign of Queen
Eliz. as is before said. Vid. the Stat. of 10 H. 7. c. 8. and other Statutes
for the prosperity of Ireland, while the English laws were executed, and how
it decayed afterward.
And if times be compared, it will appear by good records and histories, that
from the end of the first 90 years after the first coming of King Henry the
2d. (in which time of 90 years the English Colonies spread over all the then
most habitable parts of the Kingdom) the Towns being also wholly English and
the English laws then only used and obeyed throughout all the English
Colonies. The Irish then and many years after, declared enemies and aliens,
did encroach and prevail strangely against the English Colonies, which
happened by reason of the unwise and irregular behavior of many of the English
Lords and Chieftaines of Irish birth, who then and after degenerated into Irish
manners and usages, cast off the English laws, subjected themselves to the
Brehon and Irish customs, The English Lords falling into mortal quarrels
among themselves, called in and waged the Irish in their contentions, who
formerly lived in mountains and bogs, and were of no force; whereby the Irish
grew powerful and bold, and so wrested out the English freeholders by
allowance of the English Lords, which happened chiefly in the times or by
occasion of the civil wars in England.
joined with the Irish in marriage, fostering, gossoprick, and all other
things, even against their own fellow conquerors the English freeholders,
almost to their utter ruin; The Governors also, and otehr Officers, being for
the most part of those old English, gave way, (perhaps necessitated in some
times) to the Irish encroachments and customs, though some of them at several
times behaved themselves nobly and dutifully, yet others raised Coin and
Livery, and other Irish exactions upon the remaining English Colonies, and all
other Inferiors; (All which by the English governors and officers were after
taken away, insomuch as before the end of the Reign of King Henry the 8. even
al lthe Kingdom, except the sive Shires of the Pale, walled Towns, and some
small parts about them, which also were much degenerated, were turned Irish
(except a few of prime Nobility) the English Law renounced, Irish Captainships
advanced, many of the old English Lores turned Irish Captains; All which
Captainships, and all exactions, coin and taxes belonging thereunto, were
after taken away by Act of Parliament) And all the Inferiors for the most part
wholly reduced into Irish slaverie, having neither lands nor goods but at the
will of those usurping Chieftaines; And that Kingdom in a manner from age to
age infested with continual bloody insurrections, and intestine commotions. In
which case it continued even unto the end of the Reign of Queen Elizabth,
notwithstanding all that the English Governors sent by her, could do, being
assisted for the most part all that time with Irish Counselors, Judges and
Officers, as is herein formerly metioned, The Kingdom being held in great
poverty and barbarism, notwithsTanding the vast expense of English blood and
treasure spent there, by that gracious Queen and some of her Royal
predecessors: Neither could the Revenues and Profits of the Crown, in any of
those times, be advanced to above 11000 l. per annum, and many times far less,
(yea sometimes nothing at all) And all it was advanced to, was spent there,
besides the continual exhaust of treasure out of England, even to keep life in
the few English that continued there obedient to the Crown and Laws of
England,; whereas on the other side, since the beginning of the Reign of the
blessed King James, and Your sacred Majesty successively; Vid. Statute 11 Iac.
c. 1. in Ireland, for the benefit of Law and English government.
by His and Your wise and pious couduct and direction, the English Governors,
with the assistance of English Judges and officers, have wholly abolished and
removed all those Irish powers and jurisdictions, and placed the dependencie of
the people entirely on the Crown settled and secured a Legal property in every
subject of their lands and goods, bringing them absolutely into the state of
free subjects, utterly rased out the Irish Gavelkinde and Tainstry, the very
pest of the Nation, the Farmers and Yeomanry being formerly scarce able out of
the earth to gain meat and sustenance for themselves, and for idle Gentry and
unimployed youth: They introduced Civilitie, peace, and legal obedience to
your Majesty throughout that Kingdom, dispersed English habitations and
manurance in all parts and Provinces, even formerly the most rude Irish and
uninhabited, who built and erected Corporations and civil societies, set up
Markets and Fair, for Commerce, built and placed Churches, bridges, cawsies
and passages, gaoles, Session houses, Schools for education of youth, and
thousands of Castles, and houses of stone and brick, for habitation and
defense, (as did also then by their example, many of the old English and Irish,
which were civilized) besides four walled Towns, built in necessary places,
now (since that Rebellion begun) maintained for your Majesty by Garrisons.
They caused enclosures of lands, planting of Orchards and Gardens, and drayning
of Bogs in all places; as far as time could permit: They also brought in
English habit, language and usage, and the full and universal exercise of the
English laws in all parts of the Kingdom, turning all (not formerly turned)
into Shire grounds, setting known limits to all the Counties and Baronies
thereof; Into all which Justices of Assize and Jail delivery were half
yearly sent, for the happy and orderly administration of Justice, and settling
men's properties: Whereas before the Reign of King James, the Judges could
travel no where but in the Pale, and that not ordinarily, because of
Rebellions; They placed Sheriffs, Justices of Peace, and all Officers of Law,
in each County, well instructed to execute their offices: They caused estates
for lives, years, and otherwise, to pass between Lord and Tenant, for
comfort and settlement of the people, who were before generally Tenants at will
in all parts; And by commixture of new English and old English with Irish,
established indifferency of Trial by Jury in most parts, which before by
reason of combined Irish Septs, and the power of Irish Lords, could not be.
They caused the Irish and others to live in Town-Reads, not wandering with their
cattle and creates dispersedly and barbarously in mountains and wastes, as
formerly. They enchartered the Towns and Corporations with enlarged and
necessary Franchises, Liberties and Jurisdictions, as well for government, as
ornament and benefit, to the great enriching of those Inhabitants, and increase
of Merchandise; they settled a learned Protestant Clergy of all degrees in all
the parts of that Kingdom, and Ordained the Consistories in a Legal form; They
caused to be enacted Laws for the course of Justice, and quieting men's Estates
and Interests, agreeable as far as was necessary to the Laws made in England
since the 10. of H. 7. They reformed the exorbitancy of Sheriffs, who after the
Captainships were taken away, did in many places succeed them in extortion and
oppression: They had settled an Army of 2000 foot, and 1000 horse, intended to
be English, who took nothing of the Country without ready money; and a
competent Navy to guard the Coast; all paid there without charge to England.
And lastly, they had advanced your Majesty's Revenues certain and casual, from
under 8000 l. per annum, (as it was when King James began) to above 85000 l.
per annum, besides a great gain the Farmers of the Customs had, for a few
years to come: and all this done with little or no charge to England. And as
an addition of blessing to all this, the people generally by this means did
wonderfully increase in riches and substance far beyond all other times; Rents
raised as high as in many parts of England, where before lands yielded little
or nothing: The breed of Cattle of all sorts wonderfully enlarged, bettered,
and prized, and infinite numbers of cowes, horses and sheep, with very great
quantities of wool yearly sent into this Kingdom, and corn multiplied in
all parts, which redounded to the benefit of the Natives equally, (if not more)
then to the English, as may appear, as by many other things, so particularly by
the large marriage portions given by the Lords, Gentry, and others, with their
daughters, ten times above the rates of former times; dowries and joyntures of
wives, and purchase of lands proportionably increased; Money let at Ten in the
hundred at most, whereas formerly it was at 15 l. 20 l. and 30 l. and sometimes
higher. And lastly, whereas in all Queen Elizabeth's time they could give her
but one Subsidy, and that but a mean one of 13 s. 4 d. out of every
plough-land occupied or manured, to continue for ten years (very few Subsidies
having been granted in Ireland to any former Kings) that Subsidy of Queen
Elizabeth (by reason that the Towns and Corporations were by a Statute freed,
and that diverse exceptions of Gentlemen's estates and other ways were incerted,
and that great quantities of the Kingdom were in the hands of the Irish, not
till then divided into Plow Lands, much whereof was never so done; and lastly
by reason of the Rebellions (of those times) did never amount to any
considerable sum; now in the happy and plentiful Reign of Your Majesty,
they were able to raise and grant unto Your Majesty ten Subsidies of one and
forty thousand pounds each Subsidy, and some of them 45000. l. besides Lords
and Clergy, over and above great contributions before that; all which, and what
remained unpaid thereof, when the Rebellion begun, would have been leavied and
paid with little complaint or grievance, had the affections of the Remonstrants
been as free, and real to Your Majesty as they pretend, and as the affections
of Your Subjects the Protestants were, and are, and all this besides one
Subsidy of near thirty thousand pounds, granted to Your Majesty's most blessed
Father: by all which it plainly appears, that those Governors, Judges and
Officers, employed not their time in building their fortunes on the ruins of
Catholic Natives, as is unconscionably suggested, nor yet in conspiring
Rebellions, and destructions against Kings and Kingdoms, nor indeed can it be
justly proved that any of them have so in any kind built their fortunes;
neither can it appear that ever any of the Governors or Magistrates did
suggest malicious matters against those Catholics for their hurt, the whole
labor of the Governors being by all means to unite them, and the Protestants
in all legal and peaceable amity; which the Popish Clergy and Lawyers
observing, (and envying the so great prosperity, and increase of livelihood in
the people of all sorts, as well English as Irish, foreseeing that the unity,
and prosperity would certainly settle a constant subjection to a Protestant
Prince) they wrought by all under hand, and wicked surmises and suggestions to
break up and confound that happy peace and unity, the Clergy on the one side
possessing the miscognisant and uninstructed multitude that the Protestants
were Heretics, and not Christians, nor to be suffered to live in the
Kingdom; that it was meritorious to destroy the Protestants, promising
immediate passage to Heaven to all that dyed in that action, and that so was
the pleasure of the Pope; for which purpose a Bull of Indulgence of the Pope
has been published in several parts of that Kingdom, even since the
Cessation of Arms agreed on there, the tenor whereof follows:

It is Translated into English thus: Vrbanus Octavus, etc. AD FUTURAM REI
MEMORIAM.
HAving taken into Our serious consideration the great zeal of the Irish,
toward the propagating of the Catholic faith: and the piety of the Catholic
warriors in the several armies of that Kingdom (which was for that singular
fervency in the trus worship of God, and notable care had formerly in the like
case by the inhabitants thereof, for the maintenance and preservation of the
same Orthodox Faith, called of old the land of Saints) and having got certain
notice, how in imitation of their godly and worthy Ancestors, they endeavor by
force of arms to deliver their thralled nation from the oppressions, and
grievous injuries of the Heretics, wherewith this long time it has been
afflicted, and heavily burdened, and gallantly do what in them lies to
extirpate and totally root out those workers of iniquity, who in the Kingdom
of Ireland had infected, and always striven to infect the mass of Catholic
purity with the pestiferous leaven of their heretical contagion; We therefore,
being willing to cherish them with the gift of those spiritual graces, whereof
by God we are ordained the only disposers on earth, by the mercy of the same
Almighty God, trusting in the authority of the blessed Apostles Peter and Paul,
and by virtue of that power of binding, and loosing of souls, which God was
pleased (without our deserving) to confer upon us. To all and every one of
the faithful Christians in the foresaid Kingdom of Ireland now, and for the
time militating against the Heretics, and other enemies of the Catholic
Faith, they being truly and sincerely penitent, after confession, and the
spiritual refreshing of themselves with the sacred communion of the body and
blood of Christ. Do grant a full and plenary Induigence, and absolute remission
for all their finnes, and such as in the Holy time of Iubilee, is usual to be
granted to those that devoutly visit a certain number of privileged Churches,
within and without the walls of our City of Rome, by the tenor of which present
letters for once only and no more, we freely bestow the favor of this
absolution, upon all and every one of them, and withal destring heartily all
the faithful in Christ now in arms as aforesaid, to be partakers of this most
precious treasure.

To all and every one of these foresaid faithful Christians, we grant license,
and give power to choose into themselves for this effect any fit Confessor,
whither a secular Priest, or a Regular of some Order, as likewise any other
selected Person approved of by the Ordinary of the place, who after a diligent
hearing of their confessions shall have power to liverate and absolve them from
excommunication, suspension, and all other Ecclesiastical sentences and
censures by whom soever or for what cause soever pronounced, or inflicted upon
them: as also from all sins, trespasses, transgressions, crimes, and
delinquencies how heinous and Atrocious soever they be, not omitting those very
enormities in the most peculiar cases which by any whatsoever former
constitutions of Ours, or of our Predecessor Popes (then which we will have
these to be no less valued in every point) were designed to be reserved to the
Ordinary, or to the Apostolic Sea, from all which the Confessor shall hereby
have power granted him to absolve the foresaid Catholics at the bar of
conscience, and in that sense only. And furthermore we give them power to
exchange what vow or vows soever they were formerly astricted to (those of
religion and chastity excepted) into any other pious and good work or works:
imposed or to be imposed on them and every one of them to perform in all the
foresaid cases by a wholesome penance according to the mind and will of the
Confessor.

Therefore by the tenor of these present Letters, and by the virtue of that
Holy strict obedience, wherein all Christians are bound unto Us, we charge and
command all and every one of the reverend Brethren, Archbishops, Bishops, and
other Ecclesiastical Prelates, and whatsoever Ordinaries of places now residing
in Ireland, together with all Vicars, substitutes and officials under them, or
these failing, We command all such to whom in those places the care of souls is
incumbent, that as soon as they shall have received the copies of these Our
Letters, they shall forthwith without any stop or delay publish them, and cause
them to be published thoroughout all their Churches, Diocesses, Provinces,
Countries, Cities, Towns, Lands, Villages, and places whatsoever.

Nevertheles we do not intend by these present Letters, where any public or
secret irregularity is made known, or any defection, apostasy, incapacity or
inhability in any manner of way contracted, to dispense therewith, or grant to
any other any power or faculty of dispensation, rehabilitation or restoring the
Delinquent to his former condition, though but at the bar of conscience:
neither can nor should these our present Letters avail or be stedable to
those, who by us and the Apostolic Sea, or by any Prelate or Ecclesiastic
Judge have been excommunicated, suspended, interdicted, or declared, and
publicly denounced to have justly incurred the sentences and censures of the
Church, till first they have satisfied and agreed with the parties therein
concerned, notwithstanding all other Constitutions and Apostolical
Ordinations, whereby uevertherlesss the faculty of Absolution in these as well
as other expressed cases is so reserved to his Holiness the Pope for the time
being, that no kind of Iubilee nor power of granting such indulgences can in
any sort avail, unless express mention be made of the fault or faults in
particular, and the whole tenor of them fully deduced by an individual
relation from word to word, and not by general clauses importing the same
thing: this or some other exquisite form of the like nature being carefully
observed, we in that case especially, expressly, and namely by the effect of
these presents do totally abolish and remit them all and every one of them
their offenses, notwithstanding any thing to the contrary.

Now that these principal Letters of ours, which cannot be conveniently
brought to every place, may the sooner come to the notice of all, Our will and
pleasure is, that any whatsoever Copies or Transumpts whether written or
printed, that are subscribed with the hand of a public notary, and which have
the seal of some eminent Person in Ecclesiastical dignity affired thereunto,
be of the same force, power, and authority, and have the like credit in every
respect given unto them, as would be to these our principal Letters if they
were shown and exhibited.

Dated at Rome in the Vatican or St. Peter's Palace the 25 of May 1643 and in
the twentieth year of our Pontificat. M. A. Maraldus.



THe Recusant Lawyers on the other side secretly infusing into the credulous
Irish and many old English, pretended grievances and quarrels against your
Majesty and your Government, and the English Judges and officers; which
pretended grievances, even those Lawyers themselves knew to be of no
importance, toward any prejudice to the Kingdom in general, and which they
well faw the English Judges and Officers were most earnest to redress, and did
it as fast as could be, being to strive against such irregularities and
reluctances, as they found when they began; And to prepare for this Rebellion,
they did in the present Parliament declare that killing in rebellion was no
forfaiture of lands, though the Law was heretofore held other ways, and much
of your Majesty's revenew stands upon that Title, And for petitionary ways,
and some other illegal parts in the Government, the Popish Lawyers now chief
leaders of the Remonstrants, were the chief practizers at Council board, and
most solicitous to lead the people into those ways, to flatter the Governors:
All which they did of purpose as it now appears, to poison the minds of the
people, and to heap up matter whereout to gather discontent in them against
your Majesty and your Government, that when the Clergy could work in them a
grounded hatred to the Protestants, and gain in their hearts a further
loathing of English Government; how just and profitable soever, both might
meet toward destruction of the Kingdom in a War, as they have now brought
to pass, And yet if a thorough Scrutiny were made, and the state of that
Realm with other Kingdoms, notwithstanding their loud clamors of pretended
Grievances no such enormities or abuses, will be found to have been there, when
the Rebellion began, as do exceed others in foreign Kingdoms, but rather
far less, and not any such as might stir up such implacable malice, and
hatred against your Majesty and the English Government and nation, as now they
show: Besides it is observable that in the Protestation, and Declaration of the
Lords and Commons in this Parliament of Ireland, they do protest and declare
that that Kingdom at the Earl of Straffords first coming to that Government
was in a flourishing, wealthy and happy estate, and that for many years past
before his coming the Government was Laudable, Mild, and Legal, and yet in
some Prints they now call it Tyrannical for forty years past.

Touching the opposing of the graces, this is as untrue as the rest, for as to
the graces in the fourth year of your Majesty's reign they were allowed the
benefit of them for the most part, as in particular:

THe placing of the Soldiers in Garrisons, and ordering them so as they were
no burden to the Country, neither were they from thenceforth used to collect
Your Majesty's rents other then those graces allowed, and that rarely.

The licenses for retailing Ale and Beer were called in, and so remained till
settled by Law.

Orders were made for regulating the Clarke of the Market.

The imposition upon the short Plowes ceased until a Law was made for it, and
the penalty of that Law also forborne at the motion of the Lords in Parliament.

Limitation for Tanning of Leather quite taken away.

Free Liberty given for Transportation of Corn, Tallow, Hides, Beef, and
other Commodities.

Bishops and Abbey Liberties in Towns did contribute with the Towns.

Creation money allowed to Lords, who had it granted to them by Patent,
Liveries, Ouster Lemaines, etc. past without Oath of Supremacy, notwithstanding
the Laws then and now in force otherwise ordained.

Diverse Lands in Connaught put out of charge on those graces.

Rates of Compositions observed.

Commissioners of the Country appointed to join with officers for inquiry, and
all other directions mentioned in the graces, concerning the Court of Wards,
were obeyed.

The ordering of Fees of Officers in Court was left to the Parliament, who
took pains in it through not fully finished.

Estates of undertakers in Vlster were confirmed according to the graces, and
no man denied it, that sued for it.

The Recusant Lawyers without taking the Oath of Supremacy admitted to the
bar, and all others to practice as Protestants were.

The Plantations of Longford, Leytrim, etc. had their allowance of two years
for performance of Covenants as was required.

The town of Athlone had time given them, as in the graces was commanded.

The Judges were required to take order for summoning of convenient numbers of
Jurors at Assizes, and Kings Bench; Not to allow accusation and testimony of
infamous persons (convicted of treason) for evidence.

Not to bind over Jurors in case of trial between subjects.

To dispatch poor men's causes in Courts; Not to assesse Recompense upon
robberies.

Not to bind over Witnesses upon Trials, and to forbear Reprivalls except
upon case of necessity, All which were observed by the Judges as far as might
be.

The Bishops were required to take care that Pluralities should not be bestowed
on unqualified or unworthy persons, which was observed generally.

Provost Marshalls were forborne in all places except upon rare occasions of
necessity, and commonly at the suite of the Country while the necessity
required, and then to cease.

The Scottish men were generally made Dennizens either by Patent or Act of
Parliament, and none were refused it, and now lately all the residue
naturalized by Act of Parliament.

Strict course was taken to recover Vicaridges out of Impropriators and Laymens
hands, many recovered, and where no Vicars were, the Impropriators compelled to
give good maintenance to Curates.

Protections against Judgments in Courts, and Decrees in Chancery very rarely
granted.

Corporations were Assessed toward contributions, and other Country charges.

Order was given for Sherifes Fees as well in Leets, as for removing
possession, and for effecting their Fines by Justices of peace, which was
observed, so as it was not complained of.

The Exchequer was commanded to proceed touching Custodiaries, as was required
by the graces, and not to compel possessours to plead to charges upon Patents
granted to strangers: All which was observed.

Warrants of Assistance to the Clergy were wholly forborne, only in one
Diocese of Down four years since or thereabouts, which was called in; And
in effect all those graces were yielded unto and allowed as fast as the times
could permit: Except the enrolling the surrenders of Connaught and granting
away those lands, and Tenures, and except the limitation of Your Majesty's
Titles above sixty years, which were staid by the then Lord Deputy and
Counsel upon great and weighty reasons of state, as they then represented to
your Majesty, till your Majesty might be well informed of the truth of the
case, yet afterward by your Majesty's command, Bills for Acts of Parliament to
resettle all those lands in the Natives and other possessours, and their
heirs, were sent over, under the great Seal of Ireland, and returned under
the great Seal of England according to Poynings Act, and were ready to pass
by Parliament there, at the then next session, and three other Acts, parcel of
those graces, if the confederate Catholics had not raised this fearful
Rebellion, before the beginning of that Session, which was appointed to be in
November following; And where in one of those graces it was desired that all
distinctions between the Natives and British might be taken away, That was a
thing most desired by the British and Protestants, But these Remonstrants have
now showed that they never so intended; They were so far from that, as they
have to their uttermost, extirpated all the British and Protestants, although
the English Governors, in the Reign of your Majesty, and your royal father,
had by Statutes repealed thirteen several old Statutes against Irish, many of
which were penal to them in a high degree, and tended to destruction.

Touching the Complaints of false Inquisitions taken upon feigned titles, and
no traverses or petition of right admitted, It is a feigned and scandalous
information, for when any particular Inquisitions were found, either for
tenures, or title of land, no traverses or petition of right, as far as Law
would allow, Vide the statute of 10 Caroli: Cap: 3 for the benefit of
plantations.
were ever denied to the subject: But where general Inquisitions were found
for Plantations in Irish Countries, in respect they were for settling the people
in a full peace, And because the Deputy, many of the Counsel, your Majesty's
learned Counsel, and chief Officers of eminent trust, were Commissioners and
always present, And that the lurors were always the prime men in each
Territory, and the Offices most publicly found by their free consent, all
parties fully heard, And that those people had neither legal title, nor
evidences whereon to to ground traverses, And by reason of the great difficulty
to obtain indifferency of trial for the Crown; In these cases which could at
best but breed disturbance, contrary to the true intent of those public and
beneficial works, It was thought fit for quieting of those estates by
Patents, that traverses should not be admitted unto those graund Officers, upon
every light surmise, but only upon good, just and legal causes, first made
known, and well considered of by your Majesty's Counsel, neither were ever
Jurors sentenced for not finding any of those Offices, except in the County of
Galway in the Province of Connaught, where the Jurors upon only wilfulness
would not find upon just and full evidence, as appeared after in the
Starrechamber, And upon the same evidence, Informations being filed in the
Exchequor for those lands, the prime Lawyers, and many of the Gentry of that
Country, in their answers upon oath confessed your Majesty's Title, and so
Judgment passed for your Majesty, and seizures issued, And afterward in a
Petition signed and preferred by all the Prime Inhabitants in that County, your
Majesty's Title was acknowledged, and a plantation desired, besides in the Lord
Faulklands time many of the prime men, Lords and others, in three other
Counties of that Province tendered to your Majesty a Plantation upon certain
conditions appearing under their hands, they well knowing the benefits arising
by plantations, and your Majesty's just Title to those lands, and being
conscious to themselves of their unjust intrusion into them.

And touching the illegal avoiding 150 Patents in a morning by underhand
working; It is an untruth, and as to their naming Sir William Parsons in this
Article, he was none of the Committee that considered of the Patents in
Connaught or Munster, where this must be meant, neither had any thing to do in
that part of the proceedings, neither were any thing near so many Pattents
ever questioned in Connaught, and the Territories in Munster lately found for
your Majesty, which must be the places intended by this Article; the debate
whereof continued several months, neither was any such course continued, or
intended to avoid other Patents, except what was done by the means of one James
Cusack Esquire, on of his Majesty's Counsel at law and Clark of the Commission
for defective tytles, (A Papist Lawyer) now a Remonstrant, but where the
parties in that intended Plantations brought in their Pattents as was required;
A Committee of some of the prime Judges, and your Majesty's learned Counsel
were appointed by the E. of Straford late Lord Lieutenant to view them, And
where they found them good, as many were, they were allowed and where they
conceived them void in law; Counsel was fully heard, where they confessed the
same it was so agreed, where they doubted, they were left to trial, if they
would stand upon it (as few did.) This was done for avoiding of trouble and
needless charge, neither was it a new course, for in the Vlster Plantation the
like course was found fittest, and books of the Cases sent to his then
Majesty, and by him referred to the Judges of England, and by them agreed
unto, and certified back, and so the lands passed, and in many other cases,
as well for pretended grants of Customs, Franchises, and other things in former
times, the Cases were ruled by opinion of the Judges, directed by the Deputies,
and in this Parliament both Houses required the Judges opinions on certain
Queries concerning the Government tendered to the House of Lords, by the House
of Commons; but in most of all the other Plantations, all Pattents, whether
void or otherwise (being not many) were allowed, and the Pattentees had
regraunts, for the most part of the same lands, or if the necessity of the
service so required it) of others of like quantity and value as near as might
be, sometimes of better value, paying only the old Pattent Rents, and services,
except in some cases when general Pattents (being void in themselves) were in
Queen Elizabeth's time made to Irish Lords of whole Countries upon false
surrenders, where possession did never run according to their Pattents; And
in those cases also so much as they were possessed of, were repassed unto them
at the former rents and services; And if these confederates had had as much
care of the honor of the great Seal, the public Faith, and just duty and
service to your Majesty and your Crown, as those Governors, Counselors,
and Officers always had, they would never have broken out into this unnatural
and horrid rebellion, having no just ground or cause for any such act; Neither
were the Ministers of State like to be advanced, or like to be benefited by
what was done, or to be done toward that Plantation of Connaught, and the rest
of those Territories, but only subjected to great travel and pains for your
Majesty's service, and common benefit of the Kingdom and people, And in the
then intended Plantation of Connaught, (so much complained of by the
Remonstrants) the same course was observed for avoiding the Pattents of
Protestants which were many, and for taking part of their lands, as of the
Roman Catholics, without any difference at all. Which course was by the
Parliament of Ireland, represented to your Majesty as a general grievance in
the Remonstrance sent over by a Committee of Protestants and Papists, and
redress obtained in that point.

In the third Article does plainly appear, 3. Article.
contrary to the intention of the Remonstrants, and the Princely and Fatherly
care of blessed King James for the general good of that Kingdom, both by
sending Commissioners for settling estates, and often renewed and enlarged, and
after Statutes made by your Majesty to confirm all those Graunts; And also in
sending Commisioners to examine grievances, and instructions for the general
ease of the people; All which by the Governors and Officers there, was most
wililingly obeyed and performed, so far as was possible, or might any ways
stand with your Majesty's service, and the general happiness of the Kingdom as
is more particularly expressed in part, in the answer to the precedent Article,
and shall hereafter herein appear at full; All which should have wrought love
and obedience in their hearts to so gracious a King, and thankfulness to his
Ministers, who bestowed daily labor for their benefit, as appeared well in the
increase of the Kingdom in all riches, and worldly substance, far beyond all
former times, (there being no such pressures as might occasion such outcry) and
should have restrained their unjust malice to the English Government; But their
desperate hatred to Protestants in general, and to English Governors and
Ministers of State, how beneficial soever to them, far beyond any of their own
working, or endeavors, was so uncessant and prevalent, as brought forth all
these cursed events, and heathenish cruelties; And in particular for officers
named in this Article, and other English officers (if particulars may come to
an exact examination) it will be most clear; That they have done more for the
general peace and prosperity of the Kingdom, then any of these Remonstrants
ever offered to do or could do; And if the English Governors and Officers
would have concurred, or connived with these Remonstrants practices for setting
up Popery, and the Abridgement and Diminution of your Majesty's Prerogatives,
Authorities, Rights and profits (to which end most of their pretended
grievances and complaints are framed and devised) they might have enjoyed their
more tolerable reports and approbation; the contrary whereof they deserved
not, neither will it appear that they have been questioned for any particular
injustice, oppression, or private disaffection, unless they be charged with
the just detestation of the Remonstrants, perfidious breach of faith to your
Majesty, and undeserved cruelties committed upon your Majesty's faithful
Ministers, and innocent Protestant subjects, who could be no way guilty of the
pretended terrors and mis-behaviours of your Majesty's Governors and
Ministers, if any such were, neither is this reluctation and hatred in those of
the Irish, and such of the old English, as after degeneration joined with them
against the New English, and English Government, vernours, and the desire to
root them out, any new thing, for it was the same in the reign of King E. the
3. as appears by Record and good story: It was the same in the reign of King
H. the 8. as appears by the Statute made 28. H. 8. cap. 1. It was the same in
the reign of Queen Elizabeth, as is evident, and in all other times, when the
Kings of England endeavored reformation or reducement there.

To the 4th Article. 4. Article.
The parts of this Article consisting of Generals are untrue, and unjustly
devised to traduce your Majesty's gracious Government in all the parts thereof,
as far as these Confederates can invent; First, there are no adherents or
instruments who have dealing in the Court of Wards, other then the three sworn
Judges, and the sworn Officers thereof, which are not many, against whom in
particular no just complaint did in twenty years appear, not in the times of
the most strict Governors, who would have been (as was thought) apt to give
ready ear unto them, neither can it appear that any wilfully erroneous
Decrees or Judgments were ever given in that Court; in which point the
Confederates would not have been wilfully silent, if they had had just cause
to complain of any such, as they never had; neither were the heirs of Roman
Catholics, Noblemen, or others cruelly and tyrannically dealt withal, which
are scandalous, and to your Majesty undutifull terms, and sinisterly
devised; But on the contrary it is evident by the records, orders, and
proceedings of that Court ever since the Erection thereof; That all Decrees and
Judgments there given, were grounded on an orderly proceeding in a Chauncery
course, according to your Majesty's Commission in that behalf, Counsel on
both sides freely heard, and all parties convinced of the justness of every
Decree or judgment there given, and all tolerable respect and moderation used
in executing the same, so as no man could justly complain; All which part of
that Judicature was wholly governed by the Attorney of that Court, who is well
able to answer for it; It also appears by the Records and Entries in that
Court, that since the Erection thereof in favor to all your Majesty's
Subjects, as well Papists as Protestants above two hundred Wardships were
granted to the friends of the Ward, or unto others of their nomination, (who in
some cases might better be trusted) to the use of the heir, for payment of
their debts, preservation of their houses, sustentation and preferment of
younger Sons and Daughters, if not provided for by the Ancestor, and their
lands leased to their most responsible friends to the same uses, and good
security given for account; Most of all which if the Judges of that Court had
been regardlesse of the heirs and other children, or careful to raise profit
to themselves or their friends, they might have granted to others by force of
their Commission and instructions; yet none were granted to strangers to their
own use, except by your Majesty's immediate Warrants, or in some few cases,
where the parties neglected many Terms, or refused to prosecute, or where they
obstinately opposed the Kings Title, and so of necessity it was prosecuted at
great charge and travel by others by allowance of the Court, which could not
otherwise be done, and this manner of granting was the safest way for the
heir, for it being in a strangers name to the use of the heir, and strict
bonds taken for account, every friend or kinsman of the heir or younger
Children, espying any abuse of their estates, would be apt to inform (often
without cause or ground,) Whereas on the other side if the same had been left to
the order of the friends, there would have been none to inform against them;
The Judges of that Court also did take order actually to pay many of those
heirs debts, out of the heirs estate, in some cases 1000. pounds, if the
Wardship continued any time, in other cases lesser sums, as they could
enforce the money received (out of their friends the trustees hands) who would
often endure imprisonment ere they would pay it in. They also often appointed
portions for Daughters and younger children, many times also by labor and
suite preserved their estates from encroachment of friends and neighbors, and
secured for them their Leases, Chattels and Debts, if they could discover any;
And lastly took care of their Marriages as far as they could, and specially
of their Evidences; It is also manifest that the Compositions taken for
Marriages of Wards, Lyveries, ouster le maynes, Allienations and other
contempts, were very easy and moderate, the values of the estates, and the
charges and encumbrances thereupon duly considered, your Majesty always
receiving but a small part of what was justly due to your Majesty, and in many
cases less then by your Majesty's instructions the graces was ordained; It is
also most apparent, that if the heirs were so under age. as any way fit for
schooling, 6.
and other good learning, for which purpose by the care of that Court of Wards
special houses, honest and religious Overseers, Schoolmasters, and Ushers
were waged and ordained, many of the Wards sent to the College, when they were
fit for it, whereby they were all in the view of the Master, brought up and
instructed in the true Religion, and in all other good literature and
knowledge, fitting their quality, and by this means several Noblemen and
Gentry are at this day good Protestants and loyal Subjects, and for those
that afterward forsook the Religion and became Papists, if they be compared
with any of their quality in the Kingdom, their ability and behavior will
testify their education far surpassing the others bred in the Country; All
which several cares, as well for education as ordering their estates, were in
former times neglected and forborne, and never any such course held; And as to
the disallowing of Tenures of mean Lords and avoiding of estates valid in law
by unjust judgment; It is a causeless imputation, for it is most apparent by
the Acts of that Court, that whatsoever could in law or conscience be allowed
unto them, was done; Nay, whereas in former times when that part of your
Majesty's business had a kind of being in the Exchequer. That Court did
usually seize lands upon one De quo, or an Ignoramus found of a Tenure of
lands; But when the Court of Wards was erected, those Judges did never seize
until the second De quo, which gave the Subject much time and liberty to
collect and find out evidences or other matter, if any were to help himself;
And if any loss and damage happened by those Judgments, it fell on your
Majesty's part through tenderness toward the parties so far as the oaths
of the Judges could permit; In all which the Attorney of the Court is able to
give good account, on whose judgment in law the rest relied, And in cases
where the Bar yielded not to the opinion of the Attorney, the Master, by your
Majesty's gracious instructions, called others of the most learned and grave
Judges, who upon arguments on both sides resolved the question, and so the
judgment passed; Besides, if differences at any time happened between the
Judges of that Court, They had by your Majesty's instructions a resort to the
Court of Chancery, where they were to sit with the Lord Chancellor and other
Judges, and there was to be the final determination, where the Judges of the
Court of Wards did only once sit on that occasion, there being cause for it no
oftener, And there those Catholic Natives might have sought relief daily, if
they could have justly complained of any erroneous and unjust Judgments, and
as to the swarming of Escheators, Feodaries, and Pursevants, there are but five
Escheators, and eight Feodaries in the whole Kingdom (which is far less
then the laws of the Land do appoint) being all men of known judgment,
moderation and integrity; And whereas in the Kingdom of England, the heirs
friends do with all earnestness solicit those Officers for timely obtaining
due discharges against the Crown; In that Kingdom, such is the
refractorinesse and disobedience of many of those pretended Catholics, as
those Officers were driven to express them and attend several (disappointed)
days to their no small travel and loss, and at last content themselves with
bare fees; And for Pursuivants there are but two belonging to that Court and
their necessary servants, And those never used but in cases of contempt, And
those contempts many times multiplied; and in case of non-payment of your
Majesty's moneys, the use of whom the Court were necessitated unto, and could
not forbear, unless they would contrary to their oaths, suffer your Majesty
to lose your Majesty's legal and just profits, And truly as well may these
Remonstrants, charge the government with multitude of Sheriffs, Sheriffs men,
Bailiffs and other Officers, by reason that men would not willingly obey the
law, deal justly, and pay their debts and just duties, by occasion whereof
many were disquieted and attached, and many outlawed, which concluded with
their great loss and damage; But when these Confederates have summoned their
inventions to infame that necessary and orderly Court, they forbear to
express the true grounds of their grievances, which are first the education of
the Wards as well in civilitie as true Protestant Religion, and other good
literature, which they generally abhor; Secondly, that the Uncles and friends
might not freely take into their hands the Childrens Evidences, Lands, Rents,
and goods, and wast them without account, as they had formerly done, tending to
the ruin of many heirs; Thirdly, because the just and legal dependancie of
the Gentry is rightly settled in your Majesty, whereof the Irish Lords and
Chieftaines did in former times unjustly deprive your Majesty, and your
Predecessors, and so labor still to do; Lastly, because by the blessing of
peace and good order your Majesty's rights interests and just profits, were by
your Majesty's Judges and Officers more carefully looked unto and brought in,
which also is one true reason why these confederats do so much hate peace, and
the government of the Laws because their licentious appetites are thereby
somewhat restrained, and your Majesty's rights and just Prerogatives
maintained, as appears by their actions.

In the fifth Article the Remonstrants do still inculcate pressures of purpose
to scandalize that government, 5. Article.
where in truth none such were of any moment, other then that which was for the
service of the Crown and benefit of the Kingdom, which they call greivances,
or where the public necessities of the Kingdom justly required it, or the
irregular carriage of some officers in the Country and some Courts, might bring
upon some perticulars, those officers or their servants being for the most part
some of the new Remonstrants, which officers of whatsoever condition or
profession, were punished so often as they could be discovered, neither did any
of those burdens whatsoever they were, fall other ways on the Remonstrants,
then on the Protestant Subjects, and whatsoever they were, the happy and rich
peace settled amongst them by your Majesty, and your blessed father which they
never before enjoyed, did more then abundantly recompense them, if they could
have endured peace, and the just laws of England; And as to their vaunts of
the great gifts they say they have bestowed on your Majesty, first they did but
their duties in whatsoever they gave as a part of retribution for the great and
inestimable benefits they received by your Majesty's gracious government, and
by your great bounties, neither was your Majesty made the richer by any of
those gifts, for they were all disbursed amongst themselves partly to the old
army placed among them for their own safety and quiet, if they could have been
content with that happiness, which army would have been sufficient to repress
any particular disorder or insolence, if the Remonstrants had not by general
conspiracy suddenly and at once cast of all obedience to your Majesty and the
Laws and surprised your Majesty's stores, and forts, and almost all the arms
of the British and Protestants; Those gifts were also bestowed in the other
necessary occasions of the Kingdom, and in truth the new army (which consisted
for the most part of themselves) received the greatest part of those gifts;
And whereas they affirm that they were the most forward in granting those
contributions and subsidies, over and above your Majesty's Rents, and Reveneus
(which is an expression savouring of some repining at your Majesty's receipts
in rents which is your Majesty's legal due, and which they well know, comes
not to your Majesty's private purse) and that they paid Nine parts of ten of
those Subsidies, it is most untrue, that those Remonstrants were either most
forward in granting them, or paid such large quantities thereof: for first as
to the contribution toward the maintenance of the Army, your Majesty's
Protestant Officers and Subjects were the first movers thereof, and when they
came to be agreed on and paid, those Remonstrants were the main opposers
thereof both in Ireland and in England, as doubtless your Majesty may
remember, and is well known to many yet living, and when they were paid it was
with great luctation and clamor amongst them; and yet they rested not, till
they drew from your Majesty under the title of graces, matters of more loss to
your Majesty then those contributions were worth, and as to the Subsidies it is
most true, that they were first moved by your Majesty's Protestant Officers,
and Subjects, not without some difference in alacrity, at least in those
Remonstrants, neither would they have been so granted (as there is just cause
to conceive) had not these Remonstrants seen the unanimous propention of your
Majesty's Protestant Subjects, and that by a trial in the House of Commons,
before that motion made they found that your Majesty's Protestants subjects
then exceeded them in number and would carry it by voices; And this may with
the more confidence be affirmed in certain knowledge, and upon a second
probate, which is that when afterward by occasion of the Lord Straffords
troubles in England, and of the new Armies lying at Knockefergus, and in those
parts many Protestant members were absent, most of whom upon several
pretenses, they discharged them and brought in Papist members, whereby the
Remonstrants party were grown far the greater in the Commons House, then
partly by complaining in England, and partly by orders made in the house; the
Subsidies formerly granted were drawn down from 41000 l. certain each
Subsidy, to little above 12200 l. as appear by the Subsidy Roll last
returned, which is far below the subsidy granted in the tenth year of King
James -- when the Kingdom was but in growth; And as to the proportion paid by
the Protestant Subjects it well appears by the Rolls extant that they paid
above a third part of the whole besies the Clergy, though neither the quality
or quantity of the Lands of Inheritance holden by them in the Kingdom do amount
to more then to the fifth part; nor is the truth thus vouched, which desire to
arrogate any thing to your Majesty's Protestant Subjects in prejudice of the
others (whom they would rejoice to see as forward as themselves in all subject
duties the rather to merit in some measure your Majesty's princely favors;)
But to give your Majesty and all others, a true view as near as they can of
both parties in their actions, seeing the Remonstrants presume to stand before
them so far in professions, howsoever it is most notorious, how the said
Protestant Subjects stand in sufferings, and here it is desired that the
affections and duty of the Protestant Subjects in Ireland may be measured by
their actions, which have been, and always will be such toward your Majesty
your Crown and posterity as (if those Remonstrants would really perform the
like) your Majesty's Revenews and the bounties of your people might wholly come
to your Majesty's purse without any men of war to maintain peace there, and
then should your Majesty enjoy competent benefit of a fruitful Kingdom which
hitherto has been made unprofitable to your Majesty and highly chargeable,
and mischeivous to your Royal Predecessors.

And lastly as to the distribution of the sums of money given, which these
Remonstrants would insinuate to have been to your Majesty's diservice, and to
the profit of their adversaries, whom they seem to design to be your
Majesty's Protestant servants and officers, the vanity and inconsideratnesse of
this imputation, will easily appear upon veiw of your Majesty's Officers
accounts there, extant which will sufficiently clear that point, and manifest
the falsehood of that scandal.

To the sixth Article. 6. Article.
It is to be answered that what pressing Importunity was offered to your
Majesty by any whom they call the Malignant party in England touching the
disbanding of the new Army, is best known to your Majesty; But it is not true
that the Lords Justices and Counsel there went about to disband that Army till
they received your Majesty's warrant so to do, and soon after for doing it
received your Majesty's gracious approbation, and indeed it was of absolute
necessity to disband them, they having spent all the victuals provided for
them, and there being no money in your Majesty's treasure in Ireland to pay
them, or the old Army, then in charge thereupon, and far in arraere neither
was that Kingdom able in a peaceable way to maintain such an Army as those
Remonstrants themselves, (amongst others) openly professed in this Parliament,
being therein moved by your Majesty's direction only to give some help
thereunto for a time; But it is now plainly seen, that the secret reason why
those Remonstrants so distasted, and in Parliament labored against the
disbanding of that Army, was, because by their disbanding, they saw themselves
like to be disappointed of such a help, and of those Arms, with a more fall
hand, to execute their bloody design upon your Majesty's British and
Protestant Subjects, which it seems was consented unto by many of these
Remonstrants, members of both houses in the May session of Parliament before,
as was declared by Hugh Mac Mahon upon his examination: Those Remonstrants well
knowing, that the greatest part of that Army, as well the common soldier, as
many of the Commanders, were ready to be employed by them in that exploit, as
since more fully appeared; And that this their confederacy seems to be begun at
that time, or before, does somewhat more appear, in that at the next Session
in June and July when that Army was disbanded, and that your Majesty for good
reasons had commanded by your several warrants that they should be sent over
sea, to serve other Princes in amity with your Majesty, those Remonstrants
took great pains to frame reasons to stay them, which by their means the
Lords Justices were then pressed to transmit to your Majesty: And that they
were unwilling to supply those Princes, whose aid they so undutifully, soon
afterward solicited against your Majesty and your Majesty's true Subjects and
servants, not that they believed the kingdom could not well spare those men,
being then loose and noe way settled, but that they intended shortly to make an
other use of them, to the utter destruction of your Majesty's good Subjects, as
lamentable experience now evinceth, besides it was then made known to the
Lords, Justices, and Council, That the Priests and Jesuits diswaded the
Colonels, Captains, and Soldiers all they could, from going over, which was on
the same grounds to open which secret a little further, It must be also
remembered that in that Session upon a pretense that some of the Lord Straffords
servants had placed powder under the Parliament House, with purpose to blow
them all up, (which was a mere fiction) They moved the house to send certain
Committees of Lords, to the Lords Justices, wherein the lord Magwier a chief
conspirator (as himself confessed) was a most busy man, to require search for
the powder, which they curiously performed, and veiwed every corner, on purpose
to see what Arms were brought in (that being a place where Arms had been in
former times kept) though the Officers of the Ordnance assured them that noe
powder had been laid there for some years before, neither was there any at
that time; And when they had seen what there was, they adventured (and drew
the other Lords of that Committee, then and now good Subjects) to renew their
motion to the Lords Justices, to be admitted to see the stores of powder and
arms placed in other parts in and about the Castle, to whom the Lords Justices
then answered that those were the Kings precious Jewels not to be without
special cause showed, and so refused them, whereat they seemed discontented,
as being left in uncertainty, in what state your Majesty's stores stood, which
they desired much to know, especially whether the powder and Arms were all
there, and where they lay, that if they were not come in, they might find them
elsewhere, or if there, then by the intended surprise to be sure of them, and
to know where on the sudden to find them.

As for that strange Chimera of bringing a 10000 Scots into that Kingdom, to
force the Catholics thereof to change their Religion, and that Ireland would
never be well without a Rebellion, to the end the Natives might be extirpated;
It is little marvile that those Remonstrants in whose brains exterpation of
British and Protestants did so much run, which they to their uttermost power
soon after executed, and had their hearts full of Rebellion, which they
wickedly practiced soon after, could easily fancy such thoughts in other men,
as one color of excuse amongst others, for their own evil intents: But that
those persons named in this Article should declare or advise such an act, to
the disturbance of that blessed peace, (in settling whereof they have been
principal actouts) and in that Kingdom where their whole subsistence is, and
where their children are matched to Natives, knowing also as they do, that
such an action cannot be without great means, and authority to support it, it
is incredible, neither can they conceive that it will gain more credit with
any intelligent man, then the tale of wagers mentioned in this Article, the
true particular whereof is, That at an Assizes at Wexford, a little before the
Rebellion, certain Papists and Protestants being at the Sheriffs table at
dinner, a Protestant and a Papist had some conference about Religion, The
Protestant at last wished the Papist to come to Church as most of them had done
formerly whereto the Papist answered he would never go to Church, the
Protestant said I will give you 5 l. and you shall give me 50. l. for it, if you
come not to Church before this time Twelve-Moneth, he well knowing that the
Papist would not come to Church whereat the Papist seeming startled, was very
earnest to understand the secret of that wager, which at last the Protestant
discovered, and so it proved a merriment to the whole table, as is well known
to the Remonstrants, And these are some of the grounds whereon these
Remonstrants pretend to found their bloody Massacre, which soon after ensued
to the destruction of your Majesty's British and Protestant subjects; What the
Parliament in England protested or intended concerning the Catholics in
Ireland, The Protestants in Ireland were not much moved with the rumors
thereof, being strangers thereunto, and presumed those Remonstrants were better
settled in the assurance of your Majesty's Protestant subjects love to them, and
your Majesty's gracious favors, and care showed to their security; It is true,
that some Prints have been seen here, seeming to averr, that Laws made in
England will bind in Ireland, if Ireland named; This is a power that may
equally concern your Majesty's Protestant subjects, as those confederates, But
it being a matter yet far from determination, might have been thought more
fit to be disputed in peaceable and civil Assemblies, then canvased by Arms,
in open hostility against your Majesty, and your obedient Subjects, and the
resolution written in the blood of so many thousand innocent Protestants,
unable to resist, and that by treacherous surprise, without the least notice of
force intended, especially seeing therein they say truly, (and that in all
respects only truly hitherto in their Remonstrance) that your Majesty's high
wisdom was able to apply seasonable cures to any such evils or innovations,
neither can it be believed that those Remonstrants or Catholics of Ireland,
as they call themselves, could be truly informed of any Protestation made by
both Houses of Parliament in England, or an intention in them to introduce law
for the extirpation of Catholic Religion in the three Kingdoms, at any time
before these Remonstrants openly entered into this actual Rebellion, and bloody
assacination, though those Remonstrants draw it in amongst their provocations,
to take up Arms; Neither indeed did those Remonstrants fear any violence, or
sharp prosecution from their quiet Neighbors the Protestants in Ireland,
there having been very great, and (as now appears) very dangerous patience
used toward the Remonstrants, as well by Governors, as all Officers and
Protestants, who would have been glad to live among them in peace, if the
Remonstrants could have endured their company; Lastly, whereas they seem
grieved, That the Parliament of England encroached against law, and unjustly
upon the Privileges of Parliament in Ireland, in sending for, and questioning
too, and in the English Parliament the members of that Parliament, They do well
now to express sense of it, amongst the rest of their pretexts for their
wicked acts; But when Protestant members of this Parliament (against whom that
pretended encroachment most extended) were sent for, they imploring the aid of
the Parliament of Ireland to defend them, and their privileges, were not
helped therein by the Commons house, but were answered by a leading Member of
the Commons house, now a Remonstrant, that the House should do well not to take
notice thereof, least any variance should arise between the two Parliaments,
so unwilling they were to assist the Protestants, or maintain that right,
which now they so stoutly challenge, though a good while afterward both
Houses, took occasion to write to their Committee in England to solicit
concerning that particular; And so little fear had they then of any pernicious
purposes in that Parliament against them, though they now make mention of that
Parliaments unwarrantable invasion, since made on your Majesty's Rights and
Prerogatives, as a pretense for their wicked and abominable actions, long
before that begun.

In the seventh Article, Those Remonstrants do justly acknowledge your
Majesty's grace and Princely patience, in hearing their grievances, 7. Article.
which would have wrought upon any loyal or dutiful heart, to return love,
and obedience to so gracious a Sovereign, and at least neighborlike demeanor
toward your Majesty's faithful Subjects, the British and Protestants, which
how they performed, their then immediately ensuing acts do demonstrate; But in
this Article also, they continue their untrue and malicious calumniations
against your Majesty in your Governors and Officers, who did never give any
of them just cause of offense; It cannot appear that the Lords, Justices, and
Counsel did give any untrue Information against them or the Committees of that
Parliament; neither is it true, that any such thing was done, for that they
know the Counsel (of whom the Lords, Justices, then were) gave all the
furtherance they could to the going of that Committee, Hoping that what your
Majesty should be pleased to grant might redound to the common benefit of your
people; Neither did any Privy Counselors go into England of purpose, to
cross, or give impediment to your Majesty's Justice and graces: But it is true
that the late Lord Dillon, afterward Earl of Roscomon, and Sir Adam Loftus,
your Majesty's Vice-Treasurer, were about that time sent for by your Majesty
upon the motion of your Parliament of England (as it seemed) to testify in the
cause moved in that Parliament, against the Earl of Strafford, And if in their
attendance there their advice or knowledge concerning any thing there
propounded, or handled by the Committee, were required by your Majesty,
doubtless those Counselors did faithfully discharge the duty of good
servants to your Majesty, and true wel-wishers to that Kingdom, being both
Natives thereof, and members of that Parliament: Neither did your Majesty's
Justices and Counsel transmit unto your Majesty, or any of the State of
England any misconstructions or misrepresentations of the proceedings and
actions of that Parliament; but rather it may justly be believed that those
Remonstrants do work upon their own evil imaginations in this, as in the
former Articles they have presumed to avouch several known untruths; Nay, the
Lords, Justices, were so farce from any such malevolence to that Parliament, or
any Members thereof, as when they received your Majesty's Commission, dated the
sourth of January 1640. authorizing them to continue, prorogue, or determine
the Parliamnent as they thought fit; They in confidence that the intent of all
the Members of the Parliament was for the general good of the Kingdom, and
your Majesty's service, did willingly continue it, and gave all countenance and
assistance to it, which well appears by a motion made by a noble Peer in the
Lords House, That the Lords Justices had always cheerfully received their
requests, and Messages, and were ready to comply with them, desiring it might
be entered, to the end it might remain to posterity; It is also conceived that
when your Majesty had given direction that all Letters from thence should be
kept apart, to the end the Committee might have recourse unto them, if any such
misrepresentations could have appeared to them, they would have instanced the
same in this Remonstrance, and not have offered to your Majesty suppositions
for certainties.

And touching the Parliament of Irelands power of Judicature in matters
Capital, there was nothing written from thence concerning that matter, until
your Majesty being advertized of the impeachment of the Lord Chancellor, and
others in the Lords House, required the Lords Justices to search and certify,
whether any presidents might be found there for such a proceeding, Your
Majesty then also graciously declaring that as your Majesty intended not to
prejudice the Rights of the Lords House, so your Majesty did expect that they
should nto introduce any new president for that cause. Thereupon the Lords
Justices having searched and demanded of the two Houses of Parliament if any
such presidents they could show, none were produced, which the Lords Justices
certified back to your Majesty's principal Secretary, as in duty they ought;
And it is believed that those Remonstrants would not now more earnestly press
for that power in Judicature, then heretofore was done, were it not by the
exercise, or terror thereof (if their party could have prevailed) to rid
themselves of your Majesty's English Judges and Officers, whom they cannot
endure to bear rule amongst them, though they clearly saw the Kingdom
prospered above any former times, under their great labor and travel.

It is most untrue that your Majesty's Protestant officers or subjects did envy
the good union between the two Houses; But the truth is, they did labor to
cherish and confirm it, by their uttermost skill and industry; And if your
Majesty's servants, or your Protestant subjects did happen to oppose those
Remonstrants in any their undutifull motions and projects, either concerning
Religion, or your Majesty's Protestant Clergy, or concerning the derogation of
your Majesty's Prerogatives, Rites, and authories, or malicious practice
against your Majesty's Officers; Those Remonstrants did, and now do, ascribe
it to malice against them and the Nation, which is a most unjust obloquie; And
though your Majesty's Protestant subjects of the Commons House saw, and knew,
that there were then daily and nightly. meetings of those Remonstrants, and
their party then members of both Houses, Insomuch as it was in the former
Session 1641. moved in the Lords House, that an order might be entered against
such meetings; And though your Majesty's Protestant subjects found that from
those meetings proceeded daily motions in the Commons House, touching the
abovementioned particulars in prejudice of your Majesty and your government,
whichin a manner took up all their time to moderate, and contayn them, yet
your Majesty's said Protestant Subjects of that house, did for their parts
forbear any such course of meetings, fearing to under go suspicion of siding
or inclination to disunion at last finding the continued inconvenience of that
practice in the Popish party, and hearing also that it was muttered amongst
many of the now Remonstrants, that they intended to impeach diverse of your
Majesty's principal Officers, who could not be drawn to vary from their just
duty to your Majesty and your rights, and against some other your Maesties
British Protestant Officers, who had either given opinion or any ways
labored toward the clearing of your Majesty's title to the Lands in
Connaught, the obstructing and frustrating whereof was the Remonstrants darling
care, all the rest of their pretended greivances (both in the fourth year of
your Majesty's reign and those lately being gathered up, and for the most part
strained out of particulars, and subservient, to countenance and support the
importunity concerning that business, which plantation if it had proceeded,
they knew would have been a full ground of peace to that Kingdom, which they
labored to retain from your Majesty's knowledge; Then and not till then some
of your Majesty's Protestant Subjects of that house, in these respects did only
once meet, (in which meeting there were some Papists also) of purpose to
become in some measure prepared to free themselves and the house, from those
unreasonable attempts, in which meeting nothing was done or agreed, that ever
gave offense, or just distaste to the house, or any member thereof, which may
appear in that the Remonstrants can mention no disturbance thereby which they
would not spare, if any such thing they could speak of, though they have not
trembled to present to your Majesty's royal veiw, many as strange inventions,
neither were the Lords Justices so much as acquainted with the meeting.

It is utterly untrue that during that Session of Parliament (which was very
long from the 11 of May to the 7 of August) there was any certain knowledge
there, of the Committees being at the waterside, in all which time of the
Session little was done to the good of the Common wealth or advancement of your
Majesty's service for most part spent in Protestations Declarations, Votes upon
the queries the stay of soldiers from going over seas, and private petitions.

About the 14 day of July, 1641. the Lords Justices finding nothing of moment
for the general good, or your Majesty's, service then in doing in the house,
sent to both Houses to consider of a reasonable time of prorogation, or
adjournment of that Session, the rather because, the harvest drew on, many
members were gone home, and the house grown thyn, as in some orders appears in
the Lords House.

Upon the 30 of July the Commons House, desired the Lords House that the
adjourning might be staid till the saturday seavenight after, which was the 7
of August: On the second of August, the Lords house ordered that in respect the
Judges were very shortly to go their circuites, and some of them already
licensed, the rest of them should be that day licensed to depart, and no more
to attend that Session; on the same day the Commons house sent to the Lords
HOuse that they conceived the prorogation or adjournment was fit to be on
saturday the 7 of that month, and to meet again the ninth of November
following, on the 5 of August the Lords House ordered that a Committee of that
House should join with a Committee of the Commons (whereto the Commons House
also assented) to acquaint the Lords Justices that both Houses had agreed that
a prorogation or adjournment should be on saturday aforesaid, and to meet
again on the said ninth of November, and desired their Lordships approbation
thereof.

To this the Lords Justices answered them that there were three several ways
of recesse, one by writte-of adjournment, for which no president was found in
that Kingdom, another by adjournment to be entered in the books of the Houses
as done by the Lords Justices consent, and the third by prorogation which their
Lordships intended, But because the Houses enclyned to an adjournment, their
Lordships consented thereto, by order to be entered in the Houses as by their
consent.

On the 6 of August the Lords House ordered that the adjournment should be on
the satturday aforesaid according to their resolution sent to the Lords
Justices. On the same 6 day the Lords House ordered that a Message should be
sent to the Commons House to let them know that they saw no cause to alter
their former resolution for the adjournment, finding no cause in the letter,
that day received from the Committee in England, nor by what they otherwise
understood at the late conference, and from the said Earl of Roscommon, who
late then landed there, (and who brought the letter from the Committee) to
expect the Bill desired in any short time, for indeed they were then at London
undispatched, and the Letter said they were then busy about their dispatch; And
accordingly the next day being the 7 of August their Lordships adjourned the
House till the 9 of November following; All which being the very truth in this
particular it is hardly credible that the Lords Justices and their adherents
(whosoever is meant thereby) would take occasion to use those menacing words to
several Honorable Lords in the Article mentioned (viz) that if they did not
adjourne the Lords House on that day being saturday, they would prorogueon
Monday following: or whether it be likely, that by the practices of the Lords
Justices and some of the Privy Counsel, and their adherents that faction (as
those Remonstrants injuriously term them) did or could in such tumultuous and
disorderly manner cry out for the adjournment with purpose to prevent the
passing of those acts and graces, that Session, which were expected from your
Majesty's goodness: But those Remonstrants having broken faith with your
Majesty and all your faithful people do take liberty to asperse your Majesty's
Governors and well affected Officers. whom they desire for ill ends to make
odious to the people of both Kingdoms; And as a fatal perclose to this
Article, they subioyne another palpable untruth, That after the artivall of
that Committee, who came not thither till toward the end of August. That
Committee could not obtain from the Lords Justices Notification to be given to
the Country of your Majesty's goodness and bounty intended and showed to the
people, which might have tended to their great satisfaction; Whereas the Lords
Justices never denied them any such thing, But De facto did forthwith write to
all the Ports in the Kingdom, with briefes of those graces, concerning matters
of Customs, which that season most required; Commanding the Officers
punctually to obey those his Majesty's directions; They also published
Proclamations for the sending away of Wool, and what Customs was to be paid
for the same; And sent several Letters to all the Ports of the Kingdom to
publish the same, And sent warrants for free entries of all Tobacco brought in,
or to be brought in at all the Ports, and what Custom to be paid; They gave
order for drawing a Bill for repeal of the preamble of the Act of Subsidies:
They also desired Sir James Montgomerie, and Sir William Cole, two of the
Committee then returned, (if they could overtake the Assizes in the Counties of
Vlster) to give public notice to all the undertakers, what your Majesty had
graciously granted and intended to them, which they undertook to do: They had
formerly sent over the Bill for the general pardon, which was all that for
that short time could be done, specially the Term, and the next Session being
so near, as well for passing the Acts then newly come over, as upon deliberate
consultation in the mean time, to prepare for an orderly execution, and
publication of the rest of those graces; Most of the rest of the graces being
to be executed there in Dublin, and in the Courts; The Committee also, and the
few others of the Members of the House, remaining then in Dublin, being very
urgent to go to their houses, which they suddenly did: But it appeared soon
after that those Remonstrants and their party had other intentions, and
determined to be their own carvers, as well of your Majesty's Rents and
Subsidies then in the Collectors hands, as of all the goods substance, and
estates of your Majesty's British and Protestant subjects, which intenon they
within a few days after fully put in practice.

As to the prodigious tale mentioned in the eight Article of dangerous, 8.
Article.
and pernicious Petitions to the Parliament in England, pretended to be
contrived by the four persons named in this Article, and signed by many
thousands of a malignant party, which Petitions they say were made known at
Assizes, and other public places, containing (as they pretend) matters
destructive to the Catholics their Religion, lives, and estates; This
allegation exceeds all the rest in malice and untruth, and certainly if ever
there were such a Petition (as there was not) it is wonderful being signed (as
they say it was) by many thousands, that to this hour, no Copy thereof can be
showed by any: But these Remonstrants care not what detractions, how untrue,
and improbable soever they print or publish against those they hate, for the
truth is, those four persons never contrived or advised, jointly or severally,
and such Petitions, or indeed any Petitions to that Parliament: But to open
this Trojane Hourse, the truth is, That about the thirteenth of August 1641.
The Lords, Justices, and Counsel having intelligence out of the County of
Tyrone, that a Petition to the Parliament of England, framed (as it after
appeared) by some Protestants in Dublin, was carried up and down in those
parts to gather hands, their Lordships not knowing what it was, and doubting it
might be some such thing that might breed distemper in those Inhabitants; Did
by their Letter dated the said thirteenth of the same August, pray and require
the Lord Bishop of Clogher to take that Petition, and carry it to the Justices
of Assize then in the Country, and to wish them to proceed thereupon as they
should think fit according to law; And after the Assizes ended, to send it up
to the Lords Justices and Counsel; All which was done, and the Petition then
sent up, and ever since remains in the hands of the Clerks of the Counsel:
Now lately in the year 1643. it was discovered to the Commissioners for
Ecclesiasticicall causes, That one Partington of Dublin, had a Petition framed
in the name of several Inhabitants in and about the City of Dublin, and some
few parishes within the Diocese of Laughlyn; whereupon he being cited and
examined, produced the draught of that Petition, which upon view appeared to be
the same in substance with that which remains in the Clearke of the Counsels
hands, which Petition contained no matter destructive to the said Catholics,
their Religion, lives, or estates, but does rather lay accusations, of some
disorders and remissnes in the Protestant Clergy, as appears by the Copy of
the said Petition which follows in these words.

To the Honorable, the Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses of the Commons House
of Parliament assembled in England. The humble Petition of several the
Protestants inhabiting, and now residing in and about the City of Dublin, and
in some few Parishes within the Diocese of Laughlin and Fearnes in the Realm
of Ireland.
In all humbleness shows,
THat whereas the Protestant Religion was generally received in the said Realm
of Ireland, in the beginning of the reign of our late Sovereign Lady Queen
Elizabeth of famous memory, as by several good Laws and Statutes then made
and established by Parliament (for restoring the Crown to the Ancient
Jurisdiction over the estate Ecclesiastical and Spiritual, for abolishing all
Foreign power and authority out of the said Realm, and for uniformity of
Prayer, and administration of the Sacraments within the said Kingdom may
appear: By which Laws all Ecclesiastical persons and Officers Judges,
Justices, Mayors, and temporal Officers are enjoined to take the Oath of
Supremacy, and all persons mhatsoever required, on Sundays and Holidayes to
repair to Church upon the several pains therein limited and expressed: And
whereas ever since the making of the said Statutes, it has been the care of
our dread Sovereign, the constant Defender of the Faith, and his most noble
Predecessors, tohave his people governed according to those, and other the
laudable Laws of England and Ireland: And whereas both the Protestants
Clergy, and Laity, have heretofore contributed to his Majesty's occasions
toward the free Gifts of one hundred and fifty thousand pounds and likewise by
an other gift of one hundred and twenty thousand pounds more, during the
Government of the Lord Viscount Fauckland, as largely as the Papists, and after
in or about the next ensuing Government of Lords Justices, to the Gift of forty
thousand ounds, and the Protestant Laytie likewise contributed to the six
entire Subsidies, in the tenth year of his Majesty's reign, which Subsidies
in the Collection amounted to two hundred and fifty thousand pounds, besides
the eight entire Subsidies of four shillings in the pound granted to his
Majesty the same year by the Protestant Clergy; In all which payments, as in
all other public charges, the Popish Clergy contribute nothing,
notwithstanding that they have their duties from all the people duly paid them,
with great sums of moneys left unto them by the death of such as are Papists,
and by their doctrines of penance and Purgatory, and such like, grow far
richer then the Protestant Clergy: Yet so it is, may it please your honors,
That after the payment of the said sums of One hundred and fifty thousand
pounds, and one hundred and twenty thousand pounds, the popish party only, was
advanced by stay of Execution of the aforesaid Laws, contrary to his Majesty's
pious intention as (your supplicants verily believe.) And whereas in the
Government of the said Lords Justices, when the Judges of Assize in their
several Circuits, twice had put the said Laws in execution against the
Papists, and thereby brought multitudes, to Church, who were glad of that
occasion, to be freed from the intolerable exactions of the popish Clergy,
even then about the time of payment of the said forty thousand pounds, the said
proceedings against the Papists were again stopped, since which time, during
the Government of the late Lord Lieutenant, notwithstanding the said Subsidies
both of the Clergy and Laity, Popery has been countenanced far more then
the Protestant Religion, they having liberty in the said City, and in all
other parts of the Kingdom, to Marry, Bury, Baptize, Communicate, after their
own ways, profess their orders, we are their several habits, meet in great
numbers, exercise all manner of Foreign jurisdiction, and Superstitious
Ceremonies, wthout giving any account for the same, they having diverse Fryaries
and Masse-houses that were formerly suppressed by precedent Governors,
restored to the pretended owners, which with other public Masse-houses newly
erected, and furnished with Images and Altars, are imloyed in the exercise of
popish Religion, both in the City and Country; And likewise by their Titulary
Bishops, Dignitaries, and numbers of parish priests, far exceeding the number
of the Protestant Clergy, with many thousands of Jesuits and Friars, the
Emiscaries of Rome, that swarm through all parts of the City and Kingdom,
especially since the late Proclamation of England, against the Papists, they
have not only impoverished the Kingdom, but amongst other their pernicious
Doctrines, that there is no salvation, but in Communion with the Church of
Rome, and subjection to the Bishop of Rome, have so seduced the people, and
ensnared their consciences; That no Papist that is made Justice of Peace,
Mayor, Sheriff, or other Officer, will take the Oath of Supremacy, And yet
they are in all parts of the Kingdom admitted to the said Offices, without any
such Oath administered unto them, and thereby the principal means provided,
for the execution of the said Laws, is taken away. And your Supplicants
likewise show, that the flourishing estate of the true Protestant Religion,
has not been ecclipsed by the popish Clergy only, but by reason that in most
parts of the said Kingdom, there is many Parishes that have no Minister to
read Service, others that have no Preaching Minister, others that have such
Preachers as are very scandalous in their lives and many of the Clergy that
suffer their Wives and Children to go to Mass; Besides, in most places there
is no sufficient maintenance for the Ministry; Yea, and some of the Protestant
Clergy advance to places of Dignity in the Church, (instead of opposing
Popery) have brought diverse popish superstitions into the Protestant Churches;
Turning Communion Tables into Altars, bowing before them, worshipping toward
the East, exhorting the people to confess their sins to a Priest as a matter
necessary to salvation, with other such like Innovations, for which there is no
low nor Connon, and alsouncharitably (if not cruelly) prosecuted diverse of the
Protestants, both Clergy and Laity, in the high Commission, and other
Ecclesiastical Courts, and Iudicatures for pretended nonconformity, thereby
causing some religious Ministers and people to fly the Kingdom, others to
take the Oath Ex officio, against Law and equity, committed others to close
prison, who refused, put down Lectures, discouraged some that kept them, or
that preached on Sundays in the Afternoon. So that betwixt the Popish
faction, and those of the Protestant Clergy (ill affected as aforesaid) being
both encouraged under the late Government, many Protestants have been seduced,
some to popery, others to superstitious practices, and many others discouraged
and full of fears of a change in Religion, and not a few unstable in Religion,
become Newters or Atheists, while the Papists thoronout the said City and
Kingdom (have, and still do not in corners only, but publicly flock to and
from Mass as ordinarily, openly, securely, and in as great, (yea greater)
numbers in some places, by forty to one, then others go to and from the
Protestant Churches, to the great dishonor of Almighty GOD, the derogation of
his Majesty's Laws, and Authority, the danger of those poor souls, that are
either seduced to, or hardened in Idolatry, whereby it may appear, that the
Papists (in all things) have bad that freedom for the time past, that the
Protestants could not obtain; And for the future the Protestants have just
cause of fears, that the Papists of the said Kingdom (though in themselves
peaceable, yet by the instigation of their Clergy, with the multitudes of
discontented Jesuits, Priests, Friars, and others, That since the said
Proclamation came to them out of England, are now more then ever, laboring to
advance their own party, depresse the Protestants, and hinder Reformation.

In tender consideration of the Premises, and to the end of the Laws enacted
against Popery, may for the time to come be duly executed throughout the said
City and Kingdom, the Popish Clergy banished, the Mass houses seized or
abolished, the poor seduced people reformed, and all unlawful designs of the
Papists against the Protestants prevented, And to the end that all
non-preaching and scandalous Ministers, in the Protestant Church may be cast
out, all Innovations suppressed, a speedy course taken for time to come, that
every parish may have an able and painful Ministry, with means sufficient
provided for their maintenance, that such of the Clergy as are orthodox,
painful and unblameable in life, may be encouraged, and preserved from
contempt, That all uncharitable prosecution of the Protestants (as aforesaid)
may be stayed, And the causes of all the aforesaid evils so searched into, that
they may for ever be prevented, throughout the said City and Kingdom.

May it please this Honorable House, for the glory of GOD, the honor of our
dread Sovereign, and welfare of the said City and Kingdom, to take the
Premises, and every circumstance thereof into consideration, So that the poor
Kingdom of Ireland may be made partakers of a blessed Reformation with the
Kingdom of England, by such means, and in such manner, as this honorable
House, and happy Assembly shall conceive to be most meet.

And your Supplicants will ever pray, etc. Copia vera. Exem. per Jo. Pue, No.

And of some disorders and remisenesse in the Protestant Clergy, the said
Partington was dismissed in that Court upon hearing thereof, neither were the
Lords Justices, and Counsel, or any of the parties (being of the Counsel)
mentioned in this Article acquainted with the framing of the said Petition; And
whether the Petition was delivered to the Parliament in England or no was not
known there, only the said Partington says that that Petition was about the
22. of October 1641. presented by him to the Parliament in England, which could
not be a motive to this Rebellion, which began that very same day at night,
neither did any thing ever ensue thereof: What Sir John Clotworthie did, or
expressed in that Commons House against Catholics, was not known to the
Protestants of Ireland, nor is it material, neither is it believed that any
thing was there moved, plotted, or contrived against those Remonstrants, or
that that Parliament resolved any such destructive course against them, till
they had declared themselves in the late horrid Rebellion, and massacred,
robbed, and spoiled your Majesty's peaceable and conformable British and
Protestant Subjects; But the Remonstrants do practice, by confounding of times
to gain some cover for their inhumane perpetrations; For their other fearful
speculation of the deplorable and desperate condition they were in, by the
above mentioned Statute of 2. Eliz. which they seem to wonder at, as a thing
lately found amongst the Records there, but never executed in that Princess
time, nor discovered till most of that Parliament were dead; By the danger of
which Statute they say, no Catholic in that Kingdom could enjoy his estate,
life, or liberty, if executed.

To this it is to be answered, that several Statutes were enacted in that
second year of that glorious Queen, And which State it is, that those
Remonstrants do to much tremble at is not here understood; But it is believed
that those Remonstrants pretend to find themselves so much greived with the
first Chapter of those Statutes, first for that it was made principally to
repeal the Statutes made by Queen Mary, wherein that Queen repealed all
Laws made by King H. 8. against usurped foreign power, jurisdiction and
authority, and to set up some other authorities and judicatures in the Church,
the mischeifs and inconvenience whereof are in that Statute of secundo
declared, whereunto is to be added, that the continuance of such a foreign
power in matters Ecclesiastical would utterly banish all Protestant Subjects
out of that Kingdom, and leave your Majesty few good Subjects there, for that
the Popish party (being dissolved from their just dependancy on your Majesty's
authority in matters Ecclesiastical, which in true consideration, concerns
the half of your Majesty's Royal Sovereign, will apply themselves for all
matters of spiritual cognizance, to the Pope, in whose power it may be to
discharge them from alleigeance in civil causes, as he has often done to
other Princes, which he will not spare to do, for his advantage, and to keep
on foot his old claymes. And in the second place to restore to the Crown the
Ecclesiastical jurisdiction which of right belongs thereunto, And to
authorize apt Ministers for ordering and dispensation thereof, for the better
eschewing those mischeifes both to Prince and people, and to revive certain
Acts repealed by Queen Mary: And for the penal part thereof against such as
shall maintain and defend the authority, pre-eminence, power or jurisdiction
spiritual or Ecclesiastical of any foreign Prince, Prelate, Person, State,
or Potentate; It is to be answered, That that Statute is not introductive, or
makes any new crime, for that offense was formerly Treason by the law, for the
first offense; But that Statute mittigateth the severity of punishment, and
makes it not Treason till the third offense committed, after the second
conviction and attaynder and gives a great releife to the offenders touching
the time of prosecution, so that the Subjects terror is less then it was
before: The residue of that law appoints what manner of persons shall be fit
for promotion in the Church, or employment under your Majesty in civil
affairs, and how Liveries shall be sued by your Majesty's Tennants, the
restriction whereof is in your Majesty's hands to moderate at your gracious
pleasure, wherein they have of late had good experience of your princely
clemency, And have little cause so to exclaim against your Majesty's Laws, as
destructive to their lives, estates and Liberties.

If those Remonstrants do so startle at the second Chapter of that Session, It
may well be said here is a great noise of danger, but little hurt done, and
concerning these two Statutes, they were no such concealed things for they were
printed amongst all the Statutes of the Kingdom then printed about the 16
year of Queen Elizabeth when few of those Parliament men were dead, and they
were put in execution severally, soon after the Statutes were made, and long
before that Queen died, as appears by the Records extant, Only for the second
Chapter, it may be said that it was not so frequently put in execution for
certain years after the Statute made, because all men for the most part in
that Kingdom, when there were any intervalls of peace, did come to Church
though many of them went to Mass also: Recusancy was little then heard of, or
in many years after, as is before declared; But when Recusancy began over
boldly to look the Government in the face, and that not only, but many evil
effects of Popery began to be dangerous to the safety of the Kings Majesty's
good people, and government: Then that Statute was at several times put
inexecution, yet without danger to any man's life, or estate, neither is there
any thing in that Statute that may threaten any man's life, or estate; the most
binding part of that Statute, being but to settle and maintain the book of
Common prayer, and other Orders, Ornaments, and Ceremonies in the Church and
Churchmen, and requires all subjects as well Protestants as Papists to come to
Church every Sunday and Holy day having not lawful cause of absence upon pain
to forfeit 9d for every such days absence, And that limmited to an indictment
to be found at the next Sessions or Assizes, after the offense committed,
unless men would wilfully abuse themselves, as well toward God, as the
authorized Church and government. In which cases, other penalties are appointed
not reaching to life. In which Statute also are other favorable clauses for
the ease of the people far from provoking those Remonstrants, to enter into
the late hateful conspiracy against your Majesty your Laws, and just
prerogatives, or to commit such outrageous cruelties upon your Majesty's
British and Protestant subjects, as they have done, The same Laws being now
in force here in England, and much more sharp against Papists, and these Laws
in Ireland have now bin in force above fourscore years, yet no man ever lost
his life or estate, upon either of these Laws, nor Liberty for any long time,
yet do those Remonstrants from this, and the other wild fiction of 10000 Scots
(then not so much as thought on to come thither, but long after agreed on,
after your Majesty under your own royal signature had appointed and
authorized several persons of quality to be Colonels to prosecute Rebels and
sent upon necessity to preserve your Majesty's Crown and Kingdom against
those confederats most unnatural and horrid attempts) take the boldness to
avow the Acts of the Northern Rebels on the 23 of October 1641 as necessitated
thereto for preservation of their Lives Liberties and Estates, for maintenance
of their religion, and for your Majesty's rights, which none there (except
themselves) ever moved or offered to oppose or impeach, which Northern rising
is by Declaration made by many of themselves in Parliament in November 1641 and
by their advice printed, professed and published to be a traitorous and
rebellious taking up of Arms against your Majesty they then seeming to detest
and abhor their abominable and inhumaine actions of murders and other
outrages therein, specified, therein also protesting to maintain the rights of
your Majesty's Crown and Government against the said Rebels whom they then
acknowledged to be Rebels, and to fight against your Majesty's Rights and
Government, and whom now they palliate with the attribute of discontented
Gentlemen: Neither was that Declaration enforced from the Parliament as they
suggest, but by due course passed, as well appears by the passages thereof,
appearing in the books; And in further presumption, those Remonstrants
affirm, that those Northern Traitors did send Declarations to the Lords
Justices and Counsel, humbly desiring to be heard in Parliament; which is most
untrue, there never coming any Declaration or other motion from any of them,
to the Lords Justices and Counsel, other then a presumptuous proposition from
those of Cavan, which their Lordships answered, and certified to the then Lord
Leivtenant as is before mentioned. Neither is it to be wondered at that these
consederats pass over so slightly the cruel murders and massacres acted upon
your Majesty's Protestant Subjects in Vlster and else where in time of full
peace, (your Majesty's Protestant Subjects not being in any posture of defense
by reason of the suddenness of their surprise) considering the little defense
the confederats are able to make against those known massacres. And as to the
Proclamation on the 23 of October 1641 published by the Lords Justices and
Counsel to make known the preservation of your Majesty's Castle and City of
Dublin, and to publish the discovery of the conspiracy of some evil affected
Irish Papists, wherein all good Subjects are admonished to take comfort, to
stand one their defense and preserve the peace; There is in that Proclamation
no mention at all of any Prorogation. and whereas afterward diverse of the
pale, and other old English, petitioned the Lords Justices and Counsel, taking
offense at the words Irish Papists, wherein there being no distinction they
might doubt themselves involved; The Lords Justices and Counsel being tender
least they (in whose fidelity their Lordships then rested confident) should
take umbrage at any their expressions, did by their printed Declaration dated
the 29 of the same October, publish and proclaim, That by the words, Irish
Papists they intended the mere old Irish in the Province of Vlster, and none
of the old English of the Pale or other parts. True it is that on the 27 of
October 1641. The Lords Justices by advice of the Counsel, and for the
necessity of the time (many members of those houses being then in Rebellion,
and many slain or hanged, by the Rebels, and some imprisoned, and some
beseiged in their houses by them) did proclaim a prorogation of the
Parliament, from the days of the former adjournment in November 1641 till the
24 of February following, yet that Proclamation not to stand for a prorogation
(as conceived not fully warranted by Law,) but was done in those dangerous
times to prevent concourse at Dublin, to preserve the members of the houses
from danger of travail, and to the end they shall not be drawn from defense
of the Country; In which Proclamation there is no word of Irish Papists, or of
the Catholics of Ireland, or of the Rebellion, raised, for which prorogation
the Lords Justices received your Majesty's express command, because your
Majesty desired the Lord Leivtenant should be then there, And the Lords
Justices act was therein approved by your Majesty as concurring with the advice
of your Counsel; And to show that it was not intended for the full prorogation
when afterward before the day of the former adjournement some of the houses
came to the Lords Justices and Counsel, and seeming to doubt of the legality,
of that manner of prorogation desired that the houses might meet, and for
clearing of all doubts might fit on the 9 day of November, and adjourne to the
16 day of that November, and at the 16 day of November might sit for a day or
two, to make some public Declaration of their loyalties, and that a shorter
time for their next meeting then the 24 of February aforesaid might be
appointed: The Lords Justices and Counsell-freely-yeilded unto them in all
their requests and on the 17 day of November toward night the Parliament was
prorogued in the houses, but till the 11 of January after, though your
Majesty's warrant was till the end of February; It is most untrue that the
Lords Justices and Counsel limmited them, that no Acts of grace or other thing
for the peoples quiet and satisfaction should pass; For the houses during
those two days did make and publish the Declaration above mentioned, and some
other ordinance for the provision, security, and comfort of the Country, as
far as might be, But they neither did, nor could then at the very beginning
of of the rebellion move or offer to pass any acts of grace, The Lords
justices by his Mjesties directions did make known to the Parliament that his
Majesty would not depart from any his former favors promised to them for
settling their estares to such as should remain faithful and loyal.
or were denied the same, many of their intentions being fixed, as soon after
appeared, to come by their end another way, which proceedings of the Lords
Justices and Counsel in that business, does appear by Proclamation then
published by the Lords Justices and Counsel, with the privity of the houses:
And as to their being environed with a great number of armed men in their
access and recesse to and from the house with their matches lighted and
Muskets presented even to the breasts of the members of both houses: First they
should tell that those guards were put into your Majesty's Castle (where before
none were, except the ordinary retinue of a few warders under the Constables
Command) for guard and preservation of the said Castle against the said
confederats wicked plots and conspiracies then discovered; And that those
guards did but stand in their Arms in the Castle yard, merely as in
observance to that eminent assembly of Lords and others, as well Protestants as
Papists, and to make a guard for them in their passage to and from the house,
and have held the same course ever since, when those houses have consisted in a
manner wholly of Protestants, and all done without any intent or design to
offend affront, or terrify any of them, which the Remonstrants did, and do well
know if they would deal sincerely in the matter; And certainly any of the
members of either house then present could not from such a civility rendered to
them, take up the least apprehension of terror in some inward guilt, did not
beget in them a fear or jealousy of what was never intended or thought of:
The same course for ornament being held by the late Lord Leivtenant the Earl
of Strafford in the former Parliament, and by the now Lord Lieutenant at the
last Session.

Neither did any thing then hinder the Lords Justices from seizing on their
persons, if they had been willing to take strong presumptions and probability
of guilt, for a ground against men, whom indeed they desired to think better
of, and hoped they would employ themselves better for your Majesty's service:
It is also an untruth that the Lords Justices, and their party of the Counsel
(what is meant by that party is not understood) for there was not so much as a
shadow of any partaking or siding there in any matter; But the Lords Justices,
and Counsel unanimously concurred in all things, did cause an order to be
propounded in the Parliament to declare; That the Irish had taken up Arms in
rebellious manner; For the Lords Justices and Counsel did not conceive that
there was any necessity for their attestation, so that too well known a truth
the bleeding testimonies of many miserable spectacles, men, women and children
unable to resist, who escaped those cursed blood-suckers in Vlster daily
coming to the City of Dublin, and to other Garrisons, stripped, robbed,
wounded, and spoiled, then gave sufficient evidence of then Rebellious and
tyrannous acts: But the truth is, the sitting was permitted two days at their
own suite, as appears by Proclamation after published; That they might draw
up some Declaration of their own loy alties, as they said, and their
detestation of the abominable acts of the Rebels; yet seeing they have the
confidence to move in that passage sinisterly, to your Majesty your Royal
Majesty may please to know, that when the Houses had appointed certain
Committees to draw up that Ordinance, and those Committees had dutifully
expressed those Rebels by the just terms of Traitors and Rebels; Many of
these Remonstrants then of the House much contested it, and would not have them
so called, being privy to what themselves had formerly with those Rebels
contrived to be done, and fearing it might move the Rebels to recriminate,
Howsoever the Declaration passed by Votes, and was agreed on; But that any such
menaces to such as should oppose that Declaration were by any man uttered
(though they say it is a thing that was credibly informed) is a most false
scandal, the orders of the Houses showing plainly, that it was done in the
Houses, no way urged or enforced upon them.

There were never any such provocations, pressures, and indignities, as in this
Article are mentioned, offered to the considerable party of the Catholics;
And although the Remonstrants say, That at the time of that Session, all the
Cities and Corporations, and whole Provinces stood quiet, yet at the
apprehension of Hugh Mac Mahon on the 23. of October aforesaid; The said Hugh
being demanded by the Lords Justices, and Counsel, whether he thought (that
though they had taken Dublin) the rest of the strong Towns in the Kingdom,
which were the Kings, would yield to them, he boldly answered, that he and the
rest were well assured, that none of those Towns would stand against them, as
did fully after appear, for they all joined with them, except very few where
your Majesty's forces lay strong, and except the Protestant towns, which kind
of defection was never so in any former Rebellion, those towns being in all
times places of refuge for your Majesty's forces, and good subjects, and a
great bridle to the Rebels; And the same Mac Mahoun also declared the privitie
and consent to the foresaid Conspiracy of all the Catholics in both Houses of
Parliament in the Summer Session before, as is before mentioned; The same Mac
Mahoun also declared, That twenty men out of each County in the Kingdom were
appointed to be at Dublin the said 23. of October to execute the Plott on your
Majesty's Castle and City of Dublin. and indeed thither they did come at the
time, in very great numbers, of whom very many were apprehended, which proves
the general Combination; And the Lord Magwire upon his examination, declared
that in Summer before, the conspiracy and action was agreed on amongst the
Irish, which the event proved to be true; Besides, it is testified upon oath,
by a very credible person sometimes prisoner with the Rebels in Cavan, That
Colonel Richard Plunkett, late of Donsaghly in the County of Dublin, within
the pale, who should have been one at the taking of the Castle: coming into
that County of Cavan, about the twenty sixth of October 1641. said openly that
he had a contract under the hands of all the Lords in Ireland that were
Catholics to stand firm in this insurrection, wherein although the said
Plunkett cannot be believed, as to all the Lords, seeing some of them, have
even in this Rebellion manifested their loyalty to your Majesty in opposing
the Rebels, yet he may be believed, as to all of them, except, very few,
their own actions also afterward concurring therein; The same Colonel
Plunkett also by his Letters written to the Titular Abbot of Mellifont, whom
he styled Lord, signified that he had been a means to incite the Lords and
Gentry of the Pale to appear in the Blessed cause then in hand, meaning the
Rebellion) and that he would use his best endeavors night and day to
accomplish, Ad majorem Dei gloriam, those are his own words: The above
mentioned Contract or Covenant, was also spoken of usually by the Vlster
Rebels before many Protestants then prisoners, and was declared by some
Rebels (afterward taken prisoners) upon examination; It is observable also,
that notwithstanding your Majesty's Warrant stood good for four Colonels,
viz. Colonel John Barry, Colonel Taaf, Colonel Garrett Barry, and Colonel
Porter, for transportation of four thousand men; And that the Lords Justices
and Counsel gave them all Warrants, and other helps for their passage; And
that the three Colonels that were there, had gathered their men, yet it being
near the time of execution of the foresaid great Design and conspiracy, their
transportation was deferred, and pretenses made partly of the adversaries of
that Parliament in Ireland, and partly of want of money, and other impediments,
their men were kept in Bodies, the one in Munster, not far from Kinsale,
another in Connaught toward Gallway, and the third in Leinster about Dublin,
and those parts, when the Castle and City of Dublin was preserved, there was a
general change in all former Counsels, yet afterward the said Garrett Barry,
and all his men went into Rebellion, and so did most of the soldiers, and
officers of the other two Regiments; Besides, on the twenty third day of
October one thousand six hundred forty one, The Rebels in Vlster. when they
spoiled and murdered the English, said with one voice, that Dublin was taken;
Also are to be remembered, the several Antecedents to this Rebellion, as well
in print as in words uttered by Romish Clergy men, and some Laics, that
within three years, a general Rebellion should be in Ireland, mentioned in
the printed Deposition of Doctor Jones; And in the month of October, before
the execution of this Plott. It was consulted in a great Assembly in the
County of Westmeath, at, or near Multifernam, consisting as well of the prime
Popish Clergy, as of the lay Gentry, what should be done with the British
and Protestants, whether to murder and kill them all, or to kill some, and
spoil and banish the rest, or only to spoil, pillage, and banish all; And how
your Majesty should be limmited in your Revenewes, Rights and Authorities, as
more at large appears in the said Doctors examination: The like Discoveries of
the general Combination appears in the Digest framed and collected by the
Commissioners, for examining the spoils and murders committed upon the
Protestants by the Rebels tendered there by Master Watson, and others of those
Commissioners, and sent over to your Majesty's principal Secretary. It
appears also by examinations sent up by the late Lord President of Munster, in
the beginning of this Rebellion, that about the twenty three of October 1641.
the taking of the Castle of Dublin, and other your Majesty's Forts in Vlster,
etc. was then muttered in that Province, (for a while after in show quiet.) And
the like in Connaught, though at that time, neither of those had heard any
thing of the discovery from Dublin, nor many days after; By all which is
somewhat plain, That the Conspiracy was general, and that the three Provinces
stood not so clear, and quiet in November, as in this Article is insinuated;
The Remonstrants being careful to leave nothing unobjected, that malice or Art
can invent. do suggest, that the Lords Justices and their adherents (who those
were is not yet known) well knowing that many powerful members of the
Parliament in England stood in opposition to your Majesty, made their
principal addresses to them full fraught with calumnies against those
Catholics; First, it is conceived that there was no such opposition given to
your Majesty, as in the Article is mentioned, when this Rebellion began, your
Majesty being then in Scotland, bestowing your Grace and Royal presence on
your Subjects there: Neither at that time was any difference heard there
between your Majesty and your Parliament in England, save what concerned the
Earl of Strafford, whom the Remonstrants most violently prosecuted; Secondly,
the Lords Justices and Counsel did first address their advertisement of this
Rebellion, not to the Parliament of England, as the Remonstrants pretend, but
to your Majesty on the twenty five of October 1641. And to your Majesty's
then Lieutenant of that Kingdom, to whom all addresses thence were to be made
by your Majesty's Order. A Copy of which Letters to the Lord Lieutenant, they
then sent to your Majesty and by the answer of that dispatch they were
advertised that your Majesty had sent to the Parliament of England concerning
that affair, and that your Majesty doubted not of their speedy resolution for
releife of your Majesty's faithful Subjects: The next dispatch sent away by
the Lords Justices and Counsel into England or Scotland was on the fifth of
November 1641 at which time they directed letters to the Lords of your
Majesty's privy Counsel in England, and considering that your Majesty was then
in Scotland, and that it then became of absolute necessity to invoke all the
powers, that might stand with your Majesty's honor, and good pleasure, from
whom any deliverance could come, to assist for preservation of your Majesty's
Crown and Kingdom; They then also, and not before, directed letters to the
speakers of both houses of Parliament in England, referring the particulars to
the Lords of the Counsels letters, and moving for succors, and then also they
sent a dispatch to your Majesty into Scotland, and enclosed therein copies of
their several letters to the Lords of the Counsel and both the Speakers, and
then also signified by their letters to the Lords of the Counfell that they had
so written to both the Speakers.

And touching the denying of Arms to the Catholics, and arming the Malignant
party, who in the Remonstrants esteem, are all your Majesty's British and
Protestant Subjects in Ireland (though there never appeared any Malignity in
them in the least degree, either to your Majesty or your government, or to
these pretended Catholics (quatenus Catholics) True it is that many Roman
Catholics as well as Protestants, were armed by the Lords Justices and
Counsel, when they were listed into your Majesty's Army, to defend your
Majesty's Kingdom, rights and government, against those confederate
Catholics in the beginning of this Rebellion, whose plot and design was to
surprise your Majesty's Castle of Dublin, and your Monition and stores there,
and all the rest of your Forts and stores in that Kingdom to extirpate all
your Majesty's British and Protestant Subjects, by death or exile and further
as is before mentioned: Note, there were but ^00 arms in the store.
It is true also that the Lord Justices and Counsel did deliver Arms and
Ammunition as far as they could possible spare as well to the Roman
Catholics as Protestant Subjects, for defense of their houses in several
parts and in great numbers: They did also deliver to the five Counties of the
Pale Arms and Ammuniton for 1700 men for defense of those Countries, (although
your Majesty was no way bound to furnish them with arms for their own
defense) and some of those arms upon notice of the defection of those trusted
with them, were recovered and brought back, and the rest soon after employed
by the confederats to fight against your Majesty and your Armies: And for the
Cotholiques in the City of Dublin, of whose ancient fidelity (in the beginning
of this Rebellion) the Lords Justices and Counsel were fully persuaded; they
were not disarmed, till most of the Catholics of the Pale declared themselves
in open Rebellion against your Majesty, which the Lords Justices and Counsel
finding and considering that those Inhabitants of Dublin were for the most part
allied and matched with the gentry and considerable Inhabitants of the Pale,
That some of them sent daily intelligence to the Rebels, sent them provisions
of victuals and otherwise and sundry of them of good substance, went to the
Rebels with their goods, That great numbers of the Popish prentizes servants,
and Iournymen of the City went daily to the Rebels and joined with them, and
that daily rumors were spread in the City, as well by words, as by papers
scattered and found, that surprises and massacres were intended against your
Majesty's Subjects the Protestants of the City, then was it thought fit, and
not before, to disarme those Catholics the better to secure the City for your
Majesty, and quiet the Catholics who might well know that the strength of the
Protestants was their security, and from which Protestants, the Catholics
never found any violence offered (the Protestants profession abhorring such
wickedness) the Lords Justices and Counsel also sent arms and powder to
Drogheda; delivered arms and powder for zoo men to Wexford they sent powder to
Waterford, and gave them license to buy and import, powder and arms for their
defense, though afterward when they joined in the Rebellion the Lords Juces
and Counsel restrained it as much as they could. They sent powder to Trym,
they sent powder for Dondalke as far as Drogheda, where it was staid because
Dondalk was yielded up to the Rebels before it could come thither, they also
wrote letters to the several Towns of Wexford, Waterford, Gallway and
Drogheda commending their then seeming forward affections, and encouraging and
persuading to stand constantly in duty, and faith to your Majesty their Lord
and King: It is true that the Lords Justices and Counsel received an order of
both houses of Parliament in England, whereby they did commend to the Lord
Leivtenant or in his absence to the Lord Deputy, or Lords Justices according to
the power of their Commission to bestow your Majesty's gracious pardon to all
such as were seduced on false grounds, and within a convenient time to be
declared by their Lordships, should return to their due obedience: This Order
the Lords Justices and Counsel printed at Dublin forthwith after receipt
thereof the 12 of November 1641 and dispersed it into all parts of the Kingdom,
as far as they could to try whether it might work any relenting or
application of those confederated Catholics, to the Lords Justices and
Counsel to the end they might have further proceeded, to have obtevned a more
full direction for granting pardon, if that could have been likely to reclaim
any of them: The Lords Justices also found in their Commission and
instructions, no express warrant to pardon such pernicious Traitors, and that
in all late former pardons, Treasons against your Majesty and murder was
excepted, and they daily expected the old Levitenants coming over with more
ample authority, and direction, and considered also that on the 30 of October
before the Lords Justices and Counsel had by public Proclamation adventured
so far as to tender your Majesty's grace to all seduced Rebels whereupon none
then tendered themselves to the Lords Justices and Counsel, or any other your
Majesty's Officers, and afterward on the first day of November 1641 the Lords
Justices and Council foreseeing the danger that the Inhabitants of Mead,
Lungford, Westmeath and Lowth, who of the Pale lay next to the Northern
Rebels, might be first educed, either by strange rumors spread abroad, or by
the false enticement of the Clergy, and desirous to contain and preserve as
many of them as they could, did by public Proclamation (advised and drawn by
Mr. Plunket and others of the Commons house) admonish all that were not
Freeholders, nor having their hands in blood, within ten days to submit
themselves before any Justice of Peace or chief Officer of a Corporation, and
restore the Protestants goods which they had taken, and thereupon they should
be received to mercy whereupon a few submitted in the County of Mead but never
restored any thing, nor proceeded further to give satisfaction of their
loyalty, but soon after returned to their former defection and joined in the
said Rebellion; All which advisedly considered the Lords Justices and Counsel
thought not fit to prostitute your Majesty's royal grace to men so ungrateful
and deperded, for they plainly saw, that the confederacy and their persuasion
to carry all by force was so strong, as their actions gave no hope of any
inclinations to submit themselves to your Majesty's grace and mercy; No not
when your Majesty's Proclamation under your royal Signature, and privy signet
was sent amongst them; Commanding them to lay down Arms, nor until they of
the Pale, and the Irish of Vlster were beaten from Drogheda, and the seige
wholly raised which was about the beginning of March and that your Majesty's
Levitenant General of your army, was in the field with a strong force of foot
and horse, able to March where he pleased, in Mead, Lowth, and Dublin, ready
to burn and destroy their houses, and eize on the former owners thereof, if
they could be found; Then and not till then some, and those but very few of
Mead rendered themselves to the Leivtenant General of your Majesty's army who
received them as prisoners, and a few others of that County rendered themselves
at Dublin who were all imprisoned as was just, to so notorious and obstinate
offenders, And it were criminal in the Lords Justices and Counsel not to
commit them. Neither did the Lords Justices and Counsel aim at any of their
estates, but on the contrary always showed much regret, at the unnatural
defection of the pale, which had for the most part in other Rebellions stood
firm and loyal: And certainly they would have been most glad to have
preserved as many of them as they could, as well appeared in their readiness
to embrace the Earl of Westmeath and his Family, upon timely application
made, though the Lords Justices and Counsel had Intelligence of Northern
Rebels resorting to his house: They also upon Sir Morgan Cavanaghs false and
feigned Protestations permitted him to return to his house, in hope of his
good obedience, though they had cause to suspect his and hsi sons coming to
the Town on the 22. of October one thousand six hundred forty one. They
permitted Sir Luke Fitzgerald to depart quietly, because he came to them soon
after the beginning of the Rebellion, though the Protestant Tenants dwelling on
his land, were despoiled of all their substance, not without his privitie, as
since has appeared: They permitted Robert Harpoole of Frowle, and necre
Catherlogh, to depart upon his fair protestations, notwithstanding they had
intelligence of his former being with the Rebels; The Sheriff of Longford and
others of the Offarralls permitted back again, though informed to have joined
in pillaging of the Protestants, and many others in like manner, because the
Lords Justices thought fit to forbear all manner of strictness at first,
hoping they would not so far forget their duties, as afterward they all did,
and also diverse others about Dublin (who entertained Rebels (some perhaps of
necessity) were permitted to be at liberty by the Lords Justices, because they
desired to retain as many of them as they could, coming in any time, before
they had openly joined with the Rebels, and committed the horrible acts of
hostility, which put them out of the Lords Justices power to receive them,
without further allowance, and direction from your Majesty, which they writ
for, and desired to receive.

Touching Sir Charles Cootes journey into Wickloe, who with such a small force
of English and Irish, as the Lords Justices and Counsel could then raise, set
forth from Dublin on the 27. of November 1641. the design being to relieve
your Majesty's Castle of Wickloe, and one other only Castle kept by a subject,
but both besieged by Rebels: All the Irish of that County having many days
before risen in open Rebellion, surprised your Majesty's Fort of Cairis Fort,
Arckloe Fort, Chichester, and all the houses of the English in that County,
The Lord Esmonds house, and the adjacent parts of Wexford, robbed all the
British Protestants, threatened to assault Dublin, having robbed and preyed
within two miles thereunto, and committed all amnner of acts of hostility, as
is before particularized: He had also direction to kill and spoil by fire and
sword those Irish Rebels, so far as he could; But it is not true that any
there dicd by his command, save one woman one whose back, certain of the
Protestants spoils were found, and twelve or thirteen men, who were proved to
have committed the same rebellious acts, and such as fought with him in open
field, with Banners displayed, where the Rebels being, as he conceived a
thousand strong, were by him routed, and put to flight; Neither could that
journey any way terrify those of the Pale, or give them occasion of suspicion
of any violence intended against them, being principally intended to prevent
incursions and spoils of the Irish to be committed on them as they had in
former times often done: and against whom they had with much effusion of blood,
often defended themselves: yet now so plainly appears their preceded general
conspiracy in this Rebellion, as they are not abashed, (despising the honor
of their birth, and loyalty to your Majesty) to profess sense of those
Rebels sufferings, and to mention your Majesty's just vengeance taken on those
ancient, and in all former, and later ages, and now declared Rebels and
Traitors, as one of their motives to take up Arms, or at least to stand on
their guard, as they call it: Touching the Act of Santry three miles from
Dublin, seeming to work so much upon the Remonstrants, as to put them into
open rebellion against your Majesty, as if they could resolve of a general
Rebellion in all the Kingdom in twenty four hours; It is fit to open the
truth of this supposed fearful, and as may be said miraculous accident, being
of force almost to raise a whole County into Arms in one day against your
Majesty, and your peaceable subjects; though the said County (during six
weeks after the conspiracy against the Castle of Dublin, and the state, was
discovered and prevented) did not seem able (or rather being unwilling) by all
fair persuasions of the Lords Justices and Counsel used to them, to put
themselves into a posture of defense, against the Rebels of Vlster, to find
any Arms to arm their men, or agree upon Captains to command them,
notwithstanding they had upon the twenty two of November after several
invitations thereunto received out of your Majesty's stores, Arms, and all
other Munition for three hundred men; And not withstanding that the Lords
Justices and Council in October 1641. wrote Letters to the several Counties
of the Pale to name their Captains, gather their men, and fetch out their
Arms, which they deferred, sometimes seeming desirous to have all things
agreed on in Parliament, which they knew could not then meet, and sometimes
upon other pretenses: And notwithstanding that they saw the inferior people of
those Counties formerly to rise in multitudes to murder, rob and spoil, the
British and Protestant Inhabitants amongst them, without resistance or
control; And in particular they had murdered Derrick Hubbert, a Protestant
Gentleman in his own house, and some others of his family in the County of
Dublin; And about ten miles from Dublin, besides many other so used in other
parts, and had spoiled Protestants in several Villages within three or four
miles of Dublin, in Fingall, where the Remonstrants do say the Inhabitants had
felt no wars or troubles for four hundred years before, yet could Luke
Nettervile, son to the Lord Nettervile, who dwelt but seven miles from
Dublin, in that County of Fingall, and the other Gentry of that County Arm
and Muster at Swoards (about six miles from Dublin (about twelve hundred men on
the seventh day of December 1641. to affront your Majesty's Authority, upon
this only accident (as they allege) to the killing of four Catholics, (or
supposed Catholics) because called Catholics (as they would have it) and
for no other cause, or reason, at Santry aforesaid; On Tuesday at night the
fifth day of December by some Troops of horse, and foot Companies marched out
of Dublin, by direction (as the Remonstrants pretend) of the Lords Justices and
Counsel, and their (supposed) party, which party the Remonstrants would
as well have named, if any such they had known, (for no such party was then
heard of, unless they mean your Majesty's Counsel;) And before that time
they suffered the Rebel Collonell Hugh Birne, and many of the mountain and
Wickloe Rebels to enter into that Country and spoil the British and
Protestants, which they had power to hinder, and might have done, if they had
not been of the Confederacy. Whereas the truth of that accident is, That on
the said fifth day of December, intelligence being brought to a Lieutenant in
Dublin, That his informer could bring him upon some of those that had murdered
the said Derrick Hubbert, and robbed and spoiled other Protestnats as
aforesaid: He by allowance of his Captain (as he afterward upon examination
declared,) without the privity or command of the Lords Justices, or any of the
Counsel, or any other Commander authorized to that purpose, took with him
forty soldiers that night, in pursuit of those murderers, and other
Malefactors, and coming to Santry, he found there four persons lately come
thither, with such Arms as they could get in the Country, whom he slew in the
place, and who as he was informed, were offenders; And after this done, he
passed somewhat further into the Country, Note, there were many Papists then
dwelling in that Town whom he did not hurt.
in search of the rest of the Malefactors, but could not find them, there
having issued no other Troops of horse or foot: This rash act was the next day
voyced in Dublin, and the Lords Justices and Counsel hearing of it, sent for
the said Lieutenant, who upon examination justified the Act, affirming them to
be Rebels, And no man prosecuting the matter against him, it there rested.

And as to the rest of the particulars in this Article pretended to be motives
to the Rebellion of the Pale, and the other parts of Leinster (whereas before
that several parts of Leinster, and many in the Pale, were in open Rebellion,
as shall herein further appear; True it is that about the later end of
November 1641. The said Luke Nettervile without any Warrant for the same,
caused Proclamation to be made in the Market place at Luske, (about twelve
miles from Dublin) That all the Gentry of the Country upon pain of death,
should within three or four days after, meet at Swoards, within six miles of
Dublin, which was before the killing at Santry, which meeting was held, and
there the said Nettervile of his own authority made everall Captains ( viz.)
Richard Golding, Thomas Russell, Francis Russell, Robert Travers, Christopher
Hollywood, Peter Cru^^, and Michael Murphy, and others, many of them men of
estate, and the rest branches of the Gentry, and there commanded them to be
with their Companies armed at the same Town of Swoards on the seventh day of
December following, (which was a short time for such a levy, if they had not
been formerly combined and prepared to that Summons;) They observed it as fast
as they could, many of them coming thither on the seventh day of December
aforesaid, and on the eighth day of the said month they were there gathered
together in bands about one thousand two hundred men armed, (as was informed to
the Lords Justices and Counsel,) Their Lordships therefore on the ninth day of
December aforesaid, sent a Warrant to the said Nettervile and the rest, in
mild manner, signifying to them the unseasonablenesse of the time chosen for
such an act, that howsoever a construction might be made thereof to their
disadvantage, yet their Lordships were unwilling to make an indulgent
interpretation of their actions, in regard of their good opinion they had of
their loyalty, and conceiving there was some mistake in that enterprise, they
did choose rather to command them on their duty of allegiance forthwith to
separate themselves and no more to unite in that manner, without direction from
their Lordships. And that the said Nettervile and six others of the principal
of them, should appear before their Lordships the then next morning, to show
cause for their so assembling, and thereof not to fail at their extreme
perils; All which notwithstanding, the said Nettervile and the rest, did
neither separate, nor any of them appear as was commanded, but holding the
Messenger, as in restraint that night, did on the enxt day write a mutinous
Letter to the Lords Justices and Counsel acknowledging the receipt of the said
Warrant, and setting forth their fears, by reason of the said killing at
Santry, and other rumors of unexpected attempts, and desired to be secured of
their lives, which security was also granted them, but they despised it. Their
intention being from another root, and of a higher nature then to meet in
merriment in a Market town and shake hands: These men continued at Swoards,
and other Villages thereabouts, till about the tenth of January following,
robbing, spoiling, and imprisoning all your Majesty's Subjects, that either
lived thereabouts, or that offered to pass that way, being the road to
Drogheda, then straightly besieged, and soffering no provisions to be brought to
Dublin that way, threatening also daily to assault Dublin on the North side from
thence, and from other great Companies of the same confederacy, out of
Wickloe, and Kildare, settled on the South side of the City, performing like
hostile acts, and giving out on all sides, that they would have Mass in
Christ-Church of Dublin, on Christmas day next after: All which time the Lords
Justices and Counsel were nor able to send sufficient forces against them.

About the fourteenth day of that December, those Rebels being increased in
numbers from other parts, sent two several strong parties to Santry and
Finglas, where they continued till the twenty second of the same December, when
they were beaten thence by your Majesty's Forces; Neither of which two places
are above three miles from Dublin, there to be the more ready to annoy and set
upon the City, when the rest of the parties to the design might be ready,
which near approaches much straightened all things in the City: On the same
fourteenth day of December, those Rebels at Swoards sent another party to
Clantarffe, about a mile and half from Dublin, which Village belonged to
George King, who lay in garrison with the said Nettervile at Swoards, and whose
hand was to their Answer formerly mentioned: And there gathering together from
the other Villages on the Sea side, about three hundred men, they showed
themselves on a high ground near Clantarfe, to the open view of the City;
those Inhabitants being furnished with store of strong fisher-boates, and
having a few days before robbed and spoiled, two English Barks lying at
Anchor, near Clantarfe, in the road of Dublin, and threatening by themselves
and other Rebels which lay on the South side of the harbor, (where Irish
Boats also were) to seize on all the shipping in the harbor, and either burn
them, or make use of them to block up the harbor, so to cut off all access
to that Port which the Lords Justices and Counsel much feared, having then no
shipping of strength there; Thereupon their Lordships found it of necessity to
adventure on some of those parties to try if they could disperse them, And
therefore they considered that those at Santry and Finglas, came thither by
open force; That those lands belonged to honest subjects who had not then
offended; That the forementioned outrageous act was committed by those at
Clantarfe, And that the lands belonged to one in open hostility, who had given
assistance or countenance to the aforesaid rebellious act of robbing the
Barks, and of robbing other your Majesty's Protestant subjects passing that
way, and judging that that place and party threatened most danger, in respect of
the harbor, And lest other Fishermen, on that coast (who for the most part
joined with the Rebels,) should take encouragement to come and strengthen
their design against the shipping and harbor, considering also that by the
assistance of those Coasters, the Rebels of the County of Dublin, had formerly
on the third day of December 1641. robbed an English Bark at Skirries, about
twelve miles from Dublin, and that the goods were divided amongst the Gentry
thereabouts, the principal part thereof being magazined at the Castle of
Master Barnewell of Brimore, a prime man, and some of the English carried
prisoners to the Lord of Gormanston, who sent them Prisoners to Balrothry;
Thereupon the Lords Justices and Counsel did order, that the Lieutenant
general of the Army should and men against them at Clantarfe, who accordingly
did (on the fifteenth day of that December) send out Sir Charles Coote, with
such a party as could be spared, to fall on those men at Clantarfe, with
direction that if they could beat them, to burn that Village, and either
destroy or bring away all the Boats. This was well performed by Sir Charles,
who killed some of the Rebels in the place, and put the rest to flight, where
he then found, as well in the house of the said King as other houses in the
Town, diverse of the goods taken out of the said two Barks, robbed at
Clantarfe; And by this means was stricken off much of that danger; And to the
end it may further appear, That the Lords of the Pale, especially of Mead,
were in the same Confederacy with the Rebels at Swoards, and other parts of
Leinster, and not forced to take up Arms for their own safety, nor fearing to
be murdered by any under the command of the Lords Justices and Counsel, as
in the Remonstrance is maliciously and scandalously urged: the Lords Justices
and Counsel seeing dangers thus multiplied on all sides, receiving Letters of
intelligence from all parts of rebellious Acts done, and hearing many strange
rumors of the general combination before the said meeting at Swoards, or
killing at Santry; (robberies and spoils being before that time committed on
the English in every County in Leinster) Their Lordships thereupon desired, in
their great distress, to have the advice and assistance of those Lords of the
Pale, in whose fidelity they formerly much confided, as appears by their
comfortable expression thereof, in October before, as well to the then Lord
Lieutenant in England, as to your Majesty's principal Secretary, the effect
whereof appeared in the Parliametn order sent thither thereupon soon after,
and printed the twelfth of November 1641. wherein they declared that they
conceived the Massacre was intended as well against your Majesty's good
Subjects, Ancient Inhabitants of English blood, though of the Romish Religion
(who have in former Rebellions given testimony of their fidelity to the
Crown of ENGLAND) as against the Protestants, and that they intended to move
your Majesty for the encouragement of those English or Irish, that should raise
Horse or Foot against the Rebels, that they should be honorably rewarded:
and therefore on the third of the same December, the Lords Justices and
Counsel did write several Letters unto those, and other Lords in and near
Dublin, to meet together with the Lords Justices and Counsel at Dublin, the
eighth day of the same month, to the end they might confer with those Lords,
concerning the present state of the Kingdom, and the safety thereof and
specially of the City of Dublin, in those times of danger, to this the Earl
of Fingall, and the Lords of Gormanston, Slane, Dunsany, Nettervile, Lowth, and
Trimletstowne by their Letter dated the seventh of the same December answered:
That they had cause to conceive their loyalty was suspected, and that they had
received advertisement that Sir Charles Coote at the Connsell Board, had
uttered some speeches tending to a purpose and resolution to execute upon those
of their Religion a general Massacre, whereby they were deterred to come, not
having security for their lives, but rather thought fit to stand on their
guard till they might hear from the Lords Justices and Counsel, how they
should be secured (They well knowing that the Lords Justices and Counsel had
no force, or having force had no intent to hurt them, unless much greater
cause appeared) in which Letter they did mention the killing at Santry, which
it seems they had not then heard of, and could not take that for a ground of
their rebellion as now they urge, and so they did forbear to come as they were
required, but the Earl of Kildare, the Lords Fitzwilliams and Houth, came at
the day appointed, with whom Conference was had; Thereupon the Lords Justices
and Counsel desirous and laboring by all the means they could, to clear all
erroneous conceptions in those Lords, and to prevent their hurt, by any
undutifull resolutions, and as much as they might to provide against any breach
with them, least thereby greater extremities might be drawn upon them, and
the Rebels at Swoards might be raised, in stomach, did print and publish a
Declaration dated the thirteenth day of the same December, and sent it those
Noblemen therein positively affirming, That the Lords Justices and Counsel did
never hear Sir Charles Coote or any other, utter at the Council board or
elsewhere any such speeches tending to a purpose or resolution to execute upon
those of their profession or upon any other, a general Massacre, and that that
board, never intended or meant to dishonor your Majesty or that State, or
wound their own consciences, by harboring the least thought of so odious,
impious, and detestable a thing, upon any persons whatsoever; And that they
were had would be ready to inflict due punishment upon any man against whom
proof shall be made of speaking the same: therein likewise requiring those
Lords to attend the Lords Justices and Counsel at the Board, on the
seventeenth day of the same month of December. Thereby also giving to those
Lords, and every of them the word and assurance of the State, for their safe
repair to the Board, without danger of any trouble or stay whatsoever, of or
from the Lords Justices and Counsel, or any under their Command, who never had
intention to wrong or hurt them: neither in truth did they fear any such
massacre, there having never been any such thing attempted against Papists
either in England, Scotland, or Ireland, notwithstanding their difference in
Religion, and the Protestants provoked by many strange plots in former times;
The same thirteenth day also of December, the Lords Justices and Counsel,
printed and sent to the said Luke Nettervile, and the rest at Swoards their
manifest setting forth the truth of the aforesaid action at Santry, and that
they had no knowledge of it till it was done, and their readiness to give
redress, it upon prosecution there were cause either at the Board, or at a
Counsel of War, therein also laying before them their high and unsufferable
Contempt in not separating according to former Command, declaring also, that
there was no intent or purpose against the lives of them or any other your
Majesty's good Subjects, Protestants or Papists who were not actors or abettors
in the traitorous murders and robberies lately committed, but that their care
and endeavor always was, and should be, to cherish and preserve all your
Majesty's good Subjects, of what profession soever, requiring them again forth
with to separate and forbear further terror and annoyance to your Majesty's
good Subjects, and therein the Lords Justices and Counsel, required the said
Luke Nettervile and the rest who formerly signed the Letler, to appear before
them at the Counsel board, on the eighteenth day of the said month, where
they should receive due hearing: and further gave unto them and every of them,
the word and the assurance of the state, as to their persons, for their safe
repair unto them without any trouble or stay from them whatsoever: and that
they had no intention to wrong or hurt any of them, all which notwithstanding,
they did not separate, but on the contrary sent men to Clantarfe, as aforesaid,
which gave the Lords Justices and Counsel full assurance, that they were
resolved to run on, according to their rebellious beginnings, and so
necessitated their Lordships to attempt them at Clantarfe, as is before
related, and this as is conceived will appear sufficient to vindicate the
Lords Justices and Counsel from any just cause given of such malicious and
scandalous imputation of faith breaking, and otherwise, as in their
remonstrance is pressed, and from the guilt of such provocations to the said
Nobility and Gentry of the Pale, and other parts of Leinster to put themselves
in posture of defense, against the State and other your Majesty's Protestant
subjects: Whereas on the other side those Lords and Gentry had most apparent
cause to do the same against their Confederates of Vlster, who (as they
pretended) so much terrified them, yet being most true, that while they joined
with the State in former times, the Earl of Tyrone in all his strength durst
never attempt them: besides, is has been since made evident, partly by
discoveries made, and examinations taken of notorious acts committed, and
partly in that many of the Inhabitants in several parts of the Pale, and other
adjacent Counties, and generally all the Irish inhabitants in Vlster, and many
in some Counties of Connaught had declared themselves Confederates, or
committed open rebellious acts and cruelties against your Majesty, and your
Protestant Subjects before the above mentioned killing at Santry, (which was
the first act, favoring of force offered and that but pretended to be offered
by the Lords Justices and Counsel, to those of the Pale, or any of them,) viz.
on the 23. of October 1641. and so daily after all the Irish of the Province of
Vlster, viz. in the Counties of Cavan, Fermanagh, Donegall Tyrone, London
Derry, Ardmagh, Monaghane, and most part of the County of Down, and the County
of Leitrim, with part of the County of Sligo, and many of the County of
Roscomon in Connaught declared themselves in open rebellion, and committed the
acts of murders, and cruelties elsewhere mentioned.

And to show that the common people as well as the chief Conspirators were
acquainted with the maine plot in the chief part thereof, it now appears by
very many examinations that on the twenty three of October 1641 the Rebels of
Vlster, and in Leytrim, generally told the Protestants whom they robbed that
the Castle of Dublin was taken, howsoever they formerly concealed the plot on
the thirtieth of October 1641. the Irish of the County of Longford next
adjoining to Mead, and Westmeath, began to murder and rob and spoil all the
British and Protestants among them, the Sheriff also of that County a prime
man of the Farrels soon after joined in the action, and on the second of
November the Lords Justices and Counsel did write to Sir James Dillon uncle to
the Lord of Costilo to employ against those Rebels of Longford and others in
Cavan 2000 men which he had gathered together under pretense to carry them into
Spain, he liked not of that motion, notwithstanding he had by former letters
offered the service of those men, but soon after employed them against your
Majesty and your forces, notwithstanding he had lately at his own suite
received Arms and Ammunition for fifty men foot and horse, for his own
defense. On the last day of October 1641 the town of Dundalke in the County of
Lowth in the Pale, wherein was a Company of the old Army, was yielded up to the
Rebels without stroke, and your Majesty's Arms lost, against which neither
Shane O Neale (with whom all the Irish of Vlster, and many other Irish joined)
could prevail by assault nor the Earl of Tyrone with all his strength, (being
other ways provided then Sir Phelomy O Neale both in numbers of trained men
and arms) durst ever attempt it, seldom gain a few Cattle from it, though he
lay often within two miles of it, their faith then sufficiently arming them
against the stoutest Rebels, and Drogheda had bin yielded up within few days,
had not Sir Henry Titchburne come thither about the fourth day of November,
about that time also was the town of Atherdy in the County of Lowth so yielded
up to the rebels, before the end of October and about the beginning of
November 1641 many of the inferior inhabitants in the bordering parts of the
County of Mead in the Pale, especially the inhabitants of Kells robbed and
spoiled the British and Protestants, with whom also some of the gentry joined,
the rest looked on: about the same time also they did the same about Trym, in
the heart of Mead in the County of Westmeath, also in the Pale, they did the
same about the same time. Upon the tenth day of November 1641 the Lord of Lowth
having formerly received Commission from the Lords Justices and Counsel to
command the forces in the County of Lowth, came and delivered up his
Commission, pretending offense that Sir Christopher Bellew was joined with him
in command, and soon after went into Rebellion: On the twelfth day of the same
November all the Irish of the County of Wickloe which adjoined on the South
side to the County of Dublin entered into open Rebellion and murdered robbed,
and spoiled all the British and Protestants in that County, burnt and pulled
down all their fair English buildings and preyed and robbed within two miles
of the City of Dublin on the sixteenth day of the same November they surprised
and forced your Majesty's fort called Carisfort in the County of Wickloe. On
the one and twentieth of the same November the Irish of the Counties of Wexford
and Catherlagh entered into rebellion and joined with those of Wiikloe; they
seized on the Lord Esmonds house and all other the late undertakers buildings
in Wexford, and murdered, robbed and spoiled all the British and Protestants,
on the hither side of that County of Wexford, and spoiled the British and
Protestants in most parts of the County of Catherlagh. Before the fifteenth of
November the Irish in some parts of the Queens County, and Kings County robbed
and spoiled the British and Protestants there, and defaced their houses, from
which time forwards they proceeded to growt o great numbers robbing and
spoiling the British and Protestants wheresoever they came. On the twenty
fourth of the same November all the old English and other inhabitants in the
County of Lowth (one of the five shires in the Pale) joined with the Northern
rebels in pen rebellion, and with them also joined the Sheriff John Bellew who
was formerly sent into England privately in some negotiation concerning the
Parliament of Ireland and returned thither again in February 1640, many of the
Inhabitants of that County had also formerly spoiled and robbed most of the
British and Protestants in that County of Lowth, and defaced their houses,
which Country being full of old Castles was formerly defended against all Irish
insurrections, and the Inhabitants might now easily have done the like, against
those barbarous and raw men of Vlster, if the former confederacy had not
wrought amongst them, and if their old fidelity had remained in them: about
that time was Sir Phelomy Oneale made general of the Catholic Armies, as
they then called them in the Provinces of Vlster and Mead, a County of the
Pale, On the same four and twentieth day of November 1641 was the house of the
Lord Moore, called Mellifont three miles from Drogheda, surprised, and taken by
those rebels and many men murdered there in cold, blood: About the same time
also intelligence came from several parts to the Lords Justices and Counsel
that many more younger brothers and sons of the gentry and their servants and
most of the inferior Inhabitants of the County of Mead beyond the river of
Boyne and many on this side that river, and many in the County of Dublin on
that side the County next Mead, had robbed and spoiled all the British and
Protestants amongst them, and many such acts were freely done within few miles
of Dublin the prime gentry most of them Justices of the peace, looking on in
all places and giving way to those hateful actions, and no course taken to
resist or repress any of those insolences, notwithstanding the Commissions of
government and of Marshall Law given to many of themselves as is before
mentioned. On the 22 of the same November, great numbers of the Northern
Rebels, (having without touch passed the County of Lowth) showed themselves on
the North side of Drogheda: On the 26 and 27 of the same November, great number
of the Northern Rebels were lodged in Slane, the Mansion of the Lord of Slane,
in the heart of Mead, and possessed themselves of that bridge, the chief
passage into the hither part of that County, and the County of Dublin: by
examination it appears, that on the same 27 of November at night, the Lord of
Gormanstons Groom was sent, and raised those Rebels out of their beds, to
encountrr the six hundred Foot sent by the Lords Justices, and Council toward
Drogheda, for further strengthening of that Town, with whom the 28 day of the
same November, the same Northern Rebels and others met and defeated the said
six hundred men, near Julianstowne (being undisciplined men newly aaised) and
took their Arms; about the end of that November, great numbers of the Irish,
and some of the old English of the Counties of Wexford, Kilkenny, and
Catherlagh passed over in boats into the County of Waterford in Munster, and
there committed murders, and great spoils and rapin on the British and
Protestants in that County, and sent over great numbers of Cattle, and other
spoil, about the beginning of December 1641. And in part of November before,
many of the inferior Inhabitants, and some of the Gentry, made the like spoil
of the British and Protestants in the County of Kildare: About the same time,
very many of the old English and Irish, were in rebellion about Rosse and
Wexford, in the County of Wexford: Before this time also they had public Mass
in many Churches in the Counties of Mead and Dublin: And about the 27 of
November aforesaid, the walled Town of Trym, in the heart of Mead, was seized
on by the Rebels, and many of your Majesty's Subjects murdered there: About
the beginning of that December, were the British and Protestants in the County
of Kilkenny, robbed and spoiled by the Gentry, and Irish Inhabitants, Papists
of that County: and in the same month, the Lord Mountgarret having drawn a
strength of Irish Armed into the City of Kilkenny, stood by, while the English
there dwelling, and such as came thither for safety were spoiled and pillaged:
On the 1 and 2 day of December aforesaid, the Northern Rebels in great
numbers were lodged and entertained in the strong Castle and Village of Platten
in Mead, on this side the Boyne, about two miles from Drogheda, belonging to
Nicholas Darcy Esquire: About the last of November, or the first of December
aforesaid, the Northern Rebels, and those of the Lowth, and Mead in the Pale
who assisted them, were set down in Leaguer round about Drogheda, on both
sides the River; against whom the Inhabitants of Mead or Dublin made no manner
of resistance: About the 4 day of the same Dublin met with the Northern Rebels
at the Hill of Crofty al' Grofty, not far from Drogheda; the manner of whose
intercourse was this, the Lords and Gentry of the Pale, being on the said Hill
of Crofty, the Northern Rebels lay in great numbers near the Hill, and espying
the said Lords and Gentry, some of the Northern Commanders came to them,
thereupon the Lord of Gormanston in the Name of the Lords and Gentlemen,
demanded of the Rebels wherefore they came in that hostile manner into the
Pale, whereunto answer was made by Rowry O Moore (called a Colonel among the
Rebels) in name of the rest, that they came for the free exercise of the
Catholic Religion, to restore the King to his Prerogative, and to give the
Subjects of Ireland the like freedom, as the Subjects of England had:
thereupon the Lord of Gormanston said if those were the true grounds of their
war, they (meaning the Lords and Gentry of the Pale) would join with them;
and so the said Lords and Gentry, and the said Rebels struck hands. It is also
testified, that certain days before this general meeting, diverse prime
Gentry of Mead, and the chief Officers of the Rebels, had a meeting at
Duleeke, on this side the Boyne in Mead; and that a few days after this
meeting at Crofty aforesaid, all the Lords and Gentry of Mead, and diverse of
the Northern Rebels had another meeting at the Hill of Taragh in Mead, where
they determined on the maintenance of the Northern Rebels, during the Siege,
and what provision of Beeves and Corn should be raised on the Country, for
every hundred of the said Rebels, which was done accordingly by their Warrants;
the Sheriff of that County called Nicholas Dowdall (who was with them in
Rebellion) obeying them in all things. And soon after another meeting, the said
Lords and Gentry made choice of new Generals of Foot and Horse, and other
Officers of the Field, and Captains in that County, and appointed who should
be chief Commanders in each Barony, and what number of men should be raised
and maintained out of each Plow land in that County of Mead, as well to join
in the Siege, as to fight with any other your Majesty's Armies, which were
conceived to amount to two thousand men; whereas in six weeks before, at the
instance of the Lords Justices, and Council, they could or would not raise
five hundred men for the defense of the County against the Rebels, which with
seeming great Forwardness they at first promised to do; and for whom five
hundred Arms with Munition answerable was appointed by the Lords Justices, and
Council, and the Arms sent as far as Gormanston, and there kept till upon
notice of the Rebels coming into the Country, the Lords Justices, and
Council, suddenly convaied them to Drogheda, which the Lord of Gormanston
pretends to be done by his monition: Though the truth is, the Lords Justices
had that morning, before he declared it, sent away to have it done that night,
otherwise they had been taken, and he thinking that the Lords Justices, and
Council could not so soon remove them, and presuming besides (in case they were
so removed) to have them within a few days in Drogheda (whether he moved they
might be convayed) by taking that Town, whereof he little doubted: About the
beginning of November aforesaid, Arms and Munition for three hundred men, were
by the Lords, Justices, and Council, delivered to three Captains appointed
for the Guard of the County of Kildare: And on the 2 of December aforesaid, the
whole Company of Mr. Nicholas White, eldest Son of Sir Nicholas White, did
run away with their Arms to the Rebels, and so did the other two Captains,
and their Companies soon after, and then did the Gentry and Inhabitants of the
said County of Kildare appoint Officers of the Field, and Captains for the
Catholic Army. All which particulars are here specified, together with the
times of each action (as many others might be mentioned) to the end that it
appearing in what ease the Pale, and other parts of Leinster stood, before the
killing at Santry, and burning at Clantarfe, your Majesty may the more clearly
see the vanity and malignity of the Confederates, in pretending to be terrified
into Arms by those acts (which they well know were subsequent to their taking
Arms) and by their other devised Provocations in England and Ireland, no truer
then the former. And it is observable, that in the beginning of the
Remonstrance, they in express and plain terms do affirm that they at
first, were necessitated to take Arms for preservation of their Religion, the
maintenance of your Majesty's Rights and Prerogatives, and defense of their
Lives, Estates, and Liberties, of the danger whereof there was not then so much
as a shadow, beside their general avowment of their acts in Vlster, in the
beginning of the rebellion, as done by authority, which was most false, and so
afterward acknowledged by them, and to the end it may appear to all the world,
that the Lords, Justices, and Council, did not draw your Majesty's sword upon
jealousies or presumptions, till the highest extremities, and acts committed
compelled them, nor till the innumerable murders, spoils, and outrages
committed on the British and Protestants in so many places, without stop or
restraint by any of the Lords or Gentry; nor till the horrid defamation of your
Sacred Majesty, nor till it fully appeared, that all was done by Conspiracy
and Design, there being a wide difference between malicious design and
Profession to do evil, and confession of acts done perhaps necessitated, or
by seducement.

And as to the Remonstrants unjust complaint of stopping Lieutenant Colonel
Note that this Read is now Sir John Read, For he being examined in Ireland, by
the State there as a plotter of that Rebellion was after-ward sent over hither,
and committed for High Treason; Who to escape his Condign punishment, broke
prison, went to Oxford and was there Knighted, and is now gone back into Ireland
Read, whom they say they employed to your Majesty, with Remonstrance of the
state of their Affairs; The truth of the matter stands thus, In the foresaid
month of December, four Lords, and three Gentletlemen of the County of Mead,
framed a Petition to your Majesty of some particulars concerning them,
intending (as they told Lieutenant Colonel Read) to send him with it to your
Majesty, but deferred it for that time, presuming on their strength, to win
their ends another way, and on the weak estate of your Majesty's Forces to
oppose.

And when several times the said Lieutenant Collonell Read, moved them to be
sent away; They whiled it off (it is Reads own phrase) and the Lord Gormanston
said that there would be time enough for that matter, all which the said
Lieutenant Collonell Read declared on his Examination, after his coming to the
Lords Justices and Council in the beginding of March 1641. when he delivered
the draught of the Petition, amongst other papers, but did not say, he was
then sent by them, or desired to be sent on that business: And to make this
more manifest, the said Licutenant Collonell Read, on the tenth day of January
1641. wrote to the Lords Justices for their pass into England, not mentioning
any employment from the Remonstrnats, or any of them, to whom their Lordships
wrote that they desired to confer with him before his going into England, and
wished him to repair unto them, to the end they might confer with him, and
consider of his request, but he would not come, nor any other ways make known
any other employment or trust he had for the said Remonstrant: By all which it
is manifest, their abusive tax on the Lords Justices, and Council, in stopping
or hindering their Petition, by Lieutenant Collonell Read, or his pretended
employment for them. And for the racking of the said Lieutenant Collonell Read,
it was not without president, it being for the discovery of things that might
highly concern the safety of your Majesty's Kingdom, and good people there.

To the tenth Article.
THe Lords Justices did never give any such direction to the Lord President of
Munster, Art. 10.
as in this Article is most untruely offered, much less would they do it,
while the Province stood quiet, the peace whereof they by all means sought to
provide for, neither would he have obeyed any such unrighteous and half
command, himself being a Native of the Kingdom, allied amongst the old
English and Irish, and in all things lovingly affected to the people, so long
as they by any means could be contained in duty, neither was he provided
wantonly to make a war, being soon after driven to great extremity by their
unprovoked disloyalty: True it is, that from the 23 of October 1641. till about
the end of November following, that Province of Munster stood in appearance
quiet, whereof he from time to time advertized the Lords Justices, and
Council, and from them he received several expressions by many Letters, of
their great joy and comfort to find that people so well disposed: and as the
Lord President signified to them the constancy or merit of any particular
person, the Lords Justices and Council wrote Letters of thanks and
encouragement to them, specially they wrote to the Lord of Muskery, (whom the
said Lord President had used with all civility, trust, and respect from time to
time) acknowledging his zeal in your Majesty's service, and giving him thanks
for it in your Majesty's behalf, praying and requiring him to apply himself to
the Lord President, and be advised and directed by him, for his own future
good, and the safety of the Country; whose concurrence if he had continued
loyal, as he stood obliged by his several corporal oaths, to the said Lord
President, would have availed much to the general peace: The same was done to
others, both to the Nobility and Gentry of that Province, so far was it from
the Lords Justices to irritate, or grieve any of them with passionate or
needless cruelty, neither was there any violence offered to any person of what
profession, sex, age, or condition soever in all that time in that province.
The Lord President rather blamed the Lords Justices and Council for their
mild course toward the Rebels of other parts, not thinking the Conspiracy to
be such as they found it, and thinking a sharp persecution would soon quell
it, wherein he both mistook their general combination (which he after found)
and the Lords Justices inability to set upon it with that vigor that had been
requisite: The Lords Justices and Council also sent him directions to
authorize prime men in each County to Command the forces of the County, and
sent him Commissions for martial Law to be given to men of quality of the
Natives, and others of purpose to settle the peace of the Country, and prevent
rebellion if it might be.

The first occasion that necessitated him to use force, was about the beginning
of December, 1641. when the Rebels of Wexford, Kilkenny, and Katherlagh came
over the River, to prey and spoil in the County of Waterford before mentioned,
whither he made have to encounter them, and whom, though he was far inferior
in number, he discomfited, and slew many of them, and executed others, and
recovered much of the spoil, which he caused to be restored to the owners: In
this action he found many of his Provincialls, to whom he suffered no hurt to
be done, supposing they came thither for saving their goods, not then
believing the Conspiracy to be such, as soon after he found it. The second
disturbance which he heard of, was in the County of Tipperary, where Mr.
Purcell, called the Baron of Loghmo, had stirred, and set on the Irish in great
numbers, to rob and spoil the British, and Protestants, which they arrogantly
did; thither he went the ninth of December aforesaid, with such small forces of
the English, as he then had (for he then wrote he found cause to trust very
few Papists) and there finding where the spoils were made, he pursued
therebels, and such as he found in the act, and the Protestants Cattle in their
hands, he slew, and executed and burnt two or three Villages, hoping by that
quick course to stay and terrify others; There he rescued great store of
Cattle of all sorts to the owners; soon after did the Inhabitants of all sorts
rise into rebellion in several parts of the Provinces, and before the end of
that December did all the Irish and Old English Papists in the County of
Tipperary, and Limberick forsake their Allegiance, and with them joined many
prime men and others our of Ostery, and other parts of Leinster, and murdered,
spoiled and ransacked all the English and Protestants upon these extremities;
he had by warrant of the Lords Justices and Council raised a thousand Foot and
some Troops of Horse, but wanted Arms for most of them, which the Lords
Justices were not able to furnish (having delivered to the Lords and Gentry of
the Pale, and others in Leinster for their defense, as many as possibly could
be spared) so as he was in a very ill condition, till some forces arrived there
out of England, which was in February, 1641. And then, and not before did the
Lords Justices and Council require the Lord President to prosecute those
wilful Rebels with fire and sword (as was fit) so far as he was able: The
Rebellion afterward increased upon him in all parts, and when about the end of
February he published and showed to so many prime men as he could, your
Majesty's gracious Proclamation, under your Royal signature and Privy Signet,
for laying down Arms, they rejected it, some saying it was counterfeit,
others, that it was done by coertion. By all which fully appears, both that
noble Gentleman's moderation, and the Lords Justices and Councels avoiding all
unjust Provocation, at least that they were not set upon those ways of
unreasonable cruelty, unjustly charged on them by the Remonstrance, and that
those Inhabitants were not forced to stand on their defense, his case being
only to defend himself against them if he could, which with great hazard of
himself, and your Majesty's affairs in that Province he was driven unto,
considering his weakness in men, and other means, and their excessive
numbers, rebelliously gathered together, and armed by a long Provision
underhand, and furnished with the wealth of all the British, and Protestants,
being very great in that Province, which they suddenly and traitorously seized
upon. Touching Connaught the report must be far different from that of
Munster, although the Remonstrants say it was used in the like measure, which
shows that they are the same in bold affirmation, howsoever the probability or
case differs: When this Rebellion began, the Lord President of that Province
was in Dublin, and saw the moderate and winning course used, and intended
toward those of the Pale and Leinster, by the Lords Justices and Council,
about the beginning of November following, he went toward Connaught, where at
his coming to Athlone, he found much disorder in the Province, he found very
many of the inferior Irish, and some of the Gentry in rebellion, in the
Counties of Roscomon, and Sligo, and that they had murdered, robbed, and
spoiled the British and Protestants dwelling among them; he entered into a
fair course of Treaty and persuasion with the prime men of the several
Counties not then in rebellion, presuming in some alliance, and former private
friendship and interest amongst them, which prevailed little, as he after
found: He had no strength to resist them, there being but one Troop and a
half of Horse (most Irish) in the Province, whereof he could make little or
no use: And six half Companies of Foot, whereof one was surprised, and lost
their Arms, and one drawn away to Dublin, and the rest so dispersed, and
engaged in Leytrim, then totally in Rebellion, as he could make little or no
use of them: by which appears, he was in no case to use cruelty against the
people, or put them to defense, nor so much as rescue the poor British and
Protestants in their goods out of the hands of the ravenous Rebelst neither
were the Protestant Inhabitants of that Province any way able to defend
themselves, being not armed, against such swarms as assaulted them: The Lords
Justices, and Council sent down Commissions of government, to the prime
Natives in the several Counties, (viz.) to the Earl of Clanrickard, to the
Lord of Mayo, Lord of Costilo, and others, and Commissions of Martial Law to
other Natives of best choice, of purpose to prevent disturbance as much as
might be, and to stay the people: But so little prevailed all the Lord
Presidents lenity, and swasory courses, and the care of the Lords Justices and
Council, to avoid any offense, or rigid usage toward them; as within the
Month of December, most of the prime men of the Province declared themselves
Rebels and of the Conspiracy; They blocked him up in the Castle of Athlone by
the help of the Conspirators of Westmeath, They burnt his Town of Roscomon,
and the Bishops Town of Elphin, and many other English men's habitations, They
surprised several Castles of the Earl of Clonrickards, in the County of
Galway; notwithstanding that on their surmise that they doubted they should not
have the benefit of the graces, his Lordship wrote to your Majesty, and
received assurance in their behalfes of the same, which he published, together
with several other Declarations of your Majesty's. And so the Lord President
continued in Athlone till your Majesty's Lieutenant General of your Army,
carried down 2000. foot, and some Troops of horse: by all which appears,
that neither the Lords Justices, and Council, nor the Lord President, nor any
other in that Province did any thing to provoke them, much less to put them to
defense, till they had murdered, robbed and spoiled all the British and
Protestants, and committed all other Rebellious and hostile Acts that lay
within their lust or power.

To the eleventh Article.
IT is confessed that Parliaments have been held in Ireland very many years,
often for the benefit of the King, Art. 11.
and the good people of the Kingdom. But how long Parliaments have been held
there, or whether with equal liberties, powers, and immunities with the
Parliament of England, and how far laws made in England, may bind in
Ireland, will best appear in the Records, Rowles, and Authentic Presidents of
both Kingdoms, and will be fittest for the dispute and judgment of such
learned in the Law, and other Antiquities, as your Majesty in your high
wisdom shall appoint thereunto. Neither is it true that untrue suggestions
and informations out of Ireland moved the Parliament of England to make such
Laws, as in this Article are mentioned, neither can it be conceived the words
or intent of those Acts (if they have force in Ireland) do aim at or can
reach unto any the lands or possessions of any your Majesty's good Subjects in
that Kingdom, but only to the lands and rights of those that have most
disloyally lifted up themselves against their most gracious Sovereign Lord
their lawful and natural King, and committed the most detestable treasons
against your person, Crown, and Dignity, and the most sanguinolent, outrageous,
and abominable Acts, upon the persons and estates of your Majesty's obedient,
peaceable and innocent Subjects, so far as possibly they could, that ever
were read, or heard of, without provocation or the least motive; neither can
those Acts in any respects be the occasion or grounds of those hideous
perpetrations; Those Acts (in their first conception) being derived only from
fearful rebellion raised by the Confederates and (long after the horrible
Acts of that rebellion) by your Majesty and your Parliament advised of, and
considered in England, as the most speedy and effectual way to raise means
for the relief of the remnant of your Majesty's miserable despoyled Subjects,
ready every day to be swallowed up by the deluge of that universal rebellion,
and to maintain some being in your Majesty's just Soveraingty, rights and
interest in that Kingdom, wholly despised and trodden under foot, by the
Confederates, as before appears: Neither can it be believed that your Majesty
was enforced thereunto, it being your own cause, and the cause of your beloved
and ever loving people; And if any loss should thereon happen to your Majesty
(which is not believed) yet would your Majesty be largely recompensed, in
settling those lands (except where your Majesty shall find cause to show mercy)
in the hands of a peaceable and faithful people, who will not repine, or be
slow to strain themselves every way to your Majesty's profit and honor, who
will be willingly taught, that rebellion is Treason, and so hate and abhor
it, and who will for ever free your Majesty and your posterity from those
dangers, travels, and expenses, which have in many ages lien heavy upon the
Kings and Kingdom of England, by means of the undutifull behavior and
strange seducements of many of the Inhabitants of that Kingdom of Ireland, and
for which your Majesty's gracious and pious provision for your Majesty's good
people, both your Kingdoms will now, and in all succeeding ages bless and
pray for your sacred Majesty, and your Royal posterity, and for ever
acknowledge your Majesty's rare piety and Princely goodness; Neither is there
any truth in that malicious traducement that your Majesty's forces in Ireland
disavowed any authority from your Majesty, all their authority and command
being entirely derived from your Majesty and your immediate Ministers, and
they wholly disclaiming any other service, the contrary whereof could never be
heard out of the mouths of any of them.

To the twelfth Article.
IT is true that the Lords Justices and Council in just and lawful grounds,
Artic. 12.
and for great and weighty reasons of State for common safety, published
several Proclamations, as shall here appear; but not with wicked intent or
evil event, as in this Article is with malice insinuated. On the 23 of October
1641. when the hour approached, which was designed for surprising your
Majesty's Castle of Dublin, great numbers of strangers were observed to come to
town in great parties several ways, who not finding admittance at the gates,
stayed in the Suburbs and fields, and there grew numerous, to the terror of
the Inhabitants; Insomuch as the Magistrates of the City came to the Council
board, with much fear and astonishment, declaring that those mighty numbers in
the fields and Suburbs, still increasing, did threaten high and present danger,
in respect whereof, and considering the great numbers of desperate and loose
persons, who were the night before, and that morning, stolen into the City and
Suburbs, from several parts of the Kingdom, who were secretly harbored
amongst the Papist Inhabitants; the Lords Justices, and Council first caused
as many of them so harbored in town as could be readily found to be
apprehended; and secondly, sought for the rest, considering also that in so
sudden and great a distemper and confusion, something of extraordinary, was of
necessity to be done for terror to disperse those multitudes, so to rid the
Town of them, and to resettle in some degree the minds of the terrifyed and
distracted inhabitants; which the Lords Justices, and Council, did choose
rather to do the same by some sharp Proclamation, then by falling upon them by
violence, which must needs have increased the tumult, and therefore the Lords
Justices, and Council, did then instantly publish a Proclamation in your
Majesty's Name, Commanding all persons not dwellers in the City or Suburbs, to
depart within one hour after publishing by Proclamation, and that upon pain
of death; This Proclamation did not so much as intend or aim at any known
Inhabitants of the Pale, or Countries adjacent, or any of known credit or good
subsistence, neither did any such qualified persons then take the least ill
apprehension thereat, but such of them as applied themselves to the Lords
Justices, were friendly entertained; on the 28 of the same October, it being
complained to the Lords Justices and Council, by the Magistrates of the City,
that many like formerly qualifyed persons, as formerly assembled to the terror
of the City, did still resort to the City and Suburbs, and others
(notwithstanding the former Proclamation) did still lurk there, whose company
they much feared, as threatening some sudden violence.

The Lords Justices and Council therefore on the same grounds as formerly, did
the second time by Proclamation command all such to depart forthwith on pain of
death, and the like pain to such as wilfully harbored them; And that the
Inhabitants should forthwith bring in the names of all such strangers, and the
Officers to apprehend such Inhabitants as should further harbor them: which no
way was intended toward men of quality, or known credit as aforesaid, neither
did any of them stir, or take any misapprehension at it: afterward on the 11
of November following, the Lords Justices and Council having intelligence from
several parts, of the insolent proceeding of the Rebels, against the British
and Protestants, in the borders of the Pale, (The Lords Justices and Council
then not fearing disloyalty in the prime Inhabitants thereof) as in some other
Counties adjacent, and finding that diverse men of quality and countenance in
the Country, and very many others, were then come into the City, whereby the
Country was deprived of defense, and left open to the rapine of the Rebels
then in Arms; And considering that in the beginning of so great distractions,
as then began to show themselves in many parts, the inferiors might be
terrified, or disturbed in the absence of the prime men, the Lords Justices and
Council therefore then, unanimously thought it necessary, and so did (for
those reasons only, and in duty to their then present charge under your
Majesty) on the said eleventh day of November, Proclaim, and Command, on
pains in the said Proclamation mentioned, That all persons not having
necessary cause of residing in the said City, and the Suburbs thereof, or in
places within two miles about the same (their said cause of residing to be
approved of by the Earl of Ormond, and Ossory, then your Majesty's Lieutenant
general of the Army and the Council of war, there for the time being, or
such other persons as should be by them appointed, for examination thereof)
should within four and twenty hours after publication of that Proclamation,
repair to their several dwellings, in which Proclamation there are other
Cautions, Prescripts, and reservations, which show that no unfitting rigor was
offered, or so much as intended. This Act of the Lords Justices, and Council,
did soon after appear to agree with your Majesty's Royal sense of that
necessary retyring of such kind of men, in that time of danger and trouble in
the Country, expressed in your gracious Letters, written to the Lords Justices
in December after, concerning the proroguing of the Parliament; notwithstanding
this Proclamation, such of the Parliament as were come to the Town, and their
retinues, and great numbers of others did continue in Town many days after,
and those of them that were Members of Parliament did sit, and many of the rest
of the Lords and Gentry did remain in Town, as their occasions moved them, and
did come and go at their pleasure, neither was there inforcement, or so much as
menaces used to any man, that did not willingly go, or saw not good reason, on
the said Public warning to depart for the good of the Country and safety of
their families and neighbors.

And it is observeable, that although that Proclamation did expressly provide
for such to stay as having cause, and making the same known, would desire to
stay, yet those of them that had a mind to join with the Rebels and did join
with them, did choose rather to depart, then to make use of the Liberty given
them to stay, and yet now would seem to be constrained to depart, which shows
apparently the vanity and untruth of that their subterfuge: and seeing the
unnatural conspiracy stands so discovered, as now it does; it may not be
forgotten that within the space of five weeks after several Gentlemen of the
Pale, who had sojourned in Town, and intended so to do that Winter, and some
of them who had been dwelling in the City, (no way concerned by that
Proclamation) and likewise some Citizens of good substance, as is
abovementioned, did freely depart the City with some of their substance of
value, doubting the sudden assault and taking of the City, which seemed to be
upon underhand intelligence, between them and those of the Pase, then
beginning to show their formerly secret Confederacy, till the discovery,
whereof none of them had impediment or interruption by the Lords Justices and
Council, or any command from them, to come and go at their pleasure, neither
was there any pillaging all that while heard of in the City, or of any of these
Gentry in the Country. It is most untrue, that after the said discovery (which
was fully made immediately after the before mentioned rebellious Assembly at
Swords) any of those that formerly departed out of Dublin, or any others of
quality, in the Pale (except a few that continued loyal, who from time to time
resorted to the Lords Justices and Council, and were gladly entertained by
them) did offer to return, until the Northern forces, and the forces of the
Pale were beaten from Drogbeda, and your Majesty's Armies become full Masters
of the field in all the parts of the Pale, and then the Lords Justices and
Council could not with their duty deal otherwise with them, then as is before
mentioned.

Another Proclamation was published on the 28 of December, 1641. requiring all
persons (other then such as had necessary causes to Dublin, such as the Lords
Justices, or the said Lieutenant General of the Army, or the Governors of
your Majesty's forces in the City of Dublin should approve, and other then such
as should bring provision to the City to be sold) should forbear coming to
the City or Suburbs thereof; This was done in time of high necessity. The Lords
Justices, and Council seeing that none offered themselves to them openly, but
hearing that diverse, being now discovered Traitors, presuming on friends within
did secretly come to the City, partly to furnish themselves, partly to eat up
and exhaust our victuals, and partly to gain intelligence, and understand in
what case the City stood, which had been a most unwise and unfaithful thing in
the Lords Justices and Council to permit, yet could it not be totally
prevented, notwithstanding all their care and diligence; so great intelligence
had they amongst the Papist Inhabitants of the City. It is as untrue that any
of those men's goods, who first departed the City, intended in this Article, or
any other man's goods were pillaged, seized or confiscated, by warrant, command,
or direction of the Lords Justices, neither were any man's goods so much as
touched or laid hands upon, till a good time after the Lords, Gentry and
Inhabitants of the Pale, and other Counties were publicly declared Rebels:
Indeed afterward the soldiers which came out of England, in times when they
wanted pay did many unruly acts by pillage and otherwise; But the Lords
Justices, and Council did labor to restrain such acts as much as possibly
they could, which may well appear by their several Warrants and Proclamations
against pillaging, and all other unwarranted violence, wherein they adventured
so far as to trench on the martial part of government, rather then (so much
as might any ways lie in their power to prevent it) to suffer such disordered
acts to be done, and which were declared to them would (and so did indeed)
prove to be prejudicial to themselves to have such lawless consumption made
of of those things, which well ordered and taken from such persons, who had
justly merited it, and orderly Warrants given for it, would long afford them
subsistence, which restraint though it wrought little, yet procured great
dislike in the Army to the Lords Justices, touching the Calumny of pillaging
and burning the houses of persons of rank and quality, employed by the Lords
Justices, who kept their houses and annoyed no body, and of others, having the
protection of the State; It is most false that any such thing was done by the
command or privity of the Lords Justices and Council, neither (without the
Council) did the Lords Justices do any manner of thing concerning the
government; neither can it be conceived reasonable, that the Lords Justices and
Council should be answerable for the irregular acts of so unbridled and
ill-paid an Army, who in those necessitous and extremely disordered times would
not be punished; Though the Confederates have no cause to complain of their
losses, it being but just vengeance on their wilful and unprovoked rebellion:
and for persons of rank or quality employed, no such persons ever offered
themselves, or were employed by the Lords Justices, and Council, except two of
the County of Mead, who after they had joined with the Northern Rebels, wrote
to the Lords Justices, that if they might have Commission to parley with the
Rebels, they hoped to do some good, for the quiet of the Country, which
Commission the Lords Justices and Council gave them; Although it after
appeared, that it was sought by them, only to gain some color of security,
for those persons rebellious complying with the Rebels: However the Lords
Justices, and Council, sent them Commission as is before mentioned, being
desirous to leave no means unassayed, that might give hope of any ceasing of
extremities, being then in very weak case to use that just force that was
requisite to compel obedience, the British and Protestants being generally
robbed and spoiled, as is before mentioned, and the City daily threatened, as
well by those of the Pale, as other Rebels. To this Commission those men soon
after made a very frivolous and scornful return, and indeed dealt most
deceitfully in all things with the Lords Justices and Council, seeming by
letters to give them intelligence, which were no other, then either terror and
threatening of the Rebels, or public Acts which they knew would come to their
knowledge otherwise from the common fame, which will appear in their Letters
yet extant; yet were neither of these men's houses burnt at all, neither were
their goods taken by any direction, or command of the Lords Justices; But being
open Rebels, as the rest of that Country were, when your Majesty's forces were
of some strength, and when it was thought fit by the Lords Justices and
Council, and Commanders of the Army, to burn and spoil that Country, to the
end to disappoint the Rebels, and send them further off; the Army being sent
abroad, spoiled them, as it seems, amongst the rest, and indeed burnt many
other houses where the Rebels were releeved and harbored, and from whence they
had opportunity daily to take Cattle (by sudden Roads) from the lands of
Dublin, having spoiled and robbed all the British and Protestants round about
it: And touching protected men, the Lords Justices and Council gave very few
Protections, finding by ancient and late experience, that course to turn only
to your Majesty's disadvantage: It is true, that while the Natives inhabiting
within few miles of Dublin, were permitted by the Rebels to live on their
holdings, from whom the active Rebels had daily relief,

The Governor of Dublin gave passes to very many of them to bring corn and
other Victuals to Dublin, for relief of the Town, and so did the Captains
and Commanders of other Garrisons of purpose to draw to the Market, what they
could from the Rebels, which all (out of their Garrisons, and their Limits) then
were either in act, or full consent and combination, yet were none of those
people pillaged or spoiled by any direction of the Lords Justices, and
Council, but all such things resisted by them, as far as they could possibly
do against an unpaid Army; neither did the Lords Justices, and Council ever
give direction, or any permission to violate any word or writing of safety,
given by them, or any Commander, or suffer it to be done, wheresoever they
could withstand it. But after long forbearance of those wicked and evil
disposed people, and it being found by daily experience, that under pretext of
relieving the City, they carried Munition and other provisions out to the
Rebels, and much more relieved them then the City; and by that means gave the
Rebels much more ready way to annoy and rob the City: and that some seeming to
labor at the Plow, had their weapons hidden near them, and if any of the
straggling Soldiers, or other British, or Protestants, ventured to pass by
them, single, or in weak parties, they assaulted and murdered them; and that
from those parts, the Lords Justices and Council, or any Commander of the
Army, could not at any time receive any intelligence to discover where the
Rebels haunted, or rested, though they daily lived and passed among them; Then
were the Lords Justices and Council necessitated, to disanull and revoke all
those passes, and pretended protections: and yet that was not done, but upon a
fore-warning and time given, and that by public Proclamation. And afterward
were the Army sent out (though with the great grief of the Lords Justices and
Council) to burn and spoil those parts, which they well foresaw, must
conclude in their own great distress, as after it did, for want of promised
provisions out of this Kingdom; of all which their proceedings they from time
to time advertised your Majesty by their letters to the then Lord Lieutenant,
and your Majesty's Secretary: Neither was any quarter though sometimes
unwarrantably given ever violated by the Lords Justices and Council, or with
their privity; neither was any man killed, or his goods taken by any authority,
because an Irish man, or a Roman Catholic, but because a wilful Rebel: And
indeed those disorderly pillagings lighted sometimes as well on the British and
Protestants, and some Roman Catholic Inhabitants of the City and Suburbs, as
upon the open Rebels: As to the Cities and Towns of Dublin, Drogheda, and the
rest which were kept by your Majesty's Garrisons. It is true, they endured the
trouble of unruly Soldiers, much against the hearts of the Lords Justices and
Council, but all their miseries, and the miseries of all other good men
happened by occasion only of the hateful Conspiracy, and violent Rebellion of
the Confederates, because they were under the English Government: The
Confederates did use them worse, then the Egyptians did the Israelites, for
they took away but the Straw, whereas these Confederates (besides the Innocent
blood they have spilt) did not only actually rob and spoil of their
substance, them as well Papists of the Cities, as Protestants in the Country,
where they were able, but also, which was worse, having gotten into their hands
by way of trust, very great quantities of their substance, partly in
foreknowledge of this Rebellion, and partly to answer their barbarous lavish
expenses, they by their Rebellion deprived them of it all, to the utter ruin
of many of them, they not so much as (since the Cessation) yielding them any
relief, in their similate Counsels, and judicatories, though free Commerce
granted.

And lastly, as to the murders, breaches of public faith and quarter,
destruction and desolation in eighteen months (which by computation must be
after the Conspiracy and actual Rebellion fully discovered, and your Majesty's
Armies sent over) The assertion is most false and scandalous in all the parts
thereof; For whatsoever killing or destruction was then executed on the
Confederates and their Accomplices, having their Swords in their hands, in a most
disloyal and irreligious action, was done in natural defense, and in a course
of just War, as a necessary chastisement, from a Gracious and Religious
Prince, upon the unnaturalness of unfaithful Rebels, After the Siege of
Drogheda, the old English of the Pale being forced into Vlster, they did vaunt
that they had killed more English and Protestants in Fingall, then were killed
in many other Counties.
raging in all extremity against the Lives, Persons, and Estates of your
innocent and obedient Subjects, neither did all that killing and destruction
amount to the tenth part of the murders and destructions, in near four
months before, committed upon your Majesty's Loyal and innocent Subjects, and
that by sudden surprisall in open peace and cold blood, when they were no way
able to make resistance, as is too apparent: But nothing could relish with the
Confederates, as favoring of equity, except the Lords Justices and Council
would, in base fear, have treacherously delivered up to them your Majesty's
Prerogatives, Rights, and Sovereignty, their own lives (for their substance
and estates, they had before violently torn from them) and the lives of all
the remaining wretched British and Protestants; the lives of many thousands of
the same kind of men, and the whole substance of them, and the rest, being not
sufficient to satiate the malice of the Confederates, against their lives,
their thirst after their estates, and their hatred to the Protestant Religion,
British Nation, and English Government. And the indisposition of the Lords
Justices to shed blood appeared in that above sixty persons, who amongst many
hundreds came to surprise Dublin, were on the 23 of October, 1641. apprehended,
none suffered death, fave one of Fermanagh, who as the Lord Magwire confessed
was privy to the Plot; and many like instances there are of their great
tenderness in that point.

In the thirteenth Article,
THese confederates do further show, Art. 13.
that one main foundation of their Rebellion, is their hatred of all Law and
good order; They cannot endure that the Parliament should sit, which is your
Majesty's highest favor to your people, for the common good: Or that the
Courts of Justice should sit, according to the ancient and laudable Laws of the
Kingdom, by the benefit whereof they had for so many years undeniably
prospered, and advanced into that happy estate, which none of their ancestors
ever saw, in that Kingdom, many of them innobled, and all of them enriched, as
does well appear in the Statute 11 Jacobi Cap. 1. But of all things it is and
will be for ever admirable, that they should challenge interest in the
fundamental Laws, which they have labored by all their power and policy to
pluck up by the roots; And with a high hand have executed all manner of
violations of those Laws, both against Prince and people, as does well appear
in the forementioned Collections truly made, and by a public Declaration of
both Houses of Parliament, made the 17 of November 1641. That they should call
themselves natural and genuine members of the Parliament (which is an Assembly
of Peace and Order) they having rent asunder, and cast from them all the bonds
of humane society, peace and order, and that they should complain of want of
safety, to come under that power, which they so wilfully renounced, having
under it had full fruition of the happiest protection, and being that ever they
or any of their Ancestors enjoyed, whereof (under God) nothing could have
deprived them, but their own inordinate rage and appetite: Can they imagine it
reasonable, that because they will be Rebels without cause or provocation,
therefore your Majesty and your good people must neither have Parliament, nor
Courts of Justice to sustain and comfort them? will nothing satisfy them but
an entire concurrence of all your Majesty's people in their confusions? And
whereas they affect to vilify the members of the Parliament, doubtless they
cannot but know that the Peers are the same they were, when they were thought
worthy to sit with them; And for the Commons, they are for the most part the
same that sat with them, while they could be capable of so honorable a
trust, and were as active and able in the Service of your Majesty and
Commonwealth as any of them, much more faithful: And for such of these
confederates as the wholesome Laws of the Land have cast out for their treasons
and breach of Faith, both to God and man, there are by due order and election,
substituted in their places, men of Estate, for the most part, but all honest
and legal men: They speak much in some of their Printes, of the Power and
Privilege of Parliament. Yet now, because their offenses have made them unsit
for such trust, they spurn at that Power, and cannot endure it in those
faithful men, whom the fundamental Laws have appointed unto it; Certainly, it
is wonderful, that those confederates should imagine, that by the highest
treasons, murders, robberies, faith-breakings, betraying their peaceable
Neighbors, and Friends, and utterly spoiling the whole British Nation and
Protestants in that Kingdom, of their whole Estates, they should gain
privilege to speak evil of all manner of Authority, and to be thought the
only good Governors of the Commonwealth, miserably distracted by themselves,
and that not upon particular quarrels, or pretended grievances, which your
Majesty could easily have redressed, whatsoever they could be; but upon
prepensed resolution and design to extirpate all the British and Protestants.

If these be the Liberties that they fight for, doubtless they are not
justifyable by the Laws of God or Man, but utterly inconsistent with the
loyalty of Subjects to a Religious Monarch, now by the mercy of God granted to
that Nation; They complain of persons impeached in Parliament, to be
dismissed by the Parliament now sitting; This we conceive to be a just act,
they having fully answered their charge, and no crime appearing against them:
And it is upon good reason believed, that the same was set on foot against
those impeached Judges, rather out of dis-affection to the Government, and
because they were observed careful Servants to your Majesty, then out of any
crime that could be truly objected and proved against them. It is confessed
that the Parliament, since the beginning of that Rebellion have made diverse
Orders, and Declarations for the advancement of your Majesty's Service and the
Public good, and declaration of the Truth; and if there had been any Acts
ready, which might have been good for the Kingdom, they might have been
passed with as much authority, as at any other time: neither can it appear
that ever the Protestants did, or ever offered to pass any Acts prejudicial
to your Majesty, or harmefull to the Nation, wherein themselves by Gods
Providence were incorporated, both in habitation, alliance, and interest; Nay,
rather their ill requited love to the Nation will appear in that (as is before
herein set down) they freely joined as well in this Parliament, as in the last
Parliament, and in that held in the Reign of the blessed King James, to
repeal all Acts that were offensive, or penal to the Nation. It is confessed
that since the beginning of Hillary Term, 1641. Terms have been kept in
Dublin, as legally and justly they ought to be, and in the Kings Bench many
known Traitors and Rebels have been upon just and full evidence indicted, and
many outlawed by a legal and due course, but no known faithful Subjects were
then indicted, nor ever intended to be, neither were any Sheriffs appointed,
but men of known-credit, and subsistence, competent for such a trust, as now
the State of the Kingdom stands, most of the Sheriffs formerly appointed,
having openly joined in the conspiracy, and action of rebellion against your
Majesty, your Government and Laws. And where these Remonstrants seem offended,
that Soldiers are members of the Parliament, and have been Jurors on those
indictments, and some trials, They should have considered, that their Rebellion
forced many of those men to forsake their Estates, and undergo that honorable
profession, to stand in your Majesty's just quarrel against the Remonstrants,
and to defend the residue of your Majesty's distressed Subjects, and the
Government and Laws of the Kingdom: Those Confederates well knowing, that many
of those men had, and yet have full interests in as good estates as themselves;
and as well in point of Interest, as other abilities of education, are as fit as
any of them were to be partakers of the best trust in the Commonwealth. And
whereas they say that diverse who came in upon protection and public faith,
were so tried for their Lives and Estates; It is a most notorious untruth, and
can only befit the Remonstrants to aver, but can never gain credit with any
that know Ireland, or will duly weigh what is here before truly specified. And
for their Protestation against the Parliament, and the Acts of it, and of other
your Majesty's Ministers, it can be of no better value. And for the
Remonstrants desire, that your Majesty would be graciously pleased to call a
free Parliament in Ireland, in such convenient time, as your Majesty in your
High Wisdom shall think fit, and the urgency of the present affairs of that
Kingdom does require; and that the said Parliament be held in an indifferent
place, summoned by, and continued before some Person or Persons, of Honor and
Fortune, of approved faith to your Majesty, and acceptable to your people
there: By this their desire, your Majesty's Protestant Subjects do evidently
perceive, that the Remonstrants thereby intend the dissolving of that
Parliament which your Majesty has now sitting, and which has on weighty
reasons been continued thus long: and how dangerous this may prove to your
Majesty, and your Majesty's Protestant Subjects, they most humbly beseech your
Majesty in your High Wisdom to judge.

First, they being Parties criminous, will gain the acquitall of their own
ill done actions, and the management of the most weighty affairs of the
Commonwealth, and wholly exclude your Majesty's Protestant Subjects, who with
all real fidelity have served your Majesty this present Parliament: and they
seem not willing to have any of your Majesty's Protestant Subjects amongst
them; assuring themselves that if any thing shall be there propounded to the
dishonor of God, the prejudice of your Majesty, or any of your good Subjects
there, that your Majesty's Protestant Subjects will stand in opposition to
their intentions: The Remonstrants well knowing that by their cruel actions
they have either murdered or banished most of your Majesty's Freeholders, so
as no votes are left either in Counties or Corporations, for the electing of
your Majesty's Protestant Subjects, by which they intend no other then a
Parliament of Roman Catholics, who we doubt not will take care to vindicate
themselves; And as for those of your Majesty's Protestant Subjects, that these
Remonstrants have left undestroyed by the Sword, they now desire to destroy, or
banish them out of that Kingdom by color of Justice; as may appear by this
following Oath, by them generally taken.

The oath of the Confederate Roman Catholics of IRELAND, etc.
I A. B. Do in the presence of Almighty God, and all the Angels and Saints in
Heaven, promise, vow, swear, and protest, to maintain and defend as far as
I may, with my life, power, and Estate, the public and free exercise of the
true, and Catholic Roman Religion, against all persons that shall oppose the
same. I further swear, That I will bear Faith and Allegiance to our
Sovereign Lord King CHARLES, his Heirs and Successors; And that I will defend
him and them, as far as I may with my life, power, and estate, against all
such persons as shall attempt any thing against their Royal Persons, Honors,
and Estates, or Dignities: And against all such as shall directly, or
indirectly endeavor to suppress their Royal Prerogatives, or do any act or
acts contrary to Regal Government, as also the power and privileges of
Parliament, the lawful Rights and Privileges of the Subject. And every person
that makes this Vow, Oath, and Pretestation, in whatsoever he shall do in the
lawful pursuance of the same. And to my Power, as far as I may, I will
oppose, and by all ways and means endeavor to bring to condign punishment,
even to the loss of life, liberty and estate, all such as shall, either by
force, practice, Counsels, Plots, Conspiracies, or otherwise, do, or attempt
any thing to the contrary of any Article, clause, or any thing in this present
vow, Oath, and Protestation contained.

So help me God.
AND as for the place of holding the Parliament, your Majesty's Protestant
Subjects cannot imagine why the Remonstrants should desire any other place then
Dublin, it being the place of the residence of the State, unless those
Remonstrants would draw your Majesty's Governors, and the remainder of your
Majesty's Protestant Subjects into some remote place where they might enforce
them to comply with them in their desires; And your Majesty's Protestant
Subjects do conceive that this present Parliament is continued before a person
of honor and fortune; And by the repealing or suspending of Poyings Law, it
plainly appears that the Remonstrants desire to bereave your Majesty of the
advice of your Privy Councels, both of England and Ireland.

It is not agreeable to reason that your Majesty, who is the head, should not
be acquainted with the making of those Laws which perhaps may bind your
Majesty and Posterity, your Prerogatives and Revenues, yea, perhaps alter the
whole frame of that your Government.

If this Law be suspended, they may repeal the Statute made in the second of
Queen Elizabeth, for restitution of Jurisdictions of the Crown, in causes
Ecclesiastical, and the abolishing the Popes usurped Jurisdictions out of that
Kingdom, and all Laws which do concern the worship of God, or the
jurisdiction Ecclesiastical, whereby your Majesty will lose above the one
moyty of your Regal Authority, and God be bereaved of his honor, and all good
people be enforced to forsake that Kingdom.

It being most unreasonable at this time, for that would make themselves their
own Judges, and they being the parties criminous, should not only have the
power of their own acquitall in their own hands, but also of the condemnation
of your Majesty's British and Protestant Subjects, who persecuted them for
their disloyalty against your Majesty.

It is also dangerous for that the Remonstrants have erected that Idol of
popular Government; We mean their Councels called the supreme Councels,
Provincial Councels, and County Councels, and all other their usurped
judicatures, both by Sea and Land, which if they should settle by Parliament,
they would thereby give countenance to their past actions, and for ever exclude
the honorable and just Laws of England, which for these 400. years have
governed that people.

Also your Majesty is already entitled to a great part of that Kingdom by
Attainder of many of the Remonstrants in this Rebellion, which by this means
they will be sure to deprive your Majesty of; And so to disable your Majesty
to raise any yearly Revenue out of their lands, or to make your Majesty's
Protestant Subjects any satisfaction for their losses thereout.

This Statute was held so sacred and inviolable, that notwithstanding that the
Committee from the Parliament made suite to your Majesty that an Act might
pass for the further explanation of the same Statute, which your Majesty upon
mature deliberation did not think fit to give way unto; And for the suspension
made in the 11 year of Queen Elizabeth; It was with those cautions and
restrictions, as can neither give expedition to the present affairs, or be
applied to these times or occasions.

And your Majesty's Protestant Subjects do humbly crave leave to inform your
Majesty, that whereas by the late Articles of Cessation of Arms in Ireland, It
was, amongst other things, agreed, That your Majesty's Protestant Subjects, and
their adherents, should enjoy all their several possessions and quarters, as
they stood the 15 of September 1643. at twelve of the clock of the said day,
without interruption of the said Confederate Roman Catholics and their
adherents; And that restitution should be made of any things taken after the
said time, as may appear by the said Articles; yet the said Confederate Roman
Catholics have since the said 15 of the said September, as well by fraud as
by force of Arms, taken from diverse of your Majesty's Protestant Subjects,
several holds and places of strength, and diverse lands and goods, amounting to
a very great value, and refuse to make restitution of the same, and have burnt
and wasted many places, to the ruin of diverse Families, and to the great
terror of your Majesty's said Protestant Subjects.

And whereas also upon the Conclusion of the said Cessation, it was agreed by
the said Lord Viscount Muskery and others, on the behalf of the said
Confederate Roman Catholics, that thirty thousand pounds should be paid by
them at certain days agreed upon, which was intended and declared, should be
employed to the maintenance of your Majesty's Army, then much distressed for
want of means, yet nevertheless, although the times are long since expired,
that the most part of the thirty thousand pounds should have been paid, the far
greatest part thereof is detained, and what was paid was paid so unseasonably,
as that your Majesty's Army that relied thereupon, have been reduced to very
great extremities; and your Majesty's Protestant Subjects forced to pay taxes
and contributions toward their relief, far above their ability: which
failer of payment by the Remonstrants, your Majesty's Revenues being in the
hands of the confederate Roman Catholics, necessitated the soldiers to
pillage and plunder thousands of your Majesty's good Subjects, to their utter
ruin and destruction, in manifest breach of their undertakings, and to the
great disservice of your Majesty.

And by these former and continued evil actions, known untruthes and
scandalous aspersions cast on your Majesty, and your Royal government, and
Protestant Subjects of that Kingdom, in their said Remonstrance, all men may
judge that they intend nothing but the absolute extirpation of your Majesty's
English government and Protestant Subjects there. All which your Majesty's
Protestant Subjects do most humbly desire, may be redrest by your Sacred
Majesty, for the continuation of your Majesty's English Governors and
government in that Kingdom, and for the encouragement of your Majesty's loyal
and obedient Protestant Subjects.

A TRVE NARRATION OF ALL The Passages concerning the Petition of the
Protestants of Ireland, presented to his Majesty at Oxford, the eighteenth day
of April, 1644. Together with The Reasons inducing the said Protestants to
Petition, the proceedings, and successes thereof, in Ireland, and afterward in
England, from the beginning, until the Protestant Agents were dismissed by His
Majesty from Oxford, the thirtieth day of May, 1644. Collected in obedience to
the Order and Command of the Honorable House of Commons of the Parliament of
England, for the manifestation of the Truth, the vindication of the
Protestants, the satisfaction of the Well-affected, and prevention of the
Popish party, whose daily practice it is to represent untruths to the world,
and under specious shows to delude and blind the people.
ABout the sixth of October 1643. diverse of the Protestant Nobility, Gentry,
Officers of the Army, and other Protestant Inhabitants in Ireland, taking into
serious consideration their sad condition, the great necessity they were
reduced unto, and their extreme sufferings by the late Conspiracy, and horrid
Rebellion there, and finding by the Articles of Cessation, and his Majesty's
Proclamation thereupon, that the Rebels of Ireland were allowed to send Agents
to his Majesty, who would doubtless watch all opportunities to prejudice the
Protestants; and to endeavor to clear themselves of their ill-done actions,
the Protestant Petitioners met together at the Earl of Kildares house in
Dublin, where they framed a Petition, to the then Lords Justices and Council,
which they presented at the Couneell board, and received their Lordships answer
the twelfth day of the same Month: which Petition and Answer follow, In haec
verbo.

TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE THE Lords Justices and Council, The humble Petition of
diverse of his Majesty's Protestant Subjects of IRELAND.
Humbly shows,
THat your Petitioners being pressed by extreme necessities, and their great
sufferings in the present Rebellion, for remedy thereof desire to address
themselves to his Sacred Majesty by their Agents: and because they understand
by his Majesty's Proclamation, and the Articles of Cessation, lately published
in Print, that the Romish Catholics are admitted to send Agents to his
Majesty, who will doubtless watch all opportunities to prejudice your
supplicants;

They humbly pray that your Lordships will be pleased to be a means that
they be not admitted to his Majesty until your supplicants Agents may be
present, which shall be with all convenient speed. And to that end they humbly
desire that your Lordships will be pleased to grant license unto such as your
supplicants shall from time to time appoint to attend his Majesty touching the
premises; And in regard that your supplicants conceive that the dissolving of
this Parliament (which by the alteration of the late Lords Justices will
shortly determine unless by special Commission the same be continued) may
prove of very evil consequence to his Majesty's good Subjects,

They humbly pray that your Lordships will be pleased to recommend the same
effectually to his Majesty's pious consideration, that timely direction may
arrive for continuance thereof.
Octobris 12. 1643.
Upon consideration of this Petition, We think fit to let the Petitioners
know, that his Majesty (out of his gracious care of his affairs, and good
Subjects here) has been pleased, already to signify hither his Royal
intention, to call into England some such able and fitting Ministers or
servants of his Majesty on this side, as are fit to be sent into England, to
assist in the treaty there, when the persons to be employed to his Majesty
from the Irish shall go over, and his Majesty's Royal purpose therein is
already so far advanced, as the names of fit and able persons, of eminent
quality, free from any exception, and well experienced in the affairs of this
Kingdom, are already transmitted to his Majesty, that so he may make choice
of such as he shall think fit, so as all that could be thought of, necessary
for the good of his Majesty's Protestant Subjects, his Majesty has already
provided for, with great piety and wisdom. Yet we (who well know his
Majesty's abundant care and tenderness of his Protestant Subjects here) being
desirous to give the petitioners all needful satisfaction, in their desires,
so far as may confist with the duty we owe to his Majesty, and looking into
former times, do find that when Agents were sent from this Kingdom to attend
his Majesty by the approbation of this board, it was by his Majesty's gracious
License first obtained, wherefore we hold it our duties at this time also to
reserve that part for his Majesty. And therefore we do forbear of our
selves to give any direction therein, but do intend humbly to transmit a Copy
of this their Petition to his Majesty, which also answers the Petitioners
request, concerning the Parliament. And we will labor to obtain a
signification of his good pleasure therein, with all convenient speed, which
we shall readily obey. And if in the mean time there be any matter of
grievance offered by the petitioners to us, which is in our power to redress
here: We do let the petitioners know, we shall be ready to hear it, and to
interpose his Majesty's authority entrusted with us, toward their just relief
therein.

Upon the receipt of the aforesaid Answer, the Protestants met again, at the
Earl of Kildares house; and conceived such persons as the Lords Justices and
Council mentioned in their Answer to be called into England, were to assist
by their counsel in the Treaty, and to advise in what should be proposed, and
(for ought known to the Protestants) not to represent the bleeding and
miserable condition of that Kingdom, or to make proof of the unparalleled
cruelties of the Rebels, (neither did the Petitioners then know who those
persons should be) And notwithstanding the Lords of the Council pretended
they had no precedent for the giving of approbation to Agents to attend his
Majesty, without his Majesty's special License; yet it was recent in many men's
memories, that there were several precedents for it, and that in very late
times, wherefore the Protestant Petitioners conceived that these delays were
put upon the Protestants by some ill affected, merely to gain the Rebels
advantage of time, to work their ends at Court, and to discourage the poor
Protestants in the prosecution of their intendments: And the Protestant
petitioners being not satisfied with the Lords of the Councels Answer,
proceeded to the choice of Agents, and prepared a petition, which afterward
was presented to his Majesty. And on the foureteenth day of October 1643. the
Protestants presented another petition to the Lords Justices and Council, and
delivered their Lordships a Copy of the Petition that was prepared to be sent
to his Majesty, which was answered by the Lords, the nineteenth of the same
Month: which Petition and Answer follow, In haec verba.

To the Right Honorable the Lords Justices and Council, The humble Petition
of diverse of his Majesty's Protestant Subjects, as well Commanders of his
Majesty's Army, as others.
Humbly shows unto your Lordships,
THat we have received your Lordships Answer in writing to our Petition,
whereby we perceive his Majesty's abundant care and tenderness of us, which
we shall with all humble thankfulness ever acknowledge, together with your
Lordships readiness therein. And whereas we find in your Lordships said
Answer, your willingness for redress of any manner of grievance, which is in
your Lordships power; We do humbly herewith offer unto your Lordships a Copy
of our most humble Petition which we prepared to present to his Sacred
Majesty, wherein we set down part of our grievances.

Humbly desiring your Lordships to take the same into your grave consideration,
and so far to condescend to our just demands in our former Petition, and
humble motions to your Lordships expressed for the License and recommendation of
our Agents and Petition to his sacred Majesty, as that the cause of our
Religion, of our selves and our Posterity, whereof his Majesty is so abundantly
earefull, his Majesty's honor and service so much concerned therein, may not
suffer through delay or want of true and full information, which your
supplicants humbly conceive cannot be without particular persons as Agents
from the several parts of this Kingdom to that end chosen, (by those who have
now suffered) to solicit and wholly attend the same.

And they shall ever pray, etc.
19 Octobris
XIX October 1643.
THe answer which on the twelfth of this month we gave to a former petition,
concerning this matter exhibited at this board, In the name of diverse of His
Majesty's protestant subjects of Ireland, does sully answer the requests of
this your petition; to which we can now add, That such is our care of the
petitioners, as that on the same day we gave them that answer, We signed
letters directed to Mr. Secretary Nicholas, and enclosed therein their petition
to Us, and we have by those letters earnestly entreated Mr. Secretary, that
with all convenient speed, we may understand His Majesty's gracious pleasure
therein, which we shall readily obey, and if the Petitioners shall think fit to
send any to attend His Majesty, as we shall not hinder them, or any other from
making their humble applications to his Majesty in any their occasions, so we
hold it agreeable with our duties to forbear our recommendation, for the
reasons expressed in our said answer of the twelfth of this month, until we
first understand his Majesty's good pleasure therein.

Whereupon, Sir Sichard Bolton Knight, Lord Chauncellor of Ireland, upon the
delivery of the said Copy at the council board, said, that the Copy of the
petition prepared to be sent to his Majesty was not a true copy, because it
wanted the names who had subscribed the original petition, which nicity was
soon taken away by the protestants delivery of a perfect list of the names of
such as had subscribed the petition intended to be presented to His Majesty.

The next day a Protestation was framed against the Protestant Petitioners and
their agents, by some ill affected to so good a work, and countenanced by the
Earl of Roscomon and Sir James Ware, two members of that board (amongst
others) to draw scandal and prejudice on the Protestants, and their petition,
which Protestation follows in haec verba.

The sense of diverse of His Majesty's Protestant subjects, who have signed to
the late Petition directed to His Majesty.

Suffering under the misconstruction of our Petition, we hold it fit to declare
that we exhibited not the same through want of assurance of His Majesty's care
of the Protestant Religion and of his subjects; Nor yet to divert any supplies
that may be drawn from honce against such as in His Kingdom of England have
taken up Arms against him, but merely in right to Gods Cause, and in our
right, humbly to inform His Majesty when the Irish agents repair unto him, if
the said Agents shall endeavor to surprise or prejudice us in either, this is
the Commission We give; and if any person or persons employed by Us shall go
further, or otherwise busy themselves, to the disturbance of His Majesty's
service, against such we do and shall protest, as being in our intentions no
parties thereunto, which as it may serve to vindicate our faith to His most
sacred Majesty, so it may show how causeless the Jealousies are of this
address to Him.

And some ill affected persons were employed unto several of the subscribers
to the Protestant petition, desiring them to subscribe the said Protestation,
which took so little effect, that not one man who had formerly subscribed the
said Petion to his Majesty, would be drawn to sign the said Protestation, one
Officer of the Army excepted, who immediately after came to the Councell-Board
(diverse of the Protestant petitioners being there present) and desired that the
Lords Justices and Council would permit him to withdraw his name from the said
Petition intended to be presented to His Majesty, which he had formerly
subscribed: yet seeing the design of the petition, and other discouragements
given the Petitioners took no other effect, but that the protestant
petitioners constantly presisted in their zeal to their Religion, honor of
his Majesty, the vindication of the innocent blood of their brethren shed by
the barbarous rebels, and the preservation of the remainder of the poor
protestants there, They that favored the said petition desisted from any
further proceedings therein.

About the beginning of January, a letter from His Majesty dated the 6 of
November 1643 arrived at Dublin licensing the protestant Agents to repair to
His Majesty, which follows in haecverba.

CHARLES REX,

RIght trusty and well beloved Counselors, and right trusty and right
welbeloved Cousens, and Counselors we greet you well; We have seen your
letters to secretary Nicholas of the 18 of October 1643. with the copy of a
petition to you presented the sixth day of that month, by our cousens the
Earl of Kildare, and Lord viscount Ardes and diverse others in the names of
more of our protestant subjects in that our Kingdom, and what answer you then
made thereupon, with a reservation till our pleasure should be signified
concerning their requests. We have likewise seen your letter to our said
Secretary of the 28 of the same month, with the copy of a petition to us, and
a list of the subscribers, in the name of diverse our protestant subjects,
as well Commanders as others in that our Kingdom, and a Copy of their petition
to you in pursuance of their former, with your answer thereupon; In all which
we find you have very prudently and carefully done what befits your duties to
Us: The four persons nominated by the petitioners, We are pleased may repair
hither, over and above the persons by us formerly appointed, with fitting
instructions concerning the grievances mentioned in the petition aforesaid, and
that you permit them accordingly to come over, when or before the persons to be
sent from our Roman Catholic subjects of that our Kingdom shall come; And if
hereafter our said Protestant Subjects shall desire to add more to them upon
Declaration of their names, who are desired to be added to you, and your
advertizement thereof to Us, you shall receive further direction, and so we bid
you heartily farewell.

Given at our Court at Oxford the 6 day of November in the Ninteenth year of
our Reign, 1643.
To our right trusty and welbeloved Counselors, Sir John Borlase, and Sir
Henry Titchborne Knights, Lords Justices, and to our right trusty and right
welbeloved Cousens and Counselors and trusty and welbeloved Counselors, the
Lords and others of our Privy Council of Our Kingdom of Ireland.
By His Majesty's Command, Edward Nicholas.


After the receipt of which letter the Protestant Petitions proceeded, and the
26 of January made choice of Sir Charles Coote Knight and Baronet, and Captain
William Parsons to be added over and above the four persons formerly nominated
for agents, and presented their names unto the L. Marquess of Ormond then L.
Lieutenant of Ireland to be transmitted to his Majesty.

Soon after (viz) on the 17 day of Febuary 1643 the said Petition of the
Protestants was read in the Commons house of the Parliament of Ireland yet
continuing, who declared their concurrences therein, and that the same day the
Parliament was prorogued to a further time.

Shortly after the Protestant Petitioners humbly moved the Lord Lieutenant, and
Council for a recommendation to His Majesty, both of the cause and persons of
their Agents; And they were answered by the said Lord Lieutenant and Council,
that by His Majesty's letter of the sixth of November the Agents were to have
fittting Instructions concerning their grievances, and their desires mentioned
in the petition of the Protestants unto His Majesty, and therefore they were
required by the Lords of the Council to show their Instructions, without which
they could not recommend the Agents or their cause.

Thereupon the 4th of March, the Protestant Petitioners tendered a Copy of their
Instructions for their Agents to the L. Lieutenant and Council, which
follows in haec verba.

Instructions for the Agents, who are to attend His most Sacred Majesty, on the
behalf of His Majesty's Protestant Subjects of Ireland.
FIrst. most humbly to represent unto His Sacred Majesty the Remonstrance, or
Petition of his truly obedient and loyal subjects the Protestants of this His
Kingdom of Ireland, entitled: To the Kings most Excellent Majesty, The humble
petition of diverse of Your Majesty's Protestant subjects in Your Kingdom of
Ireland, as well Commanders of Your Majesty's Army here as others, whose names
are subscribed in the behalf of themselves, and others Your protestant
subjects in this Your Kingdom, and to manifest by all good ways and means
the truths thereof in every particular, and to solicit the obteyning the
humble desires therein requested, and to refell and disprove the untruthes of
the scandalous aspersions laid by the confederate Roman Catholics, etc. of
Ireland upon the most gracious Governments of Our most royal late Sovereigns,
Queen Elizabeth, and King James of ever blessed memory, and also of our most
Gracious and dread Sovereign King CHARLES and also the extreme falsehoods by
the said confederate Roman Catholics published and imposed upon His Majesty's
said protestant subjects of this Realm.

2. And also to offer unto His Majesty's royal and most tender confideration
the barbarous usage, inhumanity, cruel tortures, and bloody murders committed
and done upon His Majesty's protestant subjects, in the several parts of the
Kingdom without provocation, and that commonly after quarter given, passes,
promises, and oaths for security or safe convoy, especially in that glorious
plantation of King James of ever blessed memory in the province of Vlster,
which terrible effusion of innocent blood cries to Almighty God, and his
sacred Majesty for Justice.

3. In like manner to present unto his sacred Majesty, the true and entire
faith, and allegiance of his Majesty's protestant subjects of this Kingdom
unto his royal person, Crown and Dignity, their cheerful and constant
acknowledgement of his Supremacy in all causes and over all persons, their
universal obedience to all his Laws and gracious government; and their
continued desires and endeavors, even to the uttermost hazard of their lives
and fortunes, for the preservation of all his rights and just prerogatives; and
to present to his Majesty in what estate and condition the Kingdoms was in at
the time of the breaking out of this horrid Rebellion.

4. And most humbly to desire the preservation, and establishmant of the true
protestant Religion in this Realm, and the suppression of popery, according to
the laws and statutes to that end established.

5. Most humbly to desire His sacred Majesty, that the great losses of his
protestant subjects now utterly ruined by the Rebellion of the said confederate
Roman Catholics, etc. may be repaired in such manner and measure as his
highness in his Princely wisdom shall think fit, whereby his Majesty's said
protestant subjects may be enabled to subsist and re-inhabit in the said
Kingdom.

6. Most humbly to present to his Sacred Majesty all other things that may
conduce to the glory of God, to the advancement of the true Protestant
Religion, according to the Laws, the honor and profit of His Majesty, the
just prerogatives of his Crown, the preservation of the Laws, and just
Liberties of the subject, the securing of this Kingdom to his Majesty and his
royal posterity, and future safety to His Majesty's protestant subjects in
their Religion, Lives, and Fortunes, that they may no longer, nor hereafter be
liable to such and the like evils and destructions on them committed, as they
have now suffered from those who sell upon them, spilt their blood, and
destroyed their estates unprovoked, and even when they lived together in full
peace.

7. And for avoiding mistakes, that you present, or propound nothing to his
Majesty but what shall be first well debated amongst your selves, and maturely
considered of, and agreed upon in writing by the major part of you, and
subscribed with your hands.

8. That from time to time you give an account of your proceedings unto those
who are here appointed to negotiate this affair.

9. Which said Instructions being read, the protestant petitioners were
required to withdraw, who (after debate had on the Instructions at the Council
board) were called in again, and exceptions were taken to the, 1, 2, 3, 4 and,
6. Articles of the instructions, and they were told by the Lords of the
Council, that they could, nor would not recommend them as the Instructions
were now drawn, and while the third Article of the Instructions remained; In
respect that they knew that there were many protestants in the Province of
Vlster in Ireland, that were not obedient to His Majesty's Laws, and the Lord
Chancellor moved that these words in the second Article aforementioned might be
omitted out of the Instructions, viz. commonly committed after quarter given,
passes, promises, and oaths for security of fase convoy, especially in that
glorious plantation of King James of ever blessed memory in the Province of
Vlster; which effusion of innocent blood cries to Almighty God and his sacred
Majesty for justice.) And the Lord Lieutenant and Council further gave the
Protestant petitioners the particulars in writing, which they would have added
and omitted in the said Instructions, otherwise they would not recommend the
protestant Agents nor the Cause to His Majesty. By reason whereof the
Protestant petitioners were necessitated to the alteration of their
Iustructions, as hereafter follows:

In the second Article of the first Instruction (quarter given) is lest out.

In the former part of the third Article these words are left out (viz.) in
like manner to present unto His sacred Majesty the true and entire faith and
allegiance of His Majesty's Protestant subjects of this Kingdom unto His
Royal Person, Crown, and Dignity, their cheerful and constant
acknowledgement of His supremacy in all causes, and over all persons, their
universal obedience to all His Laws, and gracious Government; and their
continued desires and endeavor, even to the uttermost hazard of their lives
and fortunes for the preservation of all His Rights and just Prerogatives.

In the fourth is added (in Doctrine and Discipline.)

In the sixth is added (and Statutes in this Kingdom established, and now of
force.)

And about the same time the Lord Lieutenant sent for the Protestant Agents and
declared unto them, that it would be for their better reception at Court, that
they should prepare their several Companies under their commands to go into
England to serve His Majesty (Sir Charles Cootes excepted) whose command lay in
another Province. And soon after Captain Parsons Troop was casheered because
they refused to go into England. Captain Bridgeway, and Sir Francis Hamiltons
Companies, notwithstanding diverse of them refused to go, and that the
Lord Lieutenant on his first motion promised not to impose that on them, and
that Captain Bridgeway and Sir Francis Hamilton were desirous that their
Companies might remain there, for their suture hopes of settlement there, were
ordered to go with their Lieutenants; which was very prejudicial to the said
Agents and soldiers, most of the Soldiers being Lessees or under Farmers unto
them, and persons who expected satisfacton from the rebels for their losses and
injuries sustained by them; which course was the cause as Major Jones (another
of the said Agents,) declared, that he declined the said employment.

After which Captain Ridgeway and Sir Francis Hamilton were employed to the
Lord Lieutenant, and desired his Lordship that Sir Charles Coote and Captain
Will. Parsons, who were chosen, and added as Agents by the Protestants, might
have liberty to go along with them into England.

They received answer from his Lordship, that he would acquaint the Board
therewith.

The eighteenth of March the Protestant Petitioners petitioned the
Lord Lieutenant and Council for license for Sir Charles Coote, and Capt.
Parsons to repair into England to join with their other Agents, in the
behalf of the Protestants, in regard the petition limited the negotiation
thereof to three or more of them; and that Major Jones had formerly declined
the Agency; and that Mr. Fenton Parsons, then at London, was not acquainted
with the choice of him made, therefore it was doubtful whether he could attend
the same or no. Which request being denied by the Lords did very much
discourage the Protestants, until they were revived by the arrival of His
Majesty's Letter of the 27 of February, 1643. which came to Dublin the 29 of
March, 1644. signifying his Majesty's pleasure in approbation of Sir Charles
Coote, and Captain William Parsons, for their coming into England, which
follows in haec verba.

CHARLES REX,

RIght trusty and right entirely beloved Cousin and Counselor, Right trusty
and right wel-beloved Cousins and Counselors, and trusty and wel-beloved
Counselors, We greet you well; We are very well pleased to observe in your
Letter to Secretary Nicholas of the third of this month, how dutifully the
Earl of Kildare and the rest of our good Protestant subjects in Ireland
acknowledged before you the confidence We gave them of Our Grace and Favor,
which We hope they will give Us cause more particularly to make good to every
of them, as occasion shall be offered. And whereas they have further proposed
the addition of Sir Charles Coote, and Captain William Parsons to those
Gentlemen designed to attend Us, We are well contented to give way to that
addition, and that you license them accordingly, to come over hither to attend
Us with the rest, for which these Our Letters shall be your sufficient Warrant.
Given at our Court at Oxford, the twenty seventh of February, 1643.

To Our right trusty and entirely beloved Cousin and Councellor, James
Marquess of O mond, Our Lieutenant-Generall, and general Governor of Our
Kingdom of Ireland, and to the rest of Our Council there. By His Majesty's
command, EDW. NICHOLAS.


whereupon the said Agents received Letters which were delivered them as
Letters of recommendation from the Lord Lieutenant and Council to Mr.
Secretary Nicholas; but what was the effect of the said Letters, or of former
Letters delivered to those agents formerly appointed, neither the Protestant
petitioners nor their Agents did ever know, being refused to be communicated to
the said Agents, though they earnestly desired the same.

On the second of April 1644. the Protestant Agents took shipping at Dublin,
and on the seventeenth of April came to Oxford, and that day they delivered to
Mr. Secretary Nicholas the said Letters from the Lord Lieutenant and Council,
formerly mentioned, and desired him to let them know what time he thought
fittest for the said Agents to wait upon His Majesty, to present unto Him the
petition from the Protestants of Ireland; who appointed them the next day at
nine of the clock in the Garden at Christ-church in Oxford, and then they were
by him presented to His Majesty; where, after kissing His Majesty's hands, they
presented unto Him the said petition, to which afterward they received an
answer: which petition and answer follow in haec verba.

To the Kings most Excellent Majesty.
The humble Petition of diverse of your Majesty's Protestant Subjects in your
Kingdom of Ireland, as well Commanders of your Majesty's Army here, as others
whose names are subscribed, in the behalf of themselves, and other your
Protestant Subjects in this your Kingdom.
Shows,
THat this your Highness Kingdom (reduced with the vast expense of Treasure,
and much effusion of British blood, to the obedience of the Imperial Crown
of England) has been by the Princely care of your Royal progenitors,
especially of Queen Elizabeth, and of your Royal father of ever blessed
memory, and your sacred Majesty, in many parts happily planted, great sums of
money disbursed in buildings, and improvements, Churches edified, and endowed,
and frequented with multitudes of good Protestants, and your Customs and
Revenues raised to great yearly sums, by the industry of your Protestant
subjects especially; and great sums of money by way of Subsidies and
Contributions cheerfully paid unto your Majesty by your said Subjects. In which
happiness this your Kingdom has flourished in a long continued peace, and
under your Highness most glorious and happy government: until that by the
present general conspiracy and rebellion raised out of detestation of your
blessed government, and for rooting out of the Protestant religion: and so for
the dispossessing of your Majesty of this your said Kingdom, without the least
occasion offered by your Majesty, or your Protestant subjects. And
notwithstanding that your Majesty, immediately before, had enlarged beyond
president your Royal favor, and bounty to them, in granting all that their
and and our joint Agents did desire of your Majesty. And we continuing amongst
them in all love and amity, without distrust, your Petitioners and others who
labored to oppose those damnable designs and practices, have been driven from
their dwellings, estates, and fortunes; their houses and Churches burnt, and
demolished; all monuments of civility utterly defaced, your Majesty's Forts and
places of strength thrown down, and the Common and Statute laws of this your
Kingdom utterly confounded, by taking upon themselves the exercise of all
manner of authorities and jurisdictions, Ecclesiastical and Civil, both by
Land and Sea, proper and peculiar to your sacred Majesty, being your just
Prerogatives, and the Royal flowers of your Imperial Diadem, to the
disherison of your Crown, and your royal Revenues brought to nothing, and the
Protestant Clergy with their revenues and support for the present destroyed;
This your Kingdom in all parts formerly inhabited with British Protestants,
now depopulated of them, and many thousands of your Protestant subjects most
barbarously used, stripped naked, tortured, famished, hanged, buried alive,
drowned, and otherwise by all barbarous cruel sorts of death murdered; such
as yet remain of them are reduced to that extremity, that very few of them
have wherewith all to maintain a being, and all of them so terrifyed and
afflicted with those barbarous and inhumane cruelties (the true report whereof
being now spread abroad into the Christian world) you Suppliants conceive
fears, that your Majesty's British subjects will be discouraged from coming
again to inhabit this Kingdom, and the remnant of the British left here
will be forced to depart: All this being done by the conspiracy of the Papists,
who did publicly declare the utter extirpation of the Protestant Religion,
and all the British professors thereof out of this your Majesty's Kingdom; And
to the end it may the better in some measure appear, your Suppliants have made
choice of Captain Mr. William Ridgeway, Sir Francis Hamilton Knight and
Baronet, Captain Michael Jones, and Mr. Fenton Parsons, whom they have
employed and authorized as their Agents, to manifest the truth thereof in such
particulars as for the present they are furnished withal, referring the more
ample manifestation thereof to the said Captain Mr. William Ridgeway, Sir
Francis Hamilton, Captain Jones, and Fenton Parsons, or any three or more of
them, and such other Agents as shall with all convenient speed be sent, as
occasion shall require, to attend your Majesty, from your Protestant Subjects
of the several Provinces of this your Kingdom.

We therefore, your Majesty's most humble, loyal, and obedient Protestant
subjects, casting down our selves at your Royal feet, and flying to you for
succor and redress in these our great calamities, as our most gracious
Sovereign Lord and King, and next and immediately under Almighty God our
protector and defense: most humbly beseeching your sacred Majesty to admit into
your Royal presence, from time to time our said Agents, and in your great
wisdom to take into your Princely care and consideration the distressed
estate, and humble desires of your said Subjects, so that to the glory of God,
your Majesty's honor, and the happiness of your good Subjects, the Protestant
Religion may be restored throughout the whole Kingdom to its luster: That the
losses of your Protestant subjects may be repaired, in such manner and measure
as your Majesty in your Princely wisdom shall think fit; and that this your
Kingdom may be so settled, as that your said Protestant Subjects may heareafter
live therein under the happy government of your Majesty, and your Royal
posterity, with comfort and security: Whereby your Majesty will render your
self throughout the whole world a most just and glorious Defender of the
Protestant Religion, and draw down a blessing on all other your Royal
undertakings. For which your Petitioners will ever pray, etc.

Subscribed by the Earl of Kildare, the Lord Viscount Montgomery, the Lord
Blany, and many others.

At the Court at Oxford, the 25 of April. 1644.
HIs Majesty being very sensible of the Petitioners losses, and sufferings, is
ready to hear and relieve them, as the exigencie of His affairs will permit;
and wishes the Petitioners to propose what they think fit in particular for
His Majesty's information, and the Petitioners remedy, and future security.

Edw. Nicholas.


And His Majesty looking upon the petition and the names of the subscribers
commanded the same to be read, and after the reading thereof His Majesty was
pleased to express himself, that he knew the contents of the Petition to be
truth, and that the same could not be denied; and required the Protestant
agents to reduce the generals of the Petition into particulars. And His Majesty
then further said to the said Agents, That the Agents for the Irish took it
upon their salvation unto him, that the Conspiracy in Ireland at first was not
general, and that the English pale of Ireland were forced into Rebellion by
His Governors of Ireland, and that if his Parliament of England had permitted
Him to have gone into Ireland, when He desired, He doubted not but He should
soon have suppressed that Rebellion.

His Majesty having directed the Protestant Agents by His answer on the said
petition, to represent what they should think fit in particular for His
Majesty's information, and the petitioners remedy, and future security; the
said Agents likewise taking into consideration a scandalous and most false
Remonstrance of the Irish rebels, presented to His Majesty's Commissioners at
Trymme in Ireland the 27 of March, 1642. which afterward was printed at
Waterford by Thomas Bourke, printer to the Confederate Roman Catholics of
Ireland, whereunto he affixed His Majesty's Arms; many of which books were
published and dispersed by the rebels, not only in Ireland, but at Oxford, and
other parts of this Kingdom, and in foreign parts, of purpose to asperse the
late government there, and His Majesty's good and faithful Protestant
subjects, and to put a show of reason upon the barbarous and inhumane cruelties
which the said Rebels had acted on the Protestants of Ireland unprovoked, in
time of full peace.

The Protestant Agents for vindication of the late government, and of the
Protestants of Ireland, and for the satisfaction of all good people, conceived
themselves bound in duty to God and His Majesty, to present to His Majesty some
collections of known truths, in answer to the said Remonstrance of the Rebels
of Ireland. Which Remonstrance, and the copy of the said Collections in answer
thereunto, were presented to His Majesty, together with their first
propositions in the behalf of the Protestants of Ireland, which first
propositions follow in haec verba.

The humble Propositions of your Majesty's Protestant Agents of Ireland, in
pursuance of the humble Petition of your Majesty's Protestant Subjects, as well
Commanders of your Majesty's Army there, as others, presented to your Majesty
the 18 day of April, 1644. and answered by your Majesty the 25 of the same.
1. WE most humbly desire the establishment of the true Protestant Religion in
Ireland, according to the Laws and Statutes in the said Kingdom now in force.

2. That the Popish titular Archbishops, Bishops, Jesuits, Friars and Priests,
and all others of the Roman Clergy be banished out of Ireland, because they
have been the stirrers up of all rebellions, and while they continue there,
there can be no hope of safety for your Majesty's Protestant Subjects. And that
all the Laws and Statutes established in that Kingdom against propery and
popish Recusants may continue of force, and be put in due execution.

3. That restitution may be made of all our Churches, and Church-rights and
revenues, and all our Churches and Chapels re-edified, and put in as good
estate as they were at the breaking out of the rebellion, and as they ought to
be, at the charge of the confederate Roman Catholics (as they call
themselves) who have been the occasion of the destruction of the said Churches,
and possessed themselves of the profits and revenues thereof.

4. That the Parliament now sitting in Ireland may be continued there, for the
better settlement of the Kingdom. And that all persons duly indicted in the
said Kingdom of Treason, Felony, or other heinous crimes may be duly and
legally proceeded against, outlawed, tried, and adjudged according to Law. And
that all persons lawfully convicted and attainted or to be convicted and
attainted for the same may receive due punishment accordingly.

5. That no man may take upon him or execute the Office of a Major or
Magistrate in any Corporation, or the Office of a Sheriff or Justice of peace
in any City or County in the said Kingdom, until he have first taken the Oaths
of Supremacy and Allegiance.

6. That all popish Lawyers who refuse to take the Oaths of Supremacy and
Allegiance may be suppressed and restrained from practice in that Kingdom, the
rather because the Lawyers in England do not here practice until they take
the Oath of Supremacy; and it has been found by woeful experience that the
advice of popish Lawyers to the people of Ireland has been a great cause of
their continued disobedience.

7. That there may be a present absolute suppression and dissolution of all the
assumed arbitrary and tyrannical power, which the said confederates exercise
over your Majesty's subjects, both in causes Ecclesiastical and Temporal.

8. That all the Arms and Ammunition of the said Confederates be speedily
brought in to your Majesty's stores.

9. That your Majesty's protestant Subjects, ruined and destroyed by the said
Confederates may be repaired for their great losses, out of the estates of the
said Confederates, not formerly by any Acts of this present Parliament in
England otherwise disposed of, whereby they may the better be enabled to
reinhabit, and defend the said Kingdom of Ireland.

10. That the said Confederates may rebuild the several plantation houses and
castles destroyed by them in Ireland, in at good state as they we eat the
breaking out of the rebellion, which your Majesty's protestant subjects slave
been bound by their several Patents to build and maintain for your Majesty's
service.

11. That the great arreares of rent due to your Majesty out of the estates of
your Majesty's protestant subjects, at, and since Michaealmas 1641, may be paid
unto your Majesty by such of the said Confederates who have (...) the said
rents to the uses of the said Confederates, or dessroyed the same by disabling
your Majesty's protestant subjects to pay the same; and have also destroyed all
or the most part of all other rents or means of support belonging to your said
protestant subjects. And that your said protestant Subjects may be discharged
of all such arreares of rents to your Majesty.

12. That the said Confederates may give satisfaction to the Army for the great
arreares due unto them since the rebellion, and that (...) Communcers as have
raised forces at their own charges, and laid forth great famines of money out
of their own purses, and engaged themselves for money and provisions to keep
themselves, their holds, and soldiers under their commands, in the due and
necessary defense of your Majesty's right and Laws, may be in due sort
satisfied, to the encouragement of others in like times and cases which may
happen.

13. That touching such parts of the said Confederates estates, as being
forfeited for their Treasons, are come or shall duly come into your Majesty's
hands and possession by that Title, your Majesty after due satisfaction first
made to such as claim by former acts of Parliament would be pleased to take
the same into your own hands and possession, and for the necessary increase of
your Majesty's revenue, and better security of your said Kingdom of: Ireland,
and protestant Subjects living under your gracious government thereto plant the
same with British and Protestants upon reasonable and honorable terms.

14. That one good walled Town may be built and kept repaired in every County
of the said Kingdom of Ireland, and endowed and furnished with necessary and
sufficient means of legal and just government, and defense, for the better
security of your Majesty's Laws and rights, more especially the true
Protestant Religion in times of danger. In any of which Towns no papist may be
permitted to dwell or inhabit.

15. That for the better satisfaction of justice, and your Majesty's honor,
and for the future security of the said Kingdom, and your Majesty's Protestant
subjects there, exemplary punishment according to Law may be inflicted upon
such as have there traitorously leavyed war, and taken up Arms against your
Majestles protestant Subjects and Laws, and therein against your Majesty;
especially upon such as have had their hands in the shedding of innocent blood,
or had to do with the first plot or conspiracy, or since that time have done
any notorious murder, or overt act of Treason.

16. That all your Majesty's Towns, Forts, and places of strength destroyed by
the said Confederates since the said rebellion, may be by them, and at their
charges re-edified, and delivered up into your Majesty's hands, to be duly put
into the government under your Majesty, and your Laws, of good Protestants; and
that all strengths and fortifications made and set up by the said Confederate
since the said rebellion may be slighted and thrown down, or else delivered up
and disposed of for Protestant government and security, as aforesaid.

17. That according to the presidents of former times in cases of general
rebellions in Ireland, the attainders which have been duly had by Outlary for
Treason done in this rebellion may be established and confirmed by act of
Parliament, to be in due form of Law transmitted and passed in Ireland, and
that such Traitors as for want of Protestant and indifferent Jurors to indict
them in the proper County, are not yet indicted, nor convicted, or attainted by
Outlary or otherwise, may upon due proof of their offenses be by like act of
Parliament convicted and attainted, and all such offenders forfeit their
estates, as to Law appertains, and your Majesty to be adjudged and put in
possession without any Office or Inquisition to be had.

18. That your Majesty's protestant Subjects may be restbred to the quiet
possession of all their Castles, Houses, Manors, Lands, Tenements and
Hereditaments and Leases, and to the quiet possession of the rents thereof, as
they had the same before, and at the time of the breaking forth of this
rebellion, and from whence without due process and judgment of Law they have
since then been put or kept cut, and may be answered of and for all the mean
profits of the same, in the interim, and for all the time until they shall be
so restored.

19. That your Majesty's said protestant subjects may also be restored to all
their Moneys, Plate, Jewels, Houshouldstuffe, Goods and Chattels whatsoever,
which without due process or judgment in Law have by the said Confederates
been taken or detained from them since the contriving of the said rebellion,
which may be gained in kind, or the full value thereof, if the same may not be
had in kind; and the like restitution to be made for all such things, which,
during the said time have been delivered any person or persons of the said
Confederates in trust to be kept or preserved, but are by color thereof still
withholden.

20. That the establishment and maintenance of a competent Protestant Army, and
sufficient Protestant soldiers and forces for the time to come be speedily
taken into your Majesty's prudent, just, and gracious consideration, and such a
course laid down, and continued according to the tules of good government, that
your Majesty's rights and Laws, the Protestant religion, and peace of that
Kingdom be no more endangered by the like rebellions in time to come.

21. That whereas it appears in print that the said Confederates, amongst
other things, aim at the repeal of Poynings Law, thereby to open an easy and
ready way for the passing of acts of Parliament in Ireland without having them
first well confidered of in England, which may produce many dangerous
consequences both to that Kingdom, and to your Majesty's other Dominions; your
Majesty would be pleased to recent, and reject all propositions tending to
introduce so great a diminution of your Royal and necessary power, for the
confirmation of your Royal estate, and protection of your good protestant
Subjects both there and elsewhere.

22. That your Majesty out of your grace and favor to your Protestant subjects
of Ireland, would be pleased to consider effectually of assuring them that you
will not give order for, or allow of the transmitting into Ireland any act of
general Oblivion, release, or discharge of Actions, or Suits, whereby your
Majesty's said Protestant Subjects there may be barred or deprived of their
legal remedies, which by your Majesty's Laws and Statutes of that Kingdom
they may have against the said Confederates or any of them, or any of their
party, for, or in respect of any wrongs done unto them, or any of their
ancestors or predecessors, in or concerning their lives, liberties, persons,
lands, goods, or estates, since the contriving or breaking forth of the said
rebellion.

23. That some fit course may be considered of to prevent the filling, or
overlaying of the Commons house of Parliament in Ireland with popish Recusants,
being ill affected members; and that provision be duly made that none shall
vote or sit therein but such as shall first take the Oaths of Supremacy and
Allegiance.

24. That the proofs and manifestations of the truth of the several matters
contained in the Petition of your Majesty's Protestant subjects of Ireland,
lately presented to your Majesty, may be duly examined, discussed, and in that
respect the final conclusion of things respited for a convenient time, their
Agents being ready to attend with their proofs in that behalf, as your
Majesty shall appoint.

Which Remonstrance, Answer, and Propositions, His Majesty received from the
said Agents the 27 of April 1644. and the same delivered to Master Secretary
Nicholas, and then the said Agents desired him to move his Majesty, that
nothing might be concluded with the Irish Agents, until the said protestant
Agents were fully heard, and that they might have a Copy of the Propositions of
the Irish.

The next day after Master Secretary Nicholas told them, that his Majesty had
referred the protestants petition, their answer to the rebels Remonstrance,
and their propositions to the Committee for Irish affairs.

The 29th of April the protestant Agents were told by one of the Committee for
the Irish affairs at Oxford, that such of the Committee who were at the
reading of the Answer to the Rebels Remonstrance, and the Propositions of the
protestant Agent, said, That those Propositions were drawn by the close
Committee of London, and that they wondered that His Majesty would receive so
mutinous a Petition.

The same day the Protestant Agents being informed by diverse persons of
quality, that the rebels Agents were upon dispatch, they waited on the Lord
Cottington chief of the Committee, and desired his Lordship to be a means
that they might have a Copy of the Rebels Propositions to His Majesty, his
Lordship seemed a stranger to the business, and said, he knew not any
Propositions the Rebels had made, and said further that he conceived they
meant the Irish Remonstance; whereunto they answered that the same was long
since printed, and that they were not strangers thereunto; To which his
Lordship replied, that if any such Propositions were made, it were fit the same
should be made known unto them, but that he knew of none such. Notwithstanding
the said Lord Cottington was present at the Committee appointed by His Majesty
for Irish affairs the 19 of April, when the said Propositions from the Rebels
of Ireland were read, and by his Lordship and the rest on inviolable secrecy
delivered unto Sir William Stewart, and Sir Gerard Lowther, Sir Philip
Percivall and Mr. Justice Donuelland, who were sent for out of Ireland, and
appointed by His Majesty to advise with him upon the Treaty, and who received
command from their Lordships not to communicate the said Propositions to any
body; which Injunction of secrecy was a great prejudice to the Protestant
cause, that those persons being persons of ability, and integrity should be
restrained from a free communication of all occurrences concerning that affair
with the said Protestant Agents, and both they and the Agents were thereby
prevented of satisfying several persons that on false grounds and
misinformation of the Rebels and their party (who took liberty to discourse
of the reasonableness of the Rebels desires, and of the motives inducing the
same) were deluded with an opinion of the moderatnesse of the Rebels
propositions, and other their proceedings.

The same day the Protestant Agents being much troubled with the said Lord
Cottingtons answer, repaired unto Sir William Stewart, Sir Gerard Lowther, Sir
Philip Percivall, and Justice Donuellan, and unto Sir George Radcliffe, and Sir
William Sambach, who were added to them for that affair, and acquainted them
that they were attending with instructions from His Majesty's protestant
subjects of Ireland, and had exhibited a petition and propositions to his
Majesty, who had promised them a gracious hearing, and that they heard that the
Rebels Agents were somewhat near a dispatch, and therefore entreated them
(who, as they understood, were to be admitted to attend the Lords of the
Committee for Irish affairs that afternoon) that they would move their
Lordship, that the protestant Agents, who had diver a things of great
consequence to offer to their Lordships, might be admitted to a full hearing
before matters proceeded too farce, His Majesty having promised them a gracious
hearing, and they having attempted many other means to obtain the same and
that their Lordships would admit the said protestants Agents to see a copy of
what was moved by the rebels; being also ready to deliver a Copy of the
Protestants Agents propositions.

The next day Sir George Radcliff sent for the Protestant Agents, and in the
presence of Sir William Stewart and the rest of the Gentlemen aforenamed, he
told them that they had acquainted the Lords of the Committee with their
desires, and that their Lordships commanded them to return this answer, that
their Lordships took it ill that the said Agents were so forward in
prejudicating the Kings Justice, and their Lordships, and that they should be
heard at large before any conclusion were, and said further that themselves
were thought too forward to present such a request; but as to the Protestants
Agents desire of having a copy of the rebels propositions, they received no
answer.

The first of May, the Protestant Agents were commanded to attend the said
Committee for Irish affairs at the audit Chamber in Oxford which accordingly
they did; The Lords of the Committee then present, being the Lord Cottington,
the Earl of Bristol, the Earl of Portland, the Lord George Dagby, Sir Edward
Nicholas, Sir John Culpepper, and Sir Edward Hade; At which time their
Lordships caused to be read the Protestants Petition, and their propositions
presented to His Majesty, and the Instructions from the Protestants of Ireland,
and the order of the Commons house of the Parliament of Ireland of the 17 of
February 1643. Declaring the concurrence of that house to the said petition,
but the Collections made in answer of the Remonstrance of the Irish which would
have disproved their untrue pretenses was not read. Then the E. of Bristol told
the said Agents that both the King and themselves were sensible of the
prejudicate opinion, which the said Agents had of their Justice, by their
pressures to be heard, and by their belief of vulgar reports, That the said
Agents could not be more careful of the Protestants and Protestant Religion
then their Lordships were; To which the said Agents answered, that if they had
erred in pressing to be heard, it was but out of their zeal to the service,
and for the preservation of the remnant of the poor Protestants of Ireland,
who entrusted them, and out of a desire that His Majesty, and their Lordships
might be rightly informed of the past sufferings, and present deplorable
condition of the Protestants there, which the said Agents humbly desired might
be no otherwise represented to his Majesty, and that they might be admitted to
the proof of the particulars contained in the said Protestant Petition, which
they humbly conceived to be of greatest concernment to them in discharge of
their trust: whereupon the said Agents were bidden to withdraw, and soon after
were called in again, and commanded to subscribe the propositions, which they
had formerly presented to His Majesty, and were that day read before their
Lordships, which they did, and the same day they were appointe in the
afternoon to attend the Lord Priimate, the Lord Bishop of Down, Sir Geo.
Radcliff and others; and there Sir George Radcliff cold them that they were
commanded by the Committee for Irish affairs to let them know how ill they
took the height, and unreasonablenesse of their said Propositions, and to
deliver them this ensuing message.

First, that their Lordships did not think that the Propositions presented by
the pretestant Agents to His Majesty, and that morning read before their
Lordships were the sense of the Protestants of Ireland.

Secondly, That those Propositions were not agreeable to the Instructions given
the said Agents by the protestants of Ireland.

Thirdly, That as those Propositions were drawn, they would lay a prejudice on
His Majesty, and His Ministers to posterity, these remaining on record, if a
Treaty should go on and a peace follow, which the Kings necessity did enforce:
and that the Lords of the Committee apprehended the said Agents did flatly
oppose a peace with the Irish.

Fourthly, That it would be impossible for the King to grant the Protestant
Agents desires, and grant a Peace to the Irish.

Fifthly, That the Lords of the Committee desired the protestant Agents to
propose a way to effect their desires either by force, or treaty, considering
the condition of His Majesty's affairs in England.

To which Message the Protestant Agents gave Answer, to this effect.

TO the first, that they humbly conceived, that the Propositions which they had
presented to his Majesty were the sense of the Protestants of Ireland.

To the second, that the propositions were agreeable to the Instructions given
to the said Agents by the protestants of Ireland, and conduced to the well
settlement of that Kingdom.

To the third, that they had no thought to draw prejudice on His Majesty, or
their Lordships by putting in those propositions, neither had they so soon put
in propositions, had not his Majesty by his Answer to the Protestant petition
directed the same.

To the fourth, the said Agents humbly conceived that they were employed to
make proof of the effect of the protestants Petition, to manifest the inhumane
Cruelties of the Rebels, and then to offer such things as they thought fit for
the security of the protestants in their Religion, lives, liberties, and
fortunes; That the said Protestants had no disaffection to peace, so as
punishment be inflicted according to law, as in the propositions are expressed;
and that the said pretestants might be repaired for their great losses out of
the estates of the rebels, not formerly by any Acts of this present Parliament
in England otherwise disposed of, which the said Agents desired might be
represented to his Majesty, and the Lords of the Committee accordingly.

To the fifth, that the said protestant Agents were strangers to his Majesty's
affairs in England, and conceived that part more proper for the advice of his
Counsels then the said Agents, and therefore desired to be excused from
meddling in the Treaty further then the manifesting of the truth of the
protestant petition, and proposing in the behalf of the protestants, according
to the Instructions given them, which the said Agents were ready to preforme,
whenever they should be admitted thereunto.

And having read them before their Lordships, etc. Sir George Radcliff told the
said Agents, that while they continued so high and unreasonable in their
propositions they must expect nothing but War; To which the Agents answered,
that they were ill furnished for a War, but had rather undergo the hazard of a
War, then consent to a dishonorable and destructive peace, and they further
answered that they should betray the trust reposed in them by the Protestants
of Ireland, if they did admit of any further alterations of the said
propositions then, as is hereafter mentioned, which the said Agents were
resolved upon no terms to do; Then Sir George Radcliffe said that he was sure
that if the said Agents would fall three parts of four of the said
Propositions, that the fourth part would not be consented unto; And afterward
Sir George Radclieffe (seeing he could no way further prevail with the said
Agents to alter their propositions) told them that they were sent over by the
Protestants of Ireland to preserve them,
and unless the said Agents consented to a peace, His Majesty being in no
condition to send them any relief, the Irish upon their Agents return home
would destroy the remnant of the Protestants of Ireland, and therefore desired
the said Agents to consider of some way to secure them. To which it was
answered by the Protestant Agents that there were five more he yet to come to
the end of the Cessation, within which time means might be found for their
relief, and that it were better that the Protestants should quit Ireland for a
time, then consent to a destructive peace; Then Sir George asked how they could
get the Protestants from thence; To which it was answered by one of them, that
His Majesty might make stay of the Irish Agents in England, until the
protestants were brought out of Ireland; Sir George Radcliff replied that be
had rather advise the King to lose that Kingdom, then that he should violate
his word with the Irish Agents, who were come to Treat with His Majesty and
had his Majesty's promise for their safe return; And the said Sir George said
further,
that if the Irish had not good conditions, it was not likely that they would
forbear Arms until the end of the time limited by the Articles of Cessation;
The next day the Protestant Agents delivered the aforesaid propositions unto
Secretary Nicholas to be presented to his Majesty, or to the Lords of the
Committee, which he thought fittest, which propositions follow, in haec verba.

The humble Propositions of Your Majesty's Protestant Agents of Ireland in
pursuance of the humble Petition of Your Majesty's Protestant subjects, as well
Commanders of Your Majesty's Army there, as others presented to Your Majesty
the 18. day of April 1644. and answered by Your Majesty the 25 of the same.
1. WE most humbly desire the establishment of the true Protestant Religion in
Ireland, according to the Laws and Statutes in the said Kingdom now in force.

2. That popery and popish recusants may be suppressed according to the laws,
and statutes established in Ireland.

3. That the Parliament now sitting in Ireland, may be continued for the better
setlement of that Kingdom, for if that Parliament should be dissolved, there
would be few or no protestant freeholders found in that Kingdom, they being
either killed, or banished by this rebellion, to elect or choose any of Your
Majesty's protestant subjects to sit in Parliament hereafter, which by
consequence may be destructive to Your Majesty's rights and prerogatives, and
protestant subjects in their lives, liberties and fortunes.

4. That all such lawyers, who refuse to take the Oaths of supremacy and
allegiance may be suppressed and restrained from practice in that Kingdom, the
rather because the lawyers in England do not here practice, until they take
the Oath of supremacy; And it has been found by woeful experience that the
advice of the popish lawyers to the people of Ireland has been a great cause
of their continued disobedience.

5. That there may be a present absolute suppression and dissolution of all the
assumed arbitrary and tyrannical power, which the said confederate Roman
Catholics (as they call themselves) exercise over Your Majesty's subjects
both in causes Ecclesiastical and Temporal.

6. That all the Armet and Ammunition of the said confederates may be brought
into Your Majesty's hands, when any conclusion shall be made.

7. That Your Majesty's protestant subjects ruined and destoyed by the said
confederates may be repaired for their great losses out of the estates of the
said confederates, not formerly by any Act of Parliament in England otherwise
disposed of, in such manner and measure as Your Majesty in Your high Wisdom
shall think fit, whereby they may the better be enabled to reinhabit and defend
the said Kingdom of Ireland.

8. That the said confederates may rebuild the several Plantation Houses, and
Castles destroyed by them in Ireland in as good state as they were at the
breaking out of the rebellion, which Your Majesty's protestant subjects have
been bound by their several patents to build and maintain for Your Majesty's
service, or otherwise that Your Majesty will discharge Your said protestant
subjects of that Covenant or condition in their several patents, and that an
Act be passed in this present Parliament to that purpose. And whereas, several
Castles, and Houses, were surrendered upon Quarter, upon Articles under their
hands, with solemn Oaths or otherwise to preserve the said Castles, and
houses from being defaced or demolished; That the said confederates who have so
Articled with any of Your Majesty's protestant subjects may rebuild the said
Castles, or Houses in as good state as they were at the time of surrendering up
of the same upon Articles, as aforesaid, or such a considerable fine may be
levied out of the Estates of the said confederates as may rebuild the said
Houses, as Your Majesty in your high Wisdom shall think fit.

9. That the great arrears of rent due to Your Majesty out of the Estates of
Your Majesty's protestant subjects, at and since Michaelmas 1641. may be paid
unto Your Majesty by the said confederates, who have either received the said
Rents to the uses of he confederates, or destroyed the same by disabling Your
Majesty's protestant subjects to pay the same, and have also destroyed all or
the most part of all other rents or means of support belonging to Your said
protestant subjects, or that Your said protestant subjects may be discharged of
all such arrerages of rents to Your Majesty. And that Your Majesty will be
further graciously pleased to give an abatement of the great yearly rents
payable from Your protestant subjects for some reasonable time as in Your
Majesty's high wisdom shall be thought fit for their encouragement and
enablement to replant that Your Kingdom, in respect the said lands for the
most part depopulated by the said confederates will not be worth Your Majesty's
rents for a long time,

10. That Your Majesty will be graciously pleased to take into Your Majesty's
hands so much of the confederates estates as are necessary to be planted in
that Kingdom for the increase of Your Majesty's revenues, toward the
defraying of Your Majesty's necessary chage of that Kingdom, the satisfying in
some measure the arreares of Your Army in Ireland, especially those who have
laid great sums of money out of their own purses, and deeply engaged
themselves for money and provisions to keep themselves, their holds, and
Soldiers under their commands in the necessary defense of Your Majesty's
rights and laws, and for the encouragement of others in like times and cases
which may happen, who otherwise will be totally ruined by their great
engagements, which we humbly submit to Your Majesty's consideration; And
likewise that Your Majesty will be graciously pleased in the said plantations
to erect and build some walled Towns in the said Kingdom of Ireland, and
endow and furnish them with necessary and sufficient means of legal and just
government, and defense, for the better security of Your Majesty's laws and
rights, more especially the Protestant Religion in time of danger,

11. That for the better satisfaction of Justice and Your Majesty's honor, and
for the future security of the said Kingdom, and Your Majesty's protestant
subjects there, exemplary punishment may be inflicted upon such of the
principal offenders as have had their hands in the shedding of innocent blood,
or had to do with the first plot or conspiracy, or since that time have done
any notorious murders.

12. That Your Majesty's Towns, forts and places of strength destroyed by the
said confederates since the said rebellion, may be by them, and at their charge
reedified, and delivered up into Your Majesty's hands, to be duly put into the
government under Your Majesty and Your laws of good protestants; and that all
strengths, and fortifications made and set up by the said confederates since
the said rebellion, may be slighted and thrown down, or else delivered up, and
disposed of for Protestant government, as aforesaid.

13. That Your Majesty's Protestant subjects may be restored to the quiet and
peaceable possession of all their Castles, Houses, manors, lands, Tenements
hereditaments and leases, as they had the same before, and at the time of the
breaking forth of this rebellion, and from whence, without due process and
Judgment in law, they have since then been put out and kept.

14. That Your Majesty's said Protestant subjects may also be restored to, or
satisfied for all their moneys, plate, Jewels, household Stuff, Goods or
Chattells whatsoever, which during the Rebellion have been delivered to any
person or persons of of the confederates in trust to be kept and preserved,
which are yet detained from them without color of law or Justice.

15. That the establishment and maintenance of a complete protestant Army, and
sufficient protestant Soldiers and forces for the time to come in Ireland, be
speedly taken into Your Majesty's Prudent, Just, and Gracious confideration,
and such a course laid down and continued therein, according to the rules of
good government, that Your Majesty's rights and laws, and the protestant
Religion, and Peace of that Kingdom be no more endangered by the like
Rebellion in time to come.

16. That whereas it appears in print that the said confederates amongst
other things aim at the repeal of Poynings Act, thereby to open an easy and
ready way for the passing of Acts of Parliament in Ireland without having them
first well considered of in England, which may produce many dangerous
consequences, both to that Kingdom, and to Your Majesty's other Dominions;
Your Majesty would be pleased to recent and reject all propositions tending to
introduce so great a Diminution of Your royal and necessary power, for the
conservation of Your royal estate, and protection of Your good protestant
subjects both there, and elsewhere.

17. That Your Majesty, out of Your abundant grace and favor to Your
Protestant subjects of Ireland, will be pleased to consider effectually of
assuring them, that if your Majesty shall think fit for the furtherance of
your service, to grant to the said confederates an Act of oblivion, that your
Majesty will not allow of, discharge, or release any actions, suites, debts, or
interests, whereby your Majesty's protestant subjects of Ireland may be barred
or deprived, or any of their party, in respect of any wrongs done unto them or
any of their ancestors, or predecessors, in and concerning their lands, goods
or estates, since the contriving or breaking forth of the said rebellion.

18. That some fit course may be considered of to prevent the filling or
overlaying the Commons house of Parliament in Ireland with popish recusants,
and unless some course shall by due means be settled, the popish faction may
at some time or other get such an overruling power in that house, as may
endanger both your Majesty's rights and royal prerogatives, and the
Protestants of that Kingdom; And that provision may be made that none shall
Vote, or sit in any Parliament there, but such as shall first take the Oaths of
Supremacy and Allegiance.

19. That the proofs and manifestation of the Truth of the several matters
contained in the Petition of your Majesty's protestant subjects of Ireland, and
the collections made to disprove the scandalous aspersions cast on your
Majesty's gracious government, and on your good and loyal protestant subjects
by the confederates may be duly examined and discussed.

The seventh of May Sir William St Ledger came from His Majesty's Army to
Oxford, and being with the protestant Agents told them, That that party of the
Army that came out of Munster in Ireland were much discontented to hear that
the protestant Agents received no better countenance, and that he had told the
Lord Digby so much, and that the Lord Digby on discourse with the said Sir
William, said, That The greatest favor he could do the Protestants Agents,
was, to call them mad men, that he might not call them roundheads, for that the
said Agents had proposed mad propositions; and wished him to prevail with some
of the Agents to come to him, that he might confer with them, which the said
Agents did not, the L. Digbies expressions then and before so little
encouraging them thereunto.

The same day there was a report in Oxford, grounded upon a letter that came
out of Ireland, signifying that it went for current news in Dublin that the
Irish Agents were dispatched at Court, and that they staid to procure the
protestants pardons; This being told to the L. Digby by the said Sir William St
Ledger, his Lordship answered, That the Protestant Agents had raised that
report, of purpose to cast an aspersion upon the King.

The eighth of May the Protestant Agents waited on Mr. Secretary Nicholas,
desiring to know what resolution was taken upon their second propositions, who
told them; That the Lords sat not that day according to their appointment. And
the said Agents heard by others, that some of the Lords desired to avoid
sitting in counsel when the business of Ireland was debated.

The ninth of May the protestant Agents were commanded to wait at the Council
board, which they did; and His Majesty being present told them, That they were
sent over by his Protestant subjects to move him in their behalf, and desired
to know in what condition the Protestants were to defend themselves in case a
peace should not be concluded which was answered by the Protestant Agents, That
they humbly conceived they were employed first to make proof of the effect of
the protestants petition, and disprove the scandalous aspersions, which the
Rebels had cast on His Majesty's government, and the protestants of Ireland;
The King said, that needed not, for to what purpose is it to prove the Sun
shines this day, when we all see it? The Agents said, they found not His
Majesty satisfied, but that the five several Counties called the English Pale
were forced into Rebellion by his governors; To which His Majesty answered,
That that was but an assertion of the Irish; Then the King again defired to
know in what condition the protestants were in to defend themselves, in case he
should not make a peace with the Irish; The said Agents desired some time to
make an answer to that Question; but His Majesty answered, That he thought they
had come prepared to declare the whole condition of that Kingdom; And further
asked whether they would have Peace or no. To which it was answered by the
Agents, That peace was the thing they had been bred up in, and that they were
not against peace, so it might stand with His Majesty's honor, and safety of
his protestant subjects in their Religion, Lives, Liberties, and Fortunes; Then
the Lord Digby told His Majesty, That they desired Peace; The Duke of Richmond,
and the Earl of Linsie replied, it is true, the Agents have expressed that
they are not against Peace, so that it may be with honor to His Majesty, and
safety to His Majesty's Protestant Subjects of Ireland; Then the King said, he
had rather they should have their Throats cut by War, then that they should
suffer by a Peace of His making, And that he would take a care that the
Protestants of Ireland should be preserved. His Majesty told the said Agents,
that they should have a Copy of the Propositions of the Irish, and wished them
to make an answer to them; And the said Agents being wished to withdraw, and
being sent for in again, His Majesty told them, That for the clearing of the
matter he must tell them two things; the first was, That he could not relieve
his Protestant subjects in Ireland either with Men, Money, Arms, Ammunition,
or Victuals. And secondly, That he could not allow them to join with the new
Scots, or any others that had taken the Covenant with them.

And on the same day about one of the clock the Protestant Agents received a
copy of the Rebels high and destructive propositions from Secretary Nicholas,
who wished them from His Majesty to put in their answers thereunto within two
days. On which the Agents desired two days longer, which was granted.

And on the 13 of May 1644. at the Councell-board, the King, Prince, and Duke
of York, with many of the Lords there sitting, the Protestant Agents presented
unto His Majesty their answers to the Rebels propositions; both which hereafter
follow in haec verba.

The Propositions of the Roman Catholics of Ireland, humbly presented to His
sacred Majesty, in pursuance of their Remonstrance of grievances, and to be
annexed to the said Remonstrance. Together with the humble Answer of the Agents
for the Protestants of Ireland to the said Propositions made in pursuance of
your Majesty's directions of the ninth of May 1644. requiring the same.
1. Proposition. THat all acts made against the Professors of the Roman
Catholic Faith, whereby any restraint, penalty, mulct, or incapacity may be
laid upon any Roman Catholic within the Kingdom of Ireland may be repealed,
and the said Catholics to be allowed the freedom of the Roman Catholiqus
Religion. Answer. To the first, We say that this has been the pretense of
almost all those who have entered into rebellion in the Kingdom of Ireland at
any time since the Reformation of Religion there, which was settled by Acts of
Parliament above 80 years since, and has wrought good effects ever since for
the peace and welfare both of the Church and Kingdom there, and of the Church
and Kingdom of England, and Protestant party throughout all Christendom, and
so has been found wholesome and necessary by long experience. And the repealing
of those Laws will set up Popery again both in jurisdiction, profession, and
practice, as it was before the Reformation, and introduce amongst other
inconveniences the Supremacy of Rome; and take away or much endanger your
Majesty's supreme and just authority in causes Ecclesiastical, a diminution
of honor and power not to be endured; the said Acts extending as well to
seditious sectaries as to popish recusants; so as by the repeal thereof every
man may seem to be left to choose his own Religion in that Kingdom, which
must needs beget great confusion, and the abounding of the Roman Clergy there
has been one of the greatest occasions of this late rebellion. Besides, it is
humbly desired that your Majesty will be pleased to take into your gracious
consideration a clause in the Act of Parliament passed by your Majestis Royal
assent in England, in the seventeenth year of your Reign, touching punishment
to be inflicted upon those that shall introduce the authority of the Sea of
Rome in any case whatsoever.

2. Proposition. That your Majesty will be pleased to call a free Parliament in
the said Kingdom, to be held and continued, as in the Remonstrance is
expressed; And the Statute of the tenth year of King H 7. called Poynings Act,
and all Acts explaining, or enlarging the same, be suspended during that
Parliament, for the speedy settlement of the present affairs, and the repeal
thereof to be there further considered of. Answer. Whereas they desire to have
a free Parliament called, reflecteth by secret and cunning implication upon
your Majesty's present Parliament in Ireland, as if it were not a free
Parliament, we humbly beseech your Majesty to resent how dangerous it is to
make such insinuation, or intimation to your people of that Kingdom touching
that Parliament, wherein several Acts of Parliament have already past; the
validity whereof may be endangered, if the Parliament should not be approved as
a free Parliament; and it is a point of so high nature as we humbly conceive it
not properly to be discussed but in Parliament; and your Majesty's said
Parliament now sitting is a free Parliament in law holden before a person of
honor and fortune in that Kingdom, composed of good, loyal, and well
affected subjects to your Majesty, who doubtless will be ready to comply in
all things that shall appear to be pious and just, for the good of the true
Protestant religion, and for your Majesty's service, and the good of that
Church and State. That if this present Parliament should be dissolved, it would
be a great tenor and discontent to all your Majesty's protestant Subjects of
that Kingdom, and may be also a means to (...) many of your Majesty's
subjects to quit that Kingdom, or peradventure to adhere to some other party
there in opposition to the Roman Irish confederates, rather then be liable to
their power; which effects may prove of most dangerous consequence. And we
humbly offer unto your Majesty's consideration your own gracious expression
mentioned in the grounds and motives inducing your Majesty to agree to a
Cessation of Arms for one whole year, which the Roman Catholics of Ireland
printed at Oxford 19 October. 1643. viz. And let all Our good subjects be
assured, that as we have for these reasons, and with this caution and
deliberation consented to this preparation to peace, and to that purpose do
continue Our Parliament there, so we shall proceed in the accomplishing thereof
with that care and circumspection, that we shall not admit even peace it self,
otherwise then as it may be agreeable to conscience, honor, and justice. We
also humbly desire that such Laws as your Majesty shall think fit to pass
may be transmitted according to Poynings Law, and other Laws of explanation
thereof, or of addition thereunto now in force with great contentment and
security to your Majesty's protestant Subjects: But if the present Parliament
be dissolved, we humbly represent unto your Majesty, that so many of your
ablest and best protestant Subjects have been murdered or banished by this
rebellion, that few or no protestant Freeholders will be found in the
Counties, Citles, and Buroughs to elect and choose Knights, Citizens, and
Burgesses, which will be most dangerous to your Majesty's rights and
prerogatives, and good subjects, and may bege^t great disputes in after-tmes;
For the repealing of Poynings act, notwithstanding their feigned expressions of
their loyalty, yet it plainly appears they do not repose so much trust in
your Majesty's Justice as it becomes loyal Subjects to do (and such they
pretend themselves to be) for that they seek thereby to prevent your Majesty
and your Council of England and Ireland of so full a view and time of mature
consideration to be had of Acts of Parliament of Ireland before they pass, as
in prudence is requisite, and has been found necessary by the experience of
well near 200 years; and if their intentions were so clear as they profess,
we know not why they should avoid the strictest view and try all of your
Majesty and Councels of both Kingdoms, this their desire tending to introduce
a great diminution of your Royal and necessary power for the conservation of
your Regal State, and protection of your good protestant Subjects there and
elsewhere. And what special use they aim at in seeking such repeal, your
protestant Subjects, as they know not the particulars, so can they conjecture
of none, unless the said confederates have some design by way of surprise to
obtrude upon your Majesty in their new desired Parliament some Acts in
justification of their ill done actions, and for condemning such of your
protestant Subjects as have in their several degrees most faithfully served
your Majesty there: which we the rather believe, seelng they have vowed by
their Oath of association, and the Bull lately published in Ireland since the
cessation, the destruction of the Protestants there, when they have their
Swords in their hands to put the same in execution.

3. Proposition. That all Acts and Ordinances made and passed in the now
pretended Parliament in that Kingdom since the seventh day of August 1641. be
clearly annulled and declared void, and taken off the file. Answer. We humbly
desire that they may particularize those Ordinances which may prejudice your
Majesty's service, for we are well assured that the Parliament now sitting in
Ireland, on signification of your Majesty's pleasure therein, will either give
your Majesty full satisfaction, or repeal any unjust Orders or Ordinances
whatsoever, which may be prejudicial to your Majesty. And there may be some
Orders or Ordinances which may concern particular persons in their lives,
liberties, or fortunes, that may suffer unheard by the admitting of so general
a Proposition, which is merely proposed, as we humbly conceive, to put a scorn
on your Majesty's Parliament now sitting there, and to discourage your
Majesty's Protestant Subjects who have faithfully served your Majesty in that
Parliament.

4. Proposition: That all Indictments, Attainders, Outlaries, in the Kings
Bench or elsewhere since the said seventh day of August 1641. and all Leters
Patents, Grants, Leases, Custod, Bends, Recognizances, and all other Records,
Act or Acts depending thereupon, or in prejudice of the said Catholics, or
any of them, be taken off the file, annulled and declared void first by your
Majesty's Proclamation, and after by Act to be passed in a free Parliament.
Answer. This we conceive to be a very bold Proposition, not warranted, as we
also conceive by any example, and tending to introduce an ill president in
after times, for it was never seen that Records were taken off the file, but
where there was some corruption, or fraud, or some illegal or unjust carriage
used in and concerning the procuring or making up of such Records, and the same
first well proved upon due examination. And it may not only conceal, but in
some sort seem to justify their abominable treasons, murders, cruelties,
massacres, and plunders, acted against your Majesty's Person, Crown and
Dignity, upon the persons of your Majesty's most loyal protestant Subjects in
that Kingdom, and encourage the papists there to do the like again; besides
the discouragement it may beget in your Majesty's Officers and Subjects to do
their duties in the like insurrections which may happen hereafter, which also
may prove very prejudicial to your Majesty's rights and revenues, if the
Records to support the forfeitures wherein many of them are or may be grounded
should be taken off the file and cancelled.

5. Proposition. That inasmuch as, under color of such Outlaries and
Attainders, debts due unto the said Catholics have been granted, levied, and
disposed of: and of the other side, that debts due upon the said Catholics to
those of the adverse party have been levied and disposed to public use: That
therefore all debts be by Act of Parliament mutually released, or all to stand
in statu quo, notwithstanding any grant or disposition. Answer. We humbly
conceive, that in times of peace and most settled government, when the course of
Law and Justice is most open and best observed, that the debts due to the
Crown, and actually levied and paid in to your Majesty's use ought not to be
restored, though the Records of the forfeitures should be legally reversed,
which is far from the present case; and this proposition tends to cross
that just right of your Majesty, and to make the disposition by the confederate
popish Rebels of debts due to Protestants, and by the said Rebels by fraud and
force levied and disposed in maintenance of their Rebellion, which cunningly
they call by the name of public uses, to be in equal degree to the debts
owing by the Rebels, and by them all forfeited, and many of them by Law duly
levied, which is a most unequal and unjust thing; and the said Proposition
cannot nor does make offer to have the popish Confederates cut off from the
debts due to them, which they have justly forfeited, but only for a color of
consideration to have the Protestants lose such debts justly due to them as
have been unjustly taken from them who have done no act at all to forfeit them.

6. Proposition. That the late Offices taken or found upon feigned or old
titles since the year 1634. to entitle your Majesty to several Countries in
Connaught, Thomond, and in the Counties of Typperarie, Limrick, Kilkenny, and
Wickloe, be vacated, and taken off the file, and the possessors settled and
secured in their ancient estates by Act of Parliament. And that the like Act of
limitation of your Majesty's titles for the security of the estates of your
Subjects in that Kingdom be passed in the said Parliament, as was enacted in
the 21 year of His late Majesty's Reign in this Kingdom. Ans. We know not of
any Offices found on feigned Titles, nor what the Confederates may demand, in
respect of any graces promised by your Majesty which we intend not, nor have
any occasion to dispute, but we humbly conceive that all those who have
committed Treason in the late Rebellion, subsequent to your Majesty's promise
of those graces, have thereby forfeited the benefit thereof, together with the
Lands to which the said graces might else have related, and so their whole
estates are now justly fallen to your Majesty, by their Rebellion, which we
conceive is of great importance for your Majesty's service, to be taken into
consideration: As first; with regard to the Statutes made in the present
Parliament of England. Secondly, by the necessary increase of your Revenue,
decayed by the present Rebellion. Thirdly, the abolishing of the evil customs
of the Irish, and preservation of Religion, Laws, and Government there.
Fourthly, the satisfaction of your Protestant Subjects losses in some measure.
Fifthly, the Arrers of your Majesty's Army, and other debts contracted for that
war, and for preservation of that Kingdom to your Majesty. Sixthly, the
bringing in of more British upon the Plantations. Seventhly, the building of
some walled Towns, in remote and desolate places, for the security of that
Kingdom, and your good Subjects there. Eighthly, the taking of the Natives from
their former dependencie on their Chieftains, who usurped an absolute power
over them, to the diminution of your Regal Power, and to the oppression of the
Inferiors.

7. Propos. That all marks of incapacity imposed upon the Natives of that
Kingdom, to purchase or acquire Lands, Leases, Offices, or Hereditaments, be
taken away by act of Parliament, and the same to extend to the securing of
Purchases, Leases, or Grants already made; And that for the education of Youth,
an Act be passed in the next Parliament, for the erecting of one or more Inns
of Court, Universities, Free, and Common Schools. Ans. This we conceive
concerns some of the late Plantations, and no other part of that Kingdom,
and that the restriction herein mentioned is found to be of great use,
especially for the indifferency of Trialls, strength of the Government, and
for Trade, and Traffic; And we humbly conceive, that if other Plantations
shall not proceed for the settling and securing of that Kingdom, and that no
restraint be made of Papists buying, or purchasing of the Protestants out of
their former Plantations, where they were prudently settled, though now cast out
of their estates, by the late Rebellion, and unable to Plant the same again,
for want of means, and therefore probably upon easy terms will part with
their estates to the Confederates, that those Plantations will be destroyed, to
the great prejudice of your Majesty's service, and endangering of the safety of
that Kingdom. Touching bearing of Offices, we humbly conceive that their
nonconformity to the Laws and Statutes of that Kingdom, is the only mark of
incapacity imposed upon them; and we humbly conceive that they ought not to
expect to be more capable there, then the English Natives are here in England,
in like case. For Schools in Ireland, there are diverse settled in all parts of
that Kingdom already, by the Laws and Statutes of that Realm; And if any
person well affected, shall erect and endow any more Schools there, at their
own charges, so that the Schoolmaster, and scholars may be governed according
to the Laws, Customs, and orders of England, and the best of Free-schools here,
we cannot apprehend any just exceptions thereunto: But touching Universities,
and Inns of Court, we humbly conceive that this part of the Proposition
savoureth of some desire to become Independent upon England, or to make a
separation in the Religion, and Laws of the Kingdom, which can never be
truly happy, but in the good unity of both, in the true Protestant Religion,
and in the Laws of England: For (as for matter of charge) such of the Natives
as are desirous to breed their sons for learning in Divinity, can be well
contented to send them to the Universitie of Lovain, Doway, and other Popish
places in Foreign Kingdoms, And for Civill-law, or Physic, to Padua, and
other places, which draws a great treasure yearly out of your Majesty's
Dominions, but will send few or none of them to Oxford, or Cambridge, where
they might as cheaply be bred up, and become as learned, which course we
conceive is holden out of their pride, and disaffection toward this Kingdom,
and the true Religion here professed. And for the Laws of the Land, which are
for the Common Law agreeable to England, and so for the greatest part of the
Statutes, the Innes of Court in England are sufficient, and the Protestants
came thither without grudging; And it is a means to civilize them after the
English Customs, to make them familiar and in love with the Language and
Nation, to preserve the Law in the purity. when the Professors of it shall
draw from one original fountain, and see the manner of the practice of it in
the same great Channells where his Majesty's Courts of Justice of England do
flow most clearly, whereas by separation of the Kingdoms in the places of their
principal instruction, when their foundations in learning are to be laid, a
degenerate corruption in Religion, and Justice may happily be introduced and
spread, with much more difficulty to be corrected and restrained afterward by
any discipline to be used in Ireland, or punishments there to be inflicted, for
departing from the true grounds of things which are best preserved in unity,
when they grow out of the same root, then if such Universities, and Innes of
Court as are proposed should be granted; All which we humbly submit to your
Majesty's most pious and prudent confideration and judgment.

8. Propos. That the Offices and places of Command. Honor, Profit, and Trust
within that Kingdom, be conferred upon Roman Catholics Natives in equallity
and indifferencis with your Majesty's other Subjects. Answ. We humbly conceive
that the Roman Catholic Natives in Ireland, may have the like Offices, and
Places, as the Roman Catholics Natives of England here have, and not
otherwise: Howbeit we conceive that in the generallity they have not deserved
so much by their late Rebellion; Therefore we see not why they should be
endowed with any new, or further Capacities, or Privileges then they have by
the Laws, and Statutes now in force in that Kingdom.

9. Propos. That the insupportable oppression of your Subjects, by reason of
the Court of Wards, and respit of homage be taken away, and a certain Revenew
in lieu thereof fetled upon your Majesty without diminution of your Majesty's
profits. Answ. We know of no oppression by reason of the Court of Wards, and we
humbly conceive, that the Court of Wards is of great use, for theraising of
your Majesty's Revenews, the preservation of your Majesty's Tenures, and
chiefly the education of the Gentry, in the Protestant Religion, and in
civility of learning, and good manners, who otherwise would be brought up in
ignorance and barbarism, their estates be ruined by their kindred and friends,
and continue their dependencie on the chief Lords, to the great prejudice of
your Majesty's service, and Protestant Subjects: And there being no color of
exception to your Majesty's just Title to Wardships, we know not why the taking
away of your Court concerning the same, should be so pressed, unless it be to
prevent the education of the Lords and Gentry, that fall Wards in the
Protestant Religion: For that part of this Proposition which concerns respit
of Homage, we humbly conceive it reasonable that some way may be settled for
that, if it stand with your Majesty's good pleasure, without prejudice to your
Majesty, or your Protestant Subjects.

10. Propos. That no Lord not estated in that Kingdom, or estated, and not
resident, shall have Vote in the said Parliament by proxy or otherwise, and
none admitted to the House of Commons, but such as shall be estated, and
resident within the Kingdom. Answ. We humbly conceive, that in the year 1641.
by the graces which your Majesty then granted to your Subjects of Ireland, the
matter of this Proposition was in a fair way regulated by your utter abolishing
of blank Proxies, and limitting Lords present, and attending in the Parliament
of Ireland, that no one of them should be capable of more Proxies then two;
and prescribing the Peers of that Kingdom not there resident, to purchase
fitting proportions of Land in Ireland, within five years, from the last of
July 1641. or else to lose their Votes, till they should make such purchases;
which purchases by reason of the troubles happening in that Kingdom, and which
have continued for two years and a half, have not peradventure yet been made;
And therefore your Majesty may now be pleased, and may take just occasion to
enlarge the time for five years, from the time when that Kingdom may again be
settled in a happy and firm peace; And as to Members of the House of Commons
the same is most fit, as we humbly conceive, to be regulated by the Laws and
Statutes of that Kingdom.

11. Propos. That an Act be passed in the next Parliament declaratory, that
the Parliament of Ireland is a free Parliament of it self, independent of, and
not subordinate to the Parliament of England; And that the Subjects of Ireland,
are immediately subject to your Majesty, as in right of your Crown; And that the
Members of the said Parliament of Ireland, and all other the Subjects of
Ireland are independent, and no way to be ordered, or concluded by the
Parliament of England, and are only to be ordered and governed within that
Kingdom, by your Majesty and such Governors as are or shall be there
appointed, and by the Parliament of that Kingdom, according to the Laws of the
Land. Answ. This Proposition concerns your Majesty's high Courts of Parliament
both of England, and Ireland, and is beyond our abilities (who are not
acquainted with the Records and Presidents of this nature) to give any answer
unto, and therefore we humbly desire your Majesty's pardon for not answering
unto the same.

12. Propos. That the assumed power of jurisdiction in the Council boatd, of
determining of all manner of Causes, be limited to matters of State, and all
Pattents, Estates, and Grants, illegally and extrajudicially avoided there, or
elsewhere, be left in state as before, and the parties grieved their heirs or
assigns till legal eviction. Answ. The Councell-Table has always exercised
jurisdiction in some cases, ever since the English Government was settled in
that Kingdom, and is of so long continuance in cases of some natures, as the
beginning thereof appears not, which seems to be by prescription, and has
always been armed with power to examine upon Oath, as a Court of Justice, or in
nature of a Court of Justice in Cases of some natures, and may be very
necessary still in many Cases, especially for the present, till your Majesty's
Laws may more generally be received in that Kingdom; And we conceive that
Board is so well limited by Printed Instructions, in your Majesty's Royal
Fathers time, and by your Majesty's graces in the 17. year of your Reign, that
it needs for the present little or no further Regulating at all, howbeit they
humbly refer it to your Majesty's great wisdom and goodness, to do therein as
to Law and Justice shall appertain.

Propos. 13. That the Statute of the 11.12. and 13. year of Queen Elizabeth
concerning Staple commodities be repealed, reserving to his Majesty, lawful
and just poundage, and a book of Rates to be settled by an indifferent Committee
of both Houses, for all Commodities. Answ. The matter of this Proposition is
settled in a fitting and good way by your Majesty already, as we conceive,
amongst the graces granted by your Majesty to your people of Ireland, in the 17
year of your Majesty's Reign; to which we humbly refer our selves.

Propos. 14. That in as much as the long continuance of the chief Governor or
Governors of that Kingdom, in that place of so great eminency, and power,
has been a principal occasion that much Tyranny and oppression has been
exercised upon the Subjects of that Kingdom; That your Majesty will be
pleased to continue such Governors hereafter but for three years: And that
none, once employed therein, be appointed for the same again until the
expiration of six years next after the end of the said three years: And that an
Act pass to dis-inhable such Governor or Governors during their Government,
directly or indirectly in Use, Trust, or other wise, to make any manner of
purchase or Acquisition of any Manners, Lands, Tenements, or Hereditaments
within that Kingdom, other then from your Majesty, your heirs or successors.
Ans. We humbly conceive that this Proposition tends to lay a falls and
scandalous aspersion upon your Majesty's gracious government over Ireland, and
that it trencheth very high upon your Wisdom, Justice, and Power, and under
color of supposed corruptions pretended to be in the greatest Officer that
Commands under your Majesty there, if he continue so long in his government
as may well enable him to find out and discover the true state of that
Kingdom, and the dangerous dispositions and designs of the Popish party
there, to prevent him therein, and to turn him out from doing service before or
as soon as he is thoroughly informed and experienced how to do the same, and then
to hold him excluded so long that in all likelihood he shall not live to come
to that place the second time, which we humbly conceive will be a great
discouragement to any person of honor and fortune, to serve your Majesty in
that high trust: And for their purchasing Lands in that Kingdom, your Majesty
may be pleased to leave them to the Laws, and punish them severely if they
commit any offense, or exercise any oppressions under color of purchasing of
any lands or estates whatsoever.

Prop. 15. That an Act may be passed in the next Parliament, for the raising
and settling of Trained Bands within the several Counties of that Kingdom,
as well to prevent foreign invasions, as to render them the more serviceable
and ready for your Majesty's occasions, as cause shall require. Answ. The
having of Trained bands in Ireland, for the present cannot, under favor be for
your Majesty's service or the safety of that Kingdom, for that the Protestants
by the sad effects of the late Rebellion are so much destroyed, that the said
Bands must consist in effect altogether of the confederate Catholics, and to
continue them in Arms stored with Ammunition, and made ready for service by
mustering and often Trayning will prove under color of advancing your
Majesty's service against foreign invasion, a meet guard and power of Popish
Forces, always in readiness to protect the Popish confederates, and by force
and Arms (according to their late oaths and Protestations) to execute all
their cruel designs for extirpation of the Protestant Religion and English
Government, both which they mortally hate, howsoever in cunning they dissemble
it, and to prevent the settling an Army of good Protestants, without which your
Majesty's good Subject cannot live securely there.

Propos. 16. That an Act of Oblivion be passed in the next free Parliament, to
extend to all your Majesty's said Catholic Subjects, and their adherents for
all manner of offenses Capital, Criminal, and Personal and the said Act to
extend to all Goods and Chattels, Customs, Measne, Profits, Prizes, Arrears,
of Rents taken received or incurred since these troubles. Answ. We humbly pray
that the Laws of force be taken into consideration, and do humbly conceive that
your Majesty in honor and Justice may forbear to discharge or release any
Actions, Suits, Debts, or Interests, whereby your Majesty's Protestant
Subjects, who have committed no offense against your Majesty or your Laws,
should be barred or deprived of any of their Legal remedies or just demands,
which by any of your Majesty's Laws and Statutes, they may have against the
Popish confederates, who are the only delinquents, or any of their party, for
or in respect of any wrongs done unto them, or any of their Ancestors or
Predecessors, in or concerning their Lands, Goods, or Estates, since the
contriving or breaking forth of Rebellion, The said confederates having without
provocation shed so much innocent blood, and acted so many cruelties, as cannot
be paralleled in any story: And we conceive it to be high presumption in them
upon so weak grounds, to propound an Act of Oblivion in such general terms,
some of the confederates having been contrivers or Actors of such cruel
Murders and other Acts of Inhumanity, as cry to God and your Sacred Majesty
for Justice, and they having of your Majesty's Revenues, Customs, Subsidies,
and other rights of your Crown in their hands, or destroyed by them to the
value of 200000. l. and more.

Propos. 17. Forasmuch as your Majesty's said Catholic Subjects have been
taxed with many Inhumane cruelties which they never committed; Your Majesty's
said suppliants therefore for their vindication, and to manifest to all the
world, their desire to have such heinous offenses punished, and the Offenders
brought to Austice; Do desire that in next the Parliament, all notorious
murders breaches of Quarter, and Inhumane cruelties, committed of either side,
may be questioned in the said Parliament if your Majesty so think fit; And such
as shall appear to be guilty, to be excepted out of the said Act of Oblivion,
and punished according to their deserts.

Forasmuch Dread Sovereign as the ways of our address unto your Majesty for
apt remedies unto our grievances were hither to debarred us but now at length
through your benign grace and favor laid open. We do humbly present these in
pursuance of the said Remonstrance, which granted, your said subjects are ready
to contribute the 10000. Men, as in their Remonstrance is specified toward the
suppressing of the unnatural Rebellion now in this Kingdom, and will further
expose their lives and fortunes to serve your Majesty, as occasion shall
require.

Answer. We conceive this Proposition is made but for a flourish, and if the
confederates be so desirous to try their innocence as they pretend, they need
not stay for another Parliament, in Ireland, but submit to that which is now in
being, which is an equal and just Parliament, as in some of our reasons
touching that point is expressed, And the offering to draw it to a new
Parliament is in effect to desire that they may be their own Judges, for as
that Kingdom is now imbroiled and wasted, the chief delinquents or their
confederates will be so prevalent a faction in the next Parliament, that they
will be able, and doubtless will clear all the Popish party how guilty soever,
and condemn the Protestants, how Innocent soever.

These Answers to the High and unexpected demands of the confederate Rebels we
have framed in humble obedience to your Majesty's directions, but being very
sensible as of the weight and great importance of the business, so also of our
own weakness and want of time, and well knowing that some of your Majesty's
Privy Councillors, Judges and Officers of that Kingdom, are now in Town, sent
for over, and here attending by your Majesty's command, who by their long
observation and experience of the affairs and state of Ireland, are better able
to give your Majesty more full and satisfactory answers touching the premises
then we can; and conceiving that the Collections in answer to the said
confederates Remonstrance, which we humbly presented to your Majesty the 29. of
the last Month of April may in many things give your Majesty more light, then
these our Answers do or can: We humbly beseech your Majesty that the said
Privy Councillors, Judges, and Officers as occasion shall require may be
called upon, and heard, to give your Majesty the better satisfaction in these
Particulars, and that to the same purpose the book of the said Collection may
be perused and considered of as your Majesty shall find most requisite.

After reading of which Propositions and Answers thereunto; the King asked the
Protestant Agents, Whether they had Answered unto the Rebels Propositions as
they were to be granted by him, in Law and Justice, and fit for the security of
the Protestants of Ireland, or prudentially as the times were, Who humbly made
answer to his Majesty, That they looked upon the Rebels Propositions as they
appeared to them destructive to his Majesty, his Laws, Government, and
Protestant Subjects of Ireland. Then the Earl of Bristoll said, That if they
asked what by law and Justice was due from the Rebels, their Answers were
full; But now the King expected from the said Agents, What prudentially was fit
for his Majesty to do, seeing the Protestants were not in a condition to
defend themselves, and that the King would not admit the Protestants to join
with the new Scots, or any other that had taken the Covenant;

The Lord Digby upon motion of the Protestant Agents for further time to
answer, said, It was good to set down those questions in writing, and expect
their answers to them.

Then the King asked them, What would become of the Protestants in Ireland if
the Rebels Agents should break off their Treaty, which was to be feared they
would do; if they had not their Propositions for the most part yielded unto.

The Protestant Agents Answered his Majesty, That they conceived that the
Rebels Agents might be brought to better terms, if they were held unto it; and
that they were confidently assured before their coming out of Ireland, that
the Lord Muskery refused to come into England with limited Instructions, but
would be at liberty to do as he should see cause.

Then the Protestants Agents were commanded to withdraw, And since that time
were no further called upon.

And the said Protestant Agents knowing by experience how that the said Rebels
had in all parts of the Kingdom broken the Articles of Cessation, having begun
that course within 3 days after the said Articles of Cessation were published,
by taking away forceably and detaining, (notwithstanding many complaints
thereof made) 369 head of choice English Cows, or there-abouts from the poor
Inhabitants of the Suburbs of the City of Dublin, and by like proceedings in
all parts of the Kingdom, in taking of diverse Castles, Forts, and Houses, and
great quantities of Corn and Cattle, some by force and some by fraud, and by
burning diverse others, and by withholding diverse contributions in all parts of
the Kingdom, yielded to the Protestant Forces, until the Cessation, to the
utter destruction of the Protestant Party in diverse parts of that Kingdom. The
said Protestant Agents in the conclusion of the Collection which they had made
and presented to his Majesty in Answer of the said Remonstrance, did make
mention of the said breaches, and also of the failers of payment of the far
greater part of the 30000. l. by them agreed on, to be paid by the Rebels to
his Majesty's use, upon the conclusion of the said Cessation, to be applied
toward the maintenance of the Army there, and also of their extreme bad and
unseasonable payment of that small part thereof, which they had paid, in
manifest breach of their undertaking, the said failers having occasioned heavy
Taxes to be laid upon the poor Protestant Inhabitants, and necessitated the
Soldiers through want to pillage and plunder thousands of his Majesty's good
Subjects. And the said Protestant Agents did offer to make proof thereof, and
also that the said confederate Roman Catholics had broken all the said
Articles of Cessation, humbly expecting reparation therein, but not hearing any
further thereof, and observing that the said Sir William Stewart and the rest
of the Gentlemen abovenamed, which were sent for out of Ireland, had by
Authority from the Lord Lieutenant and Council, informed his Majesty of 20
several complaints of notorious breaches made by the said Rebels of the said
Articles; whereof no right or reparation could be had there, notwithstanding
many complaints there made. They the said Agents delivered to the said Sr Will.
Stewart, and the rest above named about the 10th of May 1644. a brief of many
more great injuries done by the Rebels to the Protestant Party, contrary to the
said Articles of Cessation, especially in Conaght, where many of the Soldiers
were forced there by to disband, desiring them to acquaint the Lords with the
same, to the end that some course might be taken for redress, and afterward
they understood by them that they had acquainted the Lords of the Committee
therewith, and that the Lords said that they would acquaint the Agents of the
Rebels therewith; but heard no more thereof: neither were the said Protestant
Agents ever called to make proof thereof, or of any other their Allegations, or
to receive hearing therein. One particular instance of a notorious breach of
the Articles of Cessation, which we produced at Oxford, we have here inserted,
being from one of the bloodiest Rebels, who exercised the place of Governor of
the County of Fermanagh.

Com. Fermanagh.

FOrasmuch as the daily resort and concourse of Catholics since the
Cessation, into English Garrisons, might bring a great deal of Inconveniency
unto our proceedings: I do therefore hereby, by Virtue of the Lord Generals
Authority given me in that behalf, and especially to avoid the eminent peril,
that hereafter might arise thereof, straightly charge and command all manner of
persons, of what rank, quality, or condition soever they be, of the Irish
Nation of this County; not to visit, confer, talk, or parley, to, or with any
person or persons; of, in, or belonging to the Garrison of Eniskillen, upon
pain of death, and of forfeiting all the goods, and Chattels belonging to every
such offender, or offenders: And likewise that none of the Inhabitants of this
County, on the West side of Loghern, live, dwell, or inhabit no nearer to
Eniskillen, then the River of Arny; until further directions be given, to the
contrary, upon pain of the foresaid forfeiture and penalty. Dated the 25
November. 1643.

Signed, Rory Maguire.


The 12. of May Sir Robert Talbot, and Dermot mac Teag o Bryan, two of the
Rebels Agents, went away out of Oxford toward Ireland.

The 22. of May 1644. the Lord Viscount Muskery and the rest of the Rebels
Agents went away from Oxford toward Ireland, but what dispatch they had, the
Protestant Agents do not know.

The 26. of May the Protestant Agents seeing the Irish Agents were gone, waited
on Mr. Secretary Nicholas, and desired him to know his Majesty's pleasure and
commands, and whether they should expect any further answer concerning their
Agency from his Majesty, And the next day Mr. Secretary Nicholas told them.
That his Majesty commanded him to know of the Committee for Irish affairs;
Whether they had any thing more to say to the Protestant Agents, And the same
day Mr. Secretary Nicholas told the said Agents, That the Committee saw no
reason to detain them any longer, and that he would move his Majesty for their
dispatch.

The 30. of May M. Secretary Nicholas presented the Protestant Agents to his
Majesty, to kiss his hand, who told them, That he had written to the Marquess
of Ormond concerning the Protestants of Ireland, That he would use his best
endeavors for them there, if he were able, as he did for himself here; And he
said, That he meant his good Protestants, and not such as did either take or
adhere to such as had taken the Covenant.

By all this which has been faithfully Related, and several other
Circumstances, it plainly appears, that the Rebels of Ireland intentions are
and have been for the extirpation of the Protestants and Protestant Religion,
and how far forth they have been countenanced therein.
