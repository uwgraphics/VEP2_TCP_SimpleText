A general Band voluntarily made by the good Subjects of the Kings Majesty of
Scotland, for the preservation of his Highness person, and of his undoubted
Right to the Crowns of England and Ireland.
FOrasmuch as the Providence of God hes established Kingdoms and Monarchies,
and hes appointed Kings and Princes to bear rule over the same, repre^enting
his Divine power in ministration of Justice to their Subjects, and honoring
him by the establishing true and Christian Religion according to his word. In
contemplating of which benefits to the redownding of the people by the lawful
authority of the Prince, they are bound to love, reverence and obey, their
native Sovereigns, to procure at their uttermost power, their standing and
advancement or estate; To resist and withstand all and whatsoever practizes or
attempts which may be hurtful to their person or estate; Therefore we
undersubscrivand the natural and loyal borne Subjects of this Realm, calling
to memory and finding daily before our eyes the great felicity, and inestimable
comfort wherewith the most happy and gracious Reign of our Soverai^ne has
enriched us, and ^he wonderful q^ie^nesse wherewith we a^e by Gods providence
and his Highness p^udent government, in so universal troubles of all Europe
being blessed, acknowledging our selves most justly bound with our Lives*
lands, goods, and geere in his defense and safety against whomsoever, of what
Nation, degree or quality soever they be that would directly or indirectly
a^tempt any harm against his Sacred person or estate; Therefore we and every
one of us conjunctly and s^verally in the presence of the Almighty power; By
whom Princes rule (whom we call upon, not only as a me^ne but the just avenger
of s^ke as shall violate and contravene these pres^nts) of our own free motive
and will binds and obliseth o^r selves ilke one of Us to others, in that bond
and holy Society whereby we solemnly vow and promise before the great God,
with our whole powers, bodies, lives, lands, goods, children, servants, and all
that are under our Commandment, truly and faithfully to serve and humbly to
obey our said Sovereign Lord, against all estates, dignities and earthly
Princes whatsoever, to invade and pursue by all manner of hostility, as well by
force of Arms, as by all other means, all sorts of persons, their Accomplices,
assistants and partaker^, as shall attempt or undertake, by Deed, Counsel, or
consent to any practice that in any respect may tend to the harm of his
Majesty's most Royal person, honor, estate or dignity, and shall never desist
from any manner of hostile pursuit of such traitorous. Tyrants, till they,
their Counselors, Leaders and partakers be all utterly routed out, to the
Example of others upon then spearance of impunity to attempt the like. And
because Almighty God amongst other his enestimable Blessi^gs which he has
multiplied upon our said Sovereign Lord, to ^i^ glory and our great comfort,
has established the undoubted Right of the Crown of England and Ireland ^o
his Majesty's most Royal Person, which notwithstanding diverse persons upon
frivolous and impertinent pretensions, would go about to impugn contrary to
his Birthright and the most ancient and allowed Laws of both the Realms,
whereof we upon our bounden duty to our native Sovereign, and moved in
Conscience to advance the righteous Successor, solemnly vow and protest by the
name of the great God, not only at our uttermost power and state to maintain
and defend our Sovereign in his undoubted Right and Title to the Crowns of
England and Ireland, again all other pretendors whatsoever, but likewise shall
readily without any drift or excuse upon whatsoever pretext, bestow our selves,
our lives, Children, servants, friends, goods and geere whatsoever, in the
pursuit thereof against whatsoever persons that shall hinder, impugn, or
withstand his Majesty or his Heirs, in the peaceable enjoying or possessing of
the said Crowns of England and Ireland, and shall by all forcible means take
the uttermost revenge upon them, their Leaders, Counselors, partakers or
assistants, that by any means possible we or any of us can Excogitate or
devise, and never desist till we have established our dearest Sovereign, or
(in case of his Decease before, which God forbid) his Heirs or Successors in
the Royal Kingdom of Jreland, and preacable fruition of the same. And for the
more Corroboration of this our voluntary Bond and entry in so holy and lawful
a Society, we and every one of us under subscriv^nd, confirm the holy Contents
thereof by our solemn oaths taken upon the holy Scriptures with this express
Condition; That none of us shall upon any respect of persons, or cause for
fear of danger, or hope of Reward, separate our selves f om this Condition,
nor fail in any part of the premises during our life-times. And giff we do
the contrary (as God forbid) That we by our most gracious Sovereign, his
Heirs and the rest of our Society, be not only reputed as perjured persons
unworthy to bear Office in any Christien Realm, or civil Common weal, but
al^o to be prosecuted as most vilde and detestable Traitors and public enemies
to God, our sovereign Prince, and na^ive Country; To the which punishment and
pain, we do voluntarily submit our selves and every one of us without
appellation or reclamation, like as we are content that these presents be
ratified by the State by the next Parliament, and presently inserted and
registered in the Books of the Council ad futuram rei memoriam, and that
Execution royal may be directed thereupon in form as before. In witness
whereof to this present Band subscrivand with our Hands, our seals of Arms
^^e affixed, etc.

FINIS.
