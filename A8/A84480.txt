By the Council of State. A PROCLAMATION.
THe Council of State being Informed, That since the Officers of the Armies
under the Lord Generals Command, by their late Humble Remonstrance and Address,
Declared their resolution to observe such Commands as they shall receive from
His Excellency, or the Council of State, or the Parliament when Assembled; some
Persons designing to obstruct the Nations Settlement, have not been wanting to
endeavor the removal of some in the Army from their stability and temper; And
to accomplish so mischievous a Design, have scattered and fomented (among other
untruths) false rumors, That there is an Intention to deprive the Soldiers of
their Arrears of Pay; Against which Attempt the Council are well persuaded the
fidelity and Interest of the Soldiers will be a good Security: Yet to the
intent a Report so false in it self, and so destructive in its aim, may not
make the more easy Impressions upon any, through its passing uncontradicted,
and thereby gratify those only, who seek advantages, by lengthning out our
troubles. The Council of State do hereby Declare, That it is not in their
intention or thoughts, to retrench or abate any part of the Arrears, that are,
or shall be due to the Soldiers, whilst they continue in the Army, and in
their obedience: But that on the contrary, it shall be their endeavor to
encourage them, by taking care for satisfying their Arrears, as soon as there
shall be opportunity, in such sort as to make an actual, as well as verbal
confutation, to so false a suggestion.

Friday 13 April. 1660. At the Council of State at Whitehall.
ORdered, That this Proclamation be forthwith Printed and Published.

JOHN RUSHWORTH, Clerk of the Council.
