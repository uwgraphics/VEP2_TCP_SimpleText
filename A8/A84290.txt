AN EXHORTATION OF THE Friends and Brethren of London TO ALL YOUTHS and YOUNG
MEN; Who are Children of Friends, and Apprentices, or have been Apprentices to
Friends, who are Convinced in their Judgments of the Way of Truth, and
inhabiting in and about this City.
FRIENDS,
WE whom the Lord has made sensible of his Everlasting Day, and given a sight
of the Glory thereof unto, cannot but be sensible of a Great Care upon our
spirits for the Preserving the Honor and Glory of that Blessed Day of God,
from being again any ways Veiled or Darkened by any thing on our parts, that is
contrary thereunto: And this Care and Tenderness does not only extend to keep
us Watchful and Diligent in our own Particulars, but to have a Watchful Eye
over Others, who do profess the same Name and Truth with us; desiring from our
very Hearts, That as it has pleased God to Visit us with his Everlasting Love,
and to make his Power shine forth in this our Generation, so the Generations to
come may know the spreading and Increase of the same, as we have done; which
cannot be, but by a True, Diligent, Watchful Abiding in the Light of the Lord
Jesus, which was unto us, and will be unto God's People in all Ages, the
Morning Star, which leads unto the Day of Salvation: And while our Minds are
exercised concerning these things, To our great Grief we see many Youths and
Young Men (who are Children of Friends, and Apprentices, or have been
Apprentices to Friends) who are Convinced in their Judgments of the Way of
Truth, and are called to be the Plants of the next-coming Generation, to
witness forth the Brightness of the Day of the Lord, and to Honor him in a
Holy Conversation: Who, notwithstanding the great Love of God showed to them,
in making known his Love and Way of Truth to them, in their Tender Years, yet
do not Answer the Love of God to them, as they ought to do, nor Walk Closely
with the Lord in his Way of Holiness, nor have had regard unto the Agreements
and Covenants unto which they in their Indentures have Consented, which Truth
would have taught to have performed with a diligent Respect and Care unto the
Equity thereof: But on the contrary, many hold a Profession of the Blessed
Truth in a Traditional Belief and Notion of the Good Testimonies which the
Lord's People have born, and do not sink down into Lowliness of mind, as
becomes the Gospel; but grow Heady and Stubborn, and are puffed up in
Knowledge, and are Exalted above the Cross, and so let that Nature at Liberty
unto which the Cross was and is appointed; and then that Nature leads into
Looseness and Wantonness, and into Pride and Headiness, and Covenant Breaking
both with God and Man, as well under a Profession of Truth, as under any other
Profession, from which they seem to stand separated; and this has brought
Dishonor to the Name of our God; and by thus Walking, many good Parents have
been Dishonored, and Masters Wronged, and Truth Reproached, and the Holy
Spirit of God in his People Grieved many a time.

Therefore we do in the Name and Power of God, in which we stand Witnesses for
God, exhort and admonish all Young Men, who do profess the precious Truth of
God, that they be Careful and Diligent in their Places, as becomes the Truth;
and that they be Obedient unto their Parents and Masters, as God has
commanded; and that they take heed of breaking those Good and Wholesome Rules and
Orders, unto which themselves have Subscribed; for, Covenant-breakers the Lord
will Judge. And we do exhort all Young Men, That they Honor the Truth in their
Places, as becomes their Professions, that so they may Answer the Power of God,
and live in it, by which they may come to be sensible of the Life and Unity
that is in the Church of Christ. And we do truly desire, That the Power may be
brought over the Rebellious Stubborn Nature, and a Stop thereby may be put to
the Extravagant Courses taken by some professing the Truth: And therefore, if
any Young Men, who do hear this our Exhortation, does not submit thereunto, but
do hereafter walk Loosly and Disorderly, either in Disobeying their Parents who
walk in the Truth, or in Wronging, or being Unfaithful to their Masters, or in
Spending their Time in Idleness or in Evil Company, and bringing Dishonor upon
the Truth of God, and will not hear the Wholesome Counsel of their Parents and
Masters, and reform their Evil Courses; then we desire that such Fathers and
Masters may acquaint a few Staid Sound Friends with the Matter in time, who may
deal with such Young Men in the Counsel and Wisdom of God; and if they will not
hear their Admonition, that then they may acquaint the Monthly Meeting
therewith, that so such may be proceeded against; and if they will not yet Hear
and Reform, that Truth may be cleared of such Disorderly Walkers, and Testimony
may be given out against them, that their Professing the pure Truth may be no
Cloak to their Unrighteous Actions, nor no Stumbling Block may be laid by them
in the way of them who believe not: But that the Testimony of God may be kept
Pure, as we received it in the Beginning, and may be committed Pure unto the
Generations to come.

Given forth by the Friends and Brethren of London, at their Meeting held
there, this 25th day of the 9th Month, 1672.
