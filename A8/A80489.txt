The Copy of a Letter, sent from Two thousand Youthful Citizens, to the
Menacing Marshall of the King's Bench, Sir John Lenthall.
Sir,
IT is not unknown to you, that many of your right-despising faction have
wrongfully termed us irregular Roundheads, and self-willed Seperatists; but
our well grounded Actions, shall publish to the world, as well the serenity of
our intention, as the verity of your delusion; For though we be Round-headed,
we are not hollow hearted; And if we do affect retired separation, it follows
we must hate an insinuating Companion; such as you are, and would be, could you
illegally get (where your conversation's not desired) an unjust possession;
which (notwithstanding your power with the Judges, and many unmanly menacies)
your sinister endeavor shall never obtain; We being unanimously resolved at an
hours warning, to meet you armed, and give Battalia to the Sheriff of Surrey,
if he be so foolhardy as to assist you in the justification of so palpable an
injury. For we (who are the real honourers of the Name, and memory of the
Middletons) will not see the son of that never enough honored Father, who
was the glory of our City, unjustly suffer by a litigious Jackallent; but in
vindication of his lawful Title, will unhouse our swelling veins of every
warm tennantable drop within them. Therefore in due consideration of our fixed
resolution, we friendly do advise you, at length to leave of all your hate
procuring undertakings, that make you despicable to the knowing world, and
only, to attempt honest and noble things that are bravely justifiable, and that
alone can return you amiable to those, who are rather, the desirers of your
conversion, then confusion.

Dated die Martis, secundo Martj, Anno Revocationis Primo. Your friends, or
otherwise, as you make them, Middeltoni-Anti-Lenthalliani. MIDDLIILLLII.
