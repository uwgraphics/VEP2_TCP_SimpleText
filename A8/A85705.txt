A VINDICATION OR JUSTIFICATION OF JOHN GRIFFITH, Esquire AGAINST The horrid,
malicious, and unconscionable Verdict of the Coroners Jury in Cheshire:

Which was packt by the means of that Pocky, Rotten, Lying, Cowardly, and most
perfidious Knave, Sir HVGH CAVLVELEY Knight, only to vent his inveterate
hatred and malice against me.

Printed in the Year, 1648.

A TRVE RELATION of the Business that happened betwixt John Griffith Esquire,
and one William Dod, Servant to Sir Hugh Caulveley, Knight, in Cheshire with
the reasons that occasioned the difference, and the manner and accident of his
Death.
THe business begun thus* It was my fortune coming from London to Chester, to go
with some company to visit Sir Hugh Caulveley who was then prisoner for debt in
the Castle of Chester: he was pleased to use me extreme civilly, and to invite
me the next day to dinner, where I received a great entertainment, and many
expressions of love, and friendship from him; and after few days, I went to my
own house into Carnarvonshire, where I stayed two or three months, but before
I returned out of Wales, Sir Hugh Caulveley was released out of prison, and
come hom to his own house in Cheshire, called Lea Hal; where I going to visit
him, was received with a great deal of kindness and after I had stayed with him
a fortnight, I invited him to my house into Carnarvo shire, where he stayed
with me a week, and before our return back into Cheshire, it pleased God to
visit his house with the flux, and diverse of his servants died of it, and one
of mine, that caught the disease at his house: He at his return was pleased to
say, that God laid this judgment upon him, because he kept a Cook that was a
Papist, and said that he should not thrive, as long as he kept him: Whereupon I
persuaded him to turn him away, which he did accordingly: And this disease
driving him from his house, I went back into Wales to settle my estate, as well
as these distracted times would permit me, and there I stayed a matter of 2
months; then I returned back into England again, thinking to visit Sir Hugh
Caulveley, and the night that I was to come thither, being earnestly invited by
him to do so: An hour or two before I came to the house, a Boy it seemed died
of the Plague, so as before I came thither he and most of his family were gone,
but left word where I should find them; so I went to them that night, and
as soon as I had spoken to him, I returned and lodged at his house, thinking
that there was no danger in the house; for the Boy that died had bin sick above
half a year, so that I did believe that he rather died of a Consumption then of
the Plague; so the next day I waited on Sir Hugh Caulveley again, and after two
or three days he and his Family did return back again to his own house, he
being of the same opinion that I was, that is that the Boy rather died of a
Consumption, then of the Plague: At that time I stayed with him five or six
days, and no sickness did appear, nor was there any body sick in the house:
but during my stay there, I saw some servants whose faces I had not seen
before, and one of them was this man, who they called William Dod, I asked Sir
Hugh what he was, he answered me I have taken him to be my Clark, for my other
Clark died of the Flux, with all Sir Hugh Caulveley told me that he was an
excellent Clark, but that he was a rank Papist. I made him this answer, I
wonder you will keep him then, knowing how unfortunate Papists have been to
you; it is true said he, but I must keep him a while until I can provide my
self with another. I made him this answer, I will see Sir, if you plese, if I
can help you to one. I pray you do so said he, for this man is not only Papist,
but has been most active man all this war against the Parliament, both in
Biston Castle, and diverse other places; hearing this, I replied to Sir Hugh,
Sir, the sooner you part with him the better it will be, for fear least the
Committee comes to know that you have entertained so notorious a Papist, and
prejudice you in your Composition, having not as yet finished it: indeed said
he that is one main reason why I am so willing to part with him, besides I am
resolved never to keep Papists, for they alwais bring me ill luck, and indeed
as he said, so it happened, for within two or three days after I was gone from
his house, the plague brake out again, and diverse fell sick of it, four or five
died of it, some others recovered, and those that had been in Cabbins, and not
sick at all, after a months time or there abouts, he gave them leave to go to
another house that he had called Sayton, and there in a low room to continue,
they being in number five, three men, and two maids, and he, his Lady, and some
few servants went first into Lancashire, and from thence Sir Hugh Caulveley
went to York for to take Physic. In the time of his absence I having little
recreation but coursing, made a match to run a Greyhound of mine, against a
dog of William Smiths, who lived not far from this house of Sir Hugh
Caulveleys, called Sayton, and there being fine Champion fields within a mile
of that place, we appointed to meet there with our gray hounds, which we did
accordingly, and after that we had beaten all the day for hares, and had
decided our match, I being something hungry, sent one of my servants to Sir
Hugh Caulveleys house to Sayton to desire the maids to provide me two or three
dishes of meat, which they did accordingly, nor indeed durst I go into any
^le-house for to eat any thing, for fear of the si^k^es; for Chester was then
cruelly infected with the plague, and the people came daily out of Chester into
those parts, being but two miles of Chester; besides diverse houses in the
Country were infected, so that a man could not certainly know where to go,
without danger. So according to my appointment I took one Mr Powel, and two or
three honest Country Farmers along with me, for to eat that meat which I had
bespok, and before we had done our supper, (for it was late before we came
thither) it fell a raining so hard, and grew so dark, that it was impossible
for me to go home that night, being a foot, and having four long durty miles
(as any was in England) to the house where I lived at. Besides I had the river
of Dee to cross over; so I and my company resolved to sit and talk all night
by the fire side, being five or six in company, besides the servants of the
house, and whilst we were sitting by the fire, coms in a kind of a Bailey of Sir
Hugh Caulveleyes, whose name is Richard Maddocks, who would need^ present me
with a dozen of Ale, and did seem to bid me very welcome: After that, the Ale
being drunk out, he went away and left me and my company together, where we
stayed all night,, and the next morning I paid the maids for the meat, and I
and my company parted from Sir Hughs house together, and went every one of us
home to our particular dwellings, thinking that no exceptions could be taken
at my being there, having so much company with me: but it seems within a day or
two after, this Richard Maddocks being drunk (as it is his constant custom)
came and upbraided the maids, saying thus to them: It is very fine; you think
that my Master has nothing to do with his money, but for you to feast Prince
Griffith withal. I can assure you when my Master knows it, you will have
little thanks for it: The maids made answer (as they sent me word) that I had
nothing but what I paid for, and that it was not any charge to Sir Hugh
Caulveley at all, and that they did believe Sir Hugh would not be offended for
any civil courtesy that they could do me; so the business ceased for a
while, and afterward Sir Hugh being come from York to his Mother in Laws house
which is in Lancashire, he sent over this Dod about some occasion or other to
his house into Cheshire, where Maddocks and he contrived to make a difference
betwixt Sir Hugh Caulveley and my self, and at Dods return back to Sir Hugh
into Lancashire, he happened to frame his story so well for his own advantage
and my prejudice, that I having some hampers of clothes at Sir Hughs house; I
was desired to send for them home, and this Maddock, had order to turn away
the maids with this expression, that Sir Hugh scorned to keep Maids, that
should keep open house, and a Bawdy house for me. This was the first palpable
business wherein I discovered both their hatreds to me, though having given
occasion thereof to neither of them, more, then that I did persuade Sir Hugh
Caulveley once to turn away Dod (which I believe he heard of) and not out of
any other malice to him, more then that he was a Papist, and that I was loath
that Sir Hugh Caulveley (being my friend as I thought then) should suffer for
entertaining so notorious a Papist, as he was known to be. It being reported by
some that he was a Priest.

This was the only exceptions Dod could take against me, until I found out
his roguery of endeavoring to set a difference betwixt Sir Hugh and my self,
having no just ground for to do it, more then what his spleen and malice could
invent, and indeed finding Dod and Maddocks wholly bent to make a difference
betwixt us; I must confess I endeavored what I could to cross their
intentions, and to preserve that friendship which formerly had been betwixt Sir
Hugh Caulveley, and my self, and to that intent, I hearing that Sir Hugh was
come out of Lancashire to his Sisters house called Line in Cheshire, I went
purposely to wait on him with an intent to inform him of the truth of the
business: and coming to salute him, I perceived him something cooler in his
expressions of kindness unto me then formerly he had been: whereupon I told
him, Sir I understand that Dod and Maddocks have abused us both, by informing
you of a thing that is as false (as God is true.) Therefore I shall desire you
to send for Maddocks, for I hear that he is in this house, and I shall prove
him a Rogue to his face, Maddocks was instantly called up into a Gallery, and
in the presence of Sir Hugh Caulveley, his Lady, and his sister, Mistress Lee; I
told Maddocks, that I wondered extremely at his baseness, having nothing to do^
but to invent lies, for to set friends together by the ears: he denied that
he had done it, although I knew the contr^y, whereupon I told him, I warrant
you will deny, that you say when you are drunk, that you care not six pence
for your Master Sir Hugh Caulveleyes service, and that you never got anything
by him; Maddocks did not only deny it, but withal replied that what I said
was false* I made him no answer, but with my Cane I laid him over the Coxcombe,
and so parted with him at that time; and presently I went out of Mistress Lees
house to a Lodging that I had within a mile and a half of that place, and the
next day I went toward my own house near Chester; but by the way as I went
home, I called at a Town called Sayton, where most, if not all the Inhabitants
of that town are Sir Hugh Caulveleys tennants. I sent for diverse of them which
I had formerly seen in Maddoks his company, and I asking them whether they
never heard Maddoks rail at his Master Sir Hugh Caulveley, they made answer,
he is never drunk but he does so, and then men most commonly speak truth, and I
wonder said they that Sir Hugh will keep him, for Maddocks constantly says he
cares not six pence for his service, and that he never got anything under him.
I made answer to them, honest friends will you justify this under your hands,
yes said they, and upon our oaths too, whereupon I drew a note to that effect,
and gave it them to subscribe, which they did willingly: and as soon as I got
the note signed, I presently sent it to Sir Hugh, and writ to him to this
effect.

SIr, Although you would not seem to give credit to what I said of Maddocks,
yet I hope, that since his neighbors do justify him to be a lying Knave, you
will do your self and me so much right as to turn him out of your service,
and in doing so, you will engage me to continue,

Your obliged Friend and faithful Servant, JOHN GRIFFITH.


Sir Hugh Caulveley sent me this answer, or much to this purpose.

SIR, I wonder you will trouble your self about my Servants, it is to no
purpose; for I will keep what Servants I please in spite of your teeth.

HUGH CAULVELEY.


THis answer I took to be as it was, that is, too uncivil to send to any
Gentleman, having never deserved it at his hands: whereupon I sent for a noble
friend of mine, Colonel John Booth, and after that I had acquainted him with
the business, I desired him to go to Sir Hugh Caulveley, and to tell him that
his letter was so uncivil, that I could not choose but resent it, and that I
did desire the performance of one of these two things, that was either to turn
away those two Rogues Dod and Maddocks or to fight with me; Sir Hugh sent me
this answer by my Friend, that is, that he would not fight with me; nor could
he possibly part with these men, unless he were undone; for his excuse was,
that none but them understood the managing of his estate: but gave me leave to
take what course I pleased with them; Dod going to London about Sir Hughs
occasions, I having notice of it, I writ to Mr. Briscow Clark of New gate, and
acquainted him both of his being in town, and what a notorious Papist he was
(if not a Priest) and that he had (during this war) been constantly in arms
against the Parliament. Upon this information Mr. Briscow, caused him to be
apprehended in London, and Mr. Briscow being out of the way, he made an escape
by one means or other from the Pursuivants, and so got again into the
Country to his Master Sir Hugh Caulveley, who lived then at his house in
Cheshire, called Sayton, and within a day or two after the time Dod came down,
I was to run my Greyhound against a Greyhound bitch of one M. Duttons of
Hatton. The appointment was made a fortnight before, nor did I expect Dods
being in the Country until I came, a friday morning near Sayton, which was
the day and place that we had appointed to meet at: but coming within half a
mile of the town, I met a servant of my own, who coming back from the Poast
house at Chriselton with my letters, as he was passing through Sayton, (which
was the direct Road from Chriselton to my house) he met (as he said to me) with
one John Hoskins a retainer of Sir Hugh Caulveleys, and he whispers him in the
Ear, as if it had been a great secret, and desired him to tell me that I
should not by any means come into the town; for Dod was newly come from
London, and had brought with him a warrant from the General Sir Thomas Fairfax
for to disarme me, and that there was twenty or thirty men with muskets and
other arms for to cease upon me if that I came into Sayton, and my servant
swore to me that he saw above twenty lusty young fellows, whose faces he did
not know, and desired me not to go thither, unless I intended to be either
hurt or killed: but for all my man's discourse, and the message that was brought
me, I resolved (knowing my self free from any guilt) either to get into Sayton
or to perish, rather then that it should be said that I promised Gentlemen to
meet them, and afterward that I durst not come; so I took my horse and rid up
into the middle of the town, but no man durst offer to disarm me, or to meddle
with me: So I went presently a coursing, and most of those men that were sent
to disarme me, came along into the fields with me, and some of them told me
that Sir Hugh and Dod had sent for them that morning, and told them that they
had a warrant from the General, and desired their assistance: These honest men
desired to see it, and Sir Hugh and Dod having none of show them, they refused
to meddle with me at all, and I understanding the malicious plot which they
intended against me, I purposely to vex Sir Hugh and his Champion Dod, sent for
a fiddler, and during the time my fellow Coursers were drinking a cup of Ale, we
having run our Match: I and my Fiddler rid up to Sayton, and from one end of the
town to the other, I made the Fiddler play a tune called Roger of Caulveley:
This I did to show, that I did not fear to be disarmed by them, and they may
thank themselves for it, for if they had not first endeavored to mischief me,
I should not trouble my self to have vexed them. Nay Sir Hugh was so malicious
that no body in Sayton durst let me come into their houses, although there were
diverse Alehouses, for Sir Hugh Caulveley threatened either to turn them out of
their houses, or to set their houses a fire about their ears, if they did
suffer me to drink in any of them: Besides there was particular notice taken of
those men which went a Coursing with me, and those which were his tenants, he
checked them the next day to some purpose since that time I met with Major
Haughton, Sir Hugh Caulveleys Brother in-law, who told me that if I had stepped
then, (when the Fiddler was with me) but one yard or two out of the high way,
that they intended to have shot at me with a dozen musketeers out of Sir Hugh
Caulveleys house; you may guess by this what continual malice Sir Hugh and
his servant Dod had against me: when this plot failed them, Sir Hugh tries an
other way to mischief me as I was credibly informed, and as it appeared
afterward by Dods discourse, that was, he sent into Lancashire for his
brother-in-law one Major Houghton, and one Captain Houghton, two gallant
Gentlemen, thinking to have engaged them in a Quarrel against me: but he failed
in his design, for the Gentlemen were so noble and discreet, that they would
not quarrel with any man without just occasion, and especially with me that was
a thousand times readier to serve either of them, then to give them the least
just occasion of offense; when Dod saw that there was no likely hood of a
quarrel betwixt us, then he reported about the Country that he had brought me
a Challenge from Major Haughton, and that I durst not fight with him: but
refused to give him a meeting: and this was not sufficient, but Dod likewise
reported in all companies where he came, that I was a base cowardly fellow, and
that it was a shame for any Gentleman to keep me company: and one Captain
Waulthers standing by, did not only reprove him for talking so basely of me,
but had likewise beaten him, if the company that was by had not stopped betwixt
them: and I am confident Captain Waulthers will justify this to be true,
whenever he is called upon. Then let the World judge whether I had not reason
to recent it.

But I hearing that Major Gilbert Haughton was returning out of Cheshire into
Lancashire, I went purposely to a place one night being the 23 of January where
he and Captain Houghton, was to pass by the next day, with no other intent,
but to hinder mistakes from happening betwixt us; and to give him thanks for
former favors which I had received from him, and to assure him that I was then
as much his servant as ever I had been before, in despite of those that
thought to make us foes: so we met friends and parted very good friends, which
I believe was not pleasing news either to Dod or to S. Hugh Caulveley: and
after I parted from Major Houghton, the same evening I went through Sayton
(being the direct way to my house) where I stayed a while, and afterward
resolved to go homewards: my horses I gave to my Groom and my Footman to lead
as far as the Church, purposely to ease the Mare I rid upon, and my self, for
the lane was very durty and my Mare lame, being newly pricked in her fore-foot,
which made me willing to have her led to that place, and I with the other two
Gentlemen which were with me resolved to walk to that place, where I
appointed my servants to stay for me, the fields being very dry, and a pleasant
and a usual walk, so our horses being gone, we went the usual foot-way which
goes just by Sir Hugh Caulveleys gate, and no sooner were we come over the
style, but (contrary to my expectation,) I perceived Dod coming toward us,
who might easily have got out of the way if it had pleased him: but he came
vapouring with a great staff in his hand purposely (as I thought then) to
out-dare me: but since that time I heard that he had been to visit some
friends in the country, at a town called Hanley, some two miles from Sayton*
which was more then I knew at that instant, but seeing him so armed I drew my
sword thinking to get betwixt him and the gate, and so to have carried him away
with us, and to have sent him safe up to London, from whence he broke prison:
but we both being something near the gate, we strove for it, and it was my
fortune, the truth is, first to get under it, and Dod finding that there was no
going back, without danger of being carried away, made him as it seems resolve
to make his way, thinking his Masters house his securest place, and without
delaying any time, he up with his staff and laid at my head as hard as he
could drive; but I bore it off with much ado, although my sword was extremely
bent with the blow, as Peter Harris Sir Hugh Caulveleys groom can witness that
he saw my sword bent, although he saw not the stroke, for Dod struck at me
before Peter Harris or any other came in sight, and after I had received his
stroke, I struck at him again, and hit him either on the head or on the arm,
I know not well whether, but we closed and so fell down together, he holding
me by the (...) of the head, as I can prove by a friend of his, unto whom
(since that day) Dod made his brag^ how he then beat me, and plucked me by the
hair. I desired him then to loosen his hands out of my hair, but instead of
doing it, he cries out for help; there being diverse servants and workmen about
the house, and the Town close by, which were most of them Sir Hugh Caulveleys
Tennants. The servants and workmen instantly came to assist him, which the two
Gentlemen that were with me perceiving it, the one thinking to make him loose
his hold, shot a pistol at him, that was only charged with beaten Pepper; but
that would do no good, nor make him let go, and the other Gentleman finding
an absolute necessity of our getting away, he clapped a pocket pistol to Dods
Buttocks, that was only charged with hail-shot, not with any intent to kill
him, but only to frighten him, so as to make him loose his hands from my
hair, which Dod did as soon as he was shot, so I and my two friends hastened
away, (as it concerned us so to do) for the servants and workmen that were
about the house (as it I heard afterward, and as I did then suspect) came with
a fowling piece, and diverse others arms, for to assault us, if we had stayed
never so little longer; At my coming away I took up Dods staff, and carried it
away with me, and I left my own Cane and my hatband behind me: and before we
got to our horses, we could hear diverse cry, you Rogues, Rogues, come back if
you dare; and indeed we having no desire to be beaten, rid away, and resolved
to let them call us what they pleased: It was (upon my salvation) not my
intention to kill him, and the world may easily judge that I might as easily a
thrust him with my Rapier, as cut him; Dod having first assaulted me with his
staff, and if it had not been for my sword, he might have knock out my
brains, so violent a blow he made at me. Besides, if we had intended to kill
him, we should have charged our pistols rather with bullets, then with beaten
pepper, such small shot as would hardly kill a sparrow, and for the Gentleman
that did it, he never saw Dod before that time, nor if Dod were living, do I
believe could he know him again, if he should meet him: Therefore it could be
no intended malice in him, having never spoken to him, or seen him before, and
how a Jury can find this murder, I admire, for England is not a country to
hire Braves for to kill men, or if it were, does any body believe, that any
Gentleman would undertake so wicked an employment, that is both odious to God
and man? nay in Italy it self where Braves are used, what are they that do it?
only the scum and rascallity of the people, and I hope no English man has the
heart to think, that a Gentleman (upon any terms whatsoever,) would
undertake to murder a man without any occasion given him: And indeed it
grieves me to find that our English nation affords such a crew of perjured
villains, I must needs term them so, having no more color or ground for
their verdict, but what you see in this paper: I find the English proverb
verified, that is, Like master, like man; and indeed their Land lord, Sir Hugh
Caulveley is a most notorious one, as I can make it appear by diverse, which
have heard him (as well as my self,) swear to any thing almost, and perform
nothing; and I cannot but pity these ignorant tenants of his, who it seems
think themselves bound to swear any thing that their Land lord would have
them to do. And I have heard Sir Hugh Caulveley often say, that a man should
never be powerful in his country, unless he would keep knaves about him, to
swear for their ma^^ers advantage. And more he said to me, that he had diverse
which for Rockmyjock (as Sir Hugh Caulveley terms it,) which is money in his
English, that would swear almost any thing he would have them, and indeed I
believe that either his Rockmyjock, or promises, if not performances of leases,
were not spared for the obtaining of this Jury and Verdict. I and the Gentlemen
which were with me, were so far from thinking the wound mortal, that we
stayed in the country a week after this accident happened, nor did we think it
possible he could die of that hurt, or else we would have got our friends so to
look after the business, that Sir Hugh Calveley should not have packt (as he
did) a Jury of Devils, to accomplish his abundant malice against me; when James
Dunne, who is both a tenant and retainer to Sir Hugh Caulveley, came and told
me on Sunday at noon, being the 30 of January 1648. that the day before, being
Saturday, Dods father came to his house, and told Dunne that the Surgeons told
him that his son could hardly live till the next morning. But withal, Dods
Father told James Dunne, that his son had cleared Mr Griffith, and that it
was not he that had killed him, but that it was one Lieutenant Davis that did
it; but withal, he said that his son forgave us all. Then how can they make
it wilful murder, when Lieutenant Davis never saw him or spoke to him before
that time, nor ever had any difference with him. But put the case that
Lieutenant Davis had intended to kill him, do not you believe, that he (being
a Soldier) would have rather shot him into the head, body, or belly, the^ into
the buttocks, knowing certainly those parts to be more mortal places then the
Arse: Therefore let the world judge how malicious and blood-thirsty Jurers
those are, to give so unjust, and so unconscionable a Verdict as I hear they
have done; God forgive them for it, for they extremely stand in need of it.

When in the first place you may perceive by what I have here set down, how
that Dod and his Master Sir Hugh Caulveley endeavored several ways to
mischief me, if not to take away my life. Secondly, how that I did not turn
the point of my Rapier against Dod, as it was in my power, although I was first
assaulted by him, and last of all I beseech you consider that Dod acquitted me
of his death; upon which considerations and diverse others it is easy to
conclude how extremely I suffer by the partiallity of a simple Jury, consisting
of fearful Tennants, swayed by the influence of a Landlord to abandon their
honesty to my disadvantage: Thus much I thought fit to publish for my
Vindication, and for satisfaction not only of my friends, but of all other
people of honor and honesty, as I doubt not there are many that will peruse
this paper with an impartial eye, and will afford me a just if not a
favorable construction, which is all that I desire or crave at their hands.

JOHN GRIFFITH of Llyne.
March 12. 1648.
The Reasons of my going out of the Country, were these:
First, the sickness being at Chester, it was uncertain when the Assizes
would be, there being none a long time before, nor any speech, or likelihood of
any, when I came away.

Secondly, The Accident happening under Sir Hugh Caulveleys gate, and amongst
his own Tennants, I knowing him to be so malicious a villain, that I was sure
that he would (if it were possible) pack a Jury, and make it unbaylable, as I
hear he has done; which Verdict (if the Act had been done in any other place)
I am confident would not have given so, nor was it likely that any (but either
he or his Tenants) could have done so unjust a thing. Then let the world judge,
whether I had not reason to secure my self, until I could have a certain
time of trial, rather then to lie in prison (God knows how long) and so to be
subject to the malice of Sir Hugh Caulveley, who is a man, that has neither
Honor, Honesty, nor Conscience, as all they that know him can justify, as
well as my self.

Thirdly, Sir Hugh Caulveley having made his brags, that he would sell his
house (called Llee Hall) nay part with all his whole estate, rather then not to
be revenged of me. I beseech you therefore consider, whether I had not reason
to take care of my self and to keep out of prison, lest during my restaint,
he and my enemies at London (as I have diverse and powerful ones too) might
join together and so ruin me right or wrong; as they did almost once upon
less ground or color for it, and I know Sir Hugh Caulveley to be so arrant a
Devil, that he will leave no way untryed, rather then not to destroy me: for
he sent his servant to one Master Baule in the Country to desire him to join
with him, to petition the Parliament against me: and why should not I as well
suspect, that he will send up to London to those that are my adversaries there,
and so make a strong party against me? which reasons indeed made me shun his
malice for a while, until I could make it appear palpable unto the world, as
I hope this relation will do; which (upon my salvation) is every ^ittle of it
as true as it is possible for any thing to be related.

FINIS.
