By His Highness: A PROCLAMATION PROHIBITING HORSE-RACES FOR SIX MONTHS.
WHereas notwithstanding the many Eminent Testimonies the Lord in his
Providence has given against the Secret and Mischievous Plots, which have been
laid and contrived by persons disaffected to the Peace and Welfare of this
Commonwealth, in the timely Discovery of them, whereby the same have been
hitherto hindered from being brought to effect; Yet forasmuch as due Care ought
to be taken for preventing whatsoever may minister an Opportunity to give any
Disturbance to the Public Peace, His Highness the Lord Protector being
informed that several Horse-Races are appointed in diverse parts of this
Commonwealth, and considering how great a Concourse of People do usually
frequent such Meetings, and the evil Use made thereof by such ill-disposed
Persons as watch for opportunities to raise New Troubles; For the better
preventing of the Evils which may arise thereby to the People of this
Commonwealth, His Highness by the advice of His Council, Does hereby prohibit
and forbid all Horse-races, and all meetings of any persons whatsoever upon
pretense or color of any Horse-races* in any Place within England or Wales,
for the space of six Months, from the six and twentieth day of February, one
thousand six hundred fifty and four. And does hereby straightly charge and
command, That no Person or Persons whatsoever, during the space of the said six
Months, from the said six and twentieth day of February, do appoint any
Horse-race, or do assemble or meet together upon, or by color of any
appointment of any Horse-race, or be present at such Horserace, as they would
avoid being guilty of the Danger that may ensue thereupon, and as they tender
the Peace and Security of this Nation. And His Highness does likewise charge
and enjoin all Mayors, Sheriffs, Justices of the Peace, Bailiffs, Constables,
and all other Ministers of Justice, to use their utmost diligence and care,
That all meetings upon Pretense or color of any Horse-race or Horse-races,
during the time aforesaid, be prevented and hindered, as they will answer the
contrary at their perils. And all Officers and Soldiers of the Army, quartered
or lying in or near such Place and Places, are hereby authorized and required,
upon notice, to be aiding and assisting to the said Mayors, Sheriffs, Justices,
Bailiffs, Constables, and other Ministers of Justice herein.

Given at White Hall the 24. day of February 1654.
