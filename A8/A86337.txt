Thou shall fear GOD, and reverence my Sanctuary.

A SHARP REBUKE, OR A Rod for the Enemies of COMMON PRAYER, That wrote the Book
of unmasking of it with lies; I also prove it to be the pure Worship of God
taken out of his Word, his revealed will.

Thou shall fear God and reverence my Sanctuary.
Loving Christians,
THis last week being the beginning of September, there came forth a slanderous
Book and a lying false Book, called Common Prayer, a sinful Idolatrous worship
of God: I answer to those ungodly wicked men that would pluck up that pure and
unspotted worship of God the Common Prayer Book, and the Successors of the
Martyrs that gathered that Book out of the pure Word of God, like so many
Flowers out of that plenty of Gods revealed will, those wicked men in this
matter are the Devils chief friends, worse than lewd and debauched men: for
they are not able to come with such lying shows of godliness. Beloved
Brethren, did not those ungodly Governors that usurped authority, that took
away men's rights of lands goods and power, did not these men put down the pure
worship of God, the Common Prayer book, did they not destroy Gods Laws and ten
Commandments, did they not love the Preachers that led innocents out of the
right Way into a bloody War, did not those men love the Preacher that praid
sinful, corrupt prayers almost an hour long not agreeing to the pure word of
God, the Common Prayer Book never learned men such lessons, Common Prayers are
pure prayers taken out of the Word of God, they are no Popish Mass, nor
idolatrous, nor superstitious worship of God, as these lying men say, that writ
this Book which they call Common Prayer unmasked, but these men are ignorant
judges in this matter, or else they are proud and wrangle, and God has not
revealed his secrets unto them so much as unto meek and humble men: but I pray
God to keep my soul from their blind zeal, the Papists hate the Common Prayer,
and did put it down in Queen Mary's days, because they are pure and holy taken
out of the Word of God, and offered up in the name of Christ Jesus the only Son
of God, and has no Idolatry in them, there is nothing presented in them to the
Virgin Mary, nor to any Saint or Angel, they are such godly prayers as God
Almighty loves: Christ Jesus hears and receives them in the public
Churches, the prayers of his weak Lambs, and the prayers of his faithful sheep,
he being the chief Shepherd of their souls, and offers up their prayers to
the holy and blessed Trinity, and he sends down his blessing upon their
souls, and makes them grow in grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior
Jesus Christ, and he sends down his blessing upon their bodies, their goods,
and their lands, and blesses their increase, for Saint Paul says, The good
things we have are sanctified by Gods Word and prayer, the humble Confession,
the faithful Absolution, the Lords prayer, and the earnest cry of Lord have
mercy upon us, Christ have mercy upon us, Lord have mercy upon us, and the
standing up, and giving glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the holy
Ghost, the ground work of Christian faith, brings great comfort to humble,
repenting sinners, and quietness of soul, more sweeter to them than the
fatness of marrow, or the honey or honeycomb: I confess with the Author of
that hard-harted Book, that the invisible mighty God is a holy pure Spirit, and
must be worshipped in spirit and truth: but our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
took the body of man upon him and gave us an example of standing and kneeling:
and we hope by faith in Jesus Christ to have our bodies raised and glorified.
Then let not mortal men be such Clowns or Fools, but let us worship God with
our souls and bodies, so God commands you shall fear God and reverence his
Sanctuary, our bodies are comely creatures when they are clothed with the
clothing of this World, then how beautiful will they be when they be clothed
with righteousness and eternal salvation in Heaven. The Author of that
malicious Book, finds fault with the Cross in Baptism, and with ten pound a
year and less to some Readers, and he says God will not hear the prayers of
the Service Book, others like himself commend him, O evil and wicked judges you
have beams in your own eyes! and yet you will cast out the motes in your
brothers eyes: the prayers of the faithful Ministers of God in charity for the
people, are near to the prayers of Common Prayer, and prevail much with
blessings for the people, but you have corrupted your prayer with self-seeking,
and pray for the destruction of better men than your selves. The enemies of our
Common Prayer Book are known to be fierce judges, far from patience and long
suffering, and far from judging righteous judgment, you are against holy
Government and degrees of men in the Church of God, when you may know there is
degrees of Saints and Angles in Heaven, the enemies of Common Prayer in that
Book desire the Honorable men in authority to pluck up the Common Prayer
branch and root with the godly Governors of the Church! O ungodly desires of
these men they would turn the glory of God and the comfort of the Church of
England into the darkness of a Nation, or a City, or a few Towns which come
far short of the godly wisdom and government, and godly Common Prayers of the
Church of England. Why my reformed Brethren, did not the Church of God the Jews
use prayers in the Temple. Did not the godly generation of Seth in the
beginning of the World begin to call upon God? Why Adam and Abel offered
sacrifice before, therefore I think they meet together to call upon God. The
best of the Kings of Gods own Churches to the Jews, King David, King Solomon,
King Abiah, King Asa, King Jehoshaphat, King Hezechias, and King Josias, these
godly Kings, appointed Psalms of praise, and Psalms of prayer, and Psalms of
Thankfulness, and Psalms of prophecies to be read and sung in the Church of
God, besides the reading of Moses Law: and our Savior calls it the House of
Prayer, and yet the Scribes and Pharisees did teach there: and Saint Peter, and
Saint John went up to the Temple at the hour appointed for Prayer: at Prayer
the ninth hour, which is at three a clock in the afternoon with us. Why, sure
the Apostles did well in going, did Gods Church the Jews call upon the God of
Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and shall not we Christians call upon God in the
name of Christ Jesus our Lord and Savior, where he has commanded us to come
to him, We are weary and heavy laden with sins, Let us pray in the common
prayers of the Church, let us pray to God privately in our chambers, let us
pray to God upon all occasions according to his Word, his revealed Will, in the
purest times of Religion men did meet together to pray, the Apostles and the
godly women continued in prayer with one accord, and they met upon our Sunday,
and so the godly and best of Christians has met together, and prayed with one
accord. And now in these Reformed times it pleased God to raise up King Edward,
Queen Elizabeth, and King James, and King Charles the First, which with help of
the godly Bishops and Martyrs of Jesus Christ have translated the Scriptures
into our own language, they have gathered out of Gods revealed Will, such good
Common Prayers as the whole World cannot mend them: therefore will I (by the
help of God) thank God with heart and soul upon the knees of my body for the
mercy of God in the bringing of our gracious Sovereign Lord King Charles the
Second, which has brought much quietness to these Lands, and suffers the
Common Prayer to be restored to us again: And although I am but weak in
knowledge and not worthy to petition, yet I humbly entreat our gracious
Sovereign Lord King Charles, and all his noble privy Counselors, Lords,
Knights, and Burgesses of Parliament, Justices, Aldermen, and Ministers, to
encourage the pure worship of God, the Common Prayer, and God grant that we may
pray heartily and reverently in Church, and send his people to pray at home
Evening and Morning, and seeing the Lord has been merciful to us, God grant we
may be a good example to other Nations: this is my petition to God and man, and
so I end this small writing being sixty six years old, hoping that some abler
pen will write some larger Book of this matter.

FINIS.
