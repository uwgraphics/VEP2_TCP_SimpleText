Cupids Cabinet Unlock't, OR, THE NEW ACCADEMY OF COMPLEMENTS, Odes, Epigrams,
Songs, and Sonnets, Poesies, Presentations, Congratulations, Ejaculations,
Rhapsodies, etc.

With other various fancies.

Created partly for the delight, but chiefly for the use of all Ladies,
Gentlemen, and Strangers, who affect to speak Elegantly, or write Queintly

By W. Shakespeare.

A SONNET. Inviting to some pleasant walk.
1.
COme away blessed Souls, no more
Feed your eyes with what is poor,
It Is enough that you have blessed
What was rude, what was undrest,
And created with your eyes
Out of Chaos Paradise.
2.
These Trees, no golden Apples give,
Here Is no Adam, here is no Eve,
Not a Serpent dares appear
While you please to tarry here.
Oh! then sit, and take your due,
Those the first fruits are that grew
In this Eden, and are thrown
On this Altar as your own.
AN EPIGRAM.
A Wonderful scarcity will shortly ensue
Of Butchers, of Bakers, and all such as brue.
Of Tanners, of Tailors, of Smiths, and the rest
Of all occupations, that can be expressed,
In the year of our Lord, seven hundred and ten
I think, for all these will be Gentlemen.
A CHARM, To expel Melancholy.
HEnce loathed Melancholy
Of Cerberus, and blackest midnight born
Amongst horrid shapes, and shriecks, and sights unholy,
In the Stygian Cave forlorn
Find out some uncouth cell,
Where the night Raven sings
And brooding darkness spreads his jealous wings
There, (ragg^d as thy locks)
Under those Ebon shades, and low brow'd Rocks
In dark Cimmerian shades for ever dwell.
The Soldiers Song.
COme let the state stay,
and drink away,
There is no business above it,
It warms the cold brain,
Makes us speak in high strain,
He Is a fool that does not approve it.
The Macedon youth
Left behind this truth,
That nothing is done, with much thinking:
He drunk, and he fought
Till he had what he sought;
The world was his own by good drinking.
AN EPIGRAM.
CAriola has a spot upon her face,
Mixed with sweet beauty, adding to her grace,
By what sweet influence, it was begot
I know not, but it is a spotless spot.
De eadem.
As with fresh meat, mixture of Salt is meet,
And Vinegar does relish well the sweet,
So in fair faces moulds sometime arise,
Which serve to stay the surfeit of our eyes.
A Song.
Over the smooth enameled green,
Where no print of step has been,
Follow me as I sing,
And touch the warbled string.
Under the shady roof
Of branching Elm, starre-proof,
Follow me
I Will bring you where A feigned name given by the Author to his Mistress.
Clarissa sits
Clad in splendour as befits
Her Diety.
Such a Rural Queen
All Arcadia has not seen.
AN EPIGRAM.
WIse is that fool, that has his Coffers full,
And riches freed, adorn the veriest gull,
(...) He has, he has the red sinn', and the yellow.
Five LYRICK PIECES, Dedicated, by the Author, to the truly fair, and noble
Mistress, E. C.
1.
I Can no longer (sweet) forbear
Since, now, your cation is my fear,
And the wrinkles, on your brow
(More white then Pelops shoulder) plow
Large furrows, on my panting heart;
Cupids sledge, not Cupids Dart
Has bruiz'd, not pierced it; why should I
Alone, in silence pine, and die?
And not as others, find a vent?
Winds earthquakes cause, when they are pent
In hollow Grots, but gently sail
With a smooth, and easy gale,
When their Patents signed to blow,
When, and where they list to go.
2.
Shall I impeach my self, and say,
I have deserved this dire delay,
And that your frowns I merit more
Then all your favors heretofore.
Shall I divulge the truth, and tell
I am (in Love) an infidel?
Nature in giving form to thee,
Exhausted all her treasury,
He then that does not idolize
Her Master piece, and sacrifice
Devoutly to it, needs must be
A wretch, profane, and I am he.
My error's found, and now command
My penance, what comes from your hand,
I shall with a religious awe,
Accept, and make your will my Law.
Pronounce it Lady, let your threat
Be, as my quondam crime was, great.
3.
Now purged by blessed, and holy fire
Let me, triumphant, strike my Lyre,
And sing her praises, who does deigne
To be my Goddess once again,
And let my piercing numbers move,
As Orpheus er'st, the shady grove
Of Ossa, and allure each stone,
As once the Harp of Amphion,
Like him of Sulmo, let me sing
And gently strike Catullus string,
Or give me Flaccus heavenly note,
That I may like some Cherub vote,
Hark Goddess, thus does Clio sing
Ecchoed from Parnassus spring.
4.
What th'antick Bards fabled of old,
In thee a real truth will hold,
Hyperion shines, more often then
He would, upon the race of men,
To gaze on thy bright beauty; thee
He has designed his Laurel Tree,
And Jove with horn's would crown his scull
Once more, save that thou hat'st a Bull:
Bacchus has often fed thy taste
As (she, so many ages past)
Fair hair'd Erigone, and swears
Thou art the sweetest of thy years,
Saturnus sister, Pallas, she
That took conception of the Sea,
Striving for Ates gift, had lost
That which, Dardania, dearly cost,
Had thou thy self to Paris shown,
The Apple [sure,] had been thy own
Divinest beauty, fairer fair
Then she Thyoneus made a star.
Men say three Graces, but thy worth
Does canonize thee for a fourth;
So sweet thy look, so grave thy gate
Such luster (never, yet pointed at
By Petrarchs pen) does richly flow,
Only an Angels pen can show
Its perfect essence, how can I
Give thy excentrick entity.
5.
Come then (my dearest, let us combine)
As the strong Oak, and creeping Vine,
And mix in an alternate war,
[A happy ill, a peaceful jarre]
While we in bickering do consent
Our skirmige shall be incruent,
And when we are married, we will compare
Our mouths, and thence fetch fresher air.
Throw by thy vestments then, and show
My eyes, a walking hill of snow.
Oh, how my ravished sense does glory
To sleep on such a promontory,
Now while our pleasant toil we ply,
Hark, how the spears in harmony
Do meet, Neptune forgets to roar,
The Sirens sport upon the shore.
Nature her self does smile, and all
Creatures (save those irrational)
In imitation of our loves
Practice the Complement of Doves
This pleasant juncture (from on hie)
Another age does typifie,
Which shall be truly styled of Gold,
When Love shall not be bought, or sold.
A Letter.
Dearest Lady,
SInce it is my fate to be thy slave,
Render such pity thou would crave,
If 'twere thy fortune so to be
To him, that Courts his destiny,
My moans sufficient were to melt
A flinty heart, who Love never felt,
Yet all those tears do prove in vain,
To quench my scorching Lovesick pain,
'Twas those Magnetic eyes that drew
My heart from me at the first view,
If then to Love, thou were it the womb
That gave it life, be not the Tomb.
If thou be pleased, exile delay
Dangers attend a tedious way,
Few are the words, that may combine
Our hearts, it is only say, thou art mine,
But if another has possessed
Those joys, that should have made me blessed,
Be speedy in thy doom, and I
By death am freed from misery.
Yours, and not his own K. D.

SONG In parts.
GALFREDO, LUCINDA. GALFREDO. Did thou not once, Lucinda, vow,
For to love none but me.

LVCINDA. I, But my Mother tells me now,
I must love wealth, not thee.

GALFREDO. It Is not my fault, my flocks are lean,
Or that they are so few.

LVCINDA. Nor mine, I cannot love so mean,
So poor a thing as you.

GALFREDO. But I must love thee, now believe,
I Will seal it with a kiss.

LVCINDA. I Will give thee no more cause to grieve,
Than what thou find'st in this.

GALFREDO. Then witness all you powers above,
And by these holy bands.

LVCINDA. Let it appear, the truest Love
Comes not through wealth, or Lands.

The search. AN ODE.
1.
ECho, sweetest Nymph, that liv'st unseen,
Within thy airie cell,
By slow Meanders margent green,
And in the violet imbroider'd vale,
Where the Love-lorn Nightingale,
Nightly to thee her ravishment does tell.
2.
Can thou not tell me of a gentle pair
That likest thy Narcissus are,
Oh, if thou have
Hid them in some flowery cave,
Tell me but where,
Sweet Queen of parley, daughter of the sphere.
So may thou be translated to the skies,
And give resound to heavenly harmonies.
AN EPIGRAM.
ULysses, having escaped the Ocean stood,
Twice ten years pilgrimage in foreign Lands,
And the sweet songs of Sirens, tuned to blood,
And Cyclops jaws, and Circes charming hands
Comes home, and, seeming safe, as he mistakes
He steps awry, and falls into a Iakes.
A SONG.
1.
POx take you Mistress, I Will be gone,
I have a friend to wait upon,
Think you I Will my self confine
To your humors, Lady mine,
No your lowering seems to say,
It Is a rayny drinking day:
To the Tavern lie away.
2.
There have I a Mistress got
Cloistered in a pottle pot
Brisk, and sprightly, as your eyes,
When those richer glances flies,
Plump, and; bounding lovely fair,
Bucksome, lively, debonaire,
And she is called, sack my dear.
3.
Sack's my better Mistress far,
Sack's my only beauties star.
She with no disdain will blast me,
Yet upon the bed she will cast me,
And the truth of her to say,
Spirits in me she will convey,
More then thou can take away.
4.
Yet, if thou will it take the pain
To be good, but once again,
Do but smile, and call me back,
And thou shall be that Lady, Sack,
Faith, but try, and thou shall see
What a loving Soul I Will be,
While I Am drunk, with naught but thee.
MAY MORNING.
NOw the bright morning star, days harbinger,
Comes dancing from the East, and leads with her
The flowery May, who from her green lap throws
The yellow Cowslip, and the pale Primrose.
Hail bounteous May, that do inspire
Mirth, and youth, and warm desire,
Woods, and Groves, are of thy dressing,
Hill, and Dale, does boast thy blessing.
Thus we salute thee, with our early song,
And singing welcome thee, and wish thee long.
A Letter.
SWeetest, thy name to me does promise much,
Oh, that thy nature also were but such
But whence (alas) the difference does grow,
Is hid from me, nor can I come to know
Unto thy excellent, and sovereign beauty
I Am bound, in all the bonds of love, and duty,
I that till now, could never learn to know,
Whether that Love were seated high, or low.
I, that as yet, did never know loves law,
Nor ere was loving longer then I saw,
I that have never known (what now is common)
Or to throw handsome sheeps eyes at a woman,
I that as yet, have never broke my sleep,
Nor ever did surmise, what charms did keep
Lovers eyes open, now too well can tell
Those things, that (sure) would please a Lover well.
Shall I relate it to thee? yes I will,
And being told, do thou, or save, or kill,
It would be his chief glory, if he might
Be ever resident in's Mistrisse sight,
'Twould please him greatly (sure) to have the hap
For to repose himself, in's Mistress lap,
Or else to have his Mistress, (kind, and fair)
With her white hand, to stroke his Amber hair,
Or else to play at foot-st, a while with him,
Or else to play at Barly-break, to breath him,
Or with him for to walk, a turn, or two,
Or else him for to kiss, to call, or woe,
Or entering into some retired Grove,
Beneath some pleasant shade, to talk of love,
Or when he is sure, there are no jealous spies
To clip her, and look Babies in her eyes,
Or when that action does begin to fail
For to supply it, with a pleasing tale;
How Venus was, unto lame Vulcan wed,
And yet how Mars, got into Vulcans bed.
And while that he, and she, did make but one,
Poor Vulcan, was constrained to lie alone,
Or if this cannot joy enough afford,
It will be well, for to observe each bird,
How choicely she does single out her mate,
And unto none, but him her self does take,
To mark their sportive billing, each with other,
Their Love, and dalliance pronounced the other,
Or if this chance for to yield no content,
Then to resort, unto each pleasant plant,
Which, by the Artist grafted skilfully,
Does bring forth fruit, the more abundantly,
But to conclude, 't would please him best (with me)
Himself, and Mistress, in one bed to see.
Lady, the humblest, and faithfullest of your servants R. H.

PRESENTATIONS Of Gifts, Or Love tokens.
The presentation of a pair of Gloves.
HOw happy are these skin's, that license have
To kiss those hands, and fold those fingers brave,
Which to salute, even love himself desires,
Longing with such warm snow, to cool his fires,
These are too trivial ornaments, to shroud
Those hands, ore which a bright refulgent cloud
Thrown, from the clear reflection of your eyes,
(The which the Sun, and Moon, do equallize)
Ever adorns, and obvious to the view
To Juno's anger, and Minerva's too.
Vouchsafe (dear Saint) what time you draw on these,
To think upon the dire perplexities
Your votary endures, and now at last
As these do clip your hands, let him your waste.
The presentation of a pair of Knives.
THese (dearest Mistress) like your beauty are,
They Are bright, and sharp, and cut most singular.
As does your beauty, so they will clearly shave
Any poor heart, that is destined for your slave,
When these you draw, think on those cutting woes,
Those pangs, those dolours, those vexatious throes
My mind endures for your neglect, and say,
Thou Art welcome now, for thou have cut thy way.
The presentation of a pair of Bracelets.
HAd it been possible, in power of Art,
Tears (the salt issue of a grieved heart)
So to cement, and harden that with ease,
They kindly might associate, as do these;
Mistress I could have spared, at cheap rate
Enough, for to have bought an Indians fate;
So often have the Lymbecks, of my eyes
Condol'd, in briny drops, your cruelties
These, for your use, were plundered from the Sea,
Where they were guarded by Lucothoe,
She to Ulysses, proved most kind, and I
Hope some hid virtue in these stones does lie
Infused by her, Oh, now no longer check
My hopes, as these about your snowy neck
Have place, so be you pleased at length (dear Saint)
My Arms with the same office to acquaint.
A persuasion to Love.
THe deeper (Mistress) that your Love is set,
The more form, and impression it will get;
And bring forth riper fruits, then such as grow,
And foolishly are planted, scarce so low.
If you please to command me, what I seem
By this stamp't word Impression, for to mean?
I Will tell you (Lady) only such as these
Impressions have, and still can women please.
Coin, only for its stamps sake we allow,
And that same evidence is weak you know
And faulty (sure) that has no seal to show
Stamp, or Impression, and even such I ken
Are all your Sex, until they are stamped by men,
Weak, weak you are, heaven knows, for why? you take
Your chief perfections from the man you make,
Then Lady, if you have desire to be
Perfect, you needs must have recourse to me,
Or to some other, that will freely give
The same our father Adam gave to Eve.
Alas, it is nothing, pray you (Mistress) take it,
There Is many wish it, that seem to forsake it,
And when the shameful dance is past and done,
They much do wish, they had the same begun
A score of year's, before at first they learned it,
And now with any cost, they will gladly earn it.
The presentation of a Muffe.
THis is no Skins of the greatest price, and only worn by Kings,
ERMINS skin, though I
Could wish no worse obscurity,
Clouded your radiant hands, but this*
Next unto that the costliest is,
Such as the noblest Russian Dame
On gaudy days, is proud to claim.
Sol now, in other parts does reign
Boetes (in his frozen wain)
His Viceroy is, Hyems does find
Conjunction with the bleak North wind,
By aid of this (dear Saint) you may
Deride the fury of the day,
When you shall deigne this furre to wear,
Oh! think what mighty power you bear
Over my senses, sometimes chill,
And sometime warm, as fear does fill
My heart, or joy ravish my mind
In hope, you yet may prove more kind.
AN ODE CONGRATVLATORY.
BLessed be this pair
On the earth, in the air.
Blessed in their lasting joys,
Blessed in their Girls, and boys,
Let them live to hear it told
Their great Grandchildren are grown old,
Let her beauty ever last,
And her vigor never waste,
Let the Sea, that bounds these Isles
Ebb, at least ten thousand miles,
And return no more, but leave
New Kingdoms for them to bequeath,
Let their bodies not be sound,
Dwelling in the sluttish ground.
But translated to those Thrones
Only built for blessed ones.
AN EPIGRAM.
SIllius has brought from strange, and foreign Lands,
A black, and Sootia wench, with many hands,
The which (say some) in golden Letters say,
She is his dearest wife, not stolen away,
He might have saved (heaven knows) with small discretion
The Paper, and the Ink, and his confession;
For none, that does behold her face, and making
Will judge she ere was stolen, but by mistaking.
SONNET.
ADieu sweet Delia, for I must depart,
And leave thy sight, and with thy sight all joy
Convoyed with care, attend'd with annoy,
A vagabonding wretch from part to part.
Only dear Delia, grant me so much grace,
As to vouchsafe this heart, distraught with sorrow,
To attend upon thy shadow, even, and morrow,
Whose wonted pleasure was to view thy face.
And if sometimes, thou pensive do remain,
And for thy dearest dear, a sigh let'st slide,
This poor attendant sitting by thy side,
Shall be thy Echo, to reply again.
Then farewell Delia, for I must away,
But to attend thee, my poor heart shall stay.
A TALE.
A Man there was, who lived a merry life,
Till in the end, he took him to a wife,
One that no image was (for she could speak)
And now and then her husbands costrel break,
So fierce she was, and furious as in sum,
She was an arrant Devil of her tongue.
This drove the poor man to a discontent,
And often, and many times did he repent,
That e're he changed his former quiet state,
But alas, repentance the^ did come too late,
No cure he finds, to heal this mallady,
But makes a virtue of necessity,
The common cure for care to every man,
A pot of nappy Ale, where he began
To fortify his brains, against all should come,
Amongst which, the clamor of his wives lowed tongue,
This habit grafted in him, grew so strong,
That when he was from Ale, an hour seemed long,
So well he liked the profession, on a time
Having staid long at pot (for rule nor line
Limits no drunkard) even from morn to night,
He hasted home apace, by the Moon light,
Where as he went, what fantasies were bred
I do not know, in his distempered head,
But a strange Ghost appeared (and forced him stay)
With which perplexed, he thus began to say,
Good spirit if thou be, I need no charm,
For well I know, thou will not do me harm,
Or if the Devil, sure, me thou should not hurt,
I wedd thy sister, I am plagued for it,
The spirit well approving what he said,
Dissolved to air, and quickly vanished.
A pleasant Song.
1.
WHen Autumn' disroabed the woods of their leaves,
And provident Ceres, had got in her sheaves,
When Acorns were fallen,
And Shrubs were grown dead,
Then frosty old Hyems, with Flora would wed.
2.
A rotten old Rustic, with hobnailes in's shoes,
With cobled old Rethorick, a Virgin he woes;
Yea, virtue proves venial,
And beauty is sold,
And Mopsus get his Misa, with Plutho's gold.
3.
Since lovely Corinna, so peerless a Gem,
Must match with a block, and so saplesse a stem,
Let Daphne bewail it,
And Cynthia mourn.
And all the Nymphs mirth, into heaviness turn.
4.
Diana the loss of her Nymph does deplore,
And vows him Acteons bad fortune, and more,
A Bull Jove will make him,
And so he does vow,
His wife he will turn into IO the Cow.
5.
Like Venus to Vulcan, so chaste let her prove,
As constant and quiet, as Juno to Jove,
As kind as Zantippe.
To Socrates was.
So let this rude Coridon find his sweet Less.

A PROPHETIC ODE.
WHen men and women blushlesse grow
In filthiness, and act it so,
As if a stallion to be known,
A Princely quality were grown,
Or when your Ladies do appear,
(As if old heathenish Rome were here)
By Coachfulls, with a brazen face,
To see men run a naked race,
And when sin to a rankness springs
Beyond the reach of libellings,
And libelling so common be,
That none shall from their dirt be free,
Though never so innocent (but those
Whom no man hates, envies, or knows)
Then look for that, which will ensue
Such impudence, if heaven be true.
Epithalamium, Or A Nuptial Song.
CRowned be thou Queen of love
By those glorious powers above,
Love, and beauty joined together,
May they col, and kiss each other,
And in midst of their delight,
Show the pleasure in the night,
For where acts of love resort
Longest nights, seem too too short.
May thou sleeping dream of that,
Which thou waking do partake,
That both sleep, and watching may,
Make the darkest night seem day.
In thy pleasures, may thy smile
Burnish, like the Camomile,
Which in verdure is increast
Most, when it is most deprest.
Virtues, as they do attend thee,
So may Sovereign thoughts defend thee.
Acting in thy love with him,
Wedlock actions are no sin,
Be he loyal ever thine,
He thy picture, thou his shrine,
Thou the metal, he the mint,
Thou the Wax, and he the print,
He the Lanthorn, thou the Lamp,
Thou the bulloyn, he the stamp,
He the image, leg, and limb,
Thou the mold to cast him in,
He the Plummet, thou the Center,
Thou to shelter, he to enter.
