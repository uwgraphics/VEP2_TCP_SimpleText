The Apprehension and Confession OF John Randal that Committed the Late Horrid
Murder and Robbery In HOVLBOVRN.
WE gave you already as full an account as we could of that horrid Murder
committed at the house of Esquire Bluck, and though we were then in the Dark
altogether, who it might be that should be guilty of that bloody fact, yet
since the justice of Heaven, that rarely permits blood to go unrevenged even in
this world, has been pleased to make a full Discovery thereof, which we think
fit to publish begins as follows.

One John Randal that was formerly Butler to Esquire Bluck, and consequently
was well acquainted with all the rooms and places in the house, and kuevv that
when the Family used to go out of Town, they left only this poor honest woman
the widow Burton, the party murdered to look to the house, is found to be the
bloody actor of this lamentable Tragedy; he is a person of about thirty Years
of Age, and was turned away from the Esquires service, about half a Year
since, which time he was married, and since that (as he pretends) has been in
Holland, or some part of the l^vv Countries, but he had not been near his
Masters house from the time of his going away, till the Day before the Squire
went forth of Town.

So that it is probably thoug^t, knovving what time he used to go forth with
his Family, he had before resolved on the wicked design, and then came when
he might have an opportunity, for on Muuday the third instant he came to a
Neighbors house, and pointing to Esquire Blucks house, asked who Liv^d at
that House, to which the Shop-keeher knovving of him, and wondering he should
ask, told him his Master, to which he replied, he thought he had been gone,
but hovvever he then went to the House, and drank with this good old woman,
whom he since murdered, who made him stay Dinner, and it is likely told him
her Master was to go out of Town, the next Day he came again and Drank wi^h
her, and on Wedn^sday brought 3 Razors to be set at the Razorshop next Door,
which he left, and was seen to go into this House, where (as since ^^pears
he did this horrid murder, and so went away with a considerable quantity of
Plate undiscovered, nor was there any likelihood of finding him out: but behold
on Friday the seventh instant about eight or Nine a Clock in the Evening, he
came to this shop for his Razars, when a Gentlewoman that has part of the Shop
having some mistrust of him, because he was the last she saw go into the House
before the Murder done, no sooner saw him again but she was violently
persuaded he was the murderer, and therefore running whilst he stood in the
shop to Squire Black, who was then at home, they got a Constable, and
apprehended him, and carried him before a Justice, where he first stoutly
denied the fact, but being asked where his lodging was, and ansuering such a
place in White-Cross-street, the same was ordered to be searched whilst he
was kept before the Justice, where in his Trunk they found plate of the
Squires to the value of forty pounds, which was brought and shevved him, and
then he confessed the fact, declaring that he sat with the poor Woman talking
till night, and that then she telling him it was late, and time for him to be
gone, he struck her with his Fist and Killed her, but denied that he had any
more Plate, or any money save four four-pence-half-pennies, and one Nine-pence,
vvhereupon he was committed to Newgate.

The aforesaid fifth of August, the Squire being out of Town with all his
Servants at his Countrey-house, at Hunsden in Hertford-shire, about twenty
miles from London, having given charge and trust of his house to this ancient
retainer to his Family of known Fedility, whose care and diligence was
manifested to the last, she having expressed both by the posture she was found
in; the Evening before this Horrid murder, she charged the Milk-Woman that
served the House, that she should call the next Morning, because she should
have occasion for some Milk, which accordingly she did; when coming to the Door
she found it open, not as it used to be, at which being amazed, she first
knocked at the Door for a considerable time, but neither seeing any person, nor
hearing any voice she went in, where to her greater astonishment she found the
body of the aforesaid Widow Brown lying in the Parlor with her feet over the
threshold, with a Coverlid thrown over her, which made the first discovery of
this Horrid Murder and Robbery, upon which coming forth strangely affrighted
with this sad spectacle, the Neighbors questioning the reason of her
affrightment, she relating the cause, immediately a Constable was sent for, who
came as speedily. At which time one of the Esquires Servants from the Country,
accidentally coming to fetch some necessaries he was sent for, who meeting the
Constable, and seeing such a Tumult at the Door was much astonished, but hearing
what was done, he with the Constable was a spectator, not only of that sad
spectacle of the Murder of the Housekeeper, but also went with the Constable
to observe what mischief was further acted, and upon search found all the Doors
and Locks broke open, as aforesaid: the loss is no way to be computed without
the estemate of the Esquire, who only knows that great loss he has sustained;
The jealousies concerning the actors as yet undiscovered. 'Ttis hoped, time
will produce, and Justice will reward these two great and crying sins rarely
remaining without discovery, and vengance following at the heels.

It Is strangely remarkable that this poor Creature should thus horribly lie
strangled black in the face, and cold when she was first found, with her thread
about her neck, wherewith she had been working: the bloody Actor not content
with binding or gaging, which might have been security sufficient for his
intended design of Robbery: but it is feared the apprehension of his after
discovery, prompted on that lamentable Butchery; the expedition of which Acts
gives a further suspicion, it being so sudden, even the very Day after the Esquire;
went out of Town, otherwise it is supposed his cruelty had not extended so far.

It Is further observable, that she never used to let in any into the house, but
such, whose voice she well knew; and the street-door, nor the look were not
broke although after he had broke the other locks, both of room, truncks, etc.
were all broke, and all the said place miserably ransakt, the richest movables
no doubt taken away, all except one plate-dressing-box, which was left on a
Cupboards head standing openly.

The Corronar and Jury found it murder.

Remember whatsoever has been done in the most secret Cell, shall at last be
discovered and proclaimed upon the housetop.

Oh that all these late sad examples, which several have so lately suffered the
hand of Divine and Humane Justice for, might take that good and everlasting
Rule, given to Israel upon this account, might take effect, which was that
Israel of old, was therefore spectators of the hand of Justice, that so they
might see Justice executed, and hear Sentence past, that they might hear and
fear, and do no more any such thing, which is the great design of the
publication of these Relations.

And considering all the cruel Circumstances of this most bloody Fact, and the
clear Evidence against this person both by the Plate taken in his Custody, and
his own Confession, there is small grounds or reason left to hope that he can
escape in this world, without satisfying for her Death with his own; though it
is to be wished that by sincere Repentance he may vvash his soul from the
stains of blood, and so escape the second Death and punishment everlasting.

FINIS.
