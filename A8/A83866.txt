Die Veneris, 5o Ianuar. 1643.
Committee for the Affairs of Ireland.
WHereas by Order of the House of Commons, and the Orders of this Committee,
there have been several meetings appointed to be had at Grocers-hall in London
for considering of and carrying on the affairs of Ireland, and that diverse
persons both of the Adventurers and of the select Committee chosen by the
Adventurers, have not appeared at those meetings as was required and expected,
by means whereof the service has not yet had that progress which was wished,
It is now thought fit and ordered by this Committee, that all the Committee
Adventurers chosen in London be personally desired, and the rest of the
Adventurers in and about the City of London be summoned by printed copies
hereof set up in several places of the City, to be present at Grocers hall on
Tuesday next being the ninth day of this instant January at two of the clock in
the afternoon, to give their advice and best assistance for the dispatch
o(...) the weighty affairs now in hand which very much concern the welfare
of that Kingdom.

Io. Goodwyn.
