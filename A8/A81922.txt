MADAM,
EVer since I had a resolution to make a change in my life by Marriage, I have
had thoughts of declaring my Reasons for it; partly, because I believed all
would not be satisfied with it; and partly, that all might see. I desire to
walk openly and in the light, which, I conceive, is every true Christians
duty; but hitherto I could not attain the fulfilling of my purpose through
continual distractions, yet now in some measure I hope to reach it.

Your Ladyship knows, we have a command in the Gospel, that all things should
be done to Edification; and according to this Rule, all that are faithful
subjects of Christ's Kingdom ought to order all their actions, to the end, that
all might be built up in the knowledge of their duty, by the prudent and Godly
example one of another, and none offended. And I may say truly, that by this
Rule I have aimed to walk, that God might be honored by all the undertakings
and circumstances of my life. But as justly can I say, that my heart accuses
me of a careless observance and pursuing this aim; and therefore, the justice
of God may suffer my best actions to be mistaken and so deprive me of the
comfort of seeing others informed or strengthened by my walk: Something of that
nature, (I mean misunderstanding) I find in the apprehensions of people
concerning my late Marriage; and therefore I do the more willingly take
occasion to lay down the Reason of my change from a single life (which
condition my inclinations preferred before the other incomparably) with great
desires, that if the Lord judge it their benefit, he would bless my discourse
with giving them a right understanding of those Principles, by which I see it
necessary that my actions should be governed.

Madam, you know the End of our being is Gods glory, and that the same, and no
less, should be the End of every action of a Christians life, and
consequently of Marriage: concerning which, that I may speak distinctly and
freely, I will tell what I apprehend it to be, and then what I conceive every
lively Member of Christ should aim at, in entering upon that state. For
Marriage, I take it to be a solemn and public Covenant between two,
instituted by God himself, from whose intention in his institution we must
discover the second thing, which is, what the Aim of a true Christian ought to
be, in making that Covenant with another.

The last and chief End of God in this institution (as I conceive) was that
which he proposed in the Creation and Governing of all things, viz. his own
Glory, which he wills to manifest, as well in this institution as in other
acts of his Providence, by declaring his goodness to his Creatures; which
Goodness is declared by ordaining a special way for them, to be a help one
to another for the advancing of his Kingdom in their own spirits, that they
may advance it in others, upon which follows their Eternal happiness, and
also by making them a comfort one to another in this life, by discerning
themselves a help one to another for that most excellent End of advancing his
Kingdom, and by that to glorify him in his Son. This is the comfort which I
believe, God intends true Christians by their Union in Marriage, that their joy
might arise from nothing below himself. And certainly, none such can have any
comfort but in doing the will of their Heavenly Father; and consequently, they
shall have comfort in whatsoever is a help to that, though it be accompanied
with never so many and great difficulties. Thus then, I say, we may gather
from Gods intention what our Aim should be in Marriage; namely, Gods Glory
(for upon that our eyes must be perpetually fixed as upon the maine ground of
all actions:) and secondly, as the Means to produce that effect, to be a help
one to another for the advancement of his Kingdom. This in general ought to
be the principal Aim of Christians in Marriage. (As for other things, which
though inferior, yet may have a consideration in making that Covenant, I pass
them over, well knowing few or none but considers them sufficiently) which I
have here expressed, that upon that ground I might lay down the particular
Reasons which induced me to Marry, and those briefly are these following.

First, I conceive, that ordinarily a woman cannot serve the advance of Christ's
Kingdom in a single estate, so well as being united to a godly Man for the
abovementioned Aims. For surely if she could, God would not have instituted
that which would prove an impediment to the best way of serving him.

Secondly, I saw evidently I could not. For Marriage was for that End (so often
already mentioned) proposed to me, and more then ordinary Means and
Opportunities of serving Christ were made apparent tome, suchas the declaring
of them would by such as understand not such undertakings be judged) vanity at
least in me, and therefore I mention no particu^ars, but rather say, that I had
long since bound my self to the service of the Members of Christ, and from all
selfe-seeking, as well by a particular vow, as by the sea^es of the Covenant
which con^rmes Gods mercy to us when we are found faithful in giving up our
selves to live and dye unto God, and not to our selves.

Lastly, I had seen a very great hand of providence leading me to Marriage,
manifested in many strange passages and circumstances, carrying me contrary to
all my own inclinations to what I would feign have resisted; and withal I
found, God denying me all the other ways that I proposed or sought out for the
fulfilling of that which I judged must be the End and labor of my whole life,
namely, a Living to the service of others without more respect unto my self
then what was required to make me fit for that. Thus, Madam, you see the ground
I went upon in this great change in the manner of my life; in my heart I wish,
it may be so understood, that some may see the necessity and benefit of
proposing Gods G^orie for the maine Aim of all the Actions and circumstances
of their Lives, that so they may be delighted with the knowledge of the
excellent Communion and Spiritual Workings between God and the Soul, which
the constant performance of this duty brings unto us even in this life, and
that is the worst I wish unto my censurers. Now, Madam, should I speak
something in answer to the Exceptions made against me, I fear prolixitie, and
yet I cannot well omit to tell you, they are not better then carnal, and such,
as to either Gracious or Moral Men will soon be answered. They are, I
perceive, two:

First, That I Married below my degree.

Secondly, That I matched neither to a great nor certain fortune: the last I
confess, the other I deny absolutely; and that I may give my Reason for what
I deny, I must consider:

First, our several conditions, relating the degrees of honor which God makes
between Man and Man; and then that which Man's judgment makes of honor. As
for the distinction of Equality or Inequality, which God makes between man
and man; I conceive, it is only made in his intention by the employment in his
own service which he calls men unto, that Man being invested in his esteem
with the highest degree of honor who is most trusted by him; and that Man is
most trusted by him who is most immediately in subordination to himself, set a
work for the effecting of the highest End, which he proposed to himself in
the Creation and Redemption of Man. Now, if this be granted a truth, as, I
think, it must be, it will easily appear, that a man, called, qualified, and
sent by God, as his Sons, Ambassador to dispense the Mysteries of Man's
salvation, that he, I say, receives the greatest trust from God, and
consequently the employment which gives him the highest degree of honor. This
was the Office our Lord Christ chose to execute personally, when he refused the
honor of governing an earthly Kingdom, and seeking rather that which came to
him by erecting his Kingdom in the consciences of men, where spiritually he
does indeed reign as King. By this which I have said, Madam, you see I judge
my self to have married most honorably, although I should confess him to be
no Gentleman which the world so much values; but he cannot be denied the honor
of being descended of both sides from an ancient Family, which even in carnal
eyes makes an Equality at least. For all that he is not come from the
Nobility immediately, and therefore wants the honor of that Titular
Greatness, whose Original at the best had its rise but from humane Policy,
and its suppott from the foolish Fancy of Men; certainly the honor of the
title of a Lord will not equal the honor which God has annexed to his own
Ambassadors, neither in respect of the Institutor, nor the End of the
Institution; the first being God himself, the End for his Glory, the other,
Man, and the End his Glory, between which methinks very weak Christians
should discern a very vast difference: Much might be said on this subject, and
much more to prove even to rational men, that there is no such Inequality as
some imagine, but it is not easy to fall so low in discourse with Christians
as to debate things in a bare humane way, seeing that is not Gods way, and it
is below our privilege in Christianity.

The Second ground of Censure, is, that I have not advantaged my self by
getting either a present great, or future certain fortune; It is very true, I
have not, nor do I think that the thing in Marriage that was called to aim
at (as I have said before) For I believe the inheritance of Gods Children is in
Heaven, where we look to have eternal possessions, not on earth, and
therefore not here we are commanded to lay up our Treasure, where we are sure
it shall not be permanent, whereas here we have no abiding place, nor
certainty of any thing in this life, which is not spiritual: And this Lesson
God calls loudly our Nation to learn at this very instant, and surely he has
given me great cause in particular to study to know the duty of living by
faith, which if we did understand, we should despise the reasonings of flesh,
and blood, and keep our selves in a joyful constant dependencie upon God for
unseene provisions, both for our selves and posterity; neither do we consider,
that God does govern all his dispensations and their circumstances in such a
way as all the wit of Man cannot make any alteration of additions or diminution
to them; which it we did, we might assure our selves, both the quantity and
certainty of the things of this life is in his hand to give, not in our power
to take; or if we had it, not to keep it. But alas, contrariwise, Men look
upon Estates, as things which we can make sure to our selves, and judge them
then only great, when there is enough to consume in the satisfying their
foolish fa^tacies by ^ulfilling all sinful appeti^es, and observing every
foolish superflous custom now taken up in practice, contrary to the
humility, moderation, and simplicity of the Gospel; but they that tend to
perfection must be otherwise minded, laboring to shake off those fetters that
they may be free to work in Christ's Kingdom, and able to joy only in the
increase of that and his power ^n it. Here, Madam you may see, worldly Riches
were not my Aim, and therefore I have them not, and yet I have enough to keep
me and my children from seeking necessary ^ood by this Match, to the
distraction of which I might have been all my life exposed unto for ought I
know, if God had not made Master N. instrumenta^l to prevent it: For such who
laid my condition to heart had t^eir own straits as well as I, and therefore I
could not depend upon that few number; so that in conclusion, I bless God for
his seasonable mercy to me, even in regard of outward provision. Let others
contemn it as much as they will; that shall not take me off from the gratitude
and value which is due for so great a mercy, as by eating bread of mine own,
in these miserable times I enjoy.

I might here tell you, that I could not pay too great a gratitude to Master N.
for his friendship to me and mine, keeping us from extremities, when else for
a long time we must have been exposed to it; but your Ladyship is no stranger
to that; and it is an argument (though considerable) for my Marriage of an
inferior nature then what I have related, and willingly I cannot love to
descend in such cases. And besides it is not my Aim to Apologize or satisfy
men to remove their censure from my self (for that I can easily bear) but to
inform those that are offended of my Principles. Therefore I will shut up this
discourse, with humbly begging your constant prayers, that I may be found
faithful in pursuing the Aim of my Covenant with Master N. that God may be
glorified in, and over all the actions of

5 May, New-stile, 1645. MADAM,Your Ladyships most constant, faithful, and
humble Servant,
