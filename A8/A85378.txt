A BREVIATE Of the Distressed Suffering Case of William Goodridge, Somerset, ss.
Mentioned in his APPEAL now depending before the HOUSE of LORDS.
JAmes Crossman, Vicar of Banwell, sued William Goodridge, by Bill in the
Exchequer for Small Tithes, caused him to be Imprisoned about Twelve or
Thirteen Years; and then on a new Bill exhibited against him in the said Court,
in the Year 1687, which, in regard of his tender Conscience toward God, he
could not answer upon Oath; The said Crossman taking advantage thereupon,
swears he believes his Tithes to be worth Six pound ten shillings per Annum
(which in Twelve years amounts to Seventy eight pounds,) when indeed worth but
about Forty shillings per Annum. And then the said Crossman procures an Order
of Court for the Sequestring the said Goodridge's Estate, and did Levy One
hundred and fifty pound Seven shillings and Six pence, of the said Goodridge's
Personal Estate, as by the Plantiffs own showing in an Order of Court, by him
obtained the Third of November. 1688. does appear. And by a Writ of Assistance
out of the said Court, the said Crossman also had Possession given him by the
Sheriff, of the said Goodridge's Real Estate of Sixty pound per Annum; and
seized Goods and Chattels of one Avery, the said Goodridge's Tenant, to the
value of Ninety four pound, and turned him out of Possession, and keeps the
said William Goodridge Prisoner, and has turned his Wife, a La^^e Woman, out
of Doors, and left them both in a ruinous Condition, as more at large does
appear in his Appeal Presented to the House of Lords: by whom, he Humbly hopes
to be Relieved.
