A LETTER Sent to George Wither, Poetica licentia Esquire, by a plain dealing
friend of his to prevent his future Pseudography. Printed By Benevol.
Typographus, sometimes Printer to the said Master Wither. Published For the
better information of such who by his perpetual scribbling have been screwed
into an opinion of his worth, and good affection to the public. And are to be
sold By the Cryers of new, new, new, and true news in all the streets of
London. 1646.
Old acquaintance.
FOR so give me leave to term you, having not been till of late, much
estranged from you since you lived in the Bishopric of Durham, when she lived
there also which now is your wife, but then wife to a poor man in London, who
by report perished for want of bread.

Having perused diverse of your scandalous Pamphlets, and Satyricall times which
I find most ridiculous, vaingloriously applauding your own valor, good
affection, and merit, and injuriously aspersing diverse noble Gentlemen of known
integrity and fidelity, nay abusing many famous and trusty worthy Members of
this ever to be honored Parliament, I thought fit to present you with these
lines, (if possible) to prevent your future Scribbling, and being stigmatized,
at least with the name of lying and Scandalizing, Bard.

It has been a maxim that whosoever chanted his own praises was was a fool,
though deserved, what then must he be that exalts himself so much (as you do)
without any merit? As for the unparaleld valor heroic Acts, and martial
achievements, you seem to challenge to your self, (in your book entitled
Campo Musa) all men that know you conceive your brains are infatuated with
hopes of being thereby made Governor of some Castle in the air, or else you
would have declared so much at Barmodus, or some place, where every man that
knew you did not know the contrary, but if you are so bewitched as to conceive
you have valor, or have done any thing in Arms worthy of a Laurel Crown, I
shall endeavor to liberate you from those char^^es by declaring truly how you
were admitted unto Arms and how you used them during your short continuance in
them.

You cannot but remember that when these unhappy distractions did first
commence, the King had diserted the Parliament, and the sword began to be
unsheathed, that you having no land of your own, lived a poor Tenant to
certain Lands at Wanborough in Surrey, when in my op^nion your Russet coat did
better suit your condition and quality then the Scarlet, Plush, and Velvet, you
are now by the fortune of the Wars leaped into.

At that time there being a Troop of Horse raised in that County for the
service of the Parliament, the truly worthy Gentlemen entrusted by the Parlia
with that county (whom I may truly call the preservers and deliverers of their
country) for had it not (...) for their perilous undertakings, and most
indefatigable endeavors, that County had been made long ere this the Subject
of the Enemies fury, and utterly ruined by plunder, fire and sword, as to their
eternal honor, all the honest inhabitants will acknowledge.

These Worthies I say esteeming by an outward appearance to have a good
affection to the Cause they so faithfully prosecuted, did (contrary to the
motion of many well affected, honest and Religious men who had more nearly
scrutinized your actions, and made discovery of your self ends) confer the
command of that Troop upon you.

Being thus mounted in Authority, the first martial employment you were put
upon, was to march into Kent, to secure the Malignants there from attempting
any thing in prejudice of the State, which service (to your eternal fame be it
spoken) you performed with such alacrity, that in short time you secured most
of their good Horses, by seizing them into your custody, and appropriating
them unto your self, so that your Farm at Wanborough was now well stocked with
brave horses, your Lady like Mistress had a galla^t white Palfray to mount her
self on and a stately gelding for her man in a Livery to attend her, now the
world began to mend with you in sight.

Your second Martial employment was to keep Farnham Castle that the Enemy
should not possess themselves thereof, where immediately you grew such a
Graduate in military affairs, that in your Pamphlet entitled Se defendendo,
you accuse those worthy Patriots before mentioned, that they neglected to
supply you with necessaries for the making of Baricadoes, Palisadoes, and other
defenses, but give me leave to digress a little and tell you a story of a sick
man that sent for a Physician, who coming to him, the sick man asked him what
his disease was, the Physician answered that it was Flatus Hypocondriacus that
tormented him, afterward some of the sick man's friends coming to visit him,
asked him what was the cause of his malady, the sick man not knowing his
disease told them he was very sick of a hard word; so you had borrowed some
hard words as Palisadoes and the rest, out of some history of War, for at
that time I am certain, you neither knew what they were nor the use of them,
nay such a novice were you in Arms that you scarce knew how to spanne a
Pistol, or being spanned to fire him.

It was not long after when the King marching toward London, with His Army,
you with your Troop were (...) Supreme Authority commanded to Kingston upon
Thames, and from thence the Kings Forces advancing as far as Brainford, you
were ordered to march by London to join with my Lord Generals Forces at
Turnham green, but hic dolor now were you to come near an Enemy. Oh what a hard
matter it was to get you out of London, but being come thither what ^n agony
were you in, some of your Soldiers supposed you were in the cold fit of a
Fever, others feared you were troubled with the passion of the heart: but the
Enemy retreating to the other side of the Thames, did something mitigate your
passion, and restore you to your almost lost senses.

The next news I heard of your Troop, was when Prince Rupert beat up their
quarters at Crowell near Chinnar and did some hurt thereto, although the
Soldiers made a reasonable good escape; yet the General Officers, demanding
where the Captain was, and why he was not more careful in keeping Scouts
abroad, his Soldiers were enforced to answer that they had not seen their
Captain a long time, for indeed you had at that time secured your person for
many months, sometimes in Surrey, and sometimes at the Queens Arms at Holborn
bridge.

The next and last of your warlick employments was to march with my Lord
General to the relief of Gloucester in which march were many remarkable
passages; first to see how like a magnanimous and undanted Ach^lles you marched
every day in the head of your Troop, until you approached something near the
Enemies quarters, but ah! then the old Tremor cordis, the old pannick fear
began to seize you, then every object that your d^m sight could reach was a
Cavalier, then would you often put your forefinger to your thumb, and looking
through perspective wife, could you discern a tree at any distance, you
apprehended it to be one of the Enemies Scouts, or if you discovered many
bushes together, you fancied them to be a Body of Horse, and would not advance
one foot, till having sent out diverse Scouts for discovery, they upon return
gave you assurance that they were not enemies then would you again begin to
march, and your Soldiers to laugh, and scoff at your cowardice. The Kings
forces rising from Gloucester and the place sufficiently relieved, both Armies
endeavoring to gain advantage to give the other battle, you being thus daily
alarmed with terror, and ambuscadoed wit frights, to prevent your own
engagement, tamely delivered up your Commission, yet durst not go from the
protection of the Army till you came nearer home; but by the way a skirmish
happening at Aburn Chase, you posled to a kinswomans house of yours not far
off, where by report you crept into a hogges-stye, and (the skirmish ended) to
prevent future frights, hastily conveyed your self to your Farm at Wanborough,
where two days after, you heard the great Guns play, which was at the fight at
Newbury, and (supposing it to be what indeed it was) told your wise that God
had exceedingly blessed you, that you were not there, for had you been, you
should have been killed in regard your eyesight was so bad you should not have
known a friend from a so, nor have been able to make an escape: and this is
the summary of your Martial Acts, and which I hope will be able to dispossess
you of that lying spirit which causes you to persuade the world that you have
valor: as for the drawing and brandishing your sword (you so often boast of)
for the preservation of the common liberties, and defense of the Parliaments I
conceive it a great happiness to the State that you never drew it (in earnest)
for had you so done, perchance the Sun beams might have reflected upon the
fair gloss thereof, (having not been much worn in the rain to make it rustie)
and caused such glances into your eyes being something purblind, that you would
have supposed it to have been lightning, and immediately written a book
thereof, and declared that the heavens did fight against you.

As for your good affection you so often reiterate, it has not appeared by
your warlike deportment, as the premises may truly satisfy you, nor by your
free contribution on the Propositions, for that was very small, and that only
to creep into the good opinion of those in Authroity, thereby to gain some
place of benefit, as indeed you obtained, but perchance you may object, that
your good affection may appear by the adverse parties plundering of you: this
your losses you know to be your great gain, although you are ashamed to
acknowledge it, which may seem a Paradox to others, who as yet cannot unfold
the riddle, but I can make it plainly appear, for your losses (although you
abused the Hnourable House of Commons by making them believe that they amounted
unto 2000 l.) did not extend to the value of 300 l. although you should
inventory horse-collers and hog-yokes, for you had sold most of your cattle,
bullocks, hogs, and sheeep, and received money for them, and lost very little
Corn, not above three or four load, and that in the straw, as appears by the
testimony of diverse of your honest neighbors given in by them to the
Honorable Committee for the County of Surrey sitting at Kingston, and for this
your small loss, (considering the great you pretended) you gained from the (by
you deceived) Parliament for reparation many great Sequestrations in Surrey,
viz. of the goods and estate of Judge Foster; Master Denham then high Sheriff,
Captain Andrews, Captain Hudson, Captain Brodnix: and many others, which
amounted to a very great sum, it is therefore evident, your gain far exceeded
your loss, besides you would have much added to your gain, at a place near
Egham in Surrey (I conceive by the new fashioned trick called plunder (for I
never heard of any authority you had for it) had you not been prevented by one
Master Ayling, who with eight or ten Musketeers seized your self, and some
of your Troop, and supposing you had by Legerdemain conveyed something into
your Boots, or sleeves of your velvet Jacket, enforced your self to pull off
both, and your Troopers would not assist you, seeing your pusilanimity in
subjecting your self to such base terms.

In what else your good affection has been expressed, is unknown to me, and I
believe to all men, only you might be conceived to be for the Parliament (did
you not daily abuse the Members thereof, because not againstit, if there be not
a neutralitie in you.

As for your abuses, injuries and Scandalls, I will be as brief as I may, and
yet I shall be troublesome unto you, Your injuries to particular and personated
men, and especially to Sir Rechard Oinslow, who upon strict examination was
found to be Justiciarius, ex merito justificatus, you Stultus, ex debito
condemnatus, have been already in part censured by the highest Court of
Justice, although your subornation, and conspiracy be not as yet punished, and
if your baseness be not therein made apparent to you, and your Judgment
rectified, I fear I shall in vain endeavor it.

Your aspersions laid upon the Committee of examinations, (taxing them with
injustice, and that they heard not causes with an equal ear) your own cause
might clear, and enforce you (had you but common reason) to acknowledge your
error and give your self the lie, for there was not one Article, that you were
accused for in your scandalous Pamphlet intiruled Justiciarius justificatus,
but you were asked what you could say thereto, and what witness you had
thereof, and the answer you could make to all and every question was, that you
had no witness, but that it seemed so to you to be: ought not this do you
think to be by them voted injurious, that had no other circumstantiall evidence
or proof then your shallow, and malicious surmise, and the contrary of every
scandal made apparent? Concerning the insufferable aspersions by you laid upon
diverse Members of both Houses of Parliament, by terming them rotten Members,
Rebels, Traitors, Hypocrites, Knaves, Liars, Swearers, Drunkards,
Whoremasters, with much other very opprobrious language vomited forth in your
Book entitled Opobalsomum Anglicanum, pressed out of a shrub, but it may be
more truly called Venenum Diabolicum, extracted from a malevolent brain, And
therein express, that diverse Members were chosen by indirect means, as by
employing friends, crouching to equals, scraping acquaintance with strangers,
feasting the Cobbler and Smith, all which your self did (only conceive you had
scarce a friend to employ) to gain you an election at Guildford in Surrey you
neglected not Letters in Print, wonderfully declaring your own abilities, and
disparaging others you feasted Tailors, Tapsters, and Hostlers, and upon the
day of Election, earnestly solicited George the Hostler, of the red Lion there
to put on his best clothes to go to the Guild Hall of the town, to give his
voice for you, whomaking a scruple thereof you despaird of your election, took
your horse and mmediatly rode out of town, as it was time to do for the Burgers
of that Corporation being very well affected to the public good, and dependent
upon reason, had unanimously resolved ( nemine contradicente) and accordingly
did elect a worthy Patriot of their country to be their Burgess, but your
hope is that no man being personated therein, you shall escape unpunished, but
I hope, as every Member ought to be immaculate, so to be jealous of their
integrity and to wipe off that dirt you have thrown in their faces, will
enforce you to declare, whom you intended thereby, that the guilty (if any) may
be found out, (or if none) that you who seemingly dip your finger in the dish
with them, yet would traitorously foment a division, may be brought to condign
punishment, and made exemplary to all knaves for the future.

The premises taken into serious consideration, and your excellent service
well weighed, the Parliament cannot but in justice reassume your Petition for
arreares, and order the same to be immediately paid, and grant your late
Petition for a place of 500 l. per annum.

But the contemplation of your deserts had almost made me forget a friendly
advice, which is that you would no more compa^ your self to an English
mastiffe, f^r a mastiffe has his ears cropped, a collar about his throat, his
tail bob'd, and is chained up, especially in the day time, it may be, let loose
in the night for the preservation of his Masters goods, and in stead thereof
worrieth some harmless, and innocent passenger, and so is hanged: I know I
have been tedious and troublesome to you, yet much more might be spoken in the
blazoning your self and actions in their true and proper colors, but, Ne me
Crispini scrinia Lippicompilasse, putet. I shall conclude with a wish that my
Letter may find its desired effect, that you henceforth surcease from vilifying
honest men, and deifying your self, which will be no small joy to

Your plain dealing friend Alethegraphus.

FINIS.
