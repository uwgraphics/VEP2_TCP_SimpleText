THE DECLARATION Of the Tovver Hamblets to the Lord Mayor, Aldermen and Common
Council of the City of LONDON
My Lord,
WE are not Ignorant that we are in a time werein it is far more safe to
suffer or fly then to speak of the state of things as they now stand without
offense, and that all we can speak at this present will either be suspected
by those, who have formerly endevour'd to make our actions Criminal, or by
that party, which so much ayms at their own private interests, that you will
imagine each word we speak, a Bullet-Shot to bring ruin to the Common Wealth.
Yet we must needs say it is a matter (to honest hearts) hard to be very silent
in so great revolutions of affairs, since Nature has not created us like
Crocodiles, that we have only eyes to weep, and no tongues to speak or
complain, for we perceive we loose all, we have of English in us. If we
all endeavor not your prevention of your General disasters, which at this
instant not only threa^en the ruin of this City, but the whole Kingdom in
General, for whereas we should and ought to strengthen our selves by uniting
all our power into one body against our common Enemy and their violence, we
find we have amongst us a people perverse to peace, a froward and crooked
generation, which act most lesuitically for rule and authority that they may
govern all by an arbitrary power, such we say as we apparently see seek the
Kingdoms goods, not good, such Birds of prey they are, that deceive all other
Birds, should assemble to pull their plumes off, which they have stolen from
others to make great or good their ambition, and such they are not as that
valiant Turr^il, borne in France that after 32 years service for the weal
public (his own secretary acknowledges) he dyed almost as poor as he was
borne, but it is true he had no other aim, but the glory of God and the service
of his Country. But let us look and observe the obstructors of our peace, and
we shall find them lik Salamanders which live in the fire of our misery and
affliction, such who have gotten great estates in these times of common
calamity and distraction, such as manibus pedibusque obnixe labor and endeavor
by all ways and means to bring to pass their own designs, whilst we suppose
the justice of cause will support us. And such they are as resolve for the
preservation thereof, to do any thing and rather hazard the ruin of all, then
suffer themselves hereafter to be called in question for unjust gotten goods*
Shall we say, sit still and be contented, to do as m^n in thunder, every on pray
the Thunderboult fall not on him or his House, and not regard or look after
our neighbors, we w^sh there be not some great ones here, whose Dignity ought
to put into their mouths, good and forcible words for the defense of this City
and Kingdom, which do satisfy themselves with hopes to avoid the present blow
and expect safety themselves in our common calamities. We therefore declare
that we resolve as one man to adventure our lives and fortuns, with the
Commanders and Common Counsel of this City in the preservation of the Kings
Person, the Parliament and City from al Riots, Mutinies or Tumults, which may
arise from any party during the treaty, and we desire you will endeavor that
by authority every Commander may in his division take the subscription of such
hands as will engage in that service, and in case the King and Parliament shall
not agree, to stand against none but those that stand against the fundamental
Laws, and Constitutions of this Land, and the good and freedom of this City
according to several Ordinances of Parliament, and so we (the City and parts
Adjacent) being joined in one body according to our former desires keeping
firm these our resolves, you, nor we shall have cause to fear the face of
all our enemies, but both be a terror to our enemies abroad, and an object of
honor to our friends at home. And lastly make those our servants, that now
endeavor to be our Masters.

LONDON Printed July 15, 1648.
