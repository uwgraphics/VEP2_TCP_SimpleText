The Necessitated Virgin.
See here the Virgin in distress,
Complains Young Men are pittiless;
And she full fain would comfort find,
To ease her fad perplexed mind.
Tune of, What shall I do, shall I dye for love, etc.





What shall I do in this deep distress,
is there no help to be had?
Young Men are grown so pittiless,
'twill make poor Maids run mad.
I am full fifteen Years of age,
my Fortune is so bad;
It puts me into such a Rage,
'twill make me run quite mad.
And had my Mothers fortune been like mine,
so grievous sad,
Then what a plight had she been in,
and like me, almost mad.
Had I a Sweetheart at this time,
some thundering whisking Lad;
To ease me now I Am in the Prime, v 'twould save my running mad.
But I am quite Unfortunate,
worse luck no Girl e're had;
Year after Year to pine and wait,
'twill surely make me mad.
Come Rich or Poor, come Old or Young,
and make my heart full glad;
For now my passion is so strong,
that I shall run stark mad.




TO see my Comrades Belly swell,
it makes my heart full sad,
And I I Am sure can kiss as well,
would this not make one mad.
Yea, some strange, old, and wrinkled things,
good fortune they have had;
Yea, taste from whence all comfort springs,
would this not make one mad?
And Doll the dirty Dairy-Maid,
met with a brisk young Lad;
At pleasant sport with her he played,
else she had run quite mad.
And greesie Sue, the Cook-wench too,
good fortune she has had;
And Jone has Sweet-hearts one or two,
this, this will make me mad.
I Am fair enough in my conceit,
my Portion's not so bad;
But if I cannot quickly have it,
i am sure I shall run mad.
When hand in hand I see a Girl
go mincing with her Lad;
Then from mine eye there drops a pearl,
and I am almost mad.
In Dreams sometimes my self I please,
and make my heart full glad;
I wake, see no such things as these,
this helps to make me mad.
Besides i am jeered by every one,
'cause I no Love have had;
Which makes me sigh, lament and groan,
and makes me worse than mad.
I am almost possessed with fears,
which makes me dull and sad;
That I shall lose my teaming years,
and then I shall run mad.
For in the world I think before
such ill luck none e're had;
Now my condition I deplore,
i am ready to run mad.
Some gentle Young Man come away,
and ease my heart so sad;
I hourly for a Husband pray,
for fear I should go mad.
But if I cannot find relief
with some young lusty Lad,
I Will play the whore, and not the thief,
and save my running mad.
FINIS.
