A New plot discovered, practiced by an assembly of Papists, upon Sunday being
the 25. day of July, for the deliverance of William Waller, alias Walker, alias
Ward, alias Slater, a Jesuit, which was hanged, drawn, and quartered, upon
Monday the 26 of July, revealed by John Hodgskins a Porter, by a Letter, 1641.

Printed, Anno 1641.

IT is unknown to very few in England, what plots by Papists have been hatched,
but by the assistance of our great God, never have taken effect, but have been
broken in the egg, and the setters of them utterly destroyed: to make
repetition of them at this present, I shall not need; Campian that eminent
Saint now canonized amongst the popish crew, whose learning, the best learned
men of England have admired, and had it been employed to a right use, would
have been registered amongst the works of those Scholars which have been
esteemed of greatest account, but it was too manifest approved that the
employment of it was to blind ignorant men, that the Devil with the more ease
might have led them to his Kingdom; but what was Campians reward, the Gallows?
for he was condemned for a Traitor, and was hanged, drawn, and quartered, in
the most happy Reign of Queen Elizabeth, of blessed memory. O what a damned
plot was there invented also, in the Reign of the most wise second Solomon,
King James; the powder plot I mean, which was intended for the destruction of
King, State, and Communalty, in the time of sitting at Parliament; but God,
Englands sole Defender, revealed it, and the Conspirators caught in their own
net, Faux going to give the fatal blow was apprehended, and he with the rest
of his hellish company paid that which their treachery did deserve. What the
Papists intents have been in these our times, may be judged, by their late
presumption and pride, which was feared to be maintained by some of the
Clergy, which should rather have bin piercing swords to wound them, then chief
actors in spurring them on: for when Shepherds go astray themselves, how shall
the flock live in safety? how shall the sheep feed upon the wholesome plains,
when the Sheepherd leads them into unknown Wildernesses? but this soar also,
by Gods assistance, and the Parliaments wisdom, of late has bin indifferent
well cured; but yet still do some scabbed sheep remain amongst the pure
flocks, two of them lately were separated from amongst them, those Jesuits, I
mean, which were lately apprehended, who for the ambition they had to be
canonized Martyrs, after their exile, notwithstanding the Kings command,
presumptuously returned back again, to follow their old practice, in which they
had spent so much study, seducing the Kings liege people: one of them is
already executed, the other now lies in Newgate: but the plot which was
intended to rescue that old Priest William Waler, is the Theme which I am to
treat on, which thus begins.

Upon Saturday, being the four and twentieth of July, was this Priest
condemned, which being divulged amongst his fellow Recusants, upon Sunday they
a great number gathered together to the sum of threescore, near Cursitors
Ally in Chancery Lane, a place, where the now dead Priest lodged, to find out
some way to deliver him out of the hands of his enemies, the bloody Heretics;
they long did hold counsel, one said he would go as to visit him in Newgate,
and change apparel with him, and so let him escape, and take his punishment
himself, for he said it was piety to redeem a Priest, though with the loss
of his own life, they all condiscended to his proposition, and after Mass
being sung, and a company of papisticall prayers said over him, they bid him
go and be resolute, not fearing the malice of Heretics, which could never be
able to do him any harm, in so much as he was innocent of those crimes which
the Priest was condemned for, and by so dying he should be quitted of
purgatory, and go presently to Heaven, and enjoy the presence of the blessed
Virgin Mary, which words being said, they gathered money amongst themselves and
gave it unto him, charging him to be charitable to his brother prisoners;
having received the money, away goes this fellow whose name was Ward, one of
Wallers by-names, by which sometimes he was called: this Ward being come nigh
Newgate, he began to question with himself, why he should run resolutely
unto death before he had deserved it, the Priest said he is fourscore years
of age, and I scarce forty, long he cannot live, as for my part I may do Rome
much service yet: poor I was, which my brethren have remedied, by furnishing
me with this money, they bid me be charitable to my fellow prisoners, so I
will, when I go to prison, in the meanwhile, Charity begins first at home:
thus meditating with himself, he goes to a friends house and writes a Letter to
his brethren what thoughts came unto him, and sure he was that they were sent
from above, for an Angel he said stood by him, and bade him fly speedily to
Rome, and make the brethren acquainted with the Martyrdom of their brother
Waller, who in time should sufficiently revenge his death; the Letter being
writ, he met with one John Hodgskins 2 Porter, whom he knew very well, and
gave him six pence to carry the Letter to such a place, the Porter told him
he would; away went the Papist, and away went the Porter, the porter had not
gone far but he forgot the place, no superscription being wrote, for fear of
the discovery of their meeting, upon the Letter. And the porter being greedy to
get somewhat of him to whom the letter was to be delivered, very cunningly
broke up the Letter, to seek for his name if it were there, which to find he
read the whole letter, which being done he closed it up again, and makes
directly toward the place of their meeting, thinking to reveal them all, or
else receive a good reward for the concealment of them. But when he came to
the place his hopes were frustrated, for they were all gone before he came,
their walking place was empty, wherefore he went home and to a gentleman showed
the letter, from whose mouth upon Tuesday being the 27 of July, I had the
relation, which I thought fit gentle reader to commit to the press, that all
might know with what policy the Devil deludes such simple men, by crossing
their expectations. It was a very likely matter, was it not? that any one
should, being a stranger, have admittance to the presence of a Traitor having
scarce a day to live; and then was it not an honestly for Ward to write to them
that an Angel had commanded him to fly to Rome,

His Letter consisted of that which all their Religion does, falsehood, for
were I but intended to write more then a pamphlet, I would declare such damned
fictions which are holden as a truth amongst them, would strike the Reader in
astonishment, which to do at this time I shall not, Farewell.

FINIS.
