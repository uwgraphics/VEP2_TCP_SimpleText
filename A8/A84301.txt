An EXPRESS from the KNIGHTS and GENTLEMEN now engaged with Sir GEORGE BOOTH;
To the CITY and CITIZENS of LONDON, And all other Freemen of ENGLAND.
Worthy Citizens and all other our English Freemen and Brethren,
AS we are Englishmen we are all incorporated into one Body, and though
distinct and different Families, Fortunes, and Qualities, yet Fellow Members
and Coheires of one and the same Birthright; not only by nature, as we are the
Sons of men, (nature obliging all in one Common and equal Bond of Freedom and
Unity,) but by certain sacred Laws and Customs of peculiar and inherent Right
to this Nation; general, equal, and impartial to all, without respect of
Persons, Rank, Quality, or Degree; derived through all successions of Ages, by
the Blood, Justice and Prudence of our Forefathers to us their posterity, as
Ours, and the Right of our Children after us, not Disinheritable: Though this
Age were wholly made up of Apostates and Traitors to Common Justice and
Freedom, and should make sale of, and deliver up their Children as Slaves and
Vassails, yet English Right abides, to wit our Just Laws and Liberties, and
may Justly be reinforced as Opportunity may present; Sometime they Sleep but
never Dye, their total Extinguishment is not to be imagined so long as any
Englishman or English-blood abides: and whoever undertaketh, (though by Arms
or otherwise) their Recovery and Redemption is justified in that very Action by
the Laws of God, of Nations, Nature, Reason, and by the Laws of the Land, and
within the Bowels of our Nation amongst our selves no War can be justified, but
upon that Score, the contrary is Sedition, Murder, Treason, Tyranny and what
not, and the Instruments thereof no other in the Eye of English Freedom and
Right, but as Bears, Woolves, and other Beasts of Prey.

Now right Worthy and Noble Citizens, and all other our English Brethren, let
us consider and lay to heart the Sad and Deplorable condition of our native
Country: Oppression, Injustice, and Tyranny reigns; Division, Discord and
Dissimulation fomented and fostered; Trade and Industry discouraged, our Land
rent into Parties and Factions, and the Common Band of Unity Canceled, our
Fundamental Laws supplanted, High Courts of Justice Introduced, the Blood of
War shed in times of Peace; Arbitrary and Illegal Imprisonments, Pattents,
Monopolies, Excise, and other Payments brought upon us, and continued contrary
to Magna Charta, and the Petition of Right; no form or face of Government of
English Constitution amongst us; the name and Authority of the People in
Parliament Usurped and Abused, and the Stamp thereof put upon Strange and
Prodigious Actions, Vexing and Oppressing the People with daily Changes and
Alterations in Government, as the interest of some Few Ambitious Grandees alter
and change, or get Advantages one of another, and all under the Name of a
Commonwealth, when as the Nature is not practiced or intended at all, it being
utterly inconsistent with their very Temper and Interest; they are wrapped up and
compounded of nothing but Guilt, Blood and Tyranny; and Equal and Common
Justice (the Essence of a Commonwealth) are utterly repugnant thereto; and
whatsoever they can do must be Planted and Maintained by Sword and Violence
against the very Heart and Sense of the Nation; and they know not where nor how
to center an Oligarchy or something they would have to be Masters of the
People, and Perpetuate their Power and Tyranny, and therefore would Amaze and
Confound us with their New Debates of a Coordinate Power or Senate for Life,
such as our English Laws and Liberties know not of, and of pernicious
Consequence to this Nation; So that from these men that thus handle the Stern
at Westminster, there is no expectation of any Just Settlement of Peace or
freedom from Oppression; especially considering the Apostasy, Hypocrisy,
Deceit and Perjury of those Men, their manifold Solemn Engagements, Oaths,
Vows, Protestations, Appeals unto Heaven, Promises, Remonstrances,
Declarations all by them broken again and again, never keeping Faith, Truce or
Oath, being Unbounded, Unlimited, Certain to nothing, not to be held either by
the Law of God, of Man, of Conscience or Reason; And from such Persons in
Government good Lord deliver us, and all the good people in England; and that
all this is true of them, your Consciences Noble Citizens, and all other the
Free People of England can witness, there is no Tongue, no Pen is able to
Vindicate them in this Point, it is known of all, owned by all, and can be
denied by none; how then can any Honest or Just man shed any Blood in their
Quarrel, or lend them Assistance? surely that Blood will be required at their
hands, and we doubt not but you will be careful what you do.

And therefore from those Considerations and Just Provocations we have taken up
Arms in Pursuance of, and Inquisition after our Government, Laws, and
Liberties, that every Englishman may be Protected, and Secured in his
Religion, Liberty, and Property; and though it may be suggested, that we intend
to introduce Persecution for Conscience into the Land again, we do hereby (in
the presence of Almighty God) Protest and Declare against all Coercive power in
matters of Religion, and that to the utmost of our Strength (through Gods
Assistance) we will endeavor to the hazard of our Blood and Fortunes the
Freedom and Protection of all Virtuous and Religious People, by what Name
soever differenced from Us, equal with our Selves: And that no Foreign or
other Authority save only the Civil be Exercised in England: That the Practice
of the Law be Reformed; all Corrupt Statutes Repealed; Annual Elections of all
Officers and Magistrates, with the constant Succession of Parliaments restored;
our Fundamental Laws cleared and asserted, and whatever is contrary thereto be
abolished: That no Trials be admitted in England for Life, Limb, Liberty or
Estate but by the good old way of Juries, and that they be restored to their
Original power and purity: That all Extrajudicial and Illegal proceedings by
High-Courts of Justice, or otherwise, with all Illegal and Arbitrary
Committees be strictly provided against: That the Excise, and all other
Payments and Taxes such as our Ancestors never knew of, together with all
Monopolies and Pattents destructive to Trade and the Common good of the Nation
be also abolished: And, that our Parliaments and Magistrates be secured from
all Force and Violence; and utterly cleared from all boundless Prerogative,
and unlimited Privilege: That the Right of the Poor in the Commons of England,
all Donations for Charitable Uses, and all Lands formerly belonging to the
People be restored again: And that Mercy and Justice be truly established
amongst us. And for these ends and what else may be of public good to the
Nation, we do desire, and indeed challenge as of English Right, the speedy
Election of a New Free Parliament.

And thus, most Noble Citizens, Brethren and fellow Freemen of England, we
have dealt Truly and Plainly with you, and given you the real Grounds and
Reasons of our Taking up Arms; looking upon you as the most concerned in the
Nation, and therefore hold our selves the more obliged to give you this Early
Advice of our Candid and Just Intentions in this Undertaking, that you may not
be Deluded or Frighted (though falsely) into any strange Opinion of us, either
through your own mistake, or by the Policy of those men who will leave no
means unattempted to render us as Public Enemies, Rebels and Traitors,
Plunderers, Tyrants and Persecutors, or what ever is Odious and Monstrous, to
engage you in Blood.

Believe us, Right worthy Citizens, and Freeborn English Brethren, we have no
Design of Fire or Sword, or Evil toward you or your City; or any part of the
Nation, or any Person in it: We know there are thousands amongst you that are
satisfied in us; It may be indeed that many or most of the Gathered Separate
Churches may be Fearful and Jealous of us, and so may be induced to Arms
against us; but we do again and again protest before Almighty God, and the
whole World, that we have no other purpose toward them, but that they with us,
and we with them, may be bound up as Friends and Brethren in the Common Cause
of our Country, that every Englishman may have English Freedom and Right;
and we do not desire to wrong either Man, Woman or Child the worth of a
Shooe-latchet: Therefore we hope you will first well advise before you proceed
in a new War, lest you bring not only your own, but others Blood on your Heads
(for we are resolved to prosecute this to the last drop of our Blood.) The Case
of England is laid before you, our Laws and Liberties, they are Yours as well
as Ours, and for which we have all engaged in the first War, and not to be so
slightly vallued as to be set at Stake against the Private Ends of some
Ambitious and Corrupt Persons: Salus Populi, Suprema Lex; Let the People Live,
and their Enemies Perish.

Therefore we beseech you, we conjure you as Englishmen, to stand by your
Native Country, and your Countries Cause: Our voice is, and it is no other
than the Consent and Voice of the People, A New Free Parliament, A New Free
Parliament; it is the English-mans Main Birthright, which we are resolved to
put the People in possession of, or to perish with our Swords in our hands. But
if you will not join, but degenerate, we hope notwithstanding (by Gods
Blessing) to carry on this Work: Yet to that Just and Glorious Work we may
challenge your Concurrence, it being your Duty as well as ours to endeavor the
procurement thereof And therefore to you make it our Proposal, to your
Militia, to the Army, and the whole People, for the prevention of a New War,
and the effusion of English Blood, that you would be isntrumental with us for
the speedy Election of a New Free Parliament, for the ends aforesaid; and in
the interim all Hostility to be forborne; and that a day may be appointed, and
the People suffered to go to their free Elections, and we shall quietly submit
to their Authority; heartily desiring all Revenge, Division, Rancor, and
Animositie of spirit may be for ever buried in one General Act of Oblivion;
And that all Parties, Sects, and Sorts (now jarring, and making up interests
one against another) may Reconcile, Cement, and Concenter in the common
Brotherhood of English Freedom and Right; in and for which we are.

Sir GEORGE BOOTH To a Friend of his in LONDON.
