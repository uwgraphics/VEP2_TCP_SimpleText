An Admonition to the READER.
IF thou art learned, it may be, this, that I here present to thy view, coming
in so homely, and Country-like a dress, may not please thee: Yet this much let
me entreat of thee, that (seeing it comes from an honest heart, and one
devoted to the common good of Gods Afflicted ones) thou will not hinder others
from making use of it, that have no better.

Nec omnia quae ab omnibus conscribuntur in omnium manus veniunt, and fieri
potest, ut nonnulli qui etiam haec nostra intelligere valent, illos pleniores
non inveniant libros, and in istos saltem incidant, ideoque utile est plures, a
pluribus fieri tractatus, diverso flyto, non diversa fide, etiam de
quaestionibus iisdem, ut ad plurimos res ipsa perveniat, ad alios sic, ad alios
autem sic. August. lib. 1. de Trinit. c. 3. tom. 3.
Saint Augustine thought, that the plainest Books might be of some use to some
sorts of men: and who knows not, that the Stars, which are obscured in the
presence of the Sun, are profitable in his absence to give light to the earth?

If thou shall say (to make it the less respected) that there is little in it
of mine own, but that all, or the most part of it, is taken out of other men's
works; I ingenuously confess it; Scribo Relatoris potius fide, quam Authoris
praesumptione. Vincent. Lyrinens. advers. Haeres.
professing my self, not to be the Author, but the bare Relator of these
spiritual Comforts. And if I have in any passage thereof drunk deeper thereof
then became a sober Passenger, I would have thee to know, that I did it for one
of these two ends; either because I thought, I could not amend what they had
done, which was Quod me non posse facere, melius credidi.
Aphranius his Apology, when he was accused for taking too much out of
Menanders Works; or because I thought, that their authority would win more
credit to the things said, then mine would; which was Quod censeo me parum

niterer. Patric. in Epist. ad Senate. Senens. ante librum ejus de institut.

Patricius his plea in a like case: Let this therefore suffice thee.

Secondly, if thou art unlearned, and can not judge of it thy self, but have
only learned (Parrat-like) to speak after others, it may be this may not
afford thee comfort neither; for we seldom reap profit by any man's Works,
whose person is pre-judged, though misjudged.

I only say to thee, if thou art an unhumbled Christian, a man whole and
^ledge^ound in thine own conceit; one that ^ledge^hinketh he never went awry;
or having gone awry, does imagine, that no discomforts in that wrong way can
befall him, for which he cannot give himself comfort sufficient; then this
belongs not to thee neither; for Math. 9. 12.

Containing in it, Directions, both for the Practice and Knowledge of Gods
Child in the time of Spiritual Distress.
THE FIRST PART, Containing Directions for the Practice of Gods Child in the
time of Spiritual Distress.
THE INTRODUCTION.
THe Child of God troubled in Mind, and distressed in Conscience, needs
Directions for two things: for his Practice, and for his Knowledge.

I put Practice first, because, though in all ^ledge^ther estates of Gods
Child, Knowledge ^ledge^ust go before Practice, yet in this parti^ledge^lar,
there can be no sound knowledge attained unto, without precedent Practica est
praevia introductio ad theorica^. Olympiodor. in Eccles. 7. Most true in this
case.
practic^redge^

Now the practice of Gods child in th^redge^ distressed estate, has reference,
either ^redge^ that which he is to do, or to that which ^redge^ is to leave
undone.

That which he is to do, has farther r^redge^ference to four particulars:
for either ^redge^ respects himself who is Distressed: or ^redge^ God, who is
the Author of his Distress^redge^ or his spiritual Enemy, Satan, the
mean^redge^ and isntrumental cause of his Distress: ^redge^ his Brethren, the
fellow members of Ch^redge^ his body, who formerly have been th^redge^
Distressed.

SECTION I.
TOuching himself who is Distressed this is carefully to be practiced.

1. And before all things, let him loo^redge^ to the estate of his body: for
though See M. Boltons instruct. for comfort. afflict. consc. page 207. touching
the differences between Melancholy, and an afflicted Conscience.
trouble of mind does not always ar^redge^ from distemperature of body, yet
s^redge^dome is there trouble of mind seen^redge^ which is not accompanied
with very gre^redge^ distemperature in this kind, especially ^redge^
Complexions subject to See M. Bur. Melanc. p. 536. etc. and page 46.
Melancholy whereby the former trouble is much This humor does naturally give
extraordinary entertainment and edge ^redge^ terrors and sorrows. Boltons
Instruct. for comf. afflict. Consc. p. 464*
i^redge^ creased, the parties being by this means made less capable of good
Counsel, and more fit for Satan's Temptations to work on, who are thus
Distempered.

And therefore my first advise, and counsel to such, is this. As Soon as thou
do begin to be thus troubled in mind, See Ecclus. 38. 4. etc. M. Burtons
Melanc. p. 544.
send speedily for some Godly, and learned Physician for thy body, and be
content to be ruled, and advised by him in the course of Physic, that he shall
prescribe thee, whatsoever Satan shall suggest into thy mind to the contrary.
For I know, Barbara immanitate, and deploranda inscitia contemnunt praecepta
sanitatis, mortem and morbos ultro accersunt. Melanct. de anima.
he will be ^ledge^ufie with thee (as he has been formerly with others of
Gods Children in like case) to seek to dissuade thee (if possibly he can) from
this course, as knowing none to ^ledge^e more prejudicial unto him, and more
^ledge^eneficiall unto thee, then this (through the ^ledge^lessing of God) will
be.

And this advise of mine, I limit with ^ledge^hese Caveats. I. That this
Physician to ^ledge^hom thou sendest be not Baal-zebub, the God of Ekron; 2
King. 1. 3.
I mean some cunning ^ledge^an, or woman (as they are commonly ^ledge^ermed)
though indeed they be very Wit^ledge^hes: For this were to cast out Mat. 12. 24.
Satan by ^ledge^athan, they being no other then the very ^ledge^struments,
and limbs of the Devil. And ^ledge^uch better were it to want Cure, then to
^ledge^ave the Devil for thy Physician. And surely he is thy Physician, and
not God, whe^redge^ thou sendest to such people for health. An^redge^ therefore
though thy ignorant neighbors and graceless friends that are about thee shall
advise, and urge thee in this time o^redge^ need to send to such justly
suspected persons, See the Pract. of Piety, page 782. All our Divines,
Schoolmen, and such as write Cases of Conscience, are against it. See M.
Burtons Melanc. p. 191.
hearken not unto them, nay hat^redge^ their advise, as bad as Satan himself,
an^redge^ resolve rather to suffer any inconvenienc^redge^ in thy body, where
more lawful meane^redge^ cannot be had for help, then to use suc^redge^ whose
help comes wholly from Satan. Fo^redge^ be thou assured of this, that Satan,
who ^redge^ thy deadly enemy, 1 Pet. 5. 8. A seductoribus fallacibus, a patre
mendacii, ab host crudelissimo, quid boni, quid very, quid commodi speras, tu
videris. Gers. de error. mag. part. 3. Daemones et si sanarent, Deo irato
sanarent: Corpora sanarent, ut necarent animas, etc. ib.
and desires nothi^redge^ so much as thy destruction, cannot wis^redge^ thee
so well, as to procure thee health ^redge^ body, unless it be to procure
greater hu^redge^ by it unto thy soul.

Another caveat is this, that though tho^redge^ use the bodily Physician for
thy need, y^redge^ that thou have a care not to trust in th^redge^ Physician
but in God for thy health. It w^redge^ Asa his fault, and he felt the smart of
i^redge^ The Physic he used could not help hi^redge^ because he relied more
upon the Physitia^redge^ then he did upon God, 2 Chronicles. 16. 12.

2. Ubi desinit Medicus, ibi incipit Theologus. Never so true as here.
After thou have thus rectified t^redge^ distemperature of thy body, and art
^redge^ means of it made capable of good cou^redge^sell for thy souls health:
my next advise ^redge^ that thou speedily send for some Ex his vocandi sunt, si
noveris, peritiores and curiosiores. -- Et si dici liceat spiritaliores. Aug.
tom. 9. p. 2. de visitat. infirmorum, l. 2. c. 7.
Godly and learned Minister of Gods Word, (that Interpretour, one of a
thousand, as Job calls him, Job 33. 23.) upon whose fidelity, and secrecy thou
dare rely; and discover unto him what that is, that does most trouble thee,
that so he by his learned advise and Godly counsel, may through Gods blessing
afford thee comfort. And in case thou know not, or art not acquainted with
any such Minister, or can not speedily come to him, or he to thee, open thy
mind to any In casu necessitatis quilibet Christianus est sacerdos. Magdeburg.
Epist. Dedicat. praefix. centur. 7. Et si defuerit sacerdos, proximo, vel socio
facienda est confessio Lombard. Scot. alii in sent. 4. dis. 17.
near, or dear friend about thee: For temptations smothered, as fire, burn more
inwardly: And like inward See M. Boltons instructons for comforting afflicted
consciences, p. 549. B. Halls pract. cases of cons. decad 3. sect. 9.
wounds do drown the heart with bleeding before any hurt be discerned. Whereas
the readiest way to put out this fire is to give it vent, and the readiest way
to cure this wound, is to draw it to an outward issue by confession.

I know that this is a thing, which Satan by suggesting shame, Many are
pudoris magis memores, quam salutis, says one. Stulto^ledge^um incurata pudor
malus ulcera celat. See M. Bolton ubi supra, page 466.
or fear Sua vulnera nutrit, Qui tegit, and plagam trepidat nudare medenti.
Sedul. li. 3. oper. paschal. M. Burtons Melanc. page 242.
of danger or the like unto thee, will seek to dissuade thee from, but believe
him not in this neither: for the shame, or danger be it what it will be, cannot
be comparable to the least comfort that will by this means redound unto thy
soul. Others of Gods Children in this case have tried it, and their experience
may be to thee a proof sufficient of the truth of it.

But here I must also give thee these Caveats. I. If it be sin that troubles
thy conscience, content not thy self only with a general acknowledgment of
sin, but descend further to particulars, yea to that very particular sin,
which above all others does most trouble thee. I have seen some thus
distressed dealing with God, and his Ministers in confession of their sins
Dan. 2. See M. Bolton ubi sup. p. 209, 210.
as Nebuchadnezzar with his inchanters about his Dream that he had dreamed, he
told them, and desired an interpretation, but what his Dream was he could not
tell. So these confess themselves Sinners, and cry out that they are grievous
Offenders, and desire pardon, but wherein they have sinned, and what their
sins are, they cannot, or will not tell.

But how can the Si vis curari agnosce languorem. P. Chrysolog. Sermon. 30.
Absque causaru^ observatione, morbos nec praecavere, nec curare licet. Fernel.
Patholog. li. 7. c. 11.
Physician help him that says he is not well, but will not tell him where? And
how can the Physician of the Soul comfort that sinner, which is thus
Soule-sick, and will not tell what sin it is that troubles him? Nay perhaps
though he may do it to others, not thus distressed, by applying general
comforts to general distresses: Yet in this case where there is a particular
cause of a particular Distress, I never heard of the particular Distress
cured, without the particular cause first opened: and let me tell you mine And
others have found the same, for Mr. Bolton tells us of one that he knew, who
concealed for 20. years together a temptation of Blasphemy, by means of which
the Devil all that time kept him in perpetual terror, and oftentimes urged
him to make himself away, and from this fearful estate was never freed, till
he discovered it. Bolton ubi supra, page 550.
experience in this kind. I have observed the disposition of most in this
misery to be such, that except they can find Comfort touching the very
particular thing that was the occasion of their Distress, there is little or
no ease brought to the Distressed.

2. As I do persuade thee to discover thy particular sin, which is the cause
of thy Distress, so I would also persuade thee to discover with it (as near
as thou can) all the circumstances whereby Satan seeks to aggravate it
unto thy conscience. For sometime Satan frames his Distresses not so much
from the sin it self, that is committed, as from the circumstances of it,
attending it in the committing, using those as tenter-hookes to stretch it by,
to the utmost rack of aggravation. And therefore the safest course here, and
that, that is likely soonest to find ease, is to discover even these
circumstances too. To the Physician thou will discover even thy mos^redge^
shameful Diseases, the fruits of thy filthies^redge^ wickedness; and in case
thou should her^redge^ conceal but one circumstance, it may cos^redge^ thee
thy life: surely so thou must do her^redge^ too, or thou must look for the
like issue. Let me here also tell thee, what I have known: I have known in
this kind many circumstances discovered, and yet one circumstance undiscovered
(on which Sata^redge^ has especially wrought) to have kept th^redge^
Conscience still on the rack.

3. And lastly, as in this kind thou mus^redge^ take heed, and beware of
Spiritual guile in hiding ought; so of the same Spiritual guile too, in
relating ought for a Medicus quando aegritudinem discutit, si curet quod per
aliquam causam factum est, and ipsam causam per quam factu^ est non curet, ad
tempus videtur mederi, sed causa manente morbus repetitur. Aug. in Joh. 25
cause of thy trouble, which is not: For, herein thou will give Satan a greater
advantage against thee, then before he had, and thou thy self wilt be as far
to seek of Comfort, and Ease, as ever thou were, notwithstanding this thy
Confession. Nay, many times such deceitful dealing with our Spiritual
Physician, makes him apply a clean contrary Salve to our Soar, which will put
us to farther Smart for the present, and to greater Anguish too afterward, as
oftentimes we have seen it proved. And therefore when thou do thus discover
thy mind, be as careful to avoid Collusion, and Deceit, as Reservation.

SECT. II.
THe second sort of things which the Child of God is to do in this time of
spiritual Distress, respects his God. And they are two: the first is to Pray
unto him, and the second is to give him Thanks.

Thouching Prayer, this advice I give thee. 1. (Because they that are thus
Distressed, commonly complain that they cannot Pray.) I would have thee always
to remember, that thou do pray as thou can, though not as thou would, or
should: For better is Dr. Sclatter, Mr. Schudder, and others.
weak performance in this kind, then whole Omission; and safer it is to pray
weakly, then not to pray at all. For if we pray as we are able, we have this
Comfort. 1. That Gods Spirit Romans 8. 26, 27.
within us will help our infirmities, and make us pray Etiam solis vagitibus
infans matrem commovet ad misericordiam. Macar. hom. 31 Videmus vulgo parents
magis delectari balbutienti infantia infantium quam universa eloquentia hominu^
eloquentissimorum. Rolloc. in Johan. cap. 4.
acceptably, though (to our seeming) we pray uneffectually: it being a
privilege ^ledge^elonging unto God, to know the meaning of his Spirit, praying
in us, when we know it not our selves. And 2. That our Prayers, though in
themselves; and as they come from us, be never so unperfect, yet before they
come unto God, they are made perfect Rev 8. 3. 4.
by Jesus Christ: It being a part of his Advocation to propitiate as well for
our weaknesses, and imperfections i^redge^ Prayer, as for any other of our
Sins whereof we stand guilty in the sight of God.

Again, (because such distressed Soule^redge^ do most commonly more distaste
the Form of Prayer, then the Action of Praying, a^redge^ not enduring any long,
or set Form o^redge^ Prayer to be made, either by themselves, o^redge^ others
in this time of their Distress) therefore my second advice is this. If the
case stand thus with thee, have a care that tho^redge^ be the more frequent in
shorter, and Sententiary For which see the sick Souls Ejaculations hereafter
set down. Luke 18. 13.
ejaculations, and Expressions o^redge^ thy mind unto God, such as was that
o^redge^ the Publican, O God be merciful unto me ^redge^ sinner: That in the
Lords Prayer, Lord lea^redge^ me not into temptation, or the like, according as
the present sense of thy want, does teach thee, and enforce thee to pray. For
such Prayers as these are, arising (as most commonly they do) out of the sense
of our present wants, do pass from us with greatest ardency of Affection, and
therefore cannot but find soonest audience with God for our present supply:
his Word assuring us, That the Prayer of a Righteous James 5. 16.
man shall much prevail with him, where it is Fervent.

But here remember two Rules. 1. In all thy Prayers for Ease, and Deliverance
^ledge^eferre all to the good will and pleasure of Mat. 26. 39.
^ledge^od, to be granted, or denied, as will stand ^ledge^est with his Glory,
and the Good, and ^ledge^alvation of thy Soul. 2. Have a care that ^ledge^hou
do not limit, and prescribe God, the ^ledge^me, or means of thy Deliverance,
but ^ledge^eave that wholly to the disposing of his ^ledge^ise Providence, who
knows better then ^ledge^hou do, when, and how to give thee Ease, Comfort,
and Deliverance.

The other thing, respecting thy God, which thou art to perform, is to give
him Thanks. And touching that, this is also ^ledge^ine advice. If thou receive
never so little Ease, Release, or Comfort, give thanks ^ledge^nto God for
that, and this will be a means ^ledge^hat in Gods good time thou shall find *
Gratiarum actio est ad plus dandum invitatio. Ambros. Mat. 25. 29.
^ledge^ more: For he has promised in his Word, That to him that has, and
uses what he ^ledge^ath, to the Glory of God that gave it, ^ledge^here shall
be more given, and he shall have it ^ledge^n abundance.

SECT. III.
THe third sort of things which Gods Child is to do in this time of
Spiri^ledge^uall Distress, respects his Spiritual enemy, ^ledge^atan. And
they are two.

The first is, that he have a care to with^ledge^and his Temptations when they
are first suggested. And touching this, this is min^redge^ advice. That
whenever Satan does suggest unto thee any wicked Temptation: ^redge^ to
Blaspheme God, for the present sma^redge^ which thou feel under his visiting
hand which was Jobs Temptation. Or that tho^redge^ Job 2. 9.
art wholly cast out of his sight, because he th^redge^ grievously afflicts
thee: which was Jona^redge^ Jonah 2. 4.
his Temptation. Or that it is in vain ^redge^ serve God, considering he so
punishes thos^redge^ that serve him, and lets the wicked go free^redge^
which was David's Temptation, or the like Psalm. 73. 13.
Let it be thy care to withstand them, (^redge^ possibly thou can) at the Sea
D. Tailor in Matthew. 4. 1. p. 35. and 372. M. Downames Warfare, part 4. p. 355.
357. etc. Jam. 4. 7. Man. 4. 10, 11.
first suggestio^redge^ for so thou shall be sure to be rid of Satan for the
present, it being his propert^redge^ cowardly to fly from, where he finds he
i^redge^ resisted: and shall free thy Soul from ^redge^ great deal of Trouble
and Misery; in which such Temptations usually implunge those that give any way
unto them without resistance.

The other thing, respecting Satan thy Spiritual enemy, which I would also
have thee to perform, is this, to have a care that after one Temptation is
ended, thou expect, and prepare for Sola hic securitas est, nunqua^ esse
securu^. Rob. Grosthead, Epist. 65.
a new assault, using the time of Satan's Intermission, as a breathing time to
recover strength against the next Encounter. For as Soldiers besieged, after
they have sustained one assault, and given their Enemies the Repulse, do not
securely give themselves to idleness, and sleep, but prepare all things ready
against the next Conflict, mending the Breaches, and repairing those places,
which in the time of Fight they found to be most weak See D. Sclatter in 1
These. 3. page 218. B. Lakes Sermon. part 1. pa. 248. Nanquam bella bonis, nunquam
dissidia cessant. Prosp. in Epig.
. So when thou have withstood some of Satan's Temptations, and given him the
Repulse, thou art not to give thy self to rest, sleeping in security, as though
thine Enemy were wholly overcome See Mat. 4. 3, 5, 8, etc. and Luke 4. 13.
: But rather, in the Intermission of this Spiritual Conflict, thou art to
prepare thy self against the next assault, using all means to confirm thy
strength, where thou discernedst in the time of Fight, that thou were most
weak, and more strongly to Arm thy self against those Temptations which thou
foundest most forcible, and powerful to prevail against thee.

SECT. IV.
THe fourth and last thing which the Child of God is to do in this time of
Spiritual Distress, respects the Godly, his Fellow-brethren in Christ, who
formerly have been thus Distressed, but are now (through Gods mercy) Delivered.
And that is, to confer with them, or with others about them, the better to
lea^redge^ what God has done for their Souls; th^redge^ so, he taking the
like Courses that the^redge^ have done, may expect the like mercy fro^redge^
God toward his Soul.

And touching this, this is mine advic^redge^ 1. That thou do confer with
such, ^redge^ often as thou can, that can Experime^redge^tally relate unto
thee, what God in th^redge^ kind has done for their Souls, or ca^redge^ show
thee what God has done for othe^redge^ in like case. For, hearing them relate
th^redge^ deep Distresses wherein they have been, an^redge^ Gods wonderful
mercy toward the^redge^ in their Deliverance; it will both encourage thee to
bear with more patience thy present Trouble, and with greater assurance of
Comfort, to wait for Gods appointed time of thy Deliverance hereafter.

And secondly, if thou should meet with no such living precedents of Gods
favou^redge^ vouchsafed in this kind, I would then advise thee to peruse the

to Gods Glory, and their own Souls unspeakable Comfort.

And thereby assure thy self, that thou shall have the like happy Issue of all
thy trouble, if thou do continue in their Holy practice of Patience, and
reposed Trust in God. For Gods dealing with his Children in this kind, is 1 Timothy 1. 16
Exemplary, he showing in one, what all in like case may on like Conditions
expect. And thus have we seen what the Child of God is to do in this time of
Spiritual Distress.

SECT. V.
THe other things respecting practice, wherein the child of God at this time
needs advise, are such things, as he is to leave undone. And those are
especially two.

The First is, that he do not muse, and meditate on his present Miseries, or
recall to mind those that are past, or through fear anticipate those that are
to come.

And the Second is, that he do not reason, and dispute with Satan in his
private thoughts, or otherways.

Unto both which (we find by experience) that the child of God is too too much
subject at this time: And that many of them for want of a godly care, and
Christian endeavor to withstand them, have been driven by means of them to
fearful extremities. Now that thou may the better take heed of them, and
learn to prevent them, I give thee this advise.

First, touching musing, and meditating, the better to avoid that, I would have
thee carefully to shun Solitariness, and Idleness, which are the Nemo est ex
imprudentibus qui relinqui fibi debeat: tunc mala consilia agitant, tunc aut
aliis aut ipsis, futura pericula struunt, etc. Senec. Epist. 10. Nihil
agend^redge^ discunt homines male agere. Cato. Non est aliqua cogitatio, tam
turpis, abominabilis, mala, and execranda, quam non inveniat otiositas, etc.
Gerson de modo habendi, se contra mal* immisc.
Parents commonly, or the Nurses of such musing thoughts.

As for Solitariness, the best way to avoid that, is to keep thy self
always i^redge^ the company of God, or good Men.

Thou art in Gods company then more especially, when either God talks to thee
or thou to God. And this is done by two Exercises especially, by Prayer, and by
Reading the Bible, or some other good Books For by Prayer thou speak unto
God, and by Reading these Books God speaks unto thee. So that which soever of
them thou do perform, and in performing of i^redge^ do intend, and mind
what thou art about, thou may truly say of thy self a^redge^ sometimes that
Roman Nunquam minus solus, qua^ cum solus. Scipio in Cicer. Offic. li. 3.
Captain di^redge^ of himself, Nunquam minus solus, quam cum solus. Scipio in
Cicer. Offic. lib. 3
Thou being alone, thou art not alone, for thou have God to bear thee Company.
The company of good men, is also a very good means to avoid solitariness. I
say of good men, for if they be not good, I ^ledge^eane such as fear God, and
are able by ^ledge^heir gracious words, or godly deeds to ^ledge^oe thee good,
thou were better be alone, ^ledge^hen be in their company.

And here I would advise thee to shun ^ledge^he company of four sorts of
People especi^ledge^ly: which in this case, are likely to prove ^ledge^ore
dangerous unto thee, then Solitari^ledge^esse would be.

The first are men notoriously Wicked, who ^ledge^ould persuade thee to laugh
these thy ^ledge^rrowes out of countenance, by joining ^ledge^ith them in
mirth, that is either immode^ledge^te, or immodest, or to drown thy grief
^ledge^y excessive drinking, See Master Hierons Works, in fol. vol. 1. page
159. Mr. Greenham in his Sermon of Repentance. Mr. Dike of Repent. cap. 3. Mr.
Marbury in his Sermon upon Psalm. 32.
or the like. For the ^ledge^est good that these can do thee, is but to
^ledge^rocure thee a seeming Truce, no sound ^ledge^eace: Their best comforts
proving but as ^ledge^ater cast on the Smiths Fire, which ^ledge^aketh for the
present an abatement of ^ledge^e flame, but in the issue we see it is a
^ledge^eanes to increase both the flame, and the ^ledge^eate too; the return of
the trouble, and ^ledge^squietnesse, paying the interest of the for^ledge^er
deferring with more then once multi^ledge^ied use.

The second, are men notoriously Ignora^redge^ who at such times come more of
custom^redge^ to see, then of Conscience to say any thi^redge^ that may be for
thy Comfort: or if th^redge^ chance to say ought tending that way, ^redge^ many
times proves (through their want ^redge^ Spiritual wisdom and Christian
expe^redge^ence in businesses of this Nature) mo^redge^ hurtful, then helpful
to those to whe^redge^ they speak it.

The third, are men extremely Rigid, a^redge^ See Mr. Down. Warfare, part 3
lib. 2. chap. 32. Sect. 3.
too too tart, and harsh in their beh^redge^viour and carriage toward Gods
afflict^redge^ ones. For these are more likely to g^redge^ thy new skinned
wounds, and to ma^redge^ thy Soars of sorrow almost healed, ^redge^ to bleed
afresh; then by the balsame ^redge^ Comfort, and discreet counsel, to g^redge^
unto thee (the grieved patient) any ^redge^ freshing.

And the fourth, and last, are those w^redge^ being in the contrary extreme
are too ^redge^ sorrowful, and over passionate, for th^redge^ will See Master
Downam, ubi supra.
weep over thy Wounds, instead ^redge^ curing them, and by their Sorrow
rede^redge^ thine: thou thinking that they see, ^redge^ are grieved for more,
then thou see in, ^redge^ by thy self.

The other means to prevent such ^redge^sing, and Meditation in time of
Spiriti^redge^ Distress, is to avoid Idleness: for ^redge^ ^ledge^ Idle man's
Head is the Devils Shop, wherein Vide Cornel a lap. in Pauli' Epist. p. 725.
Col. 1. etc. B. B. King. on Jon. p. 433. Eccles. 33. 28. Idleness teaches much
evil, Graec. (...). See Dr. Saund^ledge^rs Sermon on 1 Cor. 7. 24. page 411.
Master Burtons Melancholy. page 73. 74.
^ledge^e is never more at work, then when we are ^ledge^dle: Idleness laying
a man open to all ^ledge^ellish Snares and temptations; and ma^ledge^ing the
heart, like unmanured ground, fit ^ledge^or nothing but the wildest, and
rankest ^ledge^eedes of Sin; like standing Pooles natu^ledge^ally prepared,
and pregnant to breed, and ^ledge^eed the Vermin of vilest thoughts, and
^ledge^nnaturall Filth: yea, like thorow-fares for ^ledge^atans most hideous,
and horrible injecti^ledge^ns to wander, and walk up and down in, ^ledge^ithout
restraint, or remedy.

And the better to avoid this too, I would ^ledge^dvise thee to take this
course: 1. What ^ledge^me thou have to spare from thy formerly ^ledge^rescribed
exercises of Religion and Pie^ledge^ Res age, tutus eris. Ovid. de remed. Amor.
See Dr. Saunderson, ubi supra. Semper b^ni aliquid operis facito ut Diabolus
te, semper inveniat occupatum. Hieron. ad Rusticum. Tom. 1 Epist. 4.
: which are Prayer unto God, reading ^ledge^ Gods Word, Godly Conference, and
the ^ledge^ke: I would have thee carefully, and con^ledge^ionably to employ thy
self in the honest works ^ledge^d labors of thy particular Calling. For
^ledge^ese conscionably followed, as they are ^ledge^od to free the mind from
present evil ^ledge^oughts, so they have seldom gone without See Luke 2. 8.
blessing from God for the further com^ledge^rt of those that have followed
them.

But yet See M. Downams Warfare, part. 3. l. 2. c. 32. ^ledge^ct. 4. In ludi
defectu potest esse peccatum. See M. Gataker of Lots, ^ledge^g. 188. M. Burtons
Melancholy. page 73.
excessive and unremitted labor, ^ledge^th proved to some in this case as
hurtful as Idleness; and therefore to preven^redge^ the like inconvenience in
thee, my secon^redge^ advise to thee is this. That as thou do^redge^ spend the
chief part of thy time in takin^redge^ pains, and in performing the duties
o^redge^ piety, and of thy calling, the better to p^redge^ out of thy mind
such false apprehension^redge^ and idle conceits: so thou would als^redge^
allot some share thereof for thy Recreatio^redge^ and refreshment. But here
take heed of fo^redge^ things.

1. That the recreation which thou use^redge^ be not That is neither forbidden
by the Lawyer, as against the Statutes: nor by the Physician, as against
Health: nor by the Divine, as against Conscience. Master Fullers holy State.

Rules special Sect. 1.
unlawful, or at least of ill rep^redge^ amongst the Children of God, and such
^redge^ fear him. For this will be so far from ^redge^ freshing thee, and
giving thee comfo^redge^ that it will rather put a new whip into S^redge^tans
hand for the further lashing of thy ^redge^ ready-wounded Soul, as some of
Go^redge^ Children in this case can tell thee out ^redge^ their miserable, and
much to be pitied e^redge^perience.

2. Take heed that the recreation whi^redge^ thou usest, be such a one, as in
the time ^redge^ recreating thy self therewith, may exerc^redge^ and keep thy
mind employed, as well (if ^redge^ more) then thy Body; those being the
b^redge^ See Master Burtons Melancholy. p 230
Recreations at this time, that do wh^redge^ take up the mind, and keep it
from wo^redge^ thoughts; such as is playing at Chesse, whi^redge^ I have
therefore judged ever best, and m^redge^ conducible to this present estate: but
herein let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind, Romans 14. 5.

3. Take heed that thou do not use this recreation, more like a work of thy

ordinary Calling, then like a Recreation: my meaning is, that thou do not
suffer it to take up thy most, and best hours; for the Devil, that subtle
Adversary of thine, is like enough to draw thee, thus (if thou will be drawn)
from one extreme to another.

4. And lastly, I would have thee especially to take heed that thou do not use
such ^ledge^ecreations too much at the first See Mr. Dow. Warfare. part 3 l. 2.
c. 32. Sect. 4.
approaching of this thy felt affliction: for by so doing ^ledge^hou wilt be
kept from applying it to thine Heart, and from making that Holy, and Sanctified
use of it for the furthering of ^ledge^hy Repentance and Mortification, which
otherwise thou would, and ought to make. And therefore in the first place
always remember to give way unto Godly ^ledge^ sorrow for sin, which is the
cause of this * Dolor melancholicus converti debet in dolorem qui est sccundum
Deum. Alsted. Theolog. Casuum, cap. 5.
^ledge^hy present affliction, and use this Cross ^ledge^s a Hammer to drive
Repentance the more ^ledge^eeply into thine Heart: and when that ^ledge^s done,
then spare not to refresh thy mind with such recreations, which otherwise
would be tired with the weight, and continuance of this thy felt Calamity, But
yet so, a^redge^ that neither first, nor last, these thy recreations may lessen
thy godly sorrow for Sin, which is always too little, and far shor^redge^ of
that it should be: but only mitigat^redge^ thy grief for thy present misery,
which to^redge^ too often is excessive, and immoderate* For as the Salve being
rightly applied t^redge^ the Soar does heal, and cure it; so this medicine of
lawful Recreation, if it be we^redge^ applied to that sorrow which is
occasione^redge^ by this thine Affliction, will do thee mu^redge^ good, and
help to recover thy Spiritu^redge^ health: whereas otherwise, if it be
mi^redge^ applied unto thy sorrow for Sin, whi^redge^ is a saving Grace, and
one of the sounde^redge^ parts of a true Christian, it will be like ^redge^

That (whenever There be both temptations to sin, and temptations for sin.
Satan does lay any sin to thy charge which thou have committed, or does
further tempt thee unto any sin which he would have thee to commit) thou do not
stand See Master Boltons Instruct. for comforting afflicted Conscien. p. 545,

otherwise, (for this is that that he desires) but rather, 1. Repel him, and
his suggestions with vehement detestation and disdain, as Christ did, saying,
Avoid Satan, Mat. 4. 10. Or 2. as Hezekiah did spread that blasphemous Letter,
Esaias 37. 15. before the Lord, so do thou lay open before the Lord his Hellish
suggestions, and with him cry mightily unto God, ver. 16, 17. etc. that he
would stop the mouth of this railing Rabshakeh of Hell, or give thee support
against him, and his accusations. Or lastly, put him over to Jesus Christ thy
Savior, who has taken upon him to be not only thy Redeemer, and thy
Mediator, and Intercessour unto God his Father, but also to be thine Epist.

only thine Advocate, but thine Esai. 54. 5. Jer. 31. 32. See Dyke on John 3.

Husband too, and as thine Husband he both must, and will defend thee in all
just Actions brought against thee, either by Satan, thine own Conscience, or
any other. For the Husband stands answerable for the Wife: and it is a^redge^

And thus have thou Direction for tha^redge^ which thou art to practice in this
time o^redge^ spiritual Distress. That which followet^redge^ is for the
Direction of thy knowledge.

JOHN 13. 17. If ye know these things, blessed are ye if y^redge^ do them.
The Sick Souls Guide.
THE SECOND PART, Containing Directions for the Knowledge of Gods Child in the
time of Spiritual Distress.
THE INTRODUCTION.
THE other thing for which the Child of God needs Direction in this time of
Spiritual Distress, is his Knowledge.

And touching that, I give thee this advise, whosoever thou art, that art thus
Distressed.

1. That thou labor to know those things which may help to increase thy
patience. And 2. That thou labor to know those things which may help to
further thy comfort.
SECT. I.
IT will help much to the increasing of thy patience: if thou will but know,
and take notice of the particulars which here follow.

1. That God is the Esai. 45. 7. Amos 3. 6. 1 Samuel 2. 5, 6. Ruth 1. 20, 21.
Hos. 6. 1. See Micah 6. 9.
Author of thy Distress, whose almighty power is guided by ^redge^ most wise
providence, and tempered with ^redge^ fatherly love; and therefore in
afflicting thee thus, can intend nothing but what shall be for his glory, and
for thine unspeakable good in the end. And that this has been^redge^ an
excellent means, and help to beget patience in Gods afflicted ones, the
Scripture do plentifully show us.

The consideration of this made Levit. 10. 3.
Aar^redge^ to hold his peace, Psalm. 39. 9.
David to be dumb, a^redge^ not once to open his mouth: And the like w^redge^
read of Esai. 38. 13.
Hezekiah, 1 Samuel 3. 18.
Eli, Job 1. 21. 22.
Job, and others of Gods Saints mentioned in t^redge^ Scriptures.

Nay not only Scripture, but even N^redge^ture too, does teach us this truth,
for what See M. Dow. Warfare. part. 3 l. 2. c. 6. Sect. 3.
beast do we see, or know, though nev^redge^ so Savage in himself, or fierce
towar^redge^ others, which will not take Blows fro^redge^ his Keeper that
tends him, without Sn^redge^ling, or repining? And therefore tho^redge^ must
be much more brutish then these, ^redge^ thou will not with patience take this
Ch^redge^stisement at the hand of thy God, who do^redge^ more then feed thee,
even give thee wha^redge^soever thou art, or have, and (as if all t^redge^ were
too little) has promised to give t^redge^ more, even eternal happiness
hereafter.

SECT. II.
SEcondly, it will much help to the increase of thy patience, if thou will but
consider, that thy sins Si deus peccata respiciat, and iniquitatis merita,
nullum est adeo ingens supplicium quo non merito affligamur omnes, quotquot
originem nostram ex Adamo ducimus. Brent, in John c. 9.
have deserved this, and a great deal more at the hands of God; Yea Hell fire
it self, if God should have dealt with thee in his justice. For if every See
M. Down. Warfare part 3. l. 2. c. 18. Sect. 12
Malefactor quietly, and patiently suffers his lesser punishments, as
suppose whipping, or the like, when he knows he has deserved hanging, and
thankfully acknowledges the mercy of the Judge therein: Then ^ledge^ow much
more patiently, and thankfully should thou endure this thy light, and
momentany affliction, seeing that God by this freeth thee from everlasting
torments? For when thou art thus judged (says 1 Cor. 11, 32.
Saint Paul) thou art chastened of the Lord, that ^ledge^hou may not be
condemned with the world.

SECT. III.
THirdly, it will much help to the increase of thy patience, if thou will but
consider, Nec enim fortuna querenda Sola tua est; fimiles aliorum respice
casus, Mitius ista feres. Ovid. Metamorphos. l. 15.
that others of Gods Children, as ^ledge^eare unto him as thy self, have
endured the ^ledge^ike affliction before thee, and that others after ^ledge^hee
must endure the like too: It being a thing incident to all that are Heb. 12. 8.
Sons, and not Bastards in Gods account, in one degree, or other, first, or
last to be thus afflicted. Now how can that Onus est levius quod ab omnibus
portatur. See M. Down. Warfare. part 3. l. 2. c. 29. sect. 10 Mr. Burgis his
Chain of Graces. page 147.
burden bu^redge^ be easy to one, which is carried by all? I^redge^ thou
had gone alone in an uncouth way^redge^ which had not been beaten, and
tracke^redge^ by others of thy godly Brethren, thou had^redge^ had some cause
of complaint, and mighte^redge^ have been dismayed in the passage: B^redge^
there being in it the prints of so man^redge^ footsteps of Gods dearest
Children, whic^redge^ have gone before thee, and thou having ^redge^ Patienter
ab uno sustinendum quod multis accidit. Bern. de modo vivendi cap. 42.
many to accompany thee now, and t^redge^ follow thee hereafter, why should it
be ^redge^ so tedious, so irksome unto thee to go i^redge^ that way?

SECT. IV.
BUt, Fourthly, it will much more help^redge^ to increase thy patience, if thou will b^redge^ consider, that See Master Boltons instruct. ubi supra page 527.
others of Gods Saints, ha^redge^ endured not only the like, but a far
great^redge^ measure of affliction in this kind, then th^redge^ have endured:
As Job 6. 4. and 9. 17, 18. and 13. 24. 26. and 16. 9. and 19. 11.
Job, Psalm. 6. 3. 6. and 38. 2, 3. and 88. 7. 14, 15, 16. and 77. 7, 8, 9, 10.
David, and su^redge^ other Saints of God. I confess it is a fau^redge^ too
general, and common for men in th^redge^ case, falsely to complain, that
their bu^redge^ then of affliction is heavier then other me^redge^ But I make
no question, but if See Master Downam, ubi supra. Babing. in orat. Domin. in
fol. page 130. Burtons Melanchol. p. 255.
all the faithful, that either are, or have been thus afflicted, should agree
together to cast all their Crosses, and miseries in this kind into one common
heap, to the end that there might out of the whole be an equal part shared to
every one; that the most of those who came thither whining, and complaining,
would rather take again their own burden which they brought, and go their
way, then yield to have a share in that proportionable division; and that thou
amongst the rest would be one.

SECT. V.
FIfthly, it will much help to the increase of thy patience, if thou will but
consider what thy Savior Vide Chamier. Panstrat. Tom. 2. l. 5. c. 12, and 13.
M. Leeches Sermon on Heb. 12. 4. page 20. Bishop Lakes Sermons. part 2 page 145.
Christ has endured in this kind for thee. His bodily pains were many, and
great, but they were nothing in comparison of those which his Soul endured.
Neither man, nor Angel can conceive the taking, in which that heart was, which
without all outward violence, merely out of the extremity of his own passion
did send forth, through his flesh, and skin, not some faint dew, but Luke 22.
44. (...).
sweat like drops of blood trickling down to the ground. Only this much we
do believe, Bishop Hall in his passion Sermon.
that what the infinite sins, of almost infinite me^redge^ committed against an
infinite Majesty, deserved in infinite continuance, all that he i^redge^ the
short time of this his agony, and passio^redge^ sustained in his Soul for us.

And if Christ have endured so much for thee, Parva tolerabimus si recordemur
quid biberit ad patibulum, qui nos invitat ad coelum. Cassian. super Psalmos.
why should thou think it much to endure so little for him, so little
fo^redge^ thine own sins, which made him endur^redge^ so much, that was
without sin? Prior bibit medicus sanus, ut bibere non dubitaret aegretus.
August. Sermon. 18. in Mat. and in Psalm. 48.
A Patient cannot have a stronger reason to move him to take a loathed, and
suspected potion, then to see his Physician before him, content not only to
taste the medicine, bu^redge^ to drink a much stronger draught of the same kind
in a double quantity: So there cannot be a more effectual Cur ita asperum
creditur ut a Deo homo toleret flagella pro malis, si tanta Deus ab hominibus
pertulit mala pro bonis? Greg. pastor part. 1. c. 13.
motive to persuade thee to drink of this bitter C^redge^ of Christ, then to
consider that he himself, has not only begun to thee in the sam^redge^ Cup,
but has drunk a far greater draught, then he expects thou should
pledg^redge^ him, even the very dregs thereof unto th^redge^ bottom.

SECT. VI.
Sixthly, it cannot but much help to th^redge^ increase of thy patience, if thou will b^redge^ consider the ends, for which God does exercise thee under this
affliction: which (as far as we may conjecture) is one of these Vel ad
demonstrationem debitae miseriae, vel ad emendationem labilis vitae, vel ad
exercitationem necessariae patientiae temporaliter hominem detinet poena. Aug.
in Joh.
three, either for the chastisment of sin past: or for the trial of Grace
present: or for the preventing of sin to come. For which end soever it is, it
cannot be but for thine unspeakeable good.

Suppose it be for the first end, for the chastisement of some sin past, and
how can the consideration of this but make thee patient? When thou have in thy
Body a wound, or deep festered Soar, thou will voluntarily send for thy
Surgeon, and yield thy self into his hands, to be used at his discretion
for the curing of thy Body: yea thou can be content, that he shall not only
apply healing Plasters, but tormenting (...). Medicum etiam urentem and
secantem diligimus. Chrysostom. in Psalm. 148.
Corasives, and that he should search the Soar to the bottom, lance, and
sear it, yea and cut off a Member too, rather then the whole Body should be by
that means endangered: and fearing lest thou should not have courage, and
strength enough to endure these torments, thou will be content to be bound,
that so thou may not by striving, and struggling hinder him in his Courses.
And therefore if in uncertain hope to recover the health of thy Body which can
last but for a moment, and is ready presently after curing by relapse to fall
again into his old grief, or by some new accident into a worse: thou art
content to endure Videte fratres mei in istis languoribus corperis, quanta
homines tolerent, ut paucos dies victuri moriantur, and hos paucos dies
incertos, etc. August. Enarrat. in Psalm. 102.
all these miseries at the appointment of a mortal man, who often is
unfaithful, seeking more his own gain then thy health; and often unskilful,
neither truly knowing the nature of thine infirmity, nor the means how to cure
it: How much more then should thou with all alacrity, and cheerfulness
endure this thy present affliction, seeing it is used as a Medicine, and Salve
by thy heavenly Surgeon for the curing of a most dangerous Soar in thy Soul,
to wit, thy sin, which would bring thee in the end unto everlasting death?
Especially seeing thou art assured that he will by this means recover thee unto
a perfect, and never decaying health, as being one that is most faithful, and
careful over thee, and in his wisdom, and skill infinite, and all-sufficient
for the effecting o^redge^ the cure, say therefore here with that goo^redge^
Father Domine hic ure, hic seca, ut in posterum sanes.
O Lord here lance me, here sea me, that thou will be pleased hereafter ^redge^
cure me.

Secondly, suppose it be for the second en^redge^ that God does thus afflict
thee, to wit, f^redge^ 1 Pet. 1. 7. Deuteronomy. 8. 2. 2 Chronicles. 32. 31 See Master
Downams Warfare. part 3. page 387. etc.
the trial of thy graces present: and how can this but serve to increase thy
patienc^redge^ too?

Thou art content to have thy Gold trye^redge^ to know the goodness of it: thy
Diamo^redge^ tried, to know the worth of it; thine Armor tried to know the
proof of it, etc. And will thou be angry with thy God, for that he thus tries
thee? shall not he have as much command over that which is his, as thou have
over that which is thine? Yea, but thou will say, God knows me, and all that
is in me already, and therefore he needs not to make any such trial.

True; but the end of Gods trial of thee at this time, is not to better Tentat
Deus ut sciat, id est ut scire nos faciat: non ut sciat ipse, quem nil latet:
sine tentatione enim, nemo satis probatus esse potest, sive sibi ipsi, sive
alii. August. diversis locis Operum.
his own knowledge of thee, but to make thee better known, both to thy self,
and others.

As for thy self, thou art so naturally blinded with Pride, and Self-love, that
thou overweenest thy Graces, and good Parts, thinking that thou art, or have
that, which thou neither art, nor Multa videntur quae non sunt.
have. Or contrariwise thou art many times so dejected at the sight of thine

think that thou art not, or have not that, which indeed thou both art, and
have. And therefore the Lord brings thee unto this trial, that thou may
come to a true estimate of that which is in thee: and neither overweene, nor
magnify thy Gifts, and good Parts to be thereby 2 Cor. 12. 7
puffed up in ^ledge^ride through a conceit of thine own excel^ledge^ency: nor
too much vilify, and undervalue ^ledge^he Gifts and Graces which thou have
received of him, and so rob him of that glory and praise which his due unto him*

So also for others: they perhaps heretofore have either overvalued, or
undervalue^redge^ thy virtues, and good parts, and hav^redge^ through
mis-conceit either judged the^redge^ more, and better, or less, and worser,
the^redge^ indeed they have been. And therefore, tha^redge^ men may not any
longer rob Gods substantial virtues, and saving graces in thee, o^redge^ their
due esteem, and deserved comme^redge^dation, nor too highly prize those which
t^redge^ them thou make a show to have, but ha^redge^ not, he is content to
bring thee to the Touc^redge^stone, and by putting thee into this Prove. 17. 3.
Fier^redge^ furnace of tribulation to distinguish his tru^redge^ Golden gifts
from the counterfeit Copper, an^redge^ impure Dross of thy natural, and
seemin^redge^ abilities, which otherwise through men^redge^ ignorance would
never have been distinguished.

But it may be this is not the end neithe^redge^ for which God does at this
time humb^redge^ thee; but it is rather for the third, and la^redge^ end, which
is to Quandoque ei qui peccato quovis obligatus tenetur, pie immittit Dominus
amaritudines quasdam, quae mentem occupant homines, and expellunt
p^redge^niciosam dilectionem peccati. Bern. de tripl. misericord. Job 3^redge^

prevent in thee some sin^redge^ in the time to come, to which he sees
th^redge^ natural propensity too much inclining, an^redge^ into which thou art
ready to fall.

Suppose this: and how can this but serve to increase thy patience too? For if
a valiant Soldier is willing with all cheerfulness to run through a world of
miseries, rather then he would be vanquished, and led Captive by his Enemies:
and is content to bear his heavy Armor to endure hunger, thirst, heat, cold,
to spend the night in watching, and the day in fighting, that he may in the end
See M. Down. Warfare. part 3. page 433. etc.
vanquish, and put his Enemies to flight: And if the wise Patient be content
not only to suffer, but to reward his Physician, when he goes about by bitter
Pills, and loathsome Potions, by long Abstinence, and strict Diet to prevent
diseases when they are approaching: then how much more cheerfully, and
willingly should thou endure the miseries of this Spiritual Warfare against
Sin, Satan, and the other Enemies of thy Salvation, when as they serve as
means, and helps, whereby thou art enabled to vanquish these deadly Foes, and
to obtain over them so glorious a Victory? And with how much more patience
should thou at the appointment of thy Heavenly Physician take these bitter
Pills, and Potions, of inward Distress, seeing he uses them as Sovereign
preservatives to keep thee safe and sound from the contagion, and poisonous
infection of sin, and from falling into those dangerous diseases which would
bring Body, and Soul to everlasting death.

SECT. VII.
SEventhly, and lastly, it cannot but much help to the increase of thy
patience, if thou will but consider what further good this thy present
Affliction shall bring unto thee, if it be patiently endured: namely, a most
excellent, and eternal weight of 2 Cor. 4. 17.
glory: the Jam. 1. 2.
crown of life; and everlasting Job 5. 17.
blessedness in Gods Kingdom when this life is ended. Worldly men See Master
Downams Warfare. part. 3. page 561.
we know are content to endure any labor, to hazard themselves to innumerable
dangers, and to suffer many, and grievous miseries, that they may be assured of
earthly things, and yet their strongest assurances are but uncertainties, and
the best things assured but trifling vanities. The Husbandman, he is content
also to toi^redge^ and labor, and to endure much hardness in the Seed-time
for the hope of a plentifu^redge^ Harvest afterward, and yet his expectation
is often frustrated, and in the end h^redge^ has many times but his labor for
hi^redge^ pains. The Merchant also is content to compass Sea and Land, and to
run man^redge^ hard, and hazardous courses, and all t^redge^ get some little
wealth, which he is uncertain whether he shall obtain, or having obtained it,
whether he shall retain, and enjoy it one day to his comfort.

And if these Si tanta suffert anima mundana ut possideat unde pereat, quanta
debet sufferre ne pereat? August. li. de patient. c. 6.
men can be content to endure all these miseries for such temporary trifles,
which they are not sure to obtain, after all their pains and travel, nor to
retain them for one day, though they should have them in possession. Then how
much more should thou be content to endure this thy present misery, seeing
this gives unto thee (if thou take it patiently) most certain assurances of
such riches, as being unvaluable, and unconceaveable, and are also out of all
danger of coming by an accident, to end, or loss, I mean the everlasting
possession of God himself, and his everlasting Kingdom. And thus far of
those things which are fitting for thee to know for the better increase of thy
patience in the time of Spiritual Distress.

Now follow those things which are fit for thee to know, for the better
furthering of thy comfort.

And because Gods Children thus distressed seldom find any ease, or comfort,
till their own very particular Distress be touched, and they be comforted in
respect of that: therefore for the better furthering of thy comfort in this
kind, I will here set down the particular Distresses, which (out of mine own
experience) I have found, and (out of other men's observation) I have learned,
to be the most usual Distresses of Gods Children at this time; together with
the particular Comforts, that may serve to comfort them in respect of any such
particular Distresses, applying every one of them to thee in particular, that
so whatsoever thy Distress may be, thou may find comfort accordingly.

SECT. VIII.
TOuching these then, this I would have thee to know: That there are three
sorts of Distresses, which above all others, do most perplex, and trouble the
minds, and Consciences of Gods Children exercised in this Spiritual conflict.

The first are such as respect the time past; the second are such as respect
the time present; and the third are such as respect the time to come.

Those that respect the time past, are either such as are occasioned by former
Distresses; or such as are occasioned by former Sins.

The former Distresses which occasion present Distress to the Children of God,
are either such as they have escaped, or such as they have endured.

SECT. IX.
TOuching the former, the Distress is The Distress.
this. I have ever heretofore (says the Child of God) taken my self for one
that has been Regenerate, and one whom God has effectually called, and
converted: but alas, now I see there is no such matter, for I have never been
hitherunto See Master Bolton, ubi supra. page 443.
troubled in mind, or distressed in Conscience with the fear, or feeling of
Gods wrath due unto me for my sins, as Gods Children use to be at their
conversion. And therefore woe is me, sure I am still in Satan's possession, and
that Luke 11. 21.

be thus still in peace within me.

If this be thy case, know this for thy The Comforts.
comfort. 1. Howsoever it be most true, that there can be no new See Dyke of
Repentance. cap. 5. Boltons Instructions, ubi supra. page 469. Mr. Schudders
Christians daily walk. page 626.
Birth without some terrors of the Law, and straits of Conscience going before
it; as there can be no Birth without some pains going before that: yet God
handles not all alike, that are thus regenerated, and made partakers of the
new Birth, but some have gentler fits by odds, then others have; some being
but sprinkled only in this Mat. 20. 22.
Baptism, whereas others are even dowsed over head and ears; and some but
only made to sip of that Cup, whereof others drink to the very dregs. It is
with the travel of a Sinner in his Conversion, just as it is with the travel
of a woman in Childbirth: Vide Lorin. in Psalm. Tom. 1. page 783. a.
None travells here without pain, ye^ledge^ some are like those Exodus 1. 19
Hebrew women, which have a quicker, and easier dispatch, then others have.
Those converts, Acts 2. in their Conversion had some grudgings, and Act. 2. 37.
(...). pungendo penetro.
pricks of Conscience, but yet they had none of Jobs, or David's fits, which
held them many days together: for the same Verse 38.
Peter that wounded them, presently healed them.

And herein God applies himself for the most part to the several natures, and
conditions, and dispositions of his Children. Amongst which some have been more
heinous Sinners, and of longer standing then the rest, and the more festered,
and dangerous the wound is, the sharper must be the cure; and the more viscous,
and gluttonous the Humor is, the stronger must be the Purge. Whereas others
perhaps are not, either so great Sinners, or of so long standing as the rest;
and therefore gentler, and easier Remedies will serve for them: For some soars
(we know) will as easily be let out with the pricking of a pin, as others
with the Chyrurgions launcing. And this perhaps is thy case. Thou art one, who
in thy tender years, by means of Religious mourture, have been seasoned with
the Grace of God, dropping by little and little into thee, and hereby have been
kept from the grosser defilements of Actual transgressions, wherein others
have voluntarily wallowed, and therefore no marvel, if thou have not beheld
that grimme, and severe countenance of the Law, with so quick an apprehension,
as those use to do who have been of so long standing in the ways of
wickedness, and have so long pursued it with such eager delight.

2. It may be this thy Religious education has taught thee as well to practice
daily repentance after thou have sinned, as to watch carefully over thine heart
that thou may not sin; and so thou escapest that by a daily practice, which
others but once practicing in all their lives, do feel, and smart for. The
house that is daily swept has but little dust in it, and is easily made
clean, but if it lie long unswept, then it asks much scraping, rubbing, and
washing, and all is little enough to get up the dirt that by continual use is
grown hard to the floor. So in casting up of Accounts, he that casts them
up every day, shall the easier cast them up at the Weeks end: b^ledge^ he that
lets them alone to run on from D^ledge^ to Day, from Week to Week, shall find
them so perplexed and intricate in the en^ledge^ that much pains taking will
hardly s^redge^ them right.

And why may not this be thy case? tho^redge^ may have done that by little,
and little, an^redge^ daily, which others do but once, and the^redge^ all
together. And this may be the caus^redge^ that thy fits have been so easy, and
scarc^redge^ discernable, theirs so harsh, and so notorious.

3. And lastly, it may be God has reserved the evidences of thy New Birth to
this very time, and will have thee by thes^redge^ after-throwes to be assured
of that, of which thou had but small assurance in the forme^ledge^ time of
thy travel. If it be but so, thank Go^redge^ for it with all thine heart, for
the assurance of Regeneration is a blessing worthy the receiving, worthy the
acknowledging whenever it comes.

SECT. X.
THe second kind of former Distresses, which usually cause present Distress to
the Children of God, are such as they have endured. And from these there
arises this Distress.

Oh (says the Child of God) many, and The Distress.
^ledge^reat have been the Distresses, which hi^ledge^herunto I have endured,
and I had well ^ledge^oped, that in them all I had suffered as a Child of God,
and not as an Alien: but ^ledge^ow I perceive there is no such matter;
^ledge^or Gods Children usually profit by their Distresses, and are bettered,
and amended ^ledge^y them, but in me there is no such amendment to be seen, no
reformation to be ^ledge^eard of: nay, contrary-wise this I find in my self,
that when the hand of God is thus ^ledge^pon me, I rather grow worse, and
worse, ^ledge^ewraying more impatiency, and uttering more inconsiderate
speeches, which tend ^ledge^o Gods dishonor, give offense to others, ^ledge^nd
wound mine own Conscience, then ^ledge^eretofore I have done. And therefore,
howsoever in such Distresses, others may have suffered as the Children of God,
and to them these their Distresses may have been Testimonies, and Assurances
of Gods love: yet I cannot but think that I have suffered in all these
Distresses of mine, rather as an Alien, then as the Child of God, and that to
me these my Distresses have been rather Testimonies of Gods hatred, and heavy
displeasure, then any way assurances of his love.

If this be thy case, know this for thy The Comforts.
Comfort. 1. That this very particular case of thine, was Job 3. 3. etc. and 6.
8, 9, 10.
Jobs case, Psalm. 88. 14. and 77. 8, 9. and 32. 3, 4. and 38. 8. 10.
David's case Jer. 20. 14, 15, 18.
Jeremies case, Jonah 4. 3. 8, 9.
Jonahs case, and y^redge^ all these were the dear Children of Go^redge^
notwithstanding: and therefore why ma^redge^ not thou be so too,
notwithstanding tho^redge^ can not for the present perceive in th^redge^ self
any amendment, or any reformatio^redge^ to arise from thy former Distresses?

2. Thou should also know, and consider, that there is no time so unfitting
fo^redge^ a man to judge of his Spiritual strength^redge^ and state of Grace
in, as is the time ^redge^ Temptation, and Spiritual conflict. If a ma^redge^
should come unto thee after thou have endured much, and tedious sickness,
an^redge^ should say unto thee, thou did imagin^redge^ thy self a while ago
very beautiful, an^redge^ exceeding strong, but wast much deceived for if thou will but look in a Glass, tho^redge^ shall presently perceive that thou art
lean^redge^ pale, and deformed, and if thou will bu^redge^ make trial of thy
strength, that it is scarc^redge^ sufficient to sustain the weight of thine
ow^redge^ body. I say, if a man should thus come unto thee, and reason with
thee after this manner: I make no question, but thou would deride such fond
reasoning, as knowing that judgment is not to be taken of the Beauty, and
strength of the Body in the time of Sickness, but in the time of health. And
is not thy case here the like? Thou say, that thou hopedst, that in all
^ledge^hy former Afflictions, thou had suffered ^ledge^s a Child of God, and
not as an Alien: but ^ledge^ow thou perceivest there is no such mat^ledge^er,
for thou have not profited by these thine Afflictions, as Gods Children use to
do.

Is there any reason that thou should thus judge of the grace and strength of
thy Soul, in the time of this thy Spiritual sickness, when as thou will not
judge of the beauty, and strength? of thy Body in the time of thy Bodily
sickness? Surely there ^ledge^s as little reason for the one, as for the other.

3. Thou should also know, and consider, that as there is no time so
unfitting for a man to judge of his Spiritual strength, and state of Grace in,
as is the time of Temptation, and Spiritual conflict: So in that time, none is
so unfit to judge of himself, as is the party himself, that is thus tempted.
For though at other times men are commonly sick of self-love, and are too
partial in their own case, yet in this estate, and at this time they are most
Festucam quaerunt, unde ocutum sibi cruant. Bern. de bon. deser.
uncharitable to themselves of all other men. At other times they can be
content to extenuate their ill Deeds, and to magnify their good, stretching
them to the utmost rack that self-conceit, or vain applause can minister. Yet
at this time how witty, and even Rhetorical are they to extenuate ^redge^ that
is good in them, and to As if they had been hired by Satan, the accuser of the
Brethren, to plead for him in accusing themselves. Doctor Sibbes bruised Reed.

aggravate b^redge^yond measure, that which is evil, and s^redge^full? And
therefore why should th^redge^ thus credulously believe thine own
judg^redge^ment at this time touching thy self, w^redge^ art not now a
competent judge either of t^redge^ self, or others?

In point of Law, and Equity, if th^redge^ find not thy judge Competent,
thou w^redge^ soon appeal to another that is more Co^redge^petent: and why will thou not do t^redge^ like at this time? A more uncompete^redge^ judge then thy
self, thou can not me^redge^ with possibly at this time, of thy self:
an^redge^ therefore appeal from thy self at this tim^redge^ unto thy God, who
is a more compete^redge^ Judge, and does see, and discover more ^redge^ his
Children many times then either themselves, or others can discover in them.
^redge^ say, appeal unto him, and in the defect o^redge^ thine own knowledge,
comfort thy self in Gods. So did Hezekiah in that hi^redge^ grievous trial. O
Lord (says Esaias 38. 3.
he) th^redge^ know that I have walked with a perfe^redge^ heart before
thee. And so did John 21. 15, 16, 17.
Peter in th^redge^ strict examination that Christ took of hi^redge^ concerning
his Love. Simon, Love th^redge^ me? says Christ. For herein, though
hi^redge^ own Conscience told him that he was faulty, as having so often denied
Christ before, yet he notwithstanding comforts himself with this meditation of
Gods knowledge; and when he could not say, Lord, I do love thee, he says
thus, and therein he rests contented: Lord (says he) thou which know all
things, thou know that I love thee. And no marvel, for they were sure that
God, who sees all things, both could, and would take notice of that in them;
which, for the smallness, and littleness of it, they could not take notice of
it themselves: it being See B. Andrews Sermons. part 1. page 621. Doctor Sibs
his Bruised Reed. page 58. etc. M. Schudders Christians daily Walk. p. 583. Mr.
Perkins Works. vol. 1. page 638. Col. 2. c. and ibid. page 639. Col. 2. b.
his use (at such times especially) if there be but a sigh, a good thought, a
holy desire in the midst of a great deal of Ignorance, and perturbation, not to
let that pass unseene, unregarded, unrewarded.

And thus far touching former Distresses occasioning present Distress in the
Child of God. Now follow Distresses arising from former sins.

SECT. XI.
ANd these former sins which occasion present Distresses in the Child of God,
are either such as he knows he has committed, or such as he fears he has
committed.

And for the former of these, he is especially The Distresses.
troubled, either for that he thinket^redge^ them so many; or for that he
thinket^redge^ them so great; or for that he has contin^redge^ed so long in
them without Repentance, ^redge^ for that he has so often fallen back
agai^redge^ into them after Repentance.

If the first of these be thy case, that tho^redge^ The first Distress.
art troubled for the multitude of thy Sin^redge^ and because they have been so
many ^redge^ know this for thy Comfort. The Comforts.


1. That though thy Sins be many, y^redge^ Gods He is the God of Mercies,
Neh. 9. 1. the Father of Mercies, 2 Cor. 1. 3. He has a multitude of Mercies,
Psalm. 51. 1. Yea, he is full of Mercy, Psalm. 103. 8. Our Sins be the sins
of Men, b^redge^ his Mercy is the mercy of an infinite God. Doctor Sibs
Bruis^redge^ Reed, Preface to the Reader.
mercies are more; for his mercy i^redge^ like himself, infinite, whereas thy
sinne^redge^ (were they never so many) can be b^redge^ finite. Now betwixt
finite, and infini^redge^ (we know) there can be no proportio^redge^ and so no
possibility of resistance: ar^redge^ therefore even many sins may be pardoned
as well as few.

2. Know this also, that many sinn^redge^ have been pardoned too: Why else
di^redge^ Christ say of Mary Magdalen, That ma^redge^ sins were forgiven her?
Luke 7. 47.

3. Know this too, that even thy sinne^redge^ Si quis universa peccata mundi
commisisset, and doleret, etc. Deus talem nunqua^ damnaret. de quinque partit.
Cons. lib. 3. cap. 44.
how many soever they have been, a^redge^ also pardoned, and shall never be
impute^redge^ unto thee for Condemnation, Romans 8. 1.
if tho^redge^ have truly Esaias 55. 7.
repented thee of them, an^redge^ do resolve to cast thy self wholly upon
Math. 11. 28. Galat. 2. 20.

infinite mercies in him for the pardon of them.

But perhaps this is not thy case, thou art not so much troubled at the
multitude and number of thy sins, as at the greatness and heinousness of
them. And if this be thy The Comforts.
case, know this for thy comfort.

1. That no Esaias 1. 16, 17, 18.
sin is capable of repentance, but the same is also capable of pardon. Even
the very Math. 12. 31. compared with Heb. 6. 6. and 1 Epist. Joh. 5. 16.
sin against the Holy Ghost should be forgiven, if it could be repented for.

2. That even the greatest sinners upon their true repentance, have been See
Dr. Biams Sermon. on Rev. 2. 5. p. 67.
forgiven: Witness, Adam, Manasses, and the Jews that crucified Christ, who
committed ^ledge^he most transcendent sins that ever were committed by any
that we read of in Scripture, who were afterward saved.

As for See M. Perkins works in fol. vol. 1. p. 19. col. 2. 6. and M. Hierons
works in fol. vol. 2. page 147.
Adams sin, we know, it cast ^ledge^oth himself, and all mankind, from the
Creation, to the Worlds end, into Romans 5. 12. 1 Cor. 15. 2^. Ephesians. 2. 3.
a ^ledge^amnable estate, and also empoysoned with ^ledge^he contagion of
Original Corruption, the ^ledge^odies and souls of all that ever were, or
^ledge^hall be borne of woman, the Heb. 4. 15.
Lord Je^ledge^us only excepted. And yet this man (as the Via^ Mol. in Psalm.
77.
best Divines be of opinion) though ^ledge^e had thus cast away himself, and
undone ^ledge^ll mankind, was received to mercy.

Secondly, for See 2 King. 21. 16. 2 Chronicles. 33. 2. etc.
Manasses, he also was a man of most prodigious impiety, and matchless
villainy; he shed innocent blood very much, till he had filled Jerusalem from
one end to another: He did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, like
unto the abominations of the Heathen, whom the Lord had cast out before the
Children of Israel. He caused his Children to pass through the fire, i^redge^
the valley of the Son of Hinnom. Also, He observed times, and used
enchantments, and used witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar spirit, and with
wizards. He wrought much evil in the sight of the Lord, to anger him, etc. And
yet this great sinner, humbling himself greatly before the God of his Fathers,
was received to 2 Chronicles. 33. 12, 13.
mercy.

Thirdly, for those which crucified See M. Smiths Munition against man's
misery, page 107.
Christ; a man would have thought, that if ever Gods justice should have
triumphed ^redge^ver his mercy, and have denied mercy unto any, it should have
been to these: What^redge^ To Acts 3. 13, 14, 15.
Crucify the Son of God, the Lord ^redge^ life! Him, who (if any) was to be
the Savior and Redeemer of them, and all mankind! To crucify him (I say) and
to expose him to such shame and sorrow as they did! Could there be imagined a
greate^redge^ sin? And yet behold upon their true repentance, Saint Acts 3.
19.
Peter does even promise them, that their sins also shall be put away
pardoned and forgiven.

3. Know this also for thy comfort, that what mercy God has showed to these,
he both can and will show to thee, if thou shall truly repent thee of thy
sins, as these did. For he is the same God, and Father of mercies, that ever
he was; and has the same mercies Exodus 20. 6. and 34. 7. Numerus finitus pro
infinito. Beumler. Rhetor. l. 2. c. 14.
for thousand of others, as well as for these: And the more to comfort thee
remember, that these are of Romans 15. 4.
purpose Registered in the Scriptures, that thou, and all true penitent souls,
might confirm their hope in the like assurance of mercy thereby; God showing 1 Timothy 1. 16.
in these, what all may expect upon the like conditions.

But it may be this is not thy case neither The third Distress.
thou art not so much troubled and distressed, because thy sins are so many,
and so great, as for that thou have continued so long in them without
Repentance.

If this be thy case, know this for thy The Comfort.
Comfort, That the longest See M. Smiths Munition against man's misery, page
85. etc.
continuance in sin is no way prejudicial to his salvation, to whom God at
the last vouchsafes the Grace of true Repentance. He that came into the Math.

misericordiae, undecimae horae ope^ledge^rii consequentur. Hilar. in Psalm. 129.
Vineyard to work at the eleventh hour, had his penny at night, as well as he
that came at the first. And who knows not that the penitent Luke 23. 43.
Thief, repenting at the last gasp, was promised by Christ a place in
Paradise?

And therefore if thou have 1 Pet. 4. 1, 2, 3.
spent never so much time of thy life past in sin, and can now assure thy
self, that thou do truly and unfeignedly repent thee of this thy sinful
course of life past, and art desirous to Ephesians. 5. 16.
redeem the time, that is yet left thee, to consecrate it, to more Romans 6. 18,

holy, and sanctified courses; thou have no great cause to be dismayed for thy
former long continuance in sin: for though late Repentance be Legi and

Aug. tom. 10. de verae poenit. hom. 41. B. B. Winchest. Sermon. page 180.
seldom true, yet true Repentance is never too late.

But perhaps this is not thy case neither; go on then to the fourth and last:
What Art thou troubled because rhou have so ofte^redge^ fallen back again
into the same sins after Repentance?

If this be thy case, know this also for thy Comfort.

1. That even the dear See M. Downhams Divinity. p. 500. M. Pemble of the
Sacrament, page 53. M. Smiths Munition against man's misery, page 90. etc.
Child of Go^redge^ may fall again and again into the same si^redge^ after
Repentance: for what should hinde^redge^

First, the same imbred Corruption (thoug^redge^ not in the same measure, and
power) remains in the best of Gods Children afte^redge^ Regeneration, that
was in them before and is as ready again, to yield to Sata^redge^ temptations
for the committing of t^redge^ same sins, if God should leave them t^redge^
themselves, as ever it was at the first. S^redge^ that in respect of
themselves, and their i^redge^ bred Corruption, they may fall into the same
sins again into which they have formerly fallen.

Secondly, there is the same Devil to tempt; and seeing his desire is to make
us beyond measure sinful; and knowing there is no way better to do it, then
by implunging us often into the same sins; and especially into those, whereof
we have Luke 11. 24, 25, 26.
made show and profession to have repented: how can we but think that he will
be as busy to tempt us (if God permit him) to the same sins, as well (if not
more) then to any other?

Thirdly, the same causes still remain, which may move the Lord to leave them
to themselves, and suffer them to fall again into sin, yea the same sins as
he did before: Namely, that hereby they may be the more humbled, and more
seriously bewail their corruption; that they may the more earnestly implore
his mercy, and he the more manifest it in pardoning their sins, to the praise
of his Glory.

2. Thou should also know, and consider, See M. Smiths Munition against man's
misery, page 90. etc.
that the promise of pardon in the Scriptures, is not made only to diverse sins
once committed, but is extended to the same sins committed diverse times
Peccasti? poenitere. Millies peccasti? Millies poenitere. Millies poenitet?
Adhuc etiam poenitere. Chrysostom. Vide Lorin. in Psalm. tom. 1. page 844. Heming.
in Joh. 8. col. 509. etc.
Yea, to all sins whatsoever, whereof we truly repent. And therefore though
thou have fallen again into the same sins after Repentance, yet this may be
thy comfort, that none of all these thy sins shall be able, either to exclude
thee out of the number of Gods children, or debar thee of his pardon, if thou
can as duly, and as truly repent thee of them, and ask God forgiveness
for them, as thou do daily commit them.

3. And lastly, thou should also remember and call to mind (as See M.
Boltons Instruct. ubi supra, page 346.
others of Gods children have done in the like case) what mercy in this kind
God requires of man, and he would have him to show to his offending Brother;
for he would have him to forgive him, although he commit the same offenses
often against him, if he come and acknowledge his fault, and be sorry for it:
And shall not he himself, upon our true repentance, then (think we) forgive
us, although after the same manner we do offend him?

For what? Shall he practice less mercy toward us, then he requires that we
should practice one toward another?

Our mercy is but a spark of his, infused into us by his Spirit; and shall a
spark do more then the whole fire? Shall there be more in the stream, then
in the fountain* More in the river, then in the maine s^redge^ No, no, it
cannot be. Far be it then from thee to despair of Gods mercy toward thee in
that, wherein (by Gods own appointment) man may not despair of mercy from his
offended Brother.

SECT. XII.
THe second kind of former sins, which do occasion present distress in the
child of God, are such as he fears he has committed. And here I have
observed the fear of two sins especially to have occasioned distress to the
child of God. The first is a fear lest he have any way, or at any time in his
extremity, and through the violence of temptation, yielded his consent to
Satan, in that fearful temptation of giving himself body and soul to him.
And the second is a fear lest he have committed that great and unpardonable
sin against the Holy Ghost.

If the former be thy case, know this for thy comfort,

First, that Satan (who tells thee that in this particular thou have yielded
thy consent unto him) is a Liar, and such a Liar, Joh. 8. 44.
as in whom there is no truth; and that therefore thou have little reason to
give credit to that which he says.

In other businesses, if thou had to do with one that is a common Liar, and
such a one as thou know does seldom or never speak truth, thou would be
well advised, before thou would give any great credit to him, or his words;
yea, though he should not only say, but swear it were true: And therefore how
much more should thou be well advised, before thou give credit to Satan in
this particular, who can speak truth in none, unless it be to gain further
credit to his lies in some other thing.

But Secondly, suppose this, that Satan now seeks to affright thee with, were
true; yet even herein are there some things which thou may know, and take
notice of for thy comfort notwithstanding.

As 1. that it is one thing, which Satan in thine extremity, has (through the
violence of his temptations) enforced thee to do ^redge^ say; and another
thing, which thou would do: or say, of thine own accord, being out of that
extremity. Now whatsoever thing, in this case, Satan does, through the violence
of Temptation, enforce thee to do or say, rest thou assured of it; it is See
M. Abernethies physic for the soul, page 144. M. Boltons Instruct. ubi supra,
page 535, 539.
his sin, and not thine; and that he shall answer to God for it, and not thou.

Again, 2. know this, that it is one thing to give that which is a man's own,
and which he may freely dispose of; and another thing to give that which is
another man's, and to which he has no right: If herein thou had given Satan
that which had been thine own, and of which thou might freely have
disposed, then surely thou had had just cause of fear: But here the case is
otherways; for if thou have thus given thy self, body and soul, to Satan,
(as thou art afraid thou have done) thou have herein given that, which is none
of thine to give, and which thou have no power to make good. For thou must
know, that since thy Redemption, thou art 1 Cor. 3. 23.
Christ's, and not thine 1 Cor. 6. 19.
own; and therefore it is not in thy power to make good this thy gift, but in
Christ's; and Christ has promised, that he for his part will never make it
good; for he has said it, and we may believe it, that Mat. 16. 18.
Hell gates shall never prevail against those that are his; and that those
whom God his Father has given unto him, Joh. 17. 12.
he will keep; not suffering Satan, or any Joh. 10. 28. Romans 8. 35, 38, 39.
other, either by force, or fraud, to deprive him of them.

3. And lastly, know this also, that even in this case too, thy true, and sound
Repentance, can take off all Satan's right, title, and interest, which by this,
or any other means, he may pretend to have in thee; and the blood of Christ
apprehended and applied to thy soul by a lively faith, can cancel any Col. 2.
13, 14. Heb. 2. 14, 15. See sick Souls presidents hereafter, page 7. The
Distress.

ow^redge^ blood.

comfort,

no Nullum est peccatum quod fecit homo, quod non possit facere alter homo, si

other wickedness so odious, or abominable but even the dear child of God
(being le^redge^ to himself) may fall into it: But into thi^redge^ he cannot
possibly fall. And this 1 Ep. Joh. 5. 18.
Sain^redge^ John assures Gods children of, We know (says he) that he that is

Hierome. Athanasius. Chrysostom. Basil. Ambrose, etc. Beda. Huge. Glossa
ordinaria, etc.
best Expositors generally both Ancient and Modern, do with o^redge^ consent
affirm.

2. Know this also, that not every grievous sin against knowledge and
conscience, is this great and unpardonable sin against the Holy Ghost; for
even thus David offended, 2 Samuel 11. 4.
who was 1 Samuel 13, 14
a man after Gods own heart. Neither is it every denying of the known truth,
if it proceed from fear a^redge^ infirmity, and not of malice and obstinate
rebellion; for thus Mat. 26. 70.
Peter sinned in denying his Master. Neither is it all kind of opposing and
persecuting the truth, if it be not against knowledge and conscience, but upon
blindness and ignorance: For thus Acts 22. 4. and 26. 11. and 1 Timothy 1. 13.
Paul offended before his conversion, and many of the Jews Acts 3. 17.
who crucified Christ. Neither is it all malicious opposing against every
known truth set down in the Scriptures, but only against Christ Heb. 10. 29.
and 6. 6.
, and salvation by him, our hearts having been first Heb. 6. 4.
enlightened by the Heming. in Johan. c. 3. col. 230. b.

with impenitiblenesse in the way, and with actual impenitency in the end.

And therefore though thou have at any time sinned against knowledge and
conscience through infirmity, and not of malice; though thou have denied the
truth, through fear and weakness; though thou have also persecuted it,
through blindness and ignorance; yea, though thou have wittingly opposed, and
willingly persecuted any truth, but only that, that concerns Nemo peccat in

upon thy true Repentance for it from pardon and forgiveness He that desires
further satisfaction touching this sin, let him read, M. Willia^redge^

3. And lastly, know this also, and remember it for thy comfort, See M.
Schudder Daily Walk page 527. Abernethy physic for the soul, page 144. D.
Denison, ubi supra, page 59.
That so long as a man would not commit this sin, or fears that he has
committed it, or grieveth because he has committed it, he is most free from
committing of it. For this sin is not committed of infirmity, or unawares,
but upon a malicious will, clear knowledge, and settled resolution; and they
that have committed it, have neither fear nor contrition of heart for so
sinning; final^redge^ impenitency being the inseparable companion, and
attendant of it. And therefore this being not thy case, thou have no cause thus
to be dis-comforted, whatsoever Satan, or thine own conscience, shall tell
thee to the contrary.

And thus far touching those distresses of Gods children which respect the
time past: Now follow those which respect the ti^redge^ present.

SECT. XIII.
ANd these arise commonly either from a conceited want of love in God, or from
a conceited want of grace in themselves.

Touching the former, there are diverse things which make the children of God to
think that God does not love them.

1. Consciousnesse of self-unworthinesse. 2. Spiritual desertion. 3.
Satanicall molestation. 4. Want of audience in prayer. 5. Outward and inward
afflictions. 6. Long continuance under the cross.
If the first of these be the cause of thy The Distress.
present distress, and thou think that God does not love thee, because thou
art in thy self so unworthy of any love from him: then know this for thy
comfort,

1. That Gods love toward his children The Comforts
is not grounded upon their worthiness, but upon his See M. Ed. Reynolds Sermon.
on Phil. 3. 10. page 510.
own mere mercy, and free good will. And this may evidently appear throughout
the whole work of our salvation, and in every act thereof: For our Romans 11. 5.
election, Ephesians. 1. 7.
redemption, 2 Timothy 1. 9.
vocation, Romans 3. 24.
justification, Tit. 2. 11.
sanctification, Ephesians. 2. 8.
salvation, are all of his mere See M. Hierons works, vol. 1. page 104. and
121.
grace and mercy, without any desert of ours.

And therefore resolve thus with th^redge^ self, and let this resolution
afford the^redge^ comfort in thy deepest distress, for wa^redge^ of merit, or
worthiness in thy self. Th^redge^ thy Meritum meum miserationes Domini non
sum plane meriti inops, quamdiu ille miserationum non fuerit. Bern. in Cant.
Sermon. 61.
merit is the Lords mercy; and th^redge^ therefore so long as he wants not
mercy thou shall never want merit.

2. Thou should also know and consider this for thy comfort, that there is
n^redge^ Math. 8. 8. Math. 15. 27, 28.
unworthiness felt, grieved for, and labored against, but is accounted
worthiness^redge^ in the sight of God.

3. Take notice also of this, that thoug^redge^ in thy self thou art, and
do find thy self^redge^ most unworthy; yet as long as God is pleased, in
Christ, to account thee worthy, tho^redge^ art There is, Dignitas ex
dignatione, as well as, ex dignitate.
worthy enough: for it is not wha^redge^ thou accountest thy self, but what
Go^redge^ does account thee to be, Ephesians. 1. 6.
in his So^redge^ Jesus Christ, that shall make thee to stan^redge^ or fall
before his Judgment seat. An^redge^ therefore let not thy unworthiness
dishearten thee, and make thee believe th^redge^ God does not love thee; but
rather fro^redge^ this assure thy self that he does love thee because he makes
thee to acknowledge ^redge^ self every way so unworthy of his love.

SECT. XIV.
ANother occasion of present distress in the child of God, is spiritual
desertion: Oh (says the child of God) there The Distress.
was a time when I thought my self highly beloved, and favored of God (such
comfortable assurances of his gracious presence had I always in my self) but
now Vide Casm. Tent. Schol. 2. c. 2. p. 51, and 56. See M. Jos. Symonds case
and cure of a deserted soul, per totum. M. Rob: Yarrowes Sovereign comforts.
The Comforts.
a^ledge^as that joy of my salvation is gone, I feel no such comfortable
assurances of Gods gracious presence in me; nay, to my present seeming, I am as
one quite forsaken of God, one wholly bereft of his Spirit; and therefore I
fear I was never indeed belo^ledge^ed of him, as I took my self to be.

If this be thy case, know this for thy comfort,

1. That God never Non deserit etiamsi deserere videatur: Imo non deserit
etiamsi deserat. August.
withdraws his ^ledge^resence, and favor from his child indeed, ^ledge^o
whom he has once vouchsafed it, ^ledge^hough in the present feeling, and
appre^ledge^ension of his child, he seems to with^ledge^raw it. For See M.
Boltons Instruct: ubi supra. p. 512.
God is not fickle and inconstant in his love, to love a man to day, ^ledge^nd
to cast him off to morrow; no, there ^ledge^here is no such Jam. 1. 17.
variableness nor shadow ^ledge^f change in him; but whom he Joh. 13. 1.
Jerem. 31. 3.
loves ^ledge^nce, he loves unto the end.

2. Thou should also know, and consider the Sea M Gatakers Sermon. on Psalm. 13.
1. M. Boltons Instruct. ubi supra. page 508. etc.
ends, for which God dot^redge^ seem thus to withdraw his presence an^redge^
wonted favor from his child; all which thou shall find to be for the Ne
timeas ^ sponsa, nec existimes te contemni, si paulisper tibi sponsus subtrahit
faciem suam: omnia ista tibi cooperantur in bonum de accessu, and recessu

good, and not one for the hurt of him.

One is for the chastisement of sins past* whereof he has not yet truly
repented* Thus did God withdraw his gracious presence and wonted favor from
Psalm. 51, 11, 12. and 77. 7, 8. Vide Moller. in loc.
Davi^redge^ and yet all was in love, and out of Gods fatherly care over him,
lest he should perish in his sins of adultery and murder, and those other
(which either occasioned, o^redge^ were occasioned by them) through imperitency.

A second end is, for the better trial of h^redge^ estate present: Not that
God is ignorant what is in man, but because he would by this bring man the
better to know what i^redge^ in himself, and make others also to acknowledge
it, which otherways would no^redge^ have believed it: For this end did
Go^redge^ withdraw his gracious presence, and wonted assistance from Peter, and
for the same end also from Job; yet from bot^redge^ out of his love, and
fatherly care over the^redge^ From Math. 26. 75.
Peter, that by this means h^redge^ might be brought to the sight of his own
frailty, which otherways would have perished in his presumption. And from
J^redge^ that by this means his sincerity might b^redge^ justified against the
mercenarinesse of well doing, with which he stood charged by Satan. Job. 1. 9.


A third end of Gods withdrawing of his presence, and wonted favor from his
child, is for the preventing of some sin in him in the time to come. And thus
did God withdraw the sense of his presence and favor from Paul, yet out of his
love and fatherly 2 Cor. 12. 7. There is preventing physic for preservation of
health, as well as that when the disease is dangerously upon us for recovery.
Boltons Instruct. ubi supra. page 460.
care over him still, that hereby he might the better prevent that spiritual
pride in him, into which he was likely to fall through abundance of Revelations.

A fourth end of Gods withdrawing of his presence, and wonted favor from his
child, may be to stir Recedit, ut absens magis desideretur: desideratus
avidius quaeratur, diu quaesitus tandem gratius inveniatur. Aug. five Bern. ubi
supra. Sic enim pios interdum judicio Dei terreri necesse est, ut bonitatis
ejus defiderio magis officiamur. Calvin in Esaias 38. 13, 14.
him up the more earnestly to desire it, and the more highly to prize it, and
the more thankfully to use it.

For how many, by this means, have ^ledge^eene brought to a higher estimation
of Gods favorable presence, then otherways they would have been? What
earnest suits and prayers for the regaining of this, has this desertion caused
in some? Yea, what ^ledge^hankfull acceptance, and gracious use of this, once
regained, has it caused in all? And is not all this for the good of Gods child?

Lastly, it may be the Lord does some^ledge^imes thus withdraw his presence,
and won^ledge^ed favor from his child, to make him the more earnestly to long
after the full perfection, and perfect enjoyment of it in Heaven Via est vita
praesens qua ad patriam tendimus, and idcirco hic occulto Dei judicio,
frequenti perturbatione conterimur, ne viam pro patria diligamus. Greg. Moral.
l. 23. cap. 15.
. For if the Lord should alike at all times afford us his gracious presence,
and favor here, how ready would we be to set down ou^redge^ rest here, and to
grow careless of minding any better estate hereafter? And therefor^redge^ that
we may not take the place of our banishment, for our Ne exilium deputemus pro
patria, and arrham pro pretii summa venit sponsus, and recedit vicissim, nunc

Country; and the earnest of our inheritance, for the full payment; the Lord
comes, and departs from ^redge^ by course; sometimes ministering
comfo^redge^ by his presence; at other times greatest discomfort by his
absence; by the taste of t^redge^ one, to teach us what is reserved for us
i^redge^ Heaven; and by the touch of the other, t^redge^ let us know what may
not be expected by ^redge^ here on earth.

But howsoever the Lord for these, or other causes best known to himself, does
see^redge^ thus to forsake his child for a while: yet t^redge^ may be his
comfort, that he will never fo^redge^sake him Esaias 49. 14, 15, 16. Esaias 54. 7,

SECT. XV.
A Third occasion of present distress to the child of God, and whereby he is
occasioned to think that God does not love him, is Satanicall molestation. Oh
(says The distress of Satanicall molestation.
the child of God) can God love me, and leave me thus to the Devils power, to
be thus continually troubled and molested by him?

Yes, God can love thee, and does love The Comfort.
thee still, though he thus leave thee to the Devils power, to be thus
troubled, ^ledge^nd molested by him. And this will evi^ledge^ently appear in
all the particular troubles ^ledge^nd molestations of the Devil toward Gods
child.

1. It may be the Devil troubles thy bo^ledge^y: The first distress. The first
comfort for it.
And has he not done the like to the ^redge^est of Gods servants? To the
dearest of ^redge^is children?

Did he not carry the body of Christ him^ledge^elfe Math. 4. 5. 8.
from place to place? Did he not fill ^ledge^he body of Job with botches and
soars? Did Job 2. 7.
^ledge^e not exceeding grievously bow the body Luke 13. 16.
^ledge^f that poor woman (mentioned in the Go^ledge^pel) eighteen years
together? Did he not ^ledge^iserably vex the body of the Daughter of ^ledge^e
woman of Canaan? Did he not possess, Math. 15. 22.
^ledge^nd that in a fearful manner, the body of Mary Magdalen? And in as
fearful Luke 8. 2.
manner, or rather worse, the body of him i^redge^ whom were a whole Legion at
once. Ye^redge^ Luke 8. 29, 30.
did he not kill the bodies of Jobs children^redge^ Job 1. 19.
And dare thou say, that these were no^redge^ the children of God, and dearly
beloved o^redge^ him?

First, for Christ, the Scripture witnesset^redge^ that he was Gods beloved
Son, in whom ^redge^ Math. 3. 17. Job 1. 8.
was well pleased. Job, God himself acknowledges to be his Servant. The woman
th^redge^ had that spirit of infirmity eighteen year^redge^ is called by
Christ himself, A Daughter^redge^ Luke 13. 16.
Abraham: And can any doubt, but th^redge^ all the rest were the dear
servants, a^redge^ children of God, that shall read the test^redge^mony which
thc Scripture gives of them i^redge^ the fore alleged places, and others
whi^redge^ might be produced? And if so, why th^redge^ should thou doubt,
that God does n^redge^ love thee, dealing no otherways with the then he has
done with them?

2. Know this for thy comfort, th^redge^ The second Comfort.
though the Devil may thus have power ^redge^ver thy body, yet can he not hurt
thy soul^redge^ nay most commonly we see, that this ^redge^ possession of the
body, does prove, thro^redge^ Gods great mercy toward his child, ^redge^
dis-possession of his soul. So that that wh^redge^ Christ said of the Devils
instruments, (^redge^ can kill the body, but not the soul) the s^redge^ Luke
12. 4.
may we say of Satan himself, he may, by Gods permission, molest, hurt, wound,
yea kill the bodies of Gods dearest children, but hurt their souls he cannot;
their better part is still out of his reach, out of his power.

3. Know this also, that even in this molestation The third Comfort.
of thy body, the Devil cannot go one jot further, then God gives him leave.
He can bring Christ's body, and set it on the Math. 4. 5, 6.
Pinnacle, but throw it down from thence he cannot. He can inflict grievous
and loathsome botches and soars on the body of Job, but take away his life he
cannot. He could Job 2. 6.
possess the body of that poor man in the Gospel, but throw him headlong into
the Sea, as he did the herd of swine, he could not; no, though there were a
whole Legion of them Luke 8, 27. etc. See M. Dyke or Repentance, page 381. etc.
Dr. Tailour on Math. 4. page 213. B. B. Cowpers Works, page 607. col. 2. c.
in him at once. And the reason of all is this, because his power is limited;
for even the Devil himself is subject to the Kingdom of Gods power, and
providence; and will he, nill he, he must obey; till God let him loose, he
cannot go in any errand to do hurt; and when he is loose, and going about it,
as far as God permits him he may go, but one jot further he cannot pass,
be his might, or malice, never so great. A Lion, a roaring Lion indeed he is,
but this Lion is still in chains, and (which is the stay and comfort of Gods
child) the end of the chain God still keeps in his own hand, to let him
loose, or to restrain him at his will. And if this be so (as certainly it is)
this may be thy comfort, and stay too, That God will never permit him to molest
and trouble thee further then he sees it expedient for his glory, and thine
everlasting good.

4. And lastly, know this also for thy The fourth Comfort.
comfort, that whatsoever passes from thee in this time of thy extremity,
whether it be irreligious gesture, or profane and sinful speech, thou art but
a mere patient in it; they be the Devils sins, and not thine, and he must
answer unto God for them. And therefore comfort thy self in thy God, and be not
overmuch dismayed at this thy present distress; for though it afford cause of
pity from others, and of sorrow in thy self, yet of despair of Gods love
toward thee, it affords no cause at all.

But it may be Satan does not so much The second Distress.
trouble and molest thee in body, as he does in mind, by suggesting unto thee
sinful temptations.

If this be thy case, know this for thy comfort,

1. That the sinful temptations to which The first Comfort.
the Devil shall tempt any of Gods children, are not signs of Gods hatred, but
of the Devils; for Christ himself was thus tempted, Math. 4. 3, etc. Heb. 4. 15.
and yet was still Gods beloved Senne, in whom Math. 3. 17. and 17. 5. 2 Pet.
1. 17.
he was well pleased.

2. Such sinful temptations to the child of God, are certain evidences to his
soul, that he is none of Satan's: for when the strong Multiplicatio tentationem
signum est quod aliquis de manibus Daemonum evaserit. Gregor.
man armed keeps the house, the things that he possesses are in Luke 11. 21.
22.
peace; they neither feel temptation, nor fear distress. But when a stronger
then Satan comes, even Jesus Christ by his Word, and Spirit, and gets away
this possession from him, then begins he to Quanto districtius non exhibet
membra sua, arma iniquitatis peccato, tanto strictius hujusmodi Spiritu
quatitur, and pulsatur. Bern. lib. de Consc. De multip. variet. cogitat.
Boltons Instruct. ubi supra, page 557.
tempt the dis-possessed soul of Gods child, and to try if by any means,
fair or foul, he can bring it back again to his ancient subjection; whilst
the Prisoner lies in the Dungeon, loaded with bolts, and tied in chains, the
Keeper sleeps securely, because he knows he is safe: But if his bolts being
filed off, and his chains loosed, he have escaped out of prison, then the
Jaylour begins to bustle, and pursues him speedily with hue and cry. So whilst
Ex qua re nobis factus est adversarius Diabolus, nisi ex hac quia videt liberos
quos videbat ante captivos. August. de Symbol. ad Catechum. lib. 2. c. 1.
Satan holds us imprisoned in the dark Dungeon of ignorance, loaded and tied
with the heavy bolts and chains of sin, he is secure, and quiet: But if our
Savior by his Ambassadors in the preaching of the Word, do once loosen and
unburden us of these chains and bolts, and by the light of his Spirit do so
illuminate the eyes of our understanding, that we see the way ou^redge^ of
Satan's Dungeon of ignorance, and so escape out of his captivity: then he rages
and pursues us with his temptations, that See Touchstone for a Christian, page
81.
so either he may bring us back again into our former bondage, or else
destroy us if we make resistance.

Again, when the door is open, and there is free ingresse and egresse, we know
there is no knocking: but if the door be once shut, then still one or other is
ever rapping and bounsing. So it is here, the wicked have the doors of their
hearts set wide open to Satan, and therefore he rappes not there by
temptations: but the godly having the doors of their hearts shut up, and fast
barred against him, they are seldom free from them.

Let it not dismay thee then that thou art thus tempted, but rather rejoice,
and take comfort, that thou art so, because this gives thee good assurance that
thou art come ou^redge^ of Satan's kingdom, and do belong unto God: and can
God hate any? or not love any that are his?

3. Remember this for thy comfort, that all temptations are not Dyke of Christ's
temptation, p. 219. Wilson in his helps to faith, page 150.

the Heb. 4. 15.
Scripture says he was) free from sin, seeing he was not free from See Math.
4. 6. 9.
such temptations. Nay this is a sure ground in Divinity, That no more of
Satan's sinful temptations become sins in us, then we do Non est peccatum

crosses, but our sins they are not; nay, they are Satan's, God so accounts of
them; and for them must he, and not we, be accountable unto God.

4. And lastly, let not this be forgotten, that all Satan's temptations, whether

good of Gods child. For who would not reason thus with himself, If mine
enemy, Satan, does thus disquiet my mind with inward terrors, with those
sins which foolishly I did by his entisement; why shall I hearken to him
hereafter any more, and so increase the matter of my trouble? For what have I
of all the sins wherein I took pleasure, but only Romans 6. 21.
terror and shame? And can I expect any better fruit from this forbidden tree
hereafter? Oh what a faithless traitor is Satan? He entiseth man unto sin;
and when he has done it, he is the first Accuser and Troubler of him for it.
Stop thine ear therefore (O my soul) against the voice of this deceitful
Charmer.

And as for the latter kind of temptations, are they not all in Gods child so
many strong provocations, spurring him forward to the throne of grace? So many
Schoolmasters, to teach him humility? I am sure Luther was wont to say, that
Temptation, Meditation, and Prayer, were the three Masters, under whom he
profited most: And I doubt not but every one of Gods children does or may
experimentally find the same true in himself.

I know this is far from the Devils purpose, when he tempts us unto sin;
but thus does our good God evermore order and dispose of it for the good of
his child. And therefore the Devil in this case may not be unfitly compared
unto that Phereo Jasoni profuit hostis qui gladio vomicam ejus aperuit, quam
sanare medici non poterant. See Mr. Charles Richardson of Peter's Repentance,
page 49.
Combatant of whom we read, who ran his sword into his Adversaries body,
thinking thereby to have killed him: but Gods providence secretly guiding his
hand, he opened an Impostume, which no Physicians could heal; and so thinking
to kill him, he preserved his life. So the Devil in great rage thrusts sore
at Gods children, seeking to wound them to death by some notorious fallyet by
the gracious despensation of God, he is so far from hurting thee, as that by
this means he launceth and lets out their Ulcers of privy pride, and
overweening of themselves, which otherways might prove their destruction.

SECT. XVI.
A Fourth occasion of present distress to the child of God, whereby he is
occasioned to think that God does not love him, is want of audience in Prayer.
For thus The Distress.
he reasons, If God did love me, then certainly would he hear my prayers,
and grant me the requests which I have so often made unto him: But alas, I
find no such comfort by any of my prayers; nay, instead of the blessings which
I have so often, and so earnestly begged at the hands of God, I find the
clean contrary evils either still continued, or newly, and that in a greater
measure inflicted on me. And can God love any with whom he thus deals? No,
no, he cannot.

If this be thy case, know this for thy comfort,

1. That a man may be the dear child The Comforts.
of God, and yet not presently heard of God in prayer. For was not Job such a
one, and yet does not he complain, that God did not hear him, when he did cry
unto him? Job 30. 20.
Was not David such a one, and does not he complain after the like manner? O
my God (says he) I cry by day, but thou hear Psalm. 22. 3.
not; and by night, but have no audience. And are there not others of Gods
dear children, See Hab. 1. 2. Lam. 3. 44. and 3. 8. Psalm. 80. 4.
mentioned in the Scriptures, which have uttered the like complaints? Therefore
thou see thy case is not singular, others have wanted audience, as well as
thy self, in their prayers unto God, and have been never the less beloved of
him; and therefore why may not thou be so too?

2. Know this also for thy comfort, that God may See Mr. Tbomas Goodwins
Return of Prayers. Dr. Prestons Saints daily exercise.
have heard thy prayers, and have granted thee thy requests, and yet thou may
not know so much for the present. For may not thy case be as Dan. 9. 23. and 21.
Daniels was, whose prayer was heard, and his requests granted at the very
beginning of his supplications; and yet he knew not so much, till afterward he
was informed of it by the Angel, that was sent unto him from God for that very
purpurpose?

3. Know this also, that God may have heard thy prayer, though he have not
granted thee the same thing that thou have prayed unto him for. For See M.
Schudders Christians daily walk, page 578. M. Gatakers Sermon. on Psalm. 13. 1.
page 25. and 59. Dr. Playfaires Sermon. on Psalm. 6. 6. p. 55, etc. Dr. Mountague,
of Invocation, page 47, and 52.
God is said in Scripture to hear the prayers of his children two manner of
ways; sometimes by giving them the very thing they have asked; and sometimes
again, by giving them something answerable thereunto, when he grants not the
thing it self. Examples of the former are every where in Scripture: And of the
latter, we have the examples of Saint Paul, 2 Corinthians. 12. 8, and 9. Heb. 5. 7.
compared with Luke 22. 42, and 43.
and of our Savior Christ himself; both which had their prayers heard, and
yet neither of them had that granted him which in prayer he desired. Paul
desired to have that Messenger of Satan, which did so buffet him, to be taken
from him: God Deus and denegans exaudit, and exaudiens denegat: tribuens
aufert, non tribuens donat. Simon Cass. in Evangel. lib. 5. c. 24.
heard his prayer, but yet granted him not that; but instead thereof, grace
sufficient to be able to withstand the temptation of it. So our Savior Christ
prayed to be delivered from that Cup of his passion; and herein God heard him
too, but yet granted him not that; but instead thereof, strength and power,
whereby he was enabled to overcome the woeful pangs of that death. And may not
God have thus heard thee, though thou, as yet, take no notice of it? Certainly
he may. It may be thou have contentment granted thee instead of health and
wealth; patience instead of peace; grace to support instead of deliverance; or
if none of these, yet grace to continue still thy prayers unto God; which of
Gods child ought to be held a recompense sufficient for all his prayers, if he
should never receive other.

4. This would also be considered, that it may be the things thou have so long
prayed for, will not be for thy weal, but rather for thy hurt; and God
foreseeing this, has withheld them from thee of purpose that thou might
not be hurt by them. And if he have done so, can thou doubt whether he does
love thee? Will a loving and tender See Dr. Slatter in 1 Thessalonians. 5. page 516.
etc.
hearted Father give his little child a knife, though he cry never so eagerly
for it? And does not the very denying of such a thing argue Aliquando Sancti
non recipiendo quod petunt magis exaudiuntur, quam exaudirentur si illud
reciperent. Eusebius. Emis. Homil. in Litaniis majoribus, page 138. Aut dabit quod
petimus, aut quod noverit esse utilius. Bern. Sermon. 5. in quadrages.
great love in the Father toward his child, then the giving of it unto him
would do? Surely it does: And this, it may be, is thy case; Thou would have
riches, honors, liberty, health, peace, and such like things; but God
foreseeth that thou would (if thou had these) use them to his dishonor, or
to thine own, or others hurt; and therefore he denies them unto thee: And if
so bless the Lord for it, and magnify him for his love, and doubt no more of
it.

5. And lastly, this also ought to be considered, that there is a great deal
of difference betwixt the Lords delaying, and his denying of his child that
which may be for his good; for the Lord for a time delays that, which he will
not still deny; and that for these reasons, or other best known to himself,
and yet all out of love to his child.

Sometimes he does it, the more to stir us up, to be the more instant, and
earnest in Tardius dando quod petimus, instantiam nobis orationis indicit.
Chrysostom. Hom. 10. in Math. Beneficium distulit, ut desiderium accenderet.
Stell. in Luke 24.
Prayer. It may be he sees that we pray not with that feeling of wants, or
fervency of desire that is convenient; and therefore delayeth to give, till he
see us more sensible of the one, and more fervent in the other.

Sometimes he does it, the more to make us in love with, and the better to
esteem of the gifts and blessings which we would receive from him. Cito data
vilescunt, desiderata diu, dulcius obtinentur. Aug. Merx ultronea putet.
Hieron. ad Demetr.
Things easily, or quickly gotten, are soon forgotten; whereas things long
desired, and hardly obtained, are the more set by when we have them.

Sometimes again it may be he does it, the rather to try our faith, our
patience, or some other of his graces in us, to see what we would do; See BB.
King on Jon. p. 588.
what means we would use; whether we would seek to any other for help, and
comfort, in case he should not so suddenly help, and comfort us as we desire.

It may be for some one of these; it may be for some other reasons best known
to the Lord himself, he delayeth to grant that, which we have so long desired.
Which way soever it is, this may be our comfort, if we receive not the thing
we crave so soon as we have desired it, yet have it we shall, if God see it
expedient for his glory, and our good; or something in lie^redge^ of it, that
shall be better for us, when God thinks it good to give it us.

SECT. XVII.
A Fifth occasion of present distress to The Distress.
the child of God, is the smart of outward and inward afflictions; and this as
much as any of the former, does make him to doubt whether God do indeed love
him.

But if this be thy case, thou must know The Comfort.
this for thy comfort, That a man may be the dear Deus unicum habet Filium
sine peccato, nullum sine flagello. August.
child of God, and highly beloved and respected of him, though he be here in
this world never so much outwardly or inwardly afflicted.

And this does appear plainly, both by express testimonies, and evident
examples of Scripture: Express testimonies we have these.

First, Solomon uses this argument to Prove. 3. 11, 12.
persuade us with patience to bear the chastening of the Lord, and not to be
grieved with his correction, because He corrects him whom he loves, even as
the Father does the child in whom he delights. And the Apostle says even the
same, My Son Heb. 12. 5, 6.
(says he) despise not the chastening of the Lord, neither faint thou when
thou art rebuked of him; for whom the Lord loves he chasteneth, and scourges
every Son whom he receives. Nay the Lord himself avoucheth Revel. 3. 12.
even the same, As many (says he) as I love, I rebuke and chasten.

And hereof we have not a few examples in Scripture. For who was more in Gods
favor then Abraham, the Father of the Esaias 41. 8. Jam. 2. 23. Genesis 12. 1:
faithful? And yet how many afflictions did he undergo? As in leaving his
Country, and Kindred, to go to live amongst an unknown and barbarous people;
in the fear Genesis 12. 11, 12. and 20. 11. Genesis 22. 1. etc.
of his life for his Wife Sarah; in the offering up of his Son; in the
unkindnesse and dis-agreement of his Nephew Lot; not Genesis 13. 8.
to instance in more. Again, who was more dear unto God then Jacob? for did
he not say of him before he was borne, Jacob Mal. 1. 2. Romans 9. 13.
have I loved? And yet so many were his afflictions, that he affirmed his days
to have Genesis 47. 9.
been few and evil.

But the examples of Job and David may serve in stead of all other. For whom
do we read of in all the Scripture (excepting only the Prince of our
salvation, Jesus Heb. 2. 10.
Christ himself, who was consecrated through afflictions) that ever underwent
more outward and inward afflictions both, then they two did? And shall we say,
that God did not love them, when he did thus afflict them? No, no, we cannot.
The very end and issue which the Scriptures record of these their afflictions,
does prove the contrary. Touching the afflictions of Job, the end of them was
twice as full of comfort, as the beginning was of dis-comfort; as appears both
by that which Saint James Jam. 5. 11.
says of it, and that which is set down in the last Chapter of the Book of
Job. And Job. 42. 11, etc.
as for the afflictions of David, the end of them was so comfortable, that
himself not only professes, It was good for him that he Psalm. 119. 71.
had been thus afflicted: but also calls upon others to take notice thereof
with him, Come (says he) and I will show you what the Psalm. 66. 16.
Lord has done for my soul. Neither of which ends could have betided them, if
the Lord had not loved them. And therefore comfort thy self in thy God,
whosoever thou art, that art thus afflicted; for by these testimonies, and
examples of Scripture (besides many more that might be alleged) thou see,
that a man may be as grievously afflicted every way as thou have been, and yet
be the dear child of God, and one that is beloved of him.

SECT. XVIII.
BUt it may be, this is not thy case, it is The Distress
not so much the measure of thy presently-felt afflictions that does make thee
to doubt of Gods love toward thee, as thy long continuance under the Cross.

And if this be thy case, know this for The Comforts.
thy comfort,

1. That long continuance under the cross; may betide the best of Gods
children, and those whom he loves most dearly. For were not the Israelites of
old more dearly Psalm. 135. 4.
beloved of God, then any Nation in the world besides? And were not they for
all this in the land of Egypt, in the Exodus 20. 2.
house of bondage, under great Exodus 3. 7.
misery and affliction for the space of Genesis 15. 13.
four hundred years together? Were not the same people afterward carried
away captives ^ledge^nto Babylon, where they lived in as great misery for Jer.
25. 11.
seventy years more? Again. ^ledge^ was not this the case Psalm. 105. 18, 19.
of Joseph? Psalm. 13. 1, 2.
Of David? Hab. 1. 2. and 2. 3.
Of Habakkuk? And of sundry others that we read of in the Scriptures? All
which no doubt God loved dearly, and ^ledge^et continued them under the cross
for a ^ledge^ong time together. And Multi humi^ledge^iantur, and humiles non
sunt. Bern. in Cant. 34. Plectimur a Deo, nec ^ledge^ectimur tamen; corripimur,
scd non corrigimur. Salv. de provident. l. 5.
therefore why may not this be thy case too, though for the present thou can
find neither end, nor ease of these thy so long continued afflictions?

2. Thou must consider, that God ever in continuing these thy afflictions upon
thee may more dearly love thee, then if he shoul^redge^ take them speedily away.

Perhaps he sees that thou art not ye^redge^ sufficiently humbled: And will a
Father tha^redge^ loves his child, lay aside the rod till h^redge^ have
brought his stubborn and disobedie^redge^ Son to his knees? Perhaps he sees
th^redge^ there is a great deal of proud flesh yet i^redge^ thine heart: And
will a skillful and lovin^redge^ Medicus crudelis est, qui exaudit hominem, and
parcit vulneri, and putredini. Aug. in Psalm. 34. and in Psalm. 90. and in Psalm.

if th^redge^ rod were once off thy back, thou would to thy old sinful
courses again; and therefore for his greater glory, and thy great^redge^ good,
he thinks it fittest to keep thee ^redge^ under the lash: For some are of

afflicted; And it may be this is t^redge^ case: Which way soever it be, resolve
^redge^ this, either God (if thou will be content to wait his leisure) will,
in his good time, set Esaias 40. 31. and 49. 23. and 64. 4. Hab. 2. 3.
an end to these thy crosses here; or, if he see not that expedient, he will
crown thee with glory and immortality in the world to come, which he knows
will be better for thee.

SECT. XIX.
ANd thus far touching those distresses of Gods children, which, respecting
the time present, do arise from a conceited want of love in God. The other
distresses respecting the time present, are those which do arise from a
conceited want of grace in themselves.

And hence commonly arises a threefold The Distresses.
distress.

The first is for want of grace it self. The second is for want of some
certain measure of grace. And the third is for want of sincerity in that grace
which they conceit they have.
If the first of these be the cause of thy The Comforts.
present distress, then know this for thy comfort,

1. That there is a great differenee betwixt the being of grace, and the
sensible working of it; for Vide Spin. de justit. Christi.
grace may be where it does not sensibly work.

There may be See P. Baine Trial of a Christians state, page 4. Taffin. marks
of Gods children, cap. 4.
life in the root of a tree, though in the winter season the same be without
leaf and fruit: In a man's body there may be life, although for the present,
being in a swound, he does neither move nor breathe. And in a dry summer there
may be a secret spring of a well in the earth, though not so much as a drop
of water do flow from it: So there may be in thee at this time, grace, though
now, for the present, it do not by any outward act discover it self to thee,
or any other.

2. Thou must know, that there is also a great deal of difference betwixt a
man's having of grace, and a man's being aware that he has it: So that a man may
have grace even then, when he stands most peremptorily to it, that he has
none at all. Physicians report of men subject to melancholy passions, that
some have See Mr. Burtons Melanch. page 169.
thought themselves dead, and could not be persuaded otherways; when as yet
all that have beheld them, have known them to be living: And such like
spiritual perturbations are many times in the minds of Gods children in the
time of spiritual distress; so thereupon they will conclude directly of
themselves, that they have no grace at all; and they that come to talk with
them, and to comfort them, cannot beat them from that conceit, although they
see in them many, and those apparent evidences of grace, and gracious
goodness. And it may be, this is thy case.

But suppose, 3. that thou had indeed neither faith, nor repentance, nor any
other saving grace: yet finding that thou See Perkins in his Grain of Mustard
seed, Cor. 3. Downams Warfare, part 1. cap. 42. Dyke of Repent. cap. 15.
Byfield in Col. cap. 1. v. 4. Crook, Sermon. 3. Greenham, page 144.
see and feel in thy self the want of these, art grieved for it, do
wish and desire it might be otherways: this may be thy comfort, that even
this, in Gods account and acceptance, is as much as if thou had these graces
themselves.

A child of God in the time of spiritual distress, cannot be made to believe,
that he does believe; and yet even then he will tell you, that he does wish he
could believe, that he is grieved for his unbelief, etc.

A child of God in the time of spiritual distress, cannot be made to believe
that he is Ad dolorem contritionis pertinet etiam hoc, dolere quod non possumus
de peccato satis dolere. Chemnit. Exam. de Contrit. Perkins Cases of Consc.
lib. 1. cap. 5. Sect. 2. case 2. Chamier. panstrat. tom. 3. de satisfact.

Lombardi, and Comestoris, Si non habes tantum dolorem, quantum exigit tam
horrendum scelus, de boc tamen doleas, quod non potes dolere.
sorry, and grieved as he should be, for his sins; and yet even here he will
tell you, that he is sorry and grieved, because he can be no more sorry and
grieved.

A child of God in the time of spiritual distress, cannot be made to believe
that he can pray; and yet even then you shall hear come from him, sobbes, and
sighs, and groans; yea, even prayers with tears fo^redge^ the grace of
praying.

And if either of these be thy case, thi^redge^ thou must know for thy comfort,
that ever^redge^ such complaint and grief for want of thes^redge^ and the like
graces, is a sure argument, and infallible testimony of the presence of that
which yet thou complainest of, and grieve^redge^ for, as if it were not in
thee. For no ma^redge^ but a Believer can complain of the lack^redge^ of
faith; and the want of grace cannot b^redge^ taken notice of without grace.

But suppose, 4. that thou did not only see and feel in thy self the want
of these graces, but did also instead of them sensibly perceive the contrary
corruptions; a^redge^ instead of faith, infidelity; instead of grief and
sorrow for sin, obstinacy and obdurate hardness, and the like. Yet this
would have thee to know for thy comfort, Corruptions felt, hated, and striven
against, are no marks that we are not the Lords, but the contrary. See Mr.
Rogers of Dedham, Doctrine of Faith, cap. 2. page 177.
That if thou do (to the utmost of thy power) strive against these thy
corruptions which thou feel, this is so far from being an evidence of the
want of these graces, as that it may on the contrary most certainly assure thee
that thou have them. For even the very feelings, and strivings against
unbelief in the child of God, are the beginnings of faith; and the feeling and
bewailing of hardness of heart, is the seed of godly sorrow.

SECT. XX.
A Second thing that troubles the Child of God laboring under the sense of
want of Grace, is not so much the fear of wanting Grace it self, as of wanting
such, or such a measure of Grace, as he formerly had, or which he thinks Gods
Word does oblige him to have.

Touching the former, thus have I heard The Distress.
some Distressed Souls to say: There was a time when I felt that true of my
self, which Job so comfortably professes of himself, That I preferred the
words of the Lords mouth before mine appointed food. I have known the day when
I could with earnestness of affection, and feeling of wants pour out my Soul
unto God. I could once have wept heartily for my sins, etc. But now alas (and
with tears he utters it) I can find none of all these things in my self,
and therefore what can I think, but that all this which I have formerly felt,
is other then the Hypocrites vanishing flashes?

If this be thy case, know this for thy The Comfort.
Comfort. First, that there may be in the best of Gods Children decays of
Grace in part, and for a time. For of the Church of Revel. 2. 4.
Ephesus it is said, That she was fallen from her first love; and yet retained
the esteem of a Church, and that even with her Lord Jesus Christ. And of the
Philippians the Phil. 4. 10.
Apostle says, That their care did begin to spring again; which, what else
can it argue, but that this their care had had his fall, and winter of decay?
And of the best of Gods Saints living, who is there, that does always hear
with equal attention, reverence, and cheerfulness; or pray with like
earnestness of desire; feeling of wants, and assurance to be heard? Or does
do any thing in Gods Service at all times, as at some times? Secondly, thou
must also know, that there is no decay of Grace in Gods Child so great, but by
Gods blessing in the use of the means sanctified to that end, may be repaired
again, and restored to its wonted perfection. The Church of Ephesus formerly
mentioned, was fallen from her first love; yet is she advised by Revel. 2. 5.
Christ, To remember from whence she is fallen, to repent, and to do her first
works again. The Church of Revel. 3. 2.
Sardis likewise was so far decayed in respect of her former estate of Grace,
as that all her first Graces were even now ready to die: and yet is she
exhorted still to strengthen that which remains, yea, though it be ready to
die. And does Christ exhort to that (think thou) which he will not have, or
may not be done? Oh far be this from thee, or any other, to think!

Well then, if this be thy case, and thou find thy self clean altered from
what thou formerly have been, I will not deny but that thou have just cause of
Sorrow, but of Despair thou have no cause at all; for lo, there is yet a
possibility for thee to strengthen that which remains, and is ready to die:
there is yet a spark left within thee, which being stirred up (...). 2 Timothy 1. 6
and blown, may be brought to such a measure of Holy Heat, as may restore thee
again to thy wonted Fervency.

And therefore, when this dull fit does at any time come upon thee, do not (as
the Devil would have thee) conclude from hence, That there is no help for thee
in thy God, but rather do as Psalm. 51. 10, 11, 12.
David did: Go unto God, and pray unto him to quicken thee, and to put new
life of Grace into thy Soul, and to restore unto thee the wonted joy of thy
Salvation: using, together with it, all other means sanctified by God to that
end; and amongst the rest especially, a more careful, and conscionable
attendance on the Public Ministry of the Word.

SECT. XXI.
BUt it may be thou art not so much The Distress.
troubled at the want of that measure of Grace which thou formerly have had, as
at the want of that measure of Grace which thou do think that Gods Word
obliges thee to have. Thou think perhaps, that thy Faith is not so strong,
thy Love not so affectionate, thy Obedience not so entire; no Grace in thee
such, and so great as it should be, and therefore can not persuade thy self
that thou art one of Gods Chosen, seeing so little a measure of Grace appears
to be in thee.

If this be thy case, thou must know this The Comfort.
for thy Comfort. 1. That the least measure of Grace, is as truly Grace as the
greatest. Perhaps another Man may have a stronger Faith then thou have, yet
thou may have as true a Faith as his: and so of all other Graces: for
diversity of Degrees in the quantity of a thing does not take away, and
annihilate the Existence of Being thereof. A small drop of Water is as well,
and as truly Water, as the whole Ocean. A little spark is as well, and as truly
Fire, both in respect of substance, and quality, as the greatest Flame. And a
little Man, is as truly a Man, as the greatest Giant. And so is it with Grace,
the smallest measure thereof that Gods Child has, or may have, is as truly
Grace as the greatest.

2. Thou must know that the least measure of Grace which Gods Child has, or
may have, being in sincerity, finds acceptance with God See Doctor Slaters
Sermon. on Prove. 18. 14. Non ex gradu aut mensura fidei vel poenitentiae dependet
justificatio, sed ex veritate. Davenant. in Colos. page 21.
: for he measures the Graces of his Children not by quantity but by quality,
not by muchnesse, but by sincerity. He will not enquire how great, or how
little, but how sincere those Graces are which are in his Children. Faith, if
it be 1 Timothy 1. 5.
unfaigned, though it be but as a grain of mustard seed: Obedience likewise,
though it be mingled with many weaknesses, yet if it be Romans 6. 17.
hearty, has promise (b) Mat. 17. 20
of gracious acceptance. It is now under the Gospel, as it was in the
Sacrifices under the Law, where not the price, and value of the gift, but the
ability, and affection of the offerer was respected. For Nec intuetur Deus
quantum quilibet valeat, sed quantum velit, and quicquid vis and non potes,
Deus factum computat. Aug.
God respects not so much what we can do, as what we would do, and that
which we would perform, and cannot, he esteems it as if it were performed.
And so much the Apostle witnesses in a case not much unlike; If there be first
2 Cor. 8. 12.
(says he) a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man has, and
not according to that a man has not.

3. Thou must also know this, that the smallest beginnings of Grace, are Mat.
25. 29
pledges, and assurances of a greater measure, where there is thankful
acceptance, and conscionable use of those already received to the glory of the
Bestower.

4. And lastly, let not this be forgotten, that what thou want in respect of
any measure of Grace in thy self, thou have it supplied in Christ, thine Head
Joh. 1. 16.
: For of his fullness we all receive, and that Grace for Grace: And my God
(says Phil. 4. 19.
Saint Paul) shall fulfill all your necessities through his riches with glory in
Jesus Christ. Or if this were not supplied in him, yet in him it is so fully
punished, as that to thee which art Romans 8. 1. 33. 34.
in him, it shall never be imputed.

SECT. XXII.
THe third and last thing that troubles the Child of God, laboring under the
sense of the want of Grace, is a fear, and jealousy, that in the Graces which
he has, he wants sincerity.

For thus, some of them in the time of Spiritual Distress use to say; True it
is, that heretofore I have performed many excellent things savouring of Grace;
but what will all these profit me, considering that in them all, I have played
the gross See Doctor Sclaters Sermon. on Pro. 18. 14. page 21. etc. See Mr.
Boltons Instruct. ubi supra. page 473.
Hypocrite; for my Conscience (which is to me in stead of a thousand witnesses)
does now tell me, that either for fear, or fashion, or vainglory, or hope of
temporal benefit; or for some other carnal respect, I have performed them
all. And it may be this is thy case.

If it be, this thou may know for The Comfort.
thy Comfort; that suppose thou had been so gross an Hypocrite in the
performance of all these, as thou do conceit, and imagine; yet Hypocrisy, as
long as it is felt, and grieved for, and is by present purpose of heart, and
future endeavor of life, intended to be striven against, and resisted, is no
more prejudicial to the Salvation of Gods Child, then is any other sin which
he has committed. I deny not but that Hell fire is the Mat. 24. 51.
portion of Hypocrites, but it is of those Hypocrites only which live, and die
Hypocrites without Repentance, and of no other. And therefore, if heretofore
thou have been such a one, call now upon God for mercy for it, pray to him for
grace to be more sincere hereafter; and withal, use the Sea Mr. Dyke of the
deceitfullnesse of the Heart. page 380. Doctor Downa^ on Psa. 15. page 26 and

etc. M. Harris on Mat. 5. page 295. M. Schudders Daily Walk. page 373.
means of sincerity which Gods Word has set down for that end, and then thou
needst not doubt, but that this thine Hypocrisy shall be forgiven thee, how
foul, and abominable soever it has been in the eyes of God, or of thine own
Conscience. And thus far also touching those Distresses of Gods Children which
respect the time present. Now in the last place follow those which respect the
time to come.

SECT. XXIII.
ANd all these we may refer to one general, and common head, and that is a
fear arising in the hearts of Gods Children lest they should not (considering
their own weakness, and their Adversaries great strength) be able to
persevere, and hold out unto the end, without which they know there is no hope
of Salvation. And if this be that which troubles thee, then know thou this for
thy Comfort. That he, which is See Master Hookers Sermon. in Hab. 1. 4. page 6.
7. etc. Mr. Hierons Works. vol. 1. page 365. and 626.
once the Child of God, and in the estate of Grace, though he may fall
fearfully, (as David, Peter, and others of Gods Children have done) yet Jer. 8.
4.
fall totally, or finally, from Grace he cannot.

And that this is so, it may plainly appear by that which we read to this
purpose in the Scriptures. For therein we find, first, touching God, that he
will never totally, or finally, withdraw his Grace from his Child, which he
has once given him: For with him there is no Jam. 1. 17.
shadow of turning. The Esaias 54. 8.
mercy wherewith he has compassion on his Elect, is like himself, Everlasting,
and so is his Jer. 31. 3.
Love. Yea, those gifts of his which accompany an effectual Calling, Romans 11.
29. (...).
are without Repentance: that is, they be such, conferring of which he never
repents him: Nay, he rather Luke 8. 18.
adds more Grace always to his Children, then takes ought from them.

Secondly, as God will not withdraw his Grace, so the Devil cannot extinguish
it: he will endeavor indeed to do it, but his power is abridged. For 1 Epist.
John 4. 4.
greater is he that is in you, then he that is in the world. And Christ has
promised, That Mat. 16. 18.
Hell-gates shall never be able to prevail against those that are his.

And thirdly, if we fear our See Doct. Sclatcr on 1 These. 5. page 443.
own weakness, this may be our Comfort, as the same Scripture will tell us 2
Cor. 12. 9.
. 1. That God will perfect his power in our weakness, and make us Ibid. ver. 10
strong in him when we are weakest in our selves: at least, he will not 1 Cor.
10. 13
suffer us to be tempted above that we are able to bear. Or 2. If at any time
he should, he will keep us even then by his own 1 Pet. 1. 5.
power unto Salvation: and though we should take a fall, yet shall we not
utterly be cast off, for he will not put under Psalm. 37. 24
his hand, and stay us.

Again, here might be considered for our further Comfort, that our estate now,
is better then was See B. B. Lakes Sermons. part 2. page 48.
Adams in his Creation: for he was left for standing, or falling, to the power
of his own will, he had his perseverance in his own hands, which we have not;
but Christ has it for us, who is a surer keeper, and will keep both it for us,
and us by it unto the end, in despite of all his, and our Enemies. For none
can take us out Joh. 10. 28.
of his hands, nor separate us from Romans 8. 35. 38, 39.
his love. And therefore do not cast thy self down any longer with such
causeless fears of thy final, and future estate, but rather comfort thy
self, both in respect of these, and all other thy Spiritual Distresses, with
such Comforts as God in his Word does afford thee. And because thou may
always have at hand, such places of Scripture whereon to study, and meditate;
I have hereafter following, set down a Catalogue, or summary Collection of
such Scripture Comforts as may be most for thy present use.

And all other Comfort which is sought with neglect of this Comfort, brings two
great evils.

of Bondage to fear again, Romans 8. 15.

The Sick Souls mistakes.
WHEREIN Those places of Scripture (which being mistaken do many times prove
the very rack of tender Consciences, and make them to draw from them fearful
conclusions against themselves) are vindicated and cleared, and the Conclusions
confuted.
SECT. I.
The places of Scripture.
PROVE. 1. 24, etc. Because I have called (says God) and ye have refused, etc.
They shall call upon me, but I will not answer.
HEB. 12. 17. When Esau would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected, and
found no place for repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.
MATH. 25. 11, 12. The foolish Virgins coming too late, when the door was
shut: eried, Lord Lord, open unto us, and yet could not be admitted.
LUKE 13. 24. Many will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.
The Conclusion which tender Consciences draw from these places of Scripture
against themselves, is this:
THat if this be so, then certainly God will never have mercy upon them; though
either they themselves, or others for them, should pray, and call, and cry unto
God for it never so earnestly: For they now see, and their consciences do tell
them (that having so often, and for so long a time rejected all Gods offers of
grace made unto them in the Ministry of the Word, for their conversion) the
time, and date of their conversion is past; and therefore it is now too late,
and it will be but in vain for them, or others in their behalf, to seek or
sue unto God for it, or for his mercy upon them, in case they should now
convert, and amend: For Gods Word is true, and that (in the fore-alledged
places) does assure them thereof.

The fore-alleaged places of Scripture, vindicated, and cleared.
AS for that place See Master Scudders Christians daily Walk. page 545
in Prove. 1. 24. etc. if it be rightly understood, it makes nothing for that,
which is by the tender Conscience from thence concluded. For by (refusing)
there he means a constant, and obstinate refusing of Wisdoms counsel, even
until such time as God has brought some heavy Judgment, or Misery upon them.
At which time perhaps they will then turn unto God, and call, and cry for
mercy, pardon, and comfort: For so says God, ver. 28. Then shall they call
upon me. But by (calling) here is not meant an See Romans 10. 13.
hearty praying, with godly sorrow for Sin, making request for Pardon, and
for Grace: but a crying, and howling rather, like those in Hosea Hos. 7. 14.
under the sense of Gods Judgments, praying only to be See the Geneva notes
upon the place.
eased of it, as Exodus 8. 8. 29. and 9. 28.
Pharaoh was wont to do. For at what time soever a true Penitent Sinner shall
call and cry to God for mercy, God will hear his cry, and have mercy upon him:
For the Lord (says Psalm. 145. 18.
David) is nigh unto all them that call upon him, to all that call upon him in
truth.

Again, for the second place in Heb. 12. 17. touching Esau, his seeking of
repentance with tears, it is as much mistaken as the former: for it is not to
be understood of Esau his own repentance from his Profaneness, but of his
Father Isaacks Repentance. He would have had his Father to repent of what he
had done, and to change his mind, by revoking the Blessing which he had given
to his Brother, and to bestow it on him: but he could find no such Repentance
in his Father, no not though he sought it with tears, as appears, Genesis 27.
34. and 38.

And as for the third place alleged out of Mat. 25. 11, 12. touching the
foolish Virgins being excluded out of the Bride-chamber for coming too late.
We must know that this is a Parable, and Parables must not be urged beyond
their general scope. Now the general scope of the Parable is this, to show
that formal Professors of Christianity, such as have only ^redge^ 2 Timothy 3. 5.
Form of godliness without the power of it, although they will not live the
life of the Righteous, yet they could wish their Numb. 23. 10
end might be like theirs: and because of their outward Profession of Christ's
name in this Life, they securely expect Eternal Life; but because before their
Death, they did not provide the Oil of Truth and Holiness; therefore at the
day of Judgment they shall be disappointed of entering into Heaven, which in the
time of their Life they did so much presume of. So then, this Parable is not to
be understood of what shall betide true Penitent Sinners in this Life; but of
what shall betide Hypocritical Professors after this life at the day of
Judgment, when the Gate of Mercy shall be shut, and all means which they
shall then use to open it, shall be unavailable.

As for the fourth, and last place alleged out of Luke 13. 24. that is as much
mistaken as any of the rest, or rather more: For Christ says, Not many shall
strive to enter, and shall not be able, but many shall seek to enter, and shall
not be able: betwixt which, there is a great difference. For seeking imports
only a bare professing of Christ, coming to Church, hearing the Word, and
receiving the Sacraments: for thus did the Men spoken of by our Savior, who
are said not to be able to enter. But to strive to enter, is to do all these,
and more too: to wit, to put all his endeavors thereunto, to withstand all
lets, and hindrances, that may oppose him, to take every advantage that may
make the way the more passeable, and to make use of the time, and means that
are offered, when the way is so opened: this is properly to strive to enter.
Now never did any thus strive in seeking to enter (though it were but on the
last day of their life) that was put back back, and not received: Witness
the penitent Thief, Luke 23. 40, 41. etc.

The Conclusion drawn from the formerly alleged places of Scripture, confuted.
HEre then is no reason, nor ground (you see) of drawing any such fearful
Conclusion against your selves, as you imagine. I confess it is most true,
that Joh. 12. 36.
God would have us to walk, and work, whilst we have the light: And whilst it
is Heb. 3. 13. 15.
called to day, to return unto him; to accept of grace offered, and not to
harden our hearts against it. And Luke 19. 42, 43.
our Savior, for this cause, bewailed Jerusalem, because she had let slip the
day of her visitation.

And therefore they that have let slip their first times, and offers of grace,
have sinned, and played the fools egregiously, for which they have cause to be
much humbled: But why they should finally despair, they have no cause at all.
For as long as a man lives, and the means of salvation are not taken from him,
nor he from those means; but does hear what God has commanded him to do,
and what good things he still offers unto him in Christ. Nay, suppose the
means were taken from him, or he detained from them, by sickness,
imprisonment, or the like; so long as he yet lives, to call to remembrance what
God has commanded him to believe, and do; and does unfaignedly condemn
himself for refusing grace heretofore, and would be now willing and desirous
to accept of it, the day of salvation is not yet past to that man, nor the date
of Gods acceptance of him in Christ, as yet out; but he may, in the careful
and conscionable use of the means appointed by God, find the comfort of both.
And hereof we have a lively example in Manasses, for though the Lord spoke
often unto him by his Prophets, and he would not regard, but still refused all
grace offered him, as appears in 2 Chro. 33. 10. Yet at last (though but in
his tribulation) calling heartily unto God for mercy, and humbling himself
greatly before him, he was heard of him, and received to mercy, verse. 12, 13.

SECT. II.
The places of Scripture.
HEB. 6- 4, 5, 6. For it is impossible, that they, which were once enlightened,
and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy
Ghost; and have tasted of the good Word of God, and of the powers of the world
to come; if they fall away, should be renewed again by Repentance.
HEB. 10. 26. For if we sin willingly, after that we have received and
acknowledged the truth, there remains no more sacrifice for sins, but a
fearful looking for of judgment, and violent fire, etc.
2 PET. 2. 20, 21. They that have escaped from the filthynesse of the world,
through the acknowledging of the Lord, and of the Savior Jesus Christ; if they
be entangled again therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them
then the beginning: for it had been better for them not to have acknowledged
the way of righteousness, then after they have acknowledged it, to turn from
the holy Commandment given unto them.
The Conclusion which tender Consciences draw from these places of Scripture
against themselves, is this.
THat if this be so, then certainly they must never look to repent, nor to
find mercy with God, through Christ; but expect Hell fire hereafter, and some
fearful end here.

For their Consciences do tell them, and they cannot deny it, that since their
Conversion, and since the time that God has revealed his Son Christ unto
them, they have fallen shamefully, sinned willingly; and have been often
entangled again in those filthy, and profane courses of Life, in which they
once lived before their Conversion, and which at their Conversion they seemed
to renounce, and promised to forsake.

The fore-alleaged places of Scripture vindicated, and cleared.
THat place in the sixth to the Hebrews, and fourth Verse, is not to be
understood of any one, or more particular fallings into sin, but of an

universal Apostasy, and falling from Christ: for the Apostle says not, if
they fall, but if they fall away, utterly renouncing Christ, (in whom they made
a show formerly to believe) and all hope of Salvation by him, not sparing what
lies in them, to crucify him again unto themselves, and to make a mock of him.

That place in the tenth to the Hebrews, and six and twentieth Verse is in
like manner, not to be understood of any one, or more sins voluntarily, and
willingly committed (for so even the best of Gods children, even after
regeneration, may sin; See Mr. Edw. Raynolds Sermon. in Romans 6. 12. page 288,
etc.
there being as much of the flesh still, and sinful corruption in the will, as
in any other part of regenerate men) but (...) implies not a single will, but
rather a resolute wilfulness. See Dr. Denisons Sermon. in loc. page 12.
wilfully, that is, spitefully and maliciously committed against God, and
against his Christ; treading under foot the Son of God, and counting his
blood an unholy thing, and even despiting the Spirit of Grace, as it is, v. 29.
Besides this, it is Vide Animad. Rob. Abbot, Episc. Sarisbur. in Thomsoni
Diatrib. cap. 21. See Dr. Fields Appendix, in fine, l. 5. de Ecclesia, part. 1.
page 130. Mr. Perkins Works in fol vol. 1. page 372. col. 2. d.
one thing to have the whole consent of the will unto some one sin, stolen
away by some particular temptation; and another, to be wholly addicted and
devoted to the ways of sin; to have the whole heart universally married to
lust, and filled with Satan, whereby it brings forth fruit unto death. Into
the former of these, we grant Gods children may fall (and yet even in that
case, the seed of God which abides in them, though it did not operate to
prevent sin, will yet undoubtedly serve to supply repentance in due time for
sin) but that they should fall into the latter, is repugnant to Scripture,
and to the Throne of Christ in the hearts of his children.

And as for that place in 2 Pet. 2. 20. it is not meant of every
re-ensnarement, and re-entanglement in sin after conversion: For which of all
Gods children can so carefully look unto himself, but some of Satan's nets and
traps which he sets in his way, may (if God leave him never so little to
himself) re-ensnare him? But it is to be understood of such a re-ensnarement,
and re-entanglement in sin, and sinful courses, as that he is thereby so
ensnared, and entrapped, as that he is overcome by it, and made the Servant and
Slave of sin again: For of whomsoever a man is overcome (says Saint Peter)
of the same is he brought in bondage to do the will of sin, to Romans 6. 12.
they it in the lusts thereof; and to give up his members, as servants to
uncleanness, and Romans 6. 19.
to iniquity, to commit iniquity, and that with greediness. Ephesians. 4. 19.


The Conclusion drawn from the formerly alleged places of Scripture, confuted.
HEre then is no reason, nor ground, (you see) of drawing any such fearful
conclusion against your selves, as you imagine. I confess, the child of God
may fall into sin after his conversion; yea, he may sin (in some sort)
willingly too; nay, he may be re ensnared, and entangled again, in some
sins, (if God leave him to himself) in which he had formerly lived: But that
any, or all these upon his true repentance, should not be forgiven him; or that
the sacrifice of Christ's death should not be meritoriously available thereunto,
or that he should be left by means of these his sins, in an estate worser,
then he is in, that never knew Christ, nor the means of his salvation; this is
more then may be concluded from these, or any other places of Scripture. Nay,
they do assure us, that this is the portion only of Apostates, and wilful
sinners, which do renounce Christ; and of those that are so overcome again by
sin, that they yield themselves over to be his slaves and vassals for ever.

SECT. III.
The place of Scripture.
2 CORINTHIANS. 13. 5. Prove your selves whether ye are in the faith: Examine your
selves: Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye
be Reprobates?
The Conclusion which tender Consciences draw from this place against
themselves, is this,
THat they, according to the Apostles command, have tried whether they be
i^ledge^ the faith, or no; and whether Christ be in them: But upon this trial,
and examination, they can find no such thing in themselves, and therefore by
the Apostles verdict, they must needs be Reprobates and Castawaies.

The place of Scripture vindicated and cleared.
FOr the better understanding of this place of Scripture, such tender
Consciences must know, that by Reprobates in this place, are not meant those
that are not elect, whom God in his just judgment has past by, and ordained
unto wrath, as the word is usually understood: For none of the elect, before
their Conversion, do know, by any search, that they are in the faith, or that
Christ is in them; for that cannot be known, which yet is not. Again, many
are not converted, until they be thirty, forty, fifty years old, or upward:
And shall we say, that such in their younger years were Reprobates? We may
then say, that they were in the state of damnation, but cannot, dare not say,
they were Reprobates.

Besides, a man must not be said, not to be in the faith, and not to have
Christ in him, because he does not know so much: For many of Gods dearest
children may have faith, and have Christ in them, and yet in the time of
spiritual desertion, or when some grievous temptation is upon them may not
know so much, as we see by daily experience. I confess the word, Reprobate, is
ordinarily understood by our common people, for a man ordained to condemnation;
and I confess it is a term proper enough to express such by: But yet in
this place, it See Dr. Jackson on the Creed, lib. 7. page 180. etc.
cannot be taken in that sense, as may appear by the whole coherence of the
Apostles Discourse.

The thing now questioned by the Corinthians, upon the suggestion of some false
Apostles, was this; whether Paul were lawfully called to his Apostleship; and
therefore they require of him to give them (...). v. 3.
a proof of Christ's speaking in him.

To which his answer is this, or to this purpose, I will go no further to
seek a proof of Christ's speaking in me, then unto your selves: Has not the
Word, and Gospel of Christ, been powerful by my Ministry to convert you,
and to beget faith, and to form Christ in you? Look into your selves, (...).
try if ye have not faith, and if Christ be not formed in you. If you find
this, I need no other proof of my calling, nor of Gods power and grace
blessing me in my calling. But if upon trial you cannot find, that you are in
the faith, and Christ thus formed in you, then you have yet either a mere
form of Christianity, and my pains has been taken amongst you in vain: Or
if you be Christians in truth, yet you are unexperienced Christians, and
without proof of the truth of it in your selves. But whether you find, upon
trial, these things in you, or no, I trust and am assured, that I, and
^ledge^he rest of Christ's Ministers with me, shall ap^ledge^ove our selves to
be true, and faithful Mi^ledge^isters of Christ; though you, and the false
Apostles, think us to be such, as cannot give ^ledge^oofe of Christ's speaking
in us. So then the ^ledge^ord here rendered (...).
Reprobates) (to speak ^ledge^s the coherence gives it) cannot be meant
^ledge^f such as be Reprobates indeed, but of such ^ledge^nely, as are (...).
Except you be unapproved, or except ye be without proof, viz. of your being in
the faith, etc. See Mr. Schudder, ubi supra, page 536.
unapproveable, or can give no ^ledge^roofe for the present; and make it
ap^ledge^eare to themselves, that they are in the ^ledge^ith, or that Christ is
in them indeed.

The Conclusion drawn from the fore-alleadged place of Scripture, confuted.
ANd therefore they that shall from hence conclude, that because upon trial,
they can neither find themselves in the faith, nor Christ in them, therefore
they are Reprobates indeed, do foully err, and are much mistaken. For first,
(you see) the Apostle does not avouch any such thing here. And next, in case
you should be that, which the Apostle does here intend, at the utmost it can be
but this, that you are for the present, only unexperienced and unapproved
Christians: For who knows not, that God can make you able to give better
proof thereof hereafter? And that he will do it (you may build upon it) if
you shall carefully and conscionably keep on in the use of the means
sanctified and appointed by him for that end.

SECT. IV.
The place of Scripture.
1 JOHN 3. 20. If our heart condemn ^redge^ God is greater then our heart, and
kn^redge^eth all things.
The Conclusion which tender Consciences draw from this place of Scripture
against themselves, is this:
THat seeing their own Consciences do (as they find) condemn them;
therefore they can be no other, then damned Wretches, in the sight of God; for
he is greater then their consciences, and knows much more of them, then they
know of themselves, and accordingly will one day judge them.

The place of Scripture vindicated and cleared.
FOr the better understanding of this place of Scripture, we must know, that
^ledge^here is a twofold judgment, which the ^ledge^eart and conscience of a
man passes upon ^ledge^im in this life. The one is of his estate and
^ledge^erson, as whether he be in the estate of ^ledge^race, or no: The other
is of his particular ^ledge^tions, whether they be good, or no.

This place of Saint John cannot be un^ledge^erstood of judging, or condemning
the ^ledge^son; for God in his final judgment, ^ledge^oth not judge according
to what a man's ^ledge^eake and erroneous Conscience judges of him here: For
many a man, in his presumption and selfe-confidence, may justify himself
here, whom God may condemn hereafter: And many a poor distressed Soul may,
with the Prodigal, and humble Publican, condemn himself here, whom yet God
will absolve hereafter.

But this place is rather to be understood of judging of particular actions;
namely, whether a man love his Brother, not in word and tongue only, but in
deed, and in truth, according to the Apostles exhortation, v. 18. which if his
conscience could testify for him, then it might assure his heart before God,
and give it boldness to pray unto him, in confidence to receive whatsoever he
did ask, according to his will: But if his own Conscience did, or could
condemne^redge^ him of not loving his Brother in deed, and i^redge^ truth, then
God (who is greater then h^redge^ heart, viz. in knowing the truth of his love)
knowing all things, must needs condemn^redge^ him therein much more. And this I
take to be the Sea BB. Lakes Sermon in loc. Lactant. de vero cultu, l. 6. c. 24.
full scope, and meaning of th^redge^ place.

The Conclusion drawn from this fore-alleaged place, confuted.
LEt no distressed Soul then think, and conclude from hence, that because his
own conscience judges and condemns him for a Reprobate, for a Castaway,
and one that is not in the estate of grace, therefore he must needs be so in
the judgment and condemnation also of the Lord. For first, you see this place
proves it not. Next, we know, and by experience do often find, that even Gods
own children, in the time of their spiritual distress, are most unfit to
judge of their present gracious estate here, or of their final estate
hereafter: Witness, David, Job, Jonah, and other of Gods children. Yea, they
that have thus judged of themselves, have in conclusion found, that they have
(by so doing) both misjudged God, and themselves, for which they have asked
Gods pardon, and upon their true repentance have found it.

THE SICK SOVLES PRESIDENTS.

OR, Comfortable Examples of Distressed Consciences, which after long and deep
Distresses, have found ease and comfort, through Gods great mercy toward them.

An Advertisement to the READER.
AS there is no one thing that does more dishearten Distressed Consciences,
then to think that their case is singular, and that never any in their case
were ever restored to comfort: So no one thing does more comfort them, then to
hear, that others have been in as bad, or worse a case, then they, and yet
have found comfort in the end.

And therefore for the better furthering of their assurance of the one, and
confirmation of the other, I have hereafter set down these few examples, which
I have met with in both kinds; wishing the Sick Soul to peruse them, and if
he find comfort by any of them, to give God the praise, who is the Father of
mercies, and the God of all comfort, and consolation: And if not, yet to
resolve with Job, That though the Lord should kill Job 13. 15.
him, yet he will put his trust in him.

did deliver them.

They called upon thee, and were delivered; they trusted in thee, and were not
confounded.

THE Sick Souls Presidents.
OR, Comfortable Examples of Distressed Consciences, which after long, and
deep Distresses, have found ease and comfort, through Gods great mercy toward
them.
A most comfortable Example of one Mr. Robert Glover, Martyr; which shows,
that one may be for a time without any sense, or feeling of Comfort from God,
and yet find it in the end. Taken out of the Book of Martyrs, Edit. Anno
1597. page 1555. col. 2. lin. 60.
AFter Mr. Robert Glover was condemned by the Bishop, and was now at the point
to be delivered out of this world; it so happened, that two or three days
before, his heart being lumpish, and desolate of all spiritual consolation, he
felt in himself no aptness, or willingness, but rather an heavynesse and
dullness of spirit, full of much dis-comfort, to bear the bitter cross of
Martyrdom, ready now to be laid upon him.

Whereupon he fearing in himself lest the Lord had utterly withdrawn his
wonted favor from him, made his moan to one Austen his Friend; signifying
unto him, how earnestly he had prayed day and night unto the Lord, and yet
could receive no motion or sense of any comfort from him. Unto whom the said
Austen answering again, willed and desired him patiently to wait the Lords
pleasure: And however his present feeling was, yet seeing his cause was just,
and true, he exhorted him constantly to stick to the same, and to play the
man; nothing at all mis-doubting, but the Lord in his good time, would visit
him, and satisfy his desire with plenty of consolation, whereof (he said) he
was right certain and sure; and therefore desired him, whenever any such
feeling of Gods heavenly mercies should begin to touch his heart, that then he
would show some signification thereof, whereby he might witness with him the
same, and so departed from him.

The next day, when the time came of his Martyrdom, as he was going to the
place, and was now come to the sight of the Stake; although all the night
before, praying for strength and courage, he could feel none; suddenly he was
so mightily replenished with Gods holy comfort, and heavenly joies, that he
cried out, clapping his hands to Austen, and saying in these words, Austen, he
is come, he is come, etc. and that with such joy and alacrity, as one seeming
to be risen rather from some deadly danger, to liberty of life, then as one
passing out of the world by any pains of death. Such was the change of the
marvailous working of the Lords hand upon that good man.

Another most comfortable Example of one Mr. John Glover, who for a long time
could not be persuaded, but that he had committed the sin against the Holy
Ghost; who yet afterward lived and died in a comfortable estate. Taken out of
the Book of Martyrs also: page 1551. lin. 80. col. 2.
THis Gentleman, Mr. John Glover, being called by the light of the Holy Spirit,
to the knowledge of the Gospel; and having received a wondrous sweet feeling
of Christ's heavenly Kingdom; his mind after that, falling to some cogitations
of his former affairs, belonging to his vocation, began by and by to mis doubt
himself upon occasion of those words, Heb. 6. 4. For it is impossible, etc.

Upon consideration of which words, he was so far deserted, as to be
persuaded, that he had sinned against the Holy Ghost, even so much, that if he
had been in the deepest pit of Hell, he could almost have despaired no more of
his salvation.

Being young (says Mr. Fox) I remember I was once or twice with him, whom
partly by his talk I perceived, and partly by mine own eyes, saw to be so
worn and consumed by the space of five years, that neither almost any
brooking of meat, quietness of sleep, pleasure of life; yea, and almost no
kind of senses was left in him.

Who in such intolerable griefs of mind, although he neither had, nor could
have any joy of his meat, yet was he compelled to eat against his appetite,
to the end to defer the time of his damnation, so long as he might: thinking
with himself no less, but that he must needs be thrown into Hell, the breath
being once out of the body: Albeit Christ (he thought) did pity his case, and
was sorry for him; yet he could not (as he imagined) help, because of the
verity of the Word, which said, It is impossible that they which were once
enlightened, etc.

But what was the happy issue, and effect of these extraordinary spiritual
terrors, and terrible desertion? The same Mr. Fox, who writes the Story, and
was himself with the Party, tells, That albeit he suffered many years so
sharp temptations, and strong buffetings of Satan; yet the Lord, who
graciously preserved him all the while, not only at last did rid him out of
all discomfort, but also framed him thereby to such mortification of life, as
there likely has not been seen, in such sort as he, being like one placed in
Heaven already, and dead in this world, both in word, and meditation, led a
life altogether celestial, abhorring in his mind all profane doings.

Another most comfortable Example, of one, who had given himself, body and
soul, to the Devil, and sealed him a Bond with his own blood, for the
performance of it; and yet by prayer was freed. Mr. Fox, ibid. page 78. col. 1.
lin. 82, etc.
AS touching the marvailous works of the Lord, wrought here by men; if it be
true which is credibly reported by the learned: What Miracle can be more
miraculous, then that which is declared of a young man about Wittenberge, who
being kept bare and needy by his Father, was tempted, by way of Sorcery, to
bargain with the Devil, or a Familiar (as they call him) to yield himself,
body and soul, into the Devils power, upon condition, to have his wish
satisfied with money: So that upon the same, an Obligation was made by the
young man, written with his own blood, and given to the Devil.

This case you see how horrible it was, and how damnable. Now hear what
followed. Upon the sudden wealth and alteration of this young man, the matter
first being noted, began afterward more and more to be suspected, and at
length, after long and great admiration, was brought to Martin Luther to be
examined.

The young man, whether for shame, or fear, long denied to confess, and would
be known of nothing: yet God so wrought, being stronger then the Devil, that
he uttered unto Luther the whole substance of the case, as well touching the
money, as the Obligation. Luther understanding the matter, and pitying the
lamentable estate of the man, willed the whole Congregation to pray, and he
himself ceased not with his prayers to labor: So that the Devil was
compelled at the last to throw in his Quidam negavit Christum per Chyrographum,
post restitutus. See Mr. Burtons Melan. cholly, p. 544.
Obligation at the Window, and bad him take it again unto him. Which
Narration, if it be so true, as certainly it is of him reported, I see not the
contrary, but that this may well seem comparable with the greatest miracle in
Christ's Church, that was since the Apostles time.

Another most comfortable Example of one Mr. Peacock, who felt a dreadful
desertion upon his deathbed, and yet was refresht and ravished with the light
of Gods countenance before his death.
THis Mr. Peacock in that his dreadful visitation, and desertion, recounting
some smaller sins, burst out into these words:

And for these (says he) I feel now an Hell in my Conscience. And upon other
occasions he cried, groaning most pitifully, Oh me Wretch! Oh mine heart is
miserable! Oh, Oh, miserable and woeful! The burden of my sin lies so
heavy upon me, I doubt it will break my heart: Oh how woeful and miserable is
my estate, that thus must converse with Hell Hounds!

And when the bystanders asked, If he would pray? he answered, I cannot.
Suffer us then (said they) to pray for you. Take not (replied he) the name of
God in vain, by praying for a Reprobate.

And yet he lived to see this storm overblowne, and then thus he spoke, Truly
my heart and soul have been far led into, and deeply troubled with
temptations, and stings of Conscience; but, I thank God, they are eased in
good measure: Wherefore I desire, that I be not branded with the note of a
Reprobate, and Castaway. Such questions, oppositions, and all tending thereto,
I renounce: And concerning my inconsiderate speeches in my temptation, I humbly
and heartily ask mercy of God for them all.

Afterward, more light, by little and little, did arise in his heart, and he
brake out into such speeches as these:

I do (God be praised) feel such comfort from that (what shall I call it?)
Agony, (said one that stood by, that is too little) that had I five hundred
worlds, I could not make satisfaction for such an issue. Oh the Sea is not more
full of water, nor the Sun of light, then the Lord of mercy! Yea, his mercies
are ten thousand times more. What great cause have I to magnify the great
goodness of God, that has humbled, nay rather exalted such a Miscreant, and
of so base condition, to an estate so glorious, and stately? The Lord has
honored me with his goodness, I am sure he has provided a glorious Kingdom
for me: The joy that I feel in my heart is incredible, etc. See more in the
Narration of Mr. Peacocks desertion upon his bed of death.

Another most comfortable Example of a Woman, that through despair of Gods
mercy, attempted the destruction of her self; which yet (through the great
mercy of God toward her) was preserved; and after had the joy of her salvation
restored unto her.
THere was, beyond the Seas, a Christian Matron, of excellent parts and piety,
who languishing long under the horrible pressure of most furious and fiery
temptations, woefully at length yielded to despair, and attempted the
destruction of her self: And after often and curious seeking of occasion for
that bloody fact, at last (having first put off her Apparel) threw her self
headlong from an high Promontory into the Sea; but having received no hurt by
her fall, she was there by a miracle, and extraordinary mercy, strangely
preserved for the space of two hours at least, though all that while she
labored industriously to destroy her self: Afterward, drawn out with much
ado, and recovered, she yet still did conflict with that extremest desperate
horror almost a whole year. But by Gods good providence, which swectly and
wisely orders all things, listening on a time, though very unwillingly at the
first, to her Husband, reading, amongst other places, that in Esaias 57. 15. Thus
says the High and Holy One, that inhabiteth Eternity, whose name is Holy: I
dwell in the high and holy place; with him also that is of a contrite, and
humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of
the contrite one: For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always
wroth; for the spirit should fail before me, and the souls which I have made.

I say, listening to these words, the Holy Ghost inclining her heart, she began
to reason thus with her self; God does here promise to revive and comfort the
heart of the contrite, and spirit of the humble; and that he will not contend
for ever, neither be always wroth: But I have a very contrite heart, and a
spirit humbled even to the dust, out of the acknowledgement and sense of my
sins, and divine vengeance against them: Therefore peradventure God will
vouchsafe to revive, and comfort my heart, and spirit, and not contend with me
for ever, nor be wroth against me still.

Hereupon by little and little, there flowed by Gods blessing into her dark,
and heavy heart, abundance of life, lightsomenesse, spiritual strength, and
assurance; in which she continued with constancy, and comfort, many a year
after; crowned those happy days, and a blessed old age, with a glorious and a
triumphant death. Vide Alexipharm. adversus desperationem, Authore Mro.
Nicholao Laurentio, page 63. and seq.

Another comfortable Example of one that was grown extremely melancholy, and
by means of that, desperate; which yet by bodily physic alone, was through
Gods blessing thereon, cured and recovered of both, by Petrus Forestus, as he
himself relates it: Observat. lib. 10. cap. 12. De morbis cerebri.
THere was (says he) a certain Minister, which through precise fasting in
Lent, became extremely melancholy, and in the end desperate: He thought he saw
Devils in his Chamber, and that he could not be saved; He smelled nothing (as
he said) but Fire and Brimstone, and that he was already in Hell; and would
ask them still that were about him, if they did not smell as much? I told him
(says he) that he was melancholy; but he laughed me to scorn, and replied,
that he saw Devils, talked with them in good earnest; and would now, and then,
spit in my face, and ask me, if I did not smell Brimstone? And yet through
Gods blessing on the means used, I in the end cured him Felix Plater has
store of such like instances, lib. 1. Observat. de mentis alienat.
.

Remember and make use of this, all you that are in this distressed estate, and
yet cannot endure; or be persuaded to make use of the advice and help of the
learned Physician for the rectifying of your bodily distempers, which most
times increase, if not cause your souls distresses.

Another comfortable Example of one Mris. Katharine Brettergh; Taken out of the
Discourse of her holy life, and Christian death.
THis good Woman upon her deathbed was horribly hemmed in with the sorrows of
death, and the very grief of Hell laid hold on her soul; insomuch that she
said, That her sins had made her a prey to Satan; and wished that she had
never been borne, or that she had been made any other Creature rather then a
Woman: Yea, she cried out often, Woe, woe, woe, etc. a weak, a woeful, a
wretched, a forsaken Woman, with tears continually trickling from her eyes.
And yet at last was that Hellish storm so overblowne, by the return of the
glorious beams of the Sun of righteousness into her soul, that before her
death she turned her tune, and brake forth into these triumphant songs, and
ravishments of spirit.

O Lord Jesu, do thou pray for me? O blessed, and sweet Savior: How
wonderful! How wonderful! How wonderful are thy mercies! Oh thy love is
unspeakable, that have dealt so graciously with me! O my Lord! O my God!
Blessed be thy name for evermore, which have showed me the path of life. Thou
did, O Lord, hide thy face from me for a little season, but with everlasting
mercy thou have had compassion on me. And now, blessed Lord, thy comfortable
presence is come; yea, Lord, thou have had respect unto thine Handmaide, and
art come with fullness of joy, and abundance of consolation. O blessed be thy
name, my Lord, and my God! Oh the joys! The joys! The joys that I feel in
my soul! O they be wonderful! They be wonderful! O Father, how merciful,
and marvailously gracious art thou unto me! Yea, Lord, I feel thy mercy, and I
am assured of thy love, and so certain am I thereof: As thou art the God of
Truth, so sure do I know my self to be thine, O Lord, my God. And this my
soul knows right well; and this my soul knows right well: Oh blessed be
the Lord! Oh blessed be the Lord, that has thus comforted me; and has now
brought me to a place more sweet unto me, then the Garden of Eden. Oh the joy,
the joy, the delightsome joy that I feel! --

Oh happy am I that ever I was borne to see this blessed day! I confess before
the Lord his loving kindness, and his wonderful works before the sons of
men; for he has satisfied my soul, and filled my hungry soul with goodness.

-- Oh praise the Lord for his mercies, and for this joy which my soul feels
full well: Praise his name for evermore.

Another comfortable Example of one that had long labored under the temptation
of Blasphemy, which yet at last found freedom from it, and comfort. Related by
Mr. Bolton in his Instructions for the comforting of Afflicted Consciences,
page 550.
I Have known one (says he) who did bite in, and keep close in his bosom,
the temptation of Blasphemy the space of about twenty years; all which while
the Devil did tyrannize extremely, and kept him almost in continual terror.

He thought there was never man had such vile and prodigious thoughts, as he;
and if the world knew what they were, he should be abhorred as a Monster of
men, and the loathsomest Creature upon earth; most worthy to be utterly
exterminated, and utterly rooted out of the society, and confines of mankind.
And hereupon many, and many a time, when he apprehended any opportunity, or had
any means offered to make himself away, he was tempted thereunto principally
upon this ground, that it was pity such an horrible Blasphemer (for so he
supposed) should any longer breathe: But at last hearing the nature, manner and
remedy of these hideous injections discovered by the Ministry; and afterward
privately informing himself further, and more fully from Gods Messenger, was
happily taken out of the Rack for the time to come, and most wonderfully
refreshed: And therefore (said he) take heed of keeping the Devils counsel.

Another comfortable Example of a wonderful Combat betwixt Mris. Katharine
Stubbes, lying upon her deathbed, and Satan; wherein she had the Conquest:
Taken out of her life and death, set forth by Philip Stubbes, Gentleman.
THis virtuous Gentlewoman had no sooner made an end of the confession of her
faith, but Satan was presently ready to bid her the Combat; whom yet she
mightily repulsed, and vanquished by the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, on
whom she constantly believed: And whereas before she looked with a sweet,
lovely and ^ledge^miable countenance, red as the Rose, and most beautiful to
behold; now upon the sudden, she bent her brows, she frowned, and looked as it
were with an angry, stern and austere countenance, as though she saw some
filthy, and some ugly, and dis-pleasant thing, and so burst forth into these
speeches following, pronouncing her words scornfully and disdainfully, in
contempt of him whom she spoke unto.

How now Satan, what make thou here? Art thou come to tempt the Lords
servant? I tell thee (thou Hell hound) thou have no part, nor portion in me,
nor by the grace of God ever shall have. I was, now am, and shall be the Lords
for ever. Yea, Satan, I was chosen and elect of Christ to everlasting
salvation, before the foundation of the world was laid; and therefore thou must
get thee packing, thou damned Dog, and go shake thine ears, for in me thou
have naught. But what do thou lay to my charge, thou foul Fiend? Oh, that I
am a sinner, and therefore shall be damned. I confess indeed, that I am a
sinner, and a grievous sinner, both by original sin, and by actual sin,
and that I may thank thee for: And therefore, Satan, I bequeath my sin to 1 Chronicles. 21. 1. Joh. 13. 2. 1 John 3. 8.
thee, from whence it first came, and I appeal to the mercy of God in Christ:
For Jesus Christ came to save sinners (as he says himself) Math. 9. 13.
and not the righteous: Behold the Lamb Joh. 1. 29.
of God (says John) that takes away the sins of the world. And in another
place he cries out, The blood of Jesus Christ does 1 John 1. 7.
cleanse us from all our sins. And therefore, Satan, I constantly believe, that
my sins are washed away in the precious blood of Jesus Christ, and shall never
be imputed unto me any more.

But what say thou now Satan? Do thou ask me now, how I dare come to him
for mercy, he being a righteous God, and I a miserable Sinner? I tell thee,
Satan, I am bold through Christ to come unto him, being assured and certain of
pardon, and remission of all my sins for his names sake: For does not the
Lord bid all that be heavy laden with the burden of sin, to come unto him,
and Math. 11. 28.
he will ease them? Christ's arms were spread wide open (Satan) upon the Cross
(and with that she spread out her arms) to embrace me, and all penitent
Sinners; and therefore (Satan) I will not fear to present my self before his
footstool, in full assurance of his mercy for Christ his sake.

What more Satan? Do thou say it is written, That God will reward every one
according to his desert? So it is written again (thou deceitful Devil) that
Christ's righteousness is my righteousness; his works, my works; his
deserts, my deserts; 1 Cor. 1. 30.
his merits, my merits; and his precious blood a full satisfaction for all my
sins.

O but God is a just God! thou say, and therefore in justice must needs
condemn thee: I grant, Satan, that he is a just God, and therefore he cannot
in justice punish me for my sins, which he has punished already in his own
Son; it is against the law of justice, to punish one fault twice. I was, and
am a great Debtor unto God the Father, but Jesus Christ has paid the debt for
me; and therefore it stands not with the justice of God to require it again.

And therefore, avoid Satan, avoid thou Firebrand of Hell; avoid thou damned
Dog, and tempt me no more; for he that is with me, is mightier then thou,
Even the mighty and victorious Lion of the tribe of of Judah, who has bruised
thy head, and has promised to be with his children to the end of the world.

Avoid therefore, thou Dastard; avoid thou cowardly Soldier; remove thy siege,
and yield the Field won, and get thee packing; or else I will call upon my
grand Captain Christ Jesus, the valiant Michael, who beat thee in Heaven, and
threw thee down to Hell, with all thy Hellish train, and Devilish crew.

She had scarcely pronounced these last words, but she fell suddenly into a
swee^redge^ smiling laughter, saying, Now he is gone, now he is gone: Do you
not see him flee like ^redge^ Coward, and run away like a beaten Cock? He
has lost the field, and I have won the victory, even the Garland and Crown
of everlasting life; and that not by mine own power, and strength, but by the
power and might of Jesus Christ, who has sent his holy Angels to keep me.

And speaking to them that were by, she said, Oh would to God you saw but what
I see: For behold, I see infinite Millions of most glorious Angels stand about
me, with fiery Chariots ready to defend me, as they did the good Prophet
Elisha. These holy Angels, these ministering Spirits, are appointed by God to
carry my soul into the Kingdom of Heaven, where I shall behold the Lord face
to face, and shall see him, not with other, but with these same eyes.

Now I am happy and blessed for ever, for I have fought the good fight, and by
the might of Christ, have won the victory -- From henceforth is laid up for me
a Crown of life, etc.

And in this comfortable assurance of Gods mercy and favor toward her in
Christ, she persevered even to her last gasp; as is further showed in that
Discourse of her life and death formerly mentioned.

Another comfortable Example of one terrified in Conscience for sin; who from
the consideration of what mercy and pardon God requires from man to man,
concluded much more Gods unspeakable mercy, and pardon toward himself.
Related by Mr. Bolton, in his Instructions for the right comforting of
Afflicted Consciences, page 345, etc.
THere was (says he) a certain man, who being terrified in Conscience for
sin, resolved speedily to return to the ways of God.

But the cry of his good fellow Companions, strength of Corruption, and cunning
of Satan, carry him back to his former courses; a good number of years after,
he was so thoroughly wounded, that whatsoever came of him, he would never
return again unto folly. Then comes into his mind the first of the Proverbs,
whence he thus reasoned against himself: So many years ago God called, and
stretched out his hand in mercy, but I refused; and therefore now, though I
call upon him, he will not answer; though I seek him early, I shall not find
him. Whereupon his heart was filled with much grief, terror and slavish fear.

But the Spirit of God leading him at length to that place, Luke 17. 4. If thy
Brother trespass against thee seven times in ^redge^ day, and seven times in a
day turn again unto thee, saying, I repent; thou shall forgive him: He thence
happily argued thus for himself; Must I, a silly, sinful man, forgive my
Brother, as often as he repents? And will not then the Father of mercies, and
God of all comfort, entertain me, seeking again, in truth, his face, and
favor? God forbid. From which he blessedly drew such a deal of divine
sweetness, and secret sense of Gods love, that his trembling heart at first
received some good satisfaction, and afterward was settled in a sure and
glorious peace.

Another comfortable Example of one recovered, and cured, that upon a
supposition of Gods irrevocable Decree passed upon him, could not for a long
time be persuaded to make use of any means for his souls good. Related by
diverse Authors.
THere was one See Mr. Henry Morley in Mat. 8. 2, etc. of the cleansing of the
Leper, page 130. etc.
Ludovicus, an Italian, who never considering the order, and causes of our
salvation, grew at last to that desperate Conclusion (which many Atheists and
profane Wretches in these days seem to have learned of him) in having this
speech commonly in his mouth, If I am predestined, I am sure to be saved; if
not, do what I can, I am sure to be damned. In which his wicked assertion, he
continued a long time, till at length he grew dangerously sick; whereupon he
sent for a learned and cunning Physician, to request his advice and help: The
Physician being made acquainted with his former assertion, how he would usually
say, If I am saved, I am saved, etc. he likewise directed his Speech to the
same purpose, and said unto him, Sir, it shall be needless to minister any
physic unto you, or to use means for your recovery, neither do I purpose to
take any such course; for if the time of your death be not come, you have no
cause to fear, you shall live, and do well enough without physic; and if
the time of your death be come, all the physic in the world will not help
you because it is impossible to avoid it. Ludovicus musing in his bed of the
strange speech which the Physician used, and having considered a while
advisedly of it, began to see his own folly, and to find by reason, that as
means was to be used for the health of the body, so God also had ordained
means for the health of the soul: Whereupon he reversed ^ledge^ former
opinion, took physic, and so was cured both in his body and soul at one
time.

Another comfortable Example of Gods extraordinary providence and mercy toward
a poor soul, that had long doubted of her salvation. Related by Mr. Yates, in
Gods Arraignment of Hypocrites, page 357.
THere was a virtuous Gentlewoman in this Land, which doubting very often of
her salvation, made her case known to a worthy Minister of Gods Word, who
often counseled her, to take heed of inquiry further then Gods Word; and to
trust assuredly, that she might conclude her salvation out of Gods Word,
without any further revelations: yet still did the temptation grow upon her,
insomuch, that having a Venice Glass in her hand, and the selfsame Minister
sitting by her, presently she breaks forth into lamentable words; You have
often told me (said she) that I must seek no further then Gods Word; but I have
been long without comfort, and can endure no longer: therefore if I must be
saved, let this Glass be kept from breaking; and so she threw it against the
Wall: (here might the Lords hand, for this tempting of his Majesty, have left
her to the everlasting woes of her distrustful heart; yet the Lord, that is
rich in mercy, having stamped her with the seal of his election, was content
to satisfy her languishing soul with a miracle) The Glass rebounds again,
and comes safe unto the ground; which the Minister having gotten into his
hands, says, Oh repent of this sin, bless God for his mercy; and distrust him
no more of his promise; for now you have his voice from Heaven in a miracle,
telling you plainly of your estate. This was curiosity, and might have brought
despair; yet it was the Lords mercy to remit the fault, and grant an
extraordinary confirmation of her faith.

And every poor despairing soul may make this use of it, to assure them, that
rather then God will suffer those that be his, to be swallowed up in despair,
he will find means, or miracle, to assure them of his mercy.

Another comfortable Example of one whom the Devil sought to bring to despair
of Gods mercy. Related by Mr. Moulins, in his Coal from the Altar.
THere was one (says he) to whom the Devil diverse times suggested thoughts of
Despair; telling him, that his sins were so many, and so great, and God so
just, and sinne-revenging a God, that he could not hope ever to have them
pardoned; and withal showed him a Catalogue of all his sins, that ever he
had committed. With the sight of which, he was at first very much astonished;
but at last, recovering himself, he thus spoke unto him, Satan, this that thou
have showed me, is all true; and I cannot deny, but that I have committed all
these sins: but yet, Satan, there is one thing here wanting, which I would
have thee to write underneath; and that is this;

That the Blood of Jesus Christ, my Savior, has cleansed me from all my
sins.

At the hearing of which, the Devil left him, and he was comforted and
confirmed in the assurance of Gods mercy toward him.

Another comfortable Example, showing, how Gods child may, in such Distresses,
even challenge God to make good his promises of mercy to his penitent soul.
Set down by G. Abbot, Doctor of Divinity, in the Preface before the
Examination, Arraignment, and Conviction of George Sprot, Notary in Ayemouth,
page 23.
THere was (says he) a Scottish Penitent, who a little before his execution,
freely confessed his fault, To the shame of himself (as he said) and to the
shame of the Devil, but to the glory of God. Yea, he acknowledged it to be so
heinous, and horrible, that had he a thousand lives, and could he die ten
thousand deaths, he could not not make satisfaction. Notwithstanding (said he)
Lord, thou have left me this comfort in thy Word, that thou have said, Come
unto me all ye that be weary, and heavy laden, and I will refresh you: Lord, I
am weary; Lord, I am heavily laden with my sins, which are innumerable; I am
ready to sink (Lord) even unto Hell, unless thou in thy mercy put to thine
hand, and deliver me. Lord, thou have promised by thine own Word, out of thine
own mouth, That thou will refresh the weary soul: And with that he thrust out
one of his hands, and reaching as high as he could, with a loud voice, and
strained, cried, I challenge thee Lord, by that Word, and by that promise which
thou have made, that thou perform, and make it good unto me, who now call for
ease and mercy at thy hands, etc.

And agreeable to this, was that which Saint Augustine, in his Lib. 5. cap. 9.
Confessions, reports of his Mother Monica, who very often and earnestly prayed
unto God for him, when he was an Heretic.

Lord (says he) she urged thee with thine own Chirographa tua ingerebat tibi.
handwriting; she challenged in an humble and fearful confidence, the
performance of thine own obligations.

And in the like manner may every distressed soul (which can make good the Sea
Mr. Edw. Reynolds ^erm. on 2 Cor. 7. 1. page 350. And on Eccles. 1. 14. page
31. And Mr. Boltons Instruct. for comforting afflicted Conscienc. page 397.
etc. Mat. 5. 6.
Condition annexed to any of Gods gracious promises, made unto them in Christ)
with a holy humility, even challenge God to make good that promise unto them.
As thus, Lord, thou have promised in thy Word, that those which hunger and
thirst after righteousness, shall be filled.

Thou have promised, Esaias 55. 7.
That those which will forsake their wicked ways and return unto thee, shall
find mercy at thy hands, and that thou will abundantly pardon them, and the
like.

Lord, I am such a one, I do hunger and thirst after righteousness; I do
desire with my heart to forsake all my former sinful courses of life, and to
return unto thee, as a true penitent soul should do.

And therefore (Lord) I challenge thee by that Word, and that promise of thine
which thou have made, that thou perform, and make it good unto me.

THE END.

suddenly, as his present necessity does require.

THE Sick Souls Spiritual Songs.
SAint Jam. 5. 13.
James his advice is, That if any be afflicted, he should pray; if any be
merry, that he should sing. And therefore it may seem strange to one that

of singing to such ^ledge^d and sorrowful souls.

But having found by experience, that ^ledge^any such distressed souls (when
they have ^ledge^eene left to themselves, and to their own ^ledge^hoyce) have
desired (in the intermission ^ledge^f their fits) to spend their time in
singing, ^ledge^ather then in any other exercise: Yea, and ^ledge^aving met
with some which (at such times) ^ledge^ould seldom pray, but in Meter:
There^ledge^ore for their sakes have I made this col^ledge^ection following, of
such Psalms, and Spi^ledge^ituall Songs, as may be of most use for ^ledge^hem
at such times.

The Psalms are,
THe sixth Psalm. The thirteenth Psalm. The two and twentieth Psalm. The one

The other Spiritual Songs are,
THe Lamentation of a Sinner. The Humble suite of a Sinner. The Complaint of a

THE END.
GROUNDS OF COMFORT, For the Friends of the DISTRESSED: IN CASE, That after all
these, or other means used, God send him not Release, or Comfort, but suffers
him to dye in that Distressed estate, and that after some fearful manner.

JOB 13. 15. Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him.

LONDON, Printed for RICHARD ROYSTON.

M. DC. L.

Grounds of Comfort FOR The Friends of the Distressed.
The things which may comfort the Friends of the Distressed in this case, are
either more general, or such as respect some particular estate, wherein the
Distressed Party may dye, and depart this World.

SECT. I.
Wherein the more general comforts are set down.

THE which are these;

1. They must know, that no man can judge of the final estate of any man, by
any outward things, whether they be blessings, or judgments, whether they
befall him in life, or death: For (as Solomon says) all things (that Eccles.
9. 2.
is, all outward things) come alike to all; and the same condition (in respect
of them) is to the just, and the wicked; to the good, and to the pure, and to
the polluted; and to him that sacrifices, and to him that sacrifices not; as
is the good, so is the Sinner; he that swears, and he that fears an oath.

2. They must know, that All things work together for good, to those that love
God: for so does Saint Paul assure us. And if all Romans 8. 28. See BB. Cowper in
loc.
things, then even death it self, be the manner of it what it will be.

3. They must know, that it is not death, no nor the manner of it, be it what
it will be, that can Separate Gods child from the love of God in Christ; for so
the same Apostle is persuaded, and no doubt but he would have Romans 8. 38, etc.
us be persuaded of it too.

4. They must know, that God will not judge his child according to that he is
in the particular instant of his death, but according to that he has been, or
has desired, and endeavored to be, in the general course of his life. And
therefore See Mr. Perkins Works in fol. vol. 1. page 492. col. 2. b. Mr.
Greenhams Works in fol. page 9. Mr. Boltons Instruct. for comforting of
afflicted Consciences, page 230.
we are not to mistrust Gods mercy in death, be it never so uncomfortable, if
it has been before, in any time of our life, sealed up unto us in our
vocation, and sanctification.

5. They must know, that all kinds of death, be they what they will be, which
may betide Gods child, are determined and appointed by God, and that for ends
seeming best to his infinitely-wise, and ever blessed Majesty. It may be for
the glory of his justice to See Mr. Bolton, ubi supra, page 458, etc. Dr.
Denisons Monument, or Tombe-stone, page 65.
harden those about him, who were so far from being won by his godly life,
that they rather hated him, and it; and therefore now seeing such an end of it,
may hate it the more. It may be for the glory of his mercy to his child's soul;
that having tasted so deeply of this bitter cup in the end of his life, he may
be the better prepared to drink the more sweetly and fully of the Well of
life, and of those Rivers of endless pleasures with him in Heaven. For an
immediate translation from the depth of temporary horror, to the height of
endless joy, makes even the joys of Heaven something more joyful to a
blessed soul.

Whatsoever Gods ends are herein (for his counsels are inscrutable, and his
ways past finding out) let it suffice you, that your Friend in this end of his
life, and manner of his death, does glorify God, as being serviceable to those
ends for which he had ordained it.

SECT. II.
Wherein are particular Comforts set down; and first, in case the Distressed
Person should dye seemingly despairing.

FOr it is true, that not only wicked persons, and loose livers, may despair
in death; but also (to man's seeming) even See Mr. Hierons Works in fol. vol.
1. page 617, etc. Mr. Perkins his Works in fol. vol. 1. page 492. col. 1. a.
and d. and page 378. col. 1. b. etc.
repentant Sinners and the dear Children of God: For even these, after long
and grievous perplexities, seeking and laboring for release, and finding none,
have (many of them) condemned themselves, and pronounced against themselves,
that they are the very Firebrands of Hell, and cannot be saved; nay, many times
have died too with speeches in their mouths, which much savor of Despair.

And yet we must not doubt for all this, but that the child of God, most dear
unto him, may, through this gulf of Desperation, attain to everlasting
happiness; for many of the works of our infinitely wise God, are done in and
See BB. Cowper in Romans 8. 28. Lorin. in Acta Apost. page 358. col. 2. c.
by their contraries.

Thus in the Creation all things were made, not of Something, but of Nothing,
clean contrary to the course of nature. So in the work of Redemption, God
gives ^ledge^fe, not by life, but by death; for out of ^ledge^s Sons accursed
death, does he bring us ^ledge^fe, and eternal happiness. And this too
^ledge^ Gods manner of dealing many times in ^ledge^e work of our salvation,
for when God will send his own Servants to Heaven, he ^ledge^ends them, many
times, a clean contrary way, even See Mr. Perkins, ubi supra, vol. 1 page 492.
col. 1. c.
by the gates of Hell.

Again, we may here take notice of this for our comfort, that God may have, by
^ledge^is blessed Spirit, a secret influence, and sa^ledge^ing work upon the
soul of his child, when ^ledge^here is Esaias 50. 10. See Mr. Goodwins Sermons
in loc. Mr. Bolton, ubi supra, page 438.
no light, nor feeling of his favor ^ledge^t all Idem, ibid. page 521.
. The Sun (we know) though he leave his light upon the face of the earth, yet
notwithstanding descends, by a real, effectual influence, into the bosom,
and darkest bowels thereof, and there exercises a most excellent work in
begetting Metals, Gold, and Silver, and other precious things; and so it is
proportionably in this present point.

A poor soul may lie grovelling in the dust, afflicted and tossed with
tempests of most hideous and fearful temptations; yea, and even despairing
too, ever to find mercy at the hands of God, and yet may blessedly partake
still of the sweet influence of Gods everlasting love, of a secret saving work
of grace, and Almighty support of the sanctifying Spirit.

Again, we may here take notice of thi^redge^ for our comfort, that Gods child
may fo^redge^ a long time live, yea, and dye too withou^redge^ any sense, and
feeling of Gods love, and favor toward him in Christ, and yet without any See
Mr. Chibald in his trial of faith, lib. 2. chap. 4. page 185, and 187. Rogers
of Dedham, in his doctrine of faith. Epist. ad Lector. page penult.
prejudice at all to his eternal salvation. For a man is justified by faith,
and not by feeling; and saved by believing, and not by joy, and peace in
believing: And therefore if a man See Mr. Schudders Christians daily walk, page
594. M. Throgmorton of faith, page 194.
have faith, though h^redge^ have little, or no feeling, he may be sure enough
of his salvation indeed, though no^redge^ in his own apprehension.

Lastly, we must here also know, and tak^redge^ notice of this for our comfort,
that thoug^redge^ Gods child in this his last and final Despair, may seem to
let go all his hold o^redge^ God, and his mercies in Christ; yet Go^redge^ may
not have let go his hold of him. Fo^redge^ there are Vide Rolloc. in Joan.
cap. 15. and cap. 10. ibid. BB. Ushers Sermon on 1 Cor. 10. 17. page 19. etc.
two bonds, by which those tha^redge^ are Gods children, are tied to Christ
thei^redge^ Head, and Savior; the one is the bond o^redge^ Gods Spirit; the
other is the bond of thei^redge^ own faith: By their faith they lay hold
o^redge^ Christ, and he holds them by his Spirit Now though the faith of Gods
child weakened, and sorely wounded in this spiritual^redge^ conflict, may to it
self, and to the bystanders apprehension, seem to have lost hi^redge^
hold-fast of Christ, and thereupon conceiv^redge^ and imagine, that all help
and hope i^redge^ gone; and so both live dejectedly, and dye uncomfortably: as
if none of all the promises of mercy made unto the Believer in Gods Book, nor
any drop of Christ's blood did belong unto him. Yet here is his comfort, that
Christ, by his Spirit, does still hold him fast, yea, so fast, that neither
man, nor Devil, nor all the powers of darkness, or gates of Hell, can
possibly pluck him out of ^ledge^is hand. And therefore we may safely conclude,
that Despair, whether it arise of weakness of nature, or of conscience for
^ledge^inne (though it fall out about the time of death) cannot prejudice the
salvation of ^ledge^hose that are effectually called.

Secondly, in case the Distressed Person should dye raving, and blaspheaming.
FOr even these too may betide the dear child of God; being either effects of
^ledge^ch bodily diseases, as they are subject to, ^ledge^s well as others; or
coming from Satan, working in, and by such diseases, through Gods permission.

First, such ravings, and blaspheamings in Gods dying child, may be the effects
of ^ledge^ome See M. Hieron, vol. 1. page 657. Dr. Gouges Arrows, p. 21.
bodily disease that has seized upon ^ledge^im; as of phrensy, and madness,
the cho^ledge^r then flying up into the brain, and distracting him, so that he
may neither know what he says, or does.

And if they proceed from hence, then our comfort in respect of our diseased
Friend, who dyed with such ravings, and blaspheamings in his mouth, may be this:

That (seeing these things happening at the time of his death, came not from
him, but from his disease) they are not to be ascribed to him, but to his
disease; for so will God do, and so must man do too; especially, if he have
given any good testimony of holiness in former times; yea, but of the desire
of grace, and that in the intermission of his fits; for even upon these grounds
(as weak as they are) Divines Perkins, vol. 1. page 492. col. 1. d. etc. and
page 468. col. 1. a. Schudder, ubi supra, page 491.
o^redge^ best note for skill in the art of right comforting afflicted
Consciences, have concluded, that such an uncomfortable en^redge^ will neither
prejudice that man's salvatio^redge^ before God which so dies; neither
ough^redge^ it to be a blemish to his reputation amongs^redge^ men, when he is
dead.

Secondly, such ravings and blaspheamings in Gods dying child, may come
fro^redge^ Satan, working in, and by the disease tha^redge^ has seized on him.
And if they do com^redge^ from hence, we have this comfort still i^redge^
respect of our deceased Friend, that Go^redge^ has not imputed them unto him,
but wi^redge^ impute them unto Satan, from whom the^redge^ ^ledge^oceeded; our
Friend being at the time of ^ledge^e commission of them, wholly passive,
^ledge^her then any way active in them; and ^ledge^erefore these cannot be his,
but Satan's ^ledge^sonall sins; and being so, they shall ^ledge^ set upon his
score, and he must answer ^ledge^ them.

^ledge^irdly, in case the Distressed Person should be the Author of his own
death; and either by hanging, drowning, stabbing, or some such other way, do
make himself away.
^ledge^Or even this too may betide the dear ^ledge^ child of God, if God
should leave him ^ledge^he fury of some phrentique disease, ex^ledge^ity of
melancholy, height of distress Conscience, or to Satan's power and ^ledge^ice
working in and by any of these.

^ledge^ut how to find comfort for such a sad ^ledge^dent as this, I confess
it has stumbled ^ledge^y worthy Divines, and others; and ^ledge^ amongst them
I find some grounds of ^ledge^fort, even for this, which I may not
^ledge^ceale.

^ledge^he first is taken from the infinite, and ^ledge^mprehensible mercy of
God, who is not ^ledge^ to any time, or means, but may show ^ledge^y in a
moment, and give repentance in ^ledge^very instant of death.

The second is taken from the cause and occasion that instigated, and set
forward the Party to commit this unnatural, inhumane, and fearful act upon
himself; for if it were extremity of melancholy, or some phrentique
distemperature occasioned by sickness of body, or some inextricable perplexity
arising from distress of Conscience, or Satan working in and by all these; the
Party himself being by any, or all these deprived of reason, judgment,
free-election, present support of grace, and hope o^redge^ any future comfort:
See M. Charles Richardson of Peter's, and Judas repentance, page 229. Mr. Sims
his life's preservative, page 288. etc. Mr. Burtons Mela^redge^cholly, page 188.
Abernethy physic for the soul, page 403.
All Divines gran^redge^ that their case is rather to be pitied of al^redge^
then to be rashly and uncharitably censure^redge^ of any.

And some go further, judging the be^redge^ of them, and that upon these
grounds;

1. Because (wanting free-election ^redge^ themselves, and being in a state
where^redge^ they know not what they did) the acti^redge^ is not to be reputed
as done by them, but mere involuntary act (through the violen^redge^ of their
disease, or inextricable perplexity their Distress, or Satan's mischievous and
m^redge^licious cooperation with both) extorted fro^redge^ them.

2. Because some after the attempt this self-destroying act made, being
throu^redge^ Gods gracious providence and mercy toward them, saved and
preserved from it, See Mr. Burtons Melancholy, p. 543. See my sick Souls
Presidents, page 14.
have come again to themselves, and soundly repented of it, and lived a holy
and gracious life ever afterward.

And 3. Because even this act clad with ^ledge^he former circumstances, and
being in Gods child but a sin of infirmity, though ^ledge^e live not actually
to repent him of it, shall ^ledge^ndoubtedly by a See M. Hookers Sermon on Hab.
1. 4. page 22. Dr. Saundersons Sermon. on Genesis 20. 6. page 89. Perkins Works,
vol. 2. page col. 1. d.
general habitual repentance, and Gods gracious acceptance thereof, be
pardoned by the passion of Christ, and buried for ever in his bloody
^ledge^eath.

The third and last is taken from the qua^ledge^y, and condition of the Party
himself, ^ledge^at has done this act: For if he have ^ledge^ene one, that in
his life time has given ^ledge^me good testimony of his gracious estate,
^ledge^d of being the child of God, we must not ^ledge^dge the worse of him for
this his manner ^ledge^ death. For that last and unreversable ^ledge^ome, at
the dreadful Tribunal of the ^ledge^er-living God, shall not pass upon us
ac^ledge^rding to the violent, and involuntary Di^ledge^mpers and acts, at our
last hour, and in^ledge^nt of death, but according to the former ^ledge^full,
or sanctified courses of our life; and ^ledge^erefore we are to hope well of
him too, ^ledge^twithstanding this.

SECT. III.
Wherein are set down some memorable examples of each particular, and the
judgment of learned and approved Divines touching them.

OF the two first, we have the examples of one Mr. Chambers of Leicester, and
of Francis Spira.

The Sea the Book written of his death.
former of which in his sickness^redge^ grievously despaired, and cried out,
Tha^redge^ he was damned and so dyed.

And the Sea the history, and relation of Francis Spira his miserable life, and
desperate death, set out by several men.
latter, even upon his bed o^redge^ death, did so rave under the sense of
hi^redge^ own sins, and Gods just desertion of hi^redge^ for them, that he
often cried out, utterin^redge^ these, and the like ruefull expressions of
hi^redge^ desperate and damnable estate; Oh that ^redge^ were gone from hence,
that some body wou^redge^ let out this weary soul! I tell you, there w^redge^
never such a Monster as I am; never w^redge^ there man alive a spectacle of
such exceedi^redge^ misery -- I now feel Gods heavy wrat^redge^ that burns
like the torments of Hell with^redge^ me, and afflicts my soul with pangs
unutter^redge^ble: Verily Desperation is Hell it self -- The gnawing worm of
unquenchab^redge^ fire, horror, confusion, and which is worst ^redge^ all,
Desperation it self continually tortur^redge^ me: And now I count my present
estate worse, then if my soul separated from my body, were with Judas; and
therefore I desire rather to be there, then thus to live in my body -- The
truth is, never had mortal man such experience of Gods anger, and hatred
against sin, as I have -- If I could conceive but the least spark, or hope in
my heart of a better state hereafter, I would not refuse to endure the most
heavy wrath of the great God, yea for 2000 years, so that at length I might
attain out of misery -- He professed, that his pangs were such, as that the
damned wights in Hell endure not the like misery. That his estate was worse
then that of Judas, and Cain, and therefore desired to dye; with diverse other
such like ^ledge^peeches.

And yet of both these, Mr. Perkins, that ^ledge^ound and judicious Divine,
judges the ^ledge^est, and persuades others to do the ^ledge^ike.

Touching Mr. Chambers, In his Declaration of Spiritual Desertions.
his words are ^ledge^hese, Though he thus grievously despaired in ^ledge^eath,
yet it is not for any to note him with the ^ledge^lack mark of a Reprobate. One
thing which ^ledge^e spoke in his extremity (viz. Oh that I had ^ledge^ut one
drop of faith!) must move all men ^ledge^o conceive well of him: For by this it
seems ^ledge^hat he had an heart which desired to repent, ^ledge^nd believe,
and therefore had a repenting and believing heart indeed. For God at all times,
but especially in temptation, of his great mercy accepts of the will for the
deed. Neither is it to be regarded, that he said, he was damned; for men in
such cases speak not as they are, but as they feel themselves to be.

And as touching Francis Spira, the same Upon the Crced. Article of the Church.
Mr. Perkins says thus, It may be demanded, whether the common judgment given
of Francis Spira, that he is a Reprobate, be good, or no?

Answ: We may with better In rerum judicio debet aliquis niti ad hoc, ut
interpretetur unumquodque secundum quod est: in judicio autem personarum, ut
interpretetur in melius. Aquin. 2. 2 ae. quaest. 60. art. 4. ad 3. Semper
quicquid dubium est, humanitas inclinat in melius. Senec. Epist. 81.
warrant say* No, then any man can say Yea: For what gifts of discerning had
they, which came to visit him in his extremity? And what reasons induce^redge^
them to give this peremptory judgment? He said himself, that he was a
Reprobate: Tha^redge^ is nothing; a sick man's judgment of himself^redge^ is
not to be regarded. Yea, but he despaired: A senseless reason: For so does
many a man^redge^ year by year, and that very often, as deeply as ever Spira
did, and yet by the good help of the Ministry of the Word, both are, and may
be recovered. And they which will avouch Spira to be a Reprobate; must go
further, and prove two things; that he despaired both wholly, and finally;
which if they cannot prove; we for our parts must suspend our judgments and
they were much to blame that first published the Book.

And again, speaking of the same, h^redge^ ^ledge^ith In his estate of a
Christian in this life.
in another place, thus:

Francis Spira after his Apostasy despaired; ^ledge^et they are much
overseene, that write of him ^ledge^s a damned Creature: For first, who can
tell ^ledge^hether he despaired finally, or no? Secondly, ^ledge^ the very
midst of his desperation, he com^ledge^lained of the hardness of his heart,
which ^ledge^ade him that he could not pray. No doubt then he felt his hardness
of heart; and the feeling of corruption in the heart, is by some contrary
grace: So that we may conveniently think, that he was not quite bereft of all
goodness, though he never felt in then, nor showed it to the Beholders.

And of the third, and last particular, we have the example of Judge Hales in
our See Mr. Fox, his Book of Martyrs, page 1393.
own Stories; who having for fear consented to the Bishops in Queen Mary's
days, in some thing contrary to his conscience, was afterward so troubled in
conscience for it, that he would have killed himself with his penknife, had
he not been prevented: But he could never be at rest, till he had drowned
himself in a little brook near to his house.

And yet even of him (says See M. Charles Richardson, of Peter's and Judas
repentance, page 279.
a good Divine) we are not altogether to despair of his salvation; for no man
knows whether God that shows mercy in a Inter pontem and fontem. August.
moment, did give him repentance in the instant of his death. The judgments of
God are secret, and unsearchable; we cannot comprehend the unmeasurable depth
Romans 11. 23.
of his mercy, and therefore we should leave the final judgment of these
cases, to his determination, who is ordained of God to be the Judge Acts 10. 42.
both of quick and dead.

SECT. IV.
I Will conclude all with the Christian, and charitable judgments, and
opinions of some worthy Divines touching these cases.

What (says Mr. Greenham) if you should In his grave counsels, and godly
observations, page 9.
dye in this dis-comfort? For my part (as I my self look for no great things
in my death) I would not think more hardly of you, neither would I wish any to
judge otherways of Gods child in that state of death. For we shall not be
judged according to that particular instant of death, but according to our
general course of life; nor according to our deed in that present, but
according to the desire of our hearts ever before. And therefore we are not to
mistrust Gods mercy in death, be we never so uncomfortable, if so be it has
been before sealed up in our vocation, and sanctification.

The common opinion is (says Mr. Perkins) In his salve for a sick man.
that if a man dye quietly, and go away like a Lamb (which in some diseases,
as Consumptions, and such like, any man may do) then he goes straight to
Heaven: But when the violence of the disease stir up impatience, and cause
frantic behaviors, then men use to say, there is a judgment of God, serving
either to discover an Hypocrite, or to plague a wicked man.

But the truth is otherways; for indeed a Job 21. 23, 25.
man may dye like a Lamb, and yet go to Hell; and one dying in exceeding
torments, and strange behaviors of the body, may go to Heaven.

Yea, to go further (says he) when a Professor In his declaration of
spiritual desertions.
of the Gospel shall make away himself, though it be a fearful case, yet
still the same opinion must be carried. For first, Gods judgments are very
secret. Secondly, they may repent in the very agony, for any thing we know.
Thirdly, none is able to comprehend the bottomless depth of the graces, and
mercies which are in Christ.

There be some (says Mr. Richardson) that Ubi supra.
in phrensy, and distraction of their brain, do make away themselves: who,
howsoever they may be blamed for other sins formerly committed by them; yet
in this case they are rather to be pitied, then rashly censured: for they have
not free election, and therefore the action is not to be reputed as done by
them. Again, we are to consider the whole course of their former life, and to
judge according to that. Indeed, if their life had been wretched, and ungodly,
and they dye in this manner, there is great cause to doubt of their estate. But
if they have Prorsus confirmo, audeo dicere, non potest male mori, qui been
vixit. August. de Discipline. Christian. In his Book of Melancholy, page 543.
lived in the fear of God, and have given testimony of their godliness in the
former course of their lives, we are to hope well of them, whatsoever their end
be.

If a man (says Mr. Burton) do put desperate hands upon himself by occasion
of madness, or melancholy, if he have given testimony before of his
regeneration; in regard he does this not so much out of his will, as By the
force and violence of his disease.
ex vi morbi; we must make the best construction of it, as Busbequius.
Turks do, that think all fools and mad men go directly to Heaven.

There are some (says Mr. Sims) that are In his life's preservative.
selfe-killers, which are not selfe-murtherers; of which sort are these poor
distressed souls of which we speak.

This only let me add (says Mr. Burton) ubi supra, page 188.
that in some cases those hard censures of such as offer violence to their own
persons, are to be mitigated; as in such as are mad, beside themselves, or
known to have been long melancholy, and that in extremity they know not what
they do, deprived of judgment, reason, and all: As a Ship that is void of a
Pilot, must needs impinge upon the next rock, or sands, and suffer shipwreck.
And indeed good reason we have to be thus charitable toward such; For who
knows, how he himself may be ^ledge^empted? It is his case to day, it may be
thine if God leave thee to thy self, to the Devil, ^ledge^ to a melancholy
fit) to morrow. Charity ^ledge^ill judge the best. God be merciful unto us
^ledge^ll.

fain would (in confidence of this thy gracious promise) come unto thee for
ease, and comfort; but (he) is so Or she.
over-laden with the sight of (his) own Or her.
sins, and the sense of thy wrath due unto (him) for them, that (he) cannot
Or her. Or she.
stir. O do thou then (which have borne our infirmities, and carried our
sorrows) take this heavy burden from (him) and that (he) may be as able Or
her. Or she. Or she.
to go, as thou art willing (he) should come unto thee: Do thou (O blessed
Savior) quicken (him) by thy Or her.
Spirit, strengthen (him) with thy grace, Or her.
enlarge (his) heart with thy love; and Or her.
in case all other helps fail, even draw (him) unto thee. Or her.


Lastly (O sweet Savior) thou art the true light, which lightneth every one
that comes into the world; yea, thou art that Sun of righteousness, which
brings light even to those that sit in darkness, and in the shadow of death!
Behold here such a dark, sad, sorrowful soul, which needs the comfort of
such a Heavenly light. O do thou then which art the Sun of righteousness,
cause the bright beams of thy favor to shine upon (him) open (his) eyes that
(he) may see Or her. Or her. Or she. Or she.
it; cheer up (his) drooping spirits, that (he) may rejoice in it, and so
continue this thy mercy and favor to (him) that no cloud of distruct arising
Or her. Or her.
from (his) own faithless heart, may hide it; nor any other thing interposed
by Satan's subtilty, may from hence forward ever eclipse it again unto (him.)
Or her.


And O thou holy and unsearchable Spirit of God, which art the only Comforter
of Gods Elect, be thou the Comfort, and Comforter of this thy Distressed
Servant: Thou were pleased to come down on Jesus Christ, the Son of God, in
the likeness of a Dove; Oh come thou down in like manner on this thy poor
distressed Servant; that so thou may, either with Christ's Dove, assure (him)
that Or her.
(he) is the (Son) of God, in whom Or she. Or Daughter, Or Child.
he is well pleased through him; or at least, with Noah's Dove, thou may bring
(him) the Olive Branch of peace; Or her.
and withal bring (him) word, that Or her.
the waters of affliction, wherein the wearied Arc of (his) soul has been Or
her.
so long tossed, are now abated.

Thou were pleased again, at the first to be given, and afterward to descend
in a visible manner on the Apostles; O be thou pleased to be given thus, and
thus to descend into the sad and sorrowful soul of thy Servant, fot (his)
comfort at this time. Or her.


Thou were first given unto them by breathing; O do thou breath then
^ledge^nto this breathless soul, that has ^ledge^n (himself) out of breath
in fol^ledge^owing Or her self.
thee in the unsearchable ways of thy providence, that breath of life, which
may put (him) in breath again, Or her.
^ledge^o follow thee, howsoever thou seem ^ledge^o run from (him.) Or her.


Thou did descend on them, secondly, in the sound of a mighty rushing wind,
and in the likeness of fiery tongues; O do thou descend in like manner on
this thy poor distressed Servant, at this time.

(He) is deaf, yea, like the deaf Adder, Or she.
that stops (his) ears at all Or her.
that may be for (his) souls comfort: Or her.
O do thou open them, that (he) may Or she.
hear the sound of their feet, that brings (him) glad tidings of peace; Or
her.
yea, and the sound of all those sound comforts for (his) souls comfort, Or
her.
which are set down in thy Word.

(His) own carnal thoughts, and Or her.
strong and strange imaginations, like so many strong holds, are exalted
against thee, and thy work of comfort in (his) heart. Or her.


The clouds of error arising out of (his) depraved understanding, do Or her.
darken unto (him) the Sun of righteousness, Or her.
which was wont to shine so so cheerfully into (his) soul. Or her.


The fogges of noisome desires do put (his) will into such a mist, that (he)
Or her. Or she.
knows not where, or which way to go for comfort.

The heat of (his) present felt Distress, Or her.
has so scorched, parched, and even dried up (his) soul, that (he) is Or her.
Or she.
ready to dye for want of something to cool it.

Yea, so averse and backward is (he) in all things that may be for (his) Or
she. Or her. Or she. Or she.
Souls good, that further then (he) is driven (he) will not go to seek for
any comfort, nor so much as accept of it, when it is offered unto (him.) Or her.


O thou then which descendest in a mighty, and powerful wind; do thou with
the mighty, and powerful wind of thy grace, throw down all those strong
holds in (him) which are exalted Or her.
against thee. Do thou chase away all those clouds of error, which
dar^ledge^en (his) understanding. Do thou Or her.
^ledge^eare (his) will of all those fogges and Or her.
^ledge^ists of noisome desires, which do ^ledge^ake (him) doubtful which way
to Or her.
^ledge^ake for (his) souls comfort. Do Or her.
^ledge^hou cool and refresh (his) parched, Or her.
^ledge^nd scorched heart, which is ready to dye for heat. Yea, do thou so
fill ^ledge^he sails of (his) affections, that (he) Or her. Or she.
may (though unwillingly) be driven at the last into that Haven of rest, where
(his) soul would be. Or her.


Again, (his) heart and tongue are Or her.
grown so cold in zeal, that neither can (his) heart meditate, nor (his) Or
her. Or her.
tongue utter any prayer unto thee for comfort.

(His) understanding, that was wont Or her.
to conceive; and (his) affections, that Or her.
were wont to prosecute the best things, are now so darkened, and cooled in
(him) that it is even a pain, Or her.
and grief unto (him) so much as to Or her.
think, much less to prosecute any such things.

Yea, so much dross of sinful corruption, does not only stick unto, but is
even incorporated into all the powers and faculties both of his soul Or her.
and body, that (he) fears to be Or she.
rejected of thee, as Reprobate Silver.

O thou then which descendest also in the likeness of fiery tongues, be thou a
fire in (his) heart and tongue, to Or her. Or her. Or her. Or her.
make (him) more Zealous and fervent in (his) prayers: Be thou a fire in (his)
understanding, to enlighten the darkness of it: Be thou a fire in (his)
affections, Or her.
to inflame the coldness of them: Yea, be thou a fire in (his) Or her.
whole man, both soul and body, to sever for the present, and in thy good time
to consume the drossy and sinful corruptions of both.

And now, O Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, the three persons of the
ever-blessed Trinity, which all joined together to make man at the first; join
all your forces together again to remake this poor dejected soul, a worm, and
no man; or if any (in (his) own apprehension) Or her.
the worst of men.

And for this end, O Omnipotent ^ledge^ather, do thou contribute thy power
^ledge^o support his weakness: O infinitely Or her.
^^ledge^ise Son, do thou contribute thy ^ledge^isedome, to inform (his)
ignorance: Or her.
^ledge^nd O thou holy and blessed Spirit ^ledge^f God, do thou contribute thy
san^ledge^tity, and all other saving graces, to ^ledge^eform in him what is
amiss through^ledge^ut. Or her.


And unto these, and all thy other ^ledge^lessings bestowed on (him) do thou
Or her.
*O gracious God) in thy good time, ^ledge^dde this one (if it be thy blessed
will) ^ledge^o let (him) see an happy issue, and Or her. Or her.
^ledge^nd of all these (his) troubles; that ^ledge^o (he) for (himself) and we
for (him) Or she. Or her self. Or her.
may praise and glorify thy great, and glorious name for this thy merciful
deliverance of (him.) Or her.


Hear us (O Lord) now praying for (him) hear (him) also (good Or her. Or her.
Lord) both now and at all times praying for (himself) yea, hear Or her self.
both (him) and us, for thy Son Or her.
Christ Jesus his sake, in whom alone we know thou art well pleased; and in
whose name, and in whose words, we conclude all these our imperfect prayers,
saying as he has taught us; Our Father which art in Heaven, etc.

Thy grace, O Lord Jesus Christ; thy love, O heavenly Father; thy comfort and
consolation, O holy and blessed Spirit, be with us all, and especially with
this thy poor distressed Servant, now and for evermore.

AMEN.
What here is good, to God abscribed be*
What is infirm, belongs of right to me*

THE END.
