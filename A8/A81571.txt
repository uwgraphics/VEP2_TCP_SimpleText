A Divine Ode.
Bless us good Lord from that dull Sect which say,
we err in twice repeating, when we pray
Our Father
They count themselves made of the purest clod
and give us lost, forbid it O my God
which art in Heaven,
By them barnes, Stables, and what rooms you see
more then our Churches are esteemed to be
hallowed
The word the word by them, they cry is teach'd,
but grant good God by better Scholars preached
be thy Name.
The way next faith I am addressed to go
is Prayer surely, which must bring me to
Thy Kingdom,
Yet let our Bells ring out, they are forgot,
for to our Common prayers, they will not
come.
When I was blessed from learned Armah to hear
and honored Potter of the self-same Sphere
thy will
Hours were but minutes, but when these persever
in tedious preachments, I think they will never
be done,
Doctrine, and Use, men of a tedious rarity
which both in Church and State requires a parity
in Earth
These we must hear by Inspiration raised,
who most presumptuous think thy name so praised,
as it is in Heaven.
But Lord unto thy Sion be not cruel,
such men as Hooker, Reynolds, Whitegift, Jewel,
give us,
We have a Prideaux, Collins, and so many
their sons, more learned, no Christian Church has any
this day
By whom, if we their gifts do not abhor
we may be well instructed to pray for
our daily bread.
But these the sole Elect, long breathed men
for our sad patience do prolong again
and forgive us
That they speak not of Council, Schoolmen, Father
is not their Ignorance, but rather
our trespasses
Which hinder us from things to be imparted
to none of foul, and so polluted hearted
as we
Their Semigraduats, Pedants, who knows who,
comes up to teach us, thus and then we do
Forgive them
Their first place, last place 15. times said over,
moreover, and besides, and furthermore
that trespass
Upon all Christian patience, must be heard,
or else next time a Sermon is prepared
against us.
And if Episcopacy be put down,
a Tradesman shall step up in every Town
and lead us
But where they know not, nor do greatly care
so they have their opinions, and that Bishops are
not
Good God restore them to their wits, and call
them home, whom their own naught opinions fall
into
And let not thy true Church by such as these
be brought into, through Ignorance and ease,
Temptation.
Let inspired Cobblers, Weavers, lead them still
in their Egyptian darkness, if they will
but deliver us
Who at thy footstool prostrately full bent
and bless our King, our State, and Parliament,
from evil,
And for the Jesuit, Brownist, and who pray
the contrary, let Tybourne be their way
Amen.
A Divine Paternoster.
Bless us good Lord from that blind Sect which say
Full often, but from their hearts can never pray
Our Father
They count themselves of better mould than clod,
and gibe at others: mend them O my God
which art in Heaven,
By them the Coape, and such like toys you see
at Altar-worship, are esteemed to be
hallowed
The word, the word by them they cry is teach't,
but grant good God by better Doctors preached
be thy name.
Faith comes by hearing, without which to go
and say Our Father will not bring me to Romans 10. 17.

Thy Kingdom
Yet let our Bells ring out, they are forgot;
For to a powerful Sermon they will not
Come.
When I was blessed from honored Sibs to hear,
and learned Goodwin of the self-same Sphere
Thy will
Hours were but minutes: but when these deliver
Arminian fables, I think they will never
be done
Doctrine and Use in them work little charity
who charge us to affect an outward purity
in Earth,
Yet these to double Livings still were raised
who by a Cross or Cringe think thy name praised
as it is in Heaven.
But Lo^^ unto thy Sion have regard,
such men as Reynolds, Rogers, Fox and Ward
Give us
We have a Twisse, a Preston, and so many
more learned and godly scarce the world has any
this day
By whom, if we their gifts do not abhor,
we shall be well instructed to pray for
our daily Bre^^
But these incroaching Priests, whose power can
(if you will beleev't) They take upon them to forgive sins, not only
declaratively, and ministerially, but also formally and judicially.
absolve a dying man
and forgive us
That they affect a Schoolman and a Father
more than the Word, is not their worth, but rather
our trespasses
Which have provoked the Lord to hold back much
of his most sacred Oracles from such
as we
Their Chanc'llours, Doctors, Proctors, who knows who
scared us with Ignis fatuus, which we do Their Excommunications.

forgive them
Their Lord deliver us twice four times said over,
and We beseech thee, twenty one times more In the Letany.

that trespass
By undue repetitions, must be heard
or else next time a censure is prepared
against us.
But Lordly Prelates being once put down
sound Pastors shall arise in every Town,
and lead us
True Apostolic Bishops; whose chief care
is well to feed their Flocks, which Prelates are
not
Good Lord restore to men their wits, and call
them home who fond and Popish Tenants fall
into
And let not thy true Church by such as these
be brought into (through Lordlinesse and ease)
Temptation.
If pomp and pleasure they esteem so high,
let them unto Romes strumpet pack and fly,
But deliver us
Who at thy footstool prostrately are bent
to bless our King, our State and Parliament
from evil,
As for the Jesuit, Atheist, and who pray
the contrary, let Tybourne be their way.
Amen.
