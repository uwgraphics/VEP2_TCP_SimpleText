To the Right Honorable, the Knights, Citizens and Burgesses, of the House of
Commons assembled in Parliament, The humble Petition of many godly true-hearted
Protestants, whose names are hereafter mentioned,
Humbly shows,
THat whereas your Petitioners acknowledging with all thankfulness how it has
pleased God to move your hearts to endeavor the expelling and destroying of
sin, Satan, Antichrist and error, and instead of them to receive, embrace,
retain and cherish knowledge, faith, love and obedience, that seeing every one
ought to be fully persuaded in his own mind, without which he can do nothing
of faith, and so lies under sin, do humbly entreat you, that seeing many are
even almost unsettled, by reason that although indeed our faithful Ministers
cry out daily against Brownists and Anabaptists for their judgment, yet will
not dispute the case with them, pretending they are not worthy their dispute:
To which they answer it is because they know they cannot make good their own
praictce from the Word of God, nor can prove their Church, their Ministry,
their Baptism nor their Sabbath to be instituted by God, or owned by Christ and
his Apostles. Of which number if there were only a few ignorant profane
persons, it would not much move us, but that which almost astonisheth us to
think is, that some of them whom we looked on as the most eminent Protestants,
most conscionable frequenters of our Churches, strictest keepers of the
Sabbaths, and most strict in life and conversation, have very lately departed
our Churches, and separated from us, who in former times in the want of such
powerful preaching as we by the good hand of providence by order of this
honorable Assembly have enjoyed now of late in season, and out of season,
whereof they aforesaid being diligent frequenters, have now very lately
departed from us, as though the faithful powerful manifestations of the
truths of God were a special means to cause separation from our Churches, who
upon our earnest desiring them to return to our Churches from their errors,
have seemed to pity us, and praise God for giving them light into those
truths, whereof they were very long ignorant, yet at last to see and understand
his way, that they might practice the same, and walk therein, and tell us,
that if the Lord love us, he will show us the same truth, whereof they being
convinced, dare not but practice. Now seeing we dare not but think that many of
them are very conscious people, although holding diverse errors, as namely, they
deny our Churches, our Ministers, our Baptism and our Sabbath to be of Christ,
or to have any footing in his Word, as also to be unlawful to pay tithes to
any Minister of the Gospel: and indeed we cannot deny but that they always
show themselves very forward and desirous to prove the truth of what they hold
against any Christian or Ministers, the which when some of us have assayed to
bring to pass, in desire to bring their poor erring souls from their
errors, the Ministers have all refused, whereby if not prevented by the power
which the good hand of providence has committed to this honorable Assembly
the poor souls of those already gone astray, are not only like to perish,
but many others are daily in danger to be led into the same error by them,
inasmuch as they are weak, and cannot answer them, and the Ministers either for
want of love will not, or because it is the truth they hold, they dare not
oppose it.

In consideration whereof your humble suppliants entreat this honorable
Assembly, that forasmuch as they do acknowledge their willingness, and would
rejoice at an opportunity to manifest the things which they hold before you, or
your godly Committee, either here or at Guild Hall in London, and are willing,
as they say; through the strength of God, although they be no scholars, yet if
any of the most grave Doctors of the Synod will oppose them before you or your
Committee, they believe that God will enable them either to manifest what they
hold to be the truth of God, or else to be willing thankfully to receive
conviction, and thereupon to renounce any error or errors they hold, and
embrace the truth, and practice the same with us. We therefore humbly entreat
you to call them before you, and let them answer according to their desire,
that so error may be abhorred, and truth embraced inasmuch as they have
declared to us in print, that they abhor all errors which they have light to
discover, as namely universal redemption, free will, falling away, and all
things contrary to wholesome doctrine, whereof you may further examine them. And
further, forasmuch as they, although erring from us in judgment, yet are
forward helpers of the cause of God, and have both in goods and persons helped
forward your designs, and live peaceably with all men, and none of them
chargeable, but generally helpful to the commonwealth, and seeing it is
impossible for the rod to alter the judgment, but is only peculiar to the Word
by the help of the Spirit to do that, and seeing God is a jealous God, and will
not loose his prerogative, nor will have men presume to judge conscience, as he
sets out almost through the whole Chapter, Romans 14. although one Judge quite
contrary to another, as he instanceth both in meats and days, and faith, that
we shall all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, and says, He that
doubts is damned if he eat: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin: and seeing
that they that stand so much to have all brought to one judgment, would be
loath to be enforced to change their own judgments, nay they know they cannot
do it, although they would, for man cannot change his own, and much less
another judgment, for that is only peculiar to God to do by his Word and
Spirit. If they say, it is because theirs is the truth. Is not what every man
judges truth, truth to him, as well as what they judge is to them? And is not
what a man judges unclean, unclean to him? Romans 14. 14. Then remember the
counsel of Christ, namely, Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do
ye even so to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets. Then do as Gods Law
commands, and his Prophets taught. Then we beseech you be not partakers of
others men's sins: for when any judge men for conscience by the power they had
from you, God will look on you as the doers and maintainers of it. Consider
also how the prayers of all conscious men will daily come up before God, and
cry louder against them that take away his prerogative and their liberty which
he has given them, which is as dear to conscious men as their lives, then
Abels blood did against Cain. Again, what praise to God, and prayers, with
true love to them which give to God his prerogative, and to them their due,
which he has given them, namely liberty of conscience. Then we beseech you
confider, that whereas David says, Psalm. 19. The Law of God is perfect,
converting the soul, seeing the Word, not the rod is able to convince the
judgment, and alter the same, and seeing this honorable power has put down
some false power, we beseech you, let none rise against God and his royal
prerogative: then will wrath and stripes flee away, and peace and plenty, with
joy and gladness will come in the room thereof, For when our ways please the
Lord, he makes our enemies at peace with us. And seeing God has put into your
hearts for his glory, to cause that no wicked pamphlets or libellous books
might be printed: we beseech you to grant, that no conscious book whereto the
Authors will set their names and places of dwelling, may be refused to be
printed, that so errors being found out and answered, the authors may be
ashamed and, and reduced to the truth, and the truths the more cleared, for the
glory of God, the increase of knowledge, without which the mind is not good.
And whereas they are accused not to allow of the execution of justice by the
sword of the Magistrate, they profess, it is their hearts grief, that the
justice of their wholesome and good Laws are no more strictly executed. Your
Petitioners humbly crave, that you would take the premises into your grave
considerations, and grant them such a gracious answer as God shall persuade
your hearts, for the filling the hearts of his people with praises, that they
and their childrens children may praise God for this Assembly till the day of
Christ, and they shall be thankful, and pray for blessings upon you and your
godly proceedings.
