Pax optima rerum. December: 13 OXFORD: Printed by Leonard Lichfield. 1642.

A MESSAGE FOR PEACE.
WE doubt not but that the well affected Citizens of London are sensible of the
present and great calamities of the State, the Church and Commonwealth, and
that they do with a knowing compassion consider the distresses of them all
three, and how they languish in expectation that some remedy may be provided to
bind up the bleeding wounds of this distracted and divided Nation. That the
head and body of this Commonwealth may submit to an obedient relation, and in a
peaceable manner come to an uniform perfection, that schisms cried up by
popular ignorance, may by a loving and juditious agreement be annihilated into
that nothing of merit and spiritual ambition from whence they did first arise.
We doubt not moreover but that the Citizens of London have taken into
consideration the bloody effects of war, and what a sad character it will
present to after ages, where they shall read or hear of a Land wherein peace
and glory had chosen to inherit and quietly in every poor village to dwell
together, should now be made a prey to the cruelty of a Civil war, which word
does include these miseries following. The violent plundering of houses, and
taking away of their goods; nay, oftentimes there have, if they offered to make
any resistance, the violating of Churches, as the blinded rage of some
Soldiers lately committed at Worcester, Canterbury, and other Cathedrals,
besides the cruel effusion of blood at diverse places, but most especially at
Kenton bartail, which the mercy of our gracious Sovereign would fain have
avoided, and may instruct all good people that the sword is the cruel
executioner of Gods wrath and anger, and is a dear and costly way both of life
and state to obtain peace, when it may by gentle and soft means be sooner
gotten, for if there should be a constant opposition, as there has been
hitherto, nothing is to be expected but the ruin and desolation of this
Kingdom, that good men should be a weary of living in such a cruel and
distracted time, wherein Justice, Loyalty, and Religion can protect them from
the violence of domestike fury and cruelty, and if this war should continue,
the husband man who is the best victualler of the City, must be forced to
forsake and leave off his tillage, and then must necessarily follow a great
dearth and scarcity throughout the whole Land.

Besides, we understand that you the loyal and well affected Citizens of London
cannot be in any quiet safety within your own houses, lo there are a company
of giddy heads round about the City that had rather see the ruin and
overthrow of this Kingdom then to be conformable to their King in his most
merciful desires of peace, they desire that the Church and Commonwealth should
still suffer that they may in Conventicles despise all things in themselves who
are indeed arrogant and execrable persons valuing their own ungrounded opinions
at a higher rate then the peace and happiness of their own Country.

But as we desire the conversion of such, so we do not apply this our message
unto them, but to all Loving, Religious, Loyal and well affected Citizens, we
earnestly desire to take into consideration, the present distressed estate of
this Kingdom, as we have set it out in this present Message; and since there is
no true hearted Subject but does unfainedly wish and desire that there might be
a happy cessation of this civil war, that the King and Kingdom might enjoy one
another, that true Religion hitherto made scandalous and without shade, defense
or protection, (but that God and His Majesty have stood for it) may to the
comfort of all true Protestants flourish again in this Kingdom. We do
therefore with intimation of our places of being Privy Counselors to the
Kings sacred Majesty; and out of our tender care for the good and prosperity of
this City and Kingdom, heartily and lovingly desire you to take unto you
hearts, actively, obediently, and complying to a happy union and peace, between
the Kings Majesty and this present Parli: not doubting but your forwardness
therein will be very acceptable unto them, and your willingness to promote and
give the first moving to an accommodation of peace so generally desired by the
best and well affected subjects of this Kingdom: we have justly condescended
in a loving way to make known our estates unto you, and to move uno you that
the general votes and desires of the City may in a substantial and judicious
Petition with all convenient opportunity be presented and tendered to the two
Houses of Parliament, who it may be do expect by such a brief information, to
be certified of your inclinations to desire a firm and settled confirmation of
peace throughout the whole Kingdom. And as we do urge this peaceable motion,
being thought in our consultations worthy your allowance and approbation, so we
promise to join with you in advancing and bringing about a prosperous peace
for the general good of the Kingdom.

FJNJS.
