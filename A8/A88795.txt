VERSES Spoken to the KING, QVEEN, and DVTCHESSE of YORK in St JOHN'S Library
in Oxford.

Spoken to the KING and QUEEN in St John's Library.
BIrds have found Language, Elephants a Knee
To Complement the approach of Majesty:
None so much statue but (like Memnons) plays
Anthems to welcome such illustrious rays.
Your presence, Madam, here does parallel
Our Baptists desert to a Boscobel.
Our Mother glories that your smiles upon her
Create her Virgin Muses maids of Honor.
Your station 'twixt these Globes does prompt our pen
To fancy Princes placed 'twixt Gods and men;
Here men, there Angels ply their different Spheres,
Our house of Commons, and your House of Peers.
May your last progress here reach Nestor's Sum,
Till the Supreme Star Chamber call you home:
Whilst Angels propagate, and you display
A little CHARLES his Waine, and Milky Way:
These Asterismes are only wanting yet
To make White. Hall a Heaven, and Heaven complete.
Perfection, Madam, from your self must grow:
Kings are Immortal, but Queens make them so.
To her Highness the DVTCHESSE of YORK in the same place.
IF Duty without Compliment may stand,
And they who can but kneel, may kiss your Hand:
If Muses Country Girls their skill may try,
Though It spoil an Honor to a Courtesy:
We Would rally all our forces to express
Your Noblest Welcome in a plain address:
Mars we would assign your Guard, but that we are
Assured, your DUKES a greater God of War:
The Graces to attend you we would call forth,
But that they are all engrossed in your own worth;
And Venus with her Cupid too should come,
But that you have a sweeter Prince at home:
Thus Poets Dream, and Muses fancy less
Then what Fates judge you worthy to possess:
Our Pegasus with duty winged we show,
Others may higher fly, none stoop so low.
The END.
