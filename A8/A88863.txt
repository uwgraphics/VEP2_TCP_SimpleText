THis Ark called Union has not her Peer
On Earth, and 's laden with a fraught so dear
To her Almighty Pilo^, that no waves
Of might or malice raised b' infernal slaves
Of human shape and lofty high estate,
Nor yet their father that inveterate
Old Serpent raging against this blessed Bark
The Antitype of righteous Noah's Ark
Can make to sink or split upon the rocks
Of ruin, maugre all their furious knocks
Of powdered bals, and force of armed steel
By violence to make this Ark to feel
Their wrathful open rage, when neither plots
Nor treacheries fast tied with the knots
Of vows, and Sacraments of miracles,
Impostures, fachinations, and spells,
Espoused interests of Potentates
Foreign and homebred Soldiers, and Prelates;
Threats, Promises, and Protestations,
Aulick Libels, Lies, and Defamations,
Nor all the cunning, study, pains, and sweat
Of all Malignant Foxes small, and great;
In Court, and Camp, City, and Country,
Nor in this Ark (if any lurking lie)
Can break this Churches Trinity of State
Described here, nor make them violate
That pious Covenant, which holds them fast,
And is indeed that Vessels mainest Mast,
By which she saileth through the troubled seas
Of her affairs; and now has found some case,
Thanks be unto that heavenly Cynosure
Above the Stars, which gives a light to allure
Her Mariners, and yet will give light more
TO unfold the secrets of the Romish Whore,
The hellish darkness of those mists and foggs
Of blasphemies, and errors, which those froggs
Or unclean Spirits from the Beast proceeding
(Whose thoughts upon Reformers blood are feeding)
Have now unbowelled, and spread about
To put the light of Reformation out,
And with new Hydra-headed heresies
(Like to that smoke) to obscure the clearest skies
Of sacred Truth (a devilish design
More dangerous, then was the Powder-Myne)
And raise tempestuous storms about this Ark,
And now they cannot beat by force, they bark
Belch, and disgorge their Stygian despite
Against the Protector of this Ark outright;
And still their horrid rage does more abound
Because this Ark of Union is not drowned;
But wait a while, and see this cursed crew
Partake of that reward, that is here in view:
For fix your eyes upon these Seas of ire
Involving those, that did against the Ark conspire:
See here some headless floating in the waves
Of direful death, some dead, and wanting graves:
See all their warlike Engines, and their Forces,
Now as feeble as their liveless Corses;
See these bloody men and their Commission
To kill Innocents brought to perdition;
And they that living yet thought it no sin
To leave this Ark, now wish they had kept in;
But now they are the scorn of time, and fate,
Who did this tossed Bark despise, and hate,
Augmented more in that they did remove
The Royal Steers-man, whom our Ark does love.
But see these noble Champions (lately six)
Guarding the assaulted Union, and fix
Themselves to courage, valor, care, and love
To bring to rest this tossed Turtle-dove.
Their brave achievements Chronicles shall speak,
And learned Volumes; but my pen's too weak
To tell their worth, or their due praises spread,
Whom great JEHOVAH has so honored.
Draw near, kind Reader, do but view this piece,
It Is not of Jason, nor of his Golden fleece
That here is Emblem'd, nor the high renown
Of Hectors Acts ere Troy was battered down,
That here we show you, but it does presage
A watery Landscape of a weeping Age.
The Ark that rides here whose tender walls
Contains in her our English Admirals,
For Reformation swimming on the Main,
Against Superstition which so much did reign:
Charge on, charge on, the guard of Pluto al,
The Pope, the Bishop, and the Cardinal:
But you had best retire, it is all but vain,
For truth has gotten higher, and she will reign.
Here Reader pause, and judge our Land is free,
A Chronicle for our posterity;
For God has brought them, lo their pride does swage
And we made happy in a peaceful Age.
Had not the LORD bin for us, they had won,
And clothed this Land with red confusion;
But now sail on you worthies through the Ocean
Of sad distempers, let your winged Motion
Out pace the flight of Eagles, that aspire
Go take your Sensers filled with zealous fire:
Let truth command the way, by her the Ark is guided,
And let the Gospel sway, and Errors be avoided:
Great God of wind and sea, who searchest through the dark
Who did command old Noah to enter in the Ark,
Direct this ARK unto the Key of peace,
Command deliverance that our Wars may cease.
An Apostrophe to the Church.
THen woman thou whose clothing is the Sun,
Cease to complain, nor say thou art undone
For thou have suffered harder things of yore,
Than now; weigh with the present times before.
See thou not how thy sad and heavy night
Of fears and sorrows now are vanished quite:
Triumphing days thy late griefs do beguile,
And Halcyon times begin again to smile.
Behold how rugged Mars is posting hence,
Seeing thee armed so with heavens defense:
Outward enmity shall not hurt a jot,
If thine intestine Errors hurt thee not.
Then wipe thy blubbered face, and lay aside
Thy mourning weeds, and like a loving Bride
With spirit mounted on a heavenly flame
Spread abroad thy Bridegrooms glorious fame;
What tongue of mortal, men or Seraphim
Can tell sufficiently the praise of him.
