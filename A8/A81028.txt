By the Lord Protector. A PROCLAMATION ABOUT Dissolving the Parliament.
WHereas We summoned Our High Court of Parliament to assemble and meet together
at Our City of Westminster the Twenty seventh day of January last, which has
continued until this present day; And whereas We did by Our Commission under
Our Great Seal of England, bearing date at Westminster this present Twenty
second day of April, for diverse weighty Reasons, Declare Our Pleasure and
Resolution to Dissolve the said Parliament: And to that end did thereby
constitute and appoint Our right Trusty and right Welbeloved Counselor
Nathanael Lord Fiennes, one of the Lords Keepers of Our Great Seal of England,
and others Our Commissioners in Our Name, this said present Twenty second day
of April to Dissolve Our said Parliament, which was by them done according to
the tenor of the said Commission in the usual place, and by virtue thereof Our
said Parliament is absolutely Dissolved. Nevertheless We have thought it
necessary, with the Advice of Our Privy Council, by this Our Proclamation to
publish and make known the same, to the end all persons whom it may concern may
take notice thereof.
