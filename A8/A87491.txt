A LETTER Sent from a Merchant IN DUBLIN IN IRELAND TO HIS FRIEND IN London,
Declaring the Alteration of Affairs there, in summoning a Convention of
Estates to sit at DVBLIN, etc.
SIR,
I Have received yours, with a Letter of the Lord General Monks enclosed, which
was welcome News here, we having so unanimously declared against the Rump, for
a Free and Full Parliament, or the Secluded Members to be admitted, we had
little reason to expect that the Army of Ireland would have complied with us:
The General of the Rump's Forces, together with many other Colonels, and
Officers, with two hundred Foot, being dissatisfied with the Resolves of this
place, betook themselves to the Castle the 15th. of this month about five of
the Clock at night; But within one hour after, the Citizens besieged them, and
blocked up all the Gates. The 17th. the besieged sent a Letter to the Major,
who returned so resolute an Answer thereunto, that upon the 18th. the Soldiers
delivered up their Officers, and the Castle; which otherwise, had that day been
stormed, the Wall in order thereunto being undermined.

This happy Success has produced a cheerful Resolution in all other Cities
and Towns in this Kingdom, to live and die with us, in that we have declared
for. And upon Monday next a Convention of the Estates is to sit here: And a
Proclamation is in the Press to banish all Anapabtists, Quakers, and Sectaries
out of this Kingdom. Which we hope will much conduce to our Security and Quiet.

February, 22. 1659. Your Friend and Servant, T. J.
