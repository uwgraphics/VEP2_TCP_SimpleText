A MODE: THE Cities profound Policy, in delivering themselves, their City,
their Works and Ammunition, into the protection of the ARMY.
BRave Citizens, you have done well,
To make your slaves your Masters;
Your policy it does excel,
Your Grooms will be your Tasters.
My Lord Mayor, and the Aldermen,
Your Gowns must make them breeches;
And if you do retort again,
They Will make you eat your Speeches.
O brave Common-Counsell men,
O brave Trained-Bands!
When do you think to get again
The staff in your own hands?
2
The Apprentices did vapor much,
They Would bang the Army soundly,
And yet their valor proved such,
They durst not go to it roundly:
Massey was made the General
Of all your mighty Forces;
But when he on the Foe should fall,
He wanted men and horses.
O brave Common-Counsell men,
O brave Trained-Bands!
When do you think to get again
The staff in your own hands?
3
Where Is Hollis now and Stapleton,
Jack Maynard and Clotworthy?
And where is Prynne and Poyntz now gone,
To purge them of the scurvy?
And Glyn and Lewis have left all,
Within at six and sevens;
And Waller's gone to Glocester-Hall
To visit Mrs. Stevens.
O brave Common-Counsell men, etc
4
The Soldiers now, even where they wish,
Will in your City quarter,
And before you taste of every dish;
And for your wives will barter.
Your dainty ducks, whose soles nere treads
Upon the earth that bears them,
They now will towse upon your beds,
Your Antlers nothing scares them.
O brave Common-Counsell men, etc.
5
Sir Thomas now will make his peace,
Even as his own self lists:
And means to stew you in your grease,
The Army with with him twisteth.
New halters many, for to hang
Those that meant to oppose him,
Tell truth, do not your hearts cry twang,
That ere at first you chose him?
O brave Common-Counsell men, etc.
6
And now the Royallists will sing,
Aloud Vive le Roy;
The Commons will embrace their King,
With an unwonted joy:
And where is now all your coin and toil,
It Is vanished into air:
You may get more, if that you moile
Now at S. Bartholmews Fair.
O brave Common-Counsell men, etc.
7
If Fairfax now his Sovereign bring
To London, to his People,
Each Parish bells for joy shall ring,
Till they knock down the steeple:
And we Sir Thomas his renown
Will like S. Georges hallow,
Tom May shall all his acts write down,
Or Withers that Apollo.
O brave Common-Counsell men, etc.
8
The Scots do whine that they have lost
Their hopes at once: dear Jockey,
Thy fine Presbytery quite is crossed,
The English do but mock ye:
The coin that is behind of pay,
For selling of the King,
You Will have the clean contrary way,
Sir Thomas will it bring.
O Brave Common-Counsell men, etc.
9
The Trained Bands alas are tired,
Their works they cannot man them,
And therefore have, the Army hyr'd,
Who like to chafe do fan them:
The Tower too great a trouble was,
They wanted a Constable;
And therefore they did bring't to pass,
Sir Thomas might be able.
O Brave Common-Counsell men, etc.
10
Case now does doubt, calamity
Will seize on the Presbytery,
Calamie doubts, the case will be
So as to see it were pity:
The Synod now does greatly doubt,
That Bishops, and the Service,
Will now once more be brought about,
Before it please Tom Gervice,
O brave Common-Counsell men, etc.
11
Overton now may walk abroad,
Stone walls are weak to hold him;
As Lilburne that same Demie-god,
Prophetickly has told him:
And you may go, and shake your ears,
Who had, and could not hold it,
What you had strove for many years,
And got; you now have sold it.
O brave Common-Counsell men etc.
12
You need not now to Westminster
To march with Fife and Drum,
The Army so your goods prefer,
They will supply your room.
The Modells now and you may lie,
Abed till noone, and please ye;
The Army, will your place supply,
All this is done to ease ye.
O brave Common-Counsell men etc.
13
And now what do ye lack fond men,
Alas you wanted knowledge:
Who would have thought, when you had been
So long at Gotham College,
You should not know to bargain well,
But so to maime your Charter:
The after-Ages will you tell,
You did not wisely barter.
O brave Common-Counsell men
O brave Trained-bands!
When do you think to get again
The staff in your own hands?
FINIS.
