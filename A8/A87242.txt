A TRVE COPY OF A second letter, sent from the Lord of Inchiquine to the
Honorable Collonell Michaell Jones, Commander in chief of the Parliaments
Forces in Leinster, AND Governor of the City of Dublin, With Colonel Jones
his Answer, To the Lord of Inchiquines said Letter.

DVBLIN Printed by William Bladen 1649,

Sir
I Have received yours of the 21th of June, wherein you refer me for answer
to part of mine of June 20th to what has passed between you and his
Excellency the Marquis of Ormonde, when I perused those papers of yours; I
observed how you put of the maine objections against the chief actors in
England as not concerning you at all, can the horrid and treasonable Paricide
of a lawful Sovereign, by rebellious Subjects, contrary to all laws of God
and man, contrary to so many oaths and obligations, detested by all Europe,
the abrogation of the ancient liberties, and privileges of Parliament, the
total subvertion of the fundamental constitutions of their native country the
extremest violation of the rights and properties of their fellow subjects, and
the assuming, of an absolute arbitrary power, over their lives and fortunes by
the Sword, be crimes of the highest nature in the Actors: and yet the
maintainers and abbetters of them, in their Tirannicall usurpations remain
innocent, and unconcerned.

I observed further how you plead his Majesty's limitation of his Regal power
and his committing of the managery of the Irish war, to his two houses of
Parliament in England, and upon that foundation, you ground the justice of your
Proceedings, suppose the laws of England did tie our common Sovereigns hands
from doing acts of grace in Ireland, suppose they did obliege the subjects of
this Kingdom in their lives and Estates, without their own consents, yea
before they be heard, suppose this do not render the subjects of Ireland, the
veriest slaves in the world, nor make void our free charters as ancient and as
large as those of England it self, suppose that solemn Act to introduce the
English statutes into Ireland, to have been needless and superfluous,
supposing all you will have to be supposed, yet now there is not the least
shadow of the two houses remaining, the upper house being quite taken away, and
the house of Commons, become a suppositions changling, certainly they are none
of his Majesty's two houses, which have taken away both Majesty and Monarchy,
Lastly that war has noe affinity with this, That was to suppress Rebellion,
this to maintain Rebellion, That was to defend the Protestant Religion, the
liberties of Parliament, the rights of the subject, this is merely for the
subvertion of all these p^^der those things seriously, without prejudice, and
you will quickly find what tottering grounds you have laid to support the
weight of so much Christian blood and the devastation of the whole Kingdom,
and how little you have answered to his Excellencies reasons.

I proposed a conference and you reject it, as not consisting with Prudence in
matters of this consequence, and subject in these times to construstions and
misconstructions, Certainly if advice and deliberation be necessary it is in
matters of moment and Consequence.

If you be your self, that is free to follow, reason and Conscience and not
engaged to the dictates of other men, nor wilfully wedded to an implicit
faith, but ready to embrace the truth whenever it shall be revealed (which
every good Christian ought to be) a conference had been the likeliest means,
to take away misconstructions, and beget better constructions. This made the
office of Ambassadors so sacred, that quarrels might not become immortal,
for want of conference, and right understanding There is a blessing promised to
Peacemakers, but a judgment hangs over their heads who nourish contentions,
This rejecting of a conference seems to me to argue strongly either a
diffidence in your cause, or a resolution, to hold the conclusion without any
regard of the premises, or a distrust of my ingenuity. We both profess the
same ends, why should we differ so much in the means, I thought a conference
would take away the veil, and either discover our difference in the first, or
have happily reconciled us in the later, to which I was resolved to come
without prejudice or obstinacy, contending more for truth then, for victory, as
willing to have condiscended to you had you been in the right, as I am
unwilling to depart from you ^^w, because I am assured that you are in the
wroung, It is indifferent to me what cause is right, so I be in the right
cause, And though I have left your party, because you have left your
principles, it is but as a man leaves his brothers house, whilst it is
infected with some contagious disease, with a mind to pray for you, and a
desire of reunion with you, so soon as I may with safety, This is not to
forsake you, but to provide for myself, you say you are satisfied in the
justice of your cause admit you be so, yet take heed this be not for want of
due discussion, or out of an implicit trust, and adherence to others, or a
prejudice in your affections, which robbes and betraies reason of its due
succors, and like a false glass makes things appear otherwise then in truth
they are, Be it spoken without the beast disparagdment to your person or
parts, which I honor and desire to love, you cannot be more resolute then
Saul was in his pharisaicall opinions, or then many thousand heretics and
Shismatickes of all sorts in the world are at this day, who might be cured, if
they did not stopp their cares, against the voice of the Charmer, Principles
may be erroneous, and nothing is more ordinary then to mistake a party for a
principle, The only reason which you give for your resolution, is that Gods
blessing has dwelt visibly upon your cause, as still it does, when God
blesses men in evil courses, it is the greatest judgment, his ways are
always just, but often secret, The evening commends the day, and the
conclusion often differs from the first Acts of the Tragily howsoever, ascribe
not that to the meritts of your cause, which may be due to the sins of the
advers party.

My sword you say has been prosperous, but you advise me to consider the
cause wherein I then appeared, If over my cause were just (which you confess)
it is so still and therefore I may still hope for the same blessings, yet the
prosperous^^es of it, did not assure me that it was good, but the goodness of
it did, and still does give me hopes that it will be prosperous.

But you tax me now for joineing with the bloody Rebels, and setting my self
against those of the Protestant Religion contrary to my former engagements, how
ill do these words become you, who adhere to and maintain the bloodiest
Rebels in the world, that is those in England, who are so strictly joined and
united with Colonel Monk, who if I be not misinformed, has made a Cessation
with the bloodest of those that you intend and recommended them to the
Parliament for far better conditions, then we give to those who submitt to
his Majesty, This is evident that h^^e maintains, a strict league and
correspondance with them, then with his Majesty's loyal English Subjects,
witness his own letter to Collonell Collom Brien mac Mahon, the original
whereof is in my hands, excusing the taking of a prey upon mac Mahons lands,
and promising his own endeavor, and major Caddugans for restitution thereof,
in these words, It seems this misfortune happened to you, upon an Information
that you were removing with your Creaghts, and that you kept the horse you have
to join with Ormondes being of that faction. those whom you call in public
bloody Rebels, you hug and protect in private, but his Majesty's friends are
those you most malign.

Is that an horrid Crime in us which is a virtue in your selves, observe how
partiality does blind your eyes, is this our Crime that you prosecute with such
outcries that we have not rooted out a nation, and those whose ancestors with
their bloods, did propagate the English interest in this Kingdom, but as
becomes Christians, have received the penitent to mercy, after they have
thrust from them their misleaders, That we acknowledge them for fellow
subjects to whom his Majesty has extended his grace, that we refuse not their
assistance in the defense of our Common King and Country, now that they have
left their unlawful courses, to concur with us in our just and pious ends,
whom we prosecuted as Rebels formerly, If there were any blemish in this as
there is none, it reflects principally on those whose Religion infusing better
principles into them, have been to the scandal thereof, contrivers and
fomenters, of all our mischeifes, first necessitating us, to make use of the
joint concurrenc of those of the Roman cumunion, for our common defense and
then blaming us for joining rather with them then to have both our bodies and
souls inslaved by a pack of insulting Rebels, No, no, sir we have seen to
our cost, how much our divisions have conduced and would conduce to their
greedy and ambitious ends.

As for that charge you lay to me I smile at it, and advise you seriously to
look into your self, I have changed the party but not the cause, you have
changed the cause but not the party, make all things the same they were
pretended to me and the world, and I am the same I ever was, but when time
has discovered the hidden mysteries and juggling tricks of cheating
mountebankes and imposters, for more to persist in their fellowship, were not
constancy but self willed obstinacy, I have as you desire seriously considered
my former engadgments and the more I ponder the more I find my self obliged
in honor and conscience to desert that party, I engadged my self by oath to
defend the Kings person prerogative and posterity and therefore I cannot
consent to that execrable murder, of his Majesty, and the utter disinheritance
of my now gracious Sovereign, I engadged to preserve the laws, and therefore
I cannot without wilful perjury, see the laws subverted by a factious Army I
engadged to maintain Religion, and therefore cannot endure to see the
resurrection of all schimes, herecies blasphemies, out of the grave of
oblivion, wherein they have been long buried, I engadged for the just liberties
of the Parliament, and people, and therefore am bound to oppose the
annihilating or exvnaniting the power of Parliament by an handful of upstarts
and the transferring the people from the service of their lawful Sovereign to
the vassalladge of domineering Rebels give me leave with the same freedom to
put you in mind, of your oaths and engadgments, both as a subject, and a
professor of the laws and those not obtruded upon you, by fear or force not
disalowed by a lawful superior nor repugnant to law or precedent obligations.

Lastly for the Protestant Religion if you intend that of the Church of England
wherein you were baptized and breed wherein your father was, your uncles are
and your brother professes to be an eminent pastor, I am ready to join hands
and heart with you in the defense and propagation thereof if you desire a
general Sinod of all the Protestants in Europe, to beget either a nearer
uniformity, or a righter understanding among us, I shall endeavor the same
also, within the bounds of my calling, But if by the Protestant Religion you
intend a confusion or inundation of all those monstrous and heterogeneous
errors, which have over spread the face of the English Church, or if you
think it lawful for private persons or subordinate, Magestrates, without the
consent, against the will, of their lawful Sovereign, to introduce novelties
into the Church, according to their particular fancies, I must crave leave to
dissent from you.

And now sir to conclude all whether you or I do entend or endea^our more
Really the advancement of the Protestant Religion, and the English interest in
this Kingdom, that is the defense of the English Subject in his just propriety
the monarch of England in his just Sovereignty, I appeal to God the searcher
of all hearts, and to the tribunal of Christ before which we must one day
give an account of our actions much more might be said in our defense but this
is satisfactory if not to you yet to him who desires is be

From the Camp of his Maties Army at Finglas the 23th of June 1649. Sir Your
friend and Servant Inchiquine
For Collonell Michaell Jones. Th^se.



My Lord.
YOur Lordships of this date I re^ieved, it being in pursuance of your former
of the 20th instant, Therein I find a large recollection of what had been once
and again forme^ly offered and urged by the Lord of Ormonde, endeavoring the
diverting me from my course by laying before me the late proceedings in
England.

The cunto and to your Lordship is the Answer the same summarily, which was
formerly given on the like occasion. That in all that, the service here is noe
way concerned: only as to a Christian fellow feeling of each others suffering,
And in what this service has suffered by those unhappy differencies
obstructing those supplies, whereby the work here had been before now
finished, otherwise I see not how from those distractions in England is to be
concluded ( either in Honor or Reason) what you intend my giving up to the
Rebels and their adherents this place and Charge committed me: which by Gods
grace I shall never do.

Your Lordship now again press^th that Conference defined in your former. And
particularly, you except to my saying, That is prudence it was not to be
admitted in matters of this consequence, you tell me; that if advice and
deliberation be necessary it is in matters of moment and consequence.

(But my Lord) it is not understood of advising with Enemies whose Counsels,
although never so specious, are to be suspected. Nor was it said that advice
was not necessary in matters of consequence: but that discourses and a verbal
Conference (which was that spoken of,) and that at the distance we are with
each other, was not in prudence to be admitted especially in causes of this
consequence. The Lord of Oxmonde so apprehended it, whole transactions first
with the Irish and after with the Parliament Commissioners passed not in
discourses but in writting, and that as to very circumstances. writeing
(surely) not conference is the prudent and clear way for such proceedings. let
not therefore my declining that your way be apprehended as proceeding either
out of diffidence of my cause; or from a Resolution to bold the conclusion
without respect had to the premises; or out of any distrust of your ingenuity:
but as not being a way secure and fatisfactory. Neither am I enabled by the
Parliament to dispute and debate their intrests otherwise then in the way we
now are, by the Sword: wherein I doubt not of a good conclusion the Lord
asisting me.

It troubles you much that I mention the Lords blessing this his own cause
with us; you say, that God blesses men in evil courses. A good cause (I know)
may some time suffer. Yet is it not incongruous (Circumstances considered) to
conclude the justice of a cause from Gods blessing it: seeing his blessing is
expected and assured to his work by special promise, the sins of those
therein isntrumental not interposing. But it seems very strange what you say,
(and the Stranger, if it be the sense of those Divines with you) that God
blesses men in evil courses. Gods suffering them for a time to proceed in
evil succesfully, is not a blessing of them in evil courses, there being to
evil none of Gods blessings appropriated. But for us, it is our comfort that
we can and do thus boast of the Lords blessing this his work in our hands,
wherein has been mightily, and visibly magnified the Glory of his power and
truth and goodness even in the lowest of our Condition, to us an Evidence of
his own cause with us. And in so concluding I but assume the same freedom,
which your Lordship has done: you having (in effect) so concluded from the
succesfullnes of your Sword: And this our cause is the same with that which
your Lordship seemed then to hold.

Your Lordship justifies your joining with the Rebels by way of
Recrimination; objecting the same to others. If to me you intend it, I speak
it plainly, it is a Charge very unjust, (to say no more)

But as to your self, you stick not openly to profess and justify your
proceedings in that kind, asserting it a Christian act: for therein (you say)
you Received penitents; strange Penitents are they, who after so much blood,
and spoil of Innocents are now so far from satisfiing their wrong doings,
that they profess themselves not guilty: and whose Penitence is only in that
they failed in accomplishing their evil in fullnes; which in the now settling
them in that power given in your Christian union with them, they may have
hereafter fitting opertunity to accomplish to the uttermost, so, as they may
not need further Penitence in that Particular.

You smile (you say) at that Charged to you of your Changing. At it (my Lord)
do your Enemies smile: but grief it is to your friends, and all well affected.
who your friend, can smile at your falling away and (to speak plainly) at
your betraying that trust reposed in you? can you smile at you turning that
sword put into your hands by the Parliament, against those who have so trusted
and maintained you? were you called out against these bloody Rebels, and for
the Protestants, and can you smile to see your self now in the head of those
very Rebels or with them, and for them, and that, against even English and
Protestants? can you smile (my Lord) in your betraying those poor English
(your Care and trust,) and in offering them up (in time) a sacrifice to the
malice of their mortal Enemies, having first removed (and by their hands
also, which is intended) those here, who pity them, and by whom they might
be from those evils rescued. You tell me, that you have not changed your
Cause but your Party, and what was your Cause then (I beseech you) and what is
it now? was not the prosecution of this War against the Rebels then your
Cause? this was surely your Trust and (for any thing appearing) was it that
only or principally in your trust? and are you not now taken of from this? is
this your Cause now? are you not now changed to the quite contrary? your Cause
(you say) is the maintenance of the King, of Laws, of Religion, and of the
Liberties of Parliament. so indeed in your Covenant. But your sticking unto
these (if unto them you stick) excuses you nothing, as to your failing in
that principally Committed to you in that Province, the employing those Arms
and powers given you against the Rebels our common Enemies. There is not the
meanest Covenanter who pretends not equal intrest with you in these common
engagements; but you were, besides all hese, eminently called above others to
that high trust, from which you have so fallen as your Honor is no way salved
no^ vindi^ated by a pretended adheiring to other your profession. your doing
somethings, excuses not your failing in that principally expected from you.

You object to us new raised Heresies etc. we detest them as much as you or
any; neither account we them any part of our Doctrine, and of the Religion now
professed in the Church of England I wish some of your Lordships Divines now
with you ( whose pens are parhapps in this Charge to us) were not chargable
with corruption in that kind, making way for Heresies, and even for Popery it
self also, being thereby, with others of like strain, authors of those
evils this day covering the face of Church and State, whereof they may be in
due time sensible.

Much more (you say) might be said in your defense I beseech your Lordship to
re^erve it for some time of better leisure, and for some other person fitter
for such debateings. Wha^ I have now done, was for showing my self nothing
satisfied with any thing yet by your Lordship delivered, and that others might
not be abused in suffering yours to pass me unanswered. But for the future, I
desire, your Lordship would be pleased not to trouble your self not me in
thi^ kind any further. I am otherwise emploved then to spend time in answering
some there, whose penns are at better leisure then either yours or mine at
present. So I remain

My Lord Your Lordships humble Servant Mic: Jones.
