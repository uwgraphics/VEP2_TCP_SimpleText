HUGH PETER'S last WILL and TESTAMENT: OR, The Haltering of the Devil.
To the tune of, the guelding of the Devil.
A Joyful story I will you tell
Of the haltering of the Devil of hell,
Old Nick, who lurkt this many a year
In Calvin's Stool and Luthers Chair,
At Amsterdam in forty one
Did hold a Convocation,
And resolved to cross the brine,
And enter a Herd of English Swine:
Beelzebub that Angel of Light
(And Darkness too) could hit it right;
The zealous wives he enters then,
And fits them for their brethren,
The lesser Devils he bids them go
Into Millenaries, Anabaptists, Quakers too,
Divide but the Kingdom, the spoil was his own,
For then would he plunder the Church and the Thorn;
Rond round round as a Juglers box
The Devil walked his round with the pox;
The great boss Bible under his arm
For all his mischiefs was the Charm,
And the Pulpit he soon deseries
The fittest place where to play his prise.
In pantaloons and powdered hair
There the Mountebank commends his ware;
Come buy of my Balsome approved to be
An Antedote against Episcopacie. Sing this through the nose.

And here is that most precious thing
Frees all my Saints from the thrall of a King,
And you of all humane Laws does free,
And from all manner of jeopardie*
The Germans it cost ten millions or mo,
But you shall have't for a thimble or two*
Thus he set up in the Preachers stall,
But soon 'larg'd his shop into Goldsmiths Hall,
If he could but sheere the brethren there,
He knew where to pick the Cavaleere,
And there his voteries in did bring
Their thimbles, and bodkins, their plate and their rings,
And the sooner to bring their good Cause to an end,
No brother but his wife for a Hackny would lend;
Thus by the sisters a bank was made
(For the Devil and's wench) had a thriving trade)
The guelding Earl then does he bestride,
For now he is resolved to get up and ride,
But ^o body living was able to discern
Ess^x from the Devil, so like was their horn,
Thus jealous ambition soon did send
His Favorite unto a merciful end.
Thomas next at his service was,
(For the Devil nere wanted a Mule nor an Ass)
With William and Arthur a coursing he went,
And his Lurcher Noll still followed the scent,
The Royal STAG they run so hard
That He was forced to leave the Herd
And singled him unto London town
Where the Devil and's Band dogs tore him down:
Hogon Mogon Devil now
To whom all the world does hail and bow!
His house of Commons next he bestrides
Where like George on horseback he rides?
Through Church and Crown he now makes speed
(Though he need not have spurred so forward a Steed)
And still all our Coin runs away by stealth
As the Devil had been in Commonwealth.
But here the Commonwealth had a rub
For they would be greater then Belze bub*
But that the Devil never could like,
And bids Beedle Noll to give them a kick;
Presto begone, away then they went,
And left behind them a damnable scent;
Thus Belsebub in discontent
Parted with his Fundament:
Now he is advanced from the Peake
To the Palace of an ample beak,
Whose roof of Copper shines so
It excells Saint Peter's Cupello,
And he likes his habitation well
For 'twas no one mantion but all hell,
And of furniture there was such store
The Deele nere met with the like before:
Noll and the Deele cop'd many a year,
Till the date of's Indenture now grew near;
Sick sick sick and the pains of hell
Upon old Noll as a Mortal fell
Though his Augurers told him he nere should dye,
Yet there his Prophet Goodwin did lie;
The dearest friends they say must part
So did Noll and the Devil with a heavy heart:
Then silly Dick laid claim to the Throne,
But's Nuncles said 'twas theirs by adoption;
And now the Devil was put to his trump
And once more resolves to set up with the Rump,
But there the Varlet did stink so sore
England resolved to endure't no more,
And so the infernal Merchant broke,
Hell never before received such a stroke.
Hews and Cries runs up and down,
In every Borough, City and Town;
The Traiterous murderers is descried
And now he knows not where to hide,
Under the Lawyers gown he stole,
But thence he was fetched out by the pole,
And now not knowing where to be
In Hugh Peter's he took sanctuary:
But there is no fence against a flaile
Hugh Peter's could not be his Bail,
For all his thefts and Regicide
In Hugh Peter's he must be tried,
And is condemned to the Gallow Tree
Where he paid the Hangman his fee,
That Is Executor in trust should be content
To fulfill his Will and Testament:
Unto his Sisters he gave his Babble
Which stood in their service as long as 'twas able,
And unto the Kirk his brains and eyes,
And unto the Queen of Morocco his thighs;
And this was Peter's and Harrison promised his people that he should rise again
the third day; and his maid cleansed the house with much curiosity, expecting
him the Tuesday, the day after his Execution.
Harrisons plight
(But the Mayor brok, s word last tuesday night)
And so the Devil parted withs train
Who a thousand years hence means to see you again.
FINIS,
