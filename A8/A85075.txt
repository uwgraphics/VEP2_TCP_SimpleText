JOHN 17.3. This is Life Eternal to know thee the only true GOD, And JESUS
CHRIST Whom thou have sent.


1. Q.W^^t is God?

Ans. God is a Spirit, One, Almighty, Eternal, Infinite, unchangeable Being,
Absolutely Holy-Wise, Just and Good, and worshipped by his people in a Trinity
of Persons, John 4.24. 1 Cor. 8.4. Exodus 3.14. and 34 6.

2. Q. What do you understand by the Trinity of persons?

A. Three subsistances in that ^ne Divine Being, namely the Father, Son, and
Holy Ghost. Mat. 28.19. 1. Distinguished in themselves by their incommunicable
properties of Relation, the Father begetting, the Son begotten, the Holy
Ghost proceeding, Psalm. 2.7. John 1 18. and 15.26. 2 Discerned to us in their
outward works the Father in Creating, the Son in Redeeming, the Holy Ghost in
Sanctifying, Ephesians. 3.9. Gal. 3.13. 1 Cor. 6.11.


3. Q. What was the Creation of Man?

Ans. God framed his Body of the dust, and breathed into it a reasonable soul,
constituting his Person i^ (...) state of perfect holiness and happiness,
from which being seduced by Satan he fell under the power of Sin and Death,
without all possibilty of Redemption, but by the Incarnation of the Son of
God, Genesis 2.7.3.15.

4. Q. What did God the Son to Redeem us?

Ans. He took our nature, and for us in it, 1 he performed all that
righteousness the Law required, Mat. 3.15. 2. He satisfied all that vengeance
sin deserved, Gal. 3.13. And is therefore called Jesus (that is) a Savior,
because he perfectly saves both our Souls and Bodies from sin and wrath, Heb.
7.21. Mat. 1.21. Heb. 4.14, 15. Our Prophet to instruct us, John 6.14. Our King
to protect and rule us, Act. 2.36.


5 Q. How is the benefit of Christ's Redemption made ours?

Ans. 1. By his Spirit applying unto us the Merit and Efficasie of Christ's
Mediation in all those Ordinances and ways of Grace which God has appointed
his people to attend upon, Romans 8 2. 2 Cor. 3 6. 2 By a justifying Faith, which
is a supernatural gift wrought in our hearts by the Spirit of Grace through
the ministry of the Gospel, apprehending and applying Christ's active and
passive obedience as our own, imputed by God unto his chosen, Ephesians. 2.8. Romans
10.17. and 4.24.


6. Q. What are the Seals of the righteousness of Faith?

Ans. The Sacraments ordained of God, by visible and corporal signs to
represent and to exhibit unto true believers, the invisible and spiritual
benefits of Christ's death, Genesis 17 11. 1 Cor. 10.16.

7. Q How many Sacraments are there?

Ans. Of the new Testament there are two (to wit) Baptism and the Lords Supper
which by the institution of Christ succeeded those two of the Old, namely
Circumcision and the Pascall Lamb, 1 Cor. 10.1, 2, 3. and 5 7. Colos. 1.11, 12.

8. Q. What are the parts of the Sacrament of Baptism?

Ans. The visible part is Water sprinkled on the Child in the name of the
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; The invisible part is the Regeneration of our
Nature, and the washing away of sin through the blood of Christ, applied by the
Spirit of God to those that are Elect. Tit. 3.5. Act. 2.38.

9. Q Is the invisible grace performed in the time of Baptism?

Asw. 1. Baptism is only an initiating and ingrafting ordinance, wherein the
Lord would signify unto Believers that their children as well as themselves,
are taken into covenant with God, Romans 6.5. Act. 2.39. 2. Being the seal of
the Covenant of Grace it carries with it all the Grace of the Covenant from
which it has its virtue; which Grace though it be sealed in present yet is
not performed till the several seasons thereof, as perfection in holiness is
sealed here, though not accomplished till we come to heaven, Ephesians. 4.30 3.
Union between Christ and the child, is, when the grace of the Covenant is in
any measure applied; though comfort of it is not, till effectual calling, that
the child comes actually to believe and to give up it self in Covenant with
God, 1 Pet. 3.21.


10. Q. What is the Sacrament of the Lords Supper?

Ans. It is an Ordinance of the New Testament showing Christ to be come, and to
have suffered in the flesh; wherein by the outward Elements of Bread and Wine
are signified and applied to Believers the saving ben^fits of Christ's Body
broken, and his blood shed for sin, Mat. 26.26, 27. 1 Cor. 11.24, 25.

11. Q. What is the union between the signs and the things signified?

Ans. Not Corporal but Spiritual, yet Real in the saving effects of Christ's
Real presence to the worthy Receiver, Joh. 6.63. 1 Cor. 10.3.4.16.

12. Q. How does a Christian become a worthy Receiver?

A. There is a two fold worthiness, 1. Of the person, which is Gods gracious
acceptance of poor sinners in Jesus Christ, Mat. 3.17. 2. Of the Action which
consists in our due preparation by Examining our selves, 1 Cor. 11.28.


13. Q. By what Rule ought we to examine our selves?

A. By the word of God which is a spiritual Glass to show us the face of our
consciences in our twofold estate, either of Nature or of Grace. The Law
discovers our sin, the Gospel our remedy, that seeing our sin, we might
make out after our Remedy, 1 Cor. 3.18. Romans 7.24 25.

14. Q. Wherein stands this self Examination?

A. In setting a part some time before we receive solemly to seek our
Reconciliation with God, and to prove unto our selves. 1. In the Doctrine of
the Trinity. John 173. 2. In the Mystery of redemption. John 173. 3. In the
Nature, End, and uses of the Sacrament, 1 Cor. 11.29.
Secondly, our Faith. 1 Studying out the Conditions, Comforts, and Fruits of
the promises. 2. Relying on the Free grace of the Covenant, wherein God
undertakes both his own part and ours. 3. Laying the promises to our hearts
and lives to try out our own interests in them, 2 Cor. 13.5. Heb. 11.6.
Thirdly, our Repentance. 1. In a through sight of, and a proportionable sorrow
for our manifold breaches of Covenant with God, Jsa. 1.13 16. 2. In our firm
purposes and promises to God, to Abominate all our former sins, and to serve
the Lord Christ sincerely and constantly in newness of life, Psalm. 119.106.


15. Q What are the benefits which we Receive in the Sacrament of the Lords
Supper?

A. Two especially; as 1. The sealing of all the comforts of Gods promises to
the truly humbled an^ ^eleeving soul, Romans 4.11. 2. The engaging of the heart
to keep closer in communion with Jesus Christ, 1 Cor. 10.16 21.
In both which after we have received we are carefully to observe the force of
the Sacrament how it works against Infidelity and the power of corruption.

16. Q What may be our Evidences of our interest in the Covenant of grace?

A. Chiefly these three. 1. The witness of the Spirit of Adoption in the vital
operations of the New birth, Romans 8.14.16. 2. The Efficacy of the promises
purging us from all filthiness of flesh and spirit, and perfecting holiness
in the fear of God, 2 Cor. 7.1. 3. The proper effects of a living Faith, as,
1. Acting the life of Christ in us, Gal. 2.20. 2. Purifying our hearts, and our
consciences from dead works, Act. 15.9. Heb. 9.14. 3. Working by Love, by
Patience, and by all other sanctifying gifts, Gal. 5. Romans 6 5.24. 4. Carrying
us with an holy boldness, and with full assurance to the throne of Grace, Heb.
4.16.10.22. 5. Lifting us up above the world, sin, and sufferings, or any
temptation that interrupts the Grace or Peace of our Communion with the Lord
Jesus, 1 John 5.4. Romans 8.38, 39.
