THE CONCLUSION OF Lieuten: General Cromwells Letter to the House of Commons,
concerning the taking of BRISTOLL: Which was contained in the Original,
(signed by himself) but omitted in the Printed Copy, which is Authorized by
the House of Commons, (though there was a whole Page left blanke in that
sheet): Whereby the World may know, how both Truth it self, and that worthy
Gentleman are wronged (as well as other men,) either by the Printer or some
others.
PResbiterians, Independents* all had here the same Spirit of Faith and prayer,
the same presence and answer, they agree here, know no names of difference;
pity it is, it should be otherwise any where: All that believe have the real
Unity which is most glorious, because inward and spiritual in the body and to
the head. As for being united in forms (commonly called uniformity) every
Christian will for Peace sake, study and do as far as Conscience will permit;
And from brethren in things of the mind, we look for no cumpulsion, but that
of Light and reason.

In other things God has put the sword into the Parliaments hands, for the
terror of Evil dooers, and the praise of them that do well; if any plead
exemption from it, he knows not the Gospel. If any would wring it out of your
hands, or steal it from you, under what pretense so ever, I hope they shall
do it without effect, That God will maintain it in your hands and direct you
in the use thereof, is the prayer of

Your humble servant, Oliver Cromwell.
From Bristoll, this 14th. of September. 1645.
