The first Book, divided into three Chapters.

Chap. I. The description of the World in man's heart: with the Articles of the
Christian Faith. Chap. II. A description of one spirit acting in all, which
some affirm is God. Chap. III. A description of the Scripture according to the
history and mystery thereof.

Dear Friend and Reader,
HEre is Divinity and Philosophy dissected and laid open to the view of the
world, by a mad man; therefore if the manner and phrase be not so exact, as
that it is not able to satisfy the curious eye, or abide the censure of the
nice Mercuriallist (who is apt to carpe more at the misplacing or neglect of
words then matter) it is no great wonder, nor care I whether they be satisfied
or not, seeing my intention is to declare the matter according to my own mad
mind, unto those who will under stand it after my mad manner: The reasons why
I expose it to the general view needs not much be questioned or inquired after
in this age, wherein the whole world is full of so many distracted heads and
religions (which say, Lo here, and lo there is Christ) that many are put
besides their wits in straining them out of joint to inquire with Pilate what
is truth; by which it may be gathered that in many ages the same has been in
obscurity without being discovered or searched after: nor are there any to be
found amongst the multitudes of those who bear the name of men, that are able,
or at least willing to rectify them by resolving the question. Wherefore I
have thrust my self upon the Theater in this mad posture and act, in
publishing my mad mind amongst the rest, to prove if any will accept my
madness for truth, the which I dare not avouch for truth to all, because I
know most men are full of self conceited or imaginary knowledge; so that if the
highest, divinest and greatest wisdom and truth that can be written or
expressed by letters, were laid down to them, they will not admit of, nor
receive it in their understandings, but will esteem of it as the greatest
blasphemy, folly and lie in the world. Besides, I am not so ignorant in my
madness, but that I know likewise that several eyes and judgments will look
upon and into it, and according to their eye or judgment, it will appear to
or in them, and so I do expect their thoughts and verdicts to pass upon it:
therefore I say, I will not, nor dare not maintain it to them, in respect of
their various capacities, conceptions and dispositions, but only leave it to
the diversity of censures as every one does find it to or in them, earnestly
desiring that they may understand the best sense for (...) or profit, which is
my real intention. As also I propound it for a trial, (...) there be any in
this uncharitable and self loving age, that out of true love and sound
judgment will extend his hand to help a mad man, and answer him so as is able
thoroughly to rectify and cure his judgment in demonstrating to him by more
probable, substantial and apparent reasons, his error in this following
Treatise, and be his director to a more sublime and higher truth in the thing
treated of. I doubt not but the truly divine, and right reasonable, or the
truly wise, able and sound in judgment, is so wise and good, that he is able
and willing to cure distempers of all sorts, to whom I am always willing to
submit my judgment upon better grounds: however, dear Reader, whosoever thou
art, whether friend or enemy, whether wise or mad man, I wish thee no less
happiness then to my self, who desire to be in my wits and right mind to
God, although a fool and mad man to the world: if those things spoken here,
trouble or offend thee, so as thou conceive hatred or malice against me for the
same, or that thou think that any prejudice may redound to thy own or
others judgments (or religions) by this ensuing Discourse, I beseech thee
pacify thy self first, and judge not rashly, or before thou know, nor
blame me, but first enter in judgment with thy self, by pondering and
considering in thy self, that if thou had ever under stood or known things
aright thou could never have been offended at any thing spoken, or at least
intended for thy good, much less could the words of a mad man have stumbled or
offended thee, for to the wise all things are profitable: but if any do reap
good thereby, let them know that out of a hearty love I earnestly intend good
to them and to all, and wish from my heart that they may attain unto the
perfection thereof, for their own everlasting peace and tranquillity in mind:
nor is it impossible but perhaps that which seems to be a lie and madness to
some, may appear to be the real truth and true wisdom to others; thus
wishing thee the true knowledge of all things and their cause, together with
the fruition and enjoyment of the truest happiness, which is God: I am thy
true friend.

CHAP. I. The description of the world in Man's heart.
AS for the creation of the world, it is in Man's heart, as Ecclesiastes says
in the third Chapter, it is internally; and in the first of the Hebrews, he
says that God has created the worlds, speaking in the plural number; that
is, he makes a first and second creation of Man: now the creation of Gods first
world in Man, is Man and God joined together from eternity; and this was that
deep silence and waters that God moved or brooded on, and he separated the
waters from the waters, for God is that light and holy spring, and Man is that
dark and black water; and God is the Heaven, and Man is the Earth; and the
separation is the first day for distinctions sake that we may know God from our
selves, I mean the firmament and separating light and darkness is the
distinction; and that is the first day in Man which is called the Evening and
the Morning: So these waters is the flowing of the minds of God and Man which
was separated; the mind of God flows above the firmament and in his own
light or sphere or in himself. The Man, his mind flows under the firmament
and on the earth or in himself, that his dry land or earth might appear; and
this separation of minds or waters is the second day or light that discovers
two, one discoursing to the other, and says, let us make or do these things,
and so this day or light has its evening and morning, which is a whole day:
and God says, let the Earth bring forth fruits; now the desires and affections
are the herbs and fruits with their seeds, that is their proper selves that
brings forth their own kind in Man, for every affection, thought and
inclination, has its own seed in it self, and does produce its own fruit out
of us, which is good in their own kind; and the appearance of these things in
us is the third day in man, with its evening and morning, for the evening and
morning makes the whole day. And God said, let there be light in the
firmament, which light is the Son and glory of God and Man Christ Jesus, and is
the light which distinguishes or discovers the minds both of God and Man to
each other: and the Moon that is in this distinction that rules the night or
the dark Man, is the instruction, and the good advises, that the Sun or true
day light shines through them to the Man, and all the stars in this
firmament are the lights of Gods graces that is several to the Man to
enlighten his dark heart that he might see the glorious Son through these
gimmering lights, for his dark eyes is not able at the first to behold the
glorious Son, but by degrees the holy God brings him to it; so these holy
lights in the Man are the fourth day with his evening and morning. And God
said, let the waters bring forth foul and fishes; which waters are the flowing
sea of thy mind, and the foul or birds are the flying fantasies that fly
about the heaven of our souls, and the fishes are thy delightful thoughts that
swim up and down in thy mind, and all these are proper selves with their
seeds, and are very good in their own kind, and are useful for the Man, and
for his pleasure and delight; and this is the fifth day in man with its evening
and morning. And God said, let the Earth bring forth all beasts and creeping
things; which beasts is the passions of thy mind, some of which thou may
use and eat of, and some thou must keep under and not eat of, as the Hare which
is thy fearful passions, and the Swine which is thy voluptuous appetite, and
the birds and fishes (which will not be orderly) thou must keep under and not
taste of; for we must reign and keep our fantasies (that is the ravenous and
destructive birds) hood winkt, that they may not see nor go beyond their
limits to disturb the soul with their disorderlinesse; for David did kill a
Lion and a Bear, and fought with Goliath and killed him; which Lion is thy
strong unruly appetite, and the Bear is thy unorderly and bloody self will,
and the Goliath is that evil or devil, that is thy unreasonablenesse that
raileth against thy God, or good which is thy reasonableness. Now these
thoughts and fantasies (unruly passions, appetites and unreasonablenesse) must
be kept under and ruled, or else they will disturb and destroy thy soul, but
kept under, ruled and ordered are useful to the Man; but this keeping them
under is death to them, for they are mad and cruel (let loose) and keeps the
soul and reason in all subjection, so that no good shall appear in the soul
but they will destroy it; for these beasts, birds and fishes, will destroy and
devour all the rest of the peaceable beasts, birds and fishes (as the dove, or
thy innocence or meek lamb, or peaceablenesse) and all those peaceable
creatures that would be at rest in thee, and please thee, and give thee rest:
for Sampson killed that Lion that came roaring upon him, that was his strong
and ravening appetite that would have devoured him, so he says afterward (when
he had overcome his ravening appetite) there came sweetness out thereof where
with he was refreshed; for he says, out of the eater came meat, and out of the
strong came sweetness, so that appetite that would have devoured him (keepst
under and set upon the love or desire of goodness) was meat and sweetness to
him. And God and Man said, let us make or set forth our image, which is male
and female, that is true righteousness, holiness and pureness, that should
rule over these birds, beasts, fishes, and all creeping things that moves in
the world of Man; and they give them names according to their natures and
qualities that they see in them: so this is the sixth day in Man with its
evening and morning, and all things is good in their kind. So the rest of Gods
discovering (or creating things) is that holy rest and dwelling of God and good
in the Man, for he has showed Man all things, and he discovers himself the
last, which is the best and holy rest and peace of things, and is the Sabbath
or seventh day with its evening and morning, the holy rest in man which he
should have kept for ever, and never have lost or broken: this rest is the holy
Godhead or breath of life that is given to the Man, and is light of his light,
and the life of his life, or breath of his breath; for Man without God is dead,
and his life and breath is death without the life and breath of God: So God
gave himself into the hands of Man to see what he would do with him, for he
loves the Man as himself. Now when the Man sees that God has given all
things in his own power, then comes the subtilest beast that is in the earth
of Man to entice or allure the Man, and to be master of all in him, and to rule
all things, and this beast is the wisdom of the flesh, or the wisdom of the
dark man which is sensual and devilish; and now the Man or female having her
will, and being free, having all things in her possession by the free gift and
love of God to her, desires to rule by her will and wisdom, and to let God
alone, and forsake his counsel and wisdom, and rule by herself and wisdom,
which is blind, sensual and evil, and this is her guide, and she will be her
own God to do her will, lusts and desires, and she in blindness will
distinguish between good and evil, who knows nothing at all but by the light
of Gods grace and goodness in her, which she has forsaken, and is ruled by
her own self and wisdom, that calls good evil, and evil good, and so it is
all lies and falsehood which the Man is ruled by; and so he is lost and damned
from God and goodness, and is joined to a lie and deceitfulness, and has
made God taste of her deceitfulness by her forsaking him: for she that is his
wife has forsaken him which is her mate and yoke fellow, and so he is lost and
hidden from her, and is under her earthly man of sin, which is in hell: for
that which should be uppermost is undermost (which is God) and that which
should be undermost is uppermost, for all thy brutiall passions and beastly
appetites (which should be keept undermost and ruled) is uppermost, and they
rule and govern thee, and all things in thee, for they keep God and goodness
under them and will not let them appear in thee, but kills and crucifies them
as soon as they appear in thee to give thee counsel for thy good; and so the
Lamb of God is slain in the beginning of our first world, or at the first
appearance, discovering and distinctions of things in us; for in one infancy
or nonage, all things is in silence, and we are a Chaos, and God is in this
silence, and with us in this Chaos, and in his time and when he saw the
ripeness of this Chaos, he set forth all things in us, and made them appear
in their order and places to us, and gave all things to us as our own, and in
our own power, because we should be free to bind our selves or stand free
according to our pleasure; for there was life and death set before us, so that
we might bind our selves to either or stand free as we were, and bind our
selves to neither, because that Man should not complain, nor grieve in his
spirit that he should be tied against his will to any thing, therefore all men
appear free to stand or fall, or bind themselves to what they please: but Man
ties himself to the brutiall passions of his mind, and leaves God and
goodness, and so they be hidden and lost in him, so thy passions, rules and
domineers over thee, and thy blind wisdom or subtle serpent carries thee into
all misthiefe and lies, and deceives thee, and makes thee have a hellish mind
which is a cage of all unclean and hateful birds: for thou art the kingdom of
hell, and thou art full of hell hounds, dogs and swine, wolfes, and Tigers,
Lions, and Bears, Serpents, and Cockatrices, and all venomous things, so that
there is no good thing in thee in thy off-fallen estate, for if God or
goodness should appear in thee, thy beastly and divilish crew would destroy
him out of thee, so that thy God or goodness does lie under thy earth (or
under thy hellish being) which a mighty power holding forth a slickering
sword, which is the law of sin that cries vengeance, and says, I will repay,
and says, thou must dye, and all thy hellish crew: for this law requires death
for death, eye for eye, and tooth for tooth, for thou have killed God and
goodness, and these murders flies in thy face by this mighty power with the
sword of justice in his hand, that stands to execute thee and kill thee for
killing: and this is the patience of the Saints, which says that they that
kills by the sword must dye by the sword; for this is justice that the
blood-thirsty might drink blood, and so Man thou shall never be happy till
this justice is executed upon thee and upon all thy hellish crew, and that thou
art dead, buried, damned and lost with Christ and God, and that thou and thy
wicked crew is seen no more, and thou art turned to thy dust, and into thy old
silence with God again, and art as if thou were not; and then God in his time
will create thee a new world, and renew all things again in thee; for there
shall be new heavens and a new earth, wherein shall dwell righteousness in
thee. David says, Create in me a new heart, O Lord, and renew a right spirit
within me; that is, when thy old world, or Adam is destroyed in thee, that Man
of sin, or that vessel of wrath that was borne for destruction or to be
damned; for our old world is to show the glory and justice of God and his
mighty power in the Man, and to the Man, and that the Man should see himself
lost and damned; and when he is come to this pass then shall he see his mighty
power in saving him, and creating him a new creature or new world: for the
first world was to show the manhood, and all her glory, what she is, and that
all things were given into her hands to do what seemed good in her own eyes:
and she let all things run disorderly and spoiled all things, and that which
she should have governed did govern her, so that all things is turned upside
down, and Man sees his own strength and wisdom is foolishness: for God lets
man alone with his first creation, to show him what he is in his own freedom;
and if man had not been left alone and free, and had not had all things in his
own power, he would have repined, therefore he was left free to see his own
weakness and inability: so he desired to be his own God and ruler, therefore
God gave man all things in his power, yea even himself also, to see how he
would use him, for God saw man's covetous desires, and so God put himself and
all things else into his hands to do what seemed good in his own eyes, and so
nature or man appeared, for that that is natural is first, and is the first
Adam, and that which is spiritual is last, and last Adam or God; for the first
man Adam is earthly, and the last Man or Adam, is the heavenly or Godhead Man:
so man if he desres not to be changed, or become the last Adam, shall remain
for ever in his first estate, creation or first world, for his first world is
his misery, because he desires to be his own guide, and his blind wisdom is
his own destruction; and because he disregards all good, so he shall be with
himself and his hellish crew till he is weary of himself, for he has given
himself to pride, which makes him think he is better then other men, which is
a lie and a deceit: and he is given to covetousness of the riches of this
world, which all perish with the using; and he is given to luxury, gluttony and
drunkenness, which makes him ready to starve, another time for mispending the
goods he gets to maintain his livelihood: and he is given to seek honor
and worldly estimation, to wrath and furiousness, about these things which are
all lies and vanities, and perish with the using; and to backbyting and evil
surmising one another, to murder in secret and openly, to hatred malice and
hypocrisy, with all uncharitableness, about these lies which all perish with
the using, for here is nothing but howling, crying, sighing and mourning, about
these lies and deceiveable things: for when pride has exalted a man to honor
and great estimation, then he rejoyees, and that is his heaven or God to him;
and straight envy in another man is troubled at this his honor and greatness,
and devises some plot to throw him down, and when he is thrown down, that is
hell and death to him, then he sighs, mourns and grieves for this deceiveable
lie; and the covetous man he covets the riches of this world, and will cosen,
lie and cheat any man to make himself rich thereby, and many times comes fire
and destroys his riches, or one backbyter or slanderer or other, devises some
mischief against him, and brings him under the penalty of some law of men,
that he pretends he has broken, whereby all his riches that he has gotten
is lost and taken from him, then he mournes and grieves, because this
deceiveable god has left him, and is fled, leaving him comfortless; and the
glutton and drunkard that lives in luxury and voluptuousness (which is his
heaven or god) when penury, want and grievous diseases comes upon him, then
cries he out against himself, and grieves at his folly, which is a hell to
him, now when it is too late; yet so soon as he recovers health and means
again, he returns as bad as he was before, like the dog to his own vomit, and
the sow that is washed to her wallowing in the mire: and the murderer that in
his wrath and choler does kill a man (which murder in his passion is the
heaven or god of lies that pleased him) afterward when the law of sin, or
justice of man, comes to execute him, then justice or the law of sin executing
its office, proves a hell unto him: therefore if thou desire no harm to be
done to thee, thou ought not to do any to another, but if thou do, this
revenge (or justice in him whom thou wrongest and does to him as thou would
not he should do to thee) retort^ back upon thy self, and thy own conscience
cannot deny but that it is just and good, although it be death and hell to
thee, and that thou can not abide to suffer it, for thy justice and law of
sin says, an eye for eye, tooth for tooth, and life for life: the moral Law
and ten Commandments is in thy self, and it is thy own natural desires to
them, for thou love God or good with all thy soul, mind and strength to be
done to thee, and thou do naturally love thy neighbor as thy self, because
he is thy Samaritane, and does good to thee, for thou do naturally love those
that do thee good, and that is reasonable; thou do love the Sabbath day, for
naturally thou do love rest, and naturally thou do love and honor the
place from which thou came which is thy father and mother; thou do not
naturally desire to be killed, therefore thou say, I must not kill; thou
do not desire any should take thy natural propriety from thee, nor falsehood
to be done to thee, therefore thou say, I must not wrong another man by
enjoying his wife and propriety, or rob or steal from him his right, or what
he has labored for, for the labourer is worthy of his hire; thou do
naturally hate to have a false accusation on thee, therefore thou do say, I
must not bear false witness against any one, and so the rest is what thou
would not have done to thee that thou must not do to another; for S. Paul
cried out against himself, and said, that he did the thing he hated, and did
disallow, and did not the thing that he did allow and love, but sold himself
under the law of sin which he hated; for this law and curse is added because of
the transgression, which is just to reward every man according to his works,
for this law of works saves no man, but condemns all because all men have
sinned; and as long as man lives in the fleshly lusts of sin and concupiscence,
he is under this law of sin and curse, and cannot please God: but the world is
mistaken of Paul, and thinks that he meant and said that as long as he lived in
the flesh (or in this organicall creature of the four elements of clay) he
should sin; if this were the meaning of St. Paul, sure he must kill himself,
and advise all men to do the like, or else they could not please God, for that
which hinders us from pleasing of God must be taken out of the way; but Paul
says, that Christ has taken him away from the curse and law of sin by faith,
which faith is the power of persuasion, and convincing the heart of sin and
unrighteousness, and the works of faith is to crucify the sinful flesh and
lusts, and to be obedient to God and goodness, and that faith of Christ saves
thee: and Paul says, that he thanks God he is dead, and that Christ is now his
life, and that he lives now by the faith of the Son of God, which is by his
loving persuasions, and that confidence and reality of truth which he found by
the obedience of Christ in him to God and goodness, and so that flesh of Paul
is dead and crucified to him, so that it is evident by the sense of Scripture
that Paul meant that flesh of sin, and not the organicall creature that he then
lived in: for we know nothing of God nor of the devil, but what we see in our
selves: for St. John says, what we have heard and seen and tasted, that
declare we unto you; for we must not imagine the powerful and mighty Godhead
to be any Idea, Image, or likeness of any thing, but what he has declared
himself to be to us; for it is said, that Christ is in us, and God is in
Christ, so that the Godhead lives bodily in us that has ceased from sin, for
of that omnipotent and mighty power that upholdeth and discovers all things,
we know nothing neither of our selves or any thing else but what he pleases
to discover unto us: therefore in thy first creation, or first birth, God
discovers thy self to thee which is Esau or Adam, and thou have all things in
thy possession, and thou art the God and Lord of all, for thou art the God of
this first world that has blinded thine own eyes with thy serpent subtilty
and wisdom of the flesh, and thou art ashamed of the naked truth, that is the
light of Gods grace to discover and lay all things naked and bare before thee;
but thou coverest and hides the truth with the leaves of thy own fruits, for
thou art ashamed of the truth, and when God calls thee in the cool of his day,
and that his light and fire begins to wax cold in thee, thou hidest thy self
from him and art ashamed of him as thy nakedness, for thy wisdom has opened
thine eyes to thy self will, and has shut them up to the naked truth, and so
thou art lost and damned from God and goodness, for thou have deprived thy
self of him, and has hid God in thy self as thy shame, for thou art ashamed
to come before him, and therefore thou hidest him with thy partition walls of
sin, and now thou art clothed with thy own death, that is the law of sin,
and thy own justice in thee; for the skins of thy innocence that thou have
lulled within thee (which is the death of God and Christ) is thy clothing, and
so thou art clothed with the death of God in thee, and God now never appears
to thee but in this death, with terror and fear which terrifies thee, and this
justice of terror and fear lies in the death of God, which thou have slain
and dis-regarded, and is that slickering sword that keeps this death (which was
the tree of life) till thou be killed by it as thou have killed: as it is said,
I have been dead but now am alive for evermore, for this tree of life is the
Lamb of God that is slain in the beginning of our first world, and so he
lies dead to us till our wicked world is at an end, and this our wicked world
shall bring forth nothing but thorns and thistles, which is sins that shall
prick thee to the heart, and thou shall eat of thy own fruits with the sweat
of thy brows; that is the labor of thy sins, that toyleth thee with their
laboriousnesse, and this toil shall thou have with thy sins till thou
returnest to thy dust again, or to thy old silence wherein thou were before,
and thy serpent (or sleshly wisdom) shall go creeping on thy earthly being
of sin, and shall live on their dust or first original, which is lies, and is
thy subtle serpents food, and thy husband which is thy lie or unreasonablenesse
that thou have united thy self to) shall rule and domineere over thee, and thou
shall be subject to his will, and all thy children or sins that he begets
of thee thou shall bring forth in sorrow, and they shall be a pain unto thee;
for what is said to Adam is said to both, for she or he is one, and is the
female of God, for man or woman signifies both, and this sword of justice which
stands in the death of Christ, is the enmity the seed of the woman or human
nature, that shall break the serpents head, and destroy his seed; and this
enmity shall bruise the humanities heel or foot that he shall never walk any
more in false ways; so this enmity or sword stands in the death of Christ,
crying vengeance and says, that this world (or Adam, Edom, or Esau) is the
child of wrath, and he has prepared or ordained himself to destruction, and
so this whole world of Man is destroyed, damned and utterly lost, and Man shall
never be happy in his first birth, because of his fall, for he must be dead,
buried and borne again, or else he shall never enter into the Kingdom of
heaven, for his own nature is wrath, but God did not make him so, but his
nature was so for ever, for according to Scripture we are the children of wrath
by nature, and at the first we appear so, and God did make him appear to
himself what he was, and gave himself and all things into his power, that he
might not complain, and that the Man might see how he would use God himself,
and all things in him, and so he destroys himself, God, and all things within
him, and has ordained himself and all to be lost, so the first creation in
Man is lost, and God shows Man his miserable condition in this death and loss
of God and goodness, and the power of God that lies in this death, is called
the death of Christ, or the two edged sword that stands to divide the soul
asunder, or that flesh of Christ that is the curtain that stands before the
most holy place, or Sanctum Sanctorum: and this power of Christ is in hell
under our earthly being and Man of sin, till we and all ours is turned to
dust again, and this power or death stays with patience and long sufferance
under us in hell till we are weary of our selves and sins, for we grieve the
Spirit of God by whom we are sealed, and he daily shows us our own misery, and
toil and sorrow sin does make in us, and this toil we shall have for ever
till we are weary of our selves and desire to be ended with all our hearts, and
to forsake our selves and our own wicked world, and all that is within us that
is wicked, then does this holy power, Man himself in us, and destroys us and
all within us, and turns us to our dust again; and when we are in silence with
God again, then does he create us anew and make us a new world, and prepares
us a bride for himself, a heavenly Jerusalem, a City and house for God, and he
is our Lord and husband, and he is a holy and righteous ruler, and does govern
all the faculties of our soul in peace and love, with all orderlinesse and
union, for then the Lion (our strongest passions) is in peace with the lamb or
innocence, and all our other beasts, birds and fishes (which is our
fantasies) is orderly and in peace; then shall the child or innocence lay
his hand on the Cockatrice hole, and the Wolves, Bears and Lions shall be
together, and one shall not sting or hurt the other, for God is King and ruler
in man, which orders all things well and in peace in him, and the Son of glory
or God, shines seven times more brighter then he did in the former world, and
this glorious world or Man of God shall last for ever and ever, in his glorious
transcendent brightness, and there is no sorrow or pain in this world, but
everlasting ravishing joys and sweet content of mind; for this holy God does
ravish the soul continually with his delectable pleasures, so the soul is
ever satisfied; for God when he is our Lord, and we have given our selves to
him, he uses us thus sweetly, and does give us all pleasure and content, but
when he gave himself to us in our first creation, and first world, we were
ashamed of him, and hid and destroyed him from us, but he is not ashamed of us,
but uses us with all love; for nature appeared first and in that Adam all dyed,
for God and Christ was Son and borne there, and he became mortal in this
nature, for God appeared there in weakness, which weakness is humility and
lowlines of spirit, with all gentleness and love; and when the wisdom of the
flesh (the serpents subtilty) had opened natures eyes to pride and high
mindedness, and to wrath, covetousness and envy, which eyes is the serpents
eyes, which is the evil eyes or the Devils, which the nature or man looked
through, which made him think that this high mindedness and pride, with
self-will, was a glorious tree, and that there was glorious fruit on it, and
that it would elevate him highly, and that he should be his own God and ruler,
and that he should know good and evil which he did by woeful experience, taste
of its good which had the evil in it, for it was full of confusion as was said
before, and was the man's toil: but he thought it was a glorious fruit, and
much to be desired, and so do all men that are in the first creation, and
first world: so when Man had tasted of pride, high mindedness, and self-will
(the forbidden fruit) he despised God which is humility and lowliness of
spirit and meekness, and was a shamed of this, and thought it foolishness, to
be humble, meek and lowly, for he thought this to be poor beggarly
nakedness, and was ashamed of such a lowly and beggarly mind as he thought it
to be, so he covered this meek and lowly spirit with his lofty high
mindedness, and so the divine, gentle and holy nature is in hell under this
filthy covering; and this is the covering upon God and Man, and is the
partition wall betwixt them, and so man has made the Devil god and lord of
all, and has given all that was given him into his hands, so God in man is in
the Devils power, and he reigns as King and Lord of all in this first world or
creation that is fallen into the Devils hards by man's will that gave it him:
for God gave man himself and all, and man delivered, and gave or sold him to
the Devil; for nature in the first creation is a Judas that is raised up to
destruction, and is the son of perdition that sells the innocent life in him,
and afterward he hangs and destroys himself, and puts himself wholly into
the Devils hands, and in the end of time when the man is weary of this wicked
world with all his soul and mind, and will, wholly return all into the hands
of God again, he takes all upon him with his mighty power and sword that
stands in justice hands, and redeems himself and the man out of the Devils
hands, for he comes to redeem himself the lost sheep of the house of Israel,
which was lost and hid in man, and covered with man's sins. Now this holy and
mighty power takes all upon him for he becomes our first borne Esau, Adam or
Edome, and will be our first world that is fallen, and will suffer with us and
for us, as if he had door all out sins, for when be has our man of sin on
him he gives the humanity power to endure this justice of the death of God for
his sins, and this sword of justice and Gods death does destroy death, and
this death or sword of God that frights and fears the man, is the beginning of
the wisdom of God in him to destroy sin, for the man in his first appearance
destroyed the Lamb of God or good, and then he and the Devil, the wisdom of
the flesh rule all in all in him till the man is weary of himself, and desires
this death of God to help him, and this death of God is his back parts that
made Moses face to shine, for the wrath, anger and frowns of God (which is his
back parts) is better for the man then the Devils face or smiles; and Gods
death is better for the man then the Devils life, and his hell better then his
heaven; for it is better to be in the house of mourning, then to hear the song
of fools, though man in his off fallen estate thinks it not so: but this death
and mortality of God (which is his back parts) does make our face shine, for
no man shall see his face and live, nor shall or can we see his face, glorious
countenance, and cheerful smiles till our man of sin is destroyed and rooted
out, and we return to our dust as we were before, and in silence with God
again; and so this death and mortality of God (which i^ his angry frowns and
the wrath of the Lamb that takes away the sins of our wicked world) is
entered into our Esau or Adam (which is the vessels of wrath prepared for
destruction) and is become our flesh which is dead in sins and trespasses;
and this death of God does destroy us which is death, for this Esau with the
death and wrath of God is a hunter, and does kill meat or venison for his
fathers supper, which venison is the wild and heathenish brutiall man whose
death shall reconcile us to God again: for in the fifth of the Romans he says,
that we are reconciled to God by the death of Christ, which death has
mortified us and killed our man of sin, so this death has given us power by
his death to destroy, kill and mortify ourselves, for this Christ after the
flesh or death, was it that lay under our earthly being, and said, that he was
a worm and no man, and that the great Bulls of Bashan gaped upon him to
devour him, which was our sins, and that the great water floods and seas of
our sins run over him, and he lay still, and the man of sin thought that he
had been asleep or dead, and did not see their evil works, but he made this
darkness (or dark man) his hiding place, and so he saw and heard all his
evil works; for he says, I create light, and I create darkness, that is
that, I set forth my self which is light, and I set forth man which is
darkness, and he regards not me, nor my light, because his deeds are evil,
and so I am hid in his darkness; but when the man is weary of himself, then
he seeks for me, and has need of me, though he thought I did not hear nor
see him before, then he runs to me and cries, and says, arise, O Lord, in
me, and thy enemies (which is my sins) shall be scattered and rooted out in
me; so this death or flesh of God (which is death) destroyesman (which is
death) in God in becoming his death or his flesh, for in becoming the man of
sin, he destroys man which is sin and evil of himself without this power
of the holy Godhead, which holy power he has given to the man to arraigne
himself before himself, and to condemn himself in himself and to execute
himself, and so make an end of the whole man of sin, and so he becomes dead
and buried with this power of the holy Godhead, for it is better be dead with
God, and to be at rest with him, then to be alive with the Devil, and to be in
torment in his hell: for this death of God is death to the sin (which sin
is death) and shall raise us up into everlasting immortality and ravishing
joys of mind: for he says, that that which never eye saw, nor care heard,
nor ever entered into the heart of wicked man (in his first creation) is now
revealed to them that love him, and those that are of the newborn creature,
and the second creation that love him, and are the men of God who are ruled and
governed by him; for he says, that the troubles and sufferings which we
endure (in the crucifying the man of sin in the former world) is not worthy of
that joy and sweet consolation that we shall receive, and shall be given to us
that has tasted of the death of Christ, and has gone through his sufferings
with him into the second world that is full of joy, for this end of Esau (or
Edom) is the end of the first creation, and the vessel of wrath that has
ordained himself to destruction, and God foreknew that he would do all these
things to himself, and gave him all in his hand that he should not complain,
and say he was tied from any thing, so that he was free, and might have stood
or fell; but he fell, and all Adams knows this, their own conscience accusing
them, for he made man upright and showed himself to be good, but he sought
out many inventions to destroy himself, yet God has mercy on him, and has
brought forth his elected seed to save him, which was Isaac or Jacob, that
wrastled with God in this dark night of man to save and bless him; for this
Esau was feign to sell his birthright, and was so hungry with hunting and
killing the man of sin that he had almost lost himself, but his brothers
pottage (which is love, and mercy, and power) was given him to strengthen him
to overcome the man of sin in himself; yet he thought this pottage should
not have taken away his birthright and destroyed his first creation, which he
wept for, although it was too late, for it was for his further good which is
hid from his eyes for a time, and whilst he is a hunting, for Jacob puts on
Esaus rough garment or flesh (which is the law of sin which made the man of sin
mad) and he thought to destroy this Jacob, or this second creation which
appeared in the man; but in the end when sin is destroyed, they will be
loving brothers, and one man of God, for this Jesus Christ (or seed of promise
the destroyer of sin) will make all peace and quietness, for this holy God is
in Christ reconciling the world to himself (in mortifying and cleansing this
man, and burnning up all the chafe of sin with unquenshable fire) that there
might be great love betwixt God and man again, for this Jesus was three days
and three nights in the man of sin, and in the heart of the earth, and was
carried into his wildernessed land, and was tempted of him, the manner whereof
shall afterward be expressed; for he showed Man all his filthiness, and how
wicked he was and regardlesse of God and goodness, and this was the first day
in him, and the night of that day was the death and wrath of God that appeared
in the Man, which did te^rifie and fear him, and was the wounds of conscience
that told him what he deserved, and he threw down himself at Gods mercy; and
the second day or light God gave him true grace and sorrow for his sins, and
the night of that day is that bloody fight in heaven between the Man of sin
and God, and that terrible agony and sweat of death was on the humanity; and
the third day or reign of Christ is that day that Christ shall reign a
thousand years in Man with death, which day is that power of patience and long
sufferance that lasts till the Man of sin is rooted out, for a thousand
years is but as one day with the Lord, and one day in this suffering and
reign of Christ is as a thousand years to the man; for he must reign till all
sin is subdued, and the night of that day all hell is broke loose to torment
the Man for a short time, but this Almighty power gives the Man a strong and
victorious power that he fights with himself and overcomes himself and all
his devilish crew, and so the wicked world is ended, and Man shall come into a
happy condition: There are many that think that Christ will come and reign a
thousand years here on earth personally, but they will be deceived, for they
look and judge of the Scripture after the outward appearance, which is not
righteous judgment, for we are to look on it with a spiritual eye, and then
shall we see it as it is, for the looking on it as a history (and not as it is
a sacred and holy mystery) makes so many false Religions; for the birth of
Christ in this elementary world was after a extraordinary manner, and not after
the ordinary manner of men, for he was not as the seed of man, nor did the
Virgin Mary feel any manner of pain in bringing him forth (as the wise and
learned hold) nor does the Scripture make mention of her pain as they do of
others, as Rebeckah Isaacs wife, and Rachel Jacobs wife, for the Divinity is a
spirit, and the humanity is a spirit, and the Divinity and the humanity joined
together in conjunction as man and wife, is but one spirit, and spirits bring
forth a spirit, and can do no otherwise; for this Jesus Christ is a Spirit,
and is the Spirit and life of God that is sown in our hearts and spirits,
which makes us cry, Abba Father, for he was and is a Spirit coming forth of
God and man that were and is spirits, and that organicall body or figure that
he seemed to be in (and to eat and drink, and that he was like flesh and
blood) was as three Angels that appeared to Abraham, which he did dress a kid
for, who seemed to be men, and did eat and drink with them as they thought ^
so Christ seemed to be in that figure and flesh of the man, but he was a real
spirit, for with that body he walked on the sea, the which Peter could not do
with his heavy body, but did sink; and Christ did hide himself many times and
could not be found, for he did walk in visibly, and when they did leek him to
destroy him they could not find him till he pleased to give himself into their
hands, and he could come with his body into any room the doors being shut, as
he did after the resurrection come to his Disciples, saying, Peace be unto you,
and he did eat a broyled fish, and they knew him by eating and breaking of
bread; and there is surely some secret mystery in that, for when he walked
like a gardener they knew him not, but by breaking of bread; and Thomas would
not believe that it was the body that was crucified (because he could come
through a chinke of the door as he thought) till Christ showed him the print
of his nails, after which, he said, he believed because he saw those things;
but Christ said to him, they were more blessed that believed and saw not, but
believed and trusted in God without the death of Christ: for if we had believed
and trusted in God, we should not have fallen and sinned, but have been more
blessed, for the whole had not had need of the Physician: but we all have
fallen, and need the death of Christ to make us whole again, and we cannot
believe till we see the print of his death and nails in our hearts and
spirits, which he has taken on him, and is now his humane nature; for his
Godhead and humanity is in us, if Christ be in us, for he is whole Christ in
us, God and man, nor can he be divided and be in part in us; and if he had a
corporal body of clay (consisting of four clements, made up of flesh and
blood as ours is) it were impossible, and against reason that he could be in
us; therefore look into the Scripture with spiritual eyes, for that Christ
that seemed to have a body to be nailed on a cosse was a spirit, and showed to
thee how he is nailed with thy sins to patience and long sufferance in thee
which is death to him, for he grieveth and mourns for thee; for we grieve the
holy Spirit by whom we are sealed and made the sons of God, and we quench and
put out the Spirit of God from us, and this is death or grief and pain to God
for us; for there is no death to any but grief and pain, and no life but joy
and pleasure, and sweet content, for the soul is an eye, and is composed of
joy and harmony, and desires to fly into harmony which is God; and sorrow and
pain is a living death and dying life; nor know I any other life and death but
these, though there is some other things that is called life, as stirring and
motion and the leaving the body is called death, and in forsaking any thing, I
am said to be dead to that, and that dead to me. The Son of God, Jesus Christ
was and is a Spirit, God and man, which now does live and walk amongst us, and
we do really kill and crucify him every day to ourselves, and the flesh and
blood of Christ which he would have us eat and drink, was not such flesh and
blood as ours is; but there were then some that followed Christ as foolish as
we are now, that when Christ spoke these words they did leave him, for they
thought he meant they should eat this sigure or organ that he seemed to be in
when he was a Spirit. The flesh of Christ which he would have us eat is his
blood and passion, which is the death and mortifying of our sinful flesh;
which St. Paul says, so long as he lived in he could not please God: so Christ
would have us eat his flesh and drink his blood, and join our sinful flesh
to his flesh; so his death or flesh, does destroy our death or sinful flesh;
and so that death of Christ does save us, and reconcile us to God again. Now I
know no other flesh of Christ but this flesh which is the new and living way,
is the curtain and veil before the most holy place, and all that will be
saved must enter through this veil; and when this veil or flesh or death has
done the work he came for, he must be taken out of the way, for no flesh and
blood that is death, can enter into the Kingdom of Heaven; therefore when we
enter into the most holy place, the veil or flesh of Christ is rent in twain
from the top to the bottom, and so the death and flesh of Christ is finished
and cease, and he is taken out of the way; for there is no mourning, nor
wayling in the most holy place, for all tears are wiped from our eyes. Now he
says, that he (Christ after the flesh) must be taken out of the way, or else
the comforter will not come, which is the life and ravishing joy of Christ: And
Paul says, though he knew Christ after the flesh: now he knew him so no more,
as I shall speak of all these things more at large in this book. Now when
Melchisedeck appeared on the earth he was without father and mother, and he
seemed to Abraham to be a man, a Priest and King, and blessed him when he came
from the slaughter of the Kings, which are the seven deadly sins: This
Melchisedeck is that Christ that was before Abraham; as it is said, Before
Abraham was, I am; and this Christ that appeared in the end of time, is that
Melchisedeck that was before Abraham, and that Elias that was carried up into
Heaven in a fiery chariot with fiery horses, which was a Spirit and the power
of God, though he seemed to be a man of flesh and blood; for Elias is said to
be the power of God in man, and I believe that all mankind (when they have put
off this lower elementary body that is dead clay without Spirit) shall be like
Christ: Melchisedeck and Elias, which are spirits, and may assume any bodily
likeness as they were and did appear in these lower elements: my reason is
this, because Samuel assumed the likeness of his own body, and came to the
witch at Endor, and Moses and Elias appeared to Peter and Christ on the Mount;
so I believe any one may appear to their friends as many have, for there have
many appeared that have been killed in secret to discover their murders, and
many of the Saints appeared when Christ was crucified: certainly it was not
their lower elementary bodies of clay that appeared, but some aireall and
spiritual body they assumed, which was the likeness of their former and lower
elementary bodies, and like unto Christ's spiritual body that appeared like
flesh and was not flesh but to our appearance, and that it might discover to us
and tell us what we do internally and in our intellectual mau; and Christ
called Lazarus his spirit, and made him appear as if he had been in his former
flesh and blood; sure these things must be so, or what did become of Lazarus,
and where did he recide before Christ opened Heaven gates; for it is said,
that he is the first that rises from the dead, and opens heaven gates to all
believers: we read that Elias raised a child from death, and another when the
Prophets dead body did touch his dead body, the dead body of the Prophet did
raise the dead, so the dead did raise the dead, which is a miracle; therefore
there is some greater and further consideration in it; for certainly they could
not be dead, but this elementary body seemed to be dead, which was dead before
(never being alive) although it seemed to be alive whilst the spirit of man
lived in it, as I have spoken more at large in this book; therefore let us
consider well how all these things can stand together with reason, or else we
shall make a confusion of the holy written word of God that is given to lead us
into all truth; for there must be a reason given where Lazarus and all the
Saints were that appeared, whether they did dye again, or where they now be;
for we never read of any thing they did on earth since; for it seems they
have seen the last day before it comes to us, and before it came to Christ; as
the child that was raised by Elias, and the dead man raised by the dead
Prophet, and Lazarus that was raised by Christ, as also a maid, where did they
recide with their corporeal body of clay and elements till Christ did open
heaven gates ^ sure therefore the man must be a spirit, and has assumed and
taken this body out of the four elements, and casting it off again as a
borrowed garment, and may assume a more rarefied and aircall body to appear
in, as Christ, Melchisedeck, Samuel and Moses, for nothing is impossible; only
that may appear to our dark eyes to be flesh which is not, as the three
Angels to Abraham and to Lot; for we believe appearances to be that which they
are not in deed and in truth (which we find by woeful experience) the which
makes such contention, and cutting of throats about Religion; the cause of this
distraction is that we do not see things with a righteous eye.

I desire all friends and readers, who do read this book, and all to whose
hands it shall come, that you will look into it rightly, and not construe it
amiss, but as it is really intended for the good of all; and where I speak of
the death of God, and Christ in man, I do not mean that the Almighty and
powerful Godhead can dye or be lost, but as he is dead and lost to the man
that despises truth and treads it under foot; and so I mean that God is dead
and lost, and the truth lies in the streets of his heart (which is God, who is
that truth) and the two witnesses lie dead in the street of his heart
unregarded (which is mercy and righteous judgment and is God) which we should
have showed forth to all the world, even mercy, and righteous judgment, but we
have hid these witnesses. So I desire that the most holy and righteous God may
be your guide and director to lead you into all truth.

The true Articles of the Christian Faith.
1. I Believe in God the Father Almighty, maker of the holy Heaven and earth in
the man: I confess and acknowledge that the same is a true holy living God or
good, and that he is a mighty Spirit, and a perfect clear light that discovers
to the man the real truth of things, and how all things are in their places,
and in or to the Man, and he is the real being, the truth, light, life and
love to the Man, and this is his name light, life and love, for he is all this
to the man: for the love of God to the man was such that he brought him under
the law of discipline and correction, instructing him what to do for his good,
and convincing his conscience for what he has done to himself, and against
God or goodness; so he raises up all our sins as judges to condemn us for
what we have done, and they correct or punish us, for God (or goodness) has
put it in them to do it, and God has opened our eyes with his power to see
it, which makes us hate and condemn our selves for what we have done, and his
holy power or light has persuaded our hearts to have true sorrow and real
repentance for our sins, with a broken and a contrite heart and sorrowful
spirit, and so we begin to hate our selves and our sins, and do really forsake
them, and do confess that we do deserve to be for ever lost and damned, and
be deprived of God and goodness for ever, because we have chosen hell, death
and devil, and joined our selves unto it; but Gods mercy and goodness has
enlightened our hearts with his law, and has really corrected (...) for our
sin, and has brought us to the belief of Jesus Christ by his law or fatherly
correction; for he receives no son but whom he corrects, and none comes to
Jesus Christ but whom the Father drawea to him, and this drawing to Jesus
Christ is by the law of discipline, and this law is the river Jordan or
judgment, and John the Baptist (or the light of Gods grace) that does dip or
dye us in the river Jordan or Judgment of Gods glacious goodness, and this
his judgment does cleanse us from all our sins that were as red as searled,
and we come out as white as snow: and this is the first Baptism in the Fathers
Name.

2. I believe in Jesus Christ the only begotten Son of God or good, and that he
is the real substance of God, and that he is the goodness that proceeds
from God or good: And I believe that all good things are made in the man by him
and through him, and that all goodness does consist in him, and proceeds
forth of him into the man, for his goodness in us bears in us our sins by
his mighty power of patience and long sufferance, with grievous sufferings and
agonies which he has for our sins, and there he lies or reigns in us till
our sins be vanquished or rooted out by this mighty power of patience and
long sufferance; and when all our evil is overcome (by this power of his
goodness) then he delivers us (which is the Kingdom of God) to his Father
that God may be all in all.

3. I believe the Son of God or Righteousness, is borne of the holy virgin
Mary; which virgin is the pure humanity, and this pure humanity is
overshadowed by the Angel Gabriell, or the power of the most highest God; and
this Son or righteousness of God is begotten upon the humanity, and is the
promised seed to the man, which is borne for a blessing to all generations of
man, as was promised.

4. I believe that this holy seed of blessing, the Son of God, Jesus Christ
the Savior of us, has suffered death under Pontius Pilate the law of sin in
us, and that he dies for and to sin in us, and is dead and buried, and in
hell under our earthly being and man of sin: and he suffers for our sin in
this hell, for they be all upon him, and he is nailed to the cross of patience
to endure all the reproaches and blasphemies, contempts and false defamations
or accusations for our sins cause on him, and for the love of God and to us,
has taken us upon him that we should suffer with him all our own reproaches,
contempts and sins to condemn us for doing them, and that we should
condemn and forsake them, and be dead to them, and they to us, by the power of
Jesus Christ that saves us in us; and this is the baptism of the Son, and
is the fiery trials, or the baptism of fire with which he saves his own
body or us, which is the humane nature that he has taken on him to suffer for
and with, and that it might be saved through him, and by his power in us, and
whosoever does not suffer this death with Christ for their sins, that is, to
suffer under the law of sin (death for sin and to sin) the death of the
cross, which is the patience and long sufferance of Christ to the killing of
sin in us, he is no Christian; let him brag how much he will of his
Christianity, till he has tasted the death and life of Christ, and that all
this is come to pass in him; for they must all taste of this cup or passion,
and be baptized with his baptism: for if we do not suffer and dye with him,
we shall never rise and reign with him.

5. I believe that the holy God, has raised up his Son Jesus from the dead,
and that he was three days and three nights in hell under the earthly man of
sin, and in the heart of his earthly being; and the first day he shows and
discovers unto man his sins, and the night of the day does terrify and wound
the conscience, and does fear the man which is the law of sin, or the wrath of
God upon the man that sins. And the second day is the grace and power of
God, which gives the true sorrow and repentance for thy sins; and the night of
that day, is that bloody fight, in which is the sweat and agony of death in
thee that crucifies and kills thee for thy sins. And the third day is the power
of Christ that gives thee victory over death, devil, hell and sins, so that
thou art dead unto sin; and the night of this day is the patience and long
sufferance of Christ in thee till thou have overcome the evil one; for in this
day and night is the whole mystery of Christ finished, and the Son of God is
darkened in thee, and thou becommest dead and buried in him, and he in thee, so
the last day is coming on to thee which is the resurrection of Christ in thee,
and with thee, which is the new creature, or man of God, Jesus Christ, which
was dead in thee, and with thee, and when you have suffered together, you shall
reign together in perpetual joys with him in God, for ever, and for ever.

I believe that this Jesus, or our Savior, is ascended up to his Father, and
does carry them up that have suffered with him, and has cleansed them, and
prepared them a Kingdom for his Father, that God may be all in all in us, for
he, Christ after the flesh (which is death and mortification) must reign in us
till all sin be subdued, and then he delivers, us up to his Father: for he
says, except we eat his flesh and drink his blood there is no life in us;
therefore let us eat this flesh and drink this blood of mortification, and
killing and crucifying our sins: This was the flesh of Christ that St. Paul
spoke of, saying, though he knew Christ after the flesh, yet now he knew him so
no more: O that we had all eaten this supper of Christ, then were we happy, but
till then most unhappy; for we must drink this cup or passion, and show the
Lords death till he come in his life and glory.

7. I believe that Jesus shall come from the strength or right hand of God with
all his Saints or Angels, or the good motions which are thousands of them, and
they with Christ shall judge the quick and dead in us, which quick is himself
and all his Saints and holy Angels to live, reign and dwell in us, and judge
the dead sins never to live any more in us, but be damned and lost for ever out
of us: so this is the last day or light, or day of righteous judgment that
shall last for ever in us. O that it were so come to pass in all, and that
they might see this last and everlasting day or new day, which shall last for
ever and for ever.

8. I believe in the Holy Ghost, and that he is the ancient of days, and is
the love of the Father and of the Son, which is the reciprocal love of singing
one to one, and this holy love or Holy Ghost has joined God and man together,
and has pulled down all partition walls that hindered their coming together,
and has baptized or dipped or dyed the man in this his most holy life or holy
spirit, and has made him a holy house, Church or Temple for God to live and
dwell in, and Christ is the head stone or foundation of this most holy house. O
that all men were become this Temple or house of God to dwell in.

9. I believe that there is one holy Church, and this Church are all holy men
that are without sin, spot or wrinckle, for all holy men are the body of our
Lord Jesus Christ; that is, cleansed by him and made pure, for he is the head
of a pure body, and there is no sin in his body or Church, nor is he head of a
sinful body, therefore look to it you that are sinful men, for you are not
the members of Christ's body or Church of Christ, as you may see in the fifth of
the Ephesians, where it is evident that he says, that his body or Church is
without sin.

10. I believe that all sins are forgiven in this Church, for Christ has
forgiven them the sins that are past, and has covered them with his holy
life, so that those evils shall never rise against us more, but we shall live
and reign over devil, death and hell with Christ for evermore, and sit with
him at Gods right hand for ever and for ever.

11. I believe the resurrection of the flesh of Christ that is joined to the
humanity, and this flesh or death of Christ, with the humane nature shall arise
into immortality, and for this mortality of theirs, shall put on immortality,
and all death shall be swallowed in victoriousnesse; so happy art thou, O man,
that have put on the flesh or mortality of Christ; for this flesh or mortality
shall carry thee into everlasting immortality, and into everlasting life and
joy of holy minds.

12. I believe that there is but this one holy and everlasting life, and this
life is the holy life of God, and he has chosen the man to live in it, and to
her one with him for ever. Take it to heart, for this is the real truth, and
surely thou shall find it: so if thou seek for it, thou shall find it, and
it shall be so unto thee.

CHAP. II. A description of one spirit acting in all, which some affirm is God.
NOw what a spirit is, is to be considered; for all things appearing to the man
he gave them several names according to their natures, and as they appeared
unto him; for in Genesis it is said, that Adam the man, gave every thing and
creature his name according as his nature was to the man, and it was so, and
could be no otherwise; for the genius and wisdom of God in man gave these
several names by his inspirations and lights which he discovered to the man
how the natures and qualities of things were, and they are really so, for they
be named by the Spirit of God in man: but there are many cavellers that dispute
about it, and would destroy all order, and bring all into confusion; for they
say they cannot tell what a spirit is, nor what man or beast is, nor what fire,
water, earth or air is; yet they themselves see all these several things, and
their several natures and operations in them and to them; so that if these
things had no name they must of necessity give them some name, or else all the
world would be dumb, and have no discourse; for they could not discourse of
these several things (and their natures) unless they had names to call them
by that the one might understand the other, and know what subject they speak
of, and what each would have another to do; but these mad people love to
confound themselves.

A spirit is that internal fire, life and motion of all things, as the spirit
or fire, and life of herbs, and trees, which is named the negative spirit that
manifests it self to the world and all other spirits. Now there is another
spirit or sure that grows and blows it self up into one organ, and feels
any thing that touches it, and its name is the sensitative spirit. There is
another spirit, eye, light or fire, that grows and blows it self up into
an organ, whose name is called the rational spirit or eye of capability and
judgment, which discerns all things in their order and place, and this is
the man.

And there is another spirit, eye, light or fire, that is a motion joined to
the man, that discovers the real truth of all things to him for his good or
hurt, and his name is called the spirit of wisdom or God, and this is the
light or right eye to the man, that foreseeth all things for his good, if he
will regard his instructions.

And there is another spirit, eye, light or fire, that is a motion that moves
to the man that he feels in his intellectual, which is the spirit and eye of
darkness that looks into all things for the man's harm, the which if he
look through leads him into all folly and blindness, and works him into all
mischief; and this spirit is the destruction of the man, and brings him to
all misery and calamity; and this spirits name is called the Devil, the worker
of mischief; for these two spirits move to the man in his intellectual, and
he feeds, sees and hears them internally, and discourses with them as two
men discourse and talk one with another, and these spirits are isntrumental
to the man to persuade him to what he shall do, for he can do nothing but by
these instruments, the one for his good, the other for his harm, and he tasting
of both he knows the difference, and how opposite the onces to the other, and
how they change him and make him good or evil; for if any man does good by the
good instrument, he that is ruled by the evil instrument contradicts the good
works of the good, and the good instrument contradicts the man that is ruled by
the evil instrument: but there be some that say, the evil is good, and the
good evil, which cannot be so; for the good is good still to the man, and is
one and the same for ever, and the evil is evil still to the man, and is one
and the same for ever; for if thou do evil to any man that evil is evil to
thy self, and if that man that thou do evil to, should retort the like
back on thy self, then thou would quickly be sensible that it is evil, and
not call that evil good (falling upon thy self) which falling upon another
thou did, call good: for if thou should vassallize any man, abuse or starve
him, or cut off his limbs, and do him all the harm thou could, what good is
this to thee? surely thy conscience tells thee, it is evil and not good to
thee; for thou do not like to have those things done to thy self, for
retorting and falling back upon thy self thou find it evil: So thou art
evil and wicked. O man, whosonver thou art that do those things, and
teach another so to do, for thou teach him lies, that the evil is good,
and the good evil, and thy own conscience condemns thee in doing the evil,
and so does the conscience of the others whom thou teach so to do, also
defnding him with thy lies to deceive himself with, for thou ought not to
do any thing to any man that thou do not like to be done to thee, nor must
thou do that which thou would not have done back again; for thou see it
is evil, say what thou will, to deceive thy self, for thou do cosen thy
self with these vain delusions. Surely those that are of the mind that one
spirit acts in all, would (if it were not for sear of the laws of men) fall a
cutting one another throats, and do^ all mischief being devils one to the
other in their passion, for they will admit of no law of goodness for their
restraint. If but one man had this evil power to execute his will upon all the
world for pleasure then might it be thought to be good; but you see in all men
a desige to have their will, therefore thou must expect and it is just and
fight according to thy desert, that thou should be killed for killing, and
for stealing to restore double, or be his servant to work it out, and make
double satisfaction for his loss and troubling him, for this is the law of
sin, and death for sin, and this is in man and can be no other wife, for the
evil that he does to another man rises up in judgment against him, by the
other whom he bath wronged to retort the like back upon him, for this law of
sin in the man says, an eye for an eye, tooth for tooth, arm for arm, etc.
and so with the froward to be froward, and evil for evil, says the law of
sin in man, which is just to reward every man according to his own evil
works: but thou caust not abide this law of sin, for thou would do a
great deal of mischief and injury to other men, and take pleasure in it, but
that this pleasure brings this sting of death and pain back again to thee,
which thou can not abide, so this thy God or pleasure perishes with the
using, and change thy pleasure into pain by falling back upon thee. But thou will say, that if thou murtherest a man in secret (so that none be private
thereto but thy self) how can that murder be discovered, or the law of sin be
executed upon thee? I answer, that the law of sin is in thy self, and rises up
in judgment against thee in condemning and wounding thy conscience, so that
thou art weary of thy life (and in the and discovers thy self) never being at
quiet till the law of sin be executed upon thee; for we see few murders that
are long concealed: another question may be demanded, if this law of sin
(which seems to be good or God, and is executed upon thee) is not murder and
cruelty likewise: I answer it is, and is thy God and ruler (in thy off-fallen
estate) that is a furious God and a consuming fire, who will consume thee in
his wrath and in his sore displeasure, forthy sins have raised up this
furious God that holds thee in with a rough bit and bridle, whilst thou art a
wild ass colt that striveth to overthrow thy rider, and this cruel God shall
be thy Lord, King and husband, and will torment thee, so long as thou live in
thy sins, and in thy heathenish nature, for thy sins have sold thee into
his hands; as it is said in the Thessalonians, that thou have thrust the holy
God out of his room or Temple, and would not receive the love of the truth,
that is the real good or God, and is true life and joy to the man, who is one
and the same for ever, and is no change to the man, as the delusive God is, for
he seems to be good, or is not the God, nor real good to the man for ever,
as the most holy God is: for if we break the Law or Commandments of this
angry God, he is very cruel and jealous, and will make us drink the cursed
and bitter waters that shall make our belly swell, and our thigh to rot if we
break his Commandment, commit adultery or Idolatry against him, for he it is
that works this evil of punishment in our City, and is that cruel
thundering voice that terrifieth us and makes our hearts to tremble: we would
feign be at quiet with our sins, and delight our selves with our wicked
abominations; but this God does so trouble us, that we cannot enjoy our wicked
selves, he does so torment us, and shall do so still till we are weary of our
selves and sins, and desire to be freed from all, or to seek some way to
please this furious God which we by our sins have raised up; for this law is
added because of the transgressions, and does continue till sin ends in us;
but we are not able of our selves alone to satisfy this severe God that is
the strong delusion and consuming fire (and is not the real God or good to us,
which we shall find in the second world or creation) which now sits in the
Temple of God as God, and has thrust the real holy God out of his room, and
is the just God that roigneth in the man of sin, being froward with the
froward, rendering evil for evil, and is righteous with the righteous; for he
is just in rewarding every one according to his works; and although the man is
so wicked that he cannot abide this judge, yet he shall be with this seeming
God or good for ever, if he do not hate and forsake himself, and send for the
mourning woman, and call and proclaim a fast, and rent his heart and not his
garments, which is an acceptable day to him, and seek for the innocent Lamb to
make satisfaction to this angry God, that he may overcome him with his innocent
life; for when this innocent Lamb is borne in thee, he does strive and wrestle
with this severe God for thee, and does overcome his wrath and evil with his
goodness; and if any do wrong him he does not revenge, but does good for
evil, and so overcommeth this revenging God: he does no wrong to offend this
God, and when he has wrong done him he will not become the evil God, or
judge, to revenge evil, for evil: thus and in this manner does he take away
the linnes of the world and the law or punisher of sin, and in taking away
the cause, the effect ceasoth: but whilst the crucifying the man of sin is a
doing. it makes the humanity in a great agony and bloody sweat in overcomming
the sin and the wrathful judge; and this is that most innocent Lamb which
works all in all in us, and for us, and he is that still and soft voice that
lies in thy inmost self (and in the cave of thy earth) till thou seek, cry
and call for him to save thee; therefore look to it in time, and whilst time
does last. What time is, and concerning man, I shall speak more at large
hereafter in this book. The spirit of man, and the two isntrumental spirits,
is to be seen and felt in the man and by the man, and is discerned by their
several natures, the good instrument is justice with which the just does
justly; and prudence, with which the prudent does use prudence; and fortitude,
with which the strong does valiantly, the good in heart; and temperance, with
which the temperate walks temperately; and faith, with which one believes
that to be true that they do not understand, if they see reason for it; and
hope, with which one hops and confideth in that that is good; and charity,
with which (having proper goods) he makes them common to the good of another
that needs them; and patience, with which the patient overcommeth, and is not
overcome; and piety, with which the pious condoleth the miseries of another
that is in misery: so if thou art guided by these good virtues thou needst not
be afraid of the law ofsin, nor any thing else, for thy conscience justifies
thee that thou do what thou would have done to thee, and if any one is
angry with thee for thy charity that thou uses to another, this evil flies
in his own face and does thee no hurt, for he condemns the good he would
have done to him if he stood in need, and so he is a devil to himself for
condemning the good that thou do, for all evil flies in the faces of them
that use it, so that none is so great an enemy to a man as himself: therefore
thou art happy, o man, whosoever thou art, that is guided by the good spirit,
for he is all good to thee, and the other is all evil: let it seem never so
good to thee, yet thou shall find it so in the end, for his qualities are
these: the first is avarice, with which the rich is poor and a beggar, because
he knows not how to use his riches: and gluttony, with which the glutton is
imprisoned, and is never free to enjoy himself in regard of his slavery to it:
and leachery, with which the man uses the powers of his body unlawfully to his
destruction: and pride, with which the proud man endeavors to be above all
others, which is a lie and deceives him: and sloth or negligence, with which
the idle grieves at the good of another man, and rejoices at their harm: and
envy, with which the envious desires unjustly the goods of another, which
covetousness is Idolatry: and wrath or anger, with which the angry man binds
his own liberty, so that he is not free but is a slave to wrath or passion:
and lying or a lie, with which the liar speaks against the truth, doing great
mischief in the world: and unconstancie, with which the man is manifestly
changeable, so that no good man dare trust him: so thou may plainly see and
discern if thou will (for thy own conscience tells thee) which is the best of
these two, think what thou will to deceive thy self, for none shall suffer
for it but thy self. This good instrument is the ten stringed instrument or
harp of David, on which he praised the Lord, and chased a way the envious
evil spirit of Saul; and thy soul being an eye or light that is composed of
harmony and joy, this instrument (which is the most holy life) is given thee to
sound sweet harmony to thy harmonious soul; for if thou sound on the evil
instrument of ten strings, which instrument is that which was founded in Daniel
before the Image, and made him be cast into the Lions den, it raised up the
most horrible sound of thunder, lightning, and violent fire; so that if thy
brutiall passions touch the mount where this sound comes forth, he shall be
shot through with a dart, for thy touching of this evil ten stringed
instrument, has raised up the most furious God that is a consuming fire, who
turns thy joys into sorrow and pain, so that thy life is now a living death,
and a dying life, which thou shall find by woeful experience; for thou
think thou know not what of thy self, that thou art something, and that
thou came from nothing, then by consequence thou art nothing, and to nothing
must return; so that thou art like a mad man that can give no reason of thy
self from whence thou came, and whither thou go, and so do what thou
list and what seems best in thy own eyes, although it be never so much hurt
to another man. O do not thou think that he that is the cause of thy
appearance will take account of thy life, and of thy stewardship, and what thou
have done here, whether good or bad, thy own conscience tells thee he will,
therefore do not deceive thy self with thy fallacies and deceits? Thou art
that one spirit that is or may be acted in all, and thy spirit or eye is the
great Abyss of eternity, and thy eye does or may look in or through all eyes
or worlds, whether good or evil, and if thou be joined or look through the
evil eye, and art guided by that evil instrument, thou art most unhappy, and
all that evil that is said before falls upon thee, and thou shall or may
for ever be with that evil eye or world, unless thou desire with all thy
heart, soul and mind, to be changed and delivered out of this evil and
wicked world; for it is thy will that has damned thee by the evil instrument,
and thy will saves thee by the good instrument, for thou art passive, and
may be carried by thy will to give thy self to what thou please, to be
carried or ruled by the good or by the evil, and thou can not be joined to
both at once; therefore thou must be dead to the evil, and the evil to thee,
before thou can be joined to the good to be moved thereby. Now when thou art
acted by the evil instrument, thou call evil good, and good evil; so that
when thou think it good, and take pleasure in doing wrong or mischief to
another, thou take pleasure in a lie, and think that evil to be good,
because thou art not sensible, nor feel the truth of the thing acted, but
the fallacy, lie and deceit which deceives all mankind; therefore all things
are not to man as he imagines, for many imagine themselves to be better then
other men, as Kings, Lords, and all others who think themselves great, taking
pleasure in the same, although indeed and truth there is no such matter, for
all men are alike and made of one mould; so that it may evidently appear that
they who does think so, take pleasure in a lie, and this seems to them to be
good: this lie transformeth himself into an Angel of light to be like the
real God or good, when indeed and truth, it is but a delusion, and a joy or
pleasure which perishes with the using; for the real God or good is one and
the same for ever, and no man or thing can take away that joy, for it
continues still the same, being no change; but thou take pleasure in that
which is nothing to thee, and grievest at that which is nothing to thee, so thy
grief and joy is lies; for when thou think that to be to thee which is not
real indeed and in truth, thou deceivest thy own soul, and none shall suffer
for it but thy own self: when thou a busest any man the action falls upon
him and he it is that feels it, and if the like action falls upon thee thou
feel it in the same manner; for all actions of one kind falls alike to
all that are passive or suffers, therefore deceive not thy self for thou that
actest is one and he that suffers is another; and thou that acts is not the
other that suffers; for that which is felt by the one is nothing to the other
that feels not, for the passive and active are two, therefore do not thou
deceive thy self and take pleasure in that which is pain to another, for in
doing so thou joyest, whereas thou would grieve if it did fall upon thy
self; and if harm fall to any man we should participate of his grief as if
it did befall us, and not rejoice at another harm, for this is the delusion
of the Devil to rejoice where is no cause of joy, but is his own imagined joy,
which is a lie, and perishes with the using; and to grieve where is no cause
of grief, is a delusion and lie to torment our selves withal, as some do
torment themselves that they have not so much means and riches as they would
have, and such honor and estimation as they would have, or to be so well or
better thought of then others; and they grieve that they cannot do as much
mischief as they intended to do, and they grieve when any shows mercy or
charity to another whom they hate, although they see that other stand in need
of his charity, and does say that this action of charity is a Devil to that
man that hated him, and God to him that received it, so making an action to be
God or the Devil; can not thou discern the fallacy and the lie here? is
this charity any thing to thee seeing thou did not receive it? if it had been
to thee, and thou had received the same, it had been as good to thee as to
him, for all things fall alike to all as was said before: therefore thou
rejoycest at thou know not what till thou feel the same, and see where
the fallacy lies: wherefore when thou discernest the fallacy, thou may see
that thou ought to be glad when any good comes to another as if it had
come to thy self; for nature tells us, that we should make every man's case our
own: and the Scripture speaks (without exception) saying, Rejoice with them
that rejoice, and receive good, and grieve with them that grieve or receive
hurt or harm; but to grieve at another man's joy or good, is the Devil that
grieveth where no cause of grief is; for in grieving at the other man's joy he
imagines a lie (which is not the truth of that joy in the other man) so
tormenting himself with that which is not, for if that joy of the other were
in thee it could not be grief, but thou deludest thy self when thou make
another grief thy joy, or his joy thy grief, and so thy faith or belief is
that that is not, but is a lie, for joy is not grief, nor grief joy; but thou
do deceive thy self in saying another grief is thy joy, or his joy thy
grief, for another joy or grief can be nothing to thee in reallity, but by
participation, and so it is thy joy or grief, and no otherwise, so that by
participation, we rejoice with them that rejoice, and grieve with them that
grieve, and when we do the contrary (as to grieve at another joy, or joy at
his grief) it is a delusion of the Devil that makes joy seem grief, and
grief seem joy, by his deceitful fallacies; and when thou shall look with a
righteous and just eye, then thou shall see all these fallacies and deceits,
wherein thou have so willingly cose^ed thy self to lose thy own soul: but
thou think thou can not lose it, for thou think thou art something, and
nothing, and it is no matter let every thing run which way it will, all things
will be well at last, but thou art as greatly mistaken in this, as thou art in
the rest, as thou shall find by woeful experience when it falls upon thee, and
it is as true as thou art, and that there is a God, that thou must answer for
all that thou have done whether good or evil, to him that is the cause of thy
appearance, think what thou will to deceive thy self. So thou think also
that all things else is something and nothing, when something is something
still, for there is no such thing as nothing, neither is there any
demonstration or words to express the same, therefore in saying thou know
nothing, it is true so far and in this manner, thou can not possibly know
that that is not, but can know something, and possibly all things if thou
have to do with all or some; for that that thou usest and have to do with all
thou know its qualities, for all things has quallities and quantities, and
are to be known by the same; and as their quallities be, so are they called
and named, for every thing has its several quallity and so a several name,
and thy own eyes sees these several things and their quallities, for thou
see the quallity of fire that it will consume or burn any thing that is put
in it, and some things it will melt, and harden others; so thou see really
what fire is by these quallities, and it is verily so and very true, and is no
other thing then it shows it self to be: and the quallity of water is to
moysten and cleanse, or to quench thirst or fires, and many other things that I
need not express, which is really so as it manifests it self to all the
world, and can be no other thing then as it is manifested: And the aires
quallity is manifested by many several operations, for it makes the fire burn
and set forth his quallity, and it deadneth and takes away the life of many
thing, and reviveth and refreshes many things that walk in it, and many other
operations of life and death it has which I cannot express: And the earth
has diverse setting forth of its quallities, as to make all seeds set forth
themselves in their shapes and forms, making them appear to all the world:
and all these seeds and herbs have their several quallities and setting
forthof themselves, which those who study nature can set forth and show the
real truth of by their effects; for the least herb, tree or metal, or any
other living creature has his several quallities, as the Galenist, Herbalist,
or those who study mineralls find out; and those Doctors and Physicians see
the several quallities of things with the antipathies and simpathies of their
several quallities, and it is really so and they be the very same thing as
they set themselves forth to be, for their nature is really declared by these
their quallities.

Now every man and woman has several quallities, and is proper self. and
their quallities are either antipathies or simpathies one with another, for the
natures of some are so opposite, and there is such antipathy that they cannot
agree nor abide to live one with the other, but in continual opposition; and
there are others whose natures and quallities do sympathize, and those do
agree and live most happily together in sweet society: now every man's nature is
as his complexion is, and is composed of the spiritual elements of earth,
water, air, and fire, which is the intellectual and internal man: I do not
mean the earth, water, air, and fire that is material (and those lower
elements which is a dead matter) but the intellectual, internal and
spiritual elements which are all spirit and life; for some men and women are
compounded most of the spiritual element of fire, and they are more full of
fury and wrath; and another is more compounded of air, and he is more
amorous, sweet and pleasantly disposed, and given more to the act of generation
then any other, for his mind is full of spirits that would appear by him; for
the spirits of men and women do more animate the air all man then any other
to make them appear in this lower elementary world; the reason is, because he
is most flexible, and more easy to be moved by their instigation to bring them
forth: and the flegmaticke man that is more compounded of the spiritual waters
is more dull, and his capacity cannot very soon reach or conceive any thing,
but when he receives he will hardly lose it again, whether good or bad,
therefore it is good for him to have his mind set upon the best object: and the
man that is more compounded of the spiritual earth, he is of the most deep
reaching mind of all, for he has all the elements more powerfully contracted
together in him, and he contains more of them then all the rest, being more
capatious; and if his mind be set upon the evil object the Devil, he is the
most wicked that is upon the earth, and the Devil can work more mischief by
him then by all the rest, for his capatious mind can sooner conceive mischief
(when it is showed him) then all the rest besides, and the Devil by him does
most prodigious and horrid cruelties, although he does enough and too much by
all; for this wicked spirit through and by them all, sets Kingdoms together by
the ears, making one to kill another, persuading them to take pleasure in
doing such mischief, but it is a mad pleasure and wickedness so to do, and
so it will be found in the end, let them think as well as they will of it for
the present: sometimes they set Countries on fire, consuming all their
victuals and corn, and this they take pleasure in, but if rightly considered
it is miserable pain and madness, for they themselves come afterward to
suffer such misery and want for their wastefull spoiling and consuming of
things, that they starve and dye for hunger, and are forced many times to eat
one another, as may be seen and heard of where these practices are. If this be
God or good that acts those things, and tells me that it is pleasure, I will
abandon such a god as the most abominable and hateful thing that is, and
desire to have nothing to do with such and abominable and wicked god that
blindes my eye, and makes me think good to be evil, and evil good; for the
Scripture faith, Woe to him that calls evil good, and good evil, and light
darkness, and darkness light; for we are all ready to mistake, but our
nature and quallities cannot be altered, for we use our quallities and natures
upon what object we light on, whether good or evil: For the choleric man,
whieh is most composed of fire, if he light upon the evil instrument, he has
so many several temptations to wrath and anger, that his soul or himself is
never at quiet for one disturbance or other, and many times in his wrath the
Devil tempts him to kill a man, and he is in continual vexations; so that he
is in a living death and dying life, although he see it not, but loves this
living death more then the everlasting life which has no bitterness therein,
but is full of all sweet content, and all the works that this life or spirit
animates thee to do, breeds thee no sting, discontent or any thing to be
repented off; but this evil instrument animates thee unto horrid and cruel
things full of mischief, which cruelties rises up in thy conscience and
flies in thy face, making thee condemn thy self, saying, what a wicked man
and beastlike wretched creature am I that does such wicked actions, I would not
have such things done to me, why would I do thus to another? sure there shall
some heavy judgment fall upon me, and I shall have the same measure met to me
again, and so still the law of sin flies in the wicked man's face, and is
called the law of God or the wrath of God, that moves man to repent for the
wickedness he has committed, and to condemn and arraigne himself at this
bar of Gods judgment within himself, which shows him all his sins and
wicked life, and so he kills and crucifies himself with these horrible wounds
of conscience in him, and is never at quiet, nor never shall till the cause is
taken out of the way, which cause is the Devil and sin, and there must a
greater power take away this death with another death (that is by the death of
Christ being a death unto Devil and sin) which death is called the death of
Christ in us, that sighteth against our sins and all our lusts and
affections, and crucifieth all our sin and sinful life, so that there is no
more sin, death and devil in us; for it is this death of Christ that destroys
the death for sin, and the cause of sin, which death of sin was done by the law
for sin executed upon sin so taking away the cause and the effect, which
cause was the devil and sin, and the effect was the law of sin; so that when
the cause is taken away, of necessity the effect must cease: and this death or
mortality of Christ, shall raise us up into immortality; so that we may say, O
death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? for the strength of
our sins was the law of sin, which law or wounds of conscience was our grave
wherein we were dead and buried: so this death of Christ has freed us from all
deaths and mortallities, and his death and mortallity will bring us into the
true sweet and everlasting life, which I desire all souls may come into and
enjoy. Now he whose spirit is most composed of spiritual fire (as was said
before) when he was ruled by the evil instrument doing such wrathful and
cruel things, when he is turned to God and goodness, his quallity and nature
of fire is turned into burning zeal, so that he is on fire of love to do all
goodness, and is never well but when he can do some deeds of charity and love
to others; so that his mind is swallowed up in God, and this his nature and
quallity of fire is turned to all God or goodness, for the Divine Nature is
wholly incorporated in him; the which I desire all fiery and choloricke men may
attain unto.

As for the spiritual ayreall or sanguine man, if he sets his nature or
quallity upon the evil instrument, he is very lascivious and given to
leachery, gluttony, and drunkenness, and to all vain pleasure which does
besot the mind, for nothing does besot the mind so much as leachery and
drunkenness, and all these his follies do fly in his face, calling him fool
and sot, and it does so besot them to all good, that it makes them careless of
wife, children, and all other friends, and makes them apt only to devise a
thousand plots and mischiefs to maintain their beastly, brutiall and sensual
life, so that they spend all their own estates and other men's, and in the end
go a begging or live upon others, and they defile and spoil their own bodies
with the pox and other diseases, so spoiling both body and mind with their
sensual living, for they are in an extasio below themselves, and ravished with
a brutiall and sensual life; and this their evil instrument (the Devil or
unreasonablenesse) has brought them to: and when they have lost their
organicall man, then comes in their greater grief or hell, because they
cannot execute their beastly and sensual life; so they are tormented in that
they cannot do as they formerly did when they had a body here, for their minoe
is upon nothing else but on their beastly, brutiall and sensual life, which
perishes with the using, leaving them in great discontents; and the Devil
sets always this joy and pleasure before their eyes, and the want of their
bodies to execute their former fooleries, which want torments them to the
death, so that they are in a living death, and dying life, and the law of sin
still rising out of their conscience condemns them for what they have done,
and for what they desire, and so they are with death and hell, except they
could return: but the Scripture speaks of time, and of a day, and whilst
time does last; and he says, there is an appointed time, and after that time
there is no time more, for in that time the death of Christ should have taken
away death and the cause of death, which is the Devil and sin, who has
brought them into this miserable condition under the law of sin and
condemnation which is the second death: for he says, in dying thou shall dye
the death; so then all men of all quallities and complexions shall be in this
condition for ever, except they be amended by the death of Christ, for he is
that innocent Lamb which takes away the sins of the world, and so makes
amends for all.

Now when this ayreall or sanguine man returns, and is moved by the good
instrument which is God, and does wholly follow him, then does God ravish his
mind with his sweet contents and ravishing joys, so that his soul is taken
off from all things below, and is never at quiet but in this sweet
contemplation: for he sings in mind, rejoicing in the spirit, so that his
soul is wrapped up in God and goodness, and he shows forth to all the world
all love and goodness, so that happy is that man that can enjoy his company: I
do earnestly wish that all ayreall or languine men or women, may set their
mind upon the holy God that they may enjoy this good, for their mind in this
estate, is carried up in such raptures in the holy God, that they live here
below in this world as if they lived not.

As for the phlegmatic or spiritual watery man, which has a dull and gross
capacity if he suffer his mind to be moved by the evil instrument, he is so
strongly set on him that he will very difficultly leave him; and he makes him
live so lazily that he is good for nothing, and sets his mind on all
lasciviousness, on evil surmisings and suspicions, constrning all things in
the worst sense, so that he is never at quiet for one suspicion or another,
being in continual mistrust of every one, because his capacity is shallow, and
the Devil has blinded his eyes with these fallacies, so that he thinks
every one to be his enemy; and he does a great deal of mischief in these his
evil suspicions thinking to begin with others first, and in his blindness of
mind does undo himself and others, and then rises up the law of sin in
his mind tormenting him, accusing him of what mischief he has done to others
without any other cause, save only his own wrong apprehensions, and so this
law of sin condemns and wounds him to the death, till the death of Christ
takes away this death, and the cause of this death, which is the devilish
delusions, and the evil surmisings which makes him do all this mischief to
others without a cause: And if this spiritual watery or phlegmatic man forsake
the evil instrument with all his soul and mind, and return to the holy God,
or good instrument with his whole strength and mind to be joined to and ruled
thereby, then all his thoughts are set upon goodness, and then does he
construct all things in the best sense which is done to him, and he sees all
things that fall cross in this world, to be good for him, to wean and draw his
love from earthly things which perish with the using, and his mind is wholly
swallowed up in God and goodness, and all his thoughts and contemplations are
upon God, and he she weth forth nothing in all his life but God and goodness
to the whole world, and to the sons of men, for his life is swallowed up in
the most holy Godhead; if all the phlegmatic men and women were come to this
estate, then were they happy, but till then most unhappy.

And for the spiritual earthly or melancholy man, if he join himself to
the evil instrument the Devil to be ruled thereby, he is wisest of all in
doing mischief, for he hatha vast capacity and can receive all suggestions,
and (as was said formerly) by him is acted the greatest cruelties, and
therefore he has the greater wounds of conscience; for the law of sin
raises up all his cruel deeds against him, so that his soul is heavily vexed
unto the death, and he has such fear and dread in him, that he wishes that
he had never been, for he has such fearful and melancholy thoughts that every
hour he fears to be torn in pieces, and this is in him till the death of
Christ takes away the cause, and then this wounding law of sin will cease: but
many love their sins too well to part with them, to let Christ take them away,
and so they live and dye with them, so that the Devil and they are together
for ever and for ever in his world which is without end; for the beginning of
his world is the ending with the man, for the beginning and ending is with the
man one and the same for ever; for as he was at first to him, so he is the
last and the same for ever, for he changes not but continues still evil:
therefore, O man, look to it in time, and whilst time does last, for after one
time there is no time more, and look to it before the decree (where of the
Prophet speaks) come forth, for after that decree is past, there is no hope;
therefore look to it whilst it is called to day, and whilst this day does last
in thee, which day is Jesus Christ that comes to help and save thee; but if
thou do not regard this day or Jesus Christ, then the decree comes forth to
thee, which is the eternal black night of death and darkness, which darkness
or night, is the depriving thee of Gods grace and comfort, for thou regardest
it not when it was offered to thee, and so in despising it thou shall be for
ever without it, think as much as thou will to the contrary; for as sure as
there is a God, and as thou live, this will come to pass upon thee if thou
do not look to it before all these things come to pass in thee: so if this
melancholy and earthly man forsake the Devil and evil one, and turn to God
and goodness, to be joined to and guided by him, he conceives more of the
secret mysteries of God then all the rest, for he finds out all the deepest
mysteries, and all things are opened unto him; for as he has suffered more, so
more is revealed to him, and so God and he are joined for ever in all love, and
he is in everlasting joy and comfort in God for ever and for ever. I wish that
all spiritual earthly and melancholy men and women may be joined to this
everlasting joy and comfort.

Where as I have spoken of the delusive God in this Chapter, I desire I may not
be mistaken, for the Scripture speaks of two Gods, the most holy God, and the
wicked God of this world that blinds the eyes of mankind; one is the real
good, and the other is the real evil. And the Scripture makes mention of two
Satan's, Devils or evils; and of two guiles or two delusions; the one Satan,
guile, evil or delusion, is for the good of the man; and the other Satan,
guile or delusion is for his utter destruction; for the incestuous person was
delivered to the good Satan or evil, for the destruction of his sin full
flesh, that his spirit or soul might be saved in the day of the Lord; and St.
Paul took his disciples with a good guile, and made them grieve and mourn,
deceiving them by that godly sorrow for their good. And in the Thessa. it is
said, that God did send them strong delusions that they should believe a lie,
because they would not receive the love of the truth. Now all the delusions
that God sends to the man is for his good, and the delusion is, that he works
such a belief and persuasion in the man's heart for the sins cause, that he
seems to the man to be nothing else to him but wrath, fury, and destruction;
and thus he terrifieth man to make him forsake sin for his good, and to make
him return from his evil life: for whatsoever God does too or for the man, it
is for his real good, whatsoever the man thinks to the contrary; and it is
just so, as if a father should correct his child for his good and future
profit, although for the present it seem contrary to him; even so is man
deluded by Gods fatherly discipline and law, till sin cease in him, and then
this rod, discipline or delusion (which kept him in a we or fear to offend God)
shall be taken away; that is to say, when sin wholly cease in him, and when
he cease to offend God his Father any more: and this is the evil which is
spoken of by the Prophet saying, Is there any evil in the city, and I the Lord
have not done it? that is the evil of punishment. And that lying spirit spoken
of in the Kings (that the Lord did send to be a deluder in the mouth of the
false Prophess) was sent for a punishment to them, because they would not
believe the truth; and this is done to reclaim the man, and to let him see his
errors, and that he may return home again to the real truth: And again it
is said, he created the destroyer to destroy, and has sent forth the evil
Angels with flaming fire, rendering vengeance to those that will not know God.
And it is said in the Psalms by Davld, and in Job, That the arrows of the
Almighty stuck fast in him, all which evils, wraths, furies, or delusions, is
the law of sin which was added because of the man's transgression, and they
shall continue with him (as I have formerly said) till sin cease in him: but
God in himself is none of all these, for he is a most pure and holy Spirit,
and is subject to no passions, but is a real essence full of goodness,
neither is there any thing can change or disturb him: but the evil one
transformeth himself into an Angel of light, to delude and deceive the man
with his seeming goodness for his hurt, loss and damnation: So the most holy
God, by his ministering spirits assumes an Angel of darkness, or takes upon
him the body of sin to destroy sin; and in the Scripture the Divinity is
sometimes said to be Satan in the destroying of sin, being evil, with the
evil, and he is said to be Lucifer the son of the morning, or that morning
star that is fallen in our hearts, for he could fall no where else, and it
must be he that is that day or morning star that shall arise in our hearts
again: so we must look into the Scripture with a righteous eye, and consider
it rightly in its order and place, how all things hang and depend one upon
another, or else we shall lose our selves, and confound the Scriptures, or
forsake and neglost them as many do, because they see many seeming
contradictions not having the spirit of unity to reconcile or unite them
together; for it speaks sometimes, and in some cases that man is passive, and
God active, and that God is passive in some case, and man the active; and in
some case it is said that the Divinity suffers for sin and does all in all,
and sometimes it is understood that the humanity suffers for sin; therefore
if we have not the spirit of the most holy Godhead, we cannot find out the
intricacies and secret mysteries of the spirit and mind of the holy written
word, and how all things stand in their orders and places: for some things
seem strange, as that God which is all goodness should destroy so many for
David's numbering the peoples and in one place of the Scripture it is said, that
God moved him to number the people, and in another place it is said, that
Satan moved him to number them; and in the fifteenth of Jeremy it is said,
that he would destroy so many with several deaths for the sins of Manasses:
so that the Prophet Jer. was troubled and said, that the Lord seemed to him to
be a liar, because he thought these things seemed strange to him to come forth
of goodness; but all these things are secret mysteries bidden from all sinful
flesh and blood, and none shall see them aright but those which have ceased
from sin; for God and man have been for ever together, and they both have
appeared in time to each other, and in this time there has been a partition
wall let in by the man which has parted their union of love, so that the man
seems to fight against God and goodness, and God fights against man and
his evilnesse, and nothing can be discerned rightly by the man till the
partition wall of sin be pulled down; so in the end of time that holy Jesus
the Son of God pulls down all partition walls that have made the divisions
betwixt God and man, and he uniteth them again in all lovely unity.

CHAP. III. A description of the Scripture according to the history and mystery
thereof.
MOSES has spoken of the Creation of the World, and certainly it cannot be
that he means this external world; for I could never hear any true reasons
that can be given to prove the same, for it stands at one stay, and the Sun,
Moon, and Stars keep one course; and the Sea runs her race up and down, and
they still are one and the same in their orders and places; neither do they
increase or decrease to or from what they first seemed to be unto man, nor do
they wax old as a garment, nor as the creatures which we see appear that have
a beginning and ending; for we see every spirit that appears here has a
created body which increases and is diminished, and is gone again and is
seen no more: but this external world is one and the same for ever, for any
thing I could see or hear to the contrary.

The greatest multitude of men believe it to be created of nothing, but I
cannot see nor hear any reason for the same, because that of nothing can come
nothing; then what must it be made off? for sure it cannot be made of the most
holy God as some do imagine and say, that there was nothing before but God, and
therefore of necessity (if it be as they allege) he must make all things of
himself, but it cannot stand with reason that out of one should come so many
antipathies; therefore without all question the most holy Godhead that is one
is of a more pure and excellent nature then these lower changeable elements of
earth, water, air, and fire, of which this lower world is composed off; for
this lower world brings forth nothing but his own nature, as earth, water,
air and its spirit of fire, from which all spirits have borrowed a body which
they cannot keep for ever, because its nature is changeable and runs or
whirling round, never standing at one certain stay; for the Sun (which is
soul, fire or life of this world) never stands still but every year runs
his race round, and in his running he melts, hardens, congeales, withers, and
makes grow green, so that there is a continual death and resurrection every
year of things under the Sun; for nothing stands at one stay but is in
continual motion and change, and in this change is, was, and shall be one and
the same for ever; for no man can consume, diminish, or annihilate the least
atom or dust, or bring any thing that is to nothing, neither can any man find
the beginning or end of things; but thou have borrowed a garment or body which
did lie potentially in that matter, and when thou make it appear, it is said
to be a beginning to thee, and when thou leavest it as it was, it is called an
ending to thee: As for the world whereof Moses speaks (that the most holy God
made) certain it is some more excellent, better, or purer world for man to
live in then this: for he has no true content here in this world or body of
clay; for this world is the visible God or good that is in continual change,
but in the invisible world or invisible God is no change nor shadow of turning,
but is one and the same for ever: if thou borrow a body or garment of this
internal and invisible world, he never looks for it again, for he is the
righteous that lends never looking for it again. O that all souls did keep
this body or garment that was given them out of this internal world, that they
might see with those eyes the Sun, Moon, and all the glorious orders of
Stars, which glorious world is for thee, O man, therefore look for thy
internal garment that is given thee for ever; for the eyes or lights of this
body shall never wax dimne, but in those lights or eyes we shall see and behold
the eternal eye or light from whence those our eyes or lights came, which
shall be our everlasting body that we need not fear losing or changing, for
it continues one and the same for ever, being the free gift of the internal
God.

There is a time wherein it seems to us that we had a beginning to this
internal and invisible body, although indeed and in truth this body has
neither beginning nor ending, because it lay potentially hid in God and in his
essence, for its beginning to us is its ending, because the beginning reaches
unto eternity, and we shall for ever have this body if we do not lose and
disregard it, as I fear we all have done; for we have not remembered our
Creator in these days of our youth, before our evil days came, wherein we
have had no pleasure; for our evil days is this, when we disregrad this holy
body, and then those eyes begin to wax dim in us, though in themselves they are
one and the same for ever; and those grinders cease from eating the internal
life, the food of our souls, and the mourners shall carry this dead body about
the streets and walks of our hearts, mourning and grieving for us and for our
great loss, and this is the grieving of the holy Spirit by whom we are sealed
and made sons of God; for we have quenched, crucified, and killed this holy
body of the Lord which he gave us for a garment for ever to cover our
nakedness, and so he returns to that holy divine earth from whence he came,
and the soul, spirit, or life of that body, returns to him that gave it. And
now, O man, what shall we do for our great loss? for we see nothing but death
on every side, for this external world is but a living death to us, for we
are in continual expectation to be called out of it; and besides there is one
that is worse then death that follows us to cloth us with his mortal
garments or body of wickedness: for he prepares a body which is a lie or
delusion, and shows us a body which is a lie or vanity to cloth us with, so
that this body is worse then death, for it is a living death, and dying life,
and we were better to be dead and (and if possible to be annihilated quite)
then to live in such a wicked body of sin and death: and it had been better
we had never been borne or brought forth in it, as Job says, cursing the
hour of his birth, and the day wherein he was borne, and wishes that he had
dyed in the birth, and that he had never been seen in this wicked world;
therefore we see many worlds, yet cannot see what reason man has to believe
that this external world was ever made as he imagines, seeing there will
follow so many absurdities on it; for what reason can be given that there was
but one man and one woman at first, seeing there is blackmores or men, and
white, and it is contrary to nature and impossible for a man naturally black or
blackmore to bring forth a white, or a white to bring forth a black, and we
see it so by experience? and when Cain killed Abel, the Lord being angry with
him, said, that he should be a vagabond and runnagate; Cain answered, that his
punishment was greater then he could bear, and if any man should meet him he
should kill him, when there was none to kill him; for if there was but one man
and woman created at first, there was but his father and he in the world; and
afterward it is said that he went into the land of Nod, and took him a wife,
who did inhabit that land, and what man was the father of his wife? how can all
these things be made good by the letter of the Scripture? or do you think
that there was a material garden, or a tree whereon did grow the fruit of good
and evil, or that a Serpent did go up in the same to speak to the woman?
sure it cannot stand with reason that it could be so, for it is said that all
the creatures did come to Adam, and he gave them names according to their
natures: now it is contrary to the Serpents nature to speak after the manner
of men, unless you will allege that she understood the language of the
beasts, and thought them wiser then God, and resolved to be ruled by them,
which to me seems altogether against reason, that the woman should be so
ignorant and irrational, who was created rational after the image of God to
be ruler of all creatures: for at this day if a Serpent went up into a tree,
and did speak from thence to men and women, it would make them afraid in so
much that they would not do what he bid them: or do thou think that in
Mesopotamia (a great way off beyond the seas) that there is a material garden
wherein stands the tree of life, and the tree of knowledge of good and ill,
both in one place, and an Angel standing with a slickering sword to keep the
tree of life from the man; and that Adam and Hevah were cast out of this garden
(for harkening to the Serpent) to till the earth, and that it should bring
forth nothing but thorns and thistles, all which in my judgment cannot stand
with reason or truth? for the Scripture says, that none shall be saved but
those who shall eat of the tree that is in the paradise of God: why then do
not all souls or men go to look for this paradise and garden of Eden to eat
of this tree of life whereby they must be saved, for none can be saved without
it? And why do not all men and women go to fight with this Angel that
holds this sword which keeps them from the tree of life, and consequently
from salvation? I see none, nor heard I ever any that went to seek out this
garden, Angel, nor tree of life: and so if the Scripture be to be understood
according to the litterall sense, or this a material garden, none can be saved
because the same has never been found out by any since the fall of Adam: and
that earth which is said to bring forth nothing but thorns and thistles,
cannot be the external earth, for we see it brings forth very good herbs,
fruit and corn, fit for the use of the external manhood, and but few thorns
and thistles.

Therefore, O man, look not thou on the history of the Scripture, but upon the
mystery which is hidden since thy wicked world began, for these are all holy
and sacred mysteries which are hid from all fleshly and sinful hearts, whose
foreskin of sin is before them as a partition wall: therefore, O man, let thy
partition wall be pulled down by the mighty power of God in thee, and let the
foreskin of thy sinful flesh be cut off, and be thou plunged, dipped, dyed,
or baptized in the most holy and divine nature, or in the most holy Godhead;
for if thou go into this river of Jordan or judgment as red as blood with
thy sins, thou shall come forth as white as snow, and then thou shall see all
these secret and holy mysteries which are revealed to perfect and just men, and
to no other; for to the wicked and sinful men, it is a closed book, and a
dead letter, for S. Paul says in the second chap. of the second to the
Corinths, that he speaks the wisdom of God to them that are perfect, for
none can understand it but such as are perfect and without sin, for to the
wise of this world the wisdom is foolishnes, and they laugh it to scorn, and
think it mere madness, as Felix did of Paul, saying, That too much learning
had made him mad. O that all souls, had this foolishness and madness, it
would be more precious to them then all the wisdoms and riches of this world,
for the wisdom of this world is earthly, sensual, and divillish, all which
perish with the using; and the foolishness and madness of God (as men esteem)
is to us our right and perfect mind. O that all men were baptized into the
Father Son, and Holy Ghost, then should they see things clearly and never have
more trouble in soul, then should they know all good things, and all tears
should be wiped from their eyes, and be in everlasting ravishing joys and
sweet content of mind.

As for the seven Nations (that the Scripture makes mention of) which should
be destroyed when their sins were full, as the Amorites, Jebusites, Hittites,
etc. it cannot be meant the destruction and killing of men, because it is
contrary to the nature of God and goodness to be the cause of destruction, for
he is the author and cause of all goodness and preservation; therefore we
should be like God, to pray for them, and do them all the good we can, and not
destroy and kill them in their sins, for we should deal with them by the
spirit of meekness, and not send them to hell headlong, for we know not how
soon they may return to God and goodness: wherefore those seven are the seven
deadly sins which have set themselves forth as Nations in us, which when they
are at the full in us, the Israel of God (Jesus Christ) must come and destroy
them out of us that the whole society of God with Saints and Angels may dwell
in us, and that our soul may be a land that flows with milk and honey, and
till all those good things come to pass in us we are not saved.

And whereas it is said of Abraham's being commanded to kill his son Isaac
(which is contrary to the law of nature and to God and goodness to command him
to kill his natural son) there is some secret and sacred mystery in it, for in
this is set forth the whole passion of Christ; or Isaac (or Jesus Christ) is
the promised seed which is brought forth in the Ancient of days, or in the end
of time, and is the sole and only joy of the man; and God to try the man would
have this sole joy and life of the man to be brought to the sacrifice, but the
Divinity or holy life cannot dye (but as it may seem to the man) but the ram
or humanity which was caught in the bush of sin, he must dye and be sacrificed
for sin, for all sacrifices are for sin, and the soul that sins he must
dye: wherefore we should not look on the Scripture as a history, but as a holy
and secret mystery: for in Gal. 4.24. it is said, that by Hagar and Sarah is
signified the two Testaments, and that their children are two seeds, the one
fleshly, and the other spiritual; and Jacob and Esau that wrestled in the womb
are said to be two Nations, the one spiritual, the other carnal: and the
Scripture testifies them to be two worlds, which is meant the first and
second birth in man, and not as most imagine, that God ordained the one to
damnation, and the other to salvation; and the Scripture witnesses plainly
that those are allegories, and to be understood as mysteries, or else we shall
altogether disorder and confound the Scripture, and this is the reason of so
many Religions one fighting against the other: for the Scripture in the letter
seems to contradict it self, so that if we have not the Spirit of God (which
is above the Scripture) we cannot understand one word or tittle thereof
aright, and none can have that Spirit, but he that has ceased from sin.

As for the drowning of the world and building of Noah's Arc so many cubits
high and broad, as the Scripture speaks, it could not contain all the
creatures in the world by couples and sevens, and all their meats so long time,
also it might be thought that God did inspire and move all the creatures to
come to Noah's Ark to be saved, the which I desire you to consider of, and the
many absurdities that would fall upon it to be understood according to the
letter, which cannot be agreeable to reason, but that there must be some higher
mystery in it; for the Scripture says, that there was but eight persons in the
Ark, and that all the world was drowned save these eight; and presently after
he speaks of Kings and Kingdoms: I pray tell me, from whence these Kings
and Kingdoms came from in so short a time? for we read how many of the
children of Israel went into Egypt, and were there four hundred years; mark
their increase during that space, and compare the times, and you shall see how
many eight persons could bring forth in so short a time; for the Egyptian
Kingdom, and all the rest of the Kingdoms must come from those eight persons,
which they can never prove to have increased so many in so short a time; for we
read but of sixty six persons that came of Shem, betwixt his coming forth of
the Arc, and their entering into Egypt, and their abode in Egypt was four
hundred and thirty years, the which in all that time did but increase to six
hundred thousand till the time they came out of Egypt again to go into the land
of Canaan: therefore if you will compare those things and exactly calculate the
times, you will find strange contradictions in them; wherefore you must not
look to the history of the Scripture but to the mystery, for the deluge of Gods
wrath must needs fall upon some other world then this external, even the world
of sin and iniquity, and drowns all their delightful pleasures and marriages
by his heavy judgment and law of sin that he executes upon them many and
diverse ways: but the holy and divine manhood with all the beasts (which are
the passions and fantasies of his mind) and the eight persons (which are the
five senses, with the will, reason and understanding, which is to rule and
govern all these beasts) are shut up in the Arc, Chest or Divinity of God
while this deluge runs over the wicked world, and are preserved in the same to
be brought forth as a new and heavenly Jerusalem to a better and more divine
world, which is the humanity to live in the Godhead, or the holy divine life.
Likewise the history of Joseph and his brethren, is to be understood
spiritually, for the twelve sons of Jacob, with their father and mother, is
the whole divinity and humanity joined together, and Joseph signifies the
highest perfection or divinity, which was sold into the hands of the wicked by
his brethren which is the humanity with his affections, and the wickedness
sold him unto the lust of the flesh, which was Potiphars wife, so that the
lusts of the flesh desired to enjoy the perfection to her lust, will and
desires, as the Devil did to Christ, which this does presigurate, and he left
this garment of flesh (which he seemed to be clothed with) into her hands for
a witness against him that he was with her: so the wicked lusts of the flesh
put this perfection or Joseph in prison, because he would not consent to her,
and helyeth in this dungeon or hell under the fleshly lusts of sin, till our
Pharaoh (King of ignorance and servitude) begin to dream of all the miseries
and famines that is to come upon us; then Joseph or our perfection is sent for
in haste, to provide food for us in this our famished land of servitude and
ignorance, where we must sell our selves under this perfection (who is as King
and Lord in this land for a time) otherwise we cannot be saved nor preserved;
and after a small time this Joseph dies in the land of servitude and
ignorance, after whose death comes a cruel Pharaoh to reign over thee, who
does impose such cruel and hard burdens and taskes on thee, which makes thee
long and cry out for a Savior; then comes the most powerful God with his
mighty signs and wonders to help thee, plaguing thy wicked king of
wickedness in thee; and when all those wonders and plagues are fulfilled upon
thy king of servitude, thou must enter into a wildernessed land where is no
comfort, carrying the dead bones of Joseph (or thy dead perfection) and in thy
going thou must eat the pascall lamb, or the supper of our Lord; which
wildernessed land, is the whole passion and death of our Lord Jesus, whereby
thou must forsake the onions, garlike, flesh pots, and all the pleasant meats
which thou catest of in the land of Egypt: and in walking through this
wilderness (or this death and passion of our Lord Jesus) we are brought to the
heavenly Jerusalem, or City of God, wherein we shall rest in all peace and
sweet content: I do not deny the history or litterall sense of the Scripture,
but there is nothing therein profitable for me, save only the mystery and
spiritual sense. As for the sacrifice in the old law, where mention is made of
killing of bulls, rams, goats and lambs, sure it cannot be that the killing of
these creatures could ever make satisfaction for sin; nor could the speech of
a Priest speaking over the head of a goat, carry away sin into the
wilderness, as it is said of the seape goat; but these are holy mysteries, and
must be understood otherwise, and the choosing of the Priests as that they
should have no impediment, as a lame leg, or one arm, or but one eye, and that
their attire should be most glorious, with the breastplate of Urim and
Thummim, and the Crown with writing upon it, and the pure white linen, which
to understand according to the history seems strange for the Priests to wear
such babbling things, but that all those are mysteries.

As for the sacrifices which should be without blemish (as the lambs and
innocent doves, with the sweet odours and perfumes) is this to offer up a most
holy and upright life without spot or blemish of sin, which is his holy Son
Jesus in us, a sacrifice most pleasing in his sight, for he cares not for the
sacrifice of bulls and rams, but this most holy body has he chosen: O
therefore, let us offer up this most holy body and pure life for an acceptable
sacrifies most pleasing in his sight; this holy life is the odours and sweet
perfumes, which sweet savor deligh eth his nostrills, and ravisheth his mind
with most sweet contents; and the divine humanity is the Priest that must offer
up this most pure sacrifice, for he must be a perfect man without the blemish
of sin, and must wear the breastplate of judgment with Urim and Thummim,
which is light and perfection, with the crown of glory which is holiness to
God, and be clothed in white linen which is a most pure and innocent life:
and now you see that Priest, people, and sacrifice must be pure and unspotted
without sin having all perfection.

As for the holy Arc which was builded by the free will offering of the
people, and Moses going up into the mountain to the Lord for a pattern to show
the people that it might be builded with all their precious stones, and fine
silks for curtains, and the drinking pots of gold, with the candlesticks,
snuffers, and snuffing dishes, and the mercy seat, with the Cherubins that
holds up the mercy seat, and the holy and most holy place, with the curtain
betwixt the holy and most holy; and the Altar and hooks, the table and
shewbread, with Arons rod that budded, and the pot of manna, which to
understand as a history, that such a glorious building was made to look upon is
nothing to me; for to look or judge of it so is to look according to the
outward appearance which is not righteous judgment, for in this is to be seen
the whole mystery of the Godhead and the humanity; for in the holy place is the
whole work of the law, with the death and sacrifices for sin for a
reconciliation, which death and sacrifices is the Godhead and manhoed which
lies upon the holy Alter, fire, wrath, cross or patience till the man of
sin be destroyed and rooted out of us: And the golden candlesticks, with the
lights in the holy place, is the law or grace that shines from the morning
till the evening, or till sin is extinguished and done away in us, and is the
lights of Gods grace which is true repentance for sin, with a broken and
contrite heart and sorrowful spirit, which shines till all things are
finished, and then gives up the ghost unto the Father from whence he came, and
then the veil or curtain which stands in the most holy place is rent in
twain from the top to the bottom, which veil is the flesh and death of
Christ, and is the new and living way, through which all must enter or else
they cannot be saved, nor enter into the most holy or Sanctum Sanctorum, where
the mercy seat is held up by the Angels and Cherubins.

Now when the Priesthood which is the holy humanity, has fulfilled the whole
work of the Law (the sacrifice for sin in the holy place) then they put on
all their holy garments and attires, and so enter into the most holy place with
their bells or hymns that sounds forth the praise of God internally to God,
and externally all good to men, for in this holy attire must he enter in the
most holy place with odours and sweet perfumes of a holy life, and the smoke of
these odours, and perfumes of a holy life, ascends to the mercies seat, and
ravisheth the most holy Godhead, and then he imbraceth him in his arms saying,
Thou art my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased; and this is he that makes
us Kings and Priests to God, and gives us himself to be offered up for a
sacrifice to God his Father for us. O man, how great is the love of God to
thee, that he becomes thee to save thee, and makes thee himself for the
great love he has to thee? for in thy first appearance he created himself in
thee, and then there appeared unto thee four worlds; first this external
world, whereof thou have borrowed a body or garment, and know not how foone
it shall be called for again, for the world whitleth about and calls for her
own again, and there can be no certainty of any thing here, because here is
nothing but change and mortality; for this world of it self is death, but that
the spirits that are in it is its life, so that this world is not worthy so
much as to be thought off, for it perishes with the using as does a garment,
only it is good in this respect, because we could not know light but by
darkness, nor life but by death, nor immortallity but by mortallity; and the
reason we were in obscurity or in silence before we could come here, is this,
that there is one eternal increase of the seed of man, and they can but
appear in time here; for this external world is time, and time is a running
round, and there is no new thing here but as it is to me; for this material
world does neither increase nor decrease, but is one and the same for ever in
its turning round, only it seems to me to increase and diminish, and so it is
finite, and because the seed of man is an eternal increase; and this world
being one and the same may be called finite in this respect, because there is
not matter enough for all spirits to have bodies or garments of at one time,
and therefore some must go before others can come, for the spirits to come are
infinite, and this world is finite, because of its material confine, not
increasing but running round, so that which is called the body of one to day,
may be called the body of another to morrow; for there is no certainty here,
and all souls must stay their time till they can come here, and in their
coming and being here is the time to see distinctions and all worlds, and if
thou do not look about thee and see them here in this world of time (but be
neglective of the time) thou had better never have been born or brought forth
in time, for this time vanishes away to thee and thou shall be seen no more;
for when man is in honor and knows it not, he is like the brute beast that
perishes being without God in the world: therefore whilst time does last to
us, let us look about us and redeem our misspent time, and seek the
everlasting good or real true world that is beyond all time or change; and
this is the divine world which God has placed in thy heart, as is said in
Ecclesiastes the 3. and the world whereof Moses speaks Genesis 1. and is the
Angelical world or paradise out of which the man had an Angelical body which
is but a part of Gods house, for God showed himself but in part, and this part
he lost, and in that part he was that great Lucifer or Angel that was the
Sun of the morning, or star that fell, and in falling fought against his
Maker, or him that gave him that Angelical body or world, in which the most
holy world stood as a tree of life unseen or untouched by the man, for he had
more mind of the diabolical world, for all worlds being opened to the man he
desires the evil and worst of worlds desiring to be free before his time,
because he could not abide the servanthood to till and dress the garden of the
Lord (which servanthood is the angelical body or world, which is the servant
of the Lord) but desired to be as great as God himself before his time, and so
his pride threw him down into the most lowest world which is the diabolical;
so that his body is now the body of sin, death, and all wickedness: and
besides, he has pulled down the divine and most holy world upon him as a
judge with wrath and violent fire, and so he stands still over him till the
man desire to come forth again out of the diabolical world and return with
humility, true repentance and real sorrow for his sin, and then the divine and
most holy world does work this true real death in man's heart, and descends
into the hell of his heart (that is into the lowest parts of his earth where
the wrath of God is) and there pacifieth this wrathful Judge or God with his
humility and true sorrow for sin, by which sorrow and humility he crucifies
and destroys all sin out of the man, and then he raises him out of the
lowest world into the divinest and most holy world; and this world is the
second creation that God makes in man and is himself which he creates in
him, for in his coming he first humbles and then exalts the man; for the
divine and most holy world in his coming down into hell (or the most lowest
world to the man to save him) does appear in humility and lowliness of
spirit, very meek and gentle, enduring patiently all that the law would have
him suffer, and so teaches and incorporateth this humility and lowliness of
spirit into the man that has learned God, so that they twain are made one
spirit; and this is the new creation of which David speaks, saying, Create in
me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit in me: this is that poor,
humble, meek soul that lies in the dust and sees no help which shall be
^^ised up from thence to dignity, and shall sit with Princes, which is to sit
with the most highest God; and he is the barren that shall bear, and bring
forth the holy Godhead or divine life out of him.

Now, O man, may thou see how great the love of God is to thee; therefore
forsake all worlds for his sake, because he loves thee so deerly, and look
upon all things through his spiritual and holy eyes, and then shall thou see
things clearly and as they are, and not esteem of any thing above it self, nor
above its own deserving. Wherefore we must look into the Scripture with
those holy eyes, or else we shall see nothing aright, or as it is.

Now to look upon all the histories of the Prophets, Judges and Kings without
those divine and holy eyes, where through we see the holy mystery of the same,
it will appear very strange to us, and contrary to nature and reason; as for
example, that of Bilaams Ass speaking to him, and Nebuchadnezzar being turned
to a Beast to eat grass with the Oxen till the dew of heaven had wet him seven
times; and the fiery furnace spoken of in Daniell, in which the three children
were cast, wherein they had no hurt, nor so much as their clothes burned; and
the great Image of brass, iron and clay, which is also spoken of in Daniell,
with many other mysteries which sets forth the creation, fall and
restoration of man by the whole work of the law, together with his new
creation: so that the whole history of the Scripture (rightly understood)
tends to those things, but are illustrated and set forth many and diverse
ways; therefore this work of man is wonderful, and would make an eternal
discourse in the mind of man to express himself. And the history of David
that he did kill a Lion and a Bear, and did kill Goliath, is the whole work of
the law to destroy the Devil and sin out of the man; also he complains
sometimes that he is in the lowest hell, and in a deep pit, and that he is a
worm and no man, and that he is in the deep waters and the raging seas run
over him, so that in all this he carries a double death which is to kill and be
killed, for the whole work of the law is to kill and be killed; therefore the
law (or David) cannot build a house for God to dwell in, for he says that
David or the law is a man of blood, and that he should pull down all buildings
of sin, and destroy the enemies of the Lord, and prepare timber and stones
hewed and cut for the house of the Lord, that there might be no noise of the
hammer, or of the work man's tools; for the law of the Lord hews, cuts and
prepares us for the house of the Lord before we are or can be set in, that
there should be no noise of hammer or work man's tools hewing or cutting,
which hewing or cutting is the wounds of conscience making a true sorrow and
mourning for sin, and when we are prepared and made living stones and a
spiritual house (Christ being the head and corner stone that upholdeth this
house and holy building, and this whole house is covered within and without
with pure gold, that is with a most pure, holy and glorious life) then the most
holy and wise Solomon (the wisdom of the Godhead, the son of David, or the
law) enters in this most glorious house that shines with his most bright and
glorious rays, and there he worships and adores this great and most holy
Godhead, and there was and is continual songs of Hallelujah, praise and
thanksgiving to him that lives for evermore: and without this house is the
middle court where the peace offerings that was and is offered up to this most
holy God, and was and is the fulfilling of the law by obedience in killing the
man of sin, the which does pacify and reconcile us to God again, that we
may enter the Temple with this holy and wise Solomon to worship and sing
praises to the most glorious and most holy God. O that it were so well with all
the souls of men, and that it were so come to pass in them, then were they
happy, but till then most unhappy.

Now to understand these buildings of the Temple and house of the Lord as a
history, with all these glorious external things, how that there were
galleries and chambers, and in those rooms pictures of Angels and Cherubins,
and that they did uphold the Arc and Alter, and that the same should be
covered within and without with pure gold, and that the stones must be hewed
and prepared before they were set in that there should be no noise of the
hammer or workmans tool: what is that to thee, O man, to read the history of
these things? for all external buildings must perish with the using, and thou
never the better for it; but look thou into the mystery thereof because it
concerns thy self, for this building is thee and God joined together, and is
the rock Christ Jesus, that living stone disallowed of men, but chosen of God,
and ye as living stones are joined to him and made a spiritual house, and an
holy Priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices to God by this holy Jesus
Christ our Lord and only Savior, that has called us from death to life, and
has made us sit with him in his holy place, that is in the most holy Father:
therefore O man, seek after this holy building, and let it be built in thee,
for all the hystories of the Scripture is concerning thy self, thy falling,
rising, or something that concerns thee or the holy Godhead; therefore thou
ought to look into the scripture with a vigilant eye, and with due respect,
for it is the true looking glass which shows thee in what condition thou art,
and therefore read it not as thou do other hystories, but read it and take it
to heart, and esteem it as it is the most holy and sacred mysteries concerning
the great and most powerful Godhead and thy self, O man.

And as for the Hystory of Jesus Christ that he was borne in an Inn, and in a
stable, betwixt an Ox and an Ass, and laid in a Crach, and that the Inn was
full and no room in it but the stable, is a great mystery, for this Inn is thy
self O man, and the chambers of thy heart is full of thy sins, the great
Kings of thy earthly being, which is pride, vain glory, hypocrisy, lust,
vanity wrath and self will: so that the chambers and rooms of thy heart are
full of such guests as these, and there was nor is no room for the most holy
life but in the worst place of thy house, and thy Herod (or bloody mind) will
not let him ly there, but seeks to destroy and kill him, and so he is
carried away and hid in thee till those be dead that seek his life: Now when
Christ (the holy divine nature) comes into our earthly Man of sin, he has
not a place to lay or rest his head on, but is sought for by our sins to be
destroyed, for he says, the foxes (that are our worldly Passions) have holes,
and the birds (that are our vain Fantasies) have nests, but be has not
whereon to lay his head; Do thou not see (O vain man) that the most holy and
divine world or divine life is neglected of thee? and kept under thy earthly
being, and he is in the most lowest parts of thy earth, and under thy sinful
manhood, he is that most glorious and holy light that comes into thy wicked
world of sin, but thou art ashamed of him, because he discovers thy deeds of
darkness, so thou putst out this light and quenchest this spirit, for thou
love the deeds of darkness more then the works of light, therefore this
light or holy life is carried away by Joseph and Marie (the perfection and
fountain of Love) to the holy light, from whence he came, till all thy sin
and iniquity which sought his life is dead in thee, for the holy life cannot
live in thee, till sin be dead and rooted out of thee.

Now to look upon Christ coming into this external world, in such a mean
manner, his birth so low, and his condition so poor and despised, and sought
out by the Kings of the earth to be destroyed, was because they thought scorn
that one of so poor and mean birth should be King of all the earth; And thou
may see the mystery of his coming into this world in so poor and despised
manner, which is to show thee how he is in thy self and in thy internal
world despised and sought for to be destroyed by thy finnes the great Kings of
thy earthly being: therefore (O man) if thou readst the history of the birth of
Christ, and not look into the mystery how much it concerns thee, thou art never
the better for his coming; for his external coming to the sight of the world
shall vanish away like a tale that is told, or a dream that is seen no more:
therefore O man look into the Scripture (and into the holy writ) with a
diligent and circumspect eye, and into thy self where is written the holy word
to thy condemnation or to thy salvation: compare thy self and the scripture
together, and thou shall see thy self there for it is the true real lookeing
glass wherein thou may behold thy self; and thy own soul or spirit is a
witness to thee, that it relates to thee thy self, and it speaks the real
truth to thee in condemning or justifying thee, wherefore O man take it to
heart, for thou needst not no other witness of the truth thereof but thy self.

As for Christ's being led aside by the spirit into the Wilderness to be
tempted of the Devil, and that he fasted forty days and forty nights, and
that he was set upon a Pinnacle of the Temple, showing him from thence all the
Kingdoms of the earth in the twinkling of an eye, and that he told him all
the Kingdoms of the earth were his, for they were given him, and if he would
fall down and worship him they should be his; certainly this cannot be meant
of the external, for no mortal creature (taking on this elementary body of
clay) can subsist without food so long, nor could it be that all the Kingdoms
of the world were the Devils, for who did give them to him? nor can there be
any reason given, why or how he could possible see all the Kingdoms of this
world with his external eyes at one time: for this world being imagined round,
high and low, it is impossible that any external eye should see it at once:
therefore O man look to the mystery thereof, for when this holy Jesus is borne
into us, this wicked spirit comes to him, and seeing him clothed with our
frail and weak nature thinking to overcome him, showing him our barren and
wildernessed nature wherein is no good thing for food for him, so that he
must be starved if he lived in it, therefore he would have him obedient unto
him and he should have all his honor kingdom and riches, but he did forsake
them all as abominable, and brought his own food or kingdom with him, for
he lives by the power and life of the Godhead from whence he came, and by this
mighty power he makes this stony and barren ground of man's nature food for him
to live of and with, for he participates and lives of both natures; the
Godhead and the manhood, and this Godhead and manhood being joined together by
a conjunction (or reciprocal union) have betwixt them both brought forth Jesus
Christ the Son of God and Son of man, who is both God and man, and being in
the womb of the humanity, is nourished and fed by the same as of his mother,
for all children live of the mothers life and nature, and are fed by it: so
this Jesus Christ comes into our barren ground, and by his mighty power makes
it fertile and fruitful, bringing forth himself in us, to live of us, and we
by him, for our barren ground is plowed up by the law of God, and all the
thorns and thistles which is our sins, is plucked up and thrown away, that
this holy seed may be sowed in our hearts in place of our sins, and this seed
is a tender plant: wherefore, O man, look diligently to it, and weed up all
things that is like to destroy the same in thee.

And as for the Devil carrying Christ up into the holy City, and setting him
upon a pinnacle of the Temple, and showing him all the Kingdoms of the Earth in
the twinkling of an eye, and saying, that those Kingdoms were given to him;
this holy City is thy self, O man, and thou have given it to the Devil, and
he has begot many wicked generations and kingdoms in thee which is his; and
Christ taking thy sinful nature upon him to destroy it, the Devil being in
that nature of sin thinks to exalt Jesus, showing him what kingdoms he had got
in that nature, for which he would have him worship him, and he would give him
them all; but he reproves him and cares not for his wicked kingdoms, but
crucifies him and them, and casts him out of this nature, and makes this his
humanity to worship God, and says, Get thee from me Satan, for I will worship
my Lord and God; so Christ the divine power of God, taking upon him the sinful
nature, had upon him the power of the Devil who thought to destroy him in it,
so the Devil and he being in one nature strove for victory who should have
this nature for his possession and dwelling place, the divinity has the
victory when the humanity consents thereto, and then there is two against
one, but if thou consentest to the devil there is no fighting for thee, nor
art thou worthy the fighting for; therefore if thou have a mind to stay with
the Devil still thou may, for he will not pull thee out of his claws
against thy will: wherefore look to it, O man, for there stands before thee
life and death, choose life and live for ever; but if thou love death, thou
have death for ever.

As concerning the Ass that Christ took away, and his cursing the fig tree,
it seems strange in the letter, because it contradicts the truth, for the
truth says, that we should use no violence, nor take any man's goods from him,
and that we should not curse but bless; but we see here that Christ has taken
away the Ass that was bound, and cursed the fig tree against reason, for the
time of figs was not yet come; therefore certainly there is another mystery in
it, for it cannot be true according to the history that Christ should do such
unjust things, for no falsehood nor guile was found in his hands: therefore this
Ass is that simple innocence that is tied in thee with the cords of iniquity
and cannot stir; for the humanity never did ride thereon, till Christ came in
our humanity to make it free, and then he rides into Jerusalem the City of God
meekly sitting upon this Ass, which Ass is now the simple innocence of God,
on which (before Christ came into thy humanity) Balams did ride upon and did
kick and spurn this innocence without a cause; therefore be thou, O man,
this simple innocent Ass, that the King of Sion may ride meekly upon thee to
Jerusalem the holy City of God.

And for the fig tree that had no time to bring forth its fruits but was
cursed, is the humanity that Christ did take upon him, enduring therein the
curse of the law for the sins cause, nor could it bring forth fruit till Christ
came in it, and made it endure the curse of the law, which made it seem to dye
and vanish away: for this fig tree or humanity, could not bring forth fruit
till Christ came again in spirit to vivifie and renew the same, for he is the
life of the true fig tree that brings forth fruit in due season: so this
first fig tree that was accursed shows unto us the first creation in man, how
that it could not bring forth fruit being liable to the curse for sins cause;
and this tree is the humanity of Christ according to the flesh, that indureth
the judgment and curse of God with us for firs cause, without cause in
himself, save only his love to us.

And as for that certain man that fell amongst the thieves and was hurt, many
passing by and would not help him till the Samaritane came: O man, this
certain man is thy self that is gone out of Jerusalem (the City of God) to
travel, and has met with the Devil and all his company, which is pride,
vainglory, hypocrisy, lust, intemperance, wrath, envy, malice, bitterness
of spirit, covetcusnesse, evil censuring, murtherous minds, and all the
wickedness that is: and these are the thieves that has robbed thee of all
goodness, wounding thy soul, and leaving thee for dead: so the Priest and
Levit that passes by thee is the law, wrath, and curse of God that is upon
thee, and leaves thee alone to thy self for thy condemnation, because thou
bast left the city and house of God to travel thou know not whither to lose
and damn thy self with the Devil and all his Angels and wicked spirits,
that has killed and spoiled thy soul, for thy wounds of sin stink and are
puttified within thee (as David says, my wounds are festred and stink within
me) and so we lie as dead in trespasses and sins till the good Samaritane
(which is Jesus Christ) come and have mercy on us, and take us up and set us
upon his Ass which is his most innocent and harmless life, whereon he carries
thee as half dead, and after pours in the oil of his gracious goodness
into thy wounds to heal them, so that he becomes a plaster for thy sores
to heal thee, and indures all thy stinking filthiness upon him, for he has
thy sores in his salve which is himself, and is that most innocent and
harmless life, and he it is that bears the iniquities of us all, for all our
sins and transgressions is upon him; so this holy Christ is in hell in us
till we are cured of sin, for he is a salve for our stinking sores that is a
hell to him, and he indures thee, and the wrath of God upon thee, which is upon
him in thee, till thou art perfectly cured and made whole from all blemish or
spot: O how great is the love of God to thee, O man! why does not thy heart
melt in love to him again, seeing he is so good to thee? Where, O man, can
thou find such a love and lover, or such goodness as he is to thee without
any cause of thine, but for his own goodness sake whereby he takes pity on
thee to help and save thee? therefore, O man, (whosoever thou art that is dead
in trespasses and sins) if thou do not feel this power of God Jesus Christ
in thee, who is a salve for all sores (which does draw, scour and wash them
within thee, and put thee to pain with the power of his working salves) thou
shall never be well, think or believe what thou will of Christ without thee,
and of his great works, he nor they shall profit thee nothing unless thou have
the power of Christ working within thee, and that thou sensibly feel the power
of his working against sin in thee, which is a grievous hell and torment to
thee for the present to endure; but thou had better endure this hell against
thy sin for a moment, then be for ever lost and damned, and be deprived of God
and goodness for ever, having the sting of conscience stinging thee for what
thou have done, and for what thou have lost and deprived thy self off for
ever: therefore, O man, look to it in time whilst time does last, for this
world is time, the which if thou mispendest there is no time more; and in this
time is all worlds opened to thee, and if thou do not choose the divine and
most holy world in this time, it is for ever shut up against thee, and so thou
art deprived of God and goodness, and art in a most miserable condition:
wherefore, O man, do not dally with thy self, nor defer the time, putting
it off from one time to another; for time is a thief and steals away from
thee, therefore do not cheat or cosen thy self with false beliefes and faiths
of Jesus Christ, and what he has done for thee, the which he never has done
till thou feel the power of his working in thee with many agonies and bloody
sweats; and till thou feel the nails of his crucifying prick thee to the
very heart, and that thou feel the stings of death for sin in thee;
therefore O man, put no confidence in Christ till thou find the mighty power
and work of Christ in thee; for if thou do thou deceivest thy self, and
thy belief is in vain, and a dead faith without this work of Christ working
mightily in thee, pulling down all thy strong holds of sin and vain
imaginations, and offering thee up a pure soul to his Father, that God may be
all in all in thee: O that it were so come to pass in all souls, then were
they happy, but till then most unhappy.

And for that man that was said to be borne blind, is Christ after the flesh
in thee, which became thy self, who is conceived and borne in iniquity in thee
to save thee; for thy father (which is the devil) is become his father and thy
mother (which is lust) is become his mother; and Jesus Christ is that true
Physician that makes himself see in thee, and Christ saying to his Disciples
that the father of this blind man sinned not, nor the son, is meant that as he
is Christ (the holy unction or anointing) he comes of God, and is the Son
of God, and God is his Father, and they be no sinners, neither he nor his Son;
but Christ to show the glory of God became this blind man in us, and opened
his own eyes in us, which see not in man any good thing till sin is
destroyed out of the man: so these holy eyes are blind in us, till that time
that Christ have destroyed sin out of us, and then he opens his own eyes
in us, which eyes then are ours which sin had blinded in us before, so that
we could not see with those righteous eyes, but made those eyes to us to be
the eyes of the wicked nature, through which we looked not as they were in deed
and in truth (righteous and holy eyes) but as they seemed to us, in so much
that we have taken the holy God to be that to us which he is not in himself,
for our sins has made us think him our enemy when as he is our dearest,
friend, that till our sins are destroyed he does and will seem so to us that
which he is not in himself, for his eyes shall be blind to us, and his ears
deaf to us, so that he will neither see nor hear when we call and cry to him,
because there is a dark cloud of sin that separateth him and us, and he
will not hear us till this cloud is taken out of the way, and that we become a
true father and mother to him, for we have been wicked parents to him
heretofore, and have brought him into all wickedness and misery, and have
killed him in suffering for us as if he had done all wickedness, when as there
was no guile found in his mouth, but is that innocent Lamb that was slain in
the beginning of thy world of sin.

Also thou art that woman that is bound with Satan eighteen years, and art
become double with his bonds until thou go to Christ, that he may loose
thee from the bonds of Satan, and make thee whole and straight again.

And thou art she that have that bloody issue of sin for twelve years: O
touch therefore his garment, his flesh or mortification, and thou shall be made
whole; and this garment is the law of sin which cleanses thee from sin.

And thou art he that is possessed with legions of Devils or sins; O then
let Christ by his mighty power cast him out of thee that thou may be in thy
right mind again.

And thou art the man possessed with a deaf and dumb Devil, so that thou
can not speak to God, nor hear him when he speaks to thee: O fast thou
the true real fast, which is from all thy sins) and pray to God continually,
(with a broken and contrite heart and true sorrowful spirit) then may thou
speak to God and hear him when he speaks to thee.

And thou art or may be in that ship on that stormy sea, that is ready to
sinck thy ship with its boisterous waves, for God and the Devil are at strife
for thee, when thou have once joined thy self to God, and then begins the
bloody wars betwixt these two Kingdoms in thee, for when thy wicked world of
sin begins to be at an end, then is there Kingdom against Kingdom, and
nation against nation in thee, and stormy rageing seas roaring, so that the
heart of thy man of sin begins to fail in thee, and Christ is asleep in the
cabin (that is in thy inmost self, and is that still and soft voice)
therefore seek for him and awake him that he may save thee, and calm these
raging stormy seas within thee, with his most still and soft voice: and these
are the seas that St. Paul did sail through, God, and the Devil the truth,
and thely, which clasheth one against the other, and the humanity is the ship
that saileth betwixt those two seas and tastes of both and is broken, and the
forepart of that ship that stuck fast, (and was not hurt nor moved by the
clashing waves of those seas) is the most holy and divine Godhead Jesus Christ
within thee, which can endure, and is able to make thee endure (if thou stay in
the ship with him) all the stormy seas of hell, death, and Devil. But the
hinder part of the ship (which is the humanity,) must be broken because of our
sins and transgressions, and must taste of death for sins cause, but
nothing in the ship that stays in it to endure this storm of death shall
perish, and all the prisoners that are bound in it shall be saved and swim to
shore on the broken pieces of this ship: the true sense and consummation of
all is, that when we have endured the battle till sin be destroyed, then do we
enter into the most holy life and are saved.

Now to read the history of Christ's last supper how that the same was kept in
an upper Chamber, and that he did eat bread, and drink wine, and give of the
same unto his disciples: and that he was whipped, scourged, and crowned with
thorns, and how Judas sold him, and how that he was afraid to die, insomuch
that he did sweat drops of blood, and that he was nailed upon a Cross, and
was pierced through with a Spearel, so that there came forth of his side blood
and water, and that at his death the sun was darkened and the moon was put
out, and that he had gall and vinegar to drink, and that he was crucified
between two thieves. This is the most holy and sacred mystery which is acted
in the soul of every man that is saved; and this upper chamber is thy inmost
self, and this bread and wine, is the bitter cup of Gods wrath and indignation
whereof thy soul must drink for the sins cause, and thou art not able of thy
self to bear or drink this cup without some mighty power come to assist thee
to do it: now thy Judas or man of sin that is raised up to destruction, has
sold the most innocent life into the hands of the wicked to suffer for thy
sins; for the most innocent life comes to thee in fearfulness and
trembling, and thou being in him (in this fear and trembling) preparest thy
self to suffer with him; and thy Judas, Devil or wicked nature comes to
thee as if he were thy friend; and now seeing that thou will leave him he
fawneth on thee as if he loved thee and were thy friend, saluting thee as if
it were with a kiss of love; but he sells thee to the blind Jews to be
killed and crucified of them, which Jews are thy blind self will that now
crucifies thy self and Savior within thee, and thy self will carries thy
self and Savior into condemnation (with thy condemning conscience) into the
judgment hall of condemnation, where all thy sins rises up against thee
taunting, mocking and scourging thee, and crowning thee with the thorns of thy
sinful life, which pricketh and wounds thee and thy Savior with grief for
what thou have done; so that thou and he art in a bitter agony and sweat of
death, insomuch that thou desire and would feign have this bitter cup to
pass from thee; but thou must endure it if thou will be saved, for Gods will
must be done and not thine, for it is he that raises up all thy sins against
thee to condemn thee, crowning, whipping and scourging thee with what thou
have done, so that thou must now taste of the death of thy sins or otherwise
thou shall never taste of the life of God, for the life of thy sins is the
death of God in thee, and the life of God is the death to sin; and thou and
thy sins must be nailed to this cross, which cross is the patience and long
suffering of Jesus Christ in thee, unto which thou and thy sins art nailed
till thou art dead to thy sins, and thy sins to thee, for thy sins has
nailed thee and thy Savior together, and has pricked him and thee to the very
heart, so that he and thou do dye of those wounds, and he and thou cryest
out, My God, my God, why have thou forsaken me? and in the time of thy
sufferings (or Jesus that makes thee endure this curse or shameful reproach of
thy sins according to thy due desert) the Son of glory, the life and
brightness of the Godhead is darkened or put out, so that there is all
darkness, death and hell over the internal divine, and most holy world, till
thy sins and thou art dead one unto another; so thou see that the divine
and most holy world is in hell under thy earthly being till thy sins be
destroyed; and being in hell under thy body of sin and death, he raises up
all thy sins against thee to condemn and shame thee, and shows thee what a
partition wall is betwixt thee and him, which is the law of sin and death
that condemns thee, always rising against thee till sin be destroyed: so
the love of God to thee offers thee his power, which is Jesus Christ that
enters into thee to destroy the body of sin in thee, which body of sin is
the works of the Devil that has destroyed the body or works of God in thee.
It is not the divine and holy God that is against thee, but it is thy sins
that stands in judgment against thee to condemn and arraigne thee, so that
thou must go under their judgment, condemnation and execution for what thou
have done against God and goodness; for he it is not that is angry with thee,
nor condemns thee for he is that righteous and holy one that can endure all,
and is one and the same for ever; nor can he be any other, for he cannot be
moved to wrath or fury, for then were he changeable; but he is the
unchangeable, and one and the same for ever; but the deeds that thou have done
(against that holy One that is so good to thee) slyeth in thy face crying
vengeance against thee, and telling thee that thou must dye for what thou have
killed and cast away from thee, so till the law of sin has done his office
and killed thee (for killing) and laid thee under the earth in hell (where thou
have laid the holy One) thou shall never be at rest; for thou have killed, but
art loath to be killed; but thou must cast off this death or ^^p, otherwise
thou shall be ignorant of justice, for justice is to reward every one according
to his works, and as he has done to another, whether good or evil; so the
most holy One by his mighty power inlightens thee, and shows thee all thy
sins how they slye in thy face against thee, and shows the justice of the law
of sin, and that thou must dye for thy evil deeds, the which works fear
and trembling in thy heart, and then do thou cry and morn for help and can
find none, till the goodness of God comes to thee, taking pity and
compassion on thee, and helps thee to endure the death of sin for sin in
thee; so that now thou lie on the patience of God till thou art freed from
sin, and the Devil lies upon the other side of the patience or cross, and
is that thief that cannot repent, and thou art the other thief that art
repentant for what thou have done, and so find mercy, and in that day or
light of mercy thou shall enter into Paradise thy Masters joy, for now you have
suffered together, you shall also rise and relgne together and enter into the
joy together, which joy lies into thy inmost self in the cave of thy earth,
even there lies the most still and soft voice, which was not in the great
winds that did blow down the rocks of sin, nor in that carthquake for
sin, nor in that fire that consumes sin in which God is lost to the man,
for in that the man casts the holy God from him, is the very thing that does
condemn him and rise against him, so that he can never be at rest nor quiet
till he has found God again; and even thus does God appear to the man that
which he is not in himself, even a consuming fire, as he says in Thessalon.
God sends them strong delusions that they should believe lies because they
will not receive the love of the truth; for man thinks that God is angry with
him, and he neither can nor shall believe otherwise until sin be destroyed
out of him, for God does seem to appear in thy sins as an angry judge,
condemning thee till thou have suffered under them and for them, and so works
fear in thy heart, and all these angers that he seems to have against thee,
and those fears that he works in thy heart, is for thy future good, and for
the great love he has to thee recalling thee from thy sinful life, and when
thou have forsaken sin, then he does appear to thee in his glorious, amiable
and bright rays full of sweet ravishing contents, and then thy Judas, Devil
or sins has condemned themselves in thee and with thee, and has arraigned
themselves at the bar of Gods justice, and then they hang themselves, in thee
and break their own necks and brust their bowels asunder, and so there is an
end of them to thee, and an end of thee to them, and then thou cryest to thy
Father or God. It is finished, and so yeeldest up thy ghost or spirit into him,
and the veil (that is the flesh of Christ that divided betwixt the holy and
most holy place) is rent in twain from the top to the bottom, which veil,
death or flesh, is the long-sufferance and patience of Christ, that rasteth in
us till our sins are extinguished and blotted out, and this stands betwixt
the holy place, and the Sanctum Sanctorum, and all that will be saved must
taste of this flesh, death, patience, long-sufferance, bitter cup, agony, or
bloody sweat which stands before the holy of holies; and when we have tasted
this bitter death or cup, we enter through this veil, flesh or death of
Christ (which is the new and living way) into the holy of holies, or Sanctum
Sanctorum, which is the Kingdom of Heaven that is within you, and is peace,
righteousness, and joy in the Holy Ghost.

Now when the flesh of Christ has finished his course, then is he taken out of
the way, and then comes he again to thee the second time, and is thy holy
Ghost or Spirit which leads thee into all truth, which truth is meekness,
lowsinesse of Spirit, gentleness, lovingnesse, rejoicing in mind, ravishing
thoughts, sweet contemplations, singing Hymns and Halelujahs, praise and
thanksgiving to the Holy Ghost for their victoriousnesse, and this is thy
ravishing joy and comfort eternally, so that all the external losses in this
present world does not trouble thee, for thy mind is not below on these
perishable things; for thou art dead to them and live here as if thou livedst
not, and uses all things here as if thou used them not, and if thou had all
the honors and riches of this world thou would despise them, and think them
but dung and dross, for thou have far more excellent honor and riches then
this world can affoorde, but if by chance the Godly have the riches of this
world, as it is but a chance, seeing the Godly and ungodly oftentimes enjoy
them alike here, he accounts not the same his, but distributeth as he sees
need or necessity, as a faithful steward, but the ungodly thinks all that
he gets here is his; and will suffer another to starve and perish by him,
and in this thou may perceive a difference betwixt the Godly and ungodly, let
them brag of their Christianity as much as they will, their works show what
they be, but we see what a Christian is, and what a difficult thing it is to
be one, and how many difficulties he must run through, before he attain to
the perfection to be a Christian.

Now to understand and read the history of the crucifying of Christ, of his
condemnation, death, and burial, what is this to thee or me, if we feel not
the mystery of his condemnation, death, and burial, his resurrection,
ascension, and coming to judgment in me and with me, for if we do not suffer
with him, we shall not reign with him? therefore let us dye and be buried
with him, that we may arise and ascend into the heaven with him, and from
thence come to judge the quick and the dead, which dead is the sins that is
dead and lost for ever out of us: and the quick, is the living righteousness
to reign in us for ever; therefore unless I see the mystery of these things
wrought in me, the history thereof can do me no good, for in the history of the
death of Christ, is showed a great deal of weakness, for it is said that he
was so mightily afraid of death, that he did sweat drops of blood, and all the
wrath of his Father did but extend to the death of the external manhood upon
the Cross, but it seems strange to me (that he that had the power of heaven
and earth) should be so much afraid of an external and bodily death, when
there has been many since that have dyed for their religion, and for his sake
more terrible deaths: being drawn to pieces with wild horses, fleyed, burned
alive, broyled, roasted, boiled in lead, and all the terrible deaths that could
be devised by wicked and devilish men to put them to, as is made mention of in
the book of Martyrs, yet there was seen no such weakness in them, but they
went to their deaths cheerfully, thinking themselves happy to suffer for his
sake: Wherefore you may easily perceive, that there is a greater mystery in the
same which few do see or discern.

For my part I do not deny the history of the Scripture, but do believe that
those things were acted upon the Theater of this external world, to show to us
what is acted upon the Theater of our internal world; but if we look upon the
hystory of Scripture, as things acted by other men, and take no more notice of
it, we deceive our selves, for all the hystories points upon us, and we are the
man intended; for when Nathan the Prophet came to David, he seemed to speak to
him of another, when as he meant himself, and David did conclude what the
action represented to him in the person of another (by Nathan) was unjust, not
thinking that the Prophet intended himself but another, and so judged him to
death: but when the Prophet said it was himself; and that he was the man; he
was sorry, and loath to dye himself, although he did judge the other to death,
and thought he deserved death justly: but in condemning the other he judged
himself. Therefore we are the men that are to be condemned or saved,
according as our deservings are, and the Scripture is the real truth, and is
our true Nathan the Prophet that tells us what we have done, but he tells us
our selves in histories, and in the person of others, to try how far we
condemn others, and justify our selves, but when we condemn others we
condemn our selves, for we are the guilty and that wicked man, therefore
look into the scripture as if it were thy own soul, for all that is written
there, is written in thy self: and there is the two tables, the table of
stone, (thy stony heart) that is engraven with a rough pen and with a
thundering voice, which is the whole work and curse of the law for thy sins,
and the other table is the heart of flesh, which is soft and melts at the
word that is written in thee, and is ready to obey all the words of the
commandments that speaks in thee: but the table of stone (thy disobedient
and stony heart) must be broken for thy sin and disobedience cause, and for
thy Idolatries and all thy sins riseing up against thee, crying vengeance, so
that thy God (or goodness in his great zeal) throws down thy stony heart,
breaking it to pieces, and burns up all thy Idol Gods to powder, making
thee drink up their ashes (which is to make thee taste of the death and loss
of them) and still his zeal is so great toward thee, that he makes thee
sheath thy sword into thy brothers belly, which brother is thy nearest self
will or thy darling sins, so when thou have fulfilled the will of thy Jelous
God, he returns to his place where he was before, and the tables of stone or
stony heart is turned to flesh, and is obedient to the will of God and keeps
his commandments, the which I wish all Souls may do for their souls health
and safety.

There be many at this time that look externally for an infallible spirit,
when as the infallible spirit is internal in the soul of every man, for the
same spirit is Jesus Christ* the word of life that is near thee, even in thy
heart and mouth to do it, and to be obedient unto the same; and he is that
pearl hid in the field of thy heart, for which thou must sell all that thou
have to purchase this field that thou may enjoy that pearl.

And there are others that think that the external body is the soul, and
that it must dye and must answer for sin by that death, and that it must rise
again at the last day by Christ; therefore God cannot be their God whilst
their body is dead, for he is not the God of the dead but of the living; then
whilst they live here they may live as they list, and commit what sins they
will, for their body dying which they take for the soul) does make satisfaction
for their sin, which of necessity must draw this consequence, that if one man
kill another he does but the will of God, for he says, the soul that sins
must dye: I wonder much what those people (that hold such opinions) can say or
think of little children that dye in the womb, or as soon as they are borne
certainly no man in reason can say that their soul has sinned, but you will
allege their parents have sinned for them, as others have said; if it be so,
the sin of one condemns a great many that of themselves has not sinned,
the which to me appears to be altogether against reason and justice, and is
against the nature of God to condemn the children for the sin of the
parents, for Ezkiel says 18. that this proverb should be no more in israel,
that the fathers had eaten four grapes, and the childrens teeth are set on
edge; at he says that every soul stands upon his own bottom or its own
self, and the four^ that sins shall dye: also there are many creatures or
bodies (which they call souls) that are drowned in the sea, and diverse fishes
have fed upon that body, or that which they call the soul, and these fishes
have concocted or digested the soul of this man, and it is turned into the
flesh of a fish, and afterward this fish is taken, and another man or soul
eats this fish which is the concocted soul of the other man, so that his soul
is made fat and increased thereby, the one soul by eating the other, and
Caniballs which are men, eat other men and are fed thereby: now when the souls
of all these men are dead and concocted in those that have eat them, how shall
every one have his own proper soul at the last day when all the souls shall
arise? I would willingly hear it proved by good reason how every one can have
his own soul again, seeing they are all concocted and digested one in
another: but perhaps you will say we must believe against reason, which is
consequently that we must believe an absurdity; and the Apostle St. Paul
desires to be delivered from unreasonable men, which were absurd and did
believe against reason, for all men have not faith whose foundation is grounded
upon reason; this body which they call the soul is dead without the spirit, as
St. James witnesses in the second Chap. where he says, that as the body
without the spirit is dead, even so is faith without works; by which Scripture
it is manifest, that the body without the soul or spirit is dead, and as is
said before, God cannot be their God, because their body (which they term the
soul is dead, so as he cease to be their God while they are dead, all which
is contrary to sense, reason and Scripture, where it is said that he is the
living God, and the God of the living and not of the dead; also it is contrary
to sense and reason in this, that that which is the God, good, felicity, or
chief happiness of those that live, and are rational and sensible of the
same, cannot in sense, reason or Scripture, be said to be the joy, happiness,
or God of the dead, because he is not sensible or capable of any joy, felicity
or happiness at all.

THe sum of all, and the whole discourse of this Book is, that we should
fear to disobey the holy God, but keep all his Commandments which is the
whole duty of man, and to live a pure, exact, just and holy life, not doing to
any man what we would not have done to us, but doing all the good to another
that we would have done to us; and this is the infallible Spirit, Jesus Christ,
the power of God in us, which directs, corrects, instructs, persuades, and
makes us wise unto salvation; for he is the holy word of life unto us, and he
is the Father, Elder, true Bishop, and high Priest of our souls; so that we
need no other Father, Elder, Bishop, nor high Priest, but this holy Jesus
Christ in us, for he is the holy unction that we have from above, and the holy
One that teaches us all things, and discovers all mysteries unto us, leading
us into all truth, if so be that we are obedient unto him; but if we are not
obedient unto this infallible Spirit Jesus Christ in us, then we shall know
nothing of God or of the Scripture, but it shall be a sealed book, a dead
letter, and seeming contradiction unto us: but I hope we shall all learn and
be taught of him, and declare every one to his friend and neighbor what the
Lord (the infallible Spirit) has done for his poor soul, saying, What we
have learned, heard, felt and tasted of the good word of life, that will we
declare unto you.

FINIS.
