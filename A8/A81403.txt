TO ALL NATIONS, KINDREDS, LANGUAGES, TONGUES, and PEOPLE, WITH YOUR PRINCES
and RULERS* And all People from the Highest to the Lowest. This to you is the
Word of the Lord God.
FEar God and give glory to him, for the hour of his Judgments is come, and
his dreadful terrible Day will come speedily upon all Nations and People;
therefore worship him that made Heaven and Earth, and the Sea, and the
Fountains of Water, and them upholds by the Word of his Power; let his fear and
dread be upon you all: People, see what acquaintance and union you have with
him; he is a God that will not be mocked, who is now coming in his pure
dreadful Majesty, and glorious Almighty Power, to break down and dash in pieces
like a Potters Vessel all people from the highest to the lowest, from the
Prince on the Throne, to the Beggar on the Dunghill, in and amongst all Nations,
Kindreds, Languages, Tongues, and People, who put the Day of the Lord God afar
off, and live without the knowledge of the only true God in this world,
serving an unknown God in the ignorance of your minds, and in Traditions;
worshipping you know not what, and walking every one in your own ways, doing
your own works, which leads to satisfy the flesh in the lusts thereof: All
which is abomination to the only true and ever living God, to whom you must
give an account for every idle word, and all your deeds done in the body.

All people upon the face of the Earth, let the time past be sufficient you
have lived without the knowledge of the only true God; in this day the living
God visits you with a day of Visitation of mercy, to declare his Counsel to
you, that ^ou may come to the knowledge of him; be warned to depart from the
evil of your ways, and hearken diligently to the Counsel of the only true
God, who waits upon you to be gracious unto you, whose grace has appeared unto
all men, which is the Light Christ Jesus the Son of God has ^ighted you with,
that discovers unto you the secret evil of your hearts and consciences; in
the fear of the living God, search your hearts with the Light, which is the
Counsel of God, that convinces you in your hearts and Consciences, that Lying
is a sin, Swearing is a sin, Covetousness a sin, Pride a sin, Drunkenness a
sin, and Gluttony a sin, Whoredom and Uncleanness a sin, Cozening, Cheating,
and Dissimulations sins, Tyranny, Cruelty, and Oppression, and Murder are
sins; which forementioned, cries to the God of Heaven for Vengeance, which if
you do not walk in obedience to the Grace of God, the Light, which discovers
them, to guide you out of them: As the Lord God destroyed the old world, who
received not his Counsel, so will the Lord God of Heaven and Earth break in
upon all you people, scattered in all Nations, Kindreds, Tongues and Languages;
for his eternal Decree is gone over you all who walk in your wicked ways, he
will break you down and dash you to pieces, and you shall become an abhorring
to all flesh: Therefore prize your time while God preserves you, for the Day of
your Visitation is come, wherein the God of Heaven visits you, and exhorts you
in the Power of his Spirit to return to him, which if you diligently hearken to
his Counsel the Light, which shows you your evil ways, and convinces you of
your sins as before written, and wait on him in the Light to lead you out of
all Idolatry, and every sinful and evil way; then will the only true God give
you power over your sinful and unclean nature, and he will teach you his Ways
and lead you in the Paths of Righteousness, and save you out of all your
Idolatrous ways you have walked in, and will establish you in eternal Rest and
Peace, with all his Children that walk in obedience to his Counsel the Light,
which convinces of sin in the secrets of your hearts and consciences, in which
Light he is gathering of his People out of all Nations, Kindreds, Languages,
and Tongues, and People, into his own Kingdom, in the Light with him to walk,
who is now establishing his Kingdom in the Earth, which Kingdom shall break
down all other Kingdoms, and their Dominion take away, and destroy to the end.

Then shall the Kingdom of the everliving God be known in the Earth to destroy
the Image, (that will not submit to him,) and to establish all those that walk
in the Light, in his everlasting Kingdom to dwell, and there to praise his Name
alone, who is worthy over all, God blessed for ever.

HEAR and FEAR all Nations, Kindreds, Tongues, Languages, and People, REPENT
and TURN to the only true God, in harkening diligently to his Counsel the
Light, that convinces of sin in the secrets of your hearts and consciences,
that ye be not cut off in the dreadful terrible Day of the fierce wrath of the
everliving God, wherein he will destroy all Idolatry out of the Earth, and
perform according to his Word, here to you declared, and none of you shall
escape, which disobey his Counsel the Light, and you shall certainly know the
mouth of the Lord has spoken it, what he will bring upon all Nations.

Remember you are warned in your lifetime, in this Day of your Visitation, if
you slight it, your destruction is of your selves, and your blood is upon your
own heads.

From the Righteous Seed, of whom it is written, It shall be no more said, the
Lord lives that brought us forth of the Land of Egypt; but the Lord lives
that has raised up his Seed, and brought it forth of the North-Countrey, Jer.
23. 7, 8.

Forth of the Northern Country called England, from the Seed of God there
risen, that shall spread over all the Nations of the World.
