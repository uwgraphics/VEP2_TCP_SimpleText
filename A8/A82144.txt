A DECLARATION Of the Faithful Soldiers of the Army, to the Honest People of
the NATION.
WHereas it has pleased God, out of his gracious Providence, to manifest to
the Good People of this distracted Commonwealth, his Rule and Government
amongst us; We do now appeal to that Great God, whom we must own as the Great
Commander of our Armies, and General of our Forces; acknowledging him to be the
first Worker amongst us.

By many signal Tokens it has been made apparent, That God has owned in a
most especial manner the poor Soldiery of this Nation; which must needs strike
real reflections upon the Consciences of all sober and honest Men, who have
adventured thus far, and have found Jehovah-jireh, God in the Mount amongst us.

As God has made and appointed us for the geneneral good of the Nation, so we
do most seriously, with real hearts own the Godly of this Nation, and will be a
Cove^t to them, although to the destruction of our lives and fortunes, if God
so pleases, for the general good of them all.

As for the breaches that are amongst us, we claim an interest in them; for the
Great God, for our sinful deserts, in our backsliding from him, has laid this
visitation upon us; and so we must own his most legal dealings with us. The
consideration of which, does cause reflections upon our hearts humbly to own
these his Chastisements, and to consider these remarkable Tokens of his love.
For if we consider the unworthiness of our dealings, and the specious pretenses
which have gone along with us under fair glosses, we must confess, that what
distractions are among us, are not answerable to our just deserts; But we know,
That the dealings of the Almighty are not to be found out; therefore we
confess, That we have found God merciful although we have transgressed, For
with him is mercy that he may be feared: and he has thus dealt with us, that
we might take notice of his long-suffering, and goodness to us; to his glory
let us ascribe it, and with thankful hearts return hearty praise for these
great mercies received by us.

And now to come to a further serious Consideration of Gods good dealing with
us: we do desire to praise the Lord for his uniting of the Army with such
Unanimity and Courage, to stand for, and maintain the Good Old Cause so long
contended for, and which the Lord has formerly so much owned, although our
backslidings might have given cause of a far greater judgment then has yet
befallen us: which we hope will be prevented by our return and owning our first
Principles with so much cordial affection as is at this time declared amongst
us, although great opposition might be expected; But that God that can throw
down at a blast the loftiest Cedars, can also raise out of the earth small
Shrubs to glorify him, and to do his Work: which with heart and mind is so
much desired by the Faithful Members of the Army, as is at this day
experienced amongst us.

Therefore we pray, and hope it will also stir up the Faithful of this Nation
to this Consideration, That although Objections may be raised against, and
Aspersions cast upon the poor despised Instruments of this Work, yet are we
unanimously resolved to maintain our First good Principles, and to own the Good
Old Cause, as we have already testified; First, by our Addresses for the
rooting out of superfluous and ill-affected Members of the Army; and Secondly,
by our Real Desires and Concordance with the Faithful, known so to be, which
were turned out without any just or lawful account given therefore.

As God has been pleased to instruct us so far to begin the Work, so we hope
the Lord in his time will perfect the same for the general good and comfort of
this Nation; not doubting but the honest People of this Commonwealth will take
notice that that we are not Self-seekers, nor desire to be Self-ended, but
Conscientious in these things; assuredly knowing, that the Lord judges the
most secret thoughts, and that no practice nor thing formed against God shall
prosper, who is able to do his own Work without any Instruments at all

Therefore with serious reflections upon our consciences, we do most humbly
implore the Lord to bless these our honest desires, and to go along with us in
our hearty endeavors to glorify him: And truly since the Lord has been
pleased to stir up our hearts in this great Work, to the glory of God be it
spoken, we have likewise from the Faithful of the Nation received so great
encouragement and concurrence in our desires, in one and the same thing, that
it does greatly encourage us; and we hope we shall with an unanimous courage
show our selves for our great God, for the Good Old Cause, and for the Good
People of this Nation; To whom we do most unfeignedly present these Just
Intendments we are fixed upon.

And we likewise return most sincere Thanks to the honest People of this
Nation, especially our cordial friends in this City and the Places adjacent,
for their many good Exhortations, and the great Encouragement we have had from
them in these our Proceedings.

And truly we hope the Lord will bless our real endeavors in these our honest
Principles: For we are not only desirous to destroy any Arbitrary Power that
shall oppose us herein, but likewise to be Unanimous for a present applying of
our selves to the performance of that we do declare. And we desire to make
these our Purposes apparent, hoping that the Good People of this Nation will
with serious hearts join with us, as they have begun; and do not question, but
those to whom we have access, will faithfully own us, and give us encouragement
in the same.

These honest Resolutions of ours, we thought fit to declare to the Good People
of this Nation, not doubting but that they will own, and stand by us, as long
as we stand for the Good Old Cause. Desiring the Lord to own us all, and to
bring us to the wished Effects of our Spiritual and Temporal desires, for the
Public good of the Commonwealth; and in the end to eternalize us in the
blessed union and fellowship of Himself in glory, is the hearty Prayer and
Desire of all the Honest and Faithful Soldiers in the Army.

FINIS.
