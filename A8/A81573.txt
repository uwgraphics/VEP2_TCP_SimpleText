A DIVINE PRAYER NECESSARY TO BE USED EVERY DAY IN EACH particular Family,

During the time of this present Parliament.

Printed Anno 1641.

O Pray for the Peace of Jerusalem.
SAint Paul tells us what need we have of such Praying: I exhort you
(says he) that first of all Supplications, Prayers, Intercessions, and giving
of thanks be made for all men, for Kings, and for all that are in authority,
that we may lead a quiet, and peaceable life, in all godliness, and honesty,
1. Timothy. 2.1, 2.

IF thou ask any thing, either thou shall have it, or if thou have it not, it
is not expedient for thee to have it, and then God does not thy will, that he
may do his own for thy good, says

Elnat. Par. A Divine Prayer, necessary to be used every day, in each
particular Family.
O Eternal God, and King of glory, (who make all things; and preparest them
for the glorifying of thine own name) prepare our hearts to pray unto thee,
and cause thine ear to hear us. We humbly thank thee (Oh heavenly Father)
for all spiritual blessings wherewith thou have blessed us, in heavenly
things; and we also thank thy Majesty, for thy liberal blessings wherewith
thou have prevented us in earthly things; and that thou art become our most
merciful God, and loving father in thy beloved Son Jesus Christ our Lord: We
praise thy name also, for all the means of salvation, which thou have
vouchsafed us, and the free passage of thy Word amongst us: We bless thee
likewise, for our Royal King, and Queen, with their hopeful Progeny: And
for that Honorable assembly in the, high Court of Parliament, now (at this
time) by thy gracious providence assembled; we humbly beseech thee, (O our
God) to cause our gracious King to rejoice in thy strength, and to be glad in
thy salvation, and let his glory be great in thee, and (as a blessing) let him
rule over us al his days, and make him glad with the joy of thy countenance,
and as thou (O merciful Protector) have been pleased to work in his Royal
heart, the calling of that long desired Parliament: so dear father grant, that
it may never enter into his Majesty's breast to dissolve the same, until they
have confirmed the purity of Religion, the glory of the King, and the peace of
the Church and Commonwealth. We confess, (O Lord) our Land is full of sin,
and we have much offended thee: But Lord thou art full of mercy, we have all
transgressed exceedingly: But oh our God, let not thy Name loose that great
glory, nor thy Church that great benefit, which (through thy mercy) may now,
by the continuance of that high and Honorable Assembly (thy grace continuing
amongst them) be greatly increased: And blessed Lord, give them we beseech
thee, thy blessed give them favor in the Kings eyes, that thou may both
reveal to them thy Will, and also cause the Kings Majesty to delight to see
the same performed, oh thou that art the giver of all good things, give unto
our Royal King, such abundance of wisdom, whereby (O Lord) He may discern
thy faithful Saints, and His true-hearted Subjects from Idolaters, from thine
and his enemies; from Achitophells, and all Treacherous Counsels, and
Counselors: O dear Father, let not the malice of the devil, with all his
instruments, be ever able to raise up such divisions, calumnies, and mischiefs
amongst us, as may any ways hinder the happy proceedings of that Honorable
assembly. And Lord, we beseech thee, that all such who any way go about, to
hinder the propagation of the Gospel, the honor and Happiness of the King,
or peace of the Church and Kingdom; Lord grant that the Counsels of ^suc^
^^ongst us may be had in no esteem, but turned into foolishness, and let
their wicked devises fall upon their own pates: But bless O Lord, thy
faithful ones, and let the congregation of thy Saints be had in esteem, oh be
favorable to thy Church here in England, and build up the Walls of this thy
Jerusalem, grave her upon the Palms of thy hands, and let her Builders
prosper, but cause her destroyers, and such as would lay her wast to be cast
out of her: O dear father, hear us we beseech thee, and have mercy upon us,
O be not deaf toward us; lest if thou answer us not graciously, we perish
everlastingly: And give us faith to rely on thee continually, renew thy Image
in us, give us the true knowledge of thee, endue us with Holiness before thee,
and righteousness one toward another, give us Repentance for our sins past,
and grace to walk before thee in the fullness of thy Spirit, for the time to
come, give us grace and peace in this life, and in the life to come Eternal
glory, through Jesus Christ our Lord: To whom with thee O Father, and the holy
Ghost, be all honor and glory, now and for ever, Amen.

FINIS.
