For every Individual Member of the Honorable House of Commons.
^R,
THe law of England having always been esteemed by me the visible state,
security of my life, liberty, and propriety, for the preservation of which, I
have in the field with my sword in my hand often run the h^zzard of death, and
being oppressed contrary thereunto by the present House of Lords in June 1646.
I coould do no less for my own preservation, and the preser^ation of the
liberties and freedoms of my native country, then to fly by way of Appeal to
the au^hority and jurisdiction of your House (my legal Peers and Equals) who
by the Commons of Eng^and are chosen and bet^usted to be the great and grand
Patrons and Guardians of their liberties and ^reedomes, and ought not to suffer
them to be trodden underfoot by all the Lords in England. And my ^ormall
Appeal from the prison of Newgate, I made unto your house, the 16. of June
1646. (now ^rinted in the 9. 10, 11. pages of The Free man's freedom
vindicated) which was accepted, and appro^ed of by your House, and also read
and debated, and committed to a select and chosen Committee, ^here Mr. Henry
Martin had the Chaste, (before whom I made my plea, and since printed it, and
cal^^^ An Anatamy of the Lords tyranny) who was on^y authorized in matter of
fact to examine all the Lords proceedings with me, there being then, as appealed
to me no scruple either in the house, or any of that Committee about the Lords
jurisdiction over a Commoner, and having most illegally, in a tyrannical and
chargeable imprisonment, staid above ^6 months for that report, there being,
as to me ^ppeares, some more scruples in your house now about the Lords
jurisdiction, then was when I first ^ppealed to you; your house resolved upon
15. October, 1647. anew, to commit the whole ^atter of my ^eport then lately
made by Mr. Martin, to a new Committee, who are to consider of presidents in
^his and the like cases, and to state their opinions to the house, what they
think fit to be done thereupon, and the special care of it is referred to Mr.
Maynard, before whom and the Committee I appea^ed the 20. October, 1647. and
had liberty to make my grand Plea in point of law against the Lords
^urisdiction, and their unjust and illegal dealings with me, which grand plea,
with my addition^^ ^lea) herewith present unto you, entreating you as one of my
Judges, seriously to read and consider I^.

And on the 1. November 1647, upon a motion in your house for an addition to my
Committee, (that so my long and unsupportable attendance may come to some
issue) all the Members of your House that will come to my Committee are added
to it, and by the power of that Committee, I am summoned before them the 8.
present, to state my questions, upon which their results or judgments are
(...) ^low, or be grounded, and being before them, apprehended some conceptions
in them, that the matter was very difficult and weighty, although I conceive in
my aforesaid pleas, I have made it as ^^^in as the Sun that shines at noone
day, that the Lords have dealt most illegally and unjustly with me, and dare
venture my life and being upon what I have before both Committees said against,
at the Lawyer, in England in point of law, but in regard I apprehend (for all I
have said) that there is some ^cruples in some Members of that Committee, and
may be much more in diverse in the house, when it is reported in that slender
manner that it is like, there being not any results upon the (...) question
(...) the Committee. I therefore crave leave in writing to state my questions I
presented to the Committee, with some additions to them, and in the first place
I lay down this position, which at my utmost ^^^ll^ according to the rules of
law and justice, I will make good, viz.

That the book called my plea to Judge Reeves, for wrighting of which I was
summoned to the Lords bar, it an honest and just book, free from scandals and
falsehoods, and has nothing but (...) in it, and therefore neither punishable
by the House of Lords, nor any Court of justice in England, but admit it were
full of notorious scandalls in the highest nature, the maine question will
(...).

1. Whether the house of Lords by the Law of England, have any original
jurisdiction, in (...) o^ ^^^^ly, to summon me a free commoner of England up to
their bar to answer a charge for (...) the foresaid book, or any other book
though never so scandalous in it self? which I positively deny, and s^^ven
strong reasons or arguments J made before, and gave unto the foresaid
Committee, which you may please to read in my Grand Plea page 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
11, 12 (...) of which briefly are. (...) also my plea Mr. Martin, pa. 9. 10.


First that the Lords sit not in their House by any power or authority, d^^^^
from the peoples free election and choice, but are merely and altogether the
^^^^tures of the King, made by his prerogative, sometimes of the basest and
corr^p^^^^ of the people, being the mere issues of his will, who himself is
limited and bounded by the law, (...) who by his writ that summons them to sit
in Parliament, only impowers them to confer and treat (...) him (or afford
their Council) of certain hard urgent affairs, concerning himself, the
State, (...) defense of the Kingdom of England, and the Church thereof, but my
pretended offense touch^^ none of these things. And besides, the Lords had no
conference nor treaty with the King, their prerogative foutaine, Ergo: but read
my Grand plea, page 6, and 7.

Secondly, I was the 10. of June 1646. summoned up to the Lords bar, to answer
such things a^^ stood charged with before their Lorships, concerning a pamphlet
entitled as before, which did not in the least belong unto the jurisdiction of
their Court, but at the most, is merely an action tryable at the Common law,
and no where else, (see Cooks 5. part report, page 125. De libellis fam^sis,
and 13. Hen. 7. Relway, and 11 Eliz. Dier 285. and 30. Assise, pla. 19. and 3.
E. 1. chap. 33. and 37. E. 3.18. and 38. E. 3.9. and 42. E. 3.3. and 2. R. 2.5
and 12. R. 2.11. and 1 part of your own book (...) Decl. page 208. read my Plea
page 7, and 8.) And being so, they ought not to have meddled with it, it being a
known maxim in law, that when an ordinary remedy may be had, an extraordinary
is not to be made use of.

Thirdly, no man is to be imprisoned nor judged, but by the known, established
and declared law^^ of the land, see the Petition of Right. But there is no
established law of the land for the judgment of the Lords in any thing, where
the King their creature is not concurrent, 14. E. 3. c. 5. Which statute
plainly shows that in delays of justice or error in judgment in inferior
Courts, (which is all the causes they have jurisdiction of by law, which binds
them as well as any other Court, 4. H. 4.23.) there ought to be a Petition to
the King, and a Commission from him to them, to give them cognizance or power
of it, but none of this was in my case Ergo: but read my Plea, page 8. and 9

Fourthly, By Magna Charta, and 3. E. 1.16 and the Petition of Right, no man is
to be judged (...) by his Peers or Equals, that is men of his own condition,
and by due process, by indictment, presentment, or original writ, by a jury
of his Equal, of good and lawful people of the same neighborhood, according
to the old law of the land. But the Lords are none of my Peers, See Clerks
case 5. part Cooks reports, and his 2. part institutes. sol. 28.29.48.50. and
Sir Simon de Berisfords case 4. E. 3. R^t. 2. Neither had I in any one
particular any legal proceeding, being summoned before any charge was filed
against me Ergo: but read my plea page 9, and 10.

Fifthly, By the laws of this land, no man is to be Judge in his own case, ^.
H. 6. sol. 1^. and 5. E^^^. Dier. 220. and Dr. Bonhams case 8. part Cooks
reports. But the Lords were with me complainants prosecutors, witnesses, fury
and Judges, Ergo: but read my plea, page 10. 11. and 1. part book, D^^. page
38. 39. 201, 278.

Sixthly, if the Lords judgment originally were binding against me, then a few
Lords would bl^^ not only me, but all the Commons of England, (who one by one
may be served by them as I am) and that without any hope of redress, they
being Judges still in the appeal^ (which both law and rea^^^ abhors, 1. part
book Decl. page 41. 150. 207. 496. 637. 690. 726. 728) and to by this means
the weal and safety of the people (called by you the supreme law, 2. part
book Decl. page 879.) is totally destroyed, and we the Commons of England made
the perfectest slaves in the world, by having o^ fundamental laws destroyed
and made Ciphers, and the power of our representatives destroyed and made
Ciphers, which ^s an act of higher treason then ever was committed by
Str^fford, and (...) thousand times more justly deserves his doom, then his
crime (of but endeavoring to subvert (...) fundamental laws) did, but read my
grand plea, page 11, and 12.

Seventhly, The Lords being the mere creatures of the King made by his will,
and pleasure, and (...) there as prerogative persons only, and yet in law and
by their own principles, as Lords with^^^ the King they have to prerogative,
and yet have with a witness a^ted upon me, etc. without the King or his
particular Commission, which makes all they have done unto me to be null, and
void, (...) in law and reason, and renders them in my apprehension (for this
their habit^^llnesse in the w^^^^ and highest of tyranny) to have forfeited
their power and honor, and (...) ought any (...) by (...) (...) trustees of
the people, (and who should be the carefull^ and watchful Guardians of their
laws and liberties) to be owned or acknowledged to be a house of Peers, but a
company of Apostates falno ^^om their first institution, and absolutely
degen^^ated into a pack of tyrants, and therefore in equity, ^eason, and
justice, ought as well as the Star Chamber, to be plucked up by the roots and
transcendently ^^ned besides.

The second question that at the Committee I truly stated was this, whether it
be warrantable or ^ustifiable by law in the House of Lords to summon me a free
and legal Commoner of England up to their b^r, to answer a charge before any
be in being, or filed against me? which also I positively deny, and have proved
to be most illegal in my plea last year before Mr. page 8: 9 see also the 4th
reason before.

My third question at the Commitee I stated to this effect, whether by the law
of England, it be justifi^ble for the Lords to summon me up to their bar to
answer a charge, and then when I come there, refuse to show it me, though
desired by me, but examine me upon interrogatories against my self? which I
also confidently deny, and for proofs se^ your own Votes made for me in your
house the 21. of May 1641. against the Star Chamber, and the Lords own decree
made in that very cause 13. Feb. ^645. printed in the last page of my relation
of my proceedings at their bar.

My fourth question that now I truly state is this, whether it be warrantable
by law in the Lords to summon me to answer a charge at their bar before they
have any crimes against me, and Ex officio to examine me, and thereby either
force it to stand mute, (which they would consture a contempt) or to plead for
my self, and from my plea to p^ck quarrels against me; and so ^otally wave
the thing they originally summoned me for, and commit me for a pretended crime,
committed Ex postsacto, to remain in prison, during their pleasure? which is
ad infi^itum even till dooms day in the afternoon, for they will never be just
till then, and so I shall never be released by them: see their warrant of
commitment of the 11. June 1646. and my printed plea to Mr. Martin, page 5. and
7.

My fifth question I state is this, whether it be warrantable by the law of
England, for the Lords to summon me up to their bar, where by their ille^all
dealings with me, I am necessitated to declare against their assuming a
jurisdiction over me, and before them under my hand and seal, appeal to my
legal judges the House of Commons, and yet notwithstanding they got on to
judge me, before my appeal (which was a supersedeas) be determined? see my
reasons in the 9. p. of my plea to Mr. Martin.

My sixth question I state thus, whether it be warrantable by law for the Lords
to summon me up to their bar after my appeal to the House of Commons, and when
I am by force brought, say nothing to me, but command me to kneel at their
bar, and for refusing so to do, commit me during their pleasure close prisoner
to Newgate, without pen, ink, or paper, or the access of any whatsoever in
any kind, but only my keeper, and then to set Sergeant Finch, Mr. Hayle, Mr.
Hear^ne, and Mr. Glover, to draw up a charge against me, for pretended crimes
committed after my first summons, and without ever giving me notice, or
suffering me to speak either with my wife, friends or council, to bring me up
the third time after three weeks cl^se and barbarous tyrannical restraint, to
answer a charge^ see their warrant of close imprisonment of the 23. of June
1646. and the 5. 9. page of my plea to Mr. Martin.

My seventh question, I state thus, whether any Court in England that meddles
with that which by law they have no jurisdiction of, can either fine or
imprison the party summoned before them, in such a case for contemning,
affronting or abusing of them? or whether it was any affront or contempt, (in
law) in me, for maintaining in high language at the Lords bar my legal rights
against their (...) ^^ping encroachments see my reasons and arguments in the
12, 13, 14. pages of my grand plea.

My eight question is this, whether or no it be justifiable by the law of
England, for the house of Lords for a pretended or real misdemeanor, totally
to destroy my contin^ment or continuance by fining me 4000. l. being more then
ever I wa^ worth? and making me incapable for ever to (...) my office either
Marshall or Civil in Church or Common wealth, and seven years imprisonment in
the Tower of London, 11. or 13. weeks of which in the Tower J was divorced
from my wife, and all my friends, and the names of all those that came to visit
me taken? see the 14. chap of (...) 3. E. 1.6. and the 10. and 2^. pages of my
plea to Mr. Martin.

My last question is this, whether in case the Lords have no legal
jurisdiction over me, wheth^^ (...) no are not all those Gaolers and keepers of
prisons, etc. that have executed their illegal orders, decrees, and commands
upon me, liable by the law of England to make me reparations therefore? In the
case of the Marshall^es, in the 10. part of Cooks reports.

And now Sir, seeing the Committee has not fulfilled the order of the house,
in giving their opinions of the cause, and yet intend to report it, by which
means I have lost and am deprived of the chiefest good I expected from the
Committee, and may be at ten times a greater loss in the Ho^^^ so rawly it
come to be reported, wherefore if you be a true English man, and a man of
justice and ^^^nour, I earnestly and pressingly desire your just assistance,
that I may have a special day assign^^^ (...) the Committee once again to
sit, and that seeing by diverse of your house, the opinions of the Lawyers is
judged so essential to the determination of the business, I earnestly desire
your just assistan^ for aspeciall order from your house, that 10. or 20. of
them may attend that day. And in regard Mr. Maynard to whom by your house the
especial care of the business is committed, is so extraordinary full of
business being tear me time, that it may be he cannot conveniently be there,
nor it may be spe^^ so much time as a full and legal debate, pro andcon will
require, then I earnestly desire, that seeing all the members of the house are
of that Committee, that the Mayor number present, (...) appo^^^ new Chairman,
fully to debate and argue the business openly and freely and positively draw
up the results, opinions, and sense of the Committee upon the ^hole business,
and if your house thi^^e (...) I earnestly desire the Lords may have notice to
send, if they please their Proctors, to defend if they (...) their dealing with
me, or if not this:

Then secondly, I earnestly desire your assistance to procure of the house, a
fixed day when Mr. Maynard shall make the report as it is, that so it may
receive a full debate in a considerable full house and that if it be possible
the house may be turned into a grand Committee, that so every man may fully
speak his conscience and judgment, that so every man in the house may truly
know the state of the business, that so neither the House of Lords, nor I may
rashly or inconsiderately be condemned, by maiority of voices, and if my cause
singly laid in the impartial scale of justice and law, will not ^en^ our it
self, J crave not our hairs breadth of favor or mercy, only I earnestly
desire that none of my writings occasioned by the Lords transcendent and almost
unsupportable oppressions ^^^^^he, (...) be thrown in, to hinder the validity,
force or strength of that judgment I desire, till the final judgment of your
house be past, and then I shall according to the rule of law and justice,
answer the Lords or any else in England, that has any thing to say to me
therefore. And to conclude all, seeing the Apostle Paul says, He is worse then
an infidel, that does not his utmost to provide for his family. And the
Prophet Jeremiah says, They that be slai^e with the Sword, are better then
they that be slain with hunger for these pure away, stricken through for want
of the fruits of the (...). And seeing? I have s^a^^e been free one years
together this 11. years from chargeable (...), and seeing I ha^^ ^^llowed this
House now above 7. years for justice against my Star Chamber judges to my
extraordianry charges, and yet to this day have not obtained one farthing
tokens worth (...) ^^^ctive justice all which truly said together be good
earnest, renders any gallant death in the wor^^ (...) it ^ome (...) from my
^e^^e) more acceptable unto me th^^ a continuance in my unjust, un^^pportable
and (...) imprisonment, it being too perfect a b^d^ of slavery for a
heroic-^^spirit^^ ^^^^y to ^maine (...) therefore if there be my (...) of
compassion in you, or any spark of (...) ^^^cience, I most came (...), and
most pre^^^^g^y entreat your active assistance (...) speedy per^^d of ^y
business before you, either to my justification it innocent, or condemnation
^^legally guilty, a^^ that I may not be kept in person in a ^^^^^ing condition,
but may immediately be (...) ^ith (...) an allowance for my sub^^^t^nce as is
my right and (...), both by the law of England, and the customed the Power. Or
else that (...) will take speedy (...) th^^ I may receive ^tions from my
S^^^-Chamber Judges, (which (...) laid at your (...) 2. years, and (...) your
House to hel^^ me to (if they please) as for me to come to Westminster to
desire it of yo^^ that so I may have some thing of my own to keep me alive, and
my wife and little children, (...) I rest your true friend in the faithful
discharge of your duty to the kingdom.

John Lilburne.
