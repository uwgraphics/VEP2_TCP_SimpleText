THE HVMBLE PETITION OF THE VVELL-AFFECTED YOUNG MEN IN The City of London and
Liberties thereof, To the Right Honorable the Lords and Commons in the High
Court of PARLIAMENT now Assembled.
In most humble manner shows,
THat your former gracious acceptance of Petitions, from person of as mean
quality as our selves, together with your late kind imbracement of that
PETITION from our Masters and others of eminent quality (for which we present
our humble thanks) has incited us (though in regard of our present condition
not so much considerable) to address our selves also in all humility to this
Honorable assembly (whom we conceive the only means under God for our
redress) beseeching you to endeavor to these ruinating distractions, and
though the present calamities does not so immediately reflect on your
Petitioners, yet we considering the loss of so many of our fellows lives,
and the daily hazard the rest are exposed to, and foreseeing the face of our
own ruin, in our Masters present condition, as also prizing our Parents and
friends lives and livelyhoods, as dear as our own: hold our selves engaged by
the laws of conscience and nature, to be no less solicitous for the bleeding
miseries of our Church and State, in regard (though servants) we are Subjects,
and humbly conceive our selves to be considered herein.

We come therefore (in the still voice) to imbowell our grievances and zealous
desires before you, not presuming to dictate to your graver judgments, but
humbly desiring you to pardon our boldness in petitioning; and the errors of
our Petition, if any be. We unanimously beseech you to consider these present
distractions, the continual increasing violation of our Religion by Papists
and Sectaries, the breach of our known Laws, the invasion of the Subjects
liberties, and general decay of Trade, reflecting also with serious thoughts
upon those inevitable dangers, that hover over our heads, ushered in by a
civil, unnatural, and bloody War, whose effects are the impartial
destruction of christians, the effusion of much innocent blood, the
impoverishing and dispeopling the Kingdom, and exposing the body of the State,
to the merciless tyrany of Famine, Sickness, and Invasion, the producers of
an universal confusion.

All which (better known to your apprehensions) we humbly desire you to
ponder, and leave no just way unattempted, which may conduce to the settlement
of these differences, that the undiscerning sword be not umpire to discide
controversies of so near concernment, neither give audience to the
incendiaries of this War, whose only aim (we fear) is to prey upon the
lives and livings of his Majesty's good and loyal subjects, that so the
gospel of peace may not be maintained by War, but that these cemented joints
of the Church may hold firmer the bond of unity, to the glory of God, the good
of his Majesty, the preservation of the Parliament, the only happiness of the
Kingdom, and inablement for a supply of the necessities of our distressed
brethren in IRELAND: and your petitioners shall daily pray, as in all duty
bound, for a blessing upon your consultations; to which we subscribe our hands
and hearts, each ready to sacrifice his life for accomplishment hereof.

Subscribed with, at the least 20000. hands.
