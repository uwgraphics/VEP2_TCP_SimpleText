To the Flock of God committed to my charge in the Parish of Lin Alhallows;
Grace, Mercy and Peace in the knowledge of JESUS CHRIST.
Worshipful, Worthy and beloved;
SInce God has called me by his providence to be over you in his Word, it is
my desire and care to be useful to you therein: an instrument of the happiness
both of you and yours, as knowing that God will require it at my hand, if
through my default you should miscarry. For this cause (as I would gladly serve
you in any thing that might further your good) I prepared these brief
Instructions for your families, as being a part not only of my care but of
yours also respectively; especially your children, who as parts of your selves,
ought especially to be cared for by you; and not so much how they may live in
this world and be respected of men, as how they may know and believe in Christ,
and be followers of him and his blessed doctrine, that they may live for ever
with him in the world to come. It is too common a fault (I fear too much yours,
I wish I may not say mine too) to be carefuller, how they and theirs may
correspond with and thrive in the world, then how to know and thrive in the
grace of God. Whereas the best Parents can do for their children, Eccles. 2.19,
21, 22, 23 and 5.10, 13, 14, 15, 16.
is to leave them a blessing from God; the way to which is to be godly
themselves, and teach them to know and serve him; other things are full of
vanity, and we see often turn to their hurt and ruin, that main thing being
neglected by them, Mat. 6.33.
whereas if God and his grace be first and chiefly looked after, even those
other things also so far as shall be good and needful shall be added to them.

To further you in that one needful thing, I took this pains though in much
weakness of body, as briefly and plainly, as in such a piece I could to set
before you the main points of Christian truth necessary to be known and
practiced both by them and you: In which I have chosen rather to steer my
course by the Scriptures, then by the traditions and opinions of men, as
knowing that in Gods matters, its safest walking by the rule of his own word,
and not by the Votes of fallible men, who are then aptest to miscarry when they
are great in their own eyes, 1 Isa. 39.13.
and cried up as masters of the Faith by others. They whose fear to God is
taught by the precepts of men worship him in vain. Its a main part of our duty
toward him, to cleave perfectly to his word, and prefer the authority of his
single saying, before the conceptions of a whole world of men: Though yet they
are neither few nor despicable, nor of yesterday, that are of like
apprehensions with me, about the Universality of the Grace and love of God, and
of the extent of the Death of Christ, in which some over zealous for their own
mistakes possibly will dislike me. Men of more moderate spirits and sounder
learning both here in England and beyond Seas (witness Mr. Baxter here, and
Dr. Amirald in France and others) begin to see and say more: for the grace of
God in its extent then some by over hot running into extremes have formerly
been willing to own; and I doubt not but the truth of God in those points will
daily get ground, though not without its usual oppositions from men of corrupt
minds, and that are destitute thereof. What I herein have offered, I have
drawn out of the wels of Salvation, and doubt not but is wholesome, and may look
its worst Adversaries in the face. And therefore I am bold to commend it to
you, and should be glad to see you so accept it, as to call upon your Children
and Servants to mind and learn them: which would also add encouragement to me
to serve you in the Lord in what else I may. However, I have herein discharged
part of my duty, and shall leave this as a Witness of my Love to you; and
desire of the good of you and yours: which possibly may be of use to some when
I shall cease to be.

Dearly beloved, fare ye well in the Lord, and see (I yet beseech you and
request of you in his Name) that you make it your business to know and live to
him, as you will answer that great Shepherd, and most faithful Bishop of your
Souls, at his appearing. To his grace and gracious custody, commending you all
with my self and my endeavors; I remain,

Your Servant in the Gospel for Jesus sake. JOHN HORN.

Brief Instructions for CHILDREN.
Question 1.

WHat is the chief thing thou ought to exercise thy self to in thy youth?

Ans. To remember, mind, or consider my Creators The word is (...) of the
plural number in Eccl. 12.1 Ps. 100.2, 3
.

Q. 2. Who created thee?

A. God.

Q. 3. What is God?

A. An eternal 1 Timothy 1.17
, infinite Ps. 145.3.
, and infinitely 1 Kin. 8.27
wise, powerful Genesis 17.1
, holy Isa. 6 3.
and good Ps 119.86
Spirit Joh. 4.24.
, who Is. 41.4, and 43.10.
has his being of himself, and To 11.36 1 Cor. 8.4, 5 1 John 5 7 1 Genesis 1.26
27. 1 John 5.7 Mat. 28.19 20.
gives being to all things else.

Q. 4. How many Gods are there?

A. No more but one.

Q. 5. Why said thou then, to remember thy Creators?

A: Because there is a Trinity in that one God, who concurred in creating me.

Q. 6. How is that Trinity called?

A. The Father, the Word or Son, and the Holy Ghost.

Q. 7. How may it be evidenced that there is a God, and that he made thee?

A. Both by the testimonies of the Scripture, and by sound reason: for seeing
in all things successively produced by, Ps. 100.2, 3 Job 10.8, 9, 10. Is. 46.8
or begotten of one another, there must be some first of that kind, it follows
that there must needs have been some first of mankind, who since they could
not make themselves, nor be made by chance, or any other creature; it follows
that they were made by some infinitely wise power, which is God.

Q. 8. What should thou remember, mind, or consider in God?

A. His Power, Wisdom, and Goodness, Ps. 66.3.5, and 104.1.24. Zach. 9.17.
Romans 12.2.
exercised for and about me, his holy will concerning me, and end to which he
made me.

Q. 9. To what end did God make thee?

A. To seek and serve him, Act. 17.27. Is, 43.7.21
that so he might be glorified in and by me, and bring me to glory.

Q. 10. Why art thou to remember God in thy youth?

A. First, Because having all my time and being from him, Romans 11.36 Deuteronomy. 6.5,
6
he is to be glorified with it all to my ability.

Secondly, Because being freer in youth from other principles, Pro. 22.6. Isa.
28.9.
what we then mind is apt to make the greater impression in us, and stick the
longer by us; Ma.. 18.3, 4 5, 6, 7.
And therefore God would not have that age devoted to sin and Satan but to
himself who made us.

Thirdly, Job 14.2. 2 King. 2.23 24 Ephesians. 6.1.2, 3.
Its uncertain, whether I shall live to age: for many are taken away before,
and many of them for mispending their youth.

Fourthly, Because if one live to age, yet then worldly employments, Isa. 28.9,
10 Eccles. 12.1, 2, 3. Jer. 13.23.
bodily infirmities, or evil principles formerly drunk in, usually makes a man
less apt to this remembrance.

Q. 11. But may thou not delay it a little longer?

A. No, for first, the sooner the better: For if Satan get into my heart now,
Jer. 13.23.
I shall be less apt afterward hereto. Secondly, The present time is only
ours: Ja. 4.13, 14.
I cannot promise my self life till the morrow; and if I die in a neglect of
God, Heb. 2.3.
I am in danger to perish for ever.

Q. 12. What engagement have thou upon thee to this remembrance?

A. Very great both more general as one of mankind, and more especially as
called to be a Christian.

Q. 13. What be those more general engagements?

A. First, in respect of God; his goodness to me in giving and upholding to me
such a being ingages me to it, Romans 1.21. 2 Cor. 5.14, 15.
that I might be thankful and live to him. Secondly, in respect of my self:
for seeing he is my Creator, my being and my well being depends upon him and
his favor, Eccl. 12.1.12, 13, 14. Amos 3.3. Genesis 17.1. 2 These. 1.7, 8, 9, 10.
which cannot be enjoyed by me, in a neglect of him and his will, but in a
mindful remembrance of and obedience to them.

Q. 14. What is thy more spe^iall engagement as called to be a Christian?

A. Therein I am called (and by approving my Baptism into Christ do bind my
self) to these three things. First, to forsake the Devil and all his works,
Ephesians. 2.2, 3. and 4.17, 18, 19. Tit. 2, 11, 12. Act 19.3, 4 07 Gal. 3.26, 27.
Mat. 28.19. Romans 6.1, 2 3, 4, 5, 6.12 13.19.
the pomps and vanities of this wicked world, and all the sinful lusts of the
flesh. Secondly, To believe all the Articles of the Christian Faith. Thirdly,
To keep Gods holy Will and Commandments, and walk in the same all the days of
my life: which cannot be done without remembering my Creators.

Q. 15. Declare these things in order; and first to the first of them: What
meanest thou by the Devil?

A. The Devil is a wicked spirit, who being created in a glorious estate, Mat.
13.19.39. Ephesians. 2.3. Jude 6.
wilfully and proudly rebelled against God, and is become an enemy to him, and
to all goodness.

Q. 16. What be the works of the Devil?

A. All such ways, arts, and inventions as he has devised and set on foot for
drawing men to forget and sin against God. 1 John, 3.8, 10. and Joh. 8.44.


Q. 17. Are any so foolish to follow him and his works?

A. Yes verily, he has drawn many Angels into Rebellion with himself, Mat.
25.41 Jud. 6. Ephesians. 2.2, 3. 2 Cor. 4.4.
and the greatest part of men walk after him, even all that disobey Gods word:
Whence he is called the God of the world, and the spirit that works in the
children of disobedience.

Q. 18. What call thou the pompes and vanities of this wicked world?

A. All those vain shows, Plays and Pageants, that the world delight in: Tit.
2.12: 1 Cor. 10.7. Ephesians. 4 17, 18. ^ Pet. 4.3, 4. 1 Pet. 1.18, 19.
By which they are drawn from God and his word, and their 06 manners are
corrupted: as also the pride and glory of this world, and all its vain ways
and customs that agree not with the word of God.

Q. 19. What meanest thou by the sinful lusts of the flesh?

A. All the desires and longings of the vain mind and flesh, Gal. 5, 17, 18,
19, 20. Ephesians. 2.2. and 4.17, 18, 19, 20.
contrary to the word of God; as to gluttony, drunkenesse, uncleanness, pride,
revenge, covetousness and the like.

Q. 20. How may thou be strengthened to forsake these things?

A. By taking heed to the word of God, Ps. 119.9, 11
and so believing the Articles of the Christian Faith.

Q. 21. What call thou the Articles of the Christian Faith?

A. The principles of the Word or Gopel of God, Heb. 6.1.
as those contained in that called The Apostles Creed.

Q. 22. Rehearse that Creed?

A. I believe in God, etc.

Q. 23. Into what principles may those Articles be reduced?

A. Into these six: First, That Almighty God the Maker and Governor of all
things, made man in a very happy estate. Secondly, That man continued not in
that happiness, but sinned and fell into exceeding misery with all his
posterity. Thirdly, That God has provided a full and perfect remedy for fallen
mankind in his Son Jesus Christ. Fourthly, That the way to enjoy that remedy
is faith in him. Fifthly, That God affords men means and helps for their
believing and abiding in Faith. Sixthly, That they who believe shall have
eternal bless, and the unbeliever everlasting misery.

Principle I.
Q. 24. Declare these things in order more fully, and first, a little further
about the Creation, what is it to create?

A. To make or give being to a thing of nothing, Heb. 11.3.
either immediately, or mediately.

Q. 25. What did God create besides thee?

A. The Heavens, Earth and Seas, with all things in them visible and invisible.
Exo. 20.11 Col. 1.16.


Q. 26. Wherefore did God create all these things?

A. For the manifestation of his own glory, and for the good of the creature,
Rev. 4.11. Romans 11.36 Genesis 1.27
especially, of man.

Q. 27. In what space did he make them?

A. In six Days.

Q. 28. What did and does God ever since? Exodus 20.11


A. Exercise his Providence in the preservation and Government of the world and
every thing therein, Joh. 5.17. Mat. 10.29, 30. Ephesians. 1.11. Ps. 103.19.
according to the counsel of his own blessed will.

Q. 29. Wherein did Gods goodness to man appear in the Creation?

A. In that he made him of so base matter such an excellent creature, Ps. 8.3,
4, 5. and 144.3, 4.
and provided so bountifully for him.

Q. 30. What did God make man off?

A. He made his body of the dust of the earth, Genesis 2.7.3.19. Eccles. 12.7
but his soul was more immediately of the breath of God.

Q. 31. Wherein was he made such an excellent creature?

A. In that God made him in his own image and likeness, Genesis 1.26, 27, and 3.8
10.
capable of fellowship with himself and of everlasting happiness.

Q 32. Wherein consisted that image of God? Job 38.36. Eccles. 7.24. Psa. 8.4,
5. Ep. 4.22, 23.


A. In his excellent mind, understanding, freedom of will, integrity of heart,
and dominion over the other creatures.

Q. 33. What was that bountiful provision God made for him?

A. God made the whole world for his use and service: Psalm 8.5, 6. Genesis 2.8, 9,
with 3.22 and 2, 3.16, 17, 18.
A pleasant Garden or Paradise for delight, the Tree of Life to render him
immortal, a Sabboath for his rest, and more full communion with God; a wife
for a meet help: denying him nothing for his good; only forbad him to eat of
one Tree, called the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil.

Q. 34. Why was it called the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil?

A. Because God therein tried man, whether he would do good or evil; and man
had therein a distinction of good and evil.

Q 35. Why did God forbid him that Tree?

A. Surely, Genesis 2, 9.17
1. To reserve to himself an acknowledgement of his sovereignty over man. 2.
That man might have a trial of and an occasion to testify his love and
obedience to God. 3. To instruct man to be content with such knowledge as he
vouch-safed him in obeying his Word.


Q. 36. How long did man continue in this good condition?

A. A very little while, and as some think not one night Genesis 3.1. The word in
Psalm. 49.12. signifies he tarried not a night.


Principle II.
Q. 37. How did he fall from it?

A. By sinning against God his Maker.

Q. 38. What is sin? Romans 3.23


A. Any breach of the Law or command of God, 1 John 3 4. Genesis 6.4
in thought, word or deed.

Q. 39. Wherein did man first sin?

A. In eating of the Tree forbidden him. Genesis 3.6.


Q. 40. How came he to eat thereof?

A. Not through any necessity or defect on Gods part, Eccle. 7.29 Ja. 1.12, 13
but merely by his own willing listening to the tempter enticing him.

Q. 41. Who tempted him?

A. Satan in the shape and body of a Serpent. Rev. 20.1. Genesis 3.1.


Q. 42. How did he entice him?

A. By persuading the woman, Genesis 3.2, 3, 4, 5, 6. 2 Cor. 10.3
and by her the man, that there was such singular virtue in that fruit as would
make them like God.

Q. 43. Why did God suffer him to be so tempted?

A. To try and exercise his Faith, Jam. 1.3, 4.
Love and obedience to him.

Q. 44. What followed upon his sinning?

A. Guilt and misery unspeakable to himself and all his posterity, Romans 3.23,
and 5.12.18, 19.
to death and condemnation.

Q. 45. Was the eating of a fruit contrary to Gods command so great an offense,
as to deserve such a punishment?

A. Yes, surely, because he rejected God most evilly and unthankfully therein,
Genesis 3. Romans 5.19
and preferred a creature before him, who had done so graciously for him.

Q. 46. But how could his sin hurt his posterity?

A. Because we were all in him, as in our root, Romans 5.12. 1 Cor 15.21 22. Heb.
7, 9, 10.
and he as a public person had us and our privileges all in his hand and
keeping.

Q. 47. What was the misery and death befell him and us in him?

A. It was partly privative in the loss of what we had: and partly positive in
the bearing such evils as we should not else have had.

Q. 48. What did he deprive himself and us of?

A. 1. That righteous account we had with God, Romans 5.19.
we being hereby made sinners. Romans 3.23 Ep. 2.1, 2, 3
2. The image and glory of God, we being hereby become dead in sins and
trespasses. 3. Fellowship with God, 2 Samuel 14.14.
with all the joy and happiness thereof, we being hereby banished from his
presence. Genesis 3.22* 23.
4. Paradise and its delights, with the good of all other things given us.


Q. 49. What was the positive part of that misery? Romans 5.19. Ps. 14.1, 2, 3


A. 1. An universal pollution of all our powers, with original corruption,
apting us to innumerable actual sins, and making us altogether corrupt and
loathsome. Ephesians. 2.3. 1 Cor. 12.1, 2. Genesis 2.17 Ephesians. 2, 3 Romans 5.18.
2. A woeful thraldom to Satan and his suggestions and abuses. 3. A fearfully
ablenes to the wrath of God and his vengeance to be inflicted upon us in souls
and bodies forever.


Q. 50. Could not man help himself from under this misery?

A. No, 2 Samuel 1414 Mic. 6.6, 7.
nor from any part thereof, nor all the creatures beside to help him.

Q. 51. Why so?

A. Because such is the infinite purity of Gods nature, Hab. 1.13. Ps. 5.4, 5
Gal. 3.10 and 2.21. Psalm. 90.11 Nah. 1 6. Romans 8.3. Is. 40.15, 16, 17, 18.
and such his hatred to sin, and the strictness of the law binding us over to
death, that no release of us without satisfaction: But such is the power of his
wrath, so weak and evil is man, and so finite all other creatures, that
neither we nor they could satisfy.

Principle III.
Q. 52. Is there no escape then from this misery?

A. Yes, The same God that created us at the first, Is. 50.3. Luc. 1.37, 38. 2 Samuel 14, 14.
had Love, Power, and Wisdom enough to help us; and has devised and provided
help for us.

Q. 53. What help has he provided for us?

A. He has sent his only begotten Son into the world, Joh. 3.16. Mat. 22.4.
that through him the world might be saved, and accomplished all things in him
needful thereunto?

Q. 54. Who is that Son of God?

A. Jesus of Nazareth, who was bornat Bethlehem in the days of Augustus Caesar,
and crucified without the gate, Jo. 9.35, 37 Lu. 2 1, 2, 3 and 3.1. with Heb.
13.12
at Jerusalem in the days of Tiberius.

Q. 55. What things were needful to be accomplished in by him that he might
save us?

A. It was needful. First, Gal. 3.10, 13. Romans 5.15, 16, 17, 18. Heb. 5.9. and
9.15.
That he should ransom us from under the sentence and curse of the law upon us.
Secondly that he should purchase and obtain for us righteousness and life, with
power to dispense them to us.

Q. 56. How could he be able to do these things for us?

A. Yes, Such was his Person, Ps. 89.12, 20.
and such his Offices and furniture for them as fitted him hereunto.

Q. 57. What manner of Person is he?

A. Very-God and very-man in one destinct public person. John 11. 1 Timothy 2.5


Q. 58. What meanest thou by very-God? John 1.1 Phil 2.6. Mic 5.2. Prove 8.22.
Jer. 23 5, 6. Rev. 1.17, 18 Col 1.16 17 Heb. 3.3 4.


A. That he is verily and essentially God begotten of the Father by an eternal
generation.

Q. 59. How does that appear.

A. Both in that the Names proper to God (as Jehovah the first and last,) and
in that the works of God are ascribed to him.

Q. 60. How does it appear that he is very man?

A. By his birth, Lu. 2.7. 52 Heb. 4.15. Joh. 4.6, 7. Luc. 23.46.
growth, infirmities, sufferings and death.

Q. 61. How could he then be without sin and fit to mediate for us, seeing the
whole nature of man is corrupted with sin?

A. Yes, because he was not propogated after the ordinary way of man, Heb.
4.15. 1 Pet. 18, 19 Lu. 1.27^3^ John 1.15.
but was made flesh by a work of new creation, in which he was unconceeivably
conceived of the Holy Ghost in the womb of a Virgin, and by him marvailously
sanctified in his conception.

Q. 62. Why say thou he is one?

A. To signify that the two natures of God and man are personally united in him
so as they are not two but one person. John 1.14. Gal. 4.4.


Q. 63. How does that appear?

A. Both in that the Scripture call him one, 1 Timothy 2.5. 1 John 3.16 Act.
20.28. Romans 9.5.
and in that the things proper to either natures are indifferently affirmed of
him.

Q. 64. Why say thou he is a distinct person?

A. To signify that he is distinct and another from the Father, and from the
spirit, and from all other men.

Q. 65 Wherein is he distinct from the Father?

A. In that he was begotten of the Father not the Father of him, John 3.16. 1 Timothy 2.5, 6. 1 John 4.9, 10. John 10.30. and 14 9, 10.
and in that he is also 06 man and suffered, not so the Father: though he is in
the Father, and the Father in him undevidedly.

Q. 66. Wherein is he distinct from the Spirit?

A. In that he was made flesh, so was not the Spirit: John 1.14. and 14.16, 17*
Isa. 11.1, 2. Joh. 3.34.
and in that he sends forth the Spirit as another comforter from himself:
though yet the Spirit is immeasurablely and inseparably on him.

Q. 67. How is he distinct from all other men?

A. In that he is not they, 1 Timothy 2.5. John 1.20. 1 Cor. 1.13. Mat. 1.23. Joh.
14.20. and 14.1, 4, 5
or any part of them, nor is any of them he; he being Godman, the Mediator and
Savior: and so is no man else, though he is spiritually in believers and they
in him.

Q 68. Why call thou him a public person?

A. Because he was to stand in the room and stead of all other men and act for
them, 1 Timothy 2.5, 6. Romans 5.14. 1 Cor. 15.45.
in which respect Adam is called his Figure, and he the second Adam.

Q. 69. How did these qualities of his person fit him for his foresaid
undertakings?

A. In that he was such a man distinct from us all, and yet in a public place
for us, Heb. 8.3 and 2.14 15, 17 18. Ps 68.18, 19, 20. and 89.19. Acts 20.28.
Ps. 67.1 and 84.11. Phil. 3.21.
he was fit to suffer and bear our sins, simpathize with us in our sorrows,
receive grace and blessing for us: And in that he is God, he was able to uphold
the manhood and carry it through all its services and suffering, and make them
valuable and communicate grace and blessing to us.

Q. 70. What are his Offices that further fit him hereto?

A. He is Priest, Heb. 5.5 Act. 3.22. Rev. 19.16
Prophet and King.

Q. 71. What is his Office as Priest?

A. To make atonement for our sins, and stand in the breach between God and us,
to keep off judgment from us, Heb. 2.17. and 9.24.
and obtain grace and blessing for us.

Q. 72. How was he to do these things?

A. By offering Sacrifice and making Intercession for us. Heb. 9.26. and 7.25.


Q. 73. What is his Office as Prophet?

A. To reveal the mind and counsel of the Father in all things to us. Deuteronomy.
18.16 17, 18.


Q. 74. How does he that?

A. Both by outward means, Heb. 2.3 Joh. 14.26. and 16.7, 8, 9 10, 11. Joh.
5.22. Ps. 47.3, 4, 5 and 44.4 Isa. 33.22. 2 Cor. 9.10.
and by inward cooperation of his spirit.

Q. 75. What is his Office as King?

A. To execute the Government of God amongst men, conquer enemies to it, call
Subjects, subdue rebels, command and effect salvations to his people, and
reward all according to their works.

Q. 76. How does he these things?

A. Both by more general providentiall concurrence with the Father in Governing
the World; Joh. 5.17. Isa. 33.22.
and by more special spiritual exercise of his power in and over his Church.

Q. 77. How was he furnished for the execution of these foresaid Offices?

A. He was furnished with the Authority, Power, and Spirit of God, Act. 10.38.
Mat. 3.16, 17, and 28.19 Act. 2.33.
with which he was more solemnly anointed in the nature of man in his entering
upon the works of them.

Q. 78. When were the foresaid Offices to be executed by him?

Ans. Partly in his humiliation and partly in his exaltation.

Q. 79. How did he execute them in his humiliation?

A. As a Prophet he preached the Gospel and furnished Disciples for further
preaching it, and confirmed it by diverse miracles. Lu. 4.18, 19 Mat. 10.1, 2
Heb. 2.3, 4 Mat. 22.1, 2 and 28.19.20. Joh. 17.18 Ps. 68.18 Joh. 16.33. Act
10.38 2 Timothy 1.10 Mat. 20.28 Joh. 17.6.9 20 Lu 13.6 7, 8, 9 and 23 34. Heb.
9.14. and 10.5.10.14.
As a King, he began to set up the Kingdom of God more clearly, called in
Subjects to it, gave forth laws for it, appointed Officers for administering in
it, fought with and subdued Sin, World, and Satan, rebuked diseases and
conquered Death. As a Priest, he prepared the Sacrifice to be offered up to God
for us, and made intercession both for disciples and transgressors.

Q. 80. What was the Sacrifice he as Priest prepared and offered for us?

A. But one only propitiatory Sacrifice, which was himself, or his own body.

Q. 81. How did he prepare himself as a Sacrifice? Phil. 2.7, 8 1 Timothy 2.5, 6.


A. By giving up himself in obedience to his Father a ransom for us from sin
and death.

Q. 82. How did he that?

A. In that being made under the Law for us, Gal. 4.4. and 3.13. Is. 53.5, 6.10.
he yielded himself to death, to bear the curse of it due to us.

Q. 83. What manner of death dyed he?

A. The most accursed shameful death of the Cross, Phil. 2.8. Gal. 3.13. John
19.13 16. Mat. 26 38. and 27.46. Luc. 22 41, 42, 43.
to which he was unjustly adjudged by the Magistrate as a public Offender;
besides the feeling of most bitter Agonies in his Soul pressing him to death.

Q. 84. How was it manifest that he was indeed dead?

A. Both by a Soldiers peircing his side with a sp^ear, Joh. 19.34.42. Mat. 12
40. p ^ 4.8, 9, 10.
so as there came forth water and blood: and by his being part of the three
days and three nights in the earth to sanctify the grave to us and redeem us
from it.

Q. 85. Wherein consists the virtue of his death?

A. In satisfaction to the law and justice of God thereby made; Isa. 42.21.
Heb. 9.12. Phil. 2.10, 11.
and in the merit of further grace and power by it.

Q. 86. How does it appear that the law and justice of God was hereby satisfied
for us?

A In that he raised him up ag^in the third day, 1 Cor. 15.3, 4 17 Isa. 57 8.
Ephesians. 2, 17
therein taking him from prison and judgment: and in that he hereupon proclaims
peace and pardon to us.

Q. 87. For whom was his death a satisfactory ransom?

A. For all men, none excepted. Tim. 2.6


Q 88. How does that appear?

A. By the Scriptures plainly telling us that he died and gave himself a
ransom for All; and tasted death for every one, 2 Cor. 5.14, 15. Heb. 2.9. 1 Timothy 2.6. To. 5.18 1 Timothy 4.10 Ps. 145 9. Mar. 16.16 Act. 13.37, 38, 39, 40, 41.
etc. And by Gods dealing with all, contrary to the defect of their sin and
sinfulnes, and holding forth pardon and peace to all in the Gospel without
requiring any new satisfaction of them.

Q 89. Shall not all men then be eternally saved?

A. No sure, the most go yet to destruction.

Q. 90. What shall they perish for?

A. For sinning against the light and grace extend^d by Christ to them, John
3.19: Prove 1.24, 25. 2 Thessalonians. 2.10, 11, 12 John 5.40.
and refusing to be saved by him.

Q 91. Has not his death ransomed men from those sins too?

A. Properly not, so as to make the forgivenes of them due to all he dyed for:
2 Cor. 5.14, 15. Romans 5.12 18. Act. 13.37, 38, 39, 40, 41. Mat. 18.23, 26,
27.31, 32, 33, 34, 35.
For to ransom, being to free from some forecontracted bondage, the death of
Christ cannot properly be said to ransom men from the bondage they after bring
upon themselves, by sinning against him and his ransom; but only from what he
found men under by Adams sinning, and their sin as necessarily springing
therefrom as considered before and without his interposing.

Q. 92. Must all they then that sin against his ^diation and the light afforded
by him perish?

A. All that persist finally so to sin shall: Psalm. 68.21 Pro. 1.22, 23, 24.
Ezekiel. 18.22. and 23, 16 Act. 13.39
but not all that at any time sin such sins: for he can forgive them also, and
does to them that repent of them.

Q. 93. How can that be?

A. Very well, because of the superabundant worth and merit of his death above
the demerit of Adams sin, Romans 5.15, 16, 17.
and of all the sin he thereby found upon us, and because of the power he has
thereby obtained.

Q. 94. What did he thereby further merit and obtain?

A. Absolute Lordship over men, in the nature of man, Romans 14.9 Phil. 2 9, 10,
11 Ps. 68.18 19, 20 Rev. 3 7 Is. 42.6, 7.19, 20, 21. Heb. 9.15.
and so power to forbear, and exercise goodness toward sinful men (even such
as sin against his grace also) as he pleases: and a Law or Covenant of Grace to
be made and ratified with men through his blood.

Q. 95. What is the tenor of that Law or Covenant of Grace?

A. That whoever repent of their sins and believe in and obey him, Mar. 16.15
Isa. 55.2, 3, 4.7. Eze. 33.16 Act. 13.37, 38, 39, 40, 41.
shall be forgiven and saved from all their sins, and be made partakers of
eternal life by him; and they only that finally reject him shall perish
therefore in their sin.

Q. 96. When did he receive the foresaid power of Lordship?

A. He most fully received it in the nature of man, Ps. 68.18. with Acts 2 33,
36. Ephesians. 4.8, 9.
when he entered upon the most full and glorious execution of his foresaid
Offices in and from heaven, namely in his exaltation or Ascension.

Q. 97. How does he more fully exercise his Priestly Office in Heaven?

A. He in his Ascension thither offered and presented himself as the prepared
Sacrifice to his Father, Heb. 8.1, 4 and 9.14. Ps. 110.1.4 Lev. 8.9 with Heb.
7.27. and 9.12.14. and 7.25
and was thereby consecrated the great High Priest, and as the great High
Priest appears within the vail, even in the presence of God, and makes
Intercession for us.

Q. 98. What is his making Intercession?

A. The presenting to and improving with God the virtues of his Sacrifice, Is.
53.12. Luc. 13.7, 8 Joh. 17.6.20, 21, 22, 23, 24. Heb. 7.25, and 8.10, 11 12,
and 9.15
and his will or desire hereupon for such forbearance and goodness toward
sinners as he pleases, and that forgiveness, special favor and blessing may be
vouchsafed to them, that believe according to the Covenant.

Q. 99. Whom does he exercise his Priestly Office in Heaven for?

A. He is hereby the propitiation for the sins of the whole world, 1 John 2.2
Ps. 145.9.17. Rev. 22 17. Is. 55.1, 2.6, 7. Heb. 2.17. and 10.14.
rendering God good to all, and ready to accept all or any in coming to him
hereby; but the actual and perfect reconciliation he is to them only that so
come.

Q. 100. How does he more fully exercise his Prophetical Office in and from
heaven?

A. Having there fully received the fulness of Spirit, Acts 2.33. Ephesians. 1.8, 9,
10, 11. and 3.5. Heb. 12.25. Joh. 14.16, 17. and 16 13, 14, 15.
he powered it forth upon his Apostles, and by them gave forth the most full and
clear discovery of his Fathers will: by which he yet speaks from heaven, and in
which by his Spirit he teaches and comforts his people, and leads them unto
life.

Q. 01. To whom is he a Prophet?

A. B^th to them that he^r him and to them that for not hearing him perish: But
they only that hear him have the choice things of Gods kingdom opened to
them, Acts 3.22, 23. Mat. 13.11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. Prove. 1.22.23, 24, 25. Ps.
25.8.12 14.
of which the rest deprive themselves by rejecting him.

Q. 102. How does he more fully exercise his Kingly Office in and from heaven?

A. Being set on the throne of Majesty he further in larges and preserves his
Church against the assaults of enemies, Heb. 1.3. Acts 2. and 4. Ps. 110.1, 2,
3, 5, 6. Romans 8.35, 36, 37. 1 Co. 15.25, 26, 55. Phil. 3.21. 2 Cor. 5.10. Ps.
47 7, 8, 9. and 28 9, 10. Rev. 1, 5. and 2.26
subduing sin and Satan in them, and will in due time raise the dead, and
judge all as they have obeyed or rebelled against him.

Q. 103. Ought all men to be subject to him as their King?

A. Yes verily, for he is King of all the earth, and all Nations even the
utmost end of all the earth are given him to rule over.

Q. 104. I perceive then that He is every way furnished for saving us, but how
could they be saved, who dyed before his suffering?

A. His death though actually suffered in the last times was virtuous from the
beginning of the world; Acts 15.11 Ps. 75.3. Pet. 3.19, 20. Joh. 8.56. and 1.4,
5 Heb. 13.8.
so as that with respect thereto, he as the eternal word exercised his power
over and goodness toward men, and they were saved or condemned as they believed
on him, or rejected him.

Q. 105. But is this all needful to thy salvation, that there is so full a
remedy provided for thee?

A. No verily, John 3.3, 5 14, 15, 16.18. and 6.51 53.
there must be as well an application of it to me, as the preparation of it for
me (as is already employed) else it will not heal and save me.

Principle IV.
Q. 106. How is this remedy to be applied?

A. By a lively Faith. Heb. 10.38


Q. 107. What is a lively Faith?

A. An hearty receipt of the word of Gods grace, as the word of God, Romans 4.17,
18, 19, 20. John 1.12.
and of Christ as tendered therein.

Q. 108. Why say thou an hearty receipt?

A. Because with the heart man believes unto righteousness, To. 10.10 Iam. 1.21,
22, 23, and 2 17, 18.
that which rests in the head is but an empty opinion and will not save us.

Q. 109. What meanest thou by a hearty receipt?

A. That it both be understood of us, Mat. 13.23. Luc. 11.28 Heb. 11.13
and embraced with inward love and affection.

Q. 110. Why say thou as the word of God?

A. Because acording to its receipt so it works If it be received but as the
word of a falliable and weak man; 1 The. 2.13 1 Cor. 2.4, 5
it works weakly begetting but opinions and empty forms; but if as God, that is
as an infallible and certain word, it works divinely and effectually.

Q. 111. What does the word so received work?

A. The hearty receipt of Christ himself as tendered and declared therein, 1
These. 1.9.10.
and (as a thing therein included) Repentance toward God.

Q. 112. How is Christ tendered in the word of God, and to be received by us.

A. He is tendered to us to be our only Lord and Savior, Acts 4.12 and 2.36.
Heb. 5.9. Acts 3.22, 23. Isa. 33 22 Mat. 10 37, 38. Joh. 14.1. Mat. 17.5. and
3.17.
our only King, Priest, and Prophet, to teach, command, and save us; and as
such a one we ought affectionately to embrace, depend on, and obey him.

Q. 113. You say Repentance toward God is encluded herein, what is that
Repentance?

A. A serious turning of the heart, and so of the whole man, from all false
hopes, and delights, Acts 14.15 1 These. 1.9, 10. Joel 2.12, 13
and ways, to the living and true God, to seek close, w^^^ depend on and serve
him in Jesus Christ his Son.

Q. 114. How can the word believed effect such things as these in the heart, is
it not a dead letter? 2 Cor. 3:6, 7, 8, 9, 18 Romans 1.16 Joh. 6.63


A. The law indeed was a killing (not a dead) letter, but the word of the
Gospel is neither; but a ministration of Spirit and life; and therefore it
produces these effects where heartily believed.

Q. 115. How does the remedy thus applied save?

A. Christ thus received brings all the fullness of grace and blessings with
him. Cant. 3.2 Joh. 1.15, 16 Ep. 1.3


Q. 116. Wherein consists that Grace and Blessing?

A. In glorious privileges and gracious operations.

Q. 117. What be those glorious privileges?

A. Justification, Reconciliation, Sanctification, Adoption, and its
consequents.

Q. 118. What is Justification?

A. The Absolution of a sinner from all his sins past, Acts 13.38, 39 Col.
1.22. 1 Cor. 6 11. Romans 4 23, 25, 25
and the making and presenting him righteous before God. So as that God deals
with him as a righteous one.

Q. 119. What is Reconciliation?

A. Reconciliation as a privilege, Romans 5.10 Col. 1.21 Ephesians. 2.12, 13, 14, 18^
is the making an enemy to become the Friend of God, to have access to him,
peace and favor with him.

Q. 120. What is Sanctification? Exodus 10.3 6. and 13.1, 2 and 28.1, 2 2 Cor.
6.16, 17, 18 and 7 1. Gal. 3.26. John 1.12.


A The separating a man from his former condition to be holy to God: set apart
for his service, and the fitting him for the same.

Q. 121. What is Adoption?

A. The making a Son of Adam and death to become a Son of God: so as tha^ God
owns him in Christ as a member o^ Christ, Heb. 12.6 Ephesians. 2.1.12 19. Romans 8.16
17. Gal. 4.5, 6. Ephesians. 1.13, 14. and 4.30
and deals with him as with a Son.

Q. 122. What follows hereupon?

A. Heireship and title to the promises and promised inheritance, with the
Spirit of the Son to seal him up to, and fit him for the same: yea the
inheritance and glory it self in due season.

Q. 123. How does Christ by his Spirit fit the believer for that inheritance?

A. By his gracious operations in him. John 14.26 and 15.13.15 Ephesians. 1.17, 18. 1
Pet. 1.6, 7 8. To. 8.28 1 Thessalonians. 4.9 Gal. 5.24. Ephesians. 4.21, 22. Romans 5.2.3. Romans
15.13 1 Pet. 1.7, 8 Romans 8.26 Ephesians. 5.18, 19. Gal. 5.22. 2 Timothy 1.7. Ephesians. 3.16,
17, 1 Pet. 4.14. 2 Cor. 3.18 1 John 3.2, 3 Phil. 3.21.


Q. 124. What be those gracious operations?

A. They be very many: as, 1. He teaches him, and makes him wise to salvation.
2. He thereby begets in him lively affections to himself, and to God in him,
and to his people for his sake. 3. He mortifies and kills sin in him. 4. He
begets in him lively hope of glory. 5. He fills him with joy and peace in
believing. 6. He apts and quickens him to prayers, praises and services of love
to God and men. 7. He strengthens him to and incourages him in all his services
and sufferings for him. 8. Yea, and in due time will fully conform and frame
him to his own likeness and image in soul and body.


Q. 125. Whence is it that a man receiving Christ receives all this grace and
blessing with him?

A. It springs both from the tenor of the Covenant of Grace made with men in
Christ, which we before mentioned: Ephesians. 1.3.4, 5.
and also from his Decrees of Election and Predestination.

Q. 126. What is Gods Decree of Election?

A. A gracious act of Gods Freewill in which before the foundations of the
world he chose (or purposed to choose) the man Jesus Christ into Unity with the
eternal Word, Isa. 42.1. 1 Pet. 2.4, 5 9, Col. 1.19 and 2.9.
and so to be his holy one, the worker out of all his pleasure and treasury of
all his blessing; Isa. 53.10, 11. Ephesians. 1.3, 4, 5. Gal. 3.7.9.26.28, 29
and in him all the seed springing out of the travail of his Soul by the gift
of God, to Holiness and Blessing with him, for the praise of his own grace.

Q. 127. What is Gods Predestination?

A. Gods free fore-appointment of Jesus Christ to glory, through sufferings, 1
Pet. 1.19, 20. Rom 8.29, 30. Ephesians. 1.5, 6.
and of his seed or people to conformity to him therein.

Q. 128. Did God elect men for their faith foreseen?

A. No verily, for no worthiness thereof, but only out of his good pleasure in
Christ, and for the praise of his grace, Ephesians. 1.5, 6. 2 These. 2.13 1 Pet. 1.2.
though yet this work it self out upon men by Sanctification of the Spirit and
belief of the truth.

Q. 129. Did not God choose men to holiness and glory in their personal
considerations?

A. We find no such thing, that he chose any either as in Adam standing or
fallen, or as in themselves considered, Ephesians. 1.4.
but only in Christ and with respect to him.

Q. 130. Does not the Apostle say that God elected Jacob to Salvation, and
rejected Esau from it before they were born or had done good or evil?

A. God did elect Jacob, and rejected Esau before they were born, but the
Apostle says, neither personally, nor to or from salvation.

Q. 131. How may we understand him then?

A. That he chose Jacob nationally (that is him and his posterity) to be
privileged with the choice means of salvation, Deuteronomy. 4.37 and 7.6, 7, 8, and
10.15 Genesis 12.3 and 18, 18. and 22.18, etc. Romans 3.1 and 9.3, 4, 5
and to be honored above all nations; and rejected Esau and his posterity from
the same: yet so as Esaus, and all the families of the earth had blessing in
Jacob and his seed.

Q. 132. How may it apper that this is the Apostles meaning?

A. First, By the Oracle to Rebecca speaking of them as of two Nations, Genesis
25.23.
and two Peoples, Mal. 1.1, 2, 3
the elder should serve the younger. Secondly, by the Prophet Malachies
applying it to their posterities, Joh. 1.13
and using it as a proof of Gods loving Jacobs posterity more then Esaus: Mat.
3.8, 9
which could not be, had it been a personal Election and reprobation, with
reference to salvation, they not running in the blood. Thirdly, Mat. 3.8, 9.
The Apostle speaks about Gods casting off the Nation of the Jews, because of
their unbelief, To. 9. and 11
From being his Church and People as before notwithstanding Gods former
election of them, and cleares his justice therein. 4. The Apostle speaks not of
them as so reprobated as that it was impossible for them to be saved. Romans
10.1. and 11.11.14.23, 32.
But prayed for and endeavored that still, yea and says God did it to provoke
them to jealousy, that they might repent and be saved.

Q. 133. But says not the Apostle that God loved Jacob, and hated Esau before
they were borne.

A. No, Rom, 9.11, 12.
but that it was said to Rebecca the elder should serve the younger: the other
speech was spoken by Mallachy (long after they were dead) of the affection and
disaffection testified toward them in their posterities, Mal. 1.1, 2, 3, 4.
as laying Esaus mountains wast, etc.

Q. 134. But say not the Scriptures that God made Pharaoh to destroy him?

A. No, but that he made him stand, The original word in Exodus 9.16 signifies
to make to stand, and suits with Romans 9.22.
or raised him up (out of former judgments) and forbore him with much long
suffering when a vessel fitted for destruction to glorify his name and power
in him the more abundantly,

Q 135. How then say the Scriptures that God has power as a potter over the
clay to make of the same lump one vessel to honor and another to dishonor?

A. To show that God may do with his own what he will, Mat. 20.15. and
25.15. Ephesians 1.11. Jer. 18.6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Luc. 13.3, 4 5. Mat. 11.12 22, 23,
24 Romans 9.25, 26, 30, 31, 32. and 11.17 19, 20, 22.
honor and dishonor, how and whom he pleases, preferring one before another
in means of salvation, forbearance of them and power exercised for their good,
as in the case of Jacob and Esau and their posterities, though yet the honored
abusing their honor, may be broken off as vessels of wrath, when the
dishonored may be made vessels of mercy through faith in Jesus Christ.

Q. 136. Can a man bring himself to faith in Christ, and so to the blessings
in him?

A. No verily for faith is the gift of God, ordaining and framing the heart in
his call unto eternal life, Joh. 6.44. Ephesians. 2.8. Act. 13 48. Luc 17.5. and
22.23.
as it is his work too, to preserve and increase it.

Q. 137. Why then does God bid men believe and abide and grow in faith, and
threaten them if they do not? Romans 10.17 18, 19 Gen 63. 1 Pet. 3.19. Prove
8.33, 34, 35. Number. 14.11 Isa. 55.1, 2, 3.


A. Because God does not work it immediately, but by certain outward means to
which he gives men power to attend, and with which his spirit and power is
conversant for working and increasing it: to those means therefore he bids men
attend, and act in his power therein given forth, and faults them if they do
not.

Principle V.
Q. 138. What be those means?

A. They be those things in which God by Christ's speaks forth the knowledge of
himself and his will and goodness to men, Ps. 19. To. 10.17, 18, 19. Ps. 78.4
5, 6, 7, 8.
whether more generally and darkly, or more specially and plainly.

Q. 139. How does God speak to men more generally and darkly?

A. By his works as ordered through Christ by way of enlargement or
chastisement to us. Ps. 75.1. (...) 19.1, 2, 3. Joh. 15.24. Job 53.14, 15, 29.
Mic. 6.9.


Q. 140. They speak of God and his attributes but do they speak any thing of
Christ?

A. Distinctly they do not, but by way of interpretation they do, Like that in
Mat. 25.40.48. Ps. 75.1, 2, 3, and ^8 18, 19, 20 Act 14.15, 17.
while they manifest that goodness of God which could not have been to us but
for Christ, so that as the death of men speak Adams sin, so they speak
Christ's mediation.

Q. 141. How does Gods speaking in them conduce to faith?

A. In evidencing what is to be known of God to men, Romans 1.18, 19, 20. Acts
14.17. and 17 26, 27. Job 5, 8, 9, 10, and 33.14.19, 20.29.
they are means of provoking men to seek him, repent of their evils against
him, and to commit themselves to him, and so to dispose the heart to receive
what clearer revelations of himself he may any way afford them, Ps. 107.43.
Romans 2.4, 5 Hos. 11.3, 4 Mic. 6.9.
and where the clearer means are afforded, they tend to allure and nurture men
to mind them.

Q. 142. But can we find that God ever accepted of any faith acted toward him
by any short of the distinct knowledge of Christ?

A. Yes sure, both Rahab, Naaman, the Ninevites, Josh. 2.9, 10 with Jam. 2 25.
Jonas 3. Mat. 12.41. Act. 10.34, 35. Romans 2.26, 27.
and diverse others. God being no respecter of persons but through the mediation
of Christ accepting every one in any Nation, that by what means he affords
them do fear him and work righteousness.

Q. 143. What need then of any clearer means?

A. Yes great need, for helping the weakness and correcting the wickedness of
men, Joh. 1.4, 5, 9.6, 7, 9. Romans 3.9, 10.19.21. 1 Cor. 1.21. Ephesians. 3.9, 10. and
1.9, 11, 12. Isa. 61.1, 2, 3, 4.
whom generally comprehended not the light shining in darkness, nor by their
wisdom found out God in the wisdom of God, and what they discerned they
impreson'd in unrighteousnes; as also that God might have the glory of his
grace in Christ ascribed to him, and men the comfort of it.

Q. 144. What does God speak more clearly by?

A. By his word or Oracles, and the ordinances therein enjoined to and held
forth in his Church. Prove. 8.33, 34.

fellowship, in all or any ages and places, Josh. 24.2, 3, 4. Exodus 19.4, 5, 6.

and gathered into the acknowledgment and worship of God according to his
appointment.

Q. 146. Has there been always a Church of God in the world?

A. Yes in all ages, 1 Kin. 19.10 Jer. 2.2, 3, 5 13.

Q. 151. How may it appear that the Scriptures are the word or Oracles of God.

1. A. 1. By the consent and tradition of the Church, 2 Pet. 1.21 Mat. 11.25. 1
Cor. 1. v. 28. Heb. 2.3, 4. Psalm. 78. Josh 23.14. 1 Kin. 8.24.
The constant assertion of those holy men (who were plain hearted simple men)
that delivered them together with the miracles wrought by them, and evident
fulfilling of things they foretold, commended their sayings and writings to the
Faith of the first receivers, and they have successively commended them to us,
and that deserves our reverence of them. 2. The power of Gods Spirit breathing
in them gives such light to the simple that mind them, 2. By the power and
evidence of Gods Spirit, speaking in them: Psalm. 19. v. 7. 2 Cor. 4.2. and 5.12.
as commends them for Gods words to their consciences. 3. The evident
fulfilling of many prophecies altogether unlikely when uttered by them (such as
the calling us Gentiles, 3. By the manifest fulfilling of their prophesies in
things most unlikely, Genesis 9.27. Deuteronomy. 32.21. Isa. 55.5 Luc. 19 43, 44. Mat. 21
42, 43. and 22.7, 8, 9.
and bringing us from our Idolatries, to the worship of God, the casting off
the Jews, and many others) are a more outward sensible demonstration, that they
are of God. 4. By the strain and tendency of them which is altogether holy,
Eccles. 12.12, 13, 14. 2 Cor. 6.16, 17, 18, and 7.
exalting God, and leading men to God, and to holiness in their hearts and
ways.

with all ignorance and distrustfulnes of God, his power, faithfulness and
goodness; neglect of or want of delight in him; his words, worship and ways;
swearing by faith, truth, or any thing besides him, with all preferring of our
profits, pleasures, lives or any thing before his glory and our service to him.

Doctrine and ordinances as becomes them.

perjuries, rash swearing by it and the like; with all profaneness and formal

so as to endeavor their good as our own from our hearts in their dignity,

life, chastity, goods and good name, as we have occasion thereto.

Q. 170. What is forbidden in them?

A. As all neglect or unsober abuse of our selves, so also all undutifulnes to
superiors; all hatred, Tit 2.11, 12 To. 13.1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Gal. 5.19, 20,
21. Rom, 7.7.
envy, rash-anger, fraud, or whatever else in thought, word, gesture, or
action, tends to the prejudice of our Neighbor in their dignity, life,
chastity, goods, or good name; though but in the most secret motion and desire
of the hearts.

Q. 171. Why did God give this moral law?

A. To discover our sin and cursednes, Romans 3.20. and 5.20. and 7.7. Gal.

A. The law of statutes, Exo. ^1 and (...). Lev. 29. and 21, 22, Deuteronomy. 19. and
21, and 22.
and ordinances for the commonwealth of the Jews, with the penalties to be
inflicted by them on offenders.

Q. 175. Does the law yet continue in its force?

A. Not so to us as to the Jews before Christ's coming, for the ceremonies are
ended in Christ as their body or substance: Romans 6.14. and 10.4. Gal. 3, 25.
and 4.4.7. Col. 2.15, 16 1 Timothy 1.5, 6, 7.
yet the moral (and the other laws) are of force so far as they are taken up
of Christ, and held forth to us in his Doctrine who is the end of the law for
righteousness to every one that believes.

Q 176 Is not the law abrogatod then by Christ?

A. No verily, Romans 3.31 1 Timothy 1.7
but it and its lawful use is established by him.

Q. 177. Wherein is it established by Christ?

A. 1. In that he has fulfilled the truth shadowed out by it. Col 2.16, 17.
Heb. 10 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 Gal. 3.10, 13, and 2.21. Romans 7.12. with 8.3. Romans 13.9,
Gal. 5.14. Tit. 2.11, 12. Mat. 5.17, 18, etc. Romans 8.3. Gal. 5.16.18. Romans
3.20. and 7.7. Jo. 1.8.10 Romans 5.20, 21. 1 Timothy 1 8, 9, 10, 11, 15.
2. In that he has given himself to be a curse for us, to redeem us from its
curse, thereby declaring its curse to be so holy, just and firm; that no
redemption from it otherwise. 3. In showing us, that the holy frame and
affections, it required of us, are not less, but more due from us by his grace
toward us. 4. In calling us to himself, and by his Spirit opening his grace to
us, fulfilling the righteousness of the law in us.


Q. 178. What is the lawful use of the law?

A. 1. To show us, what is due from us to God and man, and what is sin, and so
to convince us that we have and do sin. 2. To show us our need of Christ and
his sacrifice, and what cause to bless God for him. 3. To show us what we may
expect to be effected by the grace of Christ in us, Ps. 81.9, 10 Romans 8.4. Jam.
2.8, 9, 10, 11. Romans 3.21. Heb. 10.1. 1 Timothy 1.9, 10, 11. 1 Timothy 1.5, 6. with 2 Timothy 3.15 16, 17. Lu. 2.10, 11 Romans 3.22. and 1.16, 17, and 10.9 15. 2 Cor.
3.7, 8 9, 10 and 5.19, 20. with Romans 5.17.20, 21
and how short we are yet of it. 4. To witness to Christ and the grace in him.
5. To curb the unrighteous and rebellious, that obey not the Gospel. 6. In a
word, it with all other scripture is profitable to exhort, instruct, rebuke and
so to direct us in the exercise of charity and of all righteousness.


Q. 172. What is the Gospel.

A. A doctrine of glad tidings to all people, discovering the love and grace of
God to the world, in giving forth his Son to be the Savior of it, and
tendering salvation to it through him; in which is revealed the Righteousness of
God unto all and upon all that believe, and with which God ministereth his holy
spirit to beget faith in men, and reconcile them to himself, that his
righteousness might come upon them unto eternal life, through Jesus Christ our
Lord.

Q. 180. Why say thou, its glad tidings to all people, Is there any
needfulnes or usefullnes of believing that extent of Gods love, as you seem to
insinuate?

A. Yes verily for seeing man's misery is so clearly and generally held forth in
the scriptures, that any man crediting them may see himself miserable, it is
very behoofeful that the remedy be as plainly and generally held forth too;
Romans 3.9, 10.19, 21, 23, 24, and 5.12.18. 2 Cor. 3.12, 13, with 4.2.4.
yea so useful is this both in respect of a man's self and his demeanor to
others, that none but Satan and men deceived by him hereabout would persuade
men otherwise.

Q. 181. How is it so behoofull in respect of a man's self?

A. First, it conduces much to his believing, Tit. 2.11, 12. and 3.3, 4, 5, 6.
Psalm. 9.10 and 36.7, 8, 9. Isa. 55.1.2, 3, 4, 5, 6 7.
for being by the undoubted word of God informed, that God has done so
graciously for all and so for him, it gives him evident ground to bless God
for it, repent of his evil, against such a God, and have good thoughts of him,
and with good hope and encouragement seek to enjoy the cure prepared by him.
2. 1 Cor. 14.8 Acts 2.37, 38, 39. Genesis 21.15, 16, 19. Joh. 12.46, 47, 48, 49.
It will afford help against such doubtings, discouragements, and temptations
to despair, which the convincement of a man's misery and ignorance of a remedy,
provided for him, exposes men unto. 3. In case a man neglect it when so plainly
set before him, his condemnation will be more just, and God more glorified
therein.

Q. 182. How is it behoofull in respect of others? 1 Timothy 2 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.


A. It will afford a man good ground to love and pray for them, till he see any
of them exclude themselves, the benefit thereof by a sinning to death in a
wilful malicious rejection of it. Mat. 3.44, 45. Ephesians. 5.1. 1 John 5.16. 2
Cor. 3.12, 13. and 4.1, 2, and 5.14 15.19. and 6.1, 2.
2. It will furnish a man to help his neighbor, while he can as plainly and
confidently set the remedy as his misery before him.

Q 183. But may not a man as well, and surely know the remedy to be for him by
his believing, well walking or the like?

A. No surely, Pro. 28.26. Jer. 17.9 and 23.25, 26, 27, 28, 29. 2 Pet. 1.19.
Tit. 3.5. Romans 3.25 and 4.24, 25 Genesis 15.6. Romans 4.17, 18. 1 John 5.10, 11 Luc.
18.9, 10, 11. 2 Cor. 10.17
For i^ the acts of a man's own deceitful heart (or any pretended revelations)
are nothing so evident a foundation of believing, as the word of God is. 2. Nor
can that be proved to be a right Gopel faith that goes before an apprehension
of Gods goodness to a man, and centers not in Christ's blood, as shed for him;
and therefore cannot be fit to evidence those things to him. 3. The act of
faith does not evidence the truth of its objects, but receives it as a thing
otherwise fore evidenced. 4. By that way many are made Pharisees, trusting in
themselves, that they are righteous and despising others. Genesis 3.13. Jude 14.
Heb. 11.7. 2 Pet. 2.5 Gal. 3.8 Act. 3.22, 23, 24 Heb 1.10 2.3, 4 2 Cor. 3.18.


Q. 184. When began the Gospel to be published?

A. In Paradise, presently upon man's fall, and so has been further opened to
and by the Patriarks and Prophets, but most fully by Christ himself and his
Apostles, and especially since his Ascension.

Q. 185. Are all the scriptures alike useful for working and preserving faith?

A. No sure, though all be useful, Romans 1.16, 17 and 10.8, 9, 10, 17. 2 Cor.
3.7, 8
yet the Gospel is properly the word of Faith, the ministration of Spirit, and
power of God to salvation to every one that believes.

Q. 186. Is faith wrought in all that have the Gospel then?

A. No, all have not faith, 2 These. 3.2. Jo. 6 44, 45 Isai. 55.2, 3
but only they that hear and learn of God, they believe, come to Christ, and
their souls shall live.

Q. 187. Why do not others believe?

A. Because they do not hear and learn of God. Joh: 8.43 and 10.26, 27.


Q. 188. Can any man hear of himself?

A. No, as the ability to hear outwardly is of Gods gift, Pro. 20.12 Romans 10.17
Joh. 5.25.
so the word outwardly heard brings to men by the gift of Gods power of more in
ward hearing and attention.

Q 189. How is it then that some hear not? Ps. 58.4, 5 Mat. 13.15 Acts 28.27
Zech. 7.11, 12, 13 Psalm. 81.10, 11, 12, 13. Rom 9.1^ and 1.24, 28 Psa. 81.11,
12 Luc. 13.25, 26. Joh. 12.39, 40. Jer. 6.29, 30


A. Because they stop their ears and harden their hearts, least they should
understand and be converted; wilfully following after Satan, for which
oftentimes God actually reprobates them.

Q. 190. What is actual Reprobation?

A. Gods giving men up to blindness, and hardness of heart, shutting the door
of life against hem, so as they cannot believe, but run themselves into
destruction.

Q. 191. What be the ordinances enjoined in the word as means of faith
especially of preserving and increasing it?

A. They be chiefly, the two Sacraments so called (namely Baptism and the
Supper of the Lord) and Prayer.

Q. 192. What is a Sacrament?

A. An holy and visible rite, Romans 4.11.
appointed of God to his Church, to signify and seal his grace in Christ to
men.

Q. 193. What is Baptism?

A. An ordinance of Christ, in which by the washing of water unto the Name of
the Father, Luc. 3.2. Mat. 28.18 19, 20. and 3 11. Act. 2.38, 39. Gal. 3.26,
27, 28.
Son and Holy Ghost, he has appointed people to be discipled to him, and
admited into his Church; therein signifying and sealing the forgiveness of
sins and access into the favor of and fellowship with God, through faith in
his Name.

Q. 194. Who are to be Baptized?

A. All that will submit to Christ, they and theirs, Mat. 28.19, 20. Act.
16.14, 31, 33.
that put him not from them.

Q. 195. What is the Lords Supper?

A. An ordinance of Christ in which when he was about to suffer, Mat. 26, 26,
27, 28. 1 Cor. 11.26, 27.
he appointed his Disciples, by the breaking and eating of one bread, and
drinking together of one cup, to remember him and his love to them.

Q. 196. Why did he appoint bread?

A To signify to us that he as made flesh for us; Joh. 6.48, 51.
is the true bread or matter of spiritual nourishment for our souls.

Q. 197. Why to break it?

A. To mind us of his being broken and crucified for us, Isa. 5 3.5. Joh. 6.5^.
that so he might manifest the love of God to us, and become meet to nourish us.

Q. 198. Why to eat it?

A. To mind us that we ought to exercise says in him as crucified for our
sins, Jo. 6.51.53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58.
and to seal to us spiritual nourishment in so doing

Q. 199. What is signified by the wine?

A. That his blood as shed for the forgiveness of our sins and sealing the new
Testament and its promises to us is drink indeed fit to refresh and cheer us.
Math. 26.28 Heb. 9.13.


Q. 200. Why did he appoint us to drink it? Joh. 6.55, 56 57, 58. Romans 3.25. 2
Cor. 1.20.


A. To instruct us to exercise faith in his blood, and the promises sealed by
it, and to seal to us the consolation and performance of them in so doing.

Q. 201. Why are we to eat and drink together in this Supper?

A. To mind us that we ought as brethren that have our spiritual nourishment
and refreshing, 1 Cor. 10.16 17, Pro. 9.5 2 Cor. 11.26 27, Luc. 22.29.30.
in and from one and the same object (namely Christ crucified and the grace in
him) to love and live together in the faith of Christ, and expectation of a
joint par^icipation with Christ in his joy and glory at his coming again.

Q. 202. Why does he call the Bread his Body, and the Cup his Blood; are they
indeed turned into his natural Body and Blood?

A. No, but because he would have us mind those things signified by them, 1
Cor. 10.16 Genesis 17.11.13. and 32.30 and 33.20. Exo. 12.11. Psalm. 82.6, 7 Math.
16.18. with. Joh. 1.42.1 Cor. 11.20.21, 22, 27, 28.
more then themselves, therefore (as is usual in the Scriptures in other like
cases) he puts the Names of the things signified upon the things signifying.

Q. 203. How ought a man to come to this Supper?

A. Worthily or meetly, and to that purpose to examine himself.

Q. 204. What is that self examination?

A. The consideration of a man's own worthlesnes in himself, 1 Co. 4.7. and
6.19.20. and. 11.20, 21, 22, 23, 24. etc.
and at what a rate he is by the grace of God redeemed and called; that so he
may be quickened up to believe in Christ, and not despise his brother or eat
irreverently.

Q. 205. What is Prayer?

universally subject to, Psalm. 103.20, 21. and 67.2, 3.2 Sam. 15.25, 26. Mat.
26.39. and 16.24.
and do the will of God; so it may be submited to and done by us all on earth
denying our own wills and affections.

Q. 219 What is the fourth petition?

A: Give us this day our daily bread.

Q. 220. What be we therein directed to pray for?

A. Necessary provisions for the sustentation of us in this life. Pro. 30.8, 9


Q. 221. Why are we directed to pray, but for this day?

A. To instruct us to contentations with necessaries for the present, Mat.
6.34. Heb. 13.5, 6 1 Timothy 6.6, 7 8, 9, 10.
and to live upon God daily without covetousnes.

Q. 222. How can rich men pray thus, who have for many days aforehand?

A. Yes, Because they cannot enjoy and have blessing with what they have, Deuteronomy.
8.3. Eccles. 6.8. Ephesians. 6.1.2. Mat. 25.35.36, 37.
unless God give it every day: and because they are to pray for their poor
brethern as well as themselves.

Q. 223. What is the fifth petition?

A. Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive, etc.

Q. 224. What is herein desired?

A. The forgiveness of our sins which might provoke God to withhold his
blessings from us. Ps. 39.8. Isa. 39.2.


Q. 225. Why is it added, as we forgive, etc.

A. To instruct us to mutual love and forgivenes of injuries, Mat. 6.14, 15,
and 18.21 23.33.35.
else God will not forgive us.

A. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.

Q. 227. What is meant by temptations? Genesis 22.1. Mat. 4.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Jam. 1,
2.3.12, 13.


A. Whatsoever occasions us to be moved or enticed to sin, and especially the
inticements and solicitations themselves.

Q. 228. Are we to pray absolutely against all temptations? Mat. 26.41 Luke
22.31 32.42. Joh. 17.16. Jam. 1.2. Joh. 8.11.1 Joh. 1.9. 1 Cor. 10.12 13.


A. No, but that God would not leave us in them, but deliver us from Satan and
the evil of them, and do us good by them.

Q. 229. Why does this petition follow the former?

A. To employ that we should as well be careful to avoid sin for the future,
as desire pardon for what is past; and that we are so weak that we cannot avoid
sinning, Psalm. 73.22 23.26.
unless God keeps us from or in temptation.

Q. 230. Why is it added for thine is the kingdom, the power and glory for
ever and ever?

A. To teach us to acknowledge that it is in God, Psalm. 136.1 Chron. 29 10.11,
12, 13, 14. Ephesians 5.20.
and in him only to help us, and accomplish all these things for and in us; and
that he is to be praised in all he gives us.

231. Why is Amen added?

A. To signify the realty of our desires, Jer. 28.6. Rev. 22.20.
that these things may be so; and that we believe that God for Christ's sake
will grant them to be so.

Q. 232. Are we bound to use this form of words in praying?

A. We may use it, but are not tied to it, as to the very form of words, Acts
4.24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30.
for the Apostles did pray after the giving of this form and that by the holy
Ghost, yet used no one expression of this prayer. How be it, the things here
prayed for and manner of praying are to be the matter and language of all our
prayers. Mat 6.9. Luc. 11.2.


Q. 233. How is prayer useful for the begetting and increase of faith? 2 These
3.1.2 Psalm. 67.1.2 3, 4. Mark. 1.35.38. Luc. 17.5. and 22.32,


A. It is useful for obtainning the blessing of God with his word to those
that believe not that they may believe, and for more grace and spirit to those
that do believe.

Q. 234. Why are we to be careful for the preserving and increase of faith?

A. Because by it we stand in the grace of God and meet with his power to
keep us to salvation, of which we must needs fail, Romans 5.2, 3 and 11 20.22 1
Cor. 15.1, 2, 3. Ephesians 2.8 1 Pet. 1.5.
if we let go faith.

Q. 235. Is it possible then for a man to fall from his faith, and so from
grace after he has once believed?

A. Yes, 1 Timothy 1.19 Gal. 1.6. and 5 1, 2, 3, 4. Mat. 13.19 20, 21, 22. Joh.
15.2. Psalm. 15.1, 2 2 Pet. 1.5.10. Rev. 2.10. Heb. 11 13. and 9.27
Surely if it be not well rooted in the heart, and the heart thereby kept
single for God and fruitful in good; but where these things are, no danger of
falling.

Q. 236. How long are we to exercise Faith?

A. Unto and in death, which is appointed to men in common.

Q. 237. How is it that men die seeing Christ has dyed for them?

A. Because Christ dyed not to prevent men's dying, but their perishing in sin
and death; Ps 68.18.19 20. Romans 14 9. Rev. 1.18, 19.1 Joh. 5.10, 11, 12. Mat.
11.28, 29. Joh. 5 22.27, 28, 29. Prove. 14.32 Psalm. 22.26 Joh. 8.51.2 Cor. 4.17,
18. and 5.1.
and therefore obtained power to himself as mediator over men and over all
things, that he might tak off death, and dispose life to men upon his own
terms, and in his own time and way only.

Q. 238. Wherein is the believers condition better then another man's when he
comes to die?

A. Both in that by faith he has hope and his heart lives in death; and in
that he shall have after death a better reward.

Principle VI.
Q. 239. Is there any reward then after death?

A. Yes, Both to the believer and unbeliever.

Q. 240. 2 Cor. 5.10.
How can that be?

A. Very well, because all even they that are dead to us live to God, Luke
20.38 Act. 24.15. and 26.8.
who will also raise them up again.

Q. 241. How shall the dead be raised?

A. By the powerful voice of Christ quickening them and bringing them out of
their graves. Joh. 5.28, 29.1 These. 4.16, 17.1 Co. 15.37 38, 42, 43, 44.53,
54. Isa. 26, 19. Job 19.26, 27.


Q. 242. With what bodies shall they rise?

A. With the same that died, though not the same for condition and quality.

Q. 243. How shall they differ in condition and quality?

A. They shall not be so gross, 1 Cor. 15.42, 43, 44. Phil. 3.21.1 These. 4.16
1 Cor. 15.23 24. Rev. 20 4, 5. Rev. 20.4.13. Mat. 25.31.32.2 Cor. 5.14, 15.
Mat. 16.27. Rev. 1.7 1 These. 4.15 16, 17. Jude 1.4. 15
earthy and corruptable as they are now, but incorruptible and spiritual.

Q. 244. When shall the dead be raised.

A. They that are Christ's at his coming, and the rest afterward.

Q 245. What shall follow the Resurrection?

of his Father and of all his holy Angels.

Q. 248. What shall the believer be adjudged to?

A. He shall be adjudged to and possessed of eternal life and glory with Jesus
Christ, Mat. 25.34 Joh. 5.29.1 Cor. 2.9.1 Joh. 3.2. Isa. 64.5.
such as eye has not seen ear heard, nor can enter into the heart of man to
conceive.

Q. 249. What hints of it do the Scripture gives?

A. Many; as that they shall be fully freed from all sin, sorrow and evil,
Rev. 7.8.17; 18, and 2^.3, 4, 5, 6, 7 1 These. 4.17 2 Pet. 3.13. Rev. 1.6 with
5.10.1 Cor. 6.2. Isa 35.10. Mar. 25645, 46.2 These. 1 7, 8. Rev. 14.10; 11, and
^0 14, 15.
be ever with Christ, made like him, possess the new heaven and the new earth
in which dwells righteousness, judge the world, and be everlastingly filled with
joy and glory.

Q. 25. What shall the unbeliever be adjudged to?

A. To everlasting torment and misery in soul and body with the Devils and
his Angels with whom they here sided. Misery surpassing all expression or
conception.

and by gestures and salutations?

A. Yes verily they may and ought so to do, for so holy men of God have done
and so much is included in the commands of honoring given us by the spirit of
God; who has branded them for proudandignorant persons and fall teachers that
teach men otherwise.

Q. 268. Wherefore ought thou thus to walk in godliness, sobriety and
righteousness?

A. 1. To testifiy my thankfulness to God for his great goodness to me. 2. To
glorify God and adorn his doctrine amongst the sons of men. 3. To win in others
to God by my good example, and not offend and stumble them. 4. That sowing to
the spirit I may receive mo^e enlargement and blessing from him.


Q. 269. But ought thou not to walk in the observation of the ten
co^mandments given by Moses?

A. In walking in the truth as is expressed. I do also observe and keep them,
and the righteousness of them shall be fulfilled in me.

his goodness to my self or them, for in such cases he will have mercy on whom
he will have mercy, and whom he wills he hardens.

Q. 272. But seeing its not of him that wills, not of him that runs, what
will all this thy seeking and walking a veil thee?

though it be not of my self, as or for so willing or running, yet of him that
shows mercy and in mercy has given his son for me and called me to him, in my
so willing and running I shall find blessing; yea God will give me both grace
and glory, and withold no good thing from me.

Q. 273. How can thou be so confident, seeing many have sought after
righteousness and not attained it?

A. Yes I may be confident of Gods promises in Gods way, of which they indeed
missed, because they sought amiss. Not by faith, but as it were by the works
of the law stumbling at Christ

Q. 274. When are men guilty of so seeking?

A. When not believing Gods Testimony concerning his Name, 1 John 5.10. Isa.
66.1, 2, 3, 4. Romans 1 5. and 16.25.26. Hos. 6.6 7 Mat. 9.13 Luc. 11.42.
nature and grace in Christ to the world, and so to themselves, (which is the
prime part of the obedience of faith required of all nations) they, set upon
ways and acts of worship of their own to procure and evidence his heart to be
toward them.

Q. 275. Are any in these days guilty of such a seeking?

A. Yes alas too many; and too much in that they reject and count as heresy the
testimony of Gods love to the world, Isa. 29.9; 10 11, 12, 13. Psalm. 118.22.
and death of Christ for all, and yet are sull of devotion and zealous of their
own ways of worshipping, and for their own traditions, thinking to find out
God and his love better by them.

Q. 276. Why does not God accept such seekers?

A. Because they accept not his truth, Pro. 28.9.1 Joh. 5.10. Gal. 2.21. Romans
2.3. Isa. 66.3, 4. Luc. 16.15
but give him the ly, make void his grace too, and his sons death for the world
by their endeavors to establish their own righteousness, orders and traditions;
which in such case are in Gods fight most horrible impieties, however highly
men may esteem them.

Q. 277. What should thou be instructed to here from?

A. To be more swift to hear then to offer he sacrifices of fools, Eccles.
5.1, 2. Prove. 19.2.
who think they do well and godly, when indeed they do evil.

Q. 278. Declare this more fully to me.

A. God would have me more deligent to hear and mind his word, and therein to
learn to know him and his grace, then to multiply services and sacrifices,
without such knowledge and understanding: that so by his power and spirit
working all my works in me, I may be new created, and framed to right
affections toward him, Ephesians. 2.8, 9, 10. and 4.20 21, 22, etc.
and so to serve him in righteousness as wholly his workmanship created in
Christ Jesus to good works unto his glory. To whom be praise and dominion for
ever and ever Amen.

To God only wise and our Savior be glory and Majesty, Dominion and Power,
for ever and ever, Jude 25.
Amen.

Some Directions about Childrens getting these Instructions.
TO ease the memories of children less able. 1. I Have ordered the Answers in
some places to be part of them Printed in a smaller Charracter, what is so
printed such children may forbear, and get the other part only that is in the
ordinary Charracter. 2. Where the Answer is Epitomized as A. 151. The child
may only get the breife Answers and let the other be as explications to help
their understandings when riper. 3. Those Answers included between these two
marks the child in his first going over may omit, that the multitude of Answers
over burden not his memory, those of stronger memories (or they themselves
when perfect in the other) may get them also.
