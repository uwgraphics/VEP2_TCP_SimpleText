Articles of Treason and high Misdimeanours, committed by John Pine of
Curry-Mallet, in the County of Somerset Esquire, against the King, Kingdom,
and Parliament, Exhibited by thousands of the said County, faithful Servants,
and Sufferers, for the KING and PARLIAMENT.
THAT The said John Pine in July 1642. upon the entreaty of diverse honest
faithful Parliamentiers, took charge of above five hundred Horse and Foot,
well armed, and defirous to oppose the Commissioners of Array then at Wells; in
their way thither near Marshalls Elm, appeared sixty of the enemies horse,
with whom the said Mr. Pine desired to parley for his passage, and did above
one hour parley with two or three of them, and withdrawing from them, the said
Pine spurs up and fled first of all: whereupon the rest followed; which the
Enemy perceiving, some 12. of them came down the hill, killed one Man, wounded
many, and took diverse Prisoners; whereby the Parliament was exceedingly
dishonored, their party extremely dishartned, to the great prejudice and
damage of the Kingdom. To which we could add, his base running from
Sherborne Hill, his trembling fear of Hartfords forces in their way to Mynhead,
keeping two troops of horse for the guard of his own person in the Town of
Taunton, suffering the Enemy to pass by, which if he had but followed, the
Wars in the West, had by all probability been soon ended, which after, through
his cowardice, and treachery cost so much Blood and Ruin.

2 That in May and April 1643. The said John Pine taking to him some of his
friends of the Committee of Somerset, did promise and undertake to defend the
Western parts of that County: and thereupon, he and they did draw together,
List and Arm near six thousand men, most Horse, well-affected and stout men,
and raised great sums of money (fourteen thousand pound on one account;)
fortifyed Taunton, and Bridgwater, and had Arms, Ordnance, and Ammunition
sufficient: That contrary to the desires of the Soldiers, the earnest request
of the said Towns of Taunton, and Bridgwater, his own former promises, and the
trust the Country had reposed in him, the said Mr. Pine run away with the
Countries money before the Enemy (not half so many) came within twenty miles of
him, deserting both those Garrisons, and all those Well-affected persons, that
had engaged in arms, left the whole Country to the violence and Plunder of the
Enemy, to the exceeding damage of the Kingdom, and above five hundred
thousand pounds to that particular County, notwithstanding he had under his
command a very considerable strength, and good assurance of speedy releif, in
case the Enemy should come that way, which they never intended, till they heard
the said John Pine had basely deserted Taunton, and after that Bridgwater, both
which he cowardly left and betrayed to the Enemy.

3 That the said John Pine was the first Incendiary (that ever we heard of)
between the Kingdom of England and Scotland, as by his Speeches, Reports, and
Letters, sent from London 1644. and dispearst amongst us, will appear: and
therefore ought by our Covenant, to be brought to condign punishment: as also
for making factions and parties among the people in the County, and elsewhere

4 That the said John Pine with some of his confederates of the Committee of
Somerset, to wit Colonel Ceely, Minterne, Cliffe, Morgan, English, Trevilion,
and two or three more of mean quality; have acted in an arbitrary and
opressing way, by imposing Taxes, Leavying Money; raising and Quartering
Soldiers, fining many well-affected persons, by his and their own power and
will, without Ordinance or Order of Parliament, taking Sequestrations off at
his pleasure, from the greatest Malignants, and sequestring and imprisoning
diverse faithful men to the Parliament, without cause, to the great dishonor,
and disservice of the Parliament, and sequestered others without Articles, or
admitting them to make their just defense, or convicting them by legal proofs,
according to the Ordinance.

5 That the said John Pine has ordinarily forced men to an Oath Ex oficio, and
sworn them not to discover to any whatsoever Question shall be asked them; and
many times in concernments of meum and tuum: and usually at the Committee,
sitts alone, as a Committee himself, in his Chamber, and there makes Orders,
and then sends then to his underlings of the Committee to sign.

6 That the said John Pine has in an arbitrary way, out of mere spleen and
malice, undone many religious and well-affected persons of that County,
enriched many wicked and Malignant persons employed under him, mutinously and
seditiously by power carried and endeavored to carry Elections of Parliament
men for his favorites, and wilfully disobayed many Orders, and Ordinances of
Parliament, to the loss of the lives, and ruin of diverse persons: and when we
hoped for peace by the late Treaty, whilst it lasted, he declared in the
Country, that the Parliament should make no peace with the King, but that the
Kings life should be taken from him: And for that purpose, he and his
confederates have listed and raised diverse new forces without the authority of
Pa^liament, to alter the fundamental Laws and government of the Kingdom,
disinherit the King and his issue of the Crown, and inslave the free people of
England to Martial Law and Government, and the County to his Tyranny and
violence.

7 That the said John Pine and his confederates of the standing Committee, have
Monopolised the power of the Committee into their own hands, refusing to sit,
and adjourning the Committee, when others of the Committee have come to sit
with them: rented Sequestrations in their own, and others names, and bought
sequestered goods, at undervalues, to the great defrauding of the state:
disposed of the states moneys and goods to one another, and their agents,
contrary to the Ordinances of Parliament, to the great prejudice and loss of
the state; refused to give account of the moneys Land and Goods sequestered and
received by them, according to the Ordinances and Orders of Parliament, and by
indirect means and underhand practices, caused diverse Gentlemen of the County,
to be unduly put out of the Commission of the peace, and others of his own
confederates (less able and insufficient for such a trust) to be put into
their places; And the said John Pine has likewise contrived and fomented
diverse scandalous and seditions Petitions in the Country, and sent them up in
the Counties name, to the Commons house, to promote his own, and his
confederates designs, to murder the King, disinherit the Prince, alter the
government and laws, when as the County disclaimed, and protested against
them as impostures and forgeries. For all which Treasons, and high
misdemeanors we humbly pray, that the said John Pine and his Confederates of
the Committee, may be forthwith apprehended and brought to speedy justice, and
execution, by all true patriots to their Country and this Kingdom.

And we shall Pray.
FINIS.
