The humble Petition and information of Joseph Hunscot Stationer, to both the
Honorable Houses of Parliament now assembled, against diverse scandalous
Libels, and treasonous Pamphlets against Kingly Government, and Parliament
Proceedings; as may appear by the very Books herewith presented.
Most humbly showing:
THat your Petitioner was for a long time employed in printing those things
that were commanded to be printed by both Houses of Parliament, for their
vindication and satisfaction of the People, and was faithful therein; and upon
command of the Honorable House of Commons, did print several things for them
to be sent down into the Country, which amounted unto near forty pounds, which
your Petitioner is not yet paid for. And that notwithstanding your Petitioner
has been very forwards in all voluntary Contributions and Taxes with Moneys,
Horse and Men, having ever since the first of these unhappy differences had
three Servants and his own Son in the Service, voluntary upon his own charges
for the most part, for want of their pay, loosing thereby his Trade and
Servants, and moreover hazarded his own life in the Cause, for at the beginning
of these troubles your Petitioner went down to the Army at Coventry, from
whence returning, he had like to have been surprised by three Troops of the
Kings Horse, which were coming from Nottingham for Oxford, your Petitioner,
with some others, having used their best endeavor to escape them (they being
routed at Brackley, and some of them taken that very evening) your said
Petitioner, with seven others only in his company, fell into the hands of
fourteen of the said Troopers, who were well horsed and provided, your
Petitioner (being in this straight) with two more of his said company,
adventured to fight with them, and in a short time (through Gods blessing)
disarmed them all, and carried them prisoners to Northampton, from whence they
were sent to London, (they being the first that in that kind were brought up
to London:) And your Petitioner is confident to affirm, That had the Country
and the Officers in chief in Banbury been wise, faithful and courageous,
neither Oxford nor Banbury had been taken, as shortly after they were. That in
the mean time one John Wright, by some friends, got to be nominated Printer
for the Lords House, and one Husbands Printer for the House of Commons,
although neither of them are Printers, ( Wright being a Bookseller, and
Husbands but a Paper Stationer,) which said Husbands has since reprinted
those Copies appertaining to your Petitioner, which cost him above 100 l.
without his consent, or giving him any satisfaction. That your Petitioner
hoping that restitution would have been made to him long before this time,
desisted to make known his said grievance. Your Petitioner further shows, That
he has been put upon all services of trouble ever since in searches and
apprehending wicked and pernicious persons, that molest the State in printing
and venting most malicious, false, and traitorous Books or Libels, against both
the Honorable Houses of Parliament, not sparing the principallest men on both
Houses, taxing them by name to be Traitors, and all perjured persons that do
not put out all the Clergy of the Land, and calls and incites all people to
rise as one man to call the Parliament to question, and striking at the very
fundamental Laws of this Kingdom, crying down the Government by Kings, and
also against the Honorable House of Lords, and only to stick to the Commons of
England, and many inveterate speeches against the Nation of the Scots, as much
as in them lies, to make a breach between them and us, which God of his mercy
prevent; That your Petitioner for his reward herein is most shamefully reviled,
slandred, and reproached, by these Libellers in all their Libels, and also the
Company of Stationers are called Thieves, Robbers, setting-doggs, the Bishops
old Rogues, and the persecutors of the Saints, with diverse other base names,
and in the open streets reviled at by these Saints, Anabaptists and Sectaries,
being notorious impudent persons, as may be judged by their Writings, abusing
those that be Saints indeed, all the godly Ministers in the Kingdom, and the
Assembly of Divines at Westminster, that sit there by your Command and
Authority, although your Petitioner did never do any thing but by your Warrants
and Commands, having a Command from the Commons to search for scandalous Books,
and having found some selling them in the streets, your Petitioner particularly
examining one woman of whom she had them, she (not knowing who your Petitioner
was) confessed she had them of one Lilburne in Newgate, and her name being
demanded, with her place of abode, she refused to tell the same, but at that
instant one passing by, acquainted your Petitioner that she was one Brownes
daughter, that did ordinarily sell such Books, whereupon your Petitioner and
others repairing to his House, found great store of them, and took the said
Brownes words to meet your Petitioner and the rest at the Committee of
Examinations in the afternoon, but he failed, and kept out of the way for
half a year, (there being diverse Warrants out for him:) Your Petitioner and
the rest then went to Lilburnes Chamber to search for the said scandalous
Books, but at that time found none. But immediately after there came forth
another base Book, supposed to be made by Lilburne and his fellows,
Entitled, Englands Birthright, wherein, besides the former scandalous
passages against the King, Parliament, and Assembly, a most false, scandalous,
and felonious charge, is against your Petitioner and others, being eminent
Members of the Company, for searching the said Lilburnes House, charging them
with taking away his Linen, but your Petitioner and the rest, in regard no
body will own the said Book, are left remediless for vindicating themselves
by Law. That shortly after the Committee of Examinations being informed that
the said Brown and his daughter did frequently sell the said Books, a Warrant
issued out from them for the said Brown and his daughter to your Petitioner
and others, whereupon they repaired thither, but the said Brown was denied at
his House (being in a Garden, and having three or four several doors) but
setting a strict watch about his House, after entrance thereinto, the said
Brown was discovered and apprehended, and also diverse scandalous Books and
Pamphlets were then and there found; but the said Brown then made an escape
from the Constable, so that his daughter only was apprehended, and being
brought before Sir John Wollaston, she was committed to the Marshall, and from
thence to be carried up to the Committee of Examinations, where she being
brought, the matters charged against her for breach of the Ordinance of
Parliament was fully proved against her, and thereupon she was re-commanded to
the Marshall. That in a short time after your Petitioner casually at Doctors
Commons espied the said Brown, and having a Warrant for him, apprehended him,
and carried him before the Committee of Examinations, who thereupon was
committed to the custody of one Lewis a Messenger, and your Petitioner, with
the Master and Wardens, and others of the Chief of the Company, having waited
several days for a hearing, the said Brown (by what means your Petitioner
knows not) so prevailed, that his said contempt never came to a hearing, and
the said Brown shortly after obteyning his liberty, has threatened your
Petitioner, and the rest that were with him, to sue them for false
imprisonment, and moreover they threatened to knock out your Petitioners brains
if he came any more to search his house. The Petitioner further shows, That
being employed upon a Warrant from the Speaker of the House of Commons, for the
seizing of a Press in Goodmans Fields, which printed the Book called Englands
Birthright: That your Petitioner, with the Master and Wardens of the Company,
endeavoring to put in execution the said Warrant, they were kept out by force,
until at last the doors of the house being by authority forced open, those
that were at work got out at a window with a rope into a Garden, and so
escaped; But the said Press was seized upon, which printed that and diverse
other Books, as was at large proved before both Houses of Parliament at Larners
examination by diverse honest men; and no parties in it, as Larner in his
scandalous Libell taxes the Parliament. Not long after this, there came another
base Book out, Entitled, The last warning to London, threatening the City; they
had not long to consider if they did not comply with them, and in it enveyed
against the Scottish Nation, and by consequence labored to make the people of
the City fall out with that Army, which deserves praise for their
faithfulness, and to breed jealousies between the Army and the City, that God
has so prospered, and an endeavor to keep off Government, under pretense of
Liberty of Conscience, that so they may do what they list, and broach any
damnable opinion; and in that Book goes further, absolutely denying Kingly
Government, and the Lords, House, wishing the people to mark diligently the
Lords but to stand to the Commons, to be ruled only by them; and one of these
Books being brought to the Lord Mayor of London, he immediately sent for the
Warden, Master Miller, and your Petitioner, and desired them to find out the
Author and Venture of the said Libell, the which accordingly they endeavored,
and upon enquiry found that Larner was a chief venture of them, and repairing
to his house, found the said Larner, with a parcel of the said Books;
whereupon the said Larner was charged with a Constable, and carried before the
Lord Mayor, who found him, as the Lords did after, being Jesuited, would answer
to no question, the Lord Mayor sent him up to the Committee of Examinations,
where he was examined, and proof made against him, he was then committed to
the Marshals keeping, (there being in the Book high Treason.) In the mean
while the Honorable House of Peers sent for him, but he had learned so much of
Lilbornes Language, that he appealed to the Commons, but the said House
examined Witnesses against him ^he refusing to take the Oath, was committed.
There was also a sheet of paper published called Every man's case, or a
brotherly support to Master Larner, wherein he taxes the Parliament to deal
contrary to the Law of God, Nature, Nations, and the Law of this Kingdom, as
he says, was proved lately in Colonel Lilbornes Case, he there compares the
Lords to Pilate, charge the House of Commons for breach of trust, in
delivering up Larner to be tried by the Lords, with many other things, wherein
the liberty of the Parliament is entrenched upon by mean persons both of state
and life, and this was delivered by Larner himself to the Keeper, and thereupon
it was thought fit that the Warden of the Company and your Petitioner should
search the said Larners Chamber in the Prison, whither they repaired, and there
they found diverse written papers of his own hand writing, touching his
Examination and proceedings before the Lord Mayor, the Lords and Commons, the
which about a week after came forth in print, called, A true relation of all
the remarkable passages and illegal proceedings of some satanicall, Doeg-like
accusers of their Brethren, against William Larner a freeman of England. The
which, as the former, are very scandalous and malicious, especially against
both Houses of Parliament, and the Stationers, which said sheet is now
reprinted again with Additions of a new to Master Larner, with directions for
better satisfaction of the Natives Freedom of this Land, willing them to read
a Book called Englands Birthright, and another Book called A word to the wise,
in all which Books you may perceive the spirits of these men, if they had power
in their hands, and might live still as they do, loosely and lawless.

Therefore your Petitioner most humbly craves the liberty of a Freeman of
England, to have justice upon these scandalous persons, and some course, as in
your wisdoms, to stop unlicensed printing in corners, and the rather because
all their scandalous Libels are stuffed with disgraces of both Houses of
Parliament, and of your Petitioner and the Stationers, for executing our
Commands, Ordinances, and Warrants, your Petitioner never having one penny
thereby, and yet in their Libels they affirm him to have 500 l. a year, when as
in truth he has hitherto gone upon his own charge. And he further prays, That
some speedy course may be taken with these libellers, that he may be free from
danger of his life: And that some present order may be taken, that his moneys
so long owing to him by the Parliament for printing of Books, may be paid him,
and some satisfaction from the said Husbands, and a consideration had of his
fidelity, good service, and large expenses, for these five or six years.

And he shall ever pray, etc.

FINIS.
