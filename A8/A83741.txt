Exchange, overagainst the Conduit. 1642.

The Lord Wharton his Speech.
MY Lords, and you the Aldermen, and the Commons of this City, in a business of
this very great consequence and concernment, it was very well known to my Lo:
General, that you could not but be full of great expectations, and my Lord had
according to his duty taken care for to give information to the Parl. to those
that had sent him, of what had proceeded; in the very next place it was his
particular respect to this City, to my Lo: Mayor, the Aldermen, the Common
Council, and all the Commons of this City, that they might likewise be
acquainted with the success of that business, toward which they themselves
had bin at so much expenses, and had showed so much love and kindness in all
the proceedings of this business, for that purpose, because that Letters might
be uncertain, and might miscarry, there being great interception of them, the
Forces of the Armies being close together, my Lord thought fit to send M.
Strode, a Member of the House of Commons, and my self, and certainly
whatsoever shall be related by us to you, it will be good news, or else we
should not willingly have undertaken the bringing of it, and for the truth of
it, though we already hear that there are those that have so much malignity as
to oppose it, yet the certainty of it will clear it self, and therefore there
shall need no Apologies to be made, but that which shall be said to you, shall be
the truth, and nothing but the truth, in a very clear way of relation of what
has past.

Gentlemen, I shall open to you as near as I can, as it comes within my
memory, those things of circumstance which are worthy the taking notice of, and
one in the first place shall be, the occasion why so many of the Forces were not
then upon the place, which you will find to be upon very good ground and reason,
for the preservation of the Countries that were behind, and of this City, which
is he particular thing in the care, and now under the deligence of my Lo:
General, to preserve. There was left at Hereford which lies upon the confines
of Wales, a Regiment of Foot under the command of my Lo: of Stamford, and a
Troop or two of Horse, that the power of Wales might not fall in upon
Gloucestershire, and upon the river of Severn, and so upon the West. There was
likewise left at Worcester (which you all know how it is seated upon the river
of Severne, and what advantage it has to interce Pt all force that shall come
from Shrewsbury down into the West) a Regiment of my Lord Saint John's, and Sir
John Merricks. There was for the safety of Coventry (for that was a town it was
likely the King might have fallen upon) the Regiment of my Lo: Rochford; but it
seems that his Excellence the E. of Essex his Army did so quickly come up to
the Kings, that the King thought it no way fit or advantageous for him to spend
any time upon those places, for certainly they would have very quickly been
relieved, so that the King stipt by Warwick and Coventry, which otherwise we
conceive they were towns he had as good an eye upon as any other towns in the
whole Kingdom, excepting this. There was likewise occasion upon the suddennes
of my Lords march, 2. Regiments of Foot, one under the command of a Gentleman
you all know, Col: Hampden, and the other under the command of Col: Grantham,
with some 10. or 12. Troops of Horse, and these were but one days march
behind, and upon the occasion of bringing up some powder, and ammunition, and
Artillery, which my Lord would not stay for purposely upon his diligence and
desire that there should not be an hour lost in pursuing after that Army, and
that he might make all haste in coming up to this town, and his desire to make
haste to keep with that Army was such, that he kept for two or three days
together a days march before that Army; and so there being another Regiment
lodged in Banbury, occasionally for their own safety, there was with my Lord
when this battle was fought upon the Lords day, 11. Regiments of Foot, and
about the number of 35. or 37. or 40. troops of Horse; that which makes me say
this to you, is partly for your satisfactions, that you may know the reasons of
the things are past, and partly that you may give the more glory to God for his
blessing, and for his preservation of that remnant of the Army which was
together, being about 11. Regiments of Foot, and a matter of 35. or 40. troops
of Horse.

Upon the Saturday at night, upon a very long march (for they came not in til
9. or 10. a clock at night) the Army came to Konton, and the next morning
about 7. a clock (though all that night there was news came that the King was
going to Banbury) we had certain information he was coming down a hill, which
is called Edge Hill, which has some advantage by nature for Forts, and
breast-works, and such things as those are; and that Hill the Kings Army came
down at that time (that Army which goes under the pretense of being raised for
him, and by his authority, for and against the Parl.) his Army coming down,
my Lo: of Essex presently drew out into the Field, and drew his Army into a
place of as good advantage as possibly he could, though the other Army had the
advantage by the hill, which they were possessed of before, and at the beginning
of the day the wind it was against us, and was for the advantage of the other
Army. The preparation on both sides was for the making of them ready for
fight, and the Kings coming down the hill was so long, that there was nothing
done til 4. in the afternoon. And Gentleman I shall tell you the worst as well as
the best, that you may know all, and that when you have known the worst, you
may find it in your judgments, to give the more praise to God for his mercy,
after there was so much probability of having such an ill success.

After that we had shot 2. or 3. Pieces of Ordnance, they began for to shoot
some of theirs, and truly not long after, before there was any near execution,
there was 3. or 4. of our Regiments fairly ran away. I shall name you the
particulars, and afterward name you those that did the extraordinary service,
whereof you will find those of this City to have been very extraordinary
instruments. There were that ran away, Sir Will: Fairfax his Regiment, Sir Henry
Cholmleys, and my Lord Mandevils, and to say the plain truth my own. These ran
away.

Gentlemen, you see by this time I am like to tell you the truth, I hope of
every thing, but yet I must say this, that though they did so, yet I hope there
will be very convenient and very good number of them got together again, that
may show themselves in better condition, and better way of service then yet
they have done, I hope so, and by the blessing of God it may be so, for they
are but young soldiers, and we have seen very good experience of some of
them, that have this last battle done very extraordinary and gallant service,
not long after there was a charge upon the left wing of the horse, and there I
conceive there was a matter of 18, or 19. Troops, and truly I cannot say they
did so well as they should, though I hope there are not many of them cut off
neither, but that they will be brought together again to do very good service
hereafter, but so it is, they had the worst of it, and by this you will see
that at the beginning of the day we might think it would not prove so well as
it pleased God it did afterward in the close of the day, for four troops
were divided, and one part of the horse were not in good order, but it pleased
God now to show himself, for after they had past the left wing of our horse, I
cannot say it was in any hands but Gods own providence, the horse that had past
through them flolowed them in part, and went to the Town where all our baggage
was; the baggage of the officers and the private persons of the Army, not they
of the Artilery, but the Colonels carts and the Captains carts, and such
provision as that, and there they took a bait upon our pillage, and fell a
plundering, all that while the rest of the Army was a fighting, and indeed my
Lord General had some more loss then ordinary by some clothes and money he
had there, but we may thank God they were away, for thereby the rest of the
Army had the better opportunity to do that service they did.

My Lord General himself upon this extremity did begin to show himself to be
more then an ordinary man, and indeed I think more then I have heard tell of
any man, for he charged up at several times, once with his own troop of horse
as I remember, but I am sure with his own Regiment of foot which was raised
here in Essex, and though so many ill passages happened before, with his own
providence and encouragement, and the encouragement of others, his own troop
of horse fell upon the Kings own Regiment, (which they had most hopes of)
which they called the red Regiment, after a sore and bitter fight (for to give
them their due, they fought very well, those of my Lord of Essex his regiment,
and those horse I spoke of before) they killed the Kings Standard bearer Sir
Edward Varney, they took the Kings Standard which was raised up against the
Parliament, and it was brought my Lo: General, and he delivered it to a servant
which was not so careful as he ought to have been, but it was not taken by
force but by the carelessness and negligence of some persons, but it was gotten
by force and lost thus. They took likewise the Kings General prisoner; and
carried him away, they took prisoner my Lord Generals Son, my Lo: Willoughby,
that person you have heard so much of, and been so well acquainted with here,
Col. Lunsford which should have had the Tower, he was likewise taken prisoner,
and his brother slain, and Sir Edward Stradling prisoner, and diverse others of
quality, My Lo: Awberney, and Col: Vavasour, and Sir Edward Munroy a Scotchman
of great quality, while these were upon this service I must give the right to
diverse other of the Officers of the horse which were upon the right wing, that
they did extraordinary service to, that was my Lord of Bedford himself who did
very galantly, and Sir Will. Belfore the late Lieutenant of the Tower, Sir
Phillip Stapelton, and all the troop which formerly had been under some other
kind of report, they did extraordinary service, kept entirely to their charge,
and though they were long under the power of the other Canons there were some
17. shot of Canon shot against them, and they stood still, and God be thanked
not a man of them hurt, yet there was likewise very extraordinary service
performed by my Lo: Gray and Sir Arther Hazelrig, who indeed was a help for
to give a great turn to the day by cutting off a Regiment of the Kings which
was called the blew Regiment, and there were many other Gentlemen of great
worth, that did very extraordinary service, too, I would not have you
understand that others did not do it, because I remember not their names for I
speak to you now but on the sudden, but there were diverse others did very great
service, only these I have named that come to my memory, and you will hear
more of the rest upon other occasions; upon the close of the day we know it for
certain, that the best Regiment of the Kings was cut off, and the next his best
Regiment, which was that was under my Lord of Linsey; there was all the
prisoners taken I told you off, there were those persons of quallitie slain I
told you off, and there was as we conceive (this I tell you upon information,
as we conceive, and are in formed by the Country men that saw them bury the
dead next day, and bring them up into heaps, there was as is informed, and
conceived) about 3000 of theirs slain: and we cannot believe, nor we cannot
have any information, to give us reason to believe that there was ab^ve 300 of
ours slain; And this was to be observed of Gods providence in this days work,
that though it began so improbably, yet before the close of the night, which
was two hours, (for they began to fight indeed, but about four a clock,) we
had got the ground, that they were upon, we had gotten the wind, and we do not
know, nor by information conceive, that there was twenty men of ours killed, by
all the Kings Cannon; when it was night that there could be no more fighting,
we drew our forces together, and so likewise did the King; they were then but
at a reasonable distance, it may be three times, or six times or some such
distance of this room; but in the night the forces of the King withdrew up
toward the hill from whence they came; and my Lord General amongst others
sent my self for to bring on those forces which I told you were a days march
behind, (which was Collonell Hamden, and Collonell Grantham, and those troops
of horse, and the Artillery,) and sent to bring them up to him; and about one a
clock at night, or two a clock, those forces came to my Lord General, and
joined with the rest of the Army, and when the King had drawn his forces up
the hill, my Lord General drew us a matter of half a mile, or three quarters
of a mile further from the hill, that he might be out of the power of the
Cannon; there we stood to our arms all the night, and in the morning drew our
selves out again into the fields but we heard no more news of the other army,
more then we saw some scattering men, of some three or four troops of horses
on the top of the hill, which came to bury the dead, and take away some of
their Cannon, and such things as those were, but they came no more down the
hill, neither that day, nor on tuesday, though there were diverse reports came
to us in the Army, and I believe came hither, that there was fighting on
Monday, and Teusday, yet there was no fighting, for the King kept on the top of
the hill, and we came away on Teusday at four a clock; so that we can assure
you there was no more action, then was on the Lords day;

Gentlemen I shall after I have declared this narration to you say no more then
this, that certainly my Lord General himself has deserved as much in this
service, for his pains, and for his care, and for the particular success that
was upon it, as truly I think ever any Gentleman did; and in the next place,
that as God of his own immediate providence did thus declare himself for the
owning of his own cause, so you will not forget to apply your selves to God,
to give him the glory, and to entreat his blessing upon the future success.

Master STRODE his SPEECH.
GEntlemen all, as this noble Lord has told you, my Lord General has sent
him up to you, to give you a clear information of what was done: he has given
you so clear a one, that there is little left for me to say to you, only my
attestation, and that needs not, had that been all, I should have said
nothing but in the Innumeration of those regiments that did run away, and of
his own, I must needs say thus much, when they all were away, he stayed with us
in the service all that night, this hold it my duty to this honorable person,
it was modesty in himself to say nothing;

I shall crave leave a little further, to make you some observation, that as
God did this great work, and we ascribe to him the honor, so you will look
upon the persons by whom he did it; In the first place, you have heard when as
it was 1000 to one but that we had lost the day by running away of the troop
of horse, and the four Regiments, and then the General did draw up his own
Regiment, and then did God begin in them to show his own work, and it was not
only in them, but by a Regiment raised in Essex and another Regiment raised in
this City under the command of master Hollis, and another Regiment of my Lord
Brooks, which had the day upon them; these were the men that were
ignominiously, reproached by the name of Roundheads, and by these Roundheads
did God show himself a most glorious God; And truly (Gentlemen) they that will
report to you the Number of our dead, farther then we have reported them to
you, must find them many miles from the Army, and then they were men that run
away so far, that it was no matter who killed them; for our men that we could
find any where about the place, we cannot find in all (nor think) above 300,
and you will say, they were well lost that ru^ away; the boldest men of them that
stood were few lost, and they that were so lost, were lost with a great deal
of honor; and I believe, you will have them in more reputation, then they that
live and run away; so that truly I can say no more to you, in such a cause as
this is, that you have undertaken with your purses, and with your persons, God
has showed himself with us be you but courageous and we never need doubt it;
and so we say all.

The Earl of PEMBROOK his SPEECH.
MY Lord Mayor, and you Gentlemen of the City, I am commanded, and the reason
that makes me trouble you at this time with saying any thing, is by reason of a
Letter I have received from the Committee, which I think is a Letter of some
consequence, and fitting for you to see; otherwise I am so ill a Speaker after
such a Declaration made to you, I have not the boldness to say any thing to
you: but truly though I say little, and have a bad tongue, yet I have ever had
so good a heart to this business, that I shall ever live and die in it.

Gentlemen, you have showed your selves like brave and noble Citizens; you have
done it with that nobleness, with that alacrity, with that love to God, King,
and Parliament, that none of your Ancestors before you never showed more love,
nor care, nor zeal, nor performed that you have done better: I have only this
to say to you, If the times are such (not that I think there is any great
peril in the Kings Army now, for they have told you nothing but truth) yet
when you have seen this Letter, you will find there is very good cause for you
to crown this work, which must be by following it, with the same zeal, love,
care, and nobleness, and alacrity, which if you do, you may well crown your
selves with the name of a glorious City; and none more.

The Letter
For his Excellency the Earl of CUMBERLAND, Lord Ganerall of His Majesty's
Forces in the North.
MY very good Lord, your Lordships of the twentieth of this month I have
received by Stockdale, and have read it to his Majesty; who willed me to
fignifie to your Lordship, that he is well pleased with your Lordships
continuing of the Sheriff in his place, albeit he sent a Writ for his
discharge: his Majesty takes a special notice of your Lordships vigilance and
care, in the trust he has reposed in your Lordship; as he has by many very
gracious expressions declared at several times, openly, upon conference of
your business in that County: Your Lordships care of my Lady Duchess of
Buckingham, is (I assure you) very well taken by his Majesty. Sir Ralph Hopton,
and other Gentlemen in the West, have raised ten thousand Horse and Foot, with
which they have already disarmed all persons in Cornwall that are disaffected
to the King: they have taken Lanceston, and are marching into Devonshire, to
disarm the disaffected there; and so intend to come to meet the King at London:
here are also in Wales about six or seven thousand men levied for the King,
which are to be under Marquess Hartford, that will be ready upon all
occasions, to come to his Majesty; but we hope he will not need their help,
having given the Earl of Essex such a blow, as they will make no haste again to
adventure themselves in that cause, against Gods Anointed: I shall refer your
Lordship to the relation of the Bearer, for the particulars. To morrow his
Majesty marches toward London, by Oxford. I am so full of business, as I
must crave your Lordships pardon that I write so briefly; but I am
nevertheless.

Edgescot, Northampton, October. 24. 1642. Your Lordships most humble Servant,
Edward Nicholas.

The Earl of HOLLAND his SPEECH.
MY Lord Mayor, and you Gentlemen of the City, It is more by obedience then
confidence, that I say any thing to you at this time; my Lords and the Comittee
command me, and therefore I shall obey them: That that I shall say to you, is
to observe in the Relation that this noble Lord has made: In the first part of
it, what deliverance God has sent you, that in a danger, and indeed such as I
am confident all that were there believe the Cause of Religion, and Liberty,
and all lost; you saw what a present turn it had, such a one, as if it did not
give them the victory, it gave them the advantage, that is certain; and truly
a very great one, especially when it was taken from so unhappy a condition as
they were likely to be in, wherein God has showed us what a danger might have
fallen upon us: And certainly it is, because every man should consider in that
danger, what he might have suffered, and what his cause might have suffered,
and to give you all by this, warning, That as he has now begun to deliver you
only by his hand, and by his power, he will expect that you will express such
a thankfulness to him for it, as now to make his Cause your work, and to do it
with your hands, boldly, and with courage: For this Letter that you heard read
now, you see what is threatened against you; the least that you must expect, is
this great Army of the Kings, that certainly by the dispositions of those that
command it, and have great power in it, you must know what to expect, and what
to trust to; they intend you no less (and that is to be believed) then the
destroying of the City, your persons, and the preying upon your fortunes: This
is not all, you see that if this does not prevail, or be not powerful enough,
an Army must come from the west, the preparation of another in the North from
all parts of the Kingdom, the sword is drawn against you: and truly having
those ill intentions that they certainly have, it is the wisest course they can
take; for in your City is the strength of the kingdom indeed; it is not only
the life, but the soul of it; if they can destroy you here, the rest of the
Kingdom must all submit and yield, and in that yielding must give over the
maintenance of all that is most dear to them: Therefore if you will now
consider how God has showed you first, that he has kept the first blow from
you, by delivering of you indeed from such an immine^t danger, as it could not
be believed it could have been recovered, but by himself, and by the power of
his hand; this may give you just encouragement to pursue al things that are for
his glory, and for the defense of your Religion, and his cause, I am confident,
as you will do it with thankfulness, and duty, and sincerity to him, so in
wisdom, and reason you will (seeing with threatenings there are unto you, you
will defend your selves, and your families; nature directs you to it, as well
as piety; we only recommend this to you, that you may but know it, and take it
into your thoughts, and into your hearts, and then we are confident your
hearts will be raised with so much piety, with so much courage, and with so
much resolution, as you will defend your selves, and in defending your selves,
defend us, the Parliament, and the Kingdom, you may do it, you have power, and
we expect it from your affections. Finis.

The Lord Say and Seal his speech.
MY Lords and Gentlemen, that little that I have to say, shall not be to set
forth your approaching danger, but I shall rather apply my self to stir up your
spirits, to encourage you, and to settle this opinion in you, that if you be
not wanting unto your selves, which cannot be imagined in this cause, you will
have no cause to fear danger; it cannot be doubted by that which you have
heard, but that these malignant mischeivous counselors, and these men of
desperate fortunes that they have gathered to them, and into whose hands they
have put our King, that their intentions are, that this rich glorious City
should be delivered up as a prey, as a reward to them for their treason
against the Kingdom and the Parliament, and that your lives should satisfy
their malice, your wives, your daughters, their lust, and religion it self the
dearest thing of all others to us, should be made merchandise off, to invite
Papists, to invite foreigners. Notwithstanding their intentions let no man's
heart be discouraged, you have power enough in your hands, to bring all this
wickedness upon their own heads, through Gods blessing; if you will use your
hands, if you will hold them up to serve your God, to defend the true religion
of Almighty God, to defend your lives, to defend this Kingdom and the
Parliament, you need not fear any thing that can be done by this broken Army,
nor fear those things, that are here written in this letter, nor those things
that are falsely buzzed abroad by a malignant party, in your City to amaze you,
there is no fear of danger, but in security, in sitting still; and therefore
if you will be stirred up (as I cannot doubt, we cannot imagine you will) to do
that that every man, both by the law of God, and by the law of Nature in this
case will be induced to do, through Gods blessing, you shall both honor God,
maintain the true Religion, save this Kingdom, save the Parliament, and
Crown your good beginnings that God has pleased to show himself unto us in;
this is now not a time for men to think with themselves, that they will be in
their shops, to get a little money, this is a time to do that that you do; in
common dangers, let every man take his weapons in his hand, let him offer
himself willingly to serve his God, and to maintain true Religion; you may
remember what God says by the Prophet, my heart is set upon those people, that
are willing to offer themselves willingly upon the high places; let every man
therefore shut up his shop, let him take his musket, let him offer himself
readily, and willingly, let him not think with himself, who shall pay me, but
rather think this, I Will come forth to save the Kingdom, to serve my God, to
maintain his true Religion, to save the Parliament, to save this noble city,
and when this danger is overcome, I Will trust the State, that they will have a
regard unto whatsoever may be fit, either for my reparation in any loss; or
for my reward; do as you do in common dangers, when there is a fire, men ask
not who shall pay him his days wages, but every man comes forth of his doors,
helps to quench the fire, brings a bucket, if he have one, borrowes one of his
neighbor if he have not, when the fire is quenched, then the City will regard
to repair any man that has suffered all day, that do you, every one bring
forth his Arms, if he have it, if he have it not, let him borrow Arms of his
neighbor, or he shall be armed from the State; let every man arm himself,
and arm his apprentizes, and come forth with boldness and with courage, and
with cheerfulness, and doubt not but God will assist you; for though you be
concerned in all you have, yet this is Gods cause, that should be your
encouragement, for they are Papists, they are Atheists, that come to destroy
you; they come indeed in the first and principle aim they have to destroy
Religion; Papists are invited, they have Commissions, are these men that should
defend the Protestant Religion, when they are Papists, and recusants. Therefore
if that you shall come forth, God will go forth with you, he will fight for
you, he will save you, but how? he will not save you without your selves; you
may remember what was said, Curse ye Merosh, because they came not out to help
the Lord against the mighty; he needs not your help, but he will use your
service, that he may bless you, and therefore let every man be encouraged, let
him show his readiness, let hiw show his forwardness; remember what the
Scripture says, Hear O Israel, God is with you, so long as you are with him,
the Lord will be with you in this cause, for it his cause, but then you must
show your selves ready to be with him, but I need not use these speeches to
those that have expressed already, so much affection as you have done, I shall
only encourage you to go on; be not daunted, let not malignant parties that
go up and down, and would go about to inform you, that there are these
fears, and these dangers, let them not make you be wanting to your selves,
fear them not at all; I shall conclude with this, that that good King said, up
and be doing, and the Lord will be with you. Finis.

The Lord Wharton his second speech
GEntlemen, I shall trouble you but with a word or two the one is upon part of
that narrative, which I began withal, wherein truly I take my self to be very
beholding to that Gentleman that spoke after me, that he did not forget to
inform you of the extraordinary blessing, that God bestowed upon the courage of
honest, pious, and religious men; for truly there was very few that did any
extraordinary service, but such as had a mark of religion upon them: That which
I omitted to tell you, was this, that one great cause of the preservation, and
of the success of that day, was the barbarousnesse, and inhumanity of Prince
Robert, and his Troops, who while we were a fighting, not only pillaged of the
baggage (which was but a poor employment!) but most barbarously killed
Countrymen that came in with their teemes, and women, and children that were
with them; this I think comes not amiss to tell you, because you may see, what
is the thing they aim at, which is pillage, and baggage, and plundering, and
the way which they would come by it is mundering, and destroying, and therefore
it will come in very properly, to encourage you to that work, which these two
noble Lords have so well opened to you, which is, the standing upon your
defense; and to that I shall only add this, that when you shall have done that
in that measure, and in that proportion, (which we do not doubt but you will
do, because you have always showed your affections, and your wisdoms, to
be so great in the carriage on of this business, I say, when you shall have so
behaved your selves,) there is no doubt but Gods blessing will be upon it, and
you will be sure to have an extraordinary back, you will be sure to have an
extraordinary assistance, for the Lord of Essex with the whole Army, will be
sure to be on the one side, when you with your defense will be on the other
side, and when that Army shall lie between these two, without question they
will come to a very short conclusion, when you may reap the fruit of your
labors that you have been at, to your benefit, and your posterities. Finis.

The Earl of Holland his second speeth
MY Lord Mayor and Gentlemen, it is but a word or two that I shall say to you,
for the shutting up of this; the danger has heene represented to you, we must
desire you likewise to consider how near it moves, that you must resolve and
act both together; they conceiv this Army will be at Oxford as this night, that
is within such a distance, as within threee days they may march to London, it
is very necessary for you to provide against this, as a danger that may be
very suddenly upon you, if they should chance to march before the other Army,
and with such an advantage, as to break up bridges, or any such thing, as may
hinder the other Army to move presently, and suddenly after them. Consider how
open you are to this danger, if you provide not presently for it, therefore as
we have given you reasons, and indeed as you may take almost from your own
reasons to defend your selves) that it will be very necessary for you, to look
upon this as a danger, that you will not lose an hour for the providing against,
and that is all I shall say unto you. Finis.

The Earl of Pembrook his second speech.
MY Lord Mayor, and you Gentlemen, I shall only speak one word to you, and
that concerns your selves most nearest, and you know them better than I a
great deal, though I have been a long time bred in the City for many years,
truly you that are Citizens, must know it better than I, you know you have a
great malignant party in the City, you have now time and power to look to
them, leave no time to look into it, for if you leave that till a time of
distraction, they will be a great deal bolder than now they are, now you may
do it in time.

FINIS.
