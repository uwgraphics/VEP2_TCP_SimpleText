A Mournful ELEGY upon the three Renowned Worthies, Duke HAMILTON, the Earl
of HOLLAND, and the ever to be honored Lord CAPEL, who were Tyrannically
Murdered by a usurped Illegal Power of the wicked Court of Injustice, and
pretended Parliament, upon Friday, the 9. of March, 1649. In the Palace-yard
before Westminster-Hall-Gate.
AWake my Muse in a sad Elegy,
T'relate the murdering Acts of Tyranny,
A once known vice, but now a virtue made,
And ushered in by those who 're not afraid
Of Heaven nor Hell, of death nor judgment sure,
There seared consciences do sleep secure;
With hands imbrued in blood of Innocents,
With hearts remorslesse, and with Souls condence,
Harder then flint, or rather adamant,
Killing the Father, careless of the Infant;
Making poor Widows comfortless abroad
To wander with their Children t'seek abode,
In foreign Lands, being bereft of goods,
Lands, houses, rents, yes and their Husbands bloods,
Spilt by base Traitors to inebriate
Their thirsty Souls, whose stomach's never abate,
But still are dry, and do again desire
More loyal blood to quench that burning fire,
Of Hels instigation which within
Their envious bosoms has this long time been
Kept close and smothered, wanting power to vent,
What has this many years been their intent;
Till now at length our sins and vile transgression
Has moved our God, t'permit them with oppression,
Rapes, plunder, murder, tyranny, what not
Well nigh the Name of KING amongst us to blot,
But this our comfort's we 'ave a sovereign God,
Who when he 'as scourged us, he will burn the rod:
But what does this avail us? oh! alas!
Whilst that our glory does from amongst us pass,
What shall we do? alas! lets howl and weep
To see our loyal Nobles, killed like Sheep;
Slaughtered by Rebels, who like Wolves devour
And seek new ways to entrap them every hour
With subtle ginnes and snares of Tabor laid
Like Fowlers which are wonted to that trade,
Mispah's the hill whereon these Tyrants play,
But all the Land they make Akeldema:
Come then join issue that Aonian Band,
Distill the sad complaints into my hand,
With mournful Muse complete my doleful Pen
TO bewail the loss of these three Noblemen;
First HAMILTON, who though he was a Scot
Was honest to his KING, therefore forgot;
He never shall be for to's immortal fame,
Sad Elegies shall be writ on his Name;
Then drop a tear, and stain this Paper now
To see how Loyalty is made to bow
By base Rebellion, oh! with watery eyes
Let each true Subject read these Elegies,
Of famous HAMILTON, and both the other
Who shall in order follow one the the other:
Of him (because a Scot) I Will say no more,
But will the Earl of HOLLAND'S death deplore;
Who is our Countryman, and ought to be
Beloved, though blemished, with disloyalty;
Whether deserved or no I cannot tell,
But of the dead, I Will nothing say, but well:
His actions at the last, did prove him t'be
A lover of his KINGS Posterity:
And this is truth, then let black envy bark,
And spit its venom, it will miss the mark;
For his fame will aye endure, and he
Will sure be taken for an Enemy;
Traitors, and Rebels, and with loyal tears,
He Will be lamented as the murdered Peers,
Of England, will be; who, to serve the KING did die,
The only badge of true Nobility;
What can be more expected from one's friend
Then to give his life his Person to defend,
All which was done by these forementioned Lords,
Whose loyalty both grief and joy affords;
TO each honest heart, even the flinty'st stone,
Lying in the streets, with drops of dew bemoane:
Our murdered Nobles offering tears to shed
To see Nobility thus ruined:
Their houses tattered, look like as forlorn,
The pleasant Birds that chirpt upon each thorn,
Do seem to hang their wings, and cease to sing
Ought but doleful notes, for our lost KING:
And His true Subjects who have death disdained,
And by their valors, honor have obtained;
Which would endure with them to eternity
If possible the world so long could be:
And so I Will leave them both to speak of him,
Who has substance of true valor been,
Renowned CAPEL, whose undaunted spirit
Amongst his greatest Foes did honor merit;
Whose actions manifested him to be
A second Hector, or more in degree,
Hated by Achillis, 'cause his fame
Did seem to blemish great Achillis name;
Therefore with his Mirmidons, he murdered quite
That worthy Hector to increase his light,
But come you Muses nine Melpomene
And your dread Mother sad Mnemosyme,
For to lament brave CAPEL'S death combine
With eyes distilling tears, of crystal fine,
Heavens weep your fill, and if the rocks be dry*
Lend water to them all their wants to supply,
For if I had the monopoly of tears
I Would shed them all for these three murtherd Peers,
And for my faults I wish that I could dip
My pen in Hellicon or Aganip,
Then I could justly claim the honor to be
The Author of bold CAPEL'S Elegy;
But tears do stop my Genius, and my heart
OF recharg'd with sorrow, and possessed with smart,
For such a noble Worthy, whose brave deeds
May be a mirror unto him that reads,
In after Ages and may cause them then,
T'observe bold CAPEL as the best of men;
Then let both hills and rocks echo amain
Hadaddrimmons, mourning on Megiddons plain,
As for Josia's t'did that Champion bold,
So now for CAPEL, who is dead and cold,
Why howl the Fir-trees on Mount Lebanon,
Are all the stately Cedars felled and gone?
No, no, alas! they are but removed
Into a better soil, where they are beloved:
No envy there is amongst them but true glory,
Therefore with confidence I Will write their story;
And shall desire each eye if not of flint
To melt it self with sorrow, and to hint
A show of grief, and doleful tears distill
Upon the earth, or else the Heavens will
Water the plants with showers of greatest rain
For him whose Fellow, we's never have again:
CAPEL, the welspring of true valor decked
With loyalty, and a just true respect
Of's Countries good, and of his Sovereigns Cause,
Scorning to submit himself to Rebels Laws,
Was murdered by them; but my comfort's this,
He now enjoies his God in Heavens bliss:
Where he with Angels pure, by Gods permission
May sit in Judgment, and send to perdition
Bradshaw, Steel, Cook, Ask, Dorislow, and the rest,
Who did our KING, and's Subjects all divest
Of's Regal Power: So give me leave to end,
And to Gods Judgments, Traitors to recommend.
Printed in the first Year of Rebellious Liberty, and Democraticall Tyranny.
1649.
