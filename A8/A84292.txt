AN EXIT TO THE EXIT TYRANNUS: OR, Upon Erasing that Ignominious and Scandalous
Motto, which was set over the place where KING CHARLES the First Statue stood,
in the Royal Exchange, LONDON.
To the Tune of I made a Voyage into France, etc.
1
AFter cursed Traitors damned rage
At length is come that happy age
Wherein our hopes are crowned,
Our griefs are turned to joys, and all
Our miseries and sorrows shall
Be in Canary drowned.
2
Thrice happy night which black as thee
Have caused that Hell black doom to be
Made by a Tyrant Crew,
When to fulfill the Divellish lust
They Would make it seem both good and just
That they their Sovereign slew.
3
'Twas not enough with them to draw
Their Sword against the KING and Law
To Rob and Steal and Plunder,
'Twas not enough to act all Treason
Pretending still religious reason
This was in them no wonder.
4
'Twas not enough they had destroyed
Our KING, to make our name abroad
A mock and scorn to be,
But to add further to our shame
At home they blast his glorious name
With marks of Tyranny.
5
Cursed Generation of Hams tribe
Their wickedness to him ascribe
And seek his fame to taint,
Of whom it justly might be cride
He was a Martyr when he di'd
And whilst he lived a Saint.
6
To palliate their seditious acts
They charge him with those odious facts
Which they themselves commit,
And 'cause they had by their own fault
Both Church and State to ruin brought
He must be cause of it.
7
Exit Tyrannus up they set
As if the Kingdom then did get
By this their Liberty,
When as indeed from this their crime
The Nation well might date the time
Of real Tyranny.
8
We since have found their zealous tones
Have caused our true and real groans
We see their Good old Cause,
Was only made for a pretense
To banish all our freedom hence
And overthrow our Laws.
9
Oh CHARLES that Exit which they put
Up ore thy Statues Head was but
An entrance to our Woe,
That fatal Axe which thee divorced
From us, our happiness has forced
Into the Grave to go.
10
But blessed be Providence that we
This happy Night have lived to see
Wherein for all their spite,
We see some hope that at the length
The Kingdom may recover strength
And thou regaine thy right.
11
Thy fame no more shall be defaced
But with these glorious titles graced
Which are due to thy merit,
Nor shall the babbling Rout now dare
To exclaim against thee in their prayer
Or curse thee by the spirit.
12
Nor is it our happiness alone
Thy disgrace is wiped out o'th stone
But does proceed yet farther,
Brave Monk has given an exeunt too
To those these Nations did undo
And did commit thy murder.
13
Go on brave George, and as before
Our Nation to her right restore
Call in the lawful heir,
Speak but an entrance to our KING,
And none but will thy praises sing
And bless thee in their prayer.
FINIS.
