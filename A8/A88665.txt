To the Reader.
Christian Reader,
ALthough there be many Volumes flying abroad in the World (to what good
purpose many of them tends, they can best tell who have experimentally perused
their profit) yet I do aver, that this small Manual can do more to thee (in its
kind) then any, or most of them all. For 1. (Though I am only able to call
thee by thy general name, Christian, and to suppose or wish thee (as I wish my
self) to be what that name bespeaks, that is, really cordial, and sincere in
Christianity, yet) it can call thee by that very name by which thou have been
called since thy Baptism. And 2. it can tell thee (that which perhaps thou
never hitherto could tell thy self, nor thy Parents before thee, who gave it
unto thee, viz.) what that name of thine does import and signify; to the end
thou may shun it, if evil, and follow it, if good. 3. It can set also before
thee the names of all thy Friends and Acquaintance, (...) Male or Female) and
make thee able to judge whether they walk worthy of their names, or not: 4. It
can reckon up unto thee the names of all the Patriarchs, and Holy Men mentioned
in the Scriptures; and so mind thee of them as patterns, to imitate their
Virtues. 5. Lastly, it can set all those names (and many more, even all the
used names of Christians) with their significations in order before thee, that
so, if either thou do already, or hopest to enjoy the blessing of that
condition which carries in it the capacity of building thy name, and the name
of thy Family, by the names of the Children coming out of thy loins; thou may
then make choice of them all, and pitch upon some of the best, by which to mind
thy following generation, of their obedience to God, and duties to Men,
bespoken so clearly in the names by thee imposed upon them.

And here, the truth is, I cannot but openly bemoan and lament what I have
often and much resented in my thoughts; to wit; that most irrational custom
crept in upon the Christian World, of using so much those Heathenish and
Paganish names entertained amongst us; (especially since we know not well their
meaning, nor what they did import in the Language of our Ancestors; for in our
own, most of them do signify nothing but flat nonsense, as to most of us)
leaving and laying aside those most significant Scriptural names imposed upon
Children of old by their holy Parents, to put them in mind of the ways they
should walk in, all along their life in the days of their Pilgrimage; I say,
that although in the times of (our Ancestors) ignorance, God may be said to
have winked at this (as at many other things in them, and in those dark times:)
yet now, when knowledge does (begin to) abound, and to fill and cover the
Earth, as the Waters do the Seas; and when the original words of God, and the
names contained in them, do (begin to) fall under our clearer knowledge; That
Christians, forsaking those pure Fountains of Shiloh, should content themselves
with those impure Streams of Atheism, viz. the names of people living without
God in the world, and without the true knowledge of him, is no less than a
reproach to Christianity; yea not only so, but an intolerable and irrational
absurdity, when we know not certainly what those Heathenish names do import and
signify: for what? is it not a shame for any rational man to speak nonsense,
that is, to speak any one word (like a Parrat) which he does not know what it
means? what a shame then is it (not only for Christian, but even) for
rational Parents, to impose upon their Children names (of nonsense (to them)
which they do not understand themselves what they mean; and so to call them,
and make them to be called all their life long by names which they know not; is
not this to call them (whom they love best) and they know not what? I profess,
I do think that the very thought of this, may have such sharp reflections upon
those who cannot help it, having thus named their Children already, that I do
therefore forbear to speak any thing more of it here, having spoken thus much,
to prevent the disease in them who have not, as yet, past the remedy. And thus
far for the little work it self ensuing; now for the Author of it. I shall
only speak a few words, and that by way of encouragement to all young
Gentlemen, in his, or the like condition, viz. to all Apprentices, or others;
who although they have not wholly given themselves to be Scholars, yet they do
not desire to spend their vacant hours from their other chosen employments, in
idleness; I say, for the encouragement of all, or any such, I would only show
them, that the Youth, who is the Author of this Manual, about three years ago,
did leave the Grammar School, and shortly after did come to be an Apprentice in
London; about which time, his genius leading him to industry about his Book,
although he had left the Schools, he did at spare hours from his undertaken
employment, make a collection of those Christian names, and their
significations, in so far as the Greek or Latin Languages could lead him: But
finding that many of the most precious Scriptural names had their Original from
the Hebrew, he was very desirous to wait for an opportunity to be instructed in
the grounds of that first and chief of Languages. Wherefore about eight or ten
months ago, he, with another young Gentleman, an intimate acquaintance of his,
of the same condition with him, the Author of the first Versed Lines following
(who from the same disposition of abhorring idleness, after he left the
Schools, did become likewise desirous of knowledge in the Hebrew Tongue)
hearing of some facile way to make a progress in the knowledge of that
Language; did come to me, and in the space of six or eight weeks, thrice in the
week, being with me for an hour at a time, and sometimes two, were such
Proficients in their studies, that afterward they both needed me no more to
perfect them; and the Author hereof, within two or three months after, had
transcribed this Copy, deriving from his own knowiedge all the names that were
originally Hebrew, from their own proper roots; and so did make it, as it is
now put in thy hand, ready for the Press; which (as) I am very hopeful that it
shall be useful and profitable, upon several considerations, unto the Perusers
of it, so I shall be always ready, to my power, to encourage all who shall
have serious thoughts this way.

William Robertson. M. A.

To his worthy and much respected Master, Mr. Robert Baxter, Citizen and Grocer
of London.
SIR,
THat I might shun that monstrous Vice, which before God and Man is accounted
most Hateful, in which (as Tully says) is contained all Wickedness, namely,
Ingratitude; and that which when the Persians, Macedonians, or Athenians found
that any man was guilty of, they condemned him to death by their Law; so odious
and abominable was it unto them; and hence the saying is, Ingrato homine nil
pejus, and Si ingratum dixeris, omnia dixeris. Therefore, Sir, I that have in
no small measure tasted of your goodness and clemency, as in many other things,
so in countenancing this small Work of mine (for not only the Foundation
thereof has been laid) but the whole Structure thereof has been reared, in
my (as yet) so short being with you. And fearing that as soon as it shall
appear to the public view, it may need some favorable aspect over it, to
shelter it abroad in the World, from evil and malevolent eyes, I hope, Sir, it
will not be offensive, that I do pitch upon your worth and virtue for that
effect; since I offer it as a testimony of my heart (and not only eye) service
unto you. As also, Sir, seeing that you do very well know, how that Men's
inoccupata mox evadit corrupta, sicut deses aqua, the Mind unoccupied will
quickly be corrupted, even as standing water sooner corrupts and purrifies,
than that which has its course to run with a full Current; and that hence
Seneca, that Christian-like Pagan (as one of the Fathers termed him) says, In
mill facinorum furias men's otiosa discurrit, the Mind that is idle, or
unoccupied, runs into a thousand villainies; and that that of Cicero is most
true, Nihil agendo homines meleagere discunt, by doing nothing, Men learn to do
evil; Idleness (as St. Bernard says) is the sink and receptacle of all filth.
Therefore, Sir, setting before me, as a pattern, your own industrious virtue, I
do hereafter always resolve (God willing) to remember that saying, Non minus
est virtus, quam quaerere parta tueri, it is no less a virtue to keep than to
get; and there is no way to keep (the little) things gotten, and to get a
little more, but by diligent practice; for hence our Proverb is, Solus usus
facit Artifices. These Expressions, Sir, and the thoughts they flow from,
arising from the experience of your humane Ingenuity, I am confident shall not
displease you; as I also am very hopeful that you will not refuse to accept of
these my present weak endeavors in this Work, and the publishing of it, after
your name prefixed unto it, considering it does proceed from a grateful mind.
And therefore, Sir, praying and wishing you (...) shalom shalom, all peace and
happiness, not only now, but especially for ever hereafter, I shall endeavor
to approve my felf,

Sir, Your faithful Servant, Edward Lyford.

The Preface to the Reader.
THis small Treatise (Christian and Courteous Reader) of the Interpretations or
Etymologies of Christian names, which by Divine Assistance is brought to this
conclusion, I suppose needs no large Apology; Especially if thou look on
the pleasure, profit, nay absolute necessity of the imposition of names, and of
knowing their Interpretations or Etymologies. For the first, consider, that the
imposition, or giving of names, was not barely (as some impertinently think) of
humane invention, for God himself was the first ((...)) viz. Giver or Imposer
of names; hence he called the first Man's name (...) Adam (from the substance or
matter whereof he was made) i. earthly Man, or Man made, as it were, of the red
earth, (for the root is (...) Adam, he was red) quod ((...) meadamat haaretz)
i. ex terra rubra illum creavit Deus. i. because God formed him of the reddish
earth, Gen: 2.7. hence also Adam, not without divine instinct, called the name
of his wife (which was the first woman) Eve, in the Hebr: (...) Chavah, i.
living; and he gives the reason of it in the same place, namely, in Gen: 3.20.
because she was the mother ((...) Kol Chai) i. of all living. Were it not for
the imposition of Names, the world would be a (...) Babel, or a Confusion; how
should we be distinguished one from another, but by our Certain Names? hence a
name in Latin is nomen, as it were notimen, i. a mark, from the verb nosco, to
know, quod nominibus dignoscamur, i. because men are known by their names; and
there cannot be a surer mark to know one from another, than their Name; In the
Greek it is (...), which Plato derives (...), ab inquirendo ente, i. from
looking into the being and continuance of any thing: but without Names this
could not be done; in the Hebrew it is (...) shem, which as some think comes
from the root (...) shum, posuit, i. he put, as if a name were positum, a thing
put to distinguish between one and another; hence the woman of Tekoah, (being
suborned by Joab) in a parable speaks thus to David, So shall they quench my
Coal which is left, (...) lebilti shim leishi shem, i. by not putting a name to
my Husband, see 2 Samuel 14.7. that is (as we render it) and shall not leave to
my Husband neither name, etc. where it is employed, that names are of absolute
necessity, not only to the upholding of a man's family, but also to the keeping
of things in order and union, for God is the God of order, and not confusion;
and therefore in Genesis 2.19. God is said to bring every Beast of the Field, and
Fowl of the Air unto Adam, to see what he would call them (taking delight, as
it were, not only to see Adam name them, but also to see every thing in order)
and whatsoever Adam called every living Creature, that was the name thereof.
(...) shem, a name, is also often by Interpreters translated famous and
renowned; so in Genesis 6.4. it is said, which were (...) Anshe hashshem, i. viri
nominis) i. men of Name, which we translate, men of renown, or famous men; for
by our names, our actions of fame or infamy, of praise or dispraise, are upheld
to the following ages; whereas, if there were no names, there could be no
remembrance or upholding of them; how should a man uphold or remember the deeds
of those men that have no names? indeed he knows not whom, or what to remember.

(...) As for the knowing the Etymologies of names, I think it as useful, as
the former is necessary; would it not be a great encouragement and enducement
to all youth, when they know the sweet (for so I account it) Etymologies of
their happy and hopeful names, to make them walk answerable thereunto, that
they may be found worthy thereof? If a youth be nobly descended (as men term
it) then perhaps his name may induce him to be humble and meek; if descended of
a meaner stock, it may encourage him even to exceed himself in actions of
virtue. And here, Reader, we might not only lament the sinful blindness of
the former age (in which the right names of most of the holy men named in the
Scripture, have been brought into obscurity and oblivion, and now seem strange
unto us) but also blame the wilful forgetfulness, or rather neglect of this
Age (to which there is none, (that ever was) comparable, for its Multitudes of
by professors of Religion in words, but few Confessers of their own weaknesses,
or (at least) few Actors of that which they do profess in deeds) in not
imitating the examples of so many godly Patrons and Matrons in the Scriptures
(yea God himself (if I mistake not) and hence he changed Abram his name (i. an
high Father) to Abraham, i. a Father of great multitudes, because of his
promise; for the Lord said, Genesis 17.5. A Father of many Nations have I made
thee. Hence also he called Solomon's name Jedidiah, i. beloved of the Lord, for
it is said, 2 Samuel 12.24. the Lord loved him, etc.) who thought it needful and
requisite (else surely they would not have done it) to give their Children such
names, whose Interpretations or Etymologies were suitable to the estate and
condition they were in, when they named them; that so when they should for the
future remember this, they might glorify and praise the Lord, and think on his
benefits. And hence we find Eber in Genesis 10.25. named his son Peleg (...) which
signifies Division, from (...) in pihel, (...) pilleg, i. he divided, for in
his days (as the text says) the earth ((...) n^phlegah) was divided; and this
name his Father gave him, from the general estate and condition they then were
in. Now for more particular, Joseph (who was a holy and just man, in the sight
of the Lord) when he was in Egypt, begat two Sons, the name of the first he
called Manasses ((...) Menashsheh) which signifies forgetting (from (...)
nashah, he was forgetful) for he said ((...) nashshani) God has made me
forget all my labors, and Fathers house, Genesis 41. v. 51. and this name he gave
him from the particular and present estate was then in; for those troubles and
labors wherein his soul was wrapped up in, (as his being cast into Prison, his
Brethrens cruelty to sell him into a strange Land from his Fathers house)
through the length of time, was by him almost forgotten, and therefore he named
his son Manasses; the name of the second he called (...) Ephraim, that is,
fruitful, (from (...) parah, he was fruitful) for Joseph said ((...)
hiphrani) God has made me fruitful in the Land of my affliction, see Genesis 41.
51, 52.

I should be too prolix if I should here show thee how Leah and Rachel gave
their sons the Patriarks such names, whose Interpretations or Etymologies were
suitable to each of their particular and present estates and conditions they
were in when they named them, Genesis 29.31. to the end; and how Jacob their
Father, in blessing them, does paraphrase on those Interpretations or
Etymologies, Genesis 49. v. 3. to v. 22. see their names in the Book it self
according to their proper places in the Alphabet.

I wish therefore, that all Christians were more seriously exhorted, not so
much to us^ those Barbarous and strange names, as Saxon, Sabin and German
names, which are now introduced amongst us; but rather, that as we are
Christians, so we would use such names that become Christians (I mean) those
Scripture names, whose Interpretations and Etymologies might be suitable to our
several estates and conditions.

Moreover, the consideration of our names, if seriously pondered, should lead
all of us, as often as we shall hear of them, to think on our beginning,
medium, and end. The first, (because our names were given us at our beginning
to be in the World, and at our first entrance into the visible Church by
Baptism) will make us to confess with the Psalmist, Psalm. 119.73. thy hands
have made me, ((...) vojechonenuni) i. filled and prepared me) that God is our
Creator (see Psalm. 71.6. Jer. 43.7.) And if so, then as the Wise Man says,
Eccl. 12.1. he is to be remembered in the days ((...) bechrotenu) i. of our
choice, that is, in the days of our youth, for youth is tempus selectum, a
choice time, and no time better to remember our Creator in, yea it is a time
chosen for that purpose; he gave us our first being, and shall we not give him
our first service? The second should pu^ us in mind of all those benefits and
mercies w^^^ God has been pleased to bestow upon us all the time we have been
called on by such a name; and the thought of the last, namely, of our end,
ought to admonish us, why we had such a name in the World, viz. that we may
please and serve him, by faith and obedience to his Commands, during all the
time that we shall enjoy such a name to the end, when we shall have a new name
written in a white Stone for Eternity given to us.

And further (Christian Reader) by a blessing from above, which I do not only
(but desire thee also to) pray and wait for, this Manual may be no small help
unto thee (as to me it has been) for thy understanding of some (yea many)
places of Scripture in which these names occur more fully and clearly than
before; and hoping that it shall be so, I bid thee farewell, and wish thee as
much pleasure and profit in reading this, as he had in composing it; who is

Thine to serve thee, Edward Lyford.

A Postscript to the Preface.
FOR directions in the use of this Book, there is need of little to be said
that way, the Book it self for the Names, and the Tables for their
significations, being both Alphabetical; so that any may easily in the Book
seek for any name, and there see its signification, and Etymological
derivation; or in the Tables any may seek out, and make choice of any
signification that pleases them best, and accordingly may make use of the name
that has such a signification (for which purpose especially the Tables were
painfully and dil^gently composed) always preferring Scriptural Names, and the
choice of them, before Saxon or German names, etc. which we can scarce be able
to know what they mean. More than this, there is very little to advertise the
Reader of; Except it be that German, Saxon, Sabin, French, Latin, and Greek
derivations of names, are for brevity written and imported thus; Ge or Ger. for
German, Sa. for Saxon or Sabin, Fr. for French, La. for Latin, and Gr. for
Greek; to show that the names are such and such Originally.

And that this mark. i. is put for i. e. id est, that is; or for viz.
videlic^t, to wit, etc. which any intelligent Reader might have conjectured of
himself: Only thus far further the Readers are to be desired, that if as yet
they have learned nothing of the Hebrew, they may consult the Hebrew Grammar
and Dictionary lately published, and sold where this Book is to be sold.

(...) To his much respected and intimate Friend, Edward Lyford, Fellow-Student
in the Holy Tongue, upon his Etymological Analysis of Christian names.
THe times are prone to mutability,
And with these times so mutable are we,
That Times, and we, do cross that stream most pure,
Which gave those names that now become obscure.
From God most holy, to an holy end,
In the holy tongue, our names did first descend:
But now disguised with so much Corruption,
They seem estranged from their first construction.
But, Friend, thou have in this thy little Book,
Worthy all praise, a labor undertook,
To stop those Cataracts, through which might run
Our primitives to base Oblivion.
For what can be more pleasing to a man,
Then the Allegory of his name to scan?
To ancient purity thou do restore
Our names, as they first breathed in time of yore;
Which with such order are inserted here,
And each ones derivation made so clear,
That whosoever shall doubt his names descent,
In any part of the Christian Continent,
Hebrew, Chaldean, also that Jews be,
Jehova's people once, each one by thee,
Our faithfull'st Etymologer, from hence
May truly know, both what is his name, and whence.
Tempora mutantur nos, nostraque nomina. Edward Probee.

To his Quondam Pupil, Edward Lyford, on his Book of the Etymologies of Men's
and Women's Names.
NO spurious offspring is thy Book,
Men know it by his Fathers look.
He that henceforth shall know thy name,
Will doubtless with me say the same,
Confessing that Edward Lyford,
Blessed Keeper, does life afford.
For names, whose meaning was not known,
And dead (as it were) are now shown,
And laid up to be kept in store,
By this blessed Keeper evermore.
Henceforth the Ignorant shall know
What name he had best to bestow
On's Son or Daughter, and not fear
The mockage of the common jear:
His Sons he may call Sans Abuse
Nathanjah, Gods gift Th'odorus;
His Daughter eke, without disgrace,
He may call Hannah, Charis, Grace:
So may, Lyford, thy name long live,
As thou the truth of names do give.

Being, Essence, simple Existence, or Self-subsistence, from the root (...)
havah, or rather (...) hajah, he was, only (...) vau and (...) jod being
changed, which is ordinary among the Hebrews; so that Jehovah imports Gods most
simple, absolute, eternal, and independent Being, Existence, or Subsistence.
And here God appears infinite in all, having his Being in, of, and from

he shall be; it is the future tense, signifying time to come. And hence St.

(whose name was changed to Israel) had power from, to prevail with the strong
God; ((...) ki sarita) for thou have behaved thy self Princely, or as a Prince

416 Midas, as it were (...), i. not seeing, or one that is blind, not
perceiving, foreseeing, knowing or considering, of (...), not, and (...), to

Midas having entertained the Gods, they promised to grant him what he should

thing excepted) might be turned into Gold; having turned a great many Houses
into Gold (as they say) he came to eat his Meat, and turned that into Gold

Pharaoh's Daughter called his name Mosheh, because, said she, ((...) Mashi
tihu) i. I have drawn him out of the Waters, Exodus 2.10. Josephus in his Jewish
Antiquities, lib. 2. cap. 5.9. gives another Etymology of this name, for he
says he was called Moses, because he was saved from the waters in which he
was cast; for (as he writes) they call the waters of Egypt, Mo: in their
tongue, and yses signifies saved, as it were saved from the waters. Indeed it
is very likely that Pharaoh's Daughter spoke the Egyptian, and not purely the
Hebrew Tongue. But the thing it self, and the sense, renders it almost alike.

fell, failed; perished, or decayed, properly of the withering of Flowers; so
that the word (...) Nabal, signifies one, in whom Reason, right Wit,
Understanding, and the Mind (which is the highest and chiefest part of the
Soul) does fall into utter decay, withers, and perishes. Therefore Abigail,
speaking to David of his folly, says thus, 1 Samuel 25. v. 25. ((...) Nabal
shemo unebulah gnimmo) i. Nabal (or one whose reason and judgment has failed
him) is his name, and folly is with him. Hence also some derive the Latin word
Nebulo, a foolish Knave.

(a) Nadab, (...) 1 King. 15.25. as if it were (...) Nadib, i. a Prince, or
liberal, from (...) nadab, he gave freely.

(c) Nimrod, (...) Genesis 10. v. 8. i. a Rebel, from (...) marad, he rebelled;
(...) nun at the beginning is heemantick. It is judiciously observed by some,

10. v. 8.

443 Noah, (...) Noach, i. rest, from the root (...) Nuach, to rest, in hiphil
(...) Henich, he made to rest; For doubtless Lemech (who was the Father of

effect, saying, ( Genesis 5. v. 29. (...) Jenachamenu) he shall comfort us, i. he
shall afford us rest, namely, from the cruelty of those Giants wherewith the

noun; and (...), glory, honor, or renown, from (...), claudo, to shut.

same with (...) Genesis 46.9. Phallu, i. wonderful, from (...) in niphil, (...)
Niphla, to be wonderful, and indeed by him the wonderful (but excellent)
things of the Gospel was preached. This name was given him from the event, for
it was changed from Saul to Paul. So Abram was called Abraham, from the effect,
Genesis 17. v. 5. Hence Jacob was called Israel, for his strength, Genesis 32. v. 28.
So Simon was called Kephas by Christ, 1 John v. 42.

471 Peleg, (...) i. division, from (...) in pihel, (...) pilleg, he divided,
for in his days ((...) niphlegah) the earth was divided, Genesis 10. ver. 25.

sight of God, from (...) panah, he beheld, and (...) El, God, from (...) ejal,

is (...), i. thou shall be called Kephas, in the Syriack, i. (...) Kipha, i. a
Stone. Now as St. Augustine writes in his Tract on Matthew, The Church is
founded, or built (super petram) on a Rock, and hence Peter, or (...), a Stone,
from petra, a Rock, Non autem a petro petra; This name was given him from the
event by our Savior, for in that Matthew. 16. ver. 15. Jesus having asked his
Disciples who he was, Peter answers in the 16 verse, (...), i. Thou art Christ
(i. the Anointed) the Son of the living God; and in the 18 verse Christ says,
Upon this Rock, not (super hunc Petrum) upon this Peter, but upon this faith of
Peter, will I build my Church.

479 Pharaoh, (...) Paregnoh, i. a Revenger, from (...) parang, he revenged.
Josephus in his Book of Jewish Antiquities, lib. 8. cap. 2. writes thus; The
name of Pharaoh signifies as much as King with the Egyptians: But I think they
had other names from their Childhood; but being made Kings, they were called
Pharoahs: so the Kings of Alexandria were Ptolemies, of Rome Caesar's. So far
Josephus. And now the Kings of Portugal are called Don John's.

480 Pharez, (...) Paretz, i. a breach, from (...) paratz, he broke forth, or
made a breach; so called, because he broke forth out of his Mothers womb before

Brotherly love, of (...), i. a Friend, and (...), a Brother, which is

Hospitality one toward another; but when will the Rich be ((...)) and use
Hospitality toward the Poor: For now their word is, Charity begins at home.

492 Phoebus, (...), i. Sol, i. the Sun, as it were (...), of (...), i. Lux,
Light, and (...), Vita, i. Life, that is, Lux vitae, i. the light of life; for
the Sun in the Spring time (in which he returns to us) causes all things to
flourish, wax green, and as it were makes them to revive; and so instrumentally
is that Light which causes Life; or else it may come from (...), purgo, i. to
purge, cleanse, etc. for in the time of the Suns abode with us, which is in the

the Sun shines in going his circuit in the Heavens.

petition ((...) asher shaalti megnimmo) which I asked of him. In the 28 verse

and happiness, and our alone Peacemaker, for it signifies a Savior, blessed,
happy, peaceable, or a Peacemaker, from (...) shalah, he was safe, happy,
quiet, or in peace; and hence it is said, that the chastisement of our peace
was upon him, Isa. 53. v. 5. yet some of the Rabbis do dissent from this
exposition of the word, as Aben Ezra, R. Salom, R. Bechai, and others, and say
it is the same as (...) beno, i. his Son; But we know that all the Jews deny
that Christ the Messiah is come, and therefore their exposition is little to be
regarded. See Buxtorf: in Lexico Hebraeo, p. 812.

Additions to the first Book.
Page 34. lin. 2. etc. Add to the name Barjesus, Or else as it were (...)
barjeshang, i. the son of salvation, of (...) bar, Chald. a son, and (...)
jeshang, salvation; see the root p. 9. l. 5. Add also to the name Bartimaeus,
p. 35. l. 7. Jerome says it should be written Barsemeus, which in the Syriack
signifies a blind son, or the son of blindness, and that he was so called
because he was born blind, see Mark 10. v. 46. Page 168. l. 4. etc. Yea some of
the Rabbis do not dissent from this exposition of the word; and others, as
Aben Ezra, R. Bechai, etc. say it is the same as (...) beno, i. his son, which
exposition is not lightly to be regarded (for they acknowledge the place to be
spoken of the Messiah) although the Jews generally do deny that our Christ is
the Messiah that was to come. See Buxtorfius Lexicon, page 812. Basileae. 45.
