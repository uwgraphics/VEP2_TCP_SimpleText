Look about you.
TO the Noble and prime Champions of this Kingdoms Laws and liberties, the
right Honorable the Lords of the upper House of Parliament, is this my
Discourse directed; Look about you. To you I say in the first place, you being
highest in pre-eminence, do I shape my counsel; nor will you, I hope, despise
it: For, out of the mouths of Babes and Sucklings has God ordained strength
to still the Enemy and Avenger, Look about you: a short it is, but a most
patheticall axiom; for, if you right Honorable, who are the pillars which
support the reeling State of the Kingdom should not with a provident foresight
survey the events which threaten the peace and safety of the people, they were
likely to meet a sudden desolation and ruin. For your Honors wisdom must
needs perceive with what violent acrimonie and unjust proceedings the
Malignants about his Majesty aim at the ruins of your lives, fortunes and
honorable families; how they arm themselves, friends and followers for your
subversion, and utter extinguishment, they would not leave you, a light in this
our Israel, nor suffer you, to have any portion in the inheritance of your
forefathers, but sacrifice your lives and estates to that Idol of their own
setting up, namely, their own pride and naughtiness of heart, going about
like roaring Lions, seeking whom they may devour. It is time therefore for your
Honors to look about you.

It is perspicuous to every well-affected and judicious eye, that your Honors
have omitted no one point of discretion which might tend to the advancement of
the Commonwealth, to reclaim his Majesty from his perverse and malignant
Counselors, and to reunite him to the body of his Kingdom now assembled in
this honorable and prudent Parliament; but since not only your Councels are
despised and unhearkened to, but also forces perpetually raised at home,
machinations abroad attempted to bring in foreign forces, to transport arms
and ammunition into this Realm for the subduing your Honors, and overthrowing
that which you are in part instrusted withal (the liberty of the Subject) when
no endeavor for peace will succeed, but the noise of war must still thunder
through this Kingdom, rapines, plunderings and murders being daily committed
upon the persons and estates of the Subjects. Surely it is then no ill advice
to look about you. God in his great mercy has furnished your Lordships with
understanding hearts and valiant hands for the defense of your selves and the
people, now committed, as it were, to your charge, you are the Worthies, the
chosen men of might, to fight the battles of the Lord, and he bids you look
about you.

And now to you the Husbands of the Commonwealth, the honorable the Knights
and Burgesses assembled and elected by the peoples suffrage for the security of
their liberties, I may without offense say, look about you; you have beheld
how diverse of your most worthy and honorable members against the ancient
constitutions and privileges of Parliament have been called into question,
and by force and violence demanded in your House, where you sit to negotiate
and treat about the welfare of the Republi^^. your wisdoms do daily perceive
what slight value (^^s Majesty being misled by the pernicious counsels of his
Cavaliers) sets upon you and your proceedings. Your are sensible how much the
poor distressed Subject suffers, laboring even to death under the pressure
and weight of the malignants oppressions and devastations; there are rumors of
wars, how true I know not, from all the parts of this Kingdom, Papists (such
as ever have been, and continually will be, persecutors of the little flock of
Christ) who have by murders and powder-plots, fought the ruins of our Kings
and Potentates, brought into the field ready armed and abilited to do
mischief, and surely they will not spare the blood of the faithful; therefore
I may with modesty and pardon from your honorable wisdoms presume to say to
you, Look about you.

Dangers, as I said, that great King, and sweet Singer of Israel, and the
shadow of death had encompassed me round about, yet I feared nothing, for my
trust was in the Lord: your selves may apply that saying to your selves, though
(thanks be to God) these dangers have not yet come near you; for he has
protected you as the apple of the eye, and so will ever do against all
assaults of your enemies; it is for him you fight the battles of the Lord of
hosts, for the truth and security of his Gospel, and he will not suffer the
Sun to burn you by day, not the Moon by night: the counsels of the ungodly
shall be brought to naught before you, for he who is the Watchman of Israel
neither slumbereth nor sleeps; the eyes of the people are upon you, they have
appointed you the feoffees in trust for their liberties; and certainly they
will never revoke their act, but spend their lives and fortunes in the tutelage
of your just and honorable proceedings, they will be gathered together as one
man, even from Dan to Beersheba to destroy those wicked Benjamites that have
committed folly in Israel, to assist you against those wicked malignants, that
have too much wrought upon his Majesty's goodness, and sought to destroy the
essence of Parliaments, and you will be victorious over them, only look about
you.

And to your right Honorable the present Lord Mayor of this noble City of
London, and the well affected Aldermen your Brethren and Assistants, in all
humility I tender the same counsel, Look about you. You sit at the helm of
government in this famous City, the Metropolis of our Kingdom, and daily
behold a company of factious and pertinatious malignants, even among the
Inhabitants of this our Sion, who spurn at, and set at naught your good
endeavors, for the commodity not only of your City, but the whole
Commonwealth; let not their malicious practices or traducing language, hinder
or discourage you in the prosecution of your religious and legal proceedings,
authorized by order from both Houses of Parliament. It will be hard for them to
kick against pricks; Wolves may howl at the Moon, but their voices can
neither impeach it in its course, nor eclipse its brightness, their malice
will not hurt you, but just, as if they should spit against the wind, the filth
will return into their own faces; your known goodness will beat back their
calumnies upon themselves, howsoever trust them not, but Look about you.

Your have heard, and so have all this City, your honorable self, and some
other worthy and well-affected Citizens, desiree by his Majesty, as Delinquents
to be given up to imprisonment, let not that thunderbolt amaze you, it is far
enough, thanks be to God, from piercing you. In your discretions consists a
great part of the advancement of the present cause for the glory of God and
good of your Brethren; now your hand is put to the Lords ^^ough, pull it not
back, but endeavor cheerfully and courageously to animate the Citizens and
able persons resident within your walls, to contribute largely to the
maintenance of these wars, till an honorable and just peace, with which truth
may walk hand in hand, give a period (and no good man but wishes it) to all
these civil distractions, wars and tumults; howsoever forget not this axiom,
but wear it imprinted in the tables of your hearts, Look about you.

And you the wealthy and well-affected Citizens under the government and charge
of the said right Honorable the Lord Mayor and his Brethren, it principally
concerns you to look about you; you are the Indies which those bloodthirsty
Cavaliers have aimed at, your wealth, your plate, and other riches, which like
the Spaniards Indies, they have still made a reckoning should fall as a prey
into their fingers: and certainly they would use as little mercy to you here,
as the Spaniard did to them there; it is neither respect of kindred, friends or
acquantance that should any whit moderate the rapacity of their hands, or
licenciousnesse of their appetites, should they once gain the superiority in
these wars, and enter your goodly City by force, neither your wives or
beauteous daughters should escape their violent lusts, all that is dear and
precious to you would be given up a spoil to their avarice; and therefore I
say to you, Look about you, and do not like Aesops Dog in the Fable, catch
at the shadow, and forgo the substance; do not let a little covetousness of
saving part of your wealth make you forfeit the whole, but as the Israelites in
the Wilderness did consecrate all the Jewels of Gold and Silver with a
willing mind toward the building of the Tabernacle; so throw you in every one
out of the abundance of your store, plate and moneys, into the treasury of that
sanctuary of yours and the whole Kingdoms liberty, the Honorable the High
Court of Parliament, God will restore it you an hundred fold, since it is
chiefly intended for the promotion of his service, the rescuing His Excellent
Majesty from the inthralment of the Malignant party, and for the estabishment
of peace again in this our Israel; in this case therefore be wise and look
about you.

And lastly, to you the Nobility, Knights, Gentry, and Yeomanry, diffused and
dispersed through this Kingdom of England, to you I present the same lesson,
Look about you, you have already seen the calamities of your neighbors, and
felt your own; you have either had fire and sword in your own dwellings, or
heard of it in your friends and Fellow Subjects, not one County in this
populous Kingdom escaping the dreadful and pitilesse assaults of these
desperate and blood-minded Cavaliers; I may therefore with just reason advise
you to look about you: and whilst you have yet time left, associate your
selves to the faithful, and conform your actions to the proceedings and
directions of the High court of Parliament, send forth all the able young men
amongst you well prepared and harnessed for battle to their assistance against
these Malignants that study to inslave you, your estates and liberties; the
Parliament is the tower of your refuge, and under God, the strong hold and
castle of defense you must trust to; let not other hopes or pretenses deceive
you, but submit your judgments to theirs, whose wisdoms will breed your
welfare and tranquillity; willingly impart your estates, and lives if need be,
to their defense and protection, who will defend and protect your freedoms and
livelihoods from all dangers, and make this Kingdom flourishing and fortunate
by their institution of Gods Laws for the security of the Subject, which will
in happy time be brought to good effect, if you take my poor and humble
counsel, Look about you.

FINIS.
