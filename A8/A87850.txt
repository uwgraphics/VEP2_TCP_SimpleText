A DECLARATION OF William Lenthall, Esquire; SPEAKER OF THE HONORABLE HOUSE OF
COMMONS. SHOWING The Grounds and Reasons which moved him to absent himself
from attending the service of the House on Friday the 30th of July, 1647.

LONDON; Printed by M. S. for George Whittington. 1647.

A DECLARATION OF THE SPEAKER OF THE House of COMMONS: Of the Grounds, and
Reasons, which moved him to absent himself, from attending the service of the
HOUSE on Friday the 30. of July, 1647.
ALthough it may happily be contrary to the expectation of some, that I attend
not the Service of the House of Commons, at this time, as I have constantly
done, for almost seven years last past, and yet can it not be reasonably
expected by any, that well consider the violence offered to both the Houses of
Parliament, and to my self in particular on Monday; In so much that I can
safely take it upon my conscience, and so I doubt not, may all the Members of
both Houses also, that they sat in continual fear of their lives, and by
terror thereof were compelled to pass such Votes, as it pleased an unruly
multitude to force upon them, which, as I did then openly declare in the House,
so I cannot but believe that they are void, and null, being extorted by force,
and violence, and in that manner that they were, and I cannot any longer
dispense with my self, to be an Instrument in passing such Votes, or to give
any color, or shadow of Parliamentary Authority unto them, which are not the
Votes of the representative body of the Kingdom, but of a tumultuous
multitude, as those must needs be accounted, that seemed to pass the House on
monday last, and which shall pass hereafter, until better provision be made,
for the safe and free sitting of the Houses of Parliament, there being no
effectual course taken by the City, since the last adjournment of the Houses,
to prevent the like tumults for the future; no, nor so much as a Declaration
from them, to show their dislike thereof. But on the contrary, it is generally
voiced in the Town, there will be a far greater confluence of Apprentices,
Reformadoes, and others, on Friday, at the Parliament doors, and particularly,
notice was given to me, that after they had made the House Vote what they
pleased, they would destroy me, I had likewise information given me, that
there would be a great number of Apprentices; of a contrary opinion, and
affections to the other, about the Parliament doors on Friday morning, which I
foresaw, must of necessity cause a great combustion, and in probability
occasion much blood shed, the preventing of which mischiefs, together with the
consideration aforesaid, have weighed more with me then any thing which may
concern my partiticular, and especially having served the House faithfully and
deligently, for the space of very near seven years in a free and Parliamentary
way of proceedings; that I might not now be made a servant to such a multitude,
to transfer upon them the color of Parliamentary authority, there with all
to abuse and deceive the minds, and to destroy the Lives, Liberties, and
estates of the people of this Kingdom; and having taken a Solemn Protestation
and Covenant, in my place and calling to maintain the Privileges of
Parliament, and the Rites and Liberties of the Subjects: I would not now
satisfy my self, but by absenting my self at this time, rather then by my
presence to give any shadow, or countenance, of the authority of Parliament, to
such apparent violations thereof; Neither can the omission of a circumstance,
or some formality in the adjournment of the House (when through force and
violence it cannot meet and sit in any sort as a Parliament) be any prejudice
to the future meeting, and proceedings thereof, when it may meet and sit again
as a free Parliament; It being well known, that nothing can dissolve this
Parliament, but an Act of Parliament.

When a Company of Apprentices, Reformadoes, and others, shall call the
Ordinances of Parliament pretended Ordinances, shall lock the doors of the
Houses upon them, shall swear not to let them out till they had passed what
they pleased concerning the Militia of London, and other things (though the
Houses had immediately before voted otherwise) shall threaten the Houses in case
they did not instantly satisfy their demands, shall knock, without, and hollow
continually at the Parliament doors that the members could not be heard speak
or debate, and after that the House of Commons had passed a Vote concerning the
Militia of London, and that the Speaker by the voice had judged the major part
to be for the negative, shall not suffer the House to be divided, but in a
threatening way require those that gave their Votes against them, to consent to
them, if they would, when after the House was adjourned, they shall by maine
force thrust back the Speaker again into the House, and force the Members in
their presence and sight (diverse of them thrusting into the House) to vote what
they demanded; when they shall justle, pull, and hale the Speaker all the way
he went down to his Coach, and force him to avoid their violence to betake
himself to the next Coach he could get into for refuge, when they shall breath
forth such bloody threats against the Members as they came forth of the House,
and since against me in particular at the next meeting of the House, (as I am
credibly informed) and when there is no appearance, but that they will continue
to do as formerly they have done, or far worse on Friday, I could not in
discharge of my Trust, Protestation, and Covenant, sit in the Chair of the
House of Commons, whilst it shall be in such a condition. But so soon as it
may sit again in freedom, and safety, I shall be ready to attend the service
thereof: but till then, as I have upon the forementioned grounds fully
satisfied my own conscience, so I doubt not but I shall give the whole
Kingdom (whose interest is most concerned in it) ample satisfaction in the
necessity of my absence.

William Lenthall, Speaker.
