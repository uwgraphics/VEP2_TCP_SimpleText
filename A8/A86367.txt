Hinds Elder Brother, or the Master-Thief discovered, being a pithy relation of
the life of Major Thomas Knowls, his many escapes, cheats, and witty Robberies.
Of his Birth and Education.
THe greatest certainty of the place of his Birth, is to most uncertain, he not
being able to give any exact account by reason his Parents died so much in his
minority, but left to the care of some friends in Lealand Parish in Lancashire,
which care of theirs extended it self to nothing more then how to be rid of
him, which he to their desires effected in the age of fourteen coming here to
London, where he had not been many days a mendicant, but he is entertained by
Punteus the Mountebank, who then was newly come into England.

Of his serving the Mountebank
HE had not long been with the Mountebank (but a witty rogue) he was so
dexterous grown in his profession, that he added much to the Sale of his
Masters Antidotes, by his witty Jests, Boufoonish behavior, and nimble
vaultings, so that he became chief man to Punteus, and who is the Gentleman
now, but Mr. Johan a pudding.

Of his curing an Usurer of the Toothach.
A Rich Usurer being much tormented with the Toothach and not willing to be at
too much Charge in procuring his Ease, came to Mr. Punteus his Lodging,
thinking to have his cure for little or nothing, (by reason that Punteus drew
many poor men's teeth that were afflicted out of charity) and enquiring for the
French Doctor of the Maid of the house, she presently goes up to the Chamber,
where she finds Knowls and his Comrade fitting themselves with false Beards,
and Antic apparel for the next days show, she acquaints them, that there was
an Usurer at the door to speak with their Master, and as she thought by the
muffling of his Chops to have some Remedy for his teeth, whereupon Knowls cries
out to his Comrade, a prise, now off with this party colored Coat, Give me my
Masters Gown, fasten m^ on that black Beard, stand bare, and keeping your
countenance call up the Usurer, up comes the Patient relates his malady, and as
a poor man invokes a remedy, which Knowls out supposed Punteus, says he will
apply his best skill for Gods sake, and setting the Usurer down, views his
tooth, and says I shall do the cure, but you must have a little patience, for
it is a very forked one; his man employed his time so well, that whiles Knowls
pulled out the tooth, he pulled out of his pocket a Cats skin Purse with twenty
nine pounds, two Rings, and a Watch. The Cure being effected, Knowls demands
something for his pains, the Usurer replies, (the Maid being by) with an Oath
that he had not one penny, nor the value about him of one farthing, nay says
Knowls, since you swear before witness, I am content, God speed you well, and
so departs my Usurer, little thinking Knowls had been so well paid.

Knowls thought this Robbery was but just,
To rob the man that no body would trust,
Who for to save a little of his Pelf,
Before witness, basely forswears himself,
This was the cause that he never came
Back unto Knowls, his money lost to claim,
Being o'rcome with perjury and shame.
How Knowls robbed the Scotch Commissioners, when they lay at Somerset House.
KNowls having a great desire to finger some of the Scoth Commissioners money,
by reason he had heard they had received abundance, though for a little desert,
either in them or their Army. He plots many ways, but none takes effect; at
last he takes a shoulder Trumpet, flings it under his Cloak, he being in black,
very neat, more like a Scotch Lord then a Trumpeter, and away he marches to
the Gate, where he finds several Trumpeters, Waits, and others at Push a Pike
with the Porter, who valiantly defended himself in the behalf of his Lairds
Pouch, Knowls makes his approach, saying, how now honest Porter, What are these
fellows, Fools or Fiddlers? O my Saul are they, quoth the Porter, wad year good
worship speak wi my Lord, yes quoth Knowls, I have affairs of importance to
comunicate to thy Lord; mary and ye even sall ple^se year good worship to gang
along wi me, so with that, in enters Knowls with the Porter, who goes and
acquaints his Lord, the Lord Lowden, that there was a Gentleman to speak with
his Honor. Lowden comes into the ^ining Room; where he finds Knowls attending:
who addresses himself unto my Lord Commissioner, saying, my Lord, I am Master
Trumpeter to the Navy, under the Command of Earl of Warwick and being sent
hither to furnish the Fleet with Trumpets, I am charged by the Earl who lies
now upon the Downs to salute your Honors, in troth Sir, replies Lowden, I am
even blyth to hear his Lordship is in good health, calling to his Porter,
saying, Saundy, gar Jeamy give this Gentleman forty Shillings, and with a
Congee departs into his Chamber, the Servants being affrighted at the unwelcome
Guest they had brought their Lord, some runs one way some another, leaving
Knowls alone in the dining room, who in a moment dismantles the cupboard of a
large quantity of Plate being fled before the Porter or Jeamy could come with
the forty shillings, who upon their finding the plate gone, cried out to a
woeful Tune O Black day, the false Lown has beguiled us aw, little wist I I
quoth the porter, that his Worship was a piper: the Dell blaw's Baggs, mi
Livings gene, but the tumults continued so long amongst the Bullies, that
Knowls had convenient time to escape.

Thus witty Knowls did borrow plate,
O those which cozened King and State.
The one they sold, the others thought to cheat,
But now repent, since they are sound^y beat,
How Knowls left his Majer the Mountebank, turned Cutter and robbed Hind.
KNowls having a desire no longer to be a servant, if he could devise any how
to live a Master, and having gained a pretty sum under the Mountebank, he
takes his leave of him, and resolves to live a brother of the Blade, huyes him
a pretty highway Nag, a good Sword and Case of private Pistolls (away goes my
Friend to the Road) and now Gentlemen beware your Portmantles) many exploits
our Mounsieur Abbot plays, for so he is called now) in Lincoln shire Notingham
and other places, and one night coming into the Lion Inn at Worship, eight
miles from Mansfield, the Hostler takes his Horse, he passes under the notion
of a Grasier, and is by the said Hostler set to Hind (for one that was possessed
with a good round sum) that night they supped together, being ignorant one of
the others Calling, the next day in Welbeck Forest Hind overtakes our
Mounsieur, claps a plstol to his breast, wishing him immediately to deliver his
purse, or life and purse together, Knowls seeing death at the Collar of his
Doublet, wisely replies, in faith Sir, I have a sum of money about me, which
I do not value near comparable with my life, therefore here take it, delivering
to Hind a leather Bag, with fourscore and od pounds in it, and Sir, believe me,
Since you have done so gallantly, as to adventure a^^^^ upon me I swear to you,
I will never prosecute you, therefore, never shun me, wheresoever you see me,
and riding on together, a little along the Forest, he says, being in
discourse, I pray Sir tell me one t^ing, Hind replying, said he would, then
says Knowls, pray you had you any thing in that pistol you clapped to my
Breast, or did you it to affright me, nay says Hind, God damn me, it is
charged with a Brace of Bullets, and thereupon slaps off his pistol, which
Knowls perceiving, claps one of his to Hinds throat, saying, now return back my
money with wh^t addition you can make of your own, or by Jove you die, so he
dismantled Mr. Hind of all his money riding away crying, farewell younger
Brother.

Thus Hind which knew the cutting Trade so well,
Was robbed by Knowls who did him far excel
In the highway arts, and in the padding skill,
For Hind's in Newgate, and Knowls at freedom still
How Knowls being brought a Prisoner in the Habit of a Parson to White Hall
made his Escape.
KNowls being taken by one of the Thieftakers about this Town, was brought to
White Hall, and there upon the Guard secured that night, the next day secured
in a Chamber, having two Soldiers Sentries upon him, shortly after being
examined, he was asked what made him assume that Habit, being he could neither
write nor read, he replied the rather because he thought no man would suspect
an illiterate man in such a Coat, and after some questions he was remanded back
to the said Custody, where after liberally giving all sorts of Liquours to the
two Soldiers his Guard, he seeing them in a merry mood, thus began to speak,
dear Comrades and fellow Soldiers, you may perceive, this is only through
malice, that I am here a Prisoner, Since I have never done any thing against
the State, yet there is one thing vexes me to the Soul, what is that Master
answered the Soldiers, marry quoth Knowls, I have fifty pounds in the hands of
the man that keeps the Leg in the palace yard, and I would willingly give
ten pounds to a good fellow, that I had it here, one of the Soldiers replies,
Sir I will fetch it you with a good will, nay nay, says Knowls, that cannot
be, for he will not give it to any body but my self, yet I can tell you what we
may do, one of you put on my Habit here, and I will put on your Red Coat and
Bandileers, the other take his Musket, and go along with me, and so in less
then half an hour, we will be back with the money, and I will give you five
pounds apiece for your pains, the matter being thus carried, you can no ways
be found in blame, this conceit takes, away marches Knowls and one of the
Soldiers, the other lies down upon the bed in his Parsons weed, they march to
Westminster, come into the Leg, call for a pot of Ale, which is brought them,
Knowls he demands for the Master of the House, who comes immediately, he takes
him aside, whispers him in the Ear, thrusting half a Crown in his hand, saying,
Sir, I would not that my Comrade should know I have any money, but whilst we
drink, pay your self out of this, and saying, shall it be so carried, the man
of the House not suspecting any thing, replyies aloud, you shall you shall Sir,
and so departs the Room, Knowls turns to the Soldier, come Brother, let us
drink one half dozen, and by that time the money will be told out, further
saying, truly this man of the House is a very honest man, now by that time they
had drunk four or five pots, the Soldier begins to ask why the Master of the
House came not his way, Knowls having the Pot of Ale in his hand, suddenly
flings the pot violently in the soldiers face, knocking him down, crying
aloud, Villain do thou say, my Captain is a Coward, I would have thee know, I
have so much of a soldier in me, that I Will die before I hear my Officer abused,
but I Will have the Corporal to fetch thee to the Guard with a Pox, and so
running out of the house, before the soldier recovered Knowls had crossed the
water, and so clearly escaped.

Let Knowls his slipperie trick example be
To all those Guards which love a fee,
Least he may chance to have the same reward
For coveting Coin as had this foolish Guard,
The one in Parsons weeds the Gantlet run,
The other being Cashiered was quite undone.
How Knowls being Captain of the Pioners to the Scotch Army escaped from
Worcester.
KNowls having Command of the Pio^ers at Worcester, upon their being routed he
calls to him one of the C^untrey-men which he had pressed for a pioner not many
days before, and one whom he had noted to be a monstrous silly fellow, saying,
alas for you poor hearts, for you will have no quarter, the enemy saves none
but officers, upon which words the fellow was ready to sink, but Knowls says
come courage, give me thy Pickax and Cassock, and here take my Sword, Buff
Coat, and Hat, and I will run for it, for I am lighter of foot then thou art,
whereupon they change and by that means Knowls escapes the Parliaments forces
entering the Town, some Troops enters the house where this Country man was who
presently cries out, save my life Gentlemen, for I am Major Knowls, Captain of
the Pioners, I quoth the soldier I will give you quarter, but I will pay your
skin for a tumbling rogue, and knocked him soundly, stripped him naked, and turned
him amongst the rest of the prisoners.

THus Reader, in this small Epitome,
Some Acts of famous Kmowls I have showed thee,
Which if considered rightly thou will find,
In witty pranks he far exceeds our Hind:
And as from murder he was always free,
So stands he clear from all base Treachery
Toward any of the Pad or cutting Trade,
As being now the only knight of the Blade;
Of many a Gang he is the sole surviver,
So of many a feat he has been the main contriver;
Then let Hind and Guzman both submit
To active Knowls for valor shifts and wit.
FINIS.
