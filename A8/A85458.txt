GEORGE Lord GORING, General of all His Majesty's Forces of Horse, that are,
or shall be raised in the Kingdom of England and Dominion of Wales, and
Lieutenant-Generall to His Highness Prince Rupert of this Western Army.
Whereas diverse Inhabitants of this County, and the County of Sommerset, under
a pretense of securing themselves from the Plundring of the Soldier have
assembled themselves in a tumultuous manner, and have not only denied all such
Ayds, and Contributions as they have formerly paid, and as has been of late
necessary for the support of His Majesty's Forces, but also have adhered unto
the Enemy, some out of their own Disloyalty, and others being seduced by the
cunning and malignity of ill-affected persons; These are to declare unto all
persons whatsoever, That if any such violence, or plundring has been used by
the Soldier, it has neither been tolerated by the principal Officers, nor
have any persons that offended in that kind escaped unpunisht with Death, when
complaint and due proof has been made thereof: And if any such injuries shall
be done by any of this Army, to any persons whatsoever hereafter, severity of
Justice shall pass upon them that appear to be guilty in the least degree* And
to the end that the Army may be as well supplied with Necessaries as the
Country protected from violence; These are, in His Majesty's Name, straightly
to require all persons, that lately, under the name of Clubmen, or otherwise,
of their own accord, or by the persuasions, or compulsion of the Enemy, have
taken up Arms* or have appeared at any tumultuous or rebellious Assemblies, in
the Counties of Devon or Sommerset, or any ways adhered to, or assisted the
Enemy, or opposed His Majesty's Forces in the levying of the usual Rates, or
Contributions, or Provisions for the supply of His Majesty's Army, or
Garrisons, forth with to desist from the same, and to render and submit
themselves, and to bring in their Arms, either into this Army, or into any of
His Majesty's Forts, or Garrisons that are nearest to them, within two days
after the publication hereof, in their several Hundreds. And as I shall
proceed against such persons as Enemies to the Good and Peace of these
Counties, that shall either adhere openly to the Enemy, or assist them with any
kind of Provisions or Supplies, or refuse to obey all such Warrants as shall be
sent them from the Commanders of His Majesty's Armies, or Garrisons, for the
necessary supply of both, or forsake any of their Houses upon the approach of
His Majesty's Forces; so I shall endeavor to protect these, to the uttermost
of my power, against all force, or violence whatsoever, that appear ready to
supply His Majesty's Army, and join with it for the defense of their Counties.

Dated at Exon the 20. day of September, 1645. GEORGE GORING.
God save the King.
