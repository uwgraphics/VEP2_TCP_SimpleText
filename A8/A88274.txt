Lillies Banquet: or, the Star-gazers Feast, With the manner and Order how
every Dish is to be placed upn his great Table at Christmus, for all Sects and
sorts of persons, both Presbyterians, Independants, Anabaptists, Quakers,
Shakers, Seekers and Tearers.


ALL you that have not had a cold,
mark well what I shall say,
I shall invite you for to dine,
with me on Christmas Day.
Each Dish shall be in order,
erected on the board,
The Cheer which you shall surely have,
might entertain a Lord.
First Aries for all Cuckolds,
a stately horned Ram,
Shall be provided for them,
believe me it is no flam,
Come all you doting Citizens,
and hold it not in scorn,
For every man must have his lot,
exalting of the Horn.
There is a sort of Wittals,
whom females neatly gull,
I will provide them Taurus,
a lusty Rampant Bull,
All fools must have their fortunes,
the Stars do so decree,
Then if your wives love Venus sport,
blame neither them nor me.
The Twins shall be for shem that have,
before their Wedding day,
A chopping Boy a smooth-faced Girl,
such chance fall in play,
The virtue of this trebble Dish,
(the Moon Peing past the wain)
For she that is lost her Maidenhead,
'twill help her to it again.
Next Cancer for all Lovers,
to harbor in your breast,
Both Faith and troth established sure,
(by Cupid this is dressed)
The Lion for all men of might,
sole Master of the heart,
But let that Knave go hang himself,
that acts a Judas part,
Old gor-bellied Marriot,
is now deceast and gone,
Else he should dine with Virgo,
but now he is like to have none,
And Libra is for Fiddlers News,
who are willing for to fall,
For whilst their Husbands are at play,
they'I dance at up-tailes all.
Come all you pretty Lasses,
that loves the lovely sport,
Here Is Scorpio for your diet.
you love it by report;
Fall ou fine Turnball Ladies,
let Pimps your actions note,
And Taffie shall have Barracouse,
besides his horned Goat.
Then Sagitarius next,
(a very wholesome smell)
Shall be provided for them,
who loves good Mutton well,
And Capricorn is good
to rectify the knees,
Thus shall you have your dishes all,
in order by degrees.
Two Legs of Mutton is good fare*
Aquaris is the meat,
Which Watermen by Ratcliff-Cross,
for custom use to eat,
Poer-John is for the Butter-box,
or Pisces which you will,
These 12. for you I must have dressed,
pray come and eat your fill.
A dish of ponts for sullen folks,
I Will set upon the Table,
With sour look and frowning brows,
fall on whilst you are able,
A Mess of scu^vy ^^ckled Tongues,
and m^^^dring broth is good,
To see before a crew of Scods,
that ever heat their blood,
For crabbed faces you shall have
a dish of buttered Crabs,
Some worm wood drink that is mixed with gall,
shall be a drink for Drabs:
Thus have you here your Diet,
my Tables shall be free,
For them who have not had a Cold,
shall come and dine with me.
FINIS.
