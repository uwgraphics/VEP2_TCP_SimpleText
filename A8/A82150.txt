A DECLARATION of the Freeborn people of ENGLAND, now in Arms against the
Tyranny and Oppression of OLIVER CROMWELL Esquire.
BEing satisfied in our Judgments and Consciences of the present necessity to
take up Arms for the defense of our Native Rights and Freedoms, which are
wholly invaded and swallowed up in the Pride and Ambition of OLIVER CROMWELL Esquire
who calls himself Lord Protector of ENGLAND, and has rendered all Englishmen
no better than his Vassals: We expect to be branded with the infamous name of
Rebels and Traitors, or to be misrepresented both to the Army, City, and
Country, as Common Enemies, Disturbers of the Public Peace, Arbitrary
Cavaliers, or under some other odious notion, that may provoke the Army and
People to endeavor our destruction: But if we may prevail to be heard before
we be Condemned and Executed, We shall submit our cause, and the righteous end
we seek, to the judgment of the Army, and every honest English Man, and if the
Army it self (according to their many engagements) will undertake (and their
strength be sufficient) to redeem Us from Our present slavery, and settle that
Right and Freedom, unto which Our birth gave Us title, we shall readily lay
down our present ARMS.

The whole Christian world knows that our English Earth has been drunk with
Blood these twelve years, through the great contest for Right and Freedom, and
the whole Treasure of the Nation exhausted in that quarrel. How then can any
Man, whose Hand or Heart has been engaged in that Bloody contest, either
acquit himself to God, his Conscience, or his Country, in yiedling up tamely
and silently all the Laws, Rights and Liberties of England, into an Usurpers
hand? We have for many years patiently borne all kinds of Oppression,
Arbitrarinesse and Tyranny, and suffered under such heavy burdens of Excise
and Taxes, as England never knew in former ages, having been fed by him that
now calls himself Lord Protector, and his Army, with specious pretenses, and
most alluring promises (seconded with many Appeals to God for their integrity
of heart in them) that true English Liberty, should be settled and secured,
Impartial Justice provided for, Arbitrary Power abolished, and every yoke of
Oppression broken, and every Burden eased: And we did believe, as they told
us, that our present sufferings, were only like a rough stormy passage, to the
Haven of Justice, Right, and Freedom: We could not suspect these ambitious
designs in Cromwell, and his Confederates, that are now proclaimed to the
World: We could not think it possible, that a Man of such mean Quality and
Estate as he, should aspire to make himself an absolute Lord and Tyrant over
three potent Nations: But above all, his pretended zeal for God and his People,
his high professions of Godliness, Simplicity, and Integrity, his
Hypocritical Prayers, and days of Fasting to seek the Lord, his dissembled
humility and meekness, and his frequent compassionate tears upon every
occasion, We say, These things, together with his Engagements public and
private, his most Solemn Protestations, with Imprecations of Vengeance upon
Himself and Family, if he dissembled, and his most frequent Appeals to God
for the truth of his Professions and Declarations; That he designed nothing but
the securing the Liberty of Gods people, and the administration of Impartial
justice, and sought no Power, Honor, Riches or Greatness to Himself or any
particular Party or Interest: We say, these things rocked us asleep, with the
pleasant Dreams of Liberty and Justice, until he has made a Sacrifice of all
our Laws, Liberties, and Properties, unto his own Ambition. And now he is not
afraid to own what he before disclaimed, and Declared against; He that
formerly Protested before the Dreadful God, and to the Long Parliament, That
He and his Army should be wholly subject to their Civil Authority, and that
whosoever should attempt any violence against them should make their way
through his Blood, He now ownes the breaking them in pieces with scorn and
contempt. He that declared so much Humility and Selfe-denyall, claims and owns
a Power supreme to Parliaments, and exercises an Absolute Dominion over the
Laws and Estates of Three Nations: He that seemed so zealous for Liberty, now
dares own every private English Man his Vassal, and their Parliaments his
Slaves: He publishes in Print in his own Speeches to his Parliaments, that
the benefit that all English Men have in the execution of any Laws amongst
them is from Him, and that the Authority which their Parliaments have, and
shall have, is only derived from Him: He has published in the whole world,
that he has dissolved all civil Government, and that He had in himself
alone, an absolute unlimited Arbitrary power, without check or control, until
He put some limits upon Himself (if he may be believed in his paper of
Government.) Now what Patroon in Algier, ever claimed more Mastery over his
Slaves bought in the Market, then this claim of Cromwells extends unto over
Us: If We have the benefit of the execution of no Laws but from Him, then all
the Rights, Privileges, and Estates we have, are enjoyed by his mercy only,
and without the execution of Laws, no man has more right to Lands, or Goods,
then another, nor is any man's life under any security, if another be stronget
than he. So that Cromwell ownes and professes, that the bread that every man
eats is by his Mercy: And if his Power was without limit (as he says) until
he had put some bounds, then it is of his Grace and Favor only, that all
English Men have now a seeming right in their Wives, Children, Servants, Lives,
and Estates, if his own limits of his Power gives any such right: And if he
please to throw away, (or burn by the hand of the Hangman) his Limits in his
paper of Government, who can trouble him? He may do what he list with things
of his own making; It Is the old English proverb, he that can bind can loose;
And he may do what he list also with the Authority of Parliaments, if it be as
he says, of his own giving: Now wherein does a Patroons Power over his
purchased Slave, exceed this which Cromwell ownes over Us? The Patroone can but
give the Slave his Laws, his Clothes, his Meat, his Life, and all this
Cromwell ownes to have given us, only he speaks it in such language as sounds
not so harshly.

Now after the expense of so much Christian blood, for the settling the Rights
and Liberties due unto Us, as Men and Christians; when he that was trusted with
an Army for that purpose, has so unworthily betrayed his trust, spilt Innocent
Blood like Water, falsified all his Declarations, Promises, Protestations and
Oaths, and assumed to himself such a dominion over our Country, as is
destructive to all Right and Liberty, and renders Us and Our Posterities,
Slaves to him and his Successors, with a payment of a Fifth (or thereabouts) of
our Estates certain in Taxes to be intailed upon our Posterities, besides other
burdens We appeal to the Conscience of every honest Man, whether a present
Necessity, and an incumbent Duty be not upon us to Arm our selves in defense of
our ancient Laws, and dearest birthrights, against the present Impostor and
Usurper: And we hope most of the present Army have not extinguished their Love
to their Countries Freedom (although Cromwells Hypocritical professions,
Prayers and Tears, have much deluded them) but that they will readily concur
with Us, and other honest English men in our present attempt, by force of Arms
to redeem our Country out of the Usurpers bonds, and to seek those righteous
ends, which we do hereby declare to be those, for which we now hazard our
Lives, and with which we shall rest satisfied, and return to our homes in
peace: And they are these following. viz.

I. That all Assumed and Usurped Powers and Authorities over our Country may be
utterly abolished. II. That the Government may be settled upon a just Basis,
with the due Bounds and Limits to every Magistrate. III. That the Ancient
Liberties of ENGLAND settled by Magna Charta, the Petition of Right, and other
Laws, may be secured inviolably: That no man's person may be molested,
imprisoned, restrained or touched, without a Legal cause shown in the Warrant,
whereby he is molested or restrained, (and that also in a due course of the
Laws known proceedings, without countermands from the will of any man) whereas
now men's Persons are troubled and restrained at will, and destroyed by long
Imprisonments, no man knows for what: And also that no man's Estate may be
liable to any disposal or prejudice, but by the known Laws of the Land, and
the lawful judgment of his Equals. IV. That Free Successive Parliaments may be
settled, with times of their Beginning and Ending, and with their Ancient Power
and Privileges: And that the Jurisdictive Power which Parliaments have taken
upon them to exercise in these times of War and Distraction, (by taking upon
them the judgment of particular Causes concerning men's Persons and Estates,
sometimes by their Committees, and sometimes by themselves, contrary to the
known proceedings of the Law) That such Power (we say) may be Declared
against, and secure Provision made against the same: That thereby Parliaments
may be free from the temptations of Profit, Friendship, and all private
Interests, by which only they can be corrupted. V. That the Militia of the
Nation may be so disposed, that no man may be able to be Absolute Master of
Parliaments; And also that secure provision may be made, That no Parliament
shall make it self Perpetual, and inslave the People to them.
And that such a Settlement may be made of Right and Freedom, and these our
ends obtained, and a Peace firmly established, we know no means, under God, but
a truly FREE PARLIAMENT.

Now for the defense of these our Rights and Liberties, we are resolved to
expose our Lives to the utmost hazards; And we shall neither wrong nor oppose
any man who does not join himself to the present Usurper to destroy or
prevent these our righteous ends: And though we have reason to belive, That no
person fearing GOD, or of Conscience, Honor, or Reason, can satisfy himself
to shed our innocent blood for seeking these things, yet however we shall
commit our selves and our just cause to the tuition of the righteous God, and
hope in his mercy, That our endeavors may procure Justice, Freedom, Peace,
and Settlement unto this distracted Nation.

FINIS.
