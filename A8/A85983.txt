Now seeing that Germany, by reason of such abominations, sins, unbelief,
and unrighteousnes which has taken the upper hand, is so far gone to ruin in
men and beasts, for an example unto other Countries, therefore I signify but
especially unto the Lords and chief men of the Kingdoms of England, Scotland,
and Ireland according to the justice of God, from the supreme Judge, unto whom
the Heavens and Earth belongs, according Esaias 66. Heb. 4. ^0. Joel 2. 1 These

to my former writings directed and sent to them, yet Once, that that they enter
deep into their hearts and consciences, to put away and remove thence all
works of darkness, which offend God and the Holy Spirit, and become sober
from them, and also remove the causes of the external unquietness or
division, according to the true ground, and out of a Christian love, and
unfeigned faith, as they are bound before God, to give aid and help, that their
Neighbor, or their fellow members, viz. the poor and 1 Cor 12. Rom 12. Jerem.

delivered, Dan. 12. But if they shall fail in this, then shall the same God,

The Heathen or false Christians, yea rather the Devils Christians in Germany,
have indevoured to do the same unto God in the Heavens, and his servant David,
whom God in this present and last time has raised here on Earth for the
honor of his holy name, and for the Truth and eternal Righteousness of God;
which the Jews did formerly unto their King: whereupon they in many Countries
have so fared for a great while, that the one has been forced to devour the
other, far worse then in the destruction of Jerusalem. But the remnant which
yet spurn against God, persevering still in their obstinacy and contempt of
God, and thinking to be hidden from the eyes of the Majesty of God, never so
much as endeavoring to put out of their hearts and consciences their vain
devices, their sins, their unbelief, and unrighteousness, which formerly
was crept in, nor any ways willing to give any outward aid and assistance,
that this ruin, according to righteousness may be removed, that remnant, I
say, shall Genesis 6. 7. 19. Epist. Jude. Jer. 30. 2 Pet. 3.
have the same God, who drowned the first world through the Deluge, and
destroyed the Cities Sodom and Gomorrha with fire and brimstone from heaven,

not believe, that the most-high had power and dominion over the Kingdoms

which they shall not escape. And if all Christian Kings shall not, in humility
of mind and conscience before God, afford help and assistance, that Zion may
be built, and further destruction, (which even in most Kingdoms is now Heb. 6.

they shall have the same God, who lies not, Mal. 3. such a consuming fire, as

Ye are the Officers of my Kingdom, says God, who gives life and breath to
every man: but those Gods who have not made Heaven and Earth, who are become
vain in their imaginations, detaining the truth in unrighteousness, nay all
Heathens or kingdoms, who will not serve God, or help thereto, that Zion may
be built, the poor and fatherles delivered, the miserable and needy ones
obtain justice, the afflicted and distressed rescued and freed from the
violence of the wicked, or hands of the oppressors; those, I say, shall perish
and be rooted out from the Earth, and from under the Heavens, Jerem. 10.

those parts have already long since been called upon, according to the justice
of the Lord, by reason of the miseries in Germany. But the everlasting (Revel.
19. Esa. 63.) and fierce wrath of God, Romans 1. and his vengeance and judgment,
2 Thessalonians. 1. shall not only in one respect alone, but double and treble fall
upon those mockers and despisers, who blaspheme the right of the Lord, and
pervert all what is upright, going about to build Zion with blood, Mich. 3.

and Jerusalem with unrighteousness, robbing the poor of his sweat and blood,
and bringing thereby him, viz. their own Land and their subjects therein, into
total ruin and destruction; and moreover suffer their neighbors or
fellow members, who, according 1 Cor. 13. Rev. 17. 18. Dan. 12. 1 John 3.
to the justice and judgment of God, might, could and ought to have been
delivered, with body and soul, to perish. Therefore this Cains-generation had
best to observe well this power, commandment and message of God, not only
according to this, but also many other and former writings sent thither, in the
behalf Mich. 3. Heb. 4. 10. 11. Eccles. 35.

Hosea 4. Col. 1. and 2.
There is but One Only God, viz. the same, who, through the hand of his Divine
Power, has of Nothing, Created the Heavens, the Earth, the Seas, and all that
therein is* Whom that People, which names it self after his holy Name, should
justly before all other people, honor, praise, serve and fear, Hosea 13.

But these Heathen who brag of Christianity, and yet most obstinately and
presumptuously will be counted the Only people of God, are in their hearts and
consciences so possessed and blinded by the Prince of this World* viz the
spirit of Eternal darkness, that they are altogether unmindfull and careless
of the Eternal, Infinite and Invisible God; nay, they will not so much as
acknowledge Him amongst them, in the vain and cursed Doctrine of those false
Teachers, whom they have chosen to themselves, nor according to the power and
truth of his Living Word, in regard of these present works and deeds.

Seeing that God in his Word long since faithfully enough, has given warning,
carefully to take heed and to beware of the false Prophets, viz. of those
horrible ravening Wolves in sheeps clothing, who, with their contentious
pratings and disputing, are the very prime and principal cause of all
division, distraction, concision, confusion and seduction, Esa 3. and 10. chap.
Ezech. 13.

God speaks in his Word that the true believers being Members of his Body,
ought to be compacted, built and rooted together, through the Bond of Peace,
and the Love of God.

But the Devil, through the mouth of the false Prophets in the stone-Churches
and Chapels, or carnal Congregations, says; Here is Christ, there is
Christ: Here is the Temple of the Lord, here is the Temple of the Lord: Come
hither and hear us, and let your sins be forgiven you, etc. and all this to
that people which has lost and forsaken Christ the Head of the Church and
Savior of his Body, according to his Eternal, Divine and Undivisible Power
and Virtue.

Now although God (richly and) abundantly has warned the Heathen as well as
the Jewish Nation, not to be haughty and proud in their unbelief; yet
notwithstanding they being in and through all Cities and Countries, yea
through all Realms, as Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Holland and other places
divided one from another Acts 4. Rev. 18. 2 Pet. 2. Ezeck. 13. Matthew. 7. Rev.

in the very abisse or depth of their souls, or having no spiritual communion
of God any more amongst them; they, I ^ay, dream and imagine to have a way to
the Father into the everlasting Kingdom of God, without Christ the unity in
the Spirit, or foundation of Faith, by the damned arch-witchcraft of their
false Teachers, Priests, and Prophets, being never either sent or known of
God, as if they with those false Apostles, by which Satan the very Devil
transformeth himself into an Angel of light, had the truth, and God should be
their liar, who long since has foretold the state and condition of this
present, last, and lamentable time, viz. that Faith should be extinguished,
love by many grow cold, and unrighteousness get the upper hand.

But seeing that these people wholly neglect and despise the Lord of Sabbath
concerning the real and fundamental alteration and removing of this present
distress, misery and great calamity, for his seeds sake; and moreover that
they for to maintain the Idolatry and Sorcery of their false worship and
religion, wherein is neither faithfulness nor love, neither Faith nor
Righteousness, like the Jews in former times, especially about the end of the
old Testament, have begun and still do begin one murdering, robbing, and
bloodsheding course and enterprise, after and above another, not forbearing
thus to bring many thousands of souls to the slaughter, it shall and must so be
paid home to these heathens possessed of the Devil, who never would obey nor
hearken, but with all their strength still do endeavor to annihilate and
frustrate the counsel of the Lord; even so I say, as they have deserved it
both of God himself, and also of those poor people, who thereby are ruined,
made desolate and destroyed, Psalm. 2. and 12.

Thus the Heathen, viz. the people of the second and new Testament, who, by
breaking the bond of the love of God, are divided asunder, and in Christ the
light of Faith, blinded, are from the face and presence of Jesus Christ in
these their dark and obscure hearts called upon by Michael the Prince of
wars, by whom the Lord God, for to maintain the honor of his word and holy
name, and for the fundamental deliverance of poor Mankind shall arise, and
make himself manifest and known.
