Die Veneris, 28. Maii, 1647.
Instructions agreed upon by the Lords and Commons in Parliament assembled, to
be observed in taking, examining, and determining the Accounts of all Officers
and Soldiers, who have actually and faithfully served under their command in
the Kingdom of England and Dominion of Wales from or since the beginning of
these Wars.
I THat all Officers of Horse, Foot, and Dragoones, who have served under the
Command and Pay of the Committee of any Association, County, or Garrison, shall
have all the Accounts for their pay certified according to Muster, by every
such Committee, or any three of them, under their hands respectively, (viz.)
How long every such Officer has actual served with a Regiment, Troop, or
Company, under his Command; And what number, to his knowledge, that Regiment,
Troop, or Company, did consist of, during that time, by what Commission, under
whose Command, in what quality, and what Money, to their knowledge, every
Officer has received for or toward his Pay; and what he has received in
Horse, Arms, or other goods, for which he may be charged by and accomptable to
the State. And in case the Committee for any Association, County, or Garrison,
shall give notice to the Committee, or Sub-Committee, appointed for this
service, that they are unable to certify on the behalf of such an Officer, or
that such an Officer, has not served under their Command, Then the Commander
in chief of every such Garrison, Regiment, or Regiments under whom such an
Officer has served, and the next in chief under him, that shall then survive
respectively, with the Captain, if then living, who shall be concerned in any
such Certificate, to be given on the behalf of his Officers, shall certify
the same according to Musters as aforesaid, under their own Hands and Seals;
which they are to do with such care, as they and every of them may deliver the
same upon their Oaths, if required, before the Committee for this Service, or
their Sub-Committees; which Accounts so certified by the Committees or
Officers, as aforesaid, shall be returned to the Sub-Committee appointed by the
Committee for the Accounts of the Kingdom, for taking the Accounts of that
County where such Officer has served, and from them to be transmitted to the
Committee appointed for this service, to receive such further charge as they
shall be able to give, and afterward to be by them determined according to
these Instructions, and speedily returned to the said Sub-Committee, who are to
deliver the same to the several Officers, and other persons who are concerned
therein.

II. That all Officers whatsoever, who do or have served in the Grand Armies
of the Kingdom, and have not had relation at the same time to particular
Counties or Garrisons, shall according to Muster have such and the like
Certificates from the two Superior Officers (which shall be surviving) of the
Regiment wherein they have actually served; And in case the Certificate
concern any Officer under the degree of a Captain, then that Captain, if
living who is concerned in that Certificate, on the behalf of his Officer,
shall join in certifying the same accordingly; and from them transmitted to
the Committee for this Service.

III. That no Certificate shall be taken, where the parties that give it have
not made it first to appear to the Committee appointed for this Service, or
their Sub-Committee, that they have not been cashiered from their command for
any misdemeanour: And shall likewise have given in to the aforesaid Commmittee,
or Sub-Committees, their Hands, Seals, and Qualities, with which addition they
shall afterward certify and no other ways.

IIII. That in case any Committee of both Houses of Parliament, or any
General, have heretofore granted any Warrants by Authority from the Parliament
for payment of any Arrears due to any Officer for his Service; And that the
same, or any part thereof, does still remain unpaid, Then in every such case
the Committee appointed for this purpose, shall make deduction upon evety
Warrant, according to the directions herein expressed; and the remainder
appearing due thereupon shall be accounted to every such Officer a just debt
from the State.

V. That all Officers and Soldiers who have already received any sum of
Money in full satisfaction from the respective Counties where they served,
though it was not agreeable hereunto, shall not by virtue of this Ordinance
(any Clause herein contained) claim any such pretended Arrears.

VI. That all Governors of Cities, Castles, Towns, or Forts, unto whom any
allowance is due, either as Governor, or for Pay, Spies, Intelligence
Fortifications, or Moneys necessarily laid out for Horses Arms, Ammunition, or
otherwise for the service of the State and has not received the same shall
have the Accounts of such Pay and Charges examined, allowed, and determined, by
the Committee appointed for this purpose, as an Arreare to them due.

Provided always, that the Governor aforesaid shall take his Corporal Oath
that neither in Money, Horse Arms, or other Goods appertaining, or belonging to
the State, he has received any part of the Money which he accounts as due unto
himself; And shall upon the same Oath deliver in an Account of what ever
remains in his hands belonging to the State.

VII That no Officer of what quality soever (who has received any Money or
Goods from the State, or other ways for which he is to be accomptable) shall
have his Accounts determined by the Committee appointed for the same, before he
has delivered in an Account thereof to the Committee for the Accounts of the
whole Kingdom or their Sub-Committees respectively. And in case it shall
appear at any time within two years after determination of any such Account,
that any such Officer is further chargeable, he shall for default herein
forfeit to the State double the sum which shall appear he has not formerly
acknowledged upon his Account.

VIII That no Officer of Horse, or Dragoones in Commission shall receive Pay
for any Horses in order to their respective qualities, other then he shall make
to appear by the Musters, he kept for the service of the Parliament, and for
such time only, as it shall so appear he kept them.

IX And forasmuch as the greatness of the debt due to the whole Soldiery, who
have served faithfully in this War, has occasioned heretofore part of the
Pay to them so due to be respited on the Publique-Faith for a present ease; Yet
considering the same debt will at length become payable from the Commonwealth,
of whom the Souldery of this Kingdom have been necessitated to take
Free Quarter when Moneys could not be provided for them; And when they have
received Moneys for their Pay, they have many times left their Quarters
undischarged, so that the Public will be in danger to suffer in both; It is
therefore ordered that no sum of Money due to any Officer, or Soldier, shall
be so respited, But the Committee appointed for this service shall have power,
and are hereby authorized and required to deduct respectively out of the whole
sum demanded for pay by any Officer, or Soldier for their service in this
Kingdom of England, and Dominion of Wales, the several and respective
proportions of Moneys hereafter expressed, for their Quarters due to the
Commonwealth,

X From all Foot Soldiers, and Officers of Foot, whose pay is seven shillings
a week, or under, three shillings a week for their Quarters.

Quarters.

Provided that this extend not to such Officers in Commission that have served

have discharged their Quarters, during the time for which they crave allowance.

XVI That all private Soldiers, as well of Horse as Foot disbanded, or to be
disbanded, who have not received satisfaction for their service in the Armies,
or Counties where they have served, shall receive the same from the Committees
of the several Armies or Counties, where they have done, or now do the
service; For the evidencing whereof, every such Soldier shall bring to the
respective Committees a Note under the hands and seals of his Officer that he
is so many weeks in Arreare, who are to deduct out of such Arreares for his
Quarters, according to the rate hereby Ordered both for Horse and Foot.
Provided, that this extend not to any private Soldier, whether of Horse or
Foot, who has left the service of that Army, Garrison, or County, without

with which he has served, or a Certificate under the hand of his superior
Officer, that such Horse and Arms with which he has served did not appertain
to the State, or was lost in actual service, whose accounts cast up as is

Counties aforesaid, of such a debt due to the private Soldier of that Army or
County, they shall forthwith be enabled to discharge the same,

except such who have received the sums of money so certified, or some part
thereof in full of their whole demand.

Company, and with the same has not been for the time he craveth allowance in
actual service, neither shall any Certificate be made for longer time then any
such Officer has had such a Regiment, Troop, or Company, actually under his
command, upon penality of the loss of their whole Arreares, who shall certify
the same, Provided that this exception shall not any way debar from payment,
that Regiment of Reformadoes under the command of Colonel Saunderson, but they
and every of them abating for their Quarters, one third part of their
respective pays, shall have their Accounts made up according to the agreement
