just and Fundamental Rights and Liberties of themselves and the Kingdom.

Soldiers of his Army.

LONDON, Printed for George Whittington at the Blew Anchor in Corn hill, near
the Exchange. 1647.

A Declaration, or Representation from his Excellency, Sir Tho. Fairfax, and of
the Army under his Command, Humbly tendered to the PARLIAMENT.
THAT we may no longer be the dis-satisfaction of our friends, the subject of
our enemies malice (to work jealousies and misrepresentations upon) and the
suspicion (if not astonishment) of many in the Kingdom, in our late or present
transactions and conduct of business; we shall in all faithfulness and
clearness profess, and declare unto you, those things which have of late
protracted and hindered our disbanding, the present grievances which possess
our Army, and are yet unremedied, with our desires, as to the complete
settlement of the liberties, and peace of the kingdom; which is that blessing
of God, then which (of all worldly things) nothing is more dear unto us, or
more precious in our thoughts, we having hitherto thought all our present
enjoyments (whether of life or livelihood, or nearest relations) a price but
sufficient to the purchase of so rich a blessing; that we, and all the
freeborn people of this Nation, may sit down in quiet under our Vines, under
the glorious administration of Justice, and righteousness, and in the full
possession of those Fundamental Rights and Liberties, without which we can
have little hopes (as to humane considerations) to enjoy either any comforts of
life, or so much as life it self, but at the pleasures of some men, ruling
merely according to will and power.

It cannot be unknown what has passed betwixt the Parliament and the Army, as
to the service of Ireland. By all which, together with the late proceedings
against the Army, in relation to their petition and grievances; all men may
judge what has hindered the Army from a ready engagement in that service; and
(without further account or Apology, as to that particular, then what passages
and proceedings themselves (already made public,) do afford; we do appeal
to your selves, whether those courses, to which the Parliament has (by the
designs and practices of some) been drawn, have rationally tended to induce a
cheerful and unanimous undertaking of the Army to that service, or rather to
break and pull the Army in pieces with discontent and dishonor, and to put
such disobligations and provocations upon it, as might drive it into distemper,
and indeed discourage both this Army and other Soldiers from any further
engagement in the Parliaments service. And we wish all men would (with us) upon
the whole carriage, seriously consider, whether (in the intentions of those who
have by false informations, and misrepresentations put the Parliament upon such
ways) the timely and effectual relief of Ireland, seem really to have been
intended, or rather (with the breaking, or disbanding of this Army) to draw
together, or raise such other forces, and of such a temper as might serve to
some desperate and distructive designs in England. For which, (besides the
probable suspicions from their carriage of the business) we have beforehand,
in the transaction thereof, had more then hints of such a design, by clear
expressions to that purpose, from many of the Officers of the Army, that have
been persuaded, and appeared most forward, to engage as for Ireland, on the
terms proposed. And, that such a design has all along been driven, seems
now too evident, by the present disposing of those Forces that have been
engaged for Ireland by the endeavors of some, to gain a power from the
Parliament of ordering those Forces for some service in England; and by the
private listings of men for service there, without any public authority of
Parliament. And (all this) by the same persons, who have all along, appeared
most active, and violent in the late proceedings against the Army.

As to the full discontents and dis-satisfactions of the Army, in relation to
their grievances, and their noncompliance to the late orders for sudden
disbanding by peece-meale (before more full and equal satisfaction were given
to the whole) we desire you to look back to the Papers already published, of
the grievances themselves, the Narrative of the Officers, and the late Papers
from the general Council of War at Bury, and late general Randezvouz near
Newmarket: and (we think) your late resuming the consideration of their things
(as to a further satisfaction) does much justify the desires and proceedings
of the Army, in the past particulars, hitherto.

And though (had we (upon our first addresses) for our undoubted Rights and
Dues) bound or free, and candid reception, with a just consideration, and a
reasonable satisfaction, or at least a free answer therein, we should have been
easily persuaded to have abated or forborne much of our Dues, and not to have
enquired into, or considered (so far as we have) either the possibilities
there are for more present satisfaction of Arreares, or the credit of future
securities proposed; yet since upon these former addresses, we have found such
hard dealing, as in the said Papers is set forth, and those additionall (though
hitherto but partial) satisfactions, coming so hardly as they have, we find
no obliging reasons in the least, to decline or recede from what is our due;
but rather still to adhere unto our desires of full and equal satisfaction, in
all the things mentioned in the aforesaid Papers, not only in behalf of our
selves, and the Army, but also the whole Soldiery throughout the whole
Kingdom, who have concurred, or shall concur with us in the same desires.

And to all our former desires, as Soldiers, we cannot but add this (wherein
we find our selves so nearly concerned in point of Justice and Reputation) that
more care, and a stricter course may be taken for making good all Articles
granted upon Surrenders, according to the true intent and meaning of them. As
also for Remedy and Reparation in case of any breach; (and this) without those
delays which diverse have found, as prejudicial to them or more, then if they
had been totally denied the performance of them.

Nor will it now (we hope) seem strange or unseasonable to rational and
honest men, who consider the consequence of our present case, to their own, and
the Kingdoms, (as well as our) future concernments in point of right, freedom,
peace, and safety, if (from a deep sense of the high consequence of our
present case, both to our selves (in future) and all other people) we shall,
before disbanding, proceed, in our own and the Kingdoms behalf, to propound,
and plead, for some provision, for our, and the Kingdoms satisfaction, and
future security in relation to those things, especially considering, that we
were not a mere mercinary Army, hired to serve any Arbitrary power of a State;
but called forth and conjured, by the several Declarations of Parliament, to
the defense of our own and the peoples just rights, and liberties; And so we
took up Arms, in judgment and conscience to those ends, and have so
continued them, and are resolved according to your first just desires in your
Declarations, and such principles as we have received from your frequent
informations, and our own common sense concerning those our fundamental Rights
and Liberties, to assert and vindicate, the just power, and Rights of this
Kingdom in Parliament for those common ends premised, against all arbitrary
power, violence and oppression, and against all particular parties, or
interests whatsoever. The said Declarations still directing us to the epuitable
sense of all Laws and constitutions as dispencing with the very Letter of the
same, and being supreme to it, when the safety and preservation of all is
concerned, and assuring us, that all authority is fundamentally seated, in the
office, and but ministerially in the persons, neither do or will these our
proceedings (as we are fully and in conscience persuaded) amount to any thing,
not warrantable before God and men, being thus far, much short of the common
proceedings in other Nations, to things of an higher nature then we have yet
appeared to. And we cannot but be sencible of the great complaints, that have
been made generally to us of the Kingdom, from the people where we march, of
arbitrarinesse and injustice, to their great and insupportable oppressions.

And truly such Kingdoms, as have according both to the law of Nature and
Nations, appears to the vindication and defense, of their just rights and and
liberties, have proceeded much higher; As our brethren of Scotland: who in the
first beginning of these late differences, associated in Covenant, from the
very same grounds and principles (having no vissible form, either of Parliament
or King to countenance them) and as they were therein justified, and protected
by their own, and this Kingdom also, so we justly shall expect to be.

We need not mention the States of the Netherlands, the Portugals, and others,
all proceeding upon the same Principles of right and freedom; And accordingly
the Parliament has declared it no resistance of Magistracy, to side with the
just Principles, and law of Nature and Nations, being that Law upon which we
have assisted you. And that the Soldiery may lawfully hold the hands of that
General, who will turn his Cannon against his Army on purpose to destroy
them; the Seamen the hands of that Pylot, who wilfully runs the Ship upon a
Rock, (as our brethren of Scotland argued.) And such were the proceedings of
our Ancestors of famous memory, to the purchasing of such Rights and Liberties
as they have enjoyed through the price of their blood; and we (both by that and
the later blood of our dear friends and Fellow Soldiers, with the hazard of
our own) do now lay claim unto.

Nor is that supreme end, (the glory of God) wanting in these cases, to set a
price upon all such proceedings of Righteousness and Justice, it being one
witness of God in the World to carry on a Testimony against the Injustice and
unrighteousness of men, and against the miscarriages of Govermnents, when
corrupted or declining from their primitive or original glory.

These things we mention, but to compare proceeding, and to show that we are so
much the more justifiable, and warranted in what we do, by how much we come
short of that height and measure of proceedings, which the people in free
Kingdoms and Nations have formrly practiced.

Now having thus far cleared our way in this business, we shall proceed to
propound such things as we do humbly desire for the settling and securing of our
own and the Kingdoms common right, freedom, peace, and safety, as follows.

1. That the Houses may be speedily purged of such members, as for their
Delinquency, or for Corruptions, or abuse to the State, or undue Elections,
ought not to sit there: whereof the late elections in Cornwall, Wales and other
parts of the Kingdom afford so many examples, to the great prejudice of the
peoples freedom in the said elections.

2. That those persons, who have, in the unjust and high proceedings against
the Army, appeared to have the will, the confidence, credit, and power, to
abuse the Parliament, and the Army, and endanger the Kingdom in carrying on
such things against us (while an Army) may be some way speedily disabled from
doing the like or worse to us (when disbanded, and dispersed, and in the
condition of private men) or to other the freeborn people of England in the
same condition with us, and that for that purpose, the same persons may not
continue in the same power (especially as our and the Kingdoms Judges in the
highest trust) but may be made incapable thereof for future,

And if it be questioned who these are, we thought not fit particularly to name
them in this our representation unto you, but shall very speedily give in heir
names; and before long shall offer what we have to say against them, to your
Commissioners, wherein we hope so to carry our selves, as that the world shall
see we aim at nothing of private revenge, as animossities, but that justice
may have a free course and the Kingdom: be eased, and secucured by disinabling
such men (at least) from places of Judicature who desiring to advantage, and
set up themselves, and their party in a general confusion have endeavored to
put the Kingdom into a new flame of war, then which nothing is more abhorrent
to us.

But because neither the granting of this alone, would be sufficient to secure
our own, and the Kingdoms rights, liberties, and safety either for the present
age or posterity, nor would our proposing of this singly be free from the
scandal, and appearance of faction or design only to weaken one party, under
the notion of unjust or oppressive) that we may advance another (which may be
imagined more our own) we therefore declare.

That indeed we cannot but wish, that such men, and such only, might be
preferred to the great power and trust of the Commonwealth, as are approved,
at least, for moral righteousness; And of such we cannot but in our wishes
prefer those, that appear acted thereunto by a principle of Conscience and
Religion in them. And accordingly we do and ever shall bless God for those
many such Worthies, who, through his providence, have been chosen into this
Parliament; And, to such men's endeavors (under God) we cannot but attribute
that Vindication, (in part) of the peoples Rights and Liberties, and those
beginnings of a just Reformation, which the first proceedings of this
Parliament appeared to have driven at, and tended to, though of late
obstructed, or rather diverted to other ends and interest by the prevailing of
other persons of other principles and conditions.

But yet we are so far from designing, or complying to have an absolute or
arbitrary power fixed or settled for continuance, in any persons whatsoever, as
that, (if we might be sure to obtain it) we cannot wish to have it so in the
persons of any, whom we could most confide in, or who should appear most of
our own opinions or principles, or whom we might have most personal assurance
of, or interest in, but we do, and shall much rather wish, that the
Authority of this Kingdom in Parliaments (rightly constituted, that is,
freely, equally and successively chosen, according to its original intention)
may ever stand and have its course. And therefore we shall apply our desires,
chiefly to such things, as (by having Parliaments settled in such a right
Constitution) may give most hopes of Justice and Righteousness, to flow down,
equally to all, in that its ancient Channel, without any Overtures, tending
either to overthrow, that foundation of Order and Government in this Kingdom,
or to ingrosse that power for perpetuity into the hands of any particular
persons, or party whatsoever.

And for that purpose, though (as we have found it doubted by many men,
minding sincerely the public good, but not weighing so fully all consequences
of things) it may and is not unlike to prove, that, upon the ending of this
Parliament, and the Election of New, the Constitution of succeeding
Parliaments, (as to the persons Elected) may prove for the worse many ways;
yet since neither in the present purging of this Parliament, nor in the
Election of New, we cannot promise to our selves, or the Kingdom, an
assurance of Justice, or other positive good from the hands of men, but those
who for present appear most righteous and most for common good (having an
unlimited power fixed in them during life or pleasure) in time, may become
corrupt, or settle into parties, or factions; or, on the other side, in case of
new Elections, those that should so succeed, may prove as bad or worse then the
former. We therefore humbly conceive, that, (of two inconveniences the less
being to be chosen) the maine thing to be intended in this case (and beyond
which humane providence cannot reach, as to any assurance of positive good)
seems to be this, viz. to provide, that however unjust or corrupt the persons
of Parliament Men, in present or future, may prove; or whatever ill they may
do to particular parties (or to the whole, in particular things,) during their
respective terms, or periods, yet they shall not have the temptation or
advantage of an unlimited power fixed in them during their own pleasures,
whereby to perpetuate injustice and oppression upon any, (without end or
remedy,) or to advance and uphold any one particular party, faction, or
interest whatsoever, to the oppression or prejudice of the Community, and the
enslaving of the Kingdom unto all posterity, but that the people may have an
equal hope, or possibility, if they have made an ill choice at one time, to
mend it in another; and the members of the House themselves may be in a
capacity, to taste of subjection as well as rule, and may so be inclined to
consider of other men's cases, as what may come to be their own. This we
speak of, in relation to the House of Commons, as being entrusted, on the
peoples behalf, for their interest in that great and supreme power of the
Commonwealth, ( viz. the Legislative power, with the power of final
judgment,) which being, in its own nature, so arbitrary, and in a manner
unlimited (unless in point of time) is most unfit and dangerous (as to the
peoples interest) to be fixed in the persons of the same men during life, or
their own pleasures. Neither, by the original Constitution of this State, was
it, or ought it to continue so, nor does it (wherever it is, and continues so)
render that State any better then a mere Tyranny) or the people subjected to
it, any better then Vassalls: But in all States, where there is any face of
common freedom, and particularly in this State of England (as is most evident,
both by many positive Laws, and ancient constant custom) the people have a
right to new and successive Elections unto that great and supreme trust, at
certain periods of time, which is so essential and fundamental to their
freedom, as it is, cannot, or ought not, to be denied them, or withheld from
them, and without which the House of Commons is of very little concernment to
the interest of the Commons of England. Yet in this we would not be
mis-understood, in the least, to blame those Worthies of both Houses, whose
zeal to vindicate the Liberties of this Nation, did procure that Act for
continuance of this Parliament; whereby it was secured from being dissolved at
the Kings pleasure, (as former Parliaments had been) or reduced to such a
Certainty, as might enable them the better to assert and vindicate the
Liberties of this Nation, (immediately before so highly invaded, and then also
so much endangered.) And these we take to be the principal ends and grounds,
for which, in that exigency of time and affairs, it was procured, and to which
we acknowledge it has happily been made use of; but we cannot think it was
by those Worthies intended, or ought to be made use of, to the perpetuating of
that supreme trust and power in the persons of any during their own
pleasures, or to the debarring of the people from their right of Elections
(totally new) when those dangers or exigencies were past, and the affairs and
safety of the Commonwealth would admit of such a change.

Having thus cleared our Grounds and Intentions (as we hope) from all scruples
and misunderstandings, in what follows we shall proceed further to propose
what we humbly desire for the settling and securing of our own and the
Kingdoms Rights and Liberties (through the blessing of God) to posterity; and
therefore, upon all the Grounds premised, we further humbly desire as follows;
3. That some determinate period of time may be set, for the continuance of
this and future Parliaments, beyond which none shall continue, and upon which
new Writs may of course issue out, and new Elections successively take place
according to the intent of the Bill for Trienniall Parliaments,

And herein we would not be misunderstood to desire a present or sudden
dissolution of this Parliament, but only (as is expressed before) that some
certain period may be set for the determining of it, so as it may not remain
(as now) continuable for ever, or during the pleasure of the present Members;
And we should desire that the period to be now set for ending this Parliament,
may be such as may give sufficient time for provision of what is wanting and
necessary to be passed in point of just Reformation, and for further securing
the Rights and Liberties, and settling the peace of the Kingdom. In order to
which we further humbly offer.

4. That secure provisions may be made for the continuance of future
Parliaments, so as they may not be adjournable or dissolveable at the Kings
pleasure, or any otherwise then by their own consent during their respective
periods, but at those periods each Parliaments to determine of course as
before. This we desire may be now provided for (if it may be) so as to put it
out of all dispute, for future, though we think of right, it ought not to have
been otherwise before.

And thus a firm foundation being laid in the authority and constitution of
Parliaments for the hopes, at least, of common and equal right and freedom to
our selves and all the freeborn people of this Land; we shall for our parts
freely and cheerfully commit our stock or share of interest in this Kingdom,
into this common bottom of Parliaments, and though it may (for our
particulars) go ill with us in one Voyage, yet we shall thus hope (if right be
with us) to fare better in another.

These things we desire may be provided for by Bill or Ordinance of Parliament
to which the Royal Assent may be desired: when his Majesty in these things,
and what else shall be proposed by the Parliament, necessary for securing the
Rights and Liberties of the people, and for settling the Militia and Peace of
the Kingdom, shall have given his concurrence to put them past dispute, We
shall then desire that the Rights of his Majesty and his posterity may be
considered of, and settled in all things, so far as may consist with the Right
and Freedom of the Subject, and with the security of the same for future.

5 We desire, that the right and fredome of the people, to represent to the
Parliament by way of humble Petition, their grievances (in such things as
cannot otherwise be remedied then by Parliament) may be cleared and vindicated,
That all such grievances of the people may be freely received and admitted in
to consideration, and put into an equitable and speedy way, to be heard,
examined, and redressed (if they appear real) and that in such things for
which men have remedy by law, they may be freely left to the benefit of law,
and the regulated course of Justice, without interruption or check from the
Parliament, except in case of things done upon the exigency of War, or for
the service and benefit of the Parliament and Kingdom in relation to the
War, or otherwise, in due pursuance and execution of Ordinances or Orders of
Parliament.

More particularly (under this head) we cannot but desire, that all such as are
imprisoned, for any pretended misdemeanor, may be put into a speedy way for a
just hearing and trial, and such as shall appear to have been uniustly and
unduly imprisoned, may (with their liberty) have some reasonable reparation
according to their sufferings and the demerit of their oppressors.

6 That the large powers, given to the Committees or Deputy Lieutenants during
the late times of War and destraction, may be speedily taken into
consideration, That such of these powers as appear not necessary to be
continued, may be taken away, and such of them as are necessary may be put into
a regulated way, and left to as little Arbitrarinesse, as the nature and
necessity of the things wherein they are conversant will bear.

7 We could wish that the Kingdom might both be righted and publicly
satisfied in point of Accounts, for the vast sums that have been levied and
paid, as also in diverse other things wherein the Common wealth may be conceived
to have been wronged or abused; But we are loath to press any thing, that may
tend to lengthen out further disputes or contestations, but rather such as may
tend to a speedy and general composure, and quieting of men's minds, in order
to Peace, for which purpose we further propose.

8. That (public Justice being first satisfied by some few examples to
posterity out of the worst of excepted persons, and other Delinquents, having
past their Compositions) some course may be taken (by a general Act of
oblivion or otherwise) whereby the seeds of future War, or fewds, either to
the present age, or posterity, may the better be taken away, by easing that
sense of present, and satisfying those fears, of future Ruin or Undoing, to
persons or families, which may drive men into any desperate ways for self
preservation or remedy, and by taking away the private remembrances and
distinction of parties, as far as may stand with safety to the rights and
Liberties we have hitherto fought for.

There are (besides these) many particular things which we could wish to be
done, and some to be undone, all, in order still to the same ends, of common
right, freedom, peace, and safety. But these proposalls aforegoing, being the
principal things we bottom and insist upon, we shall (as we have said
before) for our parts acquiesce; for other particulars in the Wisdom and
Justice of Parliaments. And whereas it has been suggested or suspected, that
in our late, or present proceedings, our design is to overthrow Presbytery, or
hinder the settlement thereof, and to have the Independent government set up,
we do clearly disclaim, and disavow any such design; We only desire that
according to the Declarations (promising a provision for tender consciences)
there may some effectual course be taken according to the intent thereof, And
that such, who, upon conscientious grounds may differ from the established
forms, may not (for that) be debarred from the common Rights, Liberties, or
Benefits belonging equally to all, as men and Members of the Common wealth,
while they live soberly, honestly, and inoffensively toward others, and
peacefully and faithfully toward the State.

We have thus freely and clearly declared the depth and bottom of our hearts
and desires in order to the Rights, Liberties and Peace of the Kingdom,
wherein we appeal to all men, whether we seek any thing of advantage to our
selves, or any particular party whatever, to the prejudice of the whole, and
whether the things we wish and seek, do not equally concern and conduce to the
good of others in common with our selves, according to the sincerity of our
desires and intentions wherein, ((...) we have already found the concurrent
sense of the people in diverse Counties by their Petitions to the General,
expressing their deep representment of these things, and pressing us to stand
for the Interest of the Kingdom therein, so, we shall wish and expect to find
the unanimous concurrence of all others, who are equally concerned with us in
these things, and wish well to the Public. And so trusting in the mercy and
goodness of God to pass by and help any failings or infirmities of ours, in
the carriage or proceedings hereupon,) we shall humbly cast our selves and the
business upon his good pleasure, depending only on his presence and blessing
for an happy issue to the peace and good of this poor Kingdom, in the
accomplishment whereof, we desire and hope, that God will make you blessed
Instruments.
