A Copy of a Letter from a principal person in Paris, in answer to one
received from his friend in England, touching the estate of the present
affairs, and his opinion.
July1. 1647. SIR,
I Thank you for your advertisements of the Affairs of England by the last
Post, and whereas you desire my Opinion of them, and what I conceive may be the
issue; It is yet very early days to make my judgment of the success, which
is like to depend upon the future management and pursuit of them; for
certainly this great turn by the Army may produce great good and happiness
to the Kingdom, by settling a firm and well conditioned Peace, if it be really
and cordially their intentions as they profess, and I am apt to believe it is;
for as they seem to be men led much by their Conscience, so there must be this
right done unto them, that they have been very exact in point of their
reputation, to have the Articles and Capitulations of their Treaties upon the
rendering of places to be punctually performed; and have heretofore shown a
great sense and dislike at the Houses violation of them, and do now insist to
have them justly performed, and the former breaches of them to be repaired,
which shows them to be people of truth, and of just dealing; and likewise to
have honor in recommendation: if, I say, their intentions be the same which
they yet pretend, which is a settlement of the peace of the Kingdom, (which
uses not to be of the Soldiers Trade) God may make them the instruments of
great blessings unto their Country, even to be Deliverers of it, not only from
the Sword, and War, but from the merciless Government of those, who under
the shelter of their Power and Conquest, had usurped over them and the whole
Kingdom an absolute Arbytrary Dominion, limited by no Laws nor bounds, but by
their own wills, and at such a time when no humane prudence could tell from
whence to look for deliverance, which God has now raised up and begun by
them, and probably may be effected by them, if they hold themselves to their
professed integrity, set private interests in the last place, and pursue these
their beginnings with that wisdom and expedition which truly by their former
Actions may well be expected from them in this: But if they shall pretend one
thing, and intend another, and make the usual specious shows of Liberty and
Reformation, only as the approaches to their Interests, Ambition, or Faction;
my fears are that they will prove a Torrent quickly dried up, and will involve
this Kingdom again in many great miseries, and a new effusion of Blood, and
themselves in few months be reduced to a very sad condition; whereas (if such
be Gods Will) they may probably be the Instruments of settling our happiness in
very few days, and without the spilling of one drop of blood; the way whereof
which occurreth unto me is briefly this; That they send presently unto his
Majesty honest and equitable Conditions, but such as may give unto the Kingdom
good satisfaction, both in point of their ancient Liberties and Privileges,
and his Majesty's new Concessions, with such inlargements as shall be thought
fit; that not only an Act of Oblivion and general Pardon be agreed on, but
such further security as after so great provocations understanding people will
expect, by the way of the se^ling the Militia for some time, and some other
necessary provisions. That the King declaring his willingness to condescend to
what is propounded unto him, and giving his Royal Word for the performance
thereof, they immediately carry the King to London, that he may be in the
condition of a Free man, for that all that he does under actual restraint will
be of no validity. There let all particulars be debated and settled, and then
let the Accusation of the Army be agitated, as likewise all other things that
will require time for the debate and se ling of them; As for the Laws of the
Land, the Kings Revenue, and the right of the Crown, all such as he does not
limit or pass away, will of course return into their wonted Channel.

The King will be (there, as well as at Newmarket) under their protection; But
by this means the Kings power, that of the Houses of Parliament, and City of
London, being all united, will presently recover a general reverence and
obedience; Whereas on the other side, if there shall be any delay made in this
settlement and conjunction of Powers, and time shall be spent in particular
debates, betwixt the Army and the King, or the Army and the Houses, and things
remain in suspense; The Houses, which the Army must now judge their Enemies,
and all that they do for their present satisfaction, is but in compliance with
them, and by constraint, in regard of their present danger, and otherwise not
reconcilable, having declared their Government Tyrannical; and demanded that
many of their leading Members shall be called into judgment, and be sequestered
(so high at breach of Privilege, that when the King only desired that some of
them might be legally proceeded against by the course of Justice, they
withstood it, and voted it the highest breach of Privilege that had been
offered to Parliaments.) If these distractions shall hinder their conjunction,
the Army will daily sink in reputation, the Presbyterian Party will have time
to gather courage, and to fit those places of strength, and the Navy which hold
for them, and the King and his Party perhaps confiding in neither, will
susspend their choice; unto which Party it will be fit, in wisdom to adhere.

In the mean time the Kingdom of Scotland, with those specious Arguments
which they will have of upholding their Covenant which both ^ingdomes are
sworn unto, and the freeing of the person of their Native King, surprised by a
mutinous Army, and held prisoner by them, as is publicly declared, without his
former consent, or present approbation, will arm to a man, to return into
England, where they have been so well paid for their coming in, and their
return bought at so high a price. And to this purpose (if we be not here
misinformed in Paris) they have already voted the whole strength of their
Kingdom to be put presently in a readiness, which they here affirm shall be
of twenty thousand Foot, and six thousand Horse, within a short time to be
ready to march. And in this quarrel they are there very confident, that my
Lord of Mentrosse, and all the Kings Party in Scotland, will most readily join
with them; insomuch that it is in debate, if it be not further proceeded in,
That the Prince be invited to come into Scotland, and to be General of their
Army, to rescue his father out of the hands of the Army that have surprised
him, and holds him under restraint, and have forced the Parliament. And if
you will have my opinion, it is, That if the Army proceed not speedily to unite
the King and the City, and the Parliament (being purged or renewed in such sort
as the Scots may not be invited in, and then the Counties may unitedly join
against the Scots, if they shall invade this Kingdom, the Scots will prevail,
or at least a more bloody War will be revived, then that which we hoped had
been ended. So that laying aside whatsoever may be said against the Army, for
the seizing of the Kings Person, and declaring against the House, or against
the Houses, for their assuming of absolute power, and using of it arbitrarily
against all Law, without any Limits but their own will; or against the Kings
stiffnesse, in not yielding to those things which he judges against his Honor
and Conscience. If the Army (in whom the means is only now to do it,) shall
not presently establish the King, moderate the Houses, cause the City entirely
to join; The united power of the Kingdom of Scotland, with the adherent party
of their Covenanters, will bring in speedily more miseries upon the Kingdom of
England, then what it has hithero suffered. As for the Shieres and Provinces
of England, if the abovesaid union be once settled, there shall not need any
great industry to unite them against the coming in of the Scots.

Thus (to satisfy your request) I have (in more haste then such a business
requires) set down my opinion, or rather conjecture, of the estate of the
present affairs, which is, That if the Army proceed prudently, moderately, and
speedily, in the settlement of them, they will procure a great deliverance to
their Country; But if they go staggeringly to work, and spend the time in
particular debates, or matters of interest, before they have settled the
general, they will be but additions to our former miseries, and the causers of
their own ruin in the end, specially if this present Parliament remain in
being. For if it recover Power and Authority, the Army can never be secured;
for whatsoever the Houses shall do by Ordinances for their indemnity, which
is the highest security they can give, will by them be revocable every
morning, and they will judge all promises or policies that have been used for
the dispersing of a mutinous Army very justifiable for them to do, and punish
afterward. So that the safety of the Army can consist in nothing but in the
dissolving of the Parliament. Besides for the firm settling of all things that
shall be agreed with the King, there will be a necessity of having a new and
unquestionable Parliament: For certainly the wisdom of a State, for the
confirmation of so great advantages and immunities as they hope to obtain from
the King, will not rely upon the security of a Parliament, against which so
much has been objected, as that the King and Peers have been driven away by
force and Tumults, and the Tumults and other proceedings have caused the
freedom of it to be often questioned, which is the very essence and being of
Parliaments. That the Members of the lower House do fit by two several sorts
of Writs inconsistent together, some by the Kings Great Seal which is Voted
down, the other by their new Great Seal, which some of the former Judges and
great Lawyers have heretofore, affirmed to be Treason to make, by the Statute
of the 25. of Edw. 3. And now the Army having so declared against them for
breach of Trust, and usurping an Arbitrary and Tyrannical power; All which
suggestions, although they should not amount to the making of an invalidity in
their proceeding; yet certainly that which does so highly concern the
Kingdom in point of Peace, and the firm settlement for all future times of so
many important things betwixt the King and Subject, as Pardon and Indemnity,
and many other immunities ought to be by so clear, and so unquestionable
security, that neither for the present, nor in future times any scruple or
doubt could be raised concerning it, which made our wise Brethren the Scots not
admit that the great advantages and liberties which they obtained of the King
should be settled in that Parliament, when the King first agreed unto them,
because they conceived in regard of the Army, and some other distractions, that
Parliament might in future times be held dubious and questionable; and
therefore having agreed the Articles, and gotten them signed by the King, they
dissolved that questionable Parliament, and obtained of the King that a new
Parliament (against whose validity no doubt or scruple could be raised) should
(within few days after the dissolution of the former) be assembled, as it was;
and all their Privileges, and the Acts which they desired, were passed in that
new Parliament. And it is to be conceived, that it will be likewise held
necessary for England in this occasion to follow their example. And so, etc.

Paris, July 1. 11. 1647.
