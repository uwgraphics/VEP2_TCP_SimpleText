oweing upon the public faith as aforesaid, and it is ordained that the Lord
General be desired, and the said Commissioners are hereby required and
enjoined, to see the Articles touching the mustering and payment of the Army,
and concerning horse, Arms, and ammunition, and all such further directions as
from time to time concerning the Army, and the affairesthereof, shall be
recommended to their care by one or either House of Parliament, be duly
observed, and to take care that the Country be not charged with free quarter,
and whereas the army now under the imediate command of the Lord General does
consist of many more Regiments both of horse and foot, and consequently of
more Officers then can have employment as the Army is to be reduced by this
Ordinance; By means whereof diverse Commanders and Officers, who are very worthy
and desirous of the service, cannot at present have employment according to
their qualities, for whose support and maintenance some competent provision is
to be made until there shall be places and employments for them. It is therefore
ordained and declared by the Lords and Commons in Parliament, and the Lord
General is hereby authorized to entertain such and so many of the said
Officers as by the Lord General shall be thought fit, and shall be by this
occasion out of employment, into the condition of reformadoe Officers, and

Regiment; which Officers so formed, and attending the service, shall have such
entertainements, and in such manner as is hereafter expressed, that is to say,
the said Officers respectively according to the quality of their late
employment, shall each of them respectively be paid, from time to time as the
rest of the Army is paid one fourth part of his personal entertainment,
according to the list or establishment of the Army, over and besides the
ordinary pay of troopers, Harquebusheers, and one other fourth part of his
personal entertainment according to the said list and establishment of the
Army, shall be respited upon the public faith, until these unnatural wars be
ended.

Lastly be it ordained and declared by the authority aforesaid, that this Army
under the immediate Command of the Lord General the Earl of Essex, shall be
subject to the Orders and directions of both Houses of Parliament, or the
Committee of both Kingdoms, according to the Ordinance that does establish
that Committee. Provided always that such rates and assessements, as shall be
made by virtue of this Ordinance upon any members, Assistants or Attendants
upon either of the Houses of Parliament, shall before the same be leavied, be
presented to the respective Houses, whose members, Assistants, or Attendants,
shall be concerned therein respectively, and by such respective House allowed
and approved of, any thing in this Ordinance to the contrary notwithstanding.
