The Impeached and Imprisoned Citizens, Aldermen, and Members, Absolution from
Guilt or Treason, by an Ancient Vote of the Commons House, when full, free,
dis-ingaged, and out of Wardship to the Army.
Die Lunae 2 Martij. 1645.
Resolved etc. by the House of Commons, the Actions of the City of London, or
of any other person whatsoever, for the defense of the Parliament, or the
Privilege thereof, or the preservation of the Members thereof, are according to
their duty and to their late Protestation, and the Laws of the Kingdom; And if
any person shall arrest or trouble any of them for so doing, he is declared to
be a public enemy of the Commonwealth.

Resolved etc. That this Vote shall be made known to the Common Counsel of the
City of London.

But the Actions of the now Impeached and Imprisoned Citizens, Aldermen and
Members, for which they stand Accused and Committed are such; Yea, warranted by
Ordinances, Votes, and Orders of both Houses then sitting,

Ergo; Those Fugitives and Preingaged Members, and other persons who have
accused, impeached, arrested and troubled them for so doing, are by this Vote,
declared to be public enemies to the State, and the greater Traitors of the
two, as most honest dis-interessed men repute them.
