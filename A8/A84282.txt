Hero. HOw fares
My dear Leander? O vouchsafe to speak,
least my heart break:
I banished am from thy sweet company;
It Is not
Thy Father's Anger can ab^se my Love,
I still will prove
Thy faithful Friend until such time I dye:
Though Fate
And Fortune do conspire, --
to interrupt our Love,
In spite of Fate and Fortune's Hate,
I still will constant prove:
And though
Our angry Friends, in malice,
now our Bodies part,
Nor Friends nor Foes, nor Scars nor Blows,
shall separate our Hearts.

Leander. What Voice
Is this, that calls Leander from her Bower,
from yonder Tower?
The Echo of this Voice does sure proceed --

Hero. Leander,
It Is thy Hero ^^in would come to thee,
if it might be;
Thy absence m^^es my t^nder Heart to bleed:
But oh!
This pleasant River Hellifponet,
which is the Peoples Wonder,
Those Waves so high do Injury,
by parting us asunder:
And though
There Is Ferry-men good store,
yet none will stand my Friend,
To waft we over to that fair Shore,
Where all my Grief shall end.

Leander. Hero,
Though I am thy constant Lover still,
and ever will,
My angry Father is thy Enemy;
He still
Does strive to keep's asunder, now and then,
poor Ferry-men,
They dare not waft thee over least they dye:
Nor yet
Dare they convey me
unto my dear Hero: now
My Father's Rage will not assuage,
nor will the same al^ow:
Be patient
Then, dear Hero, now,
as I am ^rue to thee,
Even so I trust thou ^rt as (...),
and faithful unto me.

Hero. Is there
No way to stay an angry Father's Wrath,
whose Fury has
Bereaved his Child of Comfort and Content?

Leander. O no,
Dear Hero! there is no way that I do know,
to ease my Woe;
My Days of Joy and Comfort now are spent,
You may
As well go tame
a Lion in the Wilderness,
As to persuade my Father's Aid,
to help me in Distress:
His Anger
And his River has
kept us asunder long;
He has his Will, his Humor still,
and we have all the Wrong.

Hero. It Is not
Thy Father's Anger, nor his River deep,
the which shall keep
Me from the Imbracements of my dearest Friend,
For through
This silver Stream, my way I mean to take,
even for thy sake,
For thy dear sake, my dearest Life I Will spend:
Though Waves
And Winds should both conspire
mine Enemies to be,
My Love's so strong, I fear no wrong
can happen unto me:
O meet
Me in thy Garden,
where this pleasant River glides,
Lend me thy Hand, draw me to Land,
whatever me betides.
Now must
I make my tender slender Arms my Oars,
help Watery Powers!
Ye little Fishes teach me how to swim;
And ^ll
Ye Sea-nymps guard me unto yonder Banks,
I Will give you Thanks,
Bear up my Body, strengthen every Limb:
I come,
Leander, now prepare
thy lovely Arms for me;
I come, dear Love, assist me Jove,
I may so happy be.
But, oh!
A mighty Tempest rose,
and he was drowned that Tide,
In her fair sight, her Heart's Delight
and so with Grief she died.
But when
Her aged Father these things understands,
he wrings his Hands,
And tears his hoary Hair from of his Head,
Society
He shuns, and does forsake his Meat,
his Grief's so great;
And often does make the lowly ground his Bed;
O! my
Leander, would that I
had died to save thy Life;
Or that I had, when I was sad,
made thee brave Hero's Wife:
It was
My Trespass, and I do
confess I wronged thee,
Posterity shall know thereby
the Fault lay all in me.
But since
The Waves have cast his Body on the Land,
upon the Sand,
His Corpse shall buried be in solemn wise,
One Grave
Shall serve them both, and one most stately Tomb,
she will make him room,
Although her Corpse be breathless where she lies.
Ye Fathers
Have a special Care now,
whatsoever you do,
For those that part true loyal Hearts,
themselves were never true.
Though Fate
And Fortune cross poor Lovers,
sometimes as we do know,
Pray understand, have you no hand
even in their Overthrow.
