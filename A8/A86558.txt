HORACE HIS FIRST BOOK OF SONGS.

Q. HORATII FLACCI LIBER I. CARMINVM:
ODE I.
Alios aliis rebus duci* se Lyricorum versuum studio teneri.

MAECENAS atavis edite Regibus,
O and praesidium, and dulce decus meum;
Sunt quos curriculo pulvere^ Olympicum
Collegisse juvat: metaque fervidis
Evitata rotis, Palmaque nobilis,
Terrarum dominos evehit ad Deos.
Hunc, si mobilium turba Quiritium
Certat tergeminis tollere honoribus:
Illum, si proprio condidit horreo
Quidquid de Libycis verritur areis,
Gaudentem patrios findere sarculo
Agros: Attalicis conditionibus
Nunquam dimoveas, ut trabe Cypria
Myrtoum pavidus nauta secet mare.
Luctantem Icariis fluctibus Africum
Mercator metuens, otium, and oppidi
Laudat rura sui: mox reficit rateis
Quassas, indocilis pauperiem pati.
Est qui nec veteris pocula Massici,
Nec partem solido demere de die
Spernit, nunc viridi membra sub arbuto
Stratus, nunc ad aquae lene caput sacrae.
Multos castra juvant, and lituo tubae
Permistus sonitus, bellaque matribus
Detestata; manet sub Jove frigido
Venator, tenerae conjugis immemor:
Seu visa est catulis cerva fidelibus,
Seu rupit tereteis Marsus aper plagas.
Me Doctarum hederae praemia frontium
Dis miscent superis: me gelidum nemus,
Nympharumque leves cum Satyris ch^ri
Secernunt populo: si neque tibias
Euterpe cohibet, nec Polyhymnia
Lesboum refugit tendere barbiton;
Quod si me Lyricis vatibus inseres,
Sublimi feriam sidera vertice.
ODE II. Ad AUGUSTUM CAESARE^.
Deos omnes iratos esse Romany, ob Caesaris caede^* unam imperii spem in
Augusto constitutam.

I Am satis terris nivis, at que dirae
Grandinis misit pater: and rubente
Dextera sacras jaculatus arceis
Terruit Vrbem.
Terruit genteis, grave ne rediret
Seculum Pyrrhae nova monstra questae,
Omne cum Proteus pecus egit altos
Visere monteis;
P^scium and summa genus haesit ulmo,
Nota quae seeds fuerat columbis,
Et superjecto pavidae natarunt
Aequore damae.
Vidimus flavum Tiberim retortis
Littore Etrusco violenter undis,
Ire dejectum monumenta regis,
Templaque Vestae:
Iliae dum se nimium querenti
Iactat ultorem, vagus and sinistra
Labitur ripa, (Jove non probante,)
Vxorius amnis.
Audiet, civeis acuisse ferrum
Quo graves Persae melius perirent:
Audiet pugnas, vitio parentum
Rara juventus.
Quem vocet divum populus, ruentis
Imperi rebus? prece qua fatigent
Virgins sanctae minus audientem
Carmina Vestam?
Cui dabit parteis scelus expiandi
Jupiter? tandem venias precamur,
Nube candenteis humeros amictus
Augur Apollo:
Sive tu mavis Erycina ridens,
Quam Iocus circumvolat, and Cupido:
Sive neglectum genus, and nepotes
Respicis auctor.
Heu nimis longo satiate ludo:
Quem juvat clamor, galeaeque leves,
Acer and Mauri peditis cruentum
Vultus in hostem.
Sive mutata juvenem figura,
Ales in terris imitaris, almae
Filius Majae, patiens vocari
Caesaris ult^r:
Serus in coelum redeas, diuque
Laetus intersis populo Quirim:
Neve te nostris vitiis iniquum
Ocyor aura
Tollat; hic magnos potius triumphos,
Hic ames dici pater, atque princeps:
Neu sinas Medos equitare inultos
Te duce Caesar.
ODE IV. Ad L. SEXTIUM Consularem.
Adventu veris, and communi moriendi condition proposita hortatur ad
voluptates.

SOlvitur acris hyems grata vice veris, and Favoni:
Trahuntque siccas machinae carinas:
Ac neque jam stabulis gaudet pecus, aut arator igni:
Nec prata canis albicant pruinis.
Iam Cytherea choros ducit Venus, imminente Luna:
Iunctaeque Nymphis Gratiae decentes
Alterno terram quatiunt pede, dum graveis Cyclopum
Vulcanus ardens urit officinas.
Nunc decet aut viridi nitidu^ caput impedire myrto,
Aut flore, terrae quem ferunt solutae.
Nunc and in umbrosis, Fauno decet immolare lucis,
Seu poscat agnam, sive malit haedum.
Pallida mors aequo pulsat pede pauperum tabernas,
Regumque turreis, o beat Sexti.
Vitae summa brevis spem nos vetat inchoare longam;
Iam te premet nox, fabulaeque manes,
Et domus exilis Plutonis; quo simul mearis,
Non regna vini sortiere talis,
Nec tenerum Lycidam mirabere, quo calet juventus
Nunc omnis, and mox virgins tepebunt.
ODE V. Ad PYRRHAM.
Miseros esse qui illius amore teneantur; se ex co, tanquam e naufragio,
enatasse.

QVis multa gracilis te puer in rosa
Perfusus liquidis urget odoribus,
Grato, Pyrrha, sub antro?
Cui flavam religas comam
Simplex munditiis? heu, quoties fidem,
Mutatosque deos flebit, and aspera
Nigris aequora ventis
Emirabitur insolens,
Qui nunc te fruitur credulus aurea:
Qui semper vacuam, semper amabilem
Sperat, nescius aurae
Fallacis! miseri, quibus
Intentata nites. Me tabula sacer
Votiva paries indicat, uvida
Suspendisse potenti
Vestimenta maris deo.
ODE VIII. Ad LYDIAM.
Obseure juvenem quendam, quem Sybarin vocat, ut amore perditum, and
voluptatibus collique factum, notat.

LYDIA dic, per omneis
Te deos oro: Sybarin cur properes amando
Perdere; cur apricum
Oderit campum patiens pulveris, atque solu?
Cur neque militaris
Inter aequaleis equitet; Gallica nec lupatis
Temperet ora fraenis?
Cur timet flavum Tiberim tangere? cur oliva^
Sanguine viperino
Cautius vitat? neque jam livida gestat armis
Brachia, saepe disco,
Saepe trans finem jaculo nobilis expedito?
Quid latet, ut marinae
Filium dicunt Thetidis sub lacrymosa Trojae
Funera, ne virilis
Cultus in caedem and Lycias proriperet catervas?
ODE IX. Ad THALIARCHUM.
Hyeme indulgendum voluptati.

VIdes, ut alta stet nive candidum
Soracte: nec jam sustineant onus
Silvae laborantes: geluque
Flumina constiterint acuto.
Dissolve frigus, ligna super foco
Large reponens: atque benignius
Deprome quadrimum Sabina
O Thaliarche merum diota.
Permit divis coetera: qui simul
Stravere ventos aequore fervido
Depraelianteis, nec cupressi
Nec veteres agitantur orni.
Quid sit futurum cras, fuge quaerere: and
Quem sors dierum cumque dabit, lucro
Appone: nec dulceis amores
Sperne puer, neque tu choreas.
Donec virenti canities abest
Morosa, nunc and campus, and areae
Lenesque sub noctem susurri
Composita repetantur hora:
Nunc and latentis proditor intimo
Gratus puellae risus ab angulo:
Pignusque direptum lacertis,
Aut digito male pertinaci.
ODE XIII. Ad LYDIAM.
Dolet sibr Telephum anteponi.

CVm tu Lydia, Telephi
Cervicem roseam, and cerea Telephi
Laudas brachia; vae meum
Fervens difficili bile tumet jecur*
Tunc nec men's mihi, nec color
Certa sede manent; humor and in genas
Furtim labitur, arguens
Quam lentis penitus macerer ignibus.
Vror, seu tibi candidos
Turparunt humeros immodicae mer^
Rixae: sive puer furens
Impressit memorem dente labris notam.
Non, si me satis audias,
Speres perpetuum, dulcia barbare
Laedentem oscula, quae Venus
Quinta part sui nectaris imbuit.
Felices ter, and amplius,
Quos irrupta tenet copula, nec malis
Divulsus querimonii^
Suprema citius solvet amor die.
ODE III. In VIRGILIUM Athenas proficiscentem.
Secundam ei navigationem precatur: deinde occasionem nactus; hominam audacium
detestatur.

SIc te diva potens Cypri,
Sic fratres Helenae, lucida sidera,
Ventorumque regat pater,
Obstrictis aliis, praeter Iapyga:
Navis, quae tibi creditum
Debes Virgilium, finibus Atticis
Reddas incolumem precor:
Et serves animae dimidium meae.
Illi robur, and aes triplex
Circa pectus erat, qui fragilem truci
Commisit pelago ratem
Primus, nec timuit praecipitem Africum
Decertantem Aquilonibus,
Nec tristeis Hyadas, nec rabiem Noti:
Quo non arbiter Adriae
Major, tollere seu ponere vult freta.
Quem mortis timuit gradum,
Qui siccis oculis monstra natantia,
Qui vidit mare turgidum, and
Infameis scopulos Acroceraunia?
Nequicquam Deus abscidit
Prudens Oceano dissociabili
Terras, si tamen impiae
Non tangenda rates transtliunt vada.
Audax omnia perpeti
Gens humana, ruit per vetitum nefas.
Audax Iapeti genus
Ignem fraud mala gentibus intulit.
Post ignem aetherea domo
Subductum, macies, and nova febrium
Terris incubuit cohors:
Semotique prius tarda necessitas
Lethi, corripuit gradum.
Expertus vacuum Daedalus a^ra
Pennis non homini datis;
Perrupit Acheronta Herculeus labor.
Nil mortalibus arduum est.
Coelum ipsum petimus stultitia: neque
Per nostrum patimur scelus
Iracunda Iovem porere fulmina.
ODE XVIII. Ad QUINTILIUM VARUM.
Vini potu moderato hilarari animum* immoderato ^ixas excitari.

NVllum, Vare, sacra vite prius severis arborem
Circa mite solum Tiburis, and moenia Catili.
Siccis omnia nam dura Deus proposuit: neque
Mordaces aliter diffugiunt sollicitudines.
Quis post vina gravem militiam aut pauperiem crep^^?
Quis non te potius Bacche pater, teque decens Ve^us?
At ne quis modici transiliat munera Liberi,
Centaurea monet cum Lapithis rixa super mer.
Debellata: monet Sithoniis no^ levis Evius:
Cum fas atque nefas exiguo fine libidinum
Discernunt avidi. Non ego te candide Bassareu
Invitum quatiam: nec variis obsita frondibus
Sub dium rapiam; saeva tene cum Berecynthio
Cornu tympana: quae subsequitur caecus amor sui,
Et toll^ns vacuum plus nimio gloria verticem,
Arcanique fides prodiga, perlucidior vitro.
ODE XXVII Ad SODALES.
Ad Sodales inter pocula rixantes, and poculis ipsis pugnantes, invitatus ut
bibat, id se ea lege facturum, si frater Megillae nomen amicae suae proferat,
vel sibi in aurem dicat.

NAtis in usum laetitiae scyphis
Pugnare, Thracum est. tollite barbarum
Morem: verecundumque Bacchum
Sanguineis prohibit rixis.
Vino and lucernis Medus acinaces
Immane quantum discrepat. impium
Lenite clamorem sodales,
Et cubito remanete presso.
Vultis severi me quoque sumere
Partem Falerni? dicat Opuntiae
Frater Megillae, quo beatus
Vulnere, qua pereat sagitta.
Cessat voluntas? non alia bibam
Mercede. quae te cumque domat Venus,
Non erubescendis adurit
Ignibus, ingenuoque semper
Amore peccas. quicquid habes, age,
Depone tutis auribus. ah miser,
Quanta laboras in Charibdi!
Digne puer meliore flamma.
Quae saga, quis te solvere Thessalis
Magus venenis, quis proterit Deus?
Vix illigatum te triformi
Pegasus expediet Chimaera.
ODE XXXI.
Se non opulentiam, sed tranquillam hilaren^que vitam ab Apolline poscere.

QVid dedicatum poscit Apollinem
Vates? quid orat, de patera novum
Fundens liquorem? non opimas
Sardiniae segetes feracis,
Non aestuosae grata Calabriae
Armenta: non aurum, aut ebur Indicum,
Non rura, quae Liris quieta
Mordet aqua, taciturnus amnis.
Premant Calena falce, quibus dedit
Fortuna vitem: dives and aureis
Mercator exsiccet culullis
Vina Syra reparata merce,
Diis carus ipsis: quippe ter and quater
Anno revisens aequor Atlanticum
Impune. Me pascunt olivae,
Me chicorea, levesque malvae.
Frui paratis and valido mihi
Latoe dones, and (precor) integra
Cum mente: nec turpem senectam
Degere, nec cithara carentem.
ODE XXIV. Ad VIRGILIUM
Deflet Quintilii Vari mortem.

QVis desidero sit pudor, aut modus
Tam cari capitis? praecipe lugubreis
Cantus Melpomene: cui liquidam pater
Vocem cum cithara dedit.
Ergo Quintilium perpetuus sopor
Vrget? cui pudor, and justitiae soror
Incorrupta fides, nudaque veritas,
Quando ullum invenient parem?
Multis ille bonis flebilis occidit:
Nulli flebilior, quam tibi Virgili.
Tu frustra pius, heu, non ita creditum,
Poscis Quintilium deos.
Quid si Threicio blandius Orpheo
Auditam moderere arboribus fidem?
Number vanae redeat sanguis imagini,
Quam virga semel horrida
Non lenis precibus fata recludere,
Nigro compulerit Mercurius gregi?
Durum; sed levius fit patientia,
Quicquid corrigere est nefas.
ODE XXXIV.
Poenitere se, quod dum Epicueram disciplinam sectaretur, parum studiose Deos
coluerit.

PArcus Deorum cultor, and infrequens,
Insanientis dum sapientiae
Consultus erro, nunc retrorsum
Vela dare, atque iterare cursus
Cogor relictos. Namque Diespiter
Igni corusco nubila dividens,
Plerumque per purum tonanteis
Egit equos, volucremque currum:
Quo bruta tellus, and vaga flumina,
Quo Styx, and invisi horrida Taenari
Seeds, Atlanteusque finis
Concutitur. Valet ima summis
Mutare, and insignem attenuat Deus,
Obscura promens; hinc apicem rapax
Fortuna cum stridore acuto
Sustulit: hic posuisse gaudet.
Q. HORATII FLACCI LIBER II. CARMINVM:
ODE I. Ad C. ASINIUM POLLIONEM.
Commendat scripta illius, quibus bella civilia complectebatur.

MOTVM ex Metello consule civicum,
Bellique causas, and vitia, and modos,
Ludumque Fortunae graviesque
Principum amicitias, and arma
Nondum expiatis uncta cruoribus,
Periculosae plenum opus aleae
Tractas, and incedis per igneis
Suppositos cineri doloso.
Paulum severae Musa tragoediae
Desit theatris: mox, ubi publicas
Res ordinaris, grande munus
Cecropio repetes cothurno,
Insigne moestis praesidium reis,
Et consulenti, Pollio, curiae;
Cui laurus aeternos honores
Dalmatico peperit triumpho.
Jam nunc minaci murmr cornuum
Perstringit aureis: jam litui strepunt:
Jam fulgor armorum fugaceis
Terret equos, equitumque vultus.
Audire magnos jam videor duces
Non indecoro pulvere sordidos,
Et cuncta terrarum subacta,
Praeter atrocem animum Catonis.
Juno, and deorum quisquis amicior
Afris, inulta cesserat impotens
Tellure, victorum nepotes
Rettulit inferias Jugurthae.
Quis non Latino sanguine pinguior
Campus, sepulchris impia proelia
Testatur, auditumque Medis
Hesperiae sonitum ruinae?
Qui gurges, aut quae flumina lugubris
Ignara* belli? quod mare Dauniae
Non decoloravere caedes?
Quae caret ora cruore nostro?
Sed ne, relictis Musa procax jocis,
C^ae retractes munera naeni^,
Mecum Dion^o sub antro
Quaere mod^s leviore plectro.
ODE II. Ad C. SALLUSTIUM CRISPUM.
Primo Proculejum laudat ob liberalitatem in fratres* deinde oftendit, eum qui
suas cupiditates reprimere, pecuniamque contemnere possit, solum regem, sol^m
beatum esse.

NVllus argento color est, ^varis
Abditae terris inimice lamnae
Crispe Salusti, nisi temperat^
Splendeat usu.
Vivet extento Proculejus aevo,
Notus in fratres animi paterni.
Illum aget penna metuente solvi
Fama superstes.
Latius regnes avidum domando
Spiritum, quam si Libyam remotis
Gadibus jungas, and uterque Poenus
Serviat uni.
Crescit indulgens sibi dirus hydrops:
Nec sitim pellit, nisi causa morbi
Fugerit venis, and aquosus albo
Corpore languor.
Redditum Cyri solio Phraaten
Dissidens plebi, numero beato-
Rum eximit virtus: populumque falsis
Dedocet uti
Vocibus; regnum and diadema tutum
Deferens uni, propriamque laurum,
Quisquis iugenteis oculo irretorto
Spectat acervos.
ODE III. Ad DELLIUM.
Neque demittendum adversis, neque efferendum secundis rebus animum: sed
hilariter vivendum, cum aequa sit omnibus moriendi conditio.

AEQuam memento rebus in arduis
Servare mentem: non secus in bonis
Ab insolenti temperatam
Laetitia, moriture Delli,
Seu moestus omni tempore vixeris:
Seu te in remoto gramine per dies
Festos reclinatum bearis
Interiore nota Falerni.
Qua pinus ingens, albaque populus
Vmbram hospitalem consociare amant
Ramis, qua obliquo laborat
Lympha fugax trepidare rivo:
Huc vina, and unguenta, and nimium breveis
Flores amoenae far jube rosae:
Dum res, and aetas, and sororum
Fila trium patiuntur atra.
Cedes coemtis saltibus, and domo,
Villaque, flavus quam Tiberis lavit,
Cedes: and exstructis in altum
Divitiis potietur haeres.
Divesne prisco natus ab Inacho,
Nil interest, an pauper, and infima
De gente sub di^ moreris,
Victima nil miserantis Orci.
Omnes eodem cogimur: omnium
Versatur urna: serius, ocyus,
Sors exitura: and nos in aeter --
Number exilium impositura cymba.
ODE IV. Ad XANTHIAM PHOCEUM.
Quod ancillam amet, non esse cur eam pudeat: multi^ enim magnis viris idem usu
venisse.

NE sit ancillae tibi amor pudori
Xanthia Phoceu; prius insolentem
Serva Briseis niveo color
Movit Achillem.
Movit Ajacem Telomone natum
Forma Captivae dominum Tecmessae.
Arsit Atrides medio in triumpho
Virgin rapta:
Barbarae postquam cecidere turmae
Thessalo victore: and ademptus Hector
Tradidit fessis leviora tolli
Pergama Grajis.
Nescias, an te generum beati
Phillydis flavae decorent parents.
Regium certe genus, and penateis
Moeret iniquos.
Creed non illam tibi de scelesta
Plebe delectam: neque sic fidelem,
Sic lucro aversam, potuisse nasci
Matre pudenda.
Brachia, and vultum, tereteisque suras,
Integer laudo. fuge suspicari,
Cujus octavum trepidavit aetas
Claudere lustrum.
ODE VIII. In BARINEM.
Non esse cur ei juranti credatur: Formosarum enim perjuria a diis non
vindicari.

VLla si juris tibi pejerati
Poena, Barine, nocuisset unquam:
Dente si nigro fieres vel uno
Turpior ungue,
Crederem. sed tu, simul obligast*
Perfidum votis caput, enitescis
Pulchrior multo, juvenumque prodis
Publica cura.
Expedit matris cineres opertos
Fallere, and toto taciturna noctis
Signa cum coelo, gelidaque divos
Morte carenteis.
Ridet hoc, inquam, Venus ipsa: rident
Simplices Nymphae, ferus and Cupido,
Semper ardenteis acueus sagittas
Cote cruenta.
Add, quod pubes tibi crescit omnis:
Servitus crescit nova: nec priores
Impiae tectum Dominae relinquunt,
Saepe minati.
Te suis matres metuunt juvencis:
Te senes parci: miseraeque nuper
Virgins nuptae; tua ne retardet
Aura maritos.
ODE X. Ad LICINIUM.
Retinendam esse mediocritatem, and animi in utraque fortuna aequalitatem.

REctius vives Licini neque altum
Semper urgendo: neque, dum procellas
Cautus horrescis, nimium premendo
Littus iniquum.
Auream quisquis mediocritatem
Diligit, tutus caret obsoleti
Sordibus tecti, caret invidendae
Sobrius aula.
Saepius ventis agitatur ingens
Pinus: and celsae graviore casu
Decidunt turres: feriuntque summos
Fulmina montes.
Sperat infestis, metuit secundis
Alteram sortembene praeparatum
Pectus; informeis hyemes reducit
Jupiter: idem
Summovet; non, fi male nunc, and olim
Sic erit. Quondam cithara tacentem
Suscitat Musam, neque semper arcum
Tendit Apollo.
Rebus angustis animosus, atque
Fortis appare. Sapienter idem
Contrahes vento nimium secundo
Turgida vela.
ODE XIII. In Arborem, cujus casu in agro Sabino paene oppressus est.
Nunquam homini satis exploratum esse, quid vitare debeat. Sapphonis and Alcaei
lauds.

ILle nefasto te posuit die,
Quicunque primum, and sacrilega manu
Produxit arbos, in nepotum
Perniciem, opprobriumque pagi.
Illum and parentis crediderim sui
Fregisse cervicem, and penetralia
Sparsisse nocturno cruore
Hospitis: ille venena Colchica,
Et quicquid usquam concipitur nefas
Tractavit, agro qui statuit meo
Te, triste lignum, te caducum
In domini caput immerentis.
Quid quisque vitet, nunquam homini satis
Cautum est in horas; navita Bosphorum
Poenus perhorrescit, neque ultra
Caeca timet aliunde fata;
Miles sagittas, and celerem fugam
Parthi: catenas Parthus, and Italum
Robur. Sed improvisa lethi
Vis rapuit, rapietque genteis.
Quam paene furvae regna Proserpinae,
Et judicantem vidimus Aeacum,
Sedeisque descriptas piorum, and
Aeoliis fidibus querentem
Sappho puellis de popularibus!
Et te sonantem before aureo,
Alcaee, plectro, dura navis,
Dura fugae mala, dura belli!
Vtrum^sue sacro digna silentio
Mirantur umbrae dicere: sed magis
Pugnas, and exactos tyrannos
Densum humeris bibit aure vulgus.
Quid mirum, vbi illis carminibus stupens
Demittit atras bellua centiceps
Aureis? and intorti capillis
Eumenidum recreantur angues?
Quin and Prometheus and Pelopis paren^
Dulci laborum decipitur sono:
Nec curat Orion leones,
Aut timidos agitare lyncas.
ODE XIV. Ad POSTHUMUM.
Mortem vitari non posse.

EHeu, fugaces, Posthume, Posthume,
Labuntur anni: nec pietas moram
Rugis, and instanti senectae
Afferet, indomitaeque morti.
Non si trecenis, quotquot eunt dies,
Amice, places illachrymabilem
Plutona tauris: qui ter amplum
Geryonem Tityonque tristi
Compescit unda, scilicet omnibus,
Quicunque terrae munere vescimur,
Enaviganda, sive reges,
Sive inopes erimus coloni.
Frustra cruento Mart carebimus:
Fractisque rauci fluctibus Adriae.
Frustra per autumnos nocentem
Corporibus metuemus Austrum.
Visendus ater flumine languido
Cocytus errans, and Danai genus
Infame, damnatusque longi
Sisyphus Aeolides laboris.
Linquenda tellus, and domus, and placens
Vxor: neque harum quas colis arborum
Te praeter invisas cupressos,
Vlla brevem dominum sequetur.
Absumet haeres Caecuba dignior.
Servata centum clavibus: and mero
Tinget pavimentum superbum
Pontificum potiore ^oenis.
ODE XV. Ad SUI SAECULI LUXURIAM.
I Am pauca aratro jugera regiae
Moles relinquent: undique latius
Extenta visentur Lucrino
Stagna lacu: platanusque coelebs
Evincet ulmos. Tum violaria, and
Myrtus, and omnis copia narium
Spargent olivetis odorem,
Fertilibus domino priori;
Dum spissa ramis laurea fervidos
Excludet ictus; non ita Romuli
Praesciptum, and intonsi Catonis
Auspiciis, veterumque norma.
Privatus illis sensus erat brevis:
Commune magnum. Nulla decempedis
Metata privatis, opacam
Porticus excipiebat Arcton:
Nec fortuitum spernere cespitem
Leges sinebant: oppida publico
Sumptu jubentes, and deorum
Templa novo decorare saxe.
ODE XVI. Ad GROSPHUM.
Tranquillitatem animi optari ab omnibus: eam vero non congerendis opibus
honoribusve consequendis, sed coercendis cupiditatibus compa^ari.

OTium divos rogat in patenti
Prensus Aegaeo, simul atra nubes
Condidit Lunam, neque certa fulgent Sidera nautis:
Otium bello furiosa Thrace,
Otium Medi pharetra decori,
Grosphe, non gemmis, neque purpura venale neque auro:
Non enim gazae, neque consularis
Summovet lictor miseros tumultus
Mentis, and curas laqueata circum Tecta volanteis.
Vivitur parvo been, cui paternum
Splendet in mensa tenui salinum,
Nec leveis somnos timor, aut Cupido Sordidus aufert.
Quid brevi fortes jaculamur aevo
Multa? quid terras alio ^alenteis
Sole mutamus? patriae quis exul Se quoque fugit?
Scandit aeratas vitiosa naveis
Cura: nec turmas equitum relinquit,
Ocyor cervis, and agente nimbos Ocyor Euro.
Laetus in praesens animus, quod ultra est
Oderit curare: and amara laeto
Temperet risu. Nihil est ab omni Part beatum.
Abstulit clarum cita mors Achillem,
Longa Tithonum minuit senectus:
Et mihi forsan, tibi quod negarit, Porriget hora.
Te greges centum, Siculaeque circum
Mugiunt vaccae, tibi tollit hinni-
Tum apta quadrigis equa: te bis Afro M^rice tinctae
Vestiunt lanae: mihi parva rura, and
Spiritum Grajae tenuem Camoenae
Parca non mendax dedit, and malignum Spernere vulgus.
ODE XVII. Ad MAECENATEM AEGROTUM.
Negat se ei superstitem velle esse.

CVr me querelis exanimas tuis?
Nec dis amicum est, nec mihi, te prius
Obire, Maecenas, mearum
Grande decus columenque rerum.
Ah, te meae si partem animae rapit
Maturior vis, quid moror altera,
Nec carus aeque, nec superstes
Integer? ille dies utramque
Ducet ruinam: non ego perfidum
Dixi sacramentum. ibimus ibimus,
Vtcumque praecedes, supremum
Carpere iter comites parati.
Me nec Chimaerae spiritus igneae,
Nec si resurgat centimanus Gyas,
Divellet unquam; sic potenti
Justitiae, placitumque Parcis.
Seu Libra, seu me Scorpius aspicit
Formidolosus, pars violentior
Natalis horae, seu tyrannus
Hesperiae Capricornus undae:
Vtrumque nostrum incredibili modo
Consentit astrum* te Jovis impio
Tutela Saturno refulgens
Eripuit, v^lucrisque fati
Tardavit alas, cum populus frequens*
Laetum theatris ter crepuit sonum:
Me truncus illapsus cerebro
Sustulerat, nisi Faunus ictum
Dextraque levasset, Mercurialium
Custos virorum* reddere victimas,
Aedemque votivam memento:
Nos humilem feriemus agnam.
Q. HORATII FLACCI LIBER III. CARMINVM:
ODE I.
Non opibus aut honoribus, sed animi tranquillitate vitam beatam effici.

ODi profanum vulgus, and arceo.
Favete linguis; carmina non prius
Audita, Musarum sacerdos,
Virginibus, puerisque canto.
Regum timendorum in proprios greges,
Reges in ipsos imperium est Jovis
Clari Giganteo triumpho,
Cuncta supercilio moventis.
Est ut viro vir latius ordinet
Arbusta sulcis: hic generosior
Descendat in campum petitor:
Moribus hic meliorque fama
Contendat: illi turba clientum
Sit major. Ae QV A lege necessitas
Sortitur insigneis, and imos,
Omne capax movet urna nomen.
Districtus ensis cui super impia
Cervice pendet, non Siculae dapes
Dulcem elaborabunt saporem:
Non avium citharaeque cantus
Somnum reducent. somnus agrestium
Lenis virorum non humileis domos
Fastidit, umbrosamque ripam,
Non Zephyris agitata Tempe.
Desiderantem quod satis est, neque
Tumultuosum sollicitat mare,
Nec saevus Arcturi cadentis
Impetus, aut orientis Haedi;
Non verberatae grandine vineae,
Fundusque mendax, arbore nunc aquas
Culpante, nunc torrentia agros
Sidera, nunc hiemes iniquas.
Contracta pisces aequora sentiunt,
Jactis in altum molibus; huc frequens
Caementa dimittit redemtor
Cum famulis dominusque terrae
Fastidiosus. sed timor, and minae
Scandunt eodem, quo dominus: neque
Decedit aerata triremi, and
Post equitem sedet atra cura.
Quod si dolentem nec Phryoius lapis,
Nec purpurarum sidere clarior
Delenit usus, nec Falerna
Vitis, Achaemeniumque costum;
Cur invidendis postibus, and novo
Sublime ritu moliar atrium?
Cur valle permutem Sabina
Divitias operosiores?
ODE III.
Virtute praeditum virum nihil extimescere; oration Junonis de Troja eversa,
bello Trojano finito, imperio Romano a Trojanis initium capturo.

JVstum, and tenacem propositi virum,
Non civium ardor prava jubentium,
Non vultus instantis tyranni
Mente quatit solida, neque Auster,
Dux inquieti turbidus Adriae,
Nec fulminantis magna Jovis manus.
Si fractus illabatur orbis,
Impavidum ferient ruinae.
Hac art Pollux, and vagus Hercules
Innixus, arceis attigit igneas:
Quos inter Augustus recumbens
Purpureo bibit ore nectar.
Hac te merentem, Bacche pater, tuae
Vexere tigres, indocili jugum
Collo trahentes: hac Quirinus
Martis equis Acheronta fugit:
Gratum elocuta concitiantibus
Junone divis. Ilion, Ilion
Fatalis incestusque judex,
Et mulier peregrina vertit
In pulverem, ex quo destituit deos
Mercede pacta Laomedon: mihi,
Castaeque damnatum Minervae
Cum populo, and duce fraudulento.
Jam nec Lacaenae splendet adulterae
Famosus hospes: nec Priami domus
Perjura pugnaceis Achivos
Hectoreis opibus refringit:
Nostrisque ductum seditionibus
Bellum resedit: protenus and graveis
Iras, and invisum nepotem,
Troica quem peperit sacerdos,
Marti redonabo; illum ego lucidas
Inire sedeis, ducere nectaris
Succos, and adscribi quietis
Ordinibus patiar deorum.
Dum longus inter saeviat Ilion
Romamque pontus; qualibet exules
In part regnanto beati.
Dum Priami Paridisque busto
Insultet armentum, and catulos ferae
Celent inultae; stet Capitolium
Fulgens, triumphatisque possit
Roma ferox dare jura Medis.
Horrenda late, nomen in ultimas
Extendat oras, qua medius liquor
Secernit Europen ab Afro,
Qua tumidus rigat arva Nilus.
Aurum irrepertum, and sic melius situm,
Cum terra celat, spernere fortior,
Quam cogere humanos in usus,
Omne sacrum rapiente dextra.
Quicunque mundi terminus obstitit,
Hunc tangat armis, visere gestiens,
Qua part debacchentur ignes,
Qua nebulae, pluvisque rores.
Sed Bellicosis fata Quiritibus
Hac lege dico, ne nimium pii,
Rebusque fidentes, avitae
Tecta velint reparare Trojae:
Trojae renascens alite lugubri
Fortuna, tristi clade iterabitur;
Ducente victriceis catervas
Conjuge me Jovis, and sorore,
Ter si resurgat murus aeneus
Auctore Phoebo; ter pereat meis
Exscissus Argivis; te^ uxor
Capta virum puerosque ploret.
Non haec jocosae convenient lyrae.
Quo Musa tendis: desine pervicax
Refer sermones deorum, and
Magna modis tenuare parvis.
ODE IV. Ad CALLIOPEN.
Se a multis periculis, Musarum open ereptum fuisse. Male ^^ssisse omnibus qui
adversum deos aliquid moliri voluerint.

Descend coelo, and dic, age, tibia
Regina, longum, Calliope, melos;
Seu voce nunc mavis acuta,
Seu fidibus, citharave Phoebi.
Auditis? an me ludit amabilis
Insania? audire, and videor pios
Errare per lucos, amoenae
Quos and aquae subeunt, and aurae.
Me fabulosae Vulture in Appulo,
Altricis extra limen Appuliae,
Ludo, fatigatumque somno,
Fronde nova puerum palumbes
Texere: mirum quod foret omnibus,
Quicunque celsae nidum Acherontiae,
Saltusque Bantinos, and arvum
Pingue tenent humilis Ferenti,
Vt tuto ab atris corpore viperis
Dormirem, and ursis: ut premerer sacra
Lauroque collataque myrto,
Non sine Diis animosus infans.
Vester, Camoenae, vester in arduos
Tollor Sabinos: seu mihi frigidum
Praeneste, seu Tibur supinum,
Seu liquidae placuere Bajae.

Non me Philippis versa acies retro,
Devota non extinxit arbor,
Nec Sicula Palinurus unda.
Vtcunque mecum vos eritis, libens
Insanientem navita Bosphorum

Visam Britannos hospitibus feros,
Et laetum equino sanguine Concanum.
Visam pharetratos Gelonos,
Et Scythicum inviolatus amnem.

Gaudetis almae. scimus, ut impios
Titanas, immanemque turmam
Fulmine sustulerit caduco:
Qui terram inertem, qui mare temperat
Ventosum, and urbeis, regnaque tristia,
Divosque, mortaleisque turbas
Imperio regit unus aequo.
Magnum illa terrorem intulerat Jovi
Fidens, juventus horrida brachiis:
Fratresque tendentes opaco
Pelion imposuisse Olympo.
Sed quid Typhoeus, and validus Mimas,
Aut quid minaci Porphyrion statu,
Quid Rhoecus, evulsisque truncis
Enceladus jaculator audax,
Contra sonantem Palladis Aegida
Possent ruentes? hinc avidus stetit
Vulcanus, hinc matrona Juno, and
Nunquam humeris positurus arcum,
Qui rore puro Castaliae lavit
Crineis solutos, qui Lyciae tenet
Dumeta, natalemque sylvam,
Delius, and Patareus Apollo.
Vis consili expers mole ruit sua:
Vim temperatam di quoque provehunt
In majus: Idem odere vireis
Omne nefas animo moventeis.
Testis mearum centimanus Gyges
Sententiarum notus, and integrae
Tentator Orion Dianae,
Virginea domitus sagitta.
Injecta monstris terra dolet suis:
Moeretque partus fulmine luridum
Missos ad Orcum: nec peredit
Impositam celer ignis Aetnam:
Incontinentis nec Tityi jecur
Relinquit ales, nequitiae additus
Custos: amatorem trecentae
Perithoum cohibent catenae.
ODE V. AUGUSTI LAUDS.
Reguli constantia, and ad Poenos reditus.

CAelo tonantem credidimus Jovem
Regnare. praesens divus habebitur
Augustus, abjectis Britannis
Imperio, gravibusque Persis.
Milesne Crassi, conjuge barbara
Turpis maritus vixit? and hostium
(Proh curia, inversique mores)
Consenuit socerorum in armis,
Sub Rege Medo Marsus, and Appulus,
Anciliorum nominis, and togae
Oblitus, aeternaeque Vestae,
Incolumi Jove, and urbe Roma?
Hoc caverat men's provida Reguli,
Dissentientis conditionibus.
Foedis, and exemplo trahenti
Perniciem veniens in aevum,
Si non periret immiserabilis
Captiva pubes. Signa ego Punicis
Affixa delubris and arma
Militibus sine caede, dixit,
Direpta vidi. vidi ego civium
Retorta tergo brachia libero,
Portasque non clausas, and arva
Mart coli populata nostro.
Auro repensus scilicet acrior
Miles redibit* flagitio additis
Damnum: neque amissos colores
Lana refert medicata fuco:
Nec vera virtus, cum semel excidit,
Curat reponi deterioribus.
Si pugnat extricata densis
Cerva plagis, erit ille fortis,
Qui perfidis se credidit hostibus:
Et Mart Poenos proteret altero,
Qui lora restrictis lacertis
Sensit iners, timuitque mortem.
Hic unde vitam sumeret inscius,
Pacem duello miscuit. O pudor!
O magna Carthago, probrosis
Altior Italiae ruinis*
Fertur pudicae conjugis osculum,
Parvosque natos, ut capitis minor,
Ab se removisse, and virilem
Torvus humi posuisse vultum.
Donec labanteis consilio patres
Firmaret auctor nuuquam alias dato
Interque merenteis amicos
Egregius properaret exul.
Atqui sciebat, quae sibi barbarus
Tortor pararet: non aliter tamen
Dimovit obstanteis propinquos,
Et populum reditus morantem,
Quam si clientum longa negotia
Dijudicata lite relinqueret;
Tendens Venafranos in agros,
Aut Lacedaemonium Tarentum.
ODE VII. Ad ASTERIEN.
Con^olatur eam de viri sui absentia moestam, ^ac solicitam.

QVid fles Asterie, quem tibi candidi
Prim^ restituent vere Favonii,
Thyna merce beatum
Constanti juv^enem fide
Gygen? Ille notis actus ad Oricum
Post insana Caphae sydera* frigidas
Noctes non sine multis
Insomnis lachrymis agit.
Atqui sollicitae nuntius hospitae,
Suspirare Chloen, and miseram tuis
Dicens ignibus uri,
Tentat mill va^er modis.
Vt Proetum mulier perfid^ credulu^
Falsis imp^lerit criminibus, nimis
Casto Bellerophonti
Maturare necem refert.
Narrat paene datum Pelea Tartar^,
Magnessam Hyppoliten dum fugit abstinens*
Et peccare docentes
Fallax historias monet:
Frustra. nam scopulis surdior Icari
Voces audit adhuc integer at, tibi
Ne vicinus Enipeus
Plus justo placeat, cave:
Quamvis non alius flectere equum scien^
Aeque conspicitur gramine Martio:
Nec quisquam citus aeque
Tusco denatat alveo.
Prima nocte domum claude: neque in vias
Sub cantum querulae despice tibiae:
Et te saepe vocanti
Duram, difficilis mane.
ODE IX. Ad LYDIAM.
Dialogus Horatii and Lydiae.

HO. DOnec gratus eram tibi,
Nec quisquam potior brachia candidae
Cervici juvenis dabat,
Persarum vigui rege beatior.

LY. Donec non alia magis
Arsisti, neque erat Lydia post Chloen:
Multi Lydia nominis
Romana vigui clarior Ilia.

HO. Me nunc Thressa Chloe regit,
Dulces docta modos, and citharae sciens:
Pro qua non metuam mori,
Si parcent animae fata superstiti.

LY. Me torret face mutua
Thurini Calais filius Ornithi;
Pro quo bis patiar mori,
Si parcent puero fata superstiti.

HO. Quid si prisca redit Venus?
Diductosque jugo cogit aheneo?
Si flava ex^utitur Chlo,
Rejectaeque patet janua Lydiae?

LY. Quanquam sydere pulchrior
Ille est; tu levior cortice, and improbo
Iracundior Adria:
Tecum vivere amem, tecum obeam libens.

ODE XI. Ad MERCURIUM.
Ut cantus sibi dictet, quibus Lyde flecti possit. D^^aidum fabula.

MErcuri (nam te docilis magistro
Movit Amphion lapides, cane^d^)
Tuque testudo, resonare septem
Callida nervis*
(Nec loquax olim neque grata, nunc and
Divitum mensis and amica templis)
Dic modos, Lyde quibus obstinatas
Applicet aures.
Quae, velut latis equa prima campis,
Ludit exultim: metuitque tangi,
Nuptiarum expers, and adhuc proterv^
Cruda marito.
Tu potes tigres comitesque sylvas
Ducere, and rivos celeres morari.
Cessit immanis tibi blandienti
Janitor aulae
Cerberus, quamvis furiale centum
Muniant angues caput ejus, atque
Spiritus teter saniesque manet
Ore trilingui.
Quin and Ixion Tityusque vultu
Risit invito: stetit urna paulum
Sicca, dum gra^o Danai puellas
Carmine mulces.
Audiat Lyde scelus atque notas
Virginum poenas, and inane lymphae
Dolium fundo pereuntis imo,
Seraque fata,
Quae manent culpas etiam sub Orc^
Impiae: nam quid potuere majus?
Impiae sponsos potuere duro
Perdere ferro.
Vna de multis face nuptiali
Digna, perjurum fuit in parentem
Splendide mendax, and in omne virgo
Nobilis aevum;
Surge (quae dixit juveni marito)
Surge, ne longus tibi somnus, unde
Non times, detur* socerum and scelestas
Fall sorores,
Quae, velut nactae vitulos leaenae,
Singulos (eheu) lacerant; ego illis
Mollior, nec te feriam, nee intra
Claustra tenebo.
Me pater saevis oneret catenis,
Quod viro clemens misero peperci:
Me vel extremos Numidarum in agros
Class relegat.
I, pedes quo te rapiunt and aurae:
Dum favet nox and Venus: I secundo
Omine, and nostri memorem sepulchro
Sculpe querelam.
ODE XVI. Ad C. MAECENATEM.
Quanta sit ad omnia expugnanda, etiam ad pudicitiam, vis auri, exemplis docet.
Sed esse id pecuniae insitum, ut nulla ejus copia satiet, and crescente ea
crescat simul cura and sollicitudo. Ideoque beatum esse qui mediocritate
contentus vivit.

INclusam Danaen turris ahenea,
Robustaeque fores, and vigilum canum
Tristes excubiae munierant satis
Nocturnis ab adulteris:
Si non Acrisium, virginis abditae
Custodem pavidum, Jupiter and Venus
Risissent: fore enim tutum iter and patens,
Converso in pretium deo.
Aurum per medios ire satellites,
Et perrumpere amat saxa, potentius

Argivi domus, ob lucrum
Demersa excidio. diffidit urbium
Portas vir Macedo, and subruit aemulos
Reges muneribus. munera navium
Saevos illaqueant duces.
Crescentem sequitur cura pecuniam,
Majorumque fames jure perhorrui
Late conspicuum tollere verticem,
Moecenas, equitum decus.
Quanto quisque sibi plura negaverit,
A dis plura feret. nil cupientium
Nudus castra peto: and transfuga divitum
Parts linquere gestio,
Contemptae dominus splendidior rei,
Quam si quicquid arat non piger Appulus,
Occultare meis dicerer horreis,
Magnas inter opes inops.
Purae rivus aquae, sylvaque jugerum
Paucorum, and segetis certa fides meae,
Fulgentem imperio fertilis Africae
Fallit sort beatior.
Quanquam nec Calabrae mella ferunt apes,
Nec Laestrygonia Bacchus in amphora
Languescit mihi, nec pinguia Gallicis
Crescunt vellera pascuis:
Importuna tamen pauperies abest:
Nec, si plura velim, tu dare deneges;
Contracto melius parva cupidine
Vectigalia porrigam,
Quam si Mygdoniis regnum Halyattici
Campis continuem. Multa petentibus
Desunt multa. been est, cui deus obtulit
Parca, quod satis est, manu.
ODE XXIV. In DIVITES AVAROS.
In avaros invehitur, qui domos domibus subinde addunt, in ipso etiam mari
aedificantes: cum tamen nulla aedificia necessitate mortis eos liberare
possint. Scythas, qui plaustris domos suas trahant, and in commune agros
colant, feliciores esse ait. Quinetiam eam morum corruptelam and peccandi
licentiam apud hos esse negat, quae sit apud Romanos. Ad haec autem mala
extirpanda una cum prava illa augen i opes cupiditate, disciplina asperiore
opus esse dicit. d

INtactis opulentior
Thesauris Arabum, and divitis Indiae,
Coementis licet occupes
Tyrrhenum omne tuis and mare Ponticum:
Si figit adamantinos
Summis verticibus dira necessitas
Clavos: non animum metu,
Non mortis laqueis expedies caput.
Campestres melius Scythae
(Quorum plaustra vagas rite trahunt domos)
Vivunt, and rigidi ^etae,
Immetata quibus jugera liberas
Fruges and Cererem ferunt:
Nec cultura placet longior annua:
Defunctumque laboribus
Aequati recreat sort vicarius.
Illic matre carentibus
Privignis mulier temperat innocens:
Nec dotata regit virum
Conjux, nec nitido fidit adultero.
Dos est magna, parentium
Virtus, and metuens alterius viri
Certo foedere castitas.
Et peccare nefas, aut pretium est mori.
O quisquis volet impias
Caedes and rabiem tollere civiacm:
Si quaeret pater urbium
Subscribi statuis, indomitam audeat
Refraenare licentiam,
Clarus postgenitis, quatenus, heu nefas!
Virtutem incolumem odimus,
Sublatam ex oculis quaerimus invidi.
Quid tristes querimoniae,
Si non supplicio culpa reciditur?
Quid leges sine moribus
Vanae proficiunt? si, neque fervidis
Pars inclusa caloribus

Durataeque solo nives*
Mercatorem abigunt? horrida callidi
Vincunt aequora navitae?
Magnum pauperies opprobrium jubet
Quidvis and facere and pati,
Virtutisque viam deserit arduae.
Vel nos in Capitolium,
Quo clamor vocat and turba faventium:
Vel nos in mare proximum

ODE XXVII. Ad GALATEAM NAVIGATURAM.
Deterret eam praecipue exemplo Europae.

IMpios parrae recinentis omen
Ducat, and praegnans canis, aut ab agra
Rava decurrens lupa Lanuvino,

Antequam stantes repetat paludes

Sed vides quanto trepidet tumultu
Pronus Orion* ego, quid sit ater

Impudens Orcum moror. o deorum
Si quis haec audis, utinam inter errem

Antequam turpis macies decentes
Occupet malas, teneraeque succus

Quid mori cessas? potes hac ab orno

Sive te rupes and acuta letho

Quod fugiens semel hora vexit.

Transmutat incertos honores,
Nunc mihi, nunc alii benigna.
Laudo manentem: si celeres quatit
Pennas, resigno quae dedit, and mea
Virtute me involvo, probamque
Pauperiem sine dote quaero.
Non est meum, si mugiat Africis
Malus procellis, ad miseras preces

ODE II. Ad ANTONIUM IULUM.
Pindarum esse ejusmodi poetam, ut siquis eum imitari conetur, non minus famae
suae periculum sit aditurus, quam si cum Icaro pennis Daedaleis coelo se
credere audeat. Deinde ut Pindarum cygno alte volanti, ita se api grata thyma
laboriose carpenti comparat: ideoque ipsum Antonium ad celebrandam majore
plectro Caesaris victoriam hortatur.

PIndarum quisquis studet aemulari, I-
Vle, ceratis open Daedalea

Nomina ponto.
Monte decurrens velut amnis, imbres
Quem super notas aluere ripas,

Flebili sponsae juvenemve raptum
Plorat: and vires animumque mores-
Que aureos educit in astra, nigro-

Per sacrum clivum, merita decorus
Fronde, Sicambros:
Quo nihil majus, meliusve terris
Fata donavere, bonique divi,
Nec dabunt, quamvis redeant in aurum
Tempora priscum.
Concines laetosque dies, and urbis
Publicum ludum, super impetrato
Fortis Augusti reditu, forumque
Litibus orbum.
Tum meae (si quid loquar audiendum)
Vocis accedet bona pars: and o sol
Pulcher, o laudande, canam, recepto
Caesare foelix.
Tuque dum procedis, Io triumph,
Non semel dicemus, Io triumph,
Civitas omnis: dabimusque divis
Thura benignis.
Te december tauri, totidemque vaccae,
Me tener solvet vitulus relicta
Matre, qui largis juvenescit herbis
In mea vota;
Front curvatos imitatus ignes
Tertium Lunae referentis ortum,
Qua notam duxit, niveus videri,
Caetera fulvus.
ODE III. Ad MELPOMENEN.
Se natum esse ad poeticen, ejusque beneficio nominis immortalitatem and
gloriam consecuturum esse.

OVem tu Melpomene semel
Nascentem placido lumine videris,
Illum non labor Isthmius
Clarabit pugilem, non equus impiger
Curru ducet Achaico
Victorem: neque res bellica Deliis
Ornatum foliis ducem,
Quod regum tumidas contuderit minas,
Ostendet Capitolio:
Sed quae Tibur aquae fertile perfluunt,
Et spissae nemorum comae,
Fingent Aeolio carmine nobilem.
Romae principis urbium
Dignatur soboles inter amabiles
Vatum ponere me choros:
Et jam dente minus mordeor in vido.
O, testudinis aureae
Dulcem quae strepitum Pieri temperas!
O, mutis quoque piscibus
Donatura cygni, si libeat, sonum!
Totum muneris hoc tui est,
Quod monstror digito praetereuntium
Romanae fidicen lyrae:
Quod spiro, and placeo (si placeo) tuum est
ODE IV.
Drusi Neronis, qui fuit Augusti Caesaris privignus, victorias de Rhoetis and
Vindelicis celebrat. Quin etiam Claudii Neronis fortia quaedam facta
commemorat. Tandem vero and totius gentis Romanae fortitudinem ore hostis
(nimirum Annibalis) laudat. Sed de Druso loquens poeta, disciplinam and
educationem multum ad virtutem posse ostendit, aliquam ha^umejus laudum partem
in Augustum derivans.

OValem ministrum fulminis alitem,
(Cui Rex deorum regnum in aves vagas
Permisit, expertus fidelem
Jupiter in Ganymede flavo)
Olim juventas and patrius vigor
Nido laborum propulit inscium:
Vernique jam nimbis remotis,
Insolitos docuere nisus
Venti paventem: mox in ovilia
Demisit hostem vividus impetus:
Nunc in reluctantes dracones
Egit amor dapis atque pugnae:
Qualemve laetis caprea pascuis
Intenta, fulvae matris ab ubere
Jam lacte depulsum leonem,
Dente novo peritura vidit:
Videre Rhoeti bella sub Alpibus
Drusum gerentem and Vindelici, quibus
Mos unde deductus per omne
Tempus Amazonia securi
Dextras obarmet, quaerere distuli:
(Nec scire fas est omnia) sed diu
Lateque victrices catervae
Consiliis juvenis revictae
Sensere, quid men's rite, quid indoles
Nutrita faustis sub penetralibus
Posset, quid Augusti paternus
In pueros animus Nerones.
Fortes creantur fortibus, and bonis:
Est in juvencis, est in equis patrum
Virtus; nec imbellem feroces
Progenerant aquilae columbam.
Doctrina sed vim promovet insitam,
Rectique cultus pectora roborant.
Vtcunque defecere mores,
Dedecorant been nata culpae.
Quid debeas, o Roma, Neronibus,
Testis Metaurum flumen, and Asdrubal
Devictus, and pulcher fugatis
Ille dies Latio tenebris,
Qui primus alma risit adorea,
Dirus per urbes Afer ut Italas,
Ceu flamma per tedas, vel Eurus
Per Siculas equitavit undas.
Post hoc secundis usque laboribus
Romana pubes crevit: and impio
Vastata Poenorum tumultu,
Fana deos habuere rectos.
Dixitque tandem perfidus Annibat,
Cervi, luporum praeda rapacium,
Sectamur ultro, quos opimus
Fallere and effugere est triumphus.
Gens, quae cremato fortis ab Ilio
Jactata Thuscis aequoribus, sacra,
Natosque, maturosque patres
Pertulit Ausonias ad urbes,
Duris ut ilex tonsa bipennibus
Nigrae feraci frondis in Algido,
Per damna, per caedes, ab ipso
Ducit opes animumque ferro.
Non Hydra secto corpore firmior
Vinci dolentem crevit in Herculem:
Monstrumve summisere Colchi
Majus, Echioniaeve Thebae.
Merses profundo, pulchrior evenit:
Luctere, multa proruet integrum
Cum laud victorem: geretq
Praelia conjugibus loquenda ue
Carthagini jam non ego nuntios
Mittam superbos: occidit, occidit
Spes omnis, and fortuna nostri
Nominis, Asdrubale interempto.
Nil Claudiae non efficient manus:
Quas and benigno numine Jupiter
Defendit, and curae sagaces
Expediunt per acuta belli.
ODE V. Ad AUGUSTUM.
Augustum, ut reditum suum omnibus optatissimum, maturet, precatur: and quam
felix sit ejus beneficio rerum Romanarum status, commemorat. Unde illum, non
aliter quam olim in Graecia Castorem ac Herculem, coli dicit.

DIvis orte bonis, optime Romulae
Custos gentis, abes jam nimium diu:
Maturum reditum pollicitus patrum
Sancto concilio, redi.
Lucem read tuae, dux bone, patriae;
Instar veris enim vultus ubi tuus
Affulsit populo, gratior it dies,
Et soles melius nitent.
Vt matter juvenem, quem Notus invido
Flatu Carpathii trans maris aequora
Cunctantem spatio longius annuo
Dulci distinet a domo,
Votis, ominibusque and precibus vocat,
Curvo nec faciem littore dimovet:
Sic, desideriis icta fidelibus,
Quaerit patria Caesarem.
Tutus bos etenim rura perambulat:
Nutrit rura Ceres, almaque Faustitas:
Pacatum volitant per mare navitae.
Culpari metuit fides:
Nullis polluitur casta domus stupris:
Mos and lex maculosum edomuit nefas:
Laudantur simili prole puerperae:
Culpam poena premit comes.
Quis Parthum paveat? quis gelidum Scythen?
Quis, Germania quos borrida parturit
Foetus, incolumi Caesare? quis ferae
Bellum curet Iberiae?
Condit quisque diem collibus in suis,
Et vitem viduas ducit ad arbores:
Hinc ad vina redit laetus, and alteris
Te mensis adhibet deum.
Te multa prece, te prosequitur mero
Defuso pateris: and Laribus tuum
Miscet numen, uti Graecia Castoris,
Et magni memor Herculis.
Longas o utinam dux bone ferias
Praestes Hesperlae, dicimus integro
Sicci mane die, dicimus nvidi,
Cum Sol Oceano subest.
ODE VII. Ad L. MANLIUM TORQUATUM.
Veris adven^* and aequa omnibus hominibus moriendi condition sine s^e
reviviscendi, omniumque rerum mutatione and vicissitudine proposita, invitat ad
hilariter jucundeque vivendum.

DIffugere nives, redeunt jam gramina campis,
Arboribusque com^.
Mutat terra vices, and decrescentia ripas
Flumina praetereunt.
Gratia cum Nymphis geminisque sororibus audit
Ducere nuda choros.
Immortalia ne speres monet annus, and almum
Quae rapit hora diem.
Frigora ^ites^unt Zephyris: ver preterit aestas
Interitura, sim^^
Pomifer autumnus fruges effuderit: and mox
Bruma recurret iners.
Damna tamen celeres reparent coelestia lunae:
Nos ubi decidimus
Quo pius Aeneas, quo Tullus dives, and Ancus,
Pulvis and umbra sumus.
Quis scit an adjiciant hodiernae crastina summae
Tempora Di superi?
Cunta manus avidas fugient h^redis, amico
Quae dederis animo.
Quum semel occideris, and de te splendida Minos
Fecerit arbitria,
Non, Torquate, genus* non te facundia, non te
Restituet pietas.
Infernis neque enim tenebris Diana pudicum
Liberat Hippolytum:
Nec Lethaea valet Theseus abrumpere charo
Vincula Perithoo.
ODE VIII. Ad MARTIUM CENSORINUM.
Nihil esse carminibus potentius ad sempiternam sui nominis memoriam posteris
prodendam, atque ab oblivione hominum vindicandam.

DOnarem pateras, grataque commodus
Censorine, meis era sodalibus:
Donarem tripodas, praemia fortium
Grajorum: neque tu pessima munerum
Ferres: divite me scilicet artium,
Quas aut Parrhasius protulit aut Scopas;
Hic saxo, liquidis ille coloribus
Solers nunc hominem ponere, nunc deum.
Sed non haec mihi vis: non tibi talium
Res est aut animus deliciarum egens.
Gaudes carminibus: carmina possumus
Donare and pretium dicere muneris.
Non incisa notis marmora publicis,
Per quae spiritus and vita redit bonis
Post mortem ducibus: non celeres fugae,
Rejectaeque retrorsum Annibalis minae;
Non incendia Carthaginis impiae,
Ejus, qui domita nomen ab Africa
Lucratus rediit, clarius indicant
Lauds, quam Calabrae Pierides: neque,
Si chartae sileant quod been feceris,
Mercedem tuleris. quid foret Iliae
Mavortisque puer, si taciturnitas
Obstaret meritis invida Romuli?
Ereptum Stygiis fluctibus Aeacum
Virtus, and favor, and lingua potentium
Vatum divitibus consecrat insulis.
Dignum laud virum Musa vetat mori.
Coelo Musa beat. sic Jovis interest
Optatis epulis impiger Hercules:
Clarum Tyndaridae sidus ab infimis
Quassas eripiunt aequoribus rates:
Ornatus viridi tempora pampino
Liber vota bonos ducit ad exitus.
ODE. IX. Ad LOLLIUM.
Scripta sua nunquam interitura. Sine poetarum open Virtutem oblivione
sempiterna deleri. Se suis versibus res a Lollio gestas memoriae proditurum.
Laus constantiae, abstinentiae, and caeterarum virtutum.

NE forte credas interitura, quae
Long sonantem natus ad Aufidum,
Non ante vulgatas per arts
Verba loquor socianda chordis:
Non, si priores Maeonius tenet
Seeds Homerus, Pindaricae latent,

Nec, si quid olim lusit Anacreon,
Delevit aetas. spirat adhuc amor,
Vivuntque commissi calores
Aeoliae fidibus puellae.
Non sola comptos arsit adulteri

Et comites, Helene Lacaena;
Primusve Teucer tela Cydonio

Dicenda Musis praelia. non ferox

Excepit ictus pro pudicis
Conjugibus puerisque primus.
Vixere fortes ante Agamemnona
Multi: sed omnes illacrymabiles
Vrgentur, ignotique longa
Nocte, carent quia vate sacro.
Paulum sepultae distat inertiae
Celata virtus. non ego te meis
Chartis inornatum sileri,
Totve tuos patiar labores
Impune, Lolli, carpere lividas
Obliviones. est animus tibi
Rerumque prudens, and secundis
Temporibus dubiisque rectus,
Vindex avarae fraudis, and abstinens
Ducentis ad se cuncta pecuniae,
Consulque non unius anni,
Sed quoties bonus atque fidus
Judex honestum praetulit utili, and
Rejecit alto dona nocentium
Vultu: and per obstantes catervas
Explicuit sua victor arma.
Non possidentem multa vocaveris
Recte beatum: rectius occupat
Nomen beati, qui deorum
Muneribus sapienter uti,
Duramque callet pauperiem pati,
Pejusque letho flagitium timet;
Non ille pro charis amicis,
Aut patria timidus perire.
Q. HORATII FLACCI LIBER EPODON.
ODE I. Ad MAECENATEM.
Maecenati ad bellum Actiacum proficiscenti comitem se o^fert, non tam quod
praesentia sua quicquam commodi sit ei alla^un^^, quam quod minus de salute
ejus sollicitus fit futurus.

IBis Liburnis inter alta navium,
Amice, propugnacula,
Paratus omne Caesaris periculum
Subire, Maecenas, tuo.
Quid nos? quibus te vita sit superstite
Jucunda: si contra, gravis:
Vtrumne jussi persequemur otium,
Non dulce, ni tecum simul?
An hunc laborem mente laturi, decet
Qua far non molles viros?
Feremus: and te vel per Alpium juga,
Inhospitalem and Caucasum,
Vel Occidentis usque ad ultimnm sinum,
Forti sequemur pectore.
Roges, tuum labor quid juvem meo,
Imbellis, ac firmus parum.
Comes minore sum futurus in metu,
Qui major absentes habet:
Vt assidens implumibus pullis avis,
Serpentium allapsus timet
Magis relictis: non, ut adsit auxili
Latura plus praesentibus.
Libenter hoc and omne militabitur
Bellum in tuae spem gratiae:
Non ut juvencis illigata pluribus
Aratra nitantur meis
Pecusve Calabris ante sydus fervidum
Lucana mutet pascua:
Nec ut superni villa candens Tusculi
Circaea tangat moenia.
Satis superque me benignitas tua
Ditavit. haud paravero,
Quod aut, avarus ut Chremes, terra premam,
Discinctus aut perdam ut nepos.
ODE II.
Varias vitae rusticae lauds haec ode complectitur: praesertim vero ab animi
tranquillitate and frugalitate eam laudat.

BEatus ille, qui procul negotiis,
(Vt prisca gens mortalium)
Paterna rura bobus exercet suis,
Solutus omni foenore.
Neque excitatur classico miles truci,
Neque horret iratum mare:
Forumque vitat, and superba civium
Potentiorum limina
Ergo aut adulta vitium propagine
Altas maritat populos:
Inutilesque falce ramos amputans,
Foeliciores inserit:
Aut in r^ducta valle mugientium
Prospectat errantes greges:
Aut pressa puris mella condit amphoris:
Aut tondet infirmas oves.
Vel quum decorum mitibus pomis caput
Autumnus arvis extulit,
Vt gaudet insitiva decerpens pyra,
Certantem and uvam purpurae!
Qua muneretur te Priape, and te pater
Sylvane, tutor finium.
Libet jacere, modo sub antiqua ilice,
Modo in tenaci gramine.
Labuntur altis interim ripis aquae:
Queruntur in sylvis aves:
Fontesque lymphis obstrepunt manantibus,
Somnos quod invitet leves.
At quum tonantis annus hybernus Jovis
Imbres nivesque comparat:
Aut trudit acres hinc and hinc multa cane
Apros in obstantes plagas,
Aut amite levi rara tendit retia,
Turdis edacibus dolos:
Pavidumque leporem, and advenam laqueo grnem,
Jucunda captat praemia.
Quis non malarum, quas amor curas habet,
Haec inter obliviscitur?
Quod si pudica mulier in partem jnvans
Domum atque dulces liberos:
(Sabina qualis, aut perusta solibus
Pernicis uxor Appuli)
Sacrum vetustis extruat lignis focum,
Lassi sub adventum viri:
Claudensque textis cratibus laetum pecus,
Distenta siccet ubera:
Et horna dulci vina promens dolio,
Dapes inemptas apparet.
Non me Lucrina juverint conchylia,
Magisve rhombus, aut scari,
Si quos Eois intonata fluctibus
Hyems ad hoc vertat mare;
Non Afra avis descendit in ventrem meum,
Non attagen Ionicus
Jucundior, quam lecta de pinguissimis
Oliva ramis arborum,
Aut herba lapathi prata amantis, and gravi
Malvae salubres corpori;
Vel agna festis caesa Terminalibus,
Vel hoedus ereptus lupo.
Has inter epulas, ut juvat pastas oves
Videre properantes domum!
Videre fessos vomerem inversum boves
Collo trahentes languido:
Positosque vernas, ditis examen domus,
Circum renidentes Lares!
Haec ubi loquutus foenerator Alphius,
Jam jam futurus rusticus,
Omnem relegit Idibus pecuniam:
Quaerit Calendis ponere.
ODE VII.
In Bellum Civil gestum hinc Bruto and Cassio, illinc Octaviano, M Antonio,
and M. Lepido ducibus.

QVo, quo scelesti ruitis? aut cur dexteris
Aptantur enses conditi?
Parumne campis atque Neptuno super
Fusum est Latini sauguinis?
Non, ut superbas invidae Carthaginis
Romanus arces ureret:
Intactus aut Britannus ut descenderet
Sacra catenatus via:
Sed ut, secundum vota Parthorum, sua
Vrbs haec periret dextera.
Neque hic lupis mos, nec fuit leonibus
Vnquam, nisi in dispar genus.
Furorne caecus, an rapit vis acrior?
An culpa? responsum date.
Tacent: and ora pallor albus inficit,
Mentesque perculsae stupent.
Sic est. acerba fata Romanos agunt,
Scelusque fraternae necis:
Vt immerentis fluxit in terram Remi
Sacer nepotibus cruor.
ODE XIV. Ad MAECENATEM.
Phrynes amorem causam esse quamobrem promissos lambos non absolvat.

MOllis inertia cur tantam diffuderit imis
Oblivionem sensibus,
Pocula Lethaeos ut si ducentia somnos
Arente fauce traxerim,
Candide Maecenas, occidis saepe rogando.
Deus deus nam me vetat
Inceptos, olim promissum carmen, Iambos
Ad umbilicum adducere.
Non aliter Samio dicunt arsisse Bathyllo
Anacreonta Teium:
Qui persaepe cava testudine flevit amorem,
Non elaboratum ad pedem.
Vreris ipse miser quod si non pulchrior ignis
Accendit obsessam Ilion,
Gaude sort tua: me libertina, neque uno
Contenta Phryne macerat.
ODE XVI.
Queritur bellorum civilium nullum esse finem, quire de Rep. Romana desperate,
aliasque terras and ipse petere cogitat, and aliis, ut idem faciant, suadet.

ALtera jam teritur bellis civilibus aetas:
Suis and ipsa Roma viribus ruit.
Quam neque finitimi valuerunt perdere Marsi,
Minacis aut Etrusca Porsenae manus,
Aemula nec virtus Capuae, nec Spartacus acer,
Novisque rebus infidelis All^brox,
Nec fera caerulea domuit Germania pube,
Parentibusque abominatus Annibal;
Impia perdemus devoti sanguinis aetas:
Ferisque rursus occupabitur solum.
Barbarus, heu, cineres insistat victor, and ^rbem
Eques sonante verberabit ungula.
Quaeque carent ventis and solibus; oss^ Quirini
(Nefas videre) dissipabit insolens.
Forte, quid expediat, communiter, aut m^^ior p^^^

Ire, pedes quocunque ferent, quocunque per undas
Notus vocabit, aut protervus Africus.
Sic placet? an melius quis habet suadere? secunda
Ratem occupare quid moramur alite?
Sed juremus in haec: Simul imis saxa renarint
Vadis levata, ne redire sit nefas:
Neu conversa domum pigeat dare lintea, quando
Padus Matina laverit cacumina:
In mare seu celsus procurrerit Apenninus
Novaque monstra junxerit libidine
Mirus amor: juvet ut tigres subsidere cervis,
Adulteretur and columba milvio:
Credula nec flavos timeant armenta leones,
Ametque salsa laevis hircus aequora.
Haec, and quae poterunt reditus abscindere dulces,
Eamus omnis execrata civitas:
Aut pars indocili melior grege. mollis and exspes
Inominata perprimat cubilia.
Vos, quibus est virtus, muliebrem tollite luctum,
Etrusca praeter and volate littora.
Nos manet Oceanus circum vagus: arva, beata
Petamus arva, divites and insulas:
Reddit ubi cererem tellus inarata quotannis,
Et imputata floret usque vinea:
Germinat and nunquam fallentis terms olivae,
Suamque pulla ficus ornat arborem:
Mella cava manant ex ilice: montibus altis
Levis crepante lympha desilit pede.
Illic injussae veniunt ad mulctra capellae,
Refertque tenta grex amicus ubera:
Nec vespertinus circumgemit ursus ovile,
Nec intumescit alta viperis hnmus.
Pluraque foelices mirabimur: ut neque largis
Aquosus Eurus arva radat imbribus,
Pinguia nec siccis urantur semina glebis:
Vtrumque rege temperante coelitum.
Non huc Argoo contendit remige pinus:
Neque impudica Colchis intulit pedem:
Non huc Sidonii torserunt cornua nautae,
Laboriosa nec cohors Vlyssei.
Nulla nocent pecori contagia, nullius astri
Gregem aestuosa torret impotentia,
Jupiter illa piae secrevit littora genti,
Vt inquinavit aere tempus aureum:
Aere, dehinc ferro duravit saecula: quorum
Piis secunda Vate me datur fugae.

Q. HORATIUS FLACCUS HIS FIRST BOOK OF SONGS.
ODE I.
That several Men affect several Things; That Himself is delighted with the
Study of Lyrick Verses.

MAECENAS Thuscan Kings descent,
My Bulwark and sweet Ornament.
There are, that love their Charets spoak
With raisd Olympic dust should smoke:
And with hot Wheels the Goal close shaven,
And noble Palm, lifts Men to Heaven.
One, if the fickle Peoples blast
Redoubled Honors on him cast:
Another that delights to tear
With Plough the Fields his Fathers were:
If in His private Barnes He store
Whatever fruitful Afric bore;
The wealth of Croesus cannot gain
With trembling Keele to plough the Main.
Frighted with rough Icarian Seas,
The Merchant praises Home, and Ease:
But His bruised Vessel repairs straight,
Impatient of a mean Estate.
There is that neither scorns to taste
Old Massique, nor half days to waste
Under a Shady Poplar spread,
Or at a Bubling Fountains Head.
Some Drums and Trumpets Love, and War;
Which Mothers do as much abhor.
The Huntsman in the cold does rome,
Forgetting his poor Wife at home,
Whether his Hounds a Stagg have Rowz'd,
Or Marsian Boar his Nets has towz'd.
Me Ivy (Meed of learned Heads)
Ranks with the Gods: Me chill Groves, Treads
Of Satyrs with loose Nymphs, have showed
A way out of the common Road;
Whilst kind Euterpe wets my Flute,
Whilst Polyhymnie strings my Lute;
Then write Me in the Lyrick Role,
My lofty Head shall knock the Pole.
ODE II. To AUGUSTUS CAESAR.
That all the Gods are angry with the Romans for the killing of Julius Caesar:
That the only hope of the Empire is placed in Augustus.

ENough of Hail and cruel Snow
Has Jove now showered on Us below;
Enough with Thundering Steeples down
Frighted the Town.
Frighted the World, Lest Pyrrha's Reign
Which of new Monsters did complain,
Should come again, when Proteus Flocks
Did climb the Rocks.
And Fish in tops of Elm-Trees hung,
Where Birds wont build their Nests, and sung,
And the all-covering Sea did bear
The trembling Dear.
We, Yellow Tiber did behold
Back from the Tyrrhene Ocean rolled,
Against the Fane of Vesta power,
And Numa's Tower;
Whilst the Uxorious River swears
He Will be revenged for Ilia's Tears;
And over both his Banks does rove
Unbid of Jove.
Our Children through our faults but few,
Shall hear that We their Fathers slew
Our Countrymen: Who might as well
The Persians quell.
What God shall we invoke to stay
The falling Empire? with what Lay
Shall holy Nuns tire Vesta's Prayer-
Resisting Ear?
To whom will Jove the charge commend
Of Purging us? At length descend
Prophetic Phoebus, whose white Neck
A Cloud does deck.
Or Venus in whose smiling Rays
Youth with a thousand Cupids plays:
Or Mars, if thou at length can pity
Thy long plagued City.
Alas, We long have sported thee,
To whom it is sport bright Casks to see,
And grim Aspects of Moorish Foot
With Blood and Soote;
Or winged Hermes, if it is you
Whom in Augustus Form we view,
With this revenging the other Flood
Of Julius Blood.
Return to Heaven late we pray,
And long with us the Romans stay:
Nor let disdain of that Offense
Snatch thee from hence.
Love here Victorious Triumphs rather;
Love here the Name of Prince and Father:
Nor let the Medes unpunisht ride
Thou being our Guide.
ODE IV. To L. SEXTIUS a Consular Man.
Proposes the arrival of the Spring, and the common Condition of death, as
Inducements to Pleasures.

SHarp Winter's thawed with Spring and Western Gales,
And Ships drawn up the Engine hales:
The Clown the Fire, the Beasts their Stalls forgo:
The Fields have cast their Coats of Snow.
Fair Venus now by Moonshine leads a Dance,
The Graces after comely prance.
With them the Nymphs the Earth alternate beat,
Whilst Vulcan at his Forge does sweat.
Now should we be with lasting Myrtle Crowned,
Or Flowers late Prisners in the Ground.
Now should We sacrifice a Lambkins Blood
To Faunus in a sacred Wood.
Death knocks as boldly at the Rich man's door
As at the Cottage of the Poor,
Rich Sextius: and the shortness of our days
Fits not with long and rugged ways.
Swift night will intercept thee, and the Sprights,
They chat so of in Winter Nights,
And Pluto's haunted Inn. Thou can not there
Call for the Music and good Cheer:
Nor in soft Chloris gaze away thy sight,
Her Sexes Envy, Our delight.
ODE V. To PYRRHA.
That those Men are miserable who are entangled in her Love: That he is escaped
out of it as from Shipwreck by Swimming.

What Stripling now Thee discomposes,
In Woodbine Rooms, on Beds of Roses,
For whom thy Auburn Hair
Is spread, Unpainted Fair?
How will he one day curse thy Oaths
And Heaven that witnessed your Betroaths!
How will the poor Cuckold,
That deems thee perfect Gold,
Bearing no stamp but his, be mas'd
To see a sudden Tempest raised!
He dreams not of the Winds,
And thinks all Gold that shines.
For me my Votive Table shows
That I have hung up my wet Clothes
Upon the Temple Wall
Of Seas great Admiral.
ODE VIII. To LYDIA.
He notes obscurely a certain Young Man whom he calls Sybaris, as undone with
Love, and melted with Pleasures.

LYdia, in Heavens Name
Why melts young Sybaris in thy Flame?
Why does he bedridden lie
That can endure the intemp'rate Sky?
Why rides he not and twits
The French great Horse with wringled bits?
Why shuns he Tybur's Flood,
And wrastlers Oil like Vipers Blood?
Nor has His Flesh made soft
With bruising Arms; having so often
Been praised for shooting far
And clean delivered of the Bar?
For shame, why lies he hid
As at Troy's Siege Achilles did,
For fear lest Man's Array
Should Him to Manly Deeds betray?
ODE IX. To THALIARCHUS.
That being Winter, it is time for Men to give themselves to Pleasure.

THou see the Hills candied with Snow
Which groaning Woods scarce undergo,
And a stiff Ice those Veins
Congeals which Branch the Plains.
Dissolve the Frost with Logs pil'd up
To the Mantle-Tree; let the great Cup
Out of a larger Sluice
Pour the reviving Juice.
Trust Jove with other things; when He
The fighting Winds takes up at Sea,
Nor speared Cypress shakes,
Nor Aged Elm Tree quakes,
Upon to Morrow reckon not,
Then if it comes it is clearly got:
Nor being young despise
Or Dancings, or Loves Joies.
Till testy Age gray Hairs shall Snow
Upon thy Head, loose Mask, nor Show*
Soft whispers now delight
At a set hour by Night:
And Maids that gigle to discover
Where they are hidden to a Lover;
And Bracelets or some toy
Snatched from the willing Coy.
ODE. X. To LYDIA.
He complains that Telephus is preferred before Him*

THe Arms that Warlike bend,
And every henge when you commend,
On which the Head does turn
Of Telephus, ah, how I burn!
Madness my mind does rap,
My Color goes; and the warm sap
Wheesing through either Eye,
Shows with what lingering Flames I fry.
I fry; when thy white hue
Is in a Tavern braw! die'd blue,
Or when the sharp-set Youth
Thy melting Kiss grinds with his Tooth.
Believe't, his Love's not sound
That can such healing Kisses wound;
Kisses which Venus has
Made supple in a Nectar Bath.
O their Felicity
Whom a firm Cord of Love does tie,
Unbroke with wicked strife
And twisted with their threads of Life!
ODE III.
He prays a prosperous Voyage to Virgil, Embarked for Athens: and takes
occasion from thence to enveigh against the Boldness of Man.

SHip, that to Us sweet Virgil ow'st
(With thee entrusted) safe
Convey him to the Artick Coast;
And save my better half:
So Helene's Brothers (Stellifi'd)
And Venus guide thy Sails:
And the Wind's Father, having tie'd
All up, but Vernall Gales.
Of Oak a Bosom had that man,
And trebble-sheath'd with Brass,
Who first the horrid Ocean
With brittle Bark did pass.
Nor feared the hollow Storms, that rore;
The Hyades, that weep;
Nor the South Wind, which Lords it ore
The Adriatic Deep:
What face of Death could him dismay,
That saw the Monsters fell;
And wracking Rocks, and swelling Sea,
With Eyes that did not swell?
In vain, the Providence of God
The Earth and Sea did part,
If yet the watery Paths are trod
By a forbidden Art.
But Men (that will have all, or none)
Still things forbid desire:
Iapetus bold Son stole down
The Elemental Fire.
Whence Leanness overspread the World,
And Fevers (a new Race)
Which creeping Death on Mortals hurled;
And bad him mend his Pace.
Daedale the Empty Air did cut
With Wings not given to Men;
And Hercules the Gates unshut
Of Pluto's dismal Den.
Nothing is hard to sinful Man:
At Heaven it self we fly;
Nor suffer Jove (do what he can)
To lay his Thunder by.
ODE XVIII. To QUINTILIUS VARUS.
That with moderate drinking of Wine, the Mind is exhilerated: with
immoderate, Quarrels begotten.

OF all the Trees, plant me the sacred Vine
In Tybur's mellow Fields, and let it climb
Cathyllus Walls: For Jove does Cares propound
To sober Heads, which in full Cups are drowned.
Of Want, or War, who cries out after Wine?
Thee Father Bacchus, Thee fair Erycine,
Who does not sing? But through intemp'rate use,
Least Other names of Bacchu^^.
Liber's Gifts you turn into abuse,
Think of the Centaures Brawse, fought in their Cans
With Lapithes: and to Sithonians
Heavy Evous, when their heated Blood
Makes little difference betwixt what is good,
And what is not. No, gentle Bassareu,
I will not force Thee: nor betray to View
Thy Vine-clad Parts: Suppress thy Thraoian Hollow,
And dismal dynn: which blind self Love does follow,
And Glory-puffing heads with empty worth,
And a Glass-Bosome pouring Secrets forth.
ODE XXVII. To his COMPANIONS.
To his Companions feasting together, that they should not quarrel in their
drink, and fight with the Cups themselves, after the manner of the Barbarians.

With Goblets made for Mirth, to fight,
It Is Barbarous: leave that Thracian Rite,
Nor mix the bashful blushing God
Of Wine, with Quarrels and with Blood.
A Cand-stick, and Quart-pot, how far
They differ from the Cymitar?
Your wicked noise Companions cease,
And on your Elbowes lean in peace.
Would you have me to share the austere
Falernian Liquor? Let me hear
Megella's Brother, by what Eyes,
Of what blessed wound and shaft he dies
No! then will I not drink: whatever
Venus tames thee, she toasts thy Liver
With Fires thou have no cause to cover,
Still sinning an ingenuous Lover.
Come, thou may lay it whatsoere
It is, securely in my Ear.
Ah Wretch! in what a Whirlpool taken?
Boy worthy of a Better Flame.
What Witch with her Thessalian Rod
Can loose thee from those Charms? What God?
Scarce Pegasus himself can Thee
From this three-shap'd Chimera free.
ODE XXXI. To APOLLO.
He asks not Riches of Apollo, but that he may have a sound Mind in a sound
Body.

WHat does the Poet Phoebus pray
In his new Fane? What does he say,
Pouring sweet Liquor from the Cup?
Not give Me fat Sardinia's Crop,
Not hot Calabria's goodly Kye:
Not Gold, and Indian Ivory:
Not Fields which quiet Liris laves,
And eats into with silent waves.
Proyne, They that have them, Massick Vines:
In Golden Goblets carowse Wines,
The wealthy Merchant, which he bought
With Merchandise from Syria brought,
The Minion of the Gods: as He
That in one year the Atlantic Sea
Three or Four times, unpunished past.
Mine Olives, Endive my Repast,
And Mallows light. LATONA'S SON,
In Mind and Bodies health my own
TO enjoy; old Age from dotage free,
And solac'd with the Lute, give Me.
ODE XXIV. To VIRGIL,
Who lamented immoderately the death of Quintilian.

WHat shame, or stint in mourning ore
So dear a Head? Weep not but rore
Melpomene, to whom thy Sire
Gave a shrill Voice, and twanging Lire.
But does Quintilian sleep his last?
Whose Fellow, Modesty, and fast
Faith, with her Sister Justice joined
And naked Truth, when will they find?
Bewailed by all good Men, he is gone:
But, then Thee Virgil, more by none.
Thou begst back (ah! pious in vain)
The, not so lent, Quintilian.
If sweeter then the Thracian Bard,
Thou could strike Tunes by dull Trees heard,
The Blood would never more be made
To flow into the empty shade,
Which Hermes with his horrid Wand
(Inflexible to countermand
The unevitable Doom of Death)
Once drove to the black Flock beneath.
It Is Hard: But Patience makes that less,
Which all the World cannot redress.
ODE XXXIV. To HIMSELF.
Repenting that having followed the Epicureans, he had been little studious in
worshipping the Gods.

I, That have seldom worshipped Heaven,
As to a mad Sect too much given,
My former ways am forced to balk,
And after the old light to walk.
For Cloud-dividing-lightning-Jove
Through a clear Firmament late drove
His thundering Horses, and swift Wheels:
With which, supporting Atlas reels:
With which Earth, Seas, the Stygian Lake,
And Hell, with all Her Furies, quake.
It shook me too. God pulls the Proud
From his high Seat, and from their Cloud
Draws the obscure: Levels the Hills,
And with their Earth the Valleys fills:
It Is all he does, He does it all:
Yet this, blind Mortals Fortune call.
Q. HORATIUS FLACCUS HIS SECOND BOOK OF SONGS.
ODE I. To C. ASINIUS POLLIO.
He exborts him to intermit a while, his writing of Tragedies, until he have
finished his History of the Civil War of Rome. Then extols that Work

THe Civil War from the first seeds,
The Causes of it, Vices, Tides
Of Various Chance, and The Marriage of Caesar's Daughter to Pompey; which*
occasioned, first the sharing of the Power of Rome, between them two by mutual
Connivence: and afterward again when that Bond ceased by the death of Julia
childles^: their falling out for the whole.
Our prime Lords
Fatal Alliance, and the Swords
Sheathed, but not yet hung up, and oiled,
The Quarrels fully reconciled,
Thou writ'st a work of hazard great:
And walk'st on Embers in deceit-
Full Ashes raked. Let thy severe
Tragical Muse a while forbear
The Stage: This public Task then done,
Thy Buskins high again put on,
Afflicted Clients grand Support,
And light to the consulting Court:
Whom thy Dalmatick Triumph Crowned
With Deathless Bays. Hark how the sound
Of thy braced Drums, awakes old Fears,
Thy Trumpets tingle in our Ears:
How clattering Arms make the Horse shog,
And from the Horse-man's Face the blood.
Now, now amid'st the Common Heard
See the Great Generals fight, besmeard
With glorious dust: and quel'd, the whole
World, but unconquered Cato's Soul!
Juno, and whatsoever Gods,
To Afric Friends, yielded to the odds
Of Rome; the Victors Grandsons made
A Sacrifice to Jugurth's Shade.
What Field, manured with Daunian blood
Shows not in Graves, our impious Feud,
And the loud Crack of Latiums Fall,
Heard to the Babylonian Wall?
What Lake, what River's ignorant
Of the sad War? What Sea with paint
Of Latin Slaughter, is not red?
What Land's not peopled with our dead?
But wanton Muse, least leaving Toies,
Thou should turn Odes to Elegies,
Let Us in Dioneian Cell
Seek matter for a lighter Quill.
ODE II. To C. SALUSTIUS CRISPUS.
First He praises P. for his Liberality to his Brothers: Then shows, that he
who can repress his appetite, and despise Money, is only a King, only happy.

SALUST, thou Enemy of Gold,
Mettles, which The Earth has hoarded, Mould,
Until with moderate Exercise
Their Color rise.
No Age the Name of Pontius smothers,
For being a Father to his Brothers:
Surviving Fame on towering Wings
His Bounty sings.
He that restrains his covetous Soul,
Rules more, then if he should control
Both Land and Sea; and add a West-
Indies to the East.
The cruel Dropsy grows, self-nurst,
The thirst not quenched, till the Cause first
Be purged the Veins, and the faint humor
Which made the tumor.
Virtue, That reves what Fortune gave,
Calls crowned Phraates his Wealth's slave,
And to the Common People teaches
More proper speeches;
Giving a Scepter, and sure Throne,
And unshar'd Palms to him alone,
That (unconcerned) could behold
Mountains of Gold.
ODE III. To DELLIUS.
That the Mind should not be cast down with Adversity, nor puffed up with
Prosperity: but that We should live merrily, since the Condition of dying is
equal to all.

KEep still an equal Mind, not sunk
With storms of adverse chance, not drunk
With sweet Prosperity,
O Dellius that must die,
Whether thou live still Melancholy,
Or stretched in a retired Valley;
Make all thy hours merry
With Bowls of choicest Sherry.
Where the white Poplar and tall Pine,
Their hospitable shadow join,
And a soft purling Brook,
With wrigling stream does crook;
Bid hither Wines and Ointments bring,
And the too short Sweets of the Spring,
Whilst Wealth and Youth combine,
And the Fates give thee Line.
Thou must forgo thy purchased Seats,
Even that which Golden Tiber wets,
Thou must; and a glad Heir
Shall revel with thy Care.
If thou be Rich, born of the Race
Of Ancient Inachus, or Base
Lie in the street; all is one;
Impartial Death spares none.
All go one way: shak'd is the Pot,
And first or last comes forth thy Lot,
The Pass, by which you are sent
T'Eternall Banishment.
ODE IV. To XANTHIA PHOCEUS.
That he need not be ashamed of being in Love with a Serving-Maid: for that the
same had befalln many a grea Man.

TO love a Serving-Maid's no shame;
The white Briseis did inflame
Her Lord Achilles, and yet none
Was prouder known.
Stout Telamonian Ajax proved
His Captives Slave; Atrides loved
In midst of all his Victories
A Girl his Prize:
When the Barbarian side went down,
And Hector's death renderd the Town
Of Troy, more easy to be carried
By Grecians wearied.
Know thou from whom fair Phillis springs?
Thou may be Son in Law to Kings;
She mourns, as one deposed by Fate
From Regal State.
Believe't she was not poorly born:
Phoceus, such Faith, so brave a scorn
Of tempting Riches, could not come
From a base womb.
Her Face, round Arms, and every Lim
I praise unsmit. Suspect not him,
On whose Loves wilde-fire Age does throw
It Is cooling Snow.
ODE VIII. To BARINE.
That there is no Reason why he should belie^e her when she swears: For the
Gods revenge not the perjures of handsome Women.

IF any Punishment did follow
Thy Perjurie: if but a hollow
Tooth, or a speckled Nail, thy Vow
Should pass. But thou,
When thou have bound thy Head with slight
Untwisting Oaths, art fairer by it:
And like a Comet spread'st thy Rays,
The Public gaze.
It boots thee to deceive the Ghost
Of thy dead Mother, and still host
Of Heaven with their etern Aboads,
And Deathless Gods.
Venus but laughs at what is done,
Her easy Nymphs, and cruel Son,
On Bloody whetstone grinding ever
His burning Quiver.
New Suitors daily are inrold,
New Servants come, nor do the old
Forsake their impious Mistress door
Which they forswore.
Thee Mothers for their Fillies Dread,
Thee gripple Sires, and Wives new wed,
Least thy bewitching Breath should fray
Their Lords away.
ODE. X. To LICINIUS.
That Mediocritie, and Equality of the Mind in both Fortunes, are to be
retained.

THe safest way of Life, is neither
To tempt the Deeps, nor whilst foul weather
You fearfully avoid, too near
The shore to steer.
He that affects the Golden Mean,
Will neither want a house that is clean,
Nor swell unto the place of showers
His envied Towers.
The Tempest does more often shake
Huge Pines: and lofty Turrets take
The greatest Falls: and Thunder lops
The Mountain Tops.
A Mind which true proportion bears,
In adverse hopes, in prosperous fears
The other Lot. Jove Winters brings,
And Jove gives Springs.
It may be well, if now it is ill:
Sometimes Apollo with his Quill,
Wakes his dull Harp, and does not ever
Make use of's Quiver.
In boyst'rous Fortune ply thy Oar,
And tug it stoutly to the shore;
Contract in too auspicious Gales
Thy swelling Sails.
ODE XIII. To a Tree by whose Fall in his Sabine Villa, he was like to have
been slain.
That no man can sufficiently understand what to avoid; from thence he slides
into the Praises of Sappho and Alcaeus.

A Planter with a () was He
That with unhallowed Hand set thee,
A Trap for the succeeding Race,
And Ignominy of the Place.
He might as well have hanged his Sire,
Or practiced all the Poisons dire
Medea tempered, or have shed
His Guest^s blood sleeping in his Bed,
Or if a worse Crime may be found,
As to place thee upon my Ground,
Unlucky Wood; Thee, stagg'ring Trunk,
To brain thy Master when thou art drunk.
No Man knows truly what to shun.
The Punick Seaman fears to run
Upon some Shelf, but does not dread
Another Fate over his head:
The Soldier, Shafts, and Parthian Fight:
The Parthian, Chains, and Roman Might*
But Death had still, and still will have,
A thousand back-ways to the Grave.
How near was I Hell's Jaundied Queen,
And Minos on the Bench to have seen,
And the described Elysian shades?
And Sappho, of her Countrey-Maids
Complaining on Aeolian Wire?
And thee Alcaeus, with Gold Lyre
In fuller Notes thundering a Fight,
Rattling a Storm, fluttering a Flight?
Both (worthy of a sacred Pawse)
The pious Ghosts hear with Applause:
But most the Fights, and Tyrants fears,
The shouldring Throng drink with their Ears.
What wonder, when the infernal Hound,
With three Heads, Listens to that sound?
The Furies snakes their Curles unknit,
Nor find Revenge so sweet as it.
It Is Play-day too, with Pelop's Sire:
An^ Him that stole from Heaven the Fire.
Orion even his Hunting leaves,
And greater pleasure thence receives.
ODE XIV. To POSTHUMUS.
That Death cannot be avoided.

AH Posthumus! the years of man
Slide on with winged Pace, nor can
Virtue reprieve her Friend
From wrinkles, age, and end.
Not, though thou bribe with daily Blood
Stern Dis, who with the Stygian Flood
Does Gerion surround,
And Titius Acres bound.
Sad Flood, which we must Ferry all
That feed upon this Earthly Ball,
From the King to the Poor
Beggar that howl at Door.
In vain avoid we Mars 'his Fury,
And breaking Waves that kill and bury:
In vain the sickly Falls,
Fruitful of Funerals.
Visit we must the Sootie shore
Of dull Cocytus, the empty store,
Of Daunus wicked Stock,
And Sisyphs restless Rock.
Thou must forgo thy Lands and Goods,
And pleasing Wife: Nor of thy Woods
Shall any follow thee,
But the sad Cypress Tree.
Thy worthier Heir shall then carowse
Thy hoarded Wines, and wash the House
With better Sack, then that
Which makes the Abbots fat.
ODE XV.
Against the Luxury of his Age.

OUr Princely Piles will shortly leave
But little Land for Ploughs to cleave:
Ponds out-stretch Lucrine Shores,
Unmarried Sycamores
Supplant the Elmes. The Vi'let, Rose,
With all the junkets of the Nose,
Perfume the Olive-Yards,
Which fed their former Lords:
And Daphne twists her Limbs to shun
The Sons rude Courtship. Not so done
By Cato's Precedent,
And the old Reglement.
Great was the Commonwealth alone;
The Private small. No wide Balcon
Measured with private square
Gaped for the Norths cool Air.
Nor the next Turf might Men reject:
Bid at the Public Charge to erect
Temples and Towns, alone,
Of Beautiful new Stone.
ODE XVI. To GROSPHUS.
That Tranquillity of the Mind is wished by all: But that the same is not
purchased by heaping up Riches, or obtaining Honors, but by brid'ling the
desires.

QViet! the trembling Merchant cries,
Into Egean Seas driven far;
When the Moon winks, and he descries
No guiding Star.
Quiet! in War the Thracian bold;
Quiet! the Medes with Quivers dight;
Not to be bought with Gems, nor Gold,
Nor Purple bright.
For It Is not Wealth, nor armed Troops,
Can Tumults of the Mind remove,
And Cares, which about fretted Roofs
Hover above.
His Little's much, whose thrifty Board
Shines with a salt that was his Sire's:
Whose easy sleeps nor fears disturb,
Nor base desires.
Why in short Life eternal Care?
Why Changing for another Sun?
Who, having shunned his native Air,
Himself could shun?
Take horse, rude Care will ride behind;
Embarque, into thy ship she crowds:
Fleeter them Stags, and the East Wind
Chasing the Clouds.
Let Minds of any joy possessed,
Sweeten with that whatever gall
Is mixed. No soul that ere was blessed,
Was blessed in all.
The famed Achilles timeless di'd,
Old Tython did his Bliss outlive:
And Chance, what she to thee denied,
To me may give.
A hundred Flocks about thee bleat,
And fair Sicilian Heifers low;
To thee large neighing Mares Curvete:
In scarlet thou,
Twice-dipt, art clad. Indulgent fate
Gave me a Graunge; a Versing vein;
A Heart which (injured) cannot hate,
But can disdain.
ODE XVII. To MAECENAS Sick.
That he will not live after him.

WHY do thou talk of dying so?
Neither the Gods, Nor I Am content,
Maecenas, that thou first should go,
My Pillar and great Ornament.
If Thee, the one half of my Soul,
A riper Fate snatch hence: Alas!
What should I stay for, neither whole,
And but the Dregs of what I was?
That day shall end Us both: Come, come,
I Have sworn't; and will not break it neither:
March when thou will to thy long Home,
That journey We will make together.
Chimaera's Flames, nor (were he rise
Again) Briareus hundred hands,
Should keep Me back. It Is Justice, This:
And in the Book of Fate it stands.
Were I or under Libra born,
Or Scorpio my Ascendent be
With grimm Aspect, or Capricorn
(The Tyrant of the Latian Sea:)
Our Stars do wondrously consent.
Benigner Jove reprieved thy Breath
When Saturn was malevolent,
And clipped the hasty wings of Death,
In frequent Theater when Thee
Thrice the rejoicing People clapped,
A falling Trunk had brained Me,
Between if Faunus had not stepped,
The Guardian of Mercurial Men.
Pay thou an ample Sacrifice,
And build the Chapel thou vowd'st then:
For Me an humble Lamkin dies.
Q. HORATIUS FLACCUS HIS THIRD BOOK OF SONGS.
ODE I.
That a happy man is not made by Riches or Honors, but by tranquillity of the
Mind.

I Hate lay-Vulgar: make no noise,
Room for a Priest of Helicon:
I sing to noble Girls and Boys
Such Verses as were never known.
Feared Kings command on their own Ground;
The King commanding Kings is Jove:
Whose Arm the Giants did confound,
Whose aweful Brow does all things move.
One Man may be a greater Lord
Of Land then other: This may show
A nobler Pedigree: A Third
In Parts and Fame may both outgo:
A fourth in Clyents outvye All.
Necessity in a vast Pot
Shuffling the names of great and small,
Draws every one's impartial Lot.
Over whose Head hangs a This alludes to the known Story of Dionysius the
Syracusian Tyrant, and D^mocles one of his Flatterers: The scope thereof being
to declare that no man can be truly called happy, who ^ has any terror
hanging over his head.
drawn sword,
Him cannot please a Royal Feast:
Nor Melody of Lute, or Bird,
Give to his Eyes their wonted Rest.
Sleep, gentle sleep, scorns not the poor
Abiding of the Ploughman: Loves
By sides of Rivers shades obscure:
And rockt with West-Windes, Tempe Groves.
That Man to whom enough's enough,
Nor raging Seas trouble his Head,
Nor fell Acturus setting rough,
Nor Fury of the rising Kid:
Not Hail-smit Vines and Years of Dearth;
Sometimes the too much wet in fault,
Sometimes the Stars that broyl the Earth,
Sometimes the Winter that was naught.
The Fish fear stifling in the Sea,
Damm'd up. The Master Builder and
His Men, the Land-sick Lord too, He
Throws Rubbish in with His own hand.
But Fear, and dangers haunt the Lord
Into all Places: and black Care
Behind him rides: or, if on Board
A Ship, it is his Companion there.
If Marble keep not Fevers out,
Nor Purple Raiment help the Blind,
Nor Persian Ointments cure the Gout,
Nor Massique Wines a troubled Mind:
With envied Posts in Fashion strange
Why should I raise a Stately Pile?
My Sabine vale why should I change
For Wealth accompanied with Toil.
ODE III.
A Speech of Juno at the Council of the Gods, concerning the ending of the War
of Troy, and the beginning which the Roman Empire should take from the Trojans.

AN Honest and Resolved Man,
Neither a People's Tumults can,
Neither a Tyrant's indignation,
Un-center from his fast foundation;
Nor Storms that from the bottom move
The Adrian Sea, nor Thundering Jove:
If the cracked Orbs would split, and fall,
Crush him they would, but not appall.
Pollux, and wandering Hercules,
Gained Heaven by such ways as these:
Among whom Augustus, leaning, sipps
Immortal Nectar with red lips.
This way deserving Bacchus clombe
The high Olympus, with his own
Tamed Tigers, which Ambrosia feed;
And Romulus on Mars his steed:
Pleased Juno speaking a good word
On his behalf, at Council Board.
Troy, Troy, (through mine, and Pallas grudge)
A fatal and adultrous Judge,
And foreign woman overthrew,
With its false King and damned Crew,
Because Laomedon forsook
The Gods, and brake the Oath he took,
The Spartan Strumpet's famous Guest
Is now no more jewel'd and dressed:
No more does Priam's perjured House
Resist bold Greeks by Hector's Prowes:
And Wars, which I inflamed, are done.
My Wrath then, and the Trojan Nun
's Ahhorr'd Offspring, Here I give
To his Father Mars. That He should live
In Bowres of light, suck Nectar-Bowles,
And be transcribed into the Rolls
Of quiet Gods, I will abide.
So long as spacious Seas divide
Ilium and Rome; so long as Beasts
On Priamus and Paris Breasts
Insult, and (undisturbed) the Wild
Whelp in their Tombs; Let the Exiled
Reign, Great, in any other Land:
The Capitol refulgent stand:
And awful Rome with sev'n proud Heads
Give Laws to the triumphed Medes:
Rowzing her self let her extend
Her dreadful Name to the Worlds End:
Where mid-land Seas part Affricks soil
From Europe, to the Floods of Nyle;
More Valiant to despise hid Gold
(Which wisely Nature did withhold)
Then force it to Man's use, by Sack
Of Temples, or by Nature's Rack
What ever Corner would impeach
Her Progress, That, let her sword reach:
Visit the Stores of Snow and Hail,
And where excessive Heats prevail.
Yet Warlike Romans destiny
On this condition I decree,
That they (too pious, and grown high)
Shall not rebuild their Mother ^roy.
With Troy, Troy's Fate shall be revived,
And all her ominous Birds retriv'd,
When second Wars Our self will Move,
The Sister and the Wife of Jove.
If Phoebu's Harp a Brazen Wall
Should Thrice erect, Thrice it should fall
(Razed by my Greeks) The Wife, in chain,
Thrice mourn her Sons and Husbands slain.
But whether saucy Muse? These things
Agree not with the Lute's soft Strings.
The words of Gods cease to repeat,
And with small Voice matters so Great.
ODE IV.
The Poet says that he has been delivered from many dangers by the help of
the Muses: and that it has gone ill with all who have attempted any thing
against the Gods.

DEscend Thalia with a Song
From Heaven; my Queen, I Would have it long
To the shril Pipe or to the Flute,
The Viol or Apollo's Lute.
Do hear? Or do I sweetly rave?
I hear in yonder Trees, which wave,
Thy rustling Robe, and in that Spring
The tuning of thy Silver String.
Me, amorous Turtles (Poets Theme)
As by my native Aufid's Stream,
A Child oppressed with sleep and play,
Under a Mountain side I lay,
Fearless (for what has he to fear,
Who from his Birth was Heavens care?)
With sacred Bays and Myrtle Boughs
On which no Beast did ever browse,
Covered, least Snake or ugly Bear
Should do me hurt as I slept there.
Which set the neighboring Fields at Gaze,
As wondering what should be the cause.
Whether I mount the Sabine hill,
Or with cold Springs Preneste chill,
Or Me the healing Bath allures;
Where ere I am: Muses, I Am Yours.
Friend to your Springs, with your Songs rapt,
At lost Philippi Field I escaped;
The fall of my own cursed Tree:
And Shipwreck in Sicilian Sea.
Go you with Me, I Will (dreadless) try
The Bosphorus that threats the Sky,
And (travailing) defy the thirst-
y Sirian Sands to do their worst.
Visit the Brittons, fierce to strangers,
The horse-fed Thracians bloody Mangers,
The Scythians whom no Sun does warm:
And none of them shall do me harm.
Great Caesar you with Martial Toil
Tired out, and glad to breath a while
In Winter Quarters with his Men,
Refresh in the Pierian Den.
You give him mild advice: And well,
From you, he takes it. We can tell,
The Giants selves for all their Troop
Of monstrous Bulkes, were Thunder-strooke
By him that Towns, and dreary Ghosts,
Immortal Gods, and mortal Hoasts,
The Stupid Earth, and restless Maine,
Does Govern with one equal reign.
The horrid Band, and Brotherhood,
Who (whilst upon their terms they stood)
Pelion to heap on Ossa strove,
Gave not a little care to Jove.
But what could Mimas, and the strong
Typhaeus, what Porphyrion long,
What Rhaecus, and with hurled Trunk
(Torn up by the roots) the fury-drunk
Enceladus, rushing against
Minerva's ringing Shield advanced?
Here the devouring Vulcan stood,
There Matron Juno, and the God
That never ^ays his Quiver by,
Rathes in pure dewes of Castaly
His dangling locks, haunts Delian woods,
Patros, and Rhodes, and Xanthus Floods.
Uncounceld force with his own weight
Is crushed; a force that is temperate
Heaven it self helps: and hates no less
Strength that provokes to wickedness.
This truth Orion understands,
And Gyges with the hundred hands:
He, purposing chaste Dian's Rape,
Could not her Virgin Arrows escape.
The Earth on her own Monsters thrown
(Thunderd to endless Night) does groan
Over her Sons: Aetna does rore,
Burning, and not consumed. No more
Can Tityu's Heart in Vulter's Clawe
Or wast it self, or fill her Mawe.
Offended Proserpine restraines
Perithous in three hundred Chains.
ODE V.
The Praises of Augustus, the dishonor of Crassus, the constancy of Regulus,
and his return to the Carthaginians.

JOVE governs Heaven with his Nod:
Augustus is the Earthly God;
Bold Brittons to the Empire bowed,
And Persians, with late Trophies proud.
Could Crassus Soldier lead his life
Yoakt basely with a barbarous Wife?
And with Foe Father-in-law grow gray
In Arms, under a Medians Pay,
(O Fathers! And degenerate shame!)
His Blood forgotten and his Name,
Eternal Vesta, and the Gown,
Whilst there was yet a Jove, and Rome!
This feared wise Regulus his mind,
And so the base Accord declined,
Weighing the Consequence, unless
The Captive Youth died pittyless.
I saw (quoth He) Our Ensigns stuck^
In Punick Fanes, without a stroke
Soldjers disarmed, Citizens
Their free hands bound behind with Chains.
And the Ports open, and that Field
Which Romans had incampt on, tilled.
All This I saw. Redeemed with Gold
They Will grow, belike, in fight more bold.
Buy not Iniquity. As (stain
White wool) 'twill never white again:
So, if true Virtue fall, despair
To stop her till the lowest stair.
A Hind out of the Tramels free,
And make her fight then so will He
That rendered to a faithles Foe,
And Carthaginians overthrow
In second War; That tamely took
The laso, and (Death but named) shook
Why these (forgetting whence they came)
Confounded War with Peace. O shame!
Great Carthage! Thou haest overcome
The Virtue (more then Troops) of Rome.
His chaste Wife's kiss, and his small Fry
Of Babes, he is said to have put by
(As being a slave) and not to have took
From Earth his stern and manly look:
Till he the unwilling Senate brought
To Vote the Thing that he had sought:
Then through his weeping Friends he went
Into a glorious Banishment,
Though well he knew what Torments were
Ready prepared for him there
By Barbarous Men. Yet brake through all
His Kindred, and the Crowded Hall
To beg of him He would not go,
No otherwise then He would do
From Clyents Swarms, after the end
Of a long Term going to spend
In sweet Campania the Vacation,
And give his mind some Relaxation.
To A^TERIE. ODE VII.
He comforts her, being sad and sollicitous for the absence of her Husband.

ASTERIE, why do thou mourn
For Gyges, shortly to return
On wings of Vernal air,
Rich in Sicilian Ware.
More Rich in Faith? He by a Blast
After long Storms on Epire cast
His widowd Nights steeps there
In many a watchful Tear^.
Yet Chloe's subtle Messenger
Showing what sighs it pulls from Her*
Whilst in thy Flame she fryes,
A thousand ways Him tryes.
She tells how the false Woman wrought
On credulous Pretus, till she brought
A cruel Death upon
Too chaste Bellerophon.
Of Peleus near his fatal hour
Whilst He shuns Love: that is armed with Power
And (cunning) rakes from Dust
All Precedents for Lust.
In vain. For Deaf as Rocks to Prayre
He Is yet unmoved. But take thou Care
Enipeus at next Door
Do not thy love procure.
Though none with better skill be seen
To weild a Horse in Mars his green:
No^ with more active Limbs
In Tiber's Channel swims.
Shut to thy Gate before it darken,
Nor to his whining Music hearken:
And though he still complain
You Are hard, still hard remain.
ODE. IX.
A Dialogue of Love and Jealousy, betwixt Horace and Lydia.

HO. WHilst I possessed thy love, free from alarms, The Original of this ^de is
that which Sealige^ writes ^^ had rather have been the Author of* then to be
King of Persia.

Nor any Youth more acceptable Arms
About thy Alablaster Neck did fling:
I lived more happy then the Persian King.

LY. Whilst Thou adord'st not more another face,
Nor unto Chloe Lydia gave place;
I Lydia, (soaring on the wings of Fame)
Eclipst the Roman Ilia with my Name.

HO. Me, Thracian Chloe now, rules Absolute,
Skilled in sweet Lays, and peerless at her Lute*
For whom to die I would not be afraid,
If Fates would spare me the surviving Maid.

LY. Me, Calys (rich Ornitho's Heir) does scorch
With a reciprocal and equal Torch:
For whom I would endure to die twice over,
If Fates would spare me my surviving Lover.

HO. What if old Venus should her Doves revoke,
And curb Us (stubborn) to her brazen Yoke:
If bright-trest Chloe, I would henceforth hate,
And to excluded Lydia open the Gate?

LY. Though He be fairer then the morning Star;
Thou, lighter then a Cork, and madder far
Then the vexed Ocean, when it threats the Sky:
With Thee I Would (gladly) Live; I Would (willing) Dye.

ODE XI. To MERCURY.
That he would dictate to him a Song, wherewith t^ bend Lyde. The Fable of
Danaus Daughters.

O MERCURY) for taught by you
Deaf stones by the Ears Amphion drew)
And Shell, whose hollow Belly rings
With seven Strings:
Once mute and graceless, now the Tongue
Of Feasts and Temples: lend me a song
To third the maze of Lyde's prayre-
Resisting Ear.
Who like a three years Colt does fetch
A hundred Rings, and's hard to catch:
Free from a Husband, and not fit
For backing yet.
Thou make stiff Forests march, retreat
Prone Rivers: Cerberus the Great
Porter of Hell to Thee gave way
Stroak'd with a Lay,
Though with a hundred snakes he cur^e
His head, and from his nostrils hurl
A filthy stream, which all bedrops
His triple Chops.
Ixion too with a forced smile
Did grin. The Tubs stood dry a while,
Whilst with thy music thou did please
The B^lid^s.
Tell Lyde That: That Virgin-slaughter,
And famous Torment, the vain water
Coozning their Urnes through thousand drains,
And posthume pains*
For cruel Maids laid up in store,
Cruel. For what could they do more,
That could with unrelenting Steel
Their Lovers kill?
One only worthy Hymen's Flame,
And worthy of Immortal Fame,
Her perjured Father (pious Child)
Bravely beguild:
Who said to her young Husband; Wake,
Least an Eternal sleep thou take
Whence least thou look: deceive my Sire,
And Sisters dire,
Who like so many Tigers tear
(Alas!) the Prey: I (tenderer)
Will neither slay, nor keep thee thus
In The Slaughter House.
Me let my Savage Father chain
Because my Husband is unslain,
Or into farthest Africa
Ship me away.
By Land or Sea take thou thy flight,
Cov'red with wings of Love and Night:
Go, go, and write when thou art safe
My Epitaph.
ODE XVI. To MAECENAS.
That all thing fly open to Gold. Yet Horace is contented with his own
Condition, in which ^e lives happy.

DANAE in Brazen Tower immured,
From night-adultrers, Doors barred,
And of fierce Dogs a constant Ward
Would have sufficiently secured,
If Jove and Venus had not fooled
The Jailer of the Cloystred Maid,
(Though of his own shadow afraid)
Turning his Godship into Gold.
Gold, loves to break through armed Guards,
And Castles that are Thunder-proof.
The Grecian Augur's sacred Roof
Was undermined by rewards.
Gifts, were the Macedon's Petar,
With which he blew up City-Gates,
Subverted Rival Kings and States,
And laid aboard their Men of War.
With growing riches cares augment,
And thirst of greater. I did well
^o shrink my head into my shell,
Maecenas, Knight-hoods Ornament.
The more a man to himself denies,
The more indulgent Heaven bestows.
Let them that will side with the ^'s:
I Am with the Party of the No's.
A greater Lord of a small store,
Then if the fruitful Crops of all
Appulia I mine own did call:
In midst of so much Plenty Poor.
My little Wood, and my pure Stream,
And corn that never fails; makes me
A Man more truly blessed, then he
That wears rich Affrick's Diadem.
Though neither Corsick Bees produce
Honey to Me, Nor Clothing fine
Segovian Flocks: Nor Massick Wine
Mellow in Barrels for my use:
Yet Pinching Povertie's away.
Nor, wished I more, would Thou deny't.
Who, with contracted Appetite
May easier my Tribute pay,
Then if deputed Egypts King.
Large issues follow large supplies.
He, to whom Heaven nothing denies,
Owes an Account of every Thing,
ODE XXIV.
He inveighs against covetous men, who continually join Houses to Houses,
Building in the very Sea it self: when in the mean time no buildings can free
them from the necessity of dying. He says the Scythians are happy who draw
their Houses in Wagons, and till the Fields in Common. Moreover, denies that
corruption of Manners, and license of sinning to be amongst these, which is
amongst the Romans. But for the rooting out of these Evils, together with the
depraved desire of increasing Riches, affirms there is need of a more rigid
Discipline.

THough richer then unpoll'd
Arabian wealth, and Indian Gold,
Thou with thy works should drain
The Tyrrhene and whole Pontick Main;
Thou could not, when Death lays
On Thee his Adamantine Mace,
Thy Mind from terror free,
Nor Body from Mortality.
Wiser the Scythians,
Whose Houses run on wheels like waines;
And frozen Getes, whose field
Unbounded does free Ceres yield:
Nor is it the custom there,
To sow a land above a year;
And when that Crop is borne,
The rest relieve it each by turn.
There women mingle not
For Son-in-Laws a poyson*d pot;
Nor Govern: on their Dower
Presuming, or Adultrers power.
Their Dow'r's To be well bred:
And Chastity flying the bed
Of others, their own trust
Persuading, and the price of Lust.
Oh! he that would assuage
Our bloodshed and intestine rage,
If he would written have
His Countries Father on his Grave;
Let him not fear to oppose
Unbridled License to the Nose:
So shall he gain great praise
In after times; since (woe the days!)
We envy living worth,
But miss it when its laid in Earth.
For what do our Laws stand,
If punishment weed not the Land?
What serves vain Preaching for,
Which cannot cure our lives? If nor
Those Lands which flames embrace;
Nor where the Neighb ring Boreas,
Shuts up the Ports with cold,
And snows fast nayld to the freehold,
The Mariner repel?
If crafty Merchants learn to quell
The horridst Seas? the fear
Of that crime ( Want) making them bear,
And do all things, and balke
Severer virtues narrow walk.
Would Heaven we would carry all
Our wealth into the Capital!
Or in the next Sea duck
Our Jewels and pernicious muck,
Fuel of all that is naught!
If we repent us as we ought,
Strike at the root of ills;
And mould we our too plyant wills
To rougher Arts: the Child
Of Noble Lineage cannot wield
A bounding Horse of War,
Nay fears to hunt, more skilled by far
To stride off the Greek bowl,
Or the forbidden Dice to trowle,
The whilst his perjured Father
Deceives his Partners trust, to gather
For one that has no wit.
So ill got wealth grows fast, and yet
Something still short does come,
To make it up An even Sum.
ODE XXVII. To GALATEA going to Sea.
He deters Her principally by the example of Europa.

LET ill presages guide the Ill,
A screeching Owl, or from a Hill
A She-wolf mad upon the Flocks,
Or pregant Fox.
And a Snake shaft-like shot athwar^
Their Horses way to make them star^,
Their Journey stop. What place is here
For provident Fear?
Before the Tempest boading foul
Descend into the standing Pool,
My prayre shall from the Orient steer
The Kings Fisher.
Be blessed, wherever thou would be,
And Galatea think of me;
No ominous Pie thy Steps revoakes,
No Raven croakes.
Yet pale Orion sad descends:
I know too well what i^ portends
When black I see the Adriatic,
Or white the Japick,
Let our Foes wives, and all they love
The rising Kids blind Anger prove,
And the vexed Ocean when it roare^
Lashing the shores.
Europa so, trusting her soft
Side to the ticing Bull, skreekt often,
The Rocks and Monsters to behold,
Though she was bold.
She that late picked sweet flowers in Medes,
And wove meet Garlands for Nymphs heads,
In a clear night could nothing spy
But Sea and Sky.
In populous Crete arrived soon after,
O Sire (quoth she) left by thy Daughter
And duty in my feeble breast
By Love oppressed;
Whence, whether rapt? O^^ de^th'^ too small
To expiate a Virgins fall.
Do I (awake) true Crimes lamene,
Or (Innocent)
Does some false Dream put me in pain?
Was It better through the horrid main
To rove far off: or with my Father
Fresh Flowrs to gather?
Had I that naughty Bull now here,
How with my nails I could him tear,
And break the Horns about that Pate,
So loved of late!
Shameless I left my Sire's Aboads:
Shameless I pawse on death, ye Gods,
(If any hear) show me the way
Where Lions stray,
Ere my fair skin grow tand and loose,
And of the tender prey the juice
Run out; whilst I am plump I would
Be Tigers food.
Dye base Europa (whispers me
My Sire) behold yon be^kning tree!
The zone from thy chaste waste unknit
To thy neck fit.
Or if sharp Rocks delight for speed,
This hanging Cliff will do the deed:
Unless (being come of Royal Kin)
Thou Had rather spin,
And be a barbrous Mistress Thrall,
Her Husband's Trull. Venus heard all
And Cupid falsely laughing now
with unbent Bow;
At length she said, This rage forbear;
That naughty Bull thou shall have here:
Prepare thy self'gainst he returns
To break his Horns.
Jove is thy Bull. These fountains dry;
Learn to use greatness moderately.
Thy Thirds oth' World shall called be
Europe from thee.
ODE XXIX. To MAECENAS.
He invites him to a merry supper, laying aside public Cares.

Offspring of Tyrrhene Kings; I have,
Waiting thy leisure in my Cave,
Of Mellow Wine an unbroacht But,
With Spicknard and Rose buds, to put
Upon thy Hair. Break off delay:
Do not moist Tibur still survay,
And Aesula's declining Hill,
And his that did his Father kill.
Leave fulsome plenty, and thy proud
Palace whose head is in a cloud:
Respite the love of smoke, and noys,
And all that wealthy Rome enjoyes.
Rich men are mostly pleased with change,
And cleanly meals in a poor grange,
Whithout their Tapestries, unplough
The Furroughs of a careful Brow.
Andromed now peeps with his star,
Now Procyon shows the Dog not far,
He barks, and Phoebus kindling Rays
Haste to bring back the sultry days.
The Shepherd now with his faint Flock
Looks, panting, for a gushing Rock,
The horrors of a gloomy wood;
And no Air stirs to crispe the Flood.
Thou mind'st affairs of State and (fraugh,
With fears for Rome) busiest thy thought
What Scythians, what the Bactrians think,
And those that distant Tanais drink.
Wise God has wrapped in a thick cloud
What is to come: and laughs aloud
When Mortals fear more then their share.
Things present manage with due care:
The rest are carried like a stream,
Which now runs calm as any dream
Into the Tyrrhene Sea; anon
(Beyond all limits overflown)
Sweeps with it houses, herds, and flocks,
And Trees entire, and broken rocks,
Making the woods and mountains roar.
That man has happiness in store
For a hard winter, that can say
Unto his Soul, I lived to day.
Tomorrow let it shine, or rain,
Yet cannot this the past make vain,
Nor uncreate and render void
That which was yesterday enjoyed.
Fortune that knows the Mistress part
To use her servants with proud Art,
Her fickle favors now bestows
On Me, now on Another throws.
If she stay, best: If she will pack,
I give her all her presents back,
(Like Wooers when a match is broke)
And wrapping Me in my old Cloak,
My Virtue, marry the next hour
Chaste Poverty without a Dower.
When North Winds bellow, it is not I
Run scared to wretched prayers, and cry
Let not my Spice, my Silks increase
The Riches of the greedy Seas.
When Men may be in Oars convayde
Through Pontick storms, then I will trade.
ODE XXX.
By Writing Lyricks he says he has provided bettter for the immortality of
his Name, then if He had procured Brazen Statues, and Pyramides to be erected
to him. And intimates that His chief praise would be, that he was the first of
the Latins who in this kind of Verse intimated the Greeks.

A Work out-lasting Brass, and higher
Then Regal Pyramid's proud Spire,
I have absolved. Which storming Winds,
The Sea that Turrets undermines,
Tract of innumerable days,
Nor the rout of Times can raze.
Totally I shall not dye,
And much of me the Grave shall fly.
Posterity my name shall boast,
When Rome her self in Rome is lost.
Where like a King loud Aufid reigns,
Where Daunus (poor in Stream) complains
To neighboring Clowns: I shall be sed
The Man, that from an humble head
T'a Torrent swollen did first inspire
A Roman Soul in Grecian Lire.
I labor with deserved praise:
Crown, Crown Me (willing Muse) with Baies.
Q. HORATIUS FLACCUS HIS FOVRTH BOOK OF SONGS.
ODE II. To Antonius Julus, the Son of Mark Anthony the Triumvir.
That it is dangerous to imitate the ancient Poets.

WHo thinks to equal Pindar, tryes
With waxen wings to reach the skies,
Like him that (falling) a name gave
TO his watery grave.
As a proud stream that swollen with rain
Comes pouring down the hills amain,
So Pindar Flows, and fears no drouth,
such his deep mouth:
Worthy the Bays, whither he power
From unexhausted Springs a shower
Of lawless Dytherambs, and Thunders
In bolder Numbers:
Or sings of Gods, and Heroes (seed
Of Gods) whose just swords did outweed
The Centaures, and Chimera stout
Her flames put out:
Or moruns some Youth, from his sad Spouse
Unkindly torn, whose strength and prowes
And golden mind he lifts to the sky,
And lets not dye.
This Theban Swan, when he will sing
Among the Clouds, raises his wing
On a stiff Gale. I like the Be
Of Calabrie,
Which (toyling) sucks beloved Flowers
About the Thymie Groves, and Skowrs
Of Fount-full Tibur, frame a terse
But humble Verse.
Thou Anthony in higher strains
Chaunt Caesar, when he leads in Chains
Fierce Germans, his victorious Brows
Crowned with Bay-boughs.
Then whom a greater Thing, or good,
Heaven has not lent the Earth, nor should
Though it refined the Age to the old
Suturnian Gold.
Thou shall sing too the public plays
For his return, and Holy Days
For our prayers heard, and wrangling pleas
Bound to the peace.
Then I (if I may then be heard)
Happy in my restored Lord,
Will join in the close, and o! (I Will say)
O Sunshine day!
And (thou proceeding) we will all sing,
Jo, Triumph! And Agin
Jo, Triumph! At each Turning
Incense burning.
A Hecatomb's required of Thee,
And weaned Calf excuses Me,
In high grass fat and frisking now:
To pay my Vow.
Resembled in whose shining Horns
Th'increasing Moon his Brow adorns;
Save a white Feather in his head
All Sorrel red.
ODE III. To MELPOMENE.
That he is born to Poetry, and by the benefit thereof has obtained
immortality and glory.

Whom thou Melpomene
Have smiled on in his Infancy,
Him neither Isthmian Game
Shall ever for a wrestler fame;
Nor stout Olympic steeds
Victorious draw: nor Martial deeds
Show to the Capital
A Lawrel-Crowned General
For taming Kings: but floods
Which wash rich Tibur, and green woods
Their bushy locks grown long,
Make big with an Aeolian song.
Queen Rome has voted me
Of her own sacred Quire to be,
Where sweet-tongu'd Poets sing;
And now I fear not envies sting.
O Muse! Whose sugard words
Are married to the golden Chords:
Who, if thou touch their tongues,
Giv'st to mute fishes swan-like songs:
It Is (all) thy Boon, that I
Am pointed at as I pass by
Romes Lyrick: thine it is,
I live, and please, if I do This.
ODE IV.
He celebrates the Victories of Drusus Nero (who was Son-inlaw to Augustus
Caesar) over the Rhoetians and Vindelicians. Also commemorates certain valiant
deeds of Claudius Nero.

AS the Armor-Bearer of great Jove
(Made King of all that soars above
For stealing him from Troy
The Ganymed.
yellow tressed Boy)
Youth whilom and his native courage
Drew from his nest ere he could forage:
And now soft winds (being fair)
Teach him to form in the Air
Unwonted steps: Anon more bold
With hostile force assaults a fold;
Resisting snakes anon
For fight and prey sets on:
Or such as Kids a Lion view
From tawny mother weaned new,
Ready in Pastures sweet
To hansel his first Teeth:
Such Rhetians did behold and fly
Drusus beneath the Alps, who why
They carry at their backs
An Amazonian Ax,
I list not to determine here:
Perhaps nor can. But this is clear
Their long Victorious Bands
Subdued by a Boy's hands,
Felt what a mind right got, and true-
Bred under lucky roofs could do,
What Caesar's Fatherly
Care of the Claudij.
A valiant man gets men of spirit;
Even Beasts their fathers minds inherit;
Nor does the Bird of Jove
Get a degenerous Dove.
But Learning inward strength thrusts forth,
And Princely breeding confirms worth:
Still where good precepts want
Good Plants turn recreant.
What unto Nero's, ROME thou ow'st,
Speak Alps, and Asdrubal's red Ghost,
And that bright day to Thee
The black Clouds made to flee:
The first, since the dire African
Through the Italian Cities ran
Like fire through Piny Woods,
Or storms on Thuscan Floods.
Thenceforth thy Youth with prosperous pains
Still grew; and thy religious Fanes,
Sacked by the Punick sword,
Had their chased Gods restored;
And perjured Hannibal 'gan say
At length; Poor Sheep (of Wolves the prey)
We worry, whom to fly
Is a great Victory.
The Nation that through flames of Troy,
And Tyrrhene Billows did convoy
Their Gods, and Babes, and hoare
Sires, to the Ausonian Shore,
Like a dark Oak on the rich top
Of Algidum, which Hatchets lop,
Grows by its loss, and takes
Strength from the very Axe.
Not mangled Hydra more increast
Under Alcides, nor that Beast
Jason, or he subdued
Of Thebes, more lives renewed.
Plunge them in the Sea; they swim (fresh) out:
Foil them, with doubled force they will rout
The Conqueror: and fight
As in a Mistress sight.
Now shall I send no more proud Posts
To joyful Carthage. Lost, O! Lost's
(Now Asdrubal is slain)
The Glory of our Name.
What is it but Neros can effect,
Whom Heavens with prosperous Stars protect,
And their own prudent care
Clews through the Maze of War.
ODE V. To AUGUSTUS.
That he would at length return to the City. Describes the peace and happiness
which Italy enjoyed under his Government.

Heavens choicest gift, Rome's greatest stay,
Now thou art too too long away:
The holy Senate urge thy word
For soon Return, Return. Afford,
Like day, thy presence; like the spring
Give a new life to every thing:
The first (good Prince) our night will chase,
The second will prolong our days.
As a fond Mother for her son,
Whom, having over Seas been gone
Above a year, the envious wind
Keeps back from her embraces kind;
And now she eyes the Vane, and prays,
And from the crooked shore does gaze:
So, with a loyal Passion struck,
The People for their Caesar look.
For now the Oxen walk in Peace:
Corn, and white Innocence increase:
The cleared Main the Seamen Sail:
Faith promises, and dares not fail:
The married bed unsoil'd remains,
Custom and law preventing stains:
Babes, like the Father, praise the Mother:
Punishment is Sin's Twin-Brother?
Who fears cold Scythians? Who, the Medes?
Fierce Sons of Germany who dreads*
Whilst Caesar does in safety reign,
Who is afraid of Wars with Spain?
Each man his proper field does till,
And hides the Sun behind his Hill:
Returning then to sup with Glee,
His second course is praising Thee,
For Thee he prays, to Thee propines,
Thee with his Household Gods he joins,
As, for like reason, thankful Greece
Did Castor and great Hercules.
Long last these Golden Holy days!
Thus Italy for thy life prays:
Sprinkled at night, not changed at Morn,
When to dry labor they return.
ODE VII. To L. MANLIUS TORQUATUS.
Proposing the arrival of the Spring, and the equal necessity to all men of
dying, without hopes of living again, and proposing likewise the change and
Vicissitude of all things, he invites to lead a merry and pleasant life.

THe Snows are thawed, now grass new clothes the earth, This Ode has a ta^^ of
that Heresy, which being sprinkled in other paris of Horace, He recants in the
34. Ode of the first Book of Songs, and wherein he is generally ^^oluded to
have followed the Sect of the Epicureans; though for Epicurus himse^f, he
disavows the Doctrine in an Epistle by him written to Herodotus, in which ^e
says as follows: Viz. When we affirm pleasure to he the chief Good, we
intend not the pleasures of Luxurions men, nor those which are placed in the
Taste, (as some either ignorantly mistaking, or maliciously wresting our words
do suppose) But not to feel pain in the Body, and to enjoy Tranquillity of the
^^d^ and freedom from pertubations, we affirm to be that good. For not eating
and drinking, not en^oyment of women and boys, not the use of (...) and other
delicates which a more exquisite Table affords, beget a sweet life*

And Trees new hair thrust forth.
The Season's changed, and Brooks late swollen with rain,
Their proper banks contain.
Nymphs with the Graces (linkt) dare dance around
Naked upon the ground.
That thou must dye, the year and hours say
Which draw the winged day.
First Spring, then Summer that away does chase,
And must it self give place
To Apple-bearing Autumn, and that past -- But a sober Reason; and that sifts
into the causes and reasons of Things, why any thing is to be chosen, or
declined; and avoiding those controversial diputes, by which minds are (for the
most part) wrapped farther into Error, and engaged in Animosities. Thus he
explains himself: and in this since ^^r Poet was an Epicurean, even after his
reformation, and in the sounder part of his Book which is almost the whole,
having had no clearer light to follow, then that of Nature and reason; and yet
how far that was able to carry him the Reader of it may discern.

Dull Winter comes at last.
But the decays of Time, Time does repair:
When we once plunged are
Where good Aeneas, where rich Ancus wades,
Ashes we are, and shades.
Who knows if Jove unto thy life's past score
Will add one morning more?
When thou art dead, and Rhadamanthus just
Sentence has spoke thee dust,
Thy Blood, nor eloquence can ransom thee,
No nor thy Piety.
For chaste Hippolytus in Stygian night
Diana cannot light:
Nor Theseus break with all his virtuous pains
His dear Perithous chains.
ODE VIII. To MARTIUS CENSORINUS.
That there is nothing which can make Men more immortal, then the Verses of
Poets.

MY Friends, I would accommodate
With Goblets, Grecian Tripods, Plate
Of Corinth-Brass: and, Censorine,
The worst of these should not be thine:
That is to say, if I were rich
In those same antique Pieces, which
Parrhasius and Scopas fame;
He skilled to paint, in stone to frame
This, now a God, a Mortal now.
But I have not the means; nor Thou
A mind, or purse, that wants such knacks.
Verse thou do love. Thou shall not lack
For Verse. And hear Me what it is worth.
Not inscribed Marbles planted forth
To public view, which give new breath
To great and good men after death:
Not the swift flight of Hannibal,
And his threats turned to his own wall:
Not perjured Carthage wrapped in Flame,
By which Young Scipio brought a Name
From Conquered Afric: speak his praise
So loud, as the Pierian Lays.
Nor, were Books silenc't, could Thou gain
The Guerdon of thy Virtuous pain.
What had become of Ilia's child
She bare to Mars, had darkness veiled
The merits of our Romulus?
From Stygian waters Aeacus,
Virtue and favoring Verse assoiles,
And consecrates to the blessed Isles.
A man that has deserved to have praise,
The Muse embalms. She keeps Heavens Keys.
Thus Hercules (his labors past)
With Jupiter takes wished repast:
The Sons of Leda Stars are made,
And give the sinking Seaman aid;
Good Bacchus, crowned with Vine-leaves,
His drooping Votaries relieves.
ODE IX. To LOLLIO.
That his writings shall never perish: Virtue without the help of Verses is
buried in Oblivion. That he will sing Lollio's praises, whose virtues he now
also celebrates.

LEast Thou should think the words which I
(By sounding Aufid born) compile
To marry with the Lute b'a skill
Never before revealed, shall die:
Though Homer lead the Van, the Muse
Of Pindar, nor Alcaeus heights,
Grave Stesichore, nor Caean sighs,
Are silenc't, or worn out of use.
Nor what of old Anacreon played,
Has time defaced: Love lights his Fire,
And with his Quiver wears the Lyre
Of the yet fresh Aeolian Maid.
Helen was not the only she
A curled Gallant did inflame,
The Splendour of his Royal Train,
And Gold and Pearls Embroyderie.
Nor Teucer first that drew a strong
Cydonian Bow. Trojans had fought
Before: nor that age only wrought
Deeds worthy of the Muses song.
Nor valiant Hector, and the brave
Deiphob, were the only men
Received deep wounds upon them then,
Their Children and chaste Wives to save.
Men slasht ere Diomed was made:
But all are in oblivion drowned,
And put unmourn'd into the Ground,
For lack of Sacred Poets Aid.
Virtue that is buried, and dead Sloth,
Differ not much. Un-understood
Thou shall not die; nor so much good
As thou have acted feed the Moth.
Lollio Thou art a man have skill
To fathom things: that being tried
In either Fortune, could abide
In both up-right, and Lollio still.
Of covetous Fraud a scourge severe:
On whom the All-attracting Gold
Could with its Tenters never take hold:
Nor Consul of one year. When ere
A virtuous Magistrate, and true,
Shall call good, gain, bid Bribes Avaunt:
Upon Opposers bellies plant
His conquering Flags: Lollio, That Is You.
He is not happy that has much:
But who so can his mind dispose
To use aright what Heaven bestows,
He justly is accounted such:
If he know how hard want to bear:
And fear a crime, more then his end.
If for his Country, or his Friend
Tostake his life he does not fear.
Q. HORATIUS FLACCUS HIS BOOK OF EPODES.
ODE I. To MAECENAS.
He offers Himself to accompany Maecenas going to the War of Actium, not for
any help he can bring him by his presence, but because being present he shall
have less apprehensions for him.

THou go now our Fleet's General,
Our Fleet, the Empires Wall:
To take thy Sov'raigns danger, pressed
Upon thy willing breast.
I, to whom life in thine is sweet,
But bitter without it,
Shall I (though bid) mine ease pursue
(No ease if wanting you)
Or else with courage Masculine
Make one in the design?
I will: and Thee ore Alps I Will follow,
Through Lands unseen b' Apollo,
And to the farthest Western part.
With an undanted heart.
Thou't ask, what serves my going for,
Weak and unapt for War?
I shall fear less, if I be there;
Absence augmenteth fear.
So Birds, divorced from their raw young.
Fear more the snake's forkt tongue:
Whereas (alas!) if they had staid,
They could have lent no aid.
This and all warfares I Would embrace,
Only to gain thy Grace:
Not that my galling Ploughs may vex
A hundred Oxens necks;
Nor that my Flocks when the Dog raigns,
For hills may change the Plains:
Nor that my Inland Seat may reach
To the far-distant Beach.
Thy bounty has o'reflow'd my measure.
I would not mass up Treasure
To bury with the Miser's Care,
Or Squander like his Heir.
ODE II.
He comprehends in this Ode diverse Praises of a Country life: Commending it
chiefly from the Tranquilliiy and Frugality thereof.

HAppy is He, that free from Mental Toil
(Like the old Mortals) ploughs his Native
With his own Oxen; out of debt: Nor leads (soil
A Soldiers life, still in Alarms; nor dreads
The enraged Sea: and flies at any Rate (the Great.
From Law-Suites, and the proud Porch of
What does he then? He, lofty Poplars joins
Unto adult and marriageable Vines;
And the Wild branches with his Sickle lopt,
Does better children in their rooms adopt:
Or in a hollow Valley, from above,
Beholds his lowing herds securely rove:
Or, his best Honey (which he means to keep)
Puts in clean pots: or sheares his tender sheep.
Or, when plump Autumn shows his bending head
With mellow Apples beautifully red,
With what a Gust his grafted Pears he pulls;
And Grapes, the poor man's Purple! Whence he culs
The fairest, for thee Priap; and for thee
Sylvanus, Guardian of his Husbandry.
Under an aged Oak he loves to pass
The Heates; or lolling on the matted grass.
Between deep Banks a River rowls the while;
The Birds, they prattle, to the Trees that smile;
A purling Brook runs chiding all the way:
Which gentle slumbers to His eyes convey.
But when rough Winter thundering coms, to throw
The treasures open of the Rain and Snow:
Either with dogs, behind him and before
He drives into his toiles the tusked Boar:
Or spreads his thinner Nets beside some Bush,
An Ambuscado for the greedy Thrush:
And ( dear delights) inveigles in his snare
The Travailer- Woodcock, and the Coward- Hare.
Who at these sports, evades not all those darts,
With which loos love assaults our vacant hearts?
But if a virtuous Wife, that bears sweet fruit
Yearly, to one; and guides the house to boot:
(Such as the Sabine, or the Sunburned Froe
(Of him, that was chose Consul from the Plough)
Build of old Logs, against her good man comes home
Weary, a Fire as high as half the room;
And shutting in knit hurdles the glad Beasts,
With her own hand unlade their swagging Breasts
And drawing this years Wine, from the sweet But.
Dainties unbought upon the Table put:
Your Lucrine Oysters cannot please me more,
Nor a fresh Sturgion frighted to Our shore,
Nor any rarer Fish. No Pheasant Hen,
Or Quayle, go down my Throat more sav'ry, Then
An Olive, gathered from the fattest Bough;
Cool Endive; wholesome Mallows; or allow
A Lamb upon some mighty Festival;
Or Kid, from the Wolfe's jaws; That Is worth them all.
Amid'st these Feasts, how sweet it is, to behold
The well-fed Sheep run wadling to their Fold!
To see the wearied Ox come trayling back
The inverted Plough upon his drooping neck!
And the Plough-Boyes (the swarm that makes us thrive)
Surround the shining Hearth, content and blythe!
All this the Us'rer ALPHEUS having sed,
Resolved ( what else) a Country Life to lead;
At Michaelmas calls all his Moneys in:
But at Our Lady puts them out again.
ODE VII. To the People of ROME.
An Execration of the Second Civil War waged after the Death of Julius, by
Brutus and Cassius on the one side; on the other by Octavius, M. Antony, and
Lepidus.

WHy, why Your sheathed Swords drawn again?
Whether rush Ye, impious Brood?
Have not the Earth yet and the Main,
Drunk enough of Latin Blood?
Not that proud CARTHAGE burnt might be,
Rival of the ROMAN STATE:
Nor the chaste Mistress of the Sea
Unconquered, though twice attempted by the rude Courtship of Julius Caesar.
BRITAIN, on Our Triumphs wait.
But that the Thing the Parthians crave,
ROME, may make Her Self away.
Lions and Wolves this Temperance have,
On their Kind they will not prey.
Is It a blind Rage, or force more strong,
Or Crime, drives You? Speak. They look
As pale as Death, and hold their tongue,
As their Souls were Planet-strook.
It Is so: dire Fates the ROMANS haunt,
And a Fratricidall Guilt:
Since Blood of Remus innocent,
On the cursed Ground was spilt:
ODE XIV. To MAECENAS.
That his love to Phryne, is the Cause why he does not finish his promised
Iambicks.

YOu kill Me (sweet Maecenas) when so often
You ask me, why a soft
Sloth stunns my sense, as if with thirsty Draught
I had together quaft
Lethe's oblivious Lake into my Blood.
It is a God, a God,
Forbids Me finish my Iambicks, Though
Promised thee long ago.
Besotted thus, Anacreon was it is said
Upon the Samian Maid:
Who sobb'd his Love out to a hollow Lyre
With stumbling Feet. That Fire
Consumes Thee too. If fairer burnt not Troy
Besieged, in thy lot joy.
Me a Bondwoman, such a one torments,
As no one Man contents.
ODE XVI. To the People of ROME.
Commiserating the Commonwealth, in respect of the Civil Wars.

NOw Civil Wars a second Age consume,
And Rome's own Sword destroys poor Rome.
What neither neighboring Marsians could devour,
Nor feared Porsenas Thuscan Power;
Nor Capua's Rival Valor, Mutinies
Of Bondslaves, Treachery of Allies;
Nor Germany (Blue-ey'd Bellona's Nurse)
Nor Hanniball (the Mothers curse)
We (a blood-thirsty age) our selves deface,
And Wolves shall repossess this place.
The barbarous Foe will trample on our dead,
The Steel-shod Horse our Courts will tread;
And Romulus dust (closed in religious Urne
From Sun and tempest) proudly spurn.
All, or the sounder part, perchance would know,
How to avoid this coming blow.
'Twere best I think (like to the Phoceans,
Who left their execrated Lands,
And Houses, and the Houses of their Gods,
To Wolves and Bears for their aboads;)
T'abandon all, and go where ere our feet
Bear us by Land, by Sea our Fleet.
Can any man better advice afford?
If not, in name of Heaven Aboard!
But you must swear first to return again,
When loosned Rocks float on the Main,
And be content to see your Mother-Town,
When Betis washes the Alps crown;
Or Appennine into the Ocean flies,
Or new Lust weds Antipathies,
Making the Hind stoop to the Tigers love,
The ravenous Kite Cuckold the Dove;
And credulous Herds t'affect the Lions side,
And Goats the salt Sea to abide.
This, and what else may stop our wished return
When all, or the good part have sworn,
Fly hence! Let him whose smooth and unfledged breast
Misgives him, keep the rifled neast.
You that are men, unmanly grief give over
And sail along the Tuscan shore,
To the wide Ocean. Let us seek those Isles
Which swim in plenty, the blessed Soyles:
Where the Earths Virgin-womb unplow'd is fruitful,
And the unproyned Vine still youthful:
The Olive Tree makes no abortion there,
And Figs hang dangling in the air;
Honey distills from Oaks, and Water hops
With creaking feet from Mountain tops.
The generous Goats without the Milk-maids call,
Of their full bags are prodigal;
No Evening Wolf with hoarse Alarums wakes
The Flocks; nor breeds the up-land Snakes.
And (farther to invite us) the plump Grain,
Is neither drunk with too much rain,
Nor yet for want of moderate watring dry:
Such the blessed temper of the Sky.
Never did Jason to those Islands guide
His Pirat-ship, and whorish Bride.
Sydonian Cadmus never touched these shoares,
Nor false Ulysses weary Oars.
No murrain rots the Sheep, no star does scorch
The Cattle with his burning Torch.
When Jove with brass the Golden-age infected,
These Isles he for the pure extracted.
Now Iron reigns, I like a Statue stand,
To point Good Men to a Good Land.
HORACE his First Book of Songs.
ODE XXXVII. To His COMPANIONS.
Exhorting them to indulge their Genius for the victory of Actium. Extols the
magnanimity of Cleopatra in her dying.

NOw let us dance, and now carowse,
Now out at Window throw the House:
Now is the time (Comrades) for Feasts,
To thank the Gods with Smoke and Beasts.
Before, from Grandsires Butts 'twas Sin
To draw the best, whilst the mad Queen
Prepared the Empire's Funeral,
And Ruin for the Capital,
With her gelt Squadrons (a disease
Infamous) Violent as These
A thing impossible to try,
And drunk with her Prosperity.
But almost all Her Navy burned,
Her Fury tamed: and her Brain turned
With Fumes of Mareotick Juice
To true Fears CAESAR did reduce:
With stretching Oars flying Her back
(As gadding Doves a long-wing'd Hawk;
Or Hunter in Aemonian Snow
Traces a Hare t'her Form) to throw
The Fatal Monster into Chains.
She (who to fall so flat, disdaigns)
Nor (Woman-like) feared Swords, nor fled
Into a Hole to hide her Head.
But with a look serene and bold
Durst visit her dampt Court, and hold
Dire Aspes unto her breasts, thereby
A black and a swollen Corpse to lie:
The more she ponderd, more unstirr'd:
An honor she could ill afford
Liburnian Ships; to waft a Queen
Led in proud Triumph to be seen.
This ODE ought to be inserted at the latter end of the First Book of Songs:

Discourses OF HORACE, Divided into SATYRS and EPISTLES.

Q. HORATII FLACCI LIBER Primus SERMONVM.
SATYRA VI. Ad MAECENATEM.
Reprehendit vanum populi ^om: de nobilitate judicium quod eam stemmatum
antiquitate non virtute me^retur, and nobilitate illa^ o^praeditos ad
magistrates non libenter admi^teret: Sibi non eadem ratione amiciriam
Maecenatis, qua tribunatum, posse quendam inv^dere: quum haec non fortunae
fuerit, sed virtutis commendatione quaesita sit. Tandemque suam conditionem
long meliorem in vita privata ostendit quam in magistrat^ esse possit.

NOn, quia, Maecenas, Lydorum quicquid Etruscos
Incoluit fines, nemo generosior est te
Nec, quod aevus tibi maternus fuit atque paternus,
Olim qui magnis legionibus imperitarint:
Vt plerique solent, naso suspendis adunco
Ignotos: ut me libertino patre natum,
Quum refer negas, quali sit quisque parente
Natus, dum ingenuus: persuades hoc tibi vere,
Ante potestatem Tulli, atque ignobile regnum,
Multos saepe viros nullis majoribus ortos,
Et vixisse probos, amplis and honoribus auctos.
Contra, Laevinum, Valeri genus, unde superbus
Tarquinius regno pulsus fuit, unius assis
Non unquam pretio pluris licuisse, notante
Judice, quem nosti, populo: qui stultus honores
Saepe dat indignis, and famae servit ineptus:
Qui stupet in titulis and imaginibus, quid oportet,
Nos facere, a vulgo long lateque remotos?
Namque esto, populus Laevino mallet honorem
Quam Decio mandare novo, censorque moveret
Appius, ingenuo si non essem patre natus:
Vel merito, quoniam in propria non pelle quiessem.
Sed fulgente trahit constrictos gloria curru
Non minus ignotos generosis. quo tibi Tulli
Sumere depositum clavum? fierique tribunum?
Invidia accrevit, privato quae minor esset.
Nam ut quisque insanus nigris medium impediit crus
Pellibus, and latum demisit pectore clavum,
Audit continuo: Quis homo hic est? quo patre natus?
Vt si qui aegrotet, quo morbo Barrus, haberi
Vt cupiat formosus: eat quacunque, puellis
Injiciat curam quaerendi singula: quali
Sit facie, sura quali, pede, dente, capillo:
Sic qui promittit, cives, urbem sibi curae,
Imperium fore and Italiam, and delubra deorum:
Quo patre sit natus, number ignota matre in honestus,
Omnes mortales curare and quaerere cogit.
Tune Syri, Damae, aut Dionysi filius, audes
Dejicere e saxo cives? aut tradere Cadmo?
At Novins collega gradu post me sedet uno,
Namque est ille, pater quod erat meus hoc tibi P^^l^^
Et Messala videris. at hic, si plaustra ducenta,
Concurrantque foro tria funera, magna sonabit,
Cornua quod, vincatque tubas: saltem tenet hoc nos.
Nunc ad me redio libertino patre natum,
Quem rodunt omnes libertino patre natum,
Nunc, quia Maecenas, tibi sum convictor: at olim,
Quod mihi pareret legio Romana tribuno.
Dissimile hoc illi est: quia non ut forsit honorem
Jure mihi invideat quivis, ita te quoque amicum:
Praesertim cautum dignos assumere, prava
Ambitione procul. foelicem dicere non hoc
Me possum casu. quod te sortitus amicum.
Nulla etenim mihi te fors obtulit. Optimus olim
Virgilius, post hunc Varius, dixere quid essem.
Vt veni coram, singultim pauca loquutus,
(Infans namque pudor prohibebat plura profari)
Non ego me claro natum patre, non ego circum
Me Saturejano vectari rura caballo.
Sed quod eram, narro. respondes (ut tuns est mos*)
Pauca. a^eo: and revocas, nono post mense, jubesque.
Esse in amicorum numero. magnum hoc ego duco,
Quod placui tibi. qui turpi secernis honestum,
Non patre praeclaro, sed vita and pectore puro.
Atqui si vitiis mediocribus, ac mea paucis
Mendosa est natura, alioqui recta (velut si
Egregio inspersos reprendas corpore naevos)
Si neque avaritiam, neque sordes, ac mala lustra
Objiciet vere quisquam mihi^ purus and insons
(Vt me collaudem) si vivo, and charus amicis:
Causa fuit pater his: qui macro pauper agello
Noluit in Flavi ludum me mittere magni.
Quo pueri magnis e centurionibus orti,
Laevo suspensi loculos tabulamque lacerto,
Ibant octonis referentes idibus era.
Sed puerum est ausus Romam portare, docendum
Arts, quas doceat quivis eques atque senator
Semet prognat^s. vestem servosque sequentes
In magno ut populo si quis vidisset, avita
Ex re praeberi sumptus mihi crederet illos.
Ipse mihi custos incorruptissimus omnes
Circum doctores aderat. quid multa? pudicum
(Qui primus virtutis honos) servavit ab omni
Non solum facto, verum opprobrio quoque turpi:
Nec timuit, sibi ne vitio quis verteret, olim
Si praeco parvas, aut (ut fuit ipse) coactor
Mercedes sequerer. neque ego essem questus. ab hoc nunc
Laus illi debetur, and a me gratia major.
Nil me poeniteat sanum patris hujus: eoque
Non, ut magna dolo factum negat esse suo pars,
Quod non ingenuos habeat clarosque parents,
Sic me defendam; long mea discrepat istis
Et vox and ratio. nam si natura juberet
A certis annis aevum remeare peractum,
Atque alios legere ad fastum quoscunque parents,
Optaret sibi quisque: meis contentus, honestos
Fascibus and sellis nolim mihi sumere: demens
Judicio vulgi, sanus fortasse tuo: quod
Nollem onus (haud unquam solitus) portare molestum;
Nam mihi continuo major quaerenda foret res,
Atque salutandi plures: ducendus and unus
Et comes alter, uti ne solus rusve peregre-
Ve exirem: plures calones, atque caballi
Pascendi: ducenda petorrita. nunc mihi curto
Ire licet mulo, vel, si libet, usque Tarentum;
Mantica cui lumbos onere ulceret atque eques armos,
Objiciet nemo sordes mihi, quas tibi Tulli,
Quum Tiburte via praetorem quinque sequuntur
Te pueri, lasanum portantes, oenophorumque.
Hoc ego commodius, quam tu, praeclare Senator.
Millibus atque aliis, vivo. quacunque libido est,
Incedo solus: percontor quanti olus, ac far:
Fallacem circum; vespertinumque pererro
Saepe forum: assisto divinis: inde domum me
Ad porri and ciceris refero laganique catinum*
Coena ministratur pueris tribus: and lapis albus
Pocula cum cyatho duo sustinet: astat echinus
Vilis, cum patera guttus, Campana suppellex.
Delnde eo dormitum, non sollicitus, mihi quod cras
Surgendum sit mane, obeundus Marsya, qui se
Vultum far negat Noviorum posse minoris,
Ad quartam jaceo; post hanc vagor, aut ego lecto,
Aut soripto, quod me tacitum juvet. ungor olivo,
Non quo fraudatis immundus Natta lucernis.
Ast ubi me fessum Sol acrior ire lavatum
Admonuit, fugio rabiosi tempora signi.
Pransus non avide, quantum interpellet inani
Ventre diem durare, domesticus otior. haec est
Vita solutorum misera ambitione gravique.
His me consolor, victurus suavius ac si
Quaestor avus, pater atque meus, patruusque fuissent.

Praedia, Caesar an est Itala tellure daturus?
Jurantem me scire nihil mirantur, ut unum
Scilicet egregii mortalem altique silenti.
Perditur haec inter misero lux, non sine votis:
O rus, quando ego te aspiciam? quandoque licebit,
Nunc veterum libris, nunc somno and inertibus horis
Ducere sollicitae jucunda oblivia vitae?
O quando faba Pythagorae cognata, simulque
Vncta satis pingui ponentur oluscula lardo?
O noctes coenaeque deum: quibus ipse, meique
Ante Larem proprium vescor, vernasque procac^^
Pasco libatis dapibus. prout cuique libido est,
Siccat inaequales calices conviva, solutus
Legibus insanis: seu quis capit acria fortis
Pocula, seu modicis uvescit laetius. ergo
Sermo oritur non de villis domibusve alienis:
Nec male, necne Lepos saltet: sed quod magis ad nos
Pertinet, and nescire malum est, agitamus: utrum^^
Divitiis homines an sint virtute beati,
Quidve ad amicitias, usus rectumne trahat, nos:
Et quae sit natura boni, summumque quid ejus.
Cervius, haec inter, vicinus garrit aniles
Ex re fabellas. nam si quis laudat Arelli
Sollicitas ignarus opes, si cincipit: Olim
Rusticus urbanum murem mus paupere fertur
Accepisse cavo, veterem vetus hospes amicum;
Asper and attentus quaesitis, ut tamen arctum
Solverit hospitiis animum quid multa? neque illi
Sepositi ciceris, nec longae invidit avenae:
Aridum and ore ferens acinum, semesaque lardi
Frusta dedit: cupiens varia fastidia coena
Vincere tangentis male singula dente superbo:
Quum pater i^ se domus palea porrectus in horna
Esset, ador, ^oliumque, dapis meliora relinquens.
Tandem urbanus ad hunc, Quid te juvat, (inquit) amice,

Q. HORATII FLACCI LIBER III. SERMONVM.
EPIST. I. Ad MAECENATEM.
Se ludicra sua studia missa facere dicit, and ea, quae ad virtutem ducunt
amplecti: Sic tamen ut in nullius Magistri verba juret. Hujusmodi autem esse
haec studia ut ne^o sit qui non illis excoli possit, si modo patientem aurem
commodet. Tandem pravum hominum judicium virtutem opibus and honoribus
postponentium, and quae corporis sunt, n^n quae sunt animi, curantium,
reprehendit.

PRima dicte mihi, summa dicende Camoena,
Spectatum satis, and donatum jam rude, quaeris,
Maecenas, iterum antiquo me includere ludo.
Non eadem est aetas, non men's. Vejanius, armis
Hercules ad postem fixis, latet abditus agro,
Ne populum extrema toties exoret arena.
Est mihi purgatam crebro qui personet aurem,
Solve senescentem mature sanus equum, ne
Peccet ad extremum ridendus, and itia ducat.
Nunc itaque and versus and caetera ludicra pono:
Quid veru^, atque decens, curo, and rogo, and omnis inhoc sum,
Condo, and comp^no, quae mox depromere possim.
Ac ne forte roges, quo me duce, quo lare tuter:
Nullius addictus jurare in verba magistri,
Quo me cunque rapit tempestas, deferor hospes.
Nunc agilis fio, and mersor civilibus undis,
Virtutis verae custos rigidusque satelles:
Nunc in Aristippi furtim praecepta relabor,
Et mihi res, non me rebus submittere conor.
Vt nox longa quibus mentitur amica, diesque
Longa videtur opus debentibus: ut piger annus
Pupillis, quos dura premit custodia matrum:
Sic mihi tarda fluunt ingrataque tempora, quae spem
Consiliumque morantur agendi gnaviter id quod
Aeque pauperibus prodest, locupletibus aeque,
Aeque neglectum pueris senibusque nocebit.
Restat ut his ego me ipse regam solerque elementis.
Non possis oculo quantum contendere Lynceus,
Non tamen idcirco contemnas lippus iuungi:
Nec, quia desperes invicti membra Glyconis,
Nodosa corpus nolis prohibere chiragra.
Efl quoddam prodire tenus, fi non datur ultra.
Fervet avaritia miseroque cupidine pectus?
Sunt verba and voces, quibus hunc lenire dolorem
Possis, and magnam, morbi deponere partem.
Laudis amore tumes? sunt certa piacula, quae te
Ter pure lecto poterunt recreare libello.
Invidus, iracundus, iners, vinosus, amator:
Nemo adeo ferus est ut non mitescere possit,
Si modo culturae patientem commodet aurem.
Virtus est, vitium fugere: and sapientia prima,
Stultitia caruisse; vides, quae maxima credis.
Esse mala, exiguum censum, turpemque repulsam,
Quanto devites animi, capitisque labor.
Impiger extremos curris mercator ad Indos,
Per mare pauperiem fugiens, per saxa, per ignes:
Ne cures ea, quae stulte miraris and optas;
Discere, and audire, and meliori credere non vis?
Quis circum pages and circum compita pugnax,
Magna coronari contemnat Olympia; cui spes,
Cui sit conditio dulcis sine pulvere palmae?
Vilius argentum est auro, virtutibus aurum.
O cives, cives, quaerenda pecunia primum est,
Virtus post nummos. haec Janus summus ab imo
Perdocet: haec recinunt juvenes dictata senesque,
Laevo suspensi loculos, tabulamque lacerto.
Si quadringentis, sex, septem millia desunt,
Est animus tibi, sunt mores, and lingua, fidesque;
Plebs eris: at pueri ludentes, rex eris, ajunt,
Si recte facies. HIC MURUS aheneus esto,
Nil conscire sibi, nulla pallescere culpa.
Roscia, (dic sodes) melior l^x, an puerorum
Naenia, quae recte regnum facientibus offert,
Et maribus Curiis, and decantata Camillis?
Isne tibi melius suadet, qui ut rem facias, rem,
Si possis, recte: si non, quocunque modo rem:
Vt propius spectes lachrymosa poemata Puppi:
An qui Fortunae te responsare superbae
Liberum and erectum praesens hortatur, and optat?
Quod si me populus Romanus forte roget, cur
Non, ut porticibus, sic judiciis fruar iisdem,
Nec sequar, aut fugiam, quae diligit ipse, vel edit:
Olim quod vulpes aegroto cauta leoni
Respondit, referam: Quia me vestigia terrent,
Omnia te adversum spectantia, nulla retrorsum.
Bellua multoru^ es capitu^. nam quid sequar? aut que^.
Pars hominum gestit conducere publica: sunt qui
Frustis and pomis viduas venentur avaras,
Excipiantque senes, quos in vivaria mittant.
Multis occulto crescit res foenore. verum
Esto, aliis alios rebus studiisque teneri:
Iidem eadem possunt horam durare probantes?
Nullus in orb sinus Bajis praelucet amoenis,
Si dixit dives, lacus and mare sentit amorem
Festinantis heri, cui si vitiosa libido
Fecerit auspicium, cras ferramenta Theanum
Tolletis fabri. lectus genialis in au^a est?
Nil uit esse prius, meliu^ nil coelibe vita:
Si non est, jurat been solis esse maritis
Quo ^eneam vultus mustantem Protea nodo?
Quid pauper? ride: mutat coenacula, lectos,
Balnea, ^onsores: conducto navigio, aeque
Nauseat ac locuples, quem ducit prima triremis.
Si curtatus inaquali tonsore capillos
Occurrit, rides: si forte subucula pexae
Trita subest tunicae, vel si toga dissidet impar
Rides: quid, mea cum pugnat sententia secum?
Quod petiit, spernit: repetit, quod nuper omisit?
Aestuat, and vitae disconvenit ordine toto?
Diruit, aedificat, mutat quadrata rotundis?
Insanire putas solennia me, neque rides,
Nec medici credis, nec curatoris egere
A praetore dati, rerum tutela mearum
Quum sis, and prave sectum stomacheris ob unguem
De te pendentis, te respicientis amici.
Ad summam, sapiens uno minor est Jove, dives,
Liber, honoratus, pulcher, rex denique regum:
Praecipue sanus, nisi quum pituita molesta est.
EPIST. V. AD TORQUATUM.
Torquatum ad coenam invitat, quam frugalem fore dicit. Hortatur ut curis and
cupiditati divitiarum valedicen^^ hilaritati se tradat, and lauds ebrietatis
addit. Tria esse dicit, quorum studiosus sit in apparatu convivii; primam autem
ponit munditiem.

SI potes Archaicis conviva recumbere lectis,
Nec modica coenare times olus omne pa^ella:
Supremo te Sole domi Torquate manebo.
Vina bibes iterum Tauro diffusa, palustres
Inter Minturnas Sinuessanumque Petrinum.
Sin melius quid habes, arcesse, vel imperium fer.
Jamdudum splendet focus, and tibi munda supellex.
Mitte leves spes, and certamina divitiarum,
Et Moschi causam. cras nato Caesare festus
Dat veniam somumque dies, impune licebit
Aestivam sermon benigno tendere noctem.
Quo mihi fortunas, si non conceditur uti?
Parcus ob haeredis curam, nimiumque severus,
Assidet insano, potare and spargere flores
Incipiam, patiarque vel inconsultus haberi.
Quid non ebrietas designat? operta recludit,
Spes jubet esse ratas: in praelia trudit inermem.
Sollicitis animis onus eximit: addocet arts.
Foecund^ calices quem non fecere disertum?
Contracta quem non in paupertate solutum?
Haec ego procurare and idoneus imperor, and non
Invitus: ne turpe toral, ne sordida mappa
Corruget nares: ne non and cantharus and lanx
Ostendat tibi te: ne fidos inter amicos
Sit qui dicta for as eliminet: ut coe at par
Jungaturque pari. Brutum tibi, Septimiumque,
Et nisi coena prior potiorque puella Sabinum
Detinet, assumam. locus est and pluribus umbris.
Sed nimis arcta premunt olidae convivia caprae.
Tu, quotus esse velis, rescribe: and rebus omissis,
Atria servantem postico fall clientem.
EPIST. X. Ad FUSCUM ARISTIUM.
Fusco Aristio urbis ama^ori vitam rusticam, qua ipse delectabatur, laudat, and
varia eius commoda recenset. Simul autem ab ambitione (quae vitam urbanam non
rustica^ comitatur) eum deterret.

VRbis amatorem Fuscum salvere jubemus
Ruris amatores: hac in re scilicet una,
Multum dissimiles, ad caetera pene gemelli.
Fraternis animis, quicquid negat alter, and alter,
Annuimus pariter vetuli, not^que colum^i.
Tu nidum servas: ego laudo ruris amoeni
Rivo^, and musco circumlita saxa, nemusque.
Quid quaeris? vivo, and regno, simul ista reliqui,
Quae vos ad coelum effertis rumore secundo.
Vtque sacerdotis fugitivus, liba recuso:
Pane egeo, jam mellitis potiore placentis.
Vivere naturae si convenienter oportet,
Ponendaeque domo quaerenda est area primum;
Novistine locum potiorem rure beato?
Est ubi plus tepeant hyemes? ubi gratior aura
Leniat and rabiem Canis, and momenta Leonis,
Quum semel accepit solemn furibundus acutum?
Est ubi divellat somnos minus invida cura?
Deterius Libycis olet aut nitet herba lapillis?
Purior in vicis aqua tendit rumpere plumbum,
Quam, quae per pronum trepidat cum murmr r^vum^
Nempe inter varias nutritur sylva columnas,
Lauda^urque domus, longos quae prospicit agros.
Naturam expellas furca, tamen usque recurret,
Et mala perrumpet furtim fastidia victrix.
Non, qui Sidonio contendere callidus ostro
Nescit Aquinatem potantia vellera fucum,
Certius accipiet damnum, propiusve medullis,
Quam, qui non poterit vero distinguere falsum.
Quem res plus nimio delectavere secundae,
Mutatae quatient. si quid mirabere, pones
Invitus. fuge magna; licet sub paupere tecto
Reges, and regum vita praecurrere amicos.
Cervus equum pugna melior, communibus herbis
Pellebat, donec minor in certamine longo
Imploravit opes hominis, fraenumque recepit:
Sed postquam victor violence discessit ab host,
Non equitem dorso, non fraenum depulit ore.
Sic, qui pauperiem veritus, potiore metallis
Liberate caret: dominum vehet improbus, at que
Serviet aeternum, quia parvo neseiat uti.
Cui non conveniet sua res, ut calceus olim,
Si pede major erit, subvertet: si minor, uret.
Laetus sort tua vives sapionter Aristi:
Nec me dimittes incastigatum, ubi plura
Cogere, quam satis est, ac non cessare videbor.
Imperat, aut servit collecta pecunia cuique,
Tortum digna sequi potius, quam ducere funem.
Haec tibi dictabam post fanum putre Vacunae:
Excepto, quod non simul esses, caetera laetus.
EPIST. II. Ad LOLLIUM.
Homerum in suis poematis before ac melius quam quosdam philosophos, quid
honestum sit, docere dicit: amborum afferens argumenta; Iliade quidem quales
sunt in stultis regibus and populis animi motus describi: in Odyssea autem,
Ulyssis exemplo quid virtus and sapientia possint, estendi. Deinde ad studium
sapientiae hortatur, utpote quos recenset animi morbos, sanaturae. Sed a
teneris assu^scendum hujusmodi praeceptis esse docet.

TRojani belli scriptorem, maxim Lolli,
Dum tu declamas Romae, Praeneste relegi:
Qui, quid sit pulchrum, quid turpe, quid utile, quid non,
Before ac melius Chrysippo and Crantore dicit.
Cur ita crediderim, (nisi quid te detinet) audi.
Fabula, qua Paridis propter narratur amorem
Graecia Barbariae lento collisa duello,
Stultorum regum, and populorum continet aestus.
Antenor censet belli praecidere causam.
Quid Paris? ut salvus regnet, vivaetque beatus,
Cogi posse negat. Nestor componere lites
Inter Peleiden festinat and inter Atreiden:
Hunc amor, ira quidem communiter urit utrumque.
Quicquid delirant reges, plectuntur Achivi.
Seditione, dolis, scelere, atque libidine, and ira
Iliacos intra muros peccatur, and extra.
Rursus, quid virtus, and quid sapientia possit,
Vtile proposuit nobis exemplar Vlyssem:
Qui domitor Trojae, multorum providus urbes
Et mores hominum inspexit: latumque per aequor,
Dum sibi, dum socus reditum parat, aspera multa
Pertulit, adversis rerum immersabilis undis.
Sirenum voces and Circes pocula nosti:
Quae si cum sociis stultus, cupidusque bibisset,
Sub domina meretrice fuisset turpis and excors:
Vixesset canis immundus, vel amica luto sus.
Nos numerus sumus, and fruges consumere nati,
Sponsi Penelopes, nebulones, Alcinoique,
In cute curanda plus aequo operata juventus:
Cui pulchrum fuit in medios dormire dies, and
Ad strepitum citharae cessatum ducere curam.
Vt jugulent homines, surgunt de nocte latrones:
Vt teipsum serves, non expergisceris? atqui
Si noles sanus, curres hydropicus: and ni
Posces ante diem librum cum lumine, si non
Intendes animum studiis, and rebus honestis;
Invidia, vel amore vigil torquebere. nam cur
Quae laedunt oculos, festinas demere; si quid
Est animum, differs curandi tempus in annum?
Dimidium facti, qui coepit, habet sapere aude:
Incipe. qui recte vivendi prorogat horam,
Rusticus expectat dum defluat amnis: at ille
Labitur, and labetur in omne volubilis aevum.
Quaeritur argentum, puerisque beata creandis
Vxor, and incultae pacantur vomere sylvae.
Quod satis est, cui contigit, hic nihil amplius optet.
Non domus and fundus, non aeris acervus, and auri,
Aegroto domini deduxit corpore febres,
Non animo curas. valeat possessor oportet,
Si comportatis rebus been cogitat uti.
Qui cupit, aut metuit, juvat illum sic domus, aut res,
Vt lippum pictae tabulae, fomenta podagram,
Auriculas citharae collecta sorde'dolentes.
Sincerum est nisi vas, quodcunque infundis, acescit.
Sperne voluptates: nocet empta dolor voluptas.
Semper avarus eget: certum voto pete finem.
Invidus alterius macrescit rebus opimis.
Invidia Siculi non invenere Tyranni
Majus tormentum. qui non moderabitur irae,
Infectum volet esse, dolor quod suaserit, and men's,
Dum poenas odio per vim festinat inulto.
Ira furor brevis est. animum rege, qui nisi paret,
Imperat; hunc fraenis, hunc tu compesce catena.
Fingit equum tenera docilem cervice magister
Ire viam, quam monstret eques: venaticus, ex quo
Tempore cervinam pellem latravit in aula,
Militat in sylvis catulus. nunc adbibe puro
Pectore verba puer, nunc te melioribus offer.
QVO semel est imbuta recens, servabit odorem
Testa diu. quod si cessas, aut strenuus anteis,
Nec tardum opperior, nec praecedentibus insto.
EDYL. XIV. Ausonii ROSAE.
VEr erat: and blando mordentia frigora sensu
Spirabat croceo mane revecta dies.
Strictior Eoos praecesserat aura jugales,
Aestiferum suadens anticipare diem.
Errabam riguis per quadrua compita in hortis,
Maturo cupiens me vegetare die.
Vidi concretas per gramina flexa pruinas
Pendere, aut olerum stare cacuminibus:
Caulibus and patulis teretes colludere guttas,
Et caelestis aquae pondere tunc gravidas,
Vidi Paestano gaudere rosaria cultu,
Exoriente novo roscida Lucifero.
Rara pruinosis canebat gemma frutetis,
Ad primi radios interitura die.
Ambigeres, raperet ne rosis aurora ruborem,
An daret: and flores tingeret orta dies.
Ros unus, color unus, and unum mane duorum:
Sideris, and floris, nam domina una Venus.
Forsan and unus odor: sed celsior ille per auras
Difflatur: spirat proximus iste magis.
Communis Paphie dea sideris, and dea f^oris,
Praecipit unius muricis esse habitum.
Momentum intererat: quo se nascentia florum
Germina comparibus dividerent spatiis.
Haec viret angusto foliorum tecta galero:
Hanc tenui folio purpura rubra notat.
Haec aperit primi fastigia celsa obelisci,
Mucronem absolvens purpurei capitis.
Vertice collectos illa exsinuabat amictus,
Jam meditans foliis se numerare suis:
Nec mora, ridentis calathi patefecit honorem,
Prodens inclusi semina densa croci.
Haec modo quae toto rutilaverat igne comarum,
Pallida collapsis deseritur foliis.
Mirabar celerem fugitiva aetate rapinam,
Et dum nascuntur, consenuisse rosas.
Ecce and defluxit rutili coma punica floris,
Dum loquor: and tellus tecta rubore micat.
Tot species, tantosque ortus, variosque novatus
Vna dies aperit: conficit una dies.
Conquerimur, Natura, brevis quod gratia floru^ est:
Ostentata oculis illico dona rapis.
Quam longa una dies: aetas tam longa rosarum,
Quas pubescenteis juncta senecta premit.
Quam longa una dies, aetas tam longa rosarum,
Quas pubescenteis juncta senecta premit.
Quam modo nascentem rutilus conspexit Eous,
Hanc rediens sero vespere vidit anum.
Sed been, quod paucis licet interitura diebus,
Succedens aevum prorogat ipsa suum.
Collige virgo rosas, dum flos novus, and nova pubes,
Et memor esto aevum sic properare tuum.

FINIS.
Q. HORATIUS FLACCUS HIS FIRST BOOK OF DISCOURSES:
SATYR VI. To MAECENAS.
He reprehends the vain Judgment of the People of Rome concerning Nobility,
measuring the same by Antiquity of Pedigree, not by virtue, nor willingly
admitting to Magistracy any but such as were adorned with the former. That
there was no reason to envy him for the friendship of Maecenas, as for a
Tribuneship: since that was not given by Fortune, but acquired by the
recommendations of Virtue. Lastly, shows his Condition in a private life to be
much better, then (if he were a Magistrate) it could be.

NOt that the Tuscans (who from Lydia came)
Have nothing nobler then Maecenas Name;
Nor, that thy Mother's, and Sire's Grand-sire were
Generals of old, makes thee as most men, sneer
Thy nose up at poor folks, and such as me;
Horace being the Son of a Manu-mised Slave in the borders of Appulia; was
nevertheless (for the eminent qualities that were found in him) received into
the familiar Friendship of Macen^, and (by his Mediatio^) of Augustus also: By
whom he was moreover invited to the nearest Trusts about his person. ^^t as on
the one side, he did not a little please himself in that value which he ^aw set
upon him by persons as Good as they were Great; so on the other (in respect of
his poor Birth, and Philosophical inclinations) he declined the envy and
trouble of those high Employments: putting really in practice that happy
^^de^ation, which himself both professes and recommends in this, and other
parts of his Book.
Born of a Father, from a slave made free.
When thou affirm'st, It skills not of what kind
Any is come, if of a noble mind;
Thou deem'st (and right) that before Tullus reign
(Who was a King, yet not a Gentleman)
Many a Man of no degree, no Name,
By Great Achievements to Great Honors came.
Levinus contrary ( Valerio's Son,
By whom proud Tarquin was expeld the Throne)
Him worthless, Even the People ( whom you know)
They scorned; Those Fools that Honors often bestow
On Undeservers; Doting on gay men,
Dazzled with shields, and Coronets. What then
Shall we do, lifted far above their Sphere?
The People to Levinus did prefer
A new man Decius; yet now, should I
Stand for a place, hoarse Appius would cry,
Withdraw cause I Am no Gentleman: and shall,
When Horace meddles farther then his Naule.
But Honor takes into her golden Coach
Noble and base. This Tullus had bid Proetor; whom nevertheless being of
obscure Birth, and having ^in of Pompey's party, Coesar degraded from all
dignity. But, Coesar being dead he resumed his former State: therefore this
Envy*
Tullus, what have to touch
The Purple Robe ( which Caesar forced thee quit)
And be a Tribune? Envy thou did git
Thereby, by whom in the dark thou would near been spide:
For when the People see a strange face ride
Up to the ears in Ermins, and a List
(Or more) of gold; strait they demand, Who is it?
What was his Father? Just as when some youth,
Sick of the Fashions (to be thought, forsooth,
Handsome) inflames the fairer Sex, to call
His face in question, Hair, Teeth, Foot, and Small.
So when a man upon the Stage shall come,
And say; Give me the reins that govern Rome,
I Will manage Italy, the State shall be
My Care, I, and the Church likewise: Ods me!
(...) forces every Mortal to enquire
And know; Who was his Mother? Who his Sire?
Shall then the Offspring of a Minstrel dare
Displace this General, condemn that Peer?
Novius was one Hole lower. Being the same
My Father was, you would think from Brute He came. A Slave set free.

But if two hundred Draies obstruct a street;
Or with their Trumpeters, three Funerals meet;
Louder then all, he chafes with brazen Lungs:
And this is something to awe Peoples tongues.
But to my self, the Son of the freed Man.
O (envy cries) The Son of the Freed Man!
Maecenas, now, Because thy Guest: before,
Because a Roman Tribune's charge I bore.
These Two, are not alike: I may pretend,
Though not to Office, yet, to be thy Friend.
Thou being chiefly in this case so choice;
Not guided by Ambition, popular Voice,
Or by a chance: Virgil his Word did pass
For Me, Then Varus told thee what I was.
When first presented, little said I to thee,
(For Modestie's an Infant) did not show thee
A long-taild Pedigree; I did not say,
I bred Race Horses in Appulia.
Told what I was. As little thou replid'st,
(Thy mode) I go: at nine months End, thou bid'st
Me, of thy Friends, be one. Of this I boast,
That I plea'sd Thee (Who to distinguish know)
Not Noble, but of fair and Crystal thoughts.
Yet, if except some few ( not heinous) faults,
My Nature's straight (as you may reprehend,
In a fair Face, some Moles) If ( to commend
My self) I am not given to Avarice;
Not nasty, not debaucht, not sold to vice;
Loved by my friends, obedient to the Laws:
Of all these things my Father was the cause.
Who (though, but Tenant, to one, small, lean, Farm)
In Flavio's School would never let me learn,
When great Centurions sent their great boys thither,
Their left arms crampt with stones, hung in a leather-
Bag, with a counting-board; But boldly parts
With me (a child) to Rome: T'imbibe those Arts
A Knight, or Senator, might teach His Boy.
That who had seen my clothes and my Convoy
Of Servants, cleaving through a press; would swear,
Some wealthy Grandsire did my charges bear.
Himself ( the carefull'st Tutor) had his Eye
Over them All. In short My Modesty
(Virtue's first bloome) so watring from this Well:
He both preserved my Whiteness, and my Smell.
Nor feared, least any should in time to come,
Blame Him He had not bred me still at Home
To his own Trade: or I my self complain:
( The more His Praise, my Debt) if I have brain.
Of such a Father now shall I repent,
Like some that quarrel with their own descent,
Because their blood from Nobles did not flow?
Reason, as well as Nature, answers; No.
For, if I could unweave the Loom of Fate,
And choose my self new Parents, for my State,
In any Tribe: Contented with mine own,
I would not change to be a Consul's Son.
Mad, in the Vulgar's judgment: But, in Thine,
Sober, perchance: because I did decline
An irksome load I am not used to bear.
For I must seek more Wealth straight, if that were;
And, to beg Voices, many a visit make,
Must at my heels a brace of servants take;
For fear my Honor should be seen, alone,
To go into the Country, or the Town.
There must be Horses store, and Grooms thereto;
A Litter's to be hired too; Whereas now
It Is lawful for me, on a Bob-tail Mule,
To travail to Tarentum, if I wull;
My cloak-bag galing her behind, and I
Digging her shoulders. Not, with Obliquy,
Like The same TVLLVS abovementioned, who it seems was no less for did then
ign^b^e.
Tullus, when in Tiber-Road he is seen
Attended with five Boys, carrying a skin
Of Wine, and a Close-stool. Brave Senator,
More decently then Thou, and thousands More,
I could do that. Where e're I list I go,
Alone, the Price of Broth, and Barley know;
Crow'd in at every Sight, walk late in Rome:
Visit the Temple with a Prayer: Then home
To my Leek-Pottage, and Chich-pease. Three boys
Serve in my supper: Whom to counterpoyse
One Bowl, two Beakers on a broad white slate,
A Pitcher with two Ears ( Earthen^
Campanian Plate.)
Then do I go to sleep: securely do it,
Being next morning to attend no suite
In the Great-Hall (where Marsya does look
As if loud Nomio's Face he could not brook)
I lie till Four. Then walk, or read a while;
Or write, to please my self. Anoint me with oil:
(Not such as Natta paws himself withal,
Robbing the Lamps.) When near his Vertical
The hotter Sun invites us to a Bath
For our tired Limbs, I fly the Dog-Stars wrath,
Having dined only so much as may stay
My Appetite: Loiter at home all day.
These are my Solaces: this is the life
Of Men that shun ambition, run from strife.
Lighter, then if I soared on Glorie's wing,
The Nephew, Son, and Grandson to a King.
Q. HORATIUS FLACCUS HIS SECOND BOOK OF DISCOURSES.
SATYR I.
He dilates upon the advice given him by Tr^hatius to write the Actions of
Augustus, rather then Satyrs, (as things that are dangerous to meddle with) and
shows why he cannot obey him.

SOme think I am too sharp a Satyrist,
And that I stretch my Work beyond the List.
Others, what ere I write is nervlesse say,
And that like mine a thousand Lines a day
May be spun. What would Thou advise Me now
( Trebatius) in this case? Sit still. As how?
Not to write Verse at all, do thou aver
As thy Sense? I do. Let me never stir,
If 'twere not better. But I cannot sleep.
For that, swim Tyber (noynted) Thrice: or steep
Thy Brains at night in Wine. If thou must needs
Write, dare to write unconquerd CAESAR's deeds,
Great Rewards following. Father, That being it
I Would fain be at, my Will exceeds my Wit.
Not every Pen can paint in horrid Field
Thick Groves of Pikes, Spears broke in Frenchmen killed,
And a hurt Parthian dropping from his Horse.
His Justice though thou may, and his Minds force:
As wise LUCILIUS those of SCIPIO.
The not be wanting to my Self, if so
Occasion serve. The passage must be clear
When Horace words pierce Caesar's serious Ear:
Whom, stroaking, if we think t'approach: 'ware heels!
Is not that better, then in verse that reels
To jeer this Gull, that Prodigal, when each
Man, thinks he is meant (though quite frrom thy thoughts reach)
And hates thee for it? What should I do? Being hot
In The head, and seeing double through the Pot,
Milonius frisks. CASTOR on Hors-back fights:
The Twin of the same Egg in Clubs delights.
As many thousand Minds, as Men, there be.
I, like Lucilius (Better then both We)
My words in Meeter love t'enclose and bind.
His way was, in his Books to speak his Mind
As freely, as his Secrets he would tell
To a tried Friend: and took it ill, or well,
He held his Custom. Hence it came to pass,
The old Man's Life is there as in a Glass.
His steps I follow, whom you neither can
Of Luca call, nor an Appulian.
(For the Venusian both their Borders ploughs,
A Colony of Rome, as old Fame shows,
The Sabells thence expelled, to stop that Gate,
And be an Out-work to the Roman-State.)
Yet I Would not harm a Chicken with my will:
For show, and countenance bearing my Quill,
Like a Sword sheathed: which, why should I draw, not
Set on by Rogues? with Rust there may it rot
O Jove, Father and King: and none bereave
The Peace I seek. But if there do, believe
Me, they will rew't; when with my keen Style stung,
Through the whole Town they shall in Pomp be sung.
Servius, the penal Statutes (angerd) threats
Canidia to VVitch them, against whom she sets:
A mischief Turius, to all those wage Law
Where He Is a Judge. That every one does aw
Them whom He fears, with that where His strenght is,
And that, by Natures Law, appears in this:
Wolves smite with Teeth, Bulls with the Horn (This must
^e taught them from within.) With Scaeva trust
His long-lived Mother: my Head to a groat,
His pious hand shall never cut her throat.
Not his? No more then an Ox bite, a Bear
^^^k thee: But she shall die of poison. There
Now lies his Skill. Me, whether (in effect)
The quiet Harbor of old Age exspect,
Or Death with sable wings hover about:
Rich, Poor, at Rome, or by hard Fate thrust out
^to Exile; in whatsoever way
Of life, I must write Verses: that is my play.
O Child! Thy Taper's near the end I doubt,
And that some Great Man's Brave will puff thee out.
Why? When Lucilius durst begin this way
Of writing Verses, and the skins did flay,
In which the outward-fair disguised their shame;
Were Laelius and He that won a Name
From Carthage-raz'd, offended with his wit?
Or did they winch, Metellus being hit?
And Lupus stripped and whipped in Verse? Yet He^
^pouted his Ink on men of each degree:
None spared, but Virtue and her friends. Nay when
^^^ir'd were from the Stage, and Crowd of Men,
Scipio's exalted Virtue, and the mild*
Wisdom of Lelius: Till the Broth was boild,
They Both would play and toy with Him, ungirt.
Though I in wit, and in condition, short
^^ of Lucilius: Envy shall confess
Against her will, I Have lived nevertheless
Amongst great Men: and (thinking to have stuff
Here, for her rotten Teeth) find I am tough,
If learned Trebatius take Me at my rate.
Nay truly, I can find nothing to bate.
Only I warn thee, least through ignorance
Of settled Laws thou come to some mischance:
If any write base Verses against other,
It bears a Suite. If base, I grant: but Father,
If any write good Verses, that Man's praised,
Caesar the Judge. If I the street have raised
By barking at a Thief, my self being none:
The Bench with laughter cracks, I (freed) go Home.
SATYR VI.
He says he lives content with what he has, and wishes no more. Then compares
the Commodities of the ease he injoyes in the Country, with the discommodities
of businesses and troubles which accompany the City Life.

THis was my wish, a moderate Scope of Land,
A Garden with a plenteous Spring at hand:
And to crown these a Plump of Trees. Heaven gave
Better then this. It Is well, no more I crave
Good Mercury: make but these things endure:
If neither by ill ways I did procure,
Nor by ill ways shall wast them: If I escape
Longings: O that yon Nooke, which does mishape
My Field, were added! O that I might find
A pot of Gold! As (Hercules to Friend)
He did, who, hired to delve Another Ground,
Bought the same Land he dug, with what he found:
If what I have please me: If thou incline,
When I pray; Make my Flock, and all that is mine
Fat, but my wit; and as Thou Have ever done
Stand by my Great Guardian. Therefore (when being flown
Out of ROME's Cage into the Woods, I put
Discourses in rough Verse, and horse my Foot)
Nor Fevers kill me, nor Ambition's Itch,
Nor sickly Autumnes making Sextons Rich.
FATHER MATVTE: or Janus (if that style
Affect thee more) From whom their Births, and Toil,
According to the Julian year men date:
With thee I auspicate my Work. When straight
Thou thy self hurriest me away to ROME.
To be a Surety: quick: lest some one come
Before, that is more officious. Rain, or Blow,
And though the Colds shrink day to nothing, Go
I must: And after, wrestle through a Crowd,
And crack my Lungs, t'undoe my self aloud:
Injure, who ere is slower. Name of Mars*
What mean you? Whose Solicitor? (Thus curse
Those men, upon whose Corns I tread) O! You
Hasting to serve Moecenas, care not who
You run ore. I Will nere lie; This grieves me not:
It Is Music. But anon, when I have got
Esquiliaes misty Top, Thousand Affairs
Of other men sly buzzing in mine ears,
And sting me back and sides. Roscius requests
Tomorrow, Two, you would help him in the Requests.
The SECRETARIES pray you would not forget
A Business that concerns the Public, Great,
AND NEW, TO DAY: stay Quintus, get this Bill
Signed by Moecenas: If I can, I will.
Nay, Thou can do it: and presses me. It Is now
A seven years past, Moecenas does allow
^e of his family, only t'advise
Whom He should take into his Coach in Journeys,
To whom commit his Meddals: What Is a Clock?
Which Fencer will beat (think thou) or which Cock?
It Is a hard Frost: will it bear another Coat?
With such like Trifles as are safely put
In Leaking Ears. This Prentiship have I
Served under Envy's lash, more and more daily*
^ur Friend bowl'd with Moecenas the other day:
I and they sat together at the Play:
Some men have Fortune!) Blows there through the street
A bleak news from the Change? straight all I meet;
Good man: (For thou being near the Gods must know)
Do hear ought of the Dacians? In sooth, No.
Thou Wilt nere leave jeering. Hang me, if I do.
The lands then which the Emperor promised to
The Soldiers, in SICILIA shall they be
Allotted to them, or in Italy?
Swearing, I nothing know: Well, go thy ways
For a deep pit of Secrecy! and gaze.
^ean while my Taper wastes: scarce time to pray:
O Fields! when shall I see you? O! when may
I, rowld in Books, or lulled in sleep and ease,
Opium life's cares with sweet forgetfulness?
When shall I taste the Pythagorean Bean
With sav'ry broth, and Bacon without lean?
O nights! and suppers of the Gods! which I,
And mine, consume in my own Family;
Where my Clowns, born within doors, tear the feast
I tasted to them; Where the lawless guest
Dries the unequal Cups, as his Complexion
Asks soaking showers, or moderate refection.
Then talk we not of buying lands, nor school
Other men's lives: nor whether Caesar's Fool
Dance well, or not: but things of more concern,
Are our discourse, and which men ought to learn:
Whether to happiness do more conduce
Virtue or Wealth? If we our Friends should choose
For Ends, or Honesty. What Is understood
Truly by Goods? and which is the chief Good?
My Neighbor Cervius interweaves his old
^ables, as thus: Arellius wealth extold
Forgetting with what cares it tortures him)
^^e tell you a tale (quoth he) Once on a time
The Country Mouse received in her poor House
Her ancient and good Friend, the City Mouse
A mighty Huswife, and exceeding nigh,
(...) Free in way of Hospitality.
(...) short, the Chich-pease she had laid for hoard,
And unthrasht Oats she setts upon the Board,
^ings scraps of Bacon in her Mouth, and dry
^ley; desiring with Variety
Had it been possible) to have o'^ecame
(...) stately niceness of the City-Dame.
Then the Good Wife herself on her strawe-bed,
Leaving the best) on Chafe and Akorne fed.
At length, her Guest: Friend* how can thou endure
To live in this Rocke-side, moapt and obscure?
Wild Woods preferr'st Thou to a Town, and Men?
Come Go with Me. Since All shall die, and when
We go, Our Mortal Souls resolve to dust,
^ive happy whilst thou may, as one that must
^^^ Nothing a while hence. Drawn by this spell,
The Country Mouse skips lightly from her Cell:
And Both their way unto the City keep,
^^^ging by Night over the Walls to creep:
And now 'twas Midnight, and her Foot each setts
^^ a Rich House: Where glittring Coverletts
Of Tyrian die, on Ivory Beds were cast,
And many O^falls of a great Feast past^
Lay in the Pantry heapt. Her Rural Mate
^rayd to repose under a Clothe of State.
The City-Mouse, like an officious* Host,
^^stirs her self to fetch baked, boyld, and Roast:
And plays the Carver, tasting All she brings,
She thinks the World well changed; and Heavens good Things
Stretching, injoyes. When Straight open flies the Room,
And tosses Both out of the wrought Couch, plomme,
^ing like Things distracted, but much More
When with M^lossian Dogs the high Roofes roar:
Then said the Country Mouse; No more of This,
Give Me my Wood, my Cave, and Roots with Peace.
Q. HORATIUS FLACCUS HIS THIRD BOOK OF DISCOURSES.
EPIST. I. To Moecenas.
He says he dismisses his trifling studies, and embraces' those that tend to
virtue: yet so as not to swear to any Masters* words. And that these studies
are such, that there is none but may be bettered by them, if he but lend a
patient ear thereunto. In the end he refrehends the depraved judgment of men
placing Virtue after Wealth and Honors, and caring more for the things of the
Body then the things of the Mind.

MAecenas mentioned in my Odes, to be
Mentioned in all I write; Thou would have me
(Enough seen, and applauded on the Stage)
To the old sport; I have not the same Age,
Nor the same Mind. Upon Alcides post
His Arms hung up, ere his won Fame be lost;
The Fencer that is wise, retires. I hear
A voice sound daily in my cleansed ear,
Free an old Horse, lest he (derided) lagg,
And, broken-winded, in the last act flagg.
Therefore Love-songs, and all those toys, Adieu:
My work is now to search what is Good, what is True:
I lay in precepts, which I straight may draw
Out for my use. If thou demand, Whose Law,
What Guide I follow: Sworn to no man's words,
To this and that side I make Tacks and Bords.
Now plunged in billows of the Active life,
At virtues Anchor ride contemplatife,
With ARISTIPPUS now yield to the stream,
More studying to get wealth, then to contemn.
As Nights are long to them their Mistress fails:
To Hirelings, days: To ^urbd Wards years are Snails:
So slow and so unpleasant my Time flows,
Till seriously I act, as I propose,
That which alike boots rich and poor, if done,
Alike hurts young and old, if let alone.
It rests, these Rules I to my self apply.
Thy eyes will never pierce like Lynceus eye,
Scorn not to anoint them though if soar they are:
Nor, of a Wrastlers strength if thou despair,
Neglect to salve the knotted Gout. If more
's denied, it is something to have gone thus furre.
Revenge and Avarice boil in thy heart:
There Is words and sounds will cut off a great part
Of thy disease. Swell'st thou with love of praise!
There is a Charm too which this Devil lays;
Reading a good Book thrice devoutly over.
The Envious, Wrathful, Sluggish, Drunkard, Lover:
No Beast so wild, but may be cam'd, if He
Will unto Precepts listen patiently.
It Is Virtue, to fly Vice: and the first Staire
Of VVisdome, to want Folly. With what Care
Of Mind, and Toil of Body, we avoid
Mean wealth, and honors hunt (Ambition's God?)
The unwearied Merchant runs to farthest Ind,
Through Fire, through horrid Rocks, Riches to find:
What thou thus fondly doat'st on, to despise,
Sit, learn and hear from those that are more wise.
Whose sword has won him Honor in true Fights,
Dusty Olympic Laurels, that Man slights,
(Above those Toys, and in his own self rowld.)
Gold excels silver, Virtue excels Gold.
O Romans, Romans, first seek Money; Then
Virtue. This drops from every Scriv'ners Pen*
This is the Doctrine old and young men preach,
Carrying a black Box dangling at their Breech.
If of This alludes to the Lex Roscia, the Law made by Roscius Otho, that he
who was worth 40000 Sesterces (a certain Roman coin) should be a Knight of
Rome, and admitted to those Benches in the Theater appointed for that Order:
Otherwise not.
Sesterces forty thousand lack,
Six or seven thousand only, though you make
It up in Virtues, Courage, Eloquence,
Faith, and the like; you are a Plebeian, Hence
But playing in the streets, the children sing
Another song: He that does well's a King.
Be this a wall of Brass, to have within
No black Accuser, harbor no pale Sin.
Now (sadly) which is better, Otho's Law
Or the Boys Song, which gives a Regal aw
To him does well? A song often sung of old
By manly Curii, and Camilli bold.
Counsels he better, that says, MONEY GET,
If thou can, well: but if not, get it yet,
That thou some piteous Play may nearer see?
Or he that bids thee, Brave, erect, and free,
To face proud Fortune? If ROME's people now
Object, Why placed on our Bench vot'st not Thou
The same with us? Abhor'st not what we hate?
Affect'st not what we love? My Answer's, That
The sly Fox once to the sick Lion made:
The Footsteps that way all, make me afraid,
And from thy Den that I perceive no treads.
The people, It Is a Beast with many heads.
What, or whom should I follow? some by-places:
Some for rich Widows trade with Beads and Glasses,
And feed old men with Gifts, like Fish with bread,
That they on them may afterward be fed.
Many grow fat with Usury. But well,
Let several men have several minds. Now tell,
How long will any in the same mind stay?
Baiae? The World has not a sweeter Bay,
The Rich man cries: when straight the Sea and Lake
The joy of their arriving Lord partake.
Who, if an ominous Hare (forsooth) come thwart
Tomorrow, Smiths unto the THE A NUMBER Cart
The To ^^^ld there, which he intended at Baj^.
Iron work. Has he at home a wife?
No life (he says) like to the single life.
If not, None blessed (he swears) but married men.
What knot can hold this changing Pro^eus? Then
The poor Man (laugh) alters his eating-room,
His Barber, Bed, and Bath: and sick of Rome
As much as Rich-men that keep Barks, to float
Upon the water, goes and hires a Boat.
If thou meet one, by an ill Barber notcht,
Thou laugh'st: If one in Scarlet breeches botcht
With Frize, thou laugh'st. But what if my Mind fight
With it self? Seek that which it slighted, slight
That which it sought? all Rules of Life confound?
Turn like the Tide, build, raze, change square to round?
Thou think me mad in fashion, and laugh'st not,
Nor that I need to have a Doctor got,
And to be placed in Bedlam by the Mayre:
Though thou art my Patron, and consumed with care
At the least fingers aching of thy friend
That honors thee, and does on thee depend.
In sum, A wise man's only less then Jove:
Rich, free, fair, noble: last a King, above
The common rate of Kings: But chiefly sound,
That is to say, Deriding the S^^ick^ who say, A wise man is happy though h^ be
sick.
Unless his spleen abound.
EPIST. V. TO TORQUATUS.
He invites Torquatus to supper, which He says shall be a frugall one.
Exhorts him (bidding farewell to Cares, and the desire of Riches) to give
himself to Mirth; and (seeming a little lightheaded with the joy of Augustus
his Birthday) lashes out into the Praises of drinking, Names three things
whereof he is studious in His Entertainment, and the first of these,
Cleanliness.

IF Thou (a Guest) on a joyn'd-Stool can sup,
And in a small Mess all the Broth sup up:
I shall at home expect thee by Sunset.
Wine thou shall drink of middle age, and wet
Minturnae's growth hard by. If thou have ought
That better is, command it to be brought,
And treat thy Host. Already the Logs burn,
And the scowr'd Pans shine, on thy score. Adjourn
Light Hopes, and Riches strife, and Mosco's Cause
To morrow; CAESAR's Birthday gives a Pawse
To Toil, and leave to sleep. Without offense
We may spin out with chatting Eloquence
The Summer night. What do I care for wealth,
Unless to use? It Is a mad kind of stealth,
For one to rob himself, to enrich his Heir.
I Will quaffe, and sprinkle Roses, and not care
Though I Am thought wild for this. The rare effects
Of Wine! Love, hid in Blushes, it detects:
Hopes it ensures: It makes the Coward fight:
Learned the Ignorant: The sad Heart light.
Whom have not flowing Cups Eloquent made?
Whose debts (though nere so great) have they not paid?
I am the Man: and my charge I will make it,
(Willing, and not unfit to undertake it)
To have the Forms clean-rubb'd: The Napkins such
As may not curl our Noses up to touch:
That in the Platters thou may see thy Face:
That no false Brother carry from the Place
Ought that is spoke: That all of a Suit, be
Septimius? Brutus? sure Cards, These* Let Us see:
Then (if not taken up with better cheer,
Or by his Girl) Sabinus shall be here.
Each Guest may bring his shadow. But the sweat
Will be offensive, if too close we set.
Thy Number, write: and (all things laid aside)
Thy Clients bobb'd, out at the back door glide.
EPIST. X. To FVSCVS ARISTIVS.
He praises to Fuscus Aristius (a lover of the City) the Country-life, with
which himself was delighted, and recounts the several Commodities thereof.
Withal deters him from ambition, which accompanies the City-life, not that of
the Country.

TO Fuscus, the Towne's Lover, health I wish
That love the Country: diffring much in this,
In all else Twins. Both like, dislike, what either:
A pair of old Doves bred of Eggs together.
Thou keep'st the Nest: I love to fly abroad,
To haunt sweet Brooks, the mossie Grott, and Wood.
What would thou have? I live and reign, when I
Have shunned those things thou praisest to the sky.
And like a Comfit-maker's Prentice fled,
Cloyd with Preserves, am better pleased with Bread.
If one would live with all convemency's,
And first in building the Foundation is,
Where does frank Nature thrust out such a Breast
As in the Country, with all good things blessed?
Where is it that the Winter's warmer? Where
To cool the Dog-starres byte, is fresher air,
And the fierce Lyon's rage, when all his heat
Th'exalted Sun poures in, to make it great?
Where does less envious care our sleeps dispell?
Do Floores of Parian Marble look or smell
Like Flowers? The water when it heaves to burst
The leaden Pipes with which in streets it is forced,
Runs it so pure, as when melodiously
It quavers in the Rivers Falls? Even He
Affects to have Trees, who in the City builds,
And that his house should but survey the fields.
Drive Nature with a Pitch-fork out, she will back
Victorious (spite of State) by'a secret Track.
He that wants skill right Scarlet to descry
From counterfeit, will not more certainly
Be cosend in a Shop, then he shall be
That knows not true from false Felicity.
Him, whom a prosperous State did too much please;
Changed, it will shake. What thou admir'dst with ease
Thou censt not quit. Fly great things: In a Cell,
Kings, and the Friends of Kings, thy Life may excel.
The Stagg superior both in Arms and Force,
Out of the Common-Pasture drove the Horse:
Until the vanquished after a long fight
Prayed Man's assistance, and received the Bit:
But, having beat the Victor, could not now
Bit from his Mouth, nor Man from his Back throw.
So He that fearing Poverty, has sold
Away his Liberty, better then Gold,
Shall carry a proud Lord upon his back,
And serve for ever, cause he could not lack.
Who fits not his Mind to it, his Estate
If little, pinches him: throws him, if great.
Wisely (ARISTIVS) thou will like thy lot,
And wilt chide Me, if mine content Me not:
If more I cark for, or if more I crave.
Who ere has Money, either it is his Slave,
Or it is his Master, as when two Men tug
At a Ropes ends: We Are dragged unless we drag.
Given in Vacation, at that The Romans adored Vacation as a Goddess, by the
Name of V^^cuna.
Goddess Cell:
Save that I have not Thee, perfectly well.
EPIST. II. To LOLLIO.
He says Homer in his Poems teaches fuller and better what is honest, then some
Philosophers; bringing arguments to prove the same. That in the Iliad, what are
the incentives of War to foolish Kings and Nations, is described: and in the
Odyssee, by Ulysses example, what virtue and wisdom can do, is shown. Then
exhorts to the study of Wisdom, as that which will heal the diseases of the
mind, which he reckons up. But teaches withal, that men must from their tender
age accustom themselves to such like precepts.

WHilst thou (Great Lollio) in Rome do plead,
I, in Praeneste, have all HOMER read:
Who, what is our Good, what not; what Brave, what Base,
Fuller then Crantor and Chrysippus, says.
Why I think thus, (unless you are busy) hear.
The Lines, that tell how Greeks and Trojans were
Involved in a long War for Paris love,
Rash Kings and Nations foolishness reprove.
Antenor's Counsel was, to send the Cause
Of the War back. PARIS says, No: What Laws
Compel Kings to be safe? NESTOR, to piece
The diffrence, runs, betwixt the King of Greece
And Tethy's Son: One boiling with Love's Flame,
With Anger Both. The PRINCES, They Are too blame,
And the poor PEOPLE smart for it. Mischief, Strife,
Fraud, Rage, and Lust in Town, and Leaguer rife.
Again what Virtue and what Wisdom can,
He shows us in The Example of the Ulysses,
Man
Of Ithaca: who ( Troy in Ashes laid)
The Towns and Manners prudently survay'd
Of many Lands: and through the Ocean vast,
Returning Home with his Companions, past
Many sharp Bru^ts, not to be sunk with Storms
Of adverse Chance. Thou know the Sirens Charms,
And Circe's Cups: which had he greedily
And fondly tasted with his Fellows, He
Had served a Whorish Dame, and lived a Dog
On his own Vomit, or mire-wallowing Hog.
The Suitors of Penelope were mere
Puppets, made only to devour good Cheer:
Raskals, who minded nothing but their skin,
And, that perfumed and sleek, to sleep therein
Till it was Noon: then thought it brave, to wake
With the same Lutes with which they rest did take.
Do Thieves sit up all Night to kill and steal?
And cannot we rise to intend our Weal?
But if in health, thou will not stir about,
Hereafter thou shall run (though with the Gout)
To a Physician: and unless thou knock
For Candle, and a Book, with the first Cock:
Unless to Studies, and to honest Things
Thou bend thy Mind; with Love's or Envy's stings
Thou Wilt lie awake tormented. If a Fly
Get in thy Eye, it is pulled out instantly:
But if thy Minds Ey's hurt, day after day
That Cure's deferred. Set forth, you are half thy way.
Dare to be wise: Begin: He that to rule
And square his Life, prolongs, is like the Fool
Who staid to have the River first pass by:
Which rowles and rowles to all Eternity.
Money is sought, and a Rich Wife for Brood,
And a sharp Culter tames the savage Wood.
Let Him that has enough, desire no more.
Not House and Land, nor Gold and Silver Oar,
The Body's Sickness, or the Mind's dispell.
To relish Wealth, the palate must be well.
Who fears, or Covets: House to him and Ground,
Are Pictures to blind men, Incentives bound
About a gouty Limb, Music t'an ear
Damned up with filth. A vessel not sincere
Sowres whatsoere you pour into it. Abstain
From pleasures: Pleasure hurts, that is bought with pain.
The Cov'tous always want: your prayers design
To some fixed mark. The Envious man does pine
To see another fat: Envy's a Rack:
Worse, no Sicilian. Tyrant ere did make.
Who cannot temper wrath, will wish undone
What, in his haste, he may have done to one,
To whom he (possibly) would be most kind.
Anger is a short madness: Rule thy mind:
Which reigns, if it obeys not: fetter it
With chains, restrain it with an Iron bit.
The Quiry moulds the Horses tender mouth
To His Riders will. The Beagle from his Youth
Is trained up to the woods, being taught to ball
(A Whelp) at the Bucks heads naild in the Hall.
Now Boy, in the white paper of thy breast
Write VIRTUE: Now suck precepts from the Best.
A pot, well seasoned holds the primitive taste
A long time after. If thou make no have,
Or spur to overrun me, I am One
For none will stay, and will contend with none.
AUSONIUS His ROSES. EDYL. 14.
'TWas Spring; and (bitter-sweet) the Saffron Morn
Blew hot, and cold from Amalthea's Horn.
A brisker gale ushered Aurora's Ray,
And bad her Steeds outstrip the winged day.
Between the Gardens watered beds I went,
Apollo's growing fury to prevent.
On the bent grass I saw congealed drops,
And Crystal pendants on the pot-hearbs tops.
Broad Cabbages from leaf to leaf distilled
The Orient Pearl, and all their bottles filled.
The hoarie Fruit Trees here and there a Gem
Had candi'd ore, to melt with the first ^eam.
The Rose-trees in their Pestan Scarlet laughed,
And with red lips the Mornings Nectar quaft.
It Is doubted whether HESPER borrowed,
Or lent, that paint, and died the Roses red.
One deaw, one color, one Celestial power
Of both: For they are VENUS Star and Flower.
Perchance one odor too: but That being high,
Expires ith'aire: This, throws her Incense nigh.
The PAPHYAN Mistress of the Flower and Star,
Bade both her servants the same Liv'ry wear.
The moment came when on opposed Banks
The flowrie Squadrons placed themselves in Ranks.
One lay concealed in her Leaves close green-hood:
Another peeping through the Lattice stood.
This opes her first aspiring Pyramed,
And ends it in a crimson poynted head.
That looz'd her garment (gathered in her lap)
And in her native silks her self did wrap;
Uncovers, Now, her laughing Cup, and shows
The golden Tuft which in her bottom grows.
She, that but now shone dressed in all her hair,
Stands pale; forsook even by those leaves she bare*
So sudden change I wondered to behold,
And Roses in their Infancy grown old.
Whilst I speak This, those envied Beauties shed
Their glorious locks: earth covered with their dead.
So many kinds, so many births of Flowers,
One day discloses, and one day devours.
NATURE, why made thou fading Flowers, so gay?
Why shewd'st us gifts, to snatch them straight away?
A day's a Roses Age. How near do meet
(Poor Bloomed) thy Cradle, and thy Winding Sheet?
Her whom the rising Sun saw newly born,
He sees a witherd corpse at his return.
Yet, well with them: Who, though they quickly dye,
Survive themselves in their posterity.
Gather your Roses Virgins, whilst they are new:
For, being past, no Spring returns to You.
VIRGILS BVLL. Out of his Third Book of Georgicks.
A Beauteous Heyfer feeds in a great Wood:
For whom two Bulls exchange thick wounds: black blood
Flows largely from them both; and their sharp horns,
Whilst either bearing on his Rival turns,
They drive in with huge groans. The bell^wing ground,
And the Celestial Bull, report their sound.
Nor is it the fashion when the War is done,
For these stout Combatants to live in one
And the same Field. The vanquished quits the place,
Exiled in parts far off: his own disgrace
Lamenting deep, and the proud Victors blows,
Also the Love he (unrevenged) did lose:
And, casting back a ruefull look, is fain
To leave the Pastures where his Sire did reign:
With all care therefore he does exercise
His strength, and nightly on the hard stones lies
Without his Litter, feeding on rough boughs,
And on sharp Flags penuriously does browze:
And tries himself, and practices on Oaks
To clash with horns, provokes the wind with strokes:
And, spurning up the sand with angry feet,
Before the fight does flourish, having knit
His slackned Nervs, he does his Trumpet blow,
And rushes headlong on his secure Foe:
As when a Billow in the midst of the Maine
Began to Foam, and gathers a long Train
Advancing through the Deep: and rowld to Land
Roares in the Rocks, nor overlays the Strand
Less heavy then a Mountain: but boils up
With curling Whirlpools to the Ocean's top,
And throws high Works up of black Sand.
The END.
