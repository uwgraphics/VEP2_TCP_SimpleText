Doctor COSENS his Visitation at Warington in Lancashire: with a true story of
the Reader of Liverpoole his double-wronged Breeches brought before him there.
THE plunder-Church year 'twas, whence York
Sent forth those Harpies of her Kirk
Esdall, Wickam, and Cozens:
The last was he that then fate on
The skorners Bench at Warington,
to sell sin by the dozens.
Had you but heard this Dragon roar
So far 'bove that of Eglimore,
or seen this rampant Priest
Ttample the Puritan, you would
Have sworn him one of th'very brood
come out of the mouth of the Beast:
In the first place, his long Oration
Was spent of the Kings late Declaration,
that none should dare to Preach
Against Arminian points, but that
They should press Gospel truths, whence flat
he did enjoyne to teach.
All men's salvation that would will
Graces receipt: he showed the ill
of Lectures, Repetitions,
Afternoon Sermons, and the blame
Of other form then What Is your Name,
or on that, Expositions.
All unbookd prayers he could not see,
To be ought else but blasphemy,
what? on the spirit to father
An abortive prayer, whereunto
The Canon was not Midwife, no
nor Holy Church the mother?
The Doctor the presentiments all,
With fury tore in pieces small,
that brought in omnia been;
Charged them to make a new report,
The reason was unto the Court,
they were not wotth a penny.
In the presentiments that were brought,
One was so saucy, or ill taught,
at the Altar for to lean;
From the Churchyard hedge was one had pluk't
A twig to still her child that sucked,
ah, sacrilegious Queen.
A Butcher his unhallowed Calfe
To the Churchyard style had tied safe,
all must their penance do;
Another for adultery
Escaped much better, for that he
rapt out an oath or two.
A rich-nos'd Host appeared being drunk,
He wished all Puritans were sunk
in their New England passage;
The Doctor did conclude the man,
No Church imbroyling Puritan,
he knew it by his visage.
And so he escaped, paying his fees,
So did not he, but lost a Fleece
with his Neighbor that durst pray;
A Minister called Sabath Clerk
The Doctor re-baptiz'd, took's mark,
and called him Saturday.
A Reader among the rest he spyed,
Blew were his Breeches which the tide
of the Doctors rage did sell;
He stamped and star'd, and grew stark mad
The adventure dyre and story sad,
I mean you (here) to tell
It was a four-pound right Sir John,
That Service read at L'erpoole Town,
His name was John Wain-wright;
Had that been too his occupation,
It had been better for the Nation
(with many a such like Wight.)
His Masterpiece and highest praise,
'Twas bidding right the Holy Days
and chanting out procession;
Kersning, burying, marrying fair,
Giving good morrow to Master Mayor,
though in the midst o'th Lesson.
He passed for a quiet soul,
And no man's foe, did not control
his parish'ners in their sports;
The Pipers faithful advocate,
And Beare-heards too, had no man's hate,
was free to all resorts.
Withal he deerly loved a cup,
And of it often deep would sup,
and then as often besh -- him;
And now his thoughts were all upon
The approaching Visitation,
and how there to acquit him.
Fraught with his Orders, License, Fees,
His Coat Canonical (though freeze)
a Churchwarden went too,
Who with a Wallet was so laden,
Before that many a mile they would trodden,
the Priest he began to sue.
To bear the box of the presentiments,
So on they went without resentments
to Ranehill till they came,
An Ale^house (there) stood by the way
Which soon invited them to stay,
the Ale was of good fame.
They called so often for to'ther cup,
That all the Ale was quite drunk up,
save what untuned remained;
To that they fell, the night grew on,
Their thoughts were quenched toward Warrington,
the Priests breech was ill staind.
Both soundly drunk, to bed they will go,
The Rooms of the house were ordered so,
that the good wife was feign
In the same room to cool her grout
Where they both lay (sans fear or doubt)
the chance was Master Waine,
Right laid his wronged breeches doewn
Upon the very self-same Cowme,
wherein the working Ale was;
Doubtless he took it seeing th'froth
For a round table and white cloth,
how'ere, it came to pass
The Breeches fitter much for Lee,
Grew steeped in Ale for company,
and with the owner drunk,
So weighty were the boxes, fees,
Sinful presentiments, that to the Lees,
no mervaile if they sunk.
The Ale in triumph over such spoils,
Swelled high and mantl'd, but those broils
'tad quickly again a laid;
No mervaile, now 'twas impossession
Without abatement, strife or question
of the reckning not yet paid.
Besides, hereby the stream in the breech
Returned unto its spring, by which
it was repaird again,
And the presentiments being drowned,
That to it a foe might have been found
it needed not complain.
The Curate and the Warden both
Steept as they were in Barley broth,
felt neither ach nor stitches,
They Would tune a medicine for the fleas,
Feared not the next days hard release,
but lay still as the Breeches.
The morning comes, they both arise,
Say over the Creed and rub their eyes,
mean quickly to be packing,
The Reader ready to put on
His Breeches, but he found anon
(woe worth him) they were lacking
He sought them all the room about
In every place save in the Grout;
who would them there suppose?
The Ale looked just as did over night,
Undrunk, no secrets to the light
would it all disclose.
The Constable was sent for soon,
The Priest cried out he was undone,
the fees, presentiments lost;
Orders, License, all were gone,
Which many a year h' had lived upon,
and many a groat had cost.
He charged the Host to have stolen them all,
It booted not to whine or braule,
at length it was concluded,
Rather then not to make appearance,
The Reader should put on Hodge Laurence
his Breeches though the were blew-died.
Laurence the presentiments gone,
Liked not to appear at Warrington,
but was content to stay
In soccage for the shot unpaid,
While the Curate with his breech arrayed
would bear the heat of the day.
Which proved not small I can assure ye,
For why? the Doctor grew in fury,
at the strange Breeches hew;
He asked what mot'ly gull it was
That there did dare to show his face,
in cloths thus black and blew.
Whether holy Orders h' had taken?
Where he officiated? what lane
or hedge-priest he might be?
The silly man being quite confounded
With shame and horror, all surrounded
fell down upon his knee:
Told him the whole, how h' came out
Clothed all in black from head to foot,
but had been robbed, (alas)
His Breeches, Orders, Fees were gone,
Presentiments too, not he alone
but the Court a looser was.
When of this sacrilegious charge,
The Doctor was informed at large,
he vowed that he would make
The Host a most example dread
of justice, as had ever head
or hand in plot so black.
Immediately he sent a Somner:
The Catchpole was no sooner come near
to the suspected place,
But in the turning of her Grout,
The Wife had found the Breeches out,
howbeit, in woeful case.
But when the whole was fully known,
And 'bout the Town in rumor blown,
the Doctor did assay,
The Stinking stir to have referred,
By him and's fellows to be heard,
and cleanly made away.
The Host and Hostess they cried, no,
But to the common Law they would go,
at Derby Court they would try it:
Two Actions they had anent him,
Whereby they would make him to repent him,
and h' should dearly buy it.
One was of slander of their housing,
The other 'twas the brewing loosing;
whereto the Priest did plead.
The house it had (with many a curse)
Of many a guest often picked the purse
by its large reckonings made.
And for the Ale he proved it clear,
They Would sold it off as soon, and dear
as any other brewing;
And that it was more strong and stale
And much the more canonical,
by the aforesaid Breeches stewings.
This doubled suit was often traversed,
Renewed again, and again reversed,
until to one o'th Quorum,
It was referred as Umpire sage
With other two, Two belonging to the Court.
it to assuage,
will Oufald and John Orum.
Who ended it with much ado,
After both sides began to rue.
the Lawyers many Quiblets,
By turning (as the Proverb says)
The Hares head (as in such like frayes)
unto the Wild-goose Giblets.
FINIS.
