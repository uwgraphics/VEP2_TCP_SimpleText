Seasonable Observations Humbly offered to his Highness the Lord PROTECTOR.
By Samuel Lamb of London, Merchant.
IT has been often asserted, that if all people under one Government did seek
the general good, every single person would then receive a particular benefit
thereby.

And it is observed in Societies, tha are in a joint Trade, and have Bylaws
and Orders among themselves, that if an Interloper privately trade among them
in the same way, not submitting himself to the Bylaws and Orders of that
Company, that he will receive to himself a greater profit for the present, than
any particular person of the same incorporated Society, though if the
undiscovered practice thereof should be continued, and not prevented, it would
tend to the utter ruin and destruction of the said Society and Trade for the
future. Even so it is in a populous Commonwealth, where part of the people, by
unlawful and destructive ways, seek their sinister ends, to the general hurt
and prejudice of the well governed people therein.

To avoid which evils in all good Governments, necessary and wholesome Laws are
contrived and established to preserve and protect the Property and Peace of
each particular person, and every one living under such protection is bound in
duty to further the prosperity of his Country with all his utmost endeavors;
for no one is born to himself alone, but also to do good to others, and some
way or other may be a profitable member to his Country, according to the
measure God has given him, to which end I have for the general good observed
these two chief ways that make a Nation rich and flourishing (viz.)

By Arms and Conquest.

By Foreign Traffic and Merchandise.

To both which no people are more apt and prone than the English Nation. In the
former, their actions both by Sea and Land have sufficiently manifested it to
all the World both at home and abroad in former and latter ages to this very
day, in the latter our former Prosperity and Strength in Shipping have
sufficiently showed our aptitude therein, though then much hindered, and
discouraged from our growing greatness, by the avarice of some, who minded
their particular profits before the general good; which has caused the
strength of our Warlike Shipping in Trade, to be much impaired and diminished,
though small notice is publicly taken of it, which has put me upon the
Considerations following.

1. The Usefullness and Necessity of increasing the Trading-Shipping of
England. 2. The State and condition our Trading-Shipping were in before the
late Wars in England; and the condition they are in at present. 3. The State
and condition of the Hollanders Shipping and Trade at present. 4. The Reason of
the Hollanders so great thriving in Trade in so short a time (among others) is
showed their use of Banks. 5. The benefit they have received by Banks. 6. The
prejudice and hinderance we receive by their Banks. 7. The good we may do our
selves by the use of Banks in England. 8. The manner of a Bank described. 9.
Lastly the usefullness of a Court of Merchants.
All which I shall treat of in their Order.

First, It has always been the general received opinion (grounded upon
uncontradicted reason) that the people of England need not fear any Foreign
Invasion, so long as they do maintain and increase the Walls of their Land
(Viz.) their Shipping and Mariners; which is the chiefest Power and Strength
of the Nation against a Foreign Enemy; whose increase will not only much
strengthen and enrich the Maritime and Frontier Towns and Countries bordering
on the Sea Coast, but also the whole Nation; and will make us always capable
to balance the affairs of another State in reference,

To War.

To Trade.

By the former, we are now seasonably seeking reparations from the Spaniard,
for the many and cruel injuries and murders committed by them upon the Person
and Goods of the people of England, in the West Indies and other places; For
which, since no reasonable satisfaction could be tendered in a peaceable way,
do hope by Gods blessing will be obtained by a just War: And therefore it is
necessary upon this occasion, as against all others, for the English Nation to
strengthen themselves what they can, and to use all good endeavors thereunto.

For the latter, in reference to Trade, we may well suspect the studious
industry of our Neighbors the Hollanders, will soon overbalance us, if not
timely prevented, they at present making a great advantage to themselves to our
great prejudice by the War between us and Spain, whose King has lately
prohibited wearing the Manufacture of England, of which kind the Hollanders
will furnish them with of their own making, and if they want work-folkes, will
easily entice over English, wanting employment, to work for them, and teach
their people, by which means much increasing their Trade, and when they know
themselves, thereby to grow rich by increase of Trade, and consequently strong
by increase of Shipping and Marryners, and another Nation poor by decrease of
Trade, and also weak by decay of Shipping and Marryners; how forward will they
then be to prescribe Laws to such a decayed Nation: For it has been long
observed, that as the Spaniard aims to get the universal Monarchy of
Christendom, so the Hollander the universal Trade, not only of Christendom,
but of all the known World, from which they have been termed the Carryers of
the World through their multitude of Shipping, sending them out to all Nations
that have any Trade by Sea, and sometimes for Men of War, and until the late
encouraging Act for increasing the Navigation of this Land; The English
Merchants themselves, since the beginning of the late Wars in England, usually
freighted Holland Ships to fetch home their own Goods, because they would go
for less freight than the English Ships could, having less charge by carrying
fewer men than an English Ship of the same burden, and less Provision, which
Ships were usually ensured in London; and it is the Hollanders custom to this
day, that when they send any single Ship to the Southward for their own
Accounts, oftentimes ensure them in England, and if they miscarry, then the
English make good their losses, as too often it so falls out; and if such Ship
comes well home, they save the premium in sailing such Shipping with less
charges than the English do theirs of the same burden; and being so weakly
manned, if they at any time chance to meet a Turks man of War (they seldom
fight with them as the English do, and so oftentimes honorably acquit
themselves) but deliver up their Shipping without firing a Gun to save the Sea
man's Liberty, and what belongs unto them, and so arm the Turks against all
Christendom, but when they send unarmed Fleets into any Country at the fit
seasons of the year, when Merchandise is to be had in such Country, they are
bound for; then if there be danger, they send a squadron of Men of War to
convey them at the public charge, and these are seldom ensured; But if any
English Ship of force go the same voyage such single Dutch Ship went, seldom
any insurance is made (except she be missing, or her safety doubted) because
they usually go safer, being better provided of men and other necessaries for
defense against the danger of Enemies and bad Weather, and also before the said
Act, the Hollanders served us with the Commodityes of other Nations in their
own Ships, both in England and in our Western Plantations, while our English
Ships lay in harbor for want of employment, till they were inserviceable, and
our Marryners took employment of the Hollanders to sail their Ships to get
their lively hoods, to the great loss and dishonor of the English Nation; and
since the said late Act, how diligent the Hollanders have been, notwithstanding
the same, that to their cost a whole Fleet of them together were surprised,
trading at the Barbados, and forfeited according to the penalty of the said
Act, which shows how well they like Trading with us with foreign Goods in
their own Ships; that though they dared not bring any for England, fearing the
penalty of the said Act, yet they would run so great an hazard to serve our
Plantations, peradventure intending to overawe the penalty of Confiscation, by
continually having a greater power in Shipping there than we had, that if a
seizure had been attempted by the English there, they might have overpowered
them, and made such an attempt of no effect, not once dreaming that a Fleet of
Men of War would stop there to seize them in their way to Sancta Domingo and
Jamaica. Now although the said Act has breathed some refreshing to the
decaying Trade of the English Nation, yet it has not altogether cured her of
her disease, as will be shown hereafter; besides the present abuse not looked
into, as ought to be, in entering Strangers Ships in English men's names in the
Custom house.

It has been also observed how industrious the English Nation are and have
been, not only in contriving and building convenient and strong Ships for
burden, swift sailing, and of force, but also in mannaging the same as well in
single fights in Trade for defense against Pirates, and in Fleets in public
Wars with a foreign Enemy, to their perpetual honor and terror of their
Adversaries: Witness the many single fights at Sea against the Turks, to whom
it is believed the Dutch lose ten Ships for our one, and the remarkable
Sea Fights against the Hollanders themselves in the late Wars, wherein many
Merchants Ships from about 300. Tuns, to about 500. Tuns did engage against the
Enemy with the States Ships and Frigots to our great advantage, which at that
time would have been much wanted, if they had not been built; The Enemy
notwithstanding much overnumbring us every fight in Ships and Tunnage, and yet
supplied their loss of Ships daily taken and destroyed by us, assisting their
Men of War still with their Merchant Men of equal force and burden, and some
bigger, such as they usually send to the East Indies, which foregoing passages
show the excellent use of English Shipping, and the necessity of increasing
them, which cannot be done no way so well as by Trade, for War is known to be
chargeable, hazardous and bloody; therefore how ought Trade to be cherished,
maintained and increased with all power, diligence and invention that can be
contrived.

Secondly, If we take into consideration the state and condition our
Trading-Shipping were in before the late Wars in England, we may find by the
East India Companies account, that they alone did employ, in that trade, at
once 15000 Tunns of Shipping, which were accounted to be of the best sort of
Trading-Shipps belonging to England, of the burden of about 300 Tunns, to
about 600 Tunns: But the old Company were at last so decayed in their shipping,
through the discouragement of Trade, and undermining of the Dutch, and other
casualties, that they had hardly one good Shipp remaining at their giving over;
So the last new Company thought it better to freight ships for their
employment, which they always did, rather than build any: But now if the new
established Company will freight Ships also, and not build, they will find
very few of force and burden fitting for that employment; For I cannot hear,
for about these ten years past, that a Trading-ship of about 400 Tunns has
been built in England, and those few that have been built within that time,
seldom were so big as 200 Tuns, but I believe ten for one of less burden, which
with other slight Ships, that are usually ensured, do supply that little Trade
the Dutch have left the English Nation in the Straits, which in former times
used to employ, by estimation, not less than about 80. or 100 sale of good
Ships of about 3. and 400. Tunns burden each Ship and upwards; but now the
English Trade will not maintain and employ Ships of such burden and defense,
which is the reason so many small ones have been taken by the Spaniards of St.
Sebastians, Majorca and other places: And I have formerly known many Ships of
the like burden built, and equipped in England, purposely to send to Venice to
let out to that State for Men of War to serve them against the Turks, but the
Hollanders soon eat us out of that employment also, by serving them with
Ships of equal burden with ours for less freight than we could with our
Ships, which they might afford to do for the reasons hereafter declared.

And whereas the Company of Merchant Adventurers trading for Hamburgh, used
yearly to send about twenty good Ships thither, chiefly laden with the
Manufactures of England, the Vent whereof gave great employment to many
Tradesmen, besides the poor; but this year they have sent only one Ship from
London, the last shipping, and the Goods of that Ship will not go off neither,
and the Wool that makes these Manufactures, that usually sold for about 10 d.
per pound, is sold now, as I hear, for 6 d. or 7 d. which shows a great
alteration and deadness of Trade, which at this time is the general and daily
compliant of all Tradesmen of what profession soever; the like might be
instanced in our shipping-Trading for the East Country and other places, where
we send one now, formerly we sent ten at least, the continuance whereof will
much decrease the strength of the English shipping, and is an apparent sign of
the general decay of the foreign Trade of England, which ought to be so well
managed and encouraged without delay, as that we should equal, if not exceed
all other our Neighbor Nations: so if any one Nation grow greater in power
than another, so as the weaker become subject to the conditions of that one
greater Nation, either in State Affairs or government of Trade, how ready then
will other Nations be to endeavor to make their own terms? or to be ready to
make a prey of such a declined people, and if the case were ours, would it not
be so with us? other Nations bearing a kind of envy to our former happyness in
good Successes and noble. Achievements, both at home and abroad, for what
corner of the World has not been searched by us to find out Trade? the profit
whereof, (the reward of industry,) gave first boldness to venture to pass the
maine Ocean, and make new discoveryes in foreign parts round about the World,
and has enlarged our Nation with many new and large Plantations, to the
enriching, cherishing and employing of many thousands of our people, by which
may be discerned the flourishing and prosperous condition the English-shipping
were in, which without doubt will soon increase again with the increase of
Trade.

But it may be objected there is no such need of great Ships now, as has been
for the defense of the Seas, seeing we have so great and gallant a Fleet of men
of War, which are more serviceable upon occasion than Merchantmen, taken
into warlike employment.

It is answered, That admit a very strong Fleet of men of war were always
maintained, such a one as, in any man's judgment did equal any Fleet of men of
War of any neighbour-Nations, and that we should have War with any such
Nation, and in fight part of the Fleet should be lost, or so battered that they
could not be so suddenly recruited, or made serviceable as there might be
occasion for them to supply the place and service of those Ships that might be
so lost, or defective, but by Merchants Ships; As in the late War with
Holland, it was observed what gallant service every Merchants ship performed,
when each Captain was shifted out of his own ship into another, when at the
first, every Captain continuing in his own Shipp was not so adventurous, not
out of cowardice, as dreading what might happen to his person, but out of
desire to prevent the damage that might happen to his own Ship, which might
turn to the loss of his Owners, the Captain well knowing the charge in
repairing them again, or building others, and peradventure, if their old ones
had been lost, it might have been a hard thing for him that lost his ship to
get friends to join together to build him another; For now shipping is esteemed
the worst commodity this day in England, every one that has any, being willing
to sell, because they lose by them, through want of Trade and employment for
them, whereas if trade were quick, and any proffit came by them, every one
would be desirous to be interessed in them.

Moreover, if a standing Fleet of men of War, as aforesaid, should be
maintained, and having a War with another Nation, that Fleet should hold
allwaies good, so as there were no need of Merchants Ships to join with them,
yet it must be considered that infallibly the want of Trade will much
impoverish the people of England, which otherwise know not how to subsiist,
they increasing so much notwithstanding the late Wars, and the Land (though
full of plenty) not increasing with them being an Island, witness the many
entertained for Soldiers, either for want of Trades, or by decay of their
Trades, and the many daily going for Ireland and the Plantations, and yet there
is no miss of them, for in any Town or Parish where any House or Farm is to be
let, (notwithstanding the improvement of the late Kings and Bishops Lands etc.)
how many strive for it till the Rent thereby is so raised upon the Landlord by
out-bidding each other, till at last he that takes it, is either undone or
weakened in his estate, with overrenting it; and so the peoples estates are too
often impaired in defraying their respective charge for want of Trade; And
considering that such a standing Fleet of men of War will be a great charge
and burden to the people to maintain it, which will help to impoverish them
more and more; But on the contrary the preservation and increase of Trade, will
not only maintain a gallant Fleet of warlike Ships and Mariners, such as all
the known World will not only admire, but stand in fear of, and will also
enrich and strengthen the whole Nation.

Thirdly, the condition and number of the Hollanders remaining shipping in
Trade is such, that they are beholding to the English for them, in that not
only their shipping, but their people too were not destroyed in the late
Wars with them, which in probability might have come to pass, had the War
continued till this time, with the like success, that it pleased God then daily
to give to the English Nation; but if the same success had happened to them,
their former crueltyes to the English in Amboyna, and present practices in
East India, would make it questionable, whether they would have granted such
good conditions to the English, as they did to them at the concluding of the
Peace between both parties; For who knows but that their besiedging Bantam
(which is supposed to be taken by them) is only a Design upon the Natives,
contrived purposely to enable them by the gayning of it wholly to remove the
English from that Factory, to prevent them of Trade in India, now the English
Company trading thither had so much discontinued it: and if they could do as
much by Surratt also; then how easy will it be for them to command the Coast?
they being so powerful in Shipping there, may deny any Nation trading thither,
without danger, but whom they please, and then if we will have any Commodityes
from thence, it must be with their good liking and consent: But it is not often
known that they easily yield to any thing that hinders their advantage, or the
increase of their Traffic and Navigation. And if they should gain that trade
to themselves, as is doubted is their desires and design, and is feared they
will effect without a Bank in England, and then it is believed it will be more
profitable to them by Trade than all the West Indies is any way to the King of
Spain, and if the English should lose that trade, as it has been in great
danger, then what need have we of Merchants ships of burden and force? and
who would build any, having no employment for them? and if no employment for
such shipping of force through decay of Trade, then in a short time what will
become of the Maritime Power and Strength of the English Nation? For besides
the many advantages the Dutch will accrue to themselves by having the sole
trade of East India, enriching their people many sundry ways,

This great prejudice they will do us,

We shall be weaker by so much Shipping, and so many mariners as we might
employ thither.

It will hinder those Tradesmen, in their several profession, that furnish
those ships that go to Sea, as Shipwrights, Smiths, Mast-makers, Sayl-makers,
Ropemakers, etc. and diminish the trade of those Materials.

It will hinder the vent of our Native Comodityes, which those Shipping would
carry thither, which will impoverish our people that made those Commodityes.

It will hinder us of those commodityes which that Country does afford, that
we may have great need of, as in time of War; of Saltpeter to make
Gunpowder; so as we shall have no commodity from thence but what the Dutch will
spare us at their own prizes: which makes me remember a notable passage I have
heard of the Durch in India, where a Ship of theirs arriving at a trading-Port
in that Country, laden with one only commodity, which they knew the place
wanted, therefore set what price on it they pleased, which the Townsemen
refused to give them, and on the contrary held off buying the same, presuming
they would take their offer for the Commodity, rather than go to another
Market, or lie in Port with a great charge of Men, Victuals, and Wages, to
expect more, which the Dutch perceiving, resolved to prevent the Townsemen of
their delaying them, and yet also have their price, therefore immediately
caused the one half of the commodity to be carried ashore, and there burnt in
the sight of the Townsemen, and then demanded as much for the remaining half as
the whole would have come to at the price they made, which the Inhabitants were
forced to give for the said half part, rather than want the said Commodity,
fearing least half the remaining part should be burnt also, and then must give
as much for one quarter of it, as they might have had the whole parcel for
before any of it was burnt; Such is the force and power of trade where a
useful commodity is wanting, and when engrossed into one hand.

But besides the Trade of India, it is too much felt how the English Trade in
Turkey is at this present; also, in the East Country, and at Hamburgh, to
serve all Germany, and in all the Streights over, where the Dutch not only
under-sell us in their own, but in our Native Commodities, as Cloth, Tyn,
Lead, etc. they buying these Commodities of the English at the best hand, and
cheapest season of the year; as, Cloth carried over to them rough and white,
they die and dress, and sell it before we can ours dressed and shipped from hence;
besides that, they sell made in Suffolk, and of their own making of English and
Spanish Wool mixed together; also, they may buy our Lead here, when the English
Merchants ship out least, at that time it is cheapest, and commonly rises at
the going out of Turkey Ships, or at any Herring season, which I have often
known to my cost, to rise from 11 or 12 l. per Fodder, to 14 or 15 l. per
Fodder, and upwards, as at this day, which is about 20 l. per cent. difference;
which with the cheapness of Freight in their own ships, to what is paid in
English ships, and saving insurance by sending Convoys with their Fleets,
enables them to undersel us abroad, and o have the preemption of Foreign Goods
for Returns, and raise the price of tthem upon us, so have they advantage of us
every way, to the great discouragement of the English Trade, and insensible
weakening of the English power, which courses the English cannot take for want
of stock, much of it lying dead, sometimes two or three years, and in danger
oftentimes in a remote Country, in unsold Commodities, as at this day: And
should they take up moneys at interest, to prosecute such a Trade, as the case
now stands, it would suddenly and insensibly eat them out of their Estates,
which oftentimes is gained with long and toilsome labor, and great hazard. On
the contrary, the Dutch are herein enabled to raise good profit by the
quickness of their Returns, the largeness of their Stock, which is increased by
Banks, and the continuance of their Trades, from one generation to another, and
partly by lowness of money at interest, which is occasioned as I shall show
hereafter.

The like may be said of the Trade in Russia, the East Country, and other
places, where the Dutch and we have trading together, they find ways to
undermine us, to our great loss and discouragement, though few old Traders
consider the cause in all their lives. But I instance only in the two former
Trades, because they chiefly give employment to our Warlike shipping Trade.

Fourthly, touching the reason of the Hollanders so great thriving in Trade
before us, may be these:

Their Statesmen sitting at the Helm, steering the affairs of their Government,
are many of them Merchants in present trade, or have been bred so in their
minorities, or by travel in other Countries, or well grounded experience at
home, have well understood the course of Trade, whereby they are enabled the
better (making the increase, Protection, and encouragement of Trade their
chiefest care) to further it in their interest of State with other Nations in
all Treaties, and therein make such provision for the furtherance thereof in
their own behalfs, as may make most for their benefit and advantage, and
prejudice and inconvenience of the other State, whom they can most prevail with
and overruled; so that their good management in foreseeing the benefits and
inconveniences that may happen, is one main cause of their so admired
flourishing condition, from so small beginnings: For who can give better advice
in any Trade, than he that studies it, or is bred up in the same.

They have a custom, that when any of their Tradesmen dye, they divide their
estates equally among their children, whereby the youngest having equal
education with the eldest, is with his stock capable of driving as good a trade
as the eldest; by which means, their estates in trade descend to their
posterities, and also the rules, instructions, and many years experience and
observations, that gained their Parents their estates, and oftentimes the very
same trades also, they having no lands to purchase, as other Nations have.

But on the contrary, it is the usual custom in England, when a Tradesman dies
that has children, having raised his estate, to give mean portions to his
younger sons, and make the eldest possessor of the greatest part of his estate,
who addicts himself oftentimes to the pleasures of Hunting, Hawking, and such
like pastimes, betaking himself wholly to a Country life, were either by
increase of his charge, ill husbandry, or want of skill to manage his estate,
which peradventure is thereby much impaired, therefore is usually desirous, if
he have so much money left, to put his sons apprentice to learn trades to get
their livelihoods: And when they are made Freemen (if they did not miscarry
before) are oftentimes as far to seek for a way to get their livings by, for
want of stock to set up their Trades, as their Grandfather was, before he
gained their fathers estate. But if the Grandfather, who knew how to get that
estate he left his eldest son, had also bred him up in his own trade, or in
some other, he had been capable to instruct and enrich his children by it also;
so as instead of weakening the estate, it would have mightily increased on him,
and have augmented the stock of the Nation.

Their true and faithful making their Manufactures without deceit, as Cloth,
Says, Serges, Perpetuanaes, etc. and giving them their due contents, makes
them the more serviceable, and their several goodness (by experience) being
known abroad, causes them to sell before those of the Manufacture of England,
that are mode slight and unservicable, wanting their due contents and goodness;
which is not so well looked into as ought to be, according to the good Laws
provided in that behalf, which not only brings the English Commodityes into
disgrace at market abroad, but is a great prejudice to the Nation in general
by wanting Vent for them, the makers striving daily to exceed each other in
slight making, as Cloth made of flocks mingled with Wool, etc. that they may
the sooner sell and afford them at the English Merchants low price, to which he
is tied to buy, being guided by the Dutch man's low rate he sells of the same
kind at market, contenting themselves, and thriving with the less profit by
selling much greater quantities abroad of several sorts of Goods, and having
quicker returns and greater Stocks than the English, and so the Dutch have the
pre-eminence in the sale of their Manufactures before us, by their true making
to their very files and needles.

Their care and vigilance over their traffic in taking off and laying on
Impositions on sundry Commodities to quicken or dull them in their sale and
price, as they see occasion to encourage their own Manufactures, or hinder
those of a foreign Nation, for the better employment of their shipping and
people, besides each Merchants particular correspondence with their respective
Factors or Servants in the Countries where they Trade, in which they are also
very dextrous in communicating certain and early advice, as well of the
public, as of their own private occurrences.

Their giving countenance and encouragement to new desighes propounded to them
for public good, which whets the invention, and ocasions new discoveries, and
the bringing in of many profitable and delightful Arts and Mysteries among
them, the Author never wanting his due reward, which is made good to him out of
the Public Stock, none feeling the charge thereof, and is also preferred to
such employment as his genius and capacity leads him unto, wherein he may be
more profitable to himself and them, preferring such for their merit and
encouragement, rather than others less deserving, for favor or sinister ends.

But their chief and most considerable way, by which they have brought
themselves, to what they are, is their profitable use of Banks.

Fifthly, the benefit they have received by Banks, are these:

By the help thereof they have raised themselves from Poor, Distressed, to High
and mighty States.

They have increased the General Stock of their Country so much, that they
can, when they please, ingrosse the particular Commodity of one Country, and
sell it again at their own price, in the same, or another that wants it.

They maintained Wars many years with the King of Spain, and hired foreign
Soldiers, to save their own people in that War, and received in ready money
(with which they paid their Armies) the proceed of their Utens^is of War, and
other Commodities they fold their Enemies, which they bought with imaginary
money in Banks, and so furnished the Spaniard with those things he wanted, for
their own profit, which otherwise they knew another Nation would else have done.

They have increased their Trade, and thereby grown so rich and strong in
Shipping and Mariners, that they forced the King of Spain to a Peace with them.

To make their own terms with the King of Denmark.

To hold the King of France to such conditions as have not always pleased him.

To make War with the English at Sea. to whom they there always yielded and
acknowledged obedience and submission.

To rule over many petty Kings and Principalities in the East Indies, and other
places, where they have power to overcome them.

These are some of the benefits the Hollanders have received by increase of
Trade; occasioned by Banks.

Sixthly, the prejudice we receive by their Banks are these:

It brings down their Interest of money to 3 or 4 l. per cent. (at which rate.
I know at present many thousand pounds there let out, in a parcel, in ready
money, which the Dutch do often deliver by Exchange for London, and there the
same Takers at Interest out of the Banks, may let it out again in England at 6
per cent. formerly at 8 l. per cent. and when the money is come into them
again, it may be more than suspected, that it is privately sent into Holland,
both in Silver and Gold, some profit arising thereby, the latter being grown so
dear, and both far more scarce in England than formerly (little being of late
imported to Coin, for sundry reasons, and so plentiful in Holland, that great
payments have been made there in Sterling money only, besides that concealed
in their Bank, which is a great hinderance to Trade in England, by wanting so
much stock as is so transported, and does also impoverish this Land.

Also, by their Banks, they may be furnished in England by Exchange, with ready
money to buy the Native Commodities of the Maker, at the first hand, and at the
cheapest seasons of the year, as Lead, Tyn, Cloth, Bays, Says, Serges,
Perpetuanaes, Stockings, etc. having, as is suspected, their English Packers at
London, to buy such Goods there for their Accounts, and their Agents residing
in the Countries and Towns in England, where such Manufactures are made, and
there buy them cheaper of the Maker himself for ready money, by about 10 per
cent. than the English Merchants can do at London, of such Makers Factors to
whom else he sends them, to sell for his Account, the Maker thereby saving
Factorage, and other charges and Adventures, and making bad debts in sending
such Goods to sell at London, besides uncertainty in selling them for time, or
ready money, and other troubles and casualities in returning the money into the
Country; for which reasons, the Maker had rather sell a better bargain by
himself at home, receiving his ready money there, to serve his occasions, than
run the former uncertainties, by which help of Banks, having money there at a
low rate, the Dutch are enabled, and do undersel the English Merchants at
Market in their own Native Commodities, to their great loss and discredit; and
it is doubted, that many English Merchants also do color such Goods for them
at the Custom House, having also, understood that at this time English Wool and
Fullers Earth, is too often carried from hence into Holland, in the English Men
of War, such ships being never visited by the Officers of the Custom house,
which ought suddenly to be prevented, the Dutch being too well stored with
those Commodities, most of the Wool of this years growth in Kent, being doubted
already to be transported from, or near Dover, Rochester, etc. which are the
back doors out of which such Commodities are suspected to be too often
conveyed, through connivance.

But if it be objected, That the English may also buy of the Maker on the same
terms: It may be answered, They want stock, through deadness and decay of
Trade. But if it be replied, That they may then take up money at Interest to do
it: To which is answered, That if they have so much credit to do so, they must
then give 6 l. per cent. for it, besides procuring and continuance, and the
Dutch has it for about 3 l. per cent. or under, which with the cheapness of
freight in their own ships, etc. does enable them notwithstanding, to sell our
Native Commodies for us abroad, cheaper than we can afford to sell them our
selves, and so secretly eat the bread out of our own mouths, and undermine,
and work us out of Trade, and employment of our own ships all the world over,
being in the East Indies accounted much inferior to them.

By the help of Banks, they so much augment their Stocks, that they set out so
many hundred of Busses, and other Fisher boats yearly, to catch Herring and Cod
fish in our Seas, with which they serve all Christendom, to their incredible
gains, and formerly our own Nation, to our great loss, decay of our Fishery,
and many Fishing Towns on the Sea Coast.

These inconveniences we receive by their Banks, and many other, there being
none in England to countermine them, by which it may appear, it is not
altogether the raising of Excise, or laying on Impositions upon the Commodities
retailed and spent within our selves, as is often suggested to be the cause of
the present deadness of Trade, but the mere advantage and undermining of the
Dutch, with their great Stocks, who always have also had a great Excise charged
upon the most part of the Commodities spent within themselves, which causes
the spender of such Goods to pay dearer for them, they being enabled so to do,
by cherishing their Foreign Trade for the general Good, in laying on small
duties on the commodities transported, with other privileges and good orders
to punish misdemeanors in Trade, wherein they are as unmercifully just, in the
executing them without respect of persons, for the Public good, as the English
are too often unjustly merciful, in sparing each other for private ends, to the
general hurt.

Seventhly, the good we may do our selves by Banks, if settled in England, are
many; for no Nation yet ever made use of them, but they flourished and thrived
enceedingly.

First, they will by well ordering them, bring back the Gold and Silver, which
has been drained out of this Land by the Hollanders Banks, and by other
Princes raising the value thereof in their Dominions.

They will much increase the Stock of this Land, which will wonderfully
increase all manner of Trade, and will bring in that excellent transporting
Trade, and make England the Staple of all Foreign Commodities, as Holland is at
this time, and has been since they had the use of Banks, who have nothing
considerable of their own growth and Manufactures, yet have the Staple of all
Commerce as a rich Treasure, in Money and Jewels, all Materials for Shipping
and War, all manner of Clothing, and the Granary and Vineyard of Europe, with
which Commodities they furnish most Countries, which England may also do, with
much ease and profit, and make this Land the Staple for Trade, for by
experience our people are known to be as tractable in Trade as any other
Nation, had they but Stock, which is thought to be the only thing wanting,
besides a few privileges in Ports, to carry on that so much desited and
profitable Trade, and our Land lies more convenient for it than any other,
having the Sea open on every side, and so many safe Harbors to shelter
Shipping in foul weather, and so many convenient Ports for landing of Goods,
from whence they may be transported with all winds, at all seasons of the year,
and the English Mariners are as good as any be in the known world, and may have
as good shipping to carry goods for as little freight, and may victual them as
cheap as any other Nation.

They will increase, and much encourage the Fishery of this Nation, and breed
up in that employment many thousand of Seamen, which will find employment in
the East Indies, Streights, and other Voyages into other parts of the world,
and will also increase and strengthen the decayed Fisher Towns, and all other
Ports and Havens along the Sea Coast.

They will increase the Warlike Trading Shipping, and Mariners of this Nation,
which will much strengthen us against all our Enemies.

They will also increase the Revenues and Customs of this Land by increase of
Trade.

They will wonderfully employ the poor of this Land, and increase the natural
Mannfactures thereof, and make us capable to buy or sell at home or abroad,
with as much advantage as any other Nation; whereas now, if any English
Merchant buy any Foreigh Goods abroad, with the proceed of English goods there,
and transport them for any place but England, he is in danger to lose by the
Voyage.

They will make the English capable to engross the Commodity of any Country,
and withold it from another that may be at enmity with us, to whom the said
Commodity may be useful to our prejudice, and also make our own price of it.

They will increase Trade in our Plantations; and cause ships to be built in
New England, as good, or better than any be built in Holland, to carry goods
for as little freight, and will also encourage the m^king materials for
shipping there, and will save our own timber here until a time of need, which
should be preserved and increased as much as could be, having of late been much
decayed and sold into Holland, as is much suspected.

They will furnish Factors in England with credit to pay Custom, and charges of
a great Cargo of goods, which may on a sudden be consigned to them: for many
times such English Factors may be of a good estate and credit, yet have not
always a great Cash lying by them for such uses (though the Dutch are seldom
without it) therefore may oftentimes be forced to strain their credit, to take
up money at interest, or fell all, or part of such goods at under rate for want
thereof, which may be a great prejudice to themselves, and loss to their
principles; and is believed, causes many such great Commissions to be carried
from the English, and Consigners to the Dutch residing in England, to their
great benefit and advantage, and loss and prejudice of the English Nation.

They will increase trade in Ireland, which will people that Island, and
increase the revenues thereof.

They will furnish many young men with Stock, that have by their industry and
well spent time and travels in their Apprentiships, gained good experience in
Foreign Traffic, but when they are come to be for themselves, wanting stock,
friends, or credit to begin to trade with (being commonly younger brothers) are
thereby much discouraged, and thinking to drive away such discontent, do
oftentimes fall into bad Company, and take ill courses, to the utter ruin of
their hopes and fortunes, which otherwise might have made good Commonwealths
men, which is the greatest reason, why so few young men, among so many
entertained, do come to good.

They will preserve many good men from failing and losing their credit; for
instead of losing by trade, they will by the well regulating of it, be more
certain of profit, and the quick and sure satisfaction of a debt by Assignment
in Bank, will preserve many a good man's credit, which many times is impaired,
though he may have a good estate out in Trade beyond the Seas, and cannot
command it, meant where it is due. It being seldom seen, that any of the Dutch
Nation fail, and if any of them by losses do miscarry, being known to be
industrious, are soon credited again with stock out of Bank, or otherwise to
recover themselves again by trade.

And many others, which trial and experience will daily discover, as quick and
easy, paying Bills of Exchange, Foreign or Domestic, and all other p^yments,
preventing fraudulent payments in counterfeit and clipped Coin, or mil-telling
money, rectifying errors in Accounts, which occasion Lawsuits, preventing
theft, and breaking open houses, where money is suspected to lie, and robbing
on the highways Graziers, Carriers, or others that use to carry money from
Fairs, or other places, which may be returned by Assignment in Bank, whereas
now the several Hundreds in many places are forced to guard such as carry
money, for fear of their being robbed, and such Hundred paying them the money
the lost, as it has often fallen out of late times, etc.

Eighthly, a Bank is a certain number of sufficient men of estates and credit
joined together in a joint stock, being, as it were, the general Cash-keepers
or Treasurers of that place where they are settled, letting out imaginary money
at Interest at 2 and or 3 l. per cent. to Tradesmen, or others, that agree with
them for the same, and making payment thereof by Assignation, and passing each
man's Account from one to another, with much facility and ease, and saving much
trouble in receiving and paying of money, besides many suits in Law, and other
losses and inconveniences, which do much hinder trade; for oftentimes a
Merchant has goods come from some place beyond the Sea, which he is not
willing to sell at the price current, knowing either that he shall lose by
them, or that he hopes they will yield more in England, or some other Country,
when there will be more need of them, therefore is desirous to keep them, and
yet drive on his trade, which peradventure he cannot well do, wanting stock, so
much of it lying dead in the said Commodity, therefore procures credit in the
Bank for so much as he shall have occasion for, at the rates aforesaid, and
receives and makes payment thereof where he has occasion for it, by Assignment
in Bank; as for example, the said Merchant buys Cloth of a Cloathier, for 100
l. value more or less, and goes with him to the Bank, where he is Debtor so
much money as he takes up, and the Clothier is made Creditor in Account for so
much as he sold for to the said Merchant, then such Cloathier having occasion
to pay money to a Stapler or Woolmonger for Wool, he does buy of him, so the
said Clothier is made Debtor, and the Woolmonger Creditor in Account: the said
Woolmonger has bought his Wool of a Country Farmer, and must pay him for it,
so the Woolmonger is made Debtor, and the Farmer Creditor: the Farmer must pay
his Rent to his Landlord, with the proceed of the said Wool; so the Farmer is
made Debtor, and such Landlord Creditor: the Landlord for his occasion, buys
goods of a Mercer, Grocer, Vintner, or the like, then he is made Debtor, and
such Mercer, or other Tradesman Creditor: then peradventure such Mercer, or
other Tradesman, buys goods of the same Merchant that took up the first credit
in Bank, and stands yet Debtor there, but upon sale of goods to the Mercer, or
other Tradesman, both clear their Account in Bank, and such Mercer, or other
Tradesman is made Debtor, and the said Merchant Creditor: thus every man's
Account is cleared, and so in all trades, as occasion presents, which way, if
it be thought fit to be settled for a trial at London, I verily believe will be
found so convenient, and such an encouragement to Trade by increase of the
Stock of the Land, and be such an ease to the people, that it will be soon
desired that others might be also settled at Edinburgh for Scotland, at Dublin
for Ireland, and in some other chief Cities and Shire Towns in England, as
York, Bristoll, and Exceter, etc. for the furtherance of Trade, by holding
correspondence with each other, than which I do not apprehend or know any way
better to equal the Dutch in Trade both at home and abroad in buying and
selling all sorts of Commodityes, and making quick returns, and also so much
exceed them, as by far this Land lies more convenient for Trade than theirs
does, and will also suddenly enrich the people, and increase and maintain the
maritime power and strength thereof.

Lastly, To which may be added a Court of Merchants to be chosen every year, to
end and determine all controversies arising from one Merchant to another; for
although such Suites may be determined in the respective Courts already
established in England, yet the guilty Adversary takes such advantage by
appeals from one Court to another, having oftentimes a considerable Estate in
his hand, the profit whereof in Trade making him unwilling to part with it,
therefore with the Interest of it wageth Law with the parties to whom it is
truly due to his great charge, wrong and prejudice, if not utter undoing, and
then at last it is oftentimes referred to good men that are Merchants and
understand such matters and Accounts better than many worthy Lawyers do; but in
case such a Court be not approved to be settled, then the Court of Insurance
sitting in the Insurance Office, who are yearly chosen, may have power to
determine all such matters as they do causes of Insurance, which will much
quicken and encourage Trade to the enriching and strengthening the English
Nation.

And seeing a Court of Merchants is so necessary, what a glorious and
honorable profession would it be, if your Highness Court were all Merchants,
and also your domestic Servants every one adventuring so much Stock as he
could spare into other parts of the World, as well as to the East Indies (your
Highness having been pleased lately to give so great countenance and
encouragement to that Company) which may be easily effected: for those that
know not the way of Trade may join in a Stock, or come in a share with the
experienced until the ingenuous have learned it themselves, for it is presumed
there is but few but may spare something to venture, which may be a means to
enrich themselves and their Posterity; for it is well known that many Servants
of both Sexes to private men in Holland do improve their Estates by having
Adventures in Trade, which all your Highness Court would be soon in invited
unto by the profits they know any one has received by first adventuring, which
will also cause these benefits to ensue.

It will be an high example to the Gentry of the Land as well the Elder as the
younger Brothers, and their domestics to do the same, therein employing their
minds, which oftentimes are busied in contentious Suits in Law, or unnatural
contriving how to overreach and deceive one another.

It may make your Highness Court and domestics the most rich and flourishing
of any Potentates in the World, and loath and hate unhandsome and dishonorable
ways, to maintain and enrich themselves, whereas in other Princes Courts their
necessities and covetousness does enforce and induce them to buy and sell
Offices and Places of trust, and making use of the time present (doubting their
continuance, length of life, or change of affairs) to raise and enrich
themselves by bribes, to beg or obtain Suits of their Prince, which may be to
the general hurt, dishonorable for him to grant, or loss of the affections or
good opinions of his people.

It will add to the reputation of the English, and cause them to be better
esteemed and respected of the Princes and Subjects in the foreign Countries
where they reside and Trade, and will increase the maritime power and strength
of this Nation by so much shipping as they will employ.

It may cause Grievances in Trade to be sooner heard, and redressed which is
oftentimes hindered by a particular person to the general hurt, when the
Courtier as well as the private Tradesman feels the evil thereof, which
oftentimes for want of being heard in due time may continue unremedied or
deferred till it be too late.

And diverse other tending much to the tranquillity of your H^ghness and the
welfare of the English Nation, which with your Highness favorable
encouragement I sh^alin all humility be ready to make known unto you, and
remove any objections as can be alleged in the premises, and propound a way,
how it may be effected, and the evils remedied and prevented, being unwilling
to bury the Talent in a Napkin which it has pleased the giver of all Blessings
in his great goodness and mercy, to bestow upon me, hoping I shall not offend
in tendering this with my best services to your Highness.

Certain proposalls for establishing a Bank at London, humbly offered (by
Samuel Lamb of London Merchant.)
THat the Society of good men or Governors that shall manage the Bank, be
chosen by the several Companies of Merchants of London (viz.) East India
Turkey, Merchant Adventurers, East Country, Muscovia, Greenland and Guynne
Companies, each Company choosing out of themselves two or more of the most
understanding and ablest members of each respective Company, and when any of
the said members, so chosen, do happen to dye, then the said Company of which
he was that dyed to choose another in the room and stead of the deceased from
time to time, and when such members are chosen and met together, then they to
choose to themselves two or more of the ablest Merchants that Trade chiefly or
altogether for Spain, and the like who Trade for France, Italy, and the West
Indies, for each place two or more, as shall be thought fitting; and when any
of them chosen that Trade for the Countries last named do dye then the major
part of all the members together, chosen as before prescribed, may choose
others from time to time trading to the said Countries which he did that dyed,
and when all these so chosen meet together, they may have power to make orders
of their own approving or contriving for the carrying on and mannaging of the
Work, and such a Society, so dealing into all parts of the World, will well
know most English Merchants that Trade into any part thereof, and thereby know
whom to credit that have occasion, and by their knowledge will well understand
how to govern the Bank, and by the help thereof countermine the Dutch in their
designs in any port of the World, where they prejudice the English by their
Banks; for in any place where there is Exchanges or Trade, they may lay a
great stock to furnish the English with credit and ability to carry on their
laborious and honest designs, and by this means may be carried on any great
and notable Enterprise, for which purpose, and that they may perform with
every person that has money in Bank and preserve the credit thereof
inviolable, and without the least blemish, they must keep their Cash in a safe
place from the danger of fire, and other accidents, as the Army Treasure is in
Guild Hall, and so are the general Treasurers and Cash keepers of most of the
spare money of the place, where they are settled, and most men will desire to
have money there that they may have credit in Bank two or three times the
value thereof, for he will not be to be of any Estate or worth that has not
some money in Bank to procure credit there without trouble against he have
occasion for it.

That all be at Liberty to bring in any money into Bank or not, and if any,
that have money there, desire to have it again in kind should have it at
demand, the Dutch had rather have their money in Bank than in their own
keeping, accounting payment in Bank better than any other by per Cent by their
good and punctual payment.

That they allow such Interest to the Aged and Widows that desire to have
their money in Bank, as shall be agreed unto for and toward their maintenance.

That they let out Imaginary money or credit upon Ticket at 2. and 3. l. per
cent. at the most.

That all Bills of Exchange be received and paid in Bank.

That the said chosen men do take a house near the Exchange for convenience of
Merchants resorting thither, and sit there such certain hours of the day to be
appointed.

That the good men, who manage the Bank, do make up their Accounts at least
once in every year.

That the profits of the Bank go to the good men that manage the same, in lieu
of their great care and pains, and defraying Bank charges, and Officers
Sallaries, or so much as shall be thought fitting to be reserved toward the
increase of the Stock, and as the Bank increases in credit, so the
reservation to increase to augment the Stock, but the Stock always to remain
whole and entire.

Or any other, or so many more that shall be thought fitting to be settled by
Act of Parliament, therein declaring in what manner, and by whom the same shall
be managed and governed, granting power to such Governors to choose Officers,
and make Orders to carry on the Work, and thereby also to be enacted that none
seize, molest, or disturb the Bank, or violate the credit thereof upon such
great penalties as shall be thought fitting.

That the same Bank may also furnish another Bank with a competent Stock, to
let out any sum of money under five or ten l. at reasonable rates upon pawns
or other Security; whereas now many poor people, to raise a small Stock to get
a living by, are forced to give intolerable rates, as about 6 d. per Week for
the use of 20 s.

And convenient Orders would soon be contrived to carry on such a charitable
work, if it be approved after trial made of the former Bank described.

And such a Society to be chosen every year, as is before proposed, with an
able Civilian joined with them, would be an excellent knowing Committee, or
Court of Merchants to regulate and advance Trade, and determine Controversies
therein arising, having incomparable correspondence together with all the
World, by communicating every ones advice, knowledge and experience to each
other, having thereby knowledge of the transactions and occurrences of every
Country, and so knowing most men's dealings, and the Accounts and Trade of all
places, and so the better enabled to judge of any matter coming before them,
and contrive Remedies for all grievances in Trade for the advantage of the
English Nation.

Here follow the Remedies against the evils observed in the Book.
A Bank will hinder importing of goods in Strangers Ships contrary to the Act
for increase of Navigation, and daily entering such Ships in English men's names.

A Bank will increase the general Stock and trade, which will cause Ships to
be built for the English as cheap as any other Nation can build any, to carry
goods for as little freight into any Country, which will cause them to be
employed as soon or before any Strangers Ships by all Nations that have
occasion, and then we need not fear entering their Ships in English men's names,
so few in likelihood to come then for England.

A Bank will prevent Packers, or others that buy Goods in England for
Dutchmens Accounts, and coloring them under English men's names at the
Custom House, by cunning and fraudulent pretenses, suspected to be now
practiced, notwithstanding the Laws and penalties in force, and lately revived
against such evils.

A Bank will increase the general stock so much, that it will enable the
English to buy for ready money, as good cheap of the maker or otherwise, as any
agents for any Strangers can do, by which means the English will be enabled
to sell abroad for as much profit, and at as low a price as any other Nation
can of the like sort of goods, and Cheaper, by saving Strangers Custom
outward, if such goods be fairly entered, and when they know the English have
found the way to undersell them, and gain bt it too, they will have but small
encouragement to contrive ways to employ Agents oy buy any English goods in
England, and Ship them out for them: and when the ma^ers of English
manufactures find such quick vent for them, they will then strive ma much to
excel each other in true making, as now in Slight making, this will bring
English Manufactures in good request again at market, and will cause the
English to have the same advantage of the Dutch, as the Dutch now have of them
in buying foreign Commodities, as in selling our own abroad, they growing so
populous, their Shipping so numerous, their Stock and credit of their Bank so
great.

A Bank in England will hinder transporting of English Wool, and Fullers
earth out of England.

A Bank will increase the general Stock and Trade so much, that it will
encourage and increase making the woollen Manufactures in England, and employ
not only the makers thereof now here, but invite those out of Holland that are
gone thither already; for the great quantities that will be made at home, and
afforded at easier rates than the Dutch can theirs of the same goodnese, which
will discourage the making any in Holland, so they will have no occasion for
our Wool and Fullers earth, which is chargeable for them to obtain against a
strict Law, and the greater use there is of Wool in England, will cause it to
be dearer, so as it will be impossible for the Dutch then to make any woollen
Manufactures, without great probability to loose by them; the English being so
enabled to make Cheaper of equal goodness, so if they have no use for wool,
they will need but little Fullers earth.

By which it may be plainly discerned that the mere advantage the Dutch have of
a Bank, is the cause of the aforesaid and other evils, and of their gaining
so much by our Loss, and of all other Nations that have not a Bank; which I
believe caused the King of France to raise the value of his Coyns, to hinder
them carrying it out of his Dominions: For in any place that has no Bank
where they carry any Commodityes and sell them for ready money, how easily may
they carry back the same money for a return, and put it into their own Bank,
and with a Ticket of credit there buy other Goods at home or abroad by
exchange, and still make returns in money, or prohibited Goods, and so
secretly beggar or impoverish any Nation they so deal withal. and so by
exchange they may charge vast sums in any Country by credit in Bank, and on
a sudden, or by degrees, insensibly sweep away all the Treasure out of any
Country and then may easily overcome them, wanting stock to carry on such a
War, and to buy such materials for War as may be wanted within themselves,
which must be had from another Country; But in a Country where a Bank is
settled, and transportation of Money forbidden, a Law may be made to prevent
this dangerous evil; For by so much as their general stock and shipping is
greater than any other Nation, so much more advantage have they of any such
Nation as have not a Bank; to ruin them with greater expedition, and may
secretly lay a Plot to do it at pleasure; And may it not be so with England,
when her Mariners and Shipping are decayed, by permiting Goods to be imported
daily in strangers Ships as now are, contrary to the Act for increase of
Navigation.

It may be objected that rich men will not bring their Money into Bank for
these two Reasons,

First, because they will not discover their estate so much, which will cause
great Taxes to be laid on them. Secondly, that in a Monarchical Government,
the Supreme Governor may seize or borrow the money in Bank, to carry on that
public Design, so the money may not be returned again into the Bank, which
will ruin the credit thereof, and undo such as have estates therein.
To the first, it is answered that if rich men will not bring in their money
into Bank, then those that desire to be rich will for their conveniencie and
ease to attain riches.

Also those that would be thought to be rich, will for the same reasons, and
both to gain, support and increase their credit.

To the second it is hoped that his Highness the Lord Protector (to further so
good a Work) will be pleased to consent to a Law to be made as aforesaid, that
no supreme Governor may seize, molest or disturb the Bank upon any occasion
whatsoever under a great penalty.

That till a Bank be settled and take such effect as is hoped it may, to remedy
the evils before mentioned, that a capable honest person be appointed by his
Highness the Lord Protector to reside at London, to take Account of the entryes
of all Ships there, and also to take care that no strangers Ships be entered (as
now daily are) contrary to the Act for increase of Navigation; and that the
said Officer do over-see and keep account of all the entryes of all ships in
all other Ports throughout England, And also prevent as much as may be
transporting English wool, and Fullers earth, and entering Strangers Goods in
English men's names, which is a great prejudice to the English Nation, and the
said Officer to have such fitting Sallary allowed him by the Commissioners of
the Custom house as shall be appointed, or such other allowance to be paid by
the Master of each Ship (as formerly they did, and do now desire to do without
charge to the State) according to a Table of Fees as was usually paid by them
before Colonel Harvy was a Commissioner.

A POSTSCRIPT.
IT is objected that the East India Company trading into the East Indies is
unprofitable to the English Nation, because they send out of England so much
money thither to drive that trade, that it has wasted the English coins, and
impoverished the Land.

It is answered, that if the Dutch do not disturb the English in that trade, it
is probable they may be furnished from their Factory at Cormanteen on the gold
coast in Guienne, and from China with gold enough, also from Japan with silver
to carry on that trade, as the Dutch themselves do, and then there will be no
occasion to send any out of England to the prejudice thereof.

But admit the said Company should have occasion yearly to transport foreign
coins thither out of England, they should but imitate the painful husbandman,
who sowes his seed in the ground, that he may reap it again with advantage in
the harvest, when the earth liberally returns her grateful crop; For admit they
send out of England into East India to the value of 1000 l. in silver, gold, or
both, which there they invest into the Commodities of that Country, as
Indicoe, Spice, Callicoes, Saltpeter, Drugs, etc. And when the said
Commodities do arrive in England, which cost the Company the said 1000 l. in
probability they may yield here about 2000 l. clear of all charges, which the
said Company or other Merchants that buy that Commodity of them do send into
Spain (in time of Peace,) Italy or other Countries, (for England cannot spend
all that they bring in,) and when the said Commodities are there sold;
peradventure the said 2000 l. worth may yield about 3000 l. ready money, which
from thence has been usually brought into England for returns in specie, so
that instead of the 1000 l. transported about 3000 l. is imported, and so
proportionably for a greater or lesser sum, to the great profit and advantage
of England, besides the employment of so much warlike shipping as they send
thither, maintaining many trades belonging thereunto, the increase of so many
Mariners as they breed up and employ in that shipping, and the vending English
Manufactures and return of others employing many trades here, and increase of
the revenues and customs. For,

It is presumed that that Nation which has most warlike shipping and
Mariners, will command in chief at Sea, and he that commands the Sea, may
command trade, and he that has the greatest trade will have the most money,
which is of such value, that it does command all worldly things, both in War
and Peace.

In the former, besides the procuring all necessaries thereunto, how many
Garrisons has it opened and relieved? how many battails has it helped to win?
and what secrets has it not discovered out of the inwardest counsels of great
Princes.

In the latter, as it does maintain Commerce, so the want of it does decay it,
as sad experience does manifest in England since there has been so little
left, and so much transported, as may appear by the great payments in Holland
in half crowns, and there, and in France in 20. and 22 s. pieces, that now at
London 20 s. in gold will cost 22 s. in silver, and that little silver that is
remaining and passing in the Countries so clipped and filled, that most of it
wants near a fifth penny in weight.

And as money is the sinew of War, so does it appear to be the life of trade,
all Commodities being valued by it, and in both as useful in the body Politic
as blood in the veins of the body natural, dispersing it self and giving life
and motion to every part thereof, so that the preservation and increase thereof
does speedily deserve the serious and grave consideration of the highest
Authority in England; for as the case now stands, who will import any bullion
into England to coin, when they may have a better price for it in another
Country? and if any be imported, who will sell it to the Mint while it is
lawful for the Goldsmiths, or any other to give a better price for it than
the Mint can, and when the Goldsmiths have bought it, do they not sell it
again to Transporters, or others to work into Manufactures, as gold and silver
spangles, wyre, etc. which is no small consumption yearly in such trades, so
that little is Minted to increase the coins, but on the contrary it is
suspected to be dimininished by culling out the heaviest money to work into
plate and the like Manufactures above mentioned.

By which it may appear that the East India Company have not wasted, but rather
increased the English coins, for they use none of it to transport in any
Manufactures, and if they had sent any so far off, it would not have been had
again so plentifully in the same kind in our Neighbor Countries, as now it is.

But it may be suspected that the common Transporters of Bullion out of
England, do raise this report to keep themselves from suspicion while they
secretly make it their trade to send it away, till it be so near consumed
through want of a fitting course to cause the bringing of it in, and good Laws
to prevent carrying it out, and care in executing them; for how easily may the
intent of many of our Laws of light penalty be abused by any that is resolved
to break them, without they were made more severe, especially in matters of so
great concernment; It being accounted a great scandal to any of credit to
inform against any that breaks them, though it be never so much to the
prejudice of the whole Nation, and if a needy person do it, a small bribe in
hand, with a few fair promises of friendship will easily take him off the
troublesome and chargeable prosecuting for his proportion due to him by the Law
so broken.

And to avoid this charge and danger, how many do purposely employ their
confidents, (who may peradventure be concerned in the same breach) to make or
enter an Information of the matter only, and there cease, resolving not to
prosecute any further, least he endanger his own or his friends safety, and
this may be done before hand only to prevent any that shall really attempt to
inform of it afterward: Besides the practice suspected to be now used to
employ Dutch shipping, as much as ever to bring home Spanish goods, by
colourably making bills of sale of them in trust to the Freighters, to secure
them against the Act for increase of Navigation.

But in a good government of trade these inconveniences may be prevented
according as occasion requires, and restrain that too much freedom in trade by
some desired, which is the way to destroy all trade, and bring in confusion.
For,

As Discipline in Arms, so Government in Trade preserves good Orders, and
prevents confusion, for which purpose Armies are divided into Regiments, Troops
and Companies, Squadrons and Divisions, and to keep them in better order, they
have Bylaws distinct and apart from the standing Laws of the Country, for
which they serve; So in Trade, the Merchants of London trading in several parts
of the World, are divided into several Companies, who respectively have Bylaws
and Orders among themselves for their better Government, in which capacity they
are best able to understand what quantities of Commodities are sent to the
place where they trade, and knowing how much will vent, may accordingly supply
the market at reasonable rates, and modest profit, with so much as is
necessary, That neither by sending too little of English Manufactures, as by
their scarcity to advance the price at too dear a rate, thereby causing the
buyers to learn and endeavor to make themselves of the same kind at a lower
price, or have them from another Country, which may in the end hinder making
them in England, if not totally ruin the trade to that place, Nor by sending
more than can be uttered to clog the market, as in former ages, till prevented,
and so disparage and undervalue the English Manufactures to the Merchants loss
by dishonourably offering them to sale in shops at an under rate, as has
lately happened in Holland, with other inconveniences, since some have taken too
much liberty to interlope in the trade of the Merchant Adventurers Company, And
as their ancient continuance in a thriving condition commends their good Orders
and Government; so the ratifications and confirmations of their privileges by
several Princes and Authorities since their first institution, (not without
much opposition) declares the necessity of their incorporation for their better
Government and venting English Draperies.

But as for foreign Commodities transported, or such native Commodities as are
no where else to be had of the same kind but from England; the more is gained
by them, the more the Merchants are enriched in recompense of their painful
labors, and dangerous adventures, and consequently the whole Nation, for
besides the danger of the Seas, they many ways run great adventures by bad
debts, imbargoes, etc. giving more credit generally in goods to other Nations
than they do to us.

In this the Dutch are a good example to us, who have served almost all Europe
with East India Commodities to their great profit and advantage, having much of
them chiefly in their own hands, as Nutts, Cloves, Mace and Cinnamon, bringing
such quantities home, as by their experience they guess will yearly serve this
Quarter of the World, and feed the Market therewith as their ruling price: And
by their late practice at Bantam, in seizing three English Ships there, with
their loading, peaceably trading thither: It may be suspected they intend to
get all the Pepper also into their own hands, if not the whole East India
Trade, and then we may be weakened by so many Ships and Mariners as may be
employed thither, they well knowing how advantageous that trade may be to us,
being so prudently managed as now it is, that thereby we may be able, not only
to serve our selves with those Commodities, but other Nations also, on as good
terms as themselves.

Moreover the orderly management of Trade by Companies, will make an easier
discovery yearly, which exceeds the Import or Export; which in a confused
trade, nor incorporated, is not so soon discerned; as in the Trade with Spain
at this time, by importing such great quantities of Fruits and Wines at a dear
rate, to the enriching of our Enemies, and exporting so few English
Manufactures (and those sold at a low rate, and which the Spaniards have
prohibited since the Wars) that instead of bringing Bullion thence for returns
from Cales and St. Lucar, it is carried thither, as is suspected, into his
Dominions, to pay for part of those Commodities at Malaga, etc. to the
impoverishment of our selves.

For where the foreign goods imported exceed the native expotted, the balance
must be made up with money transported, or by exchange, which is a loss to the
Nation, not only by the money so transported, but by the want of vent of so
much native Commodities, as should be exported to answer the value of those
imported, which may be compared to a man having an Estate of 1000 l. per annum,
and spends yearly above it.

As the affairs of Princes do alter and change according to time and advantage,
so does the course of trade, and the better to inspect the course of trade;
some Princes in tender care thereof have an Officer residing in their Courts to
give an account yearly thereof, as has been done formerly in England, or so
often as called the^eunto, and as occasion requires, and also to hear
complaints, and move for redress in the Merchants just grievances, making it
his business to intercede for them at convenient opportunities, without making
way by a favorite with a chargeable reward, for where many men are interessed
in one matter, it is often times known to miscarry through neglect, which makes
good the saying, that every man's business, is no man's business.

Besides which, if it be thought fitting that such a Council for trade of
Merchants exercised therein with some Statesmen or Civillians conjoined, as in
my foregoing proposals is described, they may with Gods blessing on their
endeavors regulate and restore trade by preparing and settling (if empowered
thereunto) such fitting remedies for all grievances therein, as may exceedingly
enrich and advantage the whole Nation.

By settling and managing a Bank, not only for the usefulness, but rather
necessity thereof, as is before related, and also to countermine the Dutch in
their governing the price of Exchanges by the power of their Banks, to the
great prejudice of the English, who with a Bank may rule it as well as they.

To hear and have power to determine controversies arising among Merchants in
matters of trade.

To report their opinions whether it be needful to raise the value of the
English coins, equal or above the rate of what they are in our Neighbor
Countries, or contrive other ways to encourage the bringing of them in again,
and set the Mint to work.

To consult about strengthening the Laws against transporting Bullion, English
wool, and Fullers earth, the Law for increase of Navigation, and all other Laws
concerning trade, and put them in effectual execution.

To strengthen the privileges of the respective Companies of Merchants already
established, and if it be thought fit, to incorporate the Merchants trading
respectively into several Countries not yet incorporated.

To find out a way for better vent of raw silk and other Commodities imported,
which much imployes many people besides Silk-weavers, whose Families are much
impoverished for want of employment by the importation of much riboning out of
France since the Peace.

And many other for encouragement of Trade, besides what is before mentioned,
which they may discover to be advantageous to the whole Nation, and do deserve
to be enlarged by a more skilful hand.

Printed at the Authors charge, for the use and benefit of the English Nation,
and to be considered of, and put in execution, as the High Court of Parliament,
in their great wisdoms, shall think meet.
