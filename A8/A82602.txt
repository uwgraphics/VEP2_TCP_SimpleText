A DECLARATION And RESOLVTION Of the Lords and Commons in PARLIAMENT, In Answer
to the Scots Declaration.
THe Lords and Commons in Parliament have with approbation and thanks, received
from the Commissioners of the Kingdom of Scotland, a clear Manifestation of the
respect which the Lords of His Majesty's Secret Council for that Realm do bear
to the welfare and peace of this Kingdom, in the expression of their
Affections, wherein they were pleased to second the desires of the General
Assembly of that Church for Unity in Religion, and Uniformity in Church
Government in His Majesty's three Kingdoms: And having often had that matter in
debate, and our most serious consideration; the Christian Advice of that
Reverend Assembly, and the grave Council of that Honorable Table concurring
with our own Judgment, and Experience of the manifold mischiefs and
distractions which the Government of the Prelacie of this Kingdom has in all
Times and Ages produced in this Church and State, Have moved us to bring our
Resolution to a more speedy maturity and conclusion; wherein, as we have
satisfied our own Reason, so we hope we shall satisfy the loving and Christian
desires of our Brethren of Scotland; Although we know that hereby we shall
exceedingly irritate that opposite and malignant Party who will bend all their
Invention and Force to interrupt this Work, and to ruin and destroy us in the
undertaking of it.

And we desire their Lordships to consider that the Party which has now
incensed and armed His Majesty against us and His other faithful Subjects in
this Kingdom, is the very same which not long since upon the very same design
of rooting out the Reformed Religion, did endeavor to begin that Tragedy in
Scotland; which, whenever it shall be perfected in either Nation, will easily
be accomplished in the other; Religion being the Band and Foundation of the
safety and happiness of both. And as we resolve, according to the National
Command betwixt the two Kingdoms, to be careful of the peace of Scotland as of
our own, so we doubt not but their Lordships and the Nation of Scotland will be
careful to express their Brotherly kindness to us, and prudent care of
themselves, by restrayning the evill-affected amongst them, that they may not
foment our troubles; and by all clear ways, according to the Articles ratified
in the Parliaments of both Kingdoms, to maintain the Peace and Amity betwixt
the two Nations, and to restrain the mischievous attempts and practices of
those who are enemies to both; that so, through Gods blessing, we may mutually
rejoice in one another happiness, and yield his Majesty such a faithful
subjection, as may be honorable to himself, comfortable to his People,
advantageous to the Professors of the Reformed Religion in other parts beyond
the Seas.

WE the Lords and Commons in Parliament assembled, having with much contentment
perused the brotherly and Christian Answer, which the General Assembly of the
Church of Scotland have made unto the Declaration formerly sent unto them from
us; And finding therein great expressions of love to this Church and Kingdom,
and of prudence and faithfulness in propounding those things which may conduce
to a more close and firm union of the two Churches and Nations of England and
Scotland, in preserving and maintaining the truth and purity of the Reformed
Religion, not only against Popery, but against all other superstitious Sects
and Innovations whatsoever; Have thereupon resumed into our consideration and
care, the matters concerning the Reformation of Church government and
discipline, which we have often had in consultation and debate since the
beginning of this Parliament: And ever made it our chiefest aim, though we
have bin frequently interrupted, and powerfully opposed in the prosecution and
accomplishment of it.

And however we continue still in the storm and conflict, finding small
abatement of difficulty, and much increase of malignity and perverseness in the
opposition, wherewith this great and necessary work of Reformation is
incountred; Yet we heartily thank God and rejoice with our Brethren of
Scotland, for that Peace, Liberty, and preservation which God has afforded
them, taking it as a pledge and earnest of the like mercy intended to us in his
good time, and hoping that he will not only free us from the most grievous and
distructive miseries and calamities of a Civil War, but graciously perfect our
designs and endeavors of a full Reformation in all matters appertayning to
Religion, which as it is the greatest honor and service which God receives
from his people; so we acknowledge with our brethren that it is the surest
foundation of glory, strength, and happiness, which he bestows upon any
Nation.

The manifold obstructions and impediments which we have met with in seeking
this great blessing, do give to us and all Gods People, great cause of grief,
and works in us an earnest longing for the removal of them: Yet knowing that
all the wonderful works of God in this kind have bin brought to perfection,
through many oppositions and seeming impossibilities, that so the conclusion
might be more glorious to His divine Majesty, and comfortable to his children,
we cannot but in humility and submission expect the like issue of our
wrestling, and striving with that fierce and peremptory opposition which has
been framed, and acted against us by the most subtle and busy engines of
Satan, the most pestilent incendiaries among us the Jesuits from abroad, a
virulent and discontented party at home, consisting of the Prelaticall Clergy,
Atheistical projectors against Religion, profane and sensual selflovers,
hightned and inflamed against us, with a spirit of malignity beyond the example
of former times, wherein we have had manifold occasions to discern both our
own weakness, and imperfections, and the Divine mercy and goodness, and to
hope that God having upheld us so long beyond our own strength and merit, will
bring us through at last to the full accomplishment of his own praise, and of
the joy of this and other Churches.

We acknowledge it an act of love to us, and of wisdom for the good of both
Churches, for which we are thankful both to God and them, that our Brethren
of Scotland have bestowed their serious thoughts, and earnest desires for Unity
of Religion; That in all his Majesty's Dominions there might be one confession
of Faith, one directory of worship, one public Catechism, and one form of
Church-Governement. And although it will hardly be obtained punctually and
exactly, unless some way might be found for a mutual Communication, and
Conjunction of Council and debate in framing that one form: yet both
intending the same end, proceeding by the same rule of Gods Word, and guided by
the same spirit, we hope by Gods assistance to be so directed, that we may
cast out whatsoever is offensive to God, or justly displeasing to any Neighbor
Church, and so far agree with our Brethren of Scotland, and other reformed
Churches, in all substantial parts of Doctrine, Worship and Discipline, that
both we and they may enjoy those advantages, and conveniences which are
mentioned by them, in this their answer, in the more strict Union of both
Kingdoms, more safe, easy and comfortable Government of His Majesty, and both
to himself and people, more free Communion in all holy exercises and duties of
worship, more constant security of Religion, against the bloody practices of
Papists, and deceitful errors of other Sectaries, and more profitable use of
the Ministry: for the compassing and attaining whereof we intend to use the
labor and advise of an assembly of godly learned Divines, for the convening of
whom a Bill has already past both Houses, which had taken effect long since,
if we could have obtained His Majestyes Royal assent thereunto. All which
considered, we acknowledge the faithful and affectionate expressions of our
Brethren, in wishing and desiring this great advantage for us, does fully
deserve those thanks which we have formerly expressed, and no whit stand in
need of that apology which they are pleased to make.

The maine cause which hitherto has deprived us of these, and other great
advantages, which we might have by a more close Union with the Church of
Scotland, and other reformed Churches, is the government by Bishops, which to
strengthen it self has produced many other differences in Discipline and
ceremonies betwixt them and us, and is apt to work in the minds of those who
are the approvers and defenders of it, such a disesteeme of, and opposition to
those Churches, as makes us desperate of that most beneficial and desirable
conjunction with them, until this great impediment be removed: whereupon we
have entered into a serious consideration, what good we have received from this
government by Bishops, which may countervaile such a loss and inconvenience,
And we are so far from apprehending any satisfaction herein, that we plainly
perceive it a cause of many other calamities, dangers, and intolerable
burdens, being a dishonor to God, by arrogating to themselves a pre-eminence
and power which he has not given them, by profaning the purity of his
ordinances, with the mixture of their own injunctions, by withstanding the
frequent and powerful Preaching of the Gospel, that so their usurped
authority might receive more easy admittance into the ignorant, and misguided
consciences of men, by corrupting the Ministry with Pride, Ambition,
Covetousness, Idleness and Luxury, by suppressing the spiritual power and
efficacy of Religion, and turning it into formality and Pomp, by inclining to
popery, the principles thereof being suitable to this government, and contrary
to those principles which were the first grounds of Reformation. We likewise
find it most pernicious to the civil state and common wealth, in that the
Bishops have ever been active to infuse into our Kings such Tenants and
Positions, as are contrary to the fundamental laws of the Kingdom, and apt
to introduce Tyranny, and an arbitrarie power over the lives, liberties, and
propriety of the subject, and that they have been forward to incite the King
against his people, and by force of arms to constrain them to submit to such an
arbitrary government. and by unlawful contribution ofmoney to assist his
Majesty in making war upon his subjects whereof there are many evidences both in
those preparations which not long since were made to invade Scotland, and in
the war now raised against the Parliament, and kingdom of England, and yet
they have showed themselves so ambitious of sovereignty, that they forbear not
to maintain in Sermons and printed Books, that the Kings Scepter ought to
submit to Aarons rod, and the Mitre to be above the Sword; which argues in them
an Antichristian spirit to exalt themselves above all that is called God, and a
design (when they have brought the Kingdom to be disposed at his pleasure) to
subject his Majesty to their own arbitrary censures that themselves may triumph
in the bondage and slavery both of King and people. Upon all which and many
other reasons we do declare, That this government by archbishops, Bishops their
Chancellours, and Commiss^ries, Deanes, Deans and Chapters, Archdeacons, and
other ecclesiastical officers depending upon the Hierarchy, is evil and
justly offensive and burdensome to the kingdom, a great impediment to
Reformation and growth of Religion, very prejudicial to the state and
government of this kingdom: And that we are resolved that the same shall be
taken away. And according to our former Declaration of the seventh of February,
Our purpose is to consult with godly and learned Divines that we may not only
remove this but settle such a government, as may be most agreeable to Gods holy
Word most apt to procure and conserve the peace of the Church at home, and
happy union with the Church of Scotland, and other reformed Churches abroad,
and to establish the same by a law which we intend to frame for that purpose to
be presented to his Majesty for his Royal assent. And in the mean time humbly
to beseech his Majesty that a Bill for the Assembly may be pass^d in time
convenient for the meeting to be by the fifth of November next, the miserable
estate of the Church and kingdom not being able to endure any longer delay.

This being the resolution of both Houses of Parliament, we do desire our
brethren of Scotland to concur with us in petitioning his Majesty, that his
Royal authority may be applied to the conservation of a firm unity between the
two kingdoms, and that they likewise will think good to send to the same
Assembly some godly and learned Divines of that Church, whereby an uniformity
in form of Church government may be obtained, and thereby a more easy passage
made to the settling of one Confession of faith, One Liturgy or directory of
the public worship, and one Catechism in all the three kingdoms. Which we
hope through Gods blessing will have such an effect in all his Majesty's
dominions, as will much advance the honor and service of God, enlarge the
greatness power and glory of the King, confirm the peace security and
prosperity of all his good subjects, make way to the relief and deliverance of
the poor afflicted Churches abroad, and to the total abolishing of the
usurpation and Tyranny of Rome, being the prime cause and fountain of all the
miseries and calamities, the bloody massacres, outrages, cruelties, and bitter
persecution of Gods people in all he Christian world for many Ages.

FINIS.
