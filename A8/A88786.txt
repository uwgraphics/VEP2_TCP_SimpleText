A Letter sent from the Archbishop of CANTVRBVRY.
Master Vicechancelor,
And you Gentlemen, the rest of my ancient friends and fellow-Students, God,
whose Judgments are inserutable, before whom the wisdom of the children of
men is but foolishness, has been pleased to lay his afflictions on me with a
heavy hand, glorified be his Name in all his Works; But no one among all the
numbers of my miseries has, or does more afflict me then that I am by my
misfortunes made incapable of serving you and that famous Nurse of good
Letters, your University (of which I had sometimes the honor to be Chancellor)
with that entire zeal and devotion, which my intentions aimed at: man
purposes and God disposes, otherwise had his Almighty Will been concurrent
to my wishes, my endeavors should have rendered Oxford the glory of the
Christian world for good literature; but men's hopes resemble much the Sun,
that at his rising and declension casts large shadows, at noone, when he is
clothed in all his brightness casts little or none at all; when we are
farthest from our expectations, they appear nearest to our hopes: our hopes
feeding our imaginations with the prosperity of our intents, which then approach
swiftly to ruin, like quite spent tapers, that give a sudden flash ere they
extinguish. It was just so with me, who now in stead of all the honors I
possessed, am a prisoner; and so like to continue, and would take it as an
ample testimony of God Almighties mercy to me, were I but assured to carry my
gray hairs down to the grave in peace; but his Will be done, in earth as it
is in heaven, I shall endeavor to make the best of my sufferings, that I may
say with the Psalmist, It was good for me that I was in trouble. And surely I
shall so demean my self toward God, my King, and the Commonwealth in this
my durance, that in my very enemies I shall beget compassion, in you my friends
a hearty sorrow for my miseries, which have taught me that true Dictamen of
wisdom, that I shall advise all, especially you of mine own Calling, the
Clergy, never to meddle with things above your reach, I mean State affairs,
but to devote your selves solely to the service and worship of God, the true
feeding the flocks committed to your charge; for dangerous it is to meddle with
the Council of Kings, especial for those who have professed themselves
Ministers of the Almighty, on whose Laws they ought only to meditate; the
affairs of State being Theaters on which whosoever acts his part, though it
appear to him comicall in the beginning, the end will produce his own
tragedy, if he look not with the greater care to his performance; as it
happened to that most famous Clergie-man of all our Nation, that great
Cardinal Woolsey (whom some in a merry mockery) have ^naptly made my parallel
in dignity and fortune, who laden with disgraces, jam sumus ergo pares, not
long before his departing-minute exclaimed, that if he had served God but with
half that integrity he had done the King, he would not have so deserted him in
his old age. How I have served my King, then whom no man ever had the
happiness to serve a more gracious Master, the world must be my judge, how I
have performed my duty to God of that, my own conscience; nor shall I strive
to give the world satisfaction in that point, only desire them to remember
that divine command; Judge not lest you be judged: howsoever I have demeaned my
self, it is enough I now suffer, without either repining at the Will of the
Almighty, or exprobating mine accusers with the least accusation of malice,
though never man has had so many scandalous abuses cast upon him: none ever
(considering my Calling) having been made so notorious a subject for ridiculous
Pamphlets and Bailads; but it is not I alone that have endured injuries of that
nature, they have fallen with the same licencious petulancy upon my betters,
and I have long since studied that Precept of the Wise man, when a fool
reviles thee, regard him not, and so enough of this matter, and all other; but
the maine cause of my writing to you, impute this needless Exordium to my
humane weakness, which is always prone to tediousness in relation of its
misfortunes, to those it is confident will lament and pity them: An instance
whereof we have in children, who use to bemone themselves to their Mothers and
Nurses, purposely to have them bemone them. But to my business: It is not
unknown to you Gentlemen, nor to me, though darkness and the shadow of death
have even encompassed me round, what Myriads of increasing mischiefs these
times have produced in this languishing and almost expiring Kingdom,
diffencions, wars and blood-sheds, reigning in every place, fellow Subjects,
like the ancien Sword-players, in the Roman Cirques and Amphitheatres,
butchering one another merely for their delight in blood, Fraternus acies
alternaque jura profunis,
De certata odiis,
May fitly be applied to the condition of our now distressed Country, whose
soul is, as it were, divided from the body, and itself only the carcass of
that England it was formerly. The Kings gracious Majesty by fatal fears and
misconstructions being separated from the body of the Commonwealth, the
Honorable the high Court of Parliament; and if any comfort can arrive to make
a man love his misery or take delight in his inthrallment, certainly I have,
that my durance was inflicted on me before this sad and lamentable breach
(which heaven in its great mercy soon knit up) happened betwixt his Majesty
and his Parliament; for, had I been at liberty, and enjoyed the gracious care
of my Sovereign as formerly, surely I had not been to have had that aspersion
cast upon me as the author of this distraction (such a fatality is always
attendent on persons high in the favor of their Prince, to have all the
misfortunes of the Commonwealth inflicted on them, who may be perchance, not
only innocent, but have also endeavored to have diverted from the State those
mischiefs of which they are suspected by some, and by some concluded to have
been the maine incendiaries: and surely I could wish, so my sufferings might
have impeached the impetuous current of the Klngdomes miseries, that I had
undergone a thousand deaths before this dis-junction had fallen out between the
high Court of Parliament and his Majesty, who being, as I am informed, now with
you at Oxford, and intending there to reside, I thought my self engaged in
conscience to intimate my intentions to you, and to give you that counsel,
which if any one had given me in my prosperity, I might, perchance at this
instant, not have been unhappy. I know there are among you diverse of great and
able souls, take heed, I beseech you, lest you pervert those excellent gifts
which God and education has conferred upon you, by intruding your selves into
the affairs of the State, and inverting Religion to advance and cherish the
present distractions. The King is now amongst you, a good and gracious Prince
he is, as ever heaven blessed this Land with, do not you any ends whatsoever,
increase the number of those Malignants, who have given fire to all the Cedars
of Lebanon at once kindled a flame, which in a moment has almost burned up all
the glories of this Kingdom; let neither the disgraces cast on the Clergy by
some factious spirits without the license or patronage of the Parliament,
incense you to cherish the distractions betwixt his Majesty and that honorable
and wise Assembly, nor hope of preferment seduce you to it; for credit me, who
has more experience in such affairs then many of you, though the beginning of
proceedings of that nature may in fair and specious outsides court your
imaginations, their period will be nothing but confusion and bitterness to the
undertakers, as other sins are, which like subtle Panthers, display their
gorgeous spots to entice the traveller to gaze upon them, till the careless
wretches are surely in their reach, and then they assault and devour them. It
is ill going between the bark and the tree, (says the Proverb) take heed of
it; there is as near a relation betwixt the King and his Parliament, and
though they may a while be separated, that violence cannot be long lived; it
will at last conclude in the ruin of those that have caused this separation,
they will be sure to suffer. It cannot be but offenses must come, but woe be to
them from whom they come; mischiefs always meet their Catastraphes in the
destruction of their authors. Since then his Majesty has graciously been
pleased to honor your University and City with his Royal presence, like good
Samaritans, endeavor to power Balm and Oil into the wounds of the
Commonwealth; labor as much as in you lies, to compose these dissensions: it
is your Calling to propagate Peace as well as the Gospel, which is the
testimony of peace, given by the King of Peace to the children of men; you may
inform his Majesty even out of your Pulpits, and boldly, that nothing is more
perquisit to the duty of a Soveraigny than to acquire and advance the good of
his Subjects, which can no way so well and suddenly be effected as by a fair
Accommodation of peace between his Royal Self and his high Court of
Parliament: And as an incitement to mo^^ (...) Majesty to think of it, if
such a wretched man as I be not quite lost to his memory, tender this to him as
the hum^^^ Petition of his unfortunate servant, that his goodness (...)
vouchsafe to reflect on my sufferings, who am impossibili^^^ by his absence of
ever coming to my trial, and so likely to end my days in a prison. But this
only as the least motive, because it is for my self, but further beseech his
Highness from me, to look with a compassionate and tender eye on the
Religion, Nobility and Commons of this unhappy Kingdom, and by a speedy
reconciliation with the honorable the high Court of Parliament at once finish
all their miseries. And lastly, pray you signify to his Majesty, that I lay
my life down in all humility at his Royal feet, beseeching God day and night
for his prosperity, peace and happiness, desiring no longer life for any end,
but this, to see his Majesty, the glory of our Israel, return to his
Jerusalem, all differences attoned betwixt him and his Parliament, which are
the continual prayers of his Highness humblest servant, and your true friend,

W. C.

FINIS.
