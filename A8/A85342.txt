To the Reader.
IN the beginning of these our late troubles and Civil wars, I was imprisoned
by the Justices of the Peace, and Commissioners of Array in Cumberland,
maintaining the Parliamentary Protestations, and opposing the Arbitrary and
Tyrannical Government of our corrupt Magistracy and Ministry there: after a
long and chargeable Imprisonment, I was removed by an Habeas Corpus to London,
and freed by Parliament Authority: but upon my return back into my Country, I
was constrained to undergo a voluntary exile in Scotland, most p^^^ of two
years, even till the reducement of that Country to obedience of Parliament;
hoping to have found such placed in Authorities there, as had been of approved
Integrity, and men hating Covetousness.

I returned to my Country, but contrary to my expectations, finding the Militia
and Authorities there, settled in the hands of such as were the sworn and
professed enemies of the Kingdom: I and some other exiles for the Parliaments
cause, by certain Propositions represented our grievances, and made known to
the Parliament Commissioners how the Militia and Authorities with us were
entrusted to declared Traitors; but the Parliament Commissioners would not
redress our grievances: Afterward Mr Osmotherley and I, were sent to London,
to petition the Parliament, in the behalf of the well affected of Cumberland
and Westmerland: after we had attended the Parliament some four months, upon a
false report of the Chairman of the Committee, I was committed to the prison
of the Fleet, by an Order of the house of Commons, where I have been prisoner:
yet in all that time, could I never have access unto Justice. During my
restraint here, reading the History of the Netherlands, I found the rise and
growth of the wars and troubles of those Provinces, was not so much from the
dissenting Opinions in matters of Religion; as from pride and covetousness of
the King of Spaines evil Counselors, and worser Ministers of Justice; who
under a counterfeit zeal and pretext of settling Church Government, abusing
this their Princes favor and their authority, went about to lay a foundation
of their own greatness, in the ruins of the people, and to enrich themselves
by impoverishing and subjecting those Provinces to their lawless wills and
Tyranny: and the more easy to bring that people under their Iron yoke, they
set up the Spanish Inquisition, where-from to free themselves, they were
constrained to take up Arms in defense of themselves, and for preservation of
their almost overthrown Liberties: but finding no reconciliation could be had,
relying upon the equity and justice of their cause, by public Edict, did
declare the King of Spain to be fallen from the Seignory and authority he had
in and over those Provinces; a good crution for Princes by oppression not to
lose the affection of their people. In France a fire was kindled, which the
blood of millions could not quench, till free exercise of Religion was granted.

The bloody wars, and fearful massacres and cruel murders in Germany upon the
denying the Protestants there their Liberty, were so great and many, as the
same endangered the utter devastation of that great Empire.

If we take a view of the hot persecutions of the Popish Prelates here in
England, in Queen Mary's days: we shall find the same, the very cause and
grounds of those severe Laws enacted by her sister, against Papists and their
Priests: our late Bishops and their Clergy, were so puffed up with pride, as
they could not be contented with their great Lordships, and large dominions,
without they might Lord it over the Consciences of others, which proved to be
their ruin, and now they be cast out with shame, as an abominable branch.

Our New Presbyters, who so cried down their Fathers the Bishops, and
proclaimed against them for their cruelties, and in forcing men to a blind
obedience, Are they more moderate? Nay, These our pretended Reformers, since
they have been backed by Authority, and set up their great Idol,
Kingdomes-deviding, breaking Covenant, by this new forgery, they endeavor and
threaten to enslave all men to their lawless lusts. Do they not cry out, No
Covenant No Parliament; as the Prelates did, No Bishop No King; every Parish
Priest more Lording it, then any Prelate ever did, surely their destruction
will be sudden, if they longer persist in these Godless courses: with our
Priests, our new State Politics comply; by this new devised Covenant: they to
hold up their faction, have cast off, or kept out of all place and office such
as be conscientious or honest; but left their Fathers the Prelates in case
ever should recover their former power and credit should condemn them in their
convocation house, for Heretics, these pretenders and great Reformers, as they
retain their old Names and Offices of Parsons and Vicars, so are they zealous
observers and maintainers of the old Popish Ceremonies, as swearing upon a
Book, ringing of Bells for the dead, sermons, reading and praying for and over
the dead, which to do, their dear brethren of Scotland do abhominate, having
rejected the same as Antichristian: But left any should think what I have said
touching our Covenanting Magistracy and Ministry to be out of disaffection to
their Cause, and not of Truth; I know that the great masters of this City, who
so cry up the Covenant, will not admit any the freedom thereof,
notwithstanding they have served seven years for the same, without submitting
to Book-swearing: the other day the Major and Chamberlain of this Metropolis
put back and denied one his freedom because be would not take the Freemans
Oath upon a book: Depositions of witnesses are now disalowed and rejected by
our new Reforming Justices, without the same be sworn upon a Book, as I can
prove: These our Reformers do they not discover how ready they will be to face
about, and willing to bow again under the Episcopal yoke, by their continuing
the Statutes in force, for not repairing to the Book of Common Prayer, the
English Mass (as the Scots calls it:) for not repairing to the Common Prayer
Book, 34. persons in Cumberland, at Midsomer Sessions last, were indicted by
Order of our Parliaments Justices there: In Yorkshire the 15. of June, 1647. Mr
Worsley had his Oxen and Cowes taken from him for his recusancy in not coming
to the Common Prayer Book, yet Papists in both these Countries are tolerated
and protected. Let Scotland beware whiles they contend for Conformity, they
again set not up our English Dagon: but passing by formalities, let both
Kingdoms secure their own Peace, by yielding to public liberty and exercise
of Religion without making search of their friends Consciences, which no force
can master, but exulcerate rather, and make worse, as (Courteous Reader) thou
may well discover by this ensuing discourse of Mr Baldwin, delivered to the
King of Spaines own hand, which I have published for thine and my Countries
peace, and how we ought to behave our selves toward men of different
Judgments and Religions. For a Conclusion I give thee an exemplary act of
Justice done by a Popish Earl upon a covetous and corrupt minister of Justice:
If our Parliament thereby would be stirred up so to punish their Delinquent
Committee men and wicked Judges; injustice and oppression would stand afar off,
Justice depresse those factions which other, wise will break this Nation, whose
welfare as my own I desire.

A DISCOVRSE OF Francis Bavvdvvine, Showing the means to prevent the troubles
of a Kingdom; and to root out Sects and Heresies.
Delivered at a Conference to the King of SPAIN, Anno MDLXV.
ALL men which live under one King, are bound to seek the preservation of the
public good and quiet, History of the Netherlands, written Anno 1609, in folio
356.
and the entertainment of the Kings greatness and prosperity, who is the Head
of the Body, whereof we are members. I have thought that I am not to be taxed
of arrogancy, if (according to the small Talent which I have received from the
Lord) I endeavor to discourse briefly of the means that might be held in these
times, in the which there is such great diversity of opinions: To prevent all
troubles and tumults that many arise, as we have learned by the example of our
Neighbors; and withal, satisfy (as much as is possible) the will and pleasure
of the King our Lord, whom by Gods law and commandment wear bound to obey and
serve to the uttermost of our powers: seeing then as well here, as in France,
England, Scotland, and Germany (although there be some small difference) a
great part of the people are moved by exhortation and doctrine of those which
they call Gospellers: (for that as they say, they make profession to receive
nothing but what is expressly contained in the Doctrine of the Gospel, and of
the Bible) rejecting the ancient and accustomed manner of serving God; as to go
to mass, to confess, to receive the Sacrament, fast for certain days, go on
pilgrimages, and other like exercises; to join themselves to a new Doctrine and
Religion, which they call Reformed. The question is, how (according to the
Kings will and pleasure) the people may be maintained in the ancient Faith,
without seeking any innovation; and if happily the means seems somewhat
difficult, or rather impossible, how we may prevent and shun many
inconveniences which may arise or grow by the diversity that is among the
Inhabitants of the Country.

First, We must consider when any one speaks of a Religion or Law, it is to
be understood that he speaks of the Faith and apprehension which men have
conceived and imprinted in their hearts and minds, touching God and his
service; and also touching the doctrine of their salvation: Or else they
comprehend not by this word Religion, but the exercise and outward profession,
by the which we show outwardly what we believe inwardly, or (at least) what we
should believe in our hearts. As for the first, It is most certain that they
which follow the new Religion, have a constant persuasion and impression in
their hearts, that what they do and believe, is conformable to the word and
commandment of God; and they must above all things obey their Creator, and
rather endure death, and all the torments of the world, then willingly to go
against his Word and commandments: Seeing then this maxim is graven in the
hearts of men, It is more then reason that God our Creator prescribe us what
law he please, and we are bound to obey him without any contradiction or
exception whatsoever: which maxim is not possible to root out of their hearts,
neither were there any reason to attempt it. There must then some other means
be sought to divert them from their faith; Many have thought it best to proceed
by force and terror; by fire, flames, and all sorts of torments; to the end
that those which have not yet embraced this faith, might by this means be
terrified, to remain in their ancient manner of doing: but doubtless they are
much abused, as reason and daily experience does teach; for how is it possible
to force and command the Conscience and mind by corporal violence? How can any
one persuade me that that man has a bad faith, whom I see die constantly and
joyfully, although I know not the ground of the one not the other? Even as it
is impossible for all the Monarchs of the world to keep the fire from
exercising his heat when it encounters an object fit to burn; In like sort it
is as impossible for all men (how mighty soever) to restrain and hinder the
spirit of man from discoursing and judging as he pleases, and not to apply
himself to that which he finds best to agree with his natural impression; the
experience whereof is daily seen: For what has it availed to have put to death
so many poor souls for the faith? whereto have served the fires, gibbets,
scaffolds, tortures, and torments which they have used in France, in England,
yea and in these Countries? Without doubt, neither the power nor authority of
men, nor the sharpness of all the torments in the world avail any thing in this
point. The Kings of Egypt were mighty, but they could never command the
consciences of the children of Israel. The Roman Emperors held almost all the
world in subjection, who neither spared fire nor flames, crosses nor gibbets,
cords nor tortures, nor any kind of torments that could be devised or invented
to root out the Christian faith, and to terrify their subjects, to divert
them, and to retain them in their ancient belief and Pagan Religion; and yet
they prevailed nothing in their designs, but contrariwise did much hinder
their intents: So that the Christians were wont to use a common proverb amongst
them, That the blood of their Martyrs was the seed of their Churches. And
indeed Julian the apostate Emperor, a malicious and subtle man, seeing that to
root out the Christian Religion, all his Predecessors had prevailed nothing,
but contrariwise that it was much augmented by means of the persecutions, and
that those which died for their faith, took it for a glory and honor; from
that time forward he would no more persecute them neither by fire nor sword,
nor by any corporal violence, although they hated him deadly; but sought by
gentleness and persuasions to draw them from their Faith; and forbearing all
outward violence, he sought by all policy to hinder their increase; wherein he
prevailed much more; for that some through covetousness, others through
ambition, suffered themselves to be persuaded to that whereunto they could not
be forced by any violence or threats. I will not compare here this new kind of
Doctrine, (which is now in question) with the Pagan Religion, (for it is not my
intention to interpose my censure) but I will only conclude, that in that
which consists in the persuasion of the heart, corporal violence prevails
no more then the vapor of wind that blows, to hinder the heat of the fire: And
daily experience has taught us.

The means then to divert them from their opinions, is to persuade them that
their faith and belief is not conformable to the word of God: To effect the
which, there is no other means then to give them free audience; to the end,
that they may propound their reasons and motives with all liberty, and that
they be confuted of error and herefie by the Word of God: If they remain
obstinate, yet when this disputation and instruction shall be performed in the
eye of the World, those that are weak shall by this means be persuaded not to
follow their errors; for as for the obstinate, even as instruction would avail
them little or nothing, so much less would fire or death turn them from their
resolved opinions. But on the other side, those which behold others to die with
such constancy, take a delight to seek the opinions; and they which by this
means came to fall in the like inconveniences, should be wholly preserved, when
they should hear them vanquished by the word of God, and by reasons which they
cannot contradict. If then Prelates and Bishops trust in the bounty of their
cause (as with all reason they ought) There is not in the world a better means
to attain unto the Kings intention, and to prevent the multiplying of Sects,
then to confer together publicly; that all the world may know, that the others
do falsely bragg, that they have the word of God on their side; for it is most
certain, that when truth is compared with falsehood, she must of necessity show
her beauty, and obtain the Victory; discovering to the eye of all men, what is
false and counterfeit; and by this means a great good shall rise; for that they
which now know not what to follow in so great a diversity of opinions, may
settle a firm judgment of the Truth, after that they have heard the grounds of
either side; so as in conference all confusion and disorder, all noise and
railing be laid aside.

As we have seen in the disputations and conferences which Saint Paul has
made, as well with the Jews as against the Pagans; then presently those which
sought the truth, knew that he had reason, and that the other were in error:
so in the Councels of Nicene, the Arrians were admitted to propound their
reasons and grounds with all liberty; and being convicted by the word of God of
error and heresy, were forced for a time to desist from their enterprise: but
presently after when they presecuted them, they had many disciples; some moved
by pity, some by their false persuasions; the which was the cause of great
mischiefs and inconveniences in the Church: Yea, in our time, we have seen in
all places where the Anabaptists have been persecuted, they have increased
infinitely: And contrariwise, where they have been heard in public conference
and disputation, and convicted of error and heresy, by the word of God, they
have had no more tredit in the world; And therefore Mabomet has so carefully
forbidden that they should never dispute upon the points of Religion brought in
by him; knowing well, that the truth being once confronted against his lies,
his doctrine of necessity must go to smoke. Its a true mark, and a badge of
truth, that it desires to be known, made manifest, and debated; being like unto
the Palm tree, the more it is deprest and charged, the higher and steighter it
grows: For this reason the ancients did appoint to hold free and general
Councels every year; although by the corruption of time many abuses have been
brought in by the ambition and covetousness of those that should give their
Voices: So it is, that the Heretics and Sectaries fear nothing in the World
more, then to be made manifest; be it by a free and general council, or in any
other place, where as matters may be freely debated on either side; the which
we see at this day apparently in the Anabaptists, who fly all disputations more
then death.

If then those which desire to root out this new Religion, which multiplies so
fast, are assured of the bounty and truth of their cause, and of the falsehood
of their Adversaries.

There is no fitter means then to come publicly to field, and to give their
adversaries free audience and leave to dispute: without doubt, if they
maintain herefies, there shall need neither fire nor gibbets to hinder the
course of their doctrine; for that the more manifest it is, the more it will
decay: It will be to no purpose to say that they have been often heard and
confuted; for admit it were so, yet a great multitude of people, which are
inclined thereunto, deserve so much pain, as to be instructed in hearing and
examining their reasons: but when you have said all, they were never heard with
patience; for when as Luther began to preach this doctrine in Germany, it was
presently condemned by the Pope, and persecuted by all the Kings and Princes of
Christendom: he was once called to be heard, but it was to see if he would
recant or maintain his writings and his doctrine: And he on the other side
protested nothing more, then the desire he had to be better taught and
instructed by the holy Scripture. The like proceeding was held against Johannes
Husse, at the council of Constance, who was never heard in his own defense; but
as soon as he was arrived there, they laid before him certain Articles, drawn by
some adversary of his, out of his books, asking him if he would maintain those
Articles, which were reproved and condemned by the holy Church; and thereupon
they gave sentence that he was an heretic, and damned; the which the world
sees to be against all right and reason. To say that those were condemned by
other Councels before, is nothing to the purpose; for if it be so (as they say)
it will be the more easy to overthrow them now; for that the ancients have
never condemned any doctrine, but that which they held contrary to the word of
God; the which they have alleged to that effect: I say, to confute errors and
heresies. So as now the way shall be traced, and they shall need only to quote
the same scriptures to confute these: for that the word of God remains
eternally, and the scripture has now as much force and virtue to confute
heresies as ever. But to condemn them by the very name and authority of some
Councels, without alleging the scriptures, and reasons of the said Councels,
were out of reason; for they submit themselves to prove, that the Councels (by
the which their doctrine has been condemned) were but petty Councels,
assembled and allowed by the tyranny of some who alone have decreed what they
pleased, against the authority of the scriptures, without hearing or admitting
of their adverse parties. And doubtless in the ancient primative Church, there
were many Bishops which have rejected some Councels, as suspect, and not
lawful, nor grounded upon the authority of the word of God, but upon the
authority of men: as we read of Maximus Bishop of Jerusalem, and of St Hillary
Bishop of Poictiers; yea, and of St Athanasias, Chrisestonie, and Photinus; so
it is not without reason, if many ages after them there have been Councels
suspected to these men: But as for the most Ancient and Received on either
side, they are content to allow of them, so far forth as they prove their
sayings by the word of God: There rests then nothing but that their reasons
may be heard, that the truth may be known, and their heresies and errors
avoided; seeing there is no other means to procure a public peace, and to draw
all the subjects to one Religion; that if their adversaries (as if there were
no controversy in this point) challenge the name of the Church, and without
hearing their reasons examined by the scriptures, will that all that they shall
ordain or decree, shall be infallibly kept as an ordinance of the Church, and
so of God; as they have done in the last Council of Trent, where the Pope was
head, and the adverse party not called, but to be condemned and judged
according to the ordinance of the Church (that is to say, of the Pope and
Prelates) or else to recant, and then to be receive into favor: Without doubt
there will be never any means to draw them from their belief, seeing this
Maxim will always remain graven in their hearts; that they must in all
things follow the word of God, which alone has authority to judge all
Controversies, and to define which is the true and the false Church; which
Maxim can never be wrested away by the authority of any man; much less that
the Pope and Prelates, have any such Credit: not by fire nor sword, so as if
their adversaries would not give them free audience, (as it is said) but use
violence: they should but impair their own Cause, and make theirs better and
more favorable whom they seek to root out. Seeing then it is a Maxim or point
resolved upon among all men of Judgment, that touching the Faith and inward
Belief, no Corporal violence can command; and that men must be confuted of
error in their Consciences; we must examine the second point which we have
propounded; which is, Whether it were not possible to hinder the outward
exercise of their Religion, forbidding them to assemble, preach, teach, nor to
make any outward profession of that which they believe in heart.

And first, In it were feasible, whether it were fit and convenient to do it:
No religion whatsoever can subsist, if it has not some exterior exercises or
ceremonies by the which it may be entertained; whereupon the Emperor Gratian
was wont to say, that it was necessary the people should be maintained in some
outward discipline of some Religion, whatsoever it were, good or bad. For as
man by nature is inclined to reject the yoke of God, it is necessary he should
be kept in awe and discipline, else he would be like an untamed horse,
rejecting the fear of God and man.

Being then impossible to root out the Faith which they have in their hearts,
it were not convenient (although it were possible) to hinder their exterior
discipline and exercises, by the which the people are maintained in their
Religion, and in the fear of God, and of the Magistrate, unless (whereas in
their Assemblies they are taught to be good men, and to fear God, and honor
the King and his officers) they will make them wicked Atheists, Libertines, and
seditious, perturbers of all good order and policy; as we see plainly by daily
experience: For we see a number which have cast off the yoke of the Romish
Church, mocking at the Mass and Priests; yet fear to lose their goods or
honors, refuse to apply themselves to discipline and exercise of any other
Religion; have become very Atheists, without faith or law: Yet there are no
small number of villainous Libertines, which make fects of themselves; teaching
that we must not serve God outwardly with any exterior form or discipline, but
only in spirit; and under this pretext, they give themselves to all villainy
and abomination; to murders, rapes, incests, and adulteries; holding that the
outward things serve to no end, so as the heart be clear, as they persuade
themselves.

Yea, some have been so audacious as to vaunt themselves to be Christ himself.
Others, the Spirit of God: And others Charity. To conclude, they are profane
people, and contemners of God and the Magistrate; maintaining that there ought
not to be any sword or superiority used among men, but that the spirit should
rule, govern, and guide the heart of man as it pleases: The which grows
through no other occasion, but seeing the great abuses which have reigned, and
do still reign in the Church; and not being suffered on the other side to join
themselves to any discipline and exercise of Religion; they are grown to that
pass, as to think that dissimulation is not bad, so as the heart be good: and
so mocking at Religion (whereof they make a show) they must needs fall into
wicked Atheism: And there are none in the world more seditious and greater
disturbers of all good order, then these people: as has been seen in the
Anabaptists of Munster, and their like. For the rooting out of which, there
were no better means (whosoever would consider all things without passion) then to
suffer them, yea to command them expressly, that all them which make profession
of the Religion (which they call Reformed) should assemble in view of all the
world, and keep good discipline, fit for the obedience which they owe unto God,
and the Magistrate correcting vices and excess: for although there were no
other good, yet by this means they should get thus much, (which is of great
importance for the preservation of the public quiet) That whereas we daily see
spring up new and abominable sects, full of sedition and mutinies, yea, and of
horrible blasphemies against the Majesty of God; when as there should be but
two public kinds of profession in the view of all the world, either of them
performing the obedience which they owe unto God and the King; when as any new
one should spring up, it would be easy to suppress it by the word of God. But
forasmuch as this seems strange to some to give Heretics leave to sow their
heresies: let us see if it be possible to suppress their assemblies: And
doubtless if we look unto experience, (the perfect mistress of all things) we
shall find it is as impossible to hinder it, as it is impossible to keep them
from believing of that which they think fit and agreeing with the word of God.
Have we not (I pray you) seen the great power of the most victorious Emperor
Charles the fifth (of famous memory, who made all the world to tremble? Have we
not seen his most incredible diligence to suppress this Religion? Have we not
seen the rigorous edicts which he made? and whereto tended it, but to hinder
the preaching of this new Religion; and that they which made profession
thereof, should forbear their Assemblies? For he knew well their hearts could
not be forced; and yet he prevailed nothing, notwithstanding all his
prohibitions: It may be they assembled in some strange Country where they had
greater liberty: No, no, but contrariwise, all the Princes of Christendom
together with the Pope, were resolved to root them out, and to give them no
place of retreat; but all was in vain. How do we then think that the Kings
power (the which out of doubt is not greater then the Emperors) can hinder it?
seeing that now, France, England, Germany, Scotland, and all the Countries
about, are open unto them, to retire themselves, and to use the liberty that is
here denied them; whereas they have so many Kings and Princes on their side;
whereas the number is multiplied by many and infinite thousands; without doubt,
they which gave his Majesty this counsel, show plainly, that either they want
judgment, or else they seek to settle their own greatness, to the prejudice of
the King, and the ruin of the Country; Let them examine all the Histories of
the world, and they shall find, that when any new Religion has been grounded
upon the inward persuasion of the word of God; that all the striving in the
world could never hinder, but the exterior discipline thereof would have its
course.

The Roman Emperors could never force the Jews to receive their Statues into
their Temples; nor hinder the Christians from their Assemblies; who desired
rather to live like savage beasts in caves and rocks, then to abandon the
exercise of their Religion. I will not examine whether their quarrel be like
unto this; so it is, that they are as well persuaded in their hearts that they
follow the word of God, and that they are commanded to assemble and preach, as
they were; which persuasion can never be wrested from them by any violence; for
they say among themselves, that if they should be allowed to believe what they
would, so as they would forbear to teach and assemble; were as much as if they
should suffer a man to live, so as he would take no refection and nourishment:
for they maintain that faith is entertained by the preaching of the word, even
as the life of the body is by the nourishment of meat. But admit it were
possible to forbid their Assemblies; they must proceed either by rigor and
force, or by gentleness and persuasions: that is, they must either corrupt
them, or else force them to do against the testimony of their consciences, and
so falsify their faith which they owe unto God. It is most certain that the
constant and virtuous will rather choose a thousand deaths, then to do any
thing against their Consciences; so as with them there were nothing to be
gotten. As for the rest who for fear or hope would deny their faith; First,
they should grievously offend the divine Majesty, and damn their own souls by
this falsehood and dissimulation, for that they should sin doubly: first to have
embraced the error, and afterward more to have falsified sified their faith
and testimony of their Conscience, and to have dealt doubly; whereas God
requires sincerity and plainess: so as they that should force them thereto,
should be the cause of their more grievous damnation. They then which counsel
the King to force or corrupt his subjects, to the end that they should
dissemble and make show of any other Religion then that which they believe in
their hearts, are the cause of the disloyalty which they commit against God and
the King; for without he shall carry himself disloyally to God either for fear
or hope; it is to be presumed that by the same passions he will carry himself
as disloyally unto the King, when as time and occasion shall be offered.
Constantius father to Constantine the Great, although he were a Pagan, yet he
called Christians into his Court, and admitted them to favor, whom he did see
ready to abandon goods and honors, yea their own lives; rather then to be
disloyal unto the God whom they did worship; yea, he held them worthy of his
friendship, and did impart unto them most of his important affairs. And
in-truth the King has no Subjects more faithful then those which obey him for
Conscience; that is to say, because God has so commanded it: they which
falsify their conscience to please the King, or for any other private respect;
show that they do not obey the King for Conscience only, but for some other
particular affection: and if they make no difficulty to falsify their
Consciences in the service of God, without doubt it is to be feared that when
any passion or affection should move them, either the fear of death, or the
loss of goods and credit, or some such like thing; they would make no great
difficulty to falsify their faith which they owe unto their King: so as they
which give this Counsel unto the King, show their ignorance; for that they seek
to root out them which in simplicity and sincerity of heart yield obedience
unto God and the King. And as for those which proceed disloyally and against
their Consciences, they are not only content to suffer them, but also to
advance them unto honor: as we have seen by some examples of those, who
(before having made profession of this Religion) have afterward without being
condemned of error, only to aspire to honor and credit, turned their Coats.

To conclude, Although it were a thing possible to force or corrupt the
Protestants to abandon their Religion, and to do against their Consciences;
yet were it not expedient for the good of the Common weal. But as I said, It is
not possible to hinder them, unless they will ruin them, and put them to
death, the which were hard to compass; for in the place of one (they should
put to death) ten others wouldrise: and those which die so constantly, (rather
then remove their faith,) are held for good men, by the common people, who have
more regard to the constancy, then to the cause which they maintain: whereupon
they have desire to examine the Cause, and come to fall into the same opinions;
so as this must needs cause them to multiply and increase: wherefore they that
advise the King to this means, are much abused; for besides that they frustrate
his Majesty's intention, they thrust the Country into great desolation, and
almost apparent danger of a ruin, yet it is plainly to be seen, that the
Arts, Occupations and trades, by means whereof this Country was wont to
flourish above the rest, do now decay, and are transported to their neighbors;
the ancient enemies to the house of Burgoign and Austria.

It is almost incredible what prejudice the persecutions have brought within
these forty years to the making of Cloth, and Says, and Tapestry: which
trades being (as it were) proper and peculiar to the Netherlands; they have
chased away by this means to the French, English, and other Nations: I forbear
to speak of an infinite number of other good and profitable trades, which are
retired into foreign Countries, to enjoy the liberty (...) ^^eir Consciences:
For in general, all the trafique of Merchandise has been wonderfully
interessed, (as many good men can witness) In Antwerp, Lillee, Torney,
Valenciens, and other such Towns: and this has been one of the chief
occasions why of late years the English have been persuaded to leave Antwerp,
and go to Embden; that is to say, from the flower of all Merchants towns,
full of infinite Commodities; to a petty Town, (obscure, and of no
commodity:) Yea, they are grown so proud, by reason if this Drapery (the
spoils of his Majesty's Netherlands) as they seem to have no care to
compound; thinking that we have more need of them, then they of us. The French
in like sort bragg, that they are clothed with our spoils, by reason of the
Merchants that are fled for Religion: so as that which did serve them as a
bridle, to bring them the sooner unto reason, in time of war, will now make
them more proud and untractable.

Besides, It is well known, that within the Country there be many sufficient
Merchants, which (upon this occasion) refuse to contribute in time of
necessity; fearing that this question of religion, will be a subject unto their
enemies, to make them confiscable.

But above all, It is to be considered, That the profession of Arms and War,
(which has been flourishing in these parts) has, and will be greatly
interessed, (if it be not other ways prevented) I will not speak of many
Gentlemen, good and faithful subjects, which might do good service to his
Majesty, which are now retired to their houses; fearing for this only
occasion, to employ themselves in any occasion whatsoever. Neither will I say,
that many others, who desired to do the King good service (yea, even of those
which knew the seats and scituations of Countries) are forced to leave their
native soil, and to retire to their enemies; prefering the liberty of their
Consciences, before all things in the world.

Without doubt there must a care be had; for if any war should happen, either
against the English, French, or any other neighbor Country; we know not whom
to trust: and without doubt, the enemies will not forget to make their profit
upon (...) occasion, by all manner of practices; to the great prejudice of his
Majesty, and all his Country: and it is to be feared, that among so many men,
there will be some, which (under color to seek their Liberties) will be
persuaded to attempt some Innovations.

The desire to live, and serve God in Liberty of Conscience, is of so great
force, as it makes men forget all other affections and passions, how vehement
soever, for it not only makes the subject neglect the duty which he owes to
his natural King and Prince, but it does even estrange the hearts, and
withdraw the affections of Fathers and Mothers from their Children; yea, it
makes them forget themselves: so as they make no difficulty to expose their
bodies to the burning flames, and to all sort of torments, and to abandon wife
and children, leaving them nothing but poverty and famine, rather then to lose
this good, in regard whereof, there is nothing in this world that they esteem.

So that it is no wonder (which some report for a truth) that many among the
Gascoignes and Provencials, (during the persecutions in France, for matter of
Religion) have treated to yield themselves tributary to the Turk, hoping that
by that means, they would suffer them to live in liberty, (which they valued
above all things, and it may be they had put it in execution (to the great
prejudice of all Christendom) if one only respect had not restrained them,
which was, that they held it too grievous, to give their first borne children
to the great Turk, to be bred up in Mahomet's Religion: for this affection is
incredible, and exceeds all others: the which being well considered (with the
great diversity of humors and conditions of men: it were no strange thing, if
in so great a multitude of them that are persecuted for their Conscience, some
should be found more sudden or more revengefull or impatient then the rest,
who would make no, difficulty to attempt such exploits: yea, if it were but to
revenge the grievous wrongs and injuries that were done for that Cause unto
their kinsfolks and friends; wherein it is greatly to be considered, that there
are no forts nor castles that maintain Kings in their greatness, so much as
the faithful love of their subjects: So contrariwise, the King does but
provoke their hatred against his Majesty: yea, who otherwise are good and
wel-governed men, and live without reproach.

If the Inquisitors and their adherents, fear not the Hugonots, for that (as
they say) they have not the wit to revenge themselves, who maintain, that they
must do good for evil, yet they may well have heard the common Proverb, that
patience too much urged, in the end turns to fury: And if they be not void of
all sense, they must think, that all the Kinsfolks, friends, and allies of
them that they persecute, are not of one mind, and equal patience, that they
can so easily pass over the wrong which they think they have received: so
although there were no danger they should attempt any thing against his
Majesty, or his estates; yet will they carry an irreconcilable hatred against
his Officers; whereby there will grow bad intelligence amongst his subjects;
which is a matter (as every man knows) of very great importance: as we may
well see by the troubles of France, the which partly took their beginning from
such occasions; and it is most manifest, that if King Henry, or his Father,
King Francis, had in their times granted free exercise of Religion,
(restraining them with good Laws and Ordinances) without doubt, they had left
their Realm much more happy and flourishing, and had prevented so many
calamities which have ensued.

I know there is some will say, the like is not to be feared here, considering
the small numbers there is; and therefore it were no reason, that for a
handful of men, and of the baser sort, they should bring in any innovation.

But they that use such speeches, discover their gross ignorance, or their
unsupportable malice: If there be any question to give assistance to the
Inquisitors, to install the new Bishops, or to send Garrisons into any Towns;
then can they say, except they use extreme rigor, and great diligence, it will
not be possible to maintain the ancient Religion; Importuning the Court, with
their continual complaints, how wonderfully the Heretics do multiply.

But if there be any question to find some mild and fit course to settle the
Countries quiet, without any great effusion of blood; then they say, there are
so few Hugonots and of so base quality, as nothing ought to be altered for
them: So as any man may easily see, that their intent is to maintain themselves
only in their greatness, were it with the total ruins of his Majesty's
Countries: and they that do earnestly affect the Kings greatness, and the
preservation of his subjects, much reject them, as partial, and suspect; and
make diligent information and search of the number, quality, and sufficiency of
them that desire to be the Kings faithful subjects, so as they may satisfy and
enjoy their consciences; and without doubt you shall find a greater number then
is generally believed: let them look to the multitude of those that are retired
into England, where they have their public Assemblies in infinite number; then
let them turn unto those that are gone into France, in as great numbers: from
them let them number up them that are at Franckfort, Straesburgh, Hiddelburgh,
Franckendal, Collen, Aix, Dousburgh, Embden, Geneva, Hamburgh, Breme, and other
Towns of the East Countries; without doubt (in my opinion) they shall find an
hundred thousand; and as for those which remain yet in the Country, it is most
manifest there are many more. There has sometimes been seen at an assembly or
preaching at Tournay, four or five thousand persons; the like has been known
at Valencien; beside those that have remained secretly in their houses; else
the Garrisons had been needless which have been sent thither, if the multitude
had not been so great: It is thought that Lille has not many less; whosoever will
look into the petty Towns and neighbor Villages, shall undoubtedly find an
infinite number: come into West-Flanders, the numbers are wonderful great,
notwithstanding any pursuit or search which the Dean of Rennay has made. Have
we not seen at Missennes (as I remember) seven or eight hundred Countrymen
force the Prison, and deliver a Prisoner, and they could never discover who
they were? I leave Eand, Brugges, and Yperen, in which notwithstanding are good
numbers. What multitudes meet together at Antwerp is apparent; and at Brussels
where the Court remains, yet can they not by any means keep them from
assembling themselves together in good numbers. What shall I speak of the
Countries of Holland, Zeland, Gelderland, and Friesland? where it seems they
have greater liberties: and in truth, the officers dare make no more searches
nor executions, by reason of the great numbers. Have we not seen at Vtrecht, an
Episcopal Town, and full of rich Chanons, one called Thijs or Stephen, preach
this doctrine publicly, for the space of a whole year, in the view of the
whole world, in despite of all such as did oppose themselves; and
notwithstanding all their pursuit, yet could they never apprehend him, for that
all the people did accompany him-both going and coming out of the Church, so
that sometimes he was carried upon their shoulders; and lodges sometime in one
house, sometime in another? whereby we may see, that the number is not so small,
as some maintain: Yea, they complain that they cannot furnish them with
Ministers and Preachers enough. Without doubt, if they were gathered together
in one place, as well those which are retired, as they which remain; there
would be found at least two or three hundred thousand: if they will have
respect to them that are of the same opinion and dissemble, attending some
change or fitter opportunity; I do certainly believe that all joined together,
would equal the number of the rest, so that they which maintain that the number
is so small, and that for them they should not alter nor change any thing; show
that they have no sense nor judgment, or else that they would reign alone in
the world.

Whereas they say that they are all people of a base condition; The contrary
has been seen in Germany, France, England, Scotland and Denmark; whereas not
only the common people, but also Princes and Kings have embraced this
Religion: and doubtless if they might discover themselves without danger of
life and goods, they should also find here a great number of Gentlemen, and
others of good sort, that would declare themselves to be of their party; but
although the number were not so great, yea if there were but very few, yet it
were befitting the clemency of a King, to have regard unto the health of the
meanest of his subjects. The Emperor Trajan was wont to say, that he had rather
save one Citizen and subject, then defeat a whole army of his enemies; a speech
worthy of a Monatch and Emperor: such then as think they should not spare to
ruin (as much as in them lies) the bodies and souls of the Kings poor
subjects, show themselves ignorant what Christianity, Humanity, or the Clemency
of a King means or requires; the very name whereof, makes his fame more
glorious than all the trophies and victories that he could obtain of his
enemies.

But they will say that these men are wicked and profane, and that they
corrupt the rest: whereunto I answer, that the point of Religion only
excepted, whereon it is not my intention here to judge; you shall find that
they are otherwise good men, fearing God, yiedling obedience to the King and
Magistrate, and doing wrong to no man; although there be some that cover
themselves with their name, and are not so: the which happens for that they
are not suffered to have the exercise of their Religion as they would: and as
for the point of their Religion, let it be what they please: but so it is, they
are not all persecuted so much for that they follow heresy and error; but for
that they are constant and faithful in that which they think conformable to the
word of God: for they suffer them to believe what they please (which indeed
they cannot hinder) so as they will be disloyal, and hypocrites; and seeing they
submit themselves to be instructed by the word of God, there is no reason to
esteem them so wicked: Moreover, we must in despite of our selves confess, that
the greatest and best wits, and the most learned men maintain their party; I
will not disgrace the others, but if we will lay by all favor and affection,
we shall find, that the most excellent wits have been and are of their
profession: Yea, the restoration of Arts and Sciences (which were buried in
darkness) is come from them; the knowledge of the Tongues, especially of the
Greek and the Hebrew, has been beautified more by them then by any others. To
conclude, their adversaries themselves are forced to confess, that there are
fingular men among them in all sort of sciences: besides that the life of many
of them is it reprehensible. If then there were not so great a number as there
is, yet they should have respect not to ruin and chase away those whom God
has endued with such excellent graces; and deprive the King and his Countries
of so great a good, in chafing away or murdering them which might have served
either for Counsel, Learning, or some other way; seeing it is ordinarily found,
that they desire to yield all obedience and duty unto the King, and to serve
him with body and goods, so as they would leave them the exercise of their
Religion free.

To conclude then, If his Majesty will be pleased to grant this liberty, he
should not only prevent troubles and inconveniences which have happened in
France, and elsewhere, through this occasion, but also it should be a means by
the which his subjects should be induced every one to employ himself in his
vocation, to the service of his Majesty, and the advancement of the
Commonweal; seeing that in the end they should be forced to come unto it, were
it after his decease; as in other Countries where the like accidents have
happened.

It remains now to consider the inconveniences that may arise, the which I find
to be two principal: The first, that if the exercise of their Religion were
allowed them, they might multiply in such sort, as the ancient Religion would
decay, and come to nothing; the which the King would not endure by any means.
The other is, They hold commonly that in one Country there cannot be two diverse
Religions, without great trouble and disorder.

As for the first, they must understand that all Religions are either grounded
upon the authority of God, or the authority of men: For a Religion may be
grounded upon the authority of men, when having regard unto that which our
Ancestors have done and followed, or to that which our King commands, or to
that which some great personage does enjoin us, we ground our Religion upon
those respects, without any firm reason, or feeling in our hearts, that we do
well or ill: as the Turks, Pagans, and Idolaters have always done; yea and the
greatest part of the world do at this day; changing their Religion and manner
of serving God, in what sort, and as often as it shall please the King, or
those to whom they shall defer this credit: but for that those Religions
proceed not from a Religious heart fearing God, but from the respect and
reverence of men, it is easy to hinder the course, and to plant in other by
humane means; as by arms and violence: so as it was no difficult thing for the
Romans to bring their Gods and Religions into Greece, and other Countries of
their conquests, the which were grounded but upon the authority of their
Princes and Kings. But if the Religion has its foundation upon the authority
and word of God, upon the testimony of their Consciences, be it with reason or
otherwise; force or outward violence cannot prevail; as we have showed; and
there is no means to hinder the course and progress thereof, but in showing
the foundations ill laid. If then the King will maintain the old Religion, and
stop the course of the new, it is necessary that he give them leave to be
heard; to the end that they may be confuted; and that all the world knowing
wherein the abuse does consist, may fly their acquaintance: If it be heresy
they sow, ye cannot but stop the course in suffering them to publish their
doctrine, so that their errors be laid open to the people by the truth of the
word of God; else the more you seek to suppress it, the more it will increase.
But contrariwise, if happily their doctrine be conformable to the word of God,
it is not to be presumed that his Majesty would oppress it. Wherefore that
inconvenience alleged, is of no consequence.

The second point alleged, seems to be of great moment: For they say commonly,
that for to entertain the public quiet, we must have but one Law, one Faith,
and one King: a thing without doubt which were much to be desired, for it would
us liken to that golden age. But seeing that Religion and faith is a mere gift
of God, engraven in the heart of man, over the which none can command but God
only: It were great indiscretion to think it possible to reduce all the
Inhabitants of one Country to one Faith by force or corporal violence. It is
true that they say that as in a Family the Father ought to foresee that all
those of his house worship but one only God, and be of one Religion; so the
King should provide that in his Realm there should be but one Faith, and one
Law; the which were wonderful good and healthful, but it is not possible to
attain unto it, if it be not among those people whose Religion is grounded upon
the Kings simple Authority; the which is no true Religion, but a mere
hypocrisy and counterfeting, whereunto they may happily be drawn which have no
fear of God: As it was seen among the Romans, who received as many new Gods as
their Emperors commanded them: but this will never take place among them which
have any inward feeling grounded upon any reason, be it upon the word of God,
or of their own Conscience: In which case ye are so far from reducing a whole
Nation to one Religion, as you can hardly reclaim one Family: the which was
manifest among the Jews, where there were three famous Sects more contrary the
one unto the other, then those of the new Religion unto them that maintain
themselves under the ancient obedience of the Pope.

But which is much more from the beginning of the world, unto this day, it was
never seen that all were of one law, and one faith; no not according to the
exterior exercise. For before the coming of Christ, the Kings, of Egypt,
Persia and Babylon, were forced to leave the Jews in their Country, and to
allow them the free exercise of their Religion, the which they held abominable.

And after his coming, the Roman Emperors have also suffered it; as Antonius
Pius, and Mark Antonie, nor that they were of one accord with them: (for they
had the name of a Christian in horror) but for that they found they were not
seditious, nor disturbers of the public quiet; and so of many other Emperors
who have suffered them, and forbidden that no injury should be done them,
although they were of a mere contrary opinion.

True it is, that some one may say, That all these Examples serve but to
advance the Christian faith, which the King intends to maintain, in rooting
out the new Religion.

Yet it is most manifest, It is no new thing to endure two Religions in one
Country, yea, and that all wise Kings and Princes have done according to the
necessities of the time; for although the Religion of those Emperors were bad,
yet they held it good and holy, as the King holds his, and it was the Religion
which they received from their Ancestors, above three thousand years past.

But we find also, that Christian Emperors have endured alse Religions, as
it appears by the example of Theodosius, Horatius, and Arcadius, who gave
Temples to the Arrians and Nova^^^ns, sometime within, and sometime without the
City, as the necessity of the time and place required.

In the Ecclesiastical History, It is reported for a remarkable thing, that
Valentianus the Emperor, was Orthodox, and a good Christian, yet he suffered
the Arrians, though he favored them not so much as the others: Vallens his
Colleague or Companion in the Empire, was an Arrian, and would by no means
suffer the Christians in his Government, but did persecute them in all sorts;
whereby we may easily gather, that in all well-governed commonweals, to avoid
sedition and tumults, it is sometimes necessary to grant Temples unto
Heretics; not to the intent they should disperse their Heresies more, but that
the people hearing ^he truth confronted with falsehood, might (without mutinies
or tumults) apply themselves quietly unto the true and right Religion. But our
Lord and Savior says, that he came to bring war, and not peace into the
world, so as in one house there shall be dissentiou betwixt the Father and the
Son, the Brother and the brother: How can we then maintain the Religion of
Jesus Christ, if they will reduce all the world to one faith, and to one Law,
seeing that for the ordering thereof, he does not command the faithful to
kill the rest; but contrary wise he says, that the Apostles and faithful,
should be betrayed, excommunicated, and put to death, for their faith and
Religion, and therefore he will have them win the field through patience and
the virtue of his word? So as I cannot wonder sufficiently at the impudency of
these men, who making a show to be well read in all ancient Histories; do
maintain, that there were never two different Religions in one Common weal:
for what will they say or answer to the diversity already alleged, betwixt
the Pharisees, Sadduces, and ^^^sses; without doubt, they shall never find,
that by reason of these Sects, there was any great difficulty in the Government
nor that Jesus Christ, nor his Apostles, did ever command to burn them for
their Law.

What shall we say of the diversity of Religions that were among the heathen,
whereof one did not know another Gods, No not the Names? And some also
maintained publicly, that God did not care for humane things: And yet we
find not, that the Government of the Romans was troubled for this cause.

But who does not see at this day, under the great Turk, a great diversity of
Religions, so as among the Christians alone, there are fifteen or twenty Sects
and sundry Religions: besides the Jews, Persians, and Mahumatists, all
subjects to his Empire; the which are more contrary the one to the other, (for
matter of Religion) then water is contrary unto fire.

Without doubt, if these diversities were the true cause of seditions and
tumults, It were not possible that the Turks power should grow so great: It is
then a great ignorance to think that subjects cannot be maintained in quiet,
when they are of diverse Religions; for who so will look nearly to the spring
and beginnings of tumults and seditions, he shall find that they proceed not so
much from the diversity of Religions, as through private passions; as through
covetousness, ambition, revenge; hatred, and such like, from the which small
quarrels may grow; and when the Magistrate prevents it not in time, then by
little and little they inflame, and are cause of tumults and public seditions:
witness the troubles and seditions in Italy betwixt the Guelphs and Gibellines,
the which continued four hundred years, and was the cause of infinite murders,
rapes, wars, and all sorts of violence; and yet there was no difference in the
Religion, but all did grow for that the Magistrate did feed the private
passions of their Subjects, instead of suppressing them by Justice. And as for
controversies touching Religion, it is not two hundred years since that the
controversies betwixt the Franciscans and the Iacobines for the Conception of
the Virgin Mary, had caused great troubles throughout all Christendom: Not that
the controversy was of any great importance, but through the negligence of the
Magistrate, who nourished these factions, and became partisans. Seeing then it
appears that whereas good order has been settled, people of diverse sects and
Religions have been quietly governed, without any sedition or tumult; and
contrariwise whereas no order was, not only diversity of Religion, but even
small quarrels have bred horrible seditions and tumults: any man of Judgment
may gather thereby, that seditions and tumults take not their increase from the
importance of the quarrel whereupon they are grounded; but rather through the
want of good order, for that the Magistrates neglect to punish them that
entertain them, or else themselves maintain one party: the which is confirmed
by many ancient and modern examples. And who so will examine strictly the last
troubles of France, shall find that the greatest part have happened for that some
mighty men or Governors themselves, having no regard to the public good, nor
to the ordinances of the States, have at their own pleasures played the Kings,
and insulted of their own authorities over them of the Religion. I think no man
is so ignorant, but knows that the murder committed at Vassey by the Duke of
Guise, against the laws of the King and State, has been the true and only
cause of the Civil Wars which followed, to the ruin of the whole Realm: for
whilst the Kings proceeded by their authority, there was no news of any
sedition, how grievous soever the persecution were, but when as Governors of
their own authorities, offered violence to those of the Religion, presently
all these tumults grew; the which may serve us for a good example: whereby we
may learn to avoid the like inconveniences, and take some good course for the
benefit of the King, and of all his good subject, which seek only to obey him.

It is then easy to resolve that good order would be settled, if liberty should
be granted to them of the Religion, to assemble and exercise their discipline,
restraining and bridling them with such laws as shall be thought good, and that
the Kings Magistrates and Officers be careful to execute his Majesty's
intention; foreseeing above all things, that the people usurp not the authority
of the sword under color of the factions of great men; so as above all things
there must be a prevention that all violence be forborne on either side, and
that those which proceed by any other unlawful means, as by taxing and
slandring, shall be well punished; which doubtless will be a most assured
means, and the subjects shall live in good unity and concord together, and will
carry a perfect obedience unto his Majesty: and in the mean time truth will lay
open falsehood in such fort, as that the King shall not need to fear that
heresies shall multiply by this means, to root out the truth; but contrariwise,
we shall see truth flourish, and all heresies and false sects decay; Gods glory
shall be generally celebrated, and the Kings Greatness and Prosperity increase.
The which God grant us by his holy grace, to whom be all glory for ever and
ever. Amen.

A HISTORY OF A BAYLIFFE OF Sonth-Holland touching the taking away of a poor
man's Cow, and of the justice done upon him by Duke WILLIAM, entitled the Good.
A remarkable example for Magistrates to execute Justice.
IN the year 1336. there was a Countryman in South-Holland who had an exceeding
fair and good Cow, with the which he maintained his wife and children (as there
are some in that Country which give twenty pottles of milk and more in one day)
The Bayliffe of that quarter desiring this Cow, would gladly have bought it of
the good man: but as it was all his substance and means to live by, he would
never be drawn to sell it. The Bayliffe seeing himself refused, caused the Cow
to be taken out of the pasture, and another to be put in the place, the which
was nothing comparable to it; wherewith the Countryman being discontended, and
seeing that he could not have his own, by the advice of his friends he went to
complain to the good Count William of this violence, being then at Valencien
grievously sick: The Earl having heard him, took pity of him, and caused
letters to be written to the Schout of Dordrecht, that all other affairs set
aside, he should come presently unto him, and bring with him his Cosen the
Bayliffe of South Holland. The Schout having viewed the letters, demanded of
the Bayliffe if he had offended the Earl in any thing; the other answered no,
and that he knew not any thing if it were not for a Cow which he had exchanged
with a Countryman: but making no account thereof, they went together to
Valencien: The Schout presented himself first before the Earl to know the cause
of his sending for him; The Earl having received him courteously, asked where
the Bayliffe his Cosen was; who answered that he was also come: Whereupon the
Earl commanded him to enter; being entered, the Earl asked him if he were
Bayliffe of South-Holland; he answeted with great humility, so long as it shall
please you my Lord: The Earl asked him how all things did in Holland, and if
Justice were duly administered: very well (said the Bayliffe) all things are in
quiet: Said the Earl, How comes it that thou Bayliffe and Judge of that
Quarter, have used force and violence against a poor Countryman that is my
subject, taking away his Cow in despite of him? Then calling for the poor man,
he asked him if he knew him, and what he could say for his Cow: The Bayliffe
answered that he had given him another: Yea said the Earl, but if it were not
so good as his, do thou think to have satisfied him therewith? no, no, not
so; I will take the cause in hand, and be the Judge. The Bayliffe and the
Countryman referred themselves willingly to what it should please the Earl to
decree: Whereupon the Earl appointed the Schout of Dordrecht, that as soon as
he should return to his house, he should presently without delay pay unto the
Countryman an hundred Crowns of good g^ld, to be levied upon the Bailiffs
goods, and that he should never after molest the Countryman neither in word nor
deed. This sentence thus pronounced, both parties were satified: which done,
The Earl said unto the Bayliffe, thou have now agreed with the poor man, but
not yet with me; then he commanded the Schout to retire himself, and to fulfill
what he had enjoined him; but the Bayliffe should remain by him to make
reparation of his faults: and having sent for a Ghostly Father, and the
Executioner, he condemned the Bayliffe to lose his head, to serve for an
example to others; then being confessed, the Earl caused him to come before his
bed, and he himself drawing out the sword, gave it to the Executioner, who cut
off the Bailiffs head in the Earls presence, being thus sick in bed: Who having
called the Schout, said unto him, take your Cosen with you, and beware of such
facts, left the like happen unto you. The Schout returning to Dordrecht,
carried back the Bayliffe in two parts, and paid the Countryman his hundred
Crowns.

FINIS.
