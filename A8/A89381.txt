A most Wonderful and true Relation of Mr John Marklain Minister of Gods Word
at Lesbury in the County of Northumberland, etc.
AL though this age wherein we live has been an Age full of wonders, and none
have been more frequent or more remarkable then in our own Land: yet this
wonder which I shall now declare unto you, will be sound to transcend all other
Wonders whatsoever.

Not only invention, but Histories Ecclesiasttical and Civil, have told us of
some rersans, who from the grave have ^een restored unto life, We have red of
the dead Child which was revived by the Prophet, and of the wonder wrought by
our Savior upon Lazarus, who paid to Nature one debt more then he owed: But
of a man who from the age of one hundred and sixteen years was restored to a
youthful and vigorous constitution, to have a new strength of light, to have
new teeth, and new hair, to receive a new youth in all the faculties of Soul
and Body, that no age but this no Land but our can parallel.

We shall find that the Prophet Daniel, a though in the thankful
acknowledgement of Gods mercies to him, he says, I hou have renewed my days
like and Eagle, ye before all extraordinary progress of time he stooped to the
infirmities of age, and being covered with clothes he could get no heat; He
found that true in himself which he said of others; The age of a man is three
score and ten, if he attain to four score years, his days are but sorrow and
weariness: But this man of whom we speak being almost one hundred and twenty
years old, had his eyes that were dimm enlightened, and did say by his
Spectacles which before he used, he might well take up this in the
Ecclesiastes, and make the strength of his age as much his gratitude as his
wonder. The Keepers of the house did not tremble, nor the strong men did bow
themselves, the Grindders did not cease because they were few, and those that
look out at the window were not darkened, the Almond tree did not as yet
flourish on his head, the silver cord was not loosed, nor the golden Bowl
broken, nor the pitcher broken at the well, nor the wheel broken at the
Cistorn, etc.

Nevertheless it is not to be dissembled, that if you will wipe off the dust
of Antiquity from some of the Greek Poem we shall find that the Father of Jason
being of a great age, and having a body laden with diseases, was made young
again by the charms of his daughter in Law A^^dea, we shall read also of and
wonder wrought on Virbius, but these are inventions which have nothing but
Fable to maintain their reputation in the world. The Narration of this is true,
and sent in Letters from the North to several Persons of almost the highest
account in this Nation.

His age was quickened into youth, and it was at this pregnant season of the
year, when Winter is quickened into Spring, I may call it his Renovation, or
his Resurrection from the ruins of Age, to the strength and beauties of youth.
Indeed there are many things in nature which seem to point at a resurrection
such as this, and would persuade us by their examples to a more easy
entertainment and belief of this Wonder, and in the first place,

We may look upon the solemn Poetry of the Phonix, a Creature rarer then the
Resurrection, though not so admirable, in whose Ashes she may see the fire of
life expecting to be fammed to the resurrection of a flame as if this Creature
by a Riddle of Fate should by a fire both perish and revive, you shall find
that it recovereth it self from diseases and corruptions of age, into the
vigor and the courage of youth.

But in earnest we may behold the Eagle shooting forth her new quills, by which
she does testific her endeavors and desires of immortality.

But why should we in the sloth of contemplation study so broad an object: Let
us with more graceful industry confine our eyes to the small seed of Corn, and
at least take the pains to see the pains of the Husband man, where behold the
delightful Arithmatick of Nature, we may see the seed, whose hope seems small
at it self, by being cast away to be found, by destruction to receive increase,
and from the same surrow to take both its burial, and its birth.

Thus both the divine indulgence gradually chastise the difficulty of the
length of instruction, and by things more obvious both surpass our
understandings to things that are not, so the Phoenix out of her ashes to
reassume new life, is both read and received: For the Eagle to renew her beak
and her youth together, is approved of by experience. For the seed of Corn to
rise up from the surrow, and to be young again and multiply, is the daily
obserbation of the Farmer* But for an old man of one hundred and sixteen years
of age, to cast away at once both his Spectecles and his Crutch, to leap from
the infirmities of age, into the height and strength at youthful age, to have
his heart warm again with desire, and his beins with blood, is such a
miracle, That not only Reason, but Nature her self does startle at.

Son of man can these bones live? Says God himself to the Prophet Ezekiel,
Those Bones whose hopes are as dry, and as much exhausted as is their narrow;
This is a Task for God himself to do, be only can revive him, who did create
him; It is he that can bring flesh again upon him, and can gird it about them
with sinews, it is he that can cover them with skin, and can cause his breath
to enter into him, it is he alone can bestow complexion upon him, and having
made smooth the furrows, can plant the flowers of youth, on the brow of Age, it
is he alone yt returned the extreme age of this old man to a youthful and
vigorous constitution, and hallowed be his name.

There are a generation of men in this age who live like the Sadduces, as if
there were no resurrection, they add lust unto oppression, and murder to
bypocrisie and vainly minding the glory of this world, they quite forget the
Kingdom of God, let them therefore understand and tremble at the apprehension
of it, the same Omnipotent God that gave both health and youth to this aged
man, when he had one foot in the grave, has a day at hand, when at the sound
of the Trumpet he will call all flesh to judgment, The oppressor shall then
give an account of his wealth, and the conqueror of his conquest, and in what
holiness of Spirit they have lived in the height o their fortunes, for though
Heaven be high, no step so near as humility.

There is also a generation of men, who hanging their Harps on the Willows do
sit down on the banks of the rivers, and do increase them with their tears, who
are either lying on the ground, or are laid in it, exhecting the resurrection
of the just, the same God who against hope did miraculously revive this man
unto youth, will raise them unto glory, for the day is appoaching when
corruption shall put on incorruption, when loose dust by the warmth and
moisture of blood shall be kneaded into man, when there shall be a resurrection
of the grave, of rottenness, of sickness, of the winding sheet of
consumptions, all which shall be purified into joy, into strength, into perfect
beauty, into a robe of glory, into a throne of glory, into life, into health,
into immortality; when there shall be a renovation even of Majesty it self,
whose glory which seemed here to be buried in this world, shall then
illustriously arise in the face of heaven, when the transitory condition of all
good men living (...) mainly be exchanged (...)

I shall now dissend to give you a particular account of the Birth and
Profession of this man, on whom God was pleased to confer this VVonder.
By Birth he is a Scotch man, by Education a Scholar, bred up in the
university of Scotland in which having taken his degrees, and attained to the
formality of Master of Arts, he professes the study of Divinity, and at a
Village called Lesbury in the County of Northumberland, some five and twenty
miles distant from Newcastle, he was chosen to be Parson and Rector of the said
place: his name is John Marklaine, he was noted always to be a great Student,
and to execute his Function with great industry and diligence, he was so
temperate of life, and withal so strong of constitution, that notwithstanding
his restless lucubratious, he was almost fourscore before his eye grew dimm
or any toth did begin to fail him, when he was three score and fifteen years
of age, or thereabouts, he began to use Spectacles, which he continuen full
forty years together, until lately he found by degrees his eyesight every day
to grow stronger and stronger, and at last to be so perfect, that without any
Spectacles he was able to read the smallest Print that could be brought unto
him.

The report of this seemed so strange to many Ministers and Gentlemen
thereabout, that they hardly could give any credit to it, until taking the
pains to come to his house, their eyes did prove that to be true which their
ears did hear: and the Wonder thereof being spread up and down the Country, it
did draw many more of all sorts unto him, who as they were Spectators of the
blessing, so they were partakers in the joy, and departed giving thanks to God
for what they had heard and seen.

As his eyesight did improve it self, so did his hearing, for hearing before
but heavily, and when they did speak aloud unto him, his hearing was as quick
and perfect as in the time of his strongest youth.

His teeth also which were most of them decayed, and many of them quite lost by
the injury of age, did begin to break forth again, and in a short time did
appear in as even and as full a row as at the first.

And whereas his hair was but thin before and gray witth the tincture of age,
his hair does grow forth again very thick, and is of the same complexion as it
was when he was but thirty years of age.

Neither was this reparation of nature only in his head and tongue, for
speaking before but softly he now peracheth again very audibly, and with a good
voice, but his whole body in all the faculties thereof, is miraculously renewed
in his strength, insomuch that he now studieth as closely as in those days of
his youth when the greatest employments were upon him and he preaches
constantly every Lords day, both in the forenoone and in the afternoon, having
his memory, his apprehension and elocution as good as at the first time when he
did take the Ministry upon him.

These things being very true, and attested by a cloud of witnesses, methinks
those men who had the Ministers of the word of God in contempt, should now be
taught to give them a more mamerly rerespect, since we see that he was here
pleased to make use of a Minister of his word for the manifestation of his
power. And it is obser babble that he granted to this Minister so long a time of
life, and almost thirty years beyond the custom of ordinary men, on purpose
the more to manifest the greatness of his power, for surely it ever any man
since the Creation deserved to be called Virbius, that is to say, twice a man,
it was this Minister, what did we think could put new eyes into this old man's
head, but the resurrection, what could fasten them in his Sums but
Resurrection. That history of the Teeth that were sowed by Cadmus, and of the
armed men that sprang forth thereby, though otherwise wonderful, is but a
sluggish miracle compared to this. It God who is both the resurrection and the
life, who did breach a new into this old man the breach of life, it was he that
did indue him with a new warmth, and did create new spirits within him.

And since be has been pleased to give us so large a proof of the dispensation
of his goodness, let us walk worthy of his mercies, and believe that he who
raised this man when he was falling into the grave, will also raise us, and
that the manifestation of his Providence in this is a sure sign unto us of the
resurrection shortly to come, when Age shall be exchanged into youth, and
imperfection into perfection, when all things shall be new, when there shall be
a new Heaven, a Earth, and a new Jerusalem, when the Son of man shall appear in
the Clouds, attended with an innumerable company of Angels, who are the Youth
of Heaven, when the glory of this World shall vanish into nothing, and God
shall be all in all, to whom be all Honor Dominion, and Obedience, now and for
over more, Amen.
