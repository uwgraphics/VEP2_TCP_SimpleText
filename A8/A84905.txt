A PROCLAMATION By his Excellency the Lord General,
For the regulating of Soldiers in their march to IRELAND.
WHereas it is credibly reported, that diverse Soldiers in their march through
several Counties toward Jreland, have and still do harrasse, plunder, and act
great violencies and insolences in the Country, to the great injury of the
people, and dishonor to the Army, notwithstanding the power by a former
Proclamation given to the Country, to suppress and secure them so doing; I do
therefore hereby require all Officers and Soldiers of the Army under my
Command, that do quarter in or near such places, to be aiding and assisting to
the people of the Country, for their relief against the outrages and violences
of any such Soldiers in their march or otherwise: Provided, that it is not
intended hereby, that those engaged for the Irish Service, be discouraged,
disturbed, or interrupted in their march, and orderly quartering.

Given under my Hand and Seal in Queen Street, this 17. day of March, 1648. T.
FAIFAX.

Imprimatur.

Hen. Whalley, Advocate.
