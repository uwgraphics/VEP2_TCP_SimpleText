A DECLARATION Of Major General MASSEY.
AND Eighty other English Officers and Commanders Engaged with the Kingdom of
SCOTLAND, in behalf of their Presbyterian Brethren, in ENGLAND, IRELAND, and
the Principallitie of WALES.
Dear Countrymen,
AS we are all Members of one Body, so we ought all to be governed by one Head,
and made capable of one another sufferings; You cannot be ignorant what
pestilent Humors have got predominance in the Body Politic of our native
Country, corrupting the very heart of all good Government, and causing a Blody
issue to be made in the very bowels of a Flourishing land, by unhapy
emulations and civil dissentions arising rather from a surfeit, and oppulency
of abundance of Peace, and blessings, then from any just cause of our own; I
hope there is none amongst you so forgetful as not to remember your Solemn
League and Covenant made with so many imprecations, and ratified, sealed and
delivered in the presence of God and his Angels, besides all other our Oaths
and Protestations, as so many sacred bonds and Obligations binding our
Consciences to the preservation of the true Protestant Religion, the Kings
Person, the Rights and Privileges of Parliament, and Liberty of the Subject,
all which we ever have done, and still will by Gods help preserve with the same
care as we do our own souls; yet we are not unsensible of the many callumnies
of our reproachful enemies, that unjustly brand us, for at first managing an
ungodly design for the Eradication of Monarchy, and rooting out the KING and
his Posterity, the better to subvert all good Government both in Church and
Commonwealth.

To clear our selves from these foul-mouthed aspersions, and notoriously known
scandalls so wickedly fathered on us and our Brethren, we have thought it
necessary to manifest our real Intentions in this our Declaration to the whole
world of the integrity and uprightness of our hearts, to show what loathing and
detestation we have of all such Hypocrisy and deep Dissimulation, least by our
silence we might be thought guilty, or to have fellowship with these ungodly
workers of iniquity, whose desperate, rebellious, pernicious and destructive
Principles we are so far from owning, or siding with, that we have taken up
Arms against them, and are resolved, to the last drop of our bloods to oppose
that Tyrannors Army now under the Conduct of the Lord General Fairfax, or
Lieftenant General Cromwell, or any with whom they are associated or combined,
falsely stiling themselves The supreme Authority of the Nation, the Commons of
England in Parliament assembl^d, or any of their upholders, Aiders or Abbettors
that now assume the Ligistitive Power of the Kingdom; have murdered the King,
and disabled the House of Lords from their right of sitting as a House of
Peers, or for ever having any Voice or Votes in Parliament, any more then as
Members of the Commons House; having by their pretended Power constituted a
Tyrannical Counsel of State, and to enslave and vassallage the whole Nation,
have since erected a High Court of Justice, thinking by that to fright Free
People into ^u^ mission to their new mock- Authority, by which illegal Court
they intend, (by the same way as they before murdered their lawful King, now
to gorge their libidinous and murtherous appetites with the blood of his best
subjects, that so they may dye their black souls (if it were possible) into a
deeper dye of innocent blood, to uphold their wicked Tyranny, Democrasy, and
Annarchicall Government; Neither are they content with the blood of their King,
but they have disinherrited the Prince from his unquestionable and hereditary
succession to the Crown, and enacted all those Traitors, and to die without
mercy, That shall Proclaim, Relieve, repair to, aid or assist Him either
with men, money or Ammunition, or so much as hold Intelligence with their Liege
Lord and Sovereign, for which they have direct warrant from God, and are bound
to that duty by their several Oaths, and the laws both of God and man;
Neither has their malice anchored here; but they have forced upon the People a
most dangerous and sinful Engagement, To be true and faithful to a Government
that they shall never know any bounds to, and to bind them to yield Fealty and
Homage to them that are but their fellow Subjects, and by the Laws of God, and
the Land is due to the KING only, and to none but such as derive their
Authority from him, and therefore cannot be subscribed without wilful perjury
to God, and wilful Treason to the Law; abolishing a long settled Government,
that we were to submit to for the Lords sake, not in stead of reforming to be
abolished, but prayed for; that under it we may lead quiet and peaceable lives
in all godliness and honesty: Wherefore myself and about 80 English Officers
more have in prosecution of our Covenant, and several Oaths, (not only in
behalf of our own Nation, but the Kingdom of Scotland also,) have received our
Commissions from King Charles the Second, in whose Right, as well as restoring
the People to their ancient Government by KING, LORDS and Commons from any
Tyranny in either, we have all drawn our swords, and vowed never to put them up
again (unless His Majesty command the same) until we have Restored our King
to His Rights, the Parliament to it is lost Privileges, and the Subject to his
Liberty, and taken off the scandal laid on us and our Religion, by bringing
all Traitors and Tyrants to Justice for what Treasons they have committed
against either; which is the sole cause of our Undertakings.

Therefore we desire all our Presbyterian Brethren, and the rest of our friends
and Allies in England, not to be discouraged by any threats or force of the
Enemy, but courageously prosecute their first Principles, and rather suffer
with patience, and bear Christ's Cross with joy, and a good Conscience, then to
suffer themselves to be subborned by a crew of cruel Tyrants, that rule by
their own Wills, and seek to load the shame and guilt of their own sinful
actions upon your Consciences, that so you might become copartners with them
in their Trade of wickedness, and so to be made Heirs to such Punishments as
necessarily fall to be the portion of such children of disobedience; But we
hope better of you (Brethren) and wish you not to pretend ignorance in these
things, least you thrust your selves wilfully out of His Majesty's Protection;
but relying on your Covenant, His Majesty will be as tender of your welfare, as
of his own life; knowing, that to destroy his own subjects, is to deminish his
own strength; assuring his good People, that it is not his intention to yoke
them to a Tyrannical Government, nor to make use of Foreign Aid a jot longer
then he is necessitated for the recovering his just rights, as well as his
Peoples Liberties, and to administer Justice on the inhumane Murderers of His
dear Father, whose blood cries to us all for revenge on the Actors of that
bloody and inhmane Tragaedy; which are the sole ends of his taking up Arms, and
of our assisting Him.

Wherefore (in his Majesty's behalf) we are commanded to declare;

That whosoever of you (that have stood to your Covenant) and shall come in
unto us at the Approach of His Majesty's Armies into England, shall not only
obtain an Act of Oblivion for what is past, but shall have Protection for
themselves, and all such money or goods they shall bring with them; and whoever
shall employ any Horse, Men, Arms, or Warlike provisions whatsoever, shall
receive such full assurance of real satisfaction, as other his Commanders and
soldiers have, with an addition of such Honors, and other rewards from His
Majesty, as your several merits, or services shall deserve; And in this our so
Just and Pious Undertakings we make no doubt we shall not only be seconded with
the blessing of God, but have the Prayers, as well as Aid and Assistance of
all honest men, to recover His Majesty's Rights, establish true Religion, the
Privilege of Parliament, and the Subjects Liberty, against the opposition of
men or Devils; and as we really and cordially (according to our Covenant, and
all those sacred bonds that are upon us; intend the same, without any other
self or by-ends soever, tending to the least prejudice of our Brethren, so we
pray the Blessing of God may attend us, and if otherwise, That all the Curses
in his holy Book may be the Portion of us, our Wives and Children for ever.

From Orkney Island in the Kingdom of Scotland March 29. 1650. I remain Your
affectionate friend, and lover of the Kingdoms Peace, and Subjects Liberty,
MASSEY.
For. Mr. J. G. 123. to be Communicated to our Friends in London and elsewhere.


Signed by 80 English Officers, who have all taken up Arms for his Sacred
Majesty.



FINIS.
