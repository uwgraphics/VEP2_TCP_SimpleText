My Lord,
I Am so full of business, that I cannot write to your Lordship but very
briefly. It has pleased God to give us an extraordinary deliverance from a
cruel conspiracy and massacre, from malignants within the City, and from a
powerful invasion from without by Prince Rupert and all his forces. God
discovered unto us the conspiracy some two hours before it was to be acted;
we took the chief actors with their Arms and preparations in several houses
by threescores and forties in a house, we have laid them safe in the Castle,
and the Enemy, after two or three Cannon shot, perceiving that the plot within
the Town (whereon they depended) was discovered, wheeled about and left us in
some haste, fearing we should fall upon their rear; and indeed four of my
Troopers chased seven of theirs, took four of their Horses, their Arms and
Cloakes, and forced them into a River to save their lives. Whosoever shall
consider the condition this Town was in, in respect of the townsmen, and in
respect of the Garrison (one Regiment, viz. Col. Essex'es something
disteinpered by their Colonels removal, especially the Officers, although
they did very good service, with great diligence; and the other Regiments being
raw Soldiers, and hardly having one old soldier for an Officer amongst them
all, and how I was without money, without counsel, and without experience in
my own particular for matters of this nature) must upon these and many other
considerations conclude, that though, as I writ in my last to your Lordship,
that it is not to be expected that I should do miracles; yet God has been
pleased to preserve me almost by a miracle, the praise and glory of this good
success being only due to him. And it is very probable that Prince Rupert will
make another attempt upon this City, which is of infinite consequence to them,
and without a good proportion of men, it cannot be defended: it will require
1500 or 2000 men to be upon the guard constantly, to make a sufficient guard:
there is no better way then to have here a body of an Army of four or five
thousand men at the least, which when the Enemy approaches may have recourse to
the City, and at other times may disperce it self to the defense of the
adjacent Counties. My Lord, never did man make such shifts for money as I do,
my Regiment of Horse, Col. Essex his Regiment of Foot, Col. Hungerfords
Regiment, and part of Col. Pophams lies upon me, besides many great incident
charges which in this case must needs be borne by him that commands in chief.
I beseech your Lordship to consider me, and let us have money at least, if we
cannot have both money and men, both which we want. I shall shortly send your
Lordship and my Lord General (to whom I humbly beseech your Lordship to
excuse me that I do not write at this time, for I am not willing to make an
imperfect Relation, and I have hardly time to eat, drink, or sleep, or
scarce to turn my self) and I will also send the examinations of the
prisoners in the Castle, which are wellneere 60, with all the passages of this
great deliverance, from a most bloody massacre, for which the Major and
Aldermen and Council of this City are very desirous to join with me in a day
of public thanksgiving in this City.

March 11. 1642. Your Lordships most obedient son, Nath. Fiennes.

SIR,
I Cannot omit to give you a hint of our condition, and what has passed among
us this week: on Sunday night last we had an Alarm, Prince Rupert with a
force was come against the City, with some two thousand Horse, as is reported,
accompained with his Brother Prince Maurice, and Lord George Digby, and other
Noblemen; they came with considence of an easy entrance, and therefore brought
no great Guns, they expected supply from our Malignants, which it seems was
promised on Monday, they faced our works, where Colonel Fines sounded a
Trumpet, having with him only a Troop of Horse; at night they retreated, and
next day being Tuesday they appeared again, waiting the issue of a Treasonable
Plot which some of our wretched Citizens had assured to perform. This, and Sir
William Wallers not coming, together with the advantage of a good part of our
Forces gone to Sherborne and our works not finished; of all which they had a
daily account made them, build upon an easy conquest: On Tuesday night, whilst
the City was in a continued Alarm, it pleased God so to bless the painful
watchful diligence of Colonel Fines that the Treason was discovered, and the
chief Actors taken, with all their preparation, which is one Robert Yeomons,
one of the Sheriffe^ the last year, and George Butcher, both Merchants, who
are now imprisoned in the Castle, with many more; others are fled, and since
seen in the Kings Army, and some are hid, and every day new ones discovered
and secuted, I cannot write you now at large, they being this day in
examination, but in brief it was thus, they had concealed many Armed-men in
Houses, and fitted them with all things necessary to the work, there is found
with one of them a Copy of the Actors Names, which was sent the Army and such
others as must be protected; All others were to be left unto the spoil, the
first two sorts were to have a white Inde in their Bosoms, and upon their
Arms; The Plot it self was to set upon the Sentinells, and the Court of Guard
at Frome-Cats and the Pitty-Gate and to do it quietly, they had the convelance
of the backside of a House to bring on their men, who must come together at the
to wling of a Bell in three Churches, St Nicholas Bell for the Butchers, Saint
John's Bell for the Saylors, and Saint Michaels Bell to bring down the
Cavaliers; My House must be the first to beforced for the Reyes, which at that
time I was without upon special occasion, which when it came to the hearing of
the Kings Army they were not a little angry, and are now withdrawn from us,
how far, we yet know not, but the snare is braken, and we are escaped,
blessed be the Lord. This does require a day set apart for Thanksgiving, and we
have now resolved upon it, I am sorry my Son remains so weak, yet I hope we
shall enjoy him longer amongst us, I must conclude and take my leave resting.

Bristoll this of March, 1642. Yours assured, R.A.

From the Fort at BRANDANH ILL, March 11. 1642.
SIR,
YOurs by the Post I have received with my Bill of exchange, for which I give
you many thanks for your pains therein: as for your business with the
Alderman, I must entreat your patience till the next conveiance, it is so that
my Captain, my self, and all our Company, have bin here to keep this Fort
this three days and two nights without relief, it is somewhat hard duty for
fresh water Soldiers, but we are all willing to do it, because the time does
necessarily require it.

Upon Tuesday the seventh of this month, Prince Robert, Prince Maurice, and my
Lord George Digbie, with 4000. Horse and 2000. Foot, came and presented
themselves with their Forces upon Durdam down, within Cannot shot of this
Fort, and now I shall give you a Relation of a Treason as horrible, as
detestable, (and setting aside but the greatness of Persons) as bloody as the
Gunpowder Treason, and ought especially by us of this place to be taken notice
of, and yearly to be celebrated with praise and thanksgiving to the Great
Protector unto eternity, the Plot was thus: Our grand Malignants to God and
their Country, had combined with the Forces aforesaid, to draw near the City,
and had promised them to assist them with 16. pieces of Ordnance, or more, as
occasion should serve, these Guns were to be brought unto them by 500. Seamen
from our Pill where the Ships ly, and these men were to join with them for our
confusion. Now within the City Master Robert Yeomans that night had gotten into
his house privately between 50. or 60. men, some Merchants like himself,
others Seamen, and all Rogues, their number I believe was to be greater, but
God did discover the Plot ere it came to the height; these men in the night
were, upon the towle of a Bell at Saint Nicholas, to come out of his house and
join with a Regiment of butchers and mecanicks, that would come up to the high
Cross, and they to kill the Centinell, and go possess themselves of the main
guard, and so to hinder all that side of the City over the Bridge, from coming
to their succor, then at Froome gate Master George Boucher he had another crew
of like Vermin, that upon the towle of Saint John's Bell (which was to be at
the same instant of time) they were to join with a Company of Seamen, and set
upon the guard at Froome gate, and all to be put to the Sword that came within
their reach, they having possession of these two Guards, a Bell was to towle at
Milehill, to give notice that the Cavaliers should draw down to Froome gate,
and ere they should come, some from the Guard should go and break open the
Majors door and kill him and his, take away the City keys, and let in these
destroyers, so that now by this Post you might have heard of the Tragical end
of all your acquaintaince, for we found in some of the actors possession white
inckle strings about of an ell long, and every one that was to live, should
wear one in his hat before, and another in his bosom, those that wanted it
were to be massacred by Pistols or Swords without mercy. The discovery of this
was miraculous, some poor body or other came to our Company which guarded the
Bridge that night, and acquainted us that they saw some men go into Master
Yeomans house at ten or near eleven a clock at night. Whereupon half our
Company with a Troop of Horse, went to the house and found the men as I have
formerly related, with many Pistols and Muskets ready charged, these men were
presently sent away to the Castle, and that night the Company at Buchers house
were taken, which hindered the towling of our Knell, and the next day we fell
to work roundly, and have clapped up all the Malignants we know.

On Wednesday the Enemy had notice of the Plots Discovery, which made them
retreat, and as I am unformed, Prince Robert went away weeping for certain he
was so incensed against the parties that promised assistance and failed him,
that he would speedily return with Ordnance and be revenged on altogether: he
is retreated toward Cicester, I pray God convert him (but not turn him.)

Upon Thursday last in the afternoon, Prince Roberts Trumpetter came to Town,
and we all thought it was to Summon the City, but proved otherwise. I was
present with Colonel Fynes when he came in, and his message was from the
Prince to the Colonel to enquire after two Gentlemen, which he said a party
of Horsemen had set upon, and either taken or killed, the ones name was Weston,
the other Wheton, both Gentlemen of quality, the Colonells answer was, he had
no such prisoners of that name, but told him that on Tuesday night 3. of his
Troop set upon seven of their Company, and took four of their Horses, two
Cloakes and some Pistols, and that the men swimmed for their lives, no man ever
seeing them after they entered the river, so that its probable they are drowned.
I have been tedious in this Relation, and all because I would truly possess
you withal the passages, and now what remains but to crave your
thankfulness to the Almighty for this our great deliverance, and the Lord
grant we may never be unmindfull to render unto him praise and thankfulness
for it; All your Friends are in good health here, your Father I hear not of,
so for the present I take leave, and rest

Your assured loving Friend E. H.
Pray acquaint my Brother with what I write to you.



A Letter written by a Reverend Minister now residing in Bristoll, to a Friend
of his in LONDON.
Loving Friend,
I Could do no less then impact to you the wonderful and miraculous
goodness of our gracious God, in preserving this City of Bristol from a most
bloody Plot to be put in execution upon the soldiers and well-affected in the
City, which was on this manner: Your Brother, the Captain, being appointed to
watch with his whole Band of soldiers at a Gate in Bristol, called Froome
Gate, on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, Nights and Days, and being diligent
to see all his men in readiness, walks up and down within his Guard, as well
to prevent the Enemies without, approaching nearer and nearer the City. even
to a place called Durdome Down, within two Miles of the City (as the
Malignants within the City, from effecting their Plots, which we did always
fear, but now were persuaded were nearer to be put in execution, by reason of
the Enemies so near approach toward the Walls of the City) and bending
toward that very Gate, it happened through the mighty Providence of Almighty
God, that when the Captain commanded all the Inhabitants of that Street to
hang out their Lights, by reason of the Darkness of the Night, and his
soldiers were beating at their Doors to that purpose, that one Buchers House,
a Merchant of great Wealth was without Light: at whose Door when they knocked,
they would make no answer, as if there were no person at all in the House: Upon
which, it pleased God to put it into the Captains mind, (finding by inquiry,
that there had been some that entered in the day before) to suspect those
persons that were in the House to be Malignants, because they would not hang
out their Lights. Whereupon the Captain commanded his Men to break up their
Doors; and when he and his Men were entered into the House, they found about
threescore men ready with their Arms: of whom, they apprehended twenty
three, and the rest ran out at a Watergate, on the backside of the House, and
went away through the Water, it being a low Tide, and made an Escape: and
searching afterward, they found great store of Arms, Muskets ready charged,
with some seven, and some ten Bullets apeece, their Pannes prim'd with
Brimstone and Powder mingled together, that they might not miss Fire, their
Linkes ready by them, their Powder papered out, and all things ready for the
Deligne, which should have been put in execution within an hour after this
time of their apprehension, and the Method of their Plot was this: They having
many days before kept in Pay great numbers of Armed men in several parts of
the City, which men consisted for the most part of Sailors, Butchers,
Halliers, and such like, that upon the Touling of the Bril of Saint John's, and
other certain Bells appointed by the Conspirators, the Malignants of Bristol
at a certain hour appointed that very Morning should issue forth at Froome
Gate in special, and at diverse other Gates of the City, upon all the
soldiers, at their several Centuri^s, to murder them, and then seize upon
the Ordnance, and make good Froome Gate for the entrance of the Enemy into the
City (at the Ringing of a Bell) who lay within a mile and an half of the
City, expecting every Minute when they should have been let in, and as soon
as they had entered the City, they were to cut the Throats of all persons in
the City, which had not the Mark and Word secretly dispersed through the
City, to save some that the Enemy favored: the Mark was a white Ribon^ or
wh^te Incle on their Breast, and the Word wa^ King Charles. The Captain the
next Morning took Bucher himself, and took Herbert a Merchant, a Malignant,
and diverse other chief Merchants of the City: Herberts Boy and Butchers Maid
being taken at Buchers House, have fully confessed the Plot, and about an
hundred of the Complotters are taken, and in close Prison* Now, when the Enemy
found that the Plot was discovered and prevented, though they had drawn their
Forces so near the City, immediately they withdrew, and retired toward
Ciceter: And now we hope we shall settle the City in a very safe way. Thus
much I thought good to impart to you, that you may know the certainty of the
Business, and thus in haste desiring your prayers, I remain your loving
friend.

FINIS.
