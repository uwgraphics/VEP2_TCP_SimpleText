A COFFIN FOR KING CHARLES: A CROWN FOR CROMWELL: A PIT FOR THE PEOPLE.
You may sing this to the Tune of feign I would.
1 Cromwell in the throne.
SO, so, the deed is done,
the Royal head is severd
As I meant, when I first begun
and strongly have indeavord.
Now Charles the 1. is tumbled down,
the second, I not fear:
I graspe the Septer, wear the Crown,
nor for Jehovah care.
2 K. Charles in his Coffin.
Think thou base slave, though in my grave,
Like other men I lie:
my sparkling fame and Royal Name
can (as thou wishest) die.
Know Caatiffe, in my son I live
(the black Prince called by some)
And he shall ample vengeance give
to those that did me doom.
3 The people in the Pit.
Suppressed, deprest, involvd in woes,
great Charles thy people be
Basely deceivd with specious shows,
by those that murtherd thee.
We are inslavd to Tyrants hests,
who have our freedom won:
Our fainting hopes, now ownly rests
on thy succeeding son.
4 Cromwell on the throne.
(Base vulgar) know the more you stir
the more your woes increase,
Your rashness will your hopes deter:
(it is we) must give you peace.
Black Charles a Traitor is proclaimd
unto our dignity:
He dies (if ere by us he is gaind)
without all remidie.
5 K. Charles in his Coffin.
Thrice perjurd Villain, did not thou
and thy degenerate train,
By mankinds saviors body, vow
to me thy Sovereign,
To make me the most glorious King
that ere ore England raignd:
that me and mine in every thing
by you, should be maintaind.
6 The people in the pit.
Sweet Prince, O let us pardon crave
of thy beloved shade,
It Is we that brought thee, to the grave,
thou were by us betrayed.
We did believe, it was reformation,
these Monsters did desire:
Not knowing, that thy degradation
and death, should be our hire.
7 Cromwell on the throne,
Ye sick braind fools, whose wit does lie
in your small guts; could you
Imagine our conspiracy,
did claim no other due
But for to spend our dearest bloods,
to make Rascalians flee,
No, we fought for your lives and goods,
and for a Monarchy.
8 K. Charles in his Coffin.
But there is a thunderer above,
who though he wink a while,
Is not with your black deeds in love:
he hates your damned guile.
And though a time you pearce upon
the top of fortunes wheel,
You shortly unto Acharon,
(drunk with your crimes) shall reele.
9 The people in the pit.
Meanetime (thou glory of the earth)
we languishing do die:
Excise does give free quarter birth
while Soldiers multiply.
Our lives we forfeit every day,
our money cuts our throats:
The Laws are taken clean away,
or shrunk to Traitors votes.
10 Cromwell on the throne.
Like patient Mules resolve to bear
what ere we shall impose,
Your lives and goods you need not fear
weel prove your friends not foes.
We (the Elected ones must guide
a thousand years this land,
You must be props unto our pride,
and Slaves to our command.
11 K. Charles in his coffin.
But you may fail of your fair hopes,
if Fates, propitious be
And yield your loathed lives in Ropes,
to vengeance and to me.
When as the Swedes and Irish join,
the Cambrian and the Scot,
Do with the Danes, and French combine
then look unto your lot.
12 The people in the pit.
Our wrongs has armed us with such strength
so sad is our condition,
That could we hope that now at length
we might find intermission,
And have but half we had before,
ere these Mechanics swaid
To our revenge, knee deep in gore
we would not fear to wade.
13 Cromwell in the throne.
In vain (fond people) do you grutch,
and tacitly repine.
For why, my skill and strength is such,
both Poles of heaven are mine.
Your hands and purses both coherd,
to raise us to this height:
You must protect, those you have reard
or sink beneath their weight.
14 K. Charles in his coffin.
Singing with Angels, near the throne,
of the Almighty three:
I sit and know perdition.
(base Cromwell) waits on thee
And on thy vile associates:
twelve months shall full conclude
Your power; thus speak the powerful Fates,
then vades your interlude.
15 The people in the pit.
Yea powerful Fates, haste, haste, the time
the most auspicious day,
On which these monsters of our clime,
to hell must post away.
Meanetime so pare their sharpened claws
and so impare their stings,
We may no more fight for the Cause,
nor other novell things.
FINIS.
