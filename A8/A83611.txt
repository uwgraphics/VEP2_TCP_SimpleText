Die Veneris 15 Septem. 1643.
WHereas in times of common Danger and Necessity, the Interest of Private
persons ought to give way to the Public; It is Ordained and Declared by the
Lords and Commons in Parliament, That such Apprentices unto VVatermen, plying
and Rowing upon the River of Thames, as have been or shall be Listed, to serve
as Soldiers, for the Defense of the Protestant Religion, and Liberty of the
Kingdom, His Majesty's Regal Person, the Parliament, and the city of London,
under the command of Sir William Waller; Their Sureties, and such as stand
engaged for them, shall be secured against their Masters, their Executors and
Administrators, from all loss and inconveniencie, by forfeiture of Bonds,
Covenants, Infranchisements, or otherwise: And that after this Publique-service
ended, the Masters of such Apprentices shall be commanded and required to
receive them again into their service, without imposing upon them any
punishment, loss or prejudice for their absence, in the Defense of the
Commonwealth.

And the Lords and Commons do further declare, that if it shall appear, that
the Masters of such Apprentices have received any considerable loss by the
absence of their Apprentices, they will take care that reasonable satisfaction
shall be made unto them out of the Publique-Stock of the Kingdom, according to
Justice and Indifferency.
