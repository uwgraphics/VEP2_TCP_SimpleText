The Practices and Attempts of the Hamiltons, particularly of Duke Hamilton now
General of the Scottish Army.
SIR,
THe news of suppressing those Covenanters, which were the first movers, and
chief Authors of all our troubles these ten years past, the taking of Barwick
and Carlisle, the forward proceedings of your Parliament, and the readiness of
an Army to advance into England for the Kings service, give great encouragement
to all our friends here; But the report of Duke Hamiltons being made General,
is like water to our wine, and afflicts us with fears. It is a wonder how the
Kings friends have been induced to consent unto it, or what necessity could
drive them to make use of so desperate a remedy, which for my own part I fear,
will prove a means to increase the disease, and (if God prevent not) fatal to
the King and his posterity. For now the Hamiltons have not only the pen and the
purse of Scotland, (the Dukes brother Lanerick being Secretary, and his brother
in law, Treasurer) both which have great influence upon the Subject; But they
have the sword settled in their hands by authority, and so whom favor will not
draw power will force to go along with their designs, for obtaining the Crown
and Government of that Kingdom, which they have aimed at for one hundredth and
twenty years and upward, as may be clearly instanced in many particulars,
sufficiently known to all such as are acquainted with the State of affairs of
Scotland in latter times. I shall briefly put you in mind of some, and leave
the rest to your own observation.

After the death of King James the fourth, John Duke of Albany being chosen to
govern the King in his minority. The Hamiltons made a conspiracy to thrust the
Duke out of authority, and to take the custody of the King, and Government of
the Kingdom into their own hands, the better to accomplish their ends: In
pursuance whereof they took the Castle of Glasgow, and made an Assembly of
their faction. But the Duke of Albanies speedy coming with an Army, surprised
them, dissolved that Assembly, and made the Earl of Arran, chief of that
design, to flee away. But here they rested not.

For Sir James Hamilton, bastard son to the Earl of Arran, conspired the
death of the King in his own house at Holy-rude House; For which and other
crimes after mentioned, diverse years after, when the Plot was revealed, he was
executed.

When this failed, they used their endeavors that the King should not marry,
that so he wanting issue, Hamilton might succeed to the Crown. They hindered the
Kings meeting with his Uncle the King of England, who was willing to have
married his only daughter to him, and made him King of England as well as
Scotland after his death.

The King going by sea to France, Sir James Hamilton went with him to hinder
his marriage; and the King being asleep in the ship, Sir James without any
necessity from wind or weather, caused the mariners to turn sail from the
West Coast of England, and to land in Galloway; which gave the King such cause
of discontent, against Sir James, as he began to understand his unfaithful
dealing, and at last he was executed for Treason.

These practices discovered, made the King more hasty to marry, that his
succession might put the Hamiltons out of hope, and himself out of danger of
their further plots.

The King dying, and leaving issue, only one daughter of six days old, The
Hamiltons thought all their own; For they got the Earl of Arran to be named
Governor by a private faction: But the Estates soon weary of his Government,
discharged him of his office; wherefore his design, to marry his son upon
the Queen (whom he kept rather like a prisoner, then a Princess) was
disappointed, though in the opinion of diverse, it was once far advanced; the
Duke of Lenox and Earl of Angus, his principal opposer, one of them being by
him banished, and the other imprisoned.

After the Queen and her mother were rescued out of his hands, in hopes to
gain their favor, and so his ends he abjured his religion in Sterling, but
without success. When neither he could get the Queen out of the way, nor
married as he desired, he consented to expose her to the storms of the sea,
and danger of enemies, and sold her to France, for which he was made Duke of
Chastlerault.

Having in manner thus sold their pretense to the Title of the Crown, yet the
Hamiltons were not quiet, but used many means, during the Queens being in
France, and after her return to get the Crown. In order whereunto they
conspired with the Earl of Bothuel, to kill the Earl of Murray, and when the
Queen married to the house of Lennox, which to this day, they esteemed always
as their great enemy, they conspired with the Earl of Bothuel to murder the
King, wherein particularly Bishop Hamilton Duke Hamilton of Chastlerault
brother was very isntrumental. When the King was thus removed, and so the
Crown brought a degree nearer to the house of Hamilton, it seemed to them very
probable (as it was indeed) that Bothuel should destroy the young King, and not
suffer him to live to revenge his fathers death, and prejudge the children of
Bothuel with the Queen in the succession to the Crown, and if the King were
destroyed, they hoped that the Queen and Bothuel would be so hateful to the
people, for the murder of her husband and her son, that they would have
easy access to the Crown, or otherwise then that they might kill Bothuel; in
which case they were in hope the Queen should marry, John Hamilton the Dukes
son, whom she entertained, often with merry looks and cheerful countenance.
But the King being preserved and the Queen kept in Loch-herm by command of
the Parliament, the Hamiltons took another course, which was to relieve the
Queen, and employ all their power, to suppress the King, and the nobility
that adhered to him

I might here make a large discourse of their base murdering the Regent the
Earl of Murray, their joining in conspiracy with the Duke of Norfolk, and
others in England against Queen Elizabeth, their pretending to have the Queen
brought out of England, when they knew it was impossible, without the Queen of
Englands favor which they never sought but rejected, to the end they might in
the mean time have the better opportunity, to follow out their designs
against the King, and hinder him from being settled in the Government (as now
they pretend the rescuing of the King out of the Isle of Wight, and yet by
their actions I am afraid shall render it impossible,) But I leave these and
other remarkable passages, that I may come nearer our own times to speak of
the designs of this Marquess, whom cunning policy and juggling carriage
(seconded with the Craft and Courage of his brother Lanerick) seems to have
fitted for such an enterprise, and who began very early to insist in the steps
of his predecessors, encouraged perhaps with that old Scotch Prophecy.

When Kaidyow shall be King.
Meikle woeshall be bring.
His first Plot to get power into his hands was under pretext of that levy for
Germany about seventeene or eighteen years ago; whereof that you may have a
true narration, I shall give you the chief heads of the depositions of the Lord
Reay, Lord Ochilcree and others, as their examinations were taken by the Lord
Coventry then keeper of this kingdom; treasurer Weston, the Earls of Morton
and Carlisle, by the Kings direction.

In anno 1630 three or four considerable persons of the name of Hamilton of
near relation to the Marquess of Hamilton, not having served the King of
Sweden one year, cashiered themselves from service, without any known cause to
such as were their fellow soldiers; the Lord Reay being in Stockholme at the
same time, was informed by his Lieutenant Colonel, one Lindsey, who lodged in
the same house with Sir James Hamilton that the reason was, their chief the
Marquess of Hamilton intended to be a soldier, and they resolved to take a
share of his fortune whatsoever it should be, and that they had assigned their
estates to others before their engagement, that they had offered him the said
Lindsey a Regiment whereof he did accept, and that they shortly expected David
Ramsey from England, who accordingly not many days after came to Sweden.

In company one night, as the Lord Reay Colonel Alexander Hamilton, Sir James
Hamilton and David Ramsey, were drinking, they did drink the Marquess of
Hamiltons health by the name of James by the grace of God King of Scotland, and
in discourse David Ramsey complained to him of the great abuses in the Court,
and that Popery and Arminianisme exceedingly prevailed to which the Lord Reay
replying, that there was no remedy but patience, nay says David Ramsey (with a
great oath) to use your own words my Lord, We must help God to amend it.
Further said, that the Marquess was a good Protestant, and before it were
long, he would let the world see his design was for the defense of his
Religion, the Lord Reay answered that it would be small advantage to us to
procure a free passage of the Gospel in Germany, if we lost it at home, to
which David Ramsey said, there were many honest men at home, and that the
Marquess would make use of his Army to protect them, and that this was his
only aim. Whereupon the Lord Reay offered his service in that quarrel: David
Ramsey said it was not needful to impart any more to him of the business, he
must keep his masters secret; but if there was any thing the Lord Reay desired
to be done for him in England, he could do his Lordship service; Colonel
Hamilton and Sir James being to go for England, the Lord Reay desired to have
the reversion of Orkney, saying it were for the advantage of the Marquess his
ends to have a friend in that place; and on the morrow Colonel Alexander
Hamilton and David Ramsey having given him great assurance of true friendship
from their master the Marquess, if he would continue constant in resolution,
they desired him to write a general Letter to the Marquess with the two
Colonels; which he did, and so they parted.

In the Month of July, Master Robert Meldrum being come from the Marquess in
pursuance of that same design, the Lord Reay met with him in Pomerland, and
asked news from England, to which Master Meldrum answered that matters became
worse and worse, and the King did give greater way to Papists and Arminians
then before; then he asked the Lord Reay where his Cosen David Ramsey was, and
what he had done; and the Lord Reay told him that he was gone for Holland, and
all things were done according to his mind, and particularly that he had taken
care for Arms and Ammunition to be sent to the Marquess from Sweden; at which
news Master Meldrum did throw his cap to the ground and jumped up, calling
aloud, good news, good news, I am a happy man, I am happy and made up for
ever, I thank God my five years pains are not lost; my good Lord Reay, is
this true? To which the Lord Reay replying that it was true, and that he had a
duplicat of the contract, and was engaged in the business to David Ramsey, and
the two Colonels and to the Marquess by Writ. Master Meldrum said, O my Lord,
that was the work of God, and not man, to inspire your Lordship to join with
us.

Further Master Meldrum told to Lindsay my Lord Reays Lieutenant Colonel, that
six thousand trained soldiers with their own Faction in the Country would be
able to do the business.

The day following at Colonel Leslies Tent, Master Meldrum told the Lord Reay
that King Charles was created for nothing but for desolation and undoing of
kingdoms, Religion and people, and there was no way left, but to take him and
immure him within a wall or Dungeon for ever. The Lord Reay demanded how that
could be got done; Master Meldrum answered, that the way was easy; for after
the men were levied in Scotland they might take one month to train them at
Leith without any suspicion, then they might seize on the Castles of Edinburgh
Sterling and Dumbartan and the Town of Barwick in one night, and having
fortifyed Leith, then to enter England by open force.

Further, he told that the Lord Reay that he was writing a Declaration
concerning the Marquess his just and clear title to the Crown, and touching
the tyrannical usage and sufferings of the Church under King James in his last
days, and now worse, groaning under his Son.

Within a few days there came news of the birth of the Prince, and the Lord
Reay asked M. Meldrum whether this would cool the Marquis his intentions, to
which master Meldrum sighing, said, not, If the King and Queen of Bohemia would
give their daughter to the Marquess, as they had promised; making no question
or difficulty about the Marquess his divorcing from his present wife, which
(as David Ramsey had affirmed) was a very beast, and the King had forced him to
marry her.

Also Master Meldrum being in company drinking with Lieutenant Colonel Lindsay
and on Henry Muschamp an English Gentleman, he did discover so much of that
business, as the morrow after the Lieutenant Colonel told the Lord Reay he
thought Master Meldrum the worst Secretary in the world.

Master Meldrum in discourse one day with the King of Swedens Secretary said,
it were greatly for the advantage of the King of Sweden whose ambition was
without limits, that the Marquess did raise war in Britain; for if the King
of sweden had a design on Denmark, the King of Britain should not be able to
help his Uncle; Whereunto the Secretary replied, that they feared not the King
of Britain; for he that would not help his own Sister, would never help his
Uncle.

The Lord Reay asked Master Meldrum what they intended to do with the Queen
and Prince, he answered, that they would shut up the child with his father, and
send the Queen to her Mother, to be put into a Monastery.

Mr. Meldrum further acquainted the Lord Reay, that the Marquess would take
pledges of all in Scotland who would not join with him, or make them
prisoners, and that he the said Master Meldrum was to be Secretary of State.

When the Lord Reay came to Holland in March 1631 he met with David Ramsey, who
delivered him a Letter from the Marquess, of complement and thanks, and told
him that all went right with the Marquess, that he had gotten from the King
ten thousand pounds in England, and the Wine customs in Scotland for diverse
years, which he would sell, and that all things proceeded without obstacle,
only the stay was for Arms and Ammunition; afterward he said he had ill news
to tell the Lord Reay, which was, that the Marquess his wife was brought to
bed of a child; but for the business of Orkney, that the Lord Reay might have it
cheaper then to pay the duties of it, and that when the Lord Reay met with the
Marquess, he would infuse that into him which he the said David Ramsey durst
not.

He said further, that the King had made a Peace with Spain very prejudicial
to Holland, and that the Treasurer Cottington and others had muffled the King
to bar the Hollanders from the fishing, which might fall out happily for them.

When the Lord Reay came to England, the Lord Hamilton did give him many
thanks, assuring him he would not want him, that he should have what conditions
he desired, and that he had written to the king of Sweden with Elphingstonn and
Meldrum that he would detain him, and if he would hazard with him the said
Marquess in this business, that it should be a tie for ever upon him and his
posterity.

In the beginning of May 1631, the Lord Reay, meeting with the Lord Ochiltry at
the Bear of the Bridgefoot, he said to the Lord Ochiltry, your Lordship is
better acquainted with the Laws of the Land then I, who am a soldier and have
lived abroad; I do therefore desire to know, what danger it is if a man should
hear abroad any Plot against the king and state, and not reveal it; The Lord
Ochiltry answered that it was the loss of life and estate; and within eight or
ten days after, upon promise of secrecy not to divulge it without his advise
and direction, the Lord Reay communicated the whole business to the Lord
Ochiltry. After revealing of it, they resolved first to acquaint the Lord
Treasurer of England therewith, that he might impart it to the king, and
accordingly the Lord Ochiltry did acquaint the Lord Treasurer with it, and
afterward upon the 18 of May, the Lord Reay delivered in a relation of all the
particulars before mentioned, under his hand, which he offered likewise to
seal with his blood.

The Marquess of Hamilton being then in Scotland upon secret advertisement
from a friend at Court, came speedily to the king, who at first entertained him
not with that familiarity he was wont; but by his cunning policy, and subtle
insinuations he prevailed over the kings good nature, persuading him to believe
that all was done out of malice, and that these were aspersions and calumnies
invented by the Lord Ochiltry, whom he caused the King to send to Scotland to
be there tried and censured, well knowing, that at such a distance from the
King he could order the matter as he pleased.

It is to be observed that the Lord Ochiltry, conferring with the Treasurer of
England, who was desirous to be informed of the Marquess of Hamiltons power
and strength in Scotland, with more forwardness and affection, then due
consideration, did give in a list of the names of the friends of the Marquess,
whom he apprehended would be most ready to join with the Marquess, and that
when the Marquess returned from Scotland to Court, he suggested to the King
that there might be present danger to his person, by suffering the Marquess,
who was the prime Agent to come near him. In these particulars it is true, that
the Lord Ochiltry had no warrant from the Lord Reay, to deliver in a list of
names to the Treasurer, nor to say to the King, that he was in present danger
by the return of the Marquess from Scotland; But all the rest of the
particulars the Lord Reay did acknowledge, and deliver in subscribed with his
hand: yet the Lord Reay was not at all challenged for any information he had
given, nor the Lord Ochiltry, for any thing he had said by warrant from the
Lord Reay, but such was the power of the Marquess, as the Lord Ochiltry was
arraigned for delivering in that list of names, and suggesting to the king his
fears of his Majesty's danger, upon the Marquess his return; and his friends
perceiving, after Ochiltry had pleaded for his own innocence, that the matter
relished otherwise then was expected, found ways to put off further Trial, and
to imprison him, first in Edinburgh, there after in the blackness that he
might be out of the way, and at further distance from the King, who was then
coming to Scotland; in which prison he lies still, the matter never yet being
put to any legal trial, nor he declared guilty or not guilty, notwithstanding
his frequent petitions for the same. The Lord Reay in the mean time who was
the chief informer, not at all to this day troubled or accused, which no
question if the Marquess had not been conscious to his own guiltiness, could
not have come to pass; however it is well known to some at Court, what power
David Ramsey had over the Marquess all his life; and that when he was reduced
to any strait or want, if the Marquess furnished him not readily, or obtained
such suits from the King as he desired, he would vow and swear to discover
that the Marquess was a Traitor, after which he has been secretly brought
into the Marquess his lodging, his desires granted, and they reconciled. And
it is likewise well known, that Master Meldrum has a pension from the
Marquess yearly.

I might here add the examinations, touching Master Meldrum, and others about
this business; but because I promised to be brief, I shall only add the
Deposition of one Master l. Borthwick, which he delivered to the King signed
with his hand, that you may understand what sort of people these be; the words
which he deposes Meldrum to have said are these.

1. Domum Regis esse profluvium iniquitatis and foetidum lupanar. 2. Reginam
esse omnium mulierum salacissimam. 3. Flagellum dei inhaerere universae
familiae and stirpi Jacobi Regis.
The next attempt of the Marquess to get power into his hands was in the
beginning of the troubles of Scotland, upon occasion whereof he procured to
himself to go to that Kingdom, to settle all differences there; but if we may
judge of his intentions by his actions and the issue, that was not his errand
to Scotland, but to increase the differences; for when after many juglings
between King and subject, he put all over to the determination of the National
Synod at Glasgow, then within seven or eight days dissolved it, and returned
to the King, whom he incensed against his Subjects of Scotland, as he had done
them against their King, hoping to fish in muddy waters. A war followed, and
the Marquess purchased to himself the command of the Navy, that whatsoever
danger the King should be in, the Marquess himself might be in safety, and
look on as a spectator. When he came to the fir^h of Scotland, he acted his
part at sea, as he had done in the land; None could discern whether he was for
the King or the Country; he did wear the Kings colors; but was very sparing
of his men and ammunition, neither indeed was it safe for him to do otherwise;
for the Covenanters sent some into the ships to him, to let him know that if he
did any harm, they would discover and make good all the business, of which he
was accused by the Lord Reay and Ochiltry; which no question they could very
well have done, Master Meldrum being then a forward Covenanter.

When a pacification was made betwixt the King and his subjects of Scotland,
and the Scots entered this Kingdom the year following, the Marquess still kept
correspondence with the chief Covenanters: and if some of the Scots
Commissioners had not for Court ends stood his friends, in the beginning of
this Parliament, he had suffered, for his abusing both King and people; for
some Articles were once in preparation by the House of Commons for his
counselling the King to the breach of pacification, for betraying the Kingdom
to the Scots, for the multitude of his Monopolies, his advising the King to
wrack Master True a member of the House of Commons, after the dissolution of
the former Parliament, and diverse other things; But that accusation was laid
aside, upou promise to persuade the King to pass an act for a trienniall
Parliament, and not to dissolve this present Parliament without their own
consent, and the like good services to be done to the House of Commons.

When the King went to Scotland, in Anno 1641. the Marquess to ingratiate
himself with the Country, joined with the Earl of Argile and that faction,
and upon pretense of a Plot against him by some Courtiers and soldiers, went
from the Parliament of Edinburgh to the Country with Argile, at which time the
King declared publicly in Parliament, that however now he seemed to comply
with them, he was the only man that incensed him against that Kingdom; and
upon the other part, it is well known that Hamilt on even when he was his
Majesty's Commissioner, often said in private to the chief Covenanters, that
nothing would prevail with the King but force and necessity.

In the year 1643. when the King had very near subdued all his opposers in
England, and reduced the whole Kingdom to his obedience, except London and
three or four Garrisons, and there was no probable means left for those few
members, who styled themselves a Parliament, whereby to preserve themselves, or
to oppose the King, but the calling in of the Sects, and when it was not
possible, at the least very difficult for the Covenanters to afford any
considerable assistance to their Confederates in England, if those who
professed themselves to be the Kings friends in Scotland, had faithfully acted
their parts, then Hamilton thought it time for him to pass over from the
Covenanters and pretend for the King, that by having access to his Counsels,
he might betray them, and disappoint his designs. The Kings friends finding
him thus inclined, procured great offers to be made to him from the King as to
make him Duke, and give him in marriage the Prince Electors sister, the Kings
Neice, which he cheerfully embraces, and promises to do great services to the
King.

No sooner does he hear that the Queen is landed at Berlington, but with all
expedition he repairs to her Majesty, to congratulate her safe return. The
Noble Marquess of Montrosse had before his coming acquainted her Majesty
what dangers were to be feared, from the Covenanters in Scotland, and that
there was no way to prevent them, but that by authority from his Majesty, all
the Kings friends should rise in Arms to oppose them. But Hamilton condemns
this as a very rash counsel, and undertakes by fair means to hinder the
raising an Army in Scotland, if the King would trust him with the managing of
that business; and to make it the more plausible, he promised to do it without
any trouble or expense to the King; whereupon a good King easily cozened with
the fair pretenses of one so near in blood, and so much obliged unto him,
gives him absolute trust.

When he returns to Scotland, he makes as great professions at home, as he had
done abroad, and would gladly have seemed to be the most zealous man living for
the King in^erest; yet in all his actions crossed the advice and Resolution of
the Kings friends. For the King being advertised, that the Covenanters had
indicted a Convention of Estates without his knowledge, wrote a letter to the
Duke, and those of the council, to discharge the Convention: but he concealing
the letter, desired the Earl of Callendor, to speak with the Earl of
Broxburgh, and some other Noble men best affected to his Majesty, and to crave
their advice; they all in one voice answered, that it was their Judgment the
King should disclaim the Convention, and declare it illegal; but the Duke
sends them word by the Earl of Callendor, that it was the Kings mind to
approve the Convention with some limitations; which though it made them to
alter their advise, yet as it was related by the Duke, it was most false, the
King never having had any such things in his thoughts, until it was suggested
to him by Hamilton, as the advice of his friends in Scotland, and that there
were hopes to carry matters in the Convention for the kings advantage, or at
least to hinder any assistance to be sent to England against him: thus the king
and his faithful servants in Scotland were deluded, and by Hamiltons policy,
induced to countenance the Convention to the great prejudice of the kings
affairs; but when they came there, yet the Duke and his brother Lanerks
carriage in that convention, and after it, was no ways according to what was
promised in the conference with the Noble men that were affected to the king,
of the truth whereof the Earl of Callendor and Mr. Murrey can particularly
inform you, and how he would neither join with the kings friends, in a course
of opposition, nor give his approbation, that they should do it themselves,
without his personal appearance in the business, but on the contrary
discouraged those, who were willing and ready to take their lives in their
hands, and to adventure all that was dearest unto them for his Majesty.

When he had thus disappointed the kings service, then he and his brother
Lanerk wrote letters to the king to advertise him, that very speedily an Army
was to come into England, and according to their promise, they had hindered them
all summer, but could not hinder them any longer; shortly after these letters,
the two brethren began their Journey to Court, where they found their Juglings
discovered to the King, and a process drawn against the Duke, wherein it was
offered to be proved, that he was the occasion of all the troubles and evils
that have befallen these Kingdoms; in particular, that he enticed the king to
begin the War against Scotland, and in an underhand way, stirred up the people
against the king, by advising them not to yield, and bidding them insist, and
they would get their will, for he was a very coward, and that if he got his
will, he would prove a greater Tyrant then N^ro; that he had managed all
businesses wherewith the king had trusted him, to his Majesty's disservice;
particularly that he had given way to the present raising of an Army in
Scotland against the king. There are diverse other articles in that charge, some
of them are coincident with what I have already written, though more largely
expressed, and therefore I trust you will excuse me, that I have not sent you a
Copy thereof.

The king upon consideration of so heinous crimes, and treasonable practices,
committed the Duke Prisoner to Pendennis, and shortly after his brother Lanerk
escaped away from Oxford to London, where he was welcomed by the Scots
Commissioners, and dispatched away to their Army by sea with letters of
Recommendation, and from the Army to Scotland, where he was instantly received
to their Covenant, and admitted to their Counsels, and likewise to the Command
of forces.

The Duke being prisoner, was not able, though willing enough, to practice more
against his Majesty; yet Lanerk was not discouraged from prosecuting the old
design; for I do very well remember, that when the king was at New Castle, he
was credibly informed, that upon a serious Consultation amongst the
Covenanters, what instructions to send to the Scots Commissioners at London,
concerning the king, who (as they said) had been the Author of so much
bloodshed in both kingdoms, the Earl of Lanerick dropped these words, We can
never have peace as long as this king, or any of his race remains; and upon
another occasion, we can have no difference about Monarchical Government; all
the difference will be who shall be king. It may be he expects the
accomplishment of his horoscope, whereof (as himself since related) he had so
great confidence, when he was thought to be in danger, before his escaping from
Oxford, saying that he was sure he was not near his death; for it was promised
of him, that before he dyed, he should be a greater man, then it was safe for
him to mention. When the Duke was relieved from his imprisonment, and come to
London, as I am informed, he had some expressions, which discovered his
resenting his imprisonment; one expression so far as I remember, was to this
purpose, wherefore should he go to the king, (then at New Castle:) for how
could he ever trust that man, who when he was in power imprisoned him?

When he came to New Castle, he and Lanerick did undertake to the king to bring
him to Scotland, which if they had done, it had been an easy matter for the
king to have engaged this kingdom and their Army, for restoring his Majesty to
his just rights in England; but it stood not with their designs* to have his
Majesty personally present in Scotland; that would too much eclipse their
greatness, and disappoint their ends, and therefore they kept of the king with
fair pretenses from coming to Scotland, and all other resolutions till a
strict Guard was put about him; And within a few days he was delivered over to
the Parliaments Commissioners. I cannot forget also to mention, how in the
Parliament of Scotland, they made a fair show in reasoning for the king; but
when it came to the Vote concerning his delivery, the two brethren were in the
negative themselves, but all their nearest friends and dependers, whose voice
they use to command as much as their own, were in the affirmative.

It may be remembered likewise how they kept correspondence with the Sectaries;
for little good to his Majesty (I suppose) if all the truth were known.

However I perceive, that they have juggled so betwixt the king and his people,
as they have got into their hands the Government of one Kingdom, though they
dare not take off the mask; you will see that they will manage both peace and
war, so as to keep power in their own hands; they will agree with any party to
obtain their ends, and let them pretend what they will for restoring the king,
they will really obstruct it: For let any rational man judge, whether he that
durst take the boldness in the days of his Majesty's prosperity to aspire to
the Crown, will not in his Majesty's low condition, be ready to take the
opportunity to prosecute the same design. In the late declaration which you
say is drawn by Lanerk, I see they pretend as fair for the Presbyterian
Religion as for the king, when in reality, they are no further friends or
enemies to any Religion, then may serve for their ends and strengthen their
interest against the king and his posterity, whereof there is no mention in
that declaration; and let the Presbyterians think of them what they will, I
make no question, but if the Duke could be king of Scotland, his tender
conscience might without the help of Divines, be persuaded to digest with a
moderate Episcopacie, though we love not to buy it at that rate. How Absalom
like do they court the people with pretenses for the good of Religion, king and
Kingdoms; as if they intended nothing, but to perform their vows in Hebron?

I conjure you by the duty you owe to God, and the love you bear to the king
and his posterity, that you carefully take heed to their serpentine ways, and
give no belief even to their sacrest professions or greatest oaths; for then
least of all are they to be trusted, as I could easily clear unto you from
experience of their former dealings. But I will not further weary you, and
those doubting friends, to whom you are to communicate this letter, for whose
cause I have been much larger, then I intended when I put pen to paper
yesternight. Touching the State of affairs here, and what course shall be taken
in relation to Hamilton and his party, so as the kings affairs may suffer least
prejudice, I refer you to a letter from 123. and another from 271. And so rest.

Your Faithful Servant,
London May 23. 1648. Postscript.
I forgot to mention that one of Hamiltons predecessors in king James the sixth
his time, was forfeited by act of Parliament, for his aspiring to the Crown.



FINIS.
