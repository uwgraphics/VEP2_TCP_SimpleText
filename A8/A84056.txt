LONDON. Printed in the Year, 1648.

AEPVLAE THYESTEAE: OR, The THANKSGIVING-DINNER: WHERE The Devil finds all,
Meat, Cooks, Guests, etc.
ENjoy the Angry Powers: Do, Feast away
The sense of your high Crimes, and Judgment-day:
Mix your Frontiniack with Lethean Drops,
And Crown your guilty Heads with Poppy tops.
Error has seized, Oblivion seal your Souls;
And as your Sins are deep, so be your Bowls.
Let the Starved Country see your notous Feast,
Neither with Grace, nor Peace, nor Conscience blessed,
Let stupid England see the Goblet Crowned
Wherein is quaff'd their Ninety Thousand Pound
Per Mensem: There we may those Epicures see
Who Have put the Kingdom to an Atrophie.
It is a Collar Day, Saint-Traytors Day,
Wherein that Pseudo-Martyr Goodwyn may,
Inspired by Lucifer, give Thanks; and can
Invert the Words of outdone Julian,
(Puny Apostate, He! oth'Lower Room!)
And say, The Galilaeans overcome:
Yet dare He Text it from the Bible, Than
When he both Prays and Preaches Alchoran.
There Peter's, the Denyer (nay, it is said
He, that (Disguised) Cut off his Masters Head)
That Godly Pidgeon of Apostasy,
Does buzze about his Anti-Monarchy:
His Scaffold-Doctrines; and such murdering stuff,
Which yet Wounds naught but the affrighted Ruff
Of the Lapsed Aldermen; who have made good
E. of Strafford was accused for saying, [It would never be well with London,
till half a dozen Aldermen were hanged.]
Strafford's dark Maxim, now well understood:
"Twill never be well with England, till we see
"The Complement of Strafford's Prophecy:
"The truth is still the same, the number more,
" Fifteen will but serve now; Six would before.
Sermon being done and Scripture, the Ruffes fall
Fore CRUMWELL Bell, and Dragon GENERAL,
Long Live CUSTODES; that is the Cry. What Is He?
In English thus, Long Live our SLAVERY.
Custodes is the style, which Pluto lent
In special Grace unto the Parliament,
Puzzled what Title to assume: No shame;
Father and Sons may go by the same Name.
For These this Feast is kept, while Orphans cry,
And I and Lilburne are in Custody.
The Anthropophagi are set: They Feed,
"Let them Feed on, 'twill be their Time to Bleed.
First Course is Bishops Lands; A stately Dish,
Quoth OLIVER, and Cooked unto my Wish.
Next, in a Charger, Deanes and Chapters are
Placed against Martyn; It Is Mar-prelates Fare.
Reach that great Oleo to the General,
The Estates of poor Delinquents; Give't him All.
Lenthall and St. John's, both, are feeding hard on
A Glorious Mess; O! it is a general Pardon.
Prideaux is Late come in, and had almost
Staying for Packet-money, kissed the Post.
Mildmay is for his Didledam's; and ownes
No Fare so choice, as that of precious Stones.
" Goodwyn and Peter's at a Table sit,
"Eating Sequestered Livings at a bit.
But, O! Custodes rail upon the Cooks
Full sore; The King's, Queen's, Prince's Lands and Duke's
Are not enough, their stomachs wamble; they
Fear Their Digestion, that They will not stay;
A filthy Norman Hogo of a Nullum
Occurrit Regi, does like Stibium pull 'um.
The Judges have, in skins of Parchment, boiled
A Magna-Charta-Pudding; which was spoiled
And Broke it in the Seithing; that nor Wild, nor Pheasant
Could find one Reason in it, or ought that is pleasant.
Mick Oldsworth in his Independent Clothes
Is feeding PEMBROKE with a Broth of Oaths.
" BRADSHAW surveys the Dishes and the Meat,
"And likes All Well; but yet -- He dares not Eat.
Now, for a Cheese and for Digestions sake
The SEAL is brought; and Atkins gives a Cake.
They Are Filled; not Satisfied: They Are now for Wine.
O for a Draught, such as black Catiline
Drank to be-ransack'd Rome! Hark! Ner^'s Song,
Whilst the Accursed Health does pass along.
Viner the Goblet holds, and Peter's Fills;
And Goodwyn Consecrates; and CRVMWELL swils:
The Draught is CHARLES his blood, a crimson wine,
The Health's [Confusion to the Royal Line.] Hall,
The Health goes round, Round through the Cursed
"And no Man sees, THE HAND UPON THE WALL.
THE CITY PRESENT.
A Basin and Ewre to the General, of pure Gold.
ACcept (Black Sir) this Glorious Ewre, where we
Present, in Beaten Gold, like Loyalty:
We do Confess you high and Fortunate,
Or else this Gift had been a Massy-Plate.
The Basin is Antique, a richer show
Than that the Jews on Pilate did bestow.
Your services are not much less; It stands
Ready to Wash Your Excellent-Murth'rous Hands.
A Basin and Ewre to the Lieut. Gen: of pure Silver.
GReat Sir, that you may know we have a sense
Of your high Parts, and candid Innocence,
With Purest Silver we present those Hands
Made to bring Peace and Blessings on all Lands.
Ireland expects your Sovereign Face; and cries,
Come Oliver, or bleeding Ireland Dies.
But as you pass by Windsor, if your Nose,
Coming near CHARLES his Corpse, should ought disclose
Oh! drop the Blood in this; for 'twas our Plate,
(From Bodkins unto Basins) wrought His Fate.
A short Grace, after a long Dinner.
WE thank thee Oxford, thou have given us Grace,
And made us Doctors of thy learned Race.
We thank thee London, eke, each Citizen,
For Ye have made us more, Great Gifted Men.
The God-speed.
"Go on, impose upon the World, and Awe
"All, till the SECOND comes and gives you Law.
FINIS.
