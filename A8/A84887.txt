A LETTER Written by the PRINCE ELECTOR of BRANDENBURGH, Unto the King of
FRANCE: Declaring the Reasons inducing his Electoral Highness to take up Arms
against the King of Sweden.
Translated out of the Latin Coppie.
Most Serene and Potent King, our Lord Cosen, and most honored Kinsman.
IT cannot choose but be known unto your Majesty, as chief Mediator, what
labor and pains has been employed to compass the Peace and Friendship,
betwixt the Kings of Swed^n, and Denmark, and to beget a repose and Tranquillity
in the Provinces of Denmark, and those other his Territories which are situated
in the Roman Empire. So likewise the other Mediators, as well as your Majesty,
and every body else, did conceive, That by the said Peace, the King and
Kingdom of Sweden, were sufficiently provided for: whose Power was not only
thereby greatly augmented, but Denmark was thereby so straightened, and bound
up, as that none, no not the Swedes, needed to have dreaded the attempts of a
Kingdom, which was in a manner Rent asunder, and to perpetuity blocked up
within it self: Especially when as the King of Denmark, had entirely fulfilled
the Conditions which were agreed on; though to his own, his Kingdoms, and his
Successors great Prejudice; And moreover (by way of Constraint) did grant unto
the Swedes several other most considerable things, according to their own good
Likeings, and in conformity to their prescriptions; relying on the hopes, that
the Public Faith given by the Swedes, confirmed by such sufficient Securityes,
and by the Religious promises of a King, and a Christian, would have been
performed.

But even as many others, so also this good King, and his people were
sufferers, during the Swedish Public Faith and Peace; For as they have often,
and yet do complain, the Swedish Forces oppressed them as much if not more,
both in Denmark and Holstein, since the War was appeased, as during the
greatest Violence of the same. And as if they heeded not at all the breach
thereof, they neither observed Peace, nor agreement: although it could hardly
have been immagined that the Swedish Impiety would have transported them to
what they have done; and whereat doubtless both your Majesty, and all
Christian Potentates, as well as our selves, will be amazed.

Since it has been reported by the King of Denmark's Ministers; That by an
unheard of example, amongst Christians, there was a Conspiracy hatched against
the most Serene King of Denmark, his Children, Kingdoms, Provinces, and even
against those of his Territores, which are sittuated in the Roman Empire; as
also against the Liberty and Lives, and Fortunes, of his Innocent Subjects, who
being in a peaceable and quiet manner of living, not apprehending any such
matter, should under the Pretense of Friendship and Brotherly love, have bin
all put to the Sword: or excluding the King and his posterity, out of his
Kingdom and Provinces, and out of his territoryes situated in the Roman Empire,
to carry him and his progeny away into Captivitye, and to have reduced his
subjects under a perpetual servitude; Contrary to the late peace concluded on,
and performed by the King of Denmark; Contrary to the Public Faith given:
Contrary to the Honor and Reputation of the most powerful Mediators: and
finally contrary to all Laws both Divine, and Humane; And that on the same day
when as this Conspiracy brake forth unexpectedly, The King of Sweden himself
did in a Hostile way, not only fall into the Island of Sealand, and assailed
the King of Denmark in Coppenhaghen, his Chief Cittye, and place of Residence;
But by his hostile Armed Forces, did invade and assault the provinces of the
Roman Empire, which are comprised in the Westphalian treaty of Peace, Contrary
unto the same, and contrary to the last Peace between Sweden and Denmark,
Continuing to Exercise the same Hostilities and far greater, and thereby to
infringe the Public Peace.

Which pernicious change of affairs, when we maturely considered, and also
with anxiety Pondered, by what means the Public, and our own security might
be best Provided for, during this so great a breach of the Public Faith. We
encountered with so many and weighty Considerations, as we thereby clearly
perceived, that most eminent and sudden ensuing dangers threatened both our
Neighbors, and our selves, unless they were timely prevented, by serious
Consultations, and that by the Almighties assistance, that ambition were bound,
which till this present, had freely and unhindered, usurped and dominered over
it is Neighbours-heads, and Fortunes, as it is self pleased: And that in the
first place, the Kingdom of Denmark might be freed from those unjust
oppressions, so that at length, peace, and quietness, might be restored unto
it, and to it is Neighbors.

And whereas till this present time, those endeavors which have been used with
the King of Sweden, toward the Mediating of a peace, were so little regarded,
although urged and promoted by all posible industry, and means, as that they
have allwaies proved fruitless, but especially when as he seemed to persuade
others to peace. Besides which he has most unworthily, and undeservedly
Threatened us in a Hostile way: And has now also infringed the Peace with
Denmark, which was but lately so religiously, and solemly concluded; Insomuch
as that there being no more hopes left for an agreement, and an upright Peace.
We could therefore no longer deferr that whereunto we are obliged, both to the
Common, and our own cause, unless we would render our selves accessory, that
our Neighbors being overcome, and subdued, our selves might also deservedly be
overrun.

And therefore we have been constrained to put our selves into a posture, and
Equipage, toward the Compassing of no less glorious, and righteous
achievements, according to the Laws and Dictates of God, and of all Nations.

And whereas your Majesty's honor, and Kingly dignity, is also highly engaged,
to cause those things to be Religiously observed and inviolably performed,
which as it were upon our suretyship were Publikly concluded, and agreeded on;
And that betwixt your Majesty and our self, there has been hitherto an entire
and upright Friendship maintained: that we are equally engaged to each other by
the alliance betwixt us; We counted it a part of our Duty, Summarily, to
declare unto your Majesty, as far as the bounds of an Epistle will permit us,
the reasons which have induced us to undertake this defensive Expedition.

Because we were deserted in Porussia and Poland, by the King of Sweden,
contrary to the agreements, engagements, and real promises, and left to the
discretion of our then enemies, as all the world and your Majesty does know:
notwithstanding which, we persisted in our Friendly affection, continued and
observed the Peace hindered Enmityes, urged and promoted the Treatyes of peace,
which Poland proffered on reasonable conditions, and finally, did send our
Ambassadors to procure, and settle peace, but all in Vain.

Because our Ambassadors, were indeed well received in the Kings Name; But to
our disgrace, were treated withal in a new and unheard of Manner, were refused
audience, and without cause given or shown (and therefore unjustly) they
Proclaimed, and declared us ennemies.

Because the King of Sweden, had made a Peace with the King of Denmark; Had
received the satisfaction which was agreed on, appropriated unto himself the
Titles of the Provinces which he had so acquired, Enjoyed, and made use of
them, and did Publicly profess himself to be his Friend, and allye; and
though he retained the satisfaction, yet he performed not the agreements, and
having framed a Conspiracy, he Broek the said Peace, and beyond all
expectation, especially, under the pretense of Friendship (whereas they dreamed
of no such thing) he caused them to be killed, and led away Captives.

Whereas therefore the Common tie of Society, and Christianity does oblige and
constrain all and every one, toward the assisting, releiving, and defending,
of the unjustly oppressed, not doubting but this so heinous Premeditated a
conspiracy, will move all good Kings and Princes: but especially your Majesty;
so likewise have we several others reasons, motives inducing and enforcing us,
to the present undertaking.

For besides the constant and sincere, real friendship betwixt the King of
Denmark and our Electorall house, and that both fami^ies are allied to each
other by a straihter tie of Consanguinity, so likewise both the King of Denmark
and the states Provintiall of the Territories of Holstein, have in this their
extremity, and unjust oppression, required and demanded of us, that lawful
defensive help, which they might justly expect.

Moreover as concerning Holstein, the Westphalian Peace of the Empire, and the
other Germain statutes, and decrees, do command us to be in a readiness whether
we be called upon or no, Contrary whereunto Holstein being a Province of the
Empire, is troubled, oppressed wasted and assailed, by an unjust and
premeditated power and force.

Finally, the succession of the best part of the said Territories, being
designed for, and acquired by our Predecessors, and our selves, and to be left
to our successors, which if we should wilfully permit to be alienated, and cut
off from our selves, or from the Roman Empire, (of which we are not the least
member) and should not opose all our strength, and might against the same; We
should greatly fail in what we owe to our selves, and to our Posterity, and
might be accused by the Roman Empire, to have neglected our duties, nor should
we perform those things which behoove an Elector and a Prince of Germany, in
the behalf of his Country.

Therefore, since there is no hopes left, save in the taking up of arms, we
have prepared a defensive force against him, who wilfully has declared himself
to be our Enemy: who only waits an occasion to overrun us, and our Provinces:
who has religiously entered upon Treatyes and Agreements, but has deserted his
Allies and Abetters, against all equity, and has exposed them to the mercy of
their Enemies, who solemnly made a peace, and reaped great benefit thereby; but
retaining the profits thereof, most rashly brake the same again: who most
unjustly oppresses his Neighboring Kings, and Princes: who engaged his
Public Faith, but as publicly infringed the same again; who by no means
desires peace, who is an Incendiary, and Fomenter of all Wars, and Troubles
among Christians: and who therefore deserves the wrath and curse of
Christendom.

As therefore these forces are raised by us, on a just and legal cause, not
intending so much as to move an Arm, or a Foot, to entrench upon the Rights of
others; But chiefly, to relieve those who are unjustly oppressed, to restore
the disturbed and infringed Peace and Tranquillity, unto its former splendour
again, and thereby to induce the King of Sweden, the sooner to hasten and
promote the same. So we do most assuredly and earnestly hope and believe, that
by the Almightyes assistance, and the piety, love, faith, and justice of the
cause, as also by the assistance of all Christian Kings, Princes, and
Commonwealths, but especially by your Majesty's (who by a successive and
particular due bears the Title of the most Christian and Equitable King) this
design will be seconded: remaining also confident that your Majesty will join
with us herein; that all the Merchants, and Negotiants, throughout the whole
world, may not, by the Swedes, attaining to the absolute Dominion of the
Baltic Seas, be made Tributaryes, and enforced to pay Taxes, and Impositions,
unto them to all perpetuity. To the great prejudice, and damage of all other
Kingdoms.

Herewith we recommend your Majesty to the Almighty's Protection, wishing you
all happiness and prosperity in your undertakings.

Given in our Castle at Collen on the Spree, on the seventeenth day of
September, 1658.
FINIS.
