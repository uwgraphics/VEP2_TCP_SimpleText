An Ordinance of the Lords and Commons assembled in Parliament, Concerning
diverse ill-affected persons and Papists within the Counties of Denbigh,
Mountgomery, Flint, Merioneth, Carnarvon, and Anglesey, etc.
Die Lunae, 12. Iunii, 1643.
Whereas the Lords and Commons now assembled in Parliament, have received
credible Information that very many Papists, notorious Delinquents, and other
ill-affected persons inhabiting within the several counties of Denigb,
Mountgomery, and Flint, in the Dominion of Wales, have in mere opposition to,
and contempt of the power and authority of this present Parliament, entered
into an hostile and dangerous Association amongst themselves, and with many
other persons of like condition with them, inhabiting in other adjacent
counties, for the raising and promoting of an intestine and civil War within
this Kingdom: and in pursuance thereof, have (contrary to their allegiance)
levied, and do daily levy great forces both of horse and foot within their said
several counties, compelling the common people by Impressed, Imprisonment, and
other violent courses, to enter into acts of hostility and rebellion with them,
and enforcing the Inhabitants of the said counties, by illegal, unjust, and
insupportable taxations, to support and maintain them in their said Rebellion
and Force, contrary not only to the ancient known laws of this Kingdom; but
also to several Acts made and consented unto by his Majesty this present
Parliament: and multitudes of his Majesty's good protestant subjects have been,
and daily are robbed of all their estates, imprisoned, ruined, and destroyed by
them; Which proceedings of the said persons, do tend not only to the
disturbance of the peace, and tranquillity of this Kingdom; but also to the
subversion of the fundamental Government thereof, and of the protestant
religion therein professed, in case they should receive into their aid and
assistance any considerable number of the Irish Rebels, which is not
improbable; It being the aim (as it is probable) of all the papists now in
arms in this Kingdom, and in the Kingdom of Ireland, to free themselves from
the Laws established against them, and the cruel and bloody outrages committed
by them upon the protestants of both Kingdoms, (in ruining whole families,
consuming by fire whole towns, and using his Majesty's Name for their
authority to countenance their treasonable practices) making it evident to all
men, that the said Rebellion and civil War in both Kingdoms, have sprang
from the same Root, and must needs live and dye together; The said Lords and
Commons taking the same into their serious considerations, do hold it
necessary (for the more speedy suppressing of the said Rebellion, and reducing
of the said Papists, Delinquents, and ill affected persons to their due
obedience) that the said several counties of Denbigh, Mountgomery, Flint,
Merioneth, Carnarvon, and Anglesey, and the adjacent counties, be with all
convenient speed secured, as well from insurrection, as foreign Invasion, being
seated on the Irish Coasts.

Be it therefore ordained by the Lords and Commons in Parliament assembled,
That the Lord-Lieutenants for the said several counties, and all Colonells,
Lieutenant-colonells, Serjeant-Majors, Captains, and other officers, and all
other persons well affected to the protestant Religion, and the peace of the
Kingdom, inhabiting within the said several counties, shall, and lawfully may
associate themselves together; and likewise enter into mutual association to,
and with the said several Lord-Lieutenants, Committee, or Committees of
Parliament, Colonels, Lieutenant Colonells, Sergeant Majors, Captains, and
other Officers, and all other person or persons inhabiting within the several
counties of Chester, the county of the city of Chester, and the counties of
Salop and Lancaster, and any other adjacent county or counties, and actually
aid, succor, and assist one another, in the mutual preservation and defense
of themselves, and of the peace of all the said counties, from all rapine,
plundering, and spoiling by the said Delinquents, papists, and other the said
ill-affected persons; And that the said Lord-Lieutenants, Committee, or
Committees of Parliament, Colonells, Lieutenant-colonells, Sergeant Majors,
Captains, and other Officers, shall have have power to raise forces of horse
and foot, and to lead them into any place, or places, which shall be fitting
and convenient, either within, or out of all, or any of the said several
counties: And to give battle to, and to fight with all such forces as are, or
shall be raised against the Parliament, and against all other forces raised* or
to be raised without authority and consent of both Houses of Parliament; and
likewise against all such persons as do, or shall make any insurrection, or
otherwise plunder or destroy any of his Majesty's good subjects, and them to
invade, resist, suppress, subdue, pursue, kill, slay, and put to execution of
death, and by all means to destroy, as enemies to this Kingdom: and also to
perform all other things needful for the preservation of the safety and peace
of all the said several counties, cities, and parts adjacent; observing from
time to time such other directions and commands, as they shall receive from
both Houses of Parliament, or from his Excellency the Earl of ESSEX Lord
General, And that all the said persons and other the Inhabitants of the
aforesayed several Counties, that shall enter into any such said Association,
by virtue of this present Ordinance, or do any other act or acts in obedience
to, and pursuance of this, or any other Ordinance of the two Houses of
Parliament, shall for his, and their so doings, be saved, defended, and kept
harmless by the power and authority of Parliament. And the said Lords and
Commons taking likewise into their serious considerations, as well the danger
this whole Kingdom is likely to fall into, if any of the Irish Rebels, or other
foreign Forces should land in any of the aforesaid several Counties, being
Maritine, and bordering on the Irish Seas, and should join with the said
Delinquents, papists, and other the said ill-affected persons, now already in
arms against the Parliament; as also the necessity of appointing a Commander of
the Forces which shall be raised within the said several Counties of Denbigh,
Mountgomery, Flint, Merioneth, Carnarvon, and Anglesey, or in any of them for
the aforesaid service, do Ordain, That the said Earl of Essex, the Lord
General, shall be desired to grant Commssion unto Sir Thomas Middleton Knight,
being one of the Members of Parliament, to command in chief, as Sergeant Major
General of all the Forces both of Horse and Foot, raised, or to be raised in
all or any of the said several Counties of Denbigh, Mountgomery, Flint,
Merioneth, Carnarvon and Anglesey, or in any of them for the service aforesaid;
and to have power to lead, command, and carry the same to such place and
places, within the said several Counties or without, as he shall think fit and
necessary, for the mutual defense, assistance, and aid of all the said
several Counties; and for the preservation of the peace of them or any of
them; and likewise to give the same Order and Instructions in his said
Excellencies absence, for Regulating of the Soldiers, which are or shall be
under his Command, as his Excellency has given to his army; and to use
Martial Law to compel obedience thereunto, as occasion shall require; and
also to make, nominate, and appoint all other Commanders under him, for the
levying, raising, conducting, and leading of the said Forces, as he shall from
time to time think fitting; and to raise Soldiers in all, or any of the said
several Counties for the aforesaid service.

And whereas the Inhabitants of the said several Counties of Denbigh,
Mountgomery, Flint, Merioneth, Carnarvon and Anglesey, are now wholly subjected
to the power and Tyranny of the Commissioners of Array, and others of the said
Delinquents, by reason whereof, no Commissioners have been named for the
putting in execution of any of the Ordinances of Parliament, in any of the said
Counties, (the well-affected in those parts being overawed.

Be it therefore further Ordained, That the said Sir Thomas Middleton shall
have full power and authority, and is hereby authorized, to name and appoint
Commissioners, Soliciters, and Agents, for the putting in execution the
Ordinance for the seizing and sequestring of the Estates, as well real as
personal, of certain notorious Delinquents, in the said several Counties of
Denbigh, Mountgomery, Flint, Merioneth, Carnarvon, and Anglesey, and every of
them; and to require, and take account or accounts from time to time, of such
said Commissioners, Soliciters, or Agents, of their and every of their doings
and proceedings therein; and to receive into his charge and custody all such
sums of Moneys, Horses, Cattle, Plate, Goods, and other things whatsoever which
shall be seized and sequestered, in all or any of the said last mentioned
several Counties, by virtue of the said Ordinance of Sequestration; and the
same to detain and keep for the public service and employment of the
Parliament and Kingdom, rendering an account thereof to the two Houses of
Parliament only, or to such persons as they shall appoint; and to receive the
submission of such persons inhabiting within the said several Counties or any
of them, as shall upon due summons come in, and yield obedience to the power
and authority of the two Houses of Parliament, and willingly aid and assist the
said Sir Thomas Middleton in the said service; and to forbear to put the said
Ordinance of sequestration in execution against the said persons, until the
further pleasure of the two Houses of Parliament be signified therein.

And be it further ordained, that the said Sir Thomas Middleton, shall have
full power and authority, and hereby is authorized to impose, and say such
assessments and taxes upon the said several counties of Denbigh, Mountgomery,
Flint, Merioneth, Carnarvon, and Anglesey, for the maintenance of the forces
according to the several Ordinances for the levying of money, which shall be
raised for the preservation of the peace of the said counties, and reducing of
the said papists and Delinquents to their due obediences, to the power and
authority of Parliament; and to cause the same by distress, or otherwise, to
be levied upon the Inhabitants of the said counties accordingly, Rendering an
account thereof to the two Houses of Parliament: and if any person or persons
so assessed, or taxed, shall refuse to pay his, or their assessment, or convey
away his, or their goods, or other personal estate, so as the sums of moneys
so assess'd or taxed, cannot be levied according to this Ordinance, Then the
said Sir Thomas Middleton shall have power, and is hereby authorized by
himself, or such other persons as he shall appoint, to seize, and sequester,
the estates, both real, and personal, of all and every such person and
persons as shall so refuse to pay his, or their assessments, or shall convey
away, or obscure his, or their personal estates, or any part thereof as
aforesaid: so that the same cannot be found or met with, whereon to make
distress, as being persons ill-affected to the commonwealth, and refractory
and disobedient to the power and authority of Parliament, and to detain, and
keep the same for the public service of the Parliament and Kingdom; Rendering
an account thereof to the two Houses of Parliament.

ORdered by the Commons assembled in Parliament, That this Ordinance be
forthwith printed and published.
