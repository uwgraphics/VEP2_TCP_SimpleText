A Proclamation for the bringing into the Port of London, any manner of Fevvell.
THE Lord Mayor and Aldermen his Brethren, having taken into their serious
consideration, the great scarcity and want of Fuel, for the necessary and
needful use of this City, and Liberties thereof. And finding it a very hard
and difficult matter to supply the same in these troublesome times, by reason
that Newcastle from whence this City was formerly stored, is blocked up. The
Lord Mayor with the advice of his said Brethren, the Aldermen, to give
encouragement to all those that shall out of their good affection and charity
toward this City, adventure to bring Seacoales, Pitcoales, or any other manner
of Fuel from any part of this kingdom, into the Port of London, for the use
and benefit of the Inhabitants thereof, and parts adjacent; especially of the
poor and needy, which heretofore were yearly provided for by the provident
care of this City, from Newcastle. Has thought fit hereby to publish and
declare, that such persons shall have free leave and liberty, at their pleasure
to vend and put to sail within this City and Liberties thereof, whatsoever
fuel they shall bring hither, for the use and purpose aforesaid, and shall be
accounted men well affected to this City: And their doings and actions herein,
shall be taken as a very acceptable service to this City, and not to be
forgotten.

Dated at the Guildhall, London, this 27 day of June, 1644.
Printed by Richard Cotes, Printer to the Honorable City of LONDON.
