The Lord General CROMWELL His Speech, At the Councel-Chamber, July 4. 1653.
GENTLEMEN,
I Suppose the Summons that has been instrumental to bring you hither, gives
you well to understand the cause of your being here. Howbeit, having some
things to impart, which is an Instrument drawn up by the consent and advice of
the principal Officers of the Army, which is a little (as we conceive) more
significant, then that other of Summons: we have that here to tender you. And
we have somewhat likewise further to say to you, for our own exoneration; and
we hope it may be somewhat further to your satisfaction. And therefore seeing
you sit here somewhat uneasy, by reason of the scantness of the Room, and the
heat of the Weather, I shall contract my self with respect to that.

I have not thought it amiss, a little to mind you of that Series of
providence, wherein the Lord hitherto has dispensed wonderful things to these
Nations, from the beginning of our Troubles to this very day. If I should look
much backward, we might remember the state of affairs as they were before the
short, and that which was the last Parliament: in what a posture the things of
this Nation stood, does so well, I presume, occur to all your memories and
knowledges, that I shall not need to look so far backward, nor yet to the
beginning of those Hostile actions that past between the King that was, and the
then-Parliament. And indeed, should I begin this labor, the things that would
fall necessarily before you, would rather be fit for a History, then for a
Discourse, at this present.

But thus far we may look back: You very well know, after diverse turnings of
affairs, it pleased God, much about the midst of this War, to winnow, as I may
so say, the Forces of this Nation, and to put them into the hands of men of
other Principles then those that did engage at the first. By what strange
providence that also was brought about, would ask more time then is allotted
me, to remember you of. Indeed, there are Stories that do recite those
transactions, and give Narratives of matter of fact: but those things wherein
the life and power of them lay, those strange windings and turnings of
Providence, those very great appearances of God, in crossing and thwarting the
designs of men, that he might raise up a poor and a contemptible company of
men, neither versed in Military affairs, nor having much natural propensity to
them, even through the owning of a Principle of Godliness, of Religion: which
so soon as it came to be owned, the state of affairs put upon that foot of
account, how God blessed them, and all undertakings, by the rising of that most
improbable, despicable, contemptible means; for that we must for ever own, you
very well know.

What the several successes have been, is not fit to mention at this time,
neither; though I must confess I thought to have enlarged my self upon this
Subject, forasmuch as the considering the works of God, and the operation of
his hands, is a principal part of our duty, and a great encouragement to the
strengthening of our hands, and of our faith for that which is behind. And then
having given us those marvelous dispensations, amongst other ends, for that was
a most principal end, as to us, in this revolution of affairs, and issues of
those Successes God was pleased to give this Nation, and the Authority that
then stood, were very great things brought about; besides those dints that were
upon those Nations and places where they were carried on, even in the Civil
affairs, to the bringing offenders to Justice, even the greatest; to the
bringing the state of this Government to the name at least of a Commonwealth;
to the searching and sifting of all Places and Persons; the King removed, and
brought to justice, and many great ones with him; the House of Peers laid
aside; the House of Commons, the Representative of the people of England, it
self, winnowed, sifted, and brought to a handful, as you may very well remember.

And truly God would not rest there, (for, by the way, although it be fit for
us to entitle our failings and miscarriages to our selves, yet the gloriousness
of the work may well be attributed to God himself, and may be called his
strange Work.)

You may remember well, that at the change of the Government there was not an
end of our Troubles, although that year were such things transacted, as indeed
made it to be the most memorable year (I mean, 1648.) that ever this Nation
saw; so many Insurrections, Invasions, secret Designs, open and public
Attempts, quashed in so short a time, and this by the very signal appearances
of God himself, I hope we shall never forget.

You know also, (as I said before) that as the effect of that memorable year
1648. was to lay the Foundation of bringing Delinquents to punishment; so it
was of the change of the Government: although it be true, if we had time to
speak, the carriages of some in trust, in most eminent trust, was such, as
would have frustrated to us the hopes of all our Undertakings, had not God
miraculously prevented: I mean, by that Closure that would have been
endeavored by the King, whereby we should have put into his hands all that
Cause and Interest we had opposed, and had had nothing to have secured us, but
a little piece of Paper.

But things going out, how it pleased the Lord to keep this Nation in exercise
both at Sea and Land, and what God wrought in Ireland and Scotland, you
likewise know, until the Lord had finished all that trouble, upon the matter, by
the marvelous salvation wrought at Worcester.

I confess to you, I am very much troubled in my spirit, that the necessity of
affairs does require that I should be so short in these things, because I told
you before, This is the leanest part of the transaction, to wit, an Historical
Narration; there being in every Dispensation, (whether the King's going from
the Parliament, the pulling down the Bishops, purging the House at that time by
their going away to assist the King, change of Government) whatever it was, not
any of those things, but has a remarkable point of Providence set upon it,
that he that runs may read. Therefore I am heartily sorry, that in point of
time I cannot be particular in those things which I did principally design
this day, thereby to provoke and stir up your hearts and mine to gratitude and
confidence.

I shall now begin a little to remember you the passages that have been
transacted since Worcester-fight; whence coming with my fellow-Officers and
Soldiers, we expected, and had some reasonable confidence, that our
expectations should not be frustrate, That the Authority that then was, having
such a History to look back unto, such a God that appeared for them so
eminently, so visibly, that even our enemies many times confessed that God
himself was engaged against them, or they should never have been brought so
low, nor disappointed in every undertaking: for that may be said (by the way)
had we miscarried but once, where had we been? I say, We did think, and had
some reasonable confidence, that coming up then, the mercies that God had
showed, the expectations that were in the hearts of all good men, would have
prompted those that were in Authority to have done those good things, which
might by honest men have been judged a return fit for such a God, and worthy of
such mercies, and indeed, a discharge of duty to those, for whom all these
mercies have been showed, that is, the Interest of the three Nations, The true
Interest of the three Nations.

And if I should now labor to be particular in enumerating some businesses
that have been transacted from that time, till the dissolution of the late
Parliament, indeed I should be upon a Theme would be very troublesome to my
self. For I must say for my self and fellow-Officers, we have rather desired
and studied healing, then to rake into sores, and look backward, to render
things in those colors that would not be very well pleasing to any good eye to
look upon. Only this we must say, for our own exoneration, and as thereby
laying some foundation for the making evident the necessity and duty that was
incumbent upon us, to make this last great Change, I think it will not be amiss
to offer a word or two in that, not taking pleasure to rake into the business,
were not there some kind of necessity so to do.

Indeed we may say, without commending our selves, I mean my self and those
Gentlemen that have been engaged in the Military affairs, that upon our return
we came, fully bent in our hearts and thoughts, to desire and use all fair and
lawful means we could, to have had the Nation to reap the fruit of all that
blood and treasure that had been expended, in this cause, and we have had many
desires, and thirstings, in our spirits, to find out ways and means, wherein
we might any ways, be isntrumental, to help it forward, and we were very
tender, for a long time, so much as to Petition, till August last, or
thereabouts; we never offered to Petition, but some of our then Members, and
others, having good acquaintance and relation to diverse members of the
Parliament; we did from time to time solicit, that which we thought (if there
had been no body to prompt them, no body to call upon them) would have been
listed too, out of ingenuity and integrity in them that had opportunity to have
answered our expectations; and and truly when we saw nothing would be done, we
did as we thought according to our duty, reminde them by a Petition, which
Petition, I suppose the most of you have seen which we delivered, either in
July or August last, what effect that had is likewise very well known; the
truth is, we had no return at all, that the satisfaction for us, was but a few
words given us, the business petitioned for, most of them, (we were told) were
under consideration; And those that were not, had very little or no
consideration at all.

Finding the people dissatisfied, in every corner of the Nation, and bringing
home to our doors the none performance of those things, that had been
promised, and were of due to be performed, we did think our selves concerned,
we endeavored as became honest men, to keep up the reputation of honest men in
the world; and therefore we had diverse times, endeavored to obtain a meeting,
with diverse Members of Parliament; and truly we did not begin this, till
October last, and in those meetings did in all faithfulness and sincerity,
beseech them, that they would be mindful of their duty to God and man; and of
the discharge of their trust to God and man: I believe these Gentlemen that are
many of them here; can tell, that we had at the least ten or twelve meetings,
most humbly begging and beseeching them, that of their own accords, they would
do those good things, that had been promised, that so it might appear, they did
not do them, by any suggestion from the Army, but of their own ingenuity, so
tender were we to preserve them in the reputation and opinion of the people, to
the uttermost. And having had, many of those meetings and declaring, plainly
that the issue, would be the judgment and displeasure of God against them; the
dissatisfaction of the People, and the putting things into a confusion: Yet how
little we did prevail, we well know, and we believe is not unknown to you; at
the last when we saw indeed that things would not be laid to heart, we had a
serious consideration amongst our selves, what other way to have recourse unto;
And when indeed we came to those close considerations, they began to take the
Act of the new Representative to heart, and seemed exceeding willing to put it
on, the which, had it been done, or would it have been done, with that
integrity, with that caution, that would have saved, this Cause and the
Interest, we have been so long engaged in; there could nothing have happened to
our judgments, more welcome then that would have bin; but finding plainly, that
the intendment of it was not to give the people that Right of Choice, althought
it had been, but aseding right either the seeming, to give the people that
Choice intended and designed, to recrute the House, the better to perpetuat
themselves: And truly having diverse of us, spoken to, to that end that we
should give way to it, a thing, to which we had a perpetual aversation; which
we did abominate the thoughts of, we always declared our judgments against
it, and our dissatisfaction; but yet they would not hear of a Representative,
before it lay three years before them, without proceeding with one line
considerably in it; they that could not endure to hear of it, then, when we
came to our close considerations, then instead of protracting, they did make as
much preposterous have, of the other hand, and ran into that extremity, and
finding that this spirit, was not accoridng to God, and that the whole weight of
this Cause, which must needs have been very dear unto us, who have so often
adventured our lives for it; and we believe is so to you, when we saw plainly
that there was not so much consideration how to assert it, or to provide
security for it; and indeed to cross these, that they reckoned the most
troublesome people they had to deal with, which was the Army, which by this
time was sufficiently their displeasure: when we saw this, truly, that had
power in our hands to let the business go to such an issue as this, was to throw
back the cause into the hands of them we first fought with, we came to this
first conclusion amongst our selves, that if we had bin fought out of it,
necessity would have taught us patience, but to be taken from us so unworthily,
we should be rendered the worst people in the world, and we should become
traitors both to God and man: and when God had laid this to our hearts, and
that we found the interest of his people was grown cheap, and not laid to heart
and if we came to competition of things, the cause even among themselves, would
even almost in every thing go to the ground, this did add more consideration
to us, that there was a duty incumbent upon us, and truly I speak it in the
presence of some that are here, that were at the close consultations (I may
say) as before the Lord, the thinking of an act of violence was to us worse
than any Engagement that ever we were in yet; and worse to us than the utmost
hazard of our lives, that could be, so unwilling were we, so tender were we, so
desirous were we, if it were possible, that these men might have quit their
places with honur: And truly, this I am the longer upon, because it has been
in our hearts and consciences, our Justification, and has never yet been
imparted through to the Nation, and we had rather begin with you to do it, than
to have done it before, and do think indeed, that these transactions be more
proper for a verbal communication, than to have put it into writing; I doubt
whosoever had put it on, would have been tempted to have dipped his pen, in anger
and wrath, but affairs being at this posture, that we saw plainly and evidently
in some Critical things, that the Cause of the people of God was a despised
thing, truly then we did believe that the hands of other men, must be the hands
that must be trusted with it, and then we thought high time for us, to look
about us, and to be sensible of our duty. If I should take up your time, to
tell you, what instances we have to satissie our Judgments and Consciences,
that these were most vain imaginations, and things that were petitioned for,
but that fell within the compass of our certain knowledge, and sense; should I
repeat these things to you. I should do that which I would avoid, to rake into
these things too much; only this, if any body were in competition, for any
place of real and final Trust, how hard and difficult a thing it were to get
any thing to be carried, without making parties; without things indeed,
unworthy of a Parliament. And when things must be carried so in a Supreme
Authority; indeed I think, it is not as it ought to be: but when it came to
other Trialls, in that Case of Wales, which I must confess, for my own part, I
set my self upon, if I should inform what discountenance that business of the
poor people of God, there had, who had watchings over them, men like so many
wolves, ready to catch the Lamb, as soon as it was brought out into the world:
how signally they threw that business under foot, to the discountenancing of
the honest people there; and to the countenancing of the malignant party of
this Commonwealth. I need but say, it was so; many have felt by sad experience
it was so: who will better impart that business to you? which for my self and
fellow officers, I think it was as perfect trial of their spirits, as any
thing, it being known to many of us, that God kindles a seed there, indeed
hardly to be paralel'd since the Primitive times, I would this had been all the
instances; but finding which way their spirits went, and finding that good was
never intended to the people of God, (I mean when I say so) that large
comprehension of them, under the several forms of godliness in this Nation;
when I saw that tenderness was forgotten, to them all (though it was very
true, that by their hands and means, through the blessing of God, they sat
where they did) and affrayes, not to speak it boastingly, had been
instrumentally brought to that issue they were brought to by the hands of those
poor creatures, we thought this an evil requital, I will not say they were at
the uttermost pitch of Reformation, although I could say, that one thing, the
regulation of the Law so much groaned under in that posture it now is in; there
was many words spoken for it, we know many months together, was not time
enough, to pass over one word called Encumbrances: I say, finding that this
was the spirit and complexion of them, that though these were faults, for which
no man should have dared to lift his hand, simply for their faults, and
failings, when yet we saw their Intendment was to perpetuate themselves, and
men of this spirit for some had it from their own mouths, from their own
designs, who could not endure to hear of being dissolved, this was an high
breach of Trust, if they had bin a Parliament, never violated, sitting as free,
and as clear as ever any sat in England; yet if they would go about to
perpetuate themselves, we did think this to be so high a breach of Trust, as
greater could not be; and we did not go by guess in this, and to be out of
doubt in it, we did, (having that conference among our selves, whereof we gave
account) we did desire once more the night before the dissolution, and it had
been in our desires, some two or three days before, that we might speak with
some of the principal persons of the House, that we might with enuity open our
hears to them, to the end we might be either convinced of the ground of their
principles, and intentions, to the good of the Nation; or if we could not be
convinced, they would hear our offer, or expedient to prevent this mischief;
and indeed we could not prevail for two or three days, till the night before
the dissolution; there is a touch of this in that our Declaration; we had often
desired it, at that time, we attained; there were above twenty of them who were
members not of the least consideration, for interest and ability, with whom we
desired to discourse those things, and had discourse with them; and it pleased
the Gentlemen Officers of the Army to desire me to offer their sense to them,
and indeed it was shortly carried thus, we told them, that the reason of our
desire to wait upon them, was that we might know from them what security, lay
in the way of their proceedings, so hastily with their Representative, wherein
they had made a few qualifications (such as they were) and how the whole
business should be executed, we have no account of, and we desired them they
would be pleased, and we thought we had an interest in our lives, estates, and
families, as well as the worst people of the Nation, and that we might be bold,
to ask satisfaction in that; and if they did proceed in honest ways, as might
be safe to the Nation, we might acquiesse therein: when we pressed them to give
satisfaction in this, the answer was made, that nothing could be good to the
Nation, but the continuance of this Parliament, we wondered that we should have
such a return, we said little to that.

But seeing they would not give us that which might satisfy us, that their way
was honest, and safe, they would give us leave to make our Objections; We did
tell them, that we thought that way they were going in would be
impracticable, we could not tell them how it would be brought to pass, to
send out an Act of Parliament into the Country, to have qualifications in an
Act to be the Rules of Electors, and Elected, and not to know who should
execute this; Desired to know whether the next Parliament were not like to
consist of all Presbyters? Whether those Qualifications would hinder them? or
Newters? and though it be our desire to value and esteem of that Judgment,
only they having been as we know, having deserted this cause and Interest,
upon the Kings account, and upon that closure between them and the Neighbor
Nation, we do think we must profess we had as good have delivered up our
Cause into the hands of any as into the hands of interessed and biased men,
for it is one thing to live friendly and brotherly, to bear with, and love a
person of another judgment in Religion, another thing to have any so far set
into the saddle upon that account, as that it should be in them, to have all
the rest of their Brethren at mercy; Having had this discourse, making these
Objections, of bringing in Neuters, or such as should impose upon their
Brethren, or such as had given testimony to the Kings party, and objecting to
the danger of it, in drawing the concourse of all people, to arraign every
individual person, which indeed did fall obviously in, and the issue would
certainly have been, the putting it into the hands of men that had little
affection to this cause. The answer again was made, and it was confessed by
some, that these objections did lie; But answer was made by a very eminent
person, at the same time as before, that nothing would save the Nation, but the
continuance of this Parliament, this being so, we humbly proposed an expedient
of ours, which was indeed, to desire that the Government being in that
condition it was, and things being under so much ill sense abroad, and so
likely to come to confusion in every respect, if it went on, so we desired
they would devolve the trust over to persons of honor and integrity, that were
well known, men well-affected to Religion, and the Interest of the Nation,
which we told them, and was confessed, had been no new thing when these Nations
had been under the like hurly burly and distractions, and it was confessed by
them, it had been no new thing; we had been at labor to get presidents to
convince them of it, and we told them these things we offered out of that deep
sense we had of the good of the Nations, and the Cause of Christ; And being
answered to that, nothing would save the Nation but the continuance of that
Parliament (although they would not say they would perpetuate it) at that time
least of all.

But finding their endeavors did directly tend to it, they gave us this
Answer, that the things we had offered were of a tender and very weighty
consideration; they did make objections how we should raise money, and some
other objections; we told them, that that we offered as an expedient, because
we thought better, then that for which no reason was, or thought would be
given; we desired them, to lay the thing seriously to heart, they told us,
they would take consideration of these things till the morning, that they would
sleep upon them, and I think that there was scarce any day, that there sat
above 50 or 52 or 53. At the parting two or three of the chief ones, the very
chiefest of them, did tell us, that they would endeavor the suspending the
proceedings of the Representative, the next day, till they had a further
conference, and we did acquiesce, and had hope if our expedient would take up a
loving debate, the next day we should have some such issue of our debate, as
would have given a satisfaction to all; they went away late at night, and the
next morning we considering how to order that which we had to offer to them,
when they were to meet in the Evening, word was brought they were proceeding
with a Representative, with all the eagerness they could; we did not believe
persons of such quality could do it; a second and a third Messenger told us,
they had almost finished it, and had brought it to that issue with that have
that had never been before, leaving out the things that did necessarily relate
to due qualifications, as we have heard since, resolved to make it a paper
Bill, not to ingrosse it, that they might make the quicker dispatch of it, thus
to have thrown all the liberties of the Nation into the hands that never bled
for it; upon this Account, we thought it our duty not to suffer it, and upon
this the House was dissolved.

This we tell you, that you may so know, that what has been done in the
dissolution of this Parliament, was as necessary to be done, as the
preservation of this cause; and that necessity that led us to do that, has
brought us to this issue, of exercising an extraordinary way, and course, to
draw your selves together upon this account, that you are men who know the
Lord, and have made observations of his mavelous dispensations, and may be
trusted with this cause. It remains, for I shall not acquaint you further with
that that relates to your taking upon you this great business, that being
contained in this paper, in my hand, which I do offer presently to you, to
read, having done that which we thought to have done upon this ground of
necessity, which we know was not feigned necessity but real, and true, to the
end the Government might not be at a loss, to the end we might manifest to
the world the singleness of our hearts, and integrity, who did those things
not to grasp after the power our selves to keep it in a military hand, no not
for a day, as far as God enables us with strength and ability, to put it into
the hands that might be called from several parts of the Nation; this
necessity I say, and we hope may say, for our selves, this integrity of
laboring to divest the Sword of the power and authority in the civil
administration of it, has been that that has moved us, to conclude of this
course, and having done that, we think we cannot with the discharge of our
consciences but offer somewhat unto you, as I said before, for our own
exoneration, it having been the practice of others who have voluntarily and out
of sense of duty divested themselves, and divolved the Government into the
hands of others, it having been the practice, where such things have been done,
and very consonant to reason, together with the authority, to lay a charge, in
such a way, as we hope we do, and to press to the duty, which we have a
word or two to offer to you. Truly God has called you to this work, by (I
think) as wonderful providence as ever past upon the sons of men in so short
a time, and truly I think, taking the arguments of necessity, for the
Government must not fall, take the appearances of the will of God in this
thing, I am sure you would have been loath it should have been resigned into
the hands of wicked men, and enemies; I am sure, God would not have it so, it
comes therefore to you by way of necessity, it comes to you by the way of the
wise Providence of God, though through weak hands, and therefore I think, it
coming through our hands, though such as we are, it may not be taken ill, if
we offer to you some thing as to the discharge of that trust which is
incumbent upon you; and although I seem to speak that which may have the face
of a charge, it is a very humble one, and he that means to be a servant to you,
who are called to the exercise of the supreme authority, to discharge that,
which he conceives is his duty, in his own and his fellows names, to you I hope
who will take it in good part, and truly I shall not hold you long in that,
because I hope it is written in your hearts, to approve your selves to God only,
this Scripture I shall remember to you, which has been much upon my spirit,
Hosea 11 and 12 verse, Yet Judah rules with God, and is faithful among the
Saints, it is said before, Ephraim did compass God about with lies, and Israel
with deceit, how God has been compassed about with fastings, and
Thanks-givings, and other exercises, and transactions, I think we have all to
lament; why truly you are called by God, to rule with him, and for him, and you
are called to be faithful, with the Saints, who have been somewhat
isntrumental to your call, he that rules over men (the Scripture says) he
must be just, ruling in the fear of God.

And truly it is better to pray for you than to counsel you in that, that you
may exercise the judgment of mercy, and truth; I say it is better for you to do
it, than to advise you to ask wisdom from heaven for you, which I am
confident many thousands of Saints do this day, and have done, and will do,
through the permission of God and his assistance, to advise you; only truly I
thought of a Scripture likewise that seems to be but a Scripture of common
application to every man as a Christian, wherein he is counseled to ask
wisdom, And he is told what is that Wisdom that is from above, it is pure,
peaceable, gentle, Easy to be entreated, full of good fruits, without
partiality, without hypocrisy; and my thoughts ran thus upon this, that the
executing of the judgment of truth, for that is the judgment that you must
have Wisdom from above for, and that is pure, that will teach you to execute
the judgment of truth, and then if God give you hearts to be easy to be
entreated, to be peaceable spirits, to be full of good fruits, bearing good
fruits to the Nation, to men as men, to the people of God, to all in their
several stations, this wisdom will teach you to execute the judgment of Mercy
and Truth; and I have little more to say to this, I shall rather bend my
prayers for you in that behalf (as I said before) and I know many others do
also. Truly the judgment of Truth will teach you to be as just toward an
Unbeleever as toward a Believer; and it is our duty to do so. I confess I
have often said it foolishly, if I would miscarry, I would rather do it to a
Believer than to an Unbeleever, perhaps it is a Paradox; but let us take heed
of doing it to either, exercising injustice to either; if God fill our hearts
with such a spirit as Moses and Paul had, which was not only a spirit for the
Believers among the people of God, but for the whole people, he would have
dyed for them, and so Paul to his Countrymen according to the flesh, he could
have dyed for them, truly this will help us to execute the judgment of Truth
and Mercy also.

A second thing is, to desire you would be faithful with the Saints, and I
hope, whatever others may think, ought to be to us all matter of rejoicing,
that as one person our Savior was touched with our infirmities, that he might
be pitiful, I do think this Assembly thus called, is very much touched with
the common infirmity of the Saints, and I hope that will teach you to pity
others, that so Saints of one sort may not be our interest, but that we may
have respect unto all, though of different judgments; And if I did seem to
speak any thing that might seem to reflect upon those of the Presbyterian
Judgment, I think, if you have not an interest of love for them, will hardly
answer this faithfulness to his Saints; I confess, in my pilgrimage, and some
exercises I have had abroad, I did read that Scripture often in Isaiah 41. and
19. When God gave me and some of my fellows, what he would there and
elsewhere, which he performed for us, and what would he do? to what end? That
he might plant in the Wilderness the Cedar, and the Shitta tree, and the
Myrtle tree and the Palm tree together. To what end? That they might know, and
consider, and understand together, that the hand of the Lord has done this;
And that the Lord has created it, that he wrought all salvation and
deliverance, which he has wrought, for the good of the whole flock; therefore
I beseech you (but I think I need not) have a care of the whole flock, love all
the Sheep, love the Lambs, love all, and tender all, and cherish all, and
countenance all, in all things that are good; And if the poorest Christian, the
most mistaken Christian, should desire to live peaceably and quietly under you,
soberly and humbly desire to lead a life in godliness and honesty, let him be
protected.

I think I need as little advise you concerning the propagation of the Gospel,
and encouraging such Ministers, and such a Ministry, as be faithful in the
Land, upon whom the true character is, Men that have truly received the spirit
for such a use, which Christians will be well able to discern, and do, men
that have received Gifts from him that ascended on high, and led Captivity
Captive, for the work before mentioned and truly the Apostle Romans 12 when he
had summoned up all the Mercies of God, and the goodness of God, and has
discoursed of the foundations of the Gospel, and of the several things that
are the subject of his discourse, in the 11 first Chapters, after he has
besought them to offer up their Souls and Bodies a living sacrifice to God,
he beseeches not to esteem more highly of themselves than they ought, but
that they would be humble and sober minded, and not stretch themselves beyond
their Line, but they would have a care to those that had received Gifts to
these uses there mentioned. I speak not, it is far from my heart, for a
Ministry deriving it self through the Papacy, and pretending to that which is
so much insisted upon to be succession, the true succession is through the
Spirit, given in that measure that the Spirit is given, and that is a right
succession; but I need not discourse of these things to you, I am persuaded you
are taught of God, in a greater measure than my self in these things; indeed I
have but one word more to say, and that is, though in that perhaps I shall show
my weakness, it is by way of encouragement to you, to go on in this work.

And give me leave to begin thus, I confess I never looked to see such a day
as this, it may be nor you, when Jesus Christ shall be owned as he is this
day, and in this world, Jesus Christ is owned this day by you all, and you own
him by your willingness in appearing here, and you manifest this (as far as
poor creatures can) to be a day of the power of Christ by your willingness, I
know you remember that Scripture in Psalm 110.3. The people shall be willing in
the day of thy Power; God does manifest it to be a day of the Power of Jesus
Christ.

Having through so much blood and so much trialls as have been upon these
Nations, made this to be one of the great issues thereof, to have a people
called to the Supreme Authority upon an avowed Account, God has owned his Son
by this, and you by your Willingness do own Jesus Christ, and therefore for
my part I confess I did never look to see such a sight, perhaps you are not
known by face one to another; but we must tell you this, that indeed we have
not allowed our selves in the choice of one person, in whom we had not this
good hope, that there was Faith in Jesus Christ, and love unto all his Saints
and people: And thus God has owned you in the face and eyes of the world, and
thus by your coming hither have you owned him, as it is in Isaiah 43.21. It is
an high expression, and look to your own hearts, whether now or hereafter God
shall apply it to you: This people (says he) I have formed for my self, that
they might show forth my praise. It is a memorable place, and I hope not
unfitly applied, God apply it to each of your hearts. I shall not descant upon
the words, they are plain, you are as like the forming of God as ever people
were, if any man should ask you one by one, and should tender a Book to you,
you would dare to swear, that neither directly nor indirectly did you seek to
come hither; you have been passive in coming hither, in being called hither,
and that is an active word, This People I have formed, Consider the
circumstances, by which you are called together, through what difficulties,
through what strivings, through what blood you are come hither; Neither you nor
I, nor no man living, three months ago, had a thought to have seen such a
company, taking upon them, or rather being called to the supreme authority, and
therefore know your are called.

Indeed I think, as it may be truly said, that never was a supreme authority,
consisting of so numerous a Body as you are, which I believe are above 140,
were even in the supreme authority, under such a Nation, in such a way of
owning of God, and being owned by him, and therefore I say also, never a people
formed for such a purpose (so called) if it were time to compare your standing
with those that have been called by the suffrages of the people, who can tell
how soon God may fit the People for such a thing, and who would desire any
thing more in the world, but that it might be so? I would all the Lords people
were prophets, I would they were fit to be called, and fit to call, and it is
the longing of our hearts to see them once own the interest of Jesus Christ,
and give me leave to say, if I know any thing in the world, what is there like
to win the people to the Interest and love of God? nay, what a duty will lie
upon you to have your conversation such, as that they may love you, that they
may see you lay out your time and spirits for them? Is not this the most likely
way to bring them to their Liberties? and do you not by this put it upon God to
find the time and the season for it? by pouring forth his Spirit, at least by
convincing them, that as men fearing God have sought them out of their
thraldom, and bondage, under the Legal power, so men fearing God rule them in
the fear of God, and take care to administer good unto them; but this is some
digression. (I say) own your call, for indeed it is mavelous, and it is of
God, and it has been unprojected, unthought of by you and us, and that has
been the way God has dealt with us all along, to keep things from our eyes,
that what we have acted, we have seen nothing before us, which also is a
witness in some measure to our integrity; (I say) you are Called with a high
Call, and why should we be afraid to say, or think, that this way may be the
door to usher in things that God has promised and prophesied of, and to set
the hearts of his people to wait for, and expect? We know who they are that
shall war with the Lamb against his Enemies, They shall be a people, called,
chosen and faithful, and has in the Military way (we must speak it without
flattery) I believe you know it, he has acted with them, and for them, and
now in the Civil power and Authority, and these are not ill Prognostications
for that good we wait for; indeed, I do think something is at the door, we are
at the threshold, and therefore it becomes us to lift up our heads, and to
encourage our selves in the Lord, and we have some of us thought it our duty to
endeavor this way, not vainly looking on that Prophecy in Daniel, And the
Kingdom shall not be delivered to another people. Truly God has brought it
into your hands, by his owning, and blessing, and calling out a Military Power,
God has persuaded their hearts to be instrumental in calling you, and this
has been set upon our hearts, and upon all the faithful in the Land, it may be
that it is not our duty to deliver it over to any other people, and that
Scripture may be fulfilling now to us, but I may be beyond my line.

But I thank God I have my hopes exercised in these things, and so I am
persuaded are yours; truly seeing that these things are so, that you are at the
edge of the Promises and Prophecies, at least if there were neither Promise for
this nor Prophecy, your coveting the best things, endeavoring after the best
things, and as I have said elsewhere, if I were to choose the meanest Officer in
the Army, or Commonwealth, I would choose a godly Man that has Principles,
especially where trust is to be committed, because I know where to have a man
that has Principles; I believe if any man of you should choose a Servant, you
would do so, and I would all our Magistrates were so chosen, that may be some
effects of this; it is our duty to choose men that fear the Lord, to praise the
Lord, yea such as the Lord forms for himself, andhe expects not praises from
others; this being so, it puts me in mind of another Scripture, Psalm. 68.
which indeed is a glorious Prophecy, and I am persuaded of the Gospel, or it
may be of the Jews; also there it is Prophesied, He will bring his people again
out of the depths of the Sea, as once he led Israel through the red Sea; and it
may be some do think God is bringing the Jews home to their station from the
Isles of the Sea, surely when God sets up the glory of the Gospel Church, it
shall be gathering people out of deep waters, out of the multitude of waters;
such are his people, drawn out of the multitudes of the Nations, and people of
the world. And that Psalm will be very glorious in many other parts of it, When
he gave the word, great was the company, of them that published it; Kings of
the Armies did fly apace, and she that tarried at home divided the spoil, and
although ye have lain among the Pots, yet shall ye be as the wings of a Dove
covered with silver, and her feathers with yellow gold. And indeed the triumph
of that Psalm is exceeding high and great, and God is accompl^shing it; and the
cloze of it, that closes with my heart and I am persuaded will with yours
also; That God shakes Hills and Mountains, and they reel, and God has a Hill
too, and his hill is as the hill of Bashan, and the Chariots of God are twenty
thousand of Angels, and God will dwell upon this hill for ever. Truly I am
sorry that I have troubled you, in such a place of heat as this is, so long;
all that I have to say in mine own name, and in the names of my Fellow Officers
(who have joined with me in this Work) That we shall commend you to the Grace
of God, and to the guidance of his Spirit, having thus far served you (or
rather our Lord Jesus Christ in it) we are, as we hope, and shall be, ready in
our stations, according as the Providence of God shall lead us, to be
subservient to the Work of God, and the Authority (which we reckon) God has
set over us. And although we have no Formal thing to present you with, to which
the hands and outward visible expressions of the hearts of the Officers of the
three Nations are set, yet we may say for them, and we may say also with
confidence for our Brethren at Sea, with whom neither in Scotland, nor Ireland,
nor at Sea has any Artifice been used to persuade their Approbations to this
work; yet we can say, That their consent and affections has flowed in to us
from all parts beyond our expectations, and we are confident we may say with
all confidence, That we have had their approbations, and full consent, unsought
indeed to the other work, so that you have their hearts and affections in this;
and not only they, but we have very many Papers from the Churches of God,
throughout the Nation, wonderfully both approving what has been done in
removing Obstacles, and approving what we have done in this very thing. And
having said this I shall trouble you no more, but if you will be pleased that
this Instrument may be read, which I have Signed by the advice of the Council
of Officers, we shall then leave you to your own thoughts, and to the guidance
of God, to order and dispose of your selves for further Meetings as you shall
see cause.

FINIS.
