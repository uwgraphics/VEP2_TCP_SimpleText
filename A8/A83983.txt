Veritas. Heresia. Hendrick La^^^tz ex^^d. 1641


Englands Petition, to her gracious King,
That he Arminius, would to ruin bring,
Who, by his Doctrine, privy plous, and hate
To Verity, does ruin Church and State. etc:

Great King protect us with thy gracious hand,
Or else Arminius will ore spread this Land:
For if in England the enemy does appear,
This is the shape of him we need to fear.
He raises Factions, and that brings in iarres,
Which broacheth Errors, and vpholds the wars
The netherlands ruin he sought to bring,
In England now he does the self same thing.
To rail, to write, to publish bitter gall,
To change Religion and subuertus all
His squint-eyed looks and linsie-wolsie gown,
Shows how Religion he will soon throw down.
His grinding pate with wether-cocks turned brain
Seeks the churches tenants for to stain:
The crystal streams of truth he shuns most pure,
The trial of Gods word he will not endure:
But unto Error cast his blinking eye,
Presuming Truth does not the same epsy.
Heresy upon a stately Beast does stand.
Arminius bids him welcome holds his hand,
Truth by her brightness, and her sincere heart,
Shows that with Heresy she takes no part.
Treads on their Mountebanke and Cozning tricks
Blown in his ears by Pelagius and Jesuits.
Which makes his windmill for promotions grace,
Publish his books abroad in every place:
And begs protection for his works of wonder,
Which against truth he bellows forth like thunder.
Thus does Arminius to preferment rise,
By Equiuocating and his Cheuerill lies:
And truth to all appeals to open view,
Bidding all heresies for ere adieu.
Desiring our great CHARLES to take to heart,
And by the Parliament make Arminius smart
Which being done, England shall euerblesse
The King the state, the Churches happiness.
And if for telling truth I burn or fry,
What then deserves he that tells a lie!
