The Age and Life of MAN.
Here you may see the frailty that is in Men, Till they have run the years
threescore and ten.
Tune of Jane shore
1. When man is born he in a Cradle hides
7. At one time seven a Hoby horse bestrides;
14. At two times seven a book to read withal;
21. At three times seven a Bandy and a Ball;
28. At four times seven a wife he seeks and finds
35. At five times 7 the Horn of strength he winds:
42. At six times seven, Time stands by him still,
49. At seven times seven, his Bag begins to fill:
56. At eight times seven his house with riches shines,
63. At nine times seven, he to the Earth inclines:
70. At ten times seven his Glass and time is run,
Into the earth man falls, his story's done.


AS I was wandering all alone
A project then I thought upon:
The which in my senses ran,
that I should right the Age of man:
Man he is Clay, and came from Earth
and sinners live till day of death
From one sin to another run,
and never leaves till he is undone.
Then fear your God make no delay
For Time and Tide for none will stay.
The first of seven years in a Cradle,
to stand or go he is not able,
Whiles other creatures making scorn
tramples him down when he is born:
So weak he is he cannot go
and poor is born we all do know.
Into this world stark naked he came,
and so shall go out of the same.
Then fear your etc.
At two times seven his friends to rule
provide for keeping him at School:
That what to him in youth is told
may do him good when he is old:
But he so given is to play
he truants most his time a way:
When Age comes on, he will then repent,
that he his time had so misspent.
At three times seven he is very idle
that all his friends cannot him bridle.
Then fear your God, make no delay,
His thoughts run wandering too and fro,
persuade him well, you are his foe:
In other Countries he will rome
and have no mind to stay at home:
That all his friends are grieved still
while he persues his headstrong will.
Then, etc.
The Second Part To the same Tune.
At four times seven a wife he gets,
using and mustring up his wits
How he should thrive he takes great pains,
alas for little or no gains.
He then to bend his senses, rowse
things most convenient for his house:
Which in time wastes and fades away,
even so must man that is but Clay.
Then fear, etc.
At five times seven a charge comes on,
Which in the world few think upon:
He labors hard with right good will,
striving like stones against a hill:
Or like a fload that swiftly goes
At one time ebbs, another flows:
Even so is man that is rich to day
to morrow God takes all away.
Then fear, etc.
At six times seven then he should leave
and for his former folly grieve:
His heart is vert with sobs and sighs
for all his former vain delights
Good Husbandry he then home takes
bad husbandry he then forsakes:
And sober lives, and those defy
such as do ^^te good husbandry
Then fear, etc.
At seven times seven a covetous mind
is all to which he is inclind
Covetous he is in himself
to purchase up all worldly wealth.
Gathering up that which is but dross
which may prove once to be a cross.
Except his talent he improve
toward the poor by acts of love.
Then fear your God, make no delay,
For time and tide for none will stay.
At eight times seven his cunning skill
striving with all his worldly will:
In barganing and selling then
making his Children mighty men.
Leaving behind him that which he
for it shall never thanked be
As he did gather and lay it by,
the Prodigal does make it fly.
Then fear, etc.
At nine times seven he waxes old,
his limbs benumbed, and veins are cold:
His children glad with much content,
their father have so good judgment:
So knowing is in every cause
his wit does make young men to pause:
Yet all this world he now must leave
and now prepare himself for grave.
Then fear, etc.
At ten times seven his Glass is run,
and he poor soul can no way shun:
No, he must leave children and wife,
to give the world cannot save his life.
Happy is he that lives here,
and keeps his Conscience pure and clear,
Although in dust his body lie
his soul shall mount up to the Sky.
Then fear, etc.
Thus have I shown from Stage to Stage,
the frail condition of man's age,
From seven to seven we pass, till when
we reach the years threescore and ten:
Let us all join with one accord,
and with due reverence fear the Lord.
Then may we all rejoice and sing
Hallelujah to our heavenly King.
