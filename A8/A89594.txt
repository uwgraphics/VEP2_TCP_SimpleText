London, Printed for H. T. 1647.

A LETTER from a person of quality in the Parliaments Army in Munster in
Ireland, to an Honorable Member of the House of Commons.
SIR,
IN my last Letter I made a discovery unto you of some fears, that the enemy
upon the many Alarms given unto them by our slight and inconsiderable parties,
would have fortified their frontier Garrisons, to a resolution of defending
them against us, and so have put us to a weary siege, for the reducing of those
Holds, which at the first of the Spring might have been taken in with much
facility: What I then conceived, was (I believe) at that time their intention,
they received into each of those places, strong guards to secure them against
any opposition we could make against them; but God, who has the hearts of all
men in his hands, has bereaved them of theirs, disappointed their resolutions,
and produced no other effects out of all their contrivements, but Glory to
himself and Honor to his servants, for he has already delivered unto our
hands those Garrisons, which were a terror to all our Quarters, Drummana,
Coppequin, and Dungarvon, and without any great expense, either of time or
blood: It was Sir, I confess, the subject of much admiration to us all, and I
hope we shall continue the memory thereof amongst us, as an incitement to
thanksgiving to our God. The manner of their reducing being notorious and
public, will, I doubt not, come to your knowledge by the Pens of many others.
Yet I send you enclosed a particular of their several proceedings, and may not
omit to give you some account of the behavior of the Lord President herein,
whose vigilance and forwardness was so great, that we may justly call his
personal actions, the chiefest instrument, under God, of effecting those
designs, though he were General of the Army, and had those others under him
who could well answer the expectation of their own employments, in paying the
Batteries, in drawing on their Guns, in observing places of advantage for our
Cannon and the like, yet he thought it no dishonor to act their several
offices for the expediting of the service, knowing that the Soldier is more
provoked to diligence and gallantry by example then by precept, I do not
hereby desire to derogate any thing from those who were his assistance in the
work, they must receive their honors in their due places, and may most of
them (Officers and Soldiers, those of the new Regiments, as well as of the
old) challenge a portion answerable to their employments; but I must not
transgress, I intend but a short Letter, and will not make it a Discourse.

Sir, God has placed you amongst the number of those Worthies there, who have
so charitably undertaken the mannagement of this un-questioned just War: We are
now in a fair proceeding to effect something of consequence upon the enemies of
the Church; as a poor Member whereof, I offer up my prayers unto God, that a
timely assistance may be sent unto us in this day of opportunity; You have
begun nobly, in Gods name go on, and evidence to the world, that his Cause
shall not be destitute of Patrons which will own it and abet it: Besides, what
a dishonor would it be to our Masters there? what a discouragement to the
Soldiers here? what an encouragement to the enemy abroad? to see us nipt in
the blossom, and lose the hopes of our forward increase, for want of food to
give us growth and vigor, which if seasonably provided, I dare confidently
aver, through the providence of God, which we presume to promise to our
selves, that this Summer will afford such an account of the War in Munster
(if it be not retarded by the interposition of particular designs of malice to
break us amongst our selves) thus the undertakers themselves will begin to
account that their best husbandry, which they have expended upon this design,
I will not inquire your piety so far as to beseech your motion to the House for
an expedient herein, your own inclination is a sufficient prompter to an action
of so much charity and honor, I shall therefore trouble you no farther, but
shall always remain,

Dungay, 10 May, 1647. Sir, Your most humble servant, B.M.

A RELATION of the taking in of the Castle of Dromannagh, the Castle, Town and
Garrison of Cappoquin, both lying on the Black-water, etc.
ABout the 26th, of the last month, the Lord President marched forth, with the
Army toward, the Black-waterside, and sat down before the Castle of
Dromannagh a strong hold of the Rebbles which: has greatly annoyed out
Quarters, and having made a small brach in the Out-workes whereon an assault
was given by our men who drove the Rebels to retreat into their Castle, The
Officers considering the same to be a place of much strength, and likely to
cost a great expense of blood, and some waste of time, their principal design
being upon Cappoquin (a Pass of greater importance) did condescend to accept
the Castle of Dromannagh at the hand of the destroyers: upon Quarter only for
life and their wearing apparel, and accordingly on Friday the last of April
that place was surrendered to the Lord President, wherein was found very little
booty, they having a long time expected a siege and disposed of all things
which were of value out of their Castle wherein there were only four barrels
of powder, a proportion of Match one or two small pieces of Ordnance, some
Murderers, Sling-peeces and about 100 Arms, the ward consisting of about 60
men

From hence the Lord President, having intelligence of a fresh supply that
night to be sent into Cappoquin, immediately dispatched away all the
Horse-forces to face that Garrison, and surround it till the Foot drew up,
which proved to be so seasonably done, that the supply of Match and powder
being upon the way to that place under the Convoy of a Regiment of Foot, and
three Troops of Horse, was upon the appearance of our Horse force to retreat
in some have to Clomnell, this disappointment of their Munition (we afterward
discovered) occasioned them upon the first Summons to embrace a treaty, and the
second of May to give up, upon Quarter, to march away with bag and baggage,
except such of our own men as should be there found and had run from there
Colors all which to the number of 23, were condemned to be hanged.

So as we gained that important Pass and the forementioned castle with the
loss only of two men, and about six hurt, without any great expense of time or
Munition: This place will be an excellent Garrison both in respect of securing
our own Quarters, and annoying the Rebels, for which it is most commodiously
seated, having a strong Castle to countenance the Town and Outworks, and a
Bridge also very well fortified with a defensible work at the furthest end from
the Town.

The President being possessed of this place drew the whole Army into it and
the adjoining Villages to shelter themselves from the violence of the weather,
which then proved to be exceeding wet and foul, giving great impediment to our
progress, but for our encouragement it pleased God that about the same instant
there arrived Colonel Temple with his Regiment of Horse, and soon after a Ship
laden with Corn, and the Admiral with 5000 pound in Spanish money. And now the
Lord President being forced to spend a little time in the settling and disposing
these new forces, which he had no sooner dispatched, but he ordered the remove
of the Army from Cappoquin to Dungarvau, a Sea-Towne well walled and fortified,
and one of the Rebels chief Ports in Munster, and a receptacle for their
Pirates and Dunkirk Friggots that our Coast of England as well as Ireland, In
this removal his Lordship found very great difficulty, though the way were
short not above seven miles for want of Carriages and draught horses and Oxen
for his Artillery and Provisions, wherein he was driven to that Exigency that
he was enforced to hyre the Soldiers for money to help forward both the
Ordnance, and other necessaries, here his Lordship did even resolve to
decline, harkening to all terms or treatyes after the first Summons if the
defendants should refuse to surrender: But finding that after four days
constant battery with four battering Pieces, that they could make no
assaultable breach, and that though we had taken one Castle by storm near the
Town by which they secured their water, that these within did not appear to
be in any distress, and finding also that through want of Carriages provisions
grew so scant in the Army, as that diverse of the men fell sick, and many faint,
and that the crosnesse of the winds did hinder the coming about by Sea of
those provisions that were appointed to come that way, and that to change the
places of battery would be a work of much time and trouble, the Lord President
did with the advice of the Officers accept the surrender of that place, on
quarter, to march away with bag and baggage.

Upon our coming into the Town we found the cause that induced them to give
it up, was want of Munition (as at Cappoquin) which was also upon the way
toward them by Sea from Waterford, but was prevented and drawn back by Captain
Willoughby, and Captain Plunkets Frigot, who lay before the Harbors mouth on
purpose by the Lord Presidents directions, we also found that if we had carried
the Town by Storm, the Castle within it might well have been justified against
us, and would have probably cost much blood in the acquiring.

In this place was little of value left they having as at Dromanna and
Cappoquin shifted away all they had in expectation of a siege, which we
understand they begin to provide for at Waterford, Clomnell, Cashell, and
Fetherd, all which places we desire to be dealing with, and would be of great
advantage but want of Carriages for the train will not suffer us to march on
so considerable designs, and to take in more Garrisons till our Army be more
numerous will too much enfeeble it. In this Town we gained 12 Pieces of
Ordnance, lost one Captain and had a Major wounded, taken prisoner and
released upon the surrender, about six men more were lost, and three horse
shot, and of the Rebels about 100 slain.

This Town and Harbor will be of great advantage to the Parliaments shipping,
where they may lie conveniently to meet with any of the rebels ships as they
come out of Waterford, or hover upon, or coast near Yoyhall.

I had almost forgot to acquaint you, that in our march to Dungarvau, we took
a Castle called Cornisleedigh belonging to one Philip, Which Cragh lying upon
the edge of the mountain between Coppoquin and Clomnell.

The Officers and Soldiers are singularly active and desirous to continue in
action, and express great resentment at the thought of any impediments that
should hinder them in their progress and march: They are all unanimously
affected both to the Service, and to their Commander in chief.

FINIS.
