THE SPEECH OF PATRICK Earl of March-mount, etc. His Majesty's High
Commissioner to the Parliament of SCOTLAND.
On Tuesday the Nineteenth of July. School. My Lords and Gentlemen,
AS His Majesty's gracious Letter to you now read in your hearing, carries very
plain and full Expressions of His Esteem, and Acceptance of the many Proofs you
have given of your Loyalty and good Affection to His Person and Government. So
His calling you together at this time when the Condition of Affairs is so much
Changed, though He cannot be present with you, is a clear evidence of the entire
Trust and Confidence He has in you.

His Majesty did intend to have held this Session of Parliament in Person, but
the present Circumstances of Affairs having hindered His coming; It has pleased
Him to appoint me to be His Commissioner in it. And I will earnestly endeavor,
to manifest that Fidelity and Zeal for His Majesty's Service, and the good of
this Kingdom, which His Majesty does expect: and I confidently hope, that your
Wisdom and Abilities will not only bear with, but also sustain me under the
weaknesses which I may justly acknowledge: So as the public Interest may
thereby be at no prejudice.

His Majesty has graciously given you full Assurance, that He is firmly
resolved, to make it his principal Care to maintain your Religion, Laws and
Liberties, and Presbyterian Government in this Church; And I am commanded to
let you know, that He is fully resolved to continue the same: And as his
Majesty has told you, that he will give all due encouragement for promoting
your Trade: So I am commanded in His Name to assure you, that His Majesty is
firmly resolved to maintain the Privileges of the Trade of this Kingdom, and
particularly these established by Treaties, Laws or Customs with other Nations.

I am both fully instructed in what His Majesty judges to be necessary for the
supp^^^ of His Government, and the Safety of this Kingdom; and have full power
for passing such Laws for the good of His People, as appear to be most needful
at present.

It is not to be doubted, but that as His Majesty thinks, that the fullest
Information he could have what Laws are fit to be made, would be His hearing
Free-reasonings in Parliament upon them by you who are so much interested, and
have your Minds so much taken up about them; So you will think, that His
Majesty is best capable to Discover and Discern upon the whole Matter, in the
Bulk and Sum, what is fit and necessary to be done at this Time for the common
Interest, as having a clearer Veiw of the bad Designs of our Enemies, and of
the many Pieces joined together in that wise Contrivance, which (by the
blessing of GOD) has been the support of Affairs, than we can have.

You may very justly be persuaded, that His Majesty's Judgment of these
Matters, is solidly founded, and much to be relied on; Not only because he is
highly concerned, both upon account of Honor and Interest, but likewise,
because he is a Prince of deep Understanding and perpetual Application to
Business: And has turned up all the Sides of these Grounds of Judgment which
he sees in a truer Light, and at a nearer Distance than we do.

I am commanded to represent to you, that the continuing the Troops upon the
present establishment, is, What His Majesty judges to be absolutely necessary,
for the Support of His Government, the Safety of the Country, and your
Preservation; And that His Majesty is no ways doubtful, but you will be
convinced of it, and will provide suitable Supplies for mentaining them: And
it is certainly most fit, that this be the first thing you take under your
Consideration, as what concerns the All: And then you can proceed to other
things recommended to you by his Majesty, or which may be proposed.

My Lords and Gentlemen,
Tho I am unwilling to take up much of your time, and to detain you from your
Business, yet I cannot omit to invite you, to consider seriously one thing
which I am persuaded cannot easiely escape the particular nottice of any here,
that is, in what your gracious and kind Sovereign places the chief Satisfaction
he has in bringing the great and dangerous War, wherein he has been ingadged to
an End by an honorable Peace: Even the Prospect he has of the Prosperity and
Happiness of His good Subjects.

His Majesty undertook an enterprise almost desperate in the Opinion of all
Europe, he has followed it out and maintained it with imparralelled Courage and
Constancy; He has exposed his precious Life and Person in passing the Seas many
times, in faceing and fighting his Enemies in many Battles: The secret
Conspiracies against Him have been many, yet (thanks to the Eternal GOD) he has
been wonderfully supported and preserved, and certainly His Majesty has a very
grateful Sense of, and a great Satisfaction in it. But His greatest
Satisfaction is the Prospect which he has of the Prosperity and Happiness of
his good Subjects; This cannot be too often repeated, and is never to be
forgot: Nay I am sure it leaves such an Impression upon your worthy Spirits and
Minds as is becoming for these, at whose instance and for whose behove so great
things have been undertaken and performed, and I am als sure there is no Scots
man (that has a good effection to His Majesty, and to the happy Revolution, and
the Work of God amongst us, and a good understanding to discern what is
necessary upon this Occasion, which I hope all here have, (...) but who will
honestly, cheerfully and readily give such proofs of Gratitude to, and trust in
His Majesty, as small more and more endear to him this his Ancient Kingdom, And
honest hearted People.

THE SPEECH OF JAMES Viscount of Seafield, Principal Secretary of State, and
President to the PARLIAMENT OF SCOTLAND.
On Tuesday the Nineteenth of July School. My Lords and Gentlemen,
YOu have given many Evidences of your great Zeal, Duty and Affection to His
Majesty's Royal Person and Government, and His Majesty has entire Trust and
Confidence in you, as is fully expressed in his most gracious Letter, and by my
Lord Commissioner His Grace in His Name.

His Majesty is very sensible that you did cheerfully provide suitable Supplies
for maintaining those Troops that were thought needful for your Defense at
Home, whereby you secured Peace and Quiet within this Kingdom during the War.

You also Raised and Recruited the Regiments of this Kingdom, that were
employed in His Majesty's Service Abroad, for the Support and Defense of the
Common Interest of Europe, as well as the Security of His Majesty's Dominions.

The vigorous Prosecution of the War, and the Blessing of God Almighty upon His
Majesty's Endeavors, has procured us an Honorable Peace; And therefore His
Majesty has upon this Occasion called you together, that you may provide for
your own Safety and better Establishment.

You will easily be convinced, that we have many Enemies both at Home and
Abroad, ready to lay hold of any Opportunity to disturb our present Peace and
Tranquillity.

The King knows our Circumstances and Dangers better than we do our selves, and
is certainly the best Judge of what is needful, and he has told you plainly,
that the Troops which He has Established, are indispensibly necessary for your
Preservation.

His Majesty does therefore expect, that you will proceed in this Matter with
Cheerfulness and Unanimity, to the Discouragement of His and your Enemies; And
as the Subsidies that are demanded of you, are to be employed for your own
Safety, so they will again circulat amongst you, and cannot diminish the
wealth, nor prejudge the Interest of the Nation.

His Majesty has alwise judged his Interest to be inseparable from yours; He
has been the powerful Instrument of God Almighty in rescueing you from Popery
and Arbitrary Government: He has exposed His Royal Person to the greatest
Dangers for the common Safety, and all that have the Occasion to know his
Measures must be convinced, that the Happiness and Prosperity of his Subjects
is His chief care and concern.

In His Reign you have the full enjoyment of your Religion, Laws and Liberties,
you have also Presbyterian Government established in this Church which His
Majesty has declared he will maintain, and you have many good Laws and
Constitutions granted for the Ease and Satisfaction of the Nation.

Seeing then, that by him you enjoy all these and many other Blessings, you will
certainly judge it your interest and Duty to comply with what is now only
proposed as necessary to render you Secure, against the Designs of His and your
Enemies

His Majesty was resolved to have been present with you in this Session of
Parliament, that he might have more perfectly understood what Laws were fit for
the welfare and Satisfaction of his Subjects; But the great Affairs in which he
is necessarly ingadged, not allowing us that happiness, he has fully instructed
my Lord Commissioner his Grace, to pass such Acts as appear to His Majesty most
proper for the Benefit and interest of this Kingdom; And He has given full
Assurances, that he will give all Encouragement for promoting Trade, and
particularly, that he will protect the Privileges of the Tread of this Kingdom
established by Laws, Treaties, and Customs with other Nations.

My Lords and Gentlemen,
I am very sensible of my own unfitness for the Station in which it has pleased
his Majesty to employ me; But your ready Compliance with what has been proposed
by his Majesty on other Occasions, did chiefly encourage me to accept, and to
hope for an happy Conclusion to this Session: To the Satisfaction of the King,
the Honor of the Government, and the Security of the Nation.
