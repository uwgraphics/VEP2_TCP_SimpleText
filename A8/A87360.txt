A LETANY For the NEVV-YEAR, with a Description of the NEW STATE.
FRom all and more than I have written here,
I wish you well protected this New year;
From Civil war, and such uncivil things
As ruin Law and Gospel, Priests and Kings;
From those who for self ends would all betray,
From such new Saints that Pistol when they pray,
From flattering Faces with insernal Souls,
From new Reformers, such as pull down Paul's,
From Linsy-woolsy Lords, from Town betrayers,
From Apron-Preachers, and extemp're Prayers,
From Pulpit-blasphemy, and bold Rebellion,
From Blood and -- somthings else that I could tell ye on,
From new false Teachers which destroy the old,
From those that turn the Gospel into Gold,
From that black Pack where Clubs are always Trump,
From Bodies Politic, and from the Rump,
From those that ruin when they should repair,
From such as cut off Heads instead of Hair,
From twelve Months Taxes, and abortive Votes,
From chargeable Nurse-Children in red Coats,
From such as sell their Souls to save their Sums,
From City Charters that make Heads for Drums,
From Magistrates which have no truth or knowledge,
From the red Students now in Gresham College,
From Governments erected by the Rabble,
From sweet Sir Arthurs Knights of the round Table,
From City-Saints whose Anagram is Stains,
From Plots, and being choked with our own Chains;
From these, and ten times more which may ensue,
The Poet prays, Good Lord deliver you.
Lo here a Glorious Realm subverted stands,
Just Tumbler-like upon the Feet and Hands:
Once Europes Pride and Envy, now their Scoff.
Since the base Entrayles cut the Head on it off,
The Body lost its form, and 's turned a Lump;
Now all the Lims are Vassals to the Rump,
Which, all the Nutriture devoured and spent,
Yields nothing back but stink and excrement,
And all returns that ever this does send us,
Serves only to defile us and offend us;
It Is by much pampring grown a strange Disease,
Which all receives, and gives nor food, nor ease
To the pining Body, but is craving still;
And we by feeding it our selves do kill;
Which nothing lives by that has any worth,
But those base vermin, which its stink brought forth.
If every Member in this Body would
Withdraw its strength, and influence, as they should,
This nasty Highness quickly must abate,
And yield to the Head, which only saves the State.
The RUMP.
