Dublin, Printed by Joseph Ray at Colledge-Green, for William Norman (in
Dames-street) Bookbinder to His Grace the Duke of Ormond. 1683.

TO THE KING'S Most Excellent MAJESTY.
SIR,
WHen Mr, Boil, with my Partners and my self, attended Your Majesty with the
Experiment of Reducing Salt Water into Fresh; Your Majesty seemed so well
pleased with an Invention of that Universal Benefit, That We cannot but with
our Humblest Duty, acknowledge Your Gracious Reception of it; However as Your
Great Wisdom and Profound Judgment is not easy to be surpised, and Your Royal
Approbation never known to be Your hasty Act of Grace; Your Favor and
Patronage was not fully obtained, till with the strictest Scrutiny you had
first examined those Hopes and Probabilities, You vouch saf'd to encourage in
us.

But when, upon further consideration, we had obviated all Difficulties, and
salv'd all Objections against this Undertaking, (which we hope will appear in
this printed Paper,) Your Majesty was graciously pleased to give us Your
Approbation, and to order us Your Letters Patents, which Grace and Favor
(ought to be, and) is received by us with the deepest sense of our humble
Acknowledgments and Gratitude.

And if the Fruits of Your Royal Grant has not hitherto been derived to us,
it is partly by some Obstacles we met from the suggestions of a private Person,
but more especially by the late Horrid Conspiracy, when, not only our Loyal
apprehensions for Your Majesty's Danger, diverted our Thoughts from all other
Concerns, but likewise we judged it a part of our Duty not to be pressing on
Your Majesty's Goodness, or on Your Ministers of State in so Important a
juncture of Affairs: But having now regained Leisure and Freedom after the
dissipation of the greatest part of our Fears, We presume a second time to lay
these Endeavors at Your Feet, as best Entitled to the Patronage of so great
an Undertaking by Your own Subjects, and best able to recommend it to the World
by Your Royal Approbation.

This Experiment is in a great degree owing to the Eminent Mr. Boil, and
indeed well worthy so Ingenious a Promoter, being so much the more the
Favorite of his happy Genius, as it is Universally useful to Mankind; But
whatever Advantages this Country, or indeed the World may receive by it, his
whole ambition is bounded in the public profit, contenting himself with no
other Benefit from it, than the satisfaction and pleasure of seeing it
accomplished by his Friends.

The advantages in regard to Navigation, especially in long Voyages, which are
subject (through often Calms, and on several other accounts,) to distress for
want of Water, and the benefits to Sea Towns, which are incommodated by
Brackish Waters, Together with the Easiness, Cheapness and Wholsomness of this
prepared Water, are the principal scope of these ensuing Papers, which are
Humbly Dedicated to Your Majesty's Perusal, Favor, and further Approbation by,

Your Majesty's most Dutiful, and Obedient Subject, R. FITZGERALD.

The foregoing Dedication humbly offered to His Majesty, having discovered the
Intention of this Undertaking; it remains now to satisfy all Reasonable
Scruples which have been raised concerning the Wholesomness and Cheapness of
Water thus prepared.
The Queries and Answers follow.

IF this Water can be made in sufficient Quantities to serve the Uses of any
Ship at Sea?



In case the Operation be by Fire, it may require a Skilful Chemist, or one
known in such Operations to be on board every Ship, who will require great
Wages?



It Is probable that the Engine may be frequently out of Order, and being so at
Sea, where Artificers and Tools are wanting to repair it, there must
necessarily follow want of Water, which will be of ill consequence?

Engine is of such Contrivance, that it is never likely to be out of Order.

Can this Engine be of use in Stormy weather?

Engine, the Mariners will be careful to make a good Provision of it
beforehand; however it is not to be doubted but it will answer the worst
Accidents of the greatest Storms, and have its Effect sufficiently in the worst
Weather, especially considering that in such desperate Extremities men must be
content with smaller Allowances.

The Operation being by Fire it may endanger the Ship, and the Smoke be very
offensive?

Engine may easily be placed in any Ship without danger of Fire, or offense of
Smoke.

Will not the Charge of this Instrument and the Materials belonging to it be
very great?



Will not the Fuel be very Chargeable, and take up much Room in the Ship?

Fire, that it will be very Cheap, and the Provision need not be great, nor the
trouble of Stowing it in a Ship.

Will not the Ingredients take up much Room, and be very Chargeable?

Indies and back again; and the Ingredients for one hundred Gallons of this
Seawater will not amount to above Fourteen Pence at most.

Admitting this Preparation of Water may be made, and in sufficient quantities,
it may be doubted whether it be Wholesome?

Bacon having written learnedly of this Subject, had not the least thought that
the Seawater after it had been dis-salted, without any Noxious addition, was
Unwholesome, and it neither now is, nor ever was really doubted whether it were
Wholesome: However, because invidious persons, who are no Well-wishers to
Ingenious Designs, may possibly raise Scruples, the Gentlemen who are concerned
in this Grant have, purposely to give public Satisfaction, sent a large
quantity of this Water to Doctor King, a very ingenious Physician, who is a
Member of the College, and of the Royal Society, who finds:

1. That it is Lighter than most of the Waters about the Town.

2. That it is without Sediment, and Transparent as any other Waters.

3. That it Lathers (as they call it,) with Wash-ball or Soap better than any
other Water, and with less Soap.

4. That Sugar dissolveth sooner in it, than in other Water.

5. That it Evaporates sooner than common Water.

6. That whereas common Water putrifies, and yields a stinking Smell within a
few Weeks, this has continued Sweet and unaltered several Months, and may yet
do so much longer, being still in as good condition as it was above four Months
ago.

7. That it makes Jellies as firm and good as any Water.

8. That it boils Pease to Tenderness, Beef, Mutton, Fish, and all other Meat,
without giving it an ill Taste or Color.

9. That it has no kind of ill Taste in it self, and boils in Milk without
Curdling.

10. That Flowers, Plants, and all Vegetables grow in it at least as well as
any other Water. And that small Animals live and grow in it.

Several men of great Quality, viz. the Earls of Shrewsbury, Westmorland,
Mulgrave, the Lord Dunbar, Lord Lumley, Lord Falconbridge, and Lord Chumley,
besides several Gentlemen of Quality, Officers of Sea and Physicians have drunk
of this Water, without being in the least indisposed after it; but lest any
doubts may remain, after this of the Salubrity of the said Water, the following
Testimonial of these Learned and Eminent Physicians is here inserted.

The Approbation of the College of Physicians, and of other Doctors of
Physic, Practicing in and about London.
WHereas we have received an account in a Gazet published some Months since,
that the Honorable Robert Fitz Gerald Esquire has found out the way and means of
reducing Salt Water into Fresh, in quantities sufficient to serve Ships at Sea.
And forasmuch as some persons may possibly make a doubt, if the said Water be
wholesome after the Salt is taken out of it. We therefore considering of what
general advantage, this useful Experiment may be, having fully informed our
selves from Mr. Boil, that the said Experiment is made by Fire. And having
also seen an account of some Experiments made by some Members of our own Body
to declare our Opinion, that we believe the said Water is very wholesome, and
may be safely used. And being further acquainted by the said Mr. Boil, that
the very few Ingredients made use of in the said Operation, are fixed in the
Fire, and give no noxious quality to the Water; We are therefore of Opinion
that the same may be safely used, and is at least as Healthy as any other Water
used at Sea. All which we certify (at the Request of the Honorable Robert Fitz
Gerald.)

Though Physic has always Flourished in this Kingdom, yet in this Age it is in
greater perfection than ever; being improved both as to the Practical and
Speculative part, by the present Fellows of the Famous College of Physicians;
who being Men of great Practice and Eminent Learning, cannot but give full
satisfaction to all such as inquire concerning the healthfulness of this Water;
Their Opinion being in this particular, the more valuable, because it is their
own disadvantage; since the Brackish Waters of the Seacoast, and the putrified
Waters made use of at Sea, might probably have afforded them a great number of
Patients, which may hereafter be lessened by the use of this wholesome Water.

The Benefits and Advantages of Sea Water made Fresh.
MUch Stowage will be saved, so that a Ship of 50 or 60 Tun and proportionably
of greater Bulk may take in several Tuns of Goods more than they formerly used
to carry; which will considerably advance the Trade of all Merchants, and be of
vast profit to the Masters or Owners of Ships.

The Charge of Casks is very considerable, especially when bound with Iron, as
all Sea-Casks must be; And by means of this Engine, three fourths of that
charge will be saved.

The tear and wear of Boats often going from Shipboard, and frequent loss of
the Boats and Men in stormy Weather, and the opportunity of the Sea-mens being
Drunk on shore; by which many fatal Accidents do happen, (by means of having
this Water-Engine) will be prevented.

Ships in long Voyages have been forced to run many Leagues from their intended
course, which much retards their Voyage, and makes them lose Fair Winds, and
maintain more Seamen at Charges of Diet and Wages than they have occasion for;
which Inconveniences may be prevented by having Water within themselves.

Ships are often forced to leave their Anchors and Cables behind them, by being
forced into dangerous Shoars upon account of taking in Fresh Water.

In the African, East and West India Voyages, great quantities of Fresh Water
are necessary, which the Seamen are forced to put above Deck for want of room,
which is great hindrance to a Ships sailing, and much endangers and weakens a
Ship in case of Calms, which often happen in the narrow Seas, but especially
near the Line, this Instrument will be of vast advantage by affording fresh and
wholesome Water, instead of that which is unwholesom and offensive.

Essex, Kent, and all other the Seacoasts, that want wholesome Water, may be
easily and cheaply supplied by this means; as also Venice, Amsterdam,
Rotterdam, and all other places that lie near the Sea, and either want good, or
have Brackish Water.

In time of War, whole Navies may be relieved by this Engine, and opportunity
given of making the greatest Discoveries imaginable.

It is further to be considered, that hitherto the richest and ablest bodied
Seamen have been averse from undertaking long Voyages, by reason of
endangering their Healths and Lives, by making use of putrified Water, which
Inconvenience is not now to be feared, there being such useful helps of Fresh
Water by the use of this Engine, and possibly a smaller number of Men may serve
the use of Ships than do at present, by which much Charges will be saved to the
Masters and Owners of Ships; and Merchants may Trade upon easier Terms.

A LETTER of Mr. BOYLES, to the Learned Doctor JOHN BEALE Fellow of the Royal
Society, concerning Fresh Water made out of Seawater, printed at the Desire of
the Patentees.
SIR,
TO give you a short Account (suitable to the little time I have to do it in,)
of the Transaction, which I suppose must have given the rise to the mention
made of my Name in the publik Gazzet; I must inform you, that one of my nearest
Relations, (Captain Fitzgerald) and some other worthy Gentlemen, having
acquainted His Majesty, that they had an Invention for making Seawater sweet
and wholesome in great quantity, and with small Charge, and that I had examined,
and did approve the Water so prepared; His Majesty was pleased, with very
Gracious Expressions, to command me to attend Him, with a further and more
particular Information. Having readily obeyed this Order, and been made
acquainted with the Objections the King thought fit to make against the
Practicableness of the Invention; which, (though a private man had urged them,)
I I should think the most judicious that have been framed against it, I humbly
represented to Him, that I looked upon this Invention as comprising two
differing things; a Mechanical part, which related to the Engine it self and
the use of it a Shipboard, and a Physical part which concerns the Potableness
and Wholesomness of the Liquor. About the former of these I did not intend to
clear the Difficulties, especially such strong ones, as His Majesty had
proposed; but left it to the Patentees to give Him Satisfaction, which they
were in a readiness to offer. But as to the Wholesomness of the prepared Water,
I had made some Trials upon that Liquor, which gave me no just grounds of
suspecting it to be unwholesome, but several Motives to believe it well
conditioned, and of great use to Navigators, and not to them only. And having
hereupon briefly acquainted His Majesty with the chief Trials I had made to
examine this Sweetened Water, He was pleased to look upon them as satisfactory,
and vouchsafed on that occasion to discourse as a Virtuoso of the Sea and
Brackish Waters, and gave me some new, as well as instructive Observations
about them: and in Conclusion, dismissed the Patentees with a Gracious Promise
of His Royal Protection, and peculiar Favor.

To this short Narrative it now remains, that I briefly Subjoyn the chief
things that persuaded me of the Salubrity of this Water, (whence may be justly
and easily inferred, the Utility the Public may receive by a cheap and easy
way of preparing it:) First, then I considered that almost all the Rain water
that falls from the Clouds on the Main Ocean, and which (except perhaps in very
few places in Torrid Climates) is unquestionably received as wholesome, must be
afforded by the Sea, and consequently be but Seawater freed from its Salt
(according to the Famous Motto, Redit Agmine dulci.) Next I found, as His
Majesty Himself had done,) that the Liquor was well tasted, and without any
sensible Brackishness; and so some of it continued for between 4 or 5 Months in
a large Crystal Bottle, that I purposely kept unstopt, and for the most part
in a South Window, where it neither did, nor probably in a long time, will
putrify, or so much as appear troubled or less transparent; during which time
it was with Approbation tasted and smelled by several Learned Physicians of the
Famous College of London. Thirdly, I found it laver very well, which most Pump
waters, and many others that have some little (though unperceived) common Salt
in them, will not do. Fourthly, this Water will boil Pease tender, which
amongst Seamen is one of the principal signs of good Water. Fifthly, in very
good Balances with an Instrument that I purposely caused to be made for the
nice weighing of Liquors, I found this Water far less heavy than one would
expect, for if it differed at all in weight from the like quantity of
undistilled Water, (I speak with an If, because it is far more difficult to be
Exact in such nice Trials, than the Vnpracticed will Imagine) the difference
was not considerable being but 1 part in 400; and that difference is very small
in Comparison of that which Navigators and Learned Authors relate to be
observable in Natural Waters, all of them good and potable: I might tell you on
this occasion; that the last Great Duke of Tuscany, who was an Eminent
Virtuoso, and the Patron of the Celebrated Academy of the Lyncean Philosophers
is affirmed among other prudent courses that he took for his Health, whereof he
was very Solicitous to have constantly made use of Distilled Water for his own
Drinking. And I could add other things favorable enough to the Patentees
Water, if Haste, and perhaps Discretion too, did not oblige me to leave them
yet unmention'd, that I might now have time to say somewhat of the main thing
of all that convinced me of the Saltness of the Water I speak of. I considered
then, Sixthly, That the thing that was aimed at by those Ingenious men, that at
differing times, and in several Countries have attempted to make Sea water
Sweet, and the thing that was required by proposing Recompenses, or otherwise
to Encourage the Makers of such Attempts, was to Free the Seawater from the
Brackishness without any Noxious Additament: so that on all sides it was taken
for granted, that the only thing that kept the Sea water from being safely
Potable, was its Brackishness.

From which Reflection it was natural for me to infer a Conclusion very
favorable to our prepared Water: For having long since written a short
Discourse of the Saltness of the Sea; I had been industrious to devise ways of
comparing Waters in point of Brackishness. And by these I found the Patentees
Water to be more free from common Salt, than Waters that are usually drunk here
in London, of which I remember I showed those Gentlemen an Experiment that
surpised as well as convinced them. And that which more satisfied me my self,
was a Trial that I carefully made by a way which having mentioned, but not yet
(for want of opportunity) disclosed to His Majesty, the Respect I owe Him
forbids me to impart without His Leave: On which account I hope you will be
content to be at present assured of these two things; One, that by this way of
Trial, I found, (what possibly you will think strange;) that if there were in
Water so much as one Grain of Salt, in above two Ounces of Water, I could
readily discover it: The other, that even by this critical Examen, I could not
detect so much as a thousandth part of Salt in our prepared Water; whereas I
found by Trials purposely and carefully made, that our English Seawater
contained a 44th or 45th part of good dry Salt; or, which is all one, that 44
Pints, or near so many Pounds of Marine Water, would yield about one Pound of
dry common Salt.

Thus, Sir, you have a short and Art-less Account, such as my haste will
permit, and the Nature of the Subject requires, of my part in promoting this
profitable Invention; to which I own my self a great well-wisher, not out of
any private Interest (though that was obligingly proffered me by the
Patentees,) but as I think the bringing into general use may prove a real
Service to Mankind, upon the score of diverse Vtilities and Advantages, which
yet (though I had leisure,) I should think very needless to enumerate to so
discerning a person as Dr. B. to whom I shall therefore hasten to subscribe my
self, etc.

An Affectionate Friend and Servant R. BOIL.
