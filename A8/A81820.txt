DULMAN TURNED DOCTOR, Councelling his brother Dunce how to peerk to preferment.
To the Reader only thus much.
REad on but laugh not, till thy heart do ache,
Yet grieve and groan for Philomusus sake,
This locoserious Tragecomicall
Rapture, is mirthfull, though Satyricall.
Some wit with sollid truth is here so mixed,
Domocritus with Heroclitus sixth
That sweet and sour, salt sugar in this scroule
Is Physiek for the times, thy body, soul.
Took as a Paper Purge for one poor penny,
Thy squinzees may he curde, if thou have ans.
DVIMANS documents to his brother DVNCE.
Poor Dunce my friend, familiar, and sworn brother
Whom I more largely love, then any other,
How ere thou nick-nam'd be Dunce, Dolt, Fool, Sor,
Simplicius block, blind- asinus and what not;
For whose just brands I greive, thou well may think
As to se Geese go barefoote, Ducks to drink,
Yet thou art dear, to me as Ass to Mule,
As Goose to Gander, Buffon to Knave Fool.
Gnato to Thraso, Woodcock to a widgyon,
Pyannat in a Rochet to a Pigion.
And for thy good, my brains I do spung yet,
To knock into thy head some little wit.
Hence hear and heed, my nocuments for thy good,
Lodge in thy noddle and right understood,
My Cannons and my cautions, (tho Sneak, Snake,
Or Pest thou be) they for thy good may make.
First then, thoughtimes be Luxate out of tune,
As fretts in Musicks, Cuckowes notes in June,
Yet since that Medlars nere be ripe, till ror,
Meddle not with them for they be too hot.
When Pellicans flap at slames to save their brood,
They but their own wings scortch and do no good,
When ought amiss thou spiest, look through thy fingers
And seal thy lips, close as Cathedral singers,
(Silentians now) a Turkish mute,
Or a dumb Ox, with worst times now best suite,
Wincke (Lion like) in policy yet wake,
Se and say naught, though mad work many make,
Sir and be silent and say naught but Mum,
Its the road way to make a woman dumb,
Though in Scold-Allia, Giglitania borne,
Schism Allia, or Tub Allia Gifts to scorn,
As Micholl once mocked David, Jshmael
Sarahs blessed son: Heir to Gods Israel.
Look at most men like Lions in a grate,
Yet come not in their paws at any rate.
Live to thy self, and lurk in Cacus Denn,
Or in the Cyinks Tub, avoid most men,
With Petrark, Tully, In Tusculano
pent in Country Farms
(As our late Lipsius, In Angulo agri.
thou may shun most harms
Ere any thou call friend, drink with him Malt,
Dutch like well watered with him eat much salt,
Ioab for Jonathan, yea Aspe or Viper,
Least hugde thou dance, too late without a Piper.
Wed not with Courtizan, nor scold, nor slut,
To Horn thy head, thy heart vex, baine thy gut.
But if I may persuade the (as once blocks
Daunc'r after Orpheus) fly stom Wedlocks locks
Thou art a simple, stand and keep thy ground,
Be not so simple yet, as to compound,
Staggs, Bucks, and Hinds on Mountains will live free,
Rather then sadled Horse or Ass to be,
From Women steering then, as Sirens Rocks
For fear of after claps of after knocks
If thou with men wilt walk, as penny wise,
For sudden rising learn to temporize,
For to prevent Times shocks, are rocks and dolours
Polip^ze Camelionize into all colors,
J^st Proteus like, Hares Hedg-hogs, wit do show,
Changing their forms as every wind does blow,
More meal to milnes, more Fish to net this brings,
Then begging in the goulden times of Kings,
Or Pirchus, Caesar and great Alexander,
Who rich in Hopes, enriched each Commander.
As Players then do cun their Cewes by heart,
Smdy the gainful gnatonizing Art,
But above all, for place, grace, gold and dross,
Commence Dunce Doctor quickly at dawes cross,
And though the spirit of a vane delusion,
Haunt the like Ahabs prophets to confusion,
Pretend Enthusiasmes, Raptures, and the spirit,
This more then learned Arts, wit, worth demerrit,
Above all principles of Matchavil,
All Gusmans wiles, works of Achithophel,
All cheating cunny catching Cards and Dice,
Monopolizing gets the in a trice.
Reputes Friends favors, dust both red and yellow,
If thou can schisms broach from thy Hogshead shallow
And though thou be but a fantastic Else,
Yet this will get the praise, and silver pelf
And plump thy panch with wines, and belly cheer
As if thou feasted by Lucullus were;
Yea thou shall be esteemde the eigth wise man,
Learnd Doctor worth a Goose, and thou a Swann,
As rare as ever sung in Thames or Po.
All Paganish learning thou wilst out shine so.
No Gypsy, Wizard, Witch Nicromantizer,
No Grand Iroposter shall be held a wiser,
Lurk but in stables, corners, barnes, blind cellers,
Thou shall more Clyents have then fortnne-tellers,
No juggling Jesuits wonder-working Friars,
No miracle minting, monks mass, (ass) Priests liars,
No Physiogmonists, prophets Magitians
Quack-salvers Empericks, Mount-banks called Physicians
And none by Palmstry who gull poor souls,
Shall be cried up, by gandarized Noules,
Above poor the, a witless worthless body,
Who playst amongst them all thy games at noddy,
And ever when thou robdst, or winst at hitter,
Thou Knave oath clubs turns up, none does it fitter,
To swell bigg as a Preacher (we I nigh burst
Like A^sops Frog) if that thou have a lust.
This above Kellies Phylosophick stone,
Or Fortunatus purse: is all in one,
As high as Pewes and Pulpits to advance
Thy blockish Ignorance, proud arrogance,
In Camps in Countries Villages, and Cities
Whilst Phylomusus, though that he all wit is
Of Dunce and Dulman shall be scornd sans pitties,
We Will make him sigh Elegiakes, doleful ditties,
Hang down his head like to a bulrush weak,
Or Cock beat out o'th pit, who scarce can creake,
Yea he shall se a moore-cock, poor cock, base
Wise as a Woodcock, peerkt up to his place,
By some wise as himself, who for him strike
With armed power, from bodkin to half Pike:
Thou and I will be joviall like mad Greeks,
Spurning wits Arts, and learning like young leekes,
No more esteeming Gifts, in best Devine,
Then Dogs do honey combs, or pure pearls swine,
Whilst Philomusus shall out mourn even Swanns
Doves, nest robbed Niti^gals and Pellicans,
And Dowlands Lachrimae sing with sad cheares,
Or Ovids Niobe dissolvd to reares,
His gifts disgraced, silenced his parts
Logic Philosophy and the liberal Arts
All Mystic Sciences deep and profound,
To profound Jgnorance, shall now give grounds;
Yea Elocurion memory quick wit,
This Curtian gulf shall swallow up each whit,
Greek, Hebrew, Lattine, tongues, and powerful zeal,
Hstory Theology shall be held a sweale
But of a Candle, or a Candles snuff
Pust out: all took Tobacco like in puff,
By us whose zeales do boil, like scums in por,
In Ignorance we have a goodly lor,
But in a spirit Eutopean far the more,
These two the Goddesses be which we adore,
With priests of Priapus and Venus Nuns,
(We slight these Artists, and their paper Guns.
These our Dianaes great Apolloes be,
Pallas, Minerva, and the Muses we
Scoff as mere scare-crowe's in a cherry tree,
By Rattles, Horses frighted are, not we
Arts Idols were in Bishop Quondams days,
Now Almanacks past date, to Mars be praise,
Webetter web will spin with Rock and Spindle,
Without all yearne, then Artists with wits nimble,
We do but turn the cock our waters run,
Our Doctrines drop from Clouds: the Spirit's our sun,
O worthy brother hold we but to that,
Then like to paper Squibs we sc^ffe their char,
And to indoctrinare something more free,
Thy dull plumbeous ceribrositie
Be sure to hit the way to Dunstable,
Then tho a Scavenger, or Constable,
Borcher or tailor, from the needle trained,
To the sharp pike thou have a trade retained,
Will hold thy head up higher, then all merit,
If thou can bravely brag thou have the spirit,
(Though but of Iezebels prophets: Lucifer)
This will advance the, place the, grace the far.
My doubty Dunce, coin credit worship both,
To gain, all spiried errors (though mere froath)
As Damocles did Dionisius spittle,
Lick them as Bauline, this will the gain, no little
Exroll Paus pipe as Midas did of old,
Thine Asses ears may so be tipped with gold,
Say Paetus daughters be more fair, more wise
Then Iun^, its the only way to rise,
Cry that poor preaching Pedlars better ware
Vent then rich Merchants, this will make the rare.
But chief if any vent, the least pure wit,
Riddle or history modest Jest, break sit:
(Though Sampson and Elias did the same)
Close sting them yet, they and their wirs, proclaim
As froath, lose, vain: where thou can, not do like,
Bark, bite, detract, calumniate dislike,
Sneakes, snakes, in blacks, did blocks, can aemulate
And teeth show, where they cannot imitate.
Say that all Churches be but sleepled stones
Except in corners cast, among holy one
Learned Tub-tatlers, and inspirde barn-bablers,
This will the grace amongst plebean squablers,
Bray what thou will, more then Cumanus Ass,
But in a Lions skin, withal to pass
For Lamb or Sheep tho like a Fox too badd
Thou smell) in a white Lambs skin yet be clad,
For thou will nere effect thine ends in evil,
Unless thou seemst an Angel, or white Devil,
So in Religious Maskes, broach plots from hell,
Like Herod Ishmaell Judas Iezabel,
Chief cloak all sects schisms, pests with fair pretense
Of Liberty for sooth of conscience
So the Jews Thalmand, Alchoran of Turks,
And popish Mass, may further thy worst works
Observe all humors; but reprove them nor,
For then some kicking heels full well I worcester,
Were thou a Paul, would spurn the out of place
(As Gadarens did Christ) would hate the, Barrabas grace
Desert lies dead, the way to rise is flatter,
To fall is truth Crows will do more then charten
Even pick out eyes of those, their nests who spoil
Michaes and Labans rore, and keep strange coile
For Idols refr; for Household Gods not Goods
Pagans have hazzarded their lives and bloods;
Therefore dear Dunce to sleep in thy warm skin
No Schism tax, tho hell harched nor no sin.
Boys will adore that Master as half God,
Who casts away both Ferula and Rod,
And liberty gives to Jack to sport with Gill,
To play the wantons, and do what they will,
Once get a Christ and then keep Holyday,
Pure souls it is the flesh that sins not they.
And yet I know without a Christ possessed,
In body spirit soul none can be blessed,
Our Brother Mahomet, in his sect thus thrives
Allowing lusts, wine, weomen many wives
And so shall we: well brother cunn your Cew
Now taught, and till we mere again adieu.
