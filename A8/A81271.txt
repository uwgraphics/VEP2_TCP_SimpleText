Old Marine Regiments, pursuant to his Majesty's Establishment; And having
served as such, till the said Regiments were broke, viz. till the First of
October School. And there having been a sufficient Provision made by this
Honorable House for the Payment of the said Regiments, as appears by the Votes
of the Tenth of March 1697, wherein this Honorable House has given for the
Pay of the said Two Marine Regiments, the Sum of Fifty five thousand Five
hundred and Twenty Pounds, which Sum is more than His Majesty's Establishment,
by Thirteen hundred and Sixteen Pounds and Ten Shillings: Notwithstanding
which, the said Edward Douglas is neither admitted into Half-Pay, nor paid his
Arrears.

appointed Deputy Muster-Master to the Four Marine Regiments, although wholly
Incapable of performing the Duty of the said Employment; And is at this time

Half-pay, (as the Commissary and the other Deputy are;) Or that he may be paid
his Arrears out of the Sum of Fifty five thousand Five Hundred and Twenty
Pounds, Provided by this Honorable House, as aforesaid.
