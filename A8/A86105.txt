Have amongst you my Masters.
GIve ear, give ear, unto my Ditty,
All you good people love this City;
It Is high time you repent.
For if the offended Army come
This City will be quite undone:
Your cases I lament.
When you your outworks should defend,
Some Villain whom you think your friend
May set the Town on fire.
Then will they straight to plunder fall,
And in an instant rob you all:
Then they have their desire.
If once the Army do appear
Within ten miles, they come too near,
They have so many friends.
Send all they call for, with new Ropes
About their necks; there may be hopes
That may make some amends.
For thus much from me understand,
What e're they ask they may command;
Take heed you do not dally.
If they shall find with them you halt,
And take you tripping in a fault,
You Will pay dear for your folly.
Make ready those who laid the plot
(Who e're they were) to call the Scot.
They have undone the Nation:
Then make the Synod ready next,
Who have so much abused the Text
For the Churches Reformation.
To bring the Scotch Presbytery in,
They with Rebellion did begin,
Then preached the Myter down.
These new Popes thought they could dispense
With Treason or the like offense;
Especially their own.
Or else (methinks) they durst not sure
The King, and Bishops both abjure
When they the Covenant took.
Though many oaths they all have taken,
By this they have the King forsaken,
If they be pleased to look.
Next bring in those who did devise
Your Sequestrations, and Excize;
Down with their Goldsmiths Hall,
Or rather hell, for none comes there,
But he himself must first forswear;
And that is the worst of all.
Besides he must himself confess
A grand Malignant, that is no less
Then Traitor in their sense:
And make himself a Traitor, more
Then ever he was yet before,
By a far worse offense.
He must use their forged Seal e're he
From their Committees can be free:
That Is Treason Paramount.
This favor they to us afford.
To make us Traitors on Record,
And in the Laws account.
But oh! those subtle men must not
(Above all others) be forgot,
We Jews of Malta call;
Who lately have a new trick found,
To make men for their own compound.
These get the Devil and all.
The State we know it lately has
Borrowed too much on public Faith;
These juggling Jews they say,
By Ordinance of Parliament
Get threescore pounds at least per cent.
And they have present pay.
The abused who the money lent,
Are with this great loss well content
They may some part secure:
Thus are their private Stocks employed,
And all their Creditors destroyed,
By those their Loans ensure.
Brave Soldiers couple these together
Like Hell Hounds, and then send them hither;
Try them but in the Tower.
Let brave Judge Jenkins give them Law,
And honest Will* the Inditements draw,
They 'll dispatch in an hour.
Yet I dare swear that they should find
In The good old Judge a noble mind,
And should more justice have
With mercy and with judgment mixed,
(For so true Justice should be fixed)
Then ever yet they gave.
If the Army do their Sovereign own,
And shall restore him to his Crown,
'Twill be a glorious thing.
Though in their hearts the Prophets ly'd,
It will prove true they prophesied
He Will be a glorious King.
Thou will deserve immortal glory,
And famous be in every story,
If this be done by thee.
Though the English were well-neere as bold,
As the Scots were their Sovereign sold,
Fairfax will glorious be.
We Will Bonefires make, our Bells shall ring,
Our Children shall thy praises sing;
I hope that day to see,
That we who now thy Prisoners are,
Shall have in thee so great a share,
To love and honor thee.
FINIS.
