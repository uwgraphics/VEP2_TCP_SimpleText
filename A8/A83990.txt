Englands Remedy of a deadly Malady: The VVise-womans SAVING THE CITY ABEL, BY
Delivering the head of SHEBA, who was a Traitor to the Commonwealth of Israel.
Which serves as a pattern, whereby the City of London may be saved, by the
wise endeavors of the Citizens thereof, like this Wise-womans, (which are upon
divine record both for our learning and imitation) even by delivering up to Law
and justice, the Traitors to the Commonwealth of England. Otherwise, if they
(under the color of defending themselves, Parliament, or City) do any longer
shelter such wicked men (as vipers in their bosoms) or take up arms against
our renowned Army, or any having their commission for such a just, reasonable,
and lawful demand, will they not manifest to the world, that they themselves
are not only Traitors to the Commonwealth, both in partaking with the wicked,
and condemning the just, but are guilty of whatsoever bloodshed, ruin or
desolation, may possibly come upon them and their posterity? And the malady
consists in the Parliaments injustice of all sorts; self-interests, and
grinding the faces of the poor; such as their illegal sentences, unjust
imprisonments, burning by the common Hangman, the just Petitions of all the
free Commons Liberties, detaining the hire of the laborers, not duly regarding
widows, fatherless, nor maimed Soldiers: variable Votes, forced Covenants,
and time-serving Ordinances, even to justify the wicked, and condemn the just;
and so to make all freeborn English People the worst of slaves, after they
are brought low by all sorts of oppressions and delusions, under several
notions, and have both done all their best endeavors, and paid all beyond
their powers.

THE WISE-WOMANS saving the City Abel, by delivering the head of SHEBA, 2 Samuel

who was a Traitor to the Kingdom of Israel. Which serves as a pattern,
whereby the city of London may be saved, by the wise endeavors of the Citizens
thereof, like this Wise-womans, (who is upon divine record, both for our
learning and imitation) even by delivering up to Law and Justice, the Traitors

defending themselves, Parliament or City) do any longer shelter such wicked
men, (as vipers in their bosoms) or take up arms against our renowned Army,
or any others, having their Commission, for such a just, reasonable, and
lawful demand, will they not manifest to the whole world, that they themselves
are not only Traitors also to the Commonwealth, both in partaking with the
wicked, and condemning the just, but are guilty of whatsoever bloodshed,
ruin, or desolation, may possibly come upon them and their posterity?

cast him into the sea, and the sea ceased from her raging.

When the wicked rise, men hide themselves, but when they perish, the righteous
increase.

Justice exalts a nation, but sin is a shame to any people.

In the prosperity of the righteous the city rejoices, and when the wicked
perish, there is joy.


SO soon as the Kingdom of Israel was delivered from Absolons treason, there
arose another Rebel against King David, whose name was Sheba, who took
occasion from the emulation and hot contention, which was between the ten
Tribes, 2 Samuel 2^
concerning the bringing back of the King to Jerusalem, even to blow the
bellows, and kindle the fire of division between them, whiles the coals were
hot, and to proclaim with sound of Trumpet in the name of all the ten Tribes,
We have no part in David neither have we inheritance in the Son of Jesse, to
your Tents O Israel

So that by the instigation of this one wicked man, there was a great division
made between many thousands of Brethren and Friends, who descended all of one
stock, even a revolt of the ten Tribes, and so a rent of David's Kingdom.

As this Sheba being here described by his brethren and kindred to be the son
of Bichri and of Benjamins Tribe, as King Saul was, so was he of Saul
spightfull disposition, still retaining the bitter taste of the old caske of
Saul's Court, which is also noted of Shimei, by his reviling of David, when he
was driven away by Absolon; both which old Courtiers, had not yet laid aside
their old grudge against David and the State of his Kingdom

The vigilance and activity of this treacherous Sheba is thus noted, that when
he sees David at the weakest, then he takes most advantage in the pursuance
of his design to be strongest, draws the ten Tribes into his faction, and
betaketh himself to Abel a strong and walled City, whereof Joab (the chief
Captain of David's host) having intelligence, he presently lays siege to the
City, destroys and casts down the walls thereof being (as it seems)
provoked thereunto by the Citizens, standing out against the siege in a wrong
cause, even in defense of the Ttraytor Sheba under color of defending their
City.

Whereas Joab (it appears) had no quarrel at all to the City, it being a
branch of the King his Masters Kingdom, but only as it was an obstruction to
hinder his pursuit against one Rebel and his faction in the City who had thus
highly offended the King; so that there is a distinction here to be made
between the City it self, and the traitorous faction of conspirators which
were sheltered therein, whereof this Sheba was the head.

Upon this fierce assault by Joab, thus provoked in his zeal for the weal of
the Kingdom, and for avoiding of further strife and division, it pleases God
(in his tender compassion of the City) to move a woman of the City, to cry from
the wall to Joabs Soldiers, that Joab would come near and speak with her; by
this her desiring a parle, and the event thereof, she is called (as she truly
deserves) a wise woman, because she takes the wisest and best course to
preserve the City, as does appear also by the effect.

Whereas if she had not by her wisdom broken off both the folly of the
Citizens, and the fury of the Adversaries, it might have possibly been turned
to ashes, and by that means many thousands therein who knew not the right hand
from the left, (as well as others of greater age) might have been brought to
great misery, if not speedy destruction: So that to stand out in defense and
maintenance of Traitors and Enemies to the common weal, under the specious
pretense of defending a City, and not render them up to justice, upon just and
lawful demand, is enough to provoke both God and man to punish the whole City,
for so many wicked and traitorous Sheba's as be sheltered therein.

We read of this very Tribe of Benjamin formerly, Judge. 19.20, 21. Chap.
that for their unjustly maintaining and not justly punishing that horrid fact
of those sons of Belial amongst them, who abused the Levites Concubine to
death, all the other Tribes of Irael rose up in arms as one man, and revenged
it upon them to their destruction, though they were their brethren, and that
for their wicked obstinacy in that heinous sin, without any repentance or godly
sorrow: so that of five and twenty thousand mighty and valourous men, only six
hundred escaped to tell news.

And if for want and refusal of doing justice in such a particular case, the
ten Tribes rose up and destroyed almost a whole Tribe, and that by the
Commandment of God himself, seeing those who were guiltless, took part with
the guilty, and so the whole lump leavened alike: then how is a whole Kingdom
engaged to take revenge of any part thereof, which does labor and maintain
notorious Traitors and malicious Enemies to the Commonwealth, when justice is
demanded of them? For as God hates all wickedness, injustice, tyranny and
oppression, amongst particular or private men, so how much more does he hate
treason and treachery, against a whole Nation or Commonwealth?

But howsoever, whether they either forbear or do their endeavor, though
hand join in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished: such grievous designs
do never go scot-free, but are revenged of God or his instruments, without
speedy repentance to prevent such deserved judgments: and no Nation in the
world can show more famous examples in this kind then England, it being so
often attempted to be betrayed both by strangers and others, but still
preserved of God (to his everlasting praise.) Insomuch that a famous man said
of England, Regnum Angliae, Polydor. Virgil.
Regnum Dei, the Kingdom of England is Gods Kingdom, for none takes any true
of real care of preserving it, but God only.

One word by the way, the Author of this Dictaum living in England, did well
observe what a careless, wicked, and selfe-betraying State it has ever been,
consisting of a mixed people gathered out of several Nations, and therefore he
attributed to God alone, the many and miraculous deliverances of this sinful
Nation, as we have far greater cause now then he had then, to acknowledge in
all these seven years Occurrences, especially by the miscarriage of that
bloody Petition, which should have been delivered by thrice forty thousand
armed men, for which the wars began; the deliverance at Edgehill, Newbery, and
Brainford, when we should have been absolutely betrayed, had not God only been
on our side, and showed himself to be the Lord of hosts, and God of battles,
in so mightily rescuing and delivering us out of the jaws and claws of all
our mighty and strong enemies, who were ready and bent at all those occasions
to devour and swallow us up from being a people any more.

But to adhere to our intended purpose: this wise-woman takes courage, and
speaks to Ioab: Was not this a wonder, that there was never a wise man in
this City? But God who oftentimes saves both by weak instruments, and
despised means, was pleased to make this woman the instrument of thus using
the means in saving a besieged city in Israel, from all the power and forces
of a great King; even as he made that poor wise man spoken of by Solomon,
Eccles. 9.
the instrument of delivering another City, who therefore declared, that
wisdom was better then weapons of war, and yet no man regarded (much less
rewarded) that poor wise man.

As Abigail the wife of Nabal was a happy instrument to pacify the fury of
King David and all his followers against her husband for his churllishnesse, 1 Samuel 25.
so was this woman to assuage the fury of Ioab the chief Captain of all his
forces here against this city: and it pleased God so to bless the means which
those two women used, that both the King and Ioab hearkened to their good
counsel, and were contented to depart in peace, without offering injury or
violence to any: So that it is good not to slight the wholesome advice of an
inferior, more then an equal, or a superior. If Naaman the Syrian had
despised the good counsel of his own wise servant, and not washed himself in
Jordan, 2 King. 5.19
according to the direction of the Prophet, rather then in the rivers of
Damascus, he might have returned home, and died in his leprosy; yea and
besides, he had not been so well confirmed and persuaded in his faith against
his former ignorance and impiety, which he confessed upon his cleansing, and
thankful returning to the Prophet, who cured him. If King Ahab had not hated
Micaiah, and prejudged his wise and good counsel, 1 King. 22.
against his going up to Ramoth-Gilead, he had not lost his life and kingdom:
but he following the wicked advice of false Prophets, who stirred him up to
make a new war, was one cause both of his own, and his posterities ruin.

As false Prophets are known by many other bitter fruits, so chiefly by these
two special marks. First, they are always eager and thirsty after blood, both
like their father the Devil that murderer from the beginning, and that Whore
mentioned in the Revelation. And next, they are no wise so hot for just peace,
as for unjust war. Was not Jerusalems destruction the more deserved, because
they hearkened to false Prophets, that spoke lies in the name of the Lord, and
despised the true Prophet Jeremiah, who spoke as the Lord immediately directed
him. And did not that zealous King Josiah himself, after all his matchless
reformation, receive a mortal wound for going out inconsiderately to battle
against Pharaoh Neho king of Egypt (as is likely) without advice either of God,
2 Chronicles. ^ 34, 35.
or Jeremiah the Prophet? yea and distrusting that Pharaoh came not forth
against him, but his enemies the Assyrians: and though his intention was just
and good, even to defend his own Land, yet for this his trespass of temerity
and rashness, he was punished with temporal death, but being so worthy a
King, there was more mourning and greater lamentation for him, then any King
that ever was in the world: Oh for such a good King as Josiah, and such a grave
Parliament as the Elders of Judah and Jerusalem were in his days! then we
should have a blessed and glorious Reformation not only in word and show, but
in deed and substance, to some purpose.

But to proceed, this woman is not like too many now adays, who claim unjust
titles, for she well deserves her title to be called wise, because she is so
indeed, in that she thus loves a just peace, and hates an unjust war, which
is the main end and scope of her parle with Joab; and is she is very excellent
in the pacifying of Joabs fury by forcible arguments, so is she no less
active and resolute in persuading the people of the City by sound reasons, to
yield to her just desires, both for their own safety and that which is their
bound duty, even to deliver the head of Sheba that Traitor, who so troubled the
Commonwealth of Israel.

And therefore as God blessed her as a peacemaker, in prevailing with Joab, so
also with the people, (for they finding her reasons to be just and right,
ordered to cut off the head of Sheba, and to cast it over the walls to Joab,
which accordingly was done) so Joab blew the Trumpet, retired from the City,
and every man to his Tent: Thus by the means of those unto whom God gives
wisdom to order things aright, how contemptible soever they be in the eyes of
the world, both good duties may be timely performed, evil consequences wisely
prevented, yea and heavy judgments removed, as we see also by the happy issue
of Phineas his zeal in the execution of Zimri and Cosbi, even in the very act
of their heinous sin of Adultery. And without the execution of justice, here
demanded by Joab, there is no peace with Joab, yea no peace with God; for if he
(the Lord of Hosts) be offended and no means used nor followed whereby his
anger may be assuaged, as he is a just God, and the true owner of vengeance, he
must needs be revenged, and has all the creatures at his call, always to
execute his Will, as by one Angel he smote a hundred fourscore and five
thousand of Senacheribs Army in one night; howsoever wicked men (who he
oftentimes catches in the very same snares which they lay for others) thinks
that he has neither number enough of instruments, nor magazine great enough of
judgments to catch them in the height and pursuit of their sins.

What a vain question was that of Joram to Jehu? Is it peace Jehu? What peace
answered he, so long as the whoredoms of thy mother Iesabel, and her
witchcrafts are so many? God would have justice done upon the bloody house of
Ahab, and upon Iesabel for Naboths blood, what peace can be then till this be
done? So here was a wicked Sheba, a Traitor to the State, who with his strong
faction intended the overthrow of David's Kingdom, which was a type of Christ's
Kingdom, and likewise to nullify the privileges and liberties of the
freeborn people, for his own coverous and ambitious ends.

This wise woman likewise professes her self to Ioab, to be one of them that
are peaceable and faithful in Israel, and this she does not for her own
private respects only, but much more for the commonweal of Abel her City: To
be peaceable is very commendable, but especially in one who also is faithful;
for, peacablenesse has most respect to man, but faithfulness both to God and
man; to God, in holding forth his truth, and to man, in giving good example by
holy conversation, that men seeing the good works of faith (which are wrought
by love) may glorify God, and (through his grace) become of the same
profession: And faithfulness also to man does consist in the discharge of all
duties, especially of that trust which those who have undoubted power, do
commit to the charge of those whom they choose: and the other do not only
undertake, but faithfully vow and promise to perform with all their power for
the public good: and herein, if they be either remiss, corrupt, or false, do
they not falsify their faith, and betray that great trust, by bending all
their affections, and employing all their studies for their own private ends:
so that by this means they transform themselves from being any more Trustees,
but become a faction of Traitors to the people who deputed them, not to advance
themselves as masters, but the Commonwealth whereof they are servants,
excepting so far as their own share is included.

This faithfulness both to God and man finds so little favor and
entertainment now adays, that it is accounted rather a vice then a virtue,
except only among such as be also faithful and well-principled: and although
though they who hate faithfulness and faithful men do in word and show
pretend peace, yet in deed and substance they hunt after war, like to those
deceitful Prophets that bite with their teeth and cry peace, but he that
puts not into their mouths, they prepare war against him, even as now their
brethren those popish Priests and English tythe-mongers, do still in these sad
days of Englands misery.

And as this wise woman is peaceable, so she is faithful, and so peaceable and
so faithful, that the peace she seeks is so just, and the faith she
manifests is so true, that she permits neither of them to putrify by
resting at home with her self, but so imployeth them in the works of love,
that they extend themselves and run like clear rivers abroad unto others, and
that not to a few friends, neighbors, nor familiars, but to the whole City
where she lives.

Another point of her wisdom may be observed, first, in the wise and sure
foundation of her arguments from Gods Word, and next by the judicious stating
thereof by way of interrogatories or questions, as the most choice and pregnant
ways to daunt the fury either of friends or adversaries, and that even by
giving them some hint of their own fault in their vehement pursuance of
revenge, otherwise (as it seems) then by due order, especially when there is
no other forcible nor probable means of resistance, as appears by the story.

She charge Ioab (as it seems) with a breach of Gods Law, where it is
forbidden ( Deuteronomy. 20.10, 11.) to fight against a City until peace be offered
unto it, which (belike) he had not done, and therefore apprehending his own
ignorance or negligence, was touched by the truth, sense, and force of her
words; as also she thus pleads; as if she should say, howsoever others may
out of their unadvisednesse make some resistance to Ioab and his Army, contrary
to her mind and will, yet she (not being able to amend nor hinder them) for her
own part, is one of them that are peaceable and faithful in the City, yea and
a mother in Israel: and therefore why would he presume or offer to destroy the
inheritance of the Lord?

The sad apprehension of which words, made such a deep impression in Ioabs
heart, that he very soberly and discreetly cleared himself, by the reality and
integrity of his intentions, saying, God forbid; God forbid it me, that I
should devour or destroy it: the matter is not so, but a man of Mount Ephraim
( Sheba the son of Bichri by name) has lift up his hand against the King,
even against David, deliver us him only, and I will depart from the City: and
the woman said, Behold his head shall be thrown to thee over the wall.

Then the woman went unto all the people with her wisdom, and they cut off the
head off Sheba, the Son of Bichri, and cast it to Ioab, then he blew the
Trumpet, and they retired from the City, every man to his Tent and Ioab
returned to Jerusalem unto the King.

To prevent an Objection here, in the wise woman's speech to Joab, she says
thus, they spoke in the old time saying, they should ask of Abell, and so have
they continued; now whether she means only the place, mentioning the same by
the name, that those who besiege a City (as the City Abell) ought first to
offer peace to that City, as is formerly observed, of that Joab and his
soldiers ought to have asked of the City Abell, whether or no they would
deliver Sheba, and to have offered them peace upon deliverie of him, and not to
have broken down the wall without any such question or condition, contrary to
the Law of God, common sense and custom, which may be drawn from these words
of her speech, and so have they continued, or that they should ask concerning
the person Abel, calling to mind his innocent blood, alluding to the people in
the City, who had not procured such an assault, by any misdemeanour proceeding
from themselves, either of which senses or interpretations, may be pertinent
enough to the scope of what she intended, in her dispute or speech to Ioab.

And the reason why Ioab was so easily pacified from all his fury, and getting
justice only against one Traitor, though there were a number of others in the
City, he himself declares in the History, that the intent of his coming was
to have justice only against one man, and the cause was formerly showed, even
that he was the ringleader to all the rest in rebellion; according to the old
true proverb, which a Member of the Parliament for once repeating in the House
(where oftentimes truth has no place nor admittance) pereat unus potius quam
unitas, it is better that one (or a few) perish, then a multitude, Corporation
City, or Nation, was commanded to the bar and committed to prison, where he
continued for a whole year at least.

Now all that is to be inferred from what is here spoken, does briefly tend to
this effect, there are many opinions concerning the intentions of our renowned
Army, especially for their advancing to this City: Why? what is the matter? Does
it not consist of very rational men? And do not you think, but they have many
strong reasons and both weighty and urgent causes for what they do: We not
only know by report but feel by experience, that there is not only one Sheba
among us, but too many ringleaders of rebellion, incendiaries of sedition, and
raisers of anew war, which the Army do demand and pursue, that they may be
delivered up to the law, and tried according to justice, which is the first and
most special and effectual means to recover both our Laws, peace and
liberties; out of which all the freeborn people of England are like to be
stripped naked, and so are in a most dangerous capacity of slaverie and misery.

And if there be such treacherous enemies to the Commonwealth and betrayers of
there trust concerning the recoverie and defense of our Laws and liberties,
detained sheltered and maintained in and about the City of London, as that
Rebel Sheba was in the City Abell, is there so much as my show or color of
reason to the contrary, but that the whole people of the land as one man (if it
were possible) should seek all lawful and timely redress for justice: as in
the case of the ten Tribes, against that of Benjamin before cited, and of
Achan, Iesabel and many others.

Therefore whosoever or how many soever shall oppose them in so lawful and
needful apursuit, will manifest themselves to be as great Traitors and enemies
to the Commons of England as the other, who are thus impeached, yea and if it
were in the way of revenge, failing of ordinary justice, (as this act of Joabs
pursuing Sheba may seem to be) it is neither cruelty nor war, but rather a
seeking of justice, and consequently of peace, in so following after it.

One thing is to be feared, and another to be wished; the first is, that the
Citizens are not so diligent to treat with the Parliament for doing of justice,
as they are with the Army for yielding to peace without justice: for this woman
was as careful to deal with the Citizens, as she was with Joab, so soon as
she knew his mind: And the next is, that neither Parliament not City permit
their Clergy any more to preach war in the City; and peace in the Army, nor
that such Incendiaries nor deceivers (as those Priests and their followers) be
suffered any more to entice and poison, yea and undermine the weaker sort of
the Army, but be quite returned.

As this wise woman undertaketh, begineth, proceeds, and prospers, in this
great business, as appears by Ioab and the Citizens both hearing and
following her counsels, because they all attend to justice, so by that most
powerful, effectual, and commendable means, which she uses, it pleases God
so to order the business, that thereby justice is duly and speedily executed,
and so all is made quiet, even as when Jonah was cast into the sea, the
powerful raging thereof was changed into a great calm.

But in regard the matter is historical, and needs little illustration, or
scarce any application, it being so suitable to our present condition,
therefore I will add a simile for conclusion; this whole Kingdom at the
beginning of this Parliament, may be parallelled with Gedions Army of two and
thirty thousand, when he went to battle against the Midianites, not in regard
of our greater quantity or number, but rather of our quality and nature, this
Nation being a mixed people, like Gideons Army of good and bad soldiers, able
and unable, whereof the greatest part were the open enemies of our peace, and
so very unfit to fight for our lives, Laws or Liberties, at least whilst
they were under that banner.

But those two and thirty thousand being fined, and a party singled out from
amongst them, extending to ten thousand, which were not altogether so timorous,
and therefore somewhat more likely to carry on the work in the day of battle:
this party is like our mixed Parliamentary multitude, being chosen by all
sorts, or rather several dispositions of people as appears by the fruit and
effect proceeding from the cause, and as every living creature does naturally
produce and bring forth others both of the same kind and similitude.

And these ten thousand of Gideons Army who were thus fined, being still unfit
for the intended business notwithstanding, therefore they were refined to
three hundred, which may be accounted those military members of valourous and
victorious Soldiers of our Army, by whom as the Lord has done great works to
his endless praise, so our hope is, that the same God will do yet greater
works against both our open and secret enemies, yea and pretended friends, to
his own glory and all our comforts who trust in him, either by them or others.

We bless his divine Majesty, that like this wise woman he has made this
City so wise, as to send forth some of their Aldermen and other ancients to
parle with that renowned Army concerning the present expedition, of whose
wisdom and fidelity both to the City, Parliament, and Commonwealth, as they
have had already very sufficient, so shall they have (no doubt) abundant
satisfaction; yea and will (we hope) crown the same with such happy and
gracious effects to the joy of all faithful and true-hearted English, both of
this age, and all succeeding ages, as never King nor Parliament together nor
apart did the like, since England was first a plantation, before it began to be
a Nation.

AMEN.
The Malady, consisting in the Parliaments injustice of all sorts,
selfe-interestes and grinding the faces of the poor, such as their illegal
sentences, unjust imprisonments, burning (by the common-hangman) the just
Petitions of all the Commons Liberties, etc.
MAy not England now say, behold and see, all ye that pass by, is there any
sorrow like unto my sorrow? Is not this our our fruitful land, like to become
a barren wilderness, even for the wickedness of the Inhabitants? Is not this
fearful judgment of new wars justly deserved, both for the crying sins and
great abominations which so powerfully reign (...) all estates, even from the
highest to the lowest? And that not always nor altogether by means of
professed enemies, but rather as often, and sometimes much more of pretended
friends, yea even of a strong party in our own household of Commons: for that
House being (as it were) the salt to season all the unsavory practices and
proceedings of others, by their assembling for that business, in the behalf of
all the Commons of England, if they themselves should lose the savor,
wherewith shall they be salted? Will they in such a case be good for any
thing, but to be cast out is corrupt and rotten Members?

What people or Nation did ever more freely not only adventure, but even
sacrifice their lives, blood, livelihoods and estates in the defense and for
the maintenance both of the Parliaments own lives, Privileges and estates
(even when they had neither Army nor Guard) so long as they seemed to stand for
our Lives, Laws and Liberties, which they have so often promised, protested,
declared, vowed and sworn to recover and defend, and we so long expected, yea
and have so much deserved, as well by the right of purchase, as of birth and
native inheritance.

Long have we and our Predecessors sighed and groaned under the heavy burdens
of former oppressions, by means of cruel taskmasters, even for a Parliament
of six months, (never so much as dreaming of seven years) and that to have had
our just Petitions granted, and our unjust grievances redressed, all wicked
Laws abolished, and good Laws established, we looked for comfort, but behold
sorrow; we have only a charge of oppressors, but still the same oppressions,
though under other notions.

And did not our own House of Commons, whom we both choosed and trusted to
defend our Laws and liberties, at their first sitting so abundantly encourage
us, both by their legal practices and fair carriages, that we could not with
any conscience of our duties, or sense of our miseries, deny to adventure our
lives, nor bestow our estates for their help, maintenance, and assistance? For
did not they release the prisoners, bring home the banished, utter many
excellent speeches in the defense of our Laws, Liberties, Persons and estates?
Did not they abolish the Star Chamber, High Commission, and Councell-Table
Monopolies, and Ship-moneyes? Did not they demolish many Crosses, May-poles,
and high Altars? And, did they not make many Fast-dayes, and begin to bring
wicked men to condign punishment?

But so soon as they by these plausible, powerful and effectual means, and
the Clergies eloquence, had got into their hands the Commonwealths moneys,
plate, and all things else, which might either encourage or maintain a number
of soldiers to bring home the King with some bad Counselors from York to the
Parliament, they so tasted the sweetness and benefit thereof, that they not
only used all forcible and effectual means to get more and more of the
Kingdoms money at their dispose, until they not only made themselves rich,
and the Commonwealth poor, but out of their abundance did divide the spoil,
which comes by the ruins of the people liberally amongst themselves, and send
upon all convenient occasions beyond the Seas, so that these our Trustees at
Westminster, are quite changed and degenerated from their first love, and have
betrayed that great and public trust which all the Commons of England have
reposed in them, which was chiefly to rectify all kind of Tyranny and
Oppression, but therein are so short, that they are become the greatest Tyrants
and Oppressors themselves.

For, do they not only hate and discountenance all who have been their best and
truest friends, in their greatest both wants and other extremities, but
prefer to all places of trust, power and command, both in Parliament and
Commonwealth, even those who have assisted their and our enemies in these
times, and have been always refractary to all goodness? Do they not still
reject (as they have done for a long time) all worthy Petitions for Englands
Liberties, and very thankfully accept all that are destructive, cross or
contrary thereunto?

Do they not only advance those who seek to undermine, sell and betray both
us, themselves and posterities, with all our freedoms, for some preferments,
base or private respects, to fulfill their own lusts, but likewise imprison,
threaten and revile the other well-affected party, calling them factious and
seditious enemies to the State, and the like, who do petition for such lawful
privileges as is their due to have, and the Parliaments duty to give, yea and
condemn some of those honest and peaceable peoples best Petitions, which do
contain all Englands liberties, to be burned by the common Hangman?

And did they not only most unjustly and undutifully reject the just and
humble Petitions of diverse worthy Counties lately for the same Liberties? Do
they not still oppress the poor, and grind their faces, by paying of Excise,
rather then subside according to Law and reason, to lay such burdens for the
public good on the rich, who have lands and abilities to bear and endure
them? and yet notwithstanhing, the public debts and Soldiers are unpayed,
widows, fatherless and maimed soldiers unprovided, and the public
treasury emptied.

Yea and which does reach highest of all, they are grown to such an impudency
both of injustice and ingratitude, against that worthy and renowned Army who
preserved their lives, and secured their estates, that when they were
addressing themselves to petition their own General, concerning very modest
and reasonable requests, that he might (if he thought expedient) present them
to the House, they declared highly against that just Petition of the Army, and
all the Army themselves, calling them enemies to the State, and the like, if
they proceeded any further therein, and endeavored by all possible means
either to disband, divide, or delude them, though since (upon not prevailing,
and the Armies standing) they have recalled that Declaration, without any
regard either to justice, honor, sin or shame, thinking thereby to have given
the Army some kind of satisfaction, by such counterfeit repentance, and forced
humiliation, even as if the Army, who have the sword to act, and they but the
word to vote, would have been deceived by them, as they have cheated the
Commonwealth.

But to be short, because we are all like to be assaulted with a stronger
temptation then ever we were heretofore, and that very speedily, we have great
need therefore to cast our greatest care and confidence on God, and then we
need not care nor fear what man can do, we will be dealt withal either by
flattery or force, if not by both, to go up (as it were) to Bamath-Gilead and
prosper, even to take up arms against our own beloved brethren and
contrymen, flesh of our flesh, and bone of our bone, that most terrible Army
with Banners, who through God, have done valiantly in subduing all our open
enemies: but we must altogether refuse, upon whatsoever terms offered or
pretended, least in obeying the lusts and arbitrary wills of wicked, covetous,
ambitious and time-serving men, who thirst after blood, think to escape in the
press, and still fish in troubled waters, we fight against God, be traitors to
our Country, guilty of much innocent blood, absolve the wicked, condemn the
just, and show our selves (both by evil example and otherwise) both unjust and
unthankful, even in rendering evil for good, as now the Parliament does to us.

For as this Army, when former Armies could not, have been the chiefest
instruments of delivering us from regal oppression, so they are the most
hopeful worldly power to free us from Parliamentary corruption, to see the
time of each Parliament limited, and how often to be called, just liberty for
tender consciences provided, just Laws made and executed, unjust Laws
abolished, our just Petitions received, read and granted, our grievances
redressed, this Parliament from all corrupt Members purged, all our just
Liberties recovered, all who are unjustly imprisoned, justly released, and
their illegal sufferings of all others since the Parliament began, legally
repaired, the great accounts of the public Treasury required, widows,
fatherless, maimed soldiers, and all other sorts of poor maintained, just men
advanced to places of trust, both in Parliament and Commonwealth, and unjust
men deposed and punished, so shall it be well with us, and our posterity
throughout all Generations.

But if otherwise, we yield now to wicked men's desires, for their own covetous
and ambitious ends, and no good to us, when we have done all we can, yea and
past the bounds of our abilities, we shall have no more thanks nor reward, then
now we have of the Parliament for all our unspeakable both actions and
sufferings, but be made such kind of beggars and slaves, both in our
spiritual and temporal conditions, as we shall be a proverb and a hissing
to all Nations, even as Gods own peculiar people the Jews were, who had many
happy opportunities and gracious influences of Gods special favors, to have
made them the most renowned, famous, yea and invincible people that ever were
upon the face of the earth.

An Appendix containing diverse worthy particulars belonging to the premises,
which do most consist in Objections and Answers.
IF any do demand why the Remedy is placed here before the Malady, it is
done because there be too many maladies and too few remedies, and therefore I
place here first what is rarest, and last which is oftenest or most frequent,
as the Prophet Nathan had his cure and remission ready, to pronounce for David's
sins, before ever he by his wise parable, convinced him thereof.

And whereas some may object, that our Army under the command of Sir Thomas
Fairfax, have not such power and authority of King nor Kingdom, to demand
those eleven Members of the House of Commons, to be secured and delivered up to
justice, as Joab had of King David or his Kingdom, to pursue Sheba, or besiege
a City for him? It is answered, that the Captain General of our Army, has as
much power and authority at least, to do what he has now undertaken, as Ioab
the Captain General of King David's Army had, for what he undertook: for as
the one tended to the well and safety of that Kingdom, so the other tends to
the well and safety of this Kingdom, which is, and always should be, the
maine end both of all wars and governments. If either the Citizens of London
had offered, or the Army of England had desired, the heads of these eleven
Members, as was both offered and accepted concerning Sheba, rather then that so
reasonable a demand to have their persons only, to be alive secured until
they be tried, it might have imported severity in the one, and cruelty in the
other; but since neither were so much as once mentioned, wherein then is the
Army unjust, unreasonable, unequitable or any wise cruel, as both
Parliament Men, who have so bad a conscience that they cannot endure trial,
and others would suggest and surmise to the rude people, even by their base
Queries and other aspersions, which they employ such as themselves also to
divulge?

If it be objected, that the Citizens of London are not so able to solicit or
importune the Parliament of England for justice in this kind for the Army, as
the wise woman and Citizens of Abel, were to procure justice of such forces
belonging to the ten Tribes, as did accompany Sheba to that City in this his
rebellion? It is answered, that the Citizens of London are more able, not only
to solicit, but even to prevail with the Parliament for those eleven men for
diverse respects, which may be easilier understood, then the Citizens of Abel
were with the ten Tribes concerning Sheba, yea and the ten Tribes of Israel
were as great (I suppose) for that City to deal with, though within the walls
thereof, as the Parliament of England is to this City, which is so near
adjoining.

If others do object that our General has not a Commission from the Commons
of England (for whose Liberties he and his Army now stands) to go against the
Parliament, upon whatsoever color or pretense? It is answered, that he and his
Army have as fair a Commission at least, of the Commons so to do, as Joab and
his soldiers had of King David or the Kingdom of Judah and Israel for what
they did; but what out Army does, is no wise against, but altogether for the
Parliament in general, as having relation to the well-being or better
subsisting thereof, chiefly by expulsion of corrupt and rotten Members, who
have lately crept in, and over-voted the well-affected party in the House, like
so many drons in a hive: so that the Army only leads their helping hand to
the Commons of England in this case, for purging their House of Commons, as
they most powerfully and valiantly assisted both them and the Parliament
formerly in another case, by subduing all their open enemies, which neither of
them could do, even by all their former Armies.

And if any would have further satisfaction herein, if they will compare the
19. and 20. Chapters of the 2 Samuel concerning Joabs Commission in that his so
faithful service to the King and Kingdom, with our Armies Engagements,
Declarations, Petitions, and Remonstrances, concerning Sir Thomas Fairfax's
Commission, in his so faithful service to the Kingdom of England, now in this
our extreme necessity, they will find that he has a better Commission then
Joab had in this his pursuit: for as the one prosecuted with zeal for the
weal, safety, and recovery of that Kingdoms Liberties against all
adversaries, he only knowing the mind of the better party, so with the like
zeal does our valiant Captain prosecute for the weal, safety and recovery of
this Kingdoms Liberties, against all adversary powers, knowing the mind of
the well affected, and at the earnest requests and fervent desires of many
distressed and oppressed Commoners, Prisoners, Widows, Fatherless, maimed
Soldiers, poor and others.

And whereas it may be alleged, that our General is out of his office, and
the Army ordered to be disbanded by the Parliament, who both gave him his
office, and them their power, for the use they were at first appointed? It is
answered, what the Parliament gave either him or them, or took from him and
them, they neither gave the one nor took the other, as they are an entire
Corporation or State by themselves alone, but as the representative Body of all
the Commons of England, and so in that respect, but their agents and servants,
even as some Bishop or Minister (after the example of Samuel the Prophet) does
anoint a King, being so ordained by the Kingdom, yet it does not follow by
any good consequence, that such a man merely for his so officiating or
discharging the duty of his Office, is King, Lord, or Master of such a King so
anointed by him, but rather still a subject or servant to him, because he is
so ordained by the people, as by a greater power then his own, to perform
that point of duty, as well as the rest belonging to his Office.

And upon this consideration, he may neither justly say, nor in any respect
dare avow, as Cardinal Weolsey presumptuously wrote to the Pope, I and my King
do such and such things, so that both the Army and the Parliament, or the
Parliament and the Army, (which of them soever may justly at this time have the
first place, as the case now stands, the one having the bare word, and the
other the sharp sword) yea and the King himself, though he were set as high as
Solomon on his throne, are all but the Commons of Englands Servants, and they
only ordained for the weal and better being, but never for the woe and worse
being of the Commonwealth: whereas the Commonwealth was never ordained, for
the better nor worse being of them in any regard, but as they are servants to
it, or as shepherds and watchmen in keeping it in peace, order, and
tranquillity, both from foreign and intestine enemies, and the other as
special instruments both of defending them in the discharge of their offices,
and for that end, of maintaining them in their authorities.

Needful Queres to the Parliament.
Right honorable and truly noble, at least should be, like the men of Berea,
NOt to speak of the crying sins and great abominations, whereof the Kings,
Parliaments, Priests and People of this Nation are guilty, even surpassing the
sins of Sodom and Gomorah, Tyrus and Sydon, in so long enjoying, and yet
never receiving nor obeying the glorious Gospel of Christ, which if they had
had, as our Savior said of Capernaum and Bethsaidah, might possibly have
brought forth better fruits then ever England did; neither to insist of the
innocent blood, which cries from heaven against this Nation, by our betraying,
under the color of helping, that worthy and strong City Rochell, as well by
cheating them of their provision in their extreme famine, when they were so
straightly besieged, as by advancing their enemies with eight great ships to
their utter ruin, starving and desolation, nor yet of the oceans of the
guiltless blood spilt, and treasures spent, of late days amongst our selves,
to small purpose, yea and much thereof by your corruption, carelessenesse,
double-dealing, and other indirect and counterfeit means.

Did ever any Nation give better assistance to any Parliament, then this
distressed Nation have every manner of way given unto you? Was it all done to
make you Lords and Knights, and our selves but servants and slaves? Was it to
set you all in Coaches, and on horseback, and our selves but to run at your
feet? Was it not merely that ye should redress our grievances, and recover
our Liberties, abolish wicked Laws and establish good Laws? But have ye
performed to us either one or other of these your duties? Have ye not rather
made the cure more grievous then the disease, and the last error worse then
the first?

Have ye so often protested, vowed, sworn, and declared before God and the
world, that you would deliver us from all oppression and tyranny? and yet are
not ye your selves become greater oppressors and tyrants then ever we had? Have
ye not against all Law, justice, reason, conscience and profession, both done
many things ye ought not, and left abundance of things undone, which according
to the same grounds, ye were bound to do? Did either Petitions, Informations,
or Admonitions ever prevail with you by word or writing, but rather did you
not hearden your hearts, more and more like Pharaoh? Have ye not always sought
rather to be revenged on such as show you your heinous sins, then any wise
(except in hypocritical Fasts) to amend your faults? Yea, and I appease to
your own consciences, Are not all these but mere shows which now ye make, to
rectify some of the innumerable things that are amiss by your own means,
even rather for slavish and guilty fear of the Armies sword; then out of any
dutiful respect or true favor to the Commons of England, who choosed and
trusted you, and whom (as ye are bound) ye should both serve and respect, if
ye made any conscience of Gods Word?

A faithful Advice to the Army.
Renowned Brethren,
MAny of you know better then I can express, what wise course Josuah that
valiant Captain General (who for a long time fought the Lord of Hosts
Battles in the behalf of his peculiar people the Jews) did take when he saw
the Lord show himself so angry at the sins of the people, (though it was but
of one man) that he made them both fall and fly before their enemies, he
searches diligently (either by lot or otherwise according to the custom of
those days) throughout all the twelve Tribes, in which Tribe, or person of the
Tribe the fault was; and finding it in the royal Tribe of Judah, and in Achan
by name, through his covetousness, (which is the root of all evil) did punish
him according to the nature of his fault.

Ye have both begun and run very well hitherto, yea and win one part of the
prize, praised be God, but I pray, who lets you, that ye will not obey the
truth, but seem to be weary of well-doing: verily I say unto you, if ye sit down
to eat, drink, take tobacco, and rise up to play, there will come such another
alarm and unexpected judgment to waken you, as now ye seem to be to the
Parliament, that may both possibly and speedily sweep you all away. Remember
that the foolish Virgins who knocked at heavens gates out of time were debarred.

Ye know well enough (having such principles) how dangerous it is, to begin in
the Spirit and end in the flesh; and that the more gifts ye have, the more
inexcusable ye are, if your practices be not answerable; have ye both done and
suffered so many things in vain, if so be it be even in vain? All that ye can
either do or suffer yet further, shall profit you nothing, if ye suffer your
selves to be corrupted, bribed, pensioned divided, or deluded. I wish they were
even quite removed far from you, who trouble or disquiet you by doubts,
surmises, shifts, or delays; yea and are not as willing and ready to act and
prosecute, as ye (in your grave resolutions) are to consult, debate and proceed.

Ye both see and hear, yea and (I trow) yet feel, that there is not only one
fault, and one party guilty in the Parliament, where ye have begun to search
(though not yet with a candle, nor with a small seive, but many, whereof ye
accuse some: well, if ye be they who shall deliver England, we need not look
for others, proceed, and go forth with courage like David, with your
sling-stones in your hands, in the name of the Lord of Hosts, against all
uncircumcised Philistims, and quit your selves like men as ye have valiantly
heretofore done, as your enemies cannot deny, for there is not only
covetousesse amongst them, but both ambition and superstition in the highest
degree, besides horrible perjurie, adultery, and all sorts of iniquity, yea
or scarce one, who is not blemished with that deceitful Covenant, which all of
them have both often and fearfully broken, and yet are so impudent and
Sathanically wicked, that still they urge and tempt others to come in the same
dangerous snares with themselves.

If ye be discreet, and seek the Kingdoms good more then your own, ye will
not (like standing water) lie still and stink, and rot, and bring forth
venomous beasts, but show your selves like clear rivers which run into the
Ocean, and both carry vessels for the traffic of the Nations, and bring
forth wholesome and profitable fishes for man's use: Call to mind both how
generous and valourous Nehemiah and his soldiers were, who built the Temple
with the one hand, and fought against the enemies with the other, and Abraham
also who would not take a shooe-latchet in his victories against his enemies,
but only food to the soldiers, and if ye will speedily perform now withal
your power, whatsoever good your hands shall find more to do, (because there
is neither wisdom, nor work, nor invention in the grave whether ye go) and
not put your hand to the plow, and (like Lots wife, or Israel in the
wilderness) look back, but forget what is behind, and strive forwards toward
the mark, doubtless the same God, who has heretofore got himself honor by
you, will also upon your constant integrity and fidelity, in the discharge of
your duty, stir up all other needful instruments to assist you, until he
crown his own work with perfection, and bring both his, your, and our
unrecoverable enemies to destruction.

A Premonition to all Commons and Souldidiers, fore-warning them, that if they
will set God before their eyes in all their practices, be as true henceforth
as they have been heretofore, to their own native Country and Privileges,
and proceed valiantly as they have begun, he will so assist them, in crowning
all their labors and toiles with victory, as glory may redound to him, and
comfort to them and us, with all the posterity.
WHat means and craft can Satan or his instruments devise, which guilty men
will not use, to save themselves from trial, when both their own conscience
do once begin to accuse them and when a powerful party brings a strong
accusation against them? Will not all they who are in one fault be so far from
confessing, that the will not only stick together (like abush of thorns or
briers) but justify and clear one another, even to their utmost power,
persuading themselves, that if a few of them shall be brought to light, the rest
cannot long escape in darkness?

Therefore, to repent their evils, and prevent their trials, yea and dazzle
the peoples eyes, they do not only (since they began to be questioned) make
great shows of humiliation like Ahab, of zeal, like Jehu, and of obedience,
like Saul, but likewise send forth their wise men, Counselors and Agents,
(even Frogs, Machivillians, and Politicians) either to divide, delude, or
disperse their accusers, like Captain Drake's ship in the midst of the Spanish
Fleet.

And though they fail of their expectation herein, yet they still encourage
themselves, (as Saul did, apprehending his own guiltiness, he desired
nevertheless to be honored among the people,) and with great boldness and
impudency, so face out the matter, that although by their secret means, some
of their accusers fellows have already lost their lives, and will do so with
all the rest, so soon as they can secretly (under other notions) provide an
Army, yet they are not ashamed now to own their accusers, and provide their
wages, as being flesh of their flesh, and bone of their bones, yea and offer
them all their desires, only justice, the eleven Members prisoners, and
account of the Kingdoms moneys, they will endeavor yet to reserve, till they
see who will go up with them to Ramath Gilead, and prosper against the Army.

But we hope the same God who has freed us from regal oppression, will also
free us from Parliamentary corruption; and whether he has appointed that this
Army should do it, or if we should look for another, he knows best, who has
all the creatures at his call, to preserve or punish whom he will; only thus
much, if this Army do not set God before their eyes, and have no better
principles, then for a poor mess of their enemies poisoned pottage, to sell
both all their own birthrights and liberties, and all the Commons of Englands
liberties, for which they have so valiantly and victoriously ventured their
lives, and will not persevere in well-doing, without favor or fear,
especially having all the true-hearted Commons to partake with them, and assist
them, and not crown their former victories, by sparing either fat or lean, who
are guilty and execrable; he who is only wise and Almighty, knows very well
both how to deal with them, and preserve all that trust in him.

Farewell.
FINIS.
