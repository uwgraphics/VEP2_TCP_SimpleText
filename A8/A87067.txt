THE HANG-MANS LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT: WITH His Lagacy to the Nine Worthies,
viz. Col. Lambert, Creed, etc.
I Have lived to see such wretchedness,
When none but honesty are crimes,
That my ropes are turned into rimes.
I and my Gallows groan.
Things are so carried I cannot tell how,
There Is as many above still as are below,
I have hanged such in shirts as white as snow.
I and my gallows groan,
Oliver he lived by a plot,
The Parliament sits still, and why not?
And I fared well by a bow-knot.
I and, etc.
All my delight was in a Jayle,
My estate was got at a Carts tail,
I know not what these people ayle.
I and etc.
Oliver he a Coach would drive,
And was honey in the Parliaments Be hive
Neither he nor I loved a reprive.
I and etc.
I wish I had had his Protectors rest,
I Would have laid it an earnest for a jest,
But Sir Harry Vane's worth all the rest,
I and etc:
I have chopped off many a worthy head,
And thanks to the Shieriffs have been well fed,
But that I can dock must never be sed.
I and etc.
Lambert I knew was troubled with the yellows,
And more perplexed with his fellows.
Had I lived I Would cured him at the gallows.
I and etc.
Never was any so bad as my trade,
The nine Worthies would have made,
As a drudge before something a Jade.
I and etc.
But I had got nothing by the thing,
There Is indemnity against the string,
But my heir may get by a forward spring,
I and etc:
I see John Lilburne at a Bar,
And Sir George Booth that man of war,
But could get neither in my Car.
I and my etc.
I think the Ordinary's long prayer,
Has spoyld frequenting of my fair.
Till all long-winded R -- are there.
I and etc.
For half thirteen pence halfpenny wages
I would have cleared all the Town cages,
And you should have been rid of all the sages.
I and etc.
There was much climbing among the Grandees,
Yet they all I see know the wood from the trees,
And all to cousin me of my fees.
I and etc.
The high Court of justice was out of use,
The thieves and the Bench had made a truce,
For want of authority, a lean excuse.
I and etc.
Twould vex any body to keep an Ax,
As long as there are any Alderman Packs,
Or Desborough eke with his wide sacks.
I and etc.
That Duckenfield, Packer, and Major Creed,
Of my helping hand should have such need,
When I am not able to do the deed,
I and etc.
Lambert would also borrow the block,
As well as my Lady did Olivers cock,
But like him I must patiently bear this mock:
I and etc.
Fleetwood also lacks some of my skill,
And that I cannot do it fokes take it ill,
I Would hang um all if I could have my will.
I and etc.
It Is vain to look for dead men's shoos,
Else I had had Hewson in a noose,
But my successor wont him loose.
I and etc.
Tyburn was once in mourning clad,
For a great man, and I also very sad,
A full bunch will make you all glad.
I and my gallows groan.
London, Printed for Charles Gustavus. Jan. 17. 1659.
