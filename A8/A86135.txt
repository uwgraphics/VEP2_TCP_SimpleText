THE Trap-Pannnians AIAS Trap-Pallians ALIAS Trap-Tonians.
A Detection of some unparall'd Plots, Attempts and Perpetrations practiced by
a knot of Knaves, in and about the City of LONDON.

For the Apprehending and Mulcting of those whom (by their conivance) the
cunning Courtezans of the Town consent to etc. to the Disgrace Impoverishment
and utter ruin of many honest and eminent men in and about London.

OLbyon's another Egypt; Thames like Nile
Gives monstrous births, Heaven weeps while Furies smile,
But now when Jove had sheathed the sw^rd of Mars,
See; the Quain Venus broaches fiercer Wars,
A crew of cursed ones (to pocket Treasure)
Obstruct the onsets of the Paphian Pleasure,
And like uncharitable envious Elves
Will have none to get Bastards but themselves;
Judge then to what a pass the world would come,
Should those be suffered (thus) to stich the womb
Of Nature up -- and by sinister Tricks
Maul every man that loves a Meretri^;
The Pions Act which th'warts this mortal sin,
One would conceit were a fubstantiall Gin;
To manackle these Flesh-Flies -- must Sir John
Mounted on's Mare, fear some Trap-Pan'ion
Will force him from the Saddle, and discleak him,
Amerce him. Awe him, flout him, threat to cheek him;
It Is not to be endured; speak my spruce Cits,
Is not the sauce sour to your luscious Bits?
You Will answer I, I Am sure, then take this Charm,
Which can protect you from all future harm.
THe Devil never showed himself in his colors till this present Age, hither
to he has been thought but (...) ^ebub^id est, a God of Flies, but now he
manifests himself a true Apollion, id est, a potent destroyer; Piety was never
more professed, nor never less practi^'d then in our time, we were never
unhappy, til we assumed the surname Happy, never licentious til we laid claim
to a through Reformation; so true is the old Adage, All covet all loose, it is
now grown past the power of the Palp^t (though from thence the fire was first
flung abroad) to do either good or harm in the matter, for he that has most
power to be held the best man, is no new thing, nor need it seem strange, if
the Discords of a Nation or City, used to be healed by Accommodations, be now
decided by the Sword since Wars may lawfully be. Entered into, not so much for
the Curse as the Pay, which is not to be wondered at, for Examples do not
stop where they began, but though they get in at a little cranny, make
themselves a wide breach to come out at, and when once the Rule is forsaken,
we run amain down the hill^, nor need any man think that dishonest in
himself, which has been profitable to anoher.

Amongst the many Absurdities and unparall'd Monstrafities (begot between
Amsterdam and Geneva, Munster and Mecha, Edinburgh and LONDON, and the Devil
and a Presbiter) which these late times have been burdened with, there is not
one of those Chimeras to be compared with a new Gorgonicall Gerion, a novell
Sect (certainly the seed of those Saduces (of old) that believed no
Resurrection neither Angels or Devils) started up) like Cadmus-Twinnes) on the
sudden amongst us (armed at all points) to east^g^te those crimes which
themselves more dote upon then an old City Cuskold on his young Cockatrice, I
mean the fine Fraternity called Trap-Panuiant, Trap-Pallians and Trap Tonians,
names (all of them) very pertinent to the Natures and Qualifications of the
Sport-Spoylers, these Mercinary-Murtherers of natural delights, and sworn
enemies to the Recreation of the Chine, who (most abhorred Catiff^s) would not
fear for a petty sum to pull Venus smock over her ears, and to detect Jupiter
and Io, Bacchus and his Erigone, Phoebus and his Daphne, or Pluto (with another
man's wife) his Euricide in the act of procreation; and deliver them over to the
secular Magistrate, in ordine ad spiritualia.

Curse y^em thou king of hearts (fair Venus son)
Or thy best Orgies are for ever gone,
These sons of sloth and Night, tha^ interpose
(Heaping up anguish, and incessant woes)
On thy devoutest Votaries, who are
The tallest Soldiers in thy peaceful War;
The London Cit who knows no happiness
Sav's Fathers Portion, and his Mistress Dress,
Who kisses as when well set bones do crack,
And knows no Phrase save this; What do you lack?
Whose Gospell-Preist is some well-gifted Weaver,
and pins his sonle on Burton, Dod and Cleaver,
He, he, I say cannot (by stealth) carowse
With, spainted female in some Brothel-house,
Nor daily with her, on the much-us'd bed,
But he is assaulted, scarr'd, and captive led,
As a rude Non conformist against the Act,
Unless his bleeding Baggs excuse the Fact;
The dauntlesse Myrmidon, the man of Iron,
Whom Walls of brass, and Ribs of steel inviron,
The Bristles of whose Chin resemble well
A grove of Pikes (by whom five Popes have fell)
Cannot create a time of safety, when
He may exonerate like other men,
But he is surprised, and is forced to pay
The Muster-money, which but yesterday
Furnished his fist; the Black-coat that does writht
His meagre face d^barr'd of Tenths and Tithe.
Who now on his Thumbs ends may sing and whistle
(Thanks to the Talmud, and the Scottish Thistle)
He, he, I say whose Holy Water (spent
In banefull wastes) has borne down David, Tent.
Dr^wning the glories of a potent Nation,
Now fears to frisk it in the quondam fashion,
Dreading a sw^rd or dagger at his throat
(Since there is no privilege attends his Coat)
To be led Captive by some pimping Beadle.
Before some Commander, who will soon un riddle
His Metaphisick sense, and twist a Rope
(Maulgre a dispensation from the Pope)
Shall gag him to Eternity, no Aid
From Scotus, or Aquinas, or the Maid
Fair Hyldegard; no Schoolman can resist,
But he must suffer as a Casuist.
The fame-eraz'd Peer, who took such pain and toil
'T Eclipse his Sovereigns glory, and beguile
Himself into a happiness, unknown,
which his brave Ancestors nere wished to own,
And now is laid aside like some gay thing,
Not fit for gaze, when there is no Court nor King,
Who shortly shall be fashioned on the Forge,
Maulgre his Azure Ribbon and his George;
He too (alas) if he be taken upon her,
Finds no protection from his forfeit honor,
A Petty Justice of the Peace and Little,
Shall send his honor unto harum horum.
The Knight who will needs be merry once a quarter,
Yea though he mortgage both his Sword and Garter,
And tile not for, but with some City Lady,
(Since dyldoes never will make her spouse a daddy)
He, he, who bath destroyed so many scarfes,
Killed such strange Monsters, passed so many wharfes,
(Although so sore enchansed, when he is tan^,
Struggles in Fetters like Levi^^han,
And either must compound with those that sweak him,
Or read the Act there, let a halter choke him.
The cunning Lawyer, who Justinian traces,
Cracking whole Kingdoms with his Pleas and Cases,
Whose Conscience might create another Hell,
(Where Ployden, Cook, and Littleton might dwell,
Were they not in a Mansion of their own)
Whose function sickness, and is almost grown
fit for Pie Corner, to sing Piggs, or save
Roast meat from burning; he I say (poor Knave)
Dares not upon his dearest Maulkin ceaze,
Though he be furnished with a Writ of ease)
But he is ejected by our brave Trap. Pannians,
Cugel'd and used like any scab'd Rascallian,
Unless the thing he so much doats upon,
For which all hopes of his salvation
He Would part with) glorious gold he can produce,
"Gold that supports the Church, and makes the Stews,
"Whiter than Nuneries, or place where
"Religious Auchorites secluded are;
Nor may the witty Poor find protection
From this Pestiferous, this dire Infection,
No though Apollo, and the three times three,
Engage themselv's as his security,
Upon the sacred Bard their impious hands
They Will lay, and scourge him with iron wands.
But scabberded; nor will the Rogves retire,
Though he strike Orpheus or Imphions Lyre,
If with his (treacherous) Goddess they surprise him,
Not all his allegories can disguise him,
His Tropes and Figures, will (alas) not aid him,
Unless to her and these (that have betrayed him)
He prostrate what h^ very seldom wins,
(Money't expiate his venerious sins.)
Is it not a vast power these (seeming) sin-haters lay claim to, and (insooth)
did they aim at their makers glory, to suppress and erradicate those crying
fin of Adultery and fornication, we should have cause to prize them no less
then Patriarchs, and to afford them as much veneration as the sick brained
Vulgarre dedicated to Trinmvirate of sedition, that threefold cord of Schism,
Prin, Burton and Bastwick, when they found Manumission in spite of the Bishops
Mandates, but we know that these fellows smell no more of virtue than a
Poll-Cat of Musk, as if Mintz (were he alive) should impeach Martin of
sensuality, or Rablais accuse Aretine, and the Ovid of obscenity, fellows whose
fortunes are as broken, as their fronts are brazen, their manner of entrapping
take thus, from him who experimentally avows it.

Three or (perhaps) six of these Trap Pannians, are given to know by their
Mistress (in common) that such a Knight, such a Gentleman, such a Citizen
affects her, and is solicitous to enjoy her, he (says she) has been very
beneficial; As courteous a Cullee as ever Curtezan dandled, our least of
Tavern Reckonings is forty shillings or three pounds, Mention but a pair of
Gloves, and a Gown and Kirtle attends me, or the loss of a Hand kercheife,
and twenty else of Holland wait me.

This Loach has store of coin; you know my meaning -- I will (seemingly, for I
hate the fellows Person more than hell) give my consent such a day and hour in
such a place to meet the Beast with two backs, at which time you three shall be
absconded, either under the bed in the closet or some other private place, and
when the Hot-spur begins the onfet, I will let fall either my Busk or the
Bed-staffe which may serve for your warning piece, then rush upon us (one of
you as my husband) and surprise us, I shall not be angry to be called (what I
profess my self) Whore, nor blame the hand that bangs me, since the
compensation will prove ample enough, bang him Coxcombly Cit say they, it will
be but Justice to draine her purse, or hang his person, all things concluded
on, my Inamorate has his Mistress grant to meet, but first he solemnly sw^urs
not to divulge her, for should her husband (a man of an anstere and fiery
temper) but have the least ^ckling of their stolen imbracements, they must
both expect certain death either by his hands or the hangmans, feace not my
sweet (answers he) we will so carry it that no detriment shall happen either to
thee or me, and for this free favor thou shall ever command me body and sou;l
the wished day (on all hands) now arrives, the lover folds his M^st^esse in his
arms, sporting so long at the brink that now he is resolved to leap in, when
(oh fatal) there appears his Ladies husband and two others with swords and
pistolls, who with death menacing brows threaten to dispatch them, she (good
soul) on her knees with tears begs^ her husbands mercy but he (loading her
with blows) seems as if nothing may appease him but blood, while her poor
amazed Lover (esteeming this as a just judgment of God inflicted on him as an
allay to his lust) like a p^rfect P^neteutlary implores his Ladies jealous Lord
to spare him (...) neither spill his blood nor expose him to to shame, and in
lieu of such love he will gratify him with a good sum of (...), but the angry
husband remains refractory, vowing to off (...) both his wife and the ^dulterer
on the altar of revenge the Law (quoth he) shall take place, and therefore (my
trusty friend, whom I shall ever honor for this aid) let us convey this
strumpe^ and her Letcher to the next justice, upon this the surprised couple a
fresh besetch, which m^llifying the hearts of her husbands friends they
earnestly request that he will not bring his wife to public shame, for (say
they) consider, it will redound to your disputagement, and for the Gentleman we
are confident of his sorrow fullness for his fault, and therefore let us
prevail with you, accept of a sufficient sum, and let him return to his house,
this (fot their sakes) is at length granted, the Cit (with many thanks for the
favor) proposes his watch, with all the money in his pockets, gives bond for so
much more, and (praising God) departed to his home. Eheu quam tenui pendeut
mortalia fil^.

Thus and thus have hundreds (Gentlemen and Mechanics) about London been
lately served, and (which is strange) so prevalent is the itching disease now
grown that all the waming in the world (no though they have been informed by
those who have have bought the expetience at a dear rate) can deter some from
ventring upon this Praecipice, but let us leave such fools to their just
deserved destiny, and conclude with a Satyr directed to those fallacious
females, who draw men into such dangerous Praemunites.

Pox take ye all, your qualities are much
After your faces, and your faith is such
As are your works. f^r what is there in you
That is not counterfeit and painted too
Do your lips open, before ye speak ye lie
And if ye sigh, ye lie most damnably
False lights your eyes are, and false weights your ears,
Your hearts false measures, and false pearl your tears
So talk or think or look or laugh, or cry,
Seem or seem not, walk, stand, or sit ye lie,
Nay; there is more yet your couzening of those
Most, who in you do most trust repose
Your loving most those who do least love you
And choosing to dye, rather then be true,
Blush, blush, fond men and fair example take
(By those have been Trap-Pannian'd) how you make
An idol of a face, and take it for granted
There Is no such Devil as a Whore that is sainted
She thinks her wit and beauty without Peer
And ore thy slavish soul does dommineere
Like some great Goddess counting thou were b^^^
(As a thing mortal) only for the scorn
Curse on such Vassalage, henceforth express
Even in your loves, Valor and Manliness.
S.H.

FINIS.
