LONDON. Printed for GEORGE HORTON, 1648.

A MESSAGE From the Citizens of LONDON TO The Lord General Fairfax, concerning
the Kings Majesty, the Prince of Wales, and the Duke of YORK.
May it please your Excellency,
Upon mature and serious consultation of your late Remonstrance and
Declaration, for the settling of this bleeding Kingdom in a more safe and mutual
posture, the executing of Justice upon his Majesty, and all other person or
persons, who have acted contrary to the known Laws of the Realm, the
summoning in the Prince of Wales, and the Duke of York, and the setting of a
period for the ending and dissolving of this present Parliament, etc In
reference whereunto, we do desire, That there may be a mitigation, and
favorable construction of the precedent actions and proceedings of his
Majesty, and their Highnesses the Prince of Wales, and the Duke of York, in
relation to the late War, and that there may be a more equal dispensing of
Justice and Mercy, in relation to things done or suffered in the said wars; and
for all other particulars therein specified we do unanimously declare, that we
shall most willingly and freely concur with your Excellency, and the Council
of the Army therein; protesting, to sacrifice lives and fortunes, and all that
is near and dear unto us, in pursuance of the same.

Signed by many thousand well affected Citizens within the Cities of London and
Westminster, and paats adjacent, who subscribes themselves, Your Excellencies
most humble, and obedient serants, etc.

A new Remonstrance from the Army, to the City and Kingdom.
BEing full of sad apprehensions concerning the danger and evil of the Treaty
with the King, and of any accommodation with him, or restitution of him
thereupon, We did by our late Remonstrance upon the Reasons and Grounds therein
expressed, make our application thereby unto the present House of Commons, that
the dangerous evil of that way might be avoided, and the peace of the Kingdom
settled upon more righteous, safe and hopeful grounds, viz. a more equal
d^spensing of Justice and Mercy in relation to things done or suffered in the
late wars, and the establishing of the future Government of this Kingdom upon a
safe succession and equal Constitution of Parliaments, and that (for the
ending of present, and avoiding of future Differences) to be Ratified by an
Agreement and Subscription of the people thereunto. Which things we pressed in
the way of Reason and Persuasion only, that they might be duly and timely
considered. But to our grief we find, in stead of any Satisfacton or a
reasonable answer thereto, they are wholly rejected, without any consideration
of what ever Reason or Justice might be in the things set forth or propounded
therein; for what less can be understood, when the things propounded were
mainly for the avoidance of evils appearing in the Treaty with the King: And
feeing the prevailing part of those, to whom we did apply, to have as it were
their eyes wilfully shut, and ears stopped, against any thing of Light or Reason
offered to them, we find no place left for our former charitable or hopeful
apprehensions, concerning their error in such evil ways; but remaining fully
assured of the danger and destructivenesse thereof, as to all those public
ends for which they were entrusted, and also of the just advantage and
necessity which lie in the things we have propounded and insist on, we now see
nothing left, to which their engaging and persisting in such ways, and
rejection of these better things propounded, can rationally be attributed less
then a treacherous or corrupt neglect of, and Apostasy from the Public Trust
reposed in them; although we could wish from our souls, we might yet find the
contrary.

Therefore it is our hearts desire, and shall be our endeavor, that so much,
both of the matter and form of the present Parliamentory Authority may be
preserved, as can be safe, or will be useful to these ends, until a just and
full Constitution thereof, both for matter and form (suitable to the public
ends, it serves for) can be entroduced.

And therefore first, it should be great rejoicing (if God saw it good) that
the majority of the present House of Commons were become sensible of the evil
and distructivenesse of their late way, and would resolvedly and vigorously
apply themselves to the speedy execution of justice, with the righting and
easing of the oppressed people, and to a just settlement of the Kingdom upon
such foundations as have been propounded by us, and others for that purpose,
and would for the speedier and surer prosecution of these things exclude from
Communication in their Councels, all such corrupt and Apostarized Members as
have appeared hitherto, but to obstruct and hinder such matter of Justice,
Safety, and public interest, and to pervert their Councels a contrary way and
have therein so shamefully both falsified, and forftied their Trust,

But however of God shall not see it good (to vouchsafe that mercy to tem and
the Kingdom) we shall secondly desire, That so many of them as God has kept
upright, and shall touch with a just sense of those things, would by
protestation or otherwise, acquit themselves from such breach of Trust, and
approve their faithfulness, by withdrawing from those that persist in the
guilt thereof, and take such a posture, whereby they may speedily and effectually
prosecute those necessary and public ends, without such inteeruptions,
Diversions, or depravations of their Council from the rest, to their endless
trouble, and hazard of the Kingdom as formerly, and for so many of them, whose
hearts God shall stir up thus to do.

We shall therein, in this case of extremity, look upon them as persons having
materially the chief Trust of the Kingdom remaining in them, and though not a
formal standing power to be continued in them, or drawn into ordinary
Presidents; yet the best and most rightful that can be had, as the present
state and exigence of affairs now stand; And we shall accordingly own them,
adhere to them, and be guided by them in their faithful prosecution of that
trust, in order unto, and until the introducing of a more full and formal power
in a just Representative to be speedy endeavored.

Now yet further to take away all jealousies in relation to our selves, which
might withold or discourse any honest members from this courage, as we have
the witness of God in our hearts, that in these proceedings we do not seek,
but even resolve we will not take advantages to our selves, either in point of
profit or power; and that if God did open to us a way, wherein with honesty and
faithfulness to the public Interest, and good people engaged for us, we
might presently be dischargeed, so as we might nor in our present Employments
look on, and be acessary to, yea supporters of the Parliament, in the present
corrupt, oppressive and destructive proceedings, we should with rejoicing, and
without more ado embrace such a discharge, rather then interpose in these
things to our own vast trouble and hazard; so if we could but obtain a
rational assurance for the effectual prosecuting of these things, we shall
give any proportionable assurance on our parts, concerning our laying down of
arms, when, and as we should be required.

But for the present as the case stands, we apprehend our selves obliged in
duty to God, this Kingdom, and good men therein, to approve our utmost
abilities in all honest ways, for the avoiding of these great evils which we
have remonstrated, and for prosecution of the good things we have propounded;
and also that such persons who were the inviters of the late invasion from
Scotland, the Instigaters and incouragers of the late insurrections within this
Kingdom, and (those forcible ways failing) have still pursued those wicked
designs by treacherous and corrupt councels, may be brought to public
justice, according to their several demerits. For all these ends we are now
drawing up with the Army to London, there to follow providence as God shall
clear our way.

Signed, John Rushworth Secr.
On Saturday December. 2. Upon further debate of the Desires of the Army, The
Lord Major, Aldermen, and Common Counsel, declared, That all means possible
should be used, for keeping a right understanding and mutual correspondence
between the City and Army, and that no means should be left unassayed (on their
parts) for the establishing of a firm and lasting peace, throughout all His
Majesty's Realms and Dominions.



FINIS.
