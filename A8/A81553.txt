THE DISSOLUTION OF THE LAST PARLIAMENT
November. 19. 1641.
In the Parliament holden at Edinburgh, the eleventh day of Iun. 1640 years
the Estates of Parliament Presently conveened, by his Majesty's special
authority, Considering that whereas, after many petitions and supplycations
given in and presently to his Majesty, and the Lords of his secret council,
by diverse of the Nobility, Barrons, and Burgesses of this Kingdom, for
granting a free General Assembly, and Parliament, for reforming of many great
abuses, and novations, tending to the overthrow of the true reformed Religion,
and undoing of this Kirk. and Kingdom devised and brought in by the late
pretended Bishops, who by their subtle practices, during his Majesty's
absence, their many years, had iugrost in their persons all the Ecclesiastic,
and civil power of this his Majesty's ancient and native Kingdom, it was
granted by his Majesty, out of his Royal Justice, and accorded by the
Articles of pacification, madeat his Majesty's Camp in the month of Jun. 1639
years, last past, that a free general assembly, and Parliament, should be
indicted by his Majesty, and that all matters Ecclesiastical should be
determined by the assemblies of the Kirk: and matters civil, by Parliaments,
and other inferior Iudicatories, established by Law, and that according
thereunto, his Majesty did indict an Assembly to be held at Edinburgh, the
twelfth of August, and a Parliament for ratifying the Conclusions of the same
Assembly, and setting down such other thing, as might conduce to the peace and
good of the Kingdom, To be holden at Edinburgh the twenty fixed of August last
bypast: in the which assembly, the matters concerning the purity of the true
reformed Religion, and peace of this Kirk, after great debaite, delays, and
protracting of time, made by John, Earl of Traquair his Majesty's
Commissioner, being at length concluded upon the (...) day of August, 1639
years, The Parliament sitting down immediately thereafter, upon the penult
day of the said month of August the ratifications of the Conclusions of the
same assembly and many other matters of great importance, conducing necessarly
to the settling of the peace, of this Kingdom, being proponed in Parliament,
were like ways shifted and delayed, and the closing of the Parliament,
protracted from time to time, unto the (...) day of November, last by past: at
the which time, the said John Earl of Traquaire did take upon him without the
consent of the Estates, to prorogat the foresaid Parliament to the second day
of June instant, not only contrary to the Articles of pacification, but also
to the prejudice of the Liberties of the Parliament, for preservation whereof,
the said Estates were forced to make a declaration in Parliament against the
same: And that albeit since the said (...) day of November, unto this time, the
said Estates have used all possible means to give his Majesty full
satisfaction both by their peaceable carriage at home, and by sending their
Commissioners, to acquaint his Majesty with all their just desires, and the
reasons thereof, yet they have not only received no answer, but upon the
contrary have bin condemned as Rebellious, without hearing: and our
Commissioners, sent for clearing thereof, all restrained in private houses for
a long time, and John Lord Lowdoun, being one of them, committed to the Tower,
where he is still detained prisoner.

The Castles of Edemburgh, and Dunbertane have in mean time been fortified
and provided with all sort of Ammunition, in great abundance, and Garrisons of
Soldiers, (not being natives of this Kingdom) put therein; the Garrison in the
Castle of Edinburgh, daily killing diverse of the inhabitants of this City, and
spoiling their houses with Muskets and great Ordinance, all ships belonging to
this Kingdom arrested in England, and Ireland, and many of them coming from
other places, laid wait for, and taken by the way, their owners and passengers
spoiled of their goods, and apparel, laid in the yrons, and barbarously
abused: A Commission granted to the General of the English forces by sea and
land, to kill, destroy, and subdue this whole nation, a Printed Declaration put
forth, denouncing war against it, persuading, exhorting, and provoking the
other two Kingdoms to grant subsidies, and take Arms against the inhabitants
of this Kingdom as traitors and rebels: And the Parliament of Ireland has
proceeded so far as to declare them to be such: All which they have hitherto
endured patiently, and thereby given an evident demonstration to the world of
the loyalty of their affections to their Sovereign, which no extremity shall
ever make them to forget: And now being pressed by the present exigence of the
Estate of this Kingdom, and bound by the necessity of that natural duty they
ought to themselves and their posterity, to provide for the safety of the
Commonwealth, and their own, and timously to prevent the utter ruin of this
Nation, which can no longet subsist under so great a burden, that time
appointed being come, to the which the Parliament was prorogat, and no
advertisement come from his Majesty to them anent any course to be taken, for
redeeming of the great disorders, they being the great Council of the Kingdom
could not be altogether so forgetful of themselves, and decident to their
Country, as to suffer this Parliament which they had so often petitioned from
his Majesty, which was conditioned and accorded by the said Articles of
Pacification, and inflicted by his Majesty's Authority, to be deserted and
expyred without any conclusion to the good of the Commonwealth in so great
extremity: But rather thought themselves bound in conscience and duty to
proceed to the determination of such matters as are necessary for the
establishing of the peace of this Kirk and Kingdom, as being the express and
special ends of all their Supplications, and agreeable to the said Articles
of Pacification, without tri^ching any ways on Soveraigntie, or derogating in
any sort from his Majesty's Royal Authority, but on the contrary, only
looking first upon the constitutions of the general Assembly, p^st in presence
of his Majesty's Commissioner, and the necessar consequences thereof, and then
providing remedies for the present evils of the Kingdom, by removing the
cause, and establishing necessar conclusions for preventing the like hereafter:
In doing whereof as they have proceeded uprightly in the way of Justice, and
with due reverence, and regard to his Majesty's Authority, and thereby have
hopped the calumnious mouths of their adversaries, so they rest assured, that
his Majesty after due examination of their proceedings, finding the same
agreeable to the fundamental laws and custom^s of this his ancient and native
Kingdom, and no ways repugnant to Monarchiall government, will out of his
Royal Justice and goodness give his full consent thereunto; And thereby
totally removing and extinguishing all ground and occasion of contraversie
against his faithful and loyal Subjects, restore this Kingdom to a perfect
and solid peace, which they pray the Lord put in his Majesty's Royal Heart,
that he may long and prosperously reign over them And on the other part,
considering from by gone experience how malicious and diligent their
adversaries will be to calumniat these their proceedings, and by their
suggestions to the Kings Majesty, and to the Lieges, to kindle and intertaine
factions and divisions there anent, and how necessar it is for the safety and
peace of this Kirk and Kingdom, that the Members of both do unanimously with
heart and hand testify by their subscription their resolution, and Obligation
to acknowledge this Parliament so often desired by their petitions and
supplications, and conveened by his Majesty's solemn indiction, according to
the Articles of Pacification, to be a free, lawfu^l, and necessary Parliament,
and to obey, observe, and maintain the same for themselves constantly and
faithfully, and to the uttermost of their power, to join and concur, in
their several stations and callings, with others to advance, further, and
assist the execution, obedience, and observing of the Acts and constitu^ions of
this present Parliament, as the most fit and necessary remedies of the by^one
and present evils and distractions of this Kirk and Kingdom, and for
preservation of the Religion, laws and liberties thereof, and of his Majesty's
Authority, and that in the first Parliament which shall be holden hereafter
within this Kingdom, and at all other occasions, against any opposition
whatsoever, except in so far as shall hereafter be thought fit and expedient
by the common advise and consent of the Estates: They have ordained and
ordaines the Band underwritten, to be subscribed by all the Members of
Parliament present and absent, and by Noblemen, Barons, Burgesses, and all
other Subjects and inhabitants of the Kingdom, in their Shyres, and Burghs, as
they shall be directed by the Commissioners of Parliament left at Edinburgh,
and to be reported to the Clerk, betwixt and the first day of September nixt,
with certification, that such as refuse or post-pone, and delay to subscribe to
same, shall be holden as Enemies and Opposits to the common Cause, consisting
in the maintenance of the true reformed Religion, and of the laws, and
liberties of this Kingdom, and his Majesty's Authority.

We Noblemen, Barons, Burgesses, and others, undersubscribers, considering
how necessary it is to establish our Union in the preservation, and maintenance
of the Religion, Laws, and Liberties of this Kingdom, and of his Majesty's
Authority, and to prevent all factions, contentions, and divisions, which may
arise in prejudice thereof, from malicious suggestions and mis-informations of
our adversaries, do all, and every one of us with our heart and hand testify
and declare our Resolution and Obligation, (for the reasons and causes at
length expressed in the Act of Parliament immediately preceding) to acknowledge
the aforesaid Parliament to have been and to be a free and lawful Parliament,
Likewise we bind and oblish us, and every one of us upon our honors and
credit, and as we desire to be, and to be holden true lovers of our Country,
and of the Religion, laws, and liberties thereof effauldly and faithfully to
the uttermost of our power, to join and concur with our persons and estates
every one of us according to our several stations and callings, in the
maintenance of the freedom and lawfulness of the aforesaid Parliament, and in
the advancement, further^nce, and assistan^^ of the execution, obedience, and
observation of the Acts and constitutions thereof, as the most fit and
necessary remedies of the by gone and present evils and distractions of this
Kirk and Kingdom, and for the preservation of Religion, laws, and liberties
thereof, and of his Majesty's Authority, and that in the first Parliament,
which shall be holden hereafter within this Kingdom, and at all other
occasions, and against any opposition whatsoever, except in so far as shall be
hereafter thought fit and expedient, by the common advise and consent of the
Estates: In witness whereof we have signed and subscribed these presents with
our hands, At, etc.
