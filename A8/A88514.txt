AN EPITAPH On the late deceased, that truely-Noble and Renowned Lady ELIZABETH
CROMWELL, (Mother to His Highness the Lo. Protector of Great Britain and
Ireland, etc.) who lived to the age of 89. and died Nov. 16. 1654. and lies
buried in Westminster-Abbey.
REnowned mother of our Lord
Great OLIVER Protector,
Thou noble Root that did afford
Great Britain's Weal's Affector!
Like Helen, sometime honored
For Great Constantine's Mother;
So Thou for Us have born and bred
One truly such another
In Wisdom, Valor, and Goodness,
That has us freed from Chains
Of Tyrants great, that did distress
Good men with cruel Pains.
And as Great Constantine did free
Christ's Church from Persecution;
So has thy Son gained Liberty
For real Truth's promotion.
May he go on to conquer still
All potent Enemies
That wish our Western Zion ill,
And would our Rights surprise.
And may he give the fatal blow
To Persecution's pride,
In any Forms, both high or low,
Wherever he does hide.
May he go on, Terror to be
To Rome's usurping power;
May he give Christians Liberty
(Out from that Babel-Tower)
And ease poor Protestants from Bands,
And the cruel Inquisition,
And free us from proud Clergies hands,
Is that which we petition.
Madam, you lived to great age,
And saw most great Mutation
Acted upon the common Stage
Of this our terrene Station.
Your Life it was most full of Love
To creatures in distress:
That is the God-like life above,
And is true Happiness.
May You and Yours it still possess.
Nov. 17. 1654. J. L*
