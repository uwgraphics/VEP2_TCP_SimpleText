Select Hymns.
BOOK. I.
HYMN I.
CHrist is our Holiness and Peace,
Christ is our righteousness;
Christ is our Husband, Brother, Friend,
Our Life, our Head, our Dress.
Christ our Redemption, and our hope,
Salvation, Glory, Rest:
In him we are Righteous, Clean and Strong,
In him we are fully bles't.
Christ is our Wisdom, Riches, Strength;
so is, and was, and shall
For ever be unto his own;
thus Christ is all in all!
In him we have righteousness and strength;
in him we have Peace and Grace;
In him true Honor, Pleasure, Wealth
discov'red in his Face.
Though we be Poor, in him we are Rich,
though Weak, in him we are Strong;
When withering, in this green Firtree
we flourish all along.
Let Us still admire and him adore
who always is the same,
Let Us magnify his glorious Grace,
and praise his mighty name.
HYMN II.
THe Soul that sees in Jesus Christ
a lovely pretiousness,
And does behold a glory in
his spotless righteousness;
Sees his own doings will not do,
counts them, but loss and sin;
This Soul has ventured upon Christ
and does believe on him.
The Souls that with delight do view
the Righteousness of Christ,
Are taken with so suitable,
and with so great a Priest;
Are glad that such a Savior is
Poor Sinners for to save,
Though not for them yet the True Faith
that works by love they have.
Question not doubting trembling Soul
thy Faith, but still believe,
Behold a Christ, lean on a Christ,
an off'red Christ receive;
And pou'r forth praises to thy Christ
that thee this faith has given:
Go on believing, pressing still
'till thou art got to Heaven.
HYMN III.
O! Was it ever known before,
the Kings own Son should crowned be
On purpose for to interceed
for a rebellious Enemy!
Thus our dear Jesus seized his Throne,
put on his grandeur and his state,
Sat on the right Hand of Majesty
that he might be our Advocate.
The World can never instance this
that Kings should Beggars cause so own
As that to think to serve them, is
beyond the pleasures of a Crown.
Our dearest Advocate thinks this
the chiefest sum of his renown,
To serve his Children now above
the brighest Jewel of his Crown.
To him are Honor, Glory, Praise,
Obedience, Love, and Service due;
The all-prevailing Advocate,
the faithful witness and the true.
HYMN IV.
Why are ye cast down Princel ones,
ye Royal Seed of God?
What e're's your frame, your Christ's the same,
there is Honey on his Rod.
He bids you ever to rejoice,
again, he says, rejoice;
What'ere says Law, Sin, Satan, this
is your beloveds voice.
Why should you be discouraged? you,
O heirs of free rich Grace?
For goodly is your heritage,
and pleasant is your place.
Whatever discouragements object,
our Christ can answer all;
His arm is ready to lift up,
when we are about to fall.
Do we draw back from God, because
we are filthy and unclean?
He clothes us with his Shining Robes,
let us on with boldness then.
Are we afraid his Heart is changed?
no; let us have no dread;
His heart runs over with grace and love
as much as e'e it did.
Let Us send up praises unto him;
let us his name extol:
His mercy was from ever sure,
and so it ever shall.
HYMN. V.
WHat free, rich grace, unmixed and pure,
The Gospel does proclaim!
Moses with all his various rites
could never speak so plain.
Come Saints, come also Sinners, taste
this Water, Milk, and Wine;
Wine without dregs, that of the Lees
our Lord did well refine.
Here Is Pardon without wrath at all;
white Garments without stain;
A Conscience Peace made sure and strong,
an ease that is free from pain:
A perfect conscience Liberty,
that has no Yoke at all
For whom the Son makes free, are free,
and ought to know no thrall.
Our Jesus suffered once for all,
and he obtained thereby,
Pardons eternal, infinite,
and perfect Liberty.
And then he entered once for all,
(not without Blood) above:
His sprinkled Blood on the Mercy-Seat
that ever pleads for love;
For boundless love, for goodness, Peace,
for never ceasing grace:
God's reconciled within our Souls,
it cries, and cries apace.
HYMN VI.
INto what pitch of glory we,
in Jesus mounted are!
Far above that (had Adam stood)
which should have been our share.
Faith does disclose such mysteries,
as Adam never did see:
Angels now stoop themselves, to pry
into this Mystery.
In Christ what boundless grace, and love?
what Glory, Peace, and Hope?
The Fountains of the Deep break up,
and Heavens Windows open.
What great Salvation, then is this
the Gospel brings to light!
I^s so astonishing to Faith,
what will it be to sight!
Come Saints admire, adore, set forth
in Songs and Hymns this grace:
Down, down with every Idol Self
that steps up in it is place.
Sinners, this Grace is tendered to
the vilest of you all:
Come Sinners, come accept this grace,
the Gospel gives a call.
Stand not for to dispute, and dye;
free ^ffered grace receive;
Such love embrace, accept such grace:
O do this grace believe!
HYMN VII.
COme let us return unto the Lord,
who loved and washed us with his blood:
Lets turn to him; because he has
declared to us that he is good.
O what a hateful thing is Sin
against a God of boundless grace!
That thus affronts the God of love,
and Spits in the Redeemers Face.
What Heart of stone would not be broke
to see our Jesus pierced by us,
And that these Murderers, our Sins
should wound and tear our Savior thus!
What Face confusion will not spread?
What Soul would not it self abase,
To see that Jesus loved him
in such a wretched, Sinful case!
He loved us first, O let us love!
let love constrain us to obey;
Such a good Master who'd not serve,
yea love, and honor him always?
Come Sinners taste the Grace of God,
that is offered freely unto you:
Come and accept of Christ, and then
all your repentance will be true.
Take Christ for Savior, Life, and Strength
your service then will not be in vain,
Come rest you in the love of Christ,
you will mourn then in a Gospel strain.
Glory, and Honor, lasting praise
be to our dearest Jesus given:
Let Us here then praise his name always,
'Till swallowed in that work in Heaven.
HYMN VIII.
O What a glorious light is this
the Gospel day does bring to us!
What wondrous Grace of God in Christ
does Faith reveal to Sinners thus?
Both Life and Immortality
are by the Gospel brought to light:
The fair bright day of truth appears
beyond what Moses spoke by rites.
How does the God of love and grace
appear our Father and our Lord?
How does the Gospel this declare
in Jesus name, and in his word?
The Lord the Spirit does reveal
this truth to our dark consciences
By pou'ring in Christ's pard'ning blood
within, he manifests this.
The Gospel that ran free at first,
has since been Sealed with many Seals
But Judahs Lion has prevailed
to open them, and he reveals,
They shall be opened all at last:
the Lamb will now a Lion be;
O glorious Lamb and Lion too!
all praise and honor be to thee.
HYMN IX.
OUr Lips let us move for Songs of love,
to praise Electing love;
Send down to our assistance Lord
thy Spirit from above.
Eternal Grace in Jesus Face,
that shines to's Bride and Wife,
That still to bless, through righteousness
Reigns to Eternal life.
In praises high let us magnify,
adoring bow thereto!
O Grace! Free grace! O glorious grace,
that rescued us from woe.
When God resolved that Grace should save,
a Law of Life came in,
That at the breaches of this Law
grace deluge might over Sin:
And why must Sin then enter in?
that grace might overflow:
Since Mounts of Sin cannot bound it in,
Grace boundless is we know.
Law, Death, Sin, Hell, brought to the Field,
the strength of Grace to try;
Grace gives a fall unto them all,
and wins the victory.
All to attest and manifest
the omnipotence of Grace,
And that it is unchangeable,
nothing can it efface.
Though we might see it is Sov'reignty,
Sin's suffered first alone
T'extend it is Empire far and wide
and fortify its Throne.
That as Sin reigned unto Death,
so Grace might weild the Sword;
And reign to Life through righteousness,
in Jesus Christ our Lord.
HYMN X.
WHen Captive Slaves to Sin and Death,
a Dying Jesus set us free;
Raised from a Dungeon to a Throne:
O glorious Goal delivery!
That worst of Rebels may not be
for ever ruined and undone,
The injured King to Justice does
deliver up his only Son.
That the offender at the Bar
might stand acquit, the Judge does dye;
Condemns himself to Bands and Chains,
to set the wretch at liberty.
Astonished be the Heavens above!
confounded be the Earth below!
Here Is love and grace for to amaze,
not to over do, but overflow.
Poor Sinners come believe this grace,
come venture on it, and you shall be,
By reigning Grace from reigning Sin
freed in our Lord as well as we.
Accept you of our Jesus Christ,
and with him you will have all his grace:
To day he calls, to day come all
there is left for you both room and place.
Who would of Fetters then be fond,
if they this moment might be free?
O! therefore harden not your Hearts,
who now are called to liberty.
But now, e'n now obey the call,
that you and we might Christ adore;
Sound far and wide his praises high
to whom they are due forever more.
HYMN XI.
OUr Father from Eternity
looked on us in our Sin;
Then viewed a bleeding righteous Christ,
and we complete in him.
He then with God the Son agreed,
the obedience of the Son
Imputed be to the Elect;
then 'twas agreed and done.
O wondrous grace and love indeed!
that from Eternity
Should be employed to make us pure
and absolutely free!
With this imputed righteousness
forever clothed upon,
Than Angels far accepted more
to God upon the Throne.
Which never changes with our frames,
no, nor our Holiness:
Not sin, nor guilt, not Death nor World,
can touch or move this dress.
Let Us his immortal honor sing,
who wrought this out for us;
In praises, yea in living praise,
Extol his garments thus.
HYMN XII.
SOuls must believe and come to Christ,
or dye for breach of Laws:
And yet there is no Soul can come
but whom the Father draws.
Uniting Faith's a powerful light
revealing Christ within,
And in discov'ring pardon, does
destroy the reign of Sin.
In showing to the Soul, that Sin,
and self are cov'red over;
It turns the Soul from self and sin
Our Jesus to adore.
It is a great creating light,
gives light where there was none;
In a dark Heart it is beams displays,
softens a Heart of Stone.
It Is the same power wrought in Christ
when raised up from the Dead,
And over Principalities,
and Powers set him Head.
Let Us look to him, and praise him too;
Jesus above that has
This power to give, the Author is
and finisher of Faith.
HYMN XIII.
A Bleeding Jesus testified
this with his latest breath,
That he had conquest finished
over Sin, over Hell, or're Death.
It Is finished I O this joyful sound
Rings through the Heavens above!
God and good Angels do rejoice
O hear is wondrous love!
It Is finished; cries our bleeding Lord,
I have received the blow
For mine; let Justice sheath his Sword,
and Father, let them go.
Father, its finished; I have made
full end of Sin for them;
My righteousness does make them just,
who is it that dare condemn!
It Is finished! This through all the Earth,
to Sinners gives a call;
All things are ready, Sinners come
unto this Marriage all.
It Is finished! O how pleasant is
to guilty Souls this sound?
It does bind up the broken Bones,
And heals each deadly wound.
It Is finished! don't your Souls, O Saints,
leap at this pleasant voice?
For your redemption's now complete,
forevermore rejoice.
O but it has a sound of dread
to all the damned below!
Love, Mercy, Grace, are finished
but not a drop for you.
You Dev'ls, for you I have not bled,
and Sinners you defied
My Blood, and have my Person scorned:
Now you shall be denied.
To him that washed us with his Blood
Eternal praise be given,
From all the Saints that are on Earth,
and all the Saints in Heaven.
HYMN XIV.
O Wondrous Godlike righteousness!
then tinctured with the God head through
The bright perfections of a God
do over all this garment flow.
The Tongues of glorious Saints above,
and Angels voices, cannot express
The beauteous shining glory of
this Everlasting righteousness.
It is Almighty in it self
and of ^lmighty virtue too,
And all things both in Heaven and Earth
it can, and will, and does subdue.
It Is all-sufficient, it can give,
what ere poor sinners want, or crave;
It gives all things to the poor,
and does unto the utmost save.
It never changes, though we may;
it shall on Saints outshine the Sun;
Nothing in us can alter this,
nor now, nor when our life is done.
Let us, that made are Priests to God,
clad in this white and shining dress,
Still send our shoutings up of praise,
unto the Lord our righteousness.
HYMN XV.
WE black, but comely are, O Men,
black in our selves, comely in him,
Who is the Lord our Righteousness,
pronounced clear, though we have sin.
O! What a Righteousness is this
that has Jehovah for it is name!
And is our Righteousness and his,
in name and self the very same!
Our selves are poor, we nothing have,
and yet we all things do possess.
We only glory in the Lord,
even in the Lord our Righteousness.
We in our selves the sentence have
Of death, but our dear Savior bled:
Our confidence we put in him,
who raised up Jesus from the Dead.
We are pronounced all over clean;
the Plague of Leprosy has done;
Our great High Priest has this pronounced
we are without guilt before the Throne.
Lord give us mighty Faith in this,
and we shall mighty Foes subdue;
Our Faith's (like Samps. hairs) our strength
by which we Bars and Gates break through.
Let Us Honor, Glory, Power, give,
and Hallelujah to him sing,
Who is the Bright and Morning Star,
the awful great immortal King.
HYMN XVI.
IF greatest Price can purchase peace,
Believer ben't afraid
To buy for thee his Fathers peace,
Christ has the Ransom paid.
If strength and power can prevail
to Rescue thee from Thrall;
Cheer up; for thy Redeemer's strong,
the Sovereign Lord of all.
If the prevailing prayer of
a powerful Favorite,
Can for thee any grace procure,
then fear thou not thy right.
Peace, Pardon, Life, and Glory too,
are without Question thine:
His Intercession, Death and Power,
do all for thee combine.
For Christ thou have, and thou have all,
and glory thou shall have:
He who e're lives to intercede,
can to the utmost save.
Now thanks let us give to him that lives,
to intercede above,
And let us to his glory live,
through Patience, Faith, and Love.
HYMN XVII.
THE heart of Christ in Heaven now
is stored with grace and love,
His Bowels toward Sinners now
with strong Compassion move.
He gives no slumper to his Eyes,
but still employs his Care,
How to deliver his in the World
out of the Devils Snare.
There he does plead, and intercede,
with his great Father too;
Thus he employs his glorious Care
to Rescue us from Woe.
His Love and Bowels are not changed,
for all his glorious Crown:
Sinners, O could you see his Face,
O sure twould melt you down!
His Gospel, and his Spirit too,
unbosome him to you:
O view his grace, accept his grace,
believe his grace most true.
Come, you are welcome to his grace;
O cast your selves therein,
This is the Fountain opened wide,
to cleanse from filth of Sin.
Is there a hardened Sinner here,
that will this grace refuse?
On thy own Head then be thy Blood,
since thou will Ruin choose.
Let us that tasted have this grace,
his Praises sound on high:
Let Us praise this grace, O glorious grace!
Reign thou Eternally.
HYMN XVIII.
CHrist does the Crown in Zion wear,
and all the Nations Rules,
And by his power he does subdue
untamed Rebellious Souls.
Preached to the World, received by Faith;
of Heaven, Earth, and Hell,
The mighty King and Sovereign Lord,
who can his glory tell?
The Fountain; nay the Ocean,
the fullness of all grace:
The glory of the Father shines
in thy most lovely Face.
The Temple, which the splendid Train
of all the Godhead fills:
Perfections, Beauties, blaze in thee,
of everlasting Hills.
The bright, the clear Essential Glass;
in which we may behold
Jehovah's shining Majesty,
Out-dazling Pearls and Gold.
Of thee we'll sing, Almighty King,
our glorious Solomon;
Our Jesus, Prophet, Prince, and Priest,
the Father's Christ and Son.
O! who may dare with thee compare?
Created Beings all,
Like Dagon, before the Ark of old,
before thy Feet must fall.
Let Us Echo forth his praise, who is
the Judge of Quick and Dead:
In Zion's Gates praise for thee waits,
our Sovereign Lord and Head.
HYMN XIX.
CHrist our high priest, defends his Church
a Wall of Fire round about,
The Bulwark of Jerusalem;
He like a King in her does shout.
His Eyes are watchful to secure
his glory upon her from harms;
Our Solomon has Valiant Men
to keep his Bed from Night Alarms.
That which intitles him to all,
is the bright Garment which he wears;
And it is that Covering that secures
us from our filth, and guilt, and fears.
The Godly stand now in that Robe,
and shall for ever stand therein;
This Garment is a Covering for
our Holiness as well as Sin.
It is the Righteousness of Christ,
that is with him at God's Right Hand;
And it is in the Lord above we have
this Righteousness wherein we stand.
This Covering has it is great defense,
for Jacob's God with Jacob is
As a strong Tower, because he sees
no Sin in him as Clothed with this.
Our God and Father in his Love,
does rest upon his Mercy-Seat,
And thence, with us, about his Grace,
his Love, and Favor stoops to treat.
All thanks and praise be to his Name,
who dwells in his Love's resting place;
And thence for ever does shour down
on Rebels, Favor, Love, and Grace.
HYMN XX.
OUR great High Priest, our person does
To's Father represent,
In that refulgent splendid Robe,
that casts forth Spice's scent.
He takes our Prayers, and he throws out
what is Sinful, and what is Bad:
Reformed thus he brings them in
with his own Merits Clad.
And Holiness unto the Lord,
does write upon them all:
We, and our Duties, stand in him,
and thus can never fall.
Though poor our Persons; poor our Frames;
and poor our Duties too:
Yet we are rich in him; and ours
do make a splendid show.
A Prayer, like the Chatt'ring of a Crane,
mixed with this Incense, flies
Like to the mighty Clouds above,
and pierces through the Skies.
There they are entered on the File,
and Blessings will bring down;
They now above, and we one Day,
shall wear the promised Crown.
Glory let us bring unto our King,
and Intercessor too;
High Praises to our Advocate
that dwells in Heaven, are due.
HYMN XXI.
TO him that loved us of himself,
and died to do us good,
And washed us from our Scarlet Sins,
in his most precious Blood.
And made us Kings and Priests to God,
his Father infinite,
To him Eternal Glory be,
and Everlasting Might.
The Lamb is worthy that was slain,
to have all Power, and Wealth,
All Honor, Glory, Wisdom, Strength,
thanks for his saving health.
Thanks, Honor, Glory, Power to him,
that on the Throne does sit,
And to the Lamb for ever and
for ever; so be it.
Thousands of Thousands of the Saints,
which stand before their King,
With shining Robes, and spreading Palms,
loud Hallelujahs sing.
Ascribe Salvation to our Lord,
who sits upon the Throne,
And to the Lamb, the glorious Lamb,
Ascribe Salvation.
Amen, Amen, the Angels cry,
Salvation is his due:
And we through all Eternity,
his Praises will renew.
Thanks, Glory, Blessing, Wisdom, Might,
Honor and Power then,
Be to our God, and to the Lamb,
for evermore, Amen.
HYMN XXII.
O! Let us bow before the Lord,
the Lord of glory that is above,
Who Tabernacled among us:
O great effects of wondrous Love!
And through the Vail his blessed Flesh,
let us go to God on the Mercy Seat;
Who sits to Commune with us thence,
As before God in him complete.
Glory and Praise, let us warble forth,
to him, in an Angelick strain;
To him the Lamb upon the Throne,
to him the Lamb that has been slain.
He is that Temple in which God
does lift his Train of Glory high:
All the perfections shine in him,
of the Eternal Diety.
How glorious is this mighty King!
How full of Majesty this Son;
How richly clad this great High Priest!
how fair this welbeloved one!
He is the Altar all of Gold,
he is the Hill of Frankincense:
Our duties all are Sanctified,
accepted too, as coming thence.
Coals from this Altar touch our Lips
that we may his great praises sound:
O let our Tongues be still employed
to publish all his acts around.
HYMN XXIII.
CHrist in our sins was wrapped about,
when he our Sacrifice did fall;
Sins all met upon our Lord.
He satisfaction made for all.
That so believers might be wrapped
about with his great Righteousness,
To cover duty, Sin, and Self
that there appear no nakedness.
He broke the Power, and hid the Filth,
he dissol'vd the guilt of Sin:
The graces of Heaven and Holiness,
has op't to let his Nation in.
He in his Body on the Tree
has to his God them reconciled;
The Father Sinners does embrace,
through Jesus Christ his only Child.
He is the Ark and resting place,
Where gathered Sinners are secure
From the great Flood of Sin and wrath,
in a retreat that is most sure.
In him the Fathers goodness dwells;
in him the Fathers love appears,
In him we in Gods love abide
delivered from our guilt and fears.
Therefore let us celebrate his praise,
who is the mighty Prince of Life;
Who would espouse a filthy Soul,
unto himself, and make his Wife.
Glory and Honor unto him;
sing praise (and let no Tongue be dumb)
Unto the bleeding Lamb above;
for by his Blood we overcome.
HYMN XXIV. Sung at a Funeral.
Blessed door of Bliss to weary Saints,
thou art grim Death become;
Secured as in a Cabinet
their dust is in the tomb.
By Death they enter to those joys
prepared for them above,
There they are ever swallowed up
in endless life and Love.
O! There they see as they are seen,
with clear unclouded views;
O! There they hear of nothing else
but joyful, glorious news.
Anthems of joys, of love, and praise,
And Hallelujah's sung:
Who would be fond of this vain World
this Dross this Dirt, this Dung?
There Saints for ever do behold
their dearest Jesus Face:
There always they admiring are
Eternal boundless grace.
They Are in the House not made with Hands;
in Heaven Eternally
They dwell, and with the Rays of Christ
they shine most gloriously.
Quite freed from labor, sorrow, Sin,
from Cumbrance, Peril, Pain;
Then we shall find what e're we did
For Christ was not in vain.
Now Heavens work is here begun,
the work of singing praise;
The work and will of God in Christ,
which there will work always.
HYMN XXV.
GLory and praise, ascribe always
to the Eternal King:
Ye blessed Saints with Heart and Voice
his glorious wonders sing.
While Christ endures, ye are secure
tied with strong Covenant bands;
Lust never can nor Death, nor Man
pluck you from Jesus Hands.
Your Husband, Head, your Sheppard, friend,
he who engaged for you,
Is the Almighty and All-wise,
unchangeable and true.
The Covenant on God's great word,
and Oath most firmly stands:
The Father's above all, none can
pluck from the Fathers Hands.
He from Eternity Decreed,
the Elect should happy be;
Nor World, nor Flesh, nor Man's bad heart
can alter his Decree.
O then lets praise, since Heavens joys
are in our Souls begun;
And let our praises like our joys,
have never never done.
HYMN. XXVI.
ANd has the high and lofty One,
that dwells in bright Eternal day,
Stoop't down to embrace poor Clods of Earth
And dwell in tenements of Clay?
Ravishing, condescending Love!
O goodness that is astonishing!
Who would not warble forth thy praise?
the wonders of thy glory sing?
Did ever King dissolve himself
to have Communion with the Poor?
Or lay his Grandeur by to embrace,
a base, deformed Black-a-moor?
But the Eternal Majesty
the Lord of glory, he did so:
The great Creators boundless love
through Christ does to his Creatures flow:
His Creatures; nay his wretched ones,
his most rebellious Enemies;
These his delight, his Jewels; these,
these are the Apples of his Eyes.
What shall we say? ravished, amaze
and where if we could speak begin?
In silence then let us sink down,
since such vast depths we are swallowed in
HYMN XXVII.
O! What a great High Priest have we
with garments shining bright!
And in whose garments we appear
before our God in light.
Our Priest does sit upon the Throne,
a Prophet understood:
Thence rules and guides, as well as saves
us with his God-like Blood.
Who'd not to such a Scepter bow,
that is Righteousness and Peace?
Who would not such Obedience choose
that is an holy ease?
Our King is great Melchizadech,
and King of Salem too!
What pleasure, Honor, glory is it
that he should us subdue?
O! What an Officer have we;
Eternal, infinite,
Unchangeable, supreme, most true,
most glorious, pure, and bright.
Eternal honor to our Priest,
Eternal thanks and praise:
Let Us Hallelujahs warble forth,
let us sing to him always.
HYMN XXVIII.
THe train of Heavenly glory fills
the Flesh wherein the Godhead dwells:
The Fathers goodness his blessed Face,
whence we receive and grace for grace
This is the Mercy Seat, and Throne,
which boundless Grace does sit upon;
Eternal wisdom does enshrine
it is beams in him, and thence they shine
Hence wicked Rebels for to harm,
comes forth the thunder of Gods arm
All power over earth, over hell, over heaven
is by the Father to him given.
The beams of inf'nite Holiness,
do dart most awful through his Flesh:
The Holy Jesus does declare,
what holiness in the Godhead are.
He is a saving gracious Christ;
the judgment that God did entrust
With him does plainly manifest,
both to the damned and the just.
This great foundation that endures,
Reveals our God more true and sure:
To sum up all, we hence infer,
He is the Fathers Character.
Who would not love this lovely Son
this bright, this glorious shining one?
What stammezing Tongue can silent be,
Or is there an unbowing Knee?
O! Let his brightness be unfurled,
tell ye his wonders through the World;
Inspired with an holy flame,
make mention of his awful name.
HYMN XXIX.
Let Us not the Holy Spirit grieve,
but let us it is motions Mind:
Saints, let us say our Sails are filled
with this almighty Wind.
If vain or wicked we should be
in Lip, in Life, or Heart,
Or else defile our selves with Pitch
the Spirit will depart.
If we should dare Christ's honor slight,
b^ in duty negligent,
The Spirit will be quenched, by that,
whom Son and Father sent.
When we his Gifts and callings slight,
and's message do distrust;
We then the Spirit do provoke,
and's motions do resist.
When we don't hearken unto him
but to the Law within;
No wonder then we fettered are,
and feel the reign of Sin.
When we no Heart, nor Lip, nor Tongue
have for his praise to move;
No wonder he does cease to tell
us stories of Christ's love.
HYMN XXX.
JEhovah Jesus, O how sweet!
how healing and how good
Is the Almighty virtue of
his Godlike Sacred Blood!
It Is the Eye Salve that cures the mind,
it is Gileads Sovereign Balm;
Dead Souls it quickens, and it makes
a fleeting conscience calm.
It wrath removes, God reconciles,
creates a peace within;
Although it daily Crucifies
in dwelling lust and Sin.
'Tween David's house and Saul's, it sets
a constant fatal strife:
O happy we! Although it grieves,
that is a sign of life.
Oh! precious Blood! O Sacred Flood!
that in perdition drowns
Our lust and sin that reign within
but us with glory Crowns.
Why will the sinner perish, since
there is such an healing Pool?
Such fountains opened in Christ's side
to heal his leprous Soul?
O! Hallelujah ever be
sung in Jehovah's praise,
Who such Salvation wrought to us,
such glory, bliss, and joys!
HYMN XXXI.
WHat glorious Intercessor's this
that lives for us upon the Throne!
He is arrayed with glory bright,
and long has in that glory shone.
He Is with the greatest honors crowned,
advanced to highest dignity
He Is vested with almighty power,
above all powers set on high.
He Is King of Heaven, Earth, and Hell;
all things subjected are to him,
Angels, and Devils, and mankind,
both good and bad, Death, Hell, and Sin.
But yet his Children's Minister
all this does for their service own,
He rules over all them for to serve
And sits their Priest upon the Throne.
Thus he employs his powers all,
his glory, might, and Majesty,
His favor, and his interest,
to serve his Childrens liberty.
This he does manage every hour,
and every Moment, now above,
Even our Salvation, safety, peace,
and is not this amazing love!
All honor, glory, thanks, and praise,
be to this Intercessor given;
Who for the service of our Faith
sits now enthroned on high in Heaven.
HYMN XXXII.
COme let us find out our cursed sin;
and therefore let us go
Unto a Crucified Christ,
and there we sin shall know.
Let Us humbled be and mourn for sin;
therefore let us go and view
Our Jesus whom our sins did pierce
then shall our grief be true.
So let us loath Sin and our selves,
our God is pacified;
And his love defug'd over Mounts,
then when our Jesus died.
To God let us make acknowledgment
for sin with shame of Face:
Our Father saw us a far of,
and ran to our embrace.
Repentance is a beauteous Tree
On Faith its Roots does grow;
It Is watered, and is juc't by Love,
which love from Faith does flow.
Sinners, you must repent or dye;
and would you then repent,
O! Come to Jesus he will give
your godly sorrow vent.
O! Come to him, and do not stay
for mourning first, or ease;
For change of life, or broken Heart,
for he will give all these.
Come you with us, and honor him;
let us honor his free grace,
Let that be magnified alone
and that alone embrace.
HYMN XXXIII.
O God in goodness infinite,
thou art most ready to forgive,
Who from thy Bosom sent'st thy Son,
to dye for us, that we might live.
Come grieved consciences, come taste
This heavenly cheer, so choice, so good;
Get into Jesus wounded sides,
drink in the virtue of his Blood.
Your Smart shall turned be into joy
your Sin shall dye, your grief shall cease:
This shed Blood in thy Heart shall shed
the love of Jesus and his peace.
Thou shall see God thy Father is,
that he has chose thee before time;
That all thy Sins forgotten are,
that Christ in covenant is thine.
Come all ye Saints, and praise the Lord,
who has done such great things for you;
Admire, adore his goodness all,
which is as boundless as it is true.
HYMN XXXIV.
Through every grace and duty too,
Faith does it self diffuse;
For Holiness in Heart and Life
is Faith put out to use.
Faith is the Root and Tree, from which
all other Branches slide,
And every grace of the Spirit is
(but faith) diversified.
Love's faith embracing: Hope is faith
that looks for what is to come:
Patience is faith expecting; Zeal
is faith upon the run:
And self-denial is a grace
that empties us of all
That self abhors, and comes to Christ
according to his call.
Each duty must be done in Faith;
Faith throughout all must run:
The Devil, Sin, the World and all
it is Faith must overcome.
Now to the purchaser of Faith,
and giver of it too,
Be honor, glory, thanks, and praise,
as it is most meet and due.
HYMN XXXV.
LOve ye your lovely Lord, ye Saints,
who is altogether fair:
Created beauties are but shades
if they with him compare.
Stir and awake your Souls to Love,
your Jesus to embrace:
With wonders all his Glory view,
that is full of truth and grace.
His blessed example imitate,
and learn of him who is meek,
His lowly humble steps tread in,
his Face and favor seek.
Give honor to King Jesus, Saints,
give honor to his name;
The Fathers honor does require,
the Son should have the same.
His Father has transferred on him
his glory, judgment, fame;
He has advanced him very high:
O! Magnify his name!
Therefore all honor unto him,
and praises are most due:
The Almighty, wise, Eternal King,
the Holy, Just, and true.
HYMN XXXVI.
GOd of all grace, let us see thy Face,
being freed from law and Sin:
These did enslave; by grace we have
a freedom now within.
The Law shall not rise to tyrannize,
our glory to deface,
It shall no more on us have Power,
for we are under grace.
O purge our Souls, and do thou roll
away our sin and fear:
Christ's Blood ith heart will ease sin's smart,
and seal a pardon there.
Jehovah Lord, the Eternal word,
thou brightest Majesty
Arrayed with bright and dazeling light,
thou sit^st enthroned on high.
Thy Saints now throw their Crowns below
thy awful throne and Feet,
And prostrate fall to worship all;
for it is most just and meet.
Thy glorious light, Majestic Might,
thou do with dread reveal:
Thy gracious ear bow down to prayer
thou do diseases heal.
And thou do thus walk among us,
displaying power and love;
The Gospel Charm (thy stretched Arm)
does on these Waters move.
Thou worthy art from Lip and Heart,
all Thanks and Praise to have;
All Glory, Power, (every Hour,)
and Honor to receive.
O! let us all thy Name extol,
thy glorious Fame let us raise!
Let Heavens sing, let Earth forth bring,
and Seas roar out thy praise.
Ye Saints that wait at Zion's Gate,
sing praise to Zion's King,
Hosannahs! Hallelujahs all!
still Hallelujahs sing!
HYMN XXXVII.
BElieve, O Soul, and thou shall see
Heavens Dew on thee distill;
Mount up thy Faith, and thou shall see
a greater Glory still.
Let not thy Unbelief obstruct
Christ's growing Interest now;
Only believe, that all unto
his mighty Name might bow.
Upon the Wing of Acts of Faith,
do thou exalt his Name:
Believe his Glory's shining bright,
his Person is the same.
Believe the World down at his Feet,
and Zion glorious made:
We may believe that firmly, which
the God of truth has said.
Believe all Sickness shall be healed;
O Blind, and ye shall see,
Believe, O Deaf, and ye shall hear;
O Lame, and ye shall flee.
Open the Eye of Faith, O Soul,
behold thy glorious Christ;
Who altogether lovely is,
as Prophet, King, and Priest.
Look Sinners unto Jesus, look
with an unveiled Face,
And you shall see our Lord for you
filled full of Truth and Grace.
Glory and Honor to our Lord!
let us Honor him by Faith;
Let Us without wavering believe,
what e're our Jesus says.
HYMN XXXVIII.
LOok unto Jesus, Sinners look,
if you would Salvation have;
Who Is God the Savior, and none else;
it is only he can save.
His Righteousness more bright is far
than Angels Holiness:
Our best of Doings are but Rags;
a poor and tattered Dress.
Christ is our Righteousness and Strength,
him Rock and Fortress call;
Christ our Redemption, Wisdom, Peace;
Christ is our all in all.
Our mighty King, and Captain too,
his Armies are abroad:
Be still, O Zion; who leads forth
their Armies, is thy God.
Sing Hallelujah unto him:
his Sword is on his Thigh:
To him be Honor and Renown,
and brightest Majesty.
HYMN XXXIX.
SIng Hallelujah! Zion sing,
sing your Gods praise in lasting verse:
You who Redeemed are by his Blood,
in Zion now his Acts rehearse.
When you were distant from the Lord,
as wide as Heaven from Hell does lie;
He then your Sacrifice became,
and by his Blood he brought you nigh.
The Sword of Vengeance due to you,
he in his bleeding sides received:
You for eternal Slaughter bound,
(By dying in your stead,) relieved.
When that Gods wrath burned down to hell
he satisfied: the Father smiled:
His Death the Enmity destroyed,
God and the Sinner reconciled!
Jehovah and his Rebels may
in a Christ Crucified meet:
O! let us then throw down our all
at an Almighty Saviors Feet.
God is come down into the Camp,
O let the Camp of God be pure;
That it the burning presence of
the Lord of Hosts may now endure.
Praise waits for thee in Zion, Lord,
in Judah thy great Name is known;
There thou the Giant Unbelief,
and Hosts of Sin, have overthrown.
HYMN XL.
WHat fullness of rich glorious Grace,
in Christ is to be found!
Look to him Soul; thou shall be healed
of every Deadly Wound.
The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
dwell in him Bodily:
In Jesus Face the Glory shines
of all the Diety.
Believing views of Grace in Christ,
set weary Souls at rest;
Set free the Captives, and relieve
the Troubled and Oppressed.
Make strong the Weak, cherish the Faint.
make glad the Mourning Heart,
Souls Thirst abate, and Hunger break,
eases each deadly smart.
Souls Life create, Sins power destroys,
Lip, Life, and Soul refine;
They poison Sin, by pou^ring in
the Gospels Cordial Wine.
View not the Grace in your own Hearts,
that cannot it self uphold:
Seek ye a risen Christ above
the tried approved Gold.
We view our sin that is within,
and our inherent Grace;
And sin the more, yea grow more poor:
let us look to Jesus Face.
Hail Mighty One, Eternal Son,
the Glass wherein we view
The Fathers shining brightness, and
his glorious Person too.
All hail to thee, exalted Prince,
our Husband, Brother, Friend;
To thee all Honor, Glory, Praise,
be Ages without end.
HYMN XLI.
THE Almighty smiled upon his Son,
When he our peace became:
Gods Wrath does cease, a lasting peace
is made 'tween God and Man.
O! what are we? Eternity
should choose us when undone;
In its great thoughts we then had room,
else we to Hell had gone.
Electing Love, how did thou move
to us in our distress?
No Banks can bound, no Line can sound
thee, Ocean bottomless.
Our Mounts of Sin cannot bound thee in,
nor hinder thy proceed:
Like Jordan, thou did overflow
its mighty Banks with speed.
Thus Heaven shall be Eternally,
the Saints Inheritance;
With Glories Crowned, for ever drowned
in Joys Eternal Trance.
Then let us, Lord, with one accord,
Thy Praises Celebrate:
Praise does for thee, O glorious Three,
in thy Mount Zion wait.
Let them that be now saved by thee,
in Soul and Body too,
To thee repair, God hearing Prayer
with highest Praises now.
HYMN XLII.
WHat mighty Weight of Glory, Lord
in Heaven for Saints prepared is!
Rivers of Pleasure, endless Joys,
what boundless Ocean of Bliss!
No Sin nor Sorrow enters there,
all Tears from Eyes are wiped away:
No Shade of Darkness, or of Night,
But all a bright Eternal Day.
There we shall see as we are seen,
appearing in Christ's Glory too;
Arrayed with his most shining Robes,
his Face we shall for ever view!
Poor Christless Souls, what will you do?
you have no Lot nor Portion here:
Our pained Bowels yearn for you;
O! come and learn our Lord to fear.
Come join with us in Covenant,
perpetually to serve the Lord,
And you shall see your selves in him,
discharg^d according to his Word.
Once we were dead in Sin, as you,
but now we are alive in Christ:
Come you, take him as we have done,
our glorious Prophet, King and Priest.
We that redeemed are by his Blood,
from Nations, Kindreds, Blood and Tongues
Let us in Zion Praises give
and magnify his Name with Songs.
HYMN XLIII.
CHrist is the same as e're he was;
as full of Truth and Grace:
There Is the same Pity as e're was
in his exalted Face.
As full of Love as when at first
he undertook for us:
He is a God that changes not,
but is for ever thus.
As full of pity to poor Souls
as when he on the Tree
Did hang, thy bleeding Sacrifice,
and Vengeance bore for thee.
Sinners he is as able (now
yea, and as willing too)
To save you, as when he at first
did Grace proclaim to you.
Come therefore on his Bowels roll,
behold they yearn for you;
His Pity and his Mercy be
as boundless as they are true.
Give Honor to King Jesus, Saints
honor his Grace and Truth:
This glorious he, a green Fir Tree,
has still the Dew of Youth.
HYMN XLIV.
MAke good thy Word, O mighty Lord,
to thy beloved Son:
Take to his Throne thy holy One,
our glorious Solomon,
We sigh to see how all things be
even in Emmanuel's Land:
The wicked mad, the righteous sad,
whilst thou with-holdst thy Hand.
This Morning Star seems very far,
this budding branch to dye;
This King so crowned to be dethroned,
this Captain seems to fly.
His purchased Crown seems tumbling down
this Lion seeks no prey,
Confusedly hurled is this mad World:
sweet Jesus haste away.
Arise, O Sun, with Glory run,
to perfect noon break forth:
Make Nations bright, and with thy Light
O! cover all the Earth.
Great God of Love, send from above
thy new Jerusalem:
On Jesus Head, cause thou to spread
his sparkling Diadem.
Hosanna's! Hallelujahs ring!
our Jesus comes apace:
Bow every Knee; all Hell shall flee
from the Terror of his Face.
Flow mighty Hills like Rivers swift,
and Mountains flee a way;
A Lamb you will see a Lion be
that rises to the Prey.
With Glory and exceeding Power
He on the Clouds does fit;
The Clouds we see, so black that be
t^ dust are of his Feet.
HYMN XLV.
LOrd, when thou from eternity
did see us float in Sins Abyss,
We floated then in thy good will:
O! was there ever Love like this!
When vile and filthy, thou to us
did thine eternal Grace incline;
When we most hateful were, did love:
O! was there ever Love like thine!
thou took'st us, though thou did foresee
what odious Rebels we would prove,
Malicious, froward, obstinate:
O! was there ever such a Love!
Must the Eternal swear to us,
through Faith we should not glory miss!
Must Jesus Death this ratify!
O! was there ever Love like this!
Must God engage by Word and Oath
to make us with his Grace to shine,
And give us Heaven at the last!
O! was there ever Love like thine!
O what is Heaven! who can tell?
who can conceive that boundless Bliss?
It Is with Christ's Glory to be dressed:
O! was there ever Love like this!
Lord, being amazed with thy Love,
we do our admiration raise;
With boundless Love astonished thus
in our amazements speak thy praise!
O Hallelujah, Glory, Power,
Thanksgiving, Might and Majesty,
Be now and ever, Lord by us,
and by all thine ascribed to thee.
HYMN XLVI. (On some Verses in Isaiah LIII.)
Our Jesus poured his Soul to Death,
and with the Wicked made his grave:
The Father pleased to crush him thus,
that he thereby might Sinners save.
Therefore he shall prolong his Days,
until the Day of Judgment's over;
Then shall he see his numerous Seed
his traveling Soul unto him bore.
In that great Host he shall rejoice;
and to his Father with delight
Present them there, for to remain
in his and in his Father's Sight.
For he acquitted them from Death,
and thereore made them to believe
This was his right to do, because
he died for them that they might live.
Because he weighty Vengeance bore,
the Father will devide to him
A Portion with the great and strong,
and he shall spoil Death, Hell and Sin.
Blessed be Jehovah, among us,
a Spoil is given him with the strong;
With Joy we witness that our Lord
has had a Portion in this Throng.
We hope his greatest Lots behind,
his Death and Sufferings for him plead:
he that did for poor Sinners dye,
now ever lives to intercede.
HYMN XLVII. A Hymn sung at Mr. B -- 's Funeral Sermon: 1 Cor. 15.
Blessed are the Dead that dye in Christ,
they triumph over Death:
In falling they do conquer, and
live in their latest Breath.
How in the Cahriot of free Grace
the saved one triumph does!
And when Death strikes him to the Heart,
over Death he triumphs thus.
O ^rmed Justice, what say thou?
death has no Sting from thee:
Thou art become my best of Friends,
whom Jesus has set free.
O Law of God! where are thy Swords
of threats and sore Deamnds?
My Jesus, Death has wrested them
out of Death's cruel Hands.
O Sin! the bitter Sting of Death,
both in its filth and guilt:
My Jesus now destroyed them quite
by the Blood that he has spilt.
Thou cruel Executioner!
vile Satan! what say thou?
I scorn thy Arts, Threats and Assaults;
thou can not reach me now.
Thou Conscience that did use to smart,
thou now art fully eased,
The Storm that troubled thee, now is
eternlaly appeased.
But oh! poor Sinners what will you
do, when Death comes to give
The Blow that sends you down to Hell
without the leaft reprieve?
Death's to the good an end of Woe,
but does your woe begin:
Heavens Gate to them, but Hell's to you
that live and dye in Sin.
HYMN XLVIII. (On the Second Sermon.)
Though the dead Bodies of the Saints
thou do devouring Grave destory,
Yet in the last Day they shall rise:
then Grave where is thy Victory?
When Sea and Grave must them resign,
and all their Prisons open fly,
To let the Dead in Christ rise first:
then Grave where is thy Victory?
Corrupted, drossy Dust and Clay,
when first they fall the Tombs them have;
Thence incorruptible they will rise,
then where is thy Victory O Grave?
Thou do prepare their Dust to rise,
most glorious Bodies bright and free:
O Grave is this the worst thou do?
then Grave where is thy Victory?
Thou great Alembic do distill
frail mortal Bodies, that they be
Immortal, glorious, spiritual:
then Grave where is thy Victory?
True, thou deprivest and deprav'st,
by rotting Sinners Carcases:
For future Woes and Plagues, we grant
thou have a Conquest over these.
HYMN XLIX. (A Paraphrase on Psalm 113.)
LO what a pleasant lovely Sight,
how full of ravishing Delight,
Is it, that Children should agree,
That are of the same Family!
It Is like the consecrated Oil,
Rich, precious of a fragrant Smell,
that was divinely poured and shed
on the High Priest's devoted Head.
That Smelling sweetly did over flow
His Garment and his Members too;
Over every Member it did stream,
and it perfumed every Hem.
Thus the Communion of the Saints
Perfumes the Body 'n all its Joints;
supples and heals, and smooths each part,
and eases every deadly Smart.
It Is like the Dew on Hermon's top,
That gave a fruitful smiling Drop;
and like the D^w on Zion's Hill,
that made it green and grassy still.
In Zion Blessing's to be had,
Our Hearts rejoice there, and are glad;
there glorious Riches are in store,
there is given out Life for evermore.
HYMN L.
O Grace! recovered Sinners should
than Adam happier be;
Than Adam in his best Estate,
more glorious and more free.
Faith views, obeys, loves and enjoys
in Christ, the God of Grace,
Beyond what perfect Reason could,
when with its clearest Face.
Eternal Sovereign, reigning Grace
does elect Sinners lead
Through various Rooms, the Courts of Bliss
and Glory for to tread.
First in estate of Happiness,
in upright Adam blessed,
Filled with a perfect natural Bliss;
but that is not their Rest.
Down tumble thence to Sin's Abiss,
as low as Death and Hell;
That Grace in raising them from thence
might boundless Worth reveal.
Raised unto Faith in the Wilderness,
Faith weak, imperfect, faint,
Mixed with Law, Guilt and Unbelief,
with Doubting and Complaint.
Then to the Canaan of Faith here,
they pass unto their rest,
Beginning in the New Jerusalem,
whence Tears and Griefs have ceased.
And having judged the World with Christ,
to Glory have a Call;
With Christ then swallowed up in God,
and God be all in all.
Glory and Praise in Christ our Head,
be given unto him,
Who Love eternal this ordained
to us when sunk in Sin.
HYMN LI.
ELecting Grace by Justice stopped
could not find out a Passage free,
'Till the Redeemer stepped between,
and that too from Eternity.
The Curtains of Election stopped
finds vent in Jesus wounded Sides;
The boundless Sea of God-like Love
o'reflow'd in those blessed purple Tides.
Grace through the Righteousness of Christ
must Channels find, e're the Decree
Of God's electing inf'nite Love,
could perfect and completed be.
Conscience can never be truly eased,
until Atonement it believes;
Nothing can cure its Wounds, but what
to Justice Satisfaction gives.
The Conscience from dead Works alone,
the Blood of Christ must pacify;
The precious Blood oth' Lamb of God
from guilt and filth must set us free.
Hosanna! to the God of Grace,
Hosanna! to the God of Love,
That through his wounded pierced Son
proclaimed such Tidings from above.
HYMN LII.
THe Gospel does declare
Electing Grace alone,
That Is hid in Christ our great High Priest
that sits upon the Throne.
Our Christ has dearly bought
this Grace, and yet it is free:
What ever it our Jesus cost
it is free for thee and me.
Electing Love does you,
O chosen ones, embrace:
Whilst millions fall on the right and left,
ye saved are by Grace.
What Grace is this indeed?
that vilest, poorest we,
The most polluted Rebels, sunk
in deepest Misery,
Should to this high degree
of Honor chosen be,
Vessels of Mercy, to be filled
with Love eternally.
Whilst Sinners more refined,
more wise, rich, mighty all,
That might have hon'red Jesus more,
are left to sink in the fall.
What Grace distinguishing
to me and thee is this!
That have found out that Pearl of Price
which thousands others miss.
That we should chosen be,
who might have been as well
Of that forelorn and wretched Troop
that should have marched to Hell.
When we Salvation view
in its Foundation Stone,
We Are made to cry together grace!
yea grace! free grace alone!
HYMN LIII. (A HYMN sung on a Day of Thanksgiving, set apart by a Church of
Christ, to celebrate and praise the Lord for his late Favors and Mercies unto
them.)
EXalted Praise in Zion waits,
for him that loves his Zion's Gates;
His Church he values far more than
the Dwellings of Jerusalem.
There he takes up his resting place;
there he bestows his glorious Grace:
There Life and Blessings he commands,
and there arrayed with Glory stands.
There he his Name and Glory placed,
his Footstool has with Honor graced:
And there his mighty Horns do spread,
and's Crown does flourish on his Head.
His House we are, if we hold fast,
our confidence unto the last,
And firm rejoicing to the end;
whence still his Blessings down he will send.
It pleased our Lord and Master thus,
to give the Kingdom unto us,
Who are but low and in distress,
while shining in his Comeliness.
When in the trying Season, we
did from his Cause and Banner flee:
And many did with Idols join,
yet thou took'st Pity upon thine.
Though great's the Blow that did remove
thy Servant, whom our Souls did love:
And with fine Wheat had fed us Years,
that we were sunk in grief of Fears.
Yet though the Ship was tossed in Storms,
our sleeping Lord secured from harm's
And did a gracious Message send,
that we our evil ways amend. Mr. H.
Then bone to bone did come again,
through all the Visionary Plain:
The scattered Members did agree
to dwell again in Unity.
Oh! boundless Grace that did us know,
when we were scattered, poor and low:
His Mercy does for e're endure:
Oh; Love eternal, boundless, sure!
Another Prophet came again. Mr. S.
with Prophesies a Second time;
We should return and build God's House,
and he anew would us espouse.
The Spirit of our Jesus came
with that blessed Word, and did inflame
Our Hearts with Zeal and holy Trust,
and made us favor Zion's dust.
We rose to build, and Christ rose too;
his Goodness before us did flow;
His Glory did descend upon
our Tabernacle, and their shone.
To Zion then were great resorts;
and many flockt unto her Courts:
The golden Gate stood always open,
then Achors Valley, a door of Hope.
Oh! boundless grace that did us know,
when we were scattered, poor and low;
His Mercy does for e're endure:
Oh! love eternal, boundless sure!
But then a sudden Cloud arose,
'tween Christ and us did interpose:
A night comes on, a dawning day:
our Glory soon was snach't away.
Our Gold grew on a sudden dim:
our Crown of Glory fell by sin.
Our sweet to Gall and Wormwood turned,
and Zion's solemn Meetings mourned.
Her Paths for the most part untrod,
deserted by an angry God:
Her Builders fail; the Work does cease,
they sliding were to sinful ease.
The forwardest began to shrink,
the bearers of the Burdens sink:
We spent our Months for to complain:
but then our Lord returned again.
Oh boundless grace that did us know,
when we were scattered, poor and low!
His mercy does for e're endure:
Oh! love eternal, boundless, sure!
Then our beloved came a pace
into his Garden with his grace,
Upon his Bride again to shine;
and brings his Honey, Myrrh and Wine.
He joyful Messages does bring,
makes us of Love and Mercy sing:
Then various Sinners, a great Train
are to this Zion born again.
Now Light and Life with Zion's King
come to her, Songs anew they sing:
And Zion's Gates are open again,
unto her Flock a numerous train.
Her Converts very bright and fair;
her Stones the beauteous Saphires are:
The Lord, their Fellows them above,
has 'ointed them with Joy and Love.
The Lord does for our quiet care;
his Arm too, for us is made bare:
Though to this day we do provoke,
we murmur and we tempt this stroke.
Yet in this Israel he don't see.
perverseness or iniquity;
Clad in the Righteousness of Christ,
our merciful and great High Priest.
We further glory shall behold,
he will for our Silver give us Gold:
We yet shall greater things receive,
if we hold on, and do believe.
Because of all this mighty Grace,
at this high Throne and resting place,
We meet to offer up this day,
the Sacrifice of Thanks and Praise.
To him the God of Grace and Love,
that sits upon the Throne above;
That lives forever, evermore,
we prostrate fall now to adore.
Worthy's the Lamb upon the Throne.
that once was slain, that once did moan;
All Power, Riches, Strength, to have,
all Honor, Glory, to receive.
O boundless Grace that did us know,
when we were scatt'red poor and low!
His Mercy does for er'e endure;
O love eternal, boundless, sure!
HYMN LIVE.
Let Us sing the praises of the Lamb
whose Blood has made us bright,
And whose Obedience to the Law
has made us Perfect white;
Yea, we in him more righteous are,
then Adam er'e could be:
With an obedience God-like, he
O bey'd for thee and me.
The Law is fully satisfied,
the Law is honored too;
Not a mere Man, God-Man obeyed,
and that was more than due.
The Law of works cannot condemn,
nor ought of us demand;
We gave full satisfaction to it
through our Mediators hand.
We righteous are in a Law-sense,
and therefore justified:
Our Jesus risen now does plead,
that once obeyed and died.
Select Hymns.
BOOK. II.
HYMN I.
ALL ye Seraphic trains above,
in silence now remain:
None can set forth electing Love,
but Jesus that was slain.
The fathers love to sinners is
so great that none can know;
Nothing but Jesus crucified
erecting Love can Show.
The brightness of electing grace
we no where else can see,
But in those purple Streams alone
which Jesus bled for me.
Come Sinners come behold what Love
Christ's bleeding sides did run!
By faith see Jesus pierced for you,
if you for sin would mourn:
Your tears like Mary's then will flow,
when Jesus wounds you See;
You will abhor your Selves, and cry
was Jesus pierced for me!
HYMN II.
It Is finished! cried our dying Lord,
when he hung on the tree:
O what a pleasant sound indeed
it is finished is to me!
Sin, that was finished on the Cross
with Christ 'twas crucified;
Our Lord did make an end of Sin
when on the Cross he died.
Wrath, it was also finished too
upon our Lord, when he
Did give himself a sacrifice,
and naild was to the tree.
Yea Righteousness was finished too,
and was completed, when
Our Jesus pou'red forth his Soul
for us rebellious Men.
It Is finished! now before the throne
Christ's blood does pleading cry:
It Is finished! in the Conscience too,
it sounds pleasantly.
It Is finished! is a a joyful sound;
what tongue can silent be;
^aptures of praise let us sing allways
our Jesus unto thee,
HYMN III.
O! thou art fair my Love, I Say
there is no Spot in thee:
Not only fair, but all fair too,
no spot in thee I See.
Whose voice is this I hear so Sweet?
it is my beloved's sure,
That tells me I am now so fair,
so spotless, and so pure.
My love it is I that tell thee so,
it is thy belovea's voice
That tells thee thou art now so fair,
that thou may now rejoice
What did he say, I now am fair?
alas! how can it be?
That I that nothing am but spots,
should now so spotless be?
Sure he does mean, I shall be so,
not that I now am fair:
Can such a vile polluted wretch
without a spot appear?
O stay my love and hark to me,
I say, thou art fair now;
O stay thy reasoning a while,
and I will tell thee how.
My love, it is I have made thee so
my blood has made thee white;
My righteousness has thee arrayed,
and made thee dazzling bright.
I in my body once did bear
thy Sins upon the tree,
My standing in thy room and stead
has made thee spotless be.
O my beloved, hold thy peace,
thy love transporting is:
O stay me, I am sick of love;
O! what a love is this!
What finite Wisdom can conceive?
what pen or tongue can show
The vast demensions of his love
that in these streams did flow.
I mean those bleeding p^ple streams
that from Christ's sides did run,
There you may see the love of three;
and yet those three are one.
HYMN IV.
Rejoice, ye Saints, in praises high
your rob^s are fair and white:
The Lamb presents you evermore
to the Father with delight.
Sing therefore ye redeemed ones,
his praises let us show
That with his blood has made us white,
yea whiter than the snow.
What love, our lovely Lord is this
that in thy blood does shine!
Let Us evermore thy love adore:
no love was er'e like thine.
By faith let us take a turn about
our bleeding Lord, and see
What love his bleeding sides did run
when he hung on the tree.
Let Cherubins and Seraphins
that now are round the throne,
Salvation sing unto the Lamb
that worthy is alone.
HYMN V.
OUr Surety from Eternity,
engagd himself to pay
Our debts to the Father to the full
at the appointed Day.
The Father took our Surety's word,
and therefore did set free
Those Saints that died before our Lord
did hang upon the tree.
They were to glory also gone,
and there were happy made,
Before our Lord had of their debts
the actual payment paid.
But now in Gospel days we do
the glorious Mys'try see;
That all our debts to th'full were paid
when Christ hung on the tree.
We need no Sacrifices bring,
but the Sacrifice of Praise,
In Songs of triumph we may spend
our now remaining Days.
For sure it will not now be long,
e're we our Lord shall see;
And evermore our Lord adore,
when we with him shall be.
HYMN VI.
WE through the Law of life in Christ
from Moses are set free;
And being dead to the Law, we live
that grace might honored be.
We cease to work for Life, yet work
as if we life should gain:
We work not 'cause the Law commands,
Christ's love does us constrain.
We Are drawn to work by the Law of love
which gently does constrain,
This makes our service a delight,
our labor without pain
Constraining grace does set's awork,
not Conscience rage and pain:
We do not work 'cause Moses bids,
but 'cause the Lamb is Slain.
O Sinners! would you work aright?
come unto Jesus then,
Who has oth' Father gifts received
for us rebellious Men.
There Is life and strength in Christ alone
which Moses cannot give;
Which to the Law will make you dead
that you to God may live.
HYMN VII.
COme, let us triumph in the Lamb
our Lord that once did dye:
We that believe in Jesus may.
have everlasting Joy.
Come Law of God, what have thou now
of us for to demand?
Thy Curses all did meet on Christ,
that did our Surety stand.
Though we do Sin thou can not curse,
thy Curses all did lie
Upon our bleeding Lord, when he
our Sacrifice did dye.
Come, Justice, where is now thy Charge?
what have thou now to show?
We do to thee present the blood
that from Christ's Sides did flow
Thine Arrows all did meet on him,
when nailed to the Tree:
Our Lord himself he did become
a Sacrifice to thee.
Vile Satan, where are now thy bills:
our Sins cannot be found,
The God-like Garment of our Lord
completely wraps us round.
O Hallelujah to the Lamb
that has now set us free:
Our Crowns we throw thy feet below,
and give the praise to thee.
HYMN VIII.
WHat means this tumultuous noise
that in the Nations be?
The Lamb is hastening to his Throne,
we in these Clouds may see.
His Chariot wheels do come apace;
he is hasting on his way:
Come quickly our Beloved, come,
sweet Jesus don't delay.
Have, be thou like a Roe or Heart
that on the Mountains be,
Until the Day does clearly break,
and all the Shadows fle.
Thy Lovesick Spouse, Lord knows not how
thy absence thus to bear:
Thy presence most delightful is,
thou art to us most dear.
O! therefore have our lovely Lord;
we long thy face to see:
Come swiftly like a Roe or Heart
that on the Mountains be.
HYMN IX.
ALL the Seraphic trains above
are stooping down below,
To learn of the Church that Mystery
past Ages did not know.
But now the Vail is rent in twain,
the Mys'try is unfold;
Justice and Mercy reconciled
we now by Faith hehold.
We now in Gospel Days may go
into the Holy Place:
We in a bleeding Jesus see
Gods reconciled face.
Our Sins past, present, and to come
are new all covered over
In The Ocean of our Saviors blood
where they shall rise no more.
To God in our own Nature, we
in Gospel Days do go:
Mount Sinai's Saints did little of
these glorious Mys'tries know.
These Mysteries from Ages past
within the Vail were pent;
But when our Lord hung on the Cross,
the Vail in twain was rent.
Now glorious Grace unveiled is
and in Christ's face does shine;
There drink may we abundantly
of well refined Wine.
HYMN X.
TO him the Lamb upon the Throne,
whose Flesh the Godhead fills
And all its Rays are there displayed,
in whom all fullness dwells.
To him that washed us in his blood,
let us praise and honor Sing:
Let us adore, and Magnify
our great exalted King.
Come ye redeemed ones, sound forth
new Songs of prise unto
Him that has washed you from your Sins,
and made you white as Snow:
And now in Robes most richly wrought,
we to the King are brought,
Supposing Angels, that have not
a Robe so Richly wrought.
We therefore throw our Crowns below
that awful Seat and Throne;
Singing the Lambs new Song, and say,
thou worthy art alone,
All praise and honor for to have
by us for evermore
Sing therefore praises to the Lamb,
and Sing forevermore.
HYMN XI.
COme Sing, O ye redeemed ones,
to the Lamb upon the Throne:
Sound forth the praises of the Lamb
the Fathers holy One.
O! take a turn by Faith about
the bleeding Lamb of God,
O! See him crying out under
his Fathers heavy Rod.
O! see him wounded for your Sins:
behold your bleeding Lord
Recieving in his bleeding Sides,
the Fathers flaming Sword.
Look to your pierced Lord, ye Saints,
then you indeed shall mourn,
As one that weepeth bitterly
as for an only Son.
Behold, what Streams of Love did flow
thus from your pierced Lord,
When that the Father did against
his fellow wake his Sword.
Which gave the reconciling blow
(O here was love indeed!)
On him the Victim of our peace
and we thereby were freed.
HYMN XII.
COme let us our dearest Jesus view,
that for our Sins was Slain;
And gave himself for us, that we
might with him ever Reign.
Our dearest Jesus, if a taste
of love be here so sweet,
What will it be when we shall with
our dear beloved meet!
If now and then a Smile from thee
be sweet that is quickly gone;
What will the right of Vision be
that never shall be done!
If we are taken to the Mount
one moment while below,
If thou the Vail do draw aside,
and us thy Glory show;
We then cry out we are Sick of love,
and with thee long to be:
O then, how shall we burn with Love
when face to face we See!
When Clouds shall interpose no more,
no Vail shall be between;
But we our dearest Lord shall see
as we our selves are seen.
And we as reigning Kings and Priests,
shall Hallelujah sing
For ever to the reigning Lamb
our now exalted King.
O now let us Sing the Lambs new Song
and also him adore:
The Day is coming we shall be
with him forevermore.
HYMN XIII.
HOw beautiful upon the Mount
are they that peace Proclaim,
That unto Rebels after Grace
in their great Masters name;
That unto Captives do declare
glad tidings, and do tell
To Sinners there is a ransom found
to save their Souls from Hell!
Such joyful tidings do bow down
stout sturdy Rebels, and
Such love and grace does Sinners make
in admiration Stand.
Mount Sinai's fiery Law will not break
a heart that is like a Stone;
It Is flaming Arrows at the Walls
of Brass in vain are thrown.
It Is only pardon that does melt,
and Love does Sinners draw;
It Is grace does quench the thirst of sin,
and not the threats oth' Law.
What mean such then that Terrors preahc,
and Sin ai's Law proclaim?
Since it is not Sinai's fiery dart,
will quench Sins rage and flame.
The Message they are sent withal
that in Christ's name do go,
It is to offer pard'ning Grace,
to Sinners while they are so.
HYMN XIV.
RIse Zion, Shine, thy Light is come
the glorious Day's begun:
These Beams we se so bright that be,
dart from the glorious Sun
Of righteousness, that rising is:
the Day does dawn apace;
The Songs of praise we hear adays
of Christ and his free Grace.
Are tokens plain the Lamb once Slain,
is hastening to his Throne:
The Bride does say, come have away
my dear beloved One.
The Saints rejoice; the Turtles voice
is heard within our Land:
The Hundred forty four thousand
do on mount Zion stand.
And there they Sing to Christ their King
their Songs in such a strain,
That there are none but those alone
for whom the Lamb was Slain,
Can learn the Songs the Saints do Sing:
the Song of Moses now
Is laid aside by the Lambs Bride
'cause it is a note too low.
Ye taught ones of the Lord, Sing praise
to the Lamb the throne upon;
It Is only he taught you and me
to Sing the Lambs new Song.
HYMN XV.
O My Dove, that art in the Clefts
within the Rocks that be,
And in the Secrt place oth' stairs,
where thou no Light can see;
Though thou art in the dark, yet I
thy Countenance would see,
For it is comely, and thy Voice
most pleasant unto me.
Give me therefore one look of Faith,
my Sister, and my Bride,
My Love, my Dove, my fair One, that
within the Rocks resid'st.
My Love, my Undefiled one,
though in the Clefts thou art,
And in the dark, one Act of Faith
will steal away my heart.
O! do not think my heart is changed;
I am not like to thee:
I loved thee so, I died for Love,
when thou did not love me.
O hark my Soul! whose Voice is this
that sounds so pleasantly!
It is my Jesus, that did once
for such a Rebel dye.
O Unbelief! thou Enemy
what stories did thou tell?
What Message did thou bring to me,
was it not framed in Hell?
My Jesus that did bleed for me
when I a Rebel was,
His Heart's the same to me, as when
he hung upon the Cross.
HYMN XVI.
THy Names, O Jesus! pleasant are,
like Ointment pou'red forth:
It is by Christ alone, that we
diliv'red are from Wrath.
Jesus, his Name is called, and
it has a pleasant sound;
'Cause he does save us from our Sins,
and our Rebellions drowned.
His name the Lord our Righteousness;
that has a pleasant found;
That Garment covers all our Spots,
that Robe does wrap us round.
His Name our Advocate, also
that sounds pleasantly;
'Cause he does live to Intercede
that once for us did dye.
His Name our Passover, also
that Sacrificed was,
Is pleasant, 'cause his Blood being seen
Justice does over us pass
Like precious Ointment also is
his Name, a Stone that is tried;
A precious Stone: thus Jesus is
that for poor Sinners died.
HYMN XVII.
O Worthy is the Lamb of God
to be exalted in
The hearts of the Redeemed ones,
'cause he saves them from Sin.
His Righteousness revealed unto
the Soul, does Sin destroy,
And Jesus death in the Conscience is
Sin's death immediately.
When Christ within the Soul (where Sin
did Reign) his Grace displays;
Pardoning Grace does Sin displace,
by its' bright glorious Rays.
This Glorious Son does rule, among
(by Righteousness,) his Foes;
This Lamb that is Slain destroys Sin's reign
and all that him oppose.
O Grace! ^ich glorious Grace indeed!
must Jesus death destory
My Lust's and Sin that reign within?
O Grace reign gloriously.
HYMN XVIII.
IN Christ we Sin do overcome;
such sights do Sin destroy:
Pardoning Grace in Jesus Face
does fill the Soul with Joy.
These sights of Sin that we see in
the Blood of Christ, does give
New strength unto the Soul to go
to Christ, and so to live.
By the life of him that conquered Sin,
and did the Victory gain:
Therefore away, and do not stay,
to the Lamb that once was Slain.
Thus Christ revealed the Conscience in,
destroyed the Power and Throne
Of Sin, that had Usurped within,
where Christ should re^ alone.
Come Saints, go forth with Courage then,
your Lord has got the Day;
And Sin has slain, that Grace might reign
within your Souls allway.
HYMN XIX.
BRight burning Beams of Gospel grace
have Lord for to display,
For to burn up in all thy Saints
their Stuble, Whod, and Hay.
Break forth, O Sun of Righteousness!
unto the perfect Day;
Have holy one unto thy Throne,
our Jesus have away.
But O! who may abide that day
when Zion's King shall reign?
Who may abide when he the pride
of all proud Flesh will stain?
Tremble ye careless ones that are
at ease in Zion, and
Wonder, and stay because that Day
is very near at Hand.
It now does dawn, this glorious Morn
beginning is to appear;
What means else these lowings, and
these bleatings we do hear?
Mhe Saints do sing to Christ their King,
whilst others rage with Pain
Because of the bright, and dazeling Light,
of the Lamb that once was slain.
Redeemed ones Sing praises, for
this Fire's but to try
Away your Dross, that by it is loss
Christ may you purify.
HYMN XX.
THE Lamb of God is Zions King;
in Righteousness he reigns:
Sing praises therefore, all ye Isles
sound forth Triumphant Strains.
O Isles break forth in praises high,
your Crowned King does reign
Both King of Heaven, Earth, and Hell,
because he once was slain.
He reigns in Heave'n gloriously:
to the Lamb, Salvation!
Is sounded forth continually
by the Angels round the Throne.
This Lamb does also reign on Earth:
the Saints do praises Sing;
The Isles do sound the praises of
Zions exalted King.
The Hay, and Stubble of the Saints
Consumed shall be away,
When this bright Sun of Righteousness,
breaks forth to perfect Day.
O Hallelujah! let the Isles
Sing unto Zions King;
That unto them, Salvation,
through Righteousness does bring.
HYMN XXI.
COme Saints, and view Eternal Love
in its bright glorious reign;
O see its rays, and bright displayes
'ith Lamb when he was slain.
The deluge of electing Grace
was broken up indeed,
And like an Ocean did run
through Christ, when he did bleed.
Infinite, true, almighty too,
Grace then appeared to be;
By conquering Law, Hell, and Sin,
when Christ hung on the Tree.
Mount Sinai's frery Curses all
came Smoking on our Lord,
But Grace's reign the Curse has slain,
and snatched away the Sword
Of Justice, that so bright did Flame,
no Sinner might come Nigh:
But Grace did ope' the heart of Christ,
and quenched it presently.
Like Sampsons Cords, our Sins did bind
our Jesus to the Tree:
But Grace like Fire, consumed them all,
and set our Sampson free.
O Silence men, and Angels too!
what Grace is, none can tell;
Nothing but Jesus Blood can Speak
Electing Language well.
HYMN XXII.
COme let us praise Electing Grace;
that chose us when undone,
That did delight to make us bright,
and therefore gave his Son
To spill his precious God-like Blood,
to purge us from all stain;
And make us Kings, and Priests, to God,
that we might with him reign.
How did Electing Love display?
it is royal Scepter in
The Blood of Christ, our great high Priest
when he Atton'd for Sin!
Oh Grace, rich, glorious, Grace indeed!
that deluged forth so free
Through those bright Purple streams that ran
from Christ when on the Tree.
Come Saints, and view your pierced Lord
that you may mourn indeed:
Oh! see what streams of Love did flow
through Christ when he did bleed.
Then you ashamed shall be, and loath
your selves for what you 've' done;
Beholding the Father reconciled
to you, through's only Son.
And Sinners, if you would mourn aright,
look to the Lamb that is slain;
Where e're for Mourning else you look,
your looking is in vain.
HYMN XXIII.
THe Lord does Zion found;
her building must be strong:
Jehovah is her righteousness,
God's her Salvation.
The Lord her stones has laid
in Colors that are fair:
And her foundations also
of polish't Saphirs are.
Jerusalem is built
with Towers all around:
We'll tell the Nations Messengers
the Lord does Zion found.
God in her Palaces
is known a refuge strong:
A Cup shall she of trembling be
the Nations among.
All that against her fight,
weary themselves in vain;
For in mount Zion gloriously
King Jesus he does reign.
Therefore in Judahs Land
we have this pleasant Song:
We have a City very sure,
God's her Salvation.
No violence shall more
be heard at all in thee:
The Sons of those that did oppose
shall bending Suppliants be.
They that despisd thee too,
shall as thy feet bow down,
And call thee by Jehovahs name
because of thy renown.
The Sun shall be no more
by Day to thee a light;
Jehovah he thy light shall be
thy God thy glory bright.
Thou in Jehovahs Hand
shall be a precious gem;
Yea, thou shall be eternally
a royal Diadem.
Forsaken thou shall not
at all forever be;
Because Jehovah does rejoice,
thy God does joy in thee.
Therefore the Nations all
shall smitten be with fear,
Because Jehovah-Shammah is
her name, the Lord is there.
HYMN XXIV.
WHat ails the Nations angry be?
what noise is this we hear?
The Gospel takes away their Gods
and that they cannot bear.
The exaltation of the Lamb,
whose glory's shining forth,
Has these tumultuous noises made,
and made the people wrath.
The Saints begin to speak in such
an evangelick strain;
The Conscience of the Pharisee
it fills with rage and pain.
The Hundred forty four thousand
in such a strain do sing,
That none but the redeemed ones
can touch upon that String.
The work-monger he wonders why
the Saints do always Sing,
And cannot bear their triumph 'cause
it does his Conscience sting.
Come Saints strike up your Songs of Praise
though Men and Devils join,
The Scribe and Pharisee also
together do combine.
It Is all in vain, the Lamb is slain,
and lives for ever more:
We therefore Sing unto our King
and always him adore.
HYMN XXV.
SInners are saved alone by Grace,
and Works excluded be;
Come Sinner therefore come to Christ
his Robes will cover thee.
Thou need'st not bring Price in thy Hand,
thy Works must not come in;
Chist's Robe alone will hide thy Spots
and cover all thy Sin.
What though thy Sins be very great,
and of the deepest dye?
There is no perishing for thee
if thou to Jesus fly.
Sinners, have you a mind to Christ,
to make a match with him?
Come then, though nothing in your selves
ye have but Lusts and Sin.
God in the Gospel offers Grace
to the worst of Sinners still;
His Royal Proclamation is
that whosoever will.
Let him come drink of pard'ning Grace
to quench Sins fiery rage:
Come taste how gracious he is
this will your thirst assuage.
And when you see God reconciled
you will see your Sins aright:
Free Grace will make Sin to appear
more odious in your sight.
HYMN XXVI.
O God of grace! In Jesus Face
we see thee reconciled,
Thy wrath him broke, he bore the stroke
on us our Father smiled.
What boundless Love's the Father's Love
no Tongue can it express;
No Angel can this mystery scan
to Sinners in distress.
What strange prodigious thing is this,
(we cannot conceiv't aright)
That God should bruise his only Son
to do his Justice right!
O what is Sin! There Is none can tell
but God that is infinite;
That God was pleased to crush his Son
that was his Souls delight.
How stored with Love's the Heart of Christ
to Sinners here below,
That he should thus degrade himself,
and vengeance undergo!
How large with Love's the Heart of Christ!
his Soul was straitened
Till he had laid the Ransom down
and all was finished.
What ready way to'th' Father now
is made by Jesus Christ!
Continually he is on the Throne
our interceeding Priest.
Therefore do we continually
from time to time again,
Ascribe always, Blessing and Praise
for evermore, Amen.
HYMN XXVII.
OUr Jesus is that tender Plant
that springs from highest ground:
Though Adam's dead, Christ is our Head;
in whom our Fruit is found.
Our Jesus is a green Fir Tree;
come let us sit down, and rest,
Under his shade: How pleasant is
his Fruit unto our Taste!
How pleasant is his shade to us!
he always us relieves;
His Fruit does shelter, wrap us round,
not like to Adams Leaves.
Come! This is not forbidden Fruit,
no, no, you need nor fear:
It Is Jesus that does bid you eat:
the Serpent is not here.
Our Jesus is our Green Fir Tree,
in him our Fruit is seen;
In him our Fruit does never decay,
in him we are always green.
The Wind that blows where it lists,
does now begin to blow;
Hark! How the South Wind shakes the Fruit
and makes it fall below.
Poor Sinners now begin to see
the beauty of the Plant;
They see in him, laid up for them
what ever they do want.
Hark Saints! What Sinners say of him
how they are by him moved:
As the Apple Tree among the Trees
so is our dear Beloved.
Oh Sinners! Tell us what you ailed;
what makes you thus to cry?
Our Jesus in not used to be
so pleasant in your Eye.
He Is brought us to his Banquet House,
to Grace he is brought us too;
His Banner over us was Love:
We know not what to do.
The Love of Jesus is so strong,
our Heart, our Bowels move:
Stay us with Eaggons our Beloved;
we are sick of Love, of Love.
Bles't be the Lamb for ever more,
the Lamb upon the Throne:
Of Blessed be our green Fir Tree
in whom's our Fruit alone.
HYMN XXVIII.
HOw reigning Grace began to reign
from all Eternity?
And we the Subjects must be made
of it; why we? Oh why!
Who was before Eternity
to hinder Grace to reign,
Or hinder God to send his Son
us to redeem again?
Who spoke one word when Jesus said
I come to do thy Will?
Who him opposed when he came down
his God-like Blood to spill?
When thus our Jesus came on Earth
to dye, who hindered him?
Though Men and Devils all did cry
away, away with him.
Indeed when Death took hold of him
the Grace it brought him to,
Two days it held him in its bonds
the Third, it let him go:
Oh! How did Men, and Devils strive
to get his Body Dead?
The Devil bruising of his Heel
has got a broken Head.
Though Men his Bloody Murderers
who did him crucify,
Who with the Spear did pierce his side,
yet they were saved thereby.
Oh Law of sin! What have thou got?
O Satan! what have thou?
Free reigning Grace through Righteousness
was glorified by you.
Although we fell as low as Hell
from thence we are made free:
He broke the Bars of Death and Hell,
and thus escaped are we.
Sinners its but a folly then
to turn away your Face,
You Will certainly be overcome,
if once you deal with Grace.
Who Will hinder then when Jesus Calls?
what Devil will be there
That can us hinder, when we Mount
to meet the Lord in the Air?
Let Us sing to the Honor of his Grace
by which with Christ we reign,
When Jesus comes the second time
we will rise, and sing again.
HYMN XXIX.
O Wounding commendation!
God did commend his only Son,
That we might reconciled be,
and through his wounds made nigh to thee
Thou wicked Rebel was the Man,
which caused the Sword, which Justice ran
Into his Godlike-side, to miss
thine wn, and pointed be at his.
But Love to us did make him cry,
while in this bitter Agony
I am to be Baptized for some,
oh how I long to see it done!
Oh love! Oh Lamb! we have seen thee bleed,
our Pardons in thy wounds we read,
And on thy Heart Love! Love! we spy
in Characters of purple dye.
Oh Love! Oh Grace! Oh boundless Love!
'twas it that did our Jesus move:
And Love will draw, Grace will constrain
to Love our loving Lord again.
Amazing, melting, wounding Love!
attracting, blazing from above;
Amazing love our Souls does drowned
they are scarcely in our Bodies found.
Oh! Let Us lift up our dazzled Eyes
to this amazing Sacrifice:
The Lamb once slain is now above,
and clothed with Eternal Love.
Honor, and glory, and renown
be to the Lamb upon the Throne,
That once did dye, that once was slain
that we might with him ever reign.
HYMN XXX.
BEhold the Atonement's offered now,
the Priest with Blood is gone
In the Holy place, and there appears
to keep possession.
Hark! How the Jubilee Trumpet sounds,
which does to us proclaim,
We cannot sell our Inheritance,
it comes to us again.
The Lot of our Inheritance
is ours, and most secure;
The Testament is writ, and sealed
with Blood of Jesus sure.
You that have sold your Heritage
for Want, or Poverty,
Come to your Lands, they are not your own
this is the Jubilee cry.
Ye Captive Bondslaves, come away,
That sold your selves for naught;
The Jubilee sounds, ye are set free,
you are not your own, you are bought.
Honor and glory be to him
who does for us appear;
Let Us always sing, and rest in him;
this is the Jubilee year.
HYMN XXXI.
O Boundless, boundless Love!
our Father did commend,
Which in himself was found alone
did not on us depend.
O Independent Love!
Oh rich electing Grace!
Which was hid in our Fathers Heart,
seen in our Jesus Face.
Oh Love unchangable!
Oh Grace to such as we!
Which no respect to persons had,
though we polluted be.
What kind of Love is this
which through our Jesus flows!
Thus boundless Love God from above
to us vile Rebels shows.
O Love! Eternal Love!
who can thy Bands unty?
The sacred Dove says we are loved
to all Eternity.
We shall rest in this Love
Where're we come or go:
His Mercies sure, do yet endure;
let the redeemed say so
Alluring Love indeed!
when we are brought so nigh
To thrust our hands in Jesus wounds
our Fathers love to spy.
Oh Soul amazing Love!
who melts our Hearts indeed:
Oh! Our beloved we are sick
thy Love does so exceed.
Oh melting Love indeed!
Oh bleeding Love! Oh Grace!
Love's broken through our Jesus sides:
each drop of Blood cries Peace.
Where is that stony Heart
that will forbear to break;
If hardened we should silent be
sure Rocks would melt, and speak.
We love to hear of Love,
because he is loving bin,
And this did dearly manifest
in blotting out our Sin.
Oh Love! Alluring Love
Oh melting Love indeed!
Oh Love! returning Love! we will come
we will follow thee with speed.
HYMN XXXII.
Here Is a Physician indeed!
his Life he lays down,
His Hearts Blood he has poured forth
to heal his Patients wound.
He knows the Sinners sickness, that
comes to him for relief;
He knows all our infirmities,
for he has born our grief.
What love like this! What love like this!
nothing can do us good,
Nothing can heal us of our Wounds
but our Physicians Blood.
To cure sinners sicknesses.
must the Physician Bleed?
Must our Physician's hearts-blood run?
Oh Bloody cure indeed!
Look Sinners, don't you Jesus see
turning himself about?
Saying, who is it that touches me?
for virtue is gone out.
You that have touched his Robes to day
cry out, it is me, it is me:
Behold! He says, be of good Cheer
thy Sins forgiven be.
Let Us praise our great Physician then
who thus for Sinners stood:
Who writ our Pardons by his Death,
and sealed them with his Blood.
HYMN XXXIII.
WHo shall ascend the Hill of Faith,
the Holy Hill of God?
Who shall be worthy there to stand,
and there to have abode?
It shall be he, says Justice then,
whose Heart and Hand is pure:
He shall ascend on high, yea, and
receive the Blessing sure.
Lift up you Heads, says Jesus then,
ye everlasting Doors
Stand open wide for me and mine
for I have paid their scores:
Whatever thou requir'st of them
I have it here to pay.
Lit up the Doors, i will enter in,
come lift them up, I say.
Who is that King, says Justice then?
who is it that is so bold?
No Sin shall ever enter in,
that I Am resolved of Old.
It is King Jesus, then says Grace,
of Heaven and Earth the Lord;
Yet freely gave his God-like Breast
unto thy flaming Sword.
It Is he of whom thou did require
his Blood, yea had thy fill,
And now demands Possession,
for his, of Zions Hill.
Is this the King? He shall come in:
let Justice Mercy kiss,
Now I am fully satisfied,
i will plead for him, and his.
The Voice cries not a second time
to Sinners yet in Sin,
Be lifted up ye Doors, and let
the King of glory in.
Who is that King of Glory great?
the Sinners Heart replies:
Who Is this that speaks with such command
saying, ye Doors arise?
Its thy related Lord, and King,
which once was slain for thee,
And now is rose again, and cries,
my Sister ope' to me.
Must I stand knocking here without?
what stony heart have thou
To let me waiting be, until
my Head is filled with Dew?
I Will put my Finger at the Door,
i will stand no more without:
Now I am in, i will tell my Queen
thy Sins i'v'e blotted out.
This King of Glory let us exalt
who is ascended high;
By whose ascension we shall have
over Death the Victory.
HYMN XXXIV.
WHen we were far estranged from God,
and cast out of his sight;
God placed the Flaming Sword of the Law
to guard the Tree of Life.
But Jesus being one of us,
and of the seed of Man;
To get Eternal life for us
upon the Sword he ran.
Awake, O Sword! thus says the Lord,
against the Man like me;
If thou will take Eternal Life
thy Heart's Blood I must see.
Thus Jesus did receive the blow
into his glorious Side:
His Wounds and Blood have interposed
our Enmity so wide.
The Gates of Heaven are opened wide
now Sinners may come in,
For God to them is reconciled
all by the Blood of him.
The Sinner reconciled too
by Grace must be intic't;
For God to them is reconciled,
all by the Blood of Christ.
Come forth, ye Prisoners of Hope,
come forth, be not afraid;
The Blood of Christ has made you right,
and all your Debts has paid.
Hark! Hark! what God the Father says,
the Sinner to entice;
Peace, Peace to them that are far off,
all by the Blood of Christ.
Hark! how the Blood of Christ cries Peace
in the Sinners Conscience too;
When all your works will bring no Peace
the Blood of Christ will do.
What though the Sinner be far off
by his rebellious Sin,
The place where Jesus Blood came out
the sinner may come in.
Honor to him, who unto God
has made us Kings and Priests,
we once far off, are now made nigh
by the Blood of Jesus Christ.
HYMN XXXV.
O 'masing Wisdom, and Decree!
that Gods permissive will should be
To let us fall as low as Hell
although he loved us so well.
O glorious dazzling reigning Grace!
which shines through our Jesus face,
While we be all condemned to dye,
then reigning Grace dose justify.
O glorious Will immutable!
must we deserve no less than Hell?
Raised from a Dunghill to a Throne
accepted through this Grace alone.
To glorify free reigning Grace
thine Image Satan must deface:
What Grace was here? our Image is
made more conformable to his.
No change can happen to us now,
in Adam this we did not know:
In dying now we do not dye,
but dye to live Eternally.
Oh height of Love! why we! why we!
why should we be thus saved by thee!
Oh Depth of Love! what Tongue can tell?
he saved us when as low as Hell.
O Breadth of Glorious pard'ning Grace!
it is as large as er'e it was:
Oh Length of Grace! resolvedly
to love us from Eternity.
HYMN XXXVI.
HOw blessed are the called ones
to the Marriage of the Lamb!
By eating of his parched Flesh
they shall for ever stand.
His Heart and Soul they were the Price
for which we purchased be;
And now will keep his Marriage feast
with such poor dust as we.
Oh! stand not knocking at the Door,
but break it open wide:
Come in our Jesus, feast with us
thy undefiled Bride.
Why standst thou knocking at the Door?
why knockest thou to Day?
Why would thou have the upper Room?
Lord what have thou to say?
I would come in to Solemnize,
and celebrate with thee
My Marriage Covenant and Feast:
my Dove, Oh! open to me.
Is this the thing why thou would come in?
we cannot bear thy complaint:
My Love, my Choice, is this thy Voice?
our Souls are like to faint!
O Lord come in; thy Fingers in;
we feel our Locks to move,
We'v'e heard thee say, Love come away
my Sister, and my Dove.
Come in thy Room thou bruised Lamb;
tell us of Love to Day;
The wrath thou'st born and overgon
oh! tell thy Dallilah.
Come with me then, my Love, my Dove,
come view the cursed Tree,
Come view the Cross, see where I lost
all my Hearts Blood for thee.
Come view my pierced wounded Hands,
my bruised Sides come see,
My Feet that trip't over Hills to bring
tidings of Joy to thee.
Why should thy cursed Unbelief
bring me again to dye;
Do but Believe, and I am thine,
to all Eternity.
HYMN XXXVII.
JEsus our Shepherd's here to Day,
he in his Fold is come
To take the weak Lambs in his Arms;
and feed the Ewes with young.
Although the weak ones go astray,
they are yet dear to him,
Because the Father on him lay
the Guilt of every Sin.
The strong ones he enables more:
the weak that are behind
He takes up in his Bosom, and
their Wounds and Bruises binds.
The Lambs are in their Jesus Arms,
they hear his Bowels sound;
He keeps them close from any Harms:
their Hands are in his Wounds.
They are so near unto his Heart,
he hears their cry and moan;
His Bowels answer them, my Grace
sufficient is alone.
They will not keep in the Bands of Grace,
nor by the Waters clear;
But stray in un-forbidden Grounds
of doubting and despair.
He brings them back again, and makes
himself a Wall about;
Salvation Banks on every side,
they may no more go out.
Their Pasture's green and flourishing;
for Grace does never decay:
They cannot want or Hungry be
except they go astray.
They that are weak, and cannot go,
they may lie down and rest,
Solace themselves in Pastures green,
and eat where they like best.
With Eating they grow quick and strong,
they get the feet of Hinds;
So they become the foremost Sheep
and go no more behind.
HYMN XXXVIII.
Our Father from Eternity
did see us in our Sin,
His boundless Grace did move him so
he called his Son to him.
Come my Delight, my Glory bright,
my wrath thou must remove;
There is a company of Men
whom I do dearly Love.
Now for exchange, thou needs must change,
and take their Sin on thee;
Thy righteousness, thy merits shall
to them imputed be.
Then, said the Son it is done, it is done!
I come to do thy will;
Ere I will fail a jot thereof
my dearest blood shall Spill.
How did the Lord delight to see
the obedience of his Son!
How smiled he his Soul to see
a Sacrifice become!
How pleased was he his Son to see
a bearing of the Wood!
Smi'ld at the wounds from whence ran down
his reconciling Blood.
At length he smiled, when reconciled,
looks on has bruised Son;
Holds out his hand to Bankrupt Man,
and cries It Is done! It Is done!
Now God and Man is reconciled,
the enmity is done,
And meet before the Sacrifice
of Peace, his bruised Son.
HYMN XXXIX.
WHose Body's this that is taken down
from off the cursed Tree?
How comes it to be drenched in Blood
and full of wounds to be?
Our dearest Jesus we would know,
why for us thou did dye?
Why lay thy Body roul'd in Blood?
O tell us! Tell us why!
O would thou know, my Love my Dove,
why I hung on the Tree?
I Will tell thee why: I had those wounds
and bruised was for thee.
thou say you are sick of Love; but what
Is all this Love of thine
Compared to me? Thy greatest Love
Is nothing unto mine.
My boundless Love to thee has been
so cruel unto me;
Yea my affections were so strong
I died with love for thee.
Had thou but heard how hard I begged
the Father once for thee;
I would not be denied, but cried
my Father give her me.
My Bloody Body testifies
of boundless Love and Grace:
I will uphold thy Patience
'till thou have run thy race.
HYMN XL.
Hear now the Robels, says the Lord;
must I my Justice take in Hand?
Must I go smite the Rock for you
with Law, which did you all condemn?
My wrath and indignation
which by this Sin was due to thee,
I have laid upon Christ my Son;
did ever any Love like me!
I Have testified my boundless Love
in smiting of my Son for thee
Behold! Behold! Rebels behold
did ever any Love like me!
Nothing but the Blood of my dear Son
could take the guilt of Sin from thee:
It was for thee his Hearts Blood ran;
did ever any Love like me!
The Streams of love which flow through him,
shall never leave, but follow thee
Through all this Desert Wilderness,
O Love! Whoever loved like me!
Though thou should turn to Sinai's Mount,
to Bondage and legality;
My Grace shall bring thee back again.
for never any loved like me.
Although through pride thou should Rebel
against me in a high degree,
My Streaming Love shall cover all:
O Love! Who ever loved like me!
When thou art in desertions deep
pretending great humility:
My streaming Love shall flow down there;
for never none did love like me.
My Streaming Love shall never turn back,
but follow Streaming after thee,
Whilst thou art overcome with Love,
and cry, whoever Loved like thee!
O Love! When shall I see the Rock
from whence this Love Streams down to me?
This Streaming Love does make me long
to see him, who so Loved me.
HYMN XLI.
LEt us behold our great High Priest,
When in the World he came,
Tempted in all things like to us,
that he might know our frame.
Think it not strange, though tempt to doubt,
O fie our Adoption,
He tempted was to doubt that he
was not his Fathers Son.
Ye fainting Souls, why do you fear?
or wherefore do you doubt?
Has not the Blood of Jesus ran?
your Sin is blotted out.
Would you have Jesus dye again?
no, he need dye no more
His Blood has cross't out all the Debt
that stood on Justice score.
Why need we grieve the Heart of Christ,
and put him to such pain?
As if there were necessity
for him to bleed again.
O give not place to unbelief,
although we often fall;
For were there need he would bleed again;
but there is none at all.
God sees no Sin to lay on him;
the Law can take no place;
Justice is fully satisfied:
witness his Marred Face.
Honor to him that made us rich,
and made himself so Poor:
Pardon our Sin of unbelief,
and let us doubt no more.
HYMN XLII.
TO us a Child is born,
A son is given free:
Wonderful, Councellor he is,
mighty to save is he.
To testify his Love
our Flesh he puts on:
Born of a Woman Jesus was,
and yet Gods only Son.
He bore the heavy stroke
of Wrath due unto Sin
The Cup of indignation, he
drank off to the brim.
He took our Flesh on him,
that Sympathize he may
In all our Troubles, Sorrows, Wants,
Free Grace he will display.
Was ^ver Love like this!
Jesus should thus provide
Such Streams of Love, and Grace, and make
the Channel in his side!
Behold how he reveals
O Sinner, this to thee!
Thou must believe, accept, receive,
not vie: For Grace is Free
All praise to him above;
the Lamb as't had been slain:
To the Prince of Peace Hosanna's give,
Hosanna's yet again!
HYMN XLIII.
BEhold, my Jesus comes!
I hear his Blessed tone:
He comes apace with all his Grace
to me, his dearest one.
O how I hear his voice!
he calls aloud to me
Behold my bleeding sides, my Love,
behold I died for thee.
I have betroathed thee;
and in these Covenant Bands
I will keep thee: O! Do but see
my bleeding Feet and Hands.
A Royal Robe I wrought
to cover thee with, and
To let thee see I loved thee:
Behold my Feet and Hands.
This Robe will cover all
thy Sins, though as the Sands
In number be; yet do but see
my Bleeding Feet and Hands.
I then did satisfy
my Fathers free demand,
Even for thee, when to the Tree
you nailed my Feet and Hands.
I Love thee still, although
it puts thee to a stand,
How it should be I should love thee,
that pierced my Feet and Hands!
My Father now delights
to see thine Image stand,
So pure and white and dazzling bright
in me at his right Hand.
HYMN XLIV.
CHrist our High Priest is gone
for us now to appear,
With Blood above, that pleads for love;
stand by both Guilt and Fear.
Grace infinitely free
his Blood did loudly tell:
This Streaming Rock the Lord has smote,
does speak loves language well.
Love died is self in Blood,
that Sinners there might see
That Gods Eternal love through Christ,
is infinitely free.
Come Sin and Satan too,
your Threats we do disdain;
And Justice, thou have nothing now
against us: The Lamb is slain.
Thus Grace does mount the Soul;
in Christ it sets it high;
And though in Sin 'thas reeking been,
yet Grace does bring it nigh,
And thus the Soul does teach,
all Sin for to disdain,
Because by Christ it is made a Priest,
and purged from Spot and Stain.
O boundless Love of God!
who would not Grace adore,
That in the Flood of Jesus Blood
our Sin has cov'red over?
O worthy is the Lamb,
that once was slain for me,
Eternally in praises high
adored and praised to be!
HYMN XLV.
WHat Trumpet's this that sounds
such glorious liberty
To Sinners through the Blood of Christ,
and why not then for me?
Jesus died to redeem,
poor Sinners, and set free
The worst of Traitors by his Blood:
And therefore why not me?
Christ died to bring to God
such that at distance be,
The Just for the Injust did dye
And why not then for me?
The Gospel offers Christ
to such that Sinners be,
Yea, free Redemption by his Blood,
why therefore not to me?
God did commend his Love
to such that Sinners be;
Yea, Christ for the ungodly died:
And why not dye for me?
Christ died for none but such;
against God that Rebels be,
And peace by Blood for Sinners made,
and why not peace for me?
There Is righteousness in Christ
most infinitely free,
For needy Sinners which was wrought;
and why not then for me?
And in this Righteousness
sinners Angels outshine:
It covers all their foulest spots,
and why not cover mine?
So that Gods Holy Eye
no Spots in them can see,
This Garment White it shines so bright,
and why not shine on me?
HYMN XLVI.
BEhold my Soul, thy lovely Lord
hang bleeding on the Tree:
O! View my Soul the Heart of Christ
by Justice rent so thee.
O! What stupendous boundless love,
is this that flames so bright,
That Jesus, he should dye for me
that I in Justice sight,
Should in this glorious Godlike Robe
before the Throne appear,
That flaming holiness it self
need not to make me fear.
O cursed unbelief stand by
thou Sulpher^s smoke of Hell,
For in this dress, (Christ's Righteousness)
Justice does like me well.
O lovely Jesus! Take the praise.
who thus adornst thy Bride:
This Righteousness I do possess
does in thy self reside.
O altogether lovely Lord!
what Tongue can silent be?
Thou fairest of ten thousand art;
for none is like to thee.
HYMN XLVII.
WHy do thou hide thy Face?
our Jesus, tell us why:
Did thou not love with such a Love
that Love caused thee to dye?
Thy bleeding sides do tell
loves Stories pleasantly:
Therefore why hidest thou thy Face?
our Jesus, tell us why!
Wer'e Bone now of thy Bone;
to thee we are made so nigh:
Thou hid'st thy self now from thy self:
O therefore tell us why!
My undefiled one,
do thou enquire of me,
Why is it that I so frequently
do hide my Face from thee?
O! It Is my Love to thee
that is always in a flame,
That causes me to hide from thee,
although my Heart's the same.
When from those living streams
from me that run so free
Thou turn'st aside; O then my Bride
I hide my self from thee.
When thou do live upon
my Jewels fair and bright,
And them do take, and Idols make
and set up in my sight;
My love to thee's too great
their emptiness to show;
I turn aside from thee my Bride
that thou may learn to go
Unto the Fountain Head
and drink abundantly,
Unto those red and purple Streams
that have their fourse from me
HYMN XLVIII.
MY Jesus he is all to me,
what ere my Soul can crave:
A fountain free's my Christ to me,
that I no want can have.
My Jesus he is strength to me,
when I do fainting lie:
He Is health in sickness, Life in Death;
in War, he is victory.
In famine, he is Food to me,
in thirst he is Royal Wine;
No want can be attending me
since Jesus he is mine.
My Jesus he is light to me
when I in darkness go:
Such fullness in my Jesus is
that I no want can know.
My Jesus he is liberty
when Bondage does oppress:
Though I in Sin have reeking been
my Christ is Righteousness.
When sorrows compass me about,
my Christ is peace and joy,
When Wrath and Sin do rage within,
my Christ is Victory.
When Satan throws his flaming Dart
my Christ a Hold is strong,
A refuge he is then to me
and my Salvation.
HYMN XLIX.
O What a Fountain of delights
Is Christ the Son of God!
What pleasant Streams this Rock did run,
when smote by Justice Rod!
O Love! eternal Love and Grace!
whose depths we cannot know,
Which we saw run through Gods own Son,
and through his Blood to flow.
We viewed with pleasure and delight
this streaming Rock so free;
We saw the Lord his fellow smite
for us upon the Tree.
O stand amazed, ye Train above!
can this be understood,
That God's eternal Grace and Love
should flow through Jesus Blood?
Did we not in the Wounds of Christ
the Fathers Heart behold?
Has not our dearest Jesus Blood
delightful tidings told?
These wounded Hands and Feet we see
(by Faith) upon the Tree,
Loudly proclaim we are Kings and Priests
unto Eternity.

BOOK III.
HYMN I.
OUR Lord and Head we saw did fall
a Sacrifice for us;
We by his Stripes are healed whilst he
was bruised and wounded thus.
Some for a Friend would, may be, Dye,
But who would for a Foe?
Yet Jesus poured his Soul to Death
for us whilst we were so.
Behold how great this dying Love!
O here was Love indeed!
To manifest such boundless Love
the Son of God must bleed!
How did whips, nails, and thorns tear off
and rend his blessed Flesh!
We in his Ordinance now saw
our bruised Lord afresh.
But O! how was his wounded Soul
by mighty Vengeance rent!
What tortures from his Fathers Hand?
what pangs he underwent?
'Twas Love to Rebels, such as we
made him to undergo
('Tho in himself most innocent;)
such Tortures, Pain, and Woe.
O hearts of Flint, why don't you melt?
bow down our Souls, bow down;
Let such amazing Grace prevail;
O! let it wear the Crown.
Awake, awake, our Souls to love,
to love this Lovely one:
And everlasting praises sing
to him upon the Throne.
HYMN II.
HOw did the glorious Heaven smile
When God to Man was reconciled!
How he his Rebels did devise
should meet him in a Sacrifice!
He on a bruised Jesus swore,
He would be wroth with him no more;
no nor with us that are in Christ
our representing great high Priest.
In Christ's divided parts he meets,
And there with Love eternal greets:
enriches them with Glorious Grace,
and everlasting Arms embrace.
By wondrous Commutations, thus
He caused the Vengeance due to us
fall on his Son, who in our stead
both Satisfied, died and Bled.
His Barbed Arrows struck him through,
Whilst we escape the deadly Blow:
thus he was pleased to bruise his Son,
lest wretched we should be undone.
HYMN III.
HOsanna to the Holy one!
Unto the Lamb upon the Throne!
come let us Hallelujah sing,
unto the great immortal King!
He saved us with his God-like Blood,
He washed us in that purest Flood;
our Conscience bathed has in that bath,
and purged out thence Sin, Hell, and Wrath.
We feed on him, our Flesh and bone;
Thereby embodyed into one;
in him made one with his Father too:
who can this God-like Glory show!
How did the Father take delight
His dearest Son to bruise, and smite,
to free us from the Hellish snare!
O! glorious Love beyond compare!
He now the choicest Wine lets run,
And feeds with us upon his Son:
his Spikenard casts a pleasant Smell;
O! let us in his praises dwell!
We at his Table Drank and Eat;
We fed were with the Finest Wheat:
what choicest Dainiets did he dish!
O! was there ever Love like this!
What Taste in Heaven has this Cheer,
If that it be so pleasant here,
where we shall Drink the newest Wine!
what manner O! of Love is thine!
Hosannahs! Hallelujahs ring!
O beauteous Jesus! Glorious King!
bottomless Love! O boundless Grace!
O Glory! Glory! Glory! Praise.
HYMN IV.
THe Story of eternal Love,
the Spirit told by Bread and Wine;
That boundless, ever-lasting Love
that through a dying Christ did shine.
We do show forth his Death below,
and he shows forth his Death above:
He, to keep flowing down his Grace,
and we to see, rejoice, and Love.
Melchizadeck did Abram meet,
with Bread and Wine, the Kings being slain;
But our Melchizadeck meets us
whilst in the heat of Wars and pain.
This speaks unfathomed Love indeed,
love from eternity begun:
A boundless current in a Round,
that to Eternity will run.
Christ loves and pou'rs his Soul to Death;
the more the Fathers heart does move
To Christ; and Christ does love the more:
O! here is a Glorious Round of Love!
It Is in this Love we are swallowed up,
and shall be swallowed in for aye:
This is the Ocean, Banner, Shade,
this is the bright eternal Day.
This God of Love in Christ, beloved;
this God of Grace we will adore,
We Will praise, and honor, and admire
now and henceforth, forevermore.
HYMN V.
RAvishing Mercy! wondrous Love!
O! come and taste, and see:
O wretched Sinner as I am!
did Jesus die for me!
Eternity will scarce suffice
to admire this great decree:
'Twas from Eternity decreed
that Christ should bleed for me.
What Stories of Eternal Love
Christ's bleeding Sides do tell!
Loves great Epistle he did Write
in lines of Blood so well.
His Mercy, Goodness, Grace and Love
flowed in those purple Streams
To us that so rebellious were:
we seem like those in Dreams!
Ravishing Food! dilicious Wine!
the Flesh and Blood of Christ!
With Joy and Strength we feed upon
the Sacrifice and Priest.
O! Hallelujah, Glory, Power,
and Honor be to Thee;
Thy God and Father, and ours too,
and Spirit Eternally!
HYMN VI.
WE Drunk the Wine, the Fruit of the Vine,
the Vine that is most true;
Hereafter we with Christ shall be,
and then shall Drink it new.
These are the Daintyes of free Grace,
and Love's dilicious Fare;
The Flesh and Blood oth' Son of God:
O Love beyond compare!
His God-like Death for us has wrought
a Garment bright and fair,
In which we are Spotless without fault:
O Love beyond compare!
He comes to reign; Hell is in Pain,
their Teeth the wicked quash;
Our Lord is nigh, and they shall Feel
his Rod and Iron-lash.
But underneath his Shadow, we
shall of his bounty share,
Ravished with Kisses of his Love:
O! what a Feast is there!
Fain would we be at home with thee,
our dearest Jesus, fain;
That in the embraces of thy Love,
we ever might remain.
Love and free Grace, come move apace;
with Love Heart-sick we be:
O Soul-amazing Shining Love!
O! why to such as we!
HYMN VII.
WHat Glorious Sacrifice is this
our Lord and we do feed upon!
O what a Banquet's this of Love,
to feed upon his only Son!
To eat of his most glorious Flesh,
O! this is Heavenly Manna 'ndeed!
To have communion with that Blood
the Son of God for us did Bleed!
United to the Son of Man
with that great God we union have;
Whatever in the name of Christ
we ask, we certainly shall have.
He prays for us, we pray in him,
we rule and triumph in our Head:
Our mutual Animosities
did Bleed to Death with him that Bled.
Then let us melt with our dear Lord,
in the reconciling Sacrifice:
Cast our Rebellious weapons down
at his blessed Feet, if we are wise.
H^sannah to the God of Love!
H^sannah to the highest one!
H^sannah to the Prince of Life,
that sits with power upon the Throne!
HYMN VIII.
Never did the Glory of free Grace
so shine, as in our dying Friend.
When he transgression finished,
and of Sin fully made an end.
Behold, how God the Father loved!
behold how Jesus loved indeed!
It Was Love to us triumph't ore all,
when that the Lamb of God did Bleed.
Our Garments whitened with his Blood,
his Love; how pleasant is the shade!
Thus in the Fountain bathed are we,
and Kings, and Priests to God are made.
O never! never! did high Love
so greatly flow and stream before,
As it flowed from our Jesus Sides,
and streamed forth in his Purple gore.
O! fill us, fill us with thy Loves:
we thirsty are; let us drink our fill:
Let Us quench our thirst in pard'ning Blood
in pard'ning Blood our Lord did spill.
Our dearest! dearest! dearest Friend!
our precious Husband! lovly! sweet!
Let Us hang in thy embraces Lord;
let us wash, and whipe, and kiss thy Feet.
Thou overcomest with thy Love
O! thou do ravish with thy Grace:
Behold, how beautiful and bright's
the glory of thy lovely Face!
O let us admiring always Stand!
O let us adoring prostrate Fall!
O boundless! free! rich! glorious Grace
in Christ! and Christ is all in all.
Eternal Glory, Thanks and Praise
be to our Husband, and our Lord:
Still let us celebrate his Praise,
and glorious Acts with one accord.
HYMN IX
TEll us, O Jesus, do thou Love?
and do thou Love indeed?
Why do we ask? did we not see
thy Love just now to Bleed?
What greater Love than bleeding Love!
O Love most ravishing!
This Song of Love when we are above
we shall forever Sing.
We saw thy Love flow from thy Heart
now in thy Blood that streams;
It was such overcoming Love
we were like those in Dreams.
O! who can tell the Heart of Christ
in all his Glory now,
To his beloved, distressed ones
in midst of Storms below.
Thy heart's the same as er'e it was,
as sull of Love and Grace;
There Is the same pity as er'e was
in thy exalted Face.
Why must we turn away our Eyes?
thine Image we do bear:
O! what does ravish thee? it is
thy Beauty which we wear.
If beams from thee that dart on us
so Sparkling be and bright;
What must the Sun it self be, to
the Darkness of the Night?
Who can behold thy Glory, Lord!
thy glorious Love, who can!
Eternity it self is not
sufficient it to scan.
Flame out our Love with hottest Flames
to our beloved Lord:
Rest under his Loves Shadow, which
surpasses Jonahs Gourd.
The World's a stormy raging-Sea,
let us harbor in his Love;
Thence we shall laugh at storms and waves,
no Tempest shall us move.
Now him that is our safe retreat,
and him that is our Peace
Let Us love and honor, praise, admire,
and let us never cease.
HYMN X.
HOw clean are we, now we are bathed
in Jordans Living Flood!
What shining Kings and Priests we stand
washed in Christ's God-like Blood!
The Lamb i'th'midst o'th'Throne of Grace
us now has freely Fed;
And by his Spirit down has sent
from Heaven the living Bread.
The living Streams o'th'upper Springs
he freely did bestow:
We of the Fountain freely Drank
that from his Heart did flow.
He bids us Drunken be with Loves,
with Loves so bottomless;
With Loves that stream so freely down,
(the Ocean not the less.)
The Lovely Jesus is all Love,
all Mercy, Truth, all Grace;
He Is white and ruddy: Majesty
and Meekness fills his Face.
Sing Hallelujahs to the Lamb!
the Lamb most pure and bright:
Whose voice does thunder from the Throne
whose Eyes are flaming Light.
Let Us Love, admire, adore, embrace
this Lovely one so fair;
Whose Grace and Person all transcends,
and are beyond compare.
HYMN XI.
BEhold our well-beloved's come,
more excellent than mounts of prey;
Over mighty Hills of Unbelief,
and guilt of Sin, he paved his way.
He like the Roe has nimbly trip't
to show to us his glorious Face;
And through the Lettice of his Flesh
darts down on us his Fathers Grace.
Hark! hark! how our beloved speaks,
what ravishing! what melting Voice!
He says, Rise up my Love, my fair,
mine and my Fathers only choice.
Rise up my fairest, come away,
rise, follow me, Dove, without fear;
The Dark distressing Winter's over,
the pleasant Spring does now appear.
The Birds do sing, my Children ring
most joyous peals of my free Grace;
The Flowers appear, their Graces are
most shining bright each in its place.
The Turtles Voice is in our Land;
the des late Gospel does break forth
To singing in the midst of you,
and causes many a heavenly Birth.
The Fig Tree puts forth green Figs,
for numerous your converts are;
Your tender Grapes give a good smell;
your Converts Grace is choice and rare.
Lord what are we, thy Love, thy fair?
such filthy wretched ones as we?
O Love! O Love! O wondrous Grace!
come! we will arise and follow thee.
Great things thine Arm has done among us,
such Love and Favor did thou show,
Who would not rise and follow thee?
such Mighty Cords of Love do draw.
Now to our well bel^ved Lord,
let us Sing a well tuned Song of praise:
Glory and Honor let us ascribe,
O let us ascribe to him always.
HYMN XII.
O Choicest Banquet! rarest Wine!
O Soul-reviving Blood!
O Table well spread with Heavenly Bread!
O delicatest Food!
What glorious company was here!
the Fa^er, Spirit, Son,
And a great Troop of shining ones
embodyed into one.
O grace! free grace! rich glorious grace!
foundation and topstone
In great Redemption's Building, and
it is cementing alone.
O Mercy, Goodness, Peace dish't up!
O glorious Bill of fare!
O Love, the Garnishing of all!
O Love beyond compare!
Who would not love the King of Saints?
who would not love the Lord?
Thy Person is all beautiful;
how Honey-sweet thy word!
Who would not praise thee Zions King,
and trumpet forth thy Fame!
Who art with richest Glory 'ray'd,
how well perfumed thy Name!
Still Honor Glory and Renown
be given unto thee:
Hosannah's! Hallelujahs! Sing
to all Eternity.
HYMN XIII.
DEar Lord, we in thy comlyness,
like Sharons Rose, do smell and bud,
And like the Lilies of the Vale,
appear most beautiful and good.
Hark! Hark! what our dear Lord replies,
as Lilies shoot up among Thorns,
So does my Love, my Church, my Spouse
in spite of false Professors harms.
Those that themselves my Daughters all,
like prickly Thorns would stab thee through;
Yet midst those thorny Daughters thou
shall like the Valley Lily grow.
Thanks, dearest Jesus; are we then
in the midst of Thorns, thy fair, thy Dove?
How art thou like the Apple Tree,
the Glory of the shady Grove?
As pleasant Pipins among Crabs,
so among the Sons is our beloved;
Fairer than all the Sons of Men,
the perfect Captain well approved.
We thy refreshing Shadow had,
thy loving Righteousness, and Love;
We shall with constant joys be filled,
if here we fit and never move.
And here we eat thy pleasant Fruits,
thy pleasant Fruits of Righteousness:
How pleasant to our taste are these!
Assurance, Peace, and Quietness.
Pleased with the goodness of these Fruits,
Let us our Donor praise and bless;
Our dearest Husband, Lord and Head,
Jehovah our great Righteousness.
HYMN XIV.
O Love! O boundless Love of God!
stupendous Love and Grace!
We in a bleeding Jesus saw,
we saw in Jesus Face.
The King of Glory has been here
revealing Mighty Love,
In Conscience Banquets feasting with
his undefiled Dove.
Hark in what tendrest Speech of Love
he does his Heart bewray!
My Love, my Dove, my undefiled,
make have and come away.
The Winter's past, the Rain is gone,
the Flowers do appear;
The time is come for Birds to Sing,
the Turtle you may hear.
The Fig Tree Glories in green Figs,
in tender Grapes the Vine;
Arise my Love, my fair one, come
and drink my Spiced Wine.
I am into my Garden come
my Sister, and my Bride;
I Have brought my Honey, Myrrh and Spice
my Milk and Wine beside.
Come eat, O Friends, yea welcome, to
these daintyes from above;
Beloved drink abundantly,
come drink large draughts of Love.
Open to me my Love, my Dove,
my Sister undefiled;
My Locks with fruitful drops of the Night
my Head with Dew is filled.
Let us be wise, and now arise;
what language Lord is this!
In words so ravishing do thou
thy self to us express?
O let us arise and follow thee,
lest thou withdraw'st again;
And we thy absence several Years
mourn and deplore in vain.
HYMN XV.
They Are Songs of Love they sing above,
and why not we like them?
No Tongue be dumb: for we are come
to the new Jerusalem:
Clad now with white and shining bright
garments of Righteousness;
Girdles of Gold our Loins do hold,
and bind on fast our Dress.
We stand upon that Ocean,
that glassy fiery Sea;
The Blood of Christ, that great high Priest
the Spirit does apply.
Let Us touch the golden Harps of God
with Wire immortal strung;
And let us sing to our great King,
let us sing the Lambs new Song.
Thanks be to thee, the Victory
we have obtained over Sin;
And Father, thou have made us more
than Conquerours in him.
This Crucified Lord let us praise,
and magnify his worth;
This blessed Root of Jesse's Stem,
his Glory let us set forth.
Immortal Honor, Wisdom, Strength,
unto the Lamb are due;
This bleeding Lamb, this reigning Lord,
this Holy, Righteous true.
This Heavenly Manna's to our taste
like Cakes of Honey sweet:
How Pleasant is this streaming Rock
which still our Paths does meet!
Come Jesus move, we are sick of Love;
why stay thy Chariot wheels?
We pine away while thou do stay,
our Souls thy absence feel.
Thy Mouth's sweet Kiss let us not miss,
thy love transcends all Wine;
But O! what Music do we hear
when thou say I am thine!
Still let us have more, still more of thee;
we never enough can have:
Our jealousy's as strong as Death,
as cruel as the Grave.
Dominion, Power, and Majesty,
Thanksgiving, Glory, Praise,
In endless Songs, angelick Strains,
and never ceasing Lays,
Be unto him that Loved us,
and washed us with his Blood,
And made us Kings and Priests unto
his Father and our God.
HYMN XVI.
Who Is this that does from Eilom come
with Garments dyed Red,
With Scarlet Robes from Bozrah, he
O how apparelled!
That Travels in his Mighty strength?
what answer O he gave!
It Is I that speak in Righteousness,
and Mighty am to save.
Why's thy Apparel colored so,
thy Garments dyed Red,
Like them that on the Vintage work,
or do the Wine fat tread?
The Wine Press of his Fathers wrath
he all alone has trod;
Oth' People there was none with him
when he was smote of God
Awake O brandish't Sword of God
against my only Son,
Though Spotless he and Innocent
no violence has done.
He Is as a Lamb to'th' slaughter led,
yea as a shearing Sheep
He quietly yields up his Breath,
and still does silence keep.
He freely did to Death submit,
and did most willingly
Pains, Tortures, Lashes, Stripes endure,
for Rebels such as we.
HYMN XVII.
IMmortal Honor, Glory, Power,
Strength, Wisdom, Riches, Might,
Be to the reigning Lamb above,
that dwells in brightest Light.
To him that washed us in his Blood,
who having loved us first;
To him that was made sin for us,
and was for us accursed.
Who feeds us with his God like flesh
and drinks us with his Blood;
Uniting Faith most choicely feeds,
and drinks the Wine that is good.
Who would not love the dearest Lord,
most Lovely, Bright, and Fair?
Thy love to us all love transcends;
thou art beyond compare.
How pleasant was this Fruit to us,
and language full of Grace!
Delightful was the company:
how lovely was his Face!
O well beloved Jesus, filled
with Glory, Grace, and Truth;
All Grace is poured upon thy Lips:
thou have the Dew of Youth.
O when shall we come unto thee,
home to our Fathers House;
Where thou wilt refine the choicest Wine
for thy beloved Spouse.
Who would not Honor, and admire?
who would not thee adore?
Who would not throw their Crown below
down prostrate thee before?
Have sweetest Jesus, have away,
thy rightful Throne ascend,
Possess thy Nations, fill thy Church
with Glory without end.
HYMN XVIII.
BEhold the bleeding Lord of Life,
planted with Arrows like a Grove;
Planted with Darts of Vengeance thus:
O Friends, what manner then of Love!
Wounded by his dear Fathers Sword;
betrayed most falsely with a Kiss;
By Kindsmen, followers murdered thus;
what manner, O! of Love is this!
Behold the bloody Clodders fall;
his pierced Sides, and Temples bleed:
For Sinners thus he is drench't in's Blood:
and is not this then Love indeed!
Behold the anguish of his Soul;
thy Sword O Justice stabs him through:
For us, vile Rebels, this he bore;
how did our Jesus love! O how!
To torments thus resigns his Soul:
our Husband dearly purchases
A filthy, and a wretched Bride;
what manner, O! of Love was this!
To dye for worst of enemies;
O! this was an amazing Friend!
What manner Lord of love was thine!
how did thou boundless Love commend!
The Father bruised his darling Son,
and took delight to wound him sore:
Our Fathers love unto us shone
through the slain Jesus purple Gore.
His Sorrows, Anguish, Blood, and Death,
electing Grace did cause to shine:
What, bruise for us thy darling Son!
what manner, O! of Love was thine!
O here is Love! here is Love indeed!
eternal, and electing Love:
A Love that does no limits know,
that never changes, never moves.
What e're we do, this boundless Love
runs an eternal Stream of bliss;
The Floods of Sin this Love cannot quench:
what manner, O! of Love is this!
This Love the greatest torments bore;
this Love did groan, this Love did Bleed;
Our Lover thus wept bloody Tears:
behold how Jesus loved indeed!
HYMN XIX.
God from eternity decreed,
to feast in Love with us this Night,
To feed with us now on his Son,
and Father, so thou tookst delight.
And did thou set him then apart
to be the Victim of our peace?
Swearing on him by thy great self,
thy Love to us should never cease?
Then our dear Jesus swore for us,
we never rebel should as a'fore;
And that recov'red was, should never
deface his Glory any the more.
All his Engagements and his Bonds
were sealed by his dying Breath:
Our Peace and Life are ratified
unalterable in his Death.
We now renew our League with thee,
clasp't in thy reconciled Arms:
We in our bleeding Jesus saw
thy Love, and Mercy's potent charms.
How Fat the feast! how rich the Wine!
how pleasant was the Company!
We fed on Christ, we drank his Blood,
whilst with us sat the glorious three.
Adored Goodness! ravished Love!
in Streams of Love let us dip us then;
The Fountains of the mighty Deeps
break up and deluge over ag'en.
To Heaven our Faith was mounted up;
we are impatient of delay:
Thy coming hasten Lord to us,
or let us have to thee away.
Why does thy Chariot, ( paved with Grace,
and Love) so soft, so slowly move?
Mean while with Flagons comfort us:
dear Jesus, we are sick of Love.
HYMN XX.
SIng Hallelujahs! to the Lamb
that reigns for evermore;
Who made us spotless by his Blood,
and very bright all over.
Our Tongues be then the Spirits Pen,
that readily may write:
To sound aloud the Lambs high praise,
the Spirit will indite.
What an immortal melody
fills the high Heavens now!
Join in Seraphick Symphony
you in this Room below:
Distinguishing, and endless Love,
is the great Song above;
And let us then that are below
sing stories of his Love.
The Lord of Heaven Heaven left,
Grace boundless to declare;
His Fathers Bosom left to tell
what thoughts of Love there are.
Why came thou down to dwell in Flesh?
tell dearest Jesus, pray;
Was It to impart thy Fathers Heart
to wretched lumps of Clay?
Why was it thou poor? a Man of grief,
that heavy Vengeance bore?
Why was it thou smitten thus and bruised?
why wast thou wounded sore?
Why in such bitter agony?
why bloody clodders fall?
Why did thou drink the Cup of Wrath,
and drink up Dregs and all?
Hark, what our bleeding Lord replies,
hark what his Wounds reply,
This was to testify my Love
from all Eternity.
My Fathers Love does shine in mine;
my Groans his Love indite;
Eternal, and electing Love
my Streaming Blood does write.
Electing Grace my dying Breast
did very loudly preach:
The Fathers, Sons, and Spirits Love
thus Jesus Death did teach.
Our bleeding Lord, was it thus then?
let us view thy bleeding Sides:
Here Is Love indeed! flow up our Love
like overflowing Tides.
Our Jesus now you are glorified;
but is thy Love the same?
Yes, says he, toward you it burns
now with as high a Flame.
Sing Hall elujahs! praise, adore,
bless: All he does above
Is for us Sinners; and all ore
high Offices of Love.
HYMN XXI.
NOw underneath thy Shadow, we
sat down with great delight:
How pleasant was the taste of thee!
how lovely was the sight!
We cannot brook thy absence Lord,
but we are sick of Love;
Embrace thou always in thy Arms
thy Sister, Spouse, and Dove.
That we no more may hunger, give
us of this Bread to eat;
And no more thirst, give of this Drink
so cherishing, so sweet.
Lord, mount our Faith, we may embrace
thee in thy bruised Son;
And in thy Bosom lie, who is
with thee O Father, one.
O let us Sing mount Zion's Song
sing Hallelujahs! Sing
(Who now with us at Table sits)
to the great immortal King;
Head over all Jehovah, high
the Prince of Peace, the Son,
The reigning Lamb by whose Blood, we
do fight and overcome.
HYMN XXII.
O! never was a Face so marred,
as that of our dear Lord!
When Justice turned aside from us,
and in him sheathed his Sword.
Why thus rejected, and despised?
why thus afflicted sore?
He underneath our sorrows groaned
it was our griefs he bore.
Why without form, and comeliness,
or beauty to be seen?
It was for us, that Vengeance made
those Wounds with Arrows keen.
Why did he grieve? why did he groan?
Pour forth such Tears, and Cries?
The maul of Justice bruised him sore
for our Iniquities.
And was he then for us chastised
that we might Peace procure;
And was his bloody, gashly Stripes
our healing and our cure?
What manner then of Love was this!
yea what transcendent Love!
Still he loves such, yea still as much
now that he reigns above.
And did the Father take our sin
and charge it all on him?
And was the Father greatly pleased
to bruise him for our sin?
What manner then of Love was this
the Father had for us,
When for such filthy Dust as we
he Wounds his darling thus!
For ever be the Father praised!
Hosanna's to the Son!
Yea Hallelujahs to the Lamb!
the holy righteous one.
HYMN XXIII.
CHrist is the precious Treasury,
where Grace is laid in store,
More fully to be handed out
unto the Blind and Poor.
The mighty distance sin had caused
between our Lord and us,
Is by this dying Sacrifice
our Christ abolished thus.
The distance 'tween the Eternal God
and finite clods of Clay,
God is come down to dwell in Flesh,
to do in part away.
All Homage now is paid to God,
in Jesus Christ our head;
All that we want is stored in him:
he is the living Bread.
He is the living Waters sent;
who ever drinks of him,
As he is cleans'd and washed from sin,
so never thirsts again.
O! do you want eternal Grace?
one in your nature has't;
Go to your Brother Joseph's House,
his pleasant Dainties taste.
Nay, eat beloved, eat; O drink,
and drink abundantly,
This is our glorious Masters call,
this our Beloved's cry.
HYMN XXIV.
THou worthy, O Jehovah, art
Power, Glory, Honor, to receive
It was thy pleasure thus to love,
and thus to make us to believe.
O bleeding Lamb upon the Throne!
our Feast and Sacrifice this night;
Awful like many Waters noise
like burning Brass, most shining bright.
It Is thine to open the sealed Book,
and reign ore Death, ore Hell, ore Sin:
Open thou our Conscience chained Doors,
and King of Glory enter in.
For thou was it slain, and have redeemed
us by thy Death and precious Blood,
From among Kindreds, Nations, Tongues,
and made us People to our God.
Lord by redeeming thou have made
us spotless Kings and Priests to him;
And having washed us in his Blood,
our God in us will see no sin.
We Kings and Priests in the royal Robe
of Christ's bright righteousness set forth,
Shall reign with Christ ath' Judgment Day,
and reign e're long with him on Earth.
Worthy's the Lamb that has been slain,
and now does sit upon the Throne
Of Glory, Blessing, Honor, Power
Wisdom and strength to him alone.
HYMN XXV.
I Underneath his shadow sat
with pleasure and delight:
His Fruit unto my taste was sweet
and fair unto my sight.
I looked and tasted with delight;
I manna fed upon:
My Meat and Drink it was the Flesh
and Blood oth' Fathers Son.
I looked and viewed by Faith, until
my Soul was sick of Love:
Love's banner he continually
displayed my Head above.
I viewed by Faith those stretched out Arms
that nailed were to the Tree,
Stand open wide for me his Bride,
though a vile wretch I be.
I viewed a Cup of Vengeance, in
my dearest Jesus Hand:
There did I spy most pleasantly
that he at Gods Command,
Most freely drank the bitter Cup
my sin prepared for him;
That I might have a Cup prepared
top full of Grace to the brim.
O then my Soul! swim in those depths
of Love, that rise so high;
That Sin and Death and Hell cannot stop
it is Stream eternally.
These following Hymns were found in Mr. Browning's Study, and used by him at
the Lord's Table.
Note that at the end of every Hymn these two Verses may be added.

Hosanna to King David's Son!
Hosanna to the Christ!
Who in the Almighty's name does come,
Hosanna in the highest!
To him that thus has loved us,
and canceled out our score
In the pure Flood of his own Blood;
be praise for evermore.
HYMN XXVI.
THe Heavens show forth, O Lord, thy Praise
and shall we silent be?
Discharge us of the Earth, and raise
our Souls in Songs to the.
The cheary Angels sweetly sing,
their Trumpets always sound:
Let us make Heaven and Earth to ring;
we stand on higher Ground.
Our Woe did by our fall begin,
we in our Blood did lie;
Grace took advantage by our Sin
it self to Glorify.
In crooked ways (when we were lost,
by Sin, when we were slain)
Love spared no pains to seek; nor cost
to make us love again.
From Heaven like Worms we crept away,
Christ found us in his Grave;
Next to his Heart he did us lay,
and dying did us save.
Our Tongues thy Trumpets are, and we
would serve thee all our Days:
Give us that Heart, whose Pulse may be,
thy quick and constant praise.
Hosanna to King -- etc.
HYMN XXVII.
BUt that our Flesh is turned to Stone,
but that we scarce can see;
Our hearts would melt O Lord and groan
that we should senseless be.
The Suns approach does, as we see,
still make the Earth more brave:
What Barren Hearts O Lord have we!
yet hotter Beams we have.
He that does find a Silver-Vein
rejoices in that Toy:
Thou have us blessed with greater Gain,
oh! fill our Hearts with Joy.
There Is no such thing as Love in Men,
comparing theirs with thine:
Christ drank to us in Blood, and then
bad us pledge him in Wine.
He did forsake his Fathers Throne,
that he might glory give:
He did assume our Flesh and Bone;
he dies that we might live,
He left his Joy to feel our smart;
his ruin did us raise:
This Love O Lord, does break our Hearts,
oh! let it mend our Praise.
Hosanna to King -- etc.
HYMN XXVIII.
COme, come, and see! fallen Man is up,
dead Lazarus is raised,
And does with his dear Savior sup:
his Power and Love be Praised.
May Servants thus with their Lord sit
as if they were his Mates;
Yea, this our Master does permit;
nay more: mean while he waits.
But Laz'rus he his Friend did call,
we Traitors to him were;
Nor could we rise without his fall:
what matchless Love is here!
We gasping lay for want of Breath,
and help we could not crave:
He was content to taste of Death
that we his Life might have.
The Scripture says, this Holy one
might not Corruption see:
But yet he may be fed upon
by such poor Worms as we.
Thou giv'st us leave to eat, and rest;
let us also walk with thee:
Thou Lord do carve us of thy best,
and wholly thine are we.
Hosanna to King -- etc.
HYMN XXIX.
LIft up your Voice, let Trumpets sound,
let Saints on Earth sing Praise:
Could we but Till, here is fruitful Ground
whence we that Rent might raise.
The glorious Sun begins to 'rise,
and on our Face to shine;
Let Clouds disperse, lets wipe our Eyes,
our Joy is Gods design.
Peace, guilty Conscience, prate no more:
we were in debt, it is true,
But Christ our Lord has paid our Score:
Love only now is due.
Cheer up sad Hearts, look not so ill;
some kind of Tears defile:
Christ shed his Blood our Veins to fill;
sanguine Complexion smile.
Praise does become Saints here below,
as well as them above;
Thy Praise with us shall Heav'nward grow,
only cheer up thy Love.
It Is Mercy we can call thee ours,
that does prevent despair:
Do but thou say, yea I am yours,
and then in Heaven we are.
Hosanna to King -- etc.
HYMN XXX.
ROuse up dull Hearts, awake and sing,
it is Day; how can you sleep?
The Sun's approach makes Joy to Spring;
it is clear; how can you weep?
Each pretty Bird can pleasant be,
yet is their Portion small:
Oh! what unthankful Hearts have we!
that droop, and yet have all.
With Man, one Cord of Love does bind,
one courteous Act does gain:
How can we but his Praises sing?
when Love our way makes plain.
As if we were some rich Gold-ring
dropped from the Fathers Hand:
Christ stooping, fell, us back to bring,
by him we rose, we stand.
Our Lord exalted is on high,
in him we comfort have:
Wherewith to wipe our weeping Eye,
he lest Clothes in his Grave.
Well may we be at his command,
and Presents to him bring:
Lord cheer and tune us with thy Hand,
so shall we work, and sing.
Hosanna to King -- etc.
HYMN XXXI.
WHere are those blessed united ones
that have sup't with their King?
Spoil not his Feast with sighs and groans,
lift up your Voice; lets sing.
Or let us only mourn, that we
our Comforter should grieve,
Who poured forth his Blood, that he
therewith might us relieve.
Let Us weep that we for every Toy
should thus like Children cry;
Or rather let us weep for Joy
that Grace does wipe our Eye.
Those that can see their Father smile,
may laugh, though others frown:
If Heaven be ours, let Earth seem vile,
it is all not worth a Crown.
Why should we fear though Mountains shake,
though Seas lift up their Voice?
While some fall down, while others quake,
in God let us rejoice.
What cause have we to bless thy Name!
oh! that we could give praise:
Then shall we Lord lift up the same
when thou our Heart shall raise.
Hosanna to King -- etc.
HYMN XXXII.
IF with some Earthly Prince to sit
be such a glorious thing:
Oh! how great Dignity is it
to Feast with Heavens King!
Our Fathers House has Bread enough,
his Board is richly spread;
To whose Provision that is poor stuff
whereon we sometimes fed.
The smallest Crumb we cannot earn,
as due we cannot claim;
Yet are we full, could we but learn
to praise his Holy Name.
The Daintyes which thou do afford,
we nowhere else can see:
Here shall we therefore choose to board.
here shall our dwelling be.
And if a Glance so cheer the Heart,
what will a full view do?
Whilst under Age we have but part
of what we are born too.
We trust we shall have more at last,
for which we wait, and crave;
Mean while we bless thee for that Taste
which now through Grace we have.
Hosanna to King -- etc.
HYMN XXXIII.
THy Peoples praise, great God of Love
well may it wait for thee,
For thou do wait still from above
that thou might gracious be.
The greater sort do thou forget
but we rememb'red are;
Whilst others are without, we sit
under thy tender care.
Not unto us, dear Lord, ah! No
not unto us, but thee:
From all this Grace let Glory grow,
thy Name exalted be.
What poor provoking Dust are we?
but yet not swept away:
What place for such too low can be?
yet Grace has guilt our Clay.
Our help did in thy Bosom lie,
from whence, to show thy Grace,
Thy Son our Lord must come to dye,
that we might have his place.
Fain would we come dear God to thee;
oh! let thy Hand us raise;
Then shall we all thy Trumpets be
to thine Eternal praise.
Hosanna to King -- etc.
HYMN XXXIV.
WHat bounty, Lord? what matchless Love
have thou to us made known!
What costly Pearls dropped from above,
and from thy Hand alone?
Thou have redeemed us from that Grave
wherein we rotting lay:
These naked Souls, how fine! how brave
they are since the other Day!
Whence are those glorious Crowns, those Rings?
which to our share do fall:
Can Beggars Brats deserve such things?
no sure! Grace gave them all.
Where had we been? what had we done
if left to Natures Light?
We might have worshipped the Sun,
dear God! thou know we might.
But thou a brighter Sun have sent,
which in our Hearts does shine;
Whose Light us to thy self has sent,
and all whose Beams are thine.
Oh! let it more and more increase
until its course be run,
Until our glim'ring Light shall cease,
and we dwell in the Sun.
Hosanna to King -- etc.
HYMN XXXV.
It Is Angels work to bless and sing,
it is not the Saints alone:
When they shall sit each like a King,
praise will become their Throne.
But what poor Instruments are we,
all-out of Tune, unstrung?
Unless he our Musician be
who can give Dust a Tongue.
The Nature of this work is such
that while we sing we groan;
Because we foul what er'e we touch;
ours is a doleful tone.
But he that has Composed our Song,
can put our Hearts in Tune:
Though we be weak, yet he is strong;
here let thy strength be shown!
How falsely have we dealt with thee!
yet thou do trust us still:
Fain would we henceforth faithful be
according to thy Will.
Thy Grace does aggravate our sin,
oh! might it kill the same;
Then shall we Angel-like begin
to praise thy Glorious Name.
Hosanna to King -- etc.
HYMN XXXVI.
WHat Daintyes does our Lord prepare?
what Guests does he invite?
May Worms divide such curious Fare?
doubtless it is not their Right.
Poor Beggars are not served in state,
their posture is to stand;
Their proper place is at the Gate,
Crusts only fit their Hand.
How comes it then to pass that we,
that we are bid draw near,
That we are bid sit down by thee
and welcome to such Cheer?
Ah! not because we are not poor
have we this favor found;
But mercy is with thee in store:
that only is the Ground.
Oh! blessed be the Lord of Love
who ask't not what we were,
But bad his only Son remove
that so we might draw near.
Since thou have made our Souls a Feast,
oh! make us thankful too;
And whilst some others praise in jest
let us both say and do.
Hosanna to King -- etc.
HYMN XXXVII.
THat glorious Grace, that Grace of Love,
that Grace of Love divine,
How clearly does it from above
upon our Faces shine?
Love was at work before we were
five Thousand Years or more:
Time only makes those things appear
that Love has wrought before.
Like silly Sheep we wandering went,
we went we know not where;
Love cried as we to Hell were bent,
this is the way, walk here.
In a short Time and for poor Crumbs
we all our Portion spent;
Love freely gave far greater Sums
than what before were lent.
Our only danger is from sin,
thence comes the greatest harm:
But Love has safely Hedged us in
with it is i^ closing Arm.
How can we now but with him walk,
when Love has paved our way?
Oh! let us not spend our Time in Talk,
let us run, let us make no stay.
Hosanna to King -- etc.
HYMN XXXVIII.
What shall we say, dear God! to thee!
how shall we praise thy Name?
Fain would we somewhat thankful be,
silence will speak our shame.
But can we by a word or two,
think to express thy praise?
Words are poor things, what shall we do*
Tongues talk, but practice pays.
And yet alas! what can we do?
what should our Present be?
Thou art so high, and we so low,
how can these Hands reach thee?
But though our Crowns can never reach
nor fit thy Glorious Head,
Yet at thy Feast thou do us teach,
our Robes of praise to spread.
And though thy Rent we cannot make
'till thou shall bless our store;
Yet Lord we pray thee stoop and take
this mite 'till we have more.
The Grace of Christ whereon we stand
does some Advantage give:
Do thou but lend thy raising Hand,
we then with thee shall live.
Hosanna to King -- etc.
HYMN XXXIX.
WHence comes it that this Bread and Wine
such Soul refreshing yield?
This Springs not from the common Vine
nor grows in every Field.
It Is curious Fare, this Childrens Bread
it is both Bread and Meat,
Whereby we are both Taught and Fed,
which we may safely eat.
It breeds no Worms nor shall they dye
who truly eat this Bread:
The Feeder is Transformed thereby,
and no bad Humor Fed.
It Is no intoxicating Cup
that is put in our Hand;
Which if we could but drink it up
would all our Cares disband.
O blessed be that gracious Hand
that holds and fills the same!
And gladly would we see that Land
from whence this Bread first came.
Thou Lord, who art the God of Peace,
who art our strength and stay,
Let Comfort by thy means increase
and let the Flesh decay.
Hosanna to King David's Son!
Hosanna to the Christ!
Who in the Almighty's name does come,
Hosanna in the highest!
To him that thus has loved us,
and canceled out our score
In the pure Flood of his own Blood;
be praise for evermore.
AMEN.
