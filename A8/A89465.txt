shop at the sign of the Glove and Lion, near the Royall-Exchange. 1642.

The Earl of Manchester his SPEECH.
MY Lord Mayor, and Gentlemen, you of the City of London,
I am commanded to come hither upon an Errand, that I know in the general is
never pleasing, which is to express wants and necessities; but I know very
well to whom I speak, it is to the Worthy, the Generous, and the Royal
CITIZENS of London, who have exceeded all Story in their care, for the life and
preservation both of the Parliament and the whole Kingdom: Therefore it would
imply a distrust of your present care, to make a Supply, if I should use any
Arguments to you; I shall only say this, that if there be not an enlargement
of your selves in some measure at the present, I shall be very unwilling to
express the condition that I fear our Army will be reduced to: This is all
that I shall say, that if there be a present Supply, I do not doubt but the
Army will move with that effect, as it will prevent all those barbarous and
salvage plunderings of the Forces that are now under the Command of those
Officers of the King. I confess the burden has lain very heavy only upon
the City of London, and you shall have the grace, and the honor of the
preservation, both of Religion, and the Laws and Liberties of this Kingdom.
This Gentleman that is by me, will let you know that it is already in
Proposition, (and I do not doubt but it will speedily have the concurrence of
the Lords with it) to take that care, that the future burden shall not lie
upon those here in the City of London, that have been careful to make
Supplies, even to the exhausting of themselves; but that it shall go generally
to all those that have shrouded themselves under a kind of Neutrality here in
London; and that it shall go generally throughout all the Countries of England,
that so the common Calamities shall be prevented, and supported by the common
burden laid upon the whole Kingdom.

Master John Pym HIS SPEECH.
GEntlemen,
we come not to tell your Lordship and these worthy Citizens only our wants
and dangers; but we come to speak the thanks of the Parliament to you, for
that that you have alre^dy done, that you have showed so much affection to the
public, and that it has produced so good effects throughout the whole
Kingdom, as that now you have an Army raised most out of this City, able to
defend (with Gods blessing) the Religion and Liberty of the Kingdom, if it may
be upheld: and we come not only to give you thanks for that that you have
done, but to stir you up to join with us in giving thanks to God, that has
given such a blessing to our endeavors, that when by Letters into all parts
almost they did presume before hand to triumph in the ruin, and in the
plundering of this City, God prevented it, and has kept you safe, kept your
Houses, your Walls, your Suburbs safe from that that was intended against you;
and truly as we have sought for this blessing by fasting and by prayer, so it
is fit that we should testify our thanksgiving for it, and this is a necessary
part of our errand which we are sent about: and that we may be serviceable to
Gods providence still, as he has stirred up your hearts to do so much already,
so that he would stir you up still to continue that that is fit to be done
for the future, and that you will do it in such a way as may be most pleasing
to your selves: we come not hither, that by any consent here in public, you
should bind your selves in particular; but we come to let you know the dangers
of the Kingdom, the sense the Parliament has of it, and of the City
especially, that you may not lose that that has bin already done; but that you
may go on still cheerfully to do the full work; And we come to tell you that
the Parliament does intend the burden shall not lie upon you that are
well-affected and come in voluntarily; but that they have thought upon a way,
and have begun it already, and I hope within two or three days at the most it
shall be published to you; that all that are indisposed shall be forced to do
that, which out of readiness and cheerfulness to the public good they will
not do of themselves; neither limit it we to the City and Suburbs; but we are
in a course to draw in all the Countries of the Kingdom, that as the burden is
universal, so the aid may be universal; for this is the thoughts of the
Parliament. And if it please God to bless your Forces that are already raised,
and continued, we hope you shall not only see peace again in the Kingdom,
and security for your Religion; but see those that have been the engines and
actors of the mischiefs and troubles that are come upon us, the burden shall
lie upon them, that they shall recompense the charges you have been at already:
This is the intention of the Parliament, only for the present do somewhat
every man, as GOD shall enable him, do somewhat that may meet the present
necessities, and prevent the dangers that require a present subsistence, and
present supply of the Army, without which, what is it will follow but the
danger of the City; the ruin of the Countries about, the stopping up of the
River which is almost taken from you, and the Seacoasts will be lost; you
cannot have better hearts then you have, God has enabled many of you with
purses, I hope it will be so readily disposed that we shall have a full joy in
the recompense of it, and the retribution; which we shall all pray God to bring
to pass, and I hope you will bring to pass.

FINIS.
