Second Strain.
^TRY all the Loy -- al, de -- fie all, give de -- ni -- al;
^sure none thinks the Glass too big here, nor a -- ny Prig here, or sneaking
Whig here,
^of Cripple Tony's Crew, that now looks blew, his Heart aches too, the Tap
will not do, his Zeal so true, and Projects new, ill Fate does now pursue.
Third Strain.
^LET Tories guard the King, let Whigs in Halters swing;
^ let Pilk -- and Sh -- be shamed, let bugg'ring O -- be damned;
^let cheating Pl -- be nicked, the turncoat Scribe be kicked;
^let Re -- bell Ci -- ty Dons ne -- ver be -- get their Sons;
^let ev' -- ry Whiggish Peer that Rapes a La -- die fair, and leaves his on --
ly Dear the Sheets to gnaw and tear, be (...) Land t'attone the grand Affair.
Fourth Strain.
^GReat Charles, like Je -- ho -- vah, spares Foes would unking him, and warms

be wise and re -- bell.
