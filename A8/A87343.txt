An Impartial RELATION OF THE Seizing and Apprehending Several High-Way-Men, In
Fleet Street, etc. on Friday the Second of this Instant March, 1694.
With an Account of the Manner of their Apprehension, their Names, Trades, late
Places of Abode, and their Commitment to Newgate.
Licensed according to Order.

3. March 1693/4.


COnsidering the many Robberies committed on the Road, it is not at all to be
wondered at, that so many Highway-men are taken and every Sessions Condemned to
condign Punishment. Upon Ware-Road (for this Twelvemonth) there has been great
Robbing, many Passengers deprived of great Booties; no Inns having any
Remarkable Intelligence, suffitient to make any Observation, or to take any
Cognizance of them, as they past the Roads, till a Country Gentleman's Servant,
seeing his Master Robbed of a considerable Prize, (being overpowered by
number) happened, some few Days after, (as he was Journying to London, upon his
Masters Occasions) to overtake these same Highway-Men; and Remembering their
Faces, began and continued a familiar Conversation with them upon the Road,
till they came to London, the fittest Place for the Apprehending of unlawful
Livers, whose Resolutions are generally desperate.

He being willing to wait a convenient Opportunity, for the Seizing his former
Adversaries, Dogged two to Temple Bar, where he took them with a Constable; and,
after great Resistance, carried them before a Magistrate, who Committed them to
Newgate, attended with great Crowds of People. The one, whose Name is Glover,
being a Plumber in Fetter-Lane: the other his Man, whose Name is Terram.

These two after they were taken into Custody (desirous of the Company of their
third Associate) confessed his Name to be Bowel, and that he Lodged in
Blackfriars, where he was immediately taken, by Persons dispatched in order
for his Apprehension; who accordingly was committed to Newgate.
