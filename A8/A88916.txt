The Masterpiece of Roundheads, or an Explanation and Declaration of the right
Roundheads in deed, And such as are and shall be the true Roundheads by all
consent and Act of Parliament.
Written by a well-wisher to King, Parliament, Religion and State.
THERE has been a great noise and rumor about the appellation and name of
Roundheads: But it is not yet apparent, neither by Ancient or Modern Writers,
what these Roundheads should be, neither to what use or means this name or
appellation is applied, or on what it is bestowed or meant. If it be intended
by the Author that first devised this name, that it should be attributed and
construed to the plain and right understanding of the word, as it is a
primitive word, and literally;

Then it must be understood of all men as they have Roundheads, although some
heads be rounder then others, as if a man have a round shoulder, he is called
round shouldered, and if a man have a bottle-nose, he is called a bottle-nose,
and so likewise in all the like occasions, men may be termed by such names and
appellations, and so in this construction, only thou that first set forth this
name of Roundhead shall be so termed, and my self likewise will be thy
brother Roundhead. So likewise all men in Christendom are termed Christians,
although some be good, and some bad, some of one opinion and some of another,
some Papists, some Brownists, some Anabaptists, etc. yet all Brothers in
Christ; now as in this sense all men may be termed by the name of Roundheads,
it must not be understood and conceived that the Author did intend that all men
should be so termed or reputed, but he had a further reach to attribute this
name as a nickename, or a scandal to some particular persons, which opinion
verily is by all or most men conceived, and not to the sense or construction of
a primitive word only, for that were nothing, but as may be understood of all
men alike. Now then good brother Roundhead, for so we are all in the primitive
word, give me leave to express your understanding herein (if you have any
understanding) and to unfold that which has so long been hid, and not
unmasked, and that you and all the world shall confess, who are the right
Roundheads you meant in particular, for no doubt in the general, it was
intended by you as a by-blow and nickename of scandal to some particular kind
of persons, and those in all men's judgments must be meant of such as deserve
scandal; for it is in charity conceived, that you would not apply scandal but
upon such as deserved it, whether it be in some particular sin, as
Drunkenness, Adultery, loose life, or erroneous in their Religion or Doctrine:
or in some outward comportment, or ceremony, or the like, contrary to the
civil and lawful government of our Church, State and Kingdom.

Now then dear brother Roundhead, I must seriously tell you that there are
but two sorts of men in the world, the one good, the other bad; so Christians
being men, are some good, some bad, so all men are Roundheads in the primitive
sense, and so some good, some bad: now in charity it is granted that you meant
not this nickname nor scandal against the good, howsoever the good may be
abused by these names: now then to come nearer the matter, how many sorts of
good men be there, and how many sorts of bad men be there? As for the good in
this cause, they admit no division, and therefore we must leave them, as no
part of our Discourse, because it will not be denied by the Author himself,
but that they were cleared of this nickname or scandal, and was never intended
against them: Well then, it must be understood (as far as we can gather) how
many sorts of bad men there be, for they are not as the good are, but may be
divided, and surely are always divided, for they can never agree; and so to
know against what sort of bad this name was intended. Now to come yet a little
nearer to my brother Roundheads meaning, let the bad be of as many sorts as
can be thought of, for it were too much for one to remember them all. It is
conceived that amongst all these bad sorts of people in the world, he intended
this nickname or scandal upon that sort of bad that are contrary, opposite, or
differing in Religion and ceremonies to the Doctrine of the Church of England.
Now upon this point it must be known who, and how many sorts of religions,
Ceremonies and practices there be, which are contrary to the true and Orthodox
Church of England; but because there be so many sorts, it will be too tedious
to recite them all, and to tell you of the whole nine and twenty sects of late
set forth, but only touch those that are known to be the most enemies to the
Church and State, as the Papists, the Brownists, the Anabaptists, the
Separatists, and a new Religion, and yet no Religion, called Cavalliers, which
is lately sprung up, Jam nova progenies barathro sublata sub imo, Chara diaboli
soboles etc. They in some sort would imitate the Apostles that were fishermen,
for with these Cavalliers all is fish that come to their net. And yet to come a
little nearer my brother Roundhead, it must be known also which of these
sorts or sects he meant or intended by this nick name of Roundhead. Now
because there lies the hidden mystery, this riddle was never dissolved, nor
none by him ever named, who or what particular sect was the intended
Roundhead, therefore it must, shall, and can be not otherwise intended and
meant, but that all sects, as Papists, Brownists, Anabaptists, Separatists,
Cavalliers, and whatsoever else are not with, or any way against the true
protestant Religion maintained by the King, Parliament and State of this
Kingdom, are and shall be from henceforth deemed, reputed, and taken by the
names and appellations of Roundheads, and shall be from henceforth so
authorized to be named and reputed by Act of Parliament, and the aforesaid
honest Protestant to be cleared herein: and this no doubt was the true meaning
and intention of the author, howsoever it has been misapplyed many times by
these aforesaid Roundheads, to unload themselves and cast this aspersion upon
the true, honest, Religious, and Zealous Protestants, whom neither King, or
Parliament, or good men could ever detect; and therefore, me thinks, the
Author was not so wise neither (as God might have made him) for if he had he
might have expressed and set down every particular Roundhead, with a several
addition, whereby they might have been the better known to the Kingdom, and
done himself much honor to clear his meaning, in expressing himself and his
good will, in clearing those good Protestants that were no ways to be
accounted amongst that rabble, as that rabble would make them: as for example,
the Papists in regard of this, many mischievous Machiavile plots and
conspiracies against this State and Kingdom, as that of 88. and that of the
Gunpowder Treason, with many other Machiavilian devises, continually practiced
against our King, this present Parliament, and State, and therefore it had
been a very fit addition to have called them by the name of a Machiavile
Roundhead, so likewise the Brownists, because they Preach and teach at the
backeside of Brownes Barn, from which name and Barn they had their
denomination of their Religion, and therefore it had been very well to have
known them (as hereafter they shall be) by the name of a Brown Roundhead. So
likewise the Separatists and Anabaptists, they use to rebaptize in Rivers, and
preach in Tubs, and other secret places, and such like odd devises, and
therefore it is very proper to have them called by the name of Tub Roundheads.
And so likewise these Cavalieres, whose Religion is so hidden and not known
indeed to be any at all; and not to have any means of living, but Ex damno
alterius, and these are those that swear God dam'me, and therefore there can
be no name or addition more proper to distinguish them from the other, then to
call them damned Roundheads, and this is the damned Roundhead indeed, Projicit
ampull as and sesquipedalia verba; and it is most certain, if they do not
amend their lives damnation will be their end, which God have mercy upon them,
and give them repentance. These, and many more might be expressed, but that it
were too tedious, I will name only one sort more, which are as ill or worse
then the rest, and these are the Pulpit men, Ministers, and perhaps there might
be gleaned out some that taste of every sort of these before named Roundheads,
but they shall go with their followers. But here specially is meant those
Pulpit men, that upon all occasions are of all Religions, that will drink up
iniquity as beasts drink water; I mean the scandalous Ministers, qui sunt
Rebels lumini, that will profess with the good, but act with the bad, which
are a shame and scandal to them that are good Ministers indeed, such as are
Drunkards, Adulterers, contentious persons, mankillers, common Barrettors, like
that Minister that had forty and odd Articles against him in Print, and like
the two noted scandalous ministers in Suffolk, named Thomas Fowkes, and John
Lowes, the one found guilty of killing a man, the other Arraigned for
witchcraft, and convicted for a common Barretror, as appears on Record, and
as they are lively set forth in a Printed Book called the Magazine of
Scandal: these are the devilish crew, that are not only bad themselves but
infect others, and carry a brand and plague with them wheresoever they come,
not only by their insufficiency, diversity, and unconstancy of Doctrine, but
also by their example of evil life and conversation, quorum non solum vita,
sed oration est execrabilis, and therefore they shall (as most proper to them)
bear the name and brand of devilish Roundheads, and of these the Parliament
have had notice of sufficiently, and have promised a course accordingly to
purge the Church of them. Now brother Roundhead, if you had taken this course
to have given your distinction and addition in this kind, you had not left a
gap open for the disparagement of any other honest religious good Protestant
Minister or Layman, as these Roundheads have taken advantage to do, thinking
thereby to clear themselves of that imputation. But let it be granted that
these Machiavell, Brown. Tub, Damned, devilish Roundheads, will apply this
name of Roundhead to an honest, good and zealous Protestant (as none else
will) then it cannot be attributed to him, nor can he have any other addition
then a good Roundhead, for else we are clean against our former ground, that
all men (and so all Roundheads) are either good or bad, and good admits no
division as before sufficiently is made manifest, but of bad you may see how
many divisions there be, and as long as a Protestant be good as no doubt there
is none good, but a true zealous Protestant, then let these aforesaid
Macheavell Round, tub, damned, devilish Roundheads, call them what they will,
they care not, neither was it ever taken to themselves, neither will any man of
any reasonable judgment, ever think that it was the Authors meaning to
attribute it to them, and let my brother Roundhead clear himself in this
point, for if he meant otherwise then here is formerly expressed, he shall no
longer be my Brother Roundhead, in the simple and primitive construction and
understanding of the word, as before is declared, but shall be adjudged and
deemed for ever hereafter to be one of the other former right Roundheads
indeed, and so amongst them shall be declared to be by Act of Parliament, as
all Machiavell, brown, tub, damned and devilish Roundheads shall be. And
although thou should be such a Roundhead as that thou should mean
otherwise then before is expressed, yet then thou must think that no honest,
no wise man will judge or account thee to be either honest or wise in thy
intentions, for who can deserve any nickname or soandall, but such as are
against our true Religion, such as are disquieters of our public peace, such
as are evil Counselors to King or State, such as will or would make division
betwixt King and Parliament, or State, but for their own ends.

And what are these but such or the like kind of Roundheads, as before are
manifested? I pray tell me unto whom should we attribute any nicke name or
scandal but to such, who are the Roundheads now? Can any man speak the
contrary? Can any man (I mean of the sober and honest sort) attribute any
nicke name or scandal to honest and good men? yet some of these sorts of
Roundheads have not been ashamed to abuse the most Religious, well governed
Protestants, yea some of the very highest Court of Justice, from whence we have
had, must, and ought to have our chiefest being both for our Religion, lives,
and estates, or else we must perish, and by whose daily unspeakeable labors,
do endeavor to preserve the Kings Majesty, themselves, and all good Subjects
from that miserable condition in which we are ready to fall into by the means
of those Roundheads, if they do not like good hearted Soldiers, persevere in
this good work, and stand in the battle with an invincible constancy, against
all opposition and corruption that can be, secretly, openly, or cunningly,
projected, divised, imagined or intended against the Kings Majesty, his
Parliament, and body, and heart of this famous Kingdom, as hitherto they have
done. Please his Majesty, and the Parliament unanimously to consent to root
out these forenamed Roundheads (as no doubt but they will:) O then our fears
and rumors of wars will vanish as mists against the morning Sun.

O what a happy state our Kingdom will be reduced unto! for then no doubt but
his Majesty as head, may be compared like the Sun in the firmament with his
body of so many stars about him, yea so many millions of inferior stars, as
there be inferior Subjects in his three Kingdoms, will shine about him with joy
full hearts, and crying loud acclamations of Joy. What a wickedness is it to
think that the head should be divided from the body, in which body we all know
the heart lies? Oh the heart of the Subject is a preservative and cordial
thing to a Prince, and so also the head being taken away, the heart dies. O
what a devilish damned trick of the Devil was this, to bring or send such
Machevile damned Roundheads and incendiaries into the World, to work such an
unheard of plot as (if they could) to divide the King and the Parliament! O
tempora, O mores! And none but the devil and his agents and servants could
ever have devised the like; but yet for all this the body and the heart will
not be divided from their head, invito diabolo; they work day and night
without breathing or sleeping to draw and obtain their head unto them (Vis
unita fortior) they will not be divided, they will endeavor to support the
King out of the hands of his secret enemies, and raise his Majesty's honor and
state, they will draw him with cords of love, and hands of love, howsoever the
devil, and these forenamed Machevile damned Roundheads endeavor to overthrow
both King and Kingdom, and weigh him like Belshazzer, qui inventus est minus
habens, but it is God hearing our prayers will cast out all these devils from
amongst us; for by prayer it must be done, and these Roundheads his servants
will not fail of themselves, and then seek a new Country, where they will get
new footing, and perhaps may hope for new projections else where, if in the
mean time the Gallows or some other place of execution do not stop them.
Now to conclude that which is the matter treated of, that is the Declaration
and settling of this name, of the Right Roundheads indeed, I most humbly
beseech his Majesty, and that most honorable body and heart of the Kingdom,
to give their approbation and opinion in this affair, and so to countenance
the good, honest, zealous and true protestant, and to discharge them in your
good opinions of this term of Roundhead (as no doubt you can do no
otherwise) and to lay and set it (as due of Right belonging) upon the before
named Roundheads, with their additions, as namely the Machevile Roundhead,
the Brown Roundhead, the Tubb Roundhead, the damned Roundhead, and the
devilish Roundhead, these being the chief, yea the only troublers and
enemies to Religion, the King, State, and Kingdom, and to whom this
appellation or term was without all question; first attributed and deservedly
intended, it being unpossible that any good men should deserve any nickename or
scandal, or that any man that could but write or read English should intend
or cast it upon any good man, much less the Author thereof; and thus by your
good countenance and approbation the Roundhead may be thus known and
distinguished from honest men by Act of Parliament, that is, by consent both of
King and Parliament; which I being sure not to be denied; it is granted that
they must for ever hereafter be so named, reputed, and taken. Now to set forth
the watchful wisdoms, the laborious carfulness, the continual diligence,
and unspeakeable blessings God has given this Parliament to enable them to
prevent all these plots and conspiracies, whereby they have preserved both the
King, themselves, and Kingdom; It were a folly yea a presumption in me to
endeavor to do or say more therein; being impossible for me to do: But thus
much for conclusion, I am sure I may, and can, and will say; God bless the
King, and his Parliament, and confound all those aforesaid Roundheads, or any
other that wish any hurt either to King, Parliament, or Kingdom, or go about
to work any division or separation betwixt the King and the Parliament, or
Subjects. And so I desire all honest men to remember, and know who are the
Right Roundheads indeed, and to shun them and all others that to this will not
say, Amen.

TO Cavaliers, that hang in the briers, and so to every Just as,
Quidlibet audendi semper fuit aequa potestas.
They drink and fight, from morn till night, but still lodge where their
whore is,
Laudandi ne quid cogitent tolerare laboris.
Rob and steal, and cut piecemeale, these Roundheads never repent them;
Monstrum horrendum, inform, ingens, cui lumen ademptum.
The battle spun, these Roundheads run, you must know where their flight is:
For, Noctes atque dies patet atri janua Ditis.
When spoil they get, they cry more yet, but none will say, Dolebo;
But, Flectere si nequeo superos, Ach^ronta movebo.
They have open throats, Red Lousie Coats, I care not for their lice I;
Spectatum admissi risum teneatis amici?
In zeal and heat, of love so great, with whores they please with verbis:
Hei mihi quod nullis amor est medicabilis herbis.
They plunder our food, and envy our good, and they live where none but slime
is:
Invidus alterius rebus macrescit opimis.
They have fiery swords, and blustering words, and swear God dam'me I Will eat
thee;
Nam mirandacanunt, sed non credenda poetae.
From death and harms, yea without arms, our God from devils will ease us;
Daemona non armis, sed morte subegit Jesus.
Without all grace, with ill looking face, which show they will infult you:
Heu quam difficile est crimen non prodere vultu!
These roaring dawes, will put down Laws, and turn things topsie-turva,
Argentum atque Aurum faciunt rectissima curva.
Let these red-coats, pull out our throats, let us sleep till they have plucked
us:
Quos ego? sed motos praestat componere fluctus.
Shal's fire them all, both great and small, and thus seek to decline these?
Est modus in rebus, sunt certi denique fines.
King and Cavaleeres, Parliament and Peers, the Kingdom do deplore ye:
Sol^men miseris Socios habuisse dolor.
They live on the lurch, but near go to Church, profaning with vice they
have plenty:
Petere nec temphem, venerare nec omnipotenti.
The work shall be no man's, to make us al Romans, it is God that bids them repent
them,
Tantae molis erit Romanam condere gentem.
The great French pock, Venerean smock, and rot is come among um,
Cum multis aliis quae nunc perscribere longum.
FINIS.
