A Full and True ACCOUNT OF A MOST Barbarous Murder and Robbery COMMITTED BY
John Davis, On the Body of Esquire; Bowles's Lady,
At Cleaver near Windsor: Particularly, How being Servant to her, he for the
Lucre of her Money beat her Brains out in the Night with a Bar of Iron, and
afterward Cut her Throat from Ear to Ear in a most Barbarous manner, and
afterward Robbed the House of 300 Pounds in Gold, besides Watches, Rings, etc.
of great value.

With the manner of its being concealed near a Fortnight, before the Murder
was found out, as also the strange and remarkable Discovery thereof.

To which is added, The Reward of 50 l. offered by Esquire; Bowls to any who shall
take and apprehend the Murderer, with the Description of his Person, Age,
Habit and Complexion, how to know him.

Although many Tragical Actions of this Nature, have been often Committed of
late, by several Barbarous and Bloody minded Villians, yet this Notorious
Barbarity following, considering it in all its Fatal and Notorious
Circumstances; equalizes* if not exceeds all that hitherto has been heard of,
and the rather, because the Person concerned was a pretended faithful Servant
to the unhappy deceased Lady; as the particulars following more largely
manifests.

The Worshipful Charles Bowls Esquire; having upon the Request of his Lady Madam
Martha Bowls, by reason of her Age, and continual Indisposition, appointed her
a Farm-house at Cleaver, within a Mile of Windsor, to live privately and
retired, appointing one John Davis, a Manservant, only to wait on her, and to
manage the Business relating to the Farm; though according to her desire, he went
every Night to Windsor to lodge, and returned each Morning to the said Farm
about his Business, which he had performed to all appearance, two Years
successively very faithfully, to the approbation not only of Esquire; Bowls his
Master, but the Ancient Gentlewoman also, with whom he lived.

But observe the dreadful effects of Covetousness, how strangely it opperates
on the Minds and Affections of those where Grace is wanting: For John Davis,
her aforesaid Servant, having sometimes at the desire of his Lady, removed some
Chests, and other things for her, particularly a Trunk, which he perceived by
its weight to be well furnished with store of Treasure, he from that time, as
it is supposed, cove^ed to have in his Possession; for on the 22d. of September
last, (as near as can be conjectured by his Lady not coming abroad as usually)
he not having the fear of God before his Eyes, and being void of all natural
pity and human compassion, took a Bar of Iron, and beat his poor innocent
Ladies Brains out, with the repitition of several othre dreadful and unmerciful
Blows on several parts of the Body, as plainly is made manifest by the
plurality of Bruises, as well on the Head and Arms, as on other parts, the
which was done (as some think) in order to force her to discover some more than
ordinary valuable Treasure.

But not satisfied with this inhuman Cruelty, he to make the Villainy more
Barbarous, Tragical and Fatal, cut her Throat in a dismal and bloody manner,
the Wound extending from Ear to Ear, leaving the Aged and unfortunate Lady
weltring in her Blood, and then fell to plundring the House, especially the
Trunks, Chests and Closets, where he supposed to find the most Treasure, from
whence, as it is said, he took to the value of near three Hundred Pound in Gold
and Silver, 200 pieces of Old Gold, having been since found in a Trunk at his
Lodings in Pest^od-street in Windsor? So that it is plain matter of Fact, that
he was the Author of that notorious Action. But to proceed: He having performed
this Tragical Scene of Barbarty, and secured his Booty, he locked all the
doors, and marched off; but some few days after, had the impudent boldness to
go to London, to the White-horse in Fleet Street, and there told the Windsor
Coachman, and others, that his Father, who formerly had been a Trooper in the
Earl of Oxford's Regiment was lately dead, and had left him 400 pound; adding,
That tho his Father in his Life time did reject him for being undutiful, yet he
had remembered him at his Death; therefore he was resolved to live like a
Gentleman: And thereupon not only bought a brave Clothes but Rings to his
finger, and a Sword to his side: and not only so, but pulled a handful of
Guineas out of his Pocket, and swagger'd at a very strange bold and extravagant
rate, treating all who would keep him company; and that which is most to be
wondered at, with those who knew from whence he came, and with whom he had lived.

Esquire; Bowls her Husband coming to Clea^er on Sunday last, asked some of the
Town, how his Wife did, who was answered, That they had not seen her for near a
Fortnight, therefore doubted that she was not well, by reason she did not walk
in her Garden as usual: Upon which the Squire sending his Man to the House, to
enquire of ^er Welfare, found the Doors not only shut, but locked fast, and the
Key taken thence; so that returning to the Esquire; informed him thereof; whereupon
immediately by the Esqrs; Orders, the Door was forced open, when searching
about the House, at last the unfortunate Gentlewoman was found Murdered in a
most Barbarous and wretched manner, as aforesaid; where was found by her the
Iron Bar with (as it is conjectured) her Murderer struck her with, before he
cut her Throat: During this hurry and amazement, occasioned by the discovery of
this dreadful Accident, and notorious Robbery,

The People then being at Church, some disorder was observed among them by one
going out after another; at which ti^e the aforesaid John Davis, being there
also and having a guilty Conscience, was observed to go out with all the have
imaginable, and went directly away and took Horse, and that means made his
escape before any Person could ground suspicion of his being Guilty of his
Ladies Murder, and the rather by reason, he so frequently came backwards and
forwards too and from thence as before, though indeed his being so full of Money
all on a sudden, and his being so finely equipt was not a little wondered at;
notwithstanding his repeated pretenses relating to the Legacy his Father had so
lately and largely bestowed upon him: It Is strangely remarkable, that this
Notorious and Wicked Person having performed such a Barbarous and Wicked Action
of Murder and Robbery, should notwithstand; be so Abominable Impudent and
Presumptiously bold as to appear publicly in the same Town so often where the
said Bloody Tragedy was Acted; so that neither Terror of Conscience nor dread
of Punishment for such a Loathsome Crime, made any Sensible Impression upon
him, is a thing altogether strange and uncommon, provided all Circumstances be
considered.

For the better Discovery and Apprehending the said Murderer; Esquire; Bowls has
not only Issued out Hue and Cries several ways but has offered a Reward of 50
l. to any who shall Take and Apprehend him the particulars, (as in the last
Gazet) I have inserted as follows.
