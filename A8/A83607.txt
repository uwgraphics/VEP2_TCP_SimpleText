Die Sabbathi, 26 Augusti, 1643.
WHereas diverse persons have been Assessed upon the Ordinances of Parliament,
for the twentieth part, and weekly Assessement, Subsidies, and other payments;
many of which have Refractorily and wilfully suffered the days for payment of
the sums Assessed to be elapsed, and covertly conveyed away their goods from
their houses, and absented their persons to avoid payment of their
Assessements, or else have suffered Imprisonment and their houses to stand
empty, whereby they might be free from bearing part of those common Taxes and
Charges, which the necessities of these troublous times require: For remedy
whereof, and better satisfaction of the sums Assessed on such persons, It is
this day Ordered by the Lords and Commons assembled in Parliament, That such
persons as shall be appointed by the Committee of Lords and Commons for
advance of Money, and other necessaries for the Army, shall have power to let,
set, or Rent forth, to such persons and for such time, Fine, and Rent, as they
shall think fit, the houses of any person or persons, who are already
Imprisoned for their Assessments, or absent themselves for nonpayment of their
Assessments, And the Moneys raised by the Rents of the said Houses, to convert
and employ toward satisfaction of the same Assessements, and payments: And
that such persons as shall take the same Houses, shall discharge the head Rents
due to be paid for such houses, as also the duties to the Parish during their
abode in the same, and the persons so taking and Leasing the said houses, shall
be saved harmless and indempnified, against the persons Imprisoned, or
absenting themselves as aforesaid, by the power and Authority of both Houses of
Parliament.

Die Sabbathi, 26 Augusti, 1643.
