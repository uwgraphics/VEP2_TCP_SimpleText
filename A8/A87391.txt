To all my fellow Commoners that love peace and righteousness.
THere are new births of providence every day wherein the wisdom of God
appears in a very delightful variety. There are yet not many days since some
who are neither true friends to the King or Kingdoms interest, to the
Episcopal or Presbyteriall Interest, were driving on the Chariot of the State
on their own wheels, wheels of self-interest, and popularity abusing only the
notion and name of a King, Episcopacy and Presbytery, to form a Kingdom to
their own advantage. But Divine Providence seeing this, opposes it self against
such a vanity, working out this politic power and selfish sensual wisdom, and
set new wheels on going, and new preparatories to justice and righteousness,
fortifying weak and despised instruments, to do and accomplish things in order
to his own glory.

But, lo the prider and vanity of men acted by self-respects: when God cosses
them in their enterprises, behold hew they spurn against him, if he employs
any instruments to hinder the building of their Babylonish towers, aspiring
toward the heavens, then may you see how through policy and power they seek to
traduce and calumniate such instrumenct, branding their loyal and upright
actions with the ignominious terms of Treasons and Rebellions. But (I hope)
these men's folly begins now to be made manifest to all men, and shall no more
be covered. By these few lines ensuing, if thy eyes be opened, thou whosoever
thou art that shall read them, may see the mystery of this iniquity working
in that Pamphlet, which for truths sake and thy better information in this
following discourse, thou shall see a little unmasqued.

A Vindication of his MAJESTY and the Army, from a Paper of M. Reymes,
pretending to be printed by the authority of the LORDS in Parliament.
MAster Reymes to gain the more credit to his own inventions, with much
falsehood, he has interwoven some truth: yet so confusedly that, it is a hard
matter to say what he has related truly; for his Relations are either guilty
of direct contrariety to truth, Addition or Substraction. And how a man may
scandalize any man by any truth, by such an imperfect, lame, and false
relation, I leave to wisemen to judge.

Whereas Master Reymes says, for his admission to his Majesty, Major General
Brown espying him, proffered him the honor of his Majesty's hand: Major
General Brown denies that he ever knew this man, or so proffered him his
Majesty's hand, but Master Reymes desired it of him.

And whereas Master Reymes writes that the King struck Colonel Whaley for his
presumptuous listening, while his Majesty was in conference with one, whom they
suspected, came from London, The truth is, the report of his is false, the King
denies that he struck him: neither was the Messenger suspected to come from
London, but the truth of that matter is as follows.

There came a Messenger to New Market, from the Prince of Orange, and the rest
of the Kings Friends, with a message to his Majesty, which he delivered to the
King as he was walking in the Garden, Colonel Whaley espying this Messenger
privately to be discoursing with his Majesty, desired him to forbear any further
discourse in private with him, whose desire was grounded upon the
Commissioners, declaring to him that at Holmby none were suffered privately to
discourse with the King, nor any that had been in the Kings Army, to come
within three miles of Holmby, Colonel Whaley endeavoring to prevent any evil
Counselors from his Majesty, the danger and prevalency of whom this Kingdom
yet groans* under the woeful experience of, and to keep a good correspondency
with the Commissioners, true it is, the King was something troubled at it, and
did thrust him from him, but not strike him, according to the Pamphlet, and the
reason of the Kings so doing, was when the King after dinner was discoursing
with this Messenger in the Presence Chamber, Colonel Whaley came in, which made
the King as he said himself to talk a little longer with him* to see what
the Colonel would do

The Colonel perceiving this, desired the King to forbear speaking with any
such persons; the King then protested he would not, for it they were in his
sight, he would not bid them go away; Then the Colonel desiring him to
forbear speaking with him, the King thrust him away, not for presumptuous
listening, as Mr. Reymes affirms.

To pass by the many particular untruths and incertainties of Master Reymes
his relation, the substance of it being to make the world believe that the King
was taken away against his will, I shall in a word or two answer to that;

When we came to Holmby, he told me when we had answered his desires, and those
things we should propound to him, he would go along with us; to which his
propositions we gave him such a satisfactory answer, that he told us, he would
go with us whether the Commissioners would, yea or no, and accordingly did.
Moreover, one of the Commissioners before ever I spoke with his Majesty, told
me he was resolved to go with us.

Whereas Master Reymes further affirms, that the King said, that if he were
at the head of the Army, he would protest against all their proceedings, the
King denied to me that ever he said so. But I shall for this time leave Master
Reymes without any further Character of the man, or reply to his paper, then
what his Majesty said of both at the sight of his Book; who said, if the
Citizens dealt thus with him, he should be careful of having to do with them,
or speaking to a Citizen for time to come, except it were before five or six
witnesses, they being so sickle, by which it may fully appear, that he has
abused his Majesty, by laying those things to his charge, which he never said,
wronged Major General Brown, by imputing that to him which he never did,
scandalized the Army, by saying they took away the King against his will, when
he went according to his profession willingly with them, injured Collonell
Whaley, by affirming the King did strike him, for presumptuous listening to his
Majesty's discourse with the Messenger, which was no such matter, deluded the
people by presenting them with a false Relation to prejudice, forestall, and
capivate their judgments, and surprised the house of Lords, by obtaining to
all this his wickedness their authority for its publication.

Therefore now fellow Commoners, who are borne to as large privileges and
immunities as any people on the earth, which you may all challenge as your
birthright, lest you should be induced through the subtilty of some litigious
Lawyers, or through the policy and specious pretenses of any man whatsoever to
judge our action of guarding his Majesty from Holmby to be illegal, and
contrary to the trust reposed in us, assure your selves that action of ours was
not a rash precipitant enterprise, as some say, but challenges the law of
Natuee, Nations, this Kingdom, and our Commissioners derived from the
Parliament for its foundation.

The law of Nature vindicates us, for as in a natural body which is composed
of sundry members, may lawfully seek its own preservation as from inward
distempers, or out ward dangers that threaten its ruin, so likewise may a
political body do, if the head be in danger, the foot ought to run, and the
hand to act for its preservation, and in this endeavor every member
particularly, as well as jointly, is obliged, so that if one hand be cut off,
one foot lame, one eye forth, the other hand foot and eye are not hereby
disingaged, but the more firmly bound to put forth their utmost powers for the
bodies fence.

2. The Law of Nations warrants us, every Nation inviolably maintaining this,
that every member in the Nation ought to preserve the Nation as much as in him
lies; It is a universal principle, non nobis solum nati sumus, etc. We are not
borne for our selves alone, but the Country in which we live chalenges an
interest in us, this principle made many rejoice in dying, esteeming it, dulce
and decorum pro patria mori.

3. The Law of this Kingdom (by which we may expect to stand or fall) secures
us in this Kingdom, we have this Maxim, that solus populi is suprema lex,
The safety of the people is the supremest law; this was the hinge we moved
upon, the Kingdoms safety was endangered, and without a speedy application of
a timely preservative was likely to be consumed: the best preservative we
could see, was the security of his Majesty's person, which our act has
effected. Whose enemies are so dull, and whose understanding is so stupefied
and sottishly blind, but may remember and know what a sad disaster has
befallen the Kingdom, in the expense of so much blood and treasure, by the
surprising of his Majesty's Person in the late wars? who can but know, had
they not had his persons their designs had proved abortive? We will know there
was a design to seixe on his Majesty, to raise a new Army, and unnaturally to
involve this Kingdom in its own blood, and so to render our latterend
miserably worse then our beginning, but this we thought our selves bound to
prevent if possible, which we still judge and doubt not to prove it, and is yet
lawful for us to do. As the King is by the law of this Kingdom bound to
govern and secure us according to the Law, so are we engaged to secure his
Person against the violaters of the Law, which we have, through the blessing of
God accomplished, Our end was not his enthrallment, bondag and ruin, as by our
actions may appear, but his safety, an the Kingdoms preservation, which
otherwise we justly fea had both been endangered, suppose the King through
ignorance of traitors intention to destroy His Person or His Kingdom, should
expose himself to the mercy of him that sought his life, do you imagine it
would be treasonable for any one to remove his Majesty though without his
consent fro^m the place the traitor sought his life in, and so to preserve him?
but the case is yet more fair for us, His judg^ment being satisfied, his will
was likewise concurring to his remove, we hope this our action will be recented
in good part by all the Nation for whose good it was effected. Had the King
been surprised, another army been under his name raised, the Nation once more
wallowed in its own blood then surely but too late, would the people have cried
out, oh that some had been stirred up to have stood in this breach.

4. The Commission from the Parl. whom some say though with more boldness then
judgment, more malice then wisdom, and more envy then prudence or honesty, we
have rebelled against and acted contrary to in this action) acquits us, for by
our Commission we are bound to seek the preservation of the Kings person,
whether we have not so done let all the kingdom judge: what hurt to his person
have we done what hurt to the Kingdom have we done? we are not conscious to
our selves that we have in this done amiss, who has cause to complain, surely
none can nor will, except those who had thought to have made all men dance
after their pipes, kiss their hands, and resign up their birthrights,
liberties and lives to their arbitrary, and tyrannical, lawless boundles
wills, these Haman-like are mad to think a poor Mordecay will not standcap in
hand, bow his knee, and bend unto them.

Now therefore fellow Commoners I dare assure you, if you* listen to those men
that in pulpit and press sound forth continual alarmes against us, you will
involve your selves and us in a bloody abhorred by us) engagement. Therefore my
advice to you all, whom I love and honor, for whose peace and native
immunities and Privilege, I think no task too hard to undertake, no labor too
great to undergo, no danger so fearful as not to venture my self) is that you
would speedily and unanimously address your selves to the Parliament (whom you
have chose, whose servants in truth they are or ought to be) that they would no
longer protect unjust men through lawless pretense of infringing the liberties
of Parliament, but that they would give free liberty, and declare it to all the
Kingdom, that all and every man shall and may have free liberty to accuse any
member of that house, and that no man shall fit there against whom the Kingdom
shall have ought justly, as being an unreasonable thing, to think that the
oppressors of the subject are fit Reformers of the Kingdom, and that the
Parliament would speedly without delay hasten this Kingdomes-yeare of Jabile,
that every man may return to his own* home, sit under his own vine, and all our
swords may be turned into plow shares, that there may no more be the alarm of
war sounded in this Kingdom. You, Oh Countrymen it lies upon you to remedy
that the Parliament are your Stevvards, they ought to give a good account of
their actions, you have set them a work, good reason they should tell you what
they have done for you, have you not parted with much pence, much money, much
blood, and are you content to bury all in oblivion? never to enquire what is
become of all your lost pains and endeavors? Assure your selves, that if you
awake not you are undone, God has put an opportunity into your hands, will you
not embrace it? If you neglect this, you may never have another, when all your
money friends and arms are in the hands of your enemies, do you expect justice
then, and can hardly have any now? Dear Country men, the Commonwealth is
sick at heart, and groan under a desperate distemper, it lies languishing
even as at the last gasp of peace Bleeding has produced no other effect then
to make it more faint; it is time to think of some Cordial, redress and
remedy, the principal cause of our distempers is yet predominant, justice must
take it away, for, sublata causa tolli^^^ effectus; Many of those that pretend
to be our Physicians, administer malignant druggs to us, even oppression,
vexation, and diminution of our estates. But think you that oppression and
slavery is a good receipt to restore us to liberty, or to free us from bondage.
Be corrupt men fit instruments to remove our corruption? If you ever expect
peace and quietness with justice and righteousness to live and flourish in
this Kingdom, then seek to remove coveto^^ men, that seek to fill their own
baggs, though they (...) the Kingdom, bloodthirsty men, treacherous men that
have betrayed their trust from all places of public concernment, that
endeavor to re-enter honest men (who have been displaced) into the places of
trust, into the Militi^, Common Council, Courts of Judicature; for through the
great corruption that yet remains in all courts the foot-step^ of reformation
are yet invisible: Endeavor to call all men to account, whither Parliament
men, Committee Men, Judges, Justices, Lord Moyor, Mayors, Aldermen,
Common Council men; all Officers, Soldiers, Treasurers, and all men that have
been entrusted with any thing of the public, that the good stewards may be
rewarded, have a character of honor stamped upon them, the evil imbezellin^
stewards may be displaced, punished, and their ill gotten goods taken from
them, and given to the right owners; Use all your lawful power to place the
Militia of the Kingdom in the hands of such men that have best husbanded it
for your advantage, go on and cease not, till Righteousness and peace flows
down in this Kingdom like a mighty water, till the oppressed and imprisoned be
set at liberty and this gasping, languishing, dying Kingdom be instated into a
full absolute, complete and pefect possession of all its native privileges,
freedoms, Charters and immunities whatsoever, wherein assure your selves, you
will have no cause of repentance, but shall receive a crown of joy, and a deep
share, portion and interest of such liberty, as a long time through blinding
guides have been hid from your eyes, your burdens are greater then ever good
men discountenanced, evil men encouraged, your purses exhausted, your liberties
infringed by many taxes and assessements, by the Covetous Clergy man's exacting
of tithes, the great burden of the Commonwealth, by quartering of Soldiers.
Oh therefore cease not to endeavor petitioning, demand again and again, for
your Liberties which if you do, and the Lord prosper you, I shall rejoice,
however I have done my duty, and discharged my conscience, and shall I hope
ever in liberty and in bonds, in Peace and war, in the capacity of a
soldier, or of an English man, in life and death in all lawful things, by all
lawful means manifest my self to beyours and the Kingdoms faithful servant,
against all oppression, and oppressions, tyranny and tyrants, by what
Prerogative, names, titles or pretenses, they are or may be dignified or
distinguished whatsoever, although I perish in the work.
