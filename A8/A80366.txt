THE CASE OF Francis Earl of Carlingford: Humbly offered to the Honorable the
House of Commons.
FRancis Earl of Carlingford is seized of a small Estate in Ireland which is
not forfeited, but is charged with Debts and Encumbrances to near the value
thereof, and among others, there are claimed as due upon the said Estate some
dormant Debts to Forfeiting Persons, which Forfeited Debts by the Bill now
depending will be vested in the Trustees.

There is a Stated Debt of 4000 l. due from the Crown to my Lord Carlingford;
as also the King, since the War ended, directed Ballimote, the Chief Seat of
his Family of considerable Value, to be Demolished, for the Safety of that
Country; and in the late War, and on all Occasions in the several Stations he
has been in Abroad, he has most Zealously and Faithfully and to good Effect
performed all the Services in his Power, not only to His Majesty, but for the
Public Good of England; of which His Majesty was so well Apprized, that he was
Graciously disposed to Discharge the said dormant Forfeited Debts, but the same
was not actually done.

Wherefore, on the said Considerations, he Humbly proposes a Clause, to
Empower the Trustees to enquire into the Truth of the said Debt due to him from
the Crown, and Damages by demolishing his Seat, and does not propose any
Satisfaction from any other Forfeiture or Estate, but only that they may
discount to him what they shall think fit out of the Debts claimed as
Forfeited, and pretended due upon his own Estate, and does not expect otherwise
ever to be Satisfied or Repaired.
